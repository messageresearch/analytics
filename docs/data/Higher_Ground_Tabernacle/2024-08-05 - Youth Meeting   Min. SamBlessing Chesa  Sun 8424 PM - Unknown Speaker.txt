the word dear gracious Heavenly Father we approach your throne of grace and mercy Lord this afternoon thanking you for bringing us back in this house oh Lord look at um each and everyone who has left

have put oh God you know each and everyone's heart desires oh God I pray oh Lord that you grant it unto them Lord you are the only person when you speak once you answer each and everyone's question oh God I pray oh Lord that may you be that this afternoon oh God we ask you to come and have full preeminence in this place oh father I pray that you come and speak through the speaker and hear through the hearer so that that at the end of it all be careful to give you thanks and all the Praises in Jesus Christ's name I pray believing amen um whilst we are standing let us um open our Bibles to the book of um Matthew chapter 6 and verse 9 UM can you please help me to if this is uh connected if this is if this is connected to the Matthew chapter 6 and verse 9 the Bible reads after this manner therefore pray ye Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name amen amen first 10 thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven may the Lord add blessings to the reading of his word may take our seats just turn around to your neighbor and say are you happy to be in the house of the Lord with a smile on your face it's good to see each and everyone was able to make it this afternoon uh it's been a while since we had had our youth meetings so we're hoping we're going to be able to do uh as much as we can uh before the winter starts anden in the Bible verse that we read Jesus was teaching the disciples how to pray it says you pray you say Our Father which are in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on in Earth as it is in heaven so my um my title this afternoon will be an un written law which is choice so uh it will make sense as we go further down so the small topic we're talking about is an unwritten law choice I forgot to ask is there anyone who needs um translation okay Unwritten low and Unwritten low choice I have a couple of slides that I sent to the brothers over there that's where I put all my notes so um um depending on them we able to put it on the um on the tablet I mean so we speaking about choice this afternoon so when God created man he put a law and he gave each and every person an ability to choose when he put Adam and Eve in the garden he gave them what the prophet calls free moral agency which is every person you choose whatever you want to do you are given multiple options but it is up to you to select what you want God is a gentleman he does not force himself on you he does not force force his choice on you but he lets you select what you want and we see that in each and every day that we live we consciously and unconsciously make choices this morning when you wake up you went to your closet or wardrobe you had a lot of clothes unconsciously you made a choice you probably had a lot of shirts or a lot of dresses that you had but then you chose one one particular one and you say this is the one I want you are making a choice no one forced you to wear it this afternoon you probably ate some food you probably had a couple of options that you had but you went to select the exact food that you ate why unconsciously you made a decision to get what you got so we see that in our lives each and every day we have choices that we make so unconsciously and consciously and this is the law that God gave to each and every one of us when he created man when you walked in here this afternoon you had to make a choice where you wanted to sit you could have said there you could have sat there but you decided to sit in that seat why you made a choice amen but we realize and we thank God that we are children of God our choices that we make we make them by faith we make those choices is based on the word um the prophet of God in the choosing of a bride here says in many things of life we are given a choice that's the next slide please in many things of life we are given a choice the way of life itself is a choice we have a right to make our own way choose your own way that we want to live education is a choice we can choose whether we're going to be educated or whether we are not going to be educated education is a choice we can choose whether we're going to be educated or whether we are not going to be educated that's a choice that we have right and wrong is a choice every man every woman boy and girl has to choose whether they're going to try and leave right or not leave right it's a choice and he says choice is a great thing so wherever you are seated right now the condition that you are in it is because you made a choice if you go to school and you say I want to study accounting or you say I want to be a lawyer the day when you graduate and you stand and you get that code on it you just did not become a lawyer overnight you just did not wake up and became a doctor overnight but it is because of the choice you made a few years ago amen so wherever you are you are a product of the choices that you made amen and that's what prophet is telling us that choice is a great thing and says your Eternal destination is a choice and maybe tonight some of you will make that choice of where you will spend etern before this service ends tonight and there'll be one time that if you turn God down many time there'll be one time you turn him down the last time and he talking about the line between mercy and judgment amen so your Eternal destination where you are going to go when you move on from this life you have to Cho you have a choice to it whether you're going to hell or you're going to spend it in eternity that's a choice you have to make but remember each and every choice that you make it has a consequence you just don't choose and say oh I'm doing this and then go whichever way whatever you decide to do it has a replication it has a a consequence to it but here the prophet is telling us that even today you can make a choice of where you want to be in eternity you can choose if you want to be in Hell or if you want to go to heaven and he says one time you'll turn him down the last time and that's crossing the line between mercy and judgment says it is it's a dangerous thing for a man a woman boy or girl to step across that line for there is no return when you step across that deadline so that's the line of mercy and judgment in other messages the prophet is talking about you go to church each and every day you hear God calling out your name he is telling you to repent leave what you were doing but you said oh I'll do it next next um next Sunday you don't know tomorrow is not promised for you right you might leave out and this is your last Sunday you never know but that's a choice you're making and he's telling us you will cross that line of mercy and judgment and once you are gone there is no returning and once you have have crossed that line of Mercy there is no more Mercy for you you are done the prophet of God gives the this story of one um one preacher's daughter he went to this pre he went to this pastor's church and he was preaching and he was blasting on sin and when he came out this preacher the pastor's daughter came to me and says um my dad didn't hire you to come and preach this he says no your dad didn't hire me he invited me to come preach then he says what business did you have preaching all that nonsense and she was just fuming at him then they were in their separate ways within a year later after that the prophet of God was walking and this girl came up to him and she's saying oh do you want a cigarette do you want to do you want to smoke and he was wondering what's going on with this girl and the girl said do you remember me and then he said yes then she said that day when you told me when you rebuked me that's the day I cross the line and she says she was done and she told the prophet and said said this point in my life I can even see my mother's Soul frying in hell like a pancake and I don't even care she had crossed that line of mercy and judgment that day was her last day so you never know when that last day is going to be when you hear God calling out your heart he's calling you to give you for you to give him your life make sure you he to that call cuz you don't know where that line is you don't know when you are going to cross that line but also Satan tries to be slick he tries to come to you and tell you that you've already crossed it it's you already done deal and I was reading uh in question and aners the prophet of God someone came and said how do I know I haven't crossed the line of mercy and judgment yet he says so long you still feel the desire to serve the Lord you haven't crossed it yet so whenever Satan tries to come to lie to you you tell him you are a liar I'm still a child of God I'm still a Son of God I haven't crossed that line yet so no one force you to come here this evening no one forc you to go to church well I hope not but because you came here no matter how many battles you are fighting the slightest desire that you have is God tugging on your heart he wants you to serve him and he is telling you you haven't crossed that line yet because remember once you step across that line there is no turning back amen and he says so tonight it might be the time that many will make their decision where they will spend their endless eternity amen so you have to make a choice remember God gave each and every person free moral agency starting from when he created Adam and Eve he said you can choose either the tree of life or the tree of the knowledge and they make made their own choice although he wanted them to stay with the Tree of Life they made their own choice and he let them have it because remember God is a gentleman he is not going to force you but he will tell you what he wants for you because he is the one who created you so he has your user manual you know many of you when you buy when you buy a gadget or um uh an appliance or wherever from a store you have to go look and find the exact user manual and the user manual is created by the person who created this device why because they know how it functions from A to Z they are the ones that put it together so God is the one who created you he is the one who has your user manual you don't even know all of it so whenever you have any questions go to God and ask him Lord what do I need to do here because remember he is the one who put you together the Bible says you are wonderfully and fearfully made I know sisters love that verse say I am wonderfully and fearfully made while you're looking in the mirror there's nothing wrong with that amen cuz God created you in his own image and when he was creating you he had you on his mind and he created the best that he could cuz remember you are made in his own image amen and he created you for his own own pleasure many people they say why would God would just why would God just create people just to worship him they say oh so God is a narcissist he just wants to create people make them have problems and come and start healing them so that he gets all the glory you cannot take God and put him in a human mind and understand him the moment you understand God then he is no longer God am amen you are called only to believe amen so God created you and him for his pleasure he created you and me to worship Him Revelation says Thou Art Worthy oh Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou has created all things he created the plants he created all the nagar Niagara foes he created the Grand Canyon all for his pleasure and he created you for his pleasure says and for thy pleasure they are and were created so whatever you do you are pleasing God Amen so whatever choice you are supposed to make remember first that God created me for his pleasure whatever I'm doing I'm supposed to please him and you as a Christian although you are given those different choices to make you are supposed to come to a place like Jesus and say not my will but your will be done cuz even though as all those options are there he is the one who created you he's the one who made you use a manual he knows which choice you need to make amen and he says there's another choice that we have to make uh in life that's a life's companion a young man or woman stepping out of life um has been given a right to to make a choice the young man chooses the young woman has a right to accept or reject it but it's still a choice on both sides so the man has to make a choice the woman has to make a choice both men and woman they have a right to make a choice that is a choice that God has given us the prophet is talking about the different choices that we have to make and it is totally up to you it says also you have a choice as a Christian you have a choice of the church here in America so far that you can go to that's your own American privilege to choose any church that you want to belong to God does not force you which church to go to you have your own choice you have to decide you have to make the choice to serve him he says that's a choice you don't want to go to any of them if you don't want to but if you want to change from the Methodist to the Baptist or the Catholic to a Protestant or so forth there's nobody can tell you or make you come to any certain church that's our freedom that's our democracy every man can choose for himself freedom of religion and there is a great thing God help us to keep it as long as we can there are so many religions in this world whatever you are looking for whatever you are thinking there's a religion that can fit that so you have a choice to make but you as a Christian you know where you came from and you know where you are going back to so you don't have to start thinking am I supposed to go with Buddhism am I supposed to go with a Muslim or what not because you know you are a Christian you were born again Hallelujah God gave you and called you to worship Him amen and the only way is through Christ so we thank God that we are Christians like the pastor was preaching earlier on before you can say I'm a message believer you are a Christian that's how you identify yourself as so you have to make that decision remember he says you have a choice to of the church that you want to go to but nowadays there is so much moral indecency people carrying on what and doing whatever they want to do but we're not like that we are different called we are called to be different we are called to be a chosen people amen and we want to be like Joshua when he was addressing the children of Israel he said and if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord he says choose you this day whom you will serve whether you want to serve the gods of your fathers which are on the side of the flood there's a God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob or the gods of the amor in whose lands he dwell but he says but as for me in my house we will serve the Lord God is looking for someone to this evening he is looking for a witness someone who can say me in my house I will serve the Lord if you don't have a house you say as for me and myself I will serve the Lord it doesn't matter what the devil throws in out there but I'm going to stand for the word amen with so much tempt ations coming in especially more so to the young people the devil tries to attack the young people cuz if he attacks the young people there is no church tomorrow we are done so that's why all his targets the enemy is coming in with full force coming from all different angles you have movies is the more you watch those movies they're conditioning your mind you start thinking crazy probably the first time you were watching a movie and you saw a man and a man kissing you like e but then you kept on seeing it every day day after day now you look at it just like oh yeah it's going to pass why the devil is conditioning you and you are used to it when you walk out and you go out you see men kissing or two women kissing it's normal to you cuz Satan has already conditioned your mind and he ping out them music that you are listening to each and every day that's how they change culture through music through movies and all that and you are not even paying attention whilst you are driving you're just listening to it it's not just making you excited but it's ministering to your spirit and it's changing your filter it's it's making holes in your filter things that you used to not like you start liking them things that you used to never things that you never um used to tolerate you start tolerating them places you never used to go to you start going to why because Satan is conditioning you he's trying destroy you cuz he knows if he destroys you they is not future amen for any continuity anything that's happening there is always a training for a Next Generation go to sports when uh those athletes they about to get to the and they start training the Next Generation because if they don't train the Next Generation then it's done there is no future amen and God always has a witness in each and every age in each and every age he has a witness amen and I'm looking at God's witness this afternoon Hallelujah just turn around to your neighbor and say I am God's witness of lodia Amen the prophet God says you have also a choice whether you choose this church you can choose whether you in this church whether you will choose a church that will guide you to your Eternal destination you can choose a church that has a certain Creed that you might think that Creed is what you want or the other church has their Creed and then they is the word of God you have a choice you have to make the choice and say there is an unwritten law Among Us the law of choosing which is our our um subject this afternoon the law the UN written law Among Us of choice amen says you can choose a church where you want to go to the prophet of God says before you choose a church of where you want to go to you have to pray cuz that's where your soul is being fed amen you might buy you you you clothe your body with with expensive clothes and um you're feeded with a really good food but you don't care what's coming in your soul before you do anything you have to make sure that whatever is feeding your soul is the unadulterated pure word of God that is coming into your heart amen so I thank God for our pastors cuz God says I will give you Shepherds after mine own heart amen and we thank God for our pastor always preaching the true unadulterated word of God Amen and I will stand here I remember the first time I came here um I sat in brother Brooks's office and he was he were just getting to know each other and getting acquain he says brother me I just preach the word and he says I just preach what the prophet preached and he said that I preach the prophet so when he say that I said I was in a good place I knew I wasn't lost that's when I made my decision and I said I will stay in this church cuz many people nowadays in different churches they will say oh yeah the prophet say this but um well that was you know that's that was whatever I'll go with this and people say yeah I know why the prophet says I know why the word of God says but my pastor says this your pastor is supposed to follow the prophet what the prophet says because remember God reveals the will of any age to one man that's right it's a onean Ministry and when he reveals that word to one man which is the prophet of a dispensation then each and every one of us are called to participate in God's will amen so whatever Church you are going to wherever you are make sure that you are listen listening to the unadulterated word of God Amen when you come to church that's where God speak you from this Pulpit life is preached or death can also be preached from the pulpit every time you pray and you say Lord please speak to me and then you come to church God will speak to you from the pulpit have you ever come from home and you say Lord I don't understand this and then you come you didn't have a conversation with the preacher for that day and then he goes right into your life what is happening God is speaking to you God is answering your prayer amen so make sure when you before you you go to church you say Lord speak to me Lord answer my prayer and every time you come to church you are comparing your life with the mirror of the word of the Lord if there's anything that's a miss you recalibrate yourself so that you can fit exactly in the word because remember we are being built into the St of a perfect man we are not perfect but we keep on coming because he gave us a promise that he will make us perfect we are not perfect in our own accord but we are perfect in him so we start out with faith you don't have enough faith for the for the healing of a of of a headache but you keep on praying you keep on coming to church every day you keep on listening to that word then you start seeing yourself getting victory victory after Victory why you're being built into the stat of a perfect man then you see yourself climbing up that ladder you find yourself you have virtue you get to knowledge Temperance patience all the way to the Holy Ghost where you are why because that's where the word is being preached into your life amen so we thank God for free moral agency amen and the choice that he gave us and remember your flesh will never choose the word of God that beastly nature will never want things of the word it always wants to go right against it so before you can choose you have to choose by Faith remember faith is a revelation a revelation of the word so before you make any choice you got to pray Lord I'm about to make this decision please guide me remember that scripture that says consider the Lord in all your ways not some of your ways but consider the Lord in all your ways whatever decision you're about to make consider the Lord and when you consider him in all your ways he will direct your paths wherever you go before you make any decision you say Lord please guide me in today decisions I have to make at school decisions I have to make at work please guide me and he will direct your paths and that's a choice you have to make you don't have to consider him if you don't want to because remember you have free moral agency amen Deuteronomy 30 says I call Heaven and Earth to record this day against you that I have set before you life and death blessing and cursing those are choices life and death blessing and cursing but then he comes and he say tells you therefore choose life that both you and thy seed may live amen so you have a choice of life and there's a choice of death there's a choice of a blessing and the choice of a cursing but whatever choice you have that is the consequence of it the choice that you make can lead you to have eternal life choosing to serve the Lord will give you eternal life choosing to reject it that's choosing death that's choosing a curse to your life amen so choose life that both you and thy seed might leave and remember wherever you are seated right now you are a product of the decisions you made the prophet of God says you are today what you are because several years ago you chose to be what you are now what you choose now will determine what you will be 5 years from today so right now where you are you are because of the choice you made five years ago and he says 5 years from today you may be a missionary 5 years from today you may be a renowned Christian or 5 years from today you may be in hell because you made the wrong decision 5 Years From today you may be cleaning spits in a barroom 5 years from today you may be a prostitute on the streets and he is preaching in his church he says or you may be a man or a woman that's a credit to any society because of your choice for Christ 5 years from today you may be in glory going in the Rapture because of the choice you made today amen amen so God is a gentleman he allows you to make whatever choice you make but remember whatever choice you going to make where you are seated right now 5 years from now that's where you will be if you decided whilst you were going to school and you say I don't want to I don't want to finish this no more you leave 5 years from then on you will still remain ungraduated because of the decision you made so whatever decision you make is going to compound and give you the result of where you were going to and he says the word God says and God gives you a choice says choose you this day who you will serve in the Garden of Eden there was a tree of knowledge and a tree of life man was given the privilege to choose either one he desired and so is it today you were given Your Privilege as free moral agents to choose whatever you want to choose he says my advice to you advice is a choice you don't have to take it if you don't want to if someone comes to you and say hey I want to give you advice you like yeah sure then they tell you but as soon as they tell you you can walk and say yeah I have a choice to take your advice or to leave it is that right but here the prophet of God saying my advice to you don't look at the Modern things around you and remember when the prophet is is advising you you have to take it because he is seeing he is a Seer a Seer sits on a higher place than each and every one of us so he sees what's coming and you don't but you still have that choice to take it there's a lot of things we are talking to people they say yeah those was those was his thoughts you know you can do whatever you want that's up to you that's a choice you have to make but I know Faith looks at the word faith looks at What God Says and remember the prophet of God is a mouthpiece to you and me amen he says my advice to you is don't look at the mod things around you and the popularity and the glamour that you could be but choose rather by faith him that give the promise that someday he will come and will Wren all the wrongs amen and you got to choose don't look at what you see because remember your eyes never rely on them you rely your eyes are part of your flesh they will choose something that's contrary to the word of God he says choose what you see by faith not by your eyes that's the only only thing that will count is what you choose by faith lot as he he had to make a choice Abraham gave lot a choice their her men were having issues and Abraham said Lord listen we have to we have to part ways but you make a choice where do you want to go wherever you go I'm not go I'll go the opposite direction and he let him make the choice and remember the promise and the call was on Abraham and not on lot Abraham was always waiting on thus says the Lord that's the same thing that the Sons and Daughters of Abraham do you wait on thus says the Lord you wait on what the Lord says you should do and what did lot do he chose using his eyes he saw Sodom and gomorah the pastures were green they had a good life and he said that's where I'm going but what did his choice leading to he didn't know that his choice was going to lead to his wife turning into a pillar of salt he didn't see that he was just looking at what was right in front of him but if he had prayed God was probably going to show him something different Abraham was not choosing that he was standing on thus says the Lord and he stayed on the land God promised him and when you stand on that says the Lord God will give you the promises that he promised you Lord didn't know that he is going to end up fathering his daughter's children he did that and went by sight because he was not following the word but the prophet of God says choose what you see by faith and that's the only thing that count not what you see by your own eyes Amen in um Matthew chapter 7 verse 7 the bible says ask and it shall be given to you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be open to you for everyone that seeketh asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be open and it says oh what man is there of you whom if his son ask for bread he will give him a stone or if he ask a fish he will give him a serpent if ye be then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him remember God gives you the desires of your heart he says ask what you shall want and he will give it to you even if it's not his perfect he will give it to you he will allow you his permissive will cuz remember he gave a choice and he's a go God who keeps his promise is here the prophet of God says but he will give you the desire of his your heart he promised that you know that he promised to give you the desire of your heart and let your desire be the word of God let your desire be his will I've always read uh this scripture that um he gives you he gives me the desires of my heart and the way I've always seen it is he gives me what my heart wants but he gives you the desires of your heart which means he gives your heart what to desire that's why you have to surrender your will to him so he gives your heart what to desire and then he gives you what you are Desiring amen that's what it that's what it ought to be let your will be done not mine so you are allowing God to pour His desire is into your heart cuz when you are pursuing God's desire you are pursuing a greater purpose in his will remember when Hannah was praying she was praying for a baby boy to her she thought she was just praying for her heart's desires but she didn't know God was using her as a channel to bring an answer to the whole nation so in her small mind she was just receiving a baby boy but in God's Grand scheme of things she was praying for the prophet Samuel whom God was going to give to him so when you pray you say Lord give me what to desire because you know what I need and you are the one who has my use Emmanuel remember he says in his word I know the thoughts that I have for you thoughts for you to prosper not thoughts for you to suffer so let your desire be the word of God let your desire be his will never your own will his will you ask him for something you don't give it to you you say Thank You Lord you know what's good if your son or if your child goes to their parents and say hey can you buy me a gun are you going to are they going to buy him no you're not going to give it to them why because they're going to hurt themselves or they're going to shoot somebody with that gun but to them is saying my parents don't want me to get a gun but the parents know what's better so when God does not give you some things that you saying you want you got to thank him because he knows why He's not giving you so instead of shouting and praising God only for the open doors you got to thank him for the closed doors as well because you Lord you knew that if I was going to go into this door I wouldn't be where I am today and some doors are trap doors you get in thinking it's an opportunity but you don't know what's laying behind so that's why you got to keep yourself consecrated sensitive to what God is telling you because his will is what's best for you it might not be good to you but it's good for you he created you he knows exactly what you want we all know of him Hezekiah Hezekiah his time had come to an end and God sent the prophet to Hezekiah and say go tell him to put his house in order because he is done his time has come to an end he's about to die and as soon as the prophet delivered the word to King Hezekiah he turned around and started leaving immediately Hezekiah knelled down and started praying he said Lord you know I've been so good to you please give me more time to live I just need more time and God because he is a just God remember if you ask what you desire he is going to give it to you even if it's not your his perfect will and remember he will give it to you even if it's his permissive will in God's perfect will Hezekiah was supposed to die his time on Earth was done but because he was stubborn he thought he knew better what was good for him he knelled down and he pray says Lord you know how I've been good to you how I've lived a holy life and clean life for you please give me more time and whilst the prophet was walking out God sent the prophet go back tell Hezekiah I've given him more time then the prophet he's just a mouthpiece he doesn't know what's going on he turns around he goes and tells Hezekiah God has had your prayer he has added 15 more years to your life but what happened that was not God's perfect will it was God's permissive will in those 15 years he undid all the good that he had done and he ended up dying a sinner the prophet of God here says Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and wept bitterly and said Lord God I ask you to consider me I've walked before you with a perfect heart I want you to let me live 15 years longer all right God spoke to the prophet said go back and tell him I heard him and what did he do he brought his grace upon the whole nation he kindled the anger of God until he would have killed him that's right you know that backs sad on God it would have been far better on off the nation for the king and all if he had went on and took God's first thing to him he should have died when God wanted him to die so you don't know what's better for you more than God is God knows so when you are praying many times we pray we're just so stubborn Lord I want this just give it to me that's what I want but when you mature in Christ and you know that you are supposed to pray for God's will you said Lord if this is your will for me to have this please may I have it and if it is if it is in his will he will give it to you if it's not he won't give it to you you pray people pray and say I want this I want that materialistic things sometimes God does not give it to you because he knows that the moment he gives it to you you stop serving him you stop coming to church and you are a Gunner and remember he said all that you you have given to me I have lost none of them so he knows what to give you to keep you and he knows that if I give this person that thing they are gone and remember the Bible always uses and calls us sheep in the Bible sheep are meant to be L sheep don't have a will of their own amen so they follow the shepherd so when the Bible calls you and me sheep it means the shepherd and we have the only one and great Shepherd Jesus Christ so sheep don't follow their own will you can compare goats and sheep a goat will run all over the place when you're trying to kill a goat you have to tie it up because it's not going to die it will run away but if you try to do the same thing to a sheep it's just going to stand right there it does not have a will of its own you and me as sheep the Lord our God is our Shepherd we are supposed to look for each and every time for his choice in our lives before you do anything you say Lord I'm your ship oh thou great Shepherd guide me to where I'm supposed to go give me that which I'm supposed to have because his will is what's best for you the prophet God says it's best to have God's will that's what he taught us thy will be done thy kingdom come thy will be done we must submit ourselves to his will and his word don't question it believe it don't try to find a way around it just take it the way it is Hezekiah tried to find a way around thus says the Lord and look at where it ended him he ended up dying a sinner so many want to go around get some other way and when you do you find yourself going on you find God blessing you but you are working his permissive will you think that God is blessing you you think that's an approval from God he is blessing you because it's his permissive will the only true test there is is the word test are you aligning with the word of God are you in God's will he says you are working in his permissive will and not in his perfect Divine will amen so we have to make sure that we are always in God's Will and when you are praying you say Lord answer my prayer according to your will in this next quote the prophet of God says do you know what 86% of conversions to Jesus Christ is done before 21 years old it shows its statistics 86% that come to Christ come before they 21 how many are under 21 no you're not how many are under 21 how many are over 21 those who were over 21 God delivered you and he says after you pass that age you become more molded or set in your ways oh it's possible sure they come 70 80 years years old but it's very rare it's possible people can convert when they are 7 years old but it's rare so don't let Satan start telling you that it's you are too young to serve the Lord or you are too young enjoy life first then after you enjoy life then you can give your heart to God whilst you are enjoying your life you're going to get set in those ways and once you get past 21 it's hard for you to get back you cannot so so whilst today is today and tomorrow is not promised give your heart to him and serve him all the best you can cuz who told you what if whilst you are still enjoying you pass the line of judgment and mercy and there's a you get to a point of no return He says you make yourself when you are young you said Ambitions to what you want to do and what you are trying to achieve in life you make yourself when you were young the decision that you make today is what you are going to be many years later from now so that's why when you are making that choice you have to make sure that God is leading you look at the Rich Young Ruler God gave him a choice come follow me then he decides like yeah no I'm not going to sell my riches I'll I'll stay like this and Jesus looked at him and he he loved him because he was he was a good man he followed the word to the tea but then he refused God's choice Jesus choice for him and he says I don't want that choice I want this choice for myself and luk many years later where was he he was in the pit of Hell because he did not follow Jesus Choice God's Preferred Choice for him says you set Ambitions to what you want to do and what you're trying to achieve in life life even Ambitions you have career-wise you make the choice that you make right now that's where you are going you think of it and as you think of course your mind it's presented into your mind by an unknown something that dominates your mind and then when it becomes in your mind you speak it that you're going to do it and then your Ambitions drive you to it it doesn't mean that if if you are a Christian you have to be unambitious it's okay to be ambitious so long you put your priorities right remember the Bible says seek ye first the kingdom of God and everything else will be added to you so it's okay to be ambitious it's okay to want to have a good career it's okay to want to make a lot of money so long that you are not putting that money in front of God Amen you have to put God first in each and everything and then he will lead you into whatever that will follow and whatever he wants and God chose you before the foundation of the world he made a choice and he predestinated you to say this is my son this is my daughter you are seated there right now where you are because God predestinated you you probably didn't know how you were going to make it to where you are but because of his predestination it is holding you where you are right now your very existence on on this Earth was predestination I'll read this quote here the prophet of God here says remember what I said the other day at breakfast uh in the pollen of breeding male and female these million germs come forth million eggs go forth but there's only one of them leave and yet they are everyone just just alike one out of a million you were one out of a million but God chose you why he picked you and he said this is my son and he said this is my daughter it's not because you were any special but because he chose you so your life is not in you are not in control of your life God is in control of your life amen so when you need an answer to anything go to the one who chose you you say Lord you know what you brought me on this Earth for you know what my will is it says every one of them the same egg the same kind of germ one of them lives and the rest of them die no one can tell which is the one that's ripe egg what about it God has to decide that whether it's going to be a boy or a girl blond a brunette or whatever is going to be God decides that not the not that is going to be the first one but the first one that God has to decide so God decided you and he chose you that you are going to be on this Earth at this time to fulfill his will amen and when he puts you on an earth he puts you on the earth for this specific time he wants you to participate in his will remember the word of God the whole Bible is the word of God but but the will of God is the word of God for your day amen go into an ark is the word of God but going to a physical Ark today is not the will of God if you go build and I can you go then you'll be destroyed because that's not the will of God for today and God sends a profit in each and every dispensation to pick the will of God and reveal it to the people so that you and I we can participate in that will what God has intended for us and since he is the great Shepherd we say Lord lead us into your will reveal that word to us and then when it's revealed to you you live it remember Revelation says the bride has made herself ready ready with what ready with the word what word the word that was revealed in that day amen remember God will do nothing but reveal his secrets to His prophets and his secrets are his thoughts and he says his thoughts are good for you amen so when the prophets reveals the secrets of the thoughts of God he's there revealing what God wants you to do amen so everyone who is called under any age or any dispensation they have to follow the prophet or follow the word for their day that's the will of God for your day amen he says um okay I'll skip that one um I'm going to wind down and come to an end so each and every choice that you make it has a replication each and every choice that you make it has a consequence you just don't go around and do stuff and don't have any consequences to to that Moses made a choice when he looked outside the window he saw slaves but he saw beyond that and he saw children of God that had a promise when Pharaoh looked out this very same window he saw slaves that were working but because Moses was a prophet he was given a different eyesight remember your point of view is determined by where you are seated and where you are seated that's how you see so if you are seated higher you are going to see further that's why you have to trust in God you see to the corner God sees behind the corner you see just till today God sees tomorrow so that's why when he is choosing a will for you when he is choosing for you you take his choice not yours because you are not seeing what's coming your way amen when Jesus was walking with the disciples he told them he says oh Lazarus is sleeping and they says oh if he's sleeping then he's going to wake up but he realized no no no they don't understand what they talking about what what what he meant why because they were seated in a different place Jesus was SE on a higher place he was seeing that death as sleeping but the disciples they would see it as death then he had to explain and say no he is dead that's was like oh he is dead then let us go right now but he said no let us keep on going why he was seeing differently he was seeing tomorrow he was seeing Lazarus resurrecting so Jesus sees further than you do remember but when you are a Christian and you take his will for you then you Paul says we are seated in heaven places and you can see what the word wants for you Moses saw children of God he saw people who were supposed to claim and take all the promises and the choice that he made he could have made a choice to be called the son of pharaoh but he says no I'm I'll be identified with the slaves cuz he was seeing further and because of the decision he he made 800 years later he was seen on Mount Transfiguration because of the choice he made if he hadn't made that choice he was just going to be dead and gone and we'll look at one more example William brandham made a choice to he to God's call and because of the choice that he made the choice had a replication to it and we are all seated here because a man heeded to God's call and because he heed to God's call God said I'm going to give you a reward for taking my choice so when you take a choice God has a reward for you in this quote the prophet of God he speaks about this man who so um he started prophesying he says I had just got through speaking of a great powerful forceful statements that even the overseer one of the general overseers of the Assemblies of God stepped down to the platform from up in the balcony where he was sitting and says I don't believe brother brandham meant that he says I said I have to mean it sir it's thus says the Lord and then it was about the church in this age it was thus says the Lord about the church in this age and he was not taking it back and then this was the prophecy that this man got about the prophet William brandham he says and here all three Nots exactly say the same thing in French and here it was here is the way it reads because thou has chosen the Narrow Path the harder way thou has walked in your own choosing thou has speak the correct and precise decision he had a choice to reject it or take it but because he take it then God is telling him because you have chosen the Narrow Path the had way th will speak the correct and precise decision and it is my way God's way because of this momentous decision a huge portion of heaven will await thee what a glorious decision thou Hast made this is in itself is that which will give and make come to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine a huge portion of Heaven awaits thee because of the decision that he made and remember the scripture that says everyone who receives the prophet in the name of the Prophet receives the prophet's reward so if you have received the prophet in the name of the Prophet that reward is for you too amen a huge portion of Heaven awaits thee because of the choice that you made you have decided to follow this message you have decided to believe this message that people look at as absurd but you are not just going to believe it in vain God has a reward for you and that reward is for you to make it into the Rapture amen that's what your choice is going to lead you to remember you get to choose if you're going into to Eternity or if you are going into hell and the choice that you make will determine where you are going to be let us stand upon our feet God has given us that law of choice that each and every one of us has to make it is up to you to choose whatever you want but God has a preferred future for you all you have to do is take his choice for your life and say Lord not my will but let your will be done in my life that's what we ought to do as Christians and as a young person whatever choice you going to make whatever choice you are making that's what you're going to be in 5 years from now now but God sees you in a certain place that you don't know he wants you to serve him just serve him and say Lord I trust you that you are the great Shepherd who is taking me where I need to be let us bow our heads and pray raise your hand if you say Lord I want to take your choice say Lord I'm taking the Narrow Path I'm taking taking that hard way to follow you because I know you have a reward for [Music] me let us just sing this song before we pray I just want to be where you [Music] are dwelling daily in your

Jesus Christ's mighty name I pray want to [Music] be I just want to be I just want to be with [Music] you I can truly say that that was a masterpiece I really enjoyed and and most of all I I sat over there watching Everybody you're tired but you stayed and you gave your attention to the word that speaks volumes I am the Elder of the group but I'm still young and I I just want to commend men all of you you you're so beautiful to me because as he was saying when it comes to the young people every generation has to take the Cho torch and because of the decision that I made when I was a young person just as you are believe it or not but I I I got saved around 1819 and I have stayed with God I walked With God all my life since then never had the desire to turn back and it kept growing kept moving forward did I have trials did I have tests absolutely but once I got a taste of God there was nothing in all of my trials could turn me back so I I just want to encourage you God is getting ready to move with the young people I just believe that because it was the young people that took the took the land in Joshua's day and I just believe by the grace of God that something is happening not just here at higher ground but all over the place and for all of you to come together the way you the way you you're doing it tonight don't worry about I won't be too long I know you're really tired but I just wanted to give you uh how can I say it um just honor you uh young people don't get honored you you you get a lot of criticism but I see you I see the good that's in you and what God is going to do with you and I just want to say make the right choices that I don't think it could have been a better message today because even as an old man Hezekiah made the wrong choice that's why I try to tell people if the Lord should take me don't you come talking about praying and raising me up amen I get up with an attitude I I'm satisfied I know I'm saved I know I'm bride and so I just want to say say to the young people I've been there I've been where where you are through the battles of your flesh you know the hurtful things that go goes on between young people teenagers and all
