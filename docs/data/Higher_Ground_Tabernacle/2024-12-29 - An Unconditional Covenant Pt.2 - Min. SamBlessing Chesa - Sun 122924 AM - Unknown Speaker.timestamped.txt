[1:19] the amen the mercy of God and how the
[1:23] Lord just watches over us and you know I
[1:26] don't know if you remember brother
[1:28] Brandon giving the little story story
[1:31] about about that brother that was not a
[1:34] very good
[1:35] Hunter and uh but he needed the food so
[1:38] brother and him went hunting together
[1:41] and uh he wasn't a good Hunter so he
[1:43] didn't expect to get
[1:45] much but uh throughout the day he got us
[1:49] fill of whatever squirrels or whatever
[1:51] and he was walking home with his
[1:52] squirrels and he was crying and smiling
[1:56] and praising God because he was a bad
[1:59] Hunter but God gave him what he needed
[2:02] amen was able to so I felt like that
[2:06] this a this this
[2:08] weekend I um I'm not a car mechanic but
[2:12] sometimes I try and I get over my uh uh
[2:16] I do things that I probably couldn't do
[2:19] as a mechanic and I had my whole
[2:22] thinking I'm a mechanic I go on YouTube
[2:24] and I take apart my whole bumper on my
[2:27] car because I need to change the lights
[2:32] and uh of course you're following a guy
[2:35] on YouTube that kind of knows a little
[2:37] bit more than you but not that much more
[2:38] than you and I get this thing off and
[2:42] when I get this bumper off a bunch of
[2:44] pieces fall out and I don't know where
[2:46] they go and so I'm I'm in a I'm in a
[2:50] pickle I don't know what to do so I I go
[2:52] and I change the lights like I wanted to
[2:54] but now I need to put the bumper back on
[2:57] and all these extra pieces that
[3:00] I I didn't know where they
[3:02] went and uh I just asked the Lord for a
[3:05] little help because I'm um I'm I'm one
[3:09] of those people that
[3:11] um if a if I have a round Peg and a
[3:15] square hole I'm G to make it
[3:17] fit so putting this thing gently in
[3:20] there is not my strong point amen but uh
[3:24] I picked that up and I just put the
[3:27] bumper right up against it and hit that
[3:29] side hit that side and it all went
[3:34] in I my my wife was says someone was
[3:37] helping you because there's no way she
[3:39] knows me enough there's no way you could
[3:41] have done that and the extra pieces I
[3:44] just happened to look into YouTube and
[3:46] all of a sudden the guy has that piece
[3:48] in his hand he says it goes right here
[3:50] and I'm like well there you go I just
[3:52] put it there ended up I used everything
[3:56] that came out went back in I'm like
[3:58] praise God and I knew like that Hunter
[4:00] I'm not a mechanic and I knew the Lord
[4:03] was was was there so I just want to
[4:05] thank the Lord for that
[4:07] amen amen uh he's he's uh he's uh he's
[4:13] merciful and he's uh he didn't have to
[4:16] bless me amen but he he does and I just
[4:18] thank the Lord for that the other thing
[4:20] I was I was with brother Keith on last
[4:23] Monday I was with brother Keith we were
[4:26] talking just having Fellowship in the
[4:27] morning and and and uh I get we both get
[4:32] in our cars to leave and I back out
[4:35] behind brother
[4:36] Keith and I looked and there was no car
[4:39] so I backed out and all of a sudden when
[4:40] I backed out this car just went zooms
[4:44] right behind me and I almost hit it it
[4:46] was by the grace of God I didn't hit it
[4:49] and then brother Keith starts backing up
[4:51] while I'm still behind him because he
[4:53] thought that was me that left it was
[4:55] that car he starts backing up and all of
[4:59] a sudden
[5:00] I didn't know what to do he's heading
[5:03] towards my car my bumper he's heading
[5:06] towards my car and I'm like I didn't
[5:08] know to go forward go backwards I didn't
[5:10] know what to do and all of a sudden the
[5:12] Holy Spirit must have spoke to brother
[5:14] Keith and he Slams on the break because
[5:16] usually his his little he has a new
[5:20] enough car where it beeps when there's
[5:22] something you know in the back there
[5:24] that's that you're going to hit usually
[5:25] gives you a little beeping it didn't
[5:27] give him any beeping the Holy Spirit was
[5:29] his beeper and he just pressed on that
[5:31] break and we I don't know how close we
[5:33] were but he unrolls his window and I'm

[50:40] and shake your their
[50:45] hand say are you happy to be in the
[50:46] house of the
[50:49] Lord
[50:51] amen let us open our Bibles to the Book
[50:53] of Genesis chapter
[50:55] 17 want be
[50:58] verse 1
[51:00] [Music]
[51:01] and9 the Bible
[51:04] reads and when Abraham was 90 years old
[51:07] and nine the Lord appeared to Abraham
[51:10] and said unto him I'm the old Mighty God
[51:13] walk before me and be thou
[51:22] perfect and I will make my Covenant
[51:25] between me and thee and will multiply
[51:28] thee
[51:32] exceedingly and Abram fell on his face
[51:35] and God talked with him saying as for me
[51:38] behold my Covenant is with thee and thou
[51:42] sh be a father of many
[51:51] nations neither shall thy name anymore
[51:54] be called Abraham but thy name name
[51:56] shall be Abraham for a father of many
[51:59] nations I have made
[52:06] thee and I will make thee exceeding
[52:09] fruitful and I will make nations of thee
[52:12] and Kings shall come out of
[52:19] thee and I will establish my Covenant
[52:22] between me and thee and thy seed after
[52:25] thee in their Generations for an
[52:27] Everlasting Covenant to be a god unto
[52:30] thee and to thy seed after
[52:42] thee and I will give unto thee and to
[52:45] thy seed after thee the land wherein
[52:47] thou art a stranger oh the land of
[52:50] Canaan for an everlasting possession and
[52:53] I will be their God
[53:04] and God said unto Abraham Thou shalt
[53:07] keep my Covenant therefore thou and thy
[53:10] seed after thee in their
[53:16] Generations may the Lord add blessings
[53:18] to reading of his word you might take
[53:21] those
[53:23] amen this morning we want to speak on a
[53:26] subject an unconditional
[53:31] Covenant that will be a part
[53:34] two we started part one
[53:37] um the past
[53:41] Wednesday Amen in the Bible that we
[53:45] read in the verse we read we see God
[53:47] coming to
[53:51] Abraham and he is saying I will make a
[53:53] covenant between me and you
[53:57] and I will multiply thee
[54:01] [Music]
[54:03] exceedingly and this Covenant he say
[54:05] this Covenant is not only between me and
[54:10] you but it is between you me and your
[54:14] seed that comes after
[54:17] you Hallelujah and the Covenant means a
[54:22] promise or it means a
[54:24] contract amen so God came down to give
[54:28] Abraham a
[54:30] covenant or we can say he came to give
[54:33] Abraham a
[54:36] contract that was saying it is for you
[54:39] and your
[54:41] seed and he said I Will Bless thee
[54:46] exceedingly when we look at
[54:49] Abraham Abraham did not ask for this
[54:54] Covenant he did not ask for this
[54:57] promise but God rich in
[55:01] Mercy he's the one who came to
[55:04] Abraham and he said I'm making this
[55:07] Covenant with
[55:08] you when we look where Abraham comes
[55:12] from Abraham was a
[55:15] heathen he worshiped
[55:18] Idols he was not morally a good
[55:23] person it's not because he did anything
[55:25] special
[55:27] but it was because of God's Amazing
[55:31] Grace he came and he predestinated
[55:35] him from the heathens from those Idol
[55:41] worshippers and he took him out and he
[55:44] say I'm making a covenant between you
[55:46] and
[55:48] me an Everlasting
[55:51] Covenant and throughout the whole
[55:54] Bible we see God made made a lot of
[55:57] covenants with the children of
[56:00] Israel but some of these covenants were
[56:04] conditional amen some of these
[56:07] conditions he
[56:09] said if you do
[56:11] this I will deliver you if you do that I
[56:17] will bless you but if you do not adher
[56:21] to what he
[56:23] said then you fulfill the Covenant
[56:30] then you f the
[56:33] blessing God promised the children of
[56:37] Israel he says I will take you out of
[56:39] the land of Egypt and I will take you
[56:40] into
[56:43] Canaan but whilst they were in
[56:47] Canaan they started murmuring and
[56:52] complaining and God says because you
[56:54] have murmured and complained
[56:56] [Music]
[56:58] you shall not see this
[57:00] promise you are not going into
[57:03] Canaan but your children
[57:06] will so they fulfilled the
[57:10] promise because it was a conditional
[57:14] Covenant so God
[57:16] saw that if I make a covenant with
[57:21] man that is
[57:24] 5050 that say I'll do this and you do
[57:28] that man has been proven all the
[57:32] time to fail their
[57:35] part and every time they fail their part
[57:39] they
[57:40] ful they fulfill the
[57:42] [Music]
[57:43] Covenant the Covenant is n
[57:47] effect but when it came to the Covenant
[57:49] of
[57:51] Abraham God said listen this Covenant
[57:55] has nothing to do with
[57:57] you this Covenant is all
[58:01] me because I know if I make you to take
[58:04] part in this
[58:06] Covenant you are going to mess it
[58:10] up so he said it is on me and the Bible
[58:14] says God swore by none greater but
[58:19] himself because he was the greatest
[58:21] there
[58:22] was and say I am making this Covenant
[58:25] with you
[58:27] so it does not matter what you
[58:29] do my Covenant will stand with
[58:32] you it doesn't matter how much you
[58:36] sin my Covenant will stand with
[58:39] you it does not matter what your
[58:41] children
[58:43] do but this Covenant that I'm giving you
[58:47] will
[58:48] stand because it is all on
[58:51] me Hallelujah and the prophet of God
[58:55] talks about this Covenant and he says
[58:57] it's a Covenant of
[59:00] Grace so God came and gave a Grace
[59:03] Covenant to
[59:06] Abraham and he says no matter what you
[59:10] do my grace is sufficient for
[59:15] you Hallelujah it doesn't matter how far
[59:18] gone you
[59:20] are my grace is enough to come and
[59:22] redeem
[59:24] you and my Mercy is enough for
[59:28] you that's why we sing your grace and
[59:32] mercy brought me through if it wasn't
[59:36] for
[59:36] Grace where would you be if it wasn't
[59:40] for God's
[59:41] mercy where would you be so God came and
[59:46] he gave
[59:48] Abraham a Grace
[59:50] Covenant but whilst they were still in
[59:52] the Old
[59:54] Testament they slew a
[59:58] [Music]
[59:59] beast and that was and that was part of
[1:00:02] the
[1:00:04] Covenant amen you see in the days of
[1:00:08] Abraham they were in a polytheistic
[1:00:14] religion where the people worshiped many
[1:00:18] gods they worshiped the sun
[1:00:21] god they worshiped the moon
[1:00:24] God they worshiped
[1:00:26] nature they worship their
[1:00:29] Idols so when you come and you say
[1:00:33] God we know God means an object of
[1:00:37] worship so they were worshiping
[1:00:39] everything and
[1:00:43] anything so when you said God God meant
[1:00:49] anything
[1:00:50] everything but God wanted to make
[1:00:53] himself known
[1:00:56] that's why he came and he called Abraham
[1:00:59] out and that's why he said I'm making a
[1:01:02] covenant with
[1:01:04] you so he could attach his name on
[1:01:08] Abraham and he SE that came
[1:01:12] after in all throughout the
[1:01:14] Bible we hear the children of the
[1:01:17] children of Israel
[1:01:19] praying they say the god of Abraham
[1:01:22] Isaac and
[1:01:23] Jacob that was his ENT
[1:01:27] identification to separate him from all
[1:01:29] the other
[1:01:31] gods that's why he called him
[1:01:34] out and he performed exploits with
[1:01:38] Abraham so when people ask who is
[1:01:41] that say it is the god of Abraham it is
[1:01:45] not an idol it is not the sun it is not
[1:01:47] the
[1:01:48] Moon it is the god of
[1:01:51] Abraham and the prophet of God tells us
[1:01:54] that all the children of Israel the
[1:01:57] children of
[1:01:59] Abraham they walk the same Journey that
[1:02:01] their father Abraham
[1:02:04] walked Hallelujah so if I walk the same
[1:02:08] Journey that Abraham
[1:02:10] walked I know I have a covenant with God
[1:02:14] I know I have a Grace Covenant with God
[1:02:17] and the same way he put his name on
[1:02:20] Abraham my
[1:02:23] father he put his name on you
[1:02:27] so you can be
[1:02:29] identified as your
[1:02:32] God so he is
[1:02:35] identified as your God when people see
[1:02:39] you
[1:02:40] walking they say it is his
[1:02:43] God when they see you living right they
[1:02:47] say it is impossible for people to do
[1:02:51] this but they can do
[1:02:53] it because he worships
[1:02:57] he worships the god of
[1:02:59] Isaac he worships the god of
[1:03:03] Richard he worships the god of
[1:03:06] Frank amen he wants his
[1:03:10] name to be identified with
[1:03:13] you so you got to walk
[1:03:16] cognizant of the fact that you are just
[1:03:19] not an ordinary
[1:03:21] person but you have been
[1:03:24] predestinated and you are walking in
[1:03:26] God's
[1:03:27] covenant and when he gave them a
[1:03:30] covenant he also gave them a name
[1:03:35] Covenant he called himself
[1:03:38] Jehovah Jehovah means
[1:03:44] becoming
[1:03:45] becoming that's what Jehovah
[1:03:48] means becoming what becoming
[1:03:52] Blank That's the name he gave the
[1:03:54] children of Israel
[1:03:57] he says my name is
[1:04:00] becoming when uh Moses went to the
[1:04:03] burning
[1:04:05] bush he asked he says when I
[1:04:09] go who am I going to say sent
[1:04:12] me and he said you tell them I
[1:04:17] am when you ask me what's my
[1:04:20] name I'll tell you my name is Sam but he
[1:04:24] said my name is I am
[1:04:27] he's waiting I am who I am that I
[1:04:31] am what was that for I am whoever you
[1:04:35] want me to become to
[1:04:37] you Hallelujah whatever you need him to
[1:04:41] be he is I am to you not I was but I am
[1:04:48] because he is the same yesterday today
[1:04:50] and
[1:04:51] forever that's why he gave them the name
[1:04:53] Jehovah
[1:04:56] Jehovah F in the
[1:04:57] blank when they needed
[1:04:59] Providence he says I'm Jehovah J I am
[1:05:04] your
[1:05:05] provider Hallelujah when Abraham was
[1:05:08] about to sacrifice
[1:05:11] Isaac he said I am your
[1:05:14] provider and he provided a lamb when the
[1:05:18] children of Israel were sick they called
[1:05:21] on Jehovah
[1:05:22] Rafa he says I am your healer
[1:05:26] when they were getting into
[1:05:28] battle he says I am your
[1:05:31] banner Jehovah sh so he gave them a
[1:05:35] covenant
[1:05:37] name and because he gave them a covenant
[1:05:41] name God never ever breaks his
[1:05:45] Covenant he always comes through when
[1:05:47] you need
[1:05:49] him and he is always right on
[1:05:52] time and his children that he attached
[1:05:55] his name
[1:05:57] to throughout the
[1:06:00] Bible he does not call them
[1:06:03] ordinary but he uses special
[1:06:06] words like
[1:06:09] chosen he says you are
[1:06:11] called a chosen
[1:06:14] generation you are a peculiar
[1:06:17] people hallelujah pecul does not mean
[1:06:20] you are special than other
[1:06:23] people but it means when you go through
[1:06:27] things you don't go through them like
[1:06:31] them because you are
[1:06:33] peculiar you are special and when
[1:06:36] special
[1:06:38] people God's peculiar
[1:06:41] people when they call on the name of the
[1:06:44] Lord he always going to come
[1:06:46] down
[1:06:48] Hallelujah God will suspend
[1:06:52] nature for his own people when God
[1:06:56] created the Earth he says let there be
[1:06:59] light he put the solar system in
[1:07:02] place and he put all the seasons in
[1:07:05] place that's a process he put to
[1:07:09] nature but when it comes to his
[1:07:12] people God will
[1:07:14] make things
[1:07:17] different he can suspend
[1:07:19] nature he can stop the normal flow of
[1:07:22] things
[1:07:25] he can change processes of
[1:07:28] things for his peculiar people why
[1:07:32] because he has a covenant between you
[1:07:34] and
[1:07:35] me Hallelujah because he calls them his
[1:07:40] own when the children of Israel were
[1:07:42] coming out of
[1:07:44] Egypt they were faced with a red
[1:07:48] sea we know that water cannot
[1:07:52] separate you cannot put water next to
[1:07:55] water and you can draw a
[1:08:00] line that's that's a rule that God
[1:08:04] put that's a nature that God put
[1:08:08] wherever water is it has to
[1:08:11] mix but when the children of
[1:08:15] Israel was standing between a rock and a
[1:08:18] hard
[1:08:19] place God said I'm suspending
[1:08:22] nature he made a way between water
[1:08:28] there was water here and water here but
[1:08:31] the water could not mix he had to stop
[1:08:36] nature to deliver his
[1:08:38] children Hallelujah why because it was a
[1:08:42] covenant
[1:08:45] people we look at
[1:08:48] Joshua God put in a
[1:08:51] nature he put a
[1:08:53] process that the son come comes back
[1:08:55] around after 24
[1:08:59] hours and when the sun says the moon
[1:09:02] comes
[1:09:03] out that's nature that God put when you
[1:09:07] say let there be
[1:09:09] light that's how he said it but when the
[1:09:13] children of Israel were
[1:09:15] fighting and Joshua was standing right
[1:09:19] there and he saw that they were losing
[1:09:21] the
[1:09:23] battle he stood
[1:09:26] and he decided to Define
[1:09:28] nature but because he was a son of the
[1:09:32] Covenant God had to respect his
[1:09:35] word and he stood there and he say sun
[1:09:39] stand
[1:09:41] still and for 24 hours the sun Stood
[1:09:45] Still in that place there was no
[1:09:48] Sunset while God was suspending
[1:09:52] nature for his Covenant children
[1:09:56] Hallelujah so if God could suspend
[1:09:59] nature for
[1:10:01] Joshua he can suspend nature for you
[1:10:05] too Hallelujah he can perform a miracle
[1:10:07] in your
[1:10:09] life amen amen glory we know the three
[1:10:13] Hebrew
[1:10:15] boys we know fire is supposed to be
[1:10:20] hot but when the children of
[1:10:23] God the children of Covenant
[1:10:26] they were about to get into that
[1:10:30] fire god separated the heat from the
[1:10:33] fire and that fire did not burn
[1:10:36] them it burned their
[1:10:39] tormentors and it burnt the chains that
[1:10:42] were binding
[1:10:44] them Hallelujah God will suspend nature
[1:10:47] for
[1:10:49] you they will tell you that cancer
[1:10:51] cannot be
[1:10:53] healed because that's what they think
[1:10:56] nature
[1:10:57] is but God can't suspend nature for
[1:11:01] you and he can deliver and he can heal
[1:11:04] [Music]
[1:11:05] you nature says an old woman cannot give
[1:11:11] birth but with Sarah God suspended
[1:11:15] nature she was
[1:11:18] Barren and she was old she had two
[1:11:21] things working against her
[1:11:25] suspended the natural flow of
[1:11:28] things because you are in a
[1:11:31] covenant you are going to give
[1:11:34] birth and Paul tells us that everything
[1:11:38] that's in the scripture in the Old
[1:11:40] Testament is for us as an
[1:11:44] example Hallelujah an example is for you
[1:11:47] to see that if God did it
[1:11:50] before he can do it again if he open the
[1:11:54] red
[1:11:56] se he can open my Red
[1:11:59] Sea you don't have to go around looking
[1:12:02] for Lakes to
[1:12:03] open but you know the Red Sea that you
[1:12:05] were going
[1:12:07] through and he can open that Red
[1:12:10] Sea you can say I'm not looking for a
[1:12:13] baby but your dead
[1:12:16] situation God can bring life to
[1:12:21] it because he can suspend nature
[1:12:25] you can say I'm not qualified for that
[1:12:28] job because they'll tell you we need 10
[1:12:30] years
[1:12:31] experience Hallelujah cuz that's the
[1:12:34] nature of things for you to qualify for
[1:12:37] a job you need to have enough expertise
[1:12:39] for that
[1:12:42] job but I serve a God who can suspend
[1:12:45] the natural flow of
[1:12:48] things you can be hired for a job that
[1:12:50] you are unqualified for
[1:12:55] because you are a covenant
[1:12:57] child amen he keeps his
[1:13:01] Covenant he does not
[1:13:03] fail Galatians chapter 3 and verse
[1:13:07] 6 the Bible says even as Abraham
[1:13:10] believed God and it was accounted to him
[1:13:14] for
[1:13:15] righteousness Galatians chapter 3 and
[1:13:17] verse 6 G
[1:13:25] therefore that they which are of Faith
[1:13:28] the same are the children of
[1:13:34] Abraham and the scripture foreseeing
[1:13:36] that God would justify the Heathen
[1:13:38] through faith preached therefore the
[1:13:41] gospel to Abraham saying in thee shall
[1:13:43] All Nations be
[1:13:52] blessed going back to verse seven he
[1:13:55] says they which are the of
[1:13:59] Faith the same are the children of
[1:14:05] Abraham if you are of
[1:14:08] Faith you believe in
[1:14:11] God you are a child of
[1:14:15] Abraham don't let Satan tell you nothing
[1:14:19] else so every
[1:14:22] promise every Covenant that God gave to
[1:14:27] if you are in the
[1:14:29] faith it applies to you when he says I
[1:14:33] shall bless thee
[1:14:36] exceedingly you push your name
[1:14:39] there because you are Abraham's
[1:14:42] seed through faith when he says thy seed
[1:14:46] shall possess the gates of the
[1:14:50] enemy through faith you believe and put
[1:14:54] your name right
[1:14:56] there because that
[1:14:58] Covenant and that promise applies to
[1:15:02] you amen amen in Abraham's Grace
[1:15:06] Covenant the prophet of God say his
[1:15:08] paragraph
[1:15:11] 39 and Abraham never received this
[1:15:14] promise whilst he was in whilst he was
[1:15:17] in circumcision under the
[1:15:23] law but when he was under
[1:15:28] grace before
[1:15:30] circumcision ever was
[1:15:37] issued therefore it's not it's not
[1:15:40] nothing that we could do to Merit it
[1:15:42] that's
[1:15:45] right it's God's grace that gives it to
[1:15:50] us by
[1:15:52] faith Abraham believed God
[1:15:56] and it was imputed to him for
[1:16:00] righteousness the law is what men wanted
[1:16:03] not what God
[1:16:06] wanted amen so Abraham received the
[1:16:10] promise way before he was even
[1:16:14] circumcised he received Grace way before
[1:16:17] he was even taken out of the child the
[1:16:22] ends so we see this is a work that
[1:16:25] happened before the foundation of the
[1:16:28] world you were predestinated for
[1:16:33] ordained Sanctified and
[1:16:36] Justified whilst you were on the back
[1:16:38] part of God's
[1:16:41] mind that's when God gave you that
[1:16:45] Grace so you just came to a
[1:16:49] realization that this is what God did
[1:16:52] for
[1:16:53] you but it already happened before you
[1:16:56] was
[1:16:58] born God told Jeremiah before you were
[1:17:01] born before you were formed in your
[1:17:04] mother's
[1:17:05] womb I knew you where was he he was on
[1:17:10] the back part of God's
[1:17:11] mind Hallelujah and that's when he got
[1:17:15] that
[1:17:16] Grace and it's nothing that you can do
[1:17:19] to Merit
[1:17:21] it but it's his Amazing Grace he gives
[1:17:24] to us
[1:17:26] by faith and like Father Abraham
[1:17:30] did you get it by believing
[1:17:34] God Amen Galatians 3 verse
[1:17:39] 16 the Bible says now to Abraham and his
[1:17:42] seed were the promises
[1:17:46] made he saith not and to seeds as of
[1:17:50] many but as for one and to thy seed
[1:17:53] which is Christ Hallelujah
[1:18:06] this is a covenant he made Abraham and
[1:18:10] the Paul is telling us that the seed he
[1:18:13] was talking
[1:18:15] about was not Ishmael or
[1:18:19] Isaac Isaac was just a
[1:18:22] shadow but this seed that was being
[1:18:24] promised
[1:18:27] which was the Covenant was to be made
[1:18:33] with was Jesus
[1:18:35] Christ and the verse 29
[1:18:39] says and if ye be in
[1:18:42] Christ then ye are then are ye Abraham's
[1:18:48] seed and airs according to the
[1:18:52] promise so you have been made abrah seed
[1:18:55] through the promise through
[1:19:01] Christ so the promise that God gave
[1:19:05] Abraham did not end with
[1:19:08] Abraham and it came through
[1:19:11] Christ that's how it came to
[1:19:13] you and how did this Covenant become
[1:19:19] Grace because in the Old Testament we
[1:19:21] read about
[1:19:23] law and we start seeing Grace in the New
[1:19:27] Testament but it's not that Grace wasn't
[1:19:30] already there in the Old
[1:19:32] Testament Grace was already there that's
[1:19:35] how Abraham was
[1:19:37] saved that's how he was
[1:19:42] predestinated so to enact this
[1:19:46] Covenant you know when you make a
[1:19:49] contract when you sign for your
[1:19:53] car when you sign for a
[1:19:56] lease they give you a
[1:19:59] contract and you have to sign that
[1:20:03] contract amen amen so that contract is
[1:20:07] you signing and the issuer of the
[1:20:09] contract is also signing
[1:20:13] it so God when he made a covenant with
[1:20:19] Abraham he he was the issuer of the
[1:20:22] contract
[1:20:26] and Abraham was the
[1:20:29] recipient so after God made a covenant
[1:20:31] with
[1:20:33] Abraham he told him to go make a
[1:20:37] sacrifice and Abraham went to make the
[1:20:42] sacrifice as an
[1:20:45] [Music]
[1:20:46] enactment signing the this
[1:20:51] contract which was the Covenant that God
[1:20:53] made with him
[1:20:56] and in the
[1:20:58] orientals back in the um in the ancient
[1:21:03] times when they were signing a
[1:21:06] contract or making a
[1:21:09] covenant they would slay they would slay
[1:21:12] an
[1:21:14] animal and they would skin
[1:21:17] it and after skinning that
[1:21:20] animal they will take the skin and tear
[1:21:23] it apart
[1:21:26] [Music]
[1:21:27] perly because when you cut it
[1:21:31] perfectly you can easily take another
[1:21:33] part of another animal and you can bring
[1:21:39] it but they just tore it
[1:21:42] naturally and however way it
[1:21:46] tore one will take the other
[1:21:49] [Music]
[1:21:51] piece and the other person would take
[1:21:53] the other piece
[1:21:56] and they would go their separate
[1:21:59] ways amen let's say if I tear this
[1:22:04] paper this was not
[1:22:06] perfect and the only piece that can come
[1:22:10] and fit in
[1:22:13] here is this
[1:22:15] piece no matter how many pieces you tear
[1:22:18] 200 pieces of
[1:22:22] paper there is no other piece that can
[1:22:24] can come to fit in
[1:22:27] perfectly you only have to take this
[1:22:30] piece and bring it into perfectly dve
[1:22:35] tail so when they were making a
[1:22:38] covenant they would tear skin animal
[1:22:43] skin one goes their way one goes the
[1:22:47] other if they happen to have a dispute
[1:22:51] dispute or when they need to bring back
[1:22:53] up the at effects of the Covenant they
[1:22:59] made even if the person who made the
[1:23:02] Covenant died and it's come down
[1:23:04] Generations
[1:23:09] after they would come
[1:23:12] together the other party bring that
[1:23:16] piece and the other party brings the
[1:23:18] other
[1:23:20] piece and they have to confirm it
[1:23:24] by putting the pieces
[1:23:27] together and if the two pieces do not
[1:23:31] match it means there was a discrepancy
[1:23:34] in the
[1:23:35] Covenant someone is trying to be
[1:23:39] fraudulent but when they Feit
[1:23:43] perfectly then they know that this is
[1:23:45] the exact
[1:23:48] person that the Covenant was made
[1:23:51] with amen amen and in Jehovah jar the
[1:23:55] prophet of God
[1:23:58] says now
[1:24:01] Jesus became that
[1:24:05] sacrifice the sacrifice that Abraham
[1:24:08] made was a shadow and a
[1:24:12] type because it was a Grace
[1:24:16] Covenant it was a shadow and the type of
[1:24:19] Christ the ultimate sacrifice
[1:24:25] and the enactment of the Grace Covenant
[1:24:27] in the New
[1:24:30] Testament was the death of Christ on the
[1:24:32] cross of
[1:24:34] Calvary so the prophet of God is saying
[1:24:37] now Jesus became that
[1:24:41] sacrifice and he went to
[1:24:45] Calvary and God tore him apart on
[1:24:49] Calvary he tore his Soul and Spirit from
[1:24:52] his body
[1:24:56] and he raised up his body on the third
[1:24:58] [Music]
[1:25:00] day amen so on the cross of
[1:25:06] Calvary when Jesus died and he said it
[1:25:08] is
[1:25:11] finished the prophet of God is telling
[1:25:13] us that was God tearing his son
[1:25:18] apart he separated the body from the
[1:25:21] soul and from the spirit
[1:25:25] while his body lay in the
[1:25:29] grave he was in
[1:25:31] Hell overcoming death hell and the grave
[1:25:34] and
[1:25:38] Satan he had been torn apart and the
[1:25:42] prophet of God says and he raised his
[1:25:45] body on the third
[1:25:48] day and set it on his right in his own
[1:25:51] right
[1:25:52] hand so when Christ
[1:25:56] ascended he went to sit on the right
[1:25:58] hand side of the
[1:26:02] father and we know the right hand means
[1:26:06] Authority so he went to sit on the
[1:26:08] throne of the father on and he had
[1:26:13] Authority that's one piece and he sent
[1:26:17] back the same spirit that was upon
[1:26:21] him to work in his church
[1:26:25] to call Abraham's
[1:26:28] seed so he tore apart Jesus on the cross
[1:26:31] of
[1:26:33] Calvary the body ascended to be on the
[1:26:35] right hand side of the
[1:26:38] father and he sent the spirit back to
[1:26:42] the
[1:26:43] church that was the Grace Covenant he
[1:26:46] was making with his
[1:26:48] people and he sent back the same spirit
[1:26:51] that was upon him to work in his church
[1:26:54] Church to call Abraham
[1:26:59] seed you see as the baptism of the Holy
[1:27:05] Ghost that's the confirmation confirming
[1:27:10] it amen so that was the Grace Covenant
[1:27:14] God was making with
[1:27:17] us when he tore apart his
[1:27:20] son he said I'm giving you the Holy
[1:27:22] Ghost
[1:27:24] and I'll take the
[1:27:26] body which went to sit on the father's
[1:27:28] right
[1:27:29] hand and he made that Covenant with you
[1:27:32] and
[1:27:33] me that is the reality of the Grace
[1:27:36] Covenant that he was having with
[1:27:42] Abraham Abraham
[1:27:44] seed that Grace is for you that no
[1:27:48] matter what you
[1:27:49] do my grace is sufficient for you
[1:27:53] Hallelujah huj whatever you have gone
[1:27:56] through he says I will still come for
[1:28:00] you
[1:28:01] amen and in Jehovah J paragraph
[1:28:07] 53 he says now the church that professes
[1:28:10] to be a Christian
[1:28:13] Church will have to have the same spirit
[1:28:17] that was in Jesus
[1:28:21] Christ for at the resurrection of the
[1:28:24] the
[1:28:26] church Christ and his bride will come
[1:28:31] together and dve
[1:28:33] tail they have to
[1:28:35] fit so on the Resurrection
[1:28:39] Day when Christ comes for his
[1:28:42] bride and the Holy Ghost does in the
[1:28:45] bride they have to
[1:28:48] match Hallelujah and it cannot be any
[1:28:52] other peace
[1:28:55] except for the exact same holy
[1:28:58] ghost that fell on the day of
[1:29:02] Pentecost that he gave to the first
[1:29:06] church and he
[1:29:08] says the Bri and it will come together
[1:29:10] and it has to dve
[1:29:13] tail the writings and the promises of
[1:29:16] God will be made fulfilled
[1:29:20] there so it cannot come together
[1:29:27] unless the same spirit that was in
[1:29:30] Christ is in you and
[1:29:33] me hey man if you can to have the next
[1:29:35] quote
[1:29:37] please the next part of 53 paragraph 53
[1:29:41] says so it cannot come
[1:29:47] together unless the same spirit that was
[1:29:49] in
[1:29:52] Christ is in you and
[1:29:54] me so whatever Spirit you
[1:29:58] have if it is not the holy ghost that is
[1:30:02] not going to match up with
[1:30:04] Christ because it has to be the exact
[1:30:10] same amen anything else will not
[1:30:13] work and he says and then if that same
[1:30:18] spirit is in there it will do the same
[1:30:22] works
[1:30:24] and live the same kind of separated
[1:30:28] life and do the works that he
[1:30:32] did Hallelujah that's why he said
[1:30:35] Greater Works than these shall you
[1:30:38] do why because you have the spirit of
[1:30:41] Christ in
[1:30:42] you Paul says it is not I that live but
[1:30:46] it's Christ who lives in me amen the
[1:30:50] prophet of God tells us that what was in
[1:30:53] God
[1:30:54] was poured into
[1:30:56] Christ and what was in Christ was poured
[1:31:00] into the church so the same spirit that
[1:31:03] was in
[1:31:04] God it was living in Christ and then on
[1:31:08] the day of
[1:31:10] Pentecost that same
[1:31:13] Spirit he poured it into the
[1:31:16] church and we know that church is not
[1:31:18] the
[1:31:19] building but church is a
[1:31:22] people church is a called out people and
[1:31:26] this morning I'm looking at God's
[1:31:28] church I'm looking at God's called
[1:31:31] out called out of
[1:31:34] denominations called out of the systems
[1:31:37] of this
[1:31:38] world and he chose you to put his name
[1:31:41] on
[1:31:42] you so he could put his spirit in
[1:31:47] you and he is the one who is doing the
[1:31:50] works in you
[1:31:53] so Greater
[1:31:55] Works that he is
[1:31:58] doing that you are doing it's not you
[1:32:01] who's doing it but it is him who's doing
[1:32:05] it in
[1:32:06] you Hallelujah when Peter was when Peter
[1:32:10] was um walking on the along the Gate of
[1:32:15] beauer they had been filled with the
[1:32:17] Holy
[1:32:18] Ghost they had gotten that other
[1:32:22] piece of that
[1:32:24] inside of
[1:32:25] them amen they saw that lame
[1:32:28] man and they
[1:32:31] said Silver and Gold Have I
[1:32:34] None but such as I have I give unto you
[1:32:39] and that lay Man's legs straightened
[1:32:42] up and he started
[1:32:45] walking Hallelujah why because they had
[1:32:49] that piece of the
[1:32:51] Covenant they had that part of Christ in
[1:32:54] them the same spirit that was in Christ
[1:32:57] had been in
[1:32:59] them Hallelujah in the resurrection of
[1:33:02] Jesus the prophet of God
[1:33:05] says now
[1:33:07] remember his Corporal body is the high
[1:33:12] priest that's sitting Before the Throne
[1:33:15] of
[1:33:17] God the Corporal body that Christ store
[1:33:20] on the cross of calvary
[1:33:25] and he took to have it on his right
[1:33:28] hand that's why the prophet is saying
[1:33:30] the Corporal body is the high priest
[1:33:32] that's setting Before the Throne of
[1:33:37] God with the blood making
[1:33:41] intercession his Spirit called the holy
[1:33:45] spirit is here living with us in our
[1:33:49] spirit doing the same things
[1:33:54] carrying the ministry that he
[1:33:57] started and he said I will be with
[1:34:01] you to the end of the
[1:34:04] world things that I do shall you
[1:34:08] also until the end of the
[1:34:11] world what was that he was making a
[1:34:15] covenant with you and me he says I will
[1:34:18] never ever leave you I will never
[1:34:21] forsake you because I am within you and
[1:34:25] my
[1:34:26] Covenant with you shall never
[1:34:29] fail Hallelujah so we thank God for his
[1:34:33] Grace
[1:34:34] Covenant because we know he never
[1:34:37] fails you might fail but he will not
[1:34:41] fail because he is known to be a
[1:34:43] covenant
[1:34:46] keeper God has a reputation to keep and
[1:34:49] his reputation is to never
[1:34:52] fail he never failed before so why is he
[1:34:56] going to start failing on
[1:34:58] you Hallelujah when you kneel down to
[1:35:01] pray you say Lord I know you've never
[1:35:05] failed so I know you're not going to
[1:35:07] start failing on
[1:35:09] me he gave a covenant he says if my
[1:35:13] people who are called by my name if they
[1:35:17] humble themselves and pray he says I
[1:35:20] will hear from
[1:35:22] Heaven Hallelujah
[1:35:24] we don't serve a deaf and damn God but
[1:35:27] we serve a God that
[1:35:29] hears so when he hear he answers your
[1:35:34] prayer so every time you kneel down to
[1:35:37] pray know that God has a covenant with
[1:35:40] you right
[1:35:41] there he says humble
[1:35:44] yourself and if you pray he say I will
[1:35:47] hear from heaven and I will heal your
[1:35:51] land Hallelujah you don't have to
[1:35:55] fret you don't have to worry because he
[1:35:58] is a covenant keeping
[1:36:00] God in the Old
[1:36:02] Testament he gave them a covenant and he
[1:36:06] says you are
[1:36:07] Jehovah I'm I'm Jehovah to you fill in
[1:36:11] the
[1:36:12] blank when they needed whatever they
[1:36:15] needed they called Jehovah
[1:36:18] Rafa when they needed
[1:36:20] Providence they
[1:36:22] said I'm calling
[1:36:25] Jehovah so they had to think what
[1:36:28] situation am I
[1:36:31] in they have to
[1:36:33] think what am I going
[1:36:35] through if they were going through
[1:36:38] troubles they'll say I'm calling on
[1:36:40] Jehovah
[1:36:41] Shalom I need
[1:36:43] peace but today you don't have to
[1:36:47] scratch your head
[1:36:49] thinking to say which name should I call
[1:36:51] him
[1:36:52] on because remember
[1:36:54] Jesus is the Jehovah of the Old
[1:36:58] Testament is the Jesus of the New
[1:37:01] Testament so you don't have to scratch
[1:37:03] seeing which one should I
[1:37:05] call which name should I call but when
[1:37:09] you call on the name of
[1:37:11] Jesus you have called it
[1:37:14] all Hallelujah some singer
[1:37:17] said I call him all that because he is
[1:37:21] all that to me whatever I need I call on
[1:37:25] the name
[1:37:26] Jesus if I need
[1:37:29] Jehovah I say Jesus when I need healing
[1:37:33] I say Jesus when I need peace I call on
[1:37:38] the name Jesus because Jesus is Jehovah
[1:37:42] of the old and he is My All In
[1:37:46] All oh someone said he's water when I'm
[1:37:50] thirsty he is bread when I'm hungry
[1:37:54] he is my Bridge Over Troubled
[1:37:57] Water he is my lawyer in the
[1:38:01] courtroom he is the doctor in the sick
[1:38:05] room he is my all
[1:38:07] that because that's what he is that's
[1:38:11] the Covenant he has with you and me that
[1:38:15] he never ever
[1:38:17] fails when he had the Covenant with
[1:38:20] Abraham he came back at a later time
[1:38:24] and he
[1:38:25] says is there
[1:38:28] anything that is
[1:38:31] impossible with my
[1:38:34] God after after Sarah
[1:38:37] failed to ad her to the
[1:38:41] Covenant God asked a
[1:38:43] question he says is there
[1:38:46] anything that's too hard for the
[1:38:50] Lord hallelujah and we know that this
[1:38:53] was God in
[1:38:55] flesh God was asking a
[1:38:58] question and we know God is
[1:39:01] omniscient so why would God ask a
[1:39:04] question to something he already
[1:39:09] knows is because in the first place
[1:39:12] Sarah was asking the wrong
[1:39:18] question because when Sarah received the
[1:39:22] promise is it
[1:39:24] possible for a barren woman an old
[1:39:28] woman whose womb has dried
[1:39:32] up to have a to have a
[1:39:35] baby and the answer is
[1:39:38] obvious no it's not possible she was
[1:39:42] asking the wrong
[1:39:43] question but God was
[1:39:46] coming telling her the kind of question
[1:39:49] to
[1:39:50] ask and the question was
[1:39:54] is there anything that's too hard for
[1:39:56] the
[1:39:57] Lord hallelujah and the answer to that
[1:40:00] is
[1:40:01] obvious nothing is too hard for my
[1:40:04] God because we know the dry wom of
[1:40:08] Sarah it was quickened up and she gave
[1:40:12] birth to
[1:40:13] Isaac amen because there's nothing
[1:40:16] that's too hard for my
[1:40:18] Lord so when you are going through your
[1:40:22] situation don't ask the wrong
[1:40:25] question don't ask the question what the
[1:40:28] doctor is telling
[1:40:30] you say in this predicament I'm
[1:40:34] in in this depression I'm
[1:40:37] in can anyone who's going through what
[1:40:40] I'm going through survive
[1:40:42] this the answer is
[1:40:44] obvious no they cannot survive it but
[1:40:48] you ask the right
[1:40:51] question anything that's too hard for
[1:40:53] the
[1:40:54] Lord whatever you are going through
[1:40:57] whatever situation is there is nothing
[1:41:00] that's too hard for my
[1:41:02] God so you ask the right question
[1:41:06] because what is impossible with
[1:41:08] man possible with God hallelujah Glory
[1:41:14] when the when Gabriel came to
[1:41:17] marry she he said you shall have a baby
[1:41:21] and she says I don't know no
[1:41:24] man how can this be the angel said there
[1:41:29] is nothing that is impossible with God
[1:41:33] she said look at your cousin
[1:41:35] Elizabeth she's
[1:41:38] old she is
[1:41:40] Barren she has two things working
[1:41:42] against
[1:41:43] her but because there is nothing that's
[1:41:46] impossible with
[1:41:48] God she's already six months in
[1:41:53] so if God could do it for
[1:41:56] Elizabeth Mary said if God could do it
[1:41:58] for my
[1:42:00] cousin I know God can do it for me
[1:42:03] Hallelujah so you got to come up and you
[1:42:07] stand and say Lord if you heal that
[1:42:11] brother I know you can heal me
[1:42:14] too if you deliver shadra Mish and the
[1:42:18] B I know you can deliver me too if you
[1:42:22] open the womb of SAR
[1:42:24] if you open the womb of
[1:42:26] Rachel and I know you can open my womb
[1:42:30] to it doesn't have to be a physical
[1:42:33] womb but God can still Quicken you
[1:42:37] because he is a never failing
[1:42:40] God he keeps his
[1:42:43] Covenant so Seed of
[1:42:46] Abraham Seed of Abraham is there
[1:42:49] anything that's too hard for the
[1:42:51] Lord tell your say no no no there's
[1:42:55] nothing that's too hard for my
[1:42:58] God hallelujah so whatever you are going
[1:43:02] to ask the right question because that
[1:43:06] question already has an guaranteed
[1:43:09] answer and when God was asking that
[1:43:13] question he's telling you that there is
[1:43:16] a
[1:43:17] possibility that your situation can
[1:43:20] change when he walked up to that lay man
[1:43:25] he says will thou be made
[1:43:28] whole it's not because he didn't know if
[1:43:30] he could be made whole or
[1:43:33] not but he was asking him a
[1:43:35] question do you want to be made
[1:43:38] whole so when God is asking a
[1:43:41] question he's telling you that there is
[1:43:43] a
[1:43:45] possibility that your situation can
[1:43:48] change whatever state you are in it can
[1:43:52] be transform
[1:43:54] if you are sick there is a
[1:43:57] possibility that you can be
[1:44:00] healed if you are in
[1:44:02] lack there is a
[1:44:04] possibility that he can provide for
[1:44:08] you is there a
[1:44:11] possibility yes there is a
[1:44:13] possibility because there is nothing
[1:44:15] that's too hard for my God who is a
[1:44:18] covenant keeping God hallelujah let's
[1:44:21] stand upon our feet let's give the Lord
[1:44:23] a clip of
[1:44:26] Praise

[1:44:39] 2024 with that realization that

[1:44:50] God because we are a covenant people
