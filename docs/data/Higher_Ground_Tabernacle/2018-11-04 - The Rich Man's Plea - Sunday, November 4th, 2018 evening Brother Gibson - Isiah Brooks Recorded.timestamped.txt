[37:01] The Book of Luke go Luke the sixteenth
[37:10] chapter
[37:18] and we've been getting at the 19th verse
[37:24] you got it says there was a certain rich
[37:27] man who was clothed and purple and fine
[37:30] linen and fared sumptuously every day
[37:34] and there was a certain beggar named
[37:37] Lazarus which was laid at his gate full
[37:39] of sores and designed to be fair with
[37:42] the crumb which fell from the rich man's
[37:44] table moreover the dogs came and licked
[37:47] his sores and they came to pass that the
[37:50] beggar died and was carried by the
[37:52] Angels into Abraham's bosom the rich man
[37:54] also died and was buried and in hell he
[37:58] lift up his eyes being in torments and
[38:00] seeth Abraham afar off and Lazarus in
[38:03] his bosom and he cried and said father
[38:05] Abraham have mercy on me and send
[38:08] Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his
[38:10] finger in water and cool my tongue for I
[38:12] am tormented in this flame be Abraham
[38:15] said son remember the darling thy
[38:18] lifetime receivers thy good things and
[38:20] likewise Lazarus evil things but now he
[38:23] is comforted in dollar tormented and
[38:26] besides all this between us and you
[38:29] there is a great gulf fixed hey man you
[38:32] can't get back up on the other side
[38:34] neither can it passed to us that would
[38:37] come from thence then he said I pretty
[38:40] therefore father that I would have seen
[38:42] him to my father's house for I have five
[38:45] brothers that he may testify unto them
[38:47] lest they also come into this place of
[38:50] torment Abraham said unto him they have
[38:53] Moses and the prophets let them hear
[38:55] them hear the word for your day they had
[39:01] a method for he had a method for his day
[39:04] he had a message and he said nay father
[39:07] Hamor one but a one way from the dead
[39:09] they will repent he said unto Him and
[39:13] they hear not Moses and the prophets
[39:15] neither will they be persuaded though
[39:18] one rose from the day let us bow
[39:20] Heavenly Father we read your holy word
[39:22] and I wrecked your breasts upon it once
[39:24] again the name of your son the Lord
[39:25] Jesus Christ amen praise Lord may be
[39:28] seated
[39:28] a man so we thank the law for
[39:31] reading of the word this is the screen
[39:32] message but we ministered somewhere else
[39:35] in the law blessed in I pray it be a
[39:36] blessing to you here tonight and we're
[39:39] gonna take a topic from there the rich
[39:41] man's plea the rich man's plea it's
[39:46] something this job just man being rich
[39:49] in the Bible I like the way Jesus tossed
[39:51] the story off he said there was a
[39:52] certain rich man and a certain bigger
[39:55] that means they were known okay alright
[40:02] by the grace of God I'm from Georgetown
[40:04] South Carolina they called us a geeky
[40:06] and Georgia and reach all kind of fans
[40:09] by the grace of God y'all forgive me of
[40:11] my fast talking so they were they were
[40:14] not known to us but Jesus knew them and
[40:18] only that Jesus know them but the people
[40:21] around them knew them that would say
[40:23] there was a certain rich man there was a
[40:26] certain beggar there were no one in the
[40:30] community was nothing screened they were
[40:32] known and jesus knew them so he began to
[40:34] tell the story about this rich man and
[40:37] this bigger and this rich man the Bible
[40:41] said he feared sumptuously he ate
[40:43] sumptuously every day that were
[40:47] something to me and he had the most
[40:49] magnificent food setting that you can
[40:52] see he didn't worry about no food
[40:55] brother he had all that cup of the Bible
[40:57] he fared sumptuously every day wasn't
[41:01] the day went by that he didn't eat a
[41:03] real great big meal all the fines of
[41:07] that did that he can get the Bible he
[41:09] hacking about he fears something me
[41:11] every day so every day he ate a very
[41:15] good meal one the time he can say that
[41:18] he went there hungry because he was rich
[41:20] and he could do whatever he wanted to do
[41:22] with his money but God had put somebody
[41:26] in his way notice the Bible plays
[41:29] Lazarus at the rich man's gate he was
[41:34] not nowhere far off from him he was
[41:36] right there someplace where he can be
[41:38] seen by the rich man every day he was at
[41:43] the Richmond
[41:43] gate that's very important obstacle this
[41:46] mannequin final kind of attitude this
[41:48] man had he had a bad attitude a bad
[41:52] spirit because he will be able to pass
[41:55] by lashes every day this gate and even
[41:59] think about him he saw last was a man
[42:03] sitting down there beggar full of sores
[42:06] hungry needing some need to hit a rich
[42:08] man passing by every day every day he
[42:12] eat sumptuously he fares good he got all
[42:14] the food can be worn it and he had a
[42:17] rich man you see sitting up no fall off
[42:19] now the Bible said he sat at the rich
[42:22] man's gate you got us get God I said God
[42:25] placed him there
[42:26] god bless him right where he can be seen
[42:30] and that what God does God put people in
[42:33] our way that they can be seen by us now
[42:36] we real Christian we should be able to
[42:38] identify them and this man here he
[42:41] wasn't no just average of man I believe
[42:43] he went to church I believe he was
[42:45] religious that was Jesus identified
[42:47] these two these people are religious
[42:49] people Lashley was a believer go we're
[42:51] getting to the story the Bob's Eliza was
[42:54] taken by the Angels into Abraham's bosom
[42:57] he wasn't that place of paradise where
[43:00] the Old Testament sense of that day went
[43:03] see so Abraham he wouldn't happen but
[43:07] see the Lazarus in the Richmond this
[43:09] rich man he fared sumptuously every day
[43:11] it's the best of the best had the best
[43:14] of the best but he was so starchy he was
[43:18] slow Oh God is so bad he can pass by
[43:21] Lazarus and not pill Angelini attention
[43:26] Christians should not be their starchy
[43:28] if you got Christ inside of you there's
[43:31] no way you can pass by somebody you need
[43:34] and shut your bowels up to me there's no
[43:37] way you can do that unless a man you
[43:39] just got that kind of a mentality or
[43:42] spirit to live like that
[43:43] there's many religious people that live
[43:46] like that they say they love the Lord
[43:48] and go to church but when someone is a
[43:50] need they need help they pass right by
[43:53] on paying no attention and God put them
[43:56] people in our way
[43:57] god please stand living out there by
[44:00] accident they're there on purpose
[44:02] God please the beggar and lastly the
[44:04] gift you can see him every day he passed
[44:07] by that man gorgeous hot Emma he we had
[44:09] to go grocery shop he had to get the
[44:11] food he had to get food they eat out
[44:15] good every day he had to see laughter
[44:17] sitting there full of sores the Bible
[44:20] said the dogs came and licked them
[44:23] that's right the only that the Bible
[44:24] said that he desired the crumbs they
[44:28] fell from the rich man's table you know
[44:30] that rich man went him give him the
[44:31] crumbs look at his spirit his spirit is
[44:34] just bad but he'd get he's religious he
[44:38] is a religious man that got it made no
[44:40] you know what the Prophet said your
[44:42] proud is what the same young man then
[44:45] asked Jesus for eternal life the same
[44:50] man now he's all grown up life was going
[44:53] on he got his bars you got everything he
[44:55] would but notice his heart is hardened
[44:58] now his heart has become hard you know
[45:02] why did he reject the gospel when he had
[45:06] an opportunity to get eternal life
[45:08] he turned it down and his life never was
[45:11] the same see you can't reject the gospel
[45:15] when the gospel comes to you that's the
[45:17] opportunity to receive it and when it
[45:19] calmed that when God is knocking at your
[45:21] door and you need to hear the call you
[45:25] need to hand sort of card this young
[45:27] rich man he made a bad decision
[45:29] he chose riches all the eternal life
[45:32] didn't come sell all that you have give
[45:35] to the poor come take up your cross and
[45:38] follow me no the Jesus told him right
[45:40] then give to the poor give to the poor
[45:43] didn't come take up your cross and
[45:45] follow me
[45:46] now here a poor beggar and wet his gate
[45:52] he's at his gate it sure is hard never
[45:56] was right with the law I read that story
[45:59] about the young rich look he was just
[46:00] playing with Jesus he already know what
[46:02] we do to you were living right you know
[46:05] he didn't commit a doctor you didn't
[46:07] lied and stealing ride it all long thing
[46:09] I kept from my youth um
[46:10] what lack I yeah feel like he was trying
[46:12] to prove something and she looked at him
[46:14] get his love in the Bible to Jesus love
[46:17] to him this is it one thing you lack one
[46:21] thing we all lack we're all lacking
[46:24] something we might think we've got a man
[46:26] but we are always lacking something and
[46:29] that something that we lacking is more
[46:30] God he was doing the commandment he was
[46:34] living right but he needed to go to an
[46:35] extra step to accept the Lord Jesus as
[46:38] his personal Savior
[46:39] that's a step he was not willing to take
[46:42] cuz why he would had to give up all that
[46:45] he had now remember when you choose to
[46:48] serve the Lord you were losing nothing
[46:52] you'll never God never takes God gives
[46:55] God is a giver and you can't be God
[46:59] given if God asks you to give up
[47:01] something he has something better for
[47:03] you down the road I'm a witness him and
[47:07] if God ever asked you to give up
[47:09] something
[47:10] remember there's something better for
[47:12] you down the road
[47:13] you have be willing to scratch out on
[47:16] faith to receive hit as Richard does
[47:19] John Rich on ruler he wasn't willing to
[47:21] make that step he wasn't willing to make
[47:24] that step to scratch out on faith to
[47:26] take God at His Word that he can do what
[47:29] Jesus said God
[47:30] how many guys saved a lot a lot of
[47:31] blessed Shaw Finch I've come to the Lord
[47:34] you haven't gotten poorer you've got
[47:37] richer you only have you gotten richer
[47:39] you're not only naturally but
[47:41] spiritually there were the great riches
[47:43] of that is in the spirit so Bogardus
[47:45] bless you naturally you left a lot of
[47:50] stuff behind you caught me could have
[47:51] been more than what you are now but you
[47:53] chose the way of the Lord and the
[47:55] blessing of God has blessed you would
[47:57] you are satisfied I'm satisfied I'm not
[48:02] disappointed I'm satisfied but what the
[48:05] Lord has done for me in my life where
[48:08] God has brought me to in my life I'm
[48:10] satisfied could I see what a world if I
[48:13] had had my way in with the way I wanted
[48:15] to go I wouldn't be here today
[48:17] did I pass we were all was all was a
[48:20] path that always led to destruction and
[48:23] when the lead
[48:24] to the Lord so you should be satisfied
[48:26] where God had brought you to you have no
[48:30] regrets about your life because your
[48:32] life is in God it's in Christ and it's a
[48:35] it's a good life I won't change it for
[48:38] nothing inside the world all the riches
[48:40] the world got off I'll return it down to
[48:42] keep this life this was a good life in
[48:44] Christ so the rich man a rich young
[48:47] ruler it meant he gets old and that same
[48:50] hard there was in from the beginning
[48:52] it's still there
[48:54] God put that bigger at his gate rather
[48:58] just get what he can see him every day
[49:00] and nobody did he didn't pay the beggar
[49:03] no attention every day he passed by last
[49:07] Ruth full of sores the dogs come to

[55:46] mean some people do have a deathbed
[55:48] confession I don't know what it'll make
[55:50] it there now we want them to make we
[55:51] said oh god bless you we believe it's
[55:52] gonna make it but we do not know because

[56:09] thief on the cross
[56:11] Amen it wasn't not instituted that he
[56:13] got in he said the dead thou shalt be
[56:15] with me in paradise
[56:16] I don't think that's gonna work again

[56:22] gonna serve the Lord
[56:24] you must make that decision I mean I
[56:26] have me in my decision if I thought it I
[56:29] am persuaded that he can change me now
[56:31] my mind has been made up a man I know
[56:34] whom I serve I know whom I believe and
[56:36] my mind is made up
[56:38] it made praise God nobody can change
[56:40] that no no death nor the nothing now is
[56:43] the argument made up by the grace of God
[56:45] so death a man does not change who we
[56:49] are this read on this buddy grace of God

[1:08:21] refused to call and then come the life
[1:08:23] in our being worst off than what it was

[1:10:07] for God and do much right
[1:10:09] you know God wholly evil back off about
[1:10:11] the Bible said God please I hate around

[1:10:17] only let the devil come in jobs life
[1:10:19] they show the devil it drove was a real
[1:10:22] Christian that's our God let the devil
[1:10:24] come on Joe
[1:10:25] you proved to the devil the door
[1:10:27] wouldn't save him golfing are never
[1:10:29] called God was blessing him and because
[1:10:31] God was doing what he was doing cookie
[1:10:32] with the richest man in the land
[1:10:34] no God Joel was serving God because he
[1:10:37] loved the Lord see no matter what Joel
