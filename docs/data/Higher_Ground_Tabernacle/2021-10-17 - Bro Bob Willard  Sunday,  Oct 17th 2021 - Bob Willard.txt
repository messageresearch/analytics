be the happiest people on the face of the earth you know they get happy at a ball game they shout carry on because somebody hit a home run brother sister christ did so much more for you and i yeah that hit a home run he saved us we owe him our lives [Music] it's a it's a privilege this morning i mean that from the depth of my heart it's an honor and a privilege to be here with you say no no i don't take this honor lightly we're here this morning gather together to worship and to praise the lord of the word of god i do not have a message of my own research god has sent us a message the bible says 4. for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout the voice of the archangel and the trump of god brother sister the prophet said in the message he said that jesus does all three of these while he's descending before he appears he said the shout out is a message to dress and gather the bride of jesus christ the bible said the lord himself is that was taken in houston texas [Music] behind a mask by the name of william a redeemed man a redeemed man holding the office of the seventh church age messenger christ himself christopher used a man to speak it amen amen christ is the actor coming together that he permitted us to see it [Music] [Music] i ask you for your prayers i i need the help of the lord this morning brother branham said that the gift that god places is not the gift to preach he said the gift was to move yourself out of the way so he could do the speaking i feel right at home god bless you this morning if you would be so kind as to open your bibles i'd like to take texts this morning from revelations chapter 3 this is a very familiar text to us it is a portion of scripture that addresses this last church age and i want to read a portion of this it's addressed to the angel of the church of the laodicean where i would like to start reading this morning is verse 20. the scripture reads behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me to him i love this here because this portion of or this age of laodicea this portion of the book of revelation is addressed to the church but i want you to notice in verse 20 he's addressing him because laodicea is more than just a church age it's a spiritual condition you can never have christ welcomed in the church until he's welcomed in here we are the church it's not the building it's the heart to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am sat down with my father in his throne that the third throne first throne was in heaven the second throne was in christ and the third throne is the heart of man [Music] praise the lord roger let's approach the author for just a moment from the depths of our hearts this morning we thank you for the grand privilege that you've extended to us this morning to gather together those of like precious faith under the blood of jesus christ and dear father we ask that you would have your way this morning would you this morning speak to each heart and lord whatever would hinder us whatever the devil has done we curse him this morning and we ask father that in speaking to our hearts that we would be set free in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen god bless you may be seated now i'd like to start this morning i want to read from the message of the laodicean church and i'll be this is the uh message directly off the tape and brother branham in addressing this he tells us that this portion of the scripture that that i have read he said it's the most pathetic it's the saddest part of the bible he had ever read and he said that here is he said it's the most striking scripture because the very church that he died for has put him out and he's standing outside he said he's knocking trying to get back in to the very church that he desired let me read it to you he says i stand at the door and knock knock after being pushed out then trying to get back in he crawls and knocks at the door this is the most striking record in the new testament i think there's nothing could be sadder than this to see the savior of the world took out of his own church he says he didn't listen he says they were lukewarm said he didn't have to spew them out brother branham goes on to say [Music] brother branham that breaks a while ago i just leaned over my table and started crying simon of pharisee a religious leader of the day invited jesus to his house jesus came he said we failed to make him welcome brother says jesus had dirty feet amen he takes to wash them and make him welcome he tells us how that there was a harlot woman that was not invited to simon's house and he was being ignored she elbowed [Music] and she washed them did we confess he lives in [Music] christ standing outside of his church knocking at the door and brother so is he this morning here this morning knocking at the door of our hearts the latch to that door the latch to that door luckily it's on the inside and invite christ on the inside and then once he's inside we need to do our part to make him welcome brother branham he says here concerning this woman at the well as he tells about we know what happened with that woman mary simon was sitting there watching her wash his feet she was an ill-famed woman and simon was criticizing that but as she washed his feet dried them with her hair jesus turned to simon jesus and said simon i've got something to say to you he told simon how that all her sins which were many we're all forgiven simon still had his sitting in the seat of the scornful i don't brother banham said and today jesus is standing outside the door of a pentecostal organization baptist organization and people are passing we all have the same message the same bible and brother sister i know that we are beyond the age of pentecost i've got direct statements that tell us that we are in the bright age but brother sister just because we are beyond an age we're beyond the age of luther's message 400 years ago but we're not beyond justification we're beyond the denominational part not beyond the experience without justification none of us are saved justification [Music] the next stage of grace he until you're clean [Music] you find a glass in your yard in the dirty but you're not going to use it dirty you true christianity is not taking the bible as a book of rules that you try to live true christianity is accepting what christ did for you at calvary by faith accepting his pardon repenting [Music] in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive what the gift of the holy ghost what is the holy ghost you're lost [Music] one of the disciples in matthew 16. jesus asked his dis uh he presented a question to his disciples jesus he said who do men say i [Music] had enough understanding of their bible to know what son of man meant son of man is a prophet not a son one of the prophets jesus turned to peter peter who do you say peter responded thou art the christ the son of the living god peter saw beyond the veil because christ came in the office of son of man came as a prophet that was promised by moses lord thy god shall raise up a prophet like and unto me the difference was this was god own physical body now notice jesus's response he said blessed art thou simon barjona um did not reveal this to you so he was blessed it wasn't pointed so much at what he said but who he received it from into our hearts because if a man talks you into this a man will talk you out of it but when christ the holy ghost reveals i will build my church praise because he could receive revelations yeah as predestinated seed was given the greatest of all revelations from god himself would you remember and then jesus says right amongst our own they've tried to convince some but the holy ghost is different yet it doesn't act the same way let's stay with our bibles let's stay with the message listen to this is this all right so far amen okay good right brother madam says i like to see a real pedigreed christian not packing his letters the methodists last week the baptist this week he's pedigreed pentecost this is what brother man says now i want to be pentecostal yes sir he preached the message just in case you didn't follow through and listen to the tape but he entitled the message why i am a holy roller so if my prophet was a holy roller is from the top of the head souls that don't matter how short how tall hey man now watch i don't mean denominational pentecost i mean the real power of the resurrected christ the real pentecostal that we are beyond pentecost absolutely we are absolutely this is the message brother madam preached two years after this message status is second peter chapter one it's to be partakers of the divine nature [Music] so brother the first thing we have is faith and that faith takes us to matthew 16. who do men say i the son of man he builds his church here's what brother banh said what's this he said this is where you pentecostals made your mistake you were born in the family by the holy ghost but failed to listen to the tutor and go on and grow up alley it's just the beginning we are required in this age to come up to a token to a seal to an adoption questions not every born-again believer be saved but every born-again believer go in the wraps there's two saved groups [Music] that word in that scripture means they all lived sanctified they were all believers they were all saved they're all virgins bible reads how that they went out to be remember okay the bible reads that they all slumbered and slept but then at midnight there came a bridegroom cry woke up all the virgins including the wise he said the bridegroom cry comes through malachi 4. that shows us there's both wise and foolish right here amongst ourselves that was elected that their lamp had gone out no longer did that in fact if you look at it you have a scofield bible in the margin going back to the original greek or going [Music] absolutely both lamps were lit and burning they took an extra vessel [Music] they asked brother branham well all born again believers go in the rapture he said no they won't all go because brother sister it takes each of these virtues in you glory this is blasphemous names and this message was preached the following month after statures of a perfect man he goes through all of these virtues he the day of the redemption of what none of them can be added he said that was what was the matter of branham tabernacle you try to take on the works of christ before you have the nature of christ he's bringing up his people he's bringing his people up you and i yeah the individual the gentiles not saved as a group saved as an but how do he says make your calling and election sure use it as a mirror to your life [Music] and know where you're standing and brother no matter where we are in our journey christ doesn't start something that he won't finish praise the lord i don't care what the circumstances are we're believers [Applause] praise the lord there's not all of us want to make heaven i know i'm feeling at home right now that turned to your wife this morning oh can't wait to be unwise virgin we're here to be the bride of jesus christ of jesus christ this is what takes us there yeah [Music] to come to the adoption of sons and daughters of god god didn't just predestinate us to be believers predestined us to be born again he predestines to a headstone to a seal to an adoption brother to the bride of christ to deceive said you could no longer be lost and god himself lost he said you are a part of him he said there's a part of you that never fell there's a part of you that has always existed this might cause you to shout amen praise the lord glory to god amen he says knowledge temperance patience the holy christ in the person of the holy ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the holy ghost that the holy ghost gave that gave you birth is the same holy ghost that adds these virtues and it's the same holy ghost we're in the capstone without first being born again blasphemous names i'm just taking a look i don't know what time i started and brother brooks does not have a clock can i have five more minutes is that go ahead okay this brother said go ahead thank you lord every church has a brother like this he got one at home too he just folks are all looking go ahead brother paul no i don't want to wear you out blasphemous names i want to read this to you praise the lord i just love the word of god the message of the hour praise the lord he said there's a lot that goes with this there's a lot that goes with the holy ghost yes sir here on page 39 brother branham says how do you get in the church what bye he says i'm climbing the ladder now so as you you at and brother was very he said you cannot add the next virtue well brother that's what they had on the day of the holy they were filled with the holy ghost they shouted they danced they acted like drunk people because they received the holy ghost [Applause] that others can draw strength from your life [Music] knowledge jesus said oh that the prophet saws he said this is where a lot of us fall off he said that word doesn't mean stop drinking alcohol that was done under sanctification [Music] that the dove he puts [Music] that he's got to take care of if the new birth gave you all of those then why would you need to add them after you're born again [Music] all that we need to give to christ okay i want to read this and then i'll close now i've got to add patience i said what i've come this far and i still ain't got the holy ghost brother he's not referring to your birth in order to be an heir in order to be adopted we've got to grow up through these virtues to the full stature of christ then he in this age that would tie up all the loose ends that would reveal the full mystery of god to whom much is given much is required i add godliness [Music] into this into this into this into this into this and then the love of god christ comes down and seals that up in me [Music] he births you and seals that into you [Music] you see why the new birth is so important so see brother sister from have you ever met a so god had to take care of our temper first he said have patience with god have patience with one another he said how you answer back the bible says not when riled upon i've got a thumb pointing back at me so you see brother sister in the new birth put you in a position [Music] myself is they blame their ancestors well my dad had temper my dad granddaddy had temper oh [Music] no god's spirit can overcome whatever lays in your family this is a result of the natural birth this is the result of a supernatural he said from the sweetness of your heart forgiving every man if you've got temper you can't do that so god deals with that the bible says let not the sun go down upon your wrath it produces a root called bitterness and it will run the holy spirit out of your life forgiving everything brother sister i'm so thankful this morning for the word of god [Applause] that doesn't need the correction of the word patience on so quick to criticize [Music] and brother all of us we belong to a local assembly because look god's a god of variety like you like [Music] maybe the brother says something does to rub you the wrong way the sister does something well brother that's just a little test for
