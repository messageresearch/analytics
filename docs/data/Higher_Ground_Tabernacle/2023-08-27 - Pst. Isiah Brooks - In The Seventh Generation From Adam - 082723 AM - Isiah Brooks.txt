this uh the preaching uh we are going to have the service there at Cherry Glenn Cherry Glen it's it's up there at Sullivan Lakeville Lake if if you put it in your GPS you will direct you to where we're going places you could follow someone afterwards my wife also want to meet with the wives um he's dealing with uh uh the Sunday school as well as uh picnic for the church before it gets cold do you see picnic police Hallelujah we love the Lord we're so thankful for God's grace we're going to ask that you turn with us to the word of the Lord we're going to be coming from two passages of scripture the first will be a Hebrews the 11 5. and the second one will be from Saint John 5.29 uh uh last Sunday or the Sunday that we were here last we were working with the end of the Harvest and I trust by the grace of God that we'll be able to uh end this session up um today we're going to uh uh work on uh the subject the Seventh Generation from Adam the vision of Enoch all I could say is the gospel is so beautiful to me all I could say is the word of God is so wonderful to me uh it's it's just um amazing how God being so great it could form himself into a word that his creation might understand him it truly is a beautiful situation Hebrews 11 and 5. by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death amen and was not found because God translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God foreign [Music] remember brother Branham said Enoch type the bride the Enoch and enote John 5. I don't know jeans 25-29 River 7th century Hallelujah and it reads verily verily I say unto you the hour is come and now is Hallelujah when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of God and they that here shall live amenities [Music] for as the father hath life in himself so hath he given to the son to have life in himself and have given him authority to execute judgment also because he is the son of man Marvel not at this for the hour is come in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that are done they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation is you love the Lord before we go any further I want to bring attention to every year even as you were born we will all die [Music] except the Bro except the Rapture takes place I'm wondering in other words There Is No Escape we will all have to face the Lord Jesus Christ whether we be right or whether we be wrong amen let us pray you know Heavenly Father Celeste we come before you Lord Jesus we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we pray this morning that your perfect will be done every spirit in this place that is not like you Lord give your servant pre-course give us Grace to move completely out of your way out of your voice this morning speak to your people Lord that they may hear you not in their heads but in their hearts Lord we thank you this morning for being who you are foreign thank you for this morning thank you for the victory that you've given to us and we praise you Lord Jesus for being who you are foreign as as I was studying I was just looking at so many things you and I know as we started this message with the coming of Elijah we dealt with the ministry of William Branham that he was the Elijah of our day in his ministry you know the acceptable year of the Lord as well as the Revenge you will see the Revenge of the Lord and the reason being is Jesus Christ's ears so he had to bring both portions along the portion of acceptability he called it our Jubilee Hallelujah and he brought the day of Moses god used him in such a mighty way that he was he was able to touch the scripture from Genesis all the way to Revelation it was not the man is it was God in the man and what was God doing he was proving to that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and forever and he does not change his word is the same now we find out that Enoch was the seventh from Adam it is been a son of Adam you see uh the eighth Generations [Music] there were things going on even though the scripture doesn't say much but one of the things we [Music] think things is that the vision of Enoch into Noah's vision of the world destruction and the wise versions amen we saw by the grace of God you would have never known [Music] was able to build this pyramid [Music] [Music] Jesus Christ Jesus Christ [Music] he rejected by his own and all that refuse Enoch is in the same place [Music] amen and in that Walking with God you'll find that there's not much sure don't Hallelujah but listen Enoch was doing more than just walking with God he's walk with God Amen what was required for his day to escape the oncoming judgment and the Bible tells us hallelujah was translated he moved from one dimension Hallelujah because he had a testimony [Music] in order to be translated you cannot live under they are inspiration of Noah under that day [Music] glory to God whether you understand that or not there's no Escape you must face God face God and we are right at the end of which was the foundation it was what the early church was built upon this is built upon the faith [Music] we understand that Enoch had a blood sacrifice see that was what made Enoch perfect this is in his works in the blood sacrifice of perfection that's exactly right Hallelujah [Music] okay because he is a God Hallelujah the Bible said be perfect Hallelujah as your father which is in heaven is perfect are you going to be perfect without the hairstyles how are you going to be perfect Hallelujah is that right God is real and you and I must understand I'm going to preach this morning I don't care yeah like a different church this morning but we had a good time Wednesday yeah and we want to have a good time this morning you must understand in the days of Enoch it was just as evil as this day is Hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah here's the prophet that God says in paragraph 51. he said I can see him go up to the region of the Lost knocks on the door he's available they began screaming and wailing Souls that repented knots [Music] you're going to die someday whether you young or old but you better make ready everybody yes sir they began to scream and wailing no souls that repented not [Music] [Music] if you missed your conscience [Music] preaching this message [Music] it works this is not a picnic this is not a religious cult this is the Bride of Jesus Christ being formed and shaped in the image of Jesus Christ you can have all your worldly pleasures Hallelujah I absolutely that Enoch had a spirit a spiritual revelation foreign [Music] [Music] but they didn't want to believe that it was a time like this day a time of idol I don't listen to it idolatry did you do that tree Hallelujah but that Enoch had a revelation oh who I am I am here that was pretty Korean words this is not a new testament doctrine that was always he was lost [Music] [Music] can you accept for me she was all the screaming with all the Halloween with all the Wailing there was no place to escape because they missed it that's why the Bible says the day that you him not your heart this message will be preaching you again he went low [Music] [Music] we can go forward they can be a day of change for you or you can come up here you need to repent before God Hallelujah listen before the Book of Revelation was ever ever Hallelujah [Music] and Jude purpose is objective in the letter was for twofold he wanted to expose the false teachers encourage Christians in the faith all the truth Elijah worshipers [Music] standing for the truth if my God be God let him answer by fire Hallelujah that's the only way Hallelujah [Music] because [Music] the Lord hallelujah and there are a lot of people who worship don't even know God hallelujah Hallelujah we know for sure he is a real Lord he is the god that who created the heavens and the down there [Music] the only Lord side stand with me Hallelujah but those amen who refuse them what he says call on your God see if he's going to answer see I got a card and you have a God [Music] Hallelujah the Bible says [Music] faith in God [Music] Hallelujah [Music] my God is rich right now he's looking for somebody else oh God Hallelujah Hallelujah oh people of God this word is a filter said by all it don't fear is that right yes what that's what the prophet says it's a filter it's going you're going to either go through it you're gonna either go through the filter you're going to eat through the filter God can use what do you think about the words God don't want your reasoning God wants your faith Hallelujah I'm sure he didn't say I'm going to be translated how am I going to be changed because remember brother Brandon said that the Rapture or the translation [Music] one two completely no no [Music] your hair is turning back the original colors straightening up something is happening with us [Music] and see Abraham Sarah looking at Abraham you're not doing bad yourself there's something happening say this to you this morning explain the change in me from the provides [Applause] [Applause] [Music] something something [Music] for me [Applause] amen let me say this it's foreign [Music] Hallelujah [Music] and look at politics it's not because they want to be evil spirits but they're working here causing them to do what they're doing what are they doing just keep falling they're shedding the states how can I say it for the bride they get desperate you're going to eat them it is time for you to begin to see what God is doing it's literally time if you're not careful yourself foreign 1953 Hallelujah now we're now Madonna I think that's the sixth we're the sixth part of the sixth now we're noticing notice what kind of faith that they had you know they had a faith in a resurrected living Christ of living among them come at the early church just the same as he was before he ever died see they wasn't contending from some historical Affairs but they were contending for a living Christ a resurrected one who was in their midst now when he rose from the dead on the same things after he rose from the dead that he did before he died even greater and more of it this is the most deceiving Age The Amazing Christians but they don't have him in the midst they don't have that Holy Ghost people don't want the holy ghosts you've got the labor foreign [Music] [Music] followed Moses believe Moses was a prophet is it too small I'm gonna tell you something those of you who still murmur and complaints you haven't read your Bible lately it's hard to turn against them and all those things of the flesh that's how it is you want to make them shape just satisfied this is [Music] because what I am I've been born y'all hear what I'm saying I've been born to be free I've been born a Son of God to be his heirs for heaven to show this world God does not change yeah in a little while it meant to know it do you see him Hallelujah do you you'll see him do you see him when you put you out there will you take it back and forth to work a boy this is what Calgary is all about he died so we could commune together he died so he can touch us and she could touch him Hallelujah [Music] oh my God yet ye shall see me the church but I'll be with you that's it he's here even in you to the end of the world man I don't know what that means to you but it gives me such a security message security [Music] that was what the power the apostles believe is it discreet is about Kauai and they believe that was in the flesh equation he was also and more important and that's what they taught that's what they believed and that's what they practice and that's what God confirmed it's a good joke for me Hallelujah listen brother Branham didn't touch everybody foreign but we need Faith wow I'm surprised Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah it says on the fourth verse there are certain men yeah yeah certain zombies in unawares ordained to this condemnation turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness our Lord Jesus Christ so let me say it like this those of you who are being consumed by love yes Hallelujah that you're not one of them but if I were you I would get before God hallelujah let me not be ordained let's go my number so what he says he says put you in remembrance though you once knew this how did the Lord having saved me saved the people out of the land of Egypt destroyed them that believe Hallelujah and you and I you know the same spirits that work with them it's working in this age Hallelujah this is why we call this is the Third Exodus and wherever our Exodus is trying to block you Hallelujah you say well brother Brooks when I get down on my knees to pray I get sleepy I get tired sometimes you know what I'm gonna tell you stay there we still are I don't care how long it takes that's the devil Diablo you in the right place [Music] don't you know when it was time for Jesus to be crucified the devil wasn't fighting his money if it be that will if this cup pass from me everybody [Music] to do the will of God no matter what the cost Hallelujah the Bible says having saved the people [Music] afterwards destroyed him and the Angels were kept not their first estate Elijah preachers too preachers are not exempt from hell yeah a lot of preachers what about all those preachers Jesus Christ and 70 of them walked away hallelujah what about those 400. I was supposed to meet with William Branham to be baptized what you think happened to them come into the knowledge of the truth no more salvation you will be judged with the sinner is that the word hallelujah you [Music] is that right Hallelujah hey you love the Lord the angels that kept not their first estate what happened all those people foreign all of them were lost y'all hear what I'm saying all of them they knew of Abraham's God left there and went into sodoms when you leave this message go into the world you are truly in Danger ous fires but I know that's it the devil knows the message is having a sausage Jesus Christ [Music] and the Bible says it was in Christ awaken his body Hallelujah that's the truth [Music] [Music] that's why you feel unclean thank you do you know when you get unclean come on movie Hallelujah that's why God said to Israel You're not crossing over to you Sanctified Hallelujah it won't be no stinking subjects Hallelujah oh Jesus nothing but the rose of Sharon um listen the Angels listen let's go on no I will see help me Lord going after strange flesh for an example likewise also these filthy dreamers this church Hallelujah [Music] is that the truth man people say well I ain't paying my taxes Hallelujah so everything you think you got uh this is not even my notes everything you think you listen every one of us die naked you can't carry nothing with you brother Brandon told us the only thing is your character is that right that's the only thing if your character is you know you're doing wrong things Amazing Grace hallelujah it's always been great even under the law it's been great y'all better hear what I'm saying and y'all wonder why God ain't blessing you why are you walking around I'm not gonna go there I got too much more to preach just a minute we started late so come on but these speak evil of those things they know not but what they know naturally is and those things they corrupt themselves really Hallelujah let me let me let me stress this again because in Duty says that God came to execute judgment upon all driven people existence among them of all their ungodly Godly committed God is not talking about the world nothing about Godly about the world the world of Sinners ungodliness come by those who can claim to be God he's not talking to the world Hallelujah right all the ungodly Deeds which they have ungodly committed and of all their hard speeches with yourself swelling words admiration because of advantage I don't want to preach like nobody here it is I'm Gonna Let You Go in just a minute here truly sleeping it's coming from earnestly contending for the faith more to this message but I'm just gonna yeah foreign [Music] all kinds of things to [Music] let the world say what they want to [Music] look how fundamental sometimes we can be without knowing truth whatever you're either in the spirit of the Holy Ghost [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] where I'm coming from so much I could say yeah Isaiah 54 and 5. this is truly what I believe and accept is required is accepted the Bible says according to Isaiah 54 and 5. is thine husbands the Lord of hosts eternity's Army is his name and that redeemed the Holy One of Israel the god of the whole earth is shall he recall Hallelujah as small as I am you will see as little as I am receives particularly my daddy was a drunkard my mother was illiterate and my marriage couldn't read or write but he chose it right [Music] I am so grateful to the Lord you may not love this message but I do and all I know is what he's doing is marvelous in my it's nobody could have changed me personally I couldn't change [Music] but I see change it's not a theatrical show spectacular I'm just saying I can't help myself when I think about what he's done for me don't forget this would meet with the wife we have baptism I just want to make sure I got the names right yeah our brother William and our brother name he will be baptized Hallelujah and we want to say if there be anybody here that's been convicted this morning you want to be baptized we'll do that by the grace of God because I I believe it's so important because questions I I [Music] think I was telling my grandson who's with me Christopher want to share with him how God has brought me a mighty long way [Music] we all start at the bottom but God raises us up Hallelujah [Music] my mother died my married malter when I was going to my senior year in high school but my mother was like a prophetess or something it is she told me Junior God is going to save you and she told me the church I was going to go to in my palette she told me I was going to have a rough time at that church but she also told me don't leave that church because God is going to send you a greater light basket [Music] all right when the Lord sent this message to me let's go Drew my own ways I didn't find it it found me it went behind my church walls like he did Jericho please came in and gave me a word it is Criminal [Music] people I'm saying if you're gonna come come with all you guys [Music] if there be any desire to be baptized outside of my brothers [Music] I'm looking for God to do the miraculous in this church but I know that if God gonna do the miraculous we must first get rid of the unbelief and if you have unbelief in you as a as a member of this church I'm talking more multi degrees as a part of this Fellowship you know you need to ask God to remove all of your unbelief this is all for the working of the Ministries edification of the Saints seeing that we have no one um father God we come before you thanking you for your grace and your mercy Lord you know within myself [Music] I'm worth nothing but because of you I'll one day build your treasure in heaven pray that you bless the hard Hearts break it down Lord Oh Lord we ask in your name Jesus Christ take down the walls of unbelief [Music] the people see that yes your voice and not mine of the struggles that Enoch went through they come back and we've always seen Noah Lord [Music] and it's almost time for the translation of Enoch again which is your bride Lord and once the salt has been taken away would be worth nothing but Trot to be trodden underfoots give us Grace give us more grace [Music] to escape your judgment in your wrath Lord in your lovely name Jesus
