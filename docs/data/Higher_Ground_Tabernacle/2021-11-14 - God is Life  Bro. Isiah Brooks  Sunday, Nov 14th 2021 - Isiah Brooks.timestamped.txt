[45:09] the seal
[45:11] and he has brought us a message
[45:13] of eternal life
[45:16] in this message
[45:42] here in saint john beginning at the
[45:43] first verse saint john
[45:47] in the beginning was the word and the
[45:49] word was with god and the word was god
[45:56] the same was in the beginning with god
[45:58] elite
[46:00] all things were made by him and without
[46:03] him was not anything made
[46:05] that was made
[46:11] in him was life on him

[46:43] will be done

[46:49] amen
[46:51] i intended for brother keith to come and
[46:53] pray with me but
[46:54] anyway god knows
[46:57] sorry i missed that brother
[47:00] you love the lord
[47:05] you know i'm i'm excited inside you
[47:08] sweet
[47:11] we had a wonderful time
[47:14] there in arizona
[47:18] uh really reminded me of the old
[47:20] services that
[47:22] we used to experience
[47:27] where the people were
[47:29] so excited about god
[47:34] they didn't care what anyone else
[47:35] thought about their worship in
[47:51] i saw this young man sing a song
[47:55] and the holy spirit fell hello
[47:59] and the church pretty much abruptly
[48:03] erupted
[48:08] i'm putting him on the spot i know
[48:14] but sometimes we don't understand what
[48:16] we have defunded
[48:19] and i was just telling
[48:21] some of the brothers there
[48:24] saying it to myself
[48:26] if the people here would pull on god
[48:28] gifts
[48:46] whatever
[49:01] that's right right
[49:04] my concerns this morning
[49:08] are those that are concerning life
[49:14] when we think about life
[49:17] what do we think about
[49:20] in your
[49:22] way of thinking
[49:24] you think about life what are you
[49:26] thinking
[49:31] [Music]
[49:43] [Music]
[49:54] and none of those things are pertaining
[49:56] to life
[49:59] none of those things that we can achieve
[50:01] in this world
[50:03] could ever give us everlasting life
[50:07] everything that's brought into this
[50:10] world
[50:28] and the bible says that everything that
[50:29] have breath praise the lord
[50:33] god or life is the only one that can
[50:35] give you breathe
[50:50] is that right
[50:51] now the bible tells us
[50:54] that the word is life
[50:58] tell us that god is life
[51:00] juicy like
[51:02] not only is god life god is love that's
[51:04] what we want to dream
[51:06] and i'm going to bring
[51:19] [Music]
[51:30] [Music]
[51:32] the purpose for a light bulb is to bring
[51:34] light
[51:48] being the light of the world
[51:51] if there is no light in you
[51:54] and the light that i'm speaking of
[51:57] is the life of jesus christ
[52:01] hallelujah
[52:04] what is this light
[52:07] first of all we know it is the word
[52:11] and we understand that there is only one
[52:14] god
[52:17] right and the bible tells us that the
[52:19] god that we serve
[52:21] particularly
[52:23] became the word that we serve
[52:26] and the word and god is the saying
[52:30] it's just god conning sin
[52:33] himself
[52:35] into a lower state
[52:37] upon the doctor
[52:39] when we think about the word
[52:43] if you think the word is
[52:55] when it says in the beginning was the
[52:57] word
[53:12] so in the beginning was the word
[53:15] that's what john said and the word was
[53:17] with god
[53:18] and the word was god
[53:21] brother branham picked it up said it was
[53:22] a spirit
[53:24] he's a spirit
[53:26] that's why the bible said no man have
[53:28] seen him at any time
[53:31] but the son has declared him
[53:34] hallelujah and god the spirit the word
[53:37] the jews can never train
[53:40] hallelujah
[54:15] [Music]
[54:21] but i trust by god's grace that we'll
[54:24] understand this morning
[54:26] amen the importance of divine nature
[54:30] hallelujah
[54:31] amen
[54:33] listen he is god
[54:34] did you
[54:36] timothy put it this way first timothy um
[54:40] the sixth chapter
[54:43] in the 15th verse
[54:52] which in time pass
[54:54] he shall show
[54:56] who is the only potentate
[54:59] the king of kings
[55:00] and the lord of lords
[55:16] who only have immortality
[55:19] dwelling in the light which no man can
[55:22] approach unto
[55:24] who no man can have have seen
[55:28] nor can see
[55:29] to whom be honor and power everlasting
[55:44] jesus christ
[55:48] to be
[55:49] as he was he
[55:52] in order to approach god
[55:57] is that right
[55:58] even the bible said
[56:00] no man can come to the sun
[56:02] except the father draw him
[56:04] [Music]
[56:06] so in order to understand what we're
[56:08] saying
[56:09] in order to understand god
[56:11] you must understand the mystery of god
[56:17] that's what people don't see
[56:20] there was a mystery hiding in there
[56:24] in the natural i couldn't see it
[56:28] but in jesus christ on jesus christ the
[56:31] purpose of god was revealed the
[56:33] objective the very nature of god
[56:37] we didn't even know god
[56:39] until jesus came jesus hallelujah we
[56:42] could have never seen him until jesus
[56:45] came just that's crucial because the
[56:47] bible says
[56:49] in jesus name
[56:50] well the fullness of the godhead bodily
[57:10] people have defined god
[57:13] in so many ways
[57:15] but let's just take it from the
[57:16] religious aspect
[57:19] some people say he's baptized
[57:21] some say he's methodical
[57:23] some say he's your overwhelming
[57:36] [Music]
[57:38] you see one of the things
[57:40] that we must come to understand
[57:46] when paul was talking about the
[57:48] scriptures
[57:52] and paul was talking about the
[57:54] revelation of the word
[57:57] i understand what paul was talking about
[58:00] he wasn't talking about the new
[58:01] testament
[58:03] because the new testament had not been
[58:05] written yet
[58:07] paul was talking about the old testament
[58:09] scriptures
[58:11] hallelujah because it was in the old
[58:14] testament scripture
[58:19] hallelujah
[58:20] this is why
[58:22] the prophet of god tells us
[58:24] that he's in the old testament
[58:27] as well as the new year
[58:28] now we'll read paul's scripture
[58:31] and we'll consider what he says
[58:34] and we'll think that paul is just
[58:36] talking about just the new testament
[58:39] paul is talking about the old and the
[58:41] news
[58:42] of jesus now that the new testament has
[58:44] been written
[58:47] off the time
[58:48] even
[58:58] but we did not know about malachi 4.
[59:14] there's nothing that can be greater than
[59:16] the world
[59:27] now if you can understand that then
[59:29] you'll be able to understand what the
[59:31] revelation is for us
[59:36] amen the new testament
[59:43] understand everything has to be in the
[59:45] book
[59:48] or anything
[59:51] but this is not the final
[59:55] this is only the beginning
[59:58] this is why denominations
[1:00:01] cannot fit
[1:00:02] the proof
[1:00:03] of the god or jesus christ
[1:00:07] let me back that up this is why
[1:00:09] the denomination
[1:00:11] cannot take malachi 4.
[1:00:15] in the world
[1:00:17] because they say we have jesus christ
[1:00:20] and we don't need no other
[1:00:22] people but what they fail to see
[1:00:26] jesus christ came again
[1:00:28] in the form of a prophet
[1:00:31] hallelujah
[1:00:32] the prophet was not god
[1:00:34] but god was called it clothed in him
[1:00:38] y'all understand what i'm saying
[1:00:40] and the way they treated jesus
[1:00:42] it's the same way they treated me
[1:00:46] hallelujah
[1:00:51] amen did exactly
[1:00:53] what the lord said he would
[1:00:56] [Music]
[1:01:08] you
[1:01:22] foreign
[1:01:34] [Music]
[1:01:37] who had a good life
[1:01:38] you had all the robbers who had a good
[1:01:40] life
[1:01:41] hallelujah oral robbers did miracles
[1:01:43] hallelujah but it was beyond that
[1:01:48] because we understand that william
[1:02:02] [Applause]
[1:02:03] had to produce
[1:02:30] there must be something on display
[1:02:40] [Music]
[1:02:46] my super
[1:02:51] [Music]
[1:03:01] [Music]
[1:03:07] hallelujah amen glory to god
[1:03:11] so you and i oh
[1:03:13] must understand
[1:03:17] [Music]
[1:03:27] it has to be separate
[1:03:30] a life that others can see
[1:03:33] [Applause]
[1:03:34] hallelujah even if they think you're
[1:03:37] crazy like they did i'm not john the
[1:03:39] baptist
[1:03:40] could say it's all right
[1:03:42] because you
[1:03:49] [Music]
[1:03:56] jesus jesus jesus was the true light
[1:04:00] that's uh john 1 9. saint john 1 9.
[1:04:04] well
[1:04:04] he was the true light
[1:04:08] which lighted
[1:04:10] every man that cometh into the world
[1:04:15] hallelujah
[1:04:16] y'all understand me now we come to a
[1:04:19] place
[1:04:20] that we understand
[1:04:22] whether you be weak
[1:04:24] or whether you're blind
[1:04:37] but understand by god's grace is true
[1:04:41] we have been called this life
[1:04:44] has been called out in denominations
[1:04:46] out of the organization
[1:04:48] for a greater purpose for them to yeah
[1:04:51] y'all understand me
[1:04:56] [Music]
[1:05:16] hallelujah but she when the prophet of
[1:05:18] god was here
[1:05:20] he gave
[1:05:27] [Music]
[1:05:34] somebody
[1:05:43] he's trying to do everything he can
[1:05:46] just stop this from happening
[1:06:00] she has literally been ordained
[1:06:12] can you imagine
[1:06:14] how beautiful eden must have been
[1:06:31] hallelujah
[1:06:33] and godliness means to be like god
[1:06:38] let's put it this way brother branham
[1:06:40] said
[1:06:41] god believes his word
[1:06:58] no matter
[1:07:05] [Music]
[1:07:24] under the nature of god
[1:07:38] you see we're not we're not looking at
[1:07:41] all of this everybody those of us who
[1:07:43] got our eyes and i'm going to show you
[1:07:44] in a moment right in the scriptures
[1:07:47] you know those of us who fail to keep
[1:07:49] our eyes fixed on jesus
[1:07:55] the jesus gonna get
[1:07:57] the man
[1:07:59] the devil is gonna get you the duck
[1:08:00] bumps out of society
[1:08:02] yeah
[1:08:03] you and i must understand
[1:08:06] amen that the scripture says that we
[1:08:08] must keep ourselves you know uh watchful
[1:08:11] through this guy
[1:08:14] what happens with us is that we always
[1:08:17] underestimate
[1:08:19] the devil
[1:08:22] hallelujah we always underestimate him
[1:08:27] devil ain't stupid
[1:08:30] the devil is not stupid
[1:08:32] he's he is the most intelligent
[1:08:37] on the other outsider you understand me
[1:08:39] in his worldly wisdom he don't suggest
[1:08:42] he doesn't trap you
[1:08:44] for peace
[1:08:47] oh yes he will
[1:08:49] he david says that the anointing of god
[1:08:54] is the only thing that would break yes
[1:08:56] and destroy the fowler's snare
[1:08:59] so satan is here to snare you
[1:09:04] one thing he can do he has the ability
[1:09:07] to snare you yeah
[1:09:09] but he can never change who you are
[1:09:12] [Music]
[1:09:14] brother branham says
[1:09:15] in leadership
[1:09:18] he said and that's in 1965
[1:09:21] the choice of your conduct
[1:09:25] he said you you could he said can't mix
[1:09:27] it now
[1:09:29] you're either for god does it swap you
[1:09:32] or against
[1:09:35] and the outward expressions shows
[1:09:38] exactly what's on the inside
[1:09:44] you can't judge me about what i'm
[1:09:46] looking right the way i look that's what
[1:09:48] the prophet is saying
[1:09:50] your outward expression
[1:09:53] hallelujah tells us what's on the inside
[1:09:58] hallelujah
[1:10:03] many of you think
[1:10:05] i've got the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:10:08] i'm going to heaven
[1:10:11] he said that don't mean one thing
[1:10:14] that you're going
[1:10:24] you can have the baptism of the holy
[1:10:25] ghost
[1:10:27] every hour in your
[1:10:31] [Applause]
[1:10:38] and i'm going to get there in just a
[1:10:39] minute see a lot of times we think oh
[1:10:42] i've had an experience but listen that
[1:10:44] don't you cannot stop there
[1:10:48] this is what i'm talking about
[1:10:50] if you are the light of the world
[1:10:52] you are you supposed to express life
[1:11:10] among ourselves
[1:11:16] everything
[1:11:19] and you know how much too much it is
[1:11:36] therefore you're not showing the light
[1:11:38] of
[1:11:57] i wish i could make some of y'all mad
[1:11:58] this morning
[1:12:02] what i'm saying
[1:12:03] i think a lot of time we preach
[1:12:16] [Music]
[1:12:31] you and i and i do these things in love
[1:12:33] because uh
[1:13:01] yeah this is this is this is restoration
[1:13:05] where the alpha becomes the omega
[1:13:09] i'm not talking about in word expression
[1:13:13] hallelujah
[1:13:15] why because the early church walk like
[1:13:18] christ
[1:13:21] so much so that the people call them
[1:13:23] christians
[1:13:24] you know that scripture
[1:13:26] is true
[1:13:28] my question is to you
[1:13:41] [Music]
[1:13:43] is there anybody you know that would
[1:13:44] call you a christian i'm not saying you
[1:13:46] told him oh i am a christian
[1:13:51] and say say like they said
[1:13:53] your speech berate thee
[1:13:55] the way you talk
[1:13:57] gives you away
[1:14:04] hallelujah listen i've had witches
[1:14:06] come to me and they said
[1:14:09] how long you've been saying you're
[1:14:10] committed how long you've been a
[1:14:11] christian i said how
[1:14:39] yeah and like brother branham said
[1:14:40] they're going to you can you can't play
[1:14:42] that down
[1:14:48] and if you don't have power
[1:14:50] or god in you
[1:14:52] you can be in serious trouble
[1:15:02] [Music]
[1:15:06] hallelujah
[1:15:07] is that right is it right when jesus met
[1:15:10] legion what did he say
[1:15:13] call him holy man and have you come to
[1:15:15] do what he sent them to talk about
[1:15:18] us
[1:15:19] before our time
[1:15:20] so the devil knows where he's going
[1:15:23] you need to know where you're going
[1:15:26] hallelujah let me move on by god's grace
[1:15:27] i'm not going to be too much too long
[1:15:31] see
[1:15:32] we we've heard in peter the first peter
[1:15:35] and i'm just going to do a little bit on
[1:15:36] the divine nature because we've had a
[1:15:38] brother come and he's preached a good
[1:15:39] message
[1:15:42] but understand why this have to be
[1:15:47] add to your faith
[1:15:50] faith is that foundation
[1:15:53] you can't even have the holy ghost
[1:15:54] without faith
[1:15:57] quickens the seed quicken something
[1:16:01] every one of those virtues
[1:16:03] is a verb
[1:16:06] it's something you have to do as well
[1:16:10] you're not god ain't going to just you
[1:16:12] know lord just pull me through a tube
[1:16:14] no he's not going to do that
[1:16:16] right now you're being tried
[1:16:45] that's not where god wants us to be
[1:16:47] loved
[1:16:48] i hope you're being blessed this morning
[1:16:51] he said um
[1:16:53] his divine power you can go to first
[1:16:55] peter if you like to follow me there
[1:16:57] his divine power i'm starting at the
[1:16:59] third verse i believe it is
[1:17:01] have given unto us all things
[1:17:04] that pertain
[1:17:06] unto life
[1:17:07] and godliness
[1:17:09] divine
[1:17:16] so you and i must understand
[1:17:19] that his power is his own authority
[1:17:24] his own will
[1:17:26] has given you this
[1:17:28] so
[1:17:33] and i think that's what's happened to a
[1:17:34] lot of people in the massachusetts
[1:17:36] they've been in the message so long
[1:17:38] they have become prideful it's something
[1:17:41] that pride is not a
[1:17:52] right have you ever seen a lamb that was
[1:17:54] prideful
[1:17:56] it doesn't come
[1:18:07] and you're not allowing god to change
[1:18:09] you
[1:18:10] you are
[1:18:24] i'm on
[1:18:36] [Music]
[1:18:47] we've got to come to the perfect statue
[1:18:49] of christ
[1:18:51] such a perfect decree
[1:18:55] hello amen
[1:18:58] and we've got to be
[1:19:00] if you don't say that
[1:19:02] just like rebecca come on come on we got
[1:19:05] to water this camera
[1:19:32] let's see what the prophet did now we
[1:19:34] got one
[1:19:48] was a
[1:20:13] and you had the holy ghost
[1:20:15] you are a real son of god
[1:20:19] see i knew y'all would get quiet
[1:20:22] it shows that somehow your vision has
[1:20:24] been marked
[1:20:25] with power that's what happened to the
[1:20:27] pharisees
[1:20:28] that's what happened to the sadducees
[1:20:30] they had
[1:20:54] hello
[1:20:55] he was in a baptist
[1:20:58] church now if god gonna give him the
[1:21:01] holy ghost while he was in the baptist
[1:21:02] church then anybody else that met with
[1:21:05] those criteria
[1:21:07] that he did
[1:21:08] god the holy ghost
[1:21:10] oh is the truth
[1:21:13] whether we like it or not
[1:21:15] because you must understand
[1:21:17] this is all about election anyway
[1:21:20] it ain't about what you think about it
[1:21:23] is what god has thought about it before
[1:21:24] the foundation of the world
[1:21:26] [Music]
[1:21:52] whether y'all like it or not it's
[1:21:55] to believe the
[1:21:55] first
[1:21:56] because everybody's going trying to tell
[1:21:58] somebody who's going to heaven
[1:22:04] even elijah said lord
[1:22:06] i'm all by myself
[1:22:21] and what day was
[1:22:30] so you and i can see the spirit that
[1:22:31] brings division
[1:22:48] he is then excommunicated
[1:23:03] it's what they do seek your
[1:23:12] i'm not even talking about the world i'm
[1:23:13] not talking about the churches i'm
[1:23:15] talking about
[1:23:22] go ahead y'all better understand what
[1:23:23] i'm trying to say
[1:23:25] he whom the son is set free is free
[1:23:28] indeed
[1:23:30] and where the spirit of the lord is
[1:23:45] i don't
[1:23:47] because i know nobody can put me in
[1:23:48] heaven
[1:23:54] god chose me
[1:23:56] and you know i don't have bishops
[1:24:12] i don't have a famous preacher
[1:24:32] [Music]
[1:24:38] just desiring the presence of the lord
[1:24:42] pride
[1:25:10] i had
[1:25:24] i
[1:25:37] think about it
[1:25:38] if you can't even make it right with
[1:25:40] your brother you've got to ought you
[1:25:41] can't make it right
[1:25:43] don't even thank god
[1:25:46] he's going to let you in the gate
[1:25:50] i'm not saying you're not saying
[1:25:52] but when it
[1:26:11] like brother branham said the closer it
[1:26:14] gets
[1:26:15] to the capstone
[1:26:18] the fewer the numbers
[1:26:31] like that song saying you can talk about
[1:26:33] me as much
[1:26:42] oh lord have mercy let's move on see i
[1:26:45] have to preach it
[1:26:47] i must preach this
[1:26:49] if we're going to go any further
[1:26:52] in this revelation
[1:26:54] we must have character
[1:26:57] you better understand it
[1:27:01] that power without character
[1:27:11] hallelujah that's what denominations do
[1:27:14] this is sick of being healed
[1:27:50] [Music]
[1:27:52] thank you see
[1:27:55] when when when
[1:27:58] paul was talking about the divine nature
[1:28:02] he said it was revealed
[1:28:04] in jesus christ basically what are you
[1:28:06] saying
[1:28:07] what the divine nature
[1:28:10] he put it together
[1:28:12] to show that humanity
[1:28:15] is meant to have
[1:28:18] divine elements
[1:28:21] what do you say we're not here to remain
[1:28:26] natural
[1:28:31] [Music]
[1:28:41] yet we're getting there y'all understand
[1:28:43] me i i get upset sometimes and keep the
[1:28:45] form but you know the thing is i don't
[1:28:47] like that feeling
[1:28:50] and god always checked me
[1:28:52] because i mean make it right make it
[1:28:54] right
[1:29:09] and that pride is not dead yet
[1:29:13] hallelujah but the scripture says
[1:29:15] basically as soon as you fall or come
[1:29:18] short
[1:29:19] you're supposed to do it immediately
[1:29:25] [Music]
[1:29:35] godliness goes beyond
[1:29:40] [Music]
[1:29:49] you don't do this you don't do that you
[1:29:51] know in that denomination i was in you
[1:29:53] couldn't even wear short sleeves
[1:29:59] and when i came to the message and saw
[1:30:01] how the people would dress i thought man
[1:30:02] how can they have such a great
[1:30:04] revelation to be so
[1:30:16] when they asked him how to pray this is
[1:30:31] if i can't do it here
[1:30:43] is that right
[1:30:45] what are you saying
[1:30:46] that's
[1:31:01] hear it
[1:31:02] but those of us who have been born again
[1:31:04] those of us who have had an experience
[1:31:06] you know that what i'm preaching is
[1:31:09] righteousness
[1:31:12] you might not like it but you know it's
[1:31:13] right
[1:31:28] we all
[1:31:32] but those issues we must come to
[1:31:35] how can i say it
[1:31:37] we must come back we become the victors
[1:31:40] we must become the victors
[1:31:42] not the
[1:31:50] you understand me
[1:31:51] is that right right now
[1:31:54] let me ask you a question
[1:31:55] now god is
[1:32:10] you understand what i'm saying you know
[1:32:12] how do you know when you fall in shock
[1:32:15] because you know you're like a
[1:32:17] firecracker
[1:32:20] an explosion
[1:32:21] when something goes wrong
[1:32:32] but we all go through it what are you
[1:32:35] saying brother
[1:32:36] all i'm trying to tell you this morning
[1:32:48] the word that brings you to that place
[1:32:50] of dying to yourself
[1:33:06] god
[1:33:18] your father in heaven is perfect
[1:33:22] hallelujah
[1:33:23] oh how we strive to be that
[1:33:26] but as long as you're in this flesh
[1:33:29] you'll never meet that criteria
[1:33:33] hallelujah
[1:33:34] but
[1:33:37] y'all hear what i'm saying the inner man
[1:33:40] will reach the level of brotherly
[1:33:42] kindness
[1:33:43] hallelujah and then god will come down
[1:33:46] and count
[1:33:48] [Music]
[1:34:15] right
[1:34:42] satan has stolen your joy
[1:34:58] listen there can be no absolute
[1:35:01] perfection in regards to we be in the
[1:35:04] sinful flesh
[1:35:07] because if that was possible was it yeah
[1:35:11] we wouldn't need
[1:35:12] grace zealanders like us
[1:35:15] y'all need great
[1:35:17] who need great focus
[1:35:25] you know it comes to a place and you
[1:35:27] know
[1:35:28] i don't want to go there let me let me
[1:35:29] move on
[1:35:31] how do we come to understand
[1:35:36] what god is requiring schedule one thing
[1:35:39] that god has done for us
[1:35:42] that he didn't do for others
[1:35:45] he gave us a prophet
[1:35:49] and that prophet gave us the word of god
[1:35:53] and that prophet told us exactly what
[1:35:55] god is looking for
[1:35:58] the most mature
[1:35:59] youth
[1:36:01] that god is going to make a curve for
[1:36:02] you
[1:36:04] when you get ready to grade you oh i'm
[1:36:06] going to curb them they're not there yet
[1:36:07] but i'm going to curb them
[1:36:18] that's still young
[1:36:21] and immature
[1:36:22] i'm
[1:36:33] in her image
[1:36:38] so you and i got to understand the weeks
[1:36:40] before we even take god for granted
[1:36:43] we do just what israel did
[1:36:47] god bless them
[1:36:49] they had
[1:36:49] nice clothes
[1:36:51] never wore out shoes that didn't go bad
[1:36:55] real good didn't have to go to the
[1:36:56] hospital and because of all of that
[1:36:59] goodness
[1:37:00] they thought they were saying
[1:37:03] but they couldn't keep their mouth shut
[1:37:09] hello
[1:37:10] and that's the problem
[1:37:11] we can't keep our mouth shut
[1:37:14] we do too much gossiping
[1:37:16] we do too much back fighting
[1:37:18] and i say we cause it goes everywhere
[1:37:21] hallelujah and we fail to see
[1:37:24] all of that murmuring and complaining
[1:37:27] against your character building mount
[1:37:29] sure
[1:37:30] what happened to israel
[1:37:32] they murdered
[1:38:07] and she got upset because she was going
[1:38:08] through a menopause
[1:38:10] and she wanted brother to whip him
[1:38:13] and brother said oh
[1:38:19] she slammed the door in his face
[1:38:22] he said you raising yourself
[1:38:24] hello the prophet
[1:38:28] murmured and complained
[1:38:31] judged her
[1:38:33] went beyond the prophet
[1:38:36] went beyond the prophet
[1:38:38] and told the prophet of god
[1:38:40] go tell her
[1:38:42] i did not
[1:38:57] whenever
[1:38:58] whenever you get out of the purpose of
[1:39:00] god
[1:39:01] you are in trouble
[1:39:03] [Music]
[1:39:08] see but we feel like oh i'm in the
[1:39:10] message
[1:39:18] and that grace keeps him from destroying
[1:39:26] oh i know y'all like it
[1:39:28] everybody's saying amen
[1:39:32] see the revelation of the nature of god
[1:39:35] was received through the knowledge of
[1:39:36] christ
[1:39:38] god in christ
[1:39:41] god in you amen and when god was in
[1:39:44] christ what did you see
[1:39:48] yeah is that right
[1:39:50] jesus said i can't do nothing except the
[1:39:52] father show me
[1:39:55] himself accept and be revealed to me by
[1:39:57] my father
[1:40:00] hallelujah
[1:40:02] and what we need to understand
[1:40:05] yes is that the revelation of god
[1:40:08] through christ
[1:40:09] being manifested
[1:40:11] as jesus come jesus then god comes along
[1:40:15] and he now becomes a son of man
[1:40:19] hallelujah and that
[1:40:21] that son of man
[1:40:23] amen takes on
[1:40:25] the the position of a son of man
[1:40:28] now he revealed that
[1:40:32] it doesn't end there
[1:40:34] because rebecca's feel must be made
[1:40:37] manifest
[1:40:38] hallelujah esther need to be made
[1:40:40] manifest
[1:40:42] hallelujah those women of the bible were
[1:40:44] set there
[1:40:45] as an example
[1:40:47] must be made manifest
[1:40:59] [Music]
[1:41:02] because you got the nature of a cat
[1:41:04] you got the nature of the dog
[1:41:06] the nature of a bird
[1:41:07] you got the nature
[1:41:10] of the lamb you got the nature of a goat
[1:41:13] all those natures are different
[1:41:30] so you cannot have the nature of
[1:41:32] laodicea
[1:41:34] or the nature of the pentecostal church
[1:41:36] going by
[1:41:38] and expect amen god to take you
[1:41:41] when he's looking for a different kind
[1:41:43] of nature
[1:41:49] [Music]
[1:41:57] that god expect
[1:42:11] never will you see a cat and a dog
[1:42:16] the natures are different
[1:42:18] and in order for god to mate with you
[1:42:21] you've got to have a change of your
[1:42:23] nature
[1:42:25] you understand what i'm saying that's
[1:42:27] how serious it is
[1:42:30] you know we can say oh amazing grace it
[1:42:33] is great
[1:42:35] but grace gives you that time in that
[1:42:37] opportunity
[1:42:41] [Music]
[1:42:50] unto us
[1:42:51] exceeding great and precious promise and
[1:42:54] i'm almost done
[1:43:10] you know we we've seen you know through
[1:43:13] william brown's ministry
[1:43:16] blind eyes open
[1:43:18] that wasn't just for him
[1:43:20] that was for you
[1:43:21] that's like reading the woman at the web
[1:43:24] hallelujah the same scenario the same
[1:43:26] thing
[1:43:27] amen we've seen the dead raised
[1:43:31] that wasn't just for william brown
[1:43:33] he did that so you can reflect back
[1:43:35] [Music]
[1:43:36] the
[1:43:50] knew there was a generation that was
[1:43:53] going to come after him
[1:43:55] they needed to believe
[1:43:57] what he was who he was who was in him
[1:44:01] they didn't deceive
[1:44:04] the ungod the god unveiled
[1:44:06] will you deceive believe that christ
[1:44:09] and to know that that same jesus
[1:44:12] same christ
[1:44:14] wanted to occupy their their soul
[1:44:18] that's the
[1:44:21] but you know we like uh how can i say it
[1:44:23] we want to ride alone
[1:44:27] it's not supposed to be that way
[1:44:31] what do you mean
[1:45:00] i remember when i was a pentecostal all
[1:45:02] we thought about was women
[1:45:06] all we thought about was god all we
[1:45:07] thought was church
[1:45:09] we weren't ashamed
[1:45:12] but i find out
[1:45:14] in this message
[1:45:15] people just don't do nothing there's
[1:45:16] only four yeah hallelujah
[1:45:19] but what we do we refer back to william
[1:45:22] branham
[1:45:23] and god tell joshua
[1:45:26] he's dead now we know he's not dead
[1:45:53] is that right
[1:45:54] why you say that
[1:45:56] because everybody was so used that's
[1:45:58] good
[1:45:59] to moses
[1:46:01] is it doing all the miracles
[1:46:03] they don't worry about doing them
[1:46:05] themselves
[1:46:10] you saw what brother branham has done
[1:46:12] so you don't even worry about it ever
[1:46:14] happening again
[1:46:18] but in this day
[1:46:20] the joshua the streets jesus christ
[1:46:24] and he said get
[1:46:46] but now it wasn't just joshua
[1:46:49] joshua and his hosts
[1:46:52] it's no
[1:47:03] we're the army of the lord
[1:47:20] but we
[1:47:22] [Applause]
[1:47:34] the first
[1:48:02] and when god didn't give consent that is
[1:48:04] they prayed for that person
[1:48:06] and they came back to life
[1:48:09] hallelujah that was the will of god
[1:48:12] that's how brother branham did it he
[1:48:15] sought the will of god
[1:48:16] and when the will of god showed him to
[1:48:18] pray for that person he prayed for that
[1:48:20] person and they came back to life
[1:48:24] we don't do it
[1:48:26] we just think you know they're dead and
[1:48:27] they're gone
[1:48:31] am i right or wrong
[1:48:33] people i'm just i love you i'm trying to
[1:48:36] say something here
[1:48:38] you know it may sound rough and it may
[1:48:39] even be fun
[1:48:41] i'm just trying to tell you
[1:48:42] we can't how many all know you can't get
[1:48:44] to heaven like this
[1:48:48] just think about what you are at this
[1:48:50] moment
[1:48:51] and you know and you understand what
[1:48:53] heaven is like
[1:48:56] you said well i'll get there by grace
[1:48:57] but that grace gonna bring you to
[1:48:58] perfection
[1:49:13] i'm gonna cut it short because i said i
[1:49:14] wasn't gonna be long
[1:49:16] but uh let me just let me just uh
[1:49:20] i think that let me add to your faith
[1:49:22] virtue and that you know the knowledge
[1:49:24] and all those foreign we know
[1:49:26] that that nature
[1:49:39] [Music]
[1:49:41] you've got to add those virtues
[1:49:45] right because that that that would bring
[1:49:47] you up the ladder
[1:49:50] right
[1:49:51] and and the bible says now if
[1:49:53] if that life is living in you you you'll
[1:49:56] not be barren
[1:50:00] you understand me
[1:50:02] so you'll not be barren
[1:50:05] you you do you have life
[1:50:07] and that life is going to bring forth
[1:50:08] fruits
[1:50:10] because you got to understand that those
[1:50:12] those virtues are the fruit
[1:50:15] of the life of christ
[1:50:18] amen into play
[1:50:20] now it says if those
[1:50:22] abide in you
[1:50:24] you you won't be barren
[1:50:27] in other words
[1:50:29] something's wrong
[1:50:31] when there is no light
[1:50:33] and no evidence of life
[1:50:35] and we have come to church
[1:50:37] you know we come in like something is
[1:50:39] moving us in the village
[1:50:41] but there is no joy
[1:50:43] there is no peace
[1:50:45] sometimes we come to church so disturbed
[1:50:47] you enter into the king's chamber
[1:50:50] with no respect hallelujah
[1:50:53] you see that was what made random
[1:50:55] tabernacles so powerful
[1:50:58] that they were so respectful
[1:51:00] when they came to the church
[1:51:02] the anointing was already there
[1:51:14] that's true i've been told many times my
[1:51:17] team would come just before
[1:51:47] of what the holy ghost was like
[1:51:51] and and you know it's it's amazing
[1:51:53] because
[1:51:54] i used to ask them
[1:51:56] how can you take this now
[1:51:59] when the anointing was so great being
[1:52:00] here
[1:52:11] couple of weeks ago i came in here and i
[1:52:12] felt such a void it scared me so bad
[1:52:15] i couldn't even get it out of my mind
[1:52:17] it was it was god was not happy
[1:52:22] and it seems like death was in the house
[1:52:25] i'm telling you what i felt
[1:52:27] and i asked the brothers and all had
[1:52:28] they felt the same thing
[1:52:30] they felt the same thing it literally
[1:52:32] scared me
[1:52:33] because i have never in my preaching
[1:52:36] life
[1:52:41] i pray it never comes back
[1:52:59] now what
[1:53:01] no evidence of life no fruits
[1:53:06] i watched the song leaders today singing
[1:53:10] don't tell me you don't know english a
[1:53:11] lot of y'all know english now
[1:53:17] i'm on somebody it was worse than a
[1:53:19] methodist church
[1:53:24] i came in and they looked like they were
[1:53:25] drunk off a new wine
[1:53:31] no wine was served
[1:53:33] what comes i need to sell you no that's
[1:53:36] the way
[1:53:37] that's the way y'all carried on
[1:53:53] but we're not recognizing
[1:53:55] we invited him
[1:53:57] he got here on time
[1:54:00] he was here when you got here
[1:54:03] before you got here
[1:54:04] he was here waiting
[1:54:06] and he
[1:54:19] because people he's worthy of praise
[1:54:23] your actions shows
[1:54:25] how much in love you are with him
[1:54:31] but let me go on because i'm almost to
[1:54:32] the point where i'm trying to come too
[1:54:36] [Music]
[1:54:43] let me see and i guarantee you most of
[1:54:45] y'all will be moving
[1:54:56] see everybody smile different smile
[1:54:57] cause y'all know i'm right
[1:54:59] right
[1:55:02] we'll just pretend you got dinner
[1:55:08] what are you afraid of listen god want
[1:55:10] you to be you oh
[1:55:11] victory
[1:55:13] yes he wants you to be if you enjoy you
[1:55:16] know
[1:55:41] i came to a church that only had 13
[1:55:43] people
[1:56:10] hallelujah and during that season
[1:56:23] 90 of the church was white
[1:56:28] and black folks was coming
[1:56:31] and everybody else was coming
[1:56:33] to see what had happened to this term
[1:56:36] i'm just trying to tell you so you can't
[1:56:38] put it on color
[1:56:48] there were times that some of the young
[1:56:49] children saw jesus they said
[1:56:52] they saw jesus in the church
[1:57:01] and most of those uh young men are
[1:57:03] preachers and pastors now
[1:57:08] because we were
[1:57:13] [Music]
[1:57:15] let me tell you something you believe it
[1:57:17] right it would produce work exactly
[1:57:20] [Music]
[1:57:34] they even took a picture of what they
[1:57:35] call it
[1:57:50] that disease
[1:58:05] this message this message is it it's
[1:58:08] beyond anything
[1:58:10] you know what i'm just that kind of way
[1:58:13] brother brandon said
[1:58:14] when you gave him a a piece of the pie
[1:58:18] some of the watermelon there's got to be
[1:58:19] more of it
[1:58:21] it's got to be more of it
[1:58:23] give me some more
[1:58:24] that's my hunger for it this is thomas i
[1:58:26] gotta have more
[1:58:28] it's got to be more than a letter
[1:58:31] it's gotta be more
[1:58:32] it's
[1:58:42] because you got to understand by having
[1:58:43] this restored this thing is being
[1:58:45] restored
[1:59:14] because
[1:59:26] and that's all i'm saying is that if we
[1:59:28] don't buckle down and get really serious
[1:59:31] with god
[1:59:34] left behind
[1:59:38] nobody but your fault
[1:59:40] so let me explain this predestination
[1:59:42] just for a moment
[1:59:44] predestination is also based upon your
[1:59:46] own decision
[1:59:50] hallelujah
[1:59:51] will god predestinated me to be the
[1:59:53] bride
[1:59:54] in his mind you must have done those
[1:59:57] made those right choices
[2:00:02] y'all understand me because he don't
[2:00:03] force it he doesn't force anything on
[2:00:06] you
[2:00:07] hallelujah so if you don't make the
[2:00:09] right this is your hour
[2:00:24] he
[2:00:45] [Music]
[2:00:54] [Music]
[2:01:29] he said and have forgotten
[2:01:31] that he was purged from his old sins she
[2:01:47] that you're not
[2:01:48] the characteristics are not in you
[2:01:49] acrylic actors see your belief becomes a
[2:01:52] religion now
[2:01:54] oh i'm in the message
[2:01:56] chances are
[2:01:58] you may fall back
[2:02:00] to the things you were
[2:02:01] healed from
[2:02:16] that god has a place in you
[2:02:18] hallelujah amen amen
[2:02:23] but one thing for certain
[2:02:25] god always give us a place for
[2:02:26] repentance
[2:02:44] and i looked up that word monument
[2:02:47] it is a building or a structure
[2:02:51] erected to commemorate
[2:03:24] let's put it this way
[2:03:26] how can i put
[2:03:40] is
[2:03:54] i'll leave it there just meditate on god
[2:03:58] but anyhow let's move on i'm almost done
[2:04:01] building the stretch you see it starts
[2:04:03] off with the foundation stone constructs
[2:04:07] that you've wasted
[2:04:21] then they're waiting for the headstone
[2:04:26] which is love
[2:04:28] but god is love
[2:04:30] and he controls he controls and he is
[2:04:32] the strength
[2:04:34] of every one of these things
[2:04:39] so how are you going to make it if you
[2:04:40] don't know
[2:04:43] and i i brought this down
[2:04:45] i can't i'm i'm close with this
[2:04:48] forgive me for lying i didn't mean to do
[2:04:49] that
[2:04:50] i will
[2:05:01] if a man say
[2:05:03] i love god
[2:05:05] and hateth his brother
[2:05:07] he is a liar
[2:05:10] for he that loveth not his brother
[2:05:13] whom he hath seen
[2:05:16] how can he love god whom he
[2:05:30] and this commandment
[2:05:32] have we from him
[2:05:35] that he who loveth god
[2:05:38] loves his brother
[2:05:44] one more scripture two more together
[2:05:47] first john 1 5.
[2:05:51] this then is the message
[2:05:54] we which we have heard of him
[2:05:56] and declared unto you
[2:05:58] that god is light
[2:06:00] and in
[2:06:14] but this is the message that you heard
[2:06:16] from the beginning
[2:06:18] that we love one another
[2:06:26] do i have it right
[2:06:42] he

[2:06:57] problems
[2:07:00] and i'm going to tell you how you know
[2:07:01] you've got this problem
[2:07:05] when you see them
[2:07:07] and you get this strange feeling it was
[2:07:09] advanced and it's not one of joy and
[2:07:11] happiness
[2:07:12] that means you got a problem
[2:07:15] with that individual
[2:07:16] and that means you need to get that
[2:07:18] straight
[2:07:20] and the bible says like
[2:07:22] if you think
[2:07:24] a brother has a
[2:07:36] that maybe
[2:07:37] i'll say it like this it's really
[2:07:39] difficult many of you have come from
[2:07:40] churches that were so large
[2:07:46] certain things were not attended
[2:07:50] attended to yeah
[2:07:52] certain things were taken care of
[2:07:56] i mean what you understand what i mean
[2:07:58] these little things that i'm preaching
[2:08:01] it may seem like it's not a value but
[2:08:03] it's very important
[2:08:06] the
[2:08:30] but i know
[2:08:31] just say
[2:08:32] i use
[2:08:34] just trouble in my own family
[2:08:38] my grandchildren to tell you
[2:08:41] when i misjudged them
[2:08:44] i go back and i tell ask for their
[2:08:46] forgiveness
[2:08:51] even even my children maybe his own
[2:08:53] phone it may take a little while with my
[2:08:54] children
[2:08:57] but i always go back and ask for their
[2:08:59] forgiveness
