farmer and brother cliff farmers dad just his mom but anyway just glad to have you here by the grace of God glad to have everybody here tonight this is our Wednesday crowd hey we keep the scripture where two or three are gathered and we're so thankful that we have as many as we have because you know many are falling away many are getting tired so many things are happening now and I'm grateful to be one in the number Amen when you love God you make the sacrifice that's just the way I see it and like I said we're living in a time where I don't know it's just whenever like Brenda Lewis you say don't let this gospel become common to you don't let it become common because when it become common you begin to act common and we're not common people as such amen as we stand let us turn to the Word of God we're going to be coming from Luke seventh chapter 47 through the 48th verse and Romans 14:17 Luke 7 47 to 48 wherefore I say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is forgiven the same loveth little let me go read that again wherefore I say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but whom little is forgiven the same loveth little and he sent it to her thy sins are forgiven Romans 14:17 for the kingdom of God is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost let us pray Lord we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for being so good to us Lord you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves we pray father God that you would bless this service in a special way break and destroy the yokes of the enemy and father will be careful to give you the praise the glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated as we were saying earlier you and I we have been ministering and actually working together where we can see our identity where we come from where we're going so important to understand your origin and last week we talked about that circle that is eternal we call it eternal life if you came from there you go back there we showed you by the grace of God how that every River every ocean wherever it starts it goes back everything makes its circle amen even so the scripture says there's nothing new Under the Sun that which is already been has been that which is now has already been so you and I understand if the Bible said there is nothing new Under the Sun what we think is new our technology our computers our mathematics and all that we do there's nothing new this thing has what we we're looking at has already been done and we must understand that the people in the days of Noah was far more intelligent than what we are and so therefore God wiped away everything and made us start all over again but there is nothing new amen we we must understand by God's grace that what God is doing why are we here what is what is God doing if we want to see what he's doing we we go back to the book of Genesis and we see that God wanted a family he had as brother madam said he had angels and seraphim's and cherubim but in him he wanted to be a father he wanted to be a savior he wanted to be you know a deliverer he all of these attributes were in him even brother branham said it like this he said that God in the way that he was he'll never return back to that in other words he has come back to a place a man in Jesus Christ where he will reign and rule forever I think is in the future home where the man talked about Christ sitting on the throne and he talks about that pillar of fire that'll be above his head you see because God the Elohim the self-existing one is the creator of all things and you and I must understand by God's grace that we are part of the family of God what Adam bypassed Jesus came to restore back to us because once the seals were open we understand the Prophet telling us that we go back to the day before the fall hello in other words if you can believe it if you can receive it this Holy Spirit gospel brings us back to a place before the fall because you must understand that this generation or this group of people that have been chosen and elected by God has been justified as though you never sinned in the first place if you can believe it you and I can really see God on the move but what we must understand is that when the Holy Ghost comes upon a man or woman he wipes away the guilt consciousness hallelujah in other words the days of being guilty is over by because you recognize the positive part of the word you and him hallelujah you are accepted in him now you and I must understand though we make mistakes in the eyes of God we stand sin-free the Bible said blessed is the man whom God will not impute ha that God will not charge sin now understand me now the Bible said if you say you have no sin you make God a liar but understand the blood of Jesus Christ that covers you that hides your failures that hides your thoughts and because you are a true son and daughter of God you make confession not in hope but in faith that God has already heard and answered your prayer now this is what brings joy if you don't have the Holy Ghost see the Holy Ghost would testify to these things the Holy Ghost bring peace y'all know a piece is there's no battle in peace it's peace right and you and I must understand the Holy Ghost brings what righteousness we became he became our sin that we might become the righteousness of God understand if you don't take the scripture in the light of what I'm trying to tell you you will always battle to the end which takes away your peace because you and I must understand we are accepted in the beloved not in what you do though it is important to do the righteous thing the Holy Ghost will cause you to live holy the Holy Ghost would cause you to live a righteous is that right the Holy Ghost will bring what joy you don't have we go to church and people don't enjoy the joy of the Holy Ghost no more I love the singing I love the shouting I love the dancing I mean if you want to do a cartwheel that's fine with me but the one is you need to understand that the joy of the Holy Ghost goes beyond that all of that's good but the joy of the Holy Ghost is the power of God living in you is that right the public God tells us in the Hebrews chapter 2 6 and 2 he says listen we are then perfect through Christ and we are free from judgment through Christ and we don't believe that we are free from judgment through Christ we should be the most happiest people on the face of the earth don't let the devil steal your joy hallelujah believe God trust him I was telling the brother that the other day I said you know what I trust God every time the devil try to put things on me and make me look bad and you know I said Lord I trust you you said you will complete this work it's not him that will it no he that runneth but God who shows mercy right and we are free from judgment through Christ we shall never die through Christ we have lost death and found life through Christ not through it in church not through any denomination not through any fantastic not through speaking with tongues not through shouting not through shaking not through dancing in the spirit but by grace God calls who he will and is all by election he's the one building the kingdom he's the one setting the stones in place hallelujah amen and if God has called you and has set you in place you ought to be happy every stone is cut in such a way my stone is cut from every but different way than all of us everybody stone is cut in us in a strange way but at the same time when God put us together whoo that's right it's perfect hallelujah God calls who he will and it's all by election we find out we find out that it's not him that wants to be saved whoo not him that willing or him that runneth is God that showed mercy and no man can come to Jesus except God draws him first so what you got to do with it anyhow you haven't got nothing to do with it you're out of the picture all together thank you Jesus how do you when you're out of the picture out of somebody's happy tonight because we have been fighting all day and I'm trying to take just to hit the head off that devil tonight because I want you to realize that man he is a liar from the beginning he can't stop what God has started and you're part of it it's never been your goodness has never been my goodness though we do our best to be good is that right oh come on the rich young ruler say good master and Jesus said there's only one that's good and that's God hallelujah if there's everyone if there ever is a goodness is the good God in you hmm think about it God and I took this woman at Simon's house because her sins were many but Jesus said those are the kind that really loves me when they realize that they've been wretched and you know like Paul said you know I'm a wretched sinner I'm the chief of all sinners a brother didn't like me saying that one time he said only ponca see there that's hey Paul going he's where he's at but in this age I can say it right because I know the kind of a person I was before God changed me every one of us can say it hallelujah yeah we can fight for first place because all of us realize amen how wicked we were whether we did or not we thought it we imagined it we did a lot of things and God changed at all not because you want a God to change you is because God wanted to change you it's not him that will it like the Prophet God said all I want to be saved there's many that wants to be saved but this salvation come by election and not by the will of man only by the will of God hallelujah and for you and I to sit here we are to be able to accept this is the will of God we have ears to hear blessed is those people who have ears to hear somebody help me here how would anybody turn away from this message I don't understand it there's just so many things I don't understand and I don't even try to understand it this this message give us such great Liberty it's Esav sets us free hallelujah it takes the burdens of weary away and you know we've we fret I had so many situation coming at me this week all I could do is says lord I trust him I kept prayers and lord I trust him is that right he moved this one out the way he moved that one out the way he moved this without the way and all I could say is Lord I thank you that's what you got to do when things get so contrary and there's nothing you can do he is expecting you to trust him is that the Bible when Moses saw it was out of his hands what did he have to do trust God hallelujah is that right when sham God saw it was out of his head all he could do was trust God if God be with us where be all the mirror don't get me wrong I believe that every son and daughter of God should be experiencing miracles signs and wonders and everything else and brother Branham said it like this if miracle if signs are excuse me signs and wonders are not following you he say you not even Christian you don't believe in other words you don't believe we are supernatural people I'm so tired of these Christians living in such a natural way real supernatural and we are supposed is the inheritance of the Saints that we see God move in a supernatural way hallelujah listen really that lady that sister you know when God said her freed the Bible said he if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed how many of us freed it tonight free you got to be free I don't care if the devil seemed like he's holding you down you're free he's the one that's deceived not you is that right oh the devil might even think he's gonna send you to hell he can't let my told you last week he'll is blocked the door is locked because Jesus has to keep devil don't have no keys not even to his own house and when you go you can't go there because the door is locked to the righteousness of God yeah I'm telling you a true believer can't go there because Jesus has already gone for you and he locked the door he has the keys and if Satan wanted you there he can't open the door hallelujah why because the blue prevail I showed you by the grace of God how did when Moses put the blood on the doorpost and the little that death angel had to pass by he didn't even have a key to open the door he couldn't penetrate the door he couldn't go on around it over it because the blood of Jesus Christ she'll do me that's how it is with our lives right now the death and you would love to have us but he cannot have us because the blood blocks him hallelujah glory to God you love the Lord the making of his kingdom he's trying to get us to see you know and we fail sometimes how often did the children of his uh his disciples failed remember when they was on their own the sea and the sea began to roar in the water became again to come in and you know Jesus was there sleeping Peter win over her doubt not that we perish I can see myself some time I bid for him I may have not other those words but I've been there Lord where are you he's responding the same way he's did then ye of little faith you know we don't get out of it he tells us just like it is you don't mean because listen God had already given him the authority of the word speak it right sometimes people say oh you've got to have fearless Thunderbolt and all this kind of stuff but you see the problem is we dis we don't stay connected connection is what we need we must stay in connected to the Holy Spirit when you are it connected with the Holy Spirit you're not a cold iron you take that on and you plug that baby up to that electricity it gets pretty hot hallelujah is that right and they have those little dials on there where you can regulate the temperature if you want to just medium you can get it if you want hot and steamy you can get it you have the button you have the regulations right you can determine on how hot you want to get you turn it up God is game of giving you the power I like the idea of a steam I love steam I remember in the days we used to have little bottles we had to spray you know your time we took water and sprinkle it just before we can I now we got the island st lush I like to hit that button I like to hit it you know it's because you and I must understand the Holy Spirit is that way he wants to use us just like that hallelujah but the only way you can be in arm but you got to be plugged into the power hallelujah listen the truth of the matter is we we fail to see Amen that this yeah I'm so tired of going to churches or places and they says waste God we got the Holy Ghost in you there's no joy don't even feel the atmosphere the Holy Spirit you know it where is God you know you and your and I'm not supposed to come to he come here to get warmed up he's supposed to bring your fire right Amen the so leaders should never have to struggle we supposed to come in here but but but you know what you've heard me say this a lot of time we come just like in my family I got eight kids some of them are givers and some of them are takers and that's how it is in God some people oh lord give me this Oh Lord give me that and there are some people they just give God here not here's the play oh you understand me they always giving God never looking for returns and that's when God those are the kind God gives without asking what what that woman came in the timer's house and Berlin says she elbowed her way through the crowd I believe she did it she airport away to the crowd she was a giver but she got to Jesus as you began to worship Him she began to wash his feet she began to touch to minister to him and brother them say you minister to the word you've entertained Jesus when you praise him oh that's to Pentecostal for you but let me have your nun ting if you don't want it pour it on me you know what I'm saying because we don't have to teach his water this thing down so bad - people don't even know how to praise God hallelujah mr. truth we supposed to be on fire and they tell her that's too much it's never too much what fire you know somebody can stand still in hallelujah everybody I ever seen jump you know something goes on hallelujah so you not must understand the joy when you lose your joy it shows you haven't been connected then in his presence is fullness of joy and hide his right hand there are powers blessings forevermore that's right you and I must understand when you are in the presence of God there has to be joy joy is there no joy in the midst of sorrow that's when it's good but we got too many excuses now people are so distracted you know they don't understand it's not a time to be distracted you got to fight that devil back you know what I'm saying you just can't let him walk all over you and just have you all busy that busyness will cause you to miss it hello it will what you think the devil get all these gadgets and everything in this age he wants to get the people so distracted they forget what they're supposed to be doing God has called you to the statue of a perfect man hallelujah and in that is a lot of work suffering oh yeah understand that Jesus said except you take up your cross and follow me you can no eyes be my disciple except a man lose his life you and I must lose our life the brother prophet God said we must not only dive a lot hallelujah he was talking about his sister the other day he his I won't call her name but anyway it's on tape he said she was still putting on a little bit of makeup and he she used to clip and I had he said see she found out she wasn't completely dead yet yes you do these little things you're not completely dead yet and in order to get the Holy Ghost you've got to be dead and rotted emptied out and you just don't want it on your spirit you want it in the soul and then when you get there you wanted to grow up into Christ's ambition I aim is to grow up into Christ be more like our Father be more like him that's our earnest desire every day I don't care if you fall the bible said of just man falls seven times in the day but he gets back up get on up that's what he wants us to do the devil don't understand but i'ma tell you there's a driving force in me and there's a driving force in you no matter what comes your way it ain't giving up yet giving up there's no turning back there's no turning around I don't care if it is by inch we're gonna make this journey hallelujah little by little we're gonna make this journey hallelujah well god help us mark eight it's God making his king is he's building his kingdom you're part of it I'm a part of it it's so wonderful we don't have much time here don't y'all do y'all really think God will be so unjust to not give us some more anointing to make the journey and a lot of people don't Oh the revival is over the revival it maybe yours is hallelujah but I know the law of God the law of God said if there's a deep call there's a deep to respond God and go have us first remove him and not give it to us he said if you ask for bread do you think I give you a serpent nonsense he's got us calling and calling and he's just waiting for that moment to respond he will respond we're not going out here without his hung down ain't no way no way he's making you he is building you right I look at those quotes but them says you know when when God Christ is in you you are nipper tunt and we forget don't we forget it we just forget that we are an impotent that means all power a and Satan has done so how come he's overcoming us now when I say oh I'm just generalizing it it ain't that see without faith it's impossible to please God you've got to have faith that omnipotent is in you you must believe it and even on nipple journey is in you that means the ability to create is in you that means the ability to stop the devil wherever he is is in you it's in you I remember the time brother Branham was down in Mexico somewhere in the baby had cancer of the mouth or something anyway they went to operate on the baby and and the devil really got mad and angry and swirl the baby everything up and brother branham was waiting on something then the Holy Ghost came to him says but but I'm waiting on you sometimes we wait on God for a move-on word or vision or something and God said but I'm waiting on you is that right oh he said to Moses why do you cry and speaking I've already given you the authority I've given you the word what could you handle this it's yours and whenever you and I handle the word by faith and sided off in Jesus name brother Branham sitting like this he said it's no longer Jesus is no longer your prayer it becomes Jesus prayer how can it fail hey somebody it cannot fail mark 8:34 338 you don't have to turn there and when he had called to the people unto him with his disciples also he said unto them whosoever shall come will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel the same shall save it Holly yeah what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and loses so Oh what shall a man give in exchange for his soul you know it's the truth you know people who use their excuses oh I work I work I work and they fail to come to the house of God to say thank you Lord you understand me the barber said he here ten lepers and only one came back to say thank you and here God provide jobs and everything else for people and they work with strength and help every day and they fail to give God an hour - of thank you nonsense it just doesn't make sense and yet you say I'm a Christian always give thanks the Bible said always give things somebody help me I tell you what you and I realize that one thing it is the grace of God that's gonna really save this bride hallelujah right now with the natural eye she ain't looking too bright I made that word up but anyway she just don't look it how do you look brightest I'll tell you how you do it they call them Christian at Antioch huh cuz they look like it they act like him the power God was with them just like it was with him signs and wonders followed them hallelujah but we find that what even in even in among us is becoming a shell is just becoming a form of godliness and God is not pleased God want to see action in the church it doesn't matter if you're young or old David was a young boy into a giant Josiah was a young man and he became a great king so it's not just just old people young to have faith in God God told Timothy Timothy through Paul don't let no despise your youth hey that's the way they did me I'm telling you young people you know they always told me when I was young when I was young but they said to me oh that's not necessary you're fanatic this has told me that you're too much I was telling the brother the other day I'm still too much I can't help it and I don't want to stop at hallelujah if anybody know he needs grace I know it thank God for every bit I could get you what shall a man give in exchange for his soul whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with the Holy Angels if you are saying to be a Christian God would be a shame of you hallelujah amen it is nothing but the truth hallelujah is that right in Luke 6:46 I'm coming and wicked and why call you me Lord Lord and do not the things which I say woo whosoever cometh to me and here's my saying do it them I will show you to whom he is like he is like a man which built in house dig deep and laid the foundation on the rock and when the rock or when the flood arose and the stream beat vehemently upon that house and could not shake it but it was founded upon a rock so that's why everybody else is falling they didn't dig deep enough hallelujah they didn't hit the rock brother they hit everything but the rock if they had only seen God behind the veil of that little Kentuckian that it wasn't just a man if they had seen that that was God for our day to show us this is what you are to be hallelujah it ain't just looking at the Prophet is showing us who we ought to be when Christ feels you you ought to have the same dynamics we are super Church and until you believe you are super just let me tell you something you keep believing that whether you see anything or not abraham believed god and it was counted and imputed unto him as righteousness he believed what God said he didn't see he believed it though you don't have to see just believe it and God will bring it to pass hallelujah oh my god but he that heareth them do it not it's like a man that without a foundation built and house upon the earth I was telling somebody the other day I think they asked Jesus Christ know what what kind of what work what kind of work what kind of righteousness what what must be what must we do he said believe on Him whom God has sent that's your righteousness believe on Him whom God has sent that's how you make it because if you believe on him you're gonna do what he says you're gonna look you go you're gonna live it hallelujah what works what we work but we must do and that's what everybody what works I'm gonna tell you what works believe on Him whom God has said hallelujah that's your works and God will impute that as righteousness will somebody help me Corner Hebrews 11 and eight by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should have to receive an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went somebody come on come on now you know so many people they don't understand it you know when I move when I moved from South Carolina up to Ohio people thought I was insane then but I'm Abraham see haha you know saying I go where he leads me hallelujah when I left there I had preachers I hide you gonna go over there they don't have enough money they don't have time enough people can't do this this enough let me tell you something he's never failed yeah hallelujah why it ain't about the money I told people I said let me tell you something if God sent me here take care of me hallelujah uh-huh I've never doubted yet I know he sent me here never daughter yet will not doubt right what storm God has vindicated himself too much here all kind of everybody and he got testimonies of healing and deliverance isn't any way let me move on see because faith when God speaks there's no way to explain it you don't even know how to tell somebody why are you doing what you do it you just know is a revelation is something that's taking place in you and you got to do it and you do it you move and God moves right because whenever you move by the Spirit of God he's right there to vindicate it is that right the property God said God won't vindicate a lie and he vindicates it he got vindicates it my face he served running the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob the heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which has foundations whose builder and maker is God hallelujah come on somebody he looked forward but were you brand visited he took a land he saw laying ah where the building the building that the buildings were were of God oh he didn't see no Krueger store he saw millions of people ye are the terrible temple of God you're the tabernacle of God he's building you right now hallelujah when God when John said the New Jerusalem ride the Lambs wife when she came down she had all these jewels don't you see people of God all I said this before all those jewels represent overcoming bride every stone I got a piece of a house hallelujah why because whatever color whatever stone I am I'm in there it's scriptural huh Aaron's breastplate typed out the tribes when they overcame they cross the Jordan bring them twelve stones build build a pyramid hallelujah what I'm saying it was God always doing things like that and then Peter said you are the living stones lively stone huh come on somebody praise the name of the Living God Psalms a minute twenty seven and four and then ah he says one thing I've desired of the Lord I can feel it I know what he's talking about he said that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to enquire in his temple come on David what for in a time of trouble he shall hide me simple say that's trusting that's the rapture with these tribulations and everything began to happen God will hide us hallelujah we don't go through this like nor did we go up Enoch hmm he go hot the prophet of God said before one bomb drop we go you know I try my best not get into all this new stuff I'm like Oh Lord the Word of God is so right we're living in Babylon everybody's confused everybody is so messed up fighting and you know and come on don't you realize what we're seeing right now is just before the great fall that's what we see all those confused and everything that's fighting and everything else goes search history that's what wrong did Greek and all of them they fought over power and this and that and this will be the great winner hey and what happened the enemy while they were doing that here come the enemy you we used to be loved by the world America's hated by the world now they're laughing at us in my travel they used to respect Americans now they abuse us I got I went I went to England one time and he stopped me from coming I'll go stop me from coming in the Holy Spirit said now he gonna give you a rough time talk to me just like a net I heard him I was okay I got up there and that man gave me a rough time so I kept stealing the holy get Holy Spirit say don't don't say no keep your mouth shut yes sir no sir yes sir you're right sir he had to let me go even when he didn't want to he said yeah y'all Americans give us a hard time and I'm gonna give you a hard time he was with it put on my passport you can't come back in here for three years I think it was yeah because he said oh you need a work permit and I didn't have one I'm not here for work oh are you gonna preach if they let me you preach I say yeah he said what did they buy your ticket how could that matter you know that devil was working I said yes sir they did see but they see now that's what you're wrong anyway to make a long story short I got in and got out it was God's will so you look at these things and you say oh brother what are you trying to say right now you must recognize that nothing matters more than card in you every bit of darkness has to go and you're gonna have to pray that you have not because you ask not if you keep asking God to deliver you from whatever darkness and you he will deliver you right it must go if not you still got some positive you still living God don't need you not that part is that right listen Matthew 22 he says then said he to his servants the wedding is ready but they which were bidden we're not worthy you know I'm saying it like this I'm trying to do a much scriptures I can because I know there are people who are listening and and they probably more than likely taking down notes and here's a go ye therefore into highways and as many as you find bid to the marriage so those servants went out into the highway and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guests and when the king came to see the guests he saw the hurt there was a man which had not a wedding comment now we know the wedding garment is the Holy Spirit hello it is the virtues of God Christ nature that's own display in Moses day it was just the chemistry blood in this day it is the life of the blood when I see the token I'll pass over you not the chemistry the life when I see that life I will pass over you right I heard the Prophet God's sake that the devil cannot do anything to you until you get out of the will of God you become vulnerable so stay under the blood folks so those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found but the bad and the both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with gas hey both bad and good why because God slipped a robe on him that was the thing that covered everything hallelujah bad angered you had to say Rolla Bolla that Holy Spirit amen covered you who hired me Oh God and when the king came to see the guests he saw that there a man which had not a wedding garment and he said unto Him friend how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment and he was speechless then the king of the servant servants bind him hand and foot take him away and cast him into outer darkness and there shall be weeping in king of teeth now we always thought that was hell but that's not that's the true relation period hmm for as many a car meant for many are called but few are chosen can I go a little further try not to be too much too long too much longer Luke 14 21 through 2033 so that the service came and showed his Lord these things then the master of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor and the maim and the halt and the blind you see what brothers why are you reading this because brother Branham told us he said when you see all Roberts people and Billy Graham's people they will all be all dressed up he said but my people would be on crutches weird he was that one God told him to go out go in there get the whole the main the lane right because the church world did did made excuses they didn't want to come so God start hitting the hedges in the house oh my god right in our day that's why you here cuz he was he was nobody there somebody will reject he may go out quickly in the street in lanes of the city and bringing here to the poor in the name in the halt in the blind and literally said and the servant said Lord servant not servants in the message of the love of our worker he brings that out he was that servant he had that Ministry of the lane of the highways and the byways and all of that bring them all in showing that we're right at the coming of the Lord when this portion of the scripture is fulfilled and somebody I feel like I feel pretty good why the lordís servant go out into the highways hedges and compel them to come in compare with a little you know come on man come on yes you're trying to persuade them right bring them in bring them in yeah cuz you know I sometime if you make somebody man that's a good thing when you preach in the gospel or teaching the gospel that is a good thing make a man because they won't forget it gotta have something to work with right I can't believe he says so I so so so they remember it and then God can say use that same scripture and work with him he can heat down the road he gonna say but you know they're right hallelujah or he gonna say W I said well you need to go in that scripture and prove them wrong oh praise God get them in the scripture god that's the way you want him you want him to go in there because by the time the Holy Ghost finished with them they'll be convinced and being concerned hallelujah let me go on here listen God says listen father said to you none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper come on folks and you know it's the truth every one of those great leaders in the profit of God's day had no idea what they were refusing and here they were in the scripture lost the blind leaders lead the blind come on because of their decision they took a whole group of people with them from the time they rejected the gospel to the time that they preached it now y'all see what I'm saying and only the righteous will escape there are those who will escape but those who who trust in a bishop trust in the church trust in a system to save them they're lost I know what I'm talking about I was in that kind of a thing but I needed you see what I'm saying it's a footrace inhale right is this okay none of those bins were bidden shall taste of my supper think about a great man of God with all kinds of signs and wonders following them but chosen to be that kind of a vessel there was a great multitude with him and he turned and said unto them if any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters yang and his own life also he cannot be my disciples is that right and the prophet of God said is true he said many people were mystery after because of their family it's in their mystery after because within their families every time first the first since I heard that I said O God have mercy have mercy have mercy have mercy keep me right before you O Lord is true you said what do you mean well let me say it like this if Lord had looked back he would have been dead but is why because of her family she looked back and you and I must understand by God's grace amen there's no time you can't compromise it ain't no time for that no compromising they're going to either love you or hate you and Jesus said they're gonna hate you so let's go with it when you live writers they gonna hate you they don't love you they go that my family think I'm crazy I've been thinking that for years I'm crazy until they need money it's a - y'all know what the truth who's no they're not various cops come help them B cannot be my disciples for which of you intending to build a tower setting not down first and counted the cost whether he has sufficient to finish it I'm saying this because Jesus Christ is speaking of do you think God call you into this word knowing that he's going to lose it you know you're one of those stones that's gonna slip from the model or whatever oh no no he already count you in from the foundation of the world he knew exactly where you were going to fit in exactly right in the building of his kingdom listen we all are not great we're not all casting out Devils we're not all speaking in tongues but every junk we fit together we fit together every little joint fits together that alright I'm almost done let me read this quickly in the seal of God but then said jesus said a man went out and he worked and another man went out in another hour and he worked another man went out and worked and one man went out at the eleventh hour and when he stopped at the eleventh hour he give every one of them the same portion the eleventh hour they wondered why why did he got the eleventh hour everyone coming in Martin Luther that worked worked under Luther's dispensation died and grace others shouting met others shouting Methodists that died on the Wesley age died and grace we're living in another age not back there here but mother used to go in an ox cart and we go in a model v8 Ford almost jet propelled that's right we're living in a different age all together and we're living in a different dispensation we're living in the day of the restoration of the power of God see that that's not that that gets me statements like that we're living in the restoration of the power of God and right here see the power of God like they did in the beginning we're living in another age don't look back there - Wesley Methodists or all the other Baptists a Presbyterian look here - Jesus Christ the author and finisher of our faith the of the Bible hallelujah now watch him said hold it until what the 11-hour people come in the last calling of the gentiles now I love that I love that because that was world war one that God held back for you when the world the earth should have been destroyed the angels were ready it wasn't just for the Jews it was for the bride the 11th hour workers love of our level month level day Levant everything and to this day they don't know who stopped the war we can tell them God did why all these years have gone by did you know and I always tell people this I said don't you understand I said if those people who followed the Prophet at the time that they did if God had not allowed things to happen to throw him off track the rapture would have taken place Oh y'all don't believe that but it did they murmur it complain they fought among each other you shouldn't they did God told him look at the stone wait I'll get back they interpret the stone and with their own way that's why we saw many interpretations of this message because they didn't stay there like they should have hallelujah you understand me and so you look at these things you know what what worry brother it's the same thing God allowed Israel to do until rehab was mature it's for us he held Israel up 40 years I don't even think we had was 40 years old I don't know how old she was but she was still pretty yeah gggg is that right she had to be there when they came to the land you have to be here every name on the book must be made manifest we're not going nowhere until that last name is made manifest now faces the last coming of the Gentiles mother worked their daddy and then worked their grandmother worked back there this this is our age the eleventh hour the world war stopped on the eleventh month in the eleventh year the eleventh day of the month the eleventh hour in the day and the 11th minute in the hour that's the eleventh what people might come in what to receive the same baptism of the Holy Ghost that they did back there in the beginning I don't want a counterfeit don't give me a counterfeit give me the real deal see that's what's happening now in this world there's a lot of people receiving the counterfeit tell me in the scripture where Jesus they say I'm show you how to get electra-twist is the scripture if you just received Jesus in your heart receive him in your heart and you're going to be saved that ain't what Peter said Peter said repent see they jump they move away from repentance because if they say repent they gonna say repent from what then they got to tell them but they got to repent from but see that's the intellectual how they do that to the people and they're blind and the people and they give them a false experience a false world will give you a false experience you got to take him back to acts 2:38 that's the real deal he'll live I know I'm telling you in order to get to listen I if you like you heard me say you heard me save time at a time again if you are cooking you want the product to turn out just right you must follow the instructions leave anything out you're gonna get the results of it you don't bake with baking soda if it says baking powder to do they both say bacon but they the last word is different yeah now I'm talking from experience so I know what I'm talking about hey it's the truth let me hurry up folks let me hurry up let me read this let me finish this the wall we're struggling here struggling here struggling here struggling here trying to the atomic bomb and everything else are being built but they can't do it hmm they can't do it until the Jews get a vision of the baptism of the holy ghost the angel said hold it till we seal the service not the bride the Gentiles never was a servant we are sons and daughters that's to serve at the Jews Abraham was God's servant hallelujah now we find thousands time thousands of Jews God hardened Pharaoh's heart to drive them to Palestine God hardened Hitler's Hitler's heart loosely the heart start his heart he is driving by force into Palestine not knowing what is he's doing working right into the hands of God the 144,000 was standing andhe and one of these days some divine holy anointed prophets of God we'll go over there and with sign with signs and wonders and those Jews will say that's what I'm looking for hallelujah and see what you must understand you and I must understand how close this thing is the seventh angel has come the revelation of the word is open hallelujah and the angel declared time shall be no more that means everything is ending up everything is ending up time out for it let him that we read is run by because the vision is playing it's been made plain and understanding guarding on Terry force yes what the well says when he comes the Italian oh I'm aware here yes starts at 7 o'clock so I'll be there I'm taking them at 7:00 but somebody in here so I'm going to wait until 7:30 it ain't happening only those who own time I tell people I said see folks don't understand when you say tell Jesus you go I know sometimes you come you can't help it you can't help making it sometime on time all of us like that we all guilty of that things do come but Jesus is always on time he always keeps this appointment he'll sit there and wait for you I can't tell you how many times I've gotten my prayer corner and when I get there he's already waiting waiting on me waiting there knowing he's already there whoo come on somebody I like the Hat you see what I'm saying cuz he gonna be there and he know I'm coming so he just wait hello come on he was there at the well before the woman at the way I got there waiting on her I'm waiting on you come on yeah so that's how he is he's right there away when he needs to be there let me hurry up so what happens in the end of this thing and I just jumped so and the rapture will come the Gentile age will cease the atomic bomb will explode and take the world and the Gentile church will be wrapped it up to stand there in the presence of God who are these that come up out of the Great Tribulation wash their robes and the blood of the Lamb they are before God with our spot amen listen yeah I'll show you had not chosen me jesus said but I have chosen you come on somebody I'm so glad it's not a contest I'm so glad I didn't have to do nothing to merit this I'm so glad he chose me I just I'm just happy about that he ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain whatsoever you ask of the Father in my name he may give it you what fruit let it let it remain you know if you got a leak in the boxcar if it's not filled if it's not filled if a cast of trial can your box you ain't got it where it should be that's what he said the man he goes router you yeah I'm making all that noise he got a package some more before he can seal it it has to be packed solid mmm a supernatural God and the natural people makes them supernatural there's more to it I can't I'm not gonna finish it all but one thing I want to say about the grace of God like he said fear not on the flock is your father good will to give you the kingdom sitting together in heavenly places he goes on and say you Methodist Baptist pentateuch Presbyterian who has laughed at Pentecostals Pentecostals need a good old-fashioned gospel spanking because they organized the very Assembly of God has sent went into the biggest of Pentecost has joined the League of Churches just as formal and indifferent and the worst I ever seen the Holy Ghost treated nearly was the Pentecostal preachers so don't think because you belong to a Pentecostal church you're saved you only say when your true baptized with God's Spirit by the Holy Ghost United with him in the power of his resurrection that right Paul says I save I don't want to know nothing save Jesus Christ and him crucified I want to know him in the power of his resurrection what good is it for me to claim that I'm a Christian if I have no authority and the power behind what I'm claiming it must it must work together right you only say when you're truly baptized with the Holy Spirit and by the Holy Ghost United with him and the power of his resurrection going forth with signs and wonders following that spirit wherever it goes the signs follow the Prophet the signs follow Jesus Christ and the signs father apostles he said these signs shall follow them till he returned again go into the world and preach the power this power and demonstration to every nation he Terps it he says that he didn't say go again preach the gospel he said go into all the world and preach this power and demonstration to every nation huh it lacks two thirds of it yes yet has never heard it and these signs shall follow them every nation that's the mark of the beast see what what this is gonna sound strange to maybe some a lot a lot of people ears I believe this message with all my heart but what it has become what I see is not what I'm looking for I'm looking for what he preached that's what I'm looking for but Malachi 4 preached that's what I'm thirsting for this this glamour that we got I was in the church one time and they had done rigged everybody up with these sound systems you know everybody got to hear everything perfectly what happened to them open Acosta that made noise and brought the Holy Ghost I said Lord let the Holy Ghost come down and strangle them not forgive I wouldn't write in never that shows in it but but then said if you think you might as well say but you know two people need a real rushing wind then they realized that stuff they got on their head is hazardous to the to them you can't bring the world in the church when we've got to be so perfect in that I'll tell you what I got no sister right now I won't call her name but she don't say no well but when she desired a singing she got her now unction from the Holy Ghost to sing she get up the Holy Ghost falls every time anything how good you sound what comes from the heart touches the heart you know and the thing about it is you know we got to get rid of all of this stuff that we've allowed to drift into our our our house you know what I'm saying all of these things that Matt don't matter to God we come together in fellowship in love and we supposed to worship God there's no such thing as begging people to praise them and being come on y'all that sing what you're supposed to be and you come in the house into its course with Thanksgiving into his gates we prayed that's the way you come in I don't had a rough day I need to be refilled you should've got we filled before you got here you know what I'm saying right then you encouraged himself in the Lord he was the only one at prayer meeting but it didn't stop him blessed and God building you're part of it he's working you you gonna suffer hey nobody likes their head but that's the way he designed it you go tried in the fire thank God for the gold whatever dross is in there let the fire come you understand me don't be afraid of it he will not destroy you only all this fire does is pull out all of the impurities of you so that at the end of the thing you got pure gold and he can see his reflection that's what he wants we came I'm closing on this note we really came in this age to declare and to prove that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today in moments like these I'll sing our song I'll sing out a love song to Jesus in moment like ease I lift up my head I lift up my to see [Music] [Music] [Applause] you amen I tell you the truth I I'm gonna miss brother Vincent brother Vincent would travel all the way down from Ames then worked all day school work everything and we'd have people who live not far wouldn't even show up what do you think that is you know what God was doing breaking a judgment and people don't realize that's what he's doing God has never left himself without a witness hello oh come on folk it's the truth the Bible said the Queen of the South will stand in judgment why cuz she traveled all the way from bath sheep to come and hear this the wisdom of Solomon touch through the desert with no air-conditioning nothing no convenience nothing but there's such a strong desire she want to see God live and God real and you and I I tell you the truth it's just it's just a matter and I thank God for all of you because you know what on Wednesday nights this is what we get faithfuls the Connolly's would be here the stampers always call him connelly but the stampers would be here if if sister Stamper wasn't I mean but she's recovering praise the Lord amen and I know as soon as everything get right there be here and and you know I look at it and look at until these people the end I say people cuz I know when every time anybody want to go somewhere they gonna go I don't care

40 minutes long sometime an hour and we want that so called steak will sit right there and wait mister to and yet people come to church and they don't mean you know they get tired the word and you can always tell in this beer because when they get tired they they put the brakes on don't emote their mouth but your spirit is saying that's enough that I'm tired and then we'll go out here and then we're talk but you know it's those things that people think that God doesn't see he hears it he sees it and the Holy Ghost is responding when reporting back everything that we say do and think I just thank God for you I really do those of you who do come and make that sacrifice I really appreciate your coming I think the other day we only had seven and it still was a good number but anyway you love the Lord let's have a word of Prayer dear Jesus we know that is not him that willeth or he that running even your prophet of God said that if we had a mindset where we believe that our church saves us he said that's the mark of the beast the only thing that's the apostasy excuse me and he said the only thing that saves us is Grace and blood of Jesus Christ father I depend on what took place at Calvary I depend on how you when you as a lamb took that book that's that was in the right hand of him that sat on the throne and you released this word to us then it becomes a new book where it builds our character builds our our whole being but it sets us free until we get to a place Lord Jesus to see how free we are we can't be free and unfree it must be freedom one way or the other and you have done that for us and I'm so grateful Lord because your word has sealed us into your promises and we know that your promises are yay bless each and every heart keep our hearts and minds set on thee and your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen be from this world of see I've been washed in the blood of Jesus I've been born again [Music] Oh hallelujah I'm say say say bye it's wonderful oh
