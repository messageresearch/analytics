[33:32] and we don't want to prolong the service

[33:36] to introduce myself a little bit only
[33:37] have a seat in Jesus Christ name Amen
[33:39] praise the Lord
[33:41] so like I say my name is Betty Gibson
[33:43] I've known brother Brooks and his family
[33:46] for quite a long time back in South
[33:48] Carolina amen and we did a lot of good
[33:52] things together a man had seen the move
[33:54] of the Holy Spirit how God can man and
[33:55] just changed so many people lives we've
[33:57] got saved by law we're just moving in a
[34:00] mighty way you no longer be blessed
[34:02] brother Brooks the law brought him from
[34:05] him and his family and I know y'all know
[34:08] me I know brother Henry Simmons he used
[34:10] to passed at that time back in back in
[34:12] Mullins and then Lord blessed him and
[34:15] now I'm the pastor Donny is brother
[34:17] Nathanael Simon s brother Hindus brother
[34:19] and we've been in under ministry since
[34:23] that time and in Lourdes bless this is
[34:26] my first time this far away from home
[34:28] ministry in the word of the Lord but I
[34:30] have been other places administering the
[34:32] word of the Lord in Jesus Christ's name
[34:34] Ryan Mullins Columbia and North Carolina
[34:36] different places the Lord has allowed me
[34:39] to go and minister this word so I just
[34:41] think the Lord Jesus for allowing us to
[34:43] be here this morning we flew out our
[34:46] South Carolina came in went to North
[34:48] Carolina flew on Dow and got into
[34:51] Chicago plane got late and had to run to
[34:55] try to catch the next plane well glad I
[34:58] missed that plane they gave me another
[34:59] plane that I coming all the way in the
[35:01] back when nothing was a silo of another
[35:04] plan I had plenty of room it wasn't much
[35:07] people in that plane and so I can put
[35:10] them a bag on the seat and everything
[35:11] they have plenty of rooms with the plane
[35:13] with just a bunny
[35:13] so I thank the Lord for that we got here
[35:16] safe and we've been there but since
[35:17] Thursday I made a few little brothers I
[35:20] made brother Keith and honestly the
[35:21] other brother was yeah brother Troy so I
[35:24] met them a few days ago and I met this
[35:27] precious brother right here and we
[35:28] fellowship together yesterday at the
[35:30] restaurant so like I said I thank the
[35:32] law for being here I pray God that I can
[35:34] be a blessing to you through the word of
[35:35] the lord I pray something can be said
[35:37] that'll be a blessing to you that cause
[35:39] you to go on further in Christ that's
[35:41] what it's all about
[35:42] we're here for one purpose that's to
[35:44] worship the Lord Jesus Christ and to
[35:46] give him all the glory to give him all
[35:47] the praise you're not looking for glory
[35:49] we were looking for pray you want him to
[35:50] be exalted want him to get the glorying
[35:52] it to pray come when he's glorified he
[35:55] does things for his people the more
[35:57] praise we stand up the more blessing God
[35:59] sends down that's what we want we want
[36:01] the blessings of the Lord we just thank
[36:03] God again it may this time you can stand
[36:06] it may have to read the word of the Lord
[36:08] and going to the word and man I'm not
[36:13] one of those new time preachers but I
[36:15] just find it more convenient to use a
[36:16] little tablet to look at the word and
[36:18] things like that in Jesus Christ's name
[36:20] so I hope this is all right amen
[36:31] telling me to the book of Galatians
[36:47] let's start Galatians 5 and 1 it says
[36:53] stand fast therefore in the Liberty
[36:55] wherewith Christ had made us free and be
[36:57] not entangled again with the yoke of
[37:00] bondage behold I Paul say unto you that
[37:03] you be circumcised Christ shall profit
[37:06] you nothing for I testify again to every
[37:10] man that is circumcised the debtor to do
[37:11] the whole law Christ has become a no
[37:14] effect unto you whosoever of you are
[37:16] justified by the law ye are fallen from
[37:19] grace for we through the spirit wait for
[37:22] the hope of righteousness by faith for
[37:25] in Jesus Christ neither circumcision
[37:26] availeth anything nor uncircumcision but
[37:30] faith which worketh by love you did run
[37:33] well who did Hindi you thee shall not
[37:36] obey the truth this persuasion cometh
[37:39] not of him that calleth you a little
[37:42] leaven leaveneth the whole lump I'm read
[37:45] the next verse I have confidence in the
[37:47] Lord in you through the Lord he should
[37:49] be none otherwise minded he that
[37:52] troubled you shall bear his judgment
[37:54] whoever he'd be led by here's what a
[37:56] prayer wishes can't have any father a
[37:59] bridge a holy word
[38:00] no intellectual blessing subhanAllah God
[38:02] for your glory law only you know until
[38:04] people have neither we just empty
[38:06] vessels Lord looking to be filled by
[38:08] your spirit that your word and no voice
[38:10] can be heard Lord in this day we commit
[38:13] ourselves to be whatever sins a
[38:15] transgression sign if there's any way
[38:17] anything would hinder your presence Lord
[38:18] o anointing grass that you're moving out
[38:20] there when we plead the blood of the
[38:21] Covenant the blood of your son the Lord
[38:23] Jesus we ask for your mercy we thank you
[38:25] to stay father we give you the glory
[38:27] honor and praise in Jesus Christ's name
[38:29] Amen amen for the reading of that script
[38:33] you want to take a top y'all may be
[38:34] seated
[38:35] we will take a topic under the influence
[38:38] under the influence and fluid is a very
[38:43] powerful thing we we ant we use it and
[38:48] don't even know we're using it people
[38:50] come under our influence and they are
[38:52] influenced by us and they begin to do
[38:55] things or even say thing because they're
[38:58] influenced by what's going on around
[39:00] them so
[39:01] be careful of our influence we want to
[39:06] make sure that our influence is coming
[39:07] from the Holy Ghost we want to be
[39:10] influenced by God's Spirit we don't want
[39:12] a contrary influence and here I want to
[39:16] just show you something not me but Holy
[39:17] Ghost it fluids is great it man I think
[39:22] I was looking at it the most greatest
[39:24] influence that's on the earth is by the
[39:27] Sun and the moon the Sun has a grid
[39:30] influence on the earth and also the moon
[39:33] I was looking at how the Sun and the
[39:35] moon affects the water we know that
[39:37] water in the Bible represents people
[39:39] that's right in the book of Revelation
[39:42] so the Sun is affecting the water and
[39:45] the moon is affecting the water causing
[39:47] their tire to go in and out and we know
[39:50] that in the natural and the spiritual
[39:51] realm God represents the Sun and the
[39:54] church represents the moon and it says
[39:57] and leading up in science say that the
[39:59] moon has the most greatest effect on the
[40:02] tides this effect cannot be seen but it
[40:06] just felt it caused the water to go in
[40:09] and on and this is so accurate they can
[40:12] list the tides for years to come off of
[40:15] the cell off of this and fluid can you

[42:16] persuasion our persuasion is an
[42:19] influence somebody is trying to persuade
[42:22] you to do something I mean they're
[42:24] trying to influence you to do something
[42:26] you'd rather be for good or wrong we
[42:28] found out here that these people these
[42:30] Judaizers amen they couldn't accept what
[42:34] the Lord Jesus did it still was stuck on
[42:36] the molders law can accept what God was
[42:40] doing doing something new in the same
[42:42] time we living in the day people can't
[42:44] accept what God is doing in our day they
[42:48] can't accept the revelation of the word
[42:49] that God has brought so they still tied
[42:52] down when the denominational systems
[42:54] just like there was and this day he'll
[42:57] do the dive the fall to Paul all over
[42:59] the place he preaching the word trying
[43:00] to get people to turn back to the law
[43:03] you don't hear that the same spirit is
[43:07] working today trying to get people to
[43:10] turn back from the word that God has
[43:13] wrought where and I would they think
[43:16] about that that influence is out there
[43:17] is their influence out there in these
[43:19] last days it's causing people to turn
[43:21] back isn't in flew away they're coming
[43:24] from sometimes they come from the very
[43:26] people that were once up
[43:28] of God's Word sozin influence and here
[43:32] these Judah died that I heard the Word
[43:34] of God fallen Paul around trying to get
[43:37] these people to turn back to the law or
[43:40] to come under the ministry of the law
[43:42] and garden turn and do something
[43:44] different
[43:44] garden came and Moses had his day is
[43:48] that's right Moses had his day under the
[43:51] law he had his day now more this day is
[43:54] gone now god has brought grace and truth
[43:56] to Jesus Christ
[43:57] you don't have to keep the law no more
[43:59] to be saved or I got to have faith to
[44:01] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you
[44:03] shall be saved man hey have you got a
[44:06] living faith and your feet will called

[44:14] say Amen whatever it is C so that what
[44:18] it is
[44:18] people are on the influence are being
[44:20] influenced for work force we should let
[44:23] me read that to you by the grace of God
[44:25] I where persuasion me I persuade I mean
[44:27] I have and exert influence and effect
[44:32] they have and exert influence our effect
[44:36] that's what persuade me it's trying to
[44:39] persuade you here in the book and in
[44:41] Galatians these Judaizers that would
[44:44] have called we're trying to persuade
[44:46] influence these people that just heard
[44:49] the word that Paul was preaching to come
[44:51] back under the law politics persuasion
[44:55] that is not of God it's not of God that
[44:59] car what would God call you into
[45:00] something and want you to go back that's
[45:03] not God see there's that spirit is out
[45:06] there there's that influence out there
[45:08] trying to get people to go back it's not
[45:10] of God it's not yet this persuasion is
[45:13] not of God see this influence it's not
[45:17] of God and not of God God and centum God
[45:20] and say it your garden vindicate what is
[45:22] truth how many I believe garden
[45:25] vindicate what is truth God has already
[45:28] vindicated waters God's vindicated that
[45:31] mean God can't turn away from it it's
[45:34] been vindicated by God by God's Spirit
[45:36] God and put a seal honor that it's true
[45:39] with us say at the Lord now nobody
[45:42] can come and say it's not true go got
[45:44] too many believers to testify that what
[45:47] I have done
[45:48] it is truth and then I one of those
[45:50] believe it was I there to see it no but
[45:52] I believe what God has said no more what
[45:56] wasn't there to see that he wasn't there
[45:59] to see what God did but we heard about
[46:01] it and guess what we believed it we
[46:04] accepted it and now I'm because of that
[46:06] influence we are here today
[46:09] remember to b'seder the brother said he
[46:12] said when he was trying to make him a
[46:14] god he's all the influence I had upon
[46:17] the people to bring in the Christ now
[46:19] you're trying to make me a Anti Christ
[46:21] see then fluence that he had his
[46:25] influence still affecting us today that
[46:28] ministry that God has sent in the last
[46:30] day is still got the same effect that it
[46:33] had back then the same effect see but
[46:37] people in the last day the enemy has
[46:39] come in with another influence trying to
[46:43] persuade you that what God has done any
[46:46] right it's a false prophet
[46:48] it is not Fiat the Lord or he all he's
[46:52] mistake load this mistake that mistake
[46:54] or this mistake that mistake my god
[46:57] read your Bible Paul me mistakes every
[47:03] man if he made a living of Earth made
[47:05] but stay not trying to justify and I'm
[47:07] trying to show it influenced see
[47:10] watching influence you want nobody
[47:12] influenced you to leave God will burn
[47:15] influence you leave the word so watch
[47:17] your influence you influence a very
[47:20] important you want to make sure that
[47:22] your influence is of God under the Holy
[47:26] Ghost see it meant that moon God put the
[47:30] moon in place to affect the earth we
[47:33] need the tides fisherman's depend upon
[47:36] that money they depend on that time
[47:38] where they go didn't catch fish for
[47:40] liberty man they need to tide him and
[47:42] God put that day that influence a man
[47:45] that's moving that water saying that
[47:47] then the fluid of the church in his hour
[47:49] that's moving the waters then fluence is
[47:52] moving the water the waters are being
[47:54] moved because of
[47:55] Church the bride and his I was is
[47:58] affecting the waters it meant people are
[48:00] coming to the Lord people are being
[48:02] saved people lives are being changed
[48:04] why because they'll be influenced that
[48:08] you have did you go out there and do
[48:10] anything that people gonna say oh you
[48:12] did this no it's just a simple life you
[48:15] can live a man a sermon bread you can

[48:20] a sermon bed you can preach him one live
[48:24] a sermon how you gonna live it by the
[48:26] Holy Ghost the suasion persuade the
[48:32] capacity to have an effect on the
[48:34] character development our behavior of
[48:37] someone something are the effect itself
[48:40] so you're you're fluent have effect on
[48:43] somebody's character it has an effect on
[48:47] somebody's behavior it has an effect on
[48:50] how that person is going to live your
[48:53] influence so what kind of influence are
[48:56] you putting out there then we get action
[48:59] cell you got on is your Holy Ghost and
[49:01] flu they're calling you to live for the
[49:03] word then when someone sees you they
[49:05] know that you are Christian you know how
[49:07] to pack a Bible round whichever way the
[49:09] people to see your Christian it meant
[49:11] it'll see you are Christian by the way
[49:12] that you lived it recognized that
[49:14] there's something different about you
[49:16] you act like the world you don't look
[49:18] like the world I mean you look like a
[49:20] Christian how a Christian supposed to
[49:22] look and it's their time and hard to
[49:24] find people that really Christian
[49:25] because the world in fruit of the world
[49:28] has crept inside the church then flew
[49:31] little word I want to look worldly you
[49:34] want to dress worldly the worldly style
[49:37] and they're really fast and fluid of the
[49:39] church or the world has crept inside the
[49:41] church and some people trying to dress
[49:43] and look holy you're trying to dress and
[49:44] look more like the world see to watch
[49:47] the influence very important in God are
[49:49] looking down and seeing what is
[49:51] influencing you see young young women
[49:56] are influence in man in the last
[49:58] generation our honor what but it I saw
[50:00] your mom being affluent but someone to
[50:03] do evil things
[50:04] watch influenced by the influence you to
[50:07] do anything around young ladies keep you
[50:09] saying
[50:09] becoming an influence also called peer
[50:11] pressure there's another form of
[50:14] influence that attacks young people that
[50:17] makes them do things that are contrary
[50:19] to the world you know to the word you
[50:21] don't have to come under that kinda
[50:22] influence
[50:23] you're not the yield to it's gonna be
[50:25] there but you don't have to yield to it
[50:26] the pressure to be like the world is
[50:30] upon all of us when our job is the
[50:32] influence or try to be like the rest of
[50:35] the workers they're going to drink
[50:37] they're going to the bar whatever come
[50:39] on go with us no I can't go I'm a
[50:40] Christian I can't I can't go or you look
[50:44] like a square you look like you and a
[50:46] part of the fun that's all right at the
[50:48] way though I want you to be separated
[50:50] you're separated people different from
[50:53] the world I but God was trying to be
[50:54] still in the Israel he's I separated you
[50:56] from the nation you're separated people
[50:58] amen then you can invert it influence
[51:01] that a call to people in the world to
[51:03] see how you live and costing becoming to
[51:05] be a Christian that what God separates
[51:07] us you separate us to show a difference
[51:11] that we can have an influence and those
[51:13] people that don't know God that we can
[51:15] win them to Christ that weren't there
[51:17] don't be afraid to be alone something
[51:20] most best time with God is wearing you
[51:21] alone when you're separated a man nobody
[51:26] around nothing you know what fellowship
[51:28] but sometime God get you to a place by
[51:30] yourself a man that you can talk with
[51:32] God he doesn't a lot dinner with Abraham
[51:35] he did it with John Paul he did it with
[51:37] so many others in the Bible you read how
[51:39] God would separate them get them a law
[51:42] that he can talk with him all the
[51:45] prophets been alone maybe true prophets
[51:47] from fame from God it wasn't popular it
[51:50] wasn't popular there were men that was
[51:51] separated because they had a word from
[51:54] God that the people didn't agree with it
[51:56] was so unpopular for they did what they
[51:58] preached was so unpopular it meant that
[52:00] people cannot accept it they did the way
[52:02] the GAR brought in our day it's so
[52:04] unpopular to preacher that to say the
[52:07] denominational systems are I'm in the
[52:09] world of full of denominations they say
[52:11] come out of that denominational system
[52:13] and come to the word is I'm popular Meza
[52:16] but guess what it's the word of the Lord
[52:17] you come out so in influence so it is a
[52:21] powerful
[52:22] thing I got some examples I want to look
[52:24] at by the grace of God to show you in
[52:25] the word what really struck me is one
[52:28] let's go to the book of first kings
[52:30] remember influence come from status in
[52:34] position your status in your position is
[52:38] your influence that what preachers have
[52:41] to be very careful of the influence man
[52:46] my church member had to be very careful
[52:48] of that influence because you can be
[52:50] serving man and not serving God see be
[52:54] careful
[52:55] your influence we're all exerting
[52:56] influence but when a preacher is in the
[52:59] pulpit or whatever especially the
[53:01] exalted preacher his influences out
[53:03] there and sometimes people get so caught
[53:06] up under the fruit of that man they
[53:08] begin to serve the man and not serve God
[53:11] we see that happen even inside the
[53:13] ministry that God has sent in these last
[53:15] days that would have happened to a lot
[53:17] of people Longy could have served that
[53:19] man if thought they were gonna be saved
[53:22] you don't hear that lanza could have
[53:26] served that man if I was gonna be saved
[53:28] when that man left off to see what
[53:30] happened to them it went away but I'm
[53:34] turning around see could that influence
[53:35] it he want to know to treat him like
[53:37] that no he didn't know they don't do me
[53:38] like that you're gonna cause God to take
[53:40] me over the earth before my time don't
[53:41] do me like that but because of its
[53:43] influence these thought blonde is served
[53:47] as man they were gonna be saved
[53:50] long as I served my pastor I'm gonna be
[53:54] saved
[53:54] lana do whatever my pastor say do well
[53:57] I'm gonna be saved don't think like that
[53:59] long as you do what God works they do
[54:02] you're gonna be saved
[54:04] why don't you keep the word you'll be
[54:07] saved not because you serving the man
[54:09] that because you you thank God whatever
[54:13] them things you do God tells to do them
[54:14] thing though those pliat I give you
[54:16] offering come to share all that stuff
[54:18] was good but launch it if you're doing
[54:20] the please that man
[54:21] God ain't gonna accept it you've got to
[54:25] do it because you love God if you love
[54:29] God then you good good good know what
[54:32] you're gonna come to church you're gonna
[54:34] do
[54:35] because you love the Lord
[54:39] well are you trying to please that man
[54:40] you go running the trouble girl he will
[54:42] offend you
[54:45] he will make you mad you gonna say
[54:49] something you don't like you're gonna
[54:51] get mad with him that day and you might
[54:53] stay away from church about a few days
[54:54] because he made your man
[54:56] so he gonna be careful that the word the
[54:58] word shouldn't offend you the word
[55:00] should help let's go through I'm King
[55:02] so I'm working with David here we're
[55:04] going to ensure David had a powerful
[55:06] influence he was a king of Israel and
[55:10] everybody tried to please David God

[55:16] brought him up through the ranks and God
[55:17] made deer but a great man with a great
[55:19] man and Israel God set him up he was
[55:22] king of all Israel but yet David had
[55:25] thoughts inside him he had fault as a
[55:28] man we all got him we can dress the pie
[55:32] and look at me so perfect but behind
[55:34] that veneer behind that is a number of a
[55:36] bunch of folks a bunch of folks only God
[55:40] can get him out of us a bunch of fault
[55:43] see and David had them see they're good
[55:45] of our first Kings eleven David had all
[55:47] these thoughts inside him and remember

[57:06] said he speak ill-advised sleep he got
[57:10] angry and said things you shouldn't say
[57:13] and did things he shouldn't do the devil
[57:17] see how you go up there to them here
[57:19] David a king in Israel God I'm using to
[57:22] do so many great things and the devil is
[57:24] after David amen first Kings 11 even the
[57:29] devil after David amen China is
[57:32] destroyed David but we know who what God
[57:35] did for David and things like that but
[57:37] um David
[57:39] this has made some bad decisions see
[57:47] here of
[57:55] Samuel Kings second Samuel forgive me
[58:13] write these scriptures down you don't
[58:15] know what amen second Kings 11 and they
[58:19] came to pass after the year was expired
[58:23] that time when Kings go forth to battle
[58:25] the David sent Joab and his servants
[58:27] with him in all Israel and destroyed the
[58:29] children of Ammon and rabba besieged and
[58:32] besieged Rabbah but David Terry Stewart
[58:33] Jerusalem beginning past and even tired
[58:36] leave a rolls muffins bed and walked
[58:38] upon the roof of the king's house and
[58:40] from the roof he saw a woman washing
[58:42] herself and the moon was very beautiful
[58:44] to look upon and they were sending the
[58:46] quad after the woman and one said is not
[58:48] this Bathsheba the daughter of Eli and
[58:51] the wife of Uriah Hittite if they were
[58:53] sending messengers and took her and she
[58:55] came in unto him and he laid with her
[58:57] but she was purified from her and
[58:59] cleanness and she returned unto her
[59:02] house and the woman conceived and sinnin
[59:04] told David and said I am with child
[59:08] all right David should not have done
[59:11] that I know a lot of people said when
[59:13] David was King and he was ruler and he
[59:15] can do with them people as he want to
[59:17] for God and look at it like that God
[59:20] rebuke to david garvik said you were
[59:22] taking the sward or the children and
[59:24] Ammon and kill Uriah see and taking rise
[59:28] wife to be thy wife this war shall never
[59:31] depart from thy house is he was so much
[59:34] of a good King by the God punishing why
[59:38] did that linger over David's life God
[59:41] said God said David was fit for the God
[59:44] and everything except one thing in the
[59:47] matter concerning you ride ahead time
[59:49] the only thing God held against David
[59:52] that seemed would never wiped away it
[59:55] was a plague on his house because of
[59:58] what he did he did Ron he used his
[59:59] influence to take another man's wife
[1:00:03] knowing that he's using the food taking
[1:00:05] another man's wife but he uses them
[1:00:07] fluid to get other people to cover
[1:00:11] his influence let's look at it he he
[1:00:14] says Joey Bob now Joab should have knew
[1:00:16] better
[1:00:18] Joab was y'all know joy and David with
[1:00:21] kinfolks y'all know that right there was
[1:00:24] Joab Joab was a man a lot of time we

[1:00:39] all right
[1:00:40] no I can't do that I'm a Christian I
[1:00:43] can't do that many way here
[1:00:45] so David done took this man wise down
[1:00:48] got a pregnant now this happened over
[1:00:50] space of time it didn't happen all in
[1:00:52] one day it takes a little powerful woman
[1:00:54] know she pregnant
[1:00:55] think about least two or three months
[1:00:57] for she was CEO I know something it
[1:00:59] meant so she become pregnant and now
[1:01:01] David gets the new the now he is under
[1:01:04] state of panic he wants to cover his
[1:01:07] sins deader than confessing and I'm
[1:01:09] making it right he wants to cover it see
[1:01:12] when you do wrong don't try to cover
[1:01:14] confess and make it right
[1:01:16] don't cover your sins you cover your sin
[1:01:19] the Bible that you won't prosper David
[1:01:21] here is caught then he meant to get
[1:01:25] caught no he thought he got away but God
[1:01:27] had it so that the woman got pregnant
[1:01:30] now he needs a way out deny uses his
[1:01:34] influence to get everybody around him
[1:01:38] the cover form to try to lie how many oh
[1:01:43] I've done that before
[1:01:44] usually influence it gets people to
[1:01:47] cover for your life you did a little run
[1:01:49] and your influence caused those around
[1:01:52] you to cover for you don't do it don't
[1:01:56] do it tell the truth no matter how it
[1:02:00] hurts tell the truth no use your
[1:02:04] influence to come up nothing especially
[1:02:06] if you done wrong David Hare did just
[1:02:09] that and what surprised me was about the
[1:02:11] story here is how Joab is when did
[1:02:15] everything they would say do it were
[1:02:17] just as guilty as David he called that
[1:02:19] man to be killed
[1:02:20] sit down man - the hardest battle just
[1:02:23] to kill them so that he won't find out
[1:02:25] that the child is not mine it blown to
[1:02:29] David see this influency that's why you
[1:02:32] can't come under the influence of no man
[1:02:35] you're to be under the influence of the
[1:02:37] Holy Ghost
[1:02:39] because when the under the fluid of the
[1:02:41] Holy Spirit you will do what's right you
[1:02:44] under that influence you can't tell a
[1:02:47] lie under the influence of the Holy
[1:02:48] Ghost
[1:02:49] you might try but the holy book and Vic
[1:02:51] you make that thing right the Prophet
[1:02:56] did it he lied tell him I'm not in the
[1:02:58] house just you tell his wife that's why
[1:03:02] I said well I stepped outside this
[1:03:06] influence tell you the wife the life on
[1:03:09] Hina now tell I'm not the old tax
[1:03:11] collector cause I ain't your prayer go
[1:03:15] make that thing right then I hear your
[1:03:17] prayer see so you can't lie under the
[1:03:20] Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit under than
[1:03:22] fool you true London and full of the
[1:03:24] Holy Ghost
[1:03:25] it will convict you of your wrong if you
[1:03:28] allow it to it convicted you and you
[1:03:31] wrap your law it to a lot of time our
[1:03:33] conscience gets so sad about it that the
[1:03:35] countries said with a hot iron
[1:03:36] it gets so sales sometimes we can't even
[1:03:38] feel the conviction of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:41] we allow that conviction not even have
[1:03:44] no effect on us but the Holy Ghost is
[1:03:46] there amen to convict that we can get it
[1:03:50] right so David right here got it all
[1:03:54] these men working for him they were
[1:03:56] under his influence your honor David
[1:03:59] influence so that's why they did what
[1:04:00] they did under his influence until God
[1:04:03] can set you free from that you're always
[1:04:05] been under somebody influence your been
[1:04:09] someone in funda God break the chain God
[1:04:11] have to break the chain offer your life
[1:04:13] and offer you to be free from a bad
[1:04:14] influence
[1:04:15] I know could God break the chains off of
[1:04:17] my life one day I was under somebody's
[1:04:19] influence no matter what this person did
[1:04:21] I would I thought I was serving God but
[1:04:24] I was trying I was covering for that man
[1:04:25] and one day God broke the chain I saw
[1:04:28] the chains broke I saw the chains fall
[1:04:31] off if not be there the flu infected me
[1:04:35] like that no more
[1:04:36] see I saw the chains fall off I was
[1:04:38] under this manson fluid the cause of his
[1:04:40] ministry i was under his influence i
[1:04:43] willing to do anything for him cover for
[1:04:45] him live from whatever but when god
[1:04:48] broke those chains it was a different
[1:04:50] thing now I was under influence of God's
[1:04:53] Spirit I thought it was under I was
[1:04:55] under amazing fluency and so easy to do
[1:04:58] that like if you read I'm David's
[1:05:00] influence do it all this wrong you think
[1:05:02] it counted at one time condemn them you
[1:05:06] think it counted at any time affected
[1:05:08] them think about joy I was doing carding
[1:05:11] the man to be killed drop country
[1:05:12] involving out in their bed while he was
[1:05:14] pleasing David he thought he was alright
[1:05:17] they have a service even got into it
[1:05:20] trying to get you writer come and eat
[1:05:21] for the King got a mess of food for you
[1:05:23] come on to the house and eat didn't knew
[1:05:25] what David did all up under that
[1:05:29] influency nobody had enough guts to
[1:05:32] stand up and say you wrong to God sent
[1:05:35] Nathan the Prophet thank God for Nathan
[1:05:36] the Prophet even someone in afraid to
[1:05:39] say that's a at the Lord amen
[1:05:41] so I need a friend to tell it to
[1:05:43] somebody there's under the influence of
[1:05:45] the Holy Ghost see the difference a lot
[1:05:49] of people down the devil some fluid
[1:05:51] angels in that round they're trying to
[1:05:52] cover for them
[1:05:53] but now God send somebody is under his
[1:05:55] influence they're not afraid to say
[1:05:58] you're wrong you're tooken you rise wife
[1:06:01] and you've done the things you did nine
[1:06:02] thus warning can never depart from your
[1:06:04] house and all these bad things are
[1:06:06] happening you because of what you did
[1:06:08] somebody had enough the unction of the
[1:06:10] Holy Ghost to say you wrong
[1:06:12] how are you afraid to tell your friend
[1:06:14] that they're wrong you saw under the
[1:06:17] influence you can't be a real friend
[1:06:19] tomb to tell them when they're wrong
[1:06:21] that you what you're doing is wrong a
[1:06:23] real friend will tell you when you're
[1:06:26] wrong a real friend now the Bible said
[1:06:31] is a friend that sticketh closer than a
[1:06:33] brother that's the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:36] he'll tell you when you're wrong
[1:06:38] he can just be your friend and that you
[1:06:41] go around keep on doing thing no he's a
[1:06:43] good friend here tell you when you're
[1:06:44] wrong see Joab sort of rebuked David
[1:06:47] some has seven so to rebuke David
[1:06:49] somebody said
[1:06:50] says something but because of under his
[1:06:52] influence they can sell word it wouldn't
[1:06:55] did exactly what he's wanted them to do
[1:06:57] under hissing flora God sent Nathan a
[1:06:59] prophet a man with us say at the law to
[1:07:03] get David's crate and what it takes to
[1:07:05] take somebody with enough boldness not
[1:07:07] to be afraid to say what God want to say
[1:07:09] you can just get somebody there's not
[1:07:11] afraid he can use amen
[1:07:14] so David they were under his influence
[1:07:16] see I hope y'all saw that by the grace
[1:07:19] of God under his influence to do evil
[1:07:21] instead of good thought it was serving
[1:07:24] the Lord but all the time it was serving
[1:07:27] David that's hard in it to come to
[1:07:31] church all your life
[1:07:32] thank you doing good and the whole time
[1:07:35] you were just serving that man the
[1:07:37] seven to Lord Jesus Christ in me
[1:07:40] honors I remember the story the probably
[1:07:42] talked about the woman she was a Sunday
[1:07:44] school teaching all this good stuff and

[1:07:47] dying and she realized she was going to

[1:07:55] just feed my man I'm going to hell you
[1:07:57] deceived my man but was too late see I

[1:08:03] the truth under that he went through a
[1:08:06] lot of people to learn that same kind of
[1:08:08] info and go to church do it whatever you

[1:08:46] afraid God sent him he wasn't afraid to
[1:08:49] tell her David you was wrong what you
[1:08:51] did was wrong lobby was them with David

[1:11:42] an influence under alcohol and we as
[1:11:44] Christians we should not be drinking
[1:11:45] alcohol no we don't I know the Bible say
[1:11:51] use a little wife but I stomach sick and
[1:11:53] I often infirmities I understand that

[1:12:19] what the Living God that's what we drunk
[1:12:22] with that's whose influence we are under
[1:12:25] see they were under that influence it
[1:12:28] made them drunk and staggered look
[1:12:29] somebody like they were drunk Peter said
[1:12:31] no these many drunk no the under the
[1:12:33] influence of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:34] see now what God is trying to bring us
[1:12:37] to under the influence of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:39] men and women boys and girls God wants
[1:12:42] you on the his influence he want you to
[1:12:45] be under peer pressure from your peers
[1:12:48] in school young children under more
[1:12:50] pressure than ever
[1:12:51] you don't you to know more thing that we
[1:12:52] ever knew you know more than we ever
[1:12:55] knew his children in North Way before we
[1:12:58] got a chance to know they know at all
[1:13:00] see so influenced to do the things that
[1:13:03] a young people are doing it it is it's
[1:13:06] very hard for young children teenagers
[1:13:10] children scooter influence of that peer
[1:13:13] pressure so high they take the grace of
[1:13:15] God for them not to fall under it and
[1:13:17] you we as parents we have the mix show
[1:13:20] that they are under our influence oh
[1:13:24] lord have mercy
[1:13:26] we've got to make sure they're in our
[1:13:28] food that when they go wherever they go
[1:13:30] the food that we put on them it's with
[1:13:33] them I'm a not her dad that influenza we
[1:13:35] got our Christian influence the read
[1:13:39] their Bibles the pray the hair Bible
[1:13:42] study that's an influence you put up on
[1:13:45] your child and when they go all
[1:13:47] different places that influences with
[1:13:48] them so you got to instill it in your
[1:13:51] child what if it isn't still inside them
[1:13:53] video games and high-pass and phone
[1:13:56] that's all they can see instead I'm
[1:13:57] doing something for the Lord
[1:13:59] there's always some other thing you're
[1:14:00] looking at so that's that influence see
[1:14:03] and the more they're looking at that and
[1:14:05] more that influences upon them so now
[1:14:08] you're going to put them on under
[1:14:09] another influence but let's see another
[1:14:11] atmosphere see so your influence upon
[1:14:16] your child was so important to go do
[1:14:17] everything we do anyway REME gotta tell
[1:14:21] them they go looking see what mom and
[1:14:22] dad to do and nine times out of ten
[1:14:24] they're gonna do that anyway but
[1:14:25] remember we are fighting against other
[1:14:28] influences also it's out there that's
[1:14:31] going to cause them you do things that
[1:14:34] it shouldn't do so that way our
[1:14:35] influence got to be more stronger than
[1:14:39] the influence it got to be more powerful
[1:14:42] and it is powerful Isis the Holy Ghost
[1:14:44] the Holy Ghost are fooled away powerful
[1:14:46] in the world influence they making brick
[1:14:48] chains they man it can destroy yokes a
[1:14:50] man it can do all of that Long's we get

[1:14:55] it or do it a break every chain it'll
[1:14:57] break every you get a brick every devil

[1:15:15] by the Prophet Joel well it should kind

[1:16:26] Samson was a man of London influence of
[1:16:28] God according to do great things while

[1:23:21] front of me - without he wondering will
[1:23:22] I got to look at the cross you might on
[1:23:24] the cross because I know what's gonna
[1:23:26] take place if you fool around with the
[1:23:29] devil Samson didn't realize it but he
[1:23:33] was in trouble
[1:23:34] fool around with Delilah playing games
[1:23:37] with her telling us this telling that -
[1:23:40] one day she worked with him so much that
[1:23:42] he broke down the bottle see he told her
[1:23:44] all his heart everything that was wrong
[1:23:47] what was going why he had this Greece
[1:23:49] strength now I love you to think the
[1:23:51] strength was us here the screen was not
[1:23:54] his here his strength was keeping the
[1:23:58] word the word say don't cut your hair
[1:24:01] I'm a I heard that it wasn't this here
[1:24:04] there was a screen it was him keeping
[1:24:06] the Word of God not to cut us here and
[1:24:09] when he cut us here when Delilah called
[1:24:12] his hair to be cut that's when he lost
[1:24:15] his scream for women who cut you here
[1:24:20] don't
[1:24:21] ha no don't don't don't don't do it even
[1:24:24] priests don't do it amen amen so when he
[1:24:29] did that he didn't know what had taken
[1:24:32] place but they're known and that left
[1:24:34] him Oh Lord hammered I do not want that
[1:24:37] anointing to leave me I don't know how
[1:24:40] y'all feel about this thing but Lord
[1:24:42] don't teach your Holy Spirit away from
[1:24:43] me that what David said they would say
[1:24:47] take not thy Holy Spirit away from me he
[1:24:50] said restored to me the joy of my
[1:24:53] salvation see don't take your Holy
[1:24:55] Spirit away once the Spirit of God
[1:24:57] leaves like any other man you're like a
[1:25:01] man that don't have God once God's
[1:25:03] Spirit leave you you're like any other
[1:25:05] man you want to have the strength to
[1:25:07] stand against the devil once God spirit
[1:25:10] leaves you you like any other man there
[1:25:13] any other person that why you love him
[1:25:16] when you make sure that we stay under
[1:25:18] their northing under the influence of
[1:25:20] the Holy Ghost
[1:25:21] Samson lost it and the sad thing about
[1:25:24] this that he didn't even know he did and
[1:25:27] tell you Lila said the felicitous be
[1:25:31] upon thee Samson he rolls up and about
[1:25:34] he shook himself I didn't feel nothing
[1:25:38] didn't feel the power flowing didn't
[1:25:41] feel the power the power how many ever
[1:25:43] been under the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:25:45] even you felt it before so you know what
[1:25:47] it's like he knew what it was like so
[1:25:51] when he shook him seven didn't feel it
[1:25:53] he knew he was in trouble the devil
[1:25:56] plucked his eyes I made him a servant
[1:25:58] made him grind to me the whole thing -
[1:26:00] why because he lost influence of the
[1:26:03] Holy Ghost he came and then fluent of a
[1:26:05] woman David did the same thing came in
[1:26:08] the fluid of a woman Bathsheba looking
[1:26:11] out the window at the wrong place at the
[1:26:12] wrong time she brought in the
[1:26:14] battlefield he around the house Amen the
[1:26:17] woman out there washing and stuff he
[1:26:19] looks out there come under and flula
[1:26:21] woman form and he card over there and
[1:26:24] did what he did
[1:26:25] Samson and in the fluid of Delilah
[1:26:27] because of her beauty and now he lost
[1:26:30] s-- that influence the Holy Ghost left
[1:26:32] him here under food
[1:26:35] young influence of men they gonna beat
[1:26:37] him they're gonna punish it they're
[1:26:40] gonna talk to him why he did so much
[1:26:42] things to them God had him doing it see
[1:26:46] he he lost it his influence he came from
[1:26:51] under the influence of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:52] that power that moved him that power to
[1:26:54] Carson and be able to beat the
[1:26:56] Philistine that power that the caused
[1:26:58] him to live how you live he lost that
[1:27:00] power and the enemy took advantage of it
[1:27:02] and costing their be asleep you know the
[1:27:04] devil he put our eyes our two got our
[1:27:07] natural eyes our spiritual eyes you're
[1:27:10] blinded you can't see the word no more
[1:27:12] that what do you do when you come under
[1:27:14] the anointing come from under the Holy
[1:27:15] Ghost you're blind your eyes your
[1:27:17] spiritual eyes that you can't see the
[1:27:19] word you'll be blind it's best to be
[1:27:22] natural blind and spiritual blind
[1:27:24] because when the spiritual and the
[1:27:26] natural blind you still can see
[1:27:27] spiritually but when you're spiritually
[1:27:30] blind
[1:27:30] that's when truly in bad shape so I
[1:27:33] really be natural blind and spiritual
[1:27:34] blind when you're spiritually blind you
[1:27:36] in bad shape
[1:27:37] amen so Samson he lost its influence he
[1:27:42] lost it because of a woman Lord keep us
[1:27:46] in his last days keep us father in the
[1:27:50] name of Jesus Christ keep us we need to
[1:27:53] be kept look at now just go to the book
[1:27:55] of Acts X the ninth chapter
[1:28:12] Paul was one of those fella that served
[1:28:14] the church he served a church long he
[1:28:18] was serving the church you see was all
[1:28:20] right
[1:28:21] doing good everything he going wherever
[1:28:24] to whatever chief priests endtime at
[1:28:26] that were he went where the chief
[1:28:28] priests sent him to do no Paul did he
[1:28:31] was under the influence
[1:28:31] you thought Long's he did what they told
[1:28:33] him to do he was all right that's the
[1:28:36] case of a lot of people today I didn't
[1:28:39] do what the preachers they do yeah all
[1:28:41] right
[1:28:41] no because you gotta do what the words
[1:28:43] they do your preacher could be wrong I'm
[1:28:46] saying nothing about your pastor he
[1:28:47] understand in general your preacher
[1:28:49] gonna be wrong I mean I know that
[1:28:51] probably made a lot of mistakes and the
[1:28:54] God I have a few people to correct him

[1:29:02] thousand thank God somebody gives
[1:29:04] somebody enough unction just saying you

[1:29:09] somebody wasn't afraid to correct and
[1:29:11] not only think many other things if you
[1:29:13] look back and listen and read you see
[1:29:15] quoting scriptures wrong all that stuff
[1:29:17] from I see somebody got to have the Holy
[1:29:20] Ghost just say when you're wrong

[1:29:25] influence to be able to correct error
[1:29:27] somebody the Holy Ghost Ward Nord

[1:30:33] persecuting the very people of God but
[1:30:35] the guard came and broke the chains you
[1:30:38] can see now he not only the floors of
[1:30:41] the church he's under fluent of the Holy

[1:39:11] Jezebel's still here today inside the
[1:39:14] churches call people to leave God's Word
[1:39:17] and commit fornication spiritual
[1:39:19] fornication unnatural and some of the
[1:39:20] naturals among spiritual but net first

[1:39:27] the out of though it had came on The
[1:39:29] Jezabels influence see he made the

[1:40:18] and they didn't like Elijah didn't like
[1:40:19] you lied to the hit if you like the hit
[1:40:22] of the prophecy there was the problem is
[1:40:24] they hate the word you logic hit on
[1:40:27] their board us say at the Lord you
[1:40:29] didn't like you larger probably say the
[1:40:31] larger was a pastor but they hated him
[1:40:33] Elijah was their pastor you lied it was

[1:40:38] hippie pastor you had to love your past

[1:41:02] problem was didn't like it had didn't
[1:41:03] like our Elijah the he did Elijah the
[1:41:05] Bible says so they hated him see because
[1:41:08] why he always came with the word so a
[1:41:12] Jezebel with her influence took all the
[1:41:16] word away from the people all because of
[1:41:19] Ihab he had a weak are we
[1:41:23] need man they couldn't stand up on the
[1:41:25] Word of God the winner got a woman they
