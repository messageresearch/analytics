have talked about this for a long time i think a couple years actually and you know how cove had ruined everything made everything difficult traveling for a while was halted but praise god things are back to where we can travel a bit and it worked out and we thank god for that now we're together amen amen it's a privilege for me to be here and be able to see you and we want to show our appreciation and thanks for brother isaiah for inviting us and i've sure enjoyed the fellowship we've had so far brother it's been a blessing it's been something i've been looking forward to for a while and so i appreciate that and i want to bring you greetings from lyman from the home church believer's christian fellowship amen we've got some ties that go back and forth to des moines and lima and so it's good to see some familiar faces also it was a treat to have brother wesley god free and he not kadima travel with me so it was when i was on the plane i see them walking on it felt good i knew that plane couldn't go down there's too many believers on it so it was comforting and then i got a big surprise today when brother jonathan baumgartner's daughter were here so i didn't know they were coming god bless you appreciate the support and appreciate the surprise those are the kind of surprises i like i'm getting old enough now there's other surprises i don't like but i really appreciate them being here and i'm thankful that we could be together and look into god's word i'm thankful we have a word to look at today and we're not taking our own mind and our own understanding and one of 40 000 versions in christianity but god has taken us back to his original thought amen what he wanted in his word what his original desire and his original plan was he's brought us back to that so that we know what he expects of us today and what he's looking for and what we ought to be doing and we thank god for that it's a privilege friends so today i'd like to uh share just a thought with you on reconciling heaven and earth and i'd like to begin in the book of revelation if you'd like to turn there with me to revelation chapter 12. we'll read from there also my heart was heavy all day i was grieved and in tears as i learned of the passing of our brother stephen francis brother stephen was a very very dear friend of mine and it's been a tough day i know it has been for brother isaiah as well as myself and i was heartbroken but brother stephen was a wonderful brother he's one of the finest brothers i've ever known in this earth and uh i wasn't ready to think of him not being on this earth anymore i wasn't prepared for that i thought the lord would raise him up i've been praying so and it came as quite a blow but he's gone on to his reward and i'm thankful that he's in the sixth dimension rejoicing those that have gone before and he's better off than we are but because of that you know i've been meditating on that and really struggling with that all day but i'd like to dedicate this service to the lord jesus christ but i'd like to do so in honor of brother stephen francis because he's run his race he's finished his course he fought the good fight and he did it faithfully to the end in the end he was preaching every day over whatsapp to his congregation because they were shut down all the way until he got sick every day he was bringing a message and i said god bless him and he can't run anymore and he can't preach any more on this earth he can't do any more but now we can we can press on and i intend to do so with all that's in me more so than ever to bring honor to my brother for he was a great influence in my life and a great encourager to me in the ministry and so he'll be greatly missed but i want to i just want to honor him i want to honor our lord and continue to serve our master let's look together at revelation chapter 12 verse 3. and there appeared another wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his head and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast him to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born and let's bow our heads and ask the lord to bless the reading of his word dear lord jesus we thank you father for the privilege to come to you once again to gather together with the saints of like precious faith lord we're just asking lord that you would do what no man can do for through through a gift of education and literacy we can open a bible and read the words that are in our language but god without you we can have no revelation god we're not looking for understanding that comes from education we're coming looking for revelation that comes from you our father for you are the only source of revelation and god i pray that as we look into this word that you would open our eyes of understanding that we might see what it is you want us to see in this day and we might understand what it is you've given for us to understand in this day that we might run this race with patience that's set before us god i pray that you would bless us now as we look into your word may you have preeminence over everything that's done in every word that's spoken may all that we do bring glory and honor to your name in jesus christ's name we pray amen you can be seated so we look at this subject uh of reconciling heaven and earth and we're going to be looking at some of these things brother benham said and and it looks like it may be a deep subject but it's not a deep subject it's very very simple so don't don't get lost and think we're going to go deep we're not going to go deep we're going to stay where all of us live amen this is about living the word this is about living the word today and brother branham tells us in 1954 in a message questions and answers he says you know what that was now his tale wasn't like a fork tale like they say the devil was god it was the tale t-a-l-e the lie that he told amen but the man was telling us it wasn't the dragon's tale amen everything in revelation is symbolic because revelation is a book of symbols so that we know that the red dragon represents satan and we know the red dragon also represents rome amen because everything in here is symbolic and he said he grabbed the with his tail he drew a third part of the stars of heaven and then cast him to the earth and brother branham was saying not a tail like his tail like a physical tail but a tail the lie that he told the story that he told amen because we know that what happened in eden was a reflection of what happened in heaven so it was the lie that he told and it brought a deception in so much that there was a dis he deceived the angels in heaven that were in the very presence of god so it was a it was a deception and it was a very uh slippery deception to deceive those angels and he says brother says in the message that day on calvary and sin did not start on earth so we don't say amen we say the original sin and brother bennett used that term the original sin you know because of what took place in the garden of eden that was the original sin upon earth after the re-creation in genesis 1 2 that was the original sin on earth but the original sin took place in heaven so sin did not start on the earth sin started in heaven lucifer the devil was a condemned creature for his disobedience before he ever struck the earth sin began in heaven where god put the angels and so forth upon the same basis that he put human beings on knowledge the tree of knowledge the tree of life and the tree of knowledge where man could take his choice and when lucifer was given the preeminence to make his choice he wanted something better than god had that started the trouble what started the trouble he wanted something better he wasn't content with what god had gave him and wasn't content with god's kingdom amen he wanted something better let's go on in revelations chapter 12 and move down to verse 7. revelation 12 and 7 it says and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought in his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brotherness cast down which accused them before our god day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto death so we're going to look at this brother bam tells us this is a prophecy that will take place in the future when when lucifer the dragon the devil the serpent will be cast out of heaven and he'll come down to the earth and he'll incarnate the beast amen in the tribulation period we know that but this is also something that took place in the past he told us in the greatest battle ever fought he said this great first battle that was ever fought begin in heaven when michael and his angels fought against lucifer and his angels it first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on earth it originated in heaven this is the thing we want to lock in a prophet of god amen a prophet of god took us way back amen to the beginning and he took us way all the way to the end because with eagle vision he was able to lift up out of the natural and show us all the way back into the back part of god's mind when there was nothing amen when nothing existed when god dwelt alone and he wasn't even god yet he was the almighty he was elohim because god is an object of worship and there was nothing to worship him do you realize how privileged the people we are that through prophetic eyes amen if we just have faith in that and by revelation we can look back into the back part of god's mind from before the foundation world before the first creation of stardust or molecules or atoms or protons or neutrons before there is anything we can look back and say there was elohim with this thought and beyond that by revelation i could say i was there then and then we look all the way down to the end amen when the new heavens and the new earth come and heaven and earth unite amen and we can say i was there then and i will be there then amen and so what i'm doing now is playing out my part of the drama what i'm doing now god had in his mind something he wanted to achieve a goal a purpose and brother bam tells us in christ the mystery of god revealed that this whole bible is expressing one goal that god had one purpose one thing he wanted to achieve and every character and every time amen was a foreshadow was typing out showing the great story of god the one thing god wanted to achieve and now we're here as part of that one goal that one purpose that thing that he wanted to achieve it's important for us to keep focused on what god wants because it's so easy for us to get distracted with what we want and we take our journey in this life that may be 60 70 80 years amen if we're fortunate maybe 90 years and we take this journey in life and we become consumed with what we can attain and what goals we have for ourselves and what we can accomplish and what we can achieve i mean by doing so we can miss the whole purpose amen because when i was there as an attribute of god there was a plan that was formed in god's mind and i was part of that plan and i'm not here to take my own natural mind but i'm here to tap back into that original purpose for me being an attribute of god to display my part of the one goal the one thing he wanted to achieve and he's come to the final days of that achieving he's going to meet his goal but he's going to use you and i to do it and we've got to tune back in we've got to dial ourselves spiritually back in with the original purpose and the enemy's constantly trying to get us out of tune he'll bring every mechanism along to get us to move out of tune but why is it we continually listen to those tapes and read the book and stay in prayer and come to fellowship why are we doing this all the time to stay dialed in to stay tuned into god's one purpose he said the we're still in greatest battle ever fought he said as the first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on earth that originated in heaven and then it was thrown down from heaven cast out of heaven to the earth and fell on human beings then the battle from angels became human battles so the battle that started in heaven and the sin originated in heaven continues on today it's a war the first blow the first battle that started the first shot that was fired was fired by lucifer in heaven and that was the first battle but the war continues on and the battle that started in angels has now moved down into humans and it's the same fight that's going on today that started then and now the fight listen he says became human battles and satan came to destroy god's creation what god had created to be for himself he had satan came to destroy this that's what his purpose was was to destroy it then the battle begin here on earth and begin in us it has been raging ever since so now where is the battleground i am the battleground that's why sometimes you feel like you're at war in your mind you are at war in your mind because the greatest battle ever fought is being fought in the mind of man what started in the heavenly realm has now come down to earth what started in angels and now come to human beings and now is raging in us see it's important to realize these things that we're going to be tripped up by our life we're not going to understand why bad things are happening and why challenges are coming and why so many obstacles why are there so many obstacles to overcome if i'm a child of god and god i'm the beloved and i'm his bride and he loves me so much and cares for me why such hardship why such difficulty why do i suffer with everything else everybody else in the world suffers with amen because there's a battle going on and that battle is over the word of god and god is proving his word amen and to prove his word he's got to show that this word will overcome everything the devil has amen every defilement every perversion every sickness every disease i mean everything that he can possibly do in his perverted state to throw at you to trip you down there has to be a word that will overcome that to prove that god is victorious over his enemy and if we don't understand what's going on god is proving his word and the battle is in us and we don't understand what's happening amen what's happening is faith is being challenged because faith can rise to the occasion amen if we don't understand what those challenges are we get so distraught and we get depressed and we begin to doubt our salvation and we begin to doubt our brideship and our sonship and we we begin to falter in our mind and it's just because we have unrealistic expectations of what it means to be the bride remember brother branham said when they asked the question in malachi how did you love us when has you have you loved us he said they didn't understand the love of god they thought the love was parental care a baby in the arms of its parent nothing will harm it and he says they didn't understand his love his love is elective love how do i know he loved me because he told me so and because i have the capacity to believe his word i believe he loves me amen on my worst day he loves me when everything goes wrong he loves me when i lose my job and somebody stole my identity and wiped out my account he still loves me i'm not putting that in question because my feelings go up and down i'm not questioning his word his words as he loves me he chose me and i'm sticking with his word no matter what the obstacles are see that's what the battle's over the battle's over the word and the battle is raging in you so the next time something dreadful happens in your life quit throwing away your sonship quit doubting whether god loves you quit going back and saying what did i do wrong why is he punishing me he wasn't punishing job he was proving job amen he was proving his word through job there was not a punishment it was giving us he was giving his son a greater revelation and he was proving to the devil that there's one on earth that's not going to fall by your attack today so when things happen in life don't throw away all the ground that we've gained but realize there's an obstacle coming because there's a word that's going to overcome that obstacle god is going to meet the challenge and god will overcome the challenge if i will just stick with his word confess his word he will come and back up his word and he will prove that he is mightier than whatever this is so we have to trust the word of god because this is what the battle is over and the message marriage and divorce he said that was then now it was then man was made ruler over the woman he's going back to the fall by god's word she was no more co-equal with him she was co-equal in nature you know but when she broke god's word and made a man to be god made a man to be a ruler over her genesis 3 16 if you want to put it down she was no more equal with man she was the breaker of god's word don't you see she she the church down here the breaker of god's word that throwed her completely out of continuity and that's what the church has done is throw the spiritual death upon the whole thing now you understand why i hammer at these things like i do it's the truth this is bible facts then i'm going to skip down to paragraph 101 notice why did she do such a thing being in that high order she was right with man co-equal with him but we all know now that she lost her co-equalness with man when she sinned and god said man will be your ruler from here out now that's the scripture if you want if you want to we could read it skip down the paragraph 103. notice the reason she did that how did satan ever get to her verse 104 now he's going to make an interesting statement did you know satan was co-equal with god one day sure was all but a creator he was everything stood at the right hand of god in heaven the great leading cherubim brother it's like he just throws this in he does that a lot he's going along talking about the fall and how she was in a high state she was co-equal with man she was adam remember she did not get a name eve until after she committed adultery eve is her name of adultery that's why when brother brennan would come and preach blasphemous names showing all these churches taking a name shows that they are in adultery they're taking their own idea their own denominational name because eve didn't have a name in genesis 5 it says when he created adam he created him male and female and called their name adam so when god would come walking in the cool of the evening and he would cry if he wanted the male he would call adam and the male would run but when he wanted the female he would call adam and the female would rhyme because there was not two names there was one name there was not two beings in god's eye we look and see two but god saw one amen because they were one in the original and he pulled it out and brought them back together in the first marriage union that was ever on earth and he called their name adam to god they were one that was why the sin was such a horrible thing that divided the unity of the man and his wife because god saw them as one and after she was with child she had committed adultery after the fall adam called her name eve the mother of all living it's not a name to be proud of it shows her adultery god's taking this fall and her now falling from a state of co-equalness now and and by failing to keep the word now she's put under the headship of man and go brother brendan when he's preaching this he throws in there do you know satan was co-equal with man one with god one day all but a creator he was everything but a creator he could not create but satan lost his position because he rebelled against the word of god and brother ben was showing us that this fallen eden is a reflection of a fall in heaven there was first a fall in heaven which one fell god's right hand man the one that was co-equal to him a covering cherubim that was here covering his shekinah glory one of the greatest angels of all time one of the greatest angels in the heavenly realm the one that was closest to him is the one that fallen the same thing happened to adam and the eden what fell one of the two great beings amen one the right hand of adam fell showing that what's taking place in eden was a reflection or or shadowed of what took place in heaven see we've come to the day where the bride has grown up she's not to be a child anymore she's not to think like a child she's not to have narrow vision they men the denominational blinders have been taken off so she can see the full peripheral and she can understand why things are the way they are in this day why we're in the condition that we're in and what it's going to take to get out of this condition so we thank god for that brother ben said do you know what caused the first battle in heaven was when lucifer set up a greater class of people got a better class of angels he thought a big a a big bigger kingdom a more brighter shinier kingdom than michael had and he was kicked out of heaven so lucifer wanted big bright shiny great and you have to imagine what was the kingdom of michael like god was reflecting himself in an angelic being a michael which was a pre-figure of christ the type of christ in the angelic form and he had a kingdom but lucifer thought that he could have a better kingdom if lucifer thought you'd have a better kingdom what does that tell you about the kingdom of michael the kingdom of christ it must have not been the greatest most beautiful visually attractive maybe it was humble maybe it was like when christ come to earth he was humble maybe lucifer something in lucifer when he looked at that he said i can do better he looked at what god had created and he thought that he could do better that he could have brighter there could be a greater splendor amen they're god it goes to show god amen when he was in the kingdom of michael didn't produce the greatest splendor that he could ever produce because god is known in humility christ is understood through humility let's turn to ezekiel 28 and look at this scripture together ezekiel 28 and verse 11 we're going to look at a description of lucifer ezekiel 28 11. moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man take up a lamentation against the king of tyrus and say unto him thus saith the lord god thou sealest up the sum full of wisdom and perfect in beauty thou has been in eden the garden of god we know he's taking the lamentation against the king of tyrus but he's actually showing in type the spirit behind the king of tyres which is the spirit of the devil the spirit of lucifer and so he's calling them out he says thou seelest up the sum full of wisdom and perfect in beauty that's why when we have little childish images of the devil with a fork stick and red and ugly with with horns out of his head that that is the exact the deception that the devil wants you to take he wants you to think that he's nasty ugly filthy all of these things but when god describes him he doesn't describe any other being in creation the way that he describes this angel thou sealest up the sum that means you have everything full of wisdom and perfect in beauty brother bram said it's not the farmer with bibbed overalls you got to worry about with your wife it's that slicker that comes in the three-piece suit with the gold ring on his pinky that's the guy you got to watch amen he says now thou has been in eden the garden of god every precious stone was thy covering the sardis the topaz and the diamond the barrel the onyx the jasper the sapphire the emerald carbuncle and gold the workmanship of thy tablets of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that that was created thou art the anointed cherub that covereth and i have set thee so that was upon the holy mountain of god that was walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire that was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created to iniquity was found in thee by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence and thou has sinned therefore i will cast this profane out of the mountain of god and i will destroy the o covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness i will cast you to the ground i will lay thee before kings that thou may behold thee thou has defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of the iniquities by the iniquity of thy traffic therefore will i bring forth a fire from the midst of thee and shall devour thee and i will bring thee to ashes upon the earth and the sight of all them that behold thee when god describes lucifer it's not the picture that you see in your denominational coloring book it's always when lucifer has come to deceive the children of god he's always coming to church he's come behind the pulpit and he was nice friendly good looking that's why i know i'm not his agent by the time you get done reading this slightly below average becomes great place to be because he was deceived by his own brightness he was corrupted by his own beauty that he was made so perfect amen without any flaw that he was deceived by his own perfection and so you could see why a creature like this could look at the kingdom of michael and he could get lifted up within himself in pride and arrogancy and he could say i can do better than that i can have greater than that amen and he began to play with fire and he was cast out of heaven so we know in that great battle that lucifer was cast out of heaven amen and the question that i've always had is when we get to revelation chapter 12 how did he get back in heaven what was he doing there because brother balaam shows that as a prophecy of the end time when he's cast down and incarnates the beast and he says when the bride goes up satan comes down so he was already cast out of heaven what's he doing back in heaven and it's a question that was in my mind so i just wanted to spend some time looking at that brother bam says in the message i will restore which i thought was unique it was preached here in des moines in 1954. i didn't do that on purpose it just happened and we've noticed that satan in the beginning in the original back in the initial condition he was full of pomp he wouldn't something a better kingdom than michael so he goes over the north and sets him up a kingdom greater more beautiful don't you see how beauty is deceitful and how our churches today are seeing who can build the biggest church who can make the best pews who can get the best dressed crowd the more honorable people among the city to come that's all of the devil you may be angry with me after this but when i meet you at judgment you'll know that i've spoke to you in the name of the lord that's right we can't humble ourselves anymore we got to have the big the refined the best the everything like and knowing that those things come from satan always has been it was in heaven that's the reason he was kicked out that's what he's doing here on earth taking the churches and deceiving them god doesn't dwell in big buildings he doesn't dwell among the fine dressed people he doesn't have to have that god wants a humble heart to dwell in let's turn to isaiah 53 and we'll look at a different description of another being the first description was of lucifer now we're going to look at a description of the son of god isaiah 53 and 1 who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground he has no form nor comingness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men now listen this is not the description we read in ezekiel of lucifer this is the description of jesus christ there's no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace is upon him and with his stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened on his mouth he was brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before shears is dumb so he opened not his mouth he was taken from the prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich and death because he had he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul and offering for sin he shall see a seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquity therefore will i divide him a portion with the great and shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bear the sins of many and made intercession for the transgressors i'm glad lucifer wasn't sent to take my place he could never humble himself low enough but god himself could come down in flesh in his own flesh that he created as the son of god and he could become so humble there was no beauty that we desire him there was nothing that would attract men to him the only thing that was attraction was the word amen was the character that he had the character that reflected the nature of god and the word that he brought forth amen he had nothing else he had no armies he had no wealth he had he had no status he had no position he had no no comeliness he had nothing that would attract men the only thing he had was the character of god in the word of god and we come today and god has showed up not in an intellectual giant but in a kentucky hillbilly with a seventh grade education because it matches his nature amen he had to get somebody that could humble themselves somebody that could be broken amen somebody that could suffer the affliction amen for us for you and i brother branham when he wouldn't go out with the pentecostals he was broken why was he broken he was broken because there was a message that had to come to me he bore he and me he bore suffering he bore humiliation he bore rejection amen i mean there was nothing comely about him there was no intellect that would draw men there was nothing in the way he presented himself that would draw men unto him it was the character of god and it was the word that drawed the seed of god when god came he wasn't looking for the whole world he was looking for his that were in the world he said i don't pray for the world but i pray for mine that are in the world and when god sent this hillbilly from kentucky with poor grammar and no education and no finances and no denominational backing and no prestige and no status he sent him because he didn't want to draw the whole world he only wanted to draw the elect so we bring him in humility because only the elect amen that have the nature of god locked in their soul will understand humility amen the rest of the world doesn't understand it because lucifer doesn't understand humility he looked at michael's kingdom and he said i could do better he didn't understand that behind the humble kingdom of michael of christ amen was all the power of god god didn't have to show it off god could restrain himself because god wanted to attract by character he didn't want to attract by glory he didn't want to attract by beauty he wanted to attract the attraction is the character lucifer had every other attraction but he had no character amen and now this world is attracted to everything that has no character amen they're attracted to fashions and entertainment and all the things of the world but there's no character behind it but god sent a man with nothing so that he could give us everything so we don't look for shiny things we look for character in the message christ is the mystery of god revealed he says notice lucifer in the last days is doing as he did it first what did lucifer do the first thing that lucifer done to separate the fellowship of god and man he wanted to build him a united kingdom a greater splendor and seemingly more cultured a greater kingdom than michael christ had you got it now if you miss it just hold up your hand and i'll say it again praise god i would have had my hand up the whole time brother brennan say it again brother lucifer at the beginning his purpose in heart was to achieve a brighter greater thing in heaven than christ had is that right by seemingly a more cultured more beautiful more splendor than the kingdom of christ in the fourth seal brother ben says look what this is all coming to what is it it's going right back the way it did it started in heaven is coming to the endtime battle the first thing in heaven was a battle lucifer was kicked out and come to the earth then he polluted eden then he's been polluting ever since and now from the battle in heaven it's come to the battle on earth and is to be finished on earth at the time in a battle called armageddon now anyone knows that the battle started in heaven and so they kicked him out michael and his angels overthrow them just run out and when they did it dropped right down into eden and here started the battle down here so we know that to be true that there was a great war that broke out in heaven when lucifer rebelled against god and he thought that he could do better he didn't understand the humility of god he didn't understand the simplicity that he saw he didn't understand the character all he understood was brightness wisdom grandeur that's all he could uncomprehend and he would look at this and think he could do better so he was cast out there was war between michael and his angels they fought with lucifer and his angels and cast him out amen but in revelation 12 brother branham said that there's going to be another casting house so the question is how did he get back in genesis chapter 3 let's look there genesis chapter 3. verse 1 now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said you shall eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die for god doesn't know in the day that you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and should be as gods knowing good and evil now he's beginning to entice the woman he asks a question and she answers the question and he begins to contradict the word of god and she should have run from that but he begins to appeal to her reasoning and he begins to explain to her that you'll have more as if what you have now from god is not enough but you'll have more you'll be as gods knowing good and evil your eyes shall be open and you'll be as gods knowing good and evil now listen god there's things that god did not want them to know he didn't need for them to know evil amen he said you'll be as gods knowing good and evil up to this point they only knew good so the devil's presenting something to eve as if god is holding out on you as if you're not getting everything that's available amen but god knows that if you take this tree your eyes will be open amen but they were under a veil of innocency they were blinded under a veil of innocency it was a good thing but the lucifer begins to say there's more knowledge there's more understanding you'll know good and evil amen and now amen god was protecting his children from evil but eve was going to open the door to evil and then your eyes would be open and then now they would know good and evil god was protecting them from the evil because we know that heaven was now because of the rebellion because of the fall there was now sin that had broke out in heaven god had told lucifer you have defiled your sanctuaries there was a defilement that took place in heaven and now when when after the fall when he sets cherubim with flaming swords and eastward and eden lest they come and take the tree of life and live forever amen when he says that he says man has become like one of us knowing good and evil what do you mean become like one of us because before rebellion in heaven there was only good but after the rebellion in heaven evil now was presented in heaven sin began in heaven there was a defilement of the sanctuaries of lucifer in heaven and now god amen comes down to earth to create an eden and then that eden is called pleasure and eastern and eden he plants a garden and he places his son and now he's making something for himself that doesn't have good and evil it only has good and he puts them under a veil of innocency and now they're in a condition like heaven was before the fall but lucifer comes just like he did to deceive the angels he comes right around and he says you're lacking there's more there can be something greater than the kingdom of michael there's something more to be had and he begins to deceive eve with a with a temptation of more more understanding more knowledge and he doesn't realize what that more knowledge will do what that greater understanding will do to her god has her under a veil of innocency he has him in only good with no evil now lucifer is trying to bring eden into the same condition that heaven is in and after she takes and partakes of that now god says man has now become like one of us knowing good and evil now what heaven has gone through now the earth has gone through the same wow so now there's a problem in heaven and there's a problem on earth and look at what what eve does after this dialogue with the serpent verse six and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took her the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also to her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons when the woman looked at the tree before this discussion with serp the serpent it doesn't say she ever considered the tree because the word said to avoid it but after this discussion when the wise one because the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field he had more understanding when the wise one came and said there's more than what god has given you then she began to desire more and then she looked at the tree and when she looked at the tree her eyes told her that it looked good for food that that it was pleasant to the eyes a tree to be desired to make one wise and she took the fruit thereof and did eat when she finally looked at the tree and considered the tree she couldn't find anything wrong with the tree and you know what she finds about that tree god never said that those things weren't true god never said that it wasn't good for food he never said that it wasn't desirable and they never said it wasn't pleasant to the eyes god never said that he just said leave it alone so what she saw everything she saw may have been true all those things were true but in her own reasoning now she couldn't understand why god would keep me from this tree everything i see is good so by her own reasoning by her own brightness by her own wisdom by her own intellect she decides to take the tree because she can't find fault with the tree but god said don't touch it god said don't eat of it and she rebelled against the word of god because of her own understanding this is why in this day god has brought us a word through this prophet and it doesn't matter whether you understand it or not amen you take what the prophet said amen he's the one that god lifted up and and he revealed to him the word he gave him the revelation of the entire word and he come and he told us things to avoid amen things god likes things god doesn't like and it's not for us to say well i don't know what's so bad about that brother venom taught us to stay away from some of these things he taught us the right truth on marriage and divorce and interracial marriage and all of these other stuff and people go to look at that and they start reasoning it out and say well i don't see what's so wrong with that i can't figure it out i can't understand it it's not for us to figure out it's for us to believe the word of god i don't know why he said that i don't know why he said that he said it because he was the prophet of the age and god used him as a mouthpiece and now he began to use her own reasoning she couldn't find fault with the tree so she took it and now man has become like one of us knowing good and evil now eden was now in the same condition earth was now in the same condition that heaven was in having had sin break out in it now because sin started in heaven let's turn to job chapter 6 or job chapter 1 i'm sorry job chapter 1. job chapter 1 verse 6. now there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan came also among them now we find satan's back in heaven was satan cast out he was cast out war with michael and the angels he was cast out the prophet god told his cast out and then he went to eden but now when we get to the book of job and brother banham says job is the oldest book in the bible now when we get to the book of job we find satan back in heaven now when the sons of god present themselves to god now satan comes also now he's in heaven he's presenting himself when the sons of god are presenting and he's having dialogue he says and now the lord said unto satan whence cometh thou then satan answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth from walking up and down on them the lord said unto satan hast thou considered my servant job there is none like him in all the earth and the earth a perfect and an upright man one that feareth god and a skew of evil then satan answered the lord and said does job fear god for naught look at what he's doing would you say he's making an accusation against the character of job the job fear god for not hast thou not made a hedge about him and about his house and about all that he hath on every side thou has blessed the work of his hands and his substances increased in the land but put forth thine hand now and touch all that he hath and he will curse thee to thy face now let's go back to revelation 12. remember my question is what's he doing back in heaven we know that when he was in heaven the first time when he was created he had a title his name was lucifer but he had a title his title was covering cherub he was the covering cherub but now he's no longer the covering cherub he lost that title he lost that position was cast out but now we find in in revelation 12 it says let's go back to verse 7 and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought in his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out in the earth and his angels were cast out with him and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down now he has a new title he's no longer the covering chair of now he's the accuser of the brethren when did he get the right to accuse the brethren when they fell in eden now in the fall in eden now he becomes the accuser of the brethren and now his position in heaven is no longer covering cherub but now his position in heaven is accuser of the brethren when does he get cast down let's look at that when the bride goes up he comes down now he's there as accuser of the brethren in job we find in the oldest book in the bible the sons of god present himself he comes along and god says if you consider job and he makes an accusation against job he says does job serve thee for not it's just because you protect him it's not because he loves you not because he's right what's he doing he's the accuser of the brethren all the way back in job amen when did he start accusing the brother when they fell from the word of god he became the accuser of the brethren and gained access into the heavenly realm to accuse the brethren the seed of god before god but he's going to lose that position amen he's going to lose it he's going to be cast out in the end time amen listen god knew that eden was going to be defiled before he ever created it brother graham said in the invisible union paragraph 208 when you see the woman a byproduct not another female liker made in the order knowing that she could be deceived god knowed if he didn't know the end from the beginning then he wasn't god if he isn't if if he isn't infinite if he isn't he can he can't be infinite without being omniscient omnipresent knowing all things eternal so he knowed all things and he had to make that woman the man didn't have a wife the wife and the man was the same thing he had the feminist masculine spirit in himself he had to separate take a byproduct after the whole creation was made no female created by god in the original creation can do a thing like that she was made thus to do it he knowed she would do it he didn't if he didn't he wasn't god so god is telling brother telling us the reason god made the woman the way he made the woman was so that she could be deceived listen but see the attributes that's in god had to be displayed amen he was to be savior and to make everything perfect the way he had it then there could be nothing lost oh don't be children be men and women we're at the end road noticed brother bam said don't be children be men and women grow up in christ amen grow up into the knowledge and understanding of christ and then god knew before eden that there was going to be a fall how do we know because he had a he had a book of life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world before the world was formed amen he already had names written in a book why was their names written in the book they were the ones that would be redeemed why did he know who would be redeemed because something would need redemption why was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world because he knew he would need to have a lamb slain for redemption before there was a fall in eden in god's mind before the fall he already had a lamb slain amen amen so god knew there would be a fallen need that's why he made the woman the byproduct of the man and made her a weaker vessel so that she could be deceived because there was attributes that were locked inside of god that had to be displayed and without the fall we would never come to a full understanding of god amen but god says in isaiah 46 he said remember the former things of old for i am in god and there is none else i am god and there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and i will do all my pleasure god's plan is not being tripped up by the devil god's great plan is not he's not adjusting his plan by the movements of the devil god has not gotten tripped in his desire and his plan from before the foundation world because before the foundation of the world he had the name of those that would be redeemed he had a lamb that was slain he was oh so just the fact that there was a fall in eden didn't trip god one bit amen he didn't disrupt his plan one iota god knew what was going to do the satan was playing right into the hand of god god knew before he recreated the earth there was a judgment that took place before and genesis 1 1 is the original creation of heaven and earth then you find the earth in a state of judgment now god is coming and recreating or reforming the earth and he's doing this so that he can create something for his pleasure and he creates it for his pleasure and he knows as he's forming it as he's positioning the sun as he's moving the moisture off of the earth and dry lands up here he knows the whole time he's doing this there's going to be a fall he knows corruption is going to set in upon this earth he knows it's going to happen amen because he's going to do all his pleasure he's declared from ancient times the things that are not yet he already knows what's going to happen he's bringing up the plants he's creating the birds he's creating the fishes in the sea everything he's doing he already knows it's going to fall that's why when he comes to eden he puts the tree of knowledge of good and evil in the garden of eden if you and i were doing this we would say hey no no no wait a minute what happens if they eat from that tree or they eat from that tree they'll die well don't put it there you and i we wouldn't put it there but that's because we don't understand the mind of god god put it there he wanted it there it was going to accomplish his purpose he knew they would eat of it he knew there would be a fall he knew corruption and perversion was said and he knew death would fall upon man he knew satan would set up the squatter's rights he knew there would be a satan's eating after 6 000 years he knew it but he did it and doing it must fit into his plan see it's not that satan makes a move it's not like satan makes a move and god goes oh that was a good one i didn't see that coming then god makes another move but he's smarter so he can always outsmart him that's not how this works before the devil ever makes a move god said i knew he was going to do that do you understand this is not time to be children the eagle age we've been lifted out of the carnal into the spiritual we've been living off the natural understanding into a spiritual understanding to know our god to know our men to know our husband and the adoption he says so beautiful displayed in the prodigal son i was lost this is my son he was lost and now he's found he was dead and he's alive again bring forth the fatted calf the best robe a ring and put it on his finger no wonder when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy when they seen the plan of salvation you catch that all the way in job he says where were you when the sons of god shouted for joy and the morning stars sang together where were you and brother ben i'm saying now listen no wonder the morning stars sing together the sons of god shout out for joy when they seen the plan of salvation god putting your name on the book before the foundation of the world the sons of god in the mind of god they saw the plan of salvation before there was a fall that's why when when this revelation comes there's something in us says amen it's because god shared with you the plan before when you were in the mind of god he shared with you the plan and you got so excited you shouted and copped your head and danced a little bit and said that's a good plan father that'll work amen and now when all this corruption sets in amen now we look back and understand god knew god had a lamb slain before the foundation of the world satan's not tripping up god he's moving right in but this whole creation is a trap and satan is falling into the trap and at some point the trap door is going to shut amen and we're not going to deal with our enemy anymore i see this satan's the trap and you're the bait and he comes after you because he come after eve there was a trap set god needed the fall to display his attributes in his mind he had a lamb slain and there's no point for a lamb slain unless there's a fall here in eden so he created a weaker vessel and the devil began to exploit the weakness that was in the woman she could be enticed amen and she she could be seduced and he began to explore that weakness and he thought ah i found a place here where i can enter in i found a weak spot god must have missed this and there's a trap set and eve is the bait and the devil's coming around and he's sniffing the bait he doesn't know there's a big old trap right there and he's going to get he's going to get trapped he's gonna be destroyed because he took the bait in the fourth seal the man said god had his children all fortified up by his word and eve stuck her neck out and said i believe you're right and there it went it's ever since and god come down now he's got to he come down to redeem those that would come down god already knew we would come down he already showed us the plan of redemption and he come down to redeem those that would come down god is like a big contractor he's laying out all his material on earth and then he builds his building now remember before there was grain of seed on earth before there was a sun that ever struck the earth your body was laying on the earth because you are the dust of the earth you are god's the contractor listen before there was a fall in eden my body was already laying here god's a great contractor he knew the bride that he was going to build and he already put the material for my body here because he knew i would be here he knew i would be here in satan's eden he knew the perversion that would be all around me he knew what was going to take place and he knew where he placed me and he knew where he placed you god has not made a mistake i mean don't don't dare say i wish i lived in the prophet's day god ordained you to live in this day oh i wish i lived back then and i wish i lived back when i could take a prairie scooter blah blah blah blah blah no you don't because before the foundation of the world when you were in the mind of god he showed you the plan of salvation and you said that's a good plan but then begin to clap your hands you already knew where your place would be you already knew what time you would be on this earth that's why when the message comes to you it's got a familiar sound to it because there's a seed of god an attribute of god that come from the mind of god way down on the inside that was there amen when the plan was formulated and god didn't want you any other time he wants you at this time you see but it's so wicked i can barely live he ordained you to live he ordained you to overcome he ordained you this is a trap amen it's a bride trap and you're the bait the devil comes around you and says it looks so weak not very smart doesn't have much money if i just make the transmission go out in this truck he's going to be devastated he'll curse god to his face he'll be discouraged he won't go to church on sunday he'll be so upset he'll doubt whether he's the son of god or not it's debate he's going to come and try to wreck your day and wreck your life and wreck your home he doesn't realize there's a power there there's a 10 000 volt wire he's going to get at home that's going to singe his feathers when he gets a hold of it because it's not just a little earthly vessel you're looking at but there's a god down on the inside by a new birth the attributes of god has sprung the life and the spirit of god is living there amen and there's faith to take god at his word and defeat everything the enemy will throw our way jesus tells us the son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost if it was lost it was first found it can't be found unless it was lost it can't be lost unless it was with god this is my pen if i lose this pen and find this pen i didn't find something new i didn't gain anything i just got back what was already with me if i lose this pin and you bring me this pin that's not salvation that's not redemption that's not finding my pen that's replacing my pen and god's not replacing anything god seeking to save that which was lost god knew it would be lost he knew from this condition and he came down with a message in this day to pull back his original creation his original attribute and bring it right back to himself let's go to colossians chapter one colossians chapter one now pay attention closely for a few minutes as we begin to wind down and really get to the heart of what i'm really wanting to share colossians 1 15. brother branham reads this scripture when he's coming to christ as the mystery god revealed he's reading down through here and he injects a comment and i'm going to share that with you when we get to that scripture but i'd like to begin reading at verse 15. who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church which is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things and to himself by him i say whether there be things in earth or things in heaven and brother benham stops reading here and he injects this statement he says watch where that reconciliation went he's talking about christ coming in a bodily form and dying amen to reconcile us back to god but he says now listen i want to read it again in verse 20 and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things all things all things unto himself by him i say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven now listen christ come and took a body of flesh for redemption because of the fall in the garden of eden but i'll say further back christ come and took a body of flesh to die on calvary not just for redemption of what happened in eden but for reconciliation what happened in heaven because he reconciled in the body of his flesh all things by him all things whether they be things in earth or things in heaven this is why before god when god was creating eden he knew it would fall but god is going to fix a big problem and that problem started in heaven when lucifer fell and he's using this creation and he's using this plan and everything he's doing now is to fix that problem there because remember when lucifer fell he was cast out of heaven he come to earth and brought corruption in eden but listen he was not destroyed he was not destroyed and you realize why didn't god destroy him well we know because the prophet told us he needed a good adversary so he could pull out all of the attributes of god there needed to be a negative there needed to be something to create corruption and and and and deception and all these things that would pull out the nature of god but god also operates by his laws amen and there's laws in heaven just like there's laws on earth and when god operates by his laws when lucifer fell something prevented god from destroying him because god always operates by his laws something prevented god from destroying him but we know that ultimately lucifer will be destroyed so god now is creating a trap in eden he's creating a new creation upon the earth after destruction has come and at the end of this cycle of redemption at the end of this we know beyond the shadow of a doubt that lucifer is thrown into the lake of fire and he's completely destroyed because of the judgment of god as judge so god through this creation through this life cycle through this redemption he is not just reconciling things on earth but he's reconciling heaven and earth this is so much bigger than we think friends this is so much beyond our carnal understanding this is so big it's so beyond our 70 or 80 years upon this planet we can't think like children anymore we've got to understand god has sent us down as an attribute of god as his son upon this earth because he's reconciling everything that has went wrong is being reconciled everything that's been made wrong is now being made right and you and i are here as living attributes of god part of the reconciliation redemption process amen so that when we unite back with heaven it's not going to be a heaven where lucifer can be accuser of the brethren it's not going to be where lucifer can bring any more deception but things are being purged purified cleansed transitioned until he can be it's annihilated just about going to work on monday it's not just about having a retirement account it's not just about the next car i can buy or a change of clothes i can get it's not about my next vacation those things are fine they're not evil in and of themselves but when they become distractions against the purpose god put you on this earth for amen it begins to take away it because satan begins to take away from the original purpose the plan of god don't forget that you saw the plan of salvation and you shouted and rejoiced that you say amen today because you said amen that day so don't get distracted from your purpose on this planet don't get distracted by those natural things keep in mind when you buy a car you buy a car as a son of god because i'm here for a purpose of god and i need that car to do whatever god wants me to do even if you take a rest like brother ben took a rest and took a vacation i'm doing it for strength because i'm here for a purpose i'm not just here seeking pleasure i'm not just here doing all that i can to satisfy myself i'm here as an agent of god almighty to reverse the curse that's set in in heaven there's a trap set and after this trap is sprung at the end of the millennium lucifer is annihilated god's problem is fixed forever watch where that reconciliation went he says it went to heaven too let's turn to hebrews 9. i just want to reinforce this statement i don't want you to get the idea that brother chad's just making things up brother branham taught us these things friends we've come to the end time to the final dispensation to the final battles to the final round and god has given us his mind so that we won't be tripped up in this final hour let's look at hebrews 9 and 19 for when moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book and all the people saying this is the blood of the testament which god hath enjoined unto you moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood is no remission of sins now pay close attention it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in heaven what is the patterns of things in heaven moses was told to make the tabernacle after the pattern of what he saw in heaven so moses made on earth the pattern of the heavenly things and that pattern had to be purged purified with these now let's read this it was therefore necessary what were they purged with blood it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in heaven should be purified with these but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these you mean the heavenly things needed purified if the heavenly things needed purified it means the heavenly things had been defiled how had the heavenly sanctuary been defiled when the covering cherub rebelled against the word of god and brought defilement into his sanctuaries now there's a defilement in heaven and jesus's very shedding of blood and giving of life he would carry that life now into the heavenly realm to purify the things that are in heaven so that means the very earth and the creation of the earth and the plan of redemption is not just for earth it's for heaven too even christ dying at calvary wasn't just for natural things not just for earth it was for the heavenly things too so this reconciliation and all things in christ jesus is reconciling heaven and earth the blood the life the blood of the high priest had to go beyond the veil into the heavenly sanctuary to purify the heavenly things see we get so small-minded and worried about our little trouble we get so small-minded and tormented by this little thing we're dealing with and we miss this is all part of this plan it's all part of the reconciliation of all things it's all part of reversing the curse it's all part of defeating lucifer it's all part of god's great plan to purify to cleanse to destroy his enemy now let's look at second corinthians chapter five ii corinthians chapter 5. now before we go there i just want to i just feel like i want to inject this thought we know that something's wrong in the heavenly realm because there's an accuser of the brethren there something's wrong in the heavenly realm we know there's something wrong in the heavenly realm because remember when gabriel was dispatched to daniel because daniel began to pray daniel began to pray and he wanted understanding of the revelation that was in jeremiah 70 weeks and gabriel was dispatched but gabriel comes to him in the book of daniel and says on the first day that i began to pray i was sent with a message to you but the prince of the nation of persia withstood me and you say well an angel of god can do anything he wants don't forget heaven's a reflection of this dimension and this dimension there's laws and there's jurisdictions and there's hierarchies and that dimension there's the same thing and brother bam talks about this in demonology he's very clear about there's a whole spiritual realm and a whole demonic realm and now in the in the heavenly realm daniel's praying and listen the the the world the the heavenly realm is so dependent on the children of god on earth putting it in action daniel's prayer put gabriel in action until daniel prayed nothing was moving amen we think heaven's heaven and earth earth you don't realize amen that what you're doing here is having an effect over there amen brother bam said everything you see here is a reflection of something over there and what you're doing here is putting something in motion something in action daniel began to pray and gabriel began to move when daniel began to pray he said the very day that you prayed i was sent amen but this prince of persia of the nation of persia which stood in me and i had to go back and get michael a higher ranking angel and now michael helped me break through to you do you realize something's wrong in heaven if there's an angel over persia that could withstand gabriel something needs to be eliminated in heaven amen something needs to be purged out of that heavenly realm so heaven and earth can move free under the commandment of god again see the apostle paul tells us that we don't war with flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and kingdoms in high places that word high means heavenly this earth we're not at war with anything on this earth but we are at war with principalities powers and kingdoms in the heavenly realms that's what we're at war with that's why when he says the weapons our warfare are not carnal amen but spiritual into bringing down strongholds look at the strongholds casting down imagination where's the greatest battle ever thought and every thought that exalted itself against the knowledge of god where is the warfare taking place in you what are the weapons given to us not carnal because it's not a carnal battle it's a spiritual battle and our weapons are spiritual to fix the problem the war in your mind the cast down and to bring into captivity every thought that exalted itself against the knowledge of christ our warfare is with principalities and powers not in high places not in the government not in washington not in the kremlin that's not the heavenly places and we're at war against those powers in heavenly places and when a son of god on earth begins to pray and begins to pray the word and begins to seek revelation it puts heaven in motion and warfare breaks out i think if we could peek into the other side we'd be shocked right now at the warfare that's breaking out at this message right now and all the the realms of evil that is that are trying to withstand the revelation of good and the angels of the lord that are coming in to back up the word amen because they're ministering spirits sent to minister to the children of god brother branham come to break us out of carnal thinking and so we know that that's the warfare and we know that when we here on earth began to take spiritual insight it begins to move things in the spiritual realm let's look at second corinthians chapter five now verse 16. wherefore henceforth know we know man after the flesh yea though we have known christ after the flesh yet not henceforth knoweth we him no more therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of god who has reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation so god hath reconciled us paul saying god hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ because jesus christ in his flesh he reconciled all things in heaven and earth now through jesus christ god had reconciled paul back to himself but then paul says and hath given us the ministry of reconciliation so now that reconciliation between heaven and earth that ministry is now given to paul and paul now has the ministry of reconciliation to wit look at this to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for christ what are you here to do you're here to finish the work of reconciliation what's being reconciled all things both heaven and in earth and committed unto you is the word of reconciliation and now we are ambassadors representatives representing christ we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us as though god is calling to you through our lips as though god did beseech you by us we pray you in christ's dead we call to you in the place of christ instead of christ we're here instead of jesus christ because he's here in us we pray you in christ's dead be ye reconciled to god be ye reconciled to god for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him where is that ministry of reconciliation now it's in the bride what is it we've been called to it's a higher work than just try to be nice at work and try to be good to your neighbor and try not to steal time from work and be honest it's more than that friend we've been given the word of reconciliation and that reconciliation is reconciling all things that were reconciled in the flesh of jesus christ it's for the destruction and elimination of lucifer not so we keep playing games with him anymore but we're here on this earth to destroy him amen that's what brother branham said i want to look at a few quotes here let's look at my new ministry from 1959 my new ministry i'm starting paragraph 95. now you say well if he knows it then why are you preaching if god knows all things then why are you preaching if he knows who will be saved and who won't why are you preaching he said that's part of god's program preaching is his program when he looked upon the apostles he looked upon the harvest he said the harvest is ripe and the laborers refuse pray the lord of the harvest that he will send laborers into his harvest how many remembers that well why would they have to pray to the lord of the harvest to send laborers into the harvest if the lord of the harvest was standing there knowing it would be done why god has so arranged it now listen to this god has so arranged it that his program cannot move without you and die and as long as we're not doing what god leads us to do we are paralyzing his program but when the church moves by the anointing of the holy ghost then we are in god's will doing this program remember when daniel began to pray for the revelation of 70 weeks it was at the time that god was going to bring them back and and it was at time that god was going to return them to babylon but god could not initiate gabriel he could not initiate the movement he could not bring the transition until daniel began to pray when daniel began to pray now god says can go gabriel now it's time god had so worked his program that it couldn't move without daniel and when daniel started praying now god was saying now it's time it's now time to get to start gabriel you go gabriel couldn't go and can michael i need your help it's time amen and now after that meeting after the the king of the prince of persia began to withstand gabriel wouldn't let him in michael come and open the door he got in now he tells him now i got to go and i'm going to go back and fight that king of persia because the king of greece is going to come in the very prayer of daniel started a sequence of events that will collapse the medes and persians and bring alexander the great in to collapse that kingdom to keep the plan of god moving with the image from gold down to the chest of silver down into the the belly and thighs of brass it was now a transition time and god had to have somebody on the earth with a spiritual sensitivity to begin calling out and asking god and then god would put the wheels in motion it was god's redemption plan but god has linked heaven and earth through his attributes and god can't move without you and i and as long as we're not moving under the leadership of the holy ghost we are paralyzing god's program amen that's why we've got to set everything aside and this word has to become everything to us this message is in another doctor there's not another movement it's not another church this message is the revelation of what god is doing in this hour it is the culmination of the gentile dispensation it is the plan of god and he's got to have people on the earth that are calling out and crying out for every promise to be fulfilled amen so that god can dispatch the angels so that the things in heaven can begin to move if you only knew the warfare that was going on right now amen we would be more diligent about prayer we'd be more sincere about this word we would stop playing around with the world and quit fooling around with all this nonsense it would focus us in it would hone us down it would tune us up because everything's moving as the children of god are moving in the plan of redemption let's look at luke chapter 10. luke chapter 10 in luke chapter 10 god sends out the disciples two by two he sends the seventy out and he tells them what to do and how to go preach the kingdom of god is at hand and they go out preaching and they return and when they return they say this and in verse 17 and the 70 returned again with joy saying lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name and he said unto them i beheld satan as lightning fall from heaven what did god say i'm seeing the fall of lucifer when what when his attributes begin to take their place when his attributes begin to take the commandment of the lord and move in commandment of the lord and express the power and authority that god has given them under the word of god when they begin to challenge the devil's kingdom when they begin to cast out devils when they begin to preach the word when they go from city city preaching it they come back and they testify to jesus this is what happened and he says i beheld he's looking at a prophecy amen he's looking at the end time when the lucifer is cast out of heaven forever he says i beheld satan as lightning as a shining light falling that false light is falling him and that false light is coming down what made him say that when his attributes when the sons of god begin to take their position by the word begin to take their authority and begin to stand on it jesus sent him out to be his ambassadors to be a voice in his dead and they began to do that and they began to exercise the authority they gave them to begin to preach the word for their hour and when they began to preach the word for their hour jesus said i beheld satan as lightning falling from heaven he was seeing the future friends as the bride comes into her position and doesn't let the devil push her around but stays in the promises of god doesn't get derailed by hardships and difficulties and the world doing what the world will do she stays true to this word she stays in her position she preaches what god's given her to preach in the seventh seal the prophet of god says paragraph 63 and the seventh seal now remember after the fourth chapter of revelations the church is gone the four horse riders has sent out church is gone everything has happened to the church happen up to the fourth chapter of the book of revelations everything that happened in the antichrist move went up to the fourth chapter and the fourth seal of the revelation both for the antichrist and the christ ended up an antichrist comes to his doom with his army and christ comes with his army it's an old battle that started way back beyond time satan and his angels was kicked out and then they come to the earth and the battle set in again because eve broke down the barrier from where she was isolated behind the word of god and from that very hour satan won the battle over god's word because one of his subjects the weaker let down the bar and that's exactly how he's won the battle every time has been because one of his subjects let down the bar from the word how did he win the battle in eden one of god's subjects the weaker vessel the woman let down the bar and from that time on satan won the battle over god's word so what's the fight the fight is between satan and the word of god the battle is between satan and the word he's trying to get victory over the word amen because that word is the thing that defeats him how does he get victory over the word when he can get one subject to let down on one word how many eve how many words that eve let down on brother said one word when one subject let down on one word then satan's got victory over the word of god how many of god's attributes does it take to let down the bar on the word for satan to still have victory over the word and remain an accuser of the brethren it just takes you remember to think now think brother branham taught us in christ is the mystery of god revealed he says god had one goal one purpose one thing he wanted to achieve in the whole bible and all of the characters and all the types of the whole bible has been telling this one goal that god's had and that's a threefold purpose and the first was to get preeminence on a man he did that in christ jesus second is to get preeminence in a people a bride he's doing that now third is to restore the kingdom to eden to an eaten condition so that means your entire bible everything your bible was supposed to express every type every shadow everything every character in the bible was trying to show has come down to this god having preeminence in you don't say the bride if you're part of the bride don't make it easy don't say for all the bride no the whole purpose of this was for him to have preeminence and the people and i'm one of those people everything god was doing was so that he could restore the woman amen to restore the fallen condition he had to restore the man he did that through christ jesus now is restoring the woman and he's got to have full preeminence till there's a people on this earth that are not letting down the bar on the word anymore they're not being deceived they're not they're not they're not they're not falling by deception they're not being beguiled anymore by the devil so he restored his word so that he can restore the woman and now god's whole plan has come down to me sticking with this word hallelujah god god in an eating condition he kept him in an eaten condition by his word so satan come in to get one subject to let down the word amen and then satan got victory over the word so now god's trying to bring back an even condition so he brought back the man and he brought back the woman and he restored the word because he has to restore the word to restore eden and she's going to be tested by the word but she's predestinated not to fall amen she's pre-dead this bride is predestinated not to fall that's how he's won the battle every time has been because one of his subjects let that debar from the word and the message the spirit of truth he says he's interested in you he's interested in me he's interested to see his word made manifest and he's depending on us to do it for we are his agents nothing in ourselves it's him yielding ourselves walking with him it's not us it's not what we do it's what we surrender ourselves to it's a dying to self it's a yielding to this word that he's given us and let the life of the word come and live in us and live his word through us brother branham he has this experience i want to close with sharing this story and then the scripture but brother rem has the experience of going beyond the curtain of time and do you remember how that experience starts off brother branham is laying in bed and he says i heard a voice say to me keep pressing that's how this whole experience we know he goes beyond the current of time he sees hope he sees the woman that was 80 years old that comes to him and says my precious brother he sees the men come running and the women come running they put him on the pedestal amen and because he was a leader on earth and he talks all about you will come to you first and you'll be judged we'll be judged with you he has all that experience he sees his horse and his dog there but how did that experience start he said there was a voice that said keep pressing keep pressing and he says from the message from that time and i heard something say keep pressing on and i said i will press on i said would you like to see past the curtain i said it would help me why did god show him beyond the curtain of time so that he would keep pressing on he did it to help him and just then i felt something happened to me and i thought what's the matter here and i look back i could see myself laying in the bed he's moving beyond the curtain of time and i don't want to i'm not going to read the whole story but i'm coming down to the end paragraph 105 he said i want to he says i want to see jesus i want to see the one that i've loved and worked for and they said you can't see him right now he's higher than this but someday he will come back and when he comes he will come to you first and you'll be questioned on the gospel that you preached and if you pass the test then we will go back then we will go with you back to him back to earth and live together forever in a body a fleshly body where we'll eat and drink listen those saints had gone they had done their time on earth they had gone through their earthly journey and now they've gone to the sixth dimension and were in their theophonic body and and you think they have arrived they have arrived they are in the destination they are in perfect peace perfect love perfect brother said there's no human words to explain what was there it was just perfect love they're there in that realm and he begins to talk to them and ask him do you he said no but when when when everything's over christ will come to you you'll be judged by the word you preach and then we'll go back and glorify bodies then we'll go back on the earth then we'll eat and drink and you realize these people in the sixth dimension are looking for something else they haven't arrived their journey isn't over they're not finished they want more they want because we're never right until we're a perfect tri-human being we're never right till we're a born-again perfect redeemed soul garth theophany body and a glorified body all united together until then our journey is not done and they're looking brother madam just got there he doesn't want to leave because i begin to feel funny and i look back and my body begins to move and he says do i have to go he didn't want to go but these people who are there they're looking forward to the future and say someday he'll come and get us and we'll go back to glorified bodies they want to go to the next step they're desiring to move on not that they're unhappy in this place but it's not the finished work yet we've got to go back to fullness of redemption it's not the fullness yet they're looking forward to coming back but they're encouraging brother branham keep pressing on go back they want him to go finish his work because if he finishes their his work they're closer to going back to those glorified bodies he said then we'll go back i said you mean he will question me on the word i preached he said yes and the voice spoke to me and said the voice speaking to me said it and i said well well saint paul be questioned too he said certainly with this congregation i said then if saint paul passes it i will too i preached just exactly the way he did not moved one word and those millions scream down we know that and we're resting assured and about that time i heard the voice say keep pressing on keep pressing on i felt myself slip i said i don't have to go back do i keep pressing on and i turned and looked at my body i seen it move i was coming to in just a moment i was in the room again brother branham was taken beyond the curtain of time to see those that had passed on before to encourage him to keep pressing on it was important that he pressed on it was important that he finished the work god gave him to do it was important that he delivered the message this was in 1960 he still had to come to the seals yet he still had to come to 64 and 65 and preach the son of man and preach the third poll and show us the opening of the seventh seal so that you and i could keep pressing on so that we could live our part so that we could fulfill the part for our day because they're all over there crying press on press on press on they don't want us fooling around with the world they don't want us playing games they don't want us distracted they want us to keep pressing on friends this message came to give us victory over deception to give us victory over the pollution of the word this message came to bring us back in line with our headship our husband the word so that we're no longer letting down the bar on the word so that the accuser the brother can be cast down because when the bride goes up he comes down it means when the bride goes up he's got nothing else to accuse them of he has not got a position anymore in heaven as the accuser of the brethren i'm determined to live all that god gave me to live i'm determined to give my whole life to this word because he's got to lose his position as accuser of the brother i don't want to let down on this word no more i say god help me i'm giving you my whole life god come and live this word through me i can't do it myself but i'm laying myself afresh on the altar to die all over again consume the sacrifice and live through me because the user of the brethren is going to lose his position as the bride goes up satan comes down brother branham is singing a song and a message and he begins to sing and he said and the bride goes up word by word oh are you being lifted up word by word revelation upon revelation word by word are you moving into the heavenly realm is the earthly things losing its grip on you and you're moving word by word as you're moving up he's beginning to slip he's losing his position this is why we're here now this is why your body was laying on the earth the ingredients the elements to make your body was here before eden fell was here before eden was established back when the holy ghost was brooding over the earth under judgment your elements of your body was laying here so that you could live your portion in this day and i want to say press on there's a reconciliation of heaven and earth there's an ultimate destruction of lucifer taking place because you press on amen let's turn to hebrews chapter 11. we know hebrews is the hall of fame of the bible the hero chapter of the bible of all the old testament heroes what brother branham says all right i'm going to read this and tell you what brother branham says let's go to verse 32 hebrews 11 32 and what shall i more say for the time would fail me to tell of gideon and a barack and a samson and object of david also and samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant and fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead race to life again others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection others had trial of cruel mockings and scourging moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sawn asunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about sheepskins and go skins being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens of the case it wasn't always easy friends it wasn't blessings and glory hallelujah every day they were overcoming by faith faith when faith when they were stoned faith when they were saw on a son faith when they were thrown in the lines and faith when they were wearing rags faith when they were living in caves amen they wandered in deserts and mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise god having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect oh friends they're rooting for you they're rooting for you all the saints that want to come back to this earth in a glorified body they're rooting for you keep pressing on brother branham said in the message the token paragraph 89 and the church in this day that's received the token of the baptism of the holy spirit that the blood has been shed and that the holy ghost is upon the church without us then they cannot raise but they're depending on us for god's promise he would have it and somebody is going to be there i don't know who it's going to be but somebody is going to receive it the only one thing i'm responsible is to preach it it's god's business to look out for the predestinated seed there's going to be there though because they're going to be there each one of them one with the other the water age the blood age and now the token age of the holy ghost and the pergament church age the section where brother brennan was told to pick up his pen and right and the angel of the lord began to use his hand to write out a message to us i just want to read a small portion of that it says those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise listen friends nobody can make you do otherwise you've been given free choice you've been given free moral agency and free choice and so now it's your right by god to exercise your free choice to keep the word amen nobody can make you do otherwise oh that does something for me free moral agency wasn't given to me so that i can choose my own way that i can make a choice like eve that i can satisfy the flesh and i can entertain myself and chase the world that's not why preeminence was given to me preeminence was given to me so nobody could take my right away to choose god and to choose his word and nobody can make me do otherwise they have thus saith the lord or they keep still they know that it has to be god in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his earthly ministry what was his work to seek and to save that which was lost to reconcile he did not complete all his work while in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time amen they're still part of the ministry of christ that's going on today and he left it for this specific time and he left it for a specific people and we are those people brother branham says in the first seal but in revelation 12 7-9 satan the spirit the devil which is up there now accuser of our brethren all right the church is taken up and satan is cast out when the church goes up satan comes down he's no longer the accuser of the brethren they have kept all the word they have believed the word they have surrendered to the word the last predestinated seed came in and believed the word and when all the seed of god has surrendered to the full revelation of the word of god she goes up he comes down i say god i'm surrendering all to you now i'm surrendering all of myself to you almighty god god bless you friends let's all stand brother isaiah if you want to come let's just bow our heads and pray oh god we thank you lord for the privilege you've given us to live in this day you've given us eyes to see and ears to hear we did none of this ourselves but you foresaw it before the foundation of the world and you chose us and you placed us oh god you said those that follow you are called chosen and faithful you called us you chose us but you said of the faithful that they were faithful by their own choosing and god i want to be faithful by my own choosing you've given me the right a free choice i have free moral agency by your law that no man can erase and i choose to take that free moral agency to choose your word over everything else over my emotions my happiness my my luxuries my my ease i give all of that up lord and i choose your word above everything else i choose it above my thoughts i choose it above my feelings i choose it above my family my friends i choose it above my church i choose it above everything else i choose your word lord i surrender to you god take me in your arms and use me for your glory o god we surrender everything to you god we die now so that we might live we died to ourselves that we might live in you that you christ might live in us while we love you finish your work through these vessels forgive us for our laziness forgive us for our lack of focus forgive us for playing games god we surrender all that to you now forgive us and wash it away from us give us a focus lord that we can be focused like a laser beam on the target and that target is the fullness of redemption help us lord as we surrender to you god bless this assembly and bless these saints that are here i pray you inspire some lord if they've not given a full surrender i pray they do so now lord for the whole work is depending on that

pull it back to yourself now and place them in position finish the work that you left for this specific time finish it through us we commend ourselves to you in jesus christ's name amen god bless you friends [Music] when i was a child even licking the plate wasn't wasn't acceptable but when you were when i was a child that was one way of showing it was delicious you didn't even want nothing to be washed away you want it to consume everything and that's basically the way i feel tonight even though you didn't see me licking the plate that's what i was doing in the back there truly the message has been beyond beyond it there is no way to express what god did for us tonight if if we received what was being said uh it was the kind of message that grabbed a hold of you and locked you in at least that's what it did for me and you know i don't to worry about changing because what i heard tonight would change me when you receive the word the word changes you so we thank god for that we're going to just sing all to uh uh uh uh i surrender all amen [Music] i will never love and trust him in his presence [Music] [Applause] all i surrender [Music] on blessing savior i surrendered all to
