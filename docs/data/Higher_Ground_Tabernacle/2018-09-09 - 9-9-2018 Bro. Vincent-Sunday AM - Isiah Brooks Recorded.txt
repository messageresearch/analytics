TRANSCRIPT
========================================
your word to break the bread of life and you come down to your power you come down you are 90 and come and speak to our house they come and transform lives and come and give hope to the hopeless in the name of Jesus Lord every power every unclean spirit that is here with such a spirit or I come against it by the authority in the name of Jesus hey Deborah we are cure you this morning flee lose you of the people of God and let them be free in Christ this morning this we ask in a matchless name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen let's open our Bibles to John chapter 16 wanna read from two places in Scripture this morning let's read John 16 and let's pick two verses from John 16 I hope my Bible doesn't stick together this morning this was the very scripture a prophet was reading and his pages stuck together hallelujah I hope mine doesn't happen that way this morning of course it will not happen because his ministry was a special ministry verse 21 and 22 I read aware of God a woman when she is in travail have sorrow because hour has come but as soon as she's delivered of the child she remembered no more the anguish for joy that a man is born into the world and you know deaf he now therefore have sorrow but I will I will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man ticket from you will await anyone who is sorrowful this morning hallelujah Jesus is saying that he's going to give you joy that no man can't hallelujah let's flip our Bibles back to Luke chapter 4 Luke chapter 4 and let's see whether we can tie these two scriptures together this morning Luke chapter 4 I read verse 16 to 21 the first time at the beginning of the miniature Jesus Christ let me put it that way I read a Word of God and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto Him the book of the Prophet Esaias and when he had opened the book he found a place where it was written the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord now watch and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that way in the Snuggle were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day this scripture fulfilled in your this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears hallelujah shall we pray Heavenly Father may you bless the reading of your word in Jesus name we pray amen let's be seated hallelujah amen I can send some down s in you this morning it meant some somebodies hallelujah I let the name of Jesus excited this morning it meant mini-moon Jesus I want to title my sermon this morning the manifesto of Malachi 4:5 and cysts the manifesto of malachi four five and six I know the word manifesto is not aware that is very commonly used here in America in fact I've never had it in public discuss but it's a very common word when you come to our part of the world when anytime they are a selection political parties come up with you have various manifestos in all hours a public declaration of what they want to do when they gain power hallelujah so the scripture that we read in Luke chapter 4 was the public declaration of our Lord Jesus Christ about his mission why he came hallelujah so look for from the 16 to 21 Jesus was quoting the scriptures as written by the prophet Isaiah so look for 16 to 21 Jesus was caught in Isaiah chapter 61 that's one and king but you realize that he didn't codes there's two completely he stopped in the middle of his two we'll come back to that but just to give you the background so this was the first public declaration of why he had come amen and when or if in this end time according to the promise of the scriptures somebody is going to come back in that Ministry of Christ then we ought to also understand what is the public declaration of his ministry why he at them so that is what I want to talk about this morning right breviary God is he said he's the greatest artist I mean when he writes his place they play off so beautiful his drama is always perfect yesterday when I was reading this scripture I was wondering that God used almost thousand five hundred years to manifest to the Jewish people first Moses when he came out of Egypt then along the line Elijah came then the chief the prophet the God prophet came in the person of Jesus Christ and I was asking myself what he took thousand five hundred years to do among the Jewish people within a period of less than 20 years he accomplished it among the Gentiles he put all these three gifts all these three ministries of major Jewish prophets into one ministry I mean that's it's so amazing I don't know whether you are you are you are with me in what I'm talking about talking about I'm saying that for the Jewish people first when he came out of Egypt they were led by prophet called Moses Joshua took over jgies came in some well came in then along the line another mighty prophet came Elijah then as they went along the Elijah ministry repeated again in John the Baptist followed by Christ himself amen God made flesh and dwelt among us amen then according to the scriptures according to Luke 1730 according to Malachi verse four five and six according to so many other scriptures in this end time God is going to send again another prophet God is going to send a game a prophet not to the Jewish people back to we resent us and now when this prophet came amen the Ministry of Moses the Minister of Elijah the Ministry of Christ something that he took thousand five hundred years to do was all embedded in that one man and that's that's amazing I mean it's so amazing amen so brethren the scripture we read in Luke as I said earlier talks about Christ as public proclamation of his ministry what he had come to do and if you read back from Isaiah well I didn't just display as a chapter 61 verse 2 for us if you read back from Isaiah you realize that if he had gone beyond the middle of verse 1 to verse 2 you have been talking about any time because his first coming is not about vengeance his first coming was about proclaiming the jubilee of the Lord uh I mean you'll have your Bibles I system if you don't have Bibles but those of you have your bike your Bibles as a sexy one person versus it to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord you see in Isaiah the verse to come ends by saying and the day of vengeance of our God to comfort all that mourn the day of vengeance but Jesus left out a part when he has read to proclaim the acceptable year of our Lord he closed the Bible or he closed the screw and gave it back to the priest are you following the reason he closes crew we all know is because his first coming was not about the day of vengeance the day of vengeance is after his second coming so he had not come the first time to accomplish that part the last part of assassins 2 1 verse 2 so brethren that is why you need the Holy Spirit to read a scripture and understand it because one verse of scripture is two thousand years apart can you believe that the first part has already be fulfilled two thousand years ago the last part of the same verse is to be fulfilled in this endtime just one verse of scripture two thousand years apart separated by a comma you see why every line must be open every precept must be upon precept line upon line we see why this must dovetail you see why no false doctrine must be entertaining to the church attending the church because just one word wrongly placed just destroyed the whole chain you know what I'm saying right so let's continue so after reading he said today you're yes this scripture has been fulfilled and I said earlier that the Bible promise it looks a meeting today that the Ministry of Christ now I'm not saying Jesus Christ I hope you can tell the difference Amen I'm saying the Ministry of Christ Jesus is a human being but in that body the human body dwell the fullness of God amen right so that ministry is supposed to be repeated again in this end time amen and in this end time if you read first us alone Ian's for from verse 16 the Bible says that the Lord himself shall descend in a shout in a voice say the Lord Himself is going to accomplish three things shout voice trumpet and we know that the shout we know how the schottische Brahmas interpreted or the shout is for the voice if you read a message rapture everything is there but the three things the shout the voice and the trumpet is going to be done by the Lord Himself that is why you can only meet with ambra hands ministry to only the Minister of Elijah a foreigner that is why you cannot limit him to only the Ministry of John the Baptist a foreigner because the Ministry of Christ was also in him now to prove this something happen remember William Rambo's preaching the this message January 1965 birth pains now when Rob Ramos missing birthdays he wanted to read John chapter 16 as we we read this morning verse 20 21 and 22 a woman in travail so way he opens to John all right I think he when he begins to really sees that no that's no way he's not reading the right scripture and Abraham concluded that there was a misprint because that is not the Bible that he normally uses it you remember it was in January and in December the wife had bought that new Bible for him as a Christmas present and he was trying to read from the new Bible so unknowing to brother Brahim two pages were stuck together he couldn't separate the two pages but he thought it was a misprint so he was struggling to find a scripture he called on other brothers to help him then watch something happened which some of you yourself you might have had before what happened was there was a Catholic priests bishops Stanley was sitting there then the Spirit of the Lord came upon the bishop and I mean I'm on Pentecostals and I'm on end time believers when we talk about a spirit or a lord coming up on a Catholic priest will be skeptical but come on who was cavas confess was a priest in Israel and the Spirit of the Lord came upon confess and he promised Sarah what they need for them to one man should die for the people about he prophesied about Jesus Christ's death so girls spirit can come upon anybody even God opened a mouth of an animal a donkey to speak to a human being amen that is why we preach in this check that girl's spirit coming up on somebody for the presence of speaking tones has nothing to do with the person having the baptism of the Holy Ghost the two are all related God's anointing generally anointing can come upon you today a you do something that God wants you to do and that's the end of it it has nothing to do with whether you are born again or you have the Holy Spirit or anything like that it has nothing to do with it so yeah so God's anointing those power came upon this Catholic priest he got up took his Bible and gave it to problem for Barbra Hamm to read those of you who have to take I mean now it's online you can download a table and plate on your I mean if you instead of watching all these filthy videos on your mobile phone you'll be better off clean some of these tips to come in to lift up your spirit hallelujah so you can go back home and play a bath pain is there you can hear Bishop Stanley's voice clear on the tip was recorded Brendan I tell you that tape recorder was manufactured because was developed or was invented because of this message so everything has been stored for us nobody can dispute it so every shower Stanley got up and came to the poopies he said to Barbara hum to take it easy but this is being done for a purpose and go to reveal to him why it is being done can you imagine a Catholic priest sitting and the under and for a pentacle star to preach to him and he getting up and saying this so the following day this thing was happy in Arizona phonics so the following day LeBron came and preached the same on this day this scripture is fulfilled which was an interpretation of what happened the previous day will be substantial that's a very short message you can play the tomb two teams and you will get an understanding of what I'm trying to say I you with me very we have irrefutable proof that God has been merciful has visited us again this year now if we reject it we are regretting it to our own destruction hallelujah I said if we reject it we are rejecting it to our own destruction God's truth has been pretty to us amen so I'm saying that if in the first coming if when Christ came the first time amen or in the first public display of the Christ's ministry amen a priest handed the scroll to him for him to declare what his public ministries why he had come then in this end time it does say Ministry of Christ is to be repeated and a priest gave that minister a Bible to read from there it behooves on us followers of the message to go back and pay attention to the message he preached on that day when this Bravo was handed over to him because in that message lies the secret of his coming church are you four are you following what I'm preaching because it's not enough to know the history of the message it's not enough if you cannot take the message simple plain message is good but if you cannot take the message and get these revelations and bring them out of the message the message is not going to benefit you because remember that the letter killeth is a spirit that gives life just knowing the letter of the message it's just like all these bishops that we have in a world where b2 geological school they all know the letter of the Bible they can't cut it I know this one bishop in my country producing a child called lighthouse edge he has a special gift he'd never reached from the Bible you hold your Bibles and when he mentions the scripture he will coated wetware you caught from youth say ting ting generation read it in a NIV read it in some other vision every portion of Scripture that's what he does and if you want to follow him you'll be confused that is a gift that God has given to him but he has but you see so your ability to read your ability to know geologically know the Bible from Genesis 1:1 to revelation 20:2 brother/sister it has nothing to do with you understanding of the way now if it was so poor would he have missed the coming of the Lord remember Apostle Paul but at the time he was called so he was highly educated highly highly educated as some of us are trying to do now still in school at this age trying to get degrees I wish we didn't have to do it my frame is day it's it's a vet veterinary doctor but he still still looking for more decreases come here to come and look for to come acquire more knowledge I'm also here where childhood classmates so it's I don't know for me I've always told myself that if it was not a requirement from my employers that I should go back to school and get a PhD I I would never have gone back to screw up satisfy what I know why because they require me that is why I came back to school I'm not saying this to discourage if you want to educate yourself but don't let that education take away God's Word from your heart I mean your education is very useless if it will take how it goes away from your heart so Paul was highly educated but when Jesus Christ came he missed it he was persecuting the disciples of Jesus Christ tossing them in prison supervising the execution mean you know the scheme just about that all the limit people in Israel from gamellia to cave fast all these highly landed that's why the Bible call some of the scribes the Pharisees and remember these people were not I don't worship s they were worshipping the god of Moses they were doing what God asked them to do and they were insisting on doing that yet they miss that coming of the Lord you see how easy this it's so easy for you to miss the coming of the Lord as many many many who call themselves bishops and apostles and prophets and whatnot in this world today are going to miss his car there every misses coming already when he came down in 1963 they miss it even though it was written all over the skies it was photographed and sent across the world but he missed it they missed him in the Houston Coliseum in 1950 when he allowed himself to be photographed they missed him they brought their hosts and photographers there to come and take pictures to make mockery of it you know the history when it is so easy only a few people amen before the preaching of marriage and divorce when he came down on the mountain in in Arizona missed him when there were a few people who said we knew Rhonda you a day when they saw that cloud that I'm Lamba Clarke going up and down the mountain some people knew that he was there when Christ was born some people knew the president no but an angel visited shepherds they were watching their flocks by night and told them that Christ the Savior is born three wise men from the east were told they saw the scientists eye that the king or the Jewish people had been born and they traveled two years were worshiping but the Leonard people who their holy people the people who are supposed to know the truth they were sitting in Jerusalem they knew nothing Semien the old man in the temple he knew Ana exeat s oh she knew some people new by the majority of the people knew nothing about it beloved when brother Brown was preaching the seals he says something and I'm not gonna talk in it say anything about that now maybe one day I'll see something about it no no maybe one day I'll go to a VA I'll return to Africa and come back here and come and see something about it because there has to be a time to say everything Quran says something is happening here in the room now but there is no way you can know anything about it what is he that happened at the opinion disease what was the event or the opening of the scene sills many miss it evening those who wear it was the closest friends of with Abraham mystique look damn man that two closest people who went around the world preaching bra bra wear got a nice day and Jack Moore kondal is this book that he wrote he said God said the prophecy that came on hi everybody 1983 said that I'm semi you and others like you to prepare the people for the coming of the Lord come on God never sent out a group of people core doesn't do that if he does that'll be confusing he always uses one man at a time and through that one man's ministry expressed to others I you with me so beloved it's very easy for me to miss God God I move on the same finish his way can leave the same you miss him that's happened people are going to miss the rats at the same way life will continue as usual how many people disappear every day from this world even America a law in Iowa here it's only it's only the disappearance of was it the lady that was killed recently mainly them only that's the only one that we had but the way others that disappear like her but those were not as publicized our hairs it depends on the resources that you have to publicize when you you know some alive one disappears so many people disappear every day so many people are kidnap everyday and we don't hear so if one in a million you disappear one do you think someone is going to bother nobody's going to bother so rarely it's very easy to miss the plan of God so that's what I'm saying that put on your thinking cap put on your cups of prophecy and listen to what I'm trying to say this I may not say everything exactly the way I should say it but if you have revelation what I say today will bring forth a desire in you to search to find out what is brother from Ghana talking about so Bradley what I'm trying to say is that when when Abraham came and that thing took place between he and Brad Stanley in Phoenix Arizona it was not just something ordinary that took place it happened for a peppers and I'm not the one saying that brahbrah himself told us that before he died that nothing happened for peppers that's why he preached a message this day is the scripture fulfilled and if we take that mess a try really look look at the paragraph 43 very carefully and I prayed I go reveal something to your heart email but is what I want to say this morning in this last days when Barbra Hamm preached he was preaching about bad things I'm struggling so how to put this in so that you get me he was fishing about birth pains and he was he read about a woman when she's in travail beloved what I want to say this morning is this that we were all born wrong in a man the only person who was born correct was Jesus Christ because he was not born by a woman in a womb a union between a man and a woman he was very important to us Adam was a spoken word seed of God Jesus Christ spoken word seed of God and because they were born right they could not see Jesus Christ was born right so he could not see I are you getting what I'm saying but because we were born wrong we were born of an evil nietzsche my brother my sister the first time you told lies nobody taught you how to tell lies that's how you were born nobody catches a young man or a young woman put him in a room and teaching or her how to fornicate it's him born it's the evil nature with which you were born nobody teaches you how to steal the reason why all this evil is associated with man is the best by which we came so brethren and the core of this message now when Abraham came to give us it's Beth this is what I'm trying to say at the core the heart of this message because the message he was preaching that day he died he preached the day that a priest gave this to this Bible to him is Beth now how do we change our nature from this evil Beth this hard which in this evil nature to a godly nature or how does our nature change from an evil nature to a godly nature and Jesus gave the answer that that change of nature can only come if you attain a new best only new best and do it nothing else can do it says how you fall we only knew best if without new bet you can't change you can't have a change nature you continue your old ways you continue you are dull chill adulterous life you continue your fornication life you continue in your stealing and lying and all these things that we all know are no good to the extent that now the world has accepted all this is right even that this is the this is the way God made me so you have to accept me that way no you are done we're because of your wrong Beth very anything that you are struggling with this day as why hearing my voice is because of your wrong Beth if you can't live right for Christ amen if you cannot live about sin know that it is because of your own death you must reveal in prayer to be given I mean to be born again let me put it away it's our own babe that is causing that all the fighting the fasting I mean all these wars in the world is our own death all the madmen we are electing as presidents across the world it's our own death look God gave Israel a prophet who was faithful and true to them after the death of Moses and Joshua also left the scene then they never had any prophet they were Roubaix judges priests then don't give them a prophet in the person or somewhere someone ever did anything wrong he told them exactly what was ghost peppers what was God's plan when they have to fight in a war they went to someone's summer told them what to do they when they came back with victory and the people were not satisfied with it they went back to somewhere where he was always say hey somewhere we now need a key someone said what you need a key see if they were thinking right they should have gone to someone and said oh some of you are now growing old who take away from you how let's pray to our God who give us another prophet like you but I said no all the nations around us have kids so let us also have a king but see man is constantly making the wrong choices and the reason we are constantly making the wrong choices because our wrong bethe a father who has walked a setting ruled before a mother who has walked a certain road before who never want a child to walk the route my daughter this is what I did and I got pregnant without marriage because when my parents were talking to you I never listened I always went out I went to the cinema I did this and this is what I did and I got into trouble so don't go out at this time the gentleman has not married you so don't be going to the house don't go and sleep over that dad the father doesn't want that because they are they have they have the experience they have worked that rule before but the children do it anyhow you know listen and the reason you don't listen my little ones is because of your wrong bed and that is what Bala Brahm was talking about when he preached birthdays amen so for that wrong birth to change to a new type of death amen you have to go through pain sisters brothers if we don't go through pain that Beth cannot come you have to go to pay there is no secession in Christ Oh hallelujah did you get me there is no c-section since a caesarean session you know when women are about to give birth these days when they are having a difficulty they just cut them and take out the child we call a caesarean session and I'm saying that in Christ there is no secession secession is done to limit your pain and in Christ there's no secession you have to bear their pain [Music] now they have only kept adora they inject it you are injected see all this is no wonder we have yesterday I was listening to a report they say autism in the last 8 years has increased 600 percent and I tell you this increases are here in the so-called advanced parts of the world in our part of the world where woman has to give him best and are very harsh conditions naturally very few people are born with autism and Down syndrome and all these chromosomal we traditions that we have that's a fact oh this see God has a reason why he was the chicken this does a vet here I don't know where I he knows anything about chicken hatching the girl has a reason why he wants the chicken to hatch the way it hatches when that she came in the egg after the mother has created the right environment it is fragment to come out it to be robbing his body using the big to pick the shell of the of the of the egg wanting to come out I when I was a child I used to raise a lot of chicken in Boca my father was a poultry farmer nicer is chicken all the eggs that I tried to hatch myself it failed because there was no girls provided way for the chicken to hatch of course today we have incubators that try to hug the chicken but how do we produce we produce some some very weak this poetry's that we keep very weak you have to put them on antibiotics and medication and that's why we are all consuming we are now dead people get some all homegrown chicken and eat and see how the taste is so good now this new thing that there's bone is so soft you crack the bone there is no taste in the boot the whole thing is tasteless I remember when I first went to Canada and my wife to quit my shop I saw the grocer who amazed all these vegetables all I mean now say wow that's a big shot is a good one and I saw tilapia you know in my country trap is very popular so I saw tilapia very big big big I say hey it wrap yeah we bought that thing took it home when I she did that thing I quit the team is tasteless it's not a tilapia I'm used to and I was tempted to blame her unfortunately she's not here as our center to blame her head that she didn't cook that thing well and I mean god bless my wife she said kitchen woman she's so good at the kitchen and I like her for that but I think was not tasting good so it was little and I found out that because it's red is it's something that they produce themselves it's not like something that was caught from any natural system so it had noticed Gregory you may not realize this beside those of you were born here all this is I eat they don't have tests I'm coming from a place where they we still grow natural stuff I buy your corn I roast it has noticed but if I back home from Ghana and I roasted fastest and I know we also get into a lot of things that we also eating in gallon is becoming this artificial chain of production finish chicken like beef beef is the meat of cattle which you eat here alone it's not very common in Iowa but the beef die in here if you sell nothing there are nobody bite it's absolutely tasteless it is no hard it's all tender I mean it's just bad why because of the artificial production systems we want to baby see cattle when God made cattle cattle is vegetarian they are supposed to move about and grace but we confine them and feed them Prahran was saying when he went to a zoo and saw an eagle in a cage once he said it was the most awful sight he ever saw I mean this was a creature that God made to soar above the sky above the skies about the clouds and he it was caged trying to fly out and just hit his head continuously against the cage it was pathetic they say it doesn't believe any animal should be caged leave them in the bush if people want to see them you should go into the water and watch them in their natural environment like we have the Serengeti and all these things in Africa I mean here you have a lot of why natural reserves where you can go and observe animals in their natural habitat have all these packs but everything that God has given us yet last week pastor was preaching he said look when you are testing real tests qua cool a Pepsi cannot quench status you can drink ten 20 bottles of Cola used to be tested onto that water comes in this is so brethren God has given us the real life but we have rejected that real life telling us last with our life you know so as I'm done speaking my message from that's that message real life God has given us but we have rejected our life for death man is constantly choosing death instead of life look at all of us now take two years ago it was hard for you to see a man 40 50 years ago with that kind of belly that I have yet because you virtually don't walk last week mass I was talking about when he was growing I went very few people had cars maybe one in 10 of everyone in 20 had a car so everybody was walking so you are exercising on kinshasa you don't even know and you wake up in the morning you are under air conditioning in the summer you go into an air-conditioned car you go into an air-conditioned office you come back and you come and sleep death death brain we are all walking death is walking alongside us but there is life somewhere let God open our eyes this morning for us to see their life and hold on to their life that's what we need so I'm saying that the message that were around preached the data Bishop Stanley gave him the Bible to read from was about Beth and not only Beth but the pain of Beth and I'm saying that in Christ there is no Syrian session there is no epidural in Christ it's natural birth and natural birth means you must go through pain how was a woman to be saved according to Genesis when God was kissing when God pronounced cases on the woman and they wasn't named anticipate when God cares a woman in the seventh what what were the one supposed to be six it Chobot it meant how is the bride's supposed to be saved Beth they have true page beloved I'm saying that if the first church that was born on Pentacles was born through pain how do you expect a bride to be born in this endtime this lousy cozy type of religion that we have today ha-have uses that as a question as a big I conclude have you gone through your birthday have you gone through your best pain because without it the life of Christ can never coming to you I don't know how many of you will return in the evening but I want to talk about the difference between salvation common salvation that's a continuation of this message different between common salvation and the end time Redemption because it's not the same what is required of us in this end time is completely different from the salvation that has been common throughout the ages well you guys have to confess Jesus Christ as your Lord confess believe in your heart and confess him and you are saved Polaski last week as I was telling you that if you don't go to the pyramid and receive the car stool you can't go in the rapture well if we want to be relaxed a candidate I'm saying that we must be born again and received a genuine party some of the Holy Ghost if not and that new birth Kanaka unless you go through pain and if you don't listen to brother harms tape carefully about birth name you cannot see what he's trying to talk about you cannot see it because when he was ready he was talking about one this is the secret I want to drop before we close that where he was really he was talking about travail of the woman brethren so you can only be born through travail in you must reveal to overcome your prayerlessness you must reveal to overcome your lasts you must reveal to overcome your fornication you must reveal to overcome your lying you must reveal to overcome your stealing you must reveal to overcome your unbelief where the pastor preaches any how about you choose to leave anyhow you like yeah because he's been preached myself I can friend of mine who I I saw he was a deacon of his church and I saw him smoking and drinking in the back and I said hey guy doing the wrong thing you can't be doing this thing as a church leader said leave Church my taste for my past I'll leave me to live my life so beloved the message the main thing that Jesus Christ came for was nubes that's the reason why Christ came when because the most went to him say massa we know you see the Francis where he put Greeks they knew the truth but the video wants to share their fame and glory with somebody I know need to get that person like that so they say we know that the things that you are doing Norman can do them nobody let's go destroy that person so in a conversation she says said unless a man is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Oh not to him off I said that to him off you see so Jesus he trotted scriptures was referring to this new bed the scripture that we read in John Jesus talking was talking about new birth there are other scriptures when he talks about a grain of wheat unless it goes down everything that reproduces look even bra bra bra bra gives so many examples you notice you know these examples better than I do he gives hope many example he gave the example of even a ring that before it grace what happens jagged rugged skies over thunder and lightning the ragged jagged skies Panda right lighting in Israel brought fought for us to enjoy is that all true the seed before it can bring forth shoot that's what happens droughts it grows completely in the ground whenever and they're great team is that look if a plant bring forth life does it go back to becoming the rotten scene it was before the light sprang though it just keeps growing growing growing growing silly bear fruits and if you have truly been born in Christ that's how it's supposed to be you see the reason why we're having all these problems that we've not gone to the best because if you have truly been born what happens you just grow grow grow till you bring forth fruit you can't go to becoming the rotten see we're from the beginning do you Anasazi Oh hallelujah everything that has the comfort with life has to go through some form of pain pain travail pain even your separation from your denomination or wherever you were before you decided to I mean come to this message it was it's it's done in pain people call you names before this own you because you decided that no you found the truth you want to abandon that foolishness for truth but I because if you I tell of God if a child of God it doesn't matter the condition in which you are but when you hear the word of God there is something inside you that knows that that is the Word of God and you desire to live by the Word of God unless you are not a child of God and you just brush it aside and just Alleluia I with me church birthdays best pains so finally you know I told you some time ago that somebody was preaching and said in conclusion he preached for 15 minutes I've said in conclusion once already they said finally preached for another 15 minutes they saying close same another 15 minutes so he started saying he was closing any pre for 45 minutes I'm not going to do that I want to be brief but I want to read something to you from this day descriptions fulfill yes who confirm what I have told you that these are not my words paragraph 43 you have the message on the computer so everybody can see okay all right sorry I didn't open this thing up right I'm really just the paragraph 43 for you can go please just a short message sorry I'm late said and just as plain as you could hear any voice a voice came to me and said he ain't dead into nazareth okay let me take it from 42 so that for this is where I can get it well well I go down and look at it again just professed as it could be but the system chapter ends portion of the the portion of it just about three inches from the bottom over at the 17 chapter on the other side that's the same thing and been a new Bible those two pages have definitely stuck together is what I was telling you earlier those two pages have perfectly stacked together and I was reading from the seventeenth chapter instead of the system I said that's all fine it for some costs so Brian was now he because the priests are already told him that this was happy for a reason he was saying that yes God did it that way for a reason and just as plain as you could hear any voice now when problem was thinking that God came down and spoke to him that's what he's referring to us as plain as well hearing me speak now a voice now hooked problem that this is why it happened are you getting it he entered into Nazareth to where he was brought up at and went into the synagogue as it was his custom and the priests gave him the scripture to read and he read Isaiah 61 and where he had read the scriptures he sat down one hundred a priest backed the Bible the book and sat down and all the eyes or the congregation was upon him and precious waist procedure from his mouth he said this day this scripture is fulfilled so this is Barbara hammers interpretation of what happened when he was preaching Beth means this the description so Phil is preach a day after he preached Bev pain so you were following each other now listen carefully how accurate is a scripture if you notice this in isaiah 61:1 - - it's where our Lord was reading from Isaiah 61 1 - 2 but in the middle of the second verse of the as asses the one he stopped why where he said the Spirit of the Lord is upon me to preach the acceptable year then he stopped why the other part to bring judgment didn't apply to his first coming is what I was telling you earlier just to emphasize at least I know my words the other part was not applicable to distress come by his second coming see he didn't apply there how the Scriptures never make a mistake they are always perfect Jesus stopped just where the scripture stopped cause this was exactly what was to be vindicated in his day now in that first coming his beloved let me say something when parabrahma is preaching he never wants to make reference to himself as some prophet or some I mean some divine gift that God has sent to the world he never made himself that way so why he wants to say things when he wants to drop a revelation he's very careful the way he says it because he was preaching among Pentacles he normally preached among the food gospel men so he didn't want to make himself anything okay but listen he's dropping something now he said in that first coming the second coming will bring judgment upon the earth but not them he was to preach the acceptable year amen notice the Messiah standing in the platform to identify himself with the word of the promise for that age so what happened in that first coming was what he was identifying himself with the way because he is crisis a promise he's a promise to the world that he will come he must find that promise in the previously written word something that was has already been written so he went back and took the screws from the Old Testament to read it that look here is where my where is where the prophets were talking about my ministry are you getting it now all allies brahbrah making us making reference to this because you see you should know that the Old Testament is a shadow of the New Testament and the Old Testament and a New Testament are a shadow of today so if Christ had to go back in the Old Testament to show the people his ministry day I live the rest of you amen notice the mossad standing in the platform to identify himself with a word of promise for that age how strange the mossad standing are before the church and look at this precious word when he says to preach the acceptable year amen so when you play when you play this tape Rob Rahab then goes on to say something which I live for the evening service Abraham goes on to talk about what he was reading and what was his last scripture for that message amen so in other words if one brother hold brother Jesus Christ what the Lord Jesus Christ read the day he went to Nazareth and went into the synagogue and was handed over the scroll to read if what he read spoke about his first coming smoker Behati was coming to do then what that Christ that was manifested among we the Gentiles I've already established you and you all know that Rob Rob came in three ministries he didn't come in only like the ministry that is why he pre this message this day discretize fulfill come play the tape he down demonstrated to the people he turned his back to their congregation and I started telling them what was in the heart there was one particular Ummah he mentioned the woman's name to a head that the child was possessed somewhere and she was praying for a child who back if you believe like like in the days of Jesus cry when you go back your child be well before he gets booked now why he did that he came to them said what you think is that so it is meant for the people to catch something the reason why he did I was able to catch something that hey this is not an ordinary ministry LeBron was a man a human being don't get me wrong I'm not Abraham is Jesus Christ don't get me wrong but I'm saying that God is using the man to demonstrate the ministry that Jesus Christ demonstrated on earth to us because we Jada's never had the benefit of a prophet in Hermes throughout the church ages apart from the early church apostles who approached on for audibles who were prophets we never and they were Jews they were no I mean they were not Gentiles anyway so Hebron was a first Gentile profit so in that Ministry of one gentle prophet he brought three ministries together are you so beloved Beth is all we need and the Beth can only come by traveling it can only come trooping brother we are all everything so many things awareness now no prayer so many things a lot of technology has been bombarded to us you can't have time to read anything whenever you are in your bed every one one of my co-workers in Ghana to me said he was complaining I mean telling me about some friend I mean you were saying in the presence of our friends he said I came to your house and I saw you sitting somewhere on your laptop and your husband is sitting in a corner his laptop I mean me I can't live like that oh how can you be married and you are my everybody's on laptop here is another kind of marriages we have everybody has something in the ear and watching something so we don't talk among our friends our children growing up now
