[27:57] thank God for the song service
[28:00] we thank God for our brother Jesse Smith
[28:04] being here
[28:07] I want to say old friend but he looks
[28:08] like a young man
[28:11] we appreciate him his family and all he
[28:14] had planned bring his wife but had a
[28:17] little problem with the car
[28:19] but so he had to come on his own
[28:22] my wife was an expectation but you know
[28:24] that's how it works by the grace of God
[28:27] I'm glad the Lord allowed him to come
[28:29] and safely come
[28:32] where he has a beautiful family I'm not
[28:34] going to go into that he can tell you
[28:35] whatever he needs to tell you some of us
[28:38] are new uh perhaps have never met him
[28:40] before even some that are maybe looking
[28:43] at the YouTube we trust that and believe
[28:46] that the word of God is going to be a
[28:47] real blessing to you if you not only
[28:49] hear it but receive it because hearing
[28:52] it is not good enough is receiving it
[28:55] because I believe that in the word of
[28:57] God there is life it is the only life
[28:59] there is I don't believe in being a
[29:02] Christian and being sad
[29:05] you're being defeated we get tired and
[29:08] sometimes we're tired we get a little
[29:10] sad amen but I still believe he's
[29:12] quickening power what do you say he's
[29:15] still God
[29:16] and I was just reading Ezekiel and I'm
[29:18] not going to preach because we got to
[29:19] preacher but you mean to tell me if the
[29:21] anointing of God can awaken bones
[29:24] [Laughter]
[29:27] hey he could cause a Revival to bones
[29:30] What About Us
[29:32] what about us who who claim to have the
[29:35] Breath of Life in US
[29:37] oh my God we don't need a crowd the
[29:40] Bible said where two or three are
[29:41] gathered in his name there he is in the
[29:43] midst and I thank God for he's he's here
[29:46] tonight you said how do you know that
[29:48] brother Brooks because he's in me he's
[29:52] in you amen and I brought my fire I'm
[29:55] telling you I brought it ain't warm
[29:57] either it's hot
[29:59] so I brought mine maybe you can get a
[30:01] little warmer or Harder by mine I I hope
[30:04] I can anoint you somehow but by the
[30:06] grace of God
[30:08] I am happy in Jesus amen and we
[30:12] appreciate the Lord's blood amen we're
[30:14] going to ask our brother Jesse to come
[30:16] before I get stirred up
[30:19] we love him we appreciate him and
[30:22] we also appreciate his wife for allowing
[30:25] to come my wife was just sharing with us
[30:27] today how difficult it is for Preachers
[30:30] Wives especially when they have to leave
[30:33] for a period of time I know it's not
[30:35] easy but I thank God for the sacrifice
[30:37] and and I trust that if she's looking
[30:39] that uh you know she understands that
[30:42] she is appreciated by Higher Ground
[30:44] Tabernacle for allowing her husband to
[30:47] come and share the word so we appreciate
[30:49] our brother Jesse as he would come amen
[30:52] should I cut this one off

[31:55] Genesis chapter 12 sorry I got a lot of
[31:57] verses I'm going to read tonight Lord
[31:59] willing Genesis chapter 12. I'd like to
[32:02] preach on
[32:03] walking in the steps of Abraham I've
[32:06] been doing a series on the book of
[32:07] Romans at home I think I'm on part 11 or
[32:10] 12 or something but anyways the Saints
[32:12] have really been blessed by this uh
[32:14] series I trust me a blessing to you
[32:16] tonight by God's grace
[32:19] Hallelujah there's nothing like the word
[32:20] of God
[32:21] you know the word of God is life that's
[32:24] what Jesus said he said my words are
[32:26] spirit and they are life
[32:29] now I don't have to ask you to raise
[32:31] your hands because I know everybody
[32:32] would like some more life here tonight
[32:34] by God's grace
[32:35] and I'm talking about in your minds
[32:37] praise God if you're born again you've
[32:39] already got eternal life in your soul
[32:42] Hallelujah but where we often need to
[32:44] get it renewed is in our minds praise
[32:47] God you come to the right place here
[32:48] tonight the Bible says present your
[32:51] bodies a Living Sacrifice unto God which
[32:54] is your reasonable service Hallelujah
[32:56] then you when you receive the word when
[32:58] you say Amen like the Bible commands us
[33:00] to say amen and you believe it then your
[33:03] mind is transformed
[33:05] I hope some of you can say honestly when
[33:07] we leave here my mind was transformed
[33:10] I was worried about that or I was
[33:12] thinking about that I was struggling
[33:13] with that but now I'm not thinking about
[33:15] that anymore now all I can think about
[33:17] is God's word
[33:19] Hallelujah and I hope you see your life
[33:21] in the life of Abraham here tonight
[33:23] because surely I have I see brother
[33:25] Brooks's life and I'm going to share a
[33:27] little bit about him at the end and just
[33:29] hope it'll be encouraging testimony to
[33:30] him by God's grace Genesis chapter 12
[33:33] verse 1.
[33:34] we'll read one through four and then
[33:36] we'll read Romans 4 12 no interpreter
[33:38] tonight right no interpreter okay
[33:42] oh bless you brothers that's wonderful
[33:45] boy you guys
[33:46] appreciate your labor love Brothers
[33:50] Hallelujah Genesis 12 verse 1 very
[33:52] familiar with this but let's go back to
[33:54] the beginning and see how all this
[33:55] started praise God
[33:58] in church remember all these promises
[34:00] you can say that's for me too
[34:04] wasn't just to Abraham
[34:06] it was to Keith Wiggles by God's grace
[34:09] it was the Isaac Seer it was to Isaiah
[34:12] Brooks it was to Rich Jorgensen it was
[34:15] to Jesse Smith praise God hallelujah and
[34:17] you put your name in there
[34:19] verse one now the Lord had said unto
[34:22] Abraham get thee out of thy country and
[34:24] from thy Kindred and from thy Father's
[34:26] House unto a land that I will shoot thee
[34:29] and I'll make of thee a great nation and
[34:33] I will bless thee and make thy name
[34:34] great and thou shalt be a blessing
[34:38] and I will bless them that bless thee
[34:40] and curse them that curseth thee
[34:42] and in thee shall all families of the
[34:44] earth be blessed
[34:46] so Abraham departed as the Lord had
[34:48] spoken unto him and lot went with him
[34:50] and Abra Abram was 75 years old when he
[34:54] departed out of Heron so let's go to
[34:56] Romans 4 12.
[34:58] so good to see you Brother Rich
[35:00] I love you brother

[35:56] uncircumcised aren't you glad you got
[35:59] that Faith that's right friends there's

[36:08] Peter said this is that Hallelujah let's
[36:11] have one more word of prayer if you
[36:12] can't do it let's just close your eyes

[38:14] God change his mind 1965 brother Ram
[38:17] said now in Abraham's Journey
[38:19] he met God all along in different forms
[38:24] how many experienced that
[38:27] you don't you don't experience God the
[38:29] same way every time
[38:30] sometimes it's through brother Keith
[38:32] sure sometimes it's through brother
[38:34] Brooks preaching the word of God
[38:35] sometimes it's why you're laying at the
[38:37] altar here
[38:38] sometimes it's through a dream sure but
[38:42] you experience God in all different
[38:44] forms
[38:45] amen and so forth which we could take it
[38:50] and show it just we are Abraham's seed
[38:53] if we're in Christ
[38:55] and then he says Isaac was his lesser
[38:58] son his son sexually but spiritually
[39:00] Christ was Abraham's seed as royalty
[39:03] amen amen
[39:07] now listen to the statement now we find
[39:09] that his Royal seed is
[39:12] travels the same Journey everybody say
[39:14] the same same thing the same Journey I'm
[39:17] gonna set timer here I like to time
[39:18] myself because I don't want to wear
[39:19] everybody out
[39:21] Abraham's royalty travels the same jury
[39:24] that's bride of Christ travels the same
[39:26] jury that Abraham
[39:28] amen the last sign that Abraham seen
[39:31] before the promised son came was when
[39:34] God was manifest in a human body and two
[39:37] angels came down amen yes we know amen
[39:41] oh that's what that's speaking of the
[39:43] ministry that God gave to William

[39:50] Bob said the other day on anointing
[39:51] anointed ones of the end times he said

[1:01:06] your name great to bless you all the
[1:01:08] time they're conditional yes sir
[1:01:11] they're unconditioned on God's mind amen
[1:01:15] for all God's promises are unconditional
[1:01:18] yeah but we've got to keep the
[1:01:20] conditions of it in this space and time
[1:01:22] of matter
[1:01:24] see that's a good thing brother said
[1:01:26] God's promise was unconditional it was
[1:01:28] because God was going to keep all of it
[1:01:30] yeah yes yes yes but Abraham still had
[1:01:33] to obey Amen to see it manifested in his
[1:01:36] life but God do you know man
[1:01:39] amen
[1:01:42] God knows you're not a quitter either
[1:01:46] amen I'm in this for the Long Haul amen
[1:01:49] hallelujah
[1:01:51] and then church after hand then he
[1:01:54] travels 400 more miles to Chico
[1:01:57] that's a thousand if you're coming
[1:01:59] 600 plus 400 yeah hopefully we get all
[1:02:02] of that math in our heads of 20 more
[1:02:05] miles to Bethel to set up
[1:02:07] the altar of God to worship
[1:02:10] and the whole time you're saying I'm so
[1:02:12] blessed
[1:02:16] amen amen
[1:02:20] all he could do was quote the promise
[1:02:22] that God showed him amen
[1:02:30] then George you know what happened after
[1:02:32] the worship another trial came
[1:02:36] drought came yeah
[1:02:38] so what happened now look I could have
[1:02:39] blessed him so what happened he's done a
[1:02:41] lot with him he had to go down to Egypt
[1:02:43] that was a 225 mile walk oh my
[1:02:47] and then when he gets down there brother
[1:02:49] Graham said he was a coward
[1:02:52] that's right Miranda said do you think
[1:02:53] anybody have a ham would have written
[1:02:55] this book on himself of his own
[1:02:56] cowardliness
[1:02:58] how he lied to the king that morning and
[1:03:01] said that his sister wasn't his wife
[1:03:03] with the right of his comedy deeds and
[1:03:05] he's done sure he'd have never done that
[1:03:07] no sure that proves this is God's book
[1:03:11] right because
[1:03:13] sins in it but this one writes all the
[1:03:17] sins of the Believers because they're
[1:03:19] not the ones being worshiped amen
[1:03:21] they're the ones
[1:03:25] amen amen we're all the same boat we're

[1:03:47] [Music]
[1:03:49] goes back and said my whole family's
[1:03:51] cursed all these women are cursed
[1:03:52] because of you and God never rebukes
[1:03:54] Abraham for it no
[1:03:57] now we know we must confess all our sins
[1:03:59] so at some point Abraham would have said
[1:04:01] sorry
[1:04:02] but God still favors Abram because he's
[1:04:06] the chosen one that's right
[1:04:08] so are you

[1:29:16] amen amen amen
[1:29:19] we just had that happen though our
[1:29:21] brother was battling with fear of death
[1:29:24] on a Saturday night
[1:29:25] he said it kept him up almost all night
[1:29:27] he was afraid and he's only 27 26. he
[1:29:30] said a demon Spirit of death was
[1:29:32] battling him all night and Simon comes
[1:29:34] in there on Sunday morning you know
[1:29:35] Simon
[1:29:36] he's like I'm just gonna do a little
[1:29:37] teaching today nothing special
[1:29:40] because he's so humble he said before I
[1:29:43] preached I just want to tell you
[1:29:45] he said I was battling the spirit of
[1:29:47] death all week I was afraid I was gonna
[1:29:50] die
[1:29:52] he said but then the scripture come to
[1:29:53] me that said Jesus said I am the
[1:29:56] resurrection
[1:29:58] and the brothers they started I'm
[1:30:00] sitting there crying and said I don't
[1:30:01] have to fear death amen
[1:30:06] [Applause]
[1:30:14] amen
[1:30:15] [Applause]
[1:30:17] I'm a firm believer in this amen I've
[1:30:21] always thought the nine spiritual gifts
[1:30:22] I had to operate in here that's not
[1:30:24] always the case I think in the last
[1:30:26] three years I've seen all the gifts
[1:30:28] except Tom's interpretation I've seen
[1:30:30] all their Seven Gifts operate just in
[1:30:31] our church just throughout the events of
[1:30:33] the life amen and tongues interpretation
[1:30:36] is the least yeah yeah now I'd ask God
[1:30:39] no Rich can I speak in tongues and he's
[1:30:40] never let me
[1:30:42] so what I'm going to do I can just keep
[1:30:43] asking
[1:30:45] but I'm not saved by tongues
[1:30:48] [Applause]
[1:30:59] but I've seen seven of them in the last
[1:31:02] two years now we the last time we had
[1:31:04] was in 2016. yeah
[1:31:06] so I can say in the last what's that
[1:31:08] seven years we've had all nine gifts of
[1:31:10] the Spirit Opera Hallelujah amen
[1:31:19] but brother said it'll be so humble
[1:31:22] [Music]
[1:31:23] and though he said yes amen
[1:31:28] [Music]
[1:31:32] [Applause]
[1:31:34] I've seen them all Hallelujah Miracles
[1:31:37] and he said the migrant it's a miracle
[1:31:38] when something instantly happened that's
[1:31:40] a miracle yes sir
[1:31:42] yes amen it's not Divine anywhere it
[1:31:45] takes you know a month or a day or
[1:31:47] something
[1:31:49] amen
[1:31:51] [Applause]
[1:31:53] chapter 16. now here Abraham I don't
[1:31:55] know if this is lust or what but he
[1:31:57] takes a bond made
[1:31:58] now we know it's part of the plan of God
[1:32:02] but look this in church he let his wife
[1:32:03] talk him into taking another wife yeah
[1:32:06] now there hadn't been some type of lust
[1:32:08] involved there I don't see what's up I'm
[1:32:10] having a desire for that you know
[1:32:13] so here we see again and brother this
[1:32:15] was a big mistake yes yeah but it had to
[1:32:17] fulfill a type amen I had to fulfill the
[1:32:21] seed of the seed of the law and then the
[1:32:23] seed of the promise right Galatians
[1:32:25] talks about that amen yes yes right
[1:32:27] there had to be the Old Testament yeah
[1:32:29] that was Ishmael that man works right
[1:32:31] amen that's a school Master to bring you
[1:32:34] to Christ to bring you to Isaac but see
[1:32:36] no problem is hallelujah amen but look
[1:32:38] God can even redeem your mistakes yes he
[1:32:41] can Hallelujah right you gotta have
[1:32:43] something to overcome don't you yeah
[1:32:51] that's right amen
[1:32:57] and then ishmael's born and Abram really
[1:33:00] falls in love with Ishmael doesn't he
[1:33:01] yes right amen we see in the next
[1:33:03] chapter yeah chapter 17.
[1:33:07] I love this chapter God said um walk
[1:33:11] before me perfect
[1:33:13] look he's already had one two three
[1:33:16] three big mistakes
[1:33:18] and God said that's okay I forgive him
[1:33:20] walk him from now on walk perfect yeah
[1:33:24] Hallelujah now God knew he couldn't walk
[1:33:27] perfect amen
[1:33:29] Amen brother said we sit every day but
[1:33:31] we got a blood sacrifice
[1:33:34] thank God she serve me better people are
[1:33:38] sincerely yeah that's right
[1:33:42] after all these mistakes he said walk
[1:33:44] before me perfect he just took another
[1:33:46] woman to lay with
[1:33:48] him and God said move move get past that
[1:33:51] yeah sure remember move on Turn the Page
[1:33:54] Smith Turn the page that's what I'm
[1:33:57] doing Lord I'm reading your body and
[1:33:58] turn the patient on it every day
[1:34:02] my year is never good at these things
[1:34:07] all right that's okay I'm still blessed
[1:34:09] Hallelujah
[1:34:12] and then God said walk before me perfect
[1:34:14] he gives an unclean he reconfirms an
[1:34:16] unconditional Covenant and he said now
[1:34:18] you must do circumcision to every male
[1:34:24] now let me read you this quote
[1:34:25] Revelation chapter 4 part 3 1961.
[1:34:28] brother says how beautiful it is here
[1:34:31] therefore be justified by faith all
[1:34:33] right the second place after being lost
[1:34:35] you're Sanctified and then filled with
[1:34:37] the Holy Ghost justification
[1:34:38] sanctification baptism Holy Ghost you
[1:34:40] see it how is this message justification
[1:34:42] by hearing sanctification is what you do
[1:34:45] yeah what you're saying I'll say say
[1:34:47] this is what I do ready say it again
[1:34:50] this is what I mean sanctification is
[1:34:52] what you do you try to bring your body
[1:34:54] into subjection of the word of God amen
[1:34:56] amen amen
[1:34:58] And in regards to what you did in
[1:35:00] appreciation of that
[1:35:03] in appreciation of you being Sanctified
[1:35:05] God gives you the Holy Ghost
[1:35:08] and he recognizes your face amen amen
[1:35:12] amen
[1:35:13] he said now my Baptist brother you say
[1:35:16] what Mark could Abraham do but believe
[1:35:17] God God of beauty and relaxes this Lord
[1:35:20] I said you're right that's all he could
[1:35:22] do he believed God but God to accept his
[1:35:24] belief giving him the Sea of
[1:35:26] circumcision and sealed him he said
[1:35:31] Ephesians 4 30 greed not the Holy Spirit
[1:35:34] whereby you are sealed
[1:35:36] now can everybody see why I got three
[1:35:39] colors here
[1:35:40] the first color is justification
[1:35:44] the second color is sanctification the
[1:35:47] last color is the baptism of the Holy
[1:35:49] Ghost and in time
[1:35:52] Abraham didn't have the full baptism
[1:35:54] because the blood of Jesus Christ is not
[1:35:56] yet been shed sorry man maybe it's the
[1:36:00] sweat or something
[1:36:02] Hallelujah
[1:36:04] look he's given circumcision now in the
[1:36:07] spiritual title he's got the baptism the
[1:36:09] Holy Ghost a brother Keith is he perfect
[1:36:11] yet
[1:36:12] because he ever make mistakes sure yeah
[1:36:15] yeah do you make mistakes after you get
[1:36:17] born again yep

[1:36:21] this I'm sorry
[1:36:22] somebody had me wear one a few weeks God
[1:36:24] couldn't do it
[1:36:27] I just shake my head so much
[1:36:31] Genesis 17 verse 17.
[1:36:34] let's read down there maybe can you read
[1:36:36] out loud when you get a brother because
[1:36:37] that'll give us all the time here
[1:36:41] oh do you that's a good idea pin it down
[1:36:44] with the glasses yeah
[1:36:47] whenever you're ready brother Keith uh
[1:36:49] you'd read that Abraham
[1:36:58] that
[1:36:59] should a child be born that is 100 years
[1:37:03] old
[1:37:04] said Michelle Sarah that is today
[1:37:07] beautiful chairs
[1:37:10] Hallelujah yep great job brother Keith a
[1:37:13] church can you turn it back to that
[1:37:15] visual now you guys are really good with
[1:37:16] that
[1:37:17] let's see what happened
[1:37:19] he gets the Covenant now he's sealed the
[1:37:21] Covenant and then God said now I'm going
[1:37:24] to give you a child through Sarah
[1:37:28] he's already got the Holy Ghost he got
[1:37:30] the seal now he was already righteous
[1:37:32] back here
[1:37:33] he's already he's already met
[1:37:35] Melchizedek brother Keith he's met
[1:37:37] Melchizedek he's in the Bill of fire
[1:37:39] brother Brooks but when God said you and
[1:37:42] Sarah are going to have a child he goes
[1:37:51] he laughs at God
[1:37:55] yet he already met God
[1:37:59] here's if let's be honest sometimes we
[1:38:01] we have a hard time believing our bodies
[1:38:03] are going to get changed in the moment
[1:38:04] of between Corrals yes
[1:38:10] there's this preacher just left the
[1:38:12] message in our area I said before you
[1:38:14] leave brother I said let me I'll talk on
[1:38:15] the phone I said brother
[1:38:16] I said what group do you know outside
[1:38:18] the message Amish or whatever that is
[1:38:22] more closer to the word of God than us
[1:38:24] he said nothing
[1:38:25] I said thank you that's what I wanted to
[1:38:27] hear
[1:38:29] because he's leaving and he even admits
[1:38:32] our word that we preach the word of God
[1:38:35] from the scripture that read we preach
[1:38:37] will produce a Rapture it is Rapture
[1:38:40] worthy
[1:38:41] [Applause]
[1:38:43] that's true amen two months ago I
[1:38:46] baptized 17 Amish people thank God for
[1:38:48] that but before that they were under
[1:38:50] man-made Creeds and dogmas they're under
[1:38:53] the spirit of fear
[1:38:55] their Pastor controls them like a I
[1:38:58] don't even know a snake
[1:39:01] he just squeezes them and outside the
[1:39:03] Bible they have a textbook that's uh
[1:39:05] inch and a half thick of papers rules
[1:39:07] have to follow and they don't even know
[1:39:08] if they're saved now look they look holy
[1:39:11] they look like they're holy but they're
[1:39:12] not holy on the inside
[1:39:15] and I said are the Amish ready for the
[1:39:17] Rapture no sir I said I knew you'd say
[1:39:19] that
[1:39:20] hallelujah
[1:39:22] hallelujah amen
[1:39:25] you want to try that one that's fine bro
[1:39:27] it's good it's good right now
[1:39:32] third time's a charm so if it falls off
[1:39:34] again thank you bud you did a good job
[1:39:36] bear
[1:39:37] but Church even somebody leaving the
[1:39:38] message brother Keith even he can see
[1:39:40] we've got the word to produce a Rapture
[1:39:43] now he texted me a few weeks there he
[1:39:45] said you want to leave the Rapture I'm
[1:39:46] like I left a nomination for the message
[1:39:49] oh he said you want to leave the message
[1:39:50] I'm like I left the domination why would
[1:39:52] I want to go back to the nomination I
[1:39:54] saw tons of interpretation Miracles I
[1:39:56] saw cancer healed in my mom's church but
[1:39:58] they didn't have the word
[1:40:00] you still sinned a lot they had a
[1:40:02] license for sin that's called
[1:40:05] but now it comes the message now I
[1:40:07] got both I got both right Doctrine and I
[1:40:09] got Supernatural miracles
[1:40:12] I got both I worship in spirit and in
[1:40:15] truth
[1:40:19] I told him I said brother you're being
[1:40:21] distracted
[1:40:23] Satan is trying to do this to people
[1:40:24] he's trying to get their eyes off the
[1:40:26] message and get them on just on brother
[1:40:27] Branham yeah sorry you gotta say holy
[1:40:31] ghost readjust my face
[1:40:36] we love about
[1:40:40] to the word of God
[1:40:42] amen amen I'm sure if you examined the
[1:40:46] last 17 I preached 19 years last 19
[1:40:48] years of my life you can find a lot of
[1:40:50] mistakes on my tapes
[1:40:52] you'd find a lot and you'd find a lot of
[1:40:53] me a lot of mistakes I made things I
[1:40:55] said I wish I would not have said Isaac
[1:40:58] but I said them and they're recorded out
[1:41:00] there
[1:41:07] praise God hallelujah
[1:41:12] amen when I see brother's mistakes it
[1:41:14] makes me appreciate him more as a man of
[1:41:16] God
[1:41:17] because I know my mistakes
[1:41:20] and I know these preachers that leave
[1:41:21] the message and they go find another
[1:41:23] preacher that preacher is way more
[1:41:24] sinful than brother Branham
[1:41:27] right because you don't preach right on
[1:41:28] marriage and divorce don't and
[1:41:30] Serpentine
[1:41:33] seed entitled he lets the women wear
[1:41:36] bikinis and he's got a lustful Spirit
[1:41:38] devil on him
[1:41:39] the man said any preacher that will let
[1:41:41] the women cut their hair and wear pants
[1:41:44] he said it's possessed with the devil he
[1:41:46] said that's thus saith the Lord that's
[1:41:48] quite a statement there
[1:41:50] now I hope they repent of that so they
[1:41:51] can get saved they can send me foolish
[1:41:53] version but they better repent of that
[1:41:55] oh yeah and we're going to go trust that
[1:41:57] preacher instead of brother Brown who
[1:41:58] lived a holy life
[1:42:00] yes
[1:42:02] [Applause]
[1:42:07] hold on brother I said brother Have you
[1:42:09] listened to brother brand when he gives
[1:42:10] the altar call brother Keith he will cry
[1:42:12] plead with the people he'll be with them
[1:42:14] for 10 15 20 30 minutes
[1:42:19] who wants to come to Christ they'll say
[1:42:21] now who wants to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:42:24] [Applause]
[1:42:26] when was the last time those preachers
[1:42:28] that left did a 30-minute altar call
[1:42:30] [Applause]
[1:42:32] crying pleading with Sinners to get
[1:42:34] right and then they can tell you what
[1:42:36] you did yesterday by Vision brother
[1:42:38] Keith they can tell you your doctor's
[1:42:40] appointment and all the sins 15 Secrets
[1:42:43] or more that you did last week who else
[1:42:45] can do that except the prophet of God
[1:42:49] hallelujah I guess you got a little
[1:42:52] righteous in the nation tonight
[1:42:54] but it's all love don't love
[1:42:57] look he laughs at God
[1:43:00] [Music]
[1:43:02] yet God just said walk before me Perfect
[1:43:04] Look he already broke the command
[1:43:07] right after God gives the command
[1:43:08] sometimes he breaks it right after he
[1:43:11] leave a servant when Brotherhood
[1:43:12] preaches we'll break something that he
[1:43:13] said
[1:43:15] that's okay we're still Abraham's seed
[1:43:18] hear the word
[1:43:19] amen keep walking with God don't give up
[1:43:23] on God he sure ain't gonna give up on
[1:43:25] you
[1:43:26] is that right yes sir coming down to
[1:43:29] their clothes here
[1:43:30] so now you can see
[1:43:34] he's already baptized with the Holy
[1:43:36] Ghost and he still laughs at some of the
[1:43:38] promises of God
[1:43:39] yeah
[1:43:41] yeah I'm 90. I'm 98 years old right
[1:43:46] he's look the Bible said the deadness of
[1:43:48] his loins
[1:43:49] he could look and say you can look at
[1:43:51] himself and say I'm dead nothing's gonna
[1:43:53] happen
[1:43:55] no wonder he laughs
[1:43:59] I can't believe God said that but God I
[1:44:01] love this God didn't give up on Abraham
[1:44:03] in other words God makes him believe his
[1:44:06] own promise
[1:44:08] even if you don't believe God's promise
[1:44:10] and you're a child a Seed of Abraham God
[1:44:12] will make you believe the promise
[1:44:16] in other words my brother and preach God
[1:44:18] always proves his word amen
[1:44:23] proves his word Hallelujah
[1:44:28] always
[1:44:31] like right even like going with brother
[1:44:33] Brooks to Guyana and Trinidad those
[1:44:35] times I've seen God do more casting out
[1:44:37] devils and miracles in those four trips
[1:44:39] than I've ever seen here in the United
[1:44:40] States
[1:44:42] and I saw the Bible brother Brooks was
[1:44:44] preaching and the and the sermons
[1:44:46] brother around preached I saw them come
[1:44:48] to life
[1:44:50] so nobody can tell me they don't work it
[1:44:52] works
[1:44:54] the Bible became a new Bible praise God
[1:44:59] amen glory
[1:45:03] I got a couple more things to get to
[1:45:04] maybe give me 15 more minutes here by
[1:45:06] God's grace
[1:45:08] because the last the last few parts I
[1:45:09] don't have to spend a lot of time on
[1:45:11] I love chapter 18. don't you Abram's
[1:45:14] waiting in the tent he's waiting under
[1:45:16] the oak tree one of these days God's
[1:45:17] going to visit me in another form there
[1:45:19] it is
[1:45:20] I'm gonna have another experience with
[1:45:22] God one of these days and as soon as he
[1:45:24] sees him he goes out to meet him oh
[1:45:28] go kill the fighting cat go get the
[1:45:30] bread go get the cakes God's here
[1:45:31] hallelujah
[1:45:35] we should entertain Jesus like he's here
[1:45:37] tonight
[1:45:39] if we really believe Jesus was here
[1:45:41] tonight how would we be acting
[1:45:45] [Applause]
[1:45:47] I'd preached to one two three four five
[1:45:49] six seven eight nine ten eleven children
[1:45:50] I preached the 14 like I would 1400
[1:45:53] praise God because I know Jesus Christ
[1:45:56] is here hallelujah he promised yes sir
[1:45:59] we're a seed he's blessed me nobody can
[1:46:02] curse me
[1:46:03] amen
[1:46:06] I'm a Child of God
[1:46:09] I am the scene of Abraham people are
[1:46:12] blessed because of me God in Me
[1:46:15] I'm nothing on my own but when I listen
[1:46:18] to that voice of God then God blesses
[1:46:20] other people through me
[1:46:23] like you
[1:46:24] [Music]
[1:46:26] brother random said this was I love this
[1:46:28] my this is powerful
[1:46:29] Abraham said this was God's last visit
[1:46:31] last sign to Abraham before Sodom was
[1:46:34] destroyed
[1:46:35] and then six times Church look it up six
[1:46:37] times six times brother Keith brother
[1:46:39] random said thus saith the Lord you are
[1:46:42] receiving your last sign Gentiles before
[1:46:45] the coming of Jesus Christ he said if a
[1:46:47] gift Rises greater than this he said
[1:46:49] call me a false prophet
[1:46:52] and nothing has even got close to
[1:46:55] brother random's gift
[1:46:57] night after night he could show them the
[1:47:00] dots and then he went to discernment
[1:47:01] praise God and then he went to the third
[1:47:03] pole he preached the Seven Seals he
[1:47:05] preached the seven churches he preached
[1:47:07] marriage and divorce and preached the
[1:47:09] seal say that's thou saith the Lord
[1:47:11] never a man talk like this sister Ruby
[1:47:16] I've heard a lot of Pentecostal
[1:47:18] preachers I watched a lot of preachers
[1:47:19] on YouTube but never a man spoke like
[1:47:22] brother man and praise God
[1:47:25] oh we know where we stand church
[1:47:31] said what was the difference between
[1:47:33] Balaam and Moses they both had
[1:47:35] Supernatural he said Moses was perfect
[1:47:37] in his teaching amen amen amen bail him
[1:47:41] had Miracles bail not Supernatural but
[1:47:45] who had the right teaching brother
[1:47:47] Branham did I love the church age book
[1:47:49] brother Keith brother Brown's looking at
[1:47:51] the batches and Holy Ghost he said now
[1:47:53] let me tell you the Revelation on the
[1:47:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost not according
[1:47:57] to what I think but according to thus
[1:47:59] saith the Lord amen and I can't remember
[1:48:02] the Keith I think there's ten Bible
[1:48:04] verses he used after that to show how
[1:48:06] you get the Holy Ghost after you believe
[1:48:09] just like Abraham
[1:48:12] got the seal he got the seal right right
[1:48:15] there way after he believed
[1:48:20] way after and his verse was Acts 19.
[1:48:24] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[1:48:27] you believed that's right he said that's
[1:48:29] thus saith the Lord
[1:48:33] we've got thus saith the Lord we cannot
[1:48:36] fail we've got the truth the truth will
[1:48:38] keep marching up the gates of hell are
[1:48:41] the rich cannot Prevail against this
[1:48:43] thus saith the Lord praise God
[1:48:46] the Gates of Hell will never Prevail
[1:48:49] against you
[1:48:51] [Applause]
[1:48:57] the Gates of Hell will never Prevail
[1:48:59] against this revelation
[1:49:04] when I ride mind battles like was
[1:49:05] brought around a prophet or not you know
[1:49:07] act a water bath
[1:49:09] let me open up my Bibles did they use
[1:49:12] fathers and holy ghosts or do they use
[1:49:14] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:49:16] thanks for the reminder Lord
[1:49:19] although I staggered uh you're always
[1:49:21] there to help me get back on the track
[1:49:23] we'll get to that one a little bit by
[1:49:25] God's grace
[1:49:26] foreign
[1:49:29] and then church this is when God
[1:49:31] confirms it and notice when God God came
[1:49:34] in Genesis 18 and said you're going to
[1:49:36] have a child by by Sarah and notice
[1:49:38] Abraham doesn't laugh anymore brother
[1:49:39] Keith brother Brooks there's going to
[1:49:42] come a time when we don't laugh about
[1:49:43] the rapture
[1:49:45] we're gonna know
[1:49:48] mother I'm Thomas he said when those
[1:49:51] Unite with the American politics to
[1:49:54] change the laws
[1:49:56] that's why I watched the laws yes
[1:49:58] yes that's why I watched a little bit of
[1:50:00] a Newsmax
[1:50:01] as soon as they change the laws The
[1:50:03] Squeeze is on that's about Antonio
[1:50:07] he said it's Revelation 13 verse 16.
[1:50:11] once that is announced that they're
[1:50:13] going to kill it's squeeze time
[1:50:17] and now we need somebody to rescue us
[1:50:19] from death but just like Esther praise
[1:50:21] God God will have a queen on the earth
[1:50:24] to expose God and God will deliver his
[1:50:29] pride
[1:50:31] What's it gonna take some prayer and
[1:50:33] fasting
[1:50:43] like she did in the squeeze that's right
[1:50:46] [Laughter]
[1:50:48] oh thank God Amen our lives are going to
[1:50:52] depend on it amen
[1:50:56] people say when's the Rapture when's the
[1:50:58] Rapture I said I don't know but I know
[1:50:59] this
[1:51:00] the U.S has to change the law so they
[1:51:02] can kill Christians
[1:51:03] then the squeeze comes on
[1:51:06] it's under the section where brother
[1:51:07] Adam said the
[1:51:13] brother man said in that section he said
[1:51:16] uh the bride will be forced to stop
[1:51:19] preaching
[1:51:21] according to Revelation 13 verse 16. so
[1:51:25] God he loves us so much brother Brooks
[1:51:28] he loves us so much he give us little
[1:51:29] clues in the scripture
[1:51:31] they have to shut down our churches then
[1:51:33] we know the squeeze is on
[1:51:36] just a birth pain
[1:51:38] that's a pretty awful pain
[1:51:40] I hated covert ever I mean there's a lot
[1:51:42] of blessings to come out of it but
[1:51:44] that was a birthday now right now we're
[1:51:46] in the relaxed time
[1:51:48] but if you've ever seen a baby born
[1:51:52] you know another pain is coming
[1:51:56] we don't know when but there's going to
[1:51:58] come another squeeze time see he
[1:52:01] squeezed out how many people would stop
[1:52:02] going to church out of fear
[1:52:04] but look you made it through
[1:52:06] Abraham see let me give you a clue
[1:52:08] Abraham's seed always makes it through
[1:52:11] nobody can stop Abraham's seed
[1:52:15] Goliath couldn't stop him no amen Haman
[1:52:18] can stop him the Philistines gonna stop
[1:52:20] him
[1:52:22] nobody can stop him why because God is
[1:52:24] with them the shot of the king is also
[1:52:27] in their calf Hallelujah
[1:52:31] now Abraham's done laughing Keith
[1:52:34] because he knows God's gonna do it but
[1:52:35] now Sarah is the one laughing
[1:52:38] and then she even lies to God I never
[1:52:40] said that you did say that yeah
[1:52:42] but I can't hurt you because you're a
[1:52:44] part of Abraham you're predestinated
[1:52:47] just like Abraham
[1:52:48] in other words Sarah you fall short just
[1:52:50] like Abraham
[1:52:52] hello
[1:52:54] sisters you make mistakes just like your
[1:52:56] hubbies
[1:52:57] hubbies you make mistakes just like your
[1:52:59] wifeys
[1:53:01] did God leave Sarah and say I'm done
[1:53:03] with you
[1:53:04] no
[1:53:06] God was God was faithful he said I'm
[1:53:08] still going to give you a body change
[1:53:09] Sarah
[1:53:10] I'm in a visit next year oh my God I'm
[1:53:13] gonna visit you according to the time of
[1:53:14] life and I'm going to make you a
[1:53:16] believer
[1:53:18] oh God is going to make us
[1:53:21] Hallelujah
[1:53:22] but he's going to make us believe in the
[1:53:25] current promise that needs to come to
[1:53:27] pass
[1:53:33] and then look Church
[1:53:35] he gets the
[1:53:36] he gets the Messiah sign
[1:53:38] Hallelujah Sarah laughs but then he
[1:53:41] starts a prayer dedicated prayer now
[1:53:43] look at that
[1:53:44] right before the body change he's got to
[1:53:46] pray for the foolish virgin
[1:53:48] I pray for all those men you've invited
[1:53:50] to be baptized keep praying for him
[1:53:53] I told you this last time but brother
[1:53:55] Austin he's 26.
[1:53:57] he was with our church in 2015 and 2016
[1:53:59] and he left to go out to Arizona to try
[1:54:02] to make it rich in Hollywood he almost
[1:54:03] had a contract as a singer
[1:54:05] he tried but he went deep into Satanism
[1:54:07] he went into tattoos uh marijuana
[1:54:12] uh you name it fentanyl all these things
[1:54:14] and he said as soon as he left the
[1:54:16] church he knew his life was going to be
[1:54:18] cursed until he came back
[1:54:21] and so he was gone for five years I
[1:54:23] think I told you this but it's
[1:54:24] encouraging because it lets us know
[1:54:26] who's Abraham's seed and who's not
[1:54:27] [Music]
[1:54:29] my daughters my six and eight-year-old
[1:54:32] daughters would put prayer requests
[1:54:34] everyone every service in for Austin and
[1:54:36] at the beginning I'm like yes Lord send
[1:54:37] him back but after a couple years I kind
[1:54:39] of got discouraged
[1:54:40] I kept praying but they but they're the
[1:54:43] ones who are really polling for it
[1:54:46] and my daughters kept praying
[1:54:48] they didn't stagger
[1:54:50] they kept putting prayer requests in for
[1:54:52] five years
[1:54:54] and then I got a text on my daughter's
[1:54:56] birthday Lydia's 17th birthday December
[1:54:59] 10th 2020. I'll never forget it
[1:55:02] brother I come back I brought my
[1:55:04] girlfriend we're up at Cleveland can you
[1:55:06] come pick us up we're back to follow the
[1:55:08] message of the hour
[1:55:10] after five years of drug addiction
[1:55:17] say to the utmost praise God don't give
[1:55:21] up on God he ever lives that's why he
[1:55:24] lives to make intercession for all
[1:55:26] prayers Hallelujah
[1:55:29] he tried to commit suiciding three times
[1:55:31] every time God spared him there was
[1:55:33] somebody there to catch him after he
[1:55:34] slid his wrist somebody was there to
[1:55:36] keep him from jumping off the bridge
[1:55:37] somebody was there every time Church
[1:55:39] even Elijah tried to commit wanted to
[1:55:41] commit suicide
[1:55:42] Saul tried to commit suicide
[1:55:45] suicides the spirit we're going to
[1:55:47] battle but we will overcome
[1:55:49] [Applause]
[1:55:51] Abraham's seed will possess the gates of
[1:55:54] that enemy praise God
[1:55:59] Abraham seed will possess the gate of
[1:56:03] suicide now walk off some conquered
[1:56:06] suicide I've conquered lust I've
[1:56:09] conquered Pride I've conquered
[1:56:11] unforgiveness in the name of Jesus amen
[1:56:15] glory
[1:56:17] hallelujah amen we possess the gates of
[1:56:20] our enemies
[1:56:21] nobody can tell me drugs are more
[1:56:24] powerful than Jesus Christ because I had
[1:56:26] a man sitting right there in
[1:56:27] congregation
[1:56:28] who overcome drugs the deepest level
[1:56:30] drugs he drink alcohol all day he'd do
[1:56:33] those pills all day God spared his life
[1:56:36] amen because of the prayers of a few
[1:56:39] prayer warriors
[1:56:41] I'm not talking about me
[1:56:43] talking about my little daughters
[1:56:49] so see church after you're born again
[1:56:50] look after you get the seal what happens
[1:56:52] you see the Messiah extended brother Ram
[1:56:54] what are you supposed to do now have a
[1:56:56] prayer life
[1:56:57] God help us
[1:56:59] he said walk before me perfect Abraham
[1:57:02] then silence destroyed
[1:57:04] and then remember this he lies again
[1:57:08] sometimes church we think we're done
[1:57:10] with lying we think we're done with
[1:57:12] greed or being selfish or lusting
[1:57:14] we think we're done with that but it'll
[1:57:16] come back the Bible said it'll come back
[1:57:17] another season yeah
[1:57:19] and if you haven't if you and I haven't
[1:57:21] fortified that
[1:57:24] we may fall short again
[1:57:25] but I want to ask you again did God give
[1:57:27] up on Abraham
[1:57:29] he can't because he's the Prototype of
[1:57:33] the church he's the type of the church
[1:57:35] praise God Amen he was called out of the
[1:57:38] world he was called out of idolatry
[1:57:41] nobody else was gone Abraham and you're
[1:57:44] his seed praise God Amen chosen people
[1:57:47] yes sir to receive Jesus Christ
[1:57:53] and he even had to travel 40 miles back
[1:57:56] the devil said you did it again you did
[1:57:59] it again you lied again you lied again
[1:58:02] you lied again he said that's okay I'm
[1:58:03] blessed amen I know a God who forgives
[1:58:06] me praise God nobody you can't curse me
[1:58:08] Satan
[1:58:09] I'm still I still got God thus saith the
[1:58:11] Lord hallelujah I'm walking in Victory
[1:58:14] praise God
[1:58:17] 40 40 miles of that devil brother Isaac
[1:58:20] but he overcame amen every mile
[1:58:26] Oh Glory
[1:58:28] yeah man you know you and I only travel
[1:58:30] what 13 five miles or whatever to church
[1:58:32] we'll be bowing Satan all the way
[1:58:34] um
[1:58:35] devil
[1:58:36] all he's got to do is say I'm Abraham's
[1:58:38] seed amen amen if Abraham's righteous so
[1:58:41] am I
[1:58:42] amen because I I believe too just like
[1:58:45] Abraham
[1:58:46] I'm not perfect just like Abraham but I
[1:58:49] believe
[1:58:53] Hallelujah in the sign Hallelujah the
[1:58:55] son of man's side I believe it praise
[1:58:58] God
[1:58:59] I believe God's going to give me a body
[1:59:01] change someday
[1:59:03] in the hour of visitation he'll visit us
[1:59:06] brother Keith he'll give us a body
[1:59:08] change and the promised son will be
[1:59:10] produced praise God
[1:59:15] then Isaac is Born the Rapture now
[1:59:17] notice not all types are perfect because
[1:59:19] look Simon is destroyed before the
[1:59:21] Rapture but in reality it's vice versa
[1:59:24] the Rapture happens first and then the
[1:59:27] tribulation
[1:59:28] see so you can't take every type you got
[1:59:31] to be very careful with your types
[1:59:36] now look at the rest of his life church
[1:59:38] the rest of his life increase yeah there
[1:59:40] you go
[1:59:42] the rest of his life it's like he
[1:59:44] finally achieves brother Brooks this
[1:59:45] mature walk with God
[1:59:53] apters of his life may God help us
[1:59:56] to live closer to him so we have less
[1:59:59] and less for Satan to whisper in our ear
[2:00:03] because God has asked us to walk before
[2:00:06] me
[2:00:07] you've got to seal
[2:00:10] you've been around this this is not your
[2:00:12] first rodeo they say
[2:00:15] you you battled this before you battled
[2:00:18] a lie for you battled us before
[2:00:20] you battled selfishness before you can
[2:00:23] overcome this time

[2:00:41] this and greater this call me a false
[2:00:42] prophet I'm calling him a true Prophet
[2:00:44] tonight nothing has risen even close to
[2:00:48] brother Branham
[2:00:54] ma there's so much I could say but I
[2:00:56] better
[2:00:58] you remember this

[2:01:19] fall asleep at night time because I'm so
[2:01:20] tired chasing around those eight kids
[2:01:22] all dated
[2:01:25] brother random reads this and the sermon
[2:01:27] works

[2:01:33] before we uh read this though remember

[2:01:39] listen to works as Faith expressed
[2:01:43] works as Faith Express that is brother
[2:01:45] branham's Pinnacle on Divine Healing
[2:01:48] he says if God ever gives you a
[2:01:50] revelation it was a gift for your
[2:01:52] healing
[2:01:53] in other words you can't work your way
[2:01:54] into something
[2:01:57] it is a beautiful message it's the
[2:01:58] Pinnacle
[2:02:00] he says they could pour 50 gallons of
[2:02:02] oil on you he said that would be good he
[2:02:05] said that might encourage you but you're
[2:02:06] not going to get healed until God gives
[2:02:08] you the Revelation and he said it's a
[2:02:10] gift of faith
[2:02:13] so it takes all the pressure off you
[2:02:15] will you don't believe you don't believe
[2:02:16] of course you believe you're Abraham's
[2:02:18] seed
[2:02:19] all things are possible without that
[2:02:21] belief We Believe
[2:02:23] D waiting for the Revelation is it God's
[2:02:25] will or not amen
[2:02:27] it's the most beautiful
[2:02:29] teaching on Divine Healing I've ever

[2:02:59] went to
[2:03:02] you know what I've been going too late

[2:03:14] against me I have peace with God
[2:03:17] amen God's not against me God's for me
[2:03:19] I've got thus saith the Lord
[2:03:23] I mean they're going to choose to

[2:05:06] staggered not at the promise of God
[2:05:08] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[2:05:11] giving God the glory and the church said
[2:05:14] amen

[2:06:54] brother
[2:06:56] and brother Graham said even if you
[2:06:57] can't amen he said live the word of God
[2:06:59] I'd rather have you live me a sermon
[2:07:02] then preach me one
[2:07:06] last verses we're closing with this
[2:07:11] Colossians 1 22. bring that up if we
[2:07:13] would there brother
[2:07:20] this is one of the most beautiful
[2:07:21] scriptures Church
[2:07:23] I bring this up to Satan when he battles
[2:07:25] me too about my sins
[2:07:28] now either you believe this or you don't
[2:07:30] but I know you do that's why you're here
[2:07:31] because you're Abraham's seed
[2:07:33] in the body of his flesh through death
[2:07:35] to present you what
[2:07:38] so his death made you what that means
[2:07:42] sacred pure morally blameless
[2:07:46] a most sacred thing
[2:07:50] and that's not it
[2:07:53] The Blood also made you unblameable
[2:07:56] which means unblemished
[2:07:59] faultless
[2:08:03] he's writing to a church he never even
[2:08:06] met
[2:08:07] EPA first started this church
[2:08:10] not Paul
[2:08:12] but Paul will give him the same promises
[2:08:14] that he give to the Ephesians praise God
[2:08:17] Hallelujah
[2:08:18] that Jesus Christ washes the bride and
[2:08:22] she has no spot or no promise praise God
[2:08:25] whether you live in Ephesus or colossae
[2:08:27] or Corinth or Des Moines or Akron
[2:08:31] wherever you live the blood of Jesus
[2:08:33] Christ makes you unrepromable
[2:08:36] amen it makes you righteous without your
[2:08:40] works
[2:08:42] it'll make a it'll make a young girl
[2:08:44] jump like this church I've seen it
[2:08:47] he preached it I saw it I was standing
[2:08:49] right behind it praise God
[2:08:52] that's what the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:08:53] will do
[2:08:55] it'll make people jump out of their
[2:08:57] seats
[2:09:01] and you're also unreprovable which means
[2:09:05] unaccused
[2:09:10] amen you mean that one who's always
[2:09:11] accusing you he really has no grounds to
[2:09:14] do it
[2:09:15] he might accuse you to you but he cannot
[2:09:18] accuse you to God
[2:09:22] is that right I don't know isn't that
[2:09:25] what the Bible says
[2:09:27] he's presenting you holy unblameable
[2:09:31] and unreproved just like Abraham
[2:09:34] all those mistakes brother
[2:09:37] God forgave it all
[2:09:40] he said enter into the joys of the Lord
[2:09:43] prepare for you Abraham from the
[2:09:46] foundation of the world
[2:09:48] oh thank God
[2:09:52] last scripture go to Romans 8.
[2:09:56] verse 1.
[2:09:59] Satan says he follows you around see you
[2:10:02] lied again you lost it again you stole
[2:10:05] again you're condemned and you can say
[2:10:07] devil I'm blessed and there verse 1
[2:10:10] there is now no condemnation to them
[2:10:13] that are in Christ Jesus
[2:10:15] as long as you confess
[2:10:17] for condemnation
[2:10:20] [Music]
[2:10:23] go to verse 20
[2:10:25] . Satan will say look Abraham you made
[2:10:27] all these bad steps you made all these
[2:10:29] bad steps and sure he did but
[2:10:32] devil we know all things work together
[2:10:34] for good to them that love God to them
[2:10:37] who are called according to the promise
[2:10:40] oh all my mistakes God used to form me
[2:10:44] into a better Christian
[2:10:51] in other words Abraham could say I
[2:10:53] wouldn't go back and change anything
[2:10:54] because God forgave everything
[2:10:57] and in each fiery trial God made my
[2:11:00] faith even stronger
[2:11:03] I was Stronger giving God praise
[2:11:06] [Music]
[2:11:09] I'll say like this when God looks at
[2:11:11] your life Keith God looks and says Keith
[2:11:13] never staggered one time
[2:11:15] because that's what God said about
[2:11:17] Abraham
[2:11:19] was like you failed there in chapter 12
[2:11:21] chapter 14 chapter 17 and God's like he
[2:11:24] never failed one time
[2:11:30] amen the very he laughed at God and God
[2:11:34] said he never staggered at the promise
[2:11:36] of God
[2:11:36] in fact in fact God gave him uh instead
[2:11:41] of the Unholy laugh Abraham had God gave
[2:11:43] him a laugh of Joy because that's
[2:11:46] Isaac's name it means laughter praise
[2:11:48] God
[2:11:49] so God replaces unbelief laughter with
[2:11:52] laughter of Joy Hallelujah
[2:12:00] [Applause]
[2:12:02] he's going to make us laugh for Joy
[2:12:04] brother Keith
[2:12:07] I can't believe I did
[2:12:13] overcame my unbelief and he caused me to
[2:12:17] believe his promise
[2:12:25] Satan will say God is against you
[2:12:28] God's fighting against you and you can
[2:12:29] just say devil
[2:12:31] get behind me because verse 31 says if
[2:12:34] God before us who can be against us
[2:12:38] who can be against you
[2:12:42] God is for you amen just like he was for
[2:12:46] Abraham amen you can't stop him that's
[2:12:50] why brother said the bride's Invincible
[2:12:51] army look she's been Invincible for 2
[2:12:54] 000 years
[2:12:56] Satan's never been able to stop her the
[2:12:58] broad keeps marching on praise God all
[2:13:01] we're Christian Soldiers marching us to
[2:13:03] war with the cross of Jesus going on
[2:13:06] before
[2:13:08] she's still marching praise God
[2:13:12] oh thank God I love Abraham's story
[2:13:16] because it gives me hope
[2:13:20] because tribulation work as what
[2:13:22] patience
[2:13:23] and patience Works what experience which
[2:13:26] is character and what you got in
[2:13:28] character brother Keith let's give you
[2:13:29] gives you hope
[2:13:30] that means expectation to be saved
[2:13:34] glory amen my trials just give me more
[2:13:37] hope in Jesus brother Brooks
[2:13:40] I got to go through them if I want to
[2:13:42] have a hopeful future
[2:13:51] the devil say
[2:13:53] oh God doesn't love you God doesn't love
[2:13:55] you and say shut up devil I'm going to
[2:13:57] knock you out with Romans 8 35 who shall
[2:13:59] separate me from the love of Christ
[2:14:02] and devil you're included in there
[2:14:04] because it says Angels or principalities
[2:14:07] nothing not even Satan can separate me
[2:14:10] from the love of Jesus Christ
[2:14:13] Hallelujah
[2:14:18] I'm on repeat reprovable I'm
[2:14:20] unbelievable I'm holy and insight
[2:14:23] because of his blood praise God somebody
[2:14:26] [Applause]
[2:14:28] ought to walk out of here transformed
[2:14:33] Satan says you won't conquer this you
[2:14:35] won't conquer this battle with your
[2:14:37] family your children the devil is going
[2:14:39] to conquer I'm going to conquer your
[2:14:40] children you can say Satan you're lying
[2:14:42] Romans 7 39 says nay in all these things
[2:14:45] we are more than conquerors
[2:14:50] that's the end of our feet
[2:14:59] how many want to be strong in faith
[2:15:03] giving God glory amen
[2:15:05] you know church if I put my life up
[2:15:07] there in chapters I'd imagine I've had a
[2:15:08] lot more red dots than Abraham
[2:15:10] and no doubt Abraham you'll sinned every
[2:15:11] day just like every other person
[2:15:13] but I just want to remind you that at
[2:15:16] the end of it brother Adam said
[2:15:17] when God wrote Abraham's Divine
[2:15:19] commentary
[2:15:21] he said there was no mistakes in it and
[2:15:24] he quoted Romans 4 Abraham staggered not
[2:15:28] at the promise of God program said I
[2:15:31] hope my commentary is written like that
[2:15:33] I just read you your commentary
[2:15:38] since 122 Romans 8
[2:15:45] nothing can separate you from the love
[2:15:47] of God so let's be strong in faith let's
[2:15:49] give God glory tonight amen
[2:15:56] one more scripture before we sing I
[2:15:58] can't get away from this word brother
[2:16:01] First John 3 9 put it up there
[2:16:04] in the name of the Lord I'm going to say
[2:16:05] this because it's the word
[2:16:08] said they'll say the Bible
[2:16:11] put up First John 3 9.
[2:16:16] this is why the Bible can say we never
[2:16:18] stagger at the promise of God
[2:16:22] whosoever is born of God does not
[2:16:25] not commit sin amen
[2:16:29] amen
[2:16:30] for why because his Abraham seed
[2:16:34] remains in him
[2:16:37] glory amen he cannot sin amen because
[2:16:42] he's born of God Amen
[2:16:47] that's thus say at the Bible
[2:16:50] friends and if you know the Bible that
[2:16:52] was talking about your soul not your
[2:16:54] mind not your flesh your soul never
[2:16:58] sinned it can never sin because as a
[2:17:01] gene seed of God in there
[2:17:03] [Music]
[2:17:05] part of God Brother Rich
[2:17:07] God's spirit that's in your soul
[2:17:11] heart of God and that's why God can look
[2:17:14] at Rich and say Rich serve me all those
[2:17:16] years he never staggered at the promise
[2:17:19] of God
[2:17:23] a rich was strong in faith he gave me
[2:17:26] Glory sir I saw you clapping earlier
[2:17:29] he was strong in faith giving God glory
[2:17:33] to church
[2:17:35] ends he praised God he was strong in
[2:17:38] faith giving God glory
[2:17:41] and let me say this about your pastor
[2:17:47] What attracted me this message was the
[2:17:49] word but also brother Brooks I never met
[2:17:51] a preacher who was so honest or friendly
[2:17:54] never
[2:17:56] so easy to talk to
[2:17:58] him so humble I I've never met I never
[2:18:02] met a man like brother Brooks amen
[2:18:04] forgiving
[2:18:06] I've never been a man so forgiven like
[2:18:07] brother Brooks
[2:18:09] so I'm gonna tell you that cam all those
[2:18:10] guys Dave Llewellyn Craig that I'll tell
[2:18:12] you that
[2:18:17] a man who was so free to worship God I
[2:18:20] never met a man like brother
[2:18:22] amen we all know well we all hope
[2:18:25] someplace in heaven brother Brooks
[2:18:26] because this guy has his own worship
[2:18:27] corner
[2:18:28] at least that's the part I want to be a
[2:18:30] part of
[2:18:31] that tambourine
[2:18:33] bye yes
[2:18:36] glory amen
[2:18:40] it was the life of brother Brooks The
[2:18:43] Life of Christ in brother Brooks
[2:18:46] but don't forget
[2:18:48] brother Brooks had to travel
[2:18:50] 572 miles from Columbia South Carolina
[2:18:54] to Lima Ohio
[2:18:55] because God called him to separate
[2:18:57] himself from his family
[2:18:59] and all 572 Miles sister Ruby you and
[2:19:03] brother Brooks were strong in faith in
[2:19:05] that Explorer maybe
[2:19:06] maybe it was a car before that
[2:19:10] with all those eight kids in there they
[2:19:12] just gave God the glory all the way up
[2:19:13] there
[2:19:14] every Mile right some miles were hard
[2:19:16] others especially when the kids get sick
[2:19:18] in the car
[2:19:20] but they left their friends and family
[2:19:25] because God needed brother Brooks to
[2:19:27] start a Revival
[2:19:28] in Lima
[2:19:30] and now two extra churches have been
[2:19:32] birthed out of that
[2:19:33] Hallelujah
[2:19:35] that's what the body of Christ does it
[2:19:36] multiplies
[2:19:39] but God wasn't done with brother Brooks
[2:19:40] yet
[2:19:41] he had some more miles to travel
[2:19:45] God had to travel had brother Brooks and
[2:19:48] Ruby travels 131 miles from Lima Ohio
[2:19:52] to Des Moines Iowa
[2:19:54] to start really almost two more two more
[2:19:57] churches
[2:19:58] right I don't know if they'll come
[2:19:59] together but he's helped lead two
[2:20:01] churches
[2:20:02] sound familiar
[2:20:05] and brother Brooks has been here what
[2:20:06] year after year struggle after struggle
[2:20:08] what does he insist Ruby still doing
[2:20:10] they're still strong in faith giving God
[2:20:12] the glory
[2:20:12] [Music]
[2:20:19] amen at my promise
[2:20:21] because the seed of God was within you
[2:20:24] and the seed of God cannot sin amen can

[2:26:18] [Music]
[2:26:25] the only thing I
[2:26:28] regret tonight
[2:26:31] is that the church was not full
[2:26:34] oh my God it was just everything I Jesse
[2:26:38] don't even know
[2:26:40] what the Lord did
[2:26:43] in the time that I spent
[2:26:46] in my private place with God I mean he
[2:26:49] preached a whole
[2:26:52] I can't explain it
[2:26:55] but I I feel like I had a tonight a
[2:26:57] second visitation from the Lord
[2:27:02] one thing I do know is that I came back
[2:27:04] changed
[2:27:06] and I just appreciate all of you who
[2:27:10] helped me and supported me uh and and
[2:27:13] it's still going
[2:27:14] [Music]
[2:27:18] days tonight come on something's wrong
[2:27:22] with the hearing
[2:27:25] this should have set every soul in here
[2:27:27] free tonight Every Soul I mean every
[2:27:31] soul
[2:27:32] it's just amazes me on how God knows how
[2:27:37] to work it
[2:27:38] like I said I love his character I know
[2:27:41] how he works and just to see God come in
[2:27:45] Listen People
[2:27:47] to me I can't explain it but this is one
[2:27:50] of those messages that I'm gonna replay
[2:27:53] and replay and replay I so thoroughly
[2:27:57] enjoyed it I'm going to make sure my son
[2:28:00] and everybody that I know uh uh that
[2:28:03] listens in or at times I'm gonna say go
[2:28:06] listen
[2:28:07] this is what you need to hear
[2:28:10] what what God spoke tonight is what all
[2:28:15] of Higher Ground
[2:28:16] needed to hear
[2:28:18] and if you come out of this service like
[2:28:21] this and don't love God more
[2:28:24] you understand me I believe you came in
[2:28:27] here loving him but tonight you need to
[2:28:29] love him more
[2:28:31] because he just set you free he said
[2:28:34] some things tonight
[2:28:36] if you really took heed if you really
[2:28:38] heard it if you really received it
[2:28:41] you you won't be the same there's no way
[2:28:44] you can be the same and Satan can't
[2:28:47] listen one of the things he said tonight
[2:28:49] I mean I've got a lot of little things I
[2:28:51] can preach on
[2:28:53] but one of the things he said is that
[2:28:55] you got to shoot and I've heard it but I
[2:28:58] saw something in tonight I'd never seen
[2:29:00] before
[2:29:01] shooter Birds
[2:29:03] of your sacrifice
[2:29:06] shoot the birds off your your sacrifice
[2:29:10] is perfect
[2:29:13] there is no errors there is no place for
[2:29:18] Darkness Jesus said I have no darkness
[2:29:20] in me
[2:29:22] and whatever the birds are
[2:29:25] that's trying to consume your sacrifice
[2:29:29] you have a right Abraham's seed
[2:29:33] to shoot him of your sacrifice
[2:29:36] [Music]
[2:29:37] oh I love the whole thing from A to Z it
[2:29:40] was just amazing
[2:29:42] one of the things too that I thought man
[2:29:45] I thought I've traveled
[2:29:48] I've done a lot of traveling but never
[2:29:50] like Abraham on his feet and you know I
[2:29:54] mean yeah we go and and I want to say uh
[2:29:57] something I really appreciate
[2:29:59] our brother Jesse's comments
[2:30:01] um concerning me and y'all know me
[2:30:04] and he knows it and and we all know it
[2:30:07] that none of this could be possible
[2:30:09] without the Lord Jesus
[2:30:11] uh you know I I just appreciated him
[2:30:15] because very seldom do you hear somebody
[2:30:20] uh say something how they've been
[2:30:22] blessed through what God has done
[2:30:25] through you it's it's really you know a
[2:30:28] blessing
[2:30:30] my wife I know she was blessed tonight I
[2:30:33] was blessed tonight
[2:30:34] um I can't explain it and if y'all don't
[2:30:36] fear the presence of God something's
[2:30:38] wrong with you the Lord Jesus is in this
[2:30:40] place
[2:30:41] and so I thank God for our brother's
[2:30:44] sacrificing
[2:30:46] and and listen it's like okay
[2:30:50] he he asked
[2:30:52] he said something about who all fight
[2:30:56] depression
[2:30:57] what I had to think about it because
[2:30:58] it's been such a long time since I mean
[2:31:01] since I went to see Jesus and since
[2:31:03] Jesus met me
[2:31:06] all I can tell you is that whenever the
[2:31:09] Devil comes at me God comes that back
[2:31:11] right back right back and so I've been
[2:31:14] on a plane and I'm enjoying this plane I

[2:31:34] been cemented

[2:50:30] everything that has been said and done

[2:50:35] song service tomorrow so come with all
[2:50:38] your fire come with all your joy make
[2:50:41] sure you get some rest come with all
[2:50:43] your strength amen because we want to
[2:50:45] give God we just want to give God we
[2:50:47] want to make tomorrow a special day
[2:50:50] uh day of salvation but a day of
[2:50:53] Deliverance a day of release however we
[2:50:56] just want you to come whatever you have
[2:50:58] in your heart that you want God to do
[2:51:00] for you just come with that you know and
[2:51:04] we know that when he comes it is the
[2:51:07] anointing that destroys the yokes so
[2:51:10] we're distrusting by the grace of God
[2:51:12] that
[2:51:13] that you would give God the Liberty
[2:51:16] tomorrow like you gave him the Liberty
[2:51:19] today and if we could just do that we
[2:51:21] know that God will take us even deeper
[2:51:24] and higher in him in the name of Jesus
[2:51:27] Christ
[2:51:28] let us pray
[2:51:30] father God we thank you for your grace
[2:51:32] and your mercy What a Mighty word
[2:51:36] a word of love
[2:51:39] nothing but Divine love Lord that you
[2:51:42] would walk us through the scriptures
[2:51:43] even as you walk Abraham through his
[2:51:46] journey that we might see
[2:51:49] how much you care for us
[2:51:52] and that you would make us know
[2:51:54] though we go through these things the
[2:51:58] work had already been finished before
[2:52:00] the foundation of the world
[2:52:03] thank you Lord Jesus that nothing can
[2:52:06] stop this no wonder your word says
[2:52:09] nothing absolutely nothing can separate
[2:52:13] us from the love of God no matter what
[2:52:16] the enemy puts toward us no matter how
[2:52:19] many times he calls us to stumble to
[2:52:21] fall
[2:52:22] you always Lift us up and we thank you
[2:52:25] Father now give us the grace give us the
[2:52:29] love for you the way you love us that we

[2:52:38] as we leave this building may we never
[2:52:42] leave your presence May praise be on our
[2:52:45] lips and within our hearts and as the
[2:52:48] psalmist says may the words of my mouth
[2:52:51] and the meditation of my heart be
[2:52:54] acceptable in thy sight my Lord my
[2:52:57] strength and my redeemer and as we close
[2:53:01] this portion of the service
[2:53:04] we pray that you will keep everybody
[2:53:05] safe as we travel home let no herd armor
