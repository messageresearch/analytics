[39:41] good to us I am so thankful that God is
[39:46] good to us he's been better to us less
[39:50] saying only believe
[39:53] [Music]
[39:57] this song goes directly with the word
[40:01] tonight we appreciate the Lord Jesus
[40:04] Christ it's only a few of us here but
[40:08] the Bible says where two or three are
[40:09] gathered in my name there I am in the
[40:11] midst why everybody else is worried and
[40:14] fretting and everything else the bride
[40:17] is making herself ready this is our what
[40:21] we call happy out this is our time this
[40:25] is our day this is what the prophecies
[40:27] have already been bound up and about and
[40:30] we must embrace it as is it as it
[40:35] unfolds is that right because we know a
[40:40] man who can turn on the light the
[40:43] darkest of all times and in the Gentile
[40:46] history but the Bible said that God has
[40:49] never left himself without a witness all
[40:53] things are possible
[40:57] Oh Neely
[41:03] all leaving
[41:06] we know that the angel the Lord enjoys
[41:08] it so we believe that all these star
[41:16] people
[41:20] holy Lord I believe Lord hi
[41:32] I believe that all things are possible
[41:41] lord I believe Lord I believe
[41:50] [Music]
[41:55] believe that all things are possible
[42:03] Lord Lord I receive yes sir law piracy
[42:14] Lord that all
[42:25] Oh Lord I see let us turn the scripture
[42:53] to Luke 23 Matthew Mark Luke Luke 23 I
[43:05] remember the time in 1977 I was in the
[43:11] Apostolic Church at that time I remember
[43:15] seeing for the first time what we call
[43:18] UFOs being that I have had a little
[43:23] experience in military and and and in
[43:27] the way planes do move and more I knew
[43:30] that what I was looking at was not some
[43:33] airplane or some helicopter and at that
[43:38] time I didn't know this message the way
[43:40] we know it now but I remember screaming
[43:43] and hollering you know I write in the
[43:45] open I don't know what inspired me to
[43:47] say the words that I said but I kept
[43:51] screaming lord whatever you do don't let
[43:53] me miss the rapture and of course 1977
[43:58] and I believe God gave me this message
[44:00] in in 1983 that's when the message came
[44:04] to me it was during that time I began to
[44:07] understand what I was seeing I didn't
[44:11] know that there had been a prediction
[44:13] that the rapture would perhaps take in
[44:16] 1977 but it was a major things happening
[44:19] during that time those of you who were
[44:22] still babies or yet not born we would
[44:26] like to say that in that time the gospel
[44:30] on the east coast was moving like a
[44:33] wildfire young people teenagers college
[44:39] students they were all being baptized in
[44:42] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it was
[44:44] really a newspaper paper thing if you go
[44:48] back in that time you perhaps can look
[44:50] it up because there was such a move of
[44:53] God at that time and of course we didn't
[44:55] understand what was happening but we
[44:57] understand that there was a lot of
[44:59] miraculous things happening in that time
[45:01] and during that time you had PTL and all
[45:03] these other religious programs that were
[45:06] were literally bringing Jesus Christ on
[45:11] the scene but we thank God for His grace
[45:14] because I believe God answered my prayer
[45:17] I believe that I'll see the translation
[45:21] now I want to encourage everybody
[45:23] tonight because we don't know how far
[45:27] this thing can go but I don't believe
[45:29] it's a dress rehearsal I believe this is
[45:31] the real thing and I believe that it
[45:34] will it should bring the bride of Jesus
[45:36] Christ to a place of repentance a place
[45:39] of sanctification a place in making
[45:42] herself ready for the coming of the Lord
[45:44] we can put it off in our minds and we
[45:46] could think that we have another round
[45:48] to go but I think that would be quite
[45:51] foolish I was thinking about this
[45:53] message I thought about how Titus came
[45:56] to Jerusalem to ask as Jesus Christ
[46:00] prophesied he came a few years early and
[46:03] he left and the people thought maybe the
[46:06] prophecy had failed and then Titus come
[46:08] right back around in 80 70 and destroyed
[46:11] Jerusalem that little space that God
[46:14] gave them was a window of repentance a
[46:17] time to get themselves right yet they
[46:20] fail to see what God was doing I believe
[46:23] that this little space that we have
[46:25] right now God has granted us that the
[46:28] bride of Jesus Christ will make herself
[46:30] ready so let us turn to Luke 23 of
[46:35] getting at the 26th verse we don't have
[46:38] to worry about the plagues as long as
[46:42] you are under the blood no no no evil
[46:45] shall come nigh that place that dwelling
[46:47] place he said when I see the Blood I
[46:50] will pass over you
[46:52] amen and as they had led beginning at
[46:56] the 26th verse of Saint Luke and as they
[46:59] had led him away they laid hold upon one
[47:03] Simon a searcher as a serene Ian's
[47:08] coming out of the country and on him
[47:12] they laid the cross that he might bear
[47:15] it after Jesus and there followed him a
[47:19] great company of people and of women
[47:22] which also be wailed and be Lindt
[47:25] lamented him
[47:27] but Jesus turned unto them and said
[47:30] daughters of Jerusalem we not for me but
[47:35] weep for yourselves and for your
[47:38] children I believe that we're living in
[47:40] that day and time right now but behold
[47:44] the days are coming into which they
[47:47] shall say blessed are the barren and the
[47:50] wombs that never bare and the paps which
[47:53] never gave suck then shall they began to
[47:58] say to the mountains fall on us and to
[48:02] the hills cover us for if they do these
[48:05] things in the green tree what shall be
[48:09] done in the dry one more scripture let
[48:14] us go to mark the fifth chapter I really
[48:22] meant to ask our sister - saying the
[48:23] blood line but maybe after service if
[48:25] she has it in her notes if not I ain't
[48:30] gonna put the pressure on you but I know
[48:34] one thing that is so true I love that
[48:37] song because it's true the devil can't
[48:41] cross this bloodline mark 5 34 through
[48:45] 43 and he said unto her daughter thy
[48:50] faith hath made thee whole
[48:52] go in peace and be whole of thy plague
[48:58] while he yet spake there came from the
[49:02] ruler of the synagogue's house
[49:04] certain with
[49:06] certain which said that a is dead why
[49:10] trouble is now the master any further as
[49:15] soon as Jesus heard the word that was
[49:17] spoken he said unto the ruler of the
[49:20] synagogue be not afraid only believe and
[49:26] he suffered no man to follow him say
[49:30] Peter and James and John the brother of
[49:34] James he come into the house of the
[49:37] ruler of the synagogue and see at the to
[49:39] mark and them that wept and wailed
[49:42] greatly and when he was come in he said
[49:47] unto them why did I make you this ado
[49:51] and weep the damsel is not dead but
[49:56] sleepeth I like the way Jesus look at
[49:58] things and they laughed him to scorn but
[50:03] when he had put them all out he taketh
[50:05] the father and the mother and of the
[50:07] damsel and them that were with him and
[50:10] entered in where the damsel was lying
[50:13] and he took the damsel by the hand and
[50:17] said unto her Tabitha Kumi which is
[50:21] being interpreted damsel I say in 2d our
[50:24] eyes and straightway the damsel arose
[50:27] and walk for she was of age of 12 and
[50:31] they were astonished with the great
[50:34] astonishment and he charged them
[50:37] straight ly that no man should know it
[50:40] and command that something should be
[50:43] given her to eat one more scriptures
[50:47] forgive me let us turn to Isaiah 21 one
[50:54] thing about the blood of Jesus Christ
[50:56] being applied today we don't have to see
[51:01] it on the doorpost on the lintel but it
[51:02] must be on your heart and the blood
[51:05] applied to your heart is the blood
[51:07] applied by faith amen
[51:10] if you can believe that the blood has
[51:12] been applied the blood has been applied
[51:13] it has nothing to do with the way you
[51:16] feel it is what God has said
[51:19] amen amen I was there 21 6 but thus help
[51:26] the Lord said unto me go set a watchman
[51:29] let him declare what he see it let us
[51:35] pray
[51:36] father God we come before your Lord and
[51:38] we thank you for your grace
[51:39] we thank you for your mercy we thank you
[51:42] for being so good to us we thank you
[51:45] Lord for everything you have and is
[51:48] doing for us we pray for those who are
[51:51] here tonight and those who are tuned
[51:53] into the service by way of YouTube we
[51:57] pray father God that you were blessed
[51:59] them in their homes encourage them Lord
[52:02] let them see that the Death Angel has no
[52:05] power over us we thank you for the blood
[52:09] of Jesus Christ we thank you for this
[52:12] hour this is the hour that the bride
[52:15] should be fired up
[52:17] amen knowing that this is her day and
[52:20] the move is on the bride bless us now in
[52:24] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[52:26] you may be seated I I wanted to give a
[52:33] title to this message that was quite
[52:36] long in the in the title would be the
[52:40] seven seals message is stun during in
[52:42] the ears of the bride it's a long one
[52:46] and so I I told either brother
[52:49] we're just cut it short only believe
[52:52] because you and I understand by God's
[52:55] grace that a system can't save you even
[53:00] though we gather here there's no
[53:03] salvation in this building because
[53:06] salvation only comes by the word and we
[53:09] want everybody to realize tonight amen
[53:13] regardless of what denomination that you
[53:16] may claim to be your denomination can't
[53:18] save you there is no power in it they
[53:22] have all failed God the Bible tells us
[53:26] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[53:28] today and forever and the Bible
[53:33] it's also that these signs shall follow
[53:35] them that believe in my name they're
[53:38] cast out Devils we know what mark 16
[53:41] says but when it comes to the Church of
[53:44] the day we find out that she lays blind
[53:47] and stripped of her powers like Samson
[53:51] but one thing I love about Samson is
[53:54] that he came to recognize that he was no
[53:57] longer the man he used to be but they
[54:00] also came a day that even though his
[54:02] natural eyes had been plucked out he
[54:05] still was able to see and he said
[54:09] perhaps there's a possibility and that
[54:14] that God will restore me and that's what
[54:17] we must understand with God there's
[54:19] always a possibility you never rule out
[54:22] the mercies of God the grace of God
[54:25] because God's mercy into a favor in His
[54:29] grace forever and so you know Samson
[54:33] says Lord once more and I believe this
[54:37] is what the bride is crying out every
[54:41] one of us it meant here tonight
[54:43] uh-uh you know this this this
[54:45] coronavirus staying weather like I said
[54:48] how ever long it goes one thing it is an
[54:51] eye-opener it is something that God is
[54:54] allowing to get our attention while
[54:57] everybody else is fearing and shaking
[55:00] and quaking the bride is saying I know
[55:03] what to do for her
[55:04] his going home time his bride she'd time
[55:08] because the Bible said he'll never leave
[55:10] himself without a witness you and I are
[55:14] here to bring Christ on the scene ooh
[55:18] and and we understand that Christ is not
[55:23] a denomination or organization we know
[55:26] that Jesus Christ is the word because
[55:29] the Bible said in the beginning was the
[55:31] word the Word was with God in the Word
[55:33] was God
[55:33] this word is God in print no matter how
[55:38] many people say is faulty I find no
[55:42] fault in him
[55:44] ma everything has failed the churches
[55:48] has failed every denominations has
[55:51] failed you know it's more to God than
[55:54] singing songs it's more than God in
[55:58] tianjin Church is more to God amen
[56:02] they're just claiming to be a Christian
[56:04] because a Christian is a life it is the
[56:10] life of Christ in a human being I read
[56:15] those scriptures because we know
[56:18] according to the message that this would
[56:21] be a time where people would would wish
[56:25] they hadn't had children and there are
[56:28] those who are glad they didn't have and
[56:32] and we see now that this thing is
[56:35] progressively going to get worse it's
[56:38] going to get worse before it gets better
[56:41] but we need somebody to direct us or
[56:45] something to direct us in this day and
[56:48] time it's like when Moses there in Egypt
[56:55] he wasn't a popular man and and many of
[56:58] the Israel that Raley's didn't like him
[57:00] because you know he was excommunicated
[57:03] forty years before he came back to Egypt
[57:06] he was a fugitive
[57:08] because he he killed an Egyptian but
[57:12] that same man God had already ordained
[57:16] and given instructions to the children
[57:20] of Israel so they could know how to
[57:22] escape out of Egypt in the same time our
[57:27] time God has likened a messenger a
[57:31] people didn't like him but regardless to
[57:35] the way they felt about him it could not
[57:38] take away who he really was and we're
[57:43] talking about the man William Branham
[57:45] many people failed to to listen to him
[57:49] when he lived but we find out that the
[57:51] message in which he's preached has come
[57:54] alive and has always been a lie
[57:57] but now we can see it prophecy is being
[58:01] made clear by these modern events we
[58:06] know the next move hallelujah
[58:09] and you and I must understand that God's
[58:13] bride has never listened his way God has
[58:17] never changed his character Jesus Christ
[58:22] is the same yesterday today and forever
[58:25] if there were signs and wonders and
[58:28] miracles at the time of Moses Exodus
[58:32] there must be signs and wonders and
[58:35] miracles at this Exodus we call it the
[58:40] third Exodus we know by God's grace that
[58:45] many things are coming upon the earth
[58:47] and this is only the beginning many
[58:51] people are thinking that this
[58:53] coronavirus is bad is not the worst that
[58:56] is to come and you know that you and I
[59:00] are living in a time amen where
[59:02] everybody is practically insane but they
[59:08] think they have their sanity but they're
[59:11] really insane and it's been proven but
[59:15] nevertheless let's move on we know by
[59:18] God's grace that unbelief is one of the
[59:24] most hideous things that can strike a
[59:28] person is it well I mean unbelief
[59:32] because unbelief doesn't change facts
[59:37] it's like for example somebody might go
[59:40] outside and the sun is shining and they
[59:42] could say I just don't believe that the
[59:44] sun is shining it doesn't change the
[59:48] facts the sun is shining
[59:52] unbelieving to say well I just don't
[59:54] believe Noah ever existed and the ark
[59:57] ever floated the unbelief doesn't change
[1:00:03] the facts
[1:00:04] somebody could even say well I just
[1:00:06] don't believe in God because you don't
[1:00:10] believe in God
[1:00:11] doesn't change the fact that God exists
[1:00:15] and somewhere down the road your
[1:00:19] unbelief will become belief but during
[1:00:23] that time it's too late all the people
[1:00:26] that disbelieve the message of Noah
[1:00:29] became believers but the time they
[1:00:32] thought to believe it was too late the
[1:00:36] rain was falling the door to the OP was
[1:00:40] closed and this is where we are now we
[1:00:44] don't know the time or the day that God
[1:00:48] is going to close the Gentile door is
[1:00:52] that right because remember no one never
[1:00:55] shut the door it was God who shut the
[1:00:58] door so now that we have this time to
[1:01:02] repent now that we have this time to
[1:01:04] believe we should believe I love that
[1:01:07] only believe that means to believe only
[1:01:11] it gives no space for unbelief
[1:01:15] hallelujah it gives no space for doubt
[1:01:18] or fear belief is believing that's all I
[1:01:21] can do whew I love that now we were
[1:01:26] talking and I love the story in' because
[1:01:29] you got to understand that somehow you
[1:01:33] and i must understand that we must bring
[1:01:36] christ on the scene and we also must
[1:01:39] understand that the move is on something
[1:01:43] is moving right I chose that scripture
[1:01:47] watchman one of the night see because
[1:01:50] God always have a watch a watchman
[1:01:54] somebody always there they can see what
[1:01:56] God is doing is he has a long-range
[1:01:59] vision right come you know that's why we
[1:02:02] needed a prophet we needed a man that
[1:02:05] God had gifted that can see long-range
[1:02:08] tell you about the enemy tell you
[1:02:11] whether it's getting ready to do
[1:02:12] hallelujah
[1:02:13] now we don't wrestle against flesh and
[1:02:15] blood but we also know that the ant
[1:02:19] illusion day came upon man because of
[1:02:22] science this Corona
[1:02:24] virus has come upon men because of
[1:02:26] science dabbling into God's laboratory
[1:02:31] in the days of Noah it got out of hand
[1:02:34] and it caused the flood in that day
[1:02:37] hallelujah we don't know how far this
[1:02:40] thing is going to go because I've been
[1:02:42] told it's mutating it's changing is its
[1:02:45] character now it's come to do one thing
[1:02:48] three things steal kill and destroy and
[1:02:51] you must understand that a jar like that
[1:02:55] is nothing but demons and so what these
[1:02:59] people have done is that they have
[1:03:01] tapped into the laboratory of God
[1:03:03] perverted it anything perverted becomes
[1:03:06] demonic and these demons have minds they
[1:03:11] could think oh no not a little germ a
[1:03:15] jar that's how cancer starts it starts
[1:03:18] as a germ in that jar began to multiply
[1:03:22] and multiply and multiply and eventually
[1:03:25] that perverted light comes to kill you
[1:03:28] so is it with these germs after a while
[1:03:32] the thing that they created will be on
[1:03:35] build will be beyond anything they would
[1:03:39] know how to manage you first of all
[1:03:40] there's no such thing as a cure for
[1:03:42] viruses hello if there was a cure for
[1:03:49] virus we would have had a cure for the
[1:03:51] cold long time ago and that's why the
[1:03:53] enemy chose a cold or flu because
[1:03:56] they're known that once this thing
[1:03:59] starts it had you either have to build
[1:04:01] an immunity to it or your faith will
[1:04:05] destroy it somebody help me here because
[1:04:08] there is no cure for this thing it will
[1:04:13] move his way up and see well this thing
[1:04:15] has been going on long time ago and you
[1:04:19] and I must understand that this is a
[1:04:21] warfare and I thought God I don't know
[1:04:23] who started it but somebody knows who
[1:04:27] started it and if it started with
[1:04:30] someone don't you understand other
[1:04:32] countries I'm gonna fight back hmm
[1:04:37] they're gonna fight back and you saw a
[1:04:39] brother most well how can i scape
[1:04:41] there's only one escape it's under the
[1:04:45] blood of Jesus he is the only one that
[1:04:50] can stop the move of the devil and what
[1:04:53] people don't understand is this is
[1:04:54] Satan's Eden when Satan defeated Adam in
[1:04:58] the Garden of Eden God gave him right to
[1:05:02] the world that's why the world began to
[1:05:05] get worse and worse and worse and worse
[1:05:07] and worse what is it
[1:05:09] Satan his whole intent was to transform
[1:05:13] this earth into another hell hello and
[1:05:18] when the bride of Jesus Christ leave
[1:05:22] this earth this earth will become hell
[1:05:25] and Satan will rule it without the
[1:05:32] mercies of God normally she no more
[1:05:35] grace and everybody's that's left behind
[1:05:41] will experience the true power of an
[1:05:46] evil force that we call the devil
[1:05:50] Lucifer somebody help me here
[1:05:55] you see cause sicknesses of the devil it
[1:05:59] never came in by God it came by the fall
[1:06:03] by our choosey and because we chose a
[1:06:08] mentor to follow Satan or Lucifer
[1:06:10] because remember as long as you stay
[1:06:13] with the word you are worshiper of God
[1:06:16] but when you leave the Word of God then
[1:06:19] you worship something else so we we look
[1:06:23] at this thing and we see that Jesus is
[1:06:25] on the scene and what oh I think are for
[1:06:28] the Lord Jesus they've been great
[1:06:30] prophets that came but no one no one no
[1:06:35] one is like Jesus Christ he was the king
[1:06:39] of kings and the Lord of lords Easter
[1:06:41] he's the prophet of all prophets
[1:06:43] hallelujah and his word never fails
[1:06:47] that's what I'm trusted in tonight he
[1:06:50] well I never failed it was this woman
[1:06:54] who had seen Jesus doing a lot of
[1:06:57] miracles and I've got a hurry we've seen
[1:07:00] it you know she had heard of Jesus doing
[1:07:02] miracles and here was this a woman who
[1:07:04] had an issue of blood and no doubt she
[1:07:06] was perhaps going through menopause and
[1:07:07] she hadn't had this this issue of blood
[1:07:10] for 12 and long years and I can imagine
[1:07:12] her she went to the Baptist and they
[1:07:14] couldn't do nothing and she went to the
[1:07:15] Methodist and they couldn't do nothing
[1:07:17] and she went to the Presbyterian
[1:07:18] they couldn't do nothing in it because
[1:07:20] they don't they believe that the days of
[1:07:21] miracles are past she went to every
[1:07:24] Church no doubt the Bible is that right
[1:07:26] she had how many seven husbands how many
[1:07:28] was she had it men are doctors whether
[1:07:31] she had gone through these doctors and
[1:07:32] yet not one of them could heal her
[1:07:37] disease but she saw Jesus she had heard
[1:07:42] that he could stop he could heal it
[1:07:45] y'all hear what I'm saying and no doubt
[1:07:49] in the crowd he is a crowd now this
[1:07:52] woman in said well I'm going to touch
[1:07:53] the hem of His garment I saw this this
[1:07:56] condition had already bent over I love
[1:07:59] this position because it's a a position
[1:08:01] of humility it's a place of humbleness
[1:08:04] and somehow she got down and that's what
[1:08:09] a lot of people they want to be healed
[1:08:10] they want to be delivered but they don't
[1:08:12] know how to get down this lady got down
[1:08:15] and she touched the hem of His garment
[1:08:18] she said no word there was no Bible but
[1:08:22] a revelation struck her if I could would
[1:08:24] just touch the hem of His garment I
[1:08:26] would be made whole maybe that's what we
[1:08:29] need tonight but in order for us to be
[1:08:32] made whole we got to humble ourselves ah
[1:08:35] not looking this way look at this way
[1:08:38] looking down it says oh if I could just
[1:08:41] touch the hem of His garment only
[1:08:44] believe now I'm coming to some things
[1:08:46] because he said first of all be not
[1:08:50] afraid you understand me
[1:08:52] you can't fear and believe at the same
[1:08:54] time fear and faith doesn't work
[1:08:58] together somebody help me here you
[1:09:01] either are frame
[1:09:03] all you believe somebody help me so we
[1:09:08] find out that this y'all remember Jarius
[1:09:11] I like Jerry's because he was a a
[1:09:13] high-class Centurion or whatever he was
[1:09:15] and he had a daughter I think she was
[1:09:18] about 12 years old and she fell sick now
[1:09:22] the pressure of this whole situation was
[1:09:25] that - in order to follow this man
[1:09:28] called Jesus who was nondenominational
[1:09:31] he wasn't part of the Pharisees he
[1:09:34] wasn't a part of the Sadducees he wasn't
[1:09:36] a part of the huronian he was not a part
[1:09:39] of filling it with any of them so much
[1:09:41] so they asked him one time Jesus tell me
[1:09:43] where did you get your authority in
[1:09:45] other words what school of divinity did
[1:09:48] you attend hallelujah oh my and of
[1:09:54] course he could not respond to them in
[1:09:56] the way that they wanted him to respond
[1:09:59] but they could not say he didn't
[1:10:03] understand the scripture because even at
[1:10:06] the age of 12 Jesus confounded the
[1:10:09] Pharisees in the scripture they tried to
[1:10:13] tie him up many times and I love this
[1:10:16] scene when Jesus they asked Jesus uh
[1:10:19] where you get your authority he said
[1:10:21] I'll tell you what you tell me where
[1:10:23] John the Baptist get got here's and then
[1:10:25] I'll tell you where I got mine
[1:10:27] hallelujah
[1:10:28] then the air communica council got
[1:10:30] together this and I we tell him these
[1:10:32] things he don't say well why didn't you
[1:10:34] believe him and follow him and they came
[1:10:37] up they huddled up they broke out of the
[1:10:39] huddle hallelujah ha ha and they came to
[1:10:42] Jesus says master we cannot tell I love
[1:10:46] this scene because Jesus was no pushover
[1:10:49] hallelujah and he said because you
[1:10:51] cannot tell me he said neither can I
[1:10:54] tell you hallelujah see because they
[1:10:58] knew that if they said they did believe
[1:11:00] in John the Baptist there were people

[1:15:57] the day they used to hire people for
[1:15:59] funerals did you all know that yeah
[1:16:01] especially if you don't have that many
[1:16:03] people in your house they hired people
[1:16:05] you ever seen those old movies and all
[1:16:07] those women with a mum with you they
[1:16:11] would call mourners and so they would
[1:16:14] hire people to cry for you and model for
[1:16:18] you hallelujah
[1:16:20] and guess what Jesus put them all at the
[1:16:22] house there's no choirs in this house
[1:16:29] hallelujah there's nothing but peace why
[1:16:32] because Jesus is here hallelujah when
[1:16:36] Jesus stepped in the door he could care
[1:16:38] less how long tabatha or other daughter
[1:16:40] of jairus was dead he knew he was a
[1:16:43] resurrection and that's what I'm talking
[1:16:46] about we don't care that let the virus
[1:16:48] they gonna come but you know what God
[1:16:50] has already ordained people who has the
[1:16:53] ability to call them back we can't be
[1:16:58] afraid not even of death because we have
[1:17:01] the power of the resurrection
[1:17:03] not enough ABAB he's in us the Bible
[1:17:06] said the life and death is in the tongue
[1:17:09] whew somebody I know you might find this
[1:17:13] to be strange but the other day I was
[1:17:17] just thinking about a brother thinking
[1:17:21] about a brother and my phone Dow the
[1:17:25] brother God is my witness I'm like what
[1:17:30] is this and I checked all you know how
[1:17:34] you have those recent calls I check all
[1:17:36] my recent calls and make sure was
[1:17:38] nowhere on the list you know to make
[1:17:40] sure I didn't pop and he wasn't in my
[1:17:41] pocket he was right there and it just
[1:17:43] called I was just thinking about it
[1:17:45] and it died I don't understand it y'all
[1:17:48] can say well it's something happened
[1:17:50] something did happen
[1:17:52] but my thought was that God hugged me
[1:17:54] thinking oh and he dialed the brother
[1:17:58] for me
[1:17:59] that might sound crazy to you but it was
[1:18:02] just a token for me it was something
[1:18:04] that God gave me to say don't worry
[1:18:05] brother Brooks hallelujah in that day
[1:18:08] and hour I'll hear your call and I
[1:18:11] answer your call well I feel like
[1:18:14] screaming hallelujah when I think about
[1:18:18] this thing in the world what the world
[1:18:19] is going through I was thinking about
[1:18:22] cried this morning I was thinking about
[1:18:24] all of the things that's happening to
[1:18:25] these innocent people to these people
[1:18:27] who don't know better do these people
[1:18:29] who don't even have a shelter they don't
[1:18:31] even know that Jesus Christ is alive and
[1:18:33] well and they don't know that Jesus
[1:18:35] Christ is the answer to the crisis
[1:18:37] hallelujah we know that America won't
[1:18:40] repent but the Bible said if my people
[1:18:43] they which are called by my name will
[1:18:46] humble themselves and pray and turn from
[1:18:50] their wicked ways he said I were here
[1:18:52] from heaven and heal their land but
[1:18:56] they're not gonna do it they bypassed it
[1:18:58] every since 1956-57 they were waived and
[1:19:02] tried in the balance that was when a
[1:19:04] miracle was supposed to repent and they
[1:19:06] didn't they crossed the line and you can
[1:19:09] see from that time on to the 60s on up
[1:19:11] we became more corrupt more corrupt more
[1:19:14] corrupt we're more corrupt than we ever
[1:19:17] this is the very how could this is the
[1:19:20] dark ages of the Gentiles hmm this is
[1:19:24] the dark ages but God has never left
[1:19:27] himself without a witness and I want you
[1:19:29] to understand that every witness of God
[1:19:31] was the individuals who look insane to
[1:19:34] those who were insane hey it's alright
[1:19:40] if they think you crazy because you know
[1:19:43] you got better sense than them is that
[1:19:45] right it's the truth
[1:19:46] listen you don't think the people are
[1:19:49] crazy I'm gonna give you an example in
[1:19:50] i'ma go ahead on in the time that Jesus
[1:19:53] crossed over to the Galleria right the
[1:19:57] man who had legions this man had so many
[1:20:00] devils he was stripping his clothes off
[1:20:02] he was naked
[1:20:05] like the day naked and don't know it but
[1:20:09] at least leisure news he had he was full
[1:20:11] of Davos but the people stripped their
[1:20:14] clothes now and don't know that they
[1:20:15] insane now I tell me they're not insane
[1:20:23] they go to beaches in it along the way
[1:20:25] US bikinis are kooky knees whatever you
[1:20:30] want to call it when I in my day you
[1:20:36] would've been locked up for in this
[1:20:38] indecent exposure in my day a man
[1:20:42] couldn't even walk the street with his
[1:20:43] shirt off in my day let's move on but
[1:20:48] nothing changed other than the people
[1:20:51] have become insane they said if you feel
[1:20:54] like doing it do it mercy understand in
[1:21:01] Isaiah it says Amen the morning cometh
[1:21:06] also the night and just not long ago I
[1:21:10] was driving early morning and it was so
[1:21:12] the darkness was different I said to my
[1:21:16] wife
[1:21:18] something different about it and I had
[1:21:20] no idea that Corona was on the way
[1:21:22] [Laughter]
[1:21:24] somebody help me yeah yeah better you
[1:21:27] know we got to realize this is serious
[1:21:32] we don't know how bad is going to get
[1:21:34] but remember now when the Black Plague
[1:21:37] hit Eaton would they thought that the
[1:21:40] Jews were witches because they were the
[1:21:45] only ones that didn't get sick but you
[1:21:48] know what that was they knew how to live
[1:21:51] clean huh their food was clean their
[1:21:56] clothes were clean they knew how to
[1:21:57] bathe they knew how to keep the germs
[1:22:00] off somebody help me is your truth and
[1:22:05] here we are today and then in a world
[1:22:08] and they say oh if I wash my hands that
[1:22:10] gonna keep him saying if I stay inside
[1:22:12] that's gonna keep me safe there's no
[1:22:16] safe place
[1:22:18] you can shut everything down but it
[1:22:20] doesn't kill the virus it lives on
[1:22:22] whatever they create it will continue to
[1:22:25] live and gonna wait until it gets
[1:22:27] another subject is that right
[1:22:31] how many of you had the flu more than
[1:22:33] once right and understand it's not going
[1:22:40] down in my car I'll cut down the
[1:22:42] casualties but we know what's happening
[1:22:44] don't we people y'all know what they're
[1:22:46] doing yeah they're trying to depopulate
[1:22:50] cut down on the number of people and
[1:22:54] they want to get rid of the elders and
[1:22:55] all of that first of all Oh help me
[1:22:58] Jesus they're gonna look at me and Ruby
[1:23:02] said why y'all still livin hallelujah
[1:23:05] you know why because the blood of Jesus
[1:23:09] protects us it's the truth yeah I don't
[1:23:15] have to take a vaccine or nothin like
[1:23:16] that I i'm already naki lady yeah
[1:23:23] the sun is approaching understand when
[1:23:26] that Sun began to approach what was
[1:23:28] brother branham let me say like you know
[1:23:29] what was his type when he came you see
[1:23:32] people didn't understand him because
[1:23:33] they they couldn't understand a man who
[1:23:35] was so clothing humility he never pushed
[1:23:39] himself he never say I'm the big guy
[1:23:42] I'm the Superman no he actually promoted
[1:23:44] Jesus Christ it was Jesus Christ he was
[1:23:48] here reflecting and representing not
[1:23:50] some man he was trying to get us to see
[1:23:53] that the morning star is here and if the
[1:23:57] morning stars Jesus Christ that means
[1:23:59] that the Sun is about to rise hallelujah
[1:24:04] and he preached the message is the
[1:24:05] rising of the Sun what was he saying
[1:24:07] it's coming darkness the darkness is
[1:24:10] grows you can feel it I hope I'm not
[1:24:14] whining too much old people can
[1:24:16] understand me but but what is is that
[1:24:18] this darkness is going to get greater
[1:24:20] but is that the greater and denser it
[1:24:23] becomes it proves that they're coming a
[1:24:28] breaking of the day did you know that
[1:24:31] light
[1:24:32] darkness a certain time of the morning
[1:24:36] began to fight and that darkness
[1:24:40] conjugates and get darker than ever but
[1:24:43] that light is stronger than darkness and
[1:24:45] it pushes that darkness right out of the
[1:24:48] way
[1:24:49] hallelujah like will always defeat
[1:24:53] darkness but but let me move on but what
[1:24:57] people don't understand and in the time
[1:25:00] of Egypt I love the story because when
[1:25:03] it got dark that's when it was the time
[1:25:06] that the Death Angel moved right and the
[1:25:10] Bible's call it plagues it was the
[1:25:12] plague of death and that Death Angel
[1:25:15] killed and destroyed every firstborn
[1:25:18] child that was not under the blood of
[1:25:21] Jesus Christ oh they can say well wait a
[1:25:23] minute I belong to the great church of
[1:25:26] Moses oh the great church of Abraham
[1:25:29] Abraham was my father he founded this
[1:25:32] church that death agent could care less
[1:25:34] they can say all praise God I was I was
[1:25:38] I was circumcised under Abraham's
[1:25:41] Authority you know he told us that we
[1:25:43] had to be circumcised eight day on the
[1:25:45] eighth day I'm circumcised that didn't
[1:25:49] work God could care less about that
[1:25:52] circumcision he told Moses put the blood
[1:25:54] on the doorpost and their little God
[1:25:57] don't care about you being a member of a
[1:25:58] church he want to see the blood he said
[1:26:03] when I see the blood I'll pass over you
[1:26:08] the blood the blood and this day is the
[1:26:12] baptism of the holy ghost who know it is
[1:26:18] darkest before dawn right oh my eat
[1:26:22] listen silence
[1:26:25] science you know claims it's the night
[1:26:27] see the Sun approaching pressing coming
[1:26:31] on pressing and conjugate congealing the
[1:26:34] the night together because it's known as
[1:26:37] just got to got a little while and the
[1:26:40] day were break and that's the way it is
[1:26:41] that devil know his time is short
[1:26:43] he knows he's just got a little while
[1:26:46] now see because once the bride its
[1:26:49] raptured once we're taking flight he's
[1:26:52] only got about what three and a half
[1:26:54] more years to do his thing and then
[1:26:57] Christ in the ages of God in the service
[1:27:00] of God and the Bride of Christ comes
[1:27:03] back and we rule this earth for a
[1:27:05] thousand years
[1:27:06] he knows but just like I preached the
[1:27:10] other night
[1:27:10] Satan want to overthrow God he thinks
[1:27:14] that because of what took place in the
[1:27:15] Garden of Eden when Adam failed that was
[1:27:17] like a type of God falling God cannot
[1:27:19] fall hallelujah
[1:27:22] hey man the only thing that God did for
[1:27:25] me was that he became my sin that I
[1:27:27] might become his righteousness he didn't
[1:27:30] just fall he gave it up he said I lay
[1:27:32] down my life and I pick up again I'm
[1:27:38] excited about this I could have been in
[1:27:40] the Buddhism I could have been Islamic
[1:27:42] hallelujah I could have been here and do
[1:27:45] ISM hallelujah but there's only one God
[1:27:47] there's only one living God and that is
[1:27:50] the Lord Jesus Christ and he proves
[1:27:53] himself every day whoo
[1:27:57] you see old brother books what are you
[1:27:59] saying you know that watchman stands out
[1:28:02] there that preacher standing this is
[1:28:03] what I've been trying to tell people you
[1:28:05] gotta have the Holy Ghost brother books
[1:28:07] you ain't deep enough you gotta have the
[1:28:09] whole he goes now we're at a place right
[1:28:11] now how deep is deep y'all know what I'm
[1:28:15] saying they got the education they got
[1:28:18] there that there's stimulation of their
[1:28:19] mind and God don't care nothing about
[1:28:22] that he wants to see the blood on the
[1:28:24] heart hallelujah let's see where
[1:28:28] everybody's standing now that this thing
[1:28:31] is pressing upon us you know what we
[1:28:32] need to do we need to redeem the time we
[1:28:35] need to find places somewhere we can
[1:28:37] pray and let God come and change our
[1:28:41] hearts because God don't care how long
[1:28:44] you've been in this message and how many
[1:28:46] things you know about brother Branham
[1:28:48] and how many pictures you got on the
[1:28:50] wall like I preached amen that's all
[1:28:52] some people God is a picture on the wall
[1:28:54] hallelujah and God is far more than a
[1:28:57] picture on the wall
[1:29:00] and you can you can say all kind of
[1:29:02] nonsense nonsense we've been deceived
[1:29:05] and and duped by the devil because he's
[1:29:09] kept us from the baptism he's kept us
[1:29:11] from the Holy Ghost just like all the
[1:29:14] other denomination they pushed it on out
[1:29:15] of the way and they wanted to look
[1:29:17] really nice and pretty god don't care
[1:29:19] about no you looking pretty he want to
[1:29:22] see a mess he want to see a atmosphere
[1:29:25] that will bring forth acts 2:38 babies
[1:29:28] screaming and hollering and speaking in
[1:29:31] tongues and jumping and shouting and all
[1:29:34] the miracles that follows that's the
[1:29:37] kind of church people are afraid of whoo
[1:29:41] yeah is that all right you know what our
[1:29:46] inspiration comes from heaven that's why
[1:29:48] we act the way we do that's why we live
[1:29:50] the way we do that's why we dress the
[1:29:52] way we do hallelujah you're not gonna
[1:29:54] find those striptease in heaven oh no
[1:29:57] everything is holy
[1:29:58] everything is holy from the top of the
[1:30:02] neck all the way down to the feet yes
[1:30:07] sir
[1:30:08] ain't gonna be no lust in a bear that's
[1:30:12] of the devil hope people that's beastly
[1:30:15] that's the animal that's the part that
[1:30:16] the devil gave us by way of the serpent
[1:30:20] that's why the Bible said that God ah
[1:30:23] that's got to die in order to inherit
[1:30:25] heaven heaven amen oh my see they said
[1:30:30] it couldn't be done
[1:30:31] and now the presbyterian the Methodist
[1:30:34] and the Baptist and seeking for it and
[1:30:36] in the pillar cultures are blind enough
[1:30:38] not to see the hour are you blind this
[1:30:41] is what I'm looking at this is the hour
[1:30:43] you know it's like his disciples
[1:30:45] remember I said this the other day I
[1:30:47] said Jesus at the hour is come where the
[1:30:49] Son of Man will be betrayed oh Lord
[1:30:53] you know how they they were more
[1:30:56] concerned about who was going to betray
[1:30:57] him then they were about the hour that
[1:31:00] was coming hallelujah and that's
[1:31:03] basically what we're doing we're more
[1:31:05] concerned about the hours the people who
[1:31:07] gonna be with that none of your business
[1:31:09] you just make sure he says listen
[1:31:12] he said it's so dark I want you
[1:31:14] understand this is that our God is
[1:31:16] giving this is our you can't say Lord
[1:31:18] stop it stop it you can't stop it it's
[1:31:20] already in motion it can't stop it has
[1:31:24] to do what it's got to do but then there
[1:31:27] was those three Peter James and John who
[1:31:30] represented the church at a time they
[1:31:32] should have been praying Jesus had come
[1:31:35] come pray with me come pray with me my
[1:31:43] hours at hand they're gonna persecute me
[1:31:46] they're gonna crucify me come pray with
[1:31:48] me all I ask you to do is pray within
[1:31:51] one hour and the Bible said they could
[1:31:53] not even pray with them one hour him
[1:31:56] without one hour without hid them going
[1:31:59] to sleep Jesus coming here wake him
[1:32:02] awake him pray pray he realized it the
[1:32:06] devil had him see the darkness is so
[1:32:09] thick y'all know how it is it's hard to
[1:32:12] pray it's really hard to pray you get on
[1:32:15] your knees and guess what the next thing
[1:32:17] you know you hear C is the same
[1:32:22] anointing it's the same thing that Satan
[1:32:25] is laying the darkness is holding and as
[1:32:28] soon as the devil comes he knows when
[1:32:30] the weakest Saint gets on his knee
[1:32:33] something has to happen so he stops you
[1:32:37] right there by putting his sleep and
[1:32:38] tired it's the same way we're studying
[1:32:40] you can read anything you want to you
[1:32:42] can listen to anything you see anything
[1:32:44] on your phone read your Bible Oh help me
[1:32:50] Jesus

[1:32:54] was fighting against you because of the
[1:32:57] hour we're living in help us Jesus don't
[1:33:01] let us fall into the same snares because
[1:33:05] then he told Peter James and John said
[1:33:07] 'hey you got to pray unless you fall
[1:33:09] into these temptations keep us out of
[1:33:12] the temptations and it shows that here
[1:33:15] was peter when the temptation came on
[1:33:17] him he just fooled it when they came
[1:33:20] that crucified jesus the first thing he
[1:33:23] did it took the sword and he tried to
[1:33:25] cut the means
[1:33:26] listen the bottom said this is not the
[1:33:28] bride you don't fight with the sword you
[1:33:31] don't need guns you don't need arrows

[1:33:35] hallelujah is that right because the
[1:33:38] miracle worker is with you somebody help
[1:33:41] me here when that here came off of that
[1:33:44] soldier Jesus was right there to pick it
[1:33:48] up
[1:33:48] had he not Peter would have been charged
[1:33:51] with murder but I loved about Jesus he
[1:33:55] put the ear on the man and he covered
[1:33:58] the evidence there was no evidence that
[1:34:01] Peter tried to kill him so he had no
[1:34:03] witnesses
[1:34:04] hallelujah so will it be in the squeeze
[1:34:07] when we make the wrong move God will
[1:34:09] make the right one Hey

[1:35:44] I can't do it I've been a good Christian
[1:35:46] I've done all the good things that a
[1:35:48] Christian supposed to do but to give up

[1:38:51] change your predestination if God has
[1:38:54] already elected you to be bride you'll
[1:38:56] be there is that right look at Peter ha
[1:38:59] he messed up did not Jesus three times
[1:39:02] but God had already promised in McKees
[1:39:04] and who was the spokesman on the day of
[1:39:08] Pentecost Peter himself huh nothing can
[1:39:12] take away God what has he what God has
[1:39:15] for you it is for you nothing can stop
[1:39:18] that oh but I'm so glad I'm elected who
[1:39:21] I yes God is calling the elected calling
[1:39:26] the virtuous bride the word the last day
[1:39:28] church the elected lady of our Lord
[1:39:31] Jesus Christ Jesus is the word
[1:39:33] how many believe that hallelujah alright
[1:39:36] then the bride is already part of the
[1:39:38] bridegroom so the bride will not be a
[1:39:41] denomination I'll have to be she'll have
[1:39:44] to be the word right manifested to be
[1:39:47] the Bride of Christ that's the part of
[1:39:49] life manifested manifested that means
[1:39:55] Christ has the
[1:39:56] seen through you hallelujah
[1:40:00] that don't mean that all of us got to be
[1:40:02] Superman and leaping over with buildings
[1:40:05] and it with a single bound
[1:40:07] hallelujah you can be a dishwasher and
[1:40:10] still be the bride of Jesus Christ whoo
[1:40:13] hallelujah see he promised to do it he
[1:40:17] said how he did it
[1:40:18] never never loses his pattern is that
[1:40:21] right
[1:40:21] he's always did it by the pattern he
[1:40:25] done it every time by the pattern he
[1:40:27] does it again
[1:40:28] calling on his virtuous bride in the
[1:40:30] last day and that's what he's doing down
[1:40:32] I believe with all of my heart when God
[1:40:36] woke me up the other morning he said
[1:40:38] I've given them space to repent and they
[1:40:42] will not repent there'll be a lot of
[1:40:44] people who will not repent even in this
[1:40:47] time because Satan got them thinking
[1:40:50] they got more time you don't have more
[1:40:53] time and let me say it like this if I
[1:40:56] had more time would it not be ready for
[1:40:58] me to the wisdom of the whole thing is
[1:41:01] to make myself ready it's better to
[1:41:04] stand still in the doorway waiting on
[1:41:06] him then to try to make everything right
[1:41:08] when he knocks those who are left behind
[1:41:14] don't have no idea what they're in for
[1:41:17] hallelujah can I go back let me tell you
[1:41:21] something historically there have been
[1:41:22] men raised up a man who was anointed by
[1:41:25] pure Devils who literally destroyed
[1:41:28] mankind because they were different
[1:41:30] hallelujah and in every race they did it
[1:41:34] not just the white race but every race
[1:41:36] have been wicked like that starting from
[1:41:39] the Garden of Eden you had a Nimrod and
[1:41:42] everybody else yeah right it's true we
[1:41:46] looked at him like he was a war he was
[1:41:48] one of those but there have been many
[1:41:51] before they're right and you gotta
[1:41:56] understand people when you talk about
[1:41:57] yeah I don't care about Hitler no more
[1:42:00] than I care about some black leader oh
[1:42:03] you better say that hey my leader is God
[1:42:08] he leaves me there's no good thing in
[1:42:11] the flesh
[1:42:12] hallelujah you know who brought me to
[1:42:15] freedom Jesus did people look at these
[1:42:20] people cause I tell people you know
[1:42:22] people got some strange thing where
[1:42:24] Jesus was black who cares I don't care
[1:42:26] if he's you know polka dot stripe green
[1:42:29] but who cares he died for my sin I want
[1:42:34] to see him if he's the ugliest thing in
[1:42:36] heaven I'm gonna show enough run up to
[1:42:38] him and kiss him
[1:42:39] i'ma hug him because he'd be the
[1:42:42] beautiful thing that I heathens have
[1:42:43] been the most beautiful thing that I
[1:42:45] ever seen well I will see in heaven will
[1:42:48] be Jesus Christ himself I don't care
[1:42:51] about no golden streets and you know
[1:42:53] gold and Nissen pearly gates all those
[1:42:56] things are good but I want to see I want
[1:42:59] to see him yeah he's people oh he was a
[1:43:04] Jew he was not but he was he was not he
[1:43:10] wasn't Joseph's son neither was he
[1:43:11] Mary's son he was God's Son and Mary was
[1:43:15] just an incubator
[1:43:16] Jesus God created the body and the blood
[1:43:19] none of that blood was Joseph's and none
[1:43:22] of it was Mary if it had been we would
[1:43:25] still be sinners he chose that race but
[1:43:29] understand the promised seed was never
[1:43:31] to be a natural seed it was a promise
[1:43:35] seed it was a seed of God that replace
[1:43:39] Adam is that right about said Jesus was
[1:43:45] a quickening spirit the second Adam
[1:43:50] somebody help me here see how I get so
[1:43:52] tired of these people trying to national
[1:43:54] nationalize Jesus like that's gonna be a
[1:43:57] plus for them they're just as many evil
[1:44:00] black as there is white yellow and every
[1:44:03] other color amen all of us born in
[1:44:06] seeing shaped in iniquity come out
[1:44:08] speaking life confidence in that kind of
[1:44:12] stuff that's that's foolishness
[1:44:16] that's carnal
[1:44:20] yeah and the devil still got us thinking
[1:44:22] that one race is more superior than the
[1:44:24] other oh I could say some things on that
[1:44:29] but God won't let me but let me tell you
[1:44:31] this we die the same way we're born the
[1:44:34] same way we bleed the same way we lie
[1:44:37] the same way we steal the same ain't no
[1:44:43] superior race don't even say it don't
[1:44:46] even think that you know let's move on
[1:44:54] because the lot could be said and you
[1:44:58] know when when when it comes to that
[1:45:00] people still believe that they are an
[1:45:01] Indian and they and you know can never
[1:45:05] say this let me say like this like the
[1:45:08] Prophet said what happens if when we get
[1:45:11] to heaven Jesus is a color that's
[1:45:13] different from all colors and what you
[1:45:17] gonna do woo yeah my color who cares
[1:45:22] ah you know I don't care about first of
[1:45:35] all those are people who like tall
[1:45:37] people he won't be tall he was short and
[1:45:44] what's gonna happen there right cause
[1:45:47] you know that's this issue today
[1:45:49] people think they greater ain't no
[1:45:51] greater without the blood of Jesus
[1:45:54] Christ you all dying see every race can
[1:45:58] I say let me see this and I don't know
[1:45:59] why I'm on this but you gotta understand
[1:46:02] what happened after the fall
[1:46:04] wonder who Nimrod was and don't you
[1:46:08] understand before the continental drift
[1:46:11] everybody was the same color it was a
[1:46:16] continental drift that changed the
[1:46:19] colors of the flowers hallelujah the
[1:46:25] white man went to the north
[1:46:26] that's why his nose is this way to block
[1:46:30] out the cold weather so it wouldn't
[1:46:32] freeze his brain
[1:46:33] No and this is why ours is wide
[1:46:36] we went south we were in the hot comfy
[1:46:39] cut so our noses are open now I can chop
[1:46:45] it on down but guess what the white man
[1:46:49] can give a black man blood transfusion
[1:46:51] the black man can give a white man we
[1:46:53] give a Chinese with you it shows we all
[1:46:55] come from the same people let me move on
[1:47:00] I'm stirred see because we got to
[1:47:04] realize this coming a tormenting spirit
[1:47:06] this devil is coming listen and what we
[1:47:09] fail to see is that after the first
[1:47:12] world war the lid of hell was open and
[1:47:15] demons flowed out of hell and they
[1:47:19] landed a ban first of all they they were
[1:47:21] in Germany influencing Stalin Hitler and
[1:47:25] Mussolini and they destroyed the Jews
[1:47:27] and look what they did to those people
[1:47:29] that was just a picnic compared to what
[1:47:33] they're getting ready to do now because
[1:47:35] they went into Hollywood and Hollywood
[1:47:37] went into hell y'all know they devil
[1:47:41] worshippers they went into hell and they
[1:47:44] began to pull out everything oh that's a
[1:47:47] horror movie
[1:47:48] that's from Hell that's what they do
[1:47:50] there all these hideous things that they
[1:47:56] did and they what did they they put it
[1:47:58] on the street screen and you're thinking
[1:48:00] you're looking at something fictitious
[1:48:01] and what you fail to see is that you was
[1:48:03] looking at the reflection of what was
[1:48:05] going on in hell and those same things
[1:48:10] that people that watch is going to come
[1:48:13] back and torment them when God leaves
[1:48:17] when the bride of Jesus Christ leaves
[1:48:19] those same thing will work on their
[1:48:22] imagination and cause them to
[1:48:24] hallucinate so they will see
[1:48:26] grasshoppers tallest building locust is
[1:48:29] and everything else and it'll be so real
[1:48:35] hmm they talk about zombies and I'm off
[1:48:39] my nose but I might go ahead on with it
[1:48:40] they don't even understand that brother
[1:48:42] branham prophesied that they're coming a
[1:48:44] germ warfare
[1:48:46] and he said that germ will cause the
[1:48:48] flesh of men to rot on them while
[1:48:51] they're living and the birds will come
[1:48:54] down him again to eat off of their flesh
[1:48:56] while they're living so we had it in
[1:49:00] writing before Hollywood brought in on
[1:49:03] the screen hello
[1:49:06] and it's coming it's coming you love the
[1:49:12] Lord Oh what is it it's through science
[1:49:16] and the food the hybrids that's
[1:49:19] perverted the whole human body till we
[1:49:21] become a bunch of a massive corruption
[1:49:23] if the physical being is corrupted is it
[1:49:27] the brain cell in that physical being
[1:49:29] now watch the spirit follow it there
[1:49:32] comes a time in the name of the Lord
[1:49:34] that people would be completely insane
[1:49:37] y'all don't think they are saying they
[1:49:40] are fighting over toilet paper that's
[1:49:48] insanity
[1:49:52] can't eat toilet paper but that's how
[1:49:59] they fight don't make sense
[1:50:01] you know people kill each other over the
[1:50:03] least little thing let me move on I hope
[1:50:07] I'm not going too long but anyway my
[1:50:10] watch is stopped now follow me there
[1:50:14] comes a time in the name of the law that
[1:50:16] people would be so completely insane the
[1:50:18] bible says so they're screaming how a
[1:50:20] great hideous things in their imaginary
[1:50:23] mind the radios and things our
[1:50:25] television programs are producing it
[1:50:27] there be such things as as ant raise up
[1:50:30] in the earth that would be as high as 14
[1:50:33] trees a man a bird would fly across the
[1:50:36] earth with wings four to five miles
[1:50:39] across and people are people to see them
[1:50:42] they're screaming hollering cried for
[1:50:44] mercy but it'll be the plague is that
[1:50:47] right I read to you the scripture in
[1:50:49] that day they gonna say blessed is the
[1:50:52] womb that never bared blessed is that
[1:50:56] one who's not with child that day is
[1:51:00] I mean it's approaching us now but when
[1:51:03] the bride of Jesus Christ is raptured
[1:51:05] the people have no protection there's no
[1:51:09] more blood to protect you right now the
[1:51:11] blood of Jesus Christ circles the earth
[1:51:13] and it keeps even the sinner Amen from
[1:51:16] places where the devil would take them
[1:51:18] but once that blood is taken away from
[1:51:20] the earth you have no protection totally
[1:51:24] insane I know people think I'm crazy but
[1:51:27] we'll see down the road we're going to
[1:51:30] see you know it's the truth
[1:51:32] now let me say it like this Cain killed
[1:51:36] Abel and it was a horrible situation
[1:51:39] right now we look at movies and they
[1:51:43] killing each other and blowing each
[1:51:44] other up you know chopping each other up
[1:51:46] and everything we're not even moved by
[1:51:48] it when one act when Cain killed Abel
[1:51:53] alarm God now we see so much blood it
[1:52:00] doesn't make was desensitized we loved
[1:52:04] it and you were getting that get that
[1:52:08] moving we get all in there
[1:52:13] and you don't even realize that you
[1:52:14] become a part of a murder scene because
[1:52:18] your heart has confessed kill him Satan
[1:52:22] has pulled you into that and God will
[1:52:24] judge you for it you see and what we
[1:52:27] don't understand is that Satan is smart
[1:52:29] he's Lucifer he knows I'm a move on
[1:52:33] y'all y'all love the Lord
[1:52:35] oh he's calling to the bride he's
[1:52:37] calling to the right and this is what I
[1:52:39] must say is difficult to fight the
[1:52:45] invisible enemy if you could see him
[1:52:50] you'll know how to work it because he's
[1:52:53] invisible that's one thing about the
[1:52:56] church in the early days they knew who
[1:52:58] the enemy was they died because they
[1:53:01] could see their enemy they knew what the
[1:53:02] enemy was doing but now I enemy is
[1:53:04] spiritual we can't always see where he's
[1:53:07] hiding
[1:53:08] hallelujah but if we stay
[1:53:11] in the blood we have a defense he can
[1:53:15] come out us but he can't get to us why
[1:53:18] because he can't cross the blood line ha
[1:53:21] ha ha hallelujah you look at these
[1:53:25] things they were Brotherhood's what are
[1:53:27] you saying I'm gonna tell you something
[1:53:28] like this the blood of Jesus Christ is
[1:53:30] so powerful
[1:53:30] I've got loved ones right now who ain't
[1:53:32] living right but so did job Joel was a
[1:53:36] shot of the type 7 children that was
[1:53:39] restored hallelujah and let me tell you
[1:53:42] something I got the bloodline that is
[1:53:45] being applied hallelujah protecting them
[1:53:48] right now from Satan taking their souls
[1:53:51] to hell I believe that if God did it for
[1:53:54] job gotta do it for me this is the great
[1:53:57] hour that's when the hope of more
[1:53:59] mortals life has finished and you and I
[1:54:04] we know we're breaking into that you
[1:54:06] know look at the wickedness of man and
[1:54:08] let me say like this and I'm a closed
[1:54:09] because I can't finish all of this but
[1:54:12] you've got to believe now the move is on
[1:54:14] you you got to stop we got to stop this
[1:54:17] foolishness and being afraid of what's
[1:54:19] happening here you got to understand and
[1:54:21] say listen I've got a I've got I've got
[1:54:23] a claim I've got to pull up I've got to
[1:54:25] be the person I've been been professing
[1:54:28] to be all all my Christian and walking
[1:54:30] all my Christian life God is depending
[1:54:32] on me hallelujah and I believe that if
[1:54:36] God in Northeast Sampson he could take
[1:54:38] the jawbone of an ass and kill hundreds
[1:54:40] of people what about us that's a shadow
[1:54:42] of the type God cannot be overcome and
[1:54:46] neither can he be overthrown let me say
[1:54:49] like this recognize who you are if you
[1:54:53] are a son and daughter of God you are
[1:54:55] greater than the Angels hallelujah and
[1:54:59] understand you are a higher order than
[1:55:02] Lucifer and all of his demons and you
[1:55:05] mean to tell me you gonna let a law
[1:55:07] order defeat you no shock the Bible said
[1:55:10] when the enemy comes in like a flood the
[1:55:13] Lord will lift up a standard you are the
[1:55:16] standard Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:55:19] you are the powerhouse you don't have to
[1:55:23] go look forward here to come but when
[1:55:25] comes God is standing with you Carter
[1:55:28] stand for you I look at those ones whose
[1:55:31] you know I love Joseph because Joseph
[1:55:36] never lost faith in God his brothers
[1:55:38] betrayed him threw him in the ditch
[1:55:40] he ended up Amen in Egypt as a slave
[1:55:42] hallelujah for years
[1:55:45] mistreated but he still trusted in God
[1:55:48] that's what I'm telling you it doesn't
[1:55:51] matter the hardship that we might have
[1:55:53] to be fought but that would befall us
[1:55:54] the hard times we got to come they are
[1:55:56] today ordained but you see one thing
[1:55:59] about delayed love the Bible said love
[1:56:01] conquers all things and if you have the
[1:56:03] real love of God in you it will conquer
[1:56:05] everything everything the Satan comes
[1:56:08] with you
[1:56:08] it will listen is that right one thing I
[1:56:11] know that's why the Bible said if
[1:56:13] somebody rail on you you don't rail back
[1:56:15] let love project like the bull the bull
[1:56:19] had to back up it had to stand still the
[1:56:22] bees had to turn around because law was
[1:56:25] projected that's your defense hallelujah
[1:56:30] the devil get all up in your face and
[1:56:32] all you got to do is says lord have
[1:56:34] mercy
[1:56:35] Father forgive them for they know not
[1:56:37] what they do
[1:56:38] can you imagine we're not when the
[1:56:40] soldiers and the enemies of said Jesus
[1:56:42] heard Jesus pray that faith that prayer
[1:56:45] they must have melted like butter
[1:56:47] oh my god what kind of man is this that
[1:56:50] can still forgive us with what we have
[1:56:53] done to him you love the Lord
[1:56:57] all right so much I want to I just have
[1:57:00] to finish this on Sunday Lord's will but
[1:57:03] yeah I will I'm just trying to encourage
[1:57:05] the people only believe is where I'll
[1:57:07] pick up on Sunday Lord's will only
[1:57:10] believe only believe keep believing
[1:57:13] don't know your message it's right this
[1:57:16] message is running 100% right everything
[1:57:18] that God is going to do and what happens
[1:57:20] you said what do you mean understand
[1:57:22] this that God ill he will bring us
[1:57:25] another anointing he will bring us a
[1:57:28] greater anointing right now the
[1:57:30] anointing has been lifted lifting off
[1:57:33] the earth and that's why I've been too
[1:57:34] hard to pray and hard to do this but God
[1:57:36] allowed that so Satan can come in
[1:57:38] and do what he has to do but now Satan
[1:57:41] is at the place where God is getting
[1:57:42] ready to out pour upon the wheat and the
[1:57:45] terrier remember the pair Lord send us a
[1:57:47] ring citizen citizen ring and and when
[1:57:51] they both wheat and tear cried out for
[1:57:52] the rain the rain came yes it's the time
[1:57:56] this is the time that all believe us
[1:58:00] weed and tear will is crying out because
[1:58:04] they know that only God can fix this
[1:58:07] problem and they're saying Lord send us
[1:58:10] the revival you know why because we know
[1:58:13] we don't that the condition of this
[1:58:16] world is because of the backsliding
[1:58:18] Christian if the Christians had held
[1:58:20] their ground we would have been in
[1:58:22] Millennium by now but because we left
[1:58:25] our first love we went after the world
[1:58:27] we became like Samson defeated had a
[1:58:31] history of being being victorious now
[1:58:34] you know what people brag on that's the
[1:58:37] way the preacher sound and how good the
[1:58:38] music is but there's a time when they
[1:58:41] said oh the Dead was raised here the
[1:58:43] eyes of the blind was open you know it
[1:58:45] was a miraculous thing not taking away
[1:58:47] from the music in the preacher but it
[1:58:48] was greater than that we all have failed
[1:58:53] may we may God give us grace in this
[1:58:56] time of repentance to change and let God
[1:59:01] change our hearts and forget about these
[1:59:03] worldly things to call oh I'm gonna
[1:59:05] become this and I'm going to become that
[1:59:07] no you're not if the season is the way
[1:59:09] it is everything will be destroyed in no
[1:59:12] time soon right we're in the day of the
[1:59:15] rapture we're in the day of the
[1:59:16] translation it's like in the days of
[1:59:18] North oh I got a summer house I got a
