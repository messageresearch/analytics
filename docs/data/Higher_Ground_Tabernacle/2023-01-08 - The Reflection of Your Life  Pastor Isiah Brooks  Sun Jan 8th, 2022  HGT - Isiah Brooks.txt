he pressed anyway well we appreciate him that's my firstborn grandson his name is Christopher for those of you who don't know him uh we're gonna answer to turn with us to Joshua the Book of Joshua and we're going to read from uh the 24th chapter from 13th verse to the 28th verse Adventures foreign and ye dwell in them of the vineyard and of the olive yards which he planted not do you eating it is now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth itself put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood but despite college and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord and if it seemed evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom you will served whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the floods or the gods of the amorites in whose land ye dwell but as for me in my house we will serve the laws and the people answered and said foreign God forbid that we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods what do you do that for the Lord Our God he he it is that brought us up out of the father of our fathers out of the land of Egyptians from the house of bondage which did those great signs in our sight and preserved Us in all the ways where when we went and among all the people through whom we passed and the Lord drain out before us all the people even the amorites would dwell in the land therefore will we also serve the Lord for he is our God news will see himself and Joshua said unto the people ye cannot serve the Lord for he is a holy God and he is a jealous God he will not forgive your transgressions for if he forsake the Lord will he turn and do you hurt after that he have done good together and the people said unto Joshua no but ye are witnesses against yourself that you have chosen you you have chosen you the Lord you're sick you exam serve him pull yourself here and they said we Are Witnesses [Music] don't put away said he I know these Gods which are among you I don't know please and his voice we will obey that part again Joshua made a covenant with the people as he shared and Joshua wrote these words in the book of The Law of God he said and took a great Stone Pierre and set it up under and oh by the sanctuary of the Lord [Music] said unto all the people behold this Stone sixth year witness unto us for it has heard all the words of the Lord it shall therefore be it it shall be there for a witness unto you lest ye denied God your God I think of him Joshua said Joshua let the people depart please and every man unto his inheritance one more scripture same chapter John uh Joshua 24. you know we'll read the 31st verse and Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua all the days of the elders that over lived Joshua which had known all the works of the Lord for Israel let us pray father God we come before you thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy all that you have given unto us truly within ourselves all new we're not worthy of your blessings we thank you Father God for your grace and mercy I pray that you will speak to our hearts as we move completely out of your ways this morning that's right God is good to us and I trust by God's grace that the word of God will be a blessing to you this morning I have to start off this way comes out when God brought us the message it was not given to us just to memorize just poor memories it was given to us to take us into a higher order of life and we thank the Lord for that amen that he has blessed us can use that pain and given us an opportunity to eternal life we know by the message that uh Babylon Babylon has been defeated and those of you who weren't here on Wednesdays I made a statement in the statement is the greatest deception deception to a Christian I'm gonna say it again Christianity is the greatest deception you're a Christian because there are so many people who claim to be Christians among the group of Christians but even as all Israel Israel those who claim to be Christians [Music] Hallelujah now we have been given a prophet and we know that brother random is the prophet of our age people seem to not understanding during that time just like talking to the children of Israel Joshua became the leader God said to the people you have never traveled this way before so if you haven't traveled things will not look so familiar to you Hallelujah is that all right so you and I must understand what dude we haven't gone this way before we must be a new way Hallelujah now God spoke to Joshua and began to tell the children of Israel all that God had done for them hallelujah hallelujah how God defeated Enemy at the enemy God brought them out of Egypt brought them into a land come on Hallelujah that had housing that had fruits that had cattle yeah that had all kinds of great things in it dude and God's basically saying I have given you this land but you did not have to work foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Music] where we fight foreign [Music] you hear what I'm saying we should be farther up the road hallelujah hallelujah we supposed to be a Powerhouse but I find out that people are they just don't want to put in measure Coast Guard population to get anything out y'all understand me you have to contribute you have to partake you got to be a part of The Inspirations [Music] this is not a one-man Army anymore Joshua who is the Holy Ghost is just our leader Hallelujah but he come to lead the people come out of bondage Legend of Conquest Hallelujah but what has what have we done make history James 1 23 and 25. if any man be a hero of the word um his natural face in a glass hallelujah hallelujah for we for he beholded himself and goeth his way and straightway forget it what matter of man he was hallelujah hallelujah and that's what many have done that's the second book we've looked into the words forgetting what kind of a man was supposed to be [Music] that's right that's right for he beholding himself again and goeth his way and straightway forget it what manner of man he was but who so Lucas Mr Ricky into the perfect law of Liberty and continue therein being not a forgetful hero of the words of God the open book live over that word that's now open gives us access to the entire Bible and all of his promises Hallelujah is that all right see the Seed of Abraham God said from the dust to the Stars will bow before you maybe I'm Obsession here this morning I said maybe I'm insane here this morning but I feel good if nobody else makes you feel good Hallelujah why because I recognize this morning that what God has done for me no man can take it from me Hallelujah and what God is doing for me I know that God can do it for you but you know baby a lot of us don't even love the word you don't read you don't study you don't pray and how can you love the word and I can't make you love the words but so many of us have been so programmed when you get a preacher like me you don't know how to handle it because I'm not going to be theatrical for you I'm not going to be theatrical for you I'm not going to do the Hollywood drama hallelujah amen yes I know how to do it I can get you stirred up what I want to eat want you to hear this morning is the word of God Amen Hallelujah I guarantee you I forgot the music in here right y'all be shaking Hallelujah the music don't save you but that music Hallelujah prayer don't even save you only faith in God hallelujah hallelujah the Bible says at the name of Jesus Christ every Niche about Jesus Christ let me say it like this we don't even that's for this way how can I say it without not trying to down you but oh should you say but how many of you know that your name has been changed how many you really know that your name hallelujah hallelujah now the prophet of God came and all the prophet to do one thing and that was to prepare us for a Rapture but brother Brandon couldn't prepare us for a rap yeah and then when the seals were broken he began in a way that he's never seen him before now watch this because even Paul said but there is a mystery that God held uh uh hid from the world Hallelujah until the end times what is this mystery ah I look at it and I I think to myself I wish I could really cause a Revival in you but I don't know how come on God has to bring the Revival and you've got to want the Revival Hallelujah because you got to realize by the grace of God one thing because you're super new and that is to make sure that the words that I preach will allow you to grow in the grace of God y'all hear what I'm saying what good will it do us to say we are a dove and we're not it is but we've got all these dub feathers stuck all in us we're acting like a dove the best we know how but no matter how you try to act that way come here come here hallelujah nature will betray you what connects y'all better hear what I'm saying I don't care how much we jump before we got here don't care about how many minutes you got this interested in one thing and that is seeing his image he's come to see his image and how will do we get there I'm gonna ask you a question how many of you have listened to the message the statue of a perfect man really listen to it let me tell you something that is a message you must listen if you want to make a Rapture that is a message that you must listen did Hallelujah they had characters I'm gonna show you something this morning I hope you can see it christer hidden by his nature people say I know Jesus but you don't know him if you don't know his nature and a Christian is known by its nature hallelujah hallelujah it ain't about all that you wear even though that's a part of it Hallelujah but who's gonna outdress the Muslim but because they dress like that don't make them Christmas hello somebody hello somebody hello yeah just say it just say it what we're looking at and this is where I'm going with this because I want to see Jesus he said in that day you know I'm in the Father the fathers and yeah I want to see Jesus do you understand what I'm saying you understand what I'm saying hallelujah hallelujah and the only way we're going to see him there's a certain way is that we must die to ourselves one of the quotes that preachers have quoted even myself where brother Brandon said you have been Justified as though you've never sinned in the first place you know that don't apply to you if you don't have the Holy ghosts don't even apply to yourself amen but hallelujah hallelujah and when you get the Holy Ghost it's not you accepting God is God accepting you who's accepted y'all hear what I'm saying this is not an hour that we should wonder whether we have it or not the Bible said make your calling any lessons my message this morning the reflection of your life amen you know Israel said we're going to serve God we'll serve God and Joshua which is the type of the Holy Ghost said but no you will not I I think no you will not he was literally bringing them to a challenge Hallelujah and Joshua say no you will not know Hallelujah is that right it's kind of what Jesus did to the disciples the security says you have to feel discipline he said except you eat my flesh you know I do and drink my blood you have no part in here hallelujah and that Gallant Man by the name of Peter they said don't you know the people when Christ said will you go too because he said oh Lord where can I go the only one who has the words to eternal life if you need this message there was only one in our days amen William Brown I'm calling him but God gave him the words amen amen amen hallelujah and we can sit back and praise the Lord and say well yes God's still a prophet but there were millions in the days of Moses and Jesus said that everyone dead he's so too small sometimes I say things uh concerning brother Branham and a lot of people think that I'm against brother Brown kidding me foreign you know I'm not here to be popular they have no idea what my life consists of is whether you think I can preach or not I could have had a mega church but I could have never had a mega church preaching the truth give me soda crackers and Branch water don't worry y'all hear what I'm saying but I'ma say it like this to you this morning not one of you'll be able to stand before God did not preach you the truth hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah His Image his lightness Sonic yeah Hallelujah Genesis 5 1-3 Genesis hallelujah hallelujah and it reads Sally this is the book of the generation of Adam in the day that God created man in the likeness of God made he him male and female created he's them and bless them and call their name Adam in the day when they were created and Adam lived 130 years son in his own likeness after his image and called his name Seth and we do not renowned the set hallelujah hallelujah now holy God hello I'm sorry no no just let me stop there I was blending something there but what was it if you notice there see [Music] we've got to Humble ourselves Thomas the statue of a perfect man how long do that statue that is the divine nature of God that is where Christ hid himself yeah you'll see what I'm talking about in just a minute but people are looking for Jesus and they don't understand he's in his nature and wherever his nature is that's where Jesus is hiding himself from the world and they can't see it he's even hiding himself from believer called themselves to walk according to the message that followed Joshua yeah we're not believers because even after they crossed over Jordans showed his colors hallelujah hallelujah what happened because if I still connected to Babylon Hallelujah and as long as you still connected to Babylon you're gonna always have those Spirits pulling on you Hallelujah let me move on see we got to die and rot to ourselves a lot of us we don't want to do that but those Christianity is a narrow way the narrow way y'all hear what I'm saying most people don't want the narrow way because they can't just do what they want to do but Paul says I'm a prisoner of Christ and you must become a prisoner of Christ in order to follow Christ all the way to Calvary now but no in the message brother Ron tells us here holy God could not condone sins so nothing could touch the mountain where God was talking about Mount Sinai weather then God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in the form of Jesus Christ his creation then that son I don't surface gave his life and the blood cell of God was broken that the life might come out of the blood I knew y'all understand it was given to us hallelujah hallelujah listen it's so sad it's just so sad I see too much Christianity but I want you to look and see who you are don't let the devil deceive me you don't get a second chance with this can you imagine the Rapture knowing this message and yeah you miss it huh that's possible Paul said you can understand all Mysteries give a prophecy mountains give all your goods to feed the poems even allow yourself to be burned for sacrifice somebody help me here this morning because it's nothing but the truth but we're very seldom think about charity very seldom think about charity charity is something that you must have in order to make a rapture amen and I'm not talking about this this uh filial love is I'm talking about Agape hallelujah hallelujah listen St John 4 24 24. the Bible says God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him hey let me say it like this how many you of you know that you got the spirit how many do you how many no you have the Holy Ghost well if you don't have the Holy Ghost right now your worship is in vain amen am I trying to get to your heart I'm trying to get yourself because it's later than what you think hallelujah we're talking about the squeeze we don't know what's coming next y'all remember the fear that covet drop on us there's coming something worse [Music] how are you going to handle the thing that's coming if you don't grow in God haven't taught you anything it should have taught you something you understand what I'm saying that time you should have been examining yourself foreign [Laughter] but then God said to me because they love cast out fears Hallelujah that's what I gotta have more than anything else second Corinthians 5 17 says therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature I I love that not a patched up job Hallelujah is that all right all things are passed away the whole all things have become new this is what a real Christian is if you're still dipping into the old life you used to live something is wrong with your experience your way into the kingdom of God oh oh why owned you that ain't gonna make Heaven it's not a valley Goose all that bad stuff will not make Heaven you can say all the grace of God but the Bible says no unclean and if the blood of Jesus Christ have not been applied to your life they don't make no difference who you are I encountered a preacher I won't call the country from which he was from it but this man carried on so bad message [Music] at another brother they were going like he was like world war three going on so I walked up to the brother who was a pastor I thought he was the most disrespectful man I had ever met claiming to be a man of the cloth you guys pictures soon as I got a break of course you impose I said brother have you ever heard of the message the statue of a perfect man I said but you need to listen to it because you ain't got none of the virtues it stopped him for a moment but how can you tell me Jesus Christ works out of uncontrolled uncontrolled Works uncontrollably you'll never see him you never saw him screaming you've never seen him you've never seen him yelling you've never seen him out of control who do you think we're going to heaven with that okay let's move on I'm just saying the Bible says and you that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by Wicked works [Music] in the body of his flesh to present you holy son unblameable unreprovable in his sight you talking about a perfect man Hallelujah Deuteronomy 4. how many of y'all really want to make a rap and I'm going to ask you a question and how how many of you really believe you're ready what makes you think you're ready do you bear the divine nature of God in you excuse me if the divine nature of God is in you then you're ready it's not talking about being nice and goodness is that right brother Brandon said Christian Science can do outdo all of us in that hallelujah we're not talking about man-made righteousness we're talking about the righteousness of God I feel like you're out in this morning one thing I do feel good because a couple of days ago I was down with the flu so I feel pretty good measurements I'm just gonna let you know I feel pretty good take heed unto yourselves okay lest she forget the Covenant of the Lord your God which he made with you and made you and and and make you a Graven image or the likeness of anything for the Lord that God is a consuming fire Hallelujah now I'm gonna say something that's going to make somebody mad in here who is Mary to the Catholic Church she is a mediator and people believe that they can't get to God without Mary and the jean-pomsky personally and we've done the same thing with William Branham hey Hallelujah right it's the truth tonight we we've used him let me I've said this myself and the Holy Ghost correcting me oh Lord if the prophet of God was here and the Lord spoke to my heart and says what if he walks I don't literally I don't see the prophet he can't do nothing without me that's right right hello you can't do nothing without him the branches without me so more oh you say oh that ain't true it is even when Jesus came remember those Pharisees were throwing up we be Moses disciples and then Jesus said don't you even dare say that Abraham is of your father because before Abraham was God hallelujah before Luther was I broke down before Wednesday I am still gone foreign hallelujah hallelujah you love the Lord amen he said for the Lord that God is a consuming fire even a jealous God for a long time I thought being jealous you know how you're human beings they see you with something and they like it and they can't get it so they get all jealous that ain't the kind of jealousy he's talking about God it's a fierce fiercely protective or Vigilant of one's right or possession in other words you belong to God and he is a protector of his inheritance oh come on somebody and you must understand God is not going to allow you to continue to be an adulterer idolata that's the word I meant to say and idolatized because there's only one way to worship God and that is Hallelujah but many of us we're still trying to get to Jesus and Christ has already come hey please y'all don't got quiet on me yeah so I can let me clarify myself no way am I telling you that you don't listen to this message no way am I trying to get rid of Williams y'all hear what I'm saying because God even took Joshua Moses is dead but remember everything Moses y'all hear what I'm saying [Music] in order to connect with Isaac it's sad to say see but there are so many people but yeah are so entwined in a system no idea that they're being deceived oh I can preach to you and make you think you're gonna go sweeping through the city but I'm gonna bring you some quotes that your own Prophet has said right now you might think that these are my words that I'm speaking you may think that these are my words but I'm speaking from the words that William Branham previous to the power curve William Branham what kind of image are you trying to come in yeah and don't you think I don't see and then when I came into this message everybody was wearing belt big belt buckles cardboard boots they both did the cowboy hats sent you what image were they betraying yeah they were they were portraying the image of William Brothers come on somebody because you wear a cowboy hat come over here a pair of blue jeans a big belt buckle that don't put you in the message no no sir but people were doing that I've heard so many stories but let me tell you something works on the end condition but people are deceived sometimes I've had people oh man I better not go there I might make somebody really mad but the things that people do when they go down to Jeffersonville due to the grave of the Prophet it is amazing you might as well be a Catholic and go see Saint Peter and kisses amen amen who made that thing a shrine it's the truth people of God we got to love Jesus the god that William random taught us America you know some of these people don't came you know I fought a long time or something I used to hear this thing they call nowaday the woke Society did they just did they just wake up you got to be careful if I got the definition right she said you know I woke up to be whatever I want to be if I want to be a cat I can be a cat if I want to be a dog I could be a dog did you know in the Washington State yeah a man can marry a beast um I'll be watching them people with them big dogs now you know it just I'm just saying excuse me not trying to make a joke but my point is there is so much perversion if I'm a woman but I but I'm a man what did y'all hear what I said yeah hardly nobody said amenities if you're not careful she would never be fast these things are gonna brainwash you and you won't become insensitive Hallelujah you hear what I'm saying hallelujah listen you you I can marry whatever and whoever I want no no no no amen amen hallelujah hallelujah that's fine we're living in a sinful Society a society full of sins I saw one time when I used to have YouTube black ladies saying she was white [Music] I mean must be under that skin because and I saw a white woman saying she was black my eyes betrayed me okay cause I know black when I see it and I know white when I see it and you can wanna be whatever you are but you want to be but God made you who you are you ought to be happy about who you are what was that I love my brothers who are white and my brothers whatever the case but I have never is that a shame of who I am and you shouldn't be ashamed of who you are what image are you reflecting I'm coming I'm coming to where I'm coming when you make an image you make an exact cards a lot of us love to take pictures Amen in those photos you know especially when they make you look good right some photos somehow to make they know how to make you look a little thinner you know who's there we love those pictures Hallelujah but you see that is the kind of image sisters God wants out of you an exact copy good job Hallelujah not when it comes to likeness the difference between the likeness and and the the image is definitely much because when mankind was formed into the image of God hallelujah that's the upshouse God is a man he has two hands he has a head and a mouth he looks like a man Hallelujah and so therefore we are formed into that image when it comes to likeness characteristics it's the character of him hallelujah hallelujah that's what we want we want God to form us into his image and his likeness this is what the message bring to the particular message Hallelujah women be women be men y'all hear what I'm saying don't try to cross the natures you got to be careful influence is something else that's why people I tell you oh I'll never do that no the only way you can say that is that you truly been born again right it's the truth coming into the image now Jesus Christ the Bible said the image of the invisible God the first born of every creature Hallelujah I know people everybody don't like the way I preach I'm gonna tell you the truth and my truth don't go with the system of the message am I very thinner the system of the message I'm sorry no I'm not though I'm really not you know [Laughter] I'm not looking for people to like me I'm old enough to know better copies but what was what was that statement that Jesus made in Saint John 10 30 30. he said I and my father are once that meant God and man Union they became one my question is what are you becoming what are you becoming because the spirits of this world will reshape you Hallelujah think about it on all of the people that was with lots that went down to Sodom all of his husbands Deuces their wives Hallelujah foreign [Music] y'all better hear what I'm saying you know this is the thing that Paul oh since the intro's good part had to deal with uh and and I'm saying like this one of the things that Satan brought in this day that's so corrupted to church in Christianity was women preachers um Paul had to deal with women preachers I'm saying this because Paul DeVille uh you got to understand a woman preacher can't bring you to Perfection cannot bring you to Perfection first of all she's not even supposed to be a preacher for me so I'm going to read you something it's out of order okay if you go to I'm going to women preacher churches and let me tell you something the men most of the Menace so if a minute because of the inspiration I can't imagine sitting up in the Pulpit my swab and my wife is the pastor and my family God have mercy your eyes tell you that's wrong it's wrong hallelujah hallelujah let me move on you know Paul said for it's a shame for a woman don't eat please now look at the question mark on each one of your your Bibles what the point what caused Paul to say that yes like that now if you ever get the letters that the Corinthians wrote to Paul because now you can get them in any good library that the Corinthians wrote to Paul come on they wrote and told him after these women who were converted they had a goddess over them and was called Diana and she was of Ephesus also defects and the Corinthians worshiped the same cause it was a heathen worship and they found a rock a rock out in the field one day and she dropped her image down to us do you see what I'm saying if you put the woman in that position you're now looking at a different image of God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah right oh my God yes we he said they said he's OD God is a woman and she dropped her image down to us and the temple was Far Beyond Solomon's Temple in other words it looked better than Solomons hallelujah look look what's happening in the world today but the world is following it's women preachers that's risen to the tops ability um don't tell me they can't preach they can preach I've heard women preach that will put some men to shame but they're still out of order and let me tell you what the same anointing that anoints the man the preach it's the same anointing that anoints that woman to preach your sons and your daughters will shall prophesy that's right [Applause] I I'm trying to get to this and I know if I don't give it to you now you won't come back this evening so but we don't have evening service anyway is this okay I don't know whether people left because they were tired or left because they were fed up but either way it goes I I have to preach what he wants me to pray and she dropped her image down to us right and their Temple was Far Beyond Solomon's Temple they said the historians oh it was all models with Solomon Temple [Music] [Applause] no no but yeah the perfect man living Tabernacle of the Living God hallelujah who was he talking about he's talking about us hallelujah hallelujah he's talking about us God this message you've heard me say it many times this message has come to change it if you're not being changed something is wrong it doesn't happen overnight see you still ought to be able to see the little man I can see myself growing wow I can see myself getting closer to God hallelujah it's not me the hope of glory he's the one that's bringing the change grandma we sing about the blood but the blood doesn't just come to justify you the blood comes to sanctify you and the blood comes to fill you brother Branham said it like this he comes out through that blood we are cleansed and now our blood amen no no our life which came by living through sexual desires brought our life in the world the place of Christ [Music] till you would come foreign I've had people in this message tell me we don't need the Bible no more the Bible is obsolete those people not even saved hallelujah hallelujah yeah even that Pastor who said that he loved brother Brandon more than he love Jesus Christ something's wrong with this experience something's wrong with you right hallelujah hallelujah glory to God you love the Lord I'm trying to preach my soul to your people and when you're skeptic of the Bible when you're skeptical the word being right you just might as well stay back until first you believe what is he said unbelief there's only two elements that control the human being that's either doubt or faith one or the other you Pro you possess of one that dominates your life just depend on how much Faith you have come here how high you can rise come on I'm almost done just give me a few more minutes see because we're talking about an image we're talking about that the image of Christ it's more than going to a message it's more than just believing brother is a prophet you've got to meet Jesus Christ listen when it comes to Faith that Romans told just said to Jesus just speak the word hallelujah God's word still prevails he is still the mighty conqueror Hallelujah is that right the Roman went out to meet Jesus and he said I'm not worthy that you would come under my roof I'm not worthy I don't count myself that way but said my son is very sick and you just speak the words my son will live what was it distance make no difference see because God is omnipresent God is omnipotent and everywhere God is omnipotent is there and God being omnip I'm the president that makes God everywhere God is just as great in Germany in Switzerland oh not mine down in streets Down in Africa right this minute as he is right here oh there you are God see faith has that we know that this dimensional dimensional we know that God is here he's not a million miles away he said I'm 90. I'm even in your mouth that's how close he is hallelujah God and when you got him on the inside you know he's there has nothing to do with feelings must be your foundation the only thing that you have to do is you speak the word he says now Faith doesn't rest now Faith does the rest of it that's Faith does the rest so you must have faith for foundations [Music] that's the reason I believe the world Hallelujah and when God speaks anything how many of y'all believe that when God speaks anything got to happen Hallelujah yes sir you'll never be able to agree upon the word of God you'll never do it you've got to be born again you got to be born again it produces Faith Hallelujah after you get Faith this right here [Music] y'all don't even understand blue let me let me use this because this is what the Lord just brought to my heart you'll see Moses and zephyrah and brother balham said they were both hot tempered uh that means they fussed and thought a lot and God and Jew told ID them to be married you mean to tell me I got a bad temper cause yeah and God would cause me to marry a woman that got a bad girl hallelujah hallelujah the reason being that is there is character to be developing he's your character builder but he calls people and you you are his character builder it was that was that song Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying God put you together on sharpening eyes but in order for it to work you both have so you both have to humble yourself to the will of God [Music] I bet he did come on yep Oh Happy Day that came right from the throne faith is the foundation Christianity but I'm going to tell you how to build your spirituality that's why I said you need to listen to the Statue of a perfect man where God can dwell he wants to dwell in you he wants to make you like himself he wants you to be reflected reflecting reflecting rather his being that's what you've been made for God created you to reflect his beings Hallelujah is this all right sometimes God gotta beat you like beating gold right sometimes the ham is constantly hitting you and you don't even understand what God is trying to get out of you he's trying to see his image the selfishness the malice that all of those things that you hold the empty The Strife in all of that must disappear until he gets his images foreign but I'm going to tell you how to build your house where God can dwell Hallelujah he wants to dwell in you he wants to make you like himself he wants you to be reflected or reflecting rather his being hallelujah hallelujah I got 15 more minutes before 12. that's all I want I'm gonna ask for you right I'll let you go at 12. is that okay thank you in the stats of a perfect man he said virtue if anyone knows what the word virtue means because the Bible tells us add to your faith virtue about you and faith in God's word as simple as it is that God's word is always right anyone knows what the word virtue means and we must have it if virtue went out from him to hear the woman that was sick he's expecting the same virtue in his church see that's what I'm talking about when the sick come to us hey you hear what I'm saying he expecting the same virtue in his picture because he was our example and if he had virtue to give to the people he's expecting us to have virtues and what is virtue virtue is strange and Power this is what the wise versions yeah amen introvert your virtue I I acknowledge so I'm hurrying up now God cannot lie during the performance and his word cannot fail that's knowledge to judge right from wrong and acknowledge that the word of God is right I cannot lie whatever God says he is able to perform foreign [Music] right Abraham and Sarah and Abraham believe them and when he was 100 years older the promise of God through unbelief God said you're going to have a baby Abraham didn't stagger five years he had the same testimony God said he was going to give me a baby y'all hear what I'm saying oh my it's not like some of us we get prayed for the flu news and it don't disappear all of a minute in a minute and we get we get all uh messed up in our minds prayed I pray is it create and maybe the medicine will heal me and productively come over that medicine can't hear you let me come on you're just psyching yourself God is the Healer how many times you've taken medicine and it really laughed at you hey didn't do nothing right see what but when you call on Jesus he comes to your rescue he's yeah listen I'm gonna move on because right right true knowledge from God you can't even have faith without God you don't have faith you ask of God and God will give it to you Jesus he wants you to have faith in him but when you can see the scriptures contradictory like Matthew 28 Acts 2 38. Hallelujah yes did you know that the baptism in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost basically an adulterous baptism man that wasn't God [Applause] hallelujah and if you're true you'll be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus I don't know who's going to be saved outside but I do know that the bride has a certain standard that she must secretly Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that you can see that that you know let me go on seeing the revelation of God the whole world is wrote in Mysteries only the knowledge of God Hallelujah [Music] oh man see God called Elijah and Elijah came to turn the hearts of the children back to the apostolic faith look what brother random says Christ sent me peace to heal individuals to the statue of Jesus Christ that they might be the PowerHouse and the dwelling place of the Spirit by his word by his words build up the individual to that place now you don't heard the message all these years but what preacher just brought this to your attention how many signs this is what you need to be working on amen what good is your shouting in your dancing gonna do y'all I say that because I enjoy shouting and dancing don't get me wrong but I know at the end of the day when I walk out of this place that's shouting and dancing I leave here and if I didn't get the word in my heart the devil is coming after me sometimes we eat before I even get out the door could you solve the same spot amen I can't finish this but um there's so much more I need to say one thing Faith doesn't reason yeah it's almost like Mary and mother name Lord we know at that Resurrection the dead is going to raise Jesus shut that down he says I am the resurrection if you believe you shall see but within their minds people man who's been dead for days brought it down now how can he live again they couldn't fathom it they couldn't imagine but Jesus basically saying I am God I am the resurrection so let me tell you something it's Jesus Christ let me ask you something it's Jesus Christ the word of God hallelujah where the word of God cannot lie hallelujah hallelujah and what did Mary and Martha name do they believe God and they saw a resurrection hallelujah what happened when the devil is to touch your body by the permission of God and you're laying on your bed like Joseph look like you're near death what was that Hallelujah did God do this Hallelujah God allowed it Hallelujah that he might be glorified Glory Hallelujah God can take a man all the way and then snatch him back Hallelujah if God said with his stripes I'm Healed I don't need to know the whole world and it just may not come when I want it but it will always be on time amen you got to learn how to trust the Bible said all your shouting and jumping up and down didn't do you any good the people see you right back in the same puzzle again that's right how many of y'all know that whether you respect reflecting when people know the people out there Hallelujah do they see you as an example they see you as a Christian do they see you that like someone that really loves us or do they see you as a hypocrite [Music] because this is what getting most of us temperance temperance Temperance does not mean stop drinking alcohol no no timbering doesn't mean alcohol cure not in this case this is Bible Temperance Holy Spirit Temperance that's just one of the lusts of the flesh that's just one of the lessons but we're talking about the holy spirit that means how to control your tongue alone not a calendar how to control your temper not fly off every time anybody speaks across to you thank you temperance well my dad [Music] [Applause] yeah it's hereditary well you better die tonight You Gotta Die to that inheritance you're so quick with the lip Who's That Pet Vet hmm amen yeah I don't care if you were born with that nature you got to get rid of that I don't remember you got to get rid of that we just made only Visa I ain't gonna let him talk to me like that comes up and you know you know us Brothers when our sisters get get a little up there you're like wow we be ready to put them checked what was that spray let me tell y'all something did not know that people in this message husband and wife thank you putting it to each other I know what I'm talking about it you think I'm lying I got but I'm just saying you know you said holy ghost and then you know the power of God and you you fussing and fighting what do you think your children are doing that I I remember when I came up in an atmosphere like that it makes you so nervous I can't hardly take it I don't like raised voices and all of that I can't do that unless I'm preaching but so but that comes I'm not picking on anybody no one particular person what I'm trying to say is those things must die bloody noses and all that kind of stuff foreign you know I'm laughing but it ain't fun the character must change I've never in the time my wife and I've been married have I ever struck her once and I told my wife she's sitting here as a witness and my father I told my wife the day I hit you will be the day I divorce you because I don't love you anymore don't you beat me and tell me you love me you are insane I'll tell you what man I wish I could hire a hit man for you I can't beat you but I can find somebody um no I'm talking from the natural now I can't stand that I can't stand it that gets really next to me I don't know foreign like I said I'm not picking on any particular person I'm preaching what God wants me to preach I'm trying to help and my thing is if those things be in you you know now by the word of God is things that you've got to get rid of it and that comes by faith and prayers controlling your tongue boy a lot of us this is what brother I'm saying boy a lot of us are going to fall off before we get started you know don't think you're the only one some people just know how to hide there yeah I remember seeing a sister come to church not here but I saw it with a black eye I wanted to ask her so bad how did you get that black guy I didn't want her to lie to me though anyway let's go home and you know I like Lord have mercy but let's move on see then we wonder why God is not in the church during Miracles and things that we used to do and it shows people because we can't keep our mouths even Shane who said that your religion is vain exactly right on your tongue is [Music] amen hallelujah hallelujah is that the way you want to be when you roll upon round not by let him be your example I can't preach the whole thing I said I was going to stop maybe I'll try to pick up on something and maybe a few of these quotes and something else but people of God y'all understand what I'm saying so I'm just saying these things happen all over but no matter how where it happened all of us need an overhaul [Music] we need we need to emptying out we need to die into ourselves and we need to love one another Hallelujah I just marvel at people you guys are grown-ups right how many of you can go out there being one of those trees out there it's past the point of bending and a lot of times we think when we get married we can make each other what we want them to be what about God wants you to be something hallelujah hallelujah and instead of trying to change each other we need to focus on ourselves that God can change and if God changed us he will change the situation amen you love the Lord I'm just trying to get us all saved you know when when we walk when we March through the Gates of Heaven I want to be able to look to the left and right see some of these familiar faces see I'm gonna make it I'm determined to make it and by God's grace he gave me that determination every day you got to die to yourself let's stand Everything You Must Die to yourself whenever you get out of line you ought to think about what you are reflecting am I expressing Jesus Christ in my behavior Hallelujah that's with everything everything dressed the way you act like the way you think the way you express yourself amen we want God to have preeminence in this Temple that one day we will be able to say excuse me [Music] I and the father are one and one in the family [Music] let's bow the word of Prayer our heavenly father I know I was quite lengthy here [Music] said a lot of things Lord but you're the judge of the heart you know my desires Lord is to help them not only that to help me here woman we're in this together Lord not trying to find fault in nobody but just trying to express the word of God lay before us Lord I don't want my living in vain everything that I do I want to be done unto you Lord inspired by you I want you to live through US Lord as your word promised forgive us of our sins forgive us of our shortcomings Lord we thank you right now for all that you've done for us in your name Jesus Christ please bless these people oh be used to bless us now Lord open our hearts and our minds we didn't come this far to be deceived we come this far to make a translation and we know Lord without faith it's impossible to please we don't want to come back with a bad report like the 10 spies came back and said we're not able to possess the land but father we're more than able even as the word of God came by Joshua Joshua say you will not worship but we responded nay we will worship we're going to worship Him in spirit and in truth we're going to continue to praise [Music] we're going to live it because you have given us Life to Live bless each and every heart this morning we ask these things in your lovely name Jesus
