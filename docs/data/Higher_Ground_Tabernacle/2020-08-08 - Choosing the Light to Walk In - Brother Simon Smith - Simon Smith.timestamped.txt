[53:12] if i didn't have the confidence
[53:16] abiding with me
[53:19] in this world of darkness and turmoil
[53:23] in this world where there is no future
[53:27] in this world where darkness seems to
[53:29] consume
[53:32] if i didn't have the lord jesus
[53:37] our brother sung that song i'll be
[53:39] somewhere listening
[53:42] that's one of my favorite
[53:46] because i'm always somewhere listening
[53:49] listening to hear his voice
[53:52] we have a brother who is a
[53:57] special friend of mine uh
[54:01] lord blessed he was converted

[54:46] by the grace of god
[54:50] simon in the sense that he is a
[54:51] witnesser
[54:54] he has witnessed to so many people and i
[54:56] know it's the lord because he loves the
[54:58] lord
[54:59] i don't want to take too much time but
[55:01] as our brother prepare here
[55:02] a way to come
[55:06] i told him he was the only man that i
[55:08] know of that i would
[55:09] proselyte if i could
[55:13] but i would never do that to my precious
[55:15] friend cam i wouldn't even try it that
[55:17] was just
[55:18] that's a thought of compliment to know
[55:21] that he is a blessing wherever he may be
[55:24] so i thank god for our brother simon we
[55:26] want to
[55:27] give him the liberty of this pulpit

[56:00] of the good lord

[56:24] if he had not hurt
[56:27] my feeble please

[57:01] lord
[57:03] i wouldn't be here today
[57:09] if he had not died on
[57:13] calvary if he
[57:16] had not heard my feeble plea

[58:19] so these are the saturn 8 warriors that
[58:22] have stepped out and
[58:25] left the beautiful sunshine and the
[58:27] beautiful day and
[58:30] have braved their way in from doing
[58:33] anything they wanted to do tonight
[58:36] to any kind of enjoyment went out to eat
[58:39] somewhere or just sat by the nice lakes
[58:42] you guys have here though they'd be
[58:44] i think some man-made maybe nice parks
[58:47] beautiful des moines you guys have
[58:50] chosen
[58:52] to be here so i pray to god that we can
[58:55] get out of the way
[58:56] for your sakes and
[59:00] i'm not a singer i have no gift like
[59:02] brother cam
[59:03] as far as singing about the old brother
[59:04] jesse so
[59:06] and i don't want to stumble the brethren
[59:07] tonight so we're just going to
[59:09] move on by the grace of god if you want
[59:11] to have your seats there we'll get into
[59:12] the word and
[59:16] that was if there's a song i would like
[59:18] to enter in
[59:19] to do a teaching that would be it
[59:21] because if it was not for the mercy
[59:24] of our lord and savior jesus christ we
[59:27] would be in some serious trouble right
[59:28] now
[59:29] and i would as
[59:32] maybe the the devils they would
[59:37] inflict somebody and you go to pray for
[59:39] them and they get cast out or even them
[59:41] devils would hear the name of jesus
[59:43] christ and the bible says they tremble
[59:45] even when the wick is unlike the the
[59:48] weakest christian
[59:49] speaks to a demon they tremble and you
[59:51] name the name of jesus christ
[59:52] they tremble
[59:55] and we want to be edifying and we are
[59:59] we know that god is uh in full control
[1:00:02] so
[1:00:03] uh let's read a couple of scriptures
[1:00:04] here by the grace of god and
[1:00:07] go to genesis 1 1 and and i'll introduce
[1:00:11] myself after we read the word here and
[1:00:20] genesis 1 1 and we'll read to
[1:00:26] verse
[1:00:29] we'll read to verse 3 in the beginning
[1:00:32] god created the heaven
[1:00:34] and the earth and the earth was without
[1:00:37] form and void and darkness was upon the
[1:00:39] face of the deep
[1:00:40] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[1:00:42] face of the waters
[1:00:43] and god said let there be light
[1:00:47] and there was light amen
[1:00:51] let's turn to first john uh i believe
[1:00:54] it's
[1:00:54] one here we got written yes first john
[1:00:56] 1.
[1:00:58] a real simple topic but we want to
[1:01:00] evaluate tonight
[1:01:02] where we be
[1:01:05] some of the most impacting services i've
[1:01:08] been to
[1:01:09] and sat through and gleaned from and ate
[1:01:12] and
[1:01:13] thought about and and the amend and was
[1:01:16] trying to
[1:01:16] really soak it in have been ones where
[1:01:18] we try to so refocusing service you know
[1:01:21] almost like a
[1:01:23] where am i what am i doing during the
[1:01:26] last week or so have i been
[1:01:27] in the faith have i been contending for
[1:01:29] the faith
[1:01:31] so anyhow i hope this will be a blessing
[1:01:35] in uh first john 1 and
[1:01:38] start at verse 5.
[1:01:42] now this then is the message
[1:01:46] which we have heard of him and declare
[1:01:49] unto you that god
[1:01:50] is light and in him
[1:01:53] is no darkness at all if we
[1:01:57] say that we have fellowship with him and
[1:01:59] walk in darkness
[1:02:01] we lie and do not the truth
[1:02:05] if we walk in darkness and
[1:02:08] we lie and do not the truth correct but
[1:02:11] if we walk
[1:02:12] in the light as he is in the light we
[1:02:15] have fellowship one
[1:02:17] with another and the blood of jesus
[1:02:18] christ his son cleanses

[1:03:33] you may have your seats uh
[1:03:38] uh like a real sobering introduction
[1:03:41] here from brother brooks but we
[1:03:43] appreciate him and he's been a
[1:03:47] he is a real man of god and
[1:03:50] he is not one that puts a face on he's
[1:03:52] not one that
[1:03:56] acts sanctified or or not like that
[1:04:01] he's he's real he's real he'll
[1:04:04] he he's a sincere um
[1:04:07] and i i'll be honest i told my wife as
[1:04:09] soon as i said you want to move to iowa
[1:04:13] and she gave me a look and uh yeah i
[1:04:16] didn't feel led to at that moment and
[1:04:18] everything but um
[1:04:20] god knows anyhow my name is brother
[1:04:22] simon smith we were
[1:04:24] just uh this isn't too loud
[1:04:27] we're just a little teacher i i i uh you
[1:04:30] know as
[1:04:31] i i'm relatively young in the ministry
[1:04:33] as far as um
[1:04:35] uh sad under brother brooks there
[1:04:38] brother craig for a season
[1:04:39] even my brother jesse and now i'm under
[1:04:41] my brother cam so
[1:04:42] as i've seen uh god raise them up as
[1:04:45] ministers and
[1:04:47] i'm trying to find a place everybody
[1:04:48] wants to find their position in christ
[1:04:51] we want to file lord what can you use me
[1:04:52] for i was reading a certain book
[1:04:54] the other day and and the man was
[1:04:56] breaking down
[1:04:59] who we are uh you know the bible says
[1:05:02] there was up that jesus christ after
[1:05:03] his resurrection was seen of 500.
[1:05:08] men of his resurrection and they were
[1:05:10] made witnesses
[1:05:12] but that's as far as god took them they
[1:05:15] were they were called to be witnesses
[1:05:17] and then he started working with the 70
[1:05:19] who he was called into the ministry and
[1:05:21] then
[1:05:21] they went out and they did the signs
[1:05:25] warner's and miracles and they had all
[1:05:26] those things and yet
[1:05:28] as the minister of the the messenger
[1:05:30] hour he came and said there was 70 left
[1:05:32] into john 6.
[1:05:34] but yet they were given a place their
[1:05:35] given position and then he was dealing
[1:05:37] then with
[1:05:37] um the 12 disciples and how
[1:05:41] god would choose 12 and they were called
[1:05:43] to the ministry they're called to do
[1:05:45] uh maybe greater things they had an
[1:05:47] opportunity to greater things and those
[1:05:48] sort of things and
[1:05:50] uh and then out of those 12 god would
[1:05:51] pick three handpick three
[1:05:53] faith hope and love and uh you see that
[1:05:56] and you can run the types of faith hope
[1:05:57] and love through peter james and john
[1:05:59] through the scripture
[1:06:00] and he even named renamed all three of
[1:06:02] them gave them new names
[1:06:04] from simon to peter and james and john
[1:06:06] to the sons of thunder
[1:06:08] but of those three he hand picked john
[1:06:11] alone
[1:06:12] the disciple was he would not even name
[1:06:14] himself in his own book that
[1:06:16] the disciple whom god loved jesus loved
[1:06:19] so
[1:06:20] and we want to become uh we want to make
[1:06:24] get to the culmination of what god would
[1:06:26] have us to do
[1:06:28] and uh anyhow so uh just a little
[1:06:31] teacher here
[1:06:32] in fact when i go to minister for
[1:06:33] brother jesse it's usually
[1:06:35] because he's busy or something happens
[1:06:36] or whatever and what i'm just like you
[1:06:38] get in your trunk and you pull out that
[1:06:40] spare tire okay
[1:06:42] but i'll take you 50 or 60 miles i might
[1:06:46] take a 70.
[1:06:47] we'll see so if you can just humble
[1:06:49] yourselves here tonight and just
[1:06:51] uh do your best there by the grace of
[1:06:53] god and
[1:06:54] i i and this is the last service i
[1:06:56] taught was at brother jesse's i believe
[1:06:58] and there's actually less than this and
[1:07:00] that's my size of crowd i said oh
[1:07:02] there's like five there and i was like
[1:07:03] ooh that's my people right there
[1:07:06] small groups amen i'm big on that
[1:07:08] scripture so wherever two or three are
[1:07:09] gathered there i mean that's
[1:07:10] that's my kind of church right there
[1:07:13] amen
[1:07:15] oh praise the lord so anyhow we want to
[1:07:18] uh
[1:07:18] maybe do a little study maybe tonight
[1:07:20] and and i hope this will be a blessing
[1:07:22] i'm gonna try and get out of the way uh
[1:07:24] and in fact most of my uh you know
[1:07:26] they're they're five-fold and i just
[1:07:28] really risk really i'll be honest i just
[1:07:29] consider myself a teacher
[1:07:31] uh i've been to thailand six times
[1:07:34] taught in the mountains of chiang mai
[1:07:36] to the akka tribes and went all over
[1:07:39] thailand
[1:07:41] saints of god let me tell you something
[1:07:47] if you stick with the word
[1:07:50] when i went to thailand do you think i
[1:07:51] used quotes
[1:07:54] i didn't use one but when you stick with
[1:07:57] the word i would teach things contrary
[1:07:59] to their
[1:07:59] pulpits i would teach things to what we
[1:08:01] would consider the truth as today
[1:08:03] and a lot of things you know as i've
[1:08:05] come into the message and hear these
[1:08:07] things into the word of god and
[1:08:09] these are new things these are strange
[1:08:11] things what to maybe to a near newer ear
[1:08:13] but every time that pastor that pastor
[1:08:15] would get behind
[1:08:16] the pulpit and they'd say saints of god
[1:08:19] and they'd speak in their native
[1:08:20] language they said
[1:08:21] and then through an interpreter i would
[1:08:22] know what they were saying they said
[1:08:24] i have i don't know what to say about
[1:08:26] this this and this he says but i cannot
[1:08:28] say anything against it because it came
[1:08:29] from the bible
[1:08:33] we had better know our word of god and
[1:08:36] we better be able to bring it through
[1:08:37] the word of god we better be able to
[1:08:39] teach it through the word of god and
[1:08:40] preach it through the word of god
[1:08:41] because the word of god
[1:08:43] is the absolute amen
[1:08:46] and my my last trip there i was uh
[1:08:49] teaching and
[1:08:50] uh bringing this and bringing that and
[1:08:52] finally me and the brother i go with
[1:08:54] brother ron downs
[1:08:54] a wonderful brother from um he's in
[1:08:57] kuwait now
[1:08:58] he moved there do you know
[1:09:01] many many years ago the time the message
[1:09:03] has sent ministers over to thailand
[1:09:06] and uh presented and introduced the
[1:09:09] prophet and
[1:09:09] introduced this and this and whatever
[1:09:11] and and the as we ministered to
[1:09:13] spoke with this one certain pastor there
[1:09:15] he said brother we've already heard
[1:09:17] about malachi 4. in fact after you've
[1:09:20] you
[1:09:20] guys have sent your saints and your
[1:09:22] evangelists and your uh
[1:09:24] your missionaries over here he says
[1:09:26] we've all had a group conversation we
[1:09:27] had a group meeting and we said we're
[1:09:29] not going to accept the teachings
[1:09:30] but we'll accept the testimonies and
[1:09:34] that's the condition right now
[1:09:36] we've sowed and sowed and sowed and
[1:09:38] sowed but the bible says
[1:09:40] as i like says the the word is not the
[1:09:43] gospel
[1:09:44] the word produces the gospel when it's
[1:09:46] accepted and it's made manifest
[1:09:49] the gospel is the holy ghost performing
[1:09:51] something in their lives but saints of
[1:09:53] god we have
[1:09:54] sowed and sowed and sowed as many other
[1:09:56] ministers have sown so
[1:09:57] as well so uh if i had to teach should
[1:10:02] be on
[1:10:03] choosing your light the bible says we're
[1:10:06] walking in the light as he is in the
[1:10:08] light and to do those things and to be
[1:10:09] that way and to
[1:10:10] that's where we find life right because
[1:10:12] in that light was life right but we must
[1:10:14] now
[1:10:14] choose the light
[1:10:18] because you know there's other lights
[1:10:20] out there
[1:10:22] so you have a choice tonight you have a
[1:10:24] choice from this day forward i have a
[1:10:25] choice every day and god help us and
[1:10:27] the bible says blessed is the man whom
[1:10:29] god will not impute iniquity and forgive
[1:10:32] us all transgressions
[1:10:33] and we are trusting in that and that
[1:10:35] alone by the grace of god amen sure
[1:10:37] so here i think you know in uh some
[1:10:40] studies i've taught and i've i've pulled
[1:10:42] from here from job 12 and verse 7.
[1:10:45] job 12 and verse 7 he says but ask now
[1:10:47] of the beasts he says and they
[1:10:49] shall teach thee and the fouls and the
[1:10:52] air and they
[1:10:52] shall teach thee or speak to the earth
[1:10:55] and it shall teach thee so all even
[1:10:58] to the ignorant to the fool to someone
[1:11:00] who doesn't know anything
[1:11:01] all we have to do is actually all we
[1:11:03] could do is learn
[1:11:04] from nature learn from animals learn
[1:11:08] from all that god has learned from
[1:11:09] creation and god will reveal to you
[1:11:12] what we're supposed to do and the bible
[1:11:16] says
[1:11:17] or speak to the earth i shall teach them
[1:11:19] the fishes of the sea and they shall
[1:11:20] declare unto me amen
[1:11:22] uh it says for who knows not in all and
[1:11:25] all these that the hand of the lord hath
[1:11:27] wrought this absolutely so
[1:11:28] so as we we know we must be able to
[1:11:30] harness from nature
[1:11:32] uh we have greater than that greater
[1:11:34] understanding that but for someone
[1:11:35] simple it's like this and i'm a simple
[1:11:37] man myself
[1:11:38] but for from someone somewhat many i
[1:11:40] learned many things out in nature
[1:11:42] one time i was out hunting and i'm not a
[1:11:44] hunter no no i'm not a hunter i've
[1:11:45] hunted maybe three times and i fell
[1:11:46] asleep in one of them and
[1:11:48] missed the dough and the the doe was
[1:11:49] looking at me when i woke up and i was
[1:11:50] ah the whole thing was blown all right
[1:11:51] and people were upset with me my other
[1:11:53] hunting companions were upset because i
[1:11:54] missed the dough and i was sleeping i
[1:11:56] was tired they wake up at 3 o'clock in
[1:11:57] the morning they just go hunting right
[1:11:58] so that's
[1:11:59] crazy so as i was in the woods one day
[1:12:01] and i was i was out hunting
[1:12:03] and i noticed that this big oak this
[1:12:05] huge tree had fallen
[1:12:07] and it was a dead tree and it's fallen
[1:12:09] down and it actually
[1:12:10] you know what it did it fell on a little
[1:12:12] tree and it was
[1:12:13] bending that little tree and that little
[1:12:15] tree would never be able to escape
[1:12:17] when that tree died and i thought about
[1:12:20] it i thought you know i and i always
[1:12:22] kind of distance myself and i'll be
[1:12:24] honest in the
[1:12:24] i'm just telling you in my heart today
[1:12:26] i'm being transparent i distanced myself
[1:12:28] from the older generation in the message
[1:12:30] because i know that if because the lord
[1:12:31] taught me right there watch out for the
[1:12:33] older generation because if they would
[1:12:35] fall from the word of god they'll try
[1:12:36] and take as many as with you
[1:12:38] so i've always distanced myself like
[1:12:40] that and and i'm not trying to
[1:12:42] say or suggest i'm just saying little
[1:12:44] things that god has taught me to learn
[1:12:46] and just shown and these kind of things
[1:12:48] amen
[1:12:49] so here also now here in proverbs 6 and
[1:12:51] verse 6 he says go to the ant thou
[1:12:53] sluggard considered her ways and be wise
[1:12:55] so here now the man of god
[1:12:57] solomon is saying he says go watch these
[1:13:00] ancestors because they work
[1:13:01] they toil if you want if you're lacking
[1:13:03] your bills go go work some more go get
[1:13:05] someone
[1:13:06] ask your boss for extra hours do those
[1:13:07] things but he said learn from the ant
[1:13:09] they never stop working amen
[1:13:11] sure we can learn these things he says
[1:13:13] he says and consider her ways
[1:13:15] and be wise god says from the very ants
[1:13:18] you can gain wisdom
[1:13:19] from nature something something so small
[1:13:22] that we step on
[1:13:23] they invade a house we kill them but we
[1:13:25] can learn from that little creature
[1:13:28] what it's god's creation because they
[1:13:30] carry a characteristic they carry an
[1:13:32] attribute about them a harder working
[1:13:34] characters they are storing up amen
[1:13:37] sure he said they don't have a guide he
[1:13:39] says overseer or ruler he says
[1:13:41] provide us her meat in the summer and
[1:13:43] gather her food in the harvest stay amen
[1:13:45] sure
[1:13:46] absolutely
[1:13:49] so if we're supposed to learn from
[1:13:51] nature
[1:13:54] you know as soon as that sun cracks
[1:13:56] through that hemisphere there
[1:13:57] and it breaks forth nature starts waking
[1:14:00] up
[1:14:01] that's when nature comes on the scene
[1:14:04] that's when nature starts
[1:14:06] oh it's a new day i'm hungry again i'm
[1:14:08] thirsty again we must start living this
[1:14:10] way or that way
[1:14:11] the lion will go hunting the lepers go
[1:14:14] hunting
[1:14:15] everything starts comes back to life
[1:14:17] i'll say like that
[1:14:20] so the light brings forth to life
[1:14:21] everything we know brings forth the life
[1:14:23] correct
[1:14:25] sure sure absolutely now i want to get
[1:14:28] into something here by the grace of god
[1:14:29] i don't know how long
[1:14:30] service will be here tonight but we want
[1:14:31] to uh just
[1:14:34] uh teach here the best we can in psalms
[1:14:37] 51 verse 5 this scripture
[1:14:39] behold i was shaping in iniquity and in
[1:14:42] sin did my mother conceive me right
[1:14:48] also in job 15 it says what is a man
[1:14:50] that he should be clean
[1:14:51] and he that is born of a woman that he
[1:14:53] should be righteous behold he put
[1:14:55] no trust in his saints
[1:14:58] he puts trust in himself and in his
[1:15:01] word amen
[1:15:05] god trusts himself
[1:15:09] the bible says cursed be the man that
[1:15:10] puts his trust in man
[1:15:12] but blessed are they that put it put
[1:15:14] their trust in the lord god almighty
[1:15:16] and i'm just paraphrasing one psalm 119.
[1:15:19] he said how much more abominal filthy is
[1:15:22] the man with strength iniquity like
[1:15:23] water how many of you have sinned every
[1:15:25] day
[1:15:26] i fall short every single
[1:15:29] day and i am checking up by the grace of
[1:15:31] god every hour every minute every half
[1:15:34] an hour that passed by
[1:15:35] as i'm at work i hear filthy this and
[1:15:37] filthy that and filthy that i'll say
[1:15:38] like this
[1:15:39] i was just at work last saturday on
[1:15:40] overtime and a man started talking about
[1:15:42] a certain
[1:15:43] uh restaurant establishment and there's
[1:15:45] another restaurant establishment around
[1:15:47] the same kind of thing
[1:15:49] and i know where they were going with it
[1:15:50] and i said have you guys ever eaten at
[1:15:52] so and so
[1:15:53] other place and this was not their kind
[1:15:55] of establishment
[1:15:57] and i said oh man the steak's phenomenal
[1:15:59] the macaroni cheese is amazing and the
[1:16:01] carrot cake and this and that and one
[1:16:02] guy called it he says how did we get
[1:16:04] from this
[1:16:04] to carrot cake i said i'm just trying to
[1:16:06] lead boys
[1:16:09] trying to change the atmosphere yes sir
[1:16:13] sure absolutely now as i would uh
[1:16:17] maybe i was listening on on in the
[1:16:20] message there the the prophet of god and
[1:16:22] i was listening and he was kept talking
[1:16:23] about
[1:16:24] these lights and he was talking about
[1:16:26] three kinds of lights and
[1:16:27] this and this and i started thinking and
[1:16:29] i thought wow three kinds of lights
[1:16:32] and i thought about it and you know
[1:16:33] there's actually four kinds of lights
[1:16:36] there's four there's four kinds of
[1:16:39] lights and saints of god
[1:16:41] if there are four kinds of lights what
[1:16:43] light are we walking in today
[1:16:46] what light are you walking in today
[1:16:48] because if we walk in the light we must
[1:16:49] choose
[1:16:50] which light and we must be specific
[1:16:52] there are other if there's
[1:16:53] if there is one real light then there
[1:16:55] must be other lights that are impostors
[1:16:57] or not as good as the original light
[1:16:59] right so we want to be able to break
[1:17:01] into this by the grace of god i know
[1:17:02] this might be simple but we're going to
[1:17:03] teach now
[1:17:04] now here in 64 19 to 64
[1:17:08] 1 and 25 he says now the prophet is
[1:17:10] speaking now i'm going to cover the
[1:17:11] fourth light the one that the one that
[1:17:13] god
[1:17:13] led me to to to hit kind of heavy okay
[1:17:16] because
[1:17:16] this light is a dangerous light
[1:17:20] now here's the prophet and the prophet's
[1:17:23] teaching all he is from turn on the
[1:17:24] light he says false light
[1:17:26] calls the greatest the greatest robbery
[1:17:28] the world has ever known right
[1:17:30] remember that remember that he said that
[1:17:31] story is talking about he says in
[1:17:32] england not long ago the greatest
[1:17:34] robbery that was ever performed was done
[1:17:35] by a
[1:17:36] false light seven million dollar robbery
[1:17:38] was done by a false light that slowed
[1:17:40] that train
[1:17:41] down right now he's hitting this this
[1:17:44] this robbery this great train robbery he
[1:17:46] says
[1:17:46] they got away with it scott and lars
[1:17:48] couldn't even find the man he says
[1:17:50] so slicky not bro he always said
[1:17:52] something a little bit different why is
[1:17:53] he
[1:17:53] so slicky that was that was known as the
[1:17:56] greatest robbery ever done by robbers
[1:17:58] in the natural
[1:18:03] it robbed the world of its gravest
[1:18:05] robbery
[1:18:07] and i was thinking about this that was
[1:18:09] now the man of god
[1:18:10] he picked that for a certain reason do
[1:18:13] you know when that do you know when that
[1:18:14] train robbery took place
[1:18:17] that train robbery took place in august
[1:18:20] 1963
[1:18:22] directly after the opening of the seals
[1:18:25] which what the opening seals what the
[1:18:27] revelation everything
[1:18:29] all of the earth was waiting for that
[1:18:31] right
[1:18:32] that the prophet of god called the most
[1:18:34] sublime thing the lamb coming up to take
[1:18:36] the book right
[1:18:37] and then as he broke the seals one by
[1:18:39] one by one and now we have the
[1:18:41] revelation of all these mysteries now
[1:18:43] what the book has been opened right and
[1:18:46] if the book is open we must be the most
[1:18:48] richest people on the face of the earth
[1:18:50] amen
[1:18:51] amen sure but notice directly after this
[1:18:53] the prophet i wonder if this is a type i
[1:18:55] wonder if this is a parable i wonder if
[1:18:57] this is a shadow that there would be a
[1:18:58] great
[1:18:59] robbery of the bride now this is
[1:19:02] directly after the seals october 8th
[1:19:06] i'm sorry it's august 8th today
[1:19:09] wow i guess i was supposed to teach this
[1:19:12] tonight
[1:19:14] it took place on august the 8th
[1:19:17] absolutely is today and here we declare
[1:19:21] the robbery is going on
[1:19:24] oh praise the lord that was this is for
[1:19:28] you
[1:19:28] now do you know the name of the train do
[1:19:30] you know the name of the train
[1:19:33] that was robbed the name of the train
[1:19:36] was called royal mail
[1:19:39] that was the name on the side of the
[1:19:40] train that was being robbed
[1:19:42] royal mail
[1:19:45] royalty and in it was the greatest
[1:19:50] riches as the prophet said was the
[1:19:53] greatest train robbery ever
[1:19:54] ever and saints of god from 63 what the
[1:19:57] prophet of god preached indictment
[1:19:59] indicting this generation from what
[1:20:00] crucifying christ the second time
[1:20:02] the denominations the world has rejected
[1:20:05] this message and satan what now
[1:20:07] is after every one of the members of the
[1:20:09] bride of jesus christ and he is trying
[1:20:11] to what steal
[1:20:12] away your revelation trying to steal
[1:20:13] away everything that god has revealed in
[1:20:15] this day
[1:20:16] one of the first as soon as i come out
[1:20:18] of the nomination i started going to
[1:20:20] brother brooks's church pastor brooks
[1:20:22] and i was invited to teach a little
[1:20:23] sunday school there
[1:20:24] uh brother craig was doing sunday
[1:20:26] schools every sunday morning
[1:20:28] and they said hi you wanna teach one i
[1:20:29] was like sure you know what i taught on
[1:20:30] the very first the very
[1:20:32] first teaching i ever had was called the
[1:20:34] bright heist
[1:20:36] on how satan was going to try and rob
[1:20:38] the revelation
[1:20:40] get you from not receiving the holy
[1:20:41] ghost and not having a victorious life
[1:20:44] and stealing all the promises of god
[1:20:48] and it looks to me like he's done a
[1:20:50] fairly well job
[1:20:54] now do you know the account of that
[1:20:57] august 8th
[1:20:58] unbelievable august 8th 1963 was when
[1:21:00] this took place
[1:21:04] the train passed through light and
[1:21:06] buzzard at about 3 a.m
[1:21:08] notice it was in the darkest time it was
[1:21:10] actually in the time as the prophet say
[1:21:12] he said 3 a.m he says go pray early that
[1:21:15] was the time when what we're supposed to
[1:21:17] be praying the most amen
[1:21:19] that was the time when what the spirit
[1:21:20] saw he said are resting out of the bars
[1:21:22] and this and taking a break and whatever
[1:21:24] and that's when we're supposed to wake
[1:21:25] up and pray and go seek the face of our
[1:21:27] god and that is the time when this
[1:21:29] took place on august 8 1963 and moments
[1:21:34] later the driver jack mills saw
[1:21:35] a red signal ahead at the place called
[1:21:38] sears crossing
[1:21:40] the signal was false a glove had been
[1:21:42] stopped something man
[1:21:44] made glove i wonder if it fit a false
[1:21:47] five-fold ministry he says the glove had
[1:21:50] been stopped stuffed into the proper
[1:21:52] signal
[1:21:53] and a red light was activated by
[1:21:55] attaching it to a
[1:21:56] six volt battery notice the numbers
[1:22:00] when mill stopped his co-driver david
[1:22:02] will whitby climbed out of the
[1:22:04] diesel engine to ring and signal the
[1:22:07] single man to
[1:22:08] ascertain the problem and then the rally
[1:22:10] took place place
[1:22:11] sorry so what am i saying the first
[1:22:15] light that we must watch out for is a
[1:22:17] false
[1:22:17] light
[1:22:22] but now you know how god views
[1:22:25] this false light
[1:22:28] in matthew 6 matthew 13 verse 24 he says
[1:22:32] another parable he put forth unto them
[1:22:33] saying the kingdom of heaven is likened
[1:22:34] unto a man which sowed good seed in his
[1:22:36] field
[1:22:37] he says but while men slept his enemy
[1:22:40] came and sowed
[1:22:40] tares among the wheat and went his way
[1:22:43] now we know that what the enemy that
[1:22:44] came was what the devil himself right
[1:22:46] but now as we move on and see now now
[1:22:49] here's one thing
[1:22:50] god vindicated me as far as showing me
[1:22:52] that i knew that this was the true
[1:22:54] word of god years and years and years
[1:22:56] and years and years ago when i was
[1:22:58] growing up young i had a dad
[1:23:01] he was somewhat spiritual and he had a
[1:23:03] dream one night and in his dream he said
[1:23:07] he saw a man in black
[1:23:09] and he said he was terrifying he just
[1:23:11] looked he looked dangerous he looked
[1:23:12] scary
[1:23:13] he said but he's looking at this man of
[1:23:14] black he said that there was sam and cam
[1:23:16] his two boys you know but my pastor
[1:23:17] broke him well he was
[1:23:20] he's there's twins sam and campbell over
[1:23:22] here and that man of black was
[1:23:23] looking at his boys and that man in
[1:23:26] black started running towards those boys
[1:23:29] and my dad said no and he started
[1:23:31] running to try and intercept that man in
[1:23:33] black
[1:23:34] and as the man in black seen my dad
[1:23:36] coming
[1:23:37] the man in black changed his desire to
[1:23:40] get them boys but then
[1:23:41] then he started running after my dad and
[1:23:43] my dad woke up shaking
[1:23:45] and he's been i'll say and i say here
[1:23:47] humbly revelly he's been running ever
[1:23:49] since
[1:23:50] but god's going to get him god will save
[1:23:52] him
[1:23:55] my dad had that dream in 19 and 82.
[1:23:59] but as dealing with back with matthew
[1:24:01] 13. he says now the prophet says in the
[1:24:03] programming
[1:24:04] program me and church age he says i
[1:24:06] closed my bible down laid it down
[1:24:08] meditated about meditated a while and
[1:24:09] prayed some more i still had no answer
[1:24:11] he's dealing with the man what the man
[1:24:13] was spoken tongues the man interpreted
[1:24:15] early on when he first was hearing about
[1:24:17] the pentecostal oneness he was dealing
[1:24:18] with those
[1:24:19] uh both were thus saith the lords right
[1:24:22] and then he
[1:24:22] and then he went and examined him by the
[1:24:24] gift and he said he said yes this man
[1:24:26] was a was a true
[1:24:27] christian and this one was a hypocrite
[1:24:28] right and now the prophet of god was
[1:24:30] dealing with this he says i closed my
[1:24:32] bible down
[1:24:32] laid it down meditated a while and
[1:24:34] prayed some more i still had no answer
[1:24:36] i again opened the bible aimlessly but
[1:24:38] did not turn the
[1:24:40] uh the pages turned to hebrews 6 to
[1:24:41] remain there as the wind ceased
[1:24:43] i read those words over again and what i
[1:24:45] did then came down the spirit of god
[1:24:47] into the room and i beheld a vision and
[1:24:50] i saw a vision of man dressed in the
[1:24:52] purest white who went forth into a flesh
[1:24:55] freshly plowed field and sold grain it
[1:24:57] was a bright day
[1:24:59] and the sewing was done in the morning
[1:25:00] but late after that night after the
[1:25:03] sower and white had gone he says a man
[1:25:05] in black showed up
[1:25:08] so who was that sore it was a man in
[1:25:11] black and god
[1:25:12] even though the bible says and we'll get
[1:25:14] to this here
[1:25:16] in ezekiel 28 7 dealing with what satan
[1:25:19] himself he says behold i therefore will
[1:25:22] bring strangers upon thee the terrible
[1:25:24] the nations and they shall draw their
[1:25:26] swords against the beauty of thy wisdom
[1:25:28] and defile thy
[1:25:29] brightness satan
[1:25:33] is a is a being of light lucifer means
[1:25:36] what
[1:25:37] something to do with light or right
[1:25:41] so he and the bible says thine heart has
[1:25:43] lifted up because of thy
[1:25:44] beauty and thou has corrupted thy wisdom
[1:25:46] by the reason of thy brightness
[1:25:48] he says i will cast it to the ground our
[1:25:50] lady before kings and they shall be holy
[1:25:52] so the very first light that we must i
[1:25:55] say this this one we must watch out for
[1:25:57] this is a
[1:25:58] false light right and this would be what
[1:26:00] satan himself
[1:26:01] the bible also says now that he makes
[1:26:04] his ministers as
[1:26:05] angels of light as well correct
[1:26:08] but now what kind of light are we
[1:26:09] talking about the bible in god's vision
[1:26:12] and
[1:26:12] even the prophet's vision he called him
[1:26:14] a man in black
[1:26:15] but let me let me read you something
[1:26:17] here from gil i love them
[1:26:19] old old man age kind of scholars and
[1:26:22] theologians right
[1:26:23] he says now he's dealing with satan he's
[1:26:25] dealing with that scripture as far as
[1:26:27] uh uh uh he would be like uh his make
[1:26:30] his ministers angels of light
[1:26:32] uh and righteousness and those sort of
[1:26:34] things he said his power can assume
[1:26:37] such as an aspect as he pleases he can
[1:26:40] disassemble
[1:26:41] and appear to be eminently pious
[1:26:46] we're talking about light he is the
[1:26:49] prince of duplicity
[1:26:52] as well as of wickedness he can be the
[1:26:55] sweetest
[1:26:56] man you'll ever meet on the face of the
[1:27:00] earth
[1:27:01] he will be the kindest humblest
[1:27:04] man you will ever meet on the face of
[1:27:06] the earth
[1:27:09] and it is the consummation of bad power
[1:27:11] for an individual to be able to assume
[1:27:13] that any
[1:27:14] to he can assume any character which he
[1:27:16] pleases
[1:27:17] his art he is long practiced for
[1:27:20] deceitful uh of in deceitful arts
[1:27:22] for six thousand years he has been
[1:27:24] practicing the art of delusion
[1:27:25] and in him it is perfected here we are
[1:27:29] not supposed
[1:27:30] to to uh we are not supposed that all
[1:27:32] that appears to be piety is
[1:27:34] piety
[1:27:37] some of the most plausible appearances
[1:27:40] of piety are assumed by satan
[1:27:42] and his ministers
[1:27:47] false light and yet the most religious
[1:27:50] among us no one ever possessed professed
[1:27:54] a profounder regard for the authority of
[1:27:56] god than
[1:27:57] satan did when he tempted the savior
[1:28:00] this
[1:28:00] devil satan himself was so pious and so
[1:28:03] religious
[1:28:04] he attempted to deceive god himself
[1:28:09] can you imagine the the mindset
[1:28:13] he had
[1:28:16] the audacity arrogance
[1:28:20] he thought he could deceive jesus christ
[1:28:24] the devil himself the culmination of
[1:28:28] all evil of all the evil the evil add
[1:28:30] all the evil together
[1:28:31] it's him
[1:28:35] he says and if the prince of wickedness
[1:28:37] can appear to be an angel of light
[1:28:39] we are not to be surprised if those who
[1:28:42] have the blackest hearts
[1:28:43] of beer appear to be the people of the
[1:28:45] most eminent
[1:28:46] piety amen
[1:28:50] as i heard a brother say i'll say it
[1:28:54] like this
[1:28:54] what is in these ranks i was like this
[1:28:57] in christianity
[1:29:00] when i was a heath in the world in
[1:29:01] college and doing this and this satan
[1:29:03] had me and he just played me and did
[1:29:04] whatever he wanted me to do right
[1:29:07] but as god started dealing with me and
[1:29:09] dealing with you
[1:29:11] satan was trying to throw every worldly
[1:29:13] thing in front of us to cut get us to
[1:29:14] come back right
[1:29:15] and that's his plan is trying to get you
[1:29:17] back in the world but i'll say it like
[1:29:18] this
[1:29:19] once god has settled in your hearts and
[1:29:22] he established you with faith
[1:29:24] you are now on the foundation of the
[1:29:26] word of god the son of jesus christ
[1:29:28] jesus christ right once you're on that
[1:29:30] foundation
[1:29:32] the world is not going to pull you back
[1:29:34] so he has one other option
[1:29:38] if now you are trying to live a clean
[1:29:40] religious life
[1:29:42] clean holy ghost-filled life all he can
[1:29:44] do you is
[1:29:45] push you now to be go from real
[1:29:48] christianity
[1:29:49] into religion that's his only move
[1:29:55] anyone anyone here want to go out to the
[1:29:56] to get to grab some
[1:29:58] to cigarettes or get some alcohol
[1:29:59] tonight no we have no desire for those
[1:30:01] things
[1:30:02] or to run around with this and run with
[1:30:03] it we have no desire but now now we must
[1:30:05] stay
[1:30:05] only on the word
[1:30:09] if i get a critical spirit and start
[1:30:10] nitpicking this and
[1:30:12] well i think well i don't know about
[1:30:13] that shirt or this these kind of pants
[1:30:15] or
[1:30:15] or this kind of shoes and whatever that
[1:30:17] is a religious demon
[1:30:20] anything outside of the divine love the
[1:30:23] holy ghost
[1:30:24] is a dangerous place to be in
[1:30:28] now what is piety what is the definition
[1:30:29] of priority piety
[1:30:31] devoted fully devoted to the word of god
[1:30:35] and that's satan's thing another one is
[1:30:37] faith full faith
[1:30:39] in what the word of god has and he is
[1:30:41] fully religious
[1:30:44] a dutifulness in religion
[1:30:48] it has become his life to be a christian
[1:30:52] and yet it can be an antichrist right
[1:30:54] there
[1:30:56] fully devoted to whatever he comes into
[1:30:58] denomination-wise or however
[1:31:00] even in this word that we have received
[1:31:02] if they're fully devoted
[1:31:04] we can't even trust uh say like this the
[1:31:06] piety of it
[1:31:08] he said we should be on guard we should
[1:31:10] not listen to suggestions
[1:31:12] merely because they appear to come from
[1:31:13] a pious man
[1:31:15] oh my why the bible says to trust to try
[1:31:18] every spirit by what by the word of god
[1:31:22] yes absolutely simple sure he says but
[1:31:24] nor because they seem to be promoted by
[1:31:26] the re
[1:31:27] uh sorry neither because they seem to be
[1:31:29] prompted by a regard to the will of god
[1:31:31] even if a man sees you out of this or
[1:31:33] that or if you made a mistake and this
[1:31:35] religious man comes up to you and says
[1:31:37] hey
[1:31:37] brother get back in the path and he
[1:31:40] actually
[1:31:41] is able to put you back on the right
[1:31:43] road
[1:31:44] we're still to
[1:31:48] be careful amen
[1:31:53] he says we are not to expect that satan
[1:31:55] will appear to man to be as bad as he is
[1:31:59] you're never going to see a satan at his
[1:32:00] best i'll say it like that
[1:32:02] i was like this is worse he says he will
[1:32:05] never show himself openly to be a spirit
[1:32:07] of pure
[1:32:08] wickedness he cloaks himself
[1:32:11] he covers himself just like our lord and
[1:32:13] savior
[1:32:15] yes he says or black or the above on his
[1:32:18] character or
[1:32:18] full of evil hatefulness he would thus
[1:32:22] defeat himself for it is for this reason
[1:32:24] that the wicked people do not believe
[1:32:25] there is such a being as satan
[1:32:27] though continually under his influence
[1:32:29] and led captivity by him that his
[1:32:32] his will yet they neither uh
[1:32:35] see him nor the chains which lead him
[1:32:37] nor they are able
[1:32:38] or nearly willing to believe in the
[1:32:40] existence of one or the other so here
[1:32:43] that would be your first late light to
[1:32:45] watch out for
[1:32:49] now satan
[1:32:52] antichrist is the false light
[1:32:57] there's three more lights we have to
[1:32:59] choose one
[1:33:01] we have to choose now remember the mark
[1:33:03] of the beast this thing the system
[1:33:05] setting up here
[1:33:06] is coming it's coming faster than we've
[1:33:09] ever imagined right now
[1:33:13] and there's coming today the bible says
[1:33:14] wherever great and small
[1:33:16] rich and poor we have to make a choice
[1:33:21] there is coming a false light that's
[1:33:24] great the greater
[1:33:25] the greatest false light ever to face
[1:33:27] the earth is coming
[1:33:30] and we must be able to discern it by the
[1:33:32] word of god
[1:33:34] now now that's we're dealing with that
[1:33:37] false
[1:33:37] that lost light i'll say like that now
[1:33:41] into our next slide hidden life 1960
[1:33:45] 1955 another thing we will call your
[1:33:48] attention
[1:33:49] just before we close look at the light
[1:33:52] on the outside
[1:33:53] in the courts this is for christians now
[1:33:56] we've come out of the world now we're
[1:33:58] entering the tabernacle
[1:34:00] we're entering in what to the house of
[1:34:01] god running into all those things
[1:34:04] he says look at the light on the outside
[1:34:06] in the courts
[1:34:09] because remember the tabernacle has
[1:34:10] three courts the outer court
[1:34:13] the inner court and the holy spolis he
[1:34:16] says it was
[1:34:16] it was the firmament that littered up it
[1:34:19] was the very s-u-n we see rise every day
[1:34:22] that's what light they were living in in
[1:34:24] the outer courts getting repenting
[1:34:27] you're still living what under the
[1:34:29] natural lights
[1:34:32] you know that sun that that's in there
[1:34:34] i'll record it it goes down
[1:34:37] and after the sun goes down it gets dark
[1:34:41] and it's a little bit hard to see what's
[1:34:43] going on around you in the world and all
[1:34:45] those things
[1:34:46] it's a little bit tougher
[1:34:50] it was the firmament that littered up
[1:34:52] sunshine and so forth some days it was
[1:34:54] cloudy some days the sun didn't shine at
[1:34:58] all
[1:35:00] some days it was dark now that's the
[1:35:02] outer court
[1:35:04] he says now there are three courts the
[1:35:05] justified man out there he walked by
[1:35:08] daylight by natural
[1:35:11] natural man naturalness natural head
[1:35:14] always worried about this worry about
[1:35:15] that worry about this this this this
[1:35:17] your entire mind is on the natural
[1:35:22] and tomorrow i'm going to share a
[1:35:23] scripture by the grace of god if that's
[1:35:25] the way we go
[1:35:26] on winning how many souls have we won
[1:35:33] we're trying to up up and up up in ohio
[1:35:36] we're trying to i've been doing two
[1:35:38] two one to two bible studies every week
[1:35:40] with new people just trying to sow seed
[1:35:42] sow seed
[1:35:42] and we're hoping and praying it hits
[1:35:44] good ground
[1:35:47] amen he says some days he has gloomy
[1:35:50] days you get it oh i hope you see this
[1:35:52] some days are gloomy
[1:35:54] if we're living in the outer courts
[1:35:56] you're going to have
[1:35:57] those days but i'm just going to finish
[1:36:01] this
[1:36:01] some days you don't know whether it's
[1:36:03] even worth to serve god or
[1:36:05] not
[1:36:08] you're walking in the outer court sure
[1:36:10] you're eating manna
[1:36:13] exactly what god has provided for this
[1:36:16] day man amen
[1:36:17] what was it was it 65 or 63 he says
[1:36:20] we're storing up what food
[1:36:23] we're storing up things that what they
[1:36:25] can eat later on down the road what the
[1:36:27] profit is gone 77 is gone
[1:36:29] we're further down the road and we're
[1:36:30] still eating from the word of god
[1:36:33] let me throw you a little nugget i think
[1:36:35] the lord showed me something
[1:36:37] when you get spiritually hungry what do
[1:36:38] you eat
[1:36:41] the word right you ever think about
[1:36:44] those
[1:36:44] joseph and the two sevens
[1:36:49] seven years of plenty and seven years of
[1:36:52] drought
[1:36:54] you know seven always breaks down to the
[1:36:57] church ages
[1:37:01] when we get hungry we read this
[1:37:02] spiritually spiritually hungry say man i
[1:37:04] need something i need something
[1:37:07] when was this bible given this bible was
[1:37:09] given in the first
[1:37:11] old testament church ages
[1:37:15] and the gentiles in the time of drought
[1:37:17] where there be no more words added
[1:37:20] no more wheat seed no more word seed
[1:37:23] added at all
[1:37:26] and what do we have to eat we have to go
[1:37:28] back to joseph's storehouse
[1:37:30] and eat constantly
[1:37:33] i hope that was uh that was i i taught
[1:37:34] that a little bit ago but to me that was
[1:37:36] good
[1:37:37] we're still eating from the seven years
[1:37:39] of plenty
[1:37:41] amen but remember it was in the time of
[1:37:44] the when
[1:37:44] in the time when there was a drought
[1:37:47] would there be no food
[1:37:48] we'd have to eat from what this age
[1:37:49] that's when the money would
[1:37:51] fail and if you study how
[1:37:54] i'll say like they're they're they're
[1:37:56] off god's playbook
[1:37:58] if you study how joseph bought all the
[1:38:01] people for pharaoh
[1:38:02] if you study and look every year they
[1:38:05] had to sell out more
[1:38:07] every year they had to give more until
[1:38:09] they finally sold
[1:38:10] themselves satan is doing the exact same
[1:38:14] thing
[1:38:17] he says now three quarts he says he says
[1:38:20] sure you're eating manna
[1:38:21] sure you're a believer he says you're a
[1:38:23] believer
[1:38:24] he says sure you have eternal life look
[1:38:26] this person
[1:38:27] has won all through the all the way to
[1:38:29] the courts went in and received the
[1:38:31] baptism of the holy ghost but he chose
[1:38:33] not to stay and he
[1:38:34] went out he went back he did not go back
[1:38:37] on the world
[1:38:39] he stayed in church but he's living a
[1:38:41] totally defeated life a life
[1:38:45] where they're up and down woe this and
[1:38:47] woe that
[1:38:48] and scared of this let me tell you
[1:38:49] something you don't have to fear this
[1:38:51] corona
[1:38:52] thing
[1:38:55] our pastor's been doing a series on
[1:38:57] divine healing
[1:38:59] if i come over to this brother and this
[1:39:01] sister's house
[1:39:02] and i start cutting up and starting
[1:39:05] doing confusion and all this and that
[1:39:07] and saying this and say that
[1:39:08] all that brother has to say brother
[1:39:11] simon would you please
[1:39:13] leave
[1:39:16] corona is just a scientific name for a
[1:39:19] demon
[1:39:21] it is a demon and all you have to say
[1:39:26] is because remember that light
[1:39:27] whatever's in them that mass or whatever
[1:39:29] happens to your body at the time of the
[1:39:30] cronus
[1:39:32] has a life in it and you must speak to
[1:39:35] that life because that life is a person
[1:39:37] it's a spirit
[1:39:38] and you just tell that spirit i i rebuke
[1:39:42] this
[1:39:43] life in the name of jesus christ that
[1:39:45] life has to leave that person
[1:39:47] has to leave god is a person one person
[1:39:50] right
[1:39:51] and so is the devil and you must speak
[1:39:53] to that person and it will leave
[1:39:57] simply i know it's simple you've heard a
[1:39:58] million times but it's refreshing don't
[1:40:01] be scared of any of these demons
[1:40:03] we're in full control now remember what
[1:40:05] if i was a really really timid guy and i
[1:40:07] was messing over this brother's house
[1:40:08] and
[1:40:08] he tells me to go i'm gone but what if i
[1:40:12] was a little hard-headed
[1:40:13] and he had to continually say simon you
[1:40:15] got to go i was like i'm not going
[1:40:17] you got to go and finally he's going to
[1:40:19] wear me out
[1:40:20] and i'm going to have to go once i see i
[1:40:23] cannot get any hold here
[1:40:25] i'm going to go
[1:40:29] amen is that simple hold to your faith
[1:40:33] apply the simple hyssop of faith amen
[1:40:37] he says sure you're a believer sure you
[1:40:38] have eternal life sure if you died you'd
[1:40:40] go to heaven he says
[1:40:42] but what kind of life are you living
[1:40:46] he says every day oh i get out there oh
[1:40:48] i had dandruff
[1:40:49] i got my dandruff up today he said i
[1:40:51] told them about it i cussed them out oh
[1:40:53] god forgive me
[1:40:55] he says sure he will sure he will you're
[1:40:57] his child but what kind of
[1:40:59] life are you living my don't you hate to
[1:41:01] live that kind of life the ups
[1:41:03] and downs and troubles and polls and
[1:41:05] days and nights
[1:41:06] backslidden back to church spaxton
[1:41:10] back to church that that's apologize
[1:41:12] over these i'm not going to apologize
[1:41:13] for that
[1:41:14] they're going to church backstage come
[1:41:16] to church come back to church this and
[1:41:17] that
[1:41:18] that's that may that may be a holy ghost
[1:41:19] filled believer but they're living in
[1:41:21] the outer courts
[1:41:23] simple he says and this other fellow is
[1:41:26] just blooming right along
[1:41:27] not a thing show
[1:41:32] that's all depends how you keep your
[1:41:33] garden remember the four types of ground
[1:41:36] matthew 13 how good a gardener or farmer
[1:41:39] are you
[1:41:40] because of all everything because we've
[1:41:42] all eaten the same word
[1:41:44] same same scriptures same sermons we've
[1:41:46] pulled from the prophet
[1:41:48] but how do you keep your what the ground
[1:41:50] of your heart
[1:41:52] if you keep the very ground of your
[1:41:54] heart you'll see in the 30s the 60s and
[1:41:56] the 100 folds
[1:41:57] absolutely that's true yeah he says now
[1:42:01] what kind of life are you walking
[1:42:02] according to the weather
[1:42:04] give the outs the light outside the
[1:42:06] gloomy the foggy
[1:42:10] for a brief second i was scared of the
[1:42:12] cronus
[1:42:14] and i used the word coronas because
[1:42:15] that's where the guys at work they mock
[1:42:17] it
[1:42:17] [Laughter]
[1:42:20] they said hey no cronies they call it
[1:42:22] cronies actually
[1:42:23] hey you got the crow every time somebody
[1:42:24] coughs they're like crowning is that the
[1:42:26] crown
[1:42:26] you know they're they're not scared of
[1:42:28] it they said sigh i don't care
[1:42:30] i'm going to work and i don't want to
[1:42:31] wear a mask and this and that and they
[1:42:33] these guys just don't they're not scared
[1:42:34] of it at all
[1:42:36] they have no fear and yet heathen
[1:42:40] what is that lack of fear they have
[1:42:42] faith he
[1:42:44] then they mock the devil
[1:42:47] [Laughter]
[1:42:49] they mock the demons oh my
[1:42:55] and i pulled from that a little bit
[1:43:00] back to church maxlin back to church
[1:43:02] baxlin he says and yeah he said this
[1:43:04] other fellow just blooming right along
[1:43:09] what kind of life are we walking in
[1:43:11] according to the weather it's going to
[1:43:12] be light outside the gloomy the foggy
[1:43:14] the halfway then there's the bright day
[1:43:16] the gloomy day the foggy day the cloud
[1:43:18] over the sun that's the way the
[1:43:19] regenerated man lives today that's right
[1:43:20] that's right
[1:43:21] the light he has to walk in but then he
[1:43:23] says when he's just walking by that
[1:43:28] we have to believe that god is in full
[1:43:30] control every bill
[1:43:32] every situation in your life these young
[1:43:35] brothers here
[1:43:36] i know when i was probably maybe your
[1:43:38] age like a smaller
[1:43:40] a thing i'll say this a thing would hit
[1:43:41] my life and it would be just
[1:43:43] huge to me a little thing like this man
[1:43:46] it was like
[1:43:46] my entire life stopped because of this
[1:43:48] one situation
[1:43:50] but don't worry god's in full control
[1:43:53] now i deal with it every day
[1:43:56] and you know what it you know what we're
[1:43:58] still here
[1:44:00] god has provided every meal god has paid
[1:44:02] every bill god has done every single
[1:44:03] thing he's saved me so many times amen
[1:44:06] save my life absolutely
[1:44:11] and i'm not you know a minister like
[1:44:15] brother brooks
[1:44:16] i had to fly to thailand one time not
[1:44:18] even knowing who i was meeting
[1:44:20] by myself i was terrified
[1:44:25] and you know what guess who found who i
[1:44:27] found that guy he i walked right past
[1:44:29] him i'm looking at his picture on my
[1:44:31] phone
[1:44:31] and i'm like man i think it's a guy and
[1:44:33] he's just
[1:44:35] he's like looking for me smiled and he's
[1:44:37] like
[1:44:38] the only white guy here
[1:44:42] he has my picture i sent it to him and
[1:44:43] he's just uh
[1:44:45] i just walked right past him i'm like
[1:44:47] pretty sure that's the guy and i just
[1:44:48] waited and i sat down in the
[1:44:50] airport i'm like man i'm looking around
[1:44:52] i'm like i'm pretty sure that's the guy
[1:44:54] i i think that's the guy and i waited
[1:44:56] about half an hour and finally i just
[1:44:57] went up
[1:44:58] hello oh brother simon i'm like i just
[1:45:00] walked past you three times
[1:45:03] what was i gonna do stuck in thailand
[1:45:05] for three two weeks
[1:45:07] but we go by faith we go by the leading
[1:45:09] lord i said lord you want me to go he
[1:45:10] said go i said praise the lord
[1:45:14] sure now obviously the next light
[1:45:18] the next court was the lamp of god where
[1:45:21] the
[1:45:21] the justified stand and it was lit by
[1:45:24] human hands
[1:45:28] that's where we argue our denominations
[1:45:30] where we argue our differences
[1:45:32] and split hairs if we see this brother
[1:45:35] this sister blah blah blah
[1:45:37] and yet they're and yet they're
[1:45:38] christian what life
[1:45:40] are they living where are they living
[1:45:43] their life
[1:45:44] he says oh i don't believe in divine
[1:45:46] healing i don't believe in the visions
[1:45:47] from god i don't believe this i don't
[1:45:48] believe that
[1:45:49] you're arguing because you're living
[1:45:50] you're eating manna now remember
[1:45:53] that was the 12 shoe breasts right there
[1:45:56] on the
[1:45:57] altar of uh of shoe bread right there's
[1:46:00] 12 of them and they were eating what
[1:46:01] were those
[1:46:02] represented those are the 12 new
[1:46:04] testament mysteries
[1:46:06] they're eating all the mysteries of god
[1:46:09] studying them
[1:46:10] eating them listening to them learning
[1:46:12] showing exactly
[1:46:13] actually just just pulling from the word
[1:46:15] of god
[1:46:18] and yet that's where the argument takes
[1:46:20] place
[1:46:22] he says you're arguing because you're
[1:46:23] living you're eating manna but you're
[1:46:24] living under an
[1:46:25] artificial light he said that's right
[1:46:29] sometimes the light goes
[1:46:30] out sometimes your lamp gets smoked up
[1:46:37] but to he who desires to walk away walk
[1:46:39] into the next place there's no
[1:46:40] artificial light
[1:46:42] anywhere he says well you want to go a
[1:46:45] little bit deeper well
[1:46:46] he comes to into that court now where is
[1:46:48] in there there is seven golden
[1:46:50] candlesticks by the holy place and it's
[1:46:52] giving light
[1:46:53] the candlesticks are giving light that's
[1:46:55] to the man who quits his drinking is
[1:46:57] smoking lying
[1:46:58] quit stealing his neighbors uh this and
[1:47:00] that being good to his wife and being
[1:47:02] good to their husband the same way
[1:47:04] man or woman the believer he has to come
[1:47:06] into a place where he's quit
[1:47:07] all his meanness
[1:47:11] that is through the blood sanctification
[1:47:13] he is called to a new life he walks in
[1:47:15] there
[1:47:16] but he don't have to walk by the light
[1:47:17] out there he's got a better light he's
[1:47:19] walking by the light of some golden
[1:47:21] candlesticks
[1:47:21] the burning olive oil right sure
[1:47:25] and the olive oil represented what the
[1:47:27] holy ghost
[1:47:29] he says the fire was the baptism he says
[1:47:31] you can be baptized in there or get the
[1:47:32] holy ghost but you're not hidden away
[1:47:34] yet he says he says you're not behind
[1:47:37] the veil here you are he's
[1:47:38] walking in the seven golden candlesticks
[1:47:40] there is many light or much light there
[1:47:42] but there's days when that light get
[1:47:44] dull
[1:47:46] and it's still because remember outside
[1:47:48] you had the s-u-n
[1:47:49] all day and then the moon and the stars
[1:47:51] and all those sorts of things but once
[1:47:52] you get in there that's covered in the
[1:47:53] top
[1:47:54] covered here covered here you're
[1:47:55] surrounded by
[1:47:57] uh curtains right
[1:48:01] and the only thing lighting that was
[1:48:02] those lamps
[1:48:05] he says there is light or much light
[1:48:07] there but those these but there's days
[1:48:09] when them
[1:48:09] the lights get dull there's days when
[1:48:11] them lamps smoke and the light is not so
[1:48:14] good there's times when them lights have
[1:48:15] to be re-lit
[1:48:17] again
[1:48:20] here i've been here a lot
[1:48:24] in my life sometimes you've got to go to
[1:48:27] a revival service sometimes you gotta
[1:48:28] get in there and pray until you break
[1:48:30] through sometimes you got to do
[1:48:31] something
[1:48:32] to get the presence of god back on you
[1:48:35] amen
[1:48:36] he says he says and sometimes you have
[1:48:38] to borrow a little from your neighbor to
[1:48:39] light another candle to one another
[1:48:42] there are many times when i first come
[1:48:45] on the message
[1:48:46] where i had to hang out with brother
[1:48:48] brooks because i was feeling awfully low
[1:48:50] [Laughter]
[1:48:52] or i thought or or i saw this problem i
[1:48:54] saw that problem i said
[1:48:56] brother brooks hey brother and i had to
[1:48:58] pull from his
[1:48:59] light i had to pull to what relight mine
[1:49:01] and get myself refocused and i'll be
[1:49:03] honest that's
[1:49:04] that's sometimes what we had to do in
[1:49:06] the inner court
[1:49:08] sometimes what we need each other we
[1:49:10] need god in flesh
[1:49:11] amen and it's not a bad place to be it
[1:49:14] really isn't it's a good place to be
[1:49:15] amen
[1:49:17] because while we're still in the house
[1:49:18] of god
[1:49:20] yeah sure that's the importance of the
[1:49:24] of the body because we're all not at the
[1:49:26] same level
[1:49:31] every time i do a bible study with
[1:49:32] someone new like the one i'm doing right
[1:49:34] now
[1:49:34] sister has pants smokes i see her as the
[1:49:38] bride of christ
[1:49:40] and i teach just as serious as i can
[1:49:43] because remember this is ten thousand
[1:49:45] worlds in front of me
[1:49:47] and i must purdue the very best
[1:49:49] presentation to the word of god that i
[1:49:50] can
[1:49:52] because i will be accountable if i do
[1:49:54] not treat this as gold
[1:49:57] because everyone we meet is a potential
[1:49:59] safe that could be
[1:50:00] brought
[1:50:05] i always i told the lord i said whatever
[1:50:06] you want me to do just open the door
[1:50:09] this bible study comes in this bible
[1:50:10] well brother you're just a bible study
[1:50:11] guy but that's what i'm called to do
[1:50:14] that's what he wants me to do here we
[1:50:17] are
[1:50:18] bible study this table top teacher
[1:50:21] just on the kitchen run in scripture run
[1:50:23] a scripture run scripture show me
[1:50:25] that's what i do
[1:50:30] he says and there's days when the lights
[1:50:31] gets dull there's days when the lamp
[1:50:33] smoke and the light is not so good he
[1:50:35] says
[1:50:36] he says oh he says and we have to borrow
[1:50:37] them from the neighbor to light one
[1:50:39] candle to the other
[1:50:40] it's it's still not a good light but
[1:50:42] we're thankful for it but it's still not
[1:50:44] the right light
[1:50:44] oh brother it's still not the right
[1:50:50] light
[1:50:57] let me jump here
[1:51:02] you know where we're at today in matthew
[1:51:03] 13 22.
[1:51:06] dealing the four kinds of grounds he
[1:51:08] that receiveth seed among the thorns is
[1:51:10] he that heareth the word
[1:51:13] and the care of this world and the
[1:51:16] deceitfulness of riches
[1:51:18] how many got their chrono bailouts today
[1:51:20] or this weird
[1:51:22] the deceitfulness of riches choke the
[1:51:25] word and it becomes
[1:51:26] unfruitful let me tell you something
[1:51:30] i just i told your pastor brother brooks
[1:51:34] this testimony my pastor brother cam
[1:51:35] still works
[1:51:37] and he works for a big company uh a big
[1:51:40] pipe fitting outfit in toledo ohio
[1:51:43] and they have some of the best
[1:51:44] pipefitters his company has very good
[1:51:46] pipefitters my brother cam now he's a
[1:51:48] good fitter
[1:51:49] you can lay out walls and hit this and
[1:51:50] hit that you can master welder tig
[1:51:52] you name it you can you can weld it
[1:51:55] and we got slow this last because the
[1:51:57] chrono thing
[1:51:59] and they let 30 of their steadies guys
[1:52:02] who've worked them for 20 years
[1:52:04] sit and collect unappointment
[1:52:07] brother cam's like cam doesn't even have
[1:52:09] a truck he doesn't run work
[1:52:12] my pastor and one day they revealed to
[1:52:15] him said you know brother he said cam uh
[1:52:17] you know why we keep you around
[1:52:19] he said you're a great worker you can
[1:52:21] weld anything you never complain if we
[1:52:23] throw you in the
[1:52:24] the the grease pits under uh sdi or
[1:52:27] or or or northstar blue
[1:52:30] blue scope or whatever where they make
[1:52:32] the steel and run it and there's grease
[1:52:34] pits and he
[1:52:34] jumps right in there cleans everything
[1:52:36] off starts welding the grease you're
[1:52:37] completely
[1:52:38] he said you know why we keep around he
[1:52:41] said because when you're here
[1:52:43] there's a different atmosphere on the
[1:52:44] job site he goes and everyone knows it
[1:52:51] there's a different atmosphere on the
[1:52:54] job site
[1:52:56] and they know it he says and when you're
[1:52:59] not here
[1:53:00] the people know it
[1:53:04] i wonder where brother cam's living
[1:53:10] that is a testimony lord god
[1:53:14] help me to produce that yes
[1:53:17] amen now of course we know the holiest
[1:53:19] of holies
[1:53:22] i want to throw this in here by the
[1:53:23] grace of god i'm just going to let this
[1:53:25] out for the books here pastor here
[1:53:27] in hebrews 9 and verse 3 actually nine
[1:53:30] verse one
[1:53:30] and through six now the the prophet of
[1:53:33] god paul was looking at he's
[1:53:34] he's looking at sanctuary he's looking
[1:53:36] at this looking at that
[1:53:37] and he says he said that uh verse one
[1:53:39] then verily the first covenant
[1:53:41] also had also ordinances divine service
[1:53:44] and
[1:53:44] uh a worldly sanctuary for there was a
[1:53:46] tabernacle made at first there was the
[1:53:48] candlestick in the table in the shoe
[1:53:49] bread which is called the sanctuary
[1:53:51] after the
[1:53:52] and after the second bay bale the
[1:53:53] tabernacle which is called the holiest
[1:53:54] of all
[1:53:56] which had the golden censor and the ark
[1:53:58] of the covenant overlaid
[1:53:59] round about the gold wearing was the
[1:54:01] golden pot and that manna
[1:54:02] and aaron's rod that butted in the
[1:54:04] tables of covenant
[1:54:06] and over it the cherubims of glory
[1:54:10] shadowing the mercy seat of which we
[1:54:13] cannot now
[1:54:14] speak particularly he did not reveal
[1:54:18] what that represented and this is uh
[1:54:21] for all you uh soldiers
[1:54:25] look what the prophet of god says here
[1:54:27] in 56 junction of time
[1:54:29] he says and god that dwelt under the
[1:54:31] interlocking
[1:54:32] wings interlocking wings of the cherubim
[1:54:35] may it come
[1:54:36] under the interlocking wings he says
[1:54:38] arms of the cross
[1:54:41] and i wonder when we get into the
[1:54:45] holiest of holies
[1:54:48] you know it's not jesus christ plus
[1:54:50] brother branham
[1:54:53] when jesus christ in revelations 1 had
[1:54:55] all 27 stars in his right hand
[1:54:58] did did he make mention one star was
[1:55:00] greater than the other or this star
[1:55:01] shine more he said he had seven stars in
[1:55:03] his hand
[1:55:04] in his hand
[1:55:09] it's never jesus christ plus
[1:55:13] in galatians oh foolish galatians who
[1:55:15] has bewitched you
[1:55:16] you know what they added they added
[1:55:18] jesus christ plus works
[1:55:20] jesus christ plus law it's
[1:55:23] only jesus christ
[1:55:27] and when we enter in there into that
[1:55:30] place
[1:55:31] it must be reverence it must be holy we
[1:55:35] must bring the blood of god
[1:55:38] and that's it it's not look
[1:55:42] look at job job the bible said job lived
[1:55:45] the perfect life
[1:55:48] very clean cut
[1:55:52] and then when satan brought those
[1:55:54] plagues by god's permission
[1:55:56] and those men started railing job
[1:55:58] railing joe railing job job said i
[1:56:00] wish there was a book written about me
[1:56:03] of all my faults
[1:56:04] he said i take that book and i throw on
[1:56:06] my back and i walk up and talk with god
[1:56:07] about it
[1:56:08] because he knew he lived that clean and
[1:56:11] you know what
[1:56:12] that wasn't it
[1:56:15] allah who came god came said you live a
[1:56:19] clean life but that has nothing to do
[1:56:20] with it
[1:56:24] it is the blood of jesus christ
[1:56:27] it is how he lived it is what he did on
[1:56:30] calvary it is his blood that was shed
[1:56:32] amen it was the blood of god
[1:56:36] praise god and he calls that
[1:56:39] witchcraft adding anything jesus christ
[1:56:42] plus
[1:56:43] witchcraft
[1:56:47] it is only jesus christ there's only
[1:56:50] one way
[1:56:54] absolutely anyhow pray on that study on
[1:56:57] that
[1:56:59] are those interlocking wings of the
[1:57:00] cross that's just what he said
[1:57:03] anyhow let's stand here by the grace of
[1:57:06] god let's stand
[1:57:08] in the holiest of holies
[1:57:13] but down in between the arch of the
[1:57:14] wings of these cherubim was the
[1:57:16] supernatural light
[1:57:17] hanging in there which was the halo of
[1:57:19] god that lit
[1:57:20] the whole room this was not
[1:57:24] natural light this was not candlestick
[1:57:26] light but the bible says
[1:57:27] god is light
[1:57:32] walking in the light and now let me give
[1:57:34] you a testimony that happened to me
[1:57:36] there was a certain situation in the
[1:57:37] church i had and i
[1:57:40] i was the first one to saw it and it
[1:57:42] plugged me for a year
[1:57:45] and it drove me to i was just ready to
[1:57:47] have a nervous breakdown because i
[1:57:50] something somebody called me and said
[1:57:52] this and revealed it and this and that
[1:57:54] and i started waking up at 3am every
[1:57:56] morning for almost a month and a half
[1:57:58] and i started praying at 3am because
[1:58:00] that the prophet said
[1:58:01] go he says go then go through go then at
[1:58:05] three
[1:58:06] after a month and a half i had dealt
[1:58:07] with the situation it was very very hard
[1:58:09] i'm not captain
[1:58:10] i'm not capped uh like a a captain
[1:58:13] judgment okay
[1:58:14] i'm not captain putting guy in place and
[1:58:16] pulling the sword i'm not that guy but
[1:58:17] i've had to be that guy that time
[1:58:20] and after a month and a half of prayer
[1:58:23] all at that time for the camp priest's
[1:58:26] sermon
[1:58:27] and the holy ghost came down and i got a
[1:58:29] refilling for probably 45 minutes
[1:58:31] i was running and jumping stealing the
[1:58:34] mic from the
[1:58:34] minister said he's here he's hearing
[1:58:36] god's it was the presence of god
[1:58:41] and after that filling of the holy ghost
[1:58:44] for three full days from the time i woke
[1:58:47] up
[1:58:48] to the time i went to bed he was there i
[1:58:51] felt god and i'll say it like this
[1:58:56] he is so every you guys know how the
[1:58:58] prophet he's a he's a gentleman
[1:59:00] he literally now i'm gonna give i'm
[1:59:02] gonna give this i was
[1:59:04] at those three days i was walking like
[1:59:05] this even at work i was working i was
[1:59:07] like
[1:59:08] because the presence of god was so heavy
[1:59:10] and i had to go to the bathroom i had to
[1:59:11] go the bathroom
[1:59:13] i went to the bathroom came out and
[1:59:14] there was this girl that was working in
[1:59:16] construction because
[1:59:16] girls were construction now and i
[1:59:19] thought i'm going to say hello to her
[1:59:22] and as soon as i went said hello he was
[1:59:24] gone
[1:59:26] i was like oh my goodness just something
[1:59:28] like that something that little talking
[1:59:30] to
[1:59:30] a girl that god did not tell you to talk
[1:59:33] to
[1:59:34] i was not going there to flirt i was not
[1:59:37] going there to do anything
[1:59:38] but say hello and the holy ghost left
[1:59:43] and instantly i repented lord forgive me
[1:59:45] he come right back
[1:59:48] and i was like that for three full days
[1:59:52] and i was i'm thinking these things when
[1:59:55] this move this ladder range starts
[1:59:56] striking
[1:59:57] and the power of god is so high we must
[1:59:59] be
[2:00:01] seriously led by the holy ghost to get
[2:00:04] out of the will of god
[2:00:05] means he will leave for a season we must
[2:00:08] be
[2:00:08] very very careful anyhow
