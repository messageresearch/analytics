[25:16] with you the lost coin the prophet of
[25:21] God preached wonderful messages about

[25:25] name of the Lord so here if you read in
[25:34] the prophets coat second coming of the
[25:37] Lord he preached in 1957 here he says
[25:42] it's later than we think we don't come
[25:46] to church to occupy pew we do not come
[25:50] to church to hear a good sermon or come
[25:53] to church to hear good music they all
[25:55] got their place but what we better come
[25:59] to church to do is to check up with God
[26:02] I'm a shall weigh our souls in in
[26:05] salvation for the day of redemption is
[26:08] near geez Jesus Christ God's Son likened
[26:13] this he said to a woman in our subject
[26:17] tonight we find this woman her husband
[26:19] had gone and she had lost one of the
[26:21] coins out of her tablet praise the name
[26:25] of the Lord so the Prophet said you know
[26:27] this woman is the church praise the name
[26:30] of the Lord and we are the church we are
[26:33] his people hallelujah thank you Jesus
[26:36] and our husband like Isaiah chapter 55
[26:40] if 54 verse 5 says here
[26:49] temple 54 verse 5 says for thy maker is
[26:53] dying husband the Lord of Hosts is his
[26:56] name thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel
[27:00] the God of whole earth shall I be called
[27:03] praise the name of the Lord so you
[27:05] understand now we are that woman and one
[27:09] day she got up early in the morning her
[27:12] husband has gone out on business and
[27:15] when she got up according to the law of
[27:18] Moses the married woman she should have
[27:22] tent 10 coins on her tablet you know
[27:26] even that also the prophet said here is
[27:28] very wonderfully explained it I thank
[27:31] God for him the same message 2nd coming
[27:34] of the Lord today if if a woman is
[27:36] married she should wear a wedding ring
[27:39] as a sign that she's married that to
[27:43] keep other men from having anything to
[27:45] do with her they look and the sees is a
[27:48] married woman in those days they didn't
[27:51] have varying rings they had a tablet
[27:53] they called it tablet they put it on
[27:57] their head it had ten coins and it
[28:01] remained around their head and that was
[28:03] a sign with a sign they were married
[28:07] woman and no man was too full with them
[28:10] no boys was too far flirt with them they
[28:13] were married praise the name of the Lord
[28:16] so I could tell you what each one of
[28:19] these coins means it is placed in there
[28:22] and each coin meant a certain virtue of
[28:24] that woman and first meaning her love to
[28:27] her husband second her plays a virtue to
[28:31] leave clean for him and the third and
[28:34] fourth and fifth so here we see that
[28:36] this woman is the church according the
[28:40] law of Moses if her neighbor come to
[28:44] know that she lost one of her coin from
[28:48] ten tablets and she's in trouble you
[28:53] know and they will go and inform the
[28:56] village leader or a priest or a temple
[28:58] priest and tell it

[29:03] lost her coin and something is wrong and
[29:04] and the village priest will come you
[29:08] know village priest or a leader or
[29:10] whatever and a temple priest he will
[29:11] come with the witnesses and see that see

[29:21] they take her out of the town you know
[29:24] and understand stone him stronger you

[57:59] about the message about the Prophet you
[58:03] know and she said brother Jian please
[58:07] don't talk to us about brother Branham
[58:09] don't talk to us about this in a message
[58:13] you know we know that very well why why
[58:18] the world is rejecting because he was
[58:20] the true man of God he was a perfect
[58:23] creature of God preaching the Word of
[58:26] God he never failed anybody huh he told
[58:30] the truth that's the reason you know I
[58:34] feel sorry for them you know I loved
[58:37] them respect them because they are the
[58:39] people who sent me you know legal
[58:42] documents to get a visa u.s. visa you
[58:47] know legal documents nobody will do that
[58:49] you know I wanted to bring my wife you
[58:52] know my wife wife who is going to give
[58:54] you the Lord you know I want to bring
[58:55] her and I spoke to many pastors in the
[58:57] message nobody was doing that you see
[58:59] nobody could do that you see but those
[59:02] people you know and they you know
[59:05] legally you know they went to the court
[59:07] and the judge or something you know and
[59:09] they send me you know legal papers for
[59:13] US visa you know so but those people are
[59:16] wonderful in people but they said don't
[59:19] tell us about William Branham we know
[59:24] him you know precious brothers and
[59:26] sisters

[59:38] are those who you know do not touch my
[59:40] anointed by water did you know her do
[59:43] the law of Moses it was death for them
[59:44] you know if somebody spoke against Moses
[59:47] it was dead that's why God said Moses
[59:50] I'm going to wipe out these people I'm
[59:53] not happy with them Moses said okay Lord
[59:57] first you can you destroy it God loves
[1:00:04] his prophets God loves his anointed it
[1:00:09] is dangerous to speak against the
[1:00:10] anointed of God praise the name of the
[1:00:14] Lord hallelujah huh
[1:00:16] it's dangerous to speak against the
[1:00:18] message of the hour this message like I
[1:00:20] was told in the morning this message
[1:00:22] never belongs to Willie and Marion
[1:00:24] Branham it belongs to the Holy Ghost I
[1:00:28] raised the name of the Lord when you
[1:00:30] speak against the message against the
[1:00:31] Holy Ghost you are in trouble hmm

[1:00:50] time to open our heart and say Lord I'm

[1:01:03] child of God children of God will always
[1:01:05] try to judge themselves first praise the
[1:01:09] name of the Lord this is the time to
[1:01:11] read the candle this is the time to

[1:01:18] diligently and find it where we are
[1:01:20] today how many coins we lost the Prophet
[1:01:25] the men of God provinces we lost every
[1:01:28] one of them so how can we go in the

[1:01:54] hallelujah praise the name of the Lord
[1:01:56] this is the time in the same message
[1:01:59] called
[1:02:02] and it was critically getting night
[1:02:07] remember her husband would return and if
[1:02:11] he found her with one of those coins out
[1:02:13] it showed that she had been marked
[1:02:16] harlot and if she had defied or defiled
[1:02:20] herself in any way it was seen by the
[1:02:22] people they brought her before the
[1:02:25] priests and brought witnesses that she
[1:02:29] would been found such and the priest
[1:02:32] seen that she was a married woman took
[1:02:34] the coin out of a tablet huh and that
[1:02:37] she had been doing wrong she had made
[1:02:40] her virtue they took that out if she had
[1:02:45] been flirting showing that she wasn't
[1:02:47] true to her husband they took that one
[1:02:50] out and whatever it was they took it out
[1:02:54] and when her husband returned he found
[1:02:57] that she had been marked and he would
[1:02:59] divorce her immediately and have nothing
[1:03:03] to do with such a woman he did not want
[1:03:06] such a woman so it was getting along

[1:14:21] Lord for the service Amen I just wanted
[1:14:24] him to know that we were here and heard
[1:14:26] every word by God's grace appreciate our
[1:14:30] brother for being moved by God to come
[1:14:34] here because some of the things my wife
[1:14:37] bear witnessed that he was saying the
[1:14:41] evening I God said the same thing we're
[1:14:46] just so thankful just to have a witness
[1:14:49] because now is the time like I was
[1:14:54] saying now it's the time to make sure
[1:14:55] you got the Holy Ghost now it's the time
[1:14:59] to make sure that you have swept the
[1:15:01] house and all the coins are in its
[1:15:04] proper place you keep seeking God until
[1:15:08] God has established those virtues in you
[1:15:11] that it is not just seen by you but seen
[1:15:13] by others so we thank God it was so
[1:15:17] refreshing that scripture that the
[1:15:21] brother read because often time we
[1:15:24] forget one corn just one corn missing in
[1:15:29] the eyes of God you are considered an
[1:15:31] adulteress hello that's the words of the
[1:15:36] Prophet that's the word of the word and
[1:15:39] you want to make sure that all those
[1:15:41] virtues you understand what I mean
[1:15:43] people Berlin preached about the true
[1:15:47] identification of a true church and he
[1:15:50] showed us all that the true church
[1:15:52] possessed and I believe that all of us
[1:15:54] possess something that God wants to use
[1:15:59] and the only way that he can use it just
[1:16:02] like I told him down there in Iowa City
[1:16:06] every vessel was anointed if you was a
[1:16:12] housewife he was an anointed housewife
[1:16:15] hello if he was a brick mason or
[1:16:20] whatever you were a teacher whatever you
[1:16:22] are you are supposed to be anointed this
[1:16:25] anointing is not for the preacher only
[1:16:30] every vessel was anointed and every
[1:16:33] vessel Amen was anointed by the same oil
[1:16:36] it wasn't a separate oil for the
[1:16:39] preacher versus the congregation every
[1:16:42] vessel in the in beyond the curtain and
[1:16:46] every everywhere was anointed by the
[1:16:50] olive oil about all in which they use
[1:16:52] and I want to say this by the grace of
[1:16:55] God you know I was telling my wife
[1:16:57] coming here
[1:16:58] I said Israel missed it they got the
[1:17:01] anointing of justification that
[1:17:04] anointing of justification took it into
[1:17:07] sanctification there was anointed there
[1:17:09] remember now David was anointed three
[1:17:11] times when he was anointed the first
[1:17:14] time he was King we needed known to the
[1:17:16] second time he was king we knew was an
[1:17:18] unguent nor to the third time he was
[1:17:20] king and that was a process that he had
[1:17:24] to go through but he was always King was
[1:17:27] God had decided in his mind who he was
[1:17:30] he was king you understand me
[1:17:33] I'm saying you're Queen like the brother
[1:17:36] said we're the real queen of heaven amen
[1:17:39] let him anoint you annoying to
[1:17:40] acknowledge you never get dissatisfied
[1:17:43] with one an auntie
[1:17:45] let'em continuously anoint you as
[1:17:48] brother Branham said let god we need a
[1:17:50] refilling of the Holy Ghost every day
[1:17:53] not sometime all the time every day
[1:17:58] that's what we're preaching because it
[1:18:01] is that anointing that will attract that
[1:18:03] anointing yeah if you part of the magnet
[1:18:08] that means you got you got the Holy
[1:18:10] Ghost here and the Holy Ghost is down
[1:18:12] there and there you are and you're not
[1:18:15] want to be pulled about that magnet
[1:18:17] because it's coming it's coming it's
[1:18:20] moving already
[1:18:21] amen yes and folks who God you know
[1:18:26] don't don't look at all everybody else
[1:18:28] you know the prophet of God said it was
[1:18:32] the Prophet is our and in the Prophet
[1:18:36] that was there or living a man let me
[1:18:38] call him doesn't become because he talks
[1:18:40] about those who escaped that Jewish age
[1:18:42] and I got him in my mind you know what
[1:18:48] about the two words that was in the
[1:18:49] temple when Jesus came you know I'm
[1:18:51] thinking of Simeon yeah was one and in
[1:18:56] the sister and he says oh it's always
[1:18:59] male and female male and female myth
[1:19:01] husband and wife other than wife bride
[1:19:04] and Christ bride in Christ so I'm saying
[1:19:09] all Israel was dead all of Israel was
[1:19:13] religious but there were two a blind man
[1:19:21] and they were in the temple praying Lord
[1:19:28] don't let me die until I see yo massage
[1:19:33] and that blind man had more sight than
[1:19:37] the Pharisees and the Sadducees of that
[1:19:39] day y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:19:41] I must understand if everybody else is
[1:19:45] dead and not moving in the spirit you
[1:19:48] let them be that you just say Lord keep
[1:19:52] that anointing with me and so let me
[1:19:55] walk in the spirit keep me in that
[1:19:57] anointing because that is where all the
[1:20:00] chords are stolen that's what the virtue
[1:20:03] is it's not in you as in you know you
[1:20:06] love the Lord didn't mean to preach but
