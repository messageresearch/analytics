[0:01] as we turn to Matthew four and four
[0:07] they're gonna read Matthew four and then
[0:13] we'll go to John first job excuse me
[0:16] first John three eight through ten
[0:34] Matthew the fourth chapter then was
[0:46] Jesus led up of the spirit into the
[0:49] wilderness to be tempted of the devil
[0:51] and when he had fasted 40 days and 40
[0:56] nights he was afterward a hundred and
[1:00] when the tempter came to him he said if
[1:03] thou be the Son of God command that
[1:07] these stones be made bread but he
[1:11] answered and said it is written man
[1:14] shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:19] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:22] mouth of God then the devil taketh him
[1:25] up into the holy city and setteth him on
[1:29] a pinnacle of the temple and saith unto
[1:33] him if thou be the Son of God cast
[1:37] thyself down for it is written he shall
[1:42] give his angels charge concerning thee
[1:46] and in their hands they shall bear thee
[1:48] up lest at any time thou dash thy foot
[1:52] against a stone jesus said unto Him it
[1:56] is written again thou shall not tempt
[2:00] the LORD thy God again the devil taketh
[2:03] him up into an exceeding high mountain
[2:06] and showed him all the kingdoms of the
[2:10] world and the glory of them
[2:14] and said unto him all these things will
[2:19] I give thee if thou would fall down and
[2:22] worship Me
[2:24] then said Jesus unto Him get the hint
[2:28] Satan for it is written thou shalt
[2:32] worship the Lord that God and him only
[2:35] shalt thou serve one more scripture
[2:39] first John 3 8 through 10 for this
[3:00] purpose the Son of God was manifested
[3:03] that he might destroy the works of the
[3:07] devil first John 3rd chapter 8 through
[3:11] 10 whosoever is born of God does not
[3:14] commit sin for his seed remaineth in him
[3:19] and he cannot sin because he is born of
[3:23] God in this the children of God are
[3:27] manifest and the children of the devil
[3:31] whosoever doeth not righteousness is not
[3:34] of God neither he that loveth not his
[3:39] brother let us pray
[3:44] do you have any father we come before
[3:47] you as humbly as we know how we thank
[3:52] you for your grace we thank you for your
[3:55] mercy we thank you for everything that
[3:58] you have done to and for us forgive us
[4:02] of our sins strengthen us today Lord
[4:05] that will be a true example of your word
[4:08] help us all Lord in this trying and
[4:12] testing our but father not I will let
[4:17] thine be done
[4:18] in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray
[4:21] amen you may be seated
[4:29] I'd like to entitle this message this
[4:31] morning it must be perfect it must be
[4:42] perfect when we think about perfection
[4:49] we think about something that is
[4:52] entirely without flaw or defects or
[4:57] shortcomings like a perfect Apple or a
[5:06] perfect orange or something that has
[5:11] done so well that you can't find a way
[5:15] to undo it like a perfect crime brother
[5:23] branham tells us that one of the great
[5:26] ways of one of the greatest robberies
[5:30] ever done in the history of mankind was
[5:34] done by way of false light and I want
[5:40] you to know this evening that's exactly
[5:43] what happened in the Garden of Eden
[5:47] the spirit of the Antichrist move and
[5:52] that Antichrist came in on the white
[5:56] horse rider even then he came with a
[6:02] true teaching and that teaching was to
[6:08] take Adam and his wife off of the word
[6:14] because he worked with their reasoning
[6:19] it became
[6:20] so write that deed and then that deed
[6:27] was conceived and it became a doctrine
[6:33] and II took that same doctrine to her
[6:37] husband that doctrine not only grew but
[6:43] it multiplied and it produced what we
[6:49] would say a church that deed came to a
[6:58] place where it got onto a red horse
[7:01] rider and it rode and it brought church
[7:04] bloodshed and persecution even death to
[7:09] Abel didn't stop there because now the
[7:15] church grew it became a mega church and
[7:19] the sons of God saw the daughters of men
[7:23] that they were fair death is now riding
[7:29] restrictions and things women became
[7:31] beautiful hello just like in this day
[7:37] and that deed became a doctorate in that
[7:41] church began to rule so that Bible said
[7:44] violence increased in the land God heard
[7:49] their voice and that horse is now still
[7:53] riding but that horse brought them to a
[7:58] horrible death the Bible says in Genesis
[8:03] 6 I believe that God repented that he
[8:08] made mankind because they were so evil
[8:11] that horse had conquered that spirit
[8:16] Antichrist had conquered so much of the
[8:20] church because remember now Adam and Eve
[8:23] was the first church here on earth Satan
[8:27] came in and defiled the church by way of
[8:30] the serpent and that spirit kept riding
[8:33] and riding till they brought the people
[8:35] of God to a horrible judgment
[8:37] remember God warned them because amen
[8:42] before God will judge you and sentence
[8:44] you he warns you before judgment and
[8:48] through the voice of Noah he warned them
[8:51] but they did not take heed in the midst
[8:56] of all of this we had a mighty man by
[8:58] the name of Enoch and the Bible said
[9:02] that he walked with God man does not
[9:06] live by bread alone but by every word
[9:09] that proceeds out of the mouth of God
[9:12] and therefore Enoch out of all the
[9:15] people in the world understood it was
[9:18] safer to walk with God than with men and
[9:24] understand he had to be isolated he was
[9:27] the only one that meant God's criteria
[9:32] he was perfect because he followed every
[9:36] word of God it doesn't mean that he
[9:39] didn't make mistakes because you know
[9:42] and I know that our perfection is not of
[9:45] us but it is of God and as long as we
[9:50] follow the message of the Word of God
[9:52] and do the best we can the blood of
[9:56] Jesus Christ keeps us covered that is
[9:59] what makes us perfect that's why I'm
[10:03] saying tonight or this morning whatever
[10:05] you do stay under the blood out of that
[10:13] a great church only eight souls were
[10:17] saved you don't take the Antichrist
[10:20] period back for granite is already
[10:23] conquer the world is that right
[10:27] it conquered a world through deception
[10:30] and there was nowhere in the land and
[10:34] the only profit was there was anak and
[10:39] evidently nobody listened to him even
[10:44] though he built the pyramid his gospel
[10:48] there do you find nobody under his
[10:51] ministry nobody listened but then you
[10:55] find Noah he couldn't get anybody either
[10:57] outside of his house and it had to be a
[11:02] hard time forward it had to be a tough
[11:06] time ain't meant for Noah to keep his
[11:08] family in line with all of the
[11:11] wickedness and stuff that was going on
[11:12] just like it is now
[11:15] People of God you don't have to tell me
[11:16] it is very difficult family fathers
[11:21] mothers to keep your children underneath
[11:24] this message what do they say you too
[11:28] strict you're too controlling but let me
[11:34] tell you something
[11:35] someone will control you it's going to
[11:41] either be the Holy Spirit or it's going
[11:44] to be the devil it's going to be Christ
[11:47] or it's going to be the Antichrist
[11:50] you're not going to get out of this
[11:52] situation without a sentence hello it
[12:01] must be perfect how can we serve God in
[12:07] such a perfect way I'll tell you how
[12:12] coming from the statue of a perfect man
[12:14] he says a body has now prepared me God
[12:19] dwells in the statue of a man reflecting
[12:24] himself into that being being perfect
[12:28] worship God in us hello that's God in us
[12:34] that's what perfect worship is being his
[12:38] tabernacle
[12:41] manifesting oh how we could stay on that
[12:45] till you would almost suffocate see God
[12:48] has always at all time reflected himself
[12:53] in a man God is not interested in
[12:58] religion because even the Antichrist
[13:02] produced our religion you say he didn't
[13:06] yes she did that spirit produced a
[13:10] man-made religion right in the Garden of
[13:13] Eden when it became a doctrine one thing
[13:20] they did know in that day they were
[13:23] naked in this day the religion has
[13:27] covered them and blinded them so much
[13:29] they don't even know they're naked but
[13:33] in that day they covered themselves with
[13:36] fig leaves that was their religion and
[13:39] they literally thought that God was
[13:42] going to accept their religion God did
[13:45] not accept Cain's offering and God will
[13:49] not accept yours either accept your
[13:52] offering be made by the blood of the
[13:54] Lamb hello it must be perfect and that
[14:03] perfection only comes by God's Word it's
[14:09] not him who will it no he that run it
[14:11] but God that shows mercy come on
[14:14] somebody in this day religion will make
[14:19] your wife turn and look at Sodom
[14:25] that's the Antichrist spirit so brethren
[14:30] when you get up when you see your wife
[14:33] turning understand it is the Antichrist
[14:36] spirit of this age that got her turning
[14:40] and looking at Sodom oh she wants to be
[14:44] so beautiful she wants to be so accepted
[14:47] she wants she wants the things of Sodom
[14:50] understand you know wrestle against
[14:52] flesh and blood
[14:54] your arousal against spiritual
[14:56] wickedness in high places
[14:59] it's in the Bible every spirit we're
[15:04] dealing with right now has already been
[15:07] is that songs of Solomon true I feel
[15:11] like shouting this morning the songs of
[15:14] Solomon says everything that have been
[15:15] you see now has already been that means
[15:19] somebody had to deal with the same
[15:21] spirit you and I are dealing with but
[15:25] there's only one way of escape that's
[15:29] under the blood of Jesus Christ and
[15:33] listen you and I must understand there
[15:38] is no excuse God for every believer has
[15:41] truly placed a seed in you you can't
[15:46] even love God if the seed of God is not
[15:49] in you that seed must be in you this is
[15:57] why I struggled in I struggled with the
[16:00] message not the message but the people
[16:02] I've struggled so much I know I'm faulty
[16:06] but I know the seed is perfect and I
[16:10] know that I have always had in all my
[16:13] Airy ways I have always had a perfect
[16:16] desire to serve God perfectly I've
[16:20] always pressed I've always tried but it
[16:24] confuses me when I see people with no
[16:28] efforts they don't care about pleasing
[16:32] God and they don't even care about
[16:34] pleasing you the only thing they care
[16:37] about is pleasing themselves but the
[16:43] Bible said here is that manifestation
[16:46] Invista children of God are manifested
[16:49] and the children of the devil whosoever
[16:52] doeth not righteousness is not of God
[16:56] neither he that loveth not his brother
[17:00] that means do it that means continue to
[17:03] do wrong no you're doing wrong and there
[17:05] is no repentance
[17:08] hmm I want you to understand you can be
[17:12] seen and still backslide and if you do
[17:16] backslide then God will deal with you
[17:18] brother madam said if he can't get a
[17:21] true seed to repent he spanks them and
[17:24] put them to sleep
[17:27] we call that death you know I've had
[17:32] people say well you know I've been taken
[17:34] under the blood and then nothing
[17:35] happened to me that ain't nothing to
[17:37] brag on because the Lord chasing those
[17:41] whom he loved if God don't chase in you
[17:46] then perhaps you're not he is but if God
[17:50] chasing you and bring you back to God
[17:54] y'all know what I'm saying some of us
[17:57] have backslidden without even the church
[17:59] knowing but God because He loves you he
[18:01] thank you and brings you back it must be
[18:07] perfect reading from Isaiah 64 4 through
[18:12] 7 want you to know that the power of
[18:15] completion is in the seed it's not about
[18:22] you in other words it's not him that
[18:24] will it know he that running on but it's
[18:28] God who shows mercy you understand me
[18:35] because God will not lose one those who
[18:40] are of his Amen he will go whatever
[18:44] measure whatever distance he must go to
[18:48] save you he will do so MA because God is
[18:56] incomplete without one of us did you
[19:01] hear me he is incomplete without one of
[19:05] us God is a God that if he had a hundred
[19:09] sheep he'll never be satisfied with
[19:11] ninety-nine
[19:13] because the Bible said he'll leave the
[19:15] ninety-nine and go find the other one by
[19:20] the mighty God we serve for since the
[19:26] beginning of the world men have not
[19:29] heard not perceived by the ear neither
[19:34] have the eyes seen
[19:36] Oh God besides thee what he had before
[19:42] him that waiteth for him they all needed
[19:47] him that rejoices and worketh
[19:51] righteousness those that remember thee
[19:54] in the way in the what thy ways behold
[19:57] thou art Roth for we have sinned and in
[20:02] those continents excuse me and we have
[20:07] we shall be saved continuous and we
[20:10] shall be saved
[20:11] but we are all as unclean thing and all
[20:15] our righteousnesses are as filthy rags
[20:17] and we all do fade as a leaf and our
[20:22] iniquities like the wind have taken his
[20:25] us away and there is none that call it
[20:29] upon thy name that stirred up himself to
[20:33] take hold of thee but thou has hid that
[20:35] face from us and has consumed us because
[20:38] of our iniquities but now O Lord thou
[20:43] art our Father we are the clay thou are
[20:48] our Potter and we are all the work of
[20:53] thy hand is that all right we're in the
[20:58] Book of Jeremiah he said I went down to
[21:01] the potter's house and there I caused e
[21:05] to hear my word hello
[21:08] see none of us cried out but God start
[21:11] working on you to the point you cried
[21:14] out to him so you can't boast and brag
[21:17] oh I called it a lot no God had to work
[21:21] on you first in order for you to cry out
[21:25] to him
[21:27] it must be perfect not one of us will be
[21:30] able to stand before the throne of God
[21:32] and tell God I did this and I did that
[21:37] hello
[21:39] remember every one of them that stood
[21:43] before the throne of God says Lord
[21:44] haven't I done many works in that name
[21:48] haven't I cast out Devils
[21:50] every one of them that stood in the
[21:53] presence of a God of God who said that
[21:56] God said what you workers of iniquity I
[22:00] did not even know you why because you
[22:05] know and I know those who truly have met
[22:08] Christ will be able to say the Lord it's
[22:13] not me it's not that I live but it's
[22:17] Christ that lives in me it's not that
[22:20] I've done a great thing
[22:22] oh lord have mercy people let me tell
[22:25] you even the saints of God when the
[22:27] seals were opened and those 24 elders
[22:30] stood there with their crowns on
[22:32] hallelujah amen the first thing they did
[22:35] when Jesus when they came into the
[22:37] presence of Jesus amen what did they do
[22:39] that through the crowd love and they hit
[22:42] the floor because they realize they
[22:45] realized that their they were unworthy
[22:50] none of us are worthy of ourselves to be
[22:54] in heaven or even in the heavenly places
[22:56] it is the grace of God God didn't leave
[23:02] yourself salvation in your hands
[23:06] salvation is of the Lord says the word
[23:10] he didn't leave it in your hair because
[23:12] we're failures to begin with like the
[23:15] prophets said we mess up everything it's
[23:19] very difficult it meant for us to walk a
[23:21] straight line without the Holy Spirit
[23:24] and even then we crickets sometime hello
[23:33] arise and go down to the part
[23:36] and there will I cause need to hear my
[23:38] words then I went down to the potter's
[23:40] house and behold he wrought a work on
[23:43] the wheels and I think that's what's
[23:45] happening now we're on the wheels some
[23:49] of us are on the wheels hallelujah
[23:52] a lot of time we feel like our
[23:54] challenges are gonna overtake us
[23:57] they can't when God as our brother said
[24:01] is producing a testimony huh
[24:05] every trial and test you go through
[24:08] hallelujah is building a testimony for
[24:12] Jesus don't give up on God as you heard
[24:16] me saying because he won't give up on
[24:19] you
[24:19] hallelujah so you and I must know by the
[24:23] grace of God these trials will pass
[24:28] everything that's not permanent will
[24:30] pass Oh Lord I don't know about you but
[24:34] when I go through my tests I must trust
[24:37] him I have nothing else to trust I must
[24:41] trust him he's the Shepherd I'm the
[24:45] Sheep wherever he leads me I'll follow
[24:50] and I went down to the potter's house
[24:53] and behold he wrought a work on the
[24:55] wheels you know a lot of time we want to
[24:57] get off the wheels but you know what a
[25:00] wheel is it's a sign of eternity only
[25:02] the pottery that gets on those wheels
[25:05] have a hope of eternity come o Suvari
[25:10] I'm talking about God's will when you
[25:13] get on his wheel I forgot what that's
[25:15] the holiday the Jewish people are now
[25:16] celebrating and and one of the things
[25:19] that they celebrate is what they do is
[25:20] they they put the platform wherever the
[25:22] preacher is and they go around in
[25:24] circles oh they just enjoy themselves
[25:26] what and you know why they go out in
[25:28] circles because they say it's the end of
[25:31] the seventh day and now we're entering
[25:34] the eighth day it is a sign of eternity
[25:39] hallelujah and you and I must understand
[25:42] Amen that when God puts you on the wheel
[25:45] he's working you any of the
[25:50] oh dear it get broken did y'all know
[25:52] that when God Amen puts you on the wheel
[25:55] a lot of times we think that it's the
[25:57] end of it all if I could just get off
[25:59] the wheel but you don't understand when
[26:01] you get off the wheel you got another
[26:03] phase the fire you've got to go through
[26:09] the fire and if you don't make it
[26:12] through the fire it means that there is
[26:14] something still unclean in the clay
[26:18] something that makes the Pape pottery
[26:21] break when it's under fire hello
[26:25] and then when you break guess what God
[26:27] do he don't throw you away he takes
[26:30] those broken pieces again and start the
[26:33] work all over again
[26:35] that's your Potter and that's my Potter
[26:39] right now that's just a phase because a
[26:42] lot of us think that oh my god hi I'm
[26:45] gonna make it let me tell you something
[26:47] the great squeeze haven't even come yet
[26:49] God's trying to condition your mind to
[26:52] the place where you trust him he wants
[26:57] you to trust him because he knows if you
[26:59] trust him when the squeeze do come
[27:01] you'll make it through you'll make it
[27:06] through but if you don't trust him now
[27:08] how you gonna trust him later it must be
[27:12] perfect
[27:13] oh I just feel like shouting right now I
[27:17] feel the president the Lord I don't know
[27:18] whether you do or not but on the whole
[27:20] still I might do it after I'm finished
[27:22] but I want you to understand it meant
[27:25] that God amen has a word for you and I
[27:28] this is not a sermon that brother Brooks
[27:30] just caught up god is personally
[27:33] delivering you a message the message
[27:38] that brother Branham preached wasn't
[27:40] just something to tickle your ear he he
[27:42] was delivering from God a message to the
[27:45] bride and here I stand in his stead not
[27:50] just me every preacher that's preaching
[27:52] this message is hearing from God and
[27:54] we're connected right now and God is
[27:57] saying to you it must be perfect
[28:00] but the only way it can be perfect you
[28:03] must
[28:03] be found under the blood see the nature
[28:08] of the seed and thank God for the seed I
[28:11] don't want to be one that shouts and
[28:13] jump and run up and down the aisle and I
[28:16] can't live it what good is that huh
[28:22] what good is that but the point is is
[28:25] that if you are understand the
[28:29] leadership of the Holy Spirit will lead
[28:31] you to your burden is that right
[28:36] hallelujah God will make sure you come
[28:42] to a real birth if you don't allow him
[28:45] to lead you he will drive you and that's
[28:49] what the squeeze is really about driving
[28:52] us because we're too lazy and dolet or
[28:56] we've got too many things going on like
[28:58] I said Wednesday we too busy burden
[29:01] under Satan's yoke don't have time to
[29:04] pray don't have time to witness don't
[29:08] have time to read your Bible don't even
[29:10] have time to listen to brother Branham
[29:12] without falling asleep hallelujah we
[29:19] don't grow when things are easy we grow
[29:24] when we faces challenges hmm that's when
[29:32] you facing a challenge that's when you
[29:34] realize how much faith muscles you have
[29:39] hallelujah Israel who was supposed to be
[29:42] that's the Church of God when Goliath
[29:44] came on the scene they ran but he was a
[29:48] young boy who had testimony after
[29:51] testimony God had taught him to trust
[29:55] him that's why Saul says the Lord is my
[29:59] shepherd I shall not want
[30:01] see baby learn that God was able to
[30:05] bring him out of every situation and
[30:08] circumstance as long as David kept his
[30:12] worship perfect
[30:16] hallelujah and he kept his worship
[30:19] perfect y'all I just love David because
[30:22] David was a man who was able to repent
[30:26] David was a landing man who was able to
[30:28] say Lord I'm sorry David was able to
[30:31] call it like it says Lord I'm in a
[30:33] horrible pit I'm in a deep pit I mean
[30:36] I'm in a terrible place in my spiritual
[30:39] life and I don't know how to get out of
[30:41] it but David said the Lord heard my cry
[30:45] and he lifted me up and he praised me on
[30:48] a rock hallelujah that's what we're all
[30:53] about God wants his children to that
[30:56] right brother Brown said God loves or
[30:58] his children to cry out to him don't be
[31:02] lazy in the cry cry out see love for God
[31:09] is obedience and love for God is
[31:11] holiness to love God and to love man is
[31:15] to be conformed to the image of Christ
[31:18] and this is salvation now hear me this
[31:22] is salvation allowing God to form you
[31:25] into the image somebody dropped those
[31:28] who the notes on me and I thought they
[31:29] were pretty nice I include them in my
[31:31] message because that's it that's it if
[31:35] we're gonna have perfect love we must
[31:38] think like God we must act like God we
[31:43] must walk like God if God said do this
[31:46] we do it if God said do that we do it it
[31:50] is not up to us to question or reason
[31:52] because I'm gonna tell you something as
[31:54] soon as you do that you are now opening
[31:55] yourself up to the Antichrist now that's
[32:01] what he did she opened herself up to
[32:04] reasoning but if you trust God hello
[32:11] if you trust God he will deliver anybody
[32:18] you know in the Bible that ever trust
[32:21] God and he let him down you won't find
[32:26] one example of God Allah
[32:29] any of his believers down like they say
[32:33] he may not come when you want him but he
[32:37] always there on time hallelujah you got
[32:46] a job situation God will never give you
[32:50] a job if you wavering like a a man with
[32:53] a double mind hello if you have I don't
[33:00] care how rough your job gets let me tell
[33:03] you something God can give you a better
[33:04] job if you really want it God owns
[33:08] everything you know one time I hadn't
[33:16] told this many times but it's time for
[33:18] me to say this it's not in my notes but
[33:20] there was a time I had had missionaries
[33:22] for a long time years and I felt like I
[33:24] needed a job I said God I need a dog and
[33:28] we said God said go go fine you want
[33:32] choose the place you want to work Yahoo
[33:37] God is my witness and the Lord told me
[33:41] what to wear when to go and everything I
[33:46] showed up at this hotel which one it was
[33:49] one of my wife a bear witness was one of
[33:51] the best jobs I ever had being a
[33:55] minister gave me time off when I wanted
[33:58] to anytime I could travel or whatever
[34:00] the case may be
[34:01] but not only that they paid me well and
[34:05] uh I wrote wor what God told me to wear
[34:10] you know I went in there and I filled
[34:13] out the application and that that owner
[34:16] came to me the manager whatever said
[34:17] well I am so sorry we just don't have a
[34:21] position for you but if we have anything
[34:24] I'm open we'll let you know
[34:33] [Music]
[34:35] no I didn't leave that unhappy I left
[34:39] there with an assurance because God told
[34:42] me and I asked God for that place to
[34:46] worship work the neighborhood what it
[34:48] was I liked it before I got home that
[34:51] man had already called my wife and told
[34:54] him told her to have him come back
[34:56] we already got a job for him and when I
[35:00] got back to the place the man said we
[35:04] really don't have a job opening but I
[35:06] made one for you hallelujah
[35:12] he said I made one for you and what
[35:15] impressed me was the way you dressed
[35:19] because you was uh you you dressed in a
[35:22] way that you was sure of yourself
[35:27] blessed that man today wherever he is if
[35:30] he's living Lord because he was the one
[35:34] who even he was spiritual enough when I
[35:37] when I got ready to come to Lima I had
[35:41] just received my own hotel to be the
[35:44] general manager I've had my own office
[35:46] and everything else this same man said
[35:50] to me Brooks he called me Brooks he said
[35:53] Brooks because I told him about the
[35:55] offer I had in Lima being a pastor he
[35:59] said Brooks he said I'm not telling you
[36:00] what to do but I'll tell you this he
[36:04] said being general manager of the hotel
[36:06] is gonna be a little difficult for you
[36:09] especially he's because you love God and
[36:15] you he's your first love he said so I
[36:18] tell you what I would do I would take
[36:21] that job I would take that position up
[36:23] then in Lima Ohio now God speaking
[36:26] through a seller and I said yes Lord but
[36:36] heaven yes Lord and some people think
[36:40] all when brother Brooks went to Lima
[36:42] Ohio he was a millionaire y'all and
[36:45] heard all them lies my wife and I i'ma
[36:52] tell you I'll tell you there for a long
[36:54] time me and my wife was getting $500 a
[36:57] month in tithing four years then it
[37:04] increased to a thousand you said all but
[37:06] you have missionaries they are the
[37:09] poorest tight pants in the church most
[37:15] of the time the most money the more
[37:17] money they make the most injure they
[37:22] don't have a revelation of God but
[37:24] anyway I didn't mean to go there I
[37:26] wanted to I wanted everybody to know I
[37:28] was not a millionaire when I was in Lima
[37:30] and some people think I'm a millionaire
[37:33] now but that is a lie from the devil
[37:38] anyway trials will not come to destroy
[37:43] you but we'll let you depend more on God
[37:51] his word must be perfect
[37:54] you must believe that his word is
[37:56] perfect there is no failure in God
[38:02] hallelujah but the only way that will
[38:05] make this word work his faith and did
[38:09] you know that brother Branham said it
[38:10] like this he said you cannot have faith
[38:13] if you don't have love love is the thing
[38:19] that works faith faith works love love
[38:22] works faith because they're twins
[38:26] hallelujah I'm ready to shout here to
[38:29] this morning now you and I must know
[38:31] there is he this is what the prophecy
[38:34] said he says there's many times I fail
[38:36] to pray the prayer of faith there's many
[38:38] times I've tried hard I failed to do it
[38:41] because my faith would not need it huh
[38:45] sometime try your faith just don't meet
[38:48] it because it doesn't meet means it's
[38:52] not time for God to deliver but
[38:57] time for you to be delivered God gives
[39:00] you the faith is that right faint is a
[39:04] gift from God
[39:06] hello faith is a gift from God that
[39:12] doesn't change oh because it doesn't
[39:15] work for you that time well God's Word
[39:17] ain't true
[39:18] what that doesn't change God's Word that
[39:26] doesn't change the Word of God a bit if
[39:29] I pray for 10 thousand people today and
[39:32] ten thousand died in the morning or
[39:35] tomorrow night
[39:36] I'll be there praying for the sick just
[39:40] the same because God's Word says so
[39:46] that's what a real believer is when God
[39:50] says no to you
[39:51] you still says amen tell him me now I'm
[40:02] tomorrow this evening I'll probably deal
[40:04] with blowing the horse-riders because I
[40:06] believe God want me to but I want you to
[40:09] understand that kind of spirit is still
[40:10] reigning among us whenever you let the
[40:14] devil take you off the Word of God by
[40:16] your own reasoning that's the Antichrist
[40:18] I don't care what it is what you're
[40:22] doing that is the Antichrist you are
[40:25] listening to it's not God
[40:28] is that itself remember I said that
[40:30] whatever it said whatever exalt itself
[40:33] above the Word of God and that itself is
[40:36] a person that's saying it self is the
[40:39] one who talked to Eve he became a here
[40:50] he says we must love before we can have
[40:53] faith when we have genuine love what
[40:58] does it do it pushes our faith out on
[41:01] the battlefield for God oh I love God
[41:05] and you want to quit on him love don't
[41:09] quit
[41:11] of conquers all is that right that's the
[41:16] word love never gives up
[41:19] love amen call those things that be not
[41:22] as though they were when there is no
[41:26] sign of victory love say here I stand
[41:30] and the Bible said when you've done all
[41:33] to do to stand stand there for oh I'm
[41:40] not gonna be too much longer but I want
[41:43] you to realize Amen that what you
[41:45] working with it's something that you
[41:48] better how could I say it I want to say
[41:50] to use the word better it would be wise
[41:52] for us to refocus ourselves the way we
[41:56] have handled the word the way we do
[41:59] things and expect oh my
[42:02] listen well you realize it or not the
[42:04] prophet of God said everything we do
[42:07] right now is being recorded your
[42:10] thoughts your actions the clothes you
[42:13] wear everything is being recorded right
[42:16] now why we we saw I don't see God he
[42:20] says even God is here if he here he said
[42:25] where two or three are gathered in my
[42:26] name there I am in the mist he is here
[42:30] he is just a dimensional way but you
[42:34] think God don't see everything you say
[42:37] everything you're thinking what your
[42:40] heart desires are he will and he does
[42:44] you say all what I mean those angels
[42:47] went up before him it says law have you
[42:50] seen what's going on down there in
[42:53] Babylon he said I've been watching it
[42:58] all alone oh they getting ready to throw
[43:03] your sons in the fiery furnace one angel
[43:06] says Lord can I go down wormwood said if
[43:09] I go down Lord I'll turn the world
[43:11] upside down
[43:12] hallelujah but God says huh-uh this is
[43:15] mine the battle is the Lord's hallelujah
[43:19] this is mine and because they trust
[43:23] in him they caught listen they didn't
[43:25] worry about the fire they didn't worry
[43:27] about those who could throw it throw
[43:29] them in then we're not afraid ha
[43:32] because perfect love casts out fear
[43:35] hallelujah and when you are in a
[43:38] position or you are in a trial or you
[43:40] are in a test and you overwhelmed by
[43:43] fear that means you're like in love love
[43:46] for who God you don't trust him like you
[43:49] out too
[43:50] but when trials come and temptations
[43:53] come and you can't see your way that's
[43:55] when you leap that's when you jump
[44:00] hallelujah as long as you can hear his
[44:02] voice you do not need to have the light
[44:05] because his voice is the light
[44:07] hallelujah and that's what what we fail
[44:10] to do God says job I'm right here and
[44:13] you afraid don't be afraid for the leap
[44:17] God's got it all under control
[44:24] sometimes he want to take you there
[44:27] hallelujah
[44:28] is that okay oh it's the truth
[44:33] a lot of times we fail to see that God
[44:38] pushes us into a place where we have to
[44:41] determine whether we gonna love this
[44:43] individual or I hate him
[44:46] hello you think it's by coincidence that
[44:50] God puts you in a position that you have
[44:53] an enemy or two y'all hear me a lot of
[44:58] times people raise up against you on
[44:59] your job and you don't even know why
[45:01] they raising up against you because God
[45:03] ordained it hallelujah
[45:07] and when God ordains it you need to
[45:10] shout whoo hallelujah
[45:12] bah cuz you know God's working with me
[45:16] I'm coming out with a testimony ha y'all
[45:20] better hear me your enemy is God's enemy
[45:24] hallelujah and if they can't prevail
[45:26] over God that means they can't prevail
[45:28] over you like I said last week Amen I
[45:33] said when your boss man said we gonna
[45:35] fire you you need to
[45:37] ask him did God tell you that God gave
[45:42] me this job and if you follow me you
[45:46] gonna have to deal with God because God
[45:49] gave me this job if he's got any soul if
[45:53] he's got any fear of God he'll back it
[45:56] up y'all better put God in your picture
[46:05] let them know I know God you might not
[46:08] like me because I know God but I'm gonna
[46:11] tell you now God gave me this job and if
[46:15] he did not tell you to fire me God is
[46:17] going to deal with you you say a
[46:20] Christian shouldn't be that way yes sir
[46:22] you the authority of this world what you
[46:29] speak hello you should old brother
[46:33] Brooks let me tell you something even
[46:35] when Elijah was in the Roman Orton laws
[46:37] sit down the fire God honored it and I'm
[46:42] not expecting you to be in the wrong
[46:44] announcing but if you want your job you
[46:45] won't know who I'm talking to you want
[46:48] to remain on it put Jesus in the front
[46:50] end in the equation all right see he
[46:54] said of a love even if if a man loves me
[46:57] he'll keep my words right now you can
[47:02] keep his word without having faith in
[47:04] what he said he said you can't keep his
[47:09] word without having faith in what he
[47:11] said right
[47:13] you see if he loves you then he keeps
[47:17] his word is that right if God loves you
[47:22] he's going to keep his word that's in
[47:25] the sinners message desperation
[47:27] hallelujah though I speak with tongues
[47:30] of men and of angels and have not love
[47:33] it is nothing though I have faith to
[47:36] move mountains and have not love it is
[47:39] nothing see love dominates all Oh God
[47:44] have mercy and I'm talking I love for
[47:47] God if you have love for God that means
[47:49] God have lost
[47:50] you is that the word I love him because
[47:54] of what he first loved me man does not
[48:00] live by bread alone but you must
[48:05] recognize the enemy Judah you know what
[48:10] that means right okay you and I must
[48:13] realize by God's grace amen that God is
[48:18] in control of everything he don't want
[48:25] us fretting oh I'm just so worried my
[48:28] nerves your nerves you saw you're not
[48:30] supposed to be dead a dead man don't
[48:36] have feelings in his nerves I don't
[48:40] think so
[48:41] all systems are shot down and that's
[48:46] what we must understand when God said
[48:48] you must die in wrought that's exactly
[48:50] what he means it's got to be perfect see
[48:53] God can't give you this life he's
[48:55] talking about - this old life is dead
[48:57] and rotted oh so much I want to say but
[49:04] let me go here he said I beseech you
[49:06] brethren by the mercies of God that you
[49:09] present your bodies a living sacrifice
[49:10] holy acceptable unto God which is your
[49:14] reasonable service and be not conformed
[49:17] to this world
[49:19] I think the Christians or the message
[49:21] believers have actually forgotten this
[49:24] part be not conformed to this world but
[49:30] be transformed by the renewing of your
[49:32] mind that means God wants to renew your
[49:38] mind take you off of these dead things
[49:42] dead works works of the flesh and put
[49:46] you in a spiritual atmosphere we all
[49:52] think we
[49:52] having battles here I don't know what
[49:54] all everybody is going through but all
[49:56] over the world people are having
[50:00] tremendous battles and you know what
[50:03] these battles are between husbands and
[50:05] wives and children families are being
[50:10] attacked in every way hallelujah
[50:17] you know there's only seven directions
[50:20] really seven you got seven seals seven
[50:22] days every seven is completion but with
[50:26] God there's eight you say what you got
[50:31] seven positions you could you can have
[50:33] north south east west how do you want to
[50:35] do it but then there's a sinner focus
[50:38] another focus that go takes you this way
[50:41] which II turn is eternity and this is
[50:45] where God is trying to get us out of
[50:47] this y'all y'all hear me let me say it
[50:51] like this fathers and mothers if you
[50:53] don't increase your prayer life Satan
[50:56] will come in to destroy all that you
[51:00] have built oh you can't
[51:02] you can't listen God put us in laodicea
[51:06] leaders here is a condition and this
[51:09] condition is not only found in America
[51:12] it's found everywhere and that same
[51:16] condition is now striking your families
[51:19] and you're not praying you're not crying
[51:23] out before God to help right you better
[51:28] understand God trying to get you to pray
[51:33] is that right God is trying to get you
[51:36] to pray even with my own God is
[51:41] awakening me into prayer he's brought me
[51:43] into a position I've not been in in a
[51:45] long time and you said well what do you
[51:46] mean brother Brooks God did it not just
[51:52] for me but for all you know what let me
[51:58] say it like this we're not where we
[51:59] should be when Peter and
[52:02] James and John was thrown into prison
[52:04] the whole church came together and they
[52:07] prayed for that one individual and God
[52:11] delivered them how many have come
[52:14] together to pray for each keine well you
[52:19] stand there and judge my judgment but
[52:21] you've not prayed about it y'all hear me
[52:25] nobody who's going to the rescue only a
[52:27] few and I appreciate every every one of
[52:30] your efforts you understand me
[52:32] but when a wounded soldier goes down we
[52:35] don't kick them down and we don't leave
[52:37] them down we don't desert it listen
[52:39] we're like Abraham we don't leave one
[52:41] man behind consider this to be yours and
[52:48] what you would want the people to do for
[52:51] you you understand me not just her that
[52:56] we've had others but it's a wake of me
[52:58] that I may be it was too passive when I
[53:01] saw others leave and not return but not
[53:04] again it is the same it is an
[53:07] embarrassment for a shepherd to lose a
[53:09] sheep to the wolf you understand me so
[53:19] you and I must understand i'ma have to
[53:21] stop this but I finish up this evening
[53:23] my thought is until we desire to worship
[53:27] God perfectly you understand me with the
[53:31] virtues of God flowing through us we
[53:33] just play in Christianity mmm and
[53:39] understand that these virtues are not
[53:42] just dropped in your lap these virtues
[53:45] come by way of trial and test is that
[53:49] right each one of these virtues are
[53:51] victories that God has won in your life
[53:55] and every one of those virtues are
[53:59] attainable you can possess them because
[54:04] the Word of God says you can and that is
[54:07] the meat for the bride today this is
[54:13] what we live for to come
[54:16] to that perfect statue of Christ where
[54:19] we will be in a position of translation
[54:22] we'll be in a position of a complete
[54:25] adoption that's what we're talking about
[54:28] and you and I we've been grumbling and
[54:31] complaining and many looking at God as
[54:34] if he made a mistake God didn't make no
[54:36] mistake you made a mistake when you
[54:38] asked God to save you because he
[54:43] believed you and he's gonna do just what
[54:46] you asked him to do but think about it
[54:52] because you tried in the fire you come
[54:55] out like pure gold let go and let God
[54:59] stop let Satan make you frustrated one
[55:04] of the things that I find that if we
[55:07] would pray more if we would pray like we
[55:10] gossip we can get some things done it's
[55:21] a truth it's a truth you know we make
[55:28] the telephone occurs the telephone is
[55:31] not occurs we make it occurs because
[55:33] what we do on it and you and I must
[55:39] realize that God is looking for divine
[55:41] love folks I want you to think about
[55:43] think about this if we're one in a
[55:45] million how many million people God is
[55:47] over path passed over to get to you
[55:49] think about it and you and I are will be
[55:56] more responsible it would be better if
[55:58] we had not heard this message and then
[56:04] then to treat it or trot upon it like
[56:07] it's of no value may God have mercy on
[56:10] us and I want to say this in closing
[56:14] because I want to deal more with the
[56:16] Antichrist this evening it's real it's
[56:21] among us a lot of thing
[56:25] the men that we even see in this message
[56:26] is being influenced by the Antichrist
[56:28] spirit hello and I'm gonna take you by
[56:34] God's grace through the scripture
[56:35] somewhat amen so you can give an idea
[56:37] that in order to be to see it you must
[56:41] be spiritual
[56:42] you must be spiritual because just like
[56:46] the Antichrist spirit produces and give
[56:49] a product right just like I meant to say
[56:54] like this just like Christ when Christ
[56:56] comes in you there is a change when the
[56:58] Antichrist spirit is influencing you
[57:00] there is a change and you're gonna give
[57:03] birth to something right you said well
[57:07] what do you mean let me say it like this
[57:09] in closing I am closing those Jews did
[57:12] not even know they had the Antichrist
[57:15] spirit until the time of the birth they
[57:19] thought that they were all right with
[57:22] your home but at the end of the day they
[57:27] persecuted the truth when the time came
[57:33] I was thinking about that think about
[57:39] this when you cry out crucify him
[57:45] what kind of Devil coulda known any
[57:49] Christian person supposedly the crowd
[57:53] with the worst death ever I'd rather for
[57:59] somebody to cut my head off saw me
[58:03] asunder but to crucify me a slow death
[58:08] like that and those Jews were a way of
[58:12] what a crucifixion was and yet they were
[58:16] so anointed and hated the word so much
[58:23] didn't just say kill him they said Cruz
[58:26] I want you to go home and think about
[58:28] that what what they asked Pilate now to
[58:32] do how can
[58:35] people who believe in Jehovah cry out
[58:37] such a hatred and that same devil works
[58:44] among us in our rings but they can't get
[58:50] loose like they want to because of laws
[58:55] but when you hear of ministry defaming
[58:58] another ministry or or doing some of the
[59:03] things that people do you know it's not
[59:05] Christ somewhere the devil is in there
[59:08] somewhere get him back to this a true
[59:12] minister of God he's not looking for
[59:16] fame he's not looking for fortune and
[59:21] he's not he doesn't care about
[59:23] popularity
[59:27] remember Antipas like I said the other
[59:31] day and I found out what Antipas mean
[59:37] it's basically another word for hate the
[59:40] Pope and here this man hate the Papa
[59:47] anyway this man had such a record with
[59:53] God Paul never spoken none of the
[59:58] Apostles ever spoke of him but Jesus did
[1:00:02] who nobody who withstood the Antichrist
[1:00:09] in his day may the Lord help me be an
[1:00:15] Antipas somebody who will withstand
[1:00:22] hallelujah love the Lord let's say it
[1:00:26] mean to be so long but I want you to get
[1:00:30] it this is not a game I had a
[1:00:39] thing happened to me just think it was
[1:00:40] yesterday and I forgot what I was
[1:00:43] talking to this fella about and from
[1:00:48] nowhere he says you know what he said
[1:00:50] it's almost the end like wow this man
[1:00:59] who appears to be a sinner knows it's
[1:01:02] almost the end and I thought Lord you're
[1:01:08] so faithful to me in to us we don't
[1:01:12] deserve your loving-kindness but I thank
[1:01:14] you for it anyway let's just bound a
[1:01:17] word of Prayer dear Jesus we come before
[1:01:22] you as humbly as we know how we thank
