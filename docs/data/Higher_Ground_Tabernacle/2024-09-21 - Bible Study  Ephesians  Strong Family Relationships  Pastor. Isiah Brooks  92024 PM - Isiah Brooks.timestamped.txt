[10:24] and and and and those things are not
[10:27] correct with the scriptures
[10:30] um a church family is a community of
[10:33] people that attend the same church
[10:36] that's how they Define
[10:37] it uh more than that a church family
[10:42] shares in the fullness of faith and life
[10:47] together Amen in other words I don't
[10:51] have
[10:54] uh a party or of a gathering even if
[10:58] you're not invited you should be
[11:01] invited you should be able to attend you
[11:03] should be able to
[11:04] come unless it's just a real private
[11:08] situation but we find out that people do
[11:12] things and they don't understand that
[11:14] they're being Prejudice when they do
[11:17] it because often time people love those
[11:21] who love
[11:23] them amen and many times they fail to
[11:27] see that even the unlovable if you want
[11:30] to say it maybe a Christian maybe feeble
[11:34] maybe whatever the case may
[11:36] be let's put it this
[11:39] way I admire
[11:42] people who have a son or a daughter with
[11:47] an
[11:48] Affliction but they love that
[11:51] child they're not ashamed of that
[11:54] child and when I see that I think about
[11:57] myself or I think about those who who
[11:59] God is now transforming and changing
[12:03] because in the eyes of God because of
[12:06] sin we all are afflicted amen I mean in
[12:10] a way we all came into this world
[12:13] y'all understand what I'm
[12:15] saying because we didn't come in with
[12:17] the nature of God now I'm saying all of
[12:19] this thing to get to my point I want you
[12:22] to understand that we fail to see
[12:26] children are children
[12:29] they can't behave like adults amen
[12:32] that's right they don't have the mind of
[12:34] an adult amen the way they think is the
[12:38] way children think
[12:40] amen
[12:42] um we understand by God's
[12:45] grace how a family can be so divided
[12:49] like for
[12:52] example we didn't know or we would not
[12:54] have
[12:55] known except by Revelation that Cain and
[12:58] a were of two different
[13:01] seed yet they were in the same family by
[13:04] the by the by the
[13:06] mother and I really it's never in the
[13:09] scripture where Adam and Eve treated
[13:12] Cain
[13:14] differently it was only when Cain slew
[13:17] AEL we saw the the the
[13:22] division of the family because God
[13:24] divided them then am he separated them
[13:28] and usually that's what happens you know
[13:31] when we came to Christ I I myself can
[13:34] say by the grace of God I'm the only one
[13:36] in this
[13:37] message God separated me from my family
[13:42] natural and then he gave me a a family
[13:45] of my own and I rais my family in the
[13:49] ammonition of the Lord they may not all
[13:52] be serving God at this time but I
[13:55] believe that every one of my
[13:57] children has been given to me by God
[14:00] Amen and at one day God will bring them
[14:03] to the
[14:04] Foe and so I said that to say this when
[14:09] we talk about unconditional love it is
[14:12] what God is requiring of us amen toward
[14:16] our
[14:17] families easy said than
[14:20] done no man can do it on his own only
[14:25] the Holy Spirit can take you to that
[14:28] level level of
[14:30] love now we people say well you know
[14:34] let's say this for example somebody
[14:36] offend you and you say
[14:38] okay I forgive them but I don't even
[14:40] want to see them no more no well that's
[14:43] not true you did not forgive them amen
[14:45] that's right because forgiveness also
[14:48] bring about restoration amen and when
[14:52] something is restored that means it
[14:54] comes back to its original position
[14:57] whether it be a brother whether it be a
[14:58] sister whether it be a cousin whatever
[15:01] it is amen uh when forgiveness is cuz
[15:04] that's what happens when God forgives us
[15:06] he brings us to the place to the to the
[15:09] proper place from which we fell in other
[15:11] words he doesn't bring us to a lesser
[15:14] place he he restores us to to the very
[15:17] level that we were at before we F fell
[15:22] so I'm saying all of this because when
[15:24] God came to
[15:25] Abel uh when God came to Caan's asked
[15:29] him you know where is
[15:32] Abel and that amazes me where is Abel
[15:35] thy brother and Cain responded with I
[15:39] know not am I My Brother's
[15:42] Keeper so with his question he
[15:49] answered the the he answered back to God
[15:53] the reason why God asked him because you
[15:56] are your brother's keeper amen we are
[15:59] even in this family of God we are each
[16:02] other's keeper the Bible said if you see
[16:05] your brother do something wrong you go
[16:07] to him in what love that you might do
[16:10] what restore him that's the way it works
[16:14] it didn't say go call
[16:17] Suzie which a lot of people do or scorn
[16:21] Suzy or get mad at Susie because I'm
[16:24] going to say it like this we all have
[16:26] come short of the glory of God Amen
[16:30] every one of us the battle today are not
[16:33] with flesh it's not flesh and blood that
[16:35] we're battling and I think often time as
[16:37] Christians we forget I forget you know
[16:41] what I'm saying somebody you know
[16:42] especially when it comes to children we
[16:44] look at children when they do wrong we
[16:46] want to we want to we want to drive that
[16:48] devil
[16:51] away but you know love conquers
[16:54] it love is greater than a rod
[16:59] it really is and often time we pass on
[17:04] traditions instead of seeking God on how
[17:07] to handle certain situations we
[17:10] ourselves become carnal that's right you
[17:13] understand and we understand by the
[17:15] grace of God and by this message we are
[17:17] to never spank children in our anger
[17:22] amen that's where that's where a lot of
[17:25] things come in uh un um
[17:29] unforeseen
[17:32] hurts now turn with me to Ephesians 6:12
[17:36] we're about ready to get into our lesson
[17:39] now we understand by the grace of God
[17:40] education cannot we can't be educated
[17:44] into
[17:46] love matter of fact education is the
[17:49] thing that divides most
[17:51] families even in the time of of of when
[17:54] God uh put Cain out he went the educated
[17:58] way
[18:00] and I'm not wrong I'm not saying
[18:01] anything wrong with education but most
[18:03] times when people get educated they get
[18:05] puffed up Pride becomes their their lord
[18:09] and most people think that they're
[18:11] better than someone else because of
[18:14] education and you can look throughout
[18:16] Every Nation whether it be India whether
[18:19] it be Africa whether it be Europe
[18:20] whether it be it was
[18:22] always the rich the educated the
[18:26] knowledgeable ones and those little ones
[18:29] that didn't know anything and they could
[18:31] be
[18:32] family but the but the well- educated
[18:35] didn't want to fellowship with the
[18:37] ignorant see that that's what made Jesus
[18:42] different he went to the low class he
[18:44] went to the rejected he went into the
[18:47] uneducated people he fellowship with the
[18:50] people the
[18:52] priest and all of his clan wouldn't have
[18:55] nothing to do with amen and see you got
[18:59] to understand what family is because the
[19:01] Bible said
[19:03] Jesus seeketh those he went to seek his
[19:08] sheep and he could care less where they
[19:11] were most of his sheep in the
[19:15] beginning were poor they didn't have
[19:18] much they were uneducated you know I
[19:21] can't imagine what people thought when
[19:23] they saw Jesus and the 12
[19:26] disciples he looked like a
[19:29] you know first of all he was
[19:31] homeless y'all know that right so that's
[19:33] how come Jesus can relate to the
[19:35] homeless people cuz he was homeless the
[19:38] Bible said foxes have holes uh uh birds
[19:40] have nests but the son of man have no
[19:42] place to lay his head so we understand
[19:46] by the grace of God the more
[19:50] educated or the more people think they
[19:53] are in that real it becomes a real
[19:57] danger zone for them God is Not doesn't
[20:01] wink at at at he he's not like against
[20:05] education because we have some the
[20:08] most like like like Daniel Brilliant
[20:13] Paul brilliant Luke brilliant just
[20:16] brilliant people educated people but
[20:20] they knew where the education was coming
[20:24] from and they understood they were
[20:26] nothing without God
[20:29] even Paul said with all of my learning I
[20:32] count this thing as D because I want to
[20:35] know Jesus Christ in the power in his
[20:38] suffering and in the power of his
[20:40] resurrection now Ephesians 612 goes on
[20:43] to say for we Ral not against flesh and
[20:45] blood but against principalities against
[20:48] power against the rulers of the darkness
[20:51] of this world against spiritual
[20:53] wickedness in high
[20:55] places and uh this is the thing that we
[20:58] must keep F we we keep our eyes focused
[21:03] because offenses will
[21:06] come you know I don't care how oh I love
[21:09] you I love you but offense is going to
[21:11] come offenses come between husband and
[21:14] wife offenses come between children and
[21:16] mother children and father I mean it's
[21:18] going to come the Bible said it's going
[21:20] to come so there's nothing that can stop
[21:23] it but God looks at our reaction to the
[21:27] offenses
[21:29] education can't do it matter of fact
[21:32] most of the time if we look at it it is
[21:34] the thing that that divides the people
[21:36] the knowledge right I'm saying all of
[21:39] this thing because a horse doesn't need
[21:42] to be educated on how to love its Pony a
[21:45] cow doesn't need how to be educated to
[21:48] learn to love his calf all of the animal
[21:51] kingdom birds birds will attack a human
[21:55] when it comes to their little chicken or
[21:59] whatever you want to say it right I've
[22:01] been running and and not even knowing
[22:03] I'm by birds and n and here they come
[22:05] trying to hit me in the head right
[22:08] Innocent but they have that nature that
[22:11] they would will they would take on
[22:12] almost The
[22:15] Impossible challenged to actually
[22:17] protect their
[22:21] children most mothers have that instinct
[22:24] most fathers have that instinct but not
[22:28] all
[22:29] yall understand what I'm saying and that
[22:31] is a natural
[22:34] response what about the spiritual
[22:37] because the spiritual
[22:38] response uh when it comes to the mother
[22:40] and the father has to be on a higher
[22:44] plane I'm learning myself and I'll be
[22:48] honest with you if I had to go back and
[22:50] teach my children over there's so many
[22:53] other things or new things that I see
[22:56] that I
[22:57] would teach teach them but it would be
[23:01] based upon
[23:02] love mercy and Grace
[23:06] amen because that's how God is teaching
[23:10] me right now coming from the message
[23:13] things that are to be paragraph
[23:16] 55 now in the world that we live in this
[23:20] education I want to prove to you
[23:23] education science civilization and all
[23:26] these things that we seemingly so
[23:28] enjoyed today is of Satan why are you
[23:32] bringing this brother because often time
[23:35] we go to science to help us in our
[23:38] spiritual man when all we need is
[23:42] God we do we think science can help us
[23:48] but in reality it's like taking a pill
[23:51] that's going to make things worse in the
[23:54] long run and I say that because amen I
[23:58] know I know I'm I'm working with Spirits
[24:01] now I'm not natural I'm not carnal I'm
[24:03] working with spiritual because every
[24:06] problem in the in the in the way of a
[24:08] man or woman is spiritual
[24:12] amen call it whatever you want to but
[24:16] every demon that
[24:18] torments is a
[24:21] devil physically spiritually mentally
[24:26] however want to say it and the cure to
[24:29] all of this is divine love amen love
[24:34] conquers
[24:36] all whether it be in you or outside of
[24:39] You Love Will Conquer All right now all
[24:43] these things Satan he says listen and
[24:46] all these things that we seemingly to
[24:49] enjoy today is of Satan and will perish
[24:53] you say brother brother brandham
[24:55] civilization yes sir civilization comes
[24:58] by Satan Genesis 4 proves it kon's son
[25:03] see started the civilization building
[25:05] cities and organs and so forth and
[25:08] civilization came by what knowledge
[25:11] knowledge is what the devil sold Eve in
[25:13] the Garden of Eden that causes her to
[25:16] cramp uh transgress
[25:20] God's
[25:22] Commandments and I think about people
[25:26] who
[25:28] are in places right now that don't even
[25:30] know their right hand from their left
[25:33] they may be tribal people but they love
[25:35] each other amen they will face uh lions
[25:39] or whatever the case may be to protect
[25:42] their families and we with education you
[25:44] know what we'll do we'll judge it and
[25:49] run
[25:50] yeah but I find out it was one of the
[25:53] things that I learned when I went to
[25:56] India at night went to find those people
[26:00] who were really in need instead of
[26:03] working with because in India they have
[26:05] people out there on the streets that
[26:07] fakes it but we went to see and then we
[26:11] were passing out some candy and stuff
[26:13] and those little boys that we had given
[26:16] something to they
[26:18] ran I didn't know where they were
[26:20] running to I just thought they were
[26:21] happy that they had candy next thing I
[26:24] know we was about almost about ready to
[26:25] be Stampede they went and got their
[26:28] buddies their family to me that touched
[26:31] me than more than anything you know
[26:34] because it's like me if or you
[26:37] especially in America you you win a
[26:39] jackpot you know you going to keep it
[26:41] Hush
[26:42] Hush you don't want nobody know that you
[26:45] done won the lottery or whatever the
[26:47] case may be but not those people see all
[26:51] they
[26:52] had they had such a love and that thing
[26:55] was to
[26:56] survive and they went and ran and got
[26:58] their friends I don't know how close of
[27:01] a relatives they were to each other but
[27:03] I knew one thing they came together as
[27:06] one
[27:07] amen with the hands out it was a
[27:11] blessing to me I was thinking to myself
[27:14] who is the rich
[27:16] man right so I'm coming to you one thing
[27:20] I can truly say about my mother nobody
[27:24] in my family could ever say that my
[27:27] mother did not love them now they didn't
[27:31] treat her right they didn't respect her
[27:34] they didn't honor her but she had the
[27:37] ability to give her children love and we
[27:40] were
[27:43] poor and to this day I believe because
[27:46] and now don't get me wrong my mother was
[27:48] a Christian so she had something to give
[27:50] us and that was
[27:53] Christ children obey your parents that's
[27:56] the first verse
[27:59] of this
[28:00] uh lesson tonight children obey your
[28:04] parent in the Lord for this is
[28:08] right but we know that in science or in
[28:12] education children have a right not to
[28:16] obey their parents that's right but when
[28:18] it comes to God that's the right thing
[28:21] to do if a child and I God is my witness
[28:25] I stand my mother thought I sat at her
[28:28] one time and I was just correcting her I
[28:30] didn't realize that was sassing she
[28:33] slapped me and and it wasn't a slap that
[28:35] hurt me it was the fact that she thought
[28:37] I was talking back to her I think to
[28:40] talk back to your mother as a child is
[28:43] so disrespectful to God as well as to
[28:46] your parent it is something that I know
[28:49] that once the Holy Ghost feels a child
[28:52] they don't do that and if they would
[28:55] ever let it slip they immediately make
[28:57] it right oh I'm sorry Mom I'm sorry Dad
[29:01] right cuz though in my day we had such a
[29:03] law and a rule that was a fearful thing
[29:07] there is no way that you're going to
[29:08] talk back to your mom and dad without
[29:11] your mom and dad coming after you that
[29:14] was the way it was so most children in
[29:17] my day was
[29:18] afraid to talk back or respond to their
[29:22] parents in a diff in a disrespectful way
[29:25] and my mother used to say which is which
[29:27] is so true
[29:28] say when a child is
[29:30] disobedient and disrespect their parents
[29:33] you shorten your days on
[29:35] Earth God Cuts your day short that is
[29:39] the truth honor thy father and thy
[29:42] mother now you got to understand what
[29:44] I'm saying we don't wrestle against
[29:46] flesh and blood it's spiritual
[29:48] wickedness in high places principalities
[29:51] and
[29:52] Powers because your father and your
[29:54] mother is maybe not what you want them
[29:56] to be I've had a father that didn't do
[30:00] much for me but I loved my father I
[30:02] always honored him and I never
[30:05] disrespected him no matter how bad he
[30:08] was he was a drunkard to be honest with
[30:10] you and uh but I always gave him respect
[30:13] now my other siblings they did not y'all
[30:17] understand what I'm saying I'm saying
[30:19] the power of the Holy Ghost will change
[30:21] you amen that's the only one that's the
[30:23] only only uh uh God is the only one that
[30:26] can put you in your right position honor
[30:30] thy father and thy mother because listen
[30:32] if you don't honor your father and your
[30:33] mother you're not going to honor nobody
[30:36] else if you disrespect your mother and
[30:39] your father you're going to disrespect
[30:41] everybody else that's why you see
[30:43] children when they bad in school they
[30:45] bad at
[30:46] home when you can't rule them in school
[30:49] they because they unruly at home that's
[30:52] the way it
[30:54] works right honor thy father mother
[30:58] which is the first commandment with
[31:02] promise because the Lord said if you
[31:04] honor your mother and your father your
[31:05] days will be long
[31:09] amen now we understand that I'm I'm
[31:11] working on the children now but I'm
[31:13] coming to the parents in in a moment
[31:15] because we as parents and I have been
[31:18] guilty in my life we provoke our
[31:20] children by the way we do things or by
[31:22] the way we say things you don't and
[31:25] sometimes I know we we we judge by sight
[31:29] we accuse them of things that they're
[31:31] not guilty of then all of a sudden
[31:33] there's a problem everybody does it or
[31:37] everybody have done it the Bible said
[31:40] that it may be well with thee and that
[31:44] thou may live long on the
[31:48] earth I had people in my
[31:52] class who I I I assume because they were
[31:55] so bad out in the world I assume they
[31:57] were in other words they died early May
[32:01] 20 21 22 died
[32:04] young doing bad
[32:06] things and most of the time when when
[32:09] you people get caught doing bad things
[32:11] is because they never take took heed to
[32:14] the warning of their mother and their
[32:17] father and ye father provoke not your
[32:20] children to
[32:22] wrath and this is what I've
[32:25] learned in my in my
[32:29] uh in my time of living on the
[32:33] earth we were always
[32:35] told well Daddy why should I do that
[32:38] because I told you I I'm telling you to
[32:40] do it but that's not
[32:42] right it's not because you you need to
[32:45] explain to
[32:47] me why I'm doing this or why you want me
[32:50] to do this I mean you just don't use up
[32:52] Authority like you can do it but what
[32:54] does that do it provokes a child to
[32:57] Wrath
[32:58] because they don't understand why you
[32:59] telling because in their minds they
[33:01] think they may even think it's silly to
[33:03] do it you understand what I'm saying
[33:05] they may not understand what you're
[33:07] doing so when you just use Authority
[33:09] like that we call it nowadays
[33:12] bullying but that's that was not the
[33:16] intent the intent was Direction and
[33:19] guidance don't go that way because cause
[33:22] right you learn to express and explains
[33:25] to Children why you telling them because
[33:28] if if you do this this will harm you if
[33:32] you don't turn from this direction it's
[33:34] going to it's going to it's going to
[33:36] really put you in a bad position or you
[33:38] know I'll put it this way there were
[33:41] times my mother would see friends of
[33:44] mine I call friends and she said
[33:49] Junior those people are not your
[33:51] friends but because I was in my teenage
[33:54] years I'm
[33:55] grown you know that's the way we think I
[33:58] mean and we don't realize we're not
[33:59] grown till you get older you realize oh
[34:02] my God I thought I knew it I no you
[34:04] don't you just think you know it that's
[34:07] your hormones thinking you think making
[34:09] you think that way and but I'm going
[34:11] tell you my mother was
[34:14] right and down the road because I
[34:16] wouldn't let those friends go down the
[34:18] road who gets
[34:20] hurt
[34:22] me and those people proved to me they
[34:26] were not my friend
[34:28] so parents have Insight they have
[34:31] experience and therefore that's why you
[34:33] supposed to respect them because they
[34:36] have more experience they have lived
[34:38] longer they've been into through all
[34:40] kinds of stuff St stuff that you haven't
[34:42] gone through matter of fact my wife and
[34:44] I we could join together in un Unity
[34:47] because we taught our children we tried
[34:49] to keep them away from the harmful
[34:52] things but because they didn't
[34:55] listen they have been entrapped many of
[34:57] them
[34:58] them but it's not our
[35:00] fault the reason why I said it like this
[35:03] because they never honored us as father
[35:05] and mother amen that's right because
[35:08] when you honor somebody as father and
[35:10] mother you don't necessarily understand
[35:13] why but you are obedient that's how it
[35:15] is with God you you are obedient because
[35:18] you know they know what they're talking
[35:21] about right is this okay any questions
[35:28] okay
[35:37] yes it it's leaning to your own
[35:40] understanding basically he wants you to
[35:43] be obedient and not take another way
[35:45] because you think it's going to please
[35:47] him remember what Saul did God told Saul
[35:50] to kill everything and Saul within
[35:53] himself thought by the influence of the
[35:56] people if I saved the king and most and
[36:00] the best of the animals God would be
[36:03] pleased no God is not pleased with your
[36:08] sacrifice he's only pleased with
[36:11] obedience obeying his word matter of
[36:14] fact he said when you do that when you
[36:17] know that word and you go beyond that
[36:21] intentionally that
[36:23] stubbornness and that stubbornness is as
[36:26] witchcraft in the Eyes Of
[36:28] God it's a serious
[36:32] offense it's like anything we do when
[36:35] God say don't do it I'm not I'm going to
[36:37] do it anyway with that stubbornness then
[36:40] God looks at you as you as though you
[36:42] have been influenced by witchcraft you
[36:44] are
[36:45] Bewitched because a foolish
[36:48] person is going to do that kind of a
[36:50] thing right A wise man going to keep his
[36:54] Commandments a foolish person will lean
[36:57] to their own
[36:58] understanding God knows God understand
[37:01] that kind of a thing children do that we
[37:04] all do it I remember one time and I I
[37:08] don't want to take up too much time I
[37:10] got to move forward but I remember one
[37:13] time I had a friend who who got my mom
[37:16] told me not to hang out with he cored me
[37:20] to go to the movies we went to the
[37:22] movies it was Daylight we went and saw
[37:25] the whole movie when we came out it was
[37:27] p pitch black dark and I knew back in
[37:30] the day we didn't have cell
[37:31] phones so you know parents were
[37:35] worried and you know all I could think
[37:38] about is when I get home what kind of
[37:39] lie I can
[37:41] tell I was scared now I was scared cuz I
[37:44] knew I was going to get a whipping she
[37:47] told me not to do it the thing is that
[37:50] the guy that got me into trouble didn't
[37:51] get the whipping or punishment I got in
[37:55] trouble right and every lie I tried to
[37:59] tell she says no we've been there
[38:02] already so there was no way for me to
[38:05] get out of it but I would have never
[38:07] gone that way I never would have had to
[38:09] do that because that individual was like
[38:12] the devil to me you know what I mean
[38:14] though he was a friend he was telling me
[38:15] to go opposite to what my mom said
[38:18] anybody that teaches you to go opposite
[38:20] to your parents and you know your
[38:22] parents is telling you the truth is not
[38:24] a
[38:26] friend it's not a
[38:29] friend it's the enemy using that person
[38:33] and when you go contrary who going to be
[38:37] hurt
[38:41] you and that's so true your friends will
[38:44] get you in trouble but they can't get
[38:46] you
[38:49] out that's the way it
[38:55] works that's what happened to me
[38:58] I
[38:59] learn obedience through the things I
[39:03] suffered I'm just going
[39:05] to right and ye fathers provoke not your
[39:10] children to wrath but bring them up in
[39:12] the nurture and ammonition of the Lord
[39:15] you know what nurturing is it means
[39:16] little by little you know you don't
[39:18] stuffing with this and stuffing with
[39:20] that you you nurturing is like you you
[39:23] handling things with
[39:25] care you know your counseling is with
[39:27] care your counseling you know is not all
[39:30] rude and you know abrupt you know
[39:33] forceful it's it's nurturing little it's
[39:36] like when you nurture a plant or an
[39:38] animal you give a little milk at a time
[39:41] and and and that's the way it's supposed
[39:42] to be with your children um like I said
[39:46] I can say this because I can look back
[39:47] and see where I fail in these areas but
[39:51] now that I see I can tell people
[39:54] listen if we don't learn how to love our
[39:56] children
[39:58] we can't even love
[39:59] ourselves and most of the time when we
[40:02] don't love ourselves we can't love our
[40:04] children and all of us at some point in
[40:06] time will be parents if the Lord should
[40:09] carry and one thing I know that even in
[40:13] the animal kingdom they'll give their
[40:16] life for their sibling or for their
[40:18] their
[40:19] offspring that's what we do that's even
[40:22] in the animal so what about the
[40:25] spiritual
[40:27] right this is what I love about
[40:30] God that prodal son was as bad as he can
[40:35] be the Bible said he went off and he got
[40:39] came to himself he's getting ready to
[40:41] eat the
[40:42] slop pig slop he's already laying out
[40:45] there with
[40:46] him but he came to himself and he said
[40:50] to himself you know I got a
[40:54] father my father is rich
[40:59] I don't know whether he will accept me
[41:00] back as a son but I I'll present myself
[41:03] to him as a
[41:05] servant and the Bible said when that
[41:08] prodal son turned to come back home the
[41:11] father was waiting and the father saw
[41:14] him coming and ran to him I love that
[41:18] song that's that's the only time I seen
[41:20] him run and he ran to that prodal son
[41:24] and and the prodical son was telling him
[41:26] Lord I be a servant I'll be and God and
[41:29] and and the father says you can't be a
[41:31] servant because you're a
[41:33] son and and he says go go prepare about
[41:36] the Fatt C whatever we're going to have
[41:39] a banquet slip that rang on his finger
[41:41] what happened he was
[41:43] restored amen back to his position in
[41:47] which he was supposed to be cuz he never
[41:49] was he was always a son even if he was
[41:52] eating pig
[41:53] slop but you know the TR truth of the
[41:56] matter is is when we see people in the
[41:58] family of God and they go backslide you
[42:02] know when they come back you don't see
[42:04] that welome
[42:05] welcoming but it should
[42:08] be that love should be oh I'm so glad
[42:11] you overcame I'm so glad you came back
[42:13] let's help you get back to your position
[42:17] let's celebrate y y'all know what I mean
[42:20] we don't do that but as a family this is
[42:24] where it should be our love should be I
[42:27] don't care what you did out there it's
[42:30] is in the past now let's go forward you
[42:33] a son you a daughter of God love on each
[42:37] other that's what family is all
[42:40] about and Jesus proved it Peter denied
[42:43] him three times cursed while he was
[42:46] doing it that's right but Jesus says I
[42:49] can't go any further that's my son amen
[42:52] that's one of mine and before we go any
[42:55] further y'all make sure y'all bring
[42:57] Peter you understand me and that's where
[43:01] it should be we should never say oh they
[43:03] get over it or you know just let
[43:05] somebody walk out the door and not even
[43:07] think about them not even call them not
[43:09] even go after them that's
[43:12] family people people are
[43:17] family living for others as I said the
[43:19] other other service we must learn how to
[43:22] live for others amen and we all the only
[43:25] way that would help us we we need to
[43:27] learn how to put ourselves in other
[43:29] people's position that could have been
[43:31] me
[43:33] amen when you can stablish that kind of
[43:35] thought in your mind then you have the
[43:37] compassion that you need to have one for
[43:40] another fathers don't provoke
[43:42] them and I've done it in the past you
[43:46] know I'm the kind of person you
[43:49] know I rarely when I when I get angry
[43:52] I'm angry it's slow to angry but I once
[43:54] I get there it's kind of hard to pull me
[43:57] back out of that
[43:59] realm uh one thing I hate is disrespect
[44:02] from a child I don't care who you
[44:05] are and I think God feels the same way
[44:08] he doesn't like
[44:10] disrespect and the first thing I think
[44:12] about when someone disrespect me is what
[44:15] did I do to deserve this
[44:20] dishonor and my thoughts is hav not been
[44:23] this hav not been that hav not been but
[44:25] you see that's man that that's not the
[44:27] way I should be doing it that's not the
[44:29] way it should be
[44:32] done why should I
[44:34] care they called him a devil they sped
[44:38] on him he said nothing and I think
[44:41] sometimes we we we live too much we got
[44:43] too much flesh amen and our pride Rises
[44:47] up and then that gets us in trouble
[44:49] because you ain't talking to me like
[44:50] that who do you think you are you know
[44:53] that's the way we do and the next thing
[44:55] you know I'm coming at you
[44:58] but that's what we do but that's not the
[45:01] proper
[45:02] way we wrestle not against flesh and
[45:05] blood when you see a person acting in
[45:07] the wrong way you must recognize this is
[45:11] spiritual and if I don't handle it in a
[45:13] spiritual way it's going to get bad
[45:16] somebody's going to get hurt words could
[45:18] be said that cannot be taken
[45:21] back and that's what we this is where
[45:23] Satan comes in to divide education can't
[45:26] do that
[45:27] I don't care what psychiatrist you go
[45:29] through they can give you some reasoning
[45:31] and both most of the time they're going
[45:32] to tell you what you already know
[45:35] because you done told them the problem
[45:36] in the
[45:37] beginning and they're going to just
[45:39] reord it to make it sound like they
[45:42] telling you something that you didn't
[45:44] tell them but you told them that when
[45:45] you first they said what what's your
[45:49] problem and then you spew everything out
[45:52] and then they reroute that thing and
[45:53] come back and tell you the same thing
[45:55] you said and then they going to give you
[45:57] some kind of
[45:59] Solution that's not going to work
[46:00] because the psychiatrist go to
[46:02] psychiatrist themselves for help amen
[46:04] that's right and the only M mind
[46:07] regulator is Jesus amen hallelujah
[46:11] because I'm going to tell you what a
[46:12] psychi is going to do they're going to
[46:14] take you all the way in your path and
[46:16] bring up all those
[46:18] hurts and then they when that all those
[46:20] hurts come up then you going to remember
[46:23] all it's like a nightmare amen that's
[46:26] right it's a nightmare nightmare amen
[46:28] and I'm going to say it like this by the
[46:30] grace of God if it's buried keep it
[46:32] there
[46:35] amen cuz I'm G tell you something I've
[46:37] done it the best times I the the person
[46:40] I've he's my
[46:42] psychiatrist and I could tell him about
[46:43] my hurt and he's the only one that I
[46:46] have been able to tell him everything
[46:49] and then get off my knees with a piece
[46:50] at heart amen and a peace at mind
[46:54] Hallelujah I'm telling you that's the
[46:56] way it works
[46:57] and you got to understand that like we
[46:59] said he'll be to you whatever you let
[47:01] him be that's true that is the
[47:04] truth right
[47:07] [Laughter]
[47:10] brother yes
[47:13] sir you know I just
[47:17] wonder you know how we treat people
[47:27] is a lot
[47:30] of yes
[47:33] Amen brother sister different when here
[47:40] praising God if they
[47:50] fall there right did y'all hear him
[47:57] can you can you stand up and repeat that
[48:00] pardon can you stand and repeat that and
[48:02] face them
[48:03] oh all what
[48:07] thinking our
[48:09] relation Brothers ands onily
[48:57] and that's true that's true because I've
[49:01] had people say well when I was at church
[49:02] you didn't care to talk to
[49:05] me right so they want to know why you
[49:07] want to talk to me now because they
[49:09] thinking you just want to talk gossip I
[49:12] I mean they don't trust you because when
[49:14] I was there you didn't help me you
[49:15] didn't talk to me you didn't see me you
[49:17] didn't love me then so what make me what
[49:20] why would you think I I'm going to
[49:21] believe that you love me
[49:23] now see so that that is exactly how it
[49:27] works you know and that's why it's so
[49:29] important that listen you can't I I
[49:33] always say this in order to have friends
[49:35] you got to show yourself friendly
[49:39] amen and you got to you got to reach out
[49:41] to people and some
[49:43] people because of their hurts and past
[49:46] experiences they're not so open to you
[49:50] but you don't stop there you got to keep
[49:53] moving and keep doing it so they can see
[49:56] that you have a personal
[49:58] interest and it's not something that you
[50:00] want from them to gain something but
[50:03] because you care you'll be surprised
[50:06] with a little card sister so and so I
[50:09] was thinking about you when I was in The
[50:10] Hobby and I got you this card or brother
[50:14] and you'd be surprised well I've noticed
[50:16] that I don't see many people talking
[50:18] with you but I want you to know that I
[50:20] care just things like that that's family
[50:23] now we'll do it to each other at times
[50:25] like you know
[50:28] different holidays or I'm thinking of
[50:30] you that kind of a thing but I think
[50:32] when it comes to the church
[50:34] family we need to do more of it amen
[50:38] more of it now let me move on listen in
[50:41] the fifth chapter fifth verse it says
[50:43] that's really good brother Rich that's
[50:45] really really good on a daily basis we
[50:47] need to learn how to reach out to one
[50:50] another servants be obedient to them
[50:53] that are your Masters according to the
[50:56] father flesh now I want to use this word
[50:58] servant because we know in America and a
[51:02] lot of places they use that word as a
[51:06] slave but you see in the Old Testament
[51:09] it's the kind of
[51:11] slave many of the colonizers used they
[51:14] went and they stole people that was evil
[51:16] that was wrong now when it comes
[51:20] to the Hebrew servant or slave is
[51:23] because they owed a debt
[51:26] and so because they owed a debt that was
[51:28] the way they had to pay it and then at
[51:31] the sound of the
[51:32] Jubilee they were free to go y'all
[51:36] understand me but when it comes to the
[51:38] old when it comes to the Old Testament
[51:39] Look up the word if you want to go look
[51:41] it up called men Steelers stealing a man
[51:44] that's how it says that's evil that's
[51:48] wrong right this is not the kind of
[51:51] servant he's talking about this is not
[51:53] the kind of slave he's talking about
[51:54] he's talking about a servant who owes a
[51:57] debt know he owes the debt and he needs
[52:00] to pay for it servant be obedient to
[52:04] them that are of your Masters but that
[52:07] scripture was
[52:09] twisted to
[52:11] to how could I say it to to to
[52:16] to fortify their narrative but that's
[52:19] not what it was supposed to
[52:21] be maybe one day I I'll do a little
[52:24] subject on that but that's that's the
[52:26] way it was it wasn't talking about the
[52:29] kind of slave that was stolen talking
[52:31] about the slave that owe the debt and
[52:33] throughout the New Testament you'll find
[52:35] that in the gospel those who owed debt
[52:37] and had to pay
[52:40] right not not about men Stealers people
[52:43] who stole men made them slaves that's a
[52:46] different story altogether God really
[52:48] frowned on that servants be obedient to
[52:50] them that are your Masters according to
[52:52] the flesh with fear and trembling
[52:56] singleness of your heart as unto Christ
[53:00] not with I service y'all know what I
[53:03] service
[53:04] is when somebody tell you something I
[53:07] can't you can't see your smile and then
[53:08] you roll your
[53:14] [Laughter]
[53:16] eyes or you give them that look you know
[53:19] your eyes
[53:20] talk that's our
[53:22] service you can even say tell somebody
[53:25] who you think you talking to
[53:26] [Laughter]
[53:33] that's that's all
[53:35] wrong not with our service as men
[53:38] Pleasers but as the servant of Christ
[53:42] doing the will of God from the heart
[53:45] don't don't don't don't
[53:47] uh get frustrated when
[53:51] when it let's put it this way even in
[53:54] your job when your when he's your Master
[53:57] you're a servant on the job your boss
[54:00] man is your master and you supposed to
[54:03] serve him as you would unto Christ yeah
[54:08] why he going to ask me to take out the
[54:11] trash ain't nobody else doing nothing
[54:13] look at them but he going to come ask me
[54:16] well God anointed him to ask
[54:18] you you're the one that needs
[54:23] character see what I'm saying he's
[54:25] building you to the character is
[54:27] building you and so you got to say okay
[54:29] because listen when you know God is
[54:30] giving you a job you got to do it as
[54:32] unto the Lord amen not to the man that's
[54:35] over you or the woman that's over you as
[54:37] unto the
[54:41] Lord
[54:42] right with Good Will doing Service as to
[54:46] the Lord and not to
[54:48] men knowing that whatsoever good thing
[54:52] any man doeth the same shall he receive
[54:55] of the Lord whether it be Bond or free
[54:59] and you can take that all the way down
[55:01] through the Old Testament through the
[55:03] Hebrew children everybody that obeyed
[55:07] even even they were men Stealers but
[55:09] even when they were in bondage to
[55:12] Babylon those Hebrew boys Daniel and all
[55:15] they served their masters as unto the
[55:18] Lord amen
[55:20] right but their masters weren't beating
[55:23] him and doing all that kind of stuff
[55:24] y'all understand me it's it's a totally
[55:26] different uh mindset that went on in our
[55:30] world today all is of the devil
[55:33] amen there's nobody to blame all is of
[55:36] the
[55:36] devil and the devil had to do whatever
[55:39] he had to do to bring this Kingdom to
[55:42] where he wants it to
[55:43] be but now you are the Bride of Jesus
[55:47] Christ Hallelujah and you and I must
[55:49] learn how to be obedient to God Amen not
[55:53] to men amen Lord I'm going to do because
[55:56] you want me you know once you build that
[56:00] then all it becomes automatic right it
[56:03] becomes automatic knowing you know that
[56:06] God is God is going to reward you anyway
[56:09] and ye Masters do the same thing unto
[56:11] them for bearing threatenings excuse me
[56:15] and ye Master do the same thing unto
[56:17] them for bearing threatenings knowing
[56:19] that your master also in heaven neither
[56:22] is their respective person with him
[56:26] right so understand even if you a boss
[56:30] you got to also be a kind of boss as God
[56:32] would be you can't just you know just
[56:35] have your own Constitution feeling like
[56:37] you can do whatever you want to do you
[56:40] got to everything we do children parents
[56:45] unto the Lord we must serve each other
[56:48] as unto the Lord amen we must work
[56:51] together as unto the Lord we must love
[56:53] each other as unto the Lord we must
[56:56] protect and this is what I love we must
[57:00] protect I remember when we we was a we
[57:03] were in the apostolic church and one of
[57:05] my sons was playing in the backyard and
[57:07] there's a little neighbor
[57:09] child out there he lik to run up and
[57:12] bite the kids when he ran and he he had
[57:15] his teeth into my my boy back or arm or
[57:18] whatever it
[57:19] was and and and gab was Gabriel I think
[57:22] it was was screaming the only way my
[57:24] wife could get that boy off was a smack
[57:31] him and then Daddy and Mama going to
[57:33] come out
[57:34] there I'm telling them
[57:36] myself I got more character
[57:39] now but back in that
[57:44] day they saw I wasn't afraid of them and
[57:47] we were getting ready it was going to be
[57:48] a real bad situation but my point is we
[57:53] were
[57:54] protecting ours and they knew we could
[57:57] get we could go deeper with this and
[58:00] have them arrested pretty much for
[58:03] letting that boy run and bite people cuz
[58:05] he was he was he was it was a common
[58:09] thing and they want to protect him and
[58:12] we weren't going to stand for that y'all
[58:15] understand me there are times that you
[58:17] have to stand for what you know it's
[58:20] right am and even though it is in a a
[58:23] way of a
[58:24] conflict you're going to have to to
[58:26] stand and not cow
[58:29] down God is always with you now as long
[58:32] as you're right
[58:35] amen finally my brother do what be
[58:38] strong in the Lord and in the power of
[58:42] His
[58:43] might
[58:44] right here what he says first John you
[58:47] don't have to go there I'm almost
[58:49] done 1 John 10-12 in this the children
[58:53] of God are manifest and the children of
[58:55] the devil whosoever doeth not
[58:58] righteousness is not of God neither he
[59:01] that loveth not his brother for in this
[59:04] for this is the message that you heard
[59:07] from the beginning that we should love
[59:10] one
[59:12] another it goes all the way back because
[59:15] if we love one another we respect one
[59:17] another if we love one another we will
[59:20] honor one another if we love one another
[59:22] we would protect one
[59:24] another if we love one another we'll
[59:27] fellowship with one another amen and you
[59:29] know what I'm saying there's nothing
[59:31] like family
[59:32] fellowship and even so when we have a
[59:35] church family fellowship that's good too
[59:38] because then you get a chance to meet or
[59:40] talk to people that you normally
[59:41] wouldn't talk to now I know some people
[59:43] have clicks but you should break that
[59:45] your love should go
[59:47] beyond
[59:51] clicks you understand me your love don't
[59:54] don't oh they in a click no go over
[59:56] there and become part of the
[59:59] click y'all know what I'm
[1:00:01] saying let them understand I'm your
[1:00:04] brother I'm your sister
[1:00:06] too easier said than
[1:00:09] done but your love for people because
[1:00:13] you know people are in bondage when they
[1:00:15] in
[1:00:16] clicks they're in bondage when they feel
[1:00:19] like their little group is better than
[1:00:21] another group that's wrong absolutely
[1:00:24] wrong dividing vision is of the
[1:00:27] devil God is calling everybody to Unity
[1:00:31] and you have to fight to keep
[1:00:33] it you love the Lord now listen I kind
[1:00:37] of if there be any questions any
[1:00:42] questions I thought what brother brother
[1:00:45] uh rich said was brilliant was
[1:00:49] wonderful what we do on a regular
[1:00:53] basis will also reflect
[1:00:56] down the road when someone else is
[1:00:59] in fall short Fall Away whatever the
[1:01:03] case may be and as a pastor I I don't
[1:01:05] know a lot of stuff but church people
[1:01:08] know
[1:01:09] everything and I think by the grace of
[1:01:11] God y'all should work in the capacity of
[1:01:13] loving one another and bringing people
[1:01:16] back to Christ instead of letting them
[1:01:18] float out the door find out what the
[1:01:20] issues are what the problem is and if
[1:01:23] those things can be resolved there your
[1:01:26] flesh they're your blood they're your
[1:01:28] people they're your family and you have
[1:01:31] to remember their family and not people
[1:01:34] that comes to the
[1:01:38] church am I making
[1:01:40] sense let's
[1:01:44] stand we'll finish up on this next week
[1:01:47] Lord's will uh putting on the whole arm
[1:01:50] of God that's a big subject
[1:01:56] but um you know I just say by the grace
[1:01:59] of God I've learned so much and I've
[1:02:02] seen a lot and you know I look at people
[1:02:05] and the reason why children are the way
[1:02:07] they are now is because they didn't get
[1:02:10] the proper teaching and the proper
[1:02:12] discipline and our schools our
[1:02:14] government our science has made them
[1:02:18] such because they get our kids more
[1:02:21] time than we they have more time with
[1:02:24] our children in school than we have
[1:02:26] so they can indoctrinate them into all
[1:02:28] kinds of stuff that we know is wrong and
[1:02:32] you know every cartoon you watch ain't
[1:02:33] good that's right I remember when the
[1:02:36] rug rats what they guess what the rug
[1:02:38] rats those bad kids they look like a
[1:02:43] nightmare they did but everybody was
[1:02:46] crazy about it but they didn't realize
[1:02:48] they would teach those things were
[1:02:49] teaching their children how to be
[1:02:53] bad yeah cuz you know we imitate
[1:02:55] everything thing everything Hollywood
[1:02:57] brings out people do it no matter how
[1:03:01] vile it may be they'll do it and so
[1:03:04] everything you got to watch with your
[1:03:06] children watch you can't just let them
[1:03:08] be to themselves if you're going to
[1:03:10] really nurture them that means you got
[1:03:13] to watch and pray and do whatever you
[1:03:16] can do to keep them in the straight in
[1:03:19] their way because if you don't they
[1:03:21] going to come up just like the worldly
[1:03:23] kids disobeying you and that's going to
[1:03:26] put you in a position cuz now you're
[1:03:28] going to have to find out a way to reach
[1:03:32] them don't give the world your
[1:03:37] children cuz once you give it to them
[1:03:40] give them to the world it's hard to get
[1:03:42] them
[1:03:45] back let's pray father God we thank you
[1:03:47] for your grace and your mercy we thank
[1:03:49] you for being so good to us Lord we ask
[1:03:52] oh God that you would have mercy upon us
[1:03:55] give us what we stand in need of cleanse
[1:03:57] us Lord God from all of our uh unbelief
[1:04:02] all of our Darkness anything in US Lord
[1:04:04] that isn't pleasing Lord we're pressing
[1:04:07] toward the mark of a high calling we're
[1:04:10] we're moving in that space of divine
[1:04:13] love we want it father we want it to
[1:04:16] fill us completely from head to toe
[1:04:19] every fiber of our being Let Your Love
[1:04:21] radiate from us Lord give us the grace
[1:04:25] and in this day have mercy upon us and
[1:04:28] give us the grace and the mercy to
[1:04:31] escape the raft that is to come place in
[1:04:33] our hearts oh God that Spirit of crying
[1:04:36] and sighing for the Abomination done in
[1:04:39] the city be merciful to us now in Jesus
