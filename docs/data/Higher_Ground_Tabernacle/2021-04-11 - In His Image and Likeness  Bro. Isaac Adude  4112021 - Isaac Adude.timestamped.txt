[40:37] our seventies reversal and set
[40:41] genesis chapter 1 verse 26 and 27
[40:43] genesis
[40:44] 17 the bible says and god
[40:48] said let us make let us make men in our
[40:51] image
[40:52] after our likeness and let them have
[40:55] dominion over the fish of the sea
[40:58] and over the fowls of the air and over
[41:01] the cattle
[41:02] and over all and over all of the um

[41:18] is
[41:33] [Music]
[41:36] amen let's go over to philippians
[41:48] philippians chapter 2 we read the verse
[41:50] 5.
[42:00] philippians verse 5.
[42:03] the bible says let this mind be in you
[42:06] which was also in christ jesus
[42:11] christ so now here the prophet says that
[42:13] the mind
[42:14] that the mind that paul is talking about
[42:16] is actually the life and the character
[42:18] of jesus
[42:25] christ so in other words lest this
[42:27] character or this this life that was in
[42:29] jesus being new
[42:32] [Music]
[42:35] amen let's go to uh to our last verse uh
[42:38] last book of the bible let's turn into
[42:40] ii peter chapter
[42:42] 2 verse 21 to 27 25.
[42:56] 20.
[43:04] second peter
[43:18] no actually it's first peter i'm sorry
[43:22] um first peter 2 21-25 25.
[43:28] i got lost for a moment
[43:33] first peter 2 uh first peter 2 21-25
[43:40] the bible says
[43:44] for even here unto where you
[43:47] where you called because christ also
[43:50] suffered for us
[43:51] leaving us an example that you should
[43:53] follow
[44:03] who did no scene neither was
[44:06] found
[44:13] who when he was revealed revealed
[44:15] revealed not again
[44:16] when he suffered he threatened not but
[44:19] he committed himself to him
[44:22] that judgeth righteously
[44:32] who his own self bear our sins
[44:35] in his own body on the tree that we
[44:38] being dead to see
[44:40] should live should live unto
[44:42] righteousness by whose drafts he were
[44:44] healed
[44:59] but are now returned unto the shepherd
[45:02] and bishop of our souls

[45:49] me for the lord

[46:00] open our hearts
[46:03] so that we can hear it thank you
[46:08] pray for our pastor

[46:15] lord at the end of the service father
[46:16] god bless you serve his spirit we will
[46:18] not miss to say thank you come on come
[46:20] on
[46:21] thank you father god for everything that
[46:22] you you already did for us
[46:26] thank you father god for the things that
[46:27] you are doing for us
[46:30] thank you father lord for the things
[46:32] that you will do for us
[46:34] jesus christ
[46:39] this morning i am i have a little
[46:42] subject that i wanted to
[46:44] talk about
[46:48] and it's in his image and his likeness
[46:54] in his image and his likeness that's an
[46:56] imagination
[46:58] you know i was inspired but uh the
[47:00] quotes
[47:01] brother brooks uh read uh
[47:05] on wednesday the week before eastern
[47:51] the jew was god expressing his own word
[47:54] through them
[47:58] because the hebrew children said
[48:01] our god is able to deliver us
[48:50] amen this this quote actually you know
[48:52] really inspired me
[48:54] to show my people you know i didn't stop
[48:56] thinking about this for the whole week
[49:01] and by god's grace we will build our uh
[49:03] um
[49:04] our sermon upon this one
[49:09] amen the book where uh in genesis
[49:11] chapter one where we read
[49:12] uh god is saying let us make
[49:16] men in our image and you know like after
[49:18] our likeness
[49:23] so that this man will have dominion over
[49:26] the fish of the sea
[49:38] this is this was actually the perfect
[49:40] image or the perfect man that god
[49:43] you know wanted us to be it's a city
[49:45] long perfect to juvenile
[49:46] you know this is what god this is what
[49:49] we have to be
[49:50] that's a school or the place that we
[49:52] have to reach
[49:54] london you know to be in the image of
[49:57] god
[49:58] unimaginable you know to have dominion
[50:00] over all the entire earth
[50:04] you know to reflect god reflected you to
[50:07] reflect his character
[50:09] because if you read the if you listen to
[50:11] the prophet in the message
[50:12] identification
[50:17] you will see that the prophet spent more
[50:19] time talking about the character of
[50:21] jesus
[50:25] you know that's why paul said that let
[50:26] this mind that was in jesus christ
[50:32] in other words let this character or
[50:34] just let this life that was in jesus be
[50:37] also in you
[50:38] character
[50:44] the very weight i mean the true way to
[50:46] see the character of jesus is in this
[50:48] bible in this word
[50:52] and my prayer is that so that in the
[50:54] entire church when they will be reading
[50:56] the bible
[50:59] you know they can see them themselves
[51:02] reflected
[51:03] it's a white women reflected in so that
[51:06] they can be the mirror
[51:07] the mirror of god you know the prophet
[51:10] gave this story of
[51:11] of this young man the prophet you know
[51:14] this young man i mean it was a little
[51:15] boy
[51:17] in his house they didn't have any mirror
[51:19] you know
[51:33] and then he saw something you know like
[51:36] you know he saw another boy
[51:38] well he said well let me go and then you
[51:40] know talk to this boss so that we can be
[51:42] friends
[51:42] yeah you know what i mean walking he was
[51:45] walking toward him
[51:48] and then he says that this boy this
[51:49] other boy was walking again toward him
[51:53] you know he tried to move in his right
[51:55] did i say dude you know what this other
[51:57] boy you know
[51:57] moved moved also
[52:01] you know he tried to make a funny face
[52:03] did i see the pharaoh you know the other
[52:05] boy who made the funny face
[52:06] he looked gasoline then after seeing all
[52:09] those
[52:09] after seeing that no he realized that
[52:12] that was his own image reflected
[52:16] and then
[52:29] you know my desire is to defeat the
[52:31] image of god
[52:33] so that when i'm walking wherever i
[52:36] am i work school and wherever
[52:39] people see me they can see christ
[52:44] the prophet says that these three men
[52:46] come to prophecy
[52:47] identify jesus
[52:51] and then and then jesus had to reflect
[52:53] himself
[52:54] in in them so when they were cast
[52:58] when they were cast into the fire
[53:01] you know the king who was outside
[53:04] you know was able to see god the fourth
[53:07] man they think about the voice
[53:09] why because they gave their life for
[53:11] christ
[53:52] now his own loving character molded
[53:54] himself into the person
[53:56] of christ
[54:01] [Music]
[54:02] god's own character of love projected
[54:05] himself in the man
[54:07] lukaku mem the
[54:16] thinking it not that we're thinking
[54:18] thinking in that robbery
[54:20] but making himself equal to god
[54:37] no one could ever do that by god
[54:41] this was done so that he could pay the
[54:43] penalty
[54:44] the of the fall of the fall of the fall
[54:47] of his creation
[54:57] amen he died so that we can have the
[54:59] character of jesus
[55:02] when he died upon the cross he said he
[55:04] gave us
[55:18] be like him no we'll make us
[55:22] walk like him will make us talk like him
[55:27] will make us behave like him
[55:30] because the prophet says that you can
[55:32] never reproach you can never report
[55:34] yours or
[55:34] reproduce this character the prophet
[55:38] you know unless you accept him i'm
[55:40] wonderful
[55:41] so in other words that you can never
[55:43] copy the character of jesus
[55:46] you know
[55:59] it's you doing the work you're doing
[56:03] your best to be
[56:04] the best image that you can ever be
[56:06] visited
[56:09] in nature you know it's no longer you
[56:13] doing the work
[56:27] you know even without knowing about
[56:29] people will be able to realize that this
[56:31] is like this is christ's life
[56:36] hey man i remember last semester i had i
[56:39] had a project my my school project that
[56:41] i had to do
[56:43] [Music]
[56:48] so at the end of my project i had to
[56:50] design let's say um
[56:51] because it was a chair that i had to do
[56:55] so here we have the chair uh this one is
[56:58] too simple it was
[56:59] you know a little more different
[57:03] so uh i had to design the the uh the the
[57:06] arm support
[57:07] here
[57:10] so the two the left the left part the
[57:12] left side and the right side were
[57:14] identical
[57:18] so i said well since they're identical
[57:20] so i don't have to design it twice or i
[57:22] don't have to make it to i mean
[57:24] do the
[57:30] so i said well let me copy and paste the
[57:33] right hand and then i will put it on the
[57:34] left hand
[57:35] side because you call the laptop
[57:40] so i ended up having two right hands
[57:42] instead of having the right and left
[57:50] because because even though they were
[57:52] identical
[57:54] but the right hand didn't fit in the
[57:56] place of the left hand
[58:02] you know when i you know because it was
[58:04] late i only had like 10 minutes to
[58:06] submit my
[58:28] in other words it will reflect the right
[58:30] hand as if you know in the left
[58:32] in the left position
[58:48] you will have the left hand and the
[58:49] right hand
[58:52] you know only if you do the mirror it's
[58:54] simple if you try to copy and paste
[58:58] and when they would try to put you in
[59:00] the right position
[59:10] you know if we try and copy everything
[59:12] if we're trying to copy or if we
[59:14] if we are the copy and paste product
[59:28] you're trying to confirm yourself into
[59:31] his image
[59:34] but instead if you are the mirror of god
[59:38] he will reflect himself in you
[59:42] and when you will be placed in that
[59:44] position
[1:00:12] in a manger
[1:00:16] could you imagine that could you imagine
[1:00:19] the little jehovah playing as a boy
[1:00:24] it's an example it's an example
[1:00:28] uh uh like it's an example this is an
[1:00:31] example could you imagine
[1:00:32] him as a teenager
[1:00:35] [Music]
[1:00:36] could you imagine him as a carpenter
[1:00:44] could you imagine him uh could you
[1:00:46] imagine him in such complete obedience
[1:00:48] or obedience to god
[1:00:53] dying on the ground
[1:01:18] you know jesus god himself god jesus
[1:01:22] no he had to make himself a baby
[1:01:25] baby you know being in a manger
[1:01:28] you know being marketed um
[1:01:33] you know being in a conference shop
[1:01:37] you know all of that to form or to show
[1:01:39] us the
[1:01:40] the true image of god
[1:01:44] if god came you know to us being a
[1:01:46] grown-up
[1:01:57] you know young people will have excuses
[1:01:59] but they say well god we never still we
[1:02:01] never saw you when you were young so we
[1:02:03] don't have the image of you being young
[1:02:09] you know that's why he had to start
[1:02:11] being a baby you know being a baby and
[1:02:13] growing up
[1:02:16] you know you really show us you really
[1:02:18] showed to us to show us
[1:02:21] you know the true image of god in every
[1:02:22] steps of our lives
[1:02:26] you know if you are young you can
[1:02:28] reflect yourself to him
[1:02:31] if you're old you can still reflect
[1:02:33] yourself tonight
[1:02:35] you know so that we can be this perfect
[1:02:37] image of god
[1:02:39] perfect you know god expressed himself
[1:02:42] in the scene god the god expressed
[1:02:44] himself in the sinless nature
[1:02:45] jesus extremely natural you know the way
[1:02:49] god expressed god always expressed
[1:02:50] himself in the sinless nature
[1:02:52] jesus christ remember you know that's
[1:02:54] why jesus was the true expression of g
[1:02:57] of god that's why he could say that me
[1:03:15] professor god is our savior
[1:03:18] if we profess that god is our deliverer
[1:03:22] if we profess that god is our hero
[1:03:26] you know we have to have this nature
[1:03:28] reflecting us
[1:03:30] you know we have to have you know the
[1:03:32] the nature of god reflect the being
[1:03:34] reflecting us
[1:03:37] you know like moses you know what and
[1:03:40] whenever moses was going to the mountain
[1:03:52] why because god was reflecting himself
[1:03:55] through him
[1:04:04] you know it was impossible for them to
[1:04:06] see god
[1:04:08] you know that's why they couldn't see
[1:04:10] the face of moses
[1:04:13] his face was so shining
[1:04:16] you know he was he was he had to wear
[1:04:18] himself
[1:04:20] you know and my desire is that god i
[1:04:23] just want to be your image
[1:04:48] but we have to take in another step
[1:04:52] higher
[1:05:12] yeah he was talking to me say isaac do
[1:05:14] you know um you say isaac
[1:05:17] you know actually you are the most used
[1:05:19] the word religious but um
[1:05:21] but he said that isaac you are the most
[1:05:23] religious person here in this uh i mean
[1:05:25] this uh
[1:05:26] uh i mean where we work here yeah he's
[1:05:28] actually
[1:05:29] religious you know and then i said to
[1:05:32] myself i said lord
[1:05:34] jesus you know i thank you for this
[1:05:37] testimony
[1:05:39] but i will be satisfied until those
[1:05:42] people will be able to thirst
[1:05:47] you know and be hungry and you know
[1:05:49] looking for what i have yeah what fun
[1:05:51] that was crochet you know they can't
[1:05:53] notice that i'm different
[1:05:56] thank you for that but my purpose is to
[1:05:59] make them
[1:06:00] thirsty i can
[1:06:17] the bible says that rejoice
[1:06:22] matthew chapter 5 verse 12 to 16.
[1:06:30] says
[1:06:31] okay matthew chapter 5 verse 12 to 16
[1:06:36] the bible says
[1:06:38] rejoice and be exceeding glad for
[1:06:41] for great is your reward in heaven
[1:06:44] for so persecuted day the prophets which
[1:06:47] were
[1:06:48] are before you
[1:06:51] vote
[1:06:57] you are the salt of the earth but if the
[1:07:00] salt have lost his savior
[1:07:02] wherewith shall it be salted
[1:07:06] it is danced for it did dance forth that
[1:07:09] good for nothing but not but to be cast
[1:07:13] out
[1:07:14] and to be true and to be trodden under
[1:07:17] under
[1:07:17] uh under foot of men
[1:07:29] you are the light of the world a city
[1:07:31] that is set on the hill cannot be heat
[1:07:35] situation neither do men
[1:07:39] light a candle and put it under the
[1:07:41] bushel under a bushel
[1:07:43] but on the candlestick and it gives
[1:07:47] light onto uh unto all that are in the
[1:07:50] house
[1:07:54] solutions
[1:08:00] let your light so shine before man that
[1:08:03] they may see your good works
[1:08:05] and glorify your father which is in
[1:08:08] heaven
[1:08:23] and glorify your father
[1:08:26] which is in heaven kid on this year you
[1:08:28] know that's the same thing
[1:08:29] that the king did celebrate you know the
[1:08:32] king nebuchadnezzar
[1:08:34] that's the same thing he did the one he
[1:08:35] became you know after the
[1:09:05] came that the king came near to the
[1:09:07] mouth to the mouth of the burning fiery
[1:09:09] furnace
[1:09:33] and the prince's governors and captains
[1:09:38] and the king's counselors being gathered
[1:09:40] together
[1:09:41] so this man upon whose bad is the fire
[1:09:44] had no power
[1:09:46] nor in hair of their head
[1:09:49] singed neither were their coats changed
[1:09:53] nor the smell of the fire pass on them
[1:10:00] somebody
[1:10:18] and said blessed be the god of shadrach
[1:10:21] meshach and abednego
[1:10:23] who has sent his angel and delivered his
[1:10:26] servants that trusted in him
[1:10:28] and have changed the king's word and
[1:10:31] yielded their bodies
[1:10:32] that they might not serve nor worship
[1:10:35] any god
[1:10:36] expect except their own god
[1:10:40] solution
[1:10:53] therefore i make a decree that
[1:10:56] every people nation and language
[1:11:00] which speak anything amid uh uh which
[1:11:03] speak
[1:11:03] anything and miss against the god
[1:11:06] against the god of shadrach meshach and
[1:11:07] abednego
[1:11:08] shall be cut in pieces and there and
[1:11:11] their houses
[1:11:12] shall be made a dunk here because there
[1:11:15] is no other god then that that can't
[1:11:17] deliver after this
[1:11:40] the prophet said that they left their
[1:11:42] home they left at their house when they
[1:11:44] were 12.
[1:11:47] you know the prophet said that they had
[1:11:48] no bible with him the prophet
[1:11:51] you know the prophet even emphasized he
[1:11:52] said that he didn't have even this song
[1:11:55] book that we do here
[1:12:01] the only thing that they knew was the
[1:12:03] word was the uh the word of moses
[1:12:06] is
[1:12:17] you know that's the only thing that they
[1:12:20] have
[1:12:26] you know to stand before that great
[1:12:28] challenge
[1:12:30] and the quotes that we just read in the
[1:12:32] first quote that we read the prophet
[1:12:34] said that they stand for they stood for
[1:12:35] something that they didn't have a
[1:12:37] revelation of it
[1:12:42] for something that they didn't have no
[1:12:44] revelation for it
[1:12:47] but they weren't able to stand
[1:12:51] you know they even said to themselves
[1:12:52] you know even though we are burned
[1:12:56] you know we will never bow and worship
[1:12:58] this guy right with your image
[1:13:03] you know but when they were doing that
[1:13:04] they didn't have or they didn't know
[1:13:06] what what that you know what uh what
[1:13:09] their
[1:13:09] life will have an impact on the impact
[1:13:12] of their lives
[1:13:25] [Music]
[1:13:29] with the word
[1:13:39] they obey the word of moses that says
[1:13:41] that you will never have another god
[1:13:43] before me is
[1:13:57] you know change the law of the country
[1:14:01] saying that i don't want you i don't
[1:14:03] want anybody to talk against this god
[1:14:08] because i had my personal time
[1:14:12] i tried to think about my god
[1:14:15] you know everything that i thought that
[1:14:16] they do
[1:14:18] i try to compare all their works
[1:14:22] but i didn't see them doing the works
[1:14:24] that the god of these three hebrews
[1:14:26] children did
[1:14:40] you know the fire that was hit up you
[1:14:42] know seven times harder than it was
[1:14:44] the foot is set for pluto you know the
[1:14:46] fire that killed the two guards that was
[1:14:49] that was standing at the door
[1:14:54] you know but
[1:15:09] the king tried to search you know he
[1:15:11] looked you know
[1:15:12] he tried to search
[1:15:15] who can do the same thing
[1:15:20] he said that from now you know i need
[1:15:23] you all to you know to go and worship
[1:15:26] this same god
[1:15:29] you know and if you can if you read the
[1:15:30] next chapter
[1:15:33] you will see that the same king you are
[1:15:36] telling
[1:15:50] the word you know to change the
[1:15:54] the heart of the king amen and that's
[1:15:57] the same thing that god is looking for
[1:16:00] you know god is looking for somebody you
[1:16:02] shall get gone you know who can take
[1:16:04] this word
[1:16:04] keep
[1:16:18] you know the challenges will come
[1:16:21] the devil will always come to challenge
[1:16:23] you
[1:16:24] you know the devil will always give you
[1:16:25] we always give you more tests
[1:16:28] you know we will always give you more
[1:16:30] trials but god is looking for that man
[1:16:35] can come you know he will be able to
[1:16:38] stand and to stick with this word
[1:16:45] you know never you know sell it for
[1:16:47] something
[1:16:49] you know and then and then stand for it
[1:16:51] and god will god will always honor you
[1:16:56] you know god will always harm you you
[1:16:58] know jesus came on earth
[1:17:13] you know so you know so that we can
[1:17:15] follow his footsteps
[1:17:18] you know and when he went there when
[1:17:20] when he uh uh
[1:17:21] uh uh he died in rapture
[1:17:25] you know he sent us the holy spirit
[1:17:28] and the holy spirit inside of the people
[1:17:30] instead of people it wasn't expanding
[1:17:32] you know we're able to write this book
[1:17:34] of acts
[1:17:38] you know the same god remember because
[1:17:40] if you read the bible
[1:17:57] you know that's what the bible says but
[1:18:00] the same god
[1:18:01] may remember because he uh most of his
[1:18:03] miracles
[1:18:05] before his brothers that's why even he
[1:18:08] even said to that woman
[1:18:36] you know to do the same thing to have
[1:18:38] the ministry of
[1:18:40] of the son of man you know he wasn't the
[1:18:43] son of man god was the son of man
[1:18:48] you know reflecting living inside of him
[1:18:51] the son of man
[1:19:06] is you know some
[1:19:10] things that the prophet did lost
[1:19:13] you see that many people always you know
[1:19:15] you know give it back to the prophet
[1:19:20] usually
[1:19:27] well i agree that there are you know
[1:19:29] certain things that only the prophet can
[1:19:30] do
[1:19:32] you know for example you're giving your
[1:19:34] back to the people and telling the
[1:19:35] thought of everybody
[1:19:36] for example you know that that that's
[1:19:39] only
[1:19:40] one gift of of the age
[1:19:44] but but he gave us god gave god give us
[1:19:46] the grace
[1:19:48] you know to see those works the voices
[1:19:51] over so that has
[1:19:52] you know so that you know to be uh to
[1:19:54] see those works so that when the prophet
[1:19:56] is gone
[1:19:57] the prophet you know we'll be able to do
[1:20:00] the same work this wrong
[1:20:02] that completely remembers you
[1:20:16] write the book of acts you know and that
[1:20:20] is the same thing
[1:20:22] you know god said god had murder god
[1:20:24] sent as a prophet judas
[1:20:26] prophet you know that prophet was the
[1:20:28] image of god it's a prophetic
[1:20:29] image of jesus that prophet
[1:21:03] [Music]
[1:21:12] i had a conversation with one brother
[1:21:17] you know but we we told him i think it
[1:21:19] was me and lisa and we were talking with
[1:21:21] another brother
[1:21:24] you know that brother actually came to
[1:21:26] us and he says only the prophet can
[1:21:27] raise up you know
[1:21:28] a dead for a dead man
[1:21:35] you know he said that that was only for
[1:21:36] the prophet only the prophet can do this
[1:21:41] the fair well i said well there is
[1:21:42] nowhere in the bible where he says that
[1:21:44] only the prophet can do it
[1:21:48] you know the prophet tell myself i never
[1:21:50] i you know
[1:21:52] god never you know didn't give me the
[1:21:54] grace to do it
[1:21:57] on call during that you know but i still
[1:21:59] believe that if you know
[1:22:00] it happens and we know and god gives me
[1:22:03] the grace to do it i will do it and
[1:22:05] that person will be that person will
[1:22:06] rise up
[1:22:12] you know why because it was something
[1:22:14] you know
[1:22:15] it was something you know that god show
[1:22:18] it to us
[1:22:20] oh god gave it to us
[1:22:36] you know the prophet says the prophet
[1:22:39] now the only way that the world will see
[1:22:41] christ
[1:22:42] is when he is when
[1:22:45] uh uh they see it in you and me
[1:22:48] the son of mondo
[1:22:54] that's the only way they ever see christ
[1:22:59] it says that their conscience are now or
[1:23:01] not of
[1:23:02] of the sunsets
[1:23:27] that we that we enjoy after after we
[1:23:30] have found christine
[1:24:00] you are god's
[1:24:13] so we don't want to smear we don't want
[1:24:15] to smear
[1:24:16] a big a big lot of stuff on there
[1:24:24] that testifies about things that we're
[1:24:26] really not that we are
[1:24:27] we really are not
[1:24:42] you know there are other people who will
[1:24:44] never have this chance to open this
[1:24:46] bible
[1:24:49] you know there are other people who will
[1:24:50] never have the chance to read the word
[1:24:52] from this bible
[1:25:21] we have no excuses to say that they
[1:25:23] didn't know the words
[1:25:37] you know the bible said that we are the
[1:25:39] written epistle
[1:25:43] read about all men you know others
[1:25:47] people will never they don't have this
[1:25:49] chance or this opportunity to
[1:25:50] open this bible yes
[1:25:59] because remember the prophet says that
[1:26:01] god wrote his word or his word in
[1:26:03] five things in five different ways
[1:26:34] written bible
[1:26:38] and we have to live like it is
[1:26:41] no we have to live like you know
[1:26:44] wherever that we go
[1:26:46] you know we want people to see that we
[1:26:48] are different
[1:26:51] that you know we are living the life of
[1:26:53] christ
[1:26:55] you know we want people when they look
[1:26:57] at us they can see yes ma i went

[1:27:52] are religious which i don't think you
[1:27:54] know that that's what they say which i
[1:27:55] don't think that they are because
[1:27:56] they wouldn't be doing what they are
[1:27:58] doing

[1:30:41] you know peter had me peter did a lot of
[1:30:43] miracles
[1:30:45] you know uh he made the lamb walk
[1:30:49] you know the angel of the angel showed
[1:30:51] up when he was in prison
[1:30:54] you know he had all those all those
[1:30:56] kinds of miracles
[1:30:58] but this young man stephen you know he
[1:31:02] didn't have any miracle he didn't do any
[1:31:04] miracle at all
[1:31:06] but he lived such a life
[1:31:09] you know that that was reflecting the
[1:31:11] life of christ
[1:31:13] i even chose to die for christ
[1:31:19] was able to change the life of a person
[1:31:21] the life of a man
[1:31:24] that's what the christian has to have to
[1:31:26] do today
[1:31:28] you know to live
[1:31:56] to serve the same god that you are
[1:31:58] serving
[1:32:01] amen and and the prophet says
[1:32:04] what are we to do today because we want
[1:32:06] some neutral do we
[1:32:08] no matter he said that we don't have to
[1:32:10] have
[1:32:11] big audiences
[1:32:15] you know we don't have to preach to 10
[1:32:17] 000 people
[1:32:20] [Music]
[1:32:23] we don't have to uh we we we we don't
[1:32:26] even have to preach
[1:32:27] that's it we can be
[1:32:30] god's advertising advertisement board
[1:32:37] how do you know that your life might not
[1:32:40] start
[1:32:40] some young man on the gospel
[1:32:49] certainly see old woman
[1:32:53] the farmer the farmers you know your
[1:32:55] life can start a young
[1:32:57] man vote for some young men
[1:33:01] on the field out there you know who will
[1:33:04] win 10
[1:33:05] 000 souls to christ
[1:33:07] [Music]
[1:33:09] you know it's because they saw christ in
[1:33:12] you
[1:33:14] that you presented christ to him
[1:33:18] in the simple power of the gospel
[1:33:35] or in other words you will present them
[1:33:37] christ
[1:33:40] in the simple power of the gospel
[1:33:44] by living your life you know the prophet
[1:33:47] says
[1:33:48] the prophet to judy that god wants to
[1:33:50] save people
[1:33:53] you know he called a lot of people
[1:33:57] but the thing is that the people who are
[1:33:59] supposed to be his billboards
[1:34:02] is
[1:34:16] that shows exactly your need
[1:34:24] you need to eat you will look for a
[1:34:27] billboard that says restaurants
[1:34:44] you need to fill up your tank you will
[1:34:45] look for this big billboard that says
[1:34:47] gas station
[1:34:54] and the prophet says that god called
[1:34:56] many people
[1:35:13] you know they are living the same way as
[1:35:16] as uh as
[1:35:17] non-believers
[1:35:22] they're singing the same song
[1:35:25] you know they they're going to the same
[1:35:27] parties yvonne of the memphis
[1:35:28] you know they're doing the same the
[1:35:30] exact same thing if only
[1:35:32] you know they are you know among those
[1:35:34] who market christ
[1:35:38] you know there is no difference between
[1:35:39] them and
[1:35:40] [Music]
[1:36:10] and instead of seeing a billboard that
[1:36:12] says that crust is here
[1:36:16] you know he's saying he's seeing another
[1:36:17] billboard that says that if you need
[1:36:19] you know entertainment come and call me
[1:36:21] and i'll help
[1:36:51] you know they're seeing something else
[1:36:54] you know that's not what you were called
[1:36:56] to do
[1:36:58] that's not what you that's not your
[1:36:59] purpose of being here on earth
[1:37:01] objective you know objectives
[1:37:18] you know the bible says that you are the
[1:37:20] light of the world
[1:37:23] and jesus is the main light
[1:37:26] how are you going to be the light of the
[1:37:28] world if your life is different than him
[1:37:49] you know you only reflect the person who
[1:37:50] is inside of you
[1:37:53] and the prophet says that inside of us
[1:37:55] there is only two things
[1:37:59] there is either a dove or a snake yes
[1:38:14] you
[1:38:43] i'm going to ask you a question that i i
[1:38:45] heard the prophet asking to abraham
[1:38:47] tabernacle
[1:38:51] you know the prophet asks is the church
[1:38:53] the prophet
[1:38:55] he that he said says
[1:39:00] with the same life that you are living
[1:39:02] today
[1:39:03] or like just how you are now
[1:39:07] if you were in the time of noah
[1:39:32] you know if you were you know if you
[1:39:34] were in the time of noah
[1:39:37] you know which group or in what group
[1:39:39] were you going to be
[1:39:42] where are you going to be with noah
[1:39:45] or were you going to be with other
[1:39:47] people who rejected they will reject
[1:39:48] the word
[1:39:51] you know all of that the answer is by
[1:39:53] the way you're living
[1:39:58] you know i'm not here to tell you that
[1:39:59] you're living wrong or you're living
[1:40:00] right

[1:40:34] you know you're supposed to know what is
[1:40:36] right and what is wrong
[1:40:39] and the very same way that you're living
[1:40:43] you know you can if you are true to god
[1:40:48] you know you would tell him lord i'm not
[1:40:50] yet what i want to be
[1:40:53] oh you said that lord i'm being a bad
[1:40:55] reproach for your name
[1:41:00] and and one thing i like with god he
[1:41:10] [Music]
[1:41:14] you know his life or his his image will
[1:41:17] be natural
[1:41:20] no he will reflect himself in you
[1:41:23] and you can walk it will be and people
[1:41:26] will say that this is quite this is like
[1:41:27] christ
[1:41:30] that's
[1:41:46] you know was i going to be with noah
[1:41:52] or with other people who rejected the
[1:41:54] word
[1:41:57] we know the result of those two groups
[1:42:00] no the people were with noah you know
[1:42:03] they were saved is it this will be
[1:42:05] you know they were saved by the people
[1:42:08] who were not with noah
[1:42:11] all of them was killed
[1:42:14] even now you know all of them was here
[1:42:17] and which group do you want to be
[1:42:20] educated
[1:42:23] there is only two no there is god's
[1:42:26] people
[1:42:27] the jews and the people of the day of
[1:42:29] lucifer
[1:42:32] and there is only two there's only one
[1:42:34] thing that you can do
[1:42:35] to be a part of one group
[1:42:40] you have to accept either one of them
[1:42:45] you know the prophet says that to go to
[1:42:47] hell it's hard

[1:43:09] to go to hell
[1:43:14] there's only one thing that you can do
[1:43:17] no you
