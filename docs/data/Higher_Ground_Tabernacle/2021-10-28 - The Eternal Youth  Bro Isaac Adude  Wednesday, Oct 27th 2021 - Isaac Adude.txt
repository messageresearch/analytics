look at their lives amen you know you will see that they don't obey the word you know they don't obey the 100 of the word because inside of them there is still a nature you know of the serpent inside of them but until you kill that serpent that is inside of you amen a dove will never come and then live in your heart amen because there is only one thing that has to live in even it's either the serpent or a dove amen in order for a dove to come amen the serpent has to die amen in order for the serpent to die amen you have to you know go through justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy spirit amen that the serpent will die and then the day of amen which is the holy spirit will come in you and then when the dove comes in you amen then you know and then then you'll have that that promise of eternal life amen the prophet says that the ground has to receive the wheat in order to reproduce life and you have to receive the word of god in your heart to produce what the word says it will be every word of god is a seed jesus said it was the sour and the sower uh went for went forth sowing seeds he said the seed was the word of god and now notice a corn will bring forth a corn a wheat a wheat a barley a barley whatever it may be it'll produce if god's word is a seed as jesus said it was and it's placed in the human heart and there watered by faith it'll produce anything that god said in his word that that that he will do it will produce if you need if you need salvation come unto me all ye that labor and heavenly and heavy laden i'll give you rest if you need healing he was wounded for our transgressions with his trials we were healed god has provided the sacrifice for sin and sickness and worry and trouble and sorrows and all these things god has provided the sacrifice he is here tonight amen the word of god if it's planted in your heart amen it'll produce everything that god said that the word said that he don't produce amen if you need eternal life amen god has an invitation open for you that he will give you as long as you let that word be planted inside of you amen if you need salvation amen god has you know a word you know if that word is planted inside of you it'll produce salvation amen if you need healing that word will produce healing you know if it comes inside of you amen everything that you need as long as you plant that way as long as that word is inside of you amen that word will bring forth you know according everything that god said that he'll bring amen god's word cannot bring something else or something contrary to it because in genesis god said that every seed you know we reproduce according everything will produce the same thing amen there is no such a thing as hybrid seed with god amen if the word of god is planted in you amen it will produce all the promises of god in the bible amen and then in order for you in order for it to happen it means something has to happen in your heart you know

experienced you know amen he experienced the level of of of hell and then he wished that he had done something better it meant to avoid being in that place amen amen you can read the bible the bible says that that place is not eternal that's right but it's not a good place to be even though it's not eternal amen the devil can come and fool you to say that well you'll be there for a while and then you'll be done forever amen don't let him fool you it's the worst place that you can imagine amen try to imagine all the suffering that we have try to imagine all you know everything wrong and painful that you have been to amen those things cannot be compared to the pain that you will have in hell amen try to imagine that amen but there is a promise that you can go to a place where there is no you

every you know all the saints of all amen to that place where god himself will be there amen to that place where you will never die amen it's a promise that that is given to everybody amen by the only thing before you get that promise you have to follow him amen he's it's an invitation amen follow him if you want that eternal youth amen you have to follow him amen if you want to if you want that eternal life amen you have to follow him amen you have to follow all the process that he gave you amen you have to go through justification you know sanctification the baptism of the holy spirit but the good thing is that you know he promised us all of that and then he said that he will never let us go through it alone all by ourselves amen he's always there to guide us through amen in other words that you know you don't have to you know to to work hard for you to get to heaven amen what you have to do is just surrender amen you surrender yourself and then god will lead you through amen that's what we need we need to follow him tonight and if we do that god will always bless us and we will have we'll have that promise that you promised us about the eternal life amen god bless you hearing the gospel it never grows old and i tell you what sometimes we forget how beautiful it is but the gospel in itself is the most powerful message a person can bring i can remember my mother being a christian how i admired her walk in christ but i was a very proud person [Music] i enjoyed seeing other christians and i wanted to be a christian but i was so involved in the world and i didn't want to really give up my worldly things and i didn't want to be picked at and mocked like i had seen the christians picked out and marked i literally played the role of a hypocrite because of my heart i really wanted to be a christian and there were times in my life as the brother said when he was speaking i imitated the christian i tried not to live a christian life without the holy ghost and every time i look around i would fall in my face and then the reality of a christian became to more difficult in my mind and i said who could live like that who could live a christian life i didn't know that once you become a christian you don't have to live it but christ lives it through you i didn't understand the power of the holy ghost because the holy ghost come to live that life through you it's not you paul said it's not i that live but it's christ that lives in me or through me and once i caught that revelation i was no longer afraid of the holy ghost i was inviting god in and i can truly say that every change that has occurred in my life has not been because of my efforts but it's because of my prayer david said that when we fall into trouble we look toward the hill from which cometh our help and our help comes from the lord he goes on to say that the name of the lord is a strong towel and the righteous run in and they are saved and so i learned even now even now i sometimes forget it's not human effort it's the grace of god and it's the grace of god that changes you like our brother said in his ministry tonight when you commune with him when you fellowship with him and the more you give him attention the more revelation you get the greater the change the more praise the more worship the more surrender everything you do is more and more and more and the more you do the more he gives he talked about the woman at simon's house how she began to wash his feet then she began to dry his feet with her hair and wash it with her tears and the more she gave the more she gave the more she would give and then jesus asked the woman what would you have of me i'm sorry he then said unto the woman knowing her needs woman your sins be forgiven she didn't even have to ask he perceived it and that's how it is with god sometimes you get into worship and praise you don't even have to ask him he changes you he takes it away because i'm gonna tell you something the saints of god that one person not one person that i know of can live a true life for christ without the holy spirit without god in you changing you amen god is good i enjoyed the word thank god for our brother isaac it's been a while since i've heard him preaching i enjoyed it because i realize is that the way god brings himself in such a simple way when you can get it you got something really good god is good all the time let's sing that song as our song leader comes god is good all the time in the darkest night his light will shine god is good yes he is all the time [Music] his
