[53:08] let's open our Bibles in
[53:10] the Book of Psalms read the verse
[53:14] [Music]
[53:19] 23 then we go to Isaiah
[53:28] Psalms
[53:30] 23 he only has four
[53:43] verses the Bible
[53:46] says unto thee lift I up my eyes oh thou
[53:51] that dwellest in the
[53:53] heavens Psalm 123 sorry PSM
[54:05] all right Psalms 123 I'm
[54:08] sorry the Bible says unto thee lift I up
[54:12] my eyes or thou that dwellest in the
[54:17] heavens behold as the eyes of the
[54:19] servants look unto the hand of of their
[54:22] masters and as the eyes of the maiden
[54:26] unto the hand of her mistress so our
[54:29] eyes wait upon the Lord Our God until
[54:33] that he have mercy on
[54:45] us have mercy upon us oh Lord have mercy
[54:48] upon us for we are exceedingly filled
[54:52] with contempt
[54:58] our soul is exceedingly filled with the
[55:01] scorning with the scorning of those that
[55:03] are a and with the contempt of The
[55:11] Proud you know I I love the verse
[55:15] two as David wrote
[55:19] it he says behold as the eyes of the
[55:22] servants look unto the hand of the
[55:24] master
[55:28] the eyes of the maiden onto the hand of
[55:30] her
[55:32] mistress so our eyes wait upon the Lord
[55:35] Our
[55:38] God until he have mercy upon us you know
[55:41] I love how he say that we wait upon God
[55:47] until so there is no time limit you have
[55:50] wait upon the Lord
[55:54] until he gives you whatever you ask
[55:58] for amen let's go to um Isaiah chapter
[56:01] 40 read the verse 29 to
[56:07] 31 yeah Isaiah chapter 40
[56:16] 29-31 actually let's start from verse
[56:23] 27 27 to 31
[56:29] the Bible says what sayest
[56:34] thou the Bible says what sayest thou oh
[56:38] Jacob and speakest oh Israel my way is
[56:42] hid from the Lord and my judgment is
[56:44] passed over my passed passed over from
[56:48] my God
[56:57] has thou not known has thou not heard
[57:01] that the Everlasting God the Lord the
[57:04] creator of the ends of the Earth fth not
[57:07] neither is weary there is no searching
[57:10] of his
[57:22] understanding verse 21 verse uh 29 he
[57:25] says
[57:27] he giveth power to the Fain and to them
[57:30] that have no might he increases
[57:38] strength verse 30 even the youth shall
[57:42] faint and be weary and the young men
[57:45] shall utterly
[57:52] fall if you notice the Bible when the
[57:55] Bible uses the word youth it means
[58:03] strength but here the Lord is not
[58:05] talking about our natural
[58:10] strength no he's talking about the
[58:12] strength that he will give to
[58:16] people you know who will wait upon
[58:19] him so that strength doesn't matter how
[58:22] old you
[58:24] are you know he will make make you do
[58:26] something that the young cannot
[58:31] do verse 31 it says but they that wait
[58:34] upon the Lord shall renew their strength
[58:37] they shall Mount up with wings as eagles
[58:40] they shall run and not be weary and they
[58:43] shall walk in
[58:48] [Music]
[58:52] our let's pray Dear God we come again
[58:57] father Lord to you lord lord as the
[59:00] prophet says every man can turn the
[59:03] pages of this
[59:06] book but nobody can give the
[59:10] understanding Lord we pray that you be
[59:12] with us
[59:13] Lord and you help us father God to
[59:16] understand father God
[59:18] this Jesus Christ name we pray amen you
[59:22] may be
[59:23] seated this morning my subject
[59:27] will be they that wait upon the
[59:30] Lord because as David said in Psalms
[59:36] 1123 it says that we have to wait upon
[59:39] the Lord
[59:43] until you know let me let me read it
[59:47] again I fell in love with this
[59:52] scripture you know he says that we have
[59:54] to wait upon the Lord our God until that
[59:57] he have mercy upon
[1:00:00] us you know we have to wait upon the
[1:00:02] Lord Our God
[1:00:05] until you see your prayer being
[1:00:09] fulfilled you know you ask something
[1:00:12] through from God you ask something to
[1:00:14] God you know you are in need of
[1:00:17] something you ask God you have to wait
[1:00:21] upon it you know it doesn't matter how
[1:00:23] long it takes you have to wait
[1:00:27] you know last Sunday we preached in I
[1:00:29] City and we started this
[1:00:33] sermon I entitled it um stand
[1:00:39] still and see the salvation of the
[1:00:42] Lord so now we try to uh continue
[1:00:46] with you know cuz waiting you have to
[1:00:50] have faith to wait
[1:00:56] patience you have to have
[1:00:58] faith you know that's why the Bible when
[1:01:01] when when I think Paul who I forget who
[1:01:03] wrote
[1:01:05] it that when he said that you have to
[1:01:08] add upon
[1:01:09] Faith you know faith is there the
[1:01:13] foundation and you have to add upon it
[1:01:16] you know you have to add
[1:01:18] virtue knowledge Temperance and then you
[1:01:22] have to add patience
[1:01:24] godliness you know your patience has to
[1:01:26] go along with
[1:01:29] faith you know you ask something from to
[1:01:32] God you know you prayed all night long
[1:01:36] you know you have to wait up you have to
[1:01:37] wait on him you know you have to quieten
[1:01:40] yourself and wait until God gives you
[1:01:42] whatever you ask
[1:01:45] for and for you to wait you have to have
[1:01:47] you have to have
[1:01:49] faith you know you have to trust the
[1:01:51] Lord you know God said it I believe it
[1:01:56] that settles
[1:01:57] it the prophet says I spoke somewhere
[1:02:01] the other
[1:02:03] night and said and said what if the
[1:02:06] disciples had waited nine
[1:02:11] days and said we'll accept it by
[1:02:15] faith that we got the Holy Ghost and go
[1:02:19] on they wouldn't have had
[1:02:22] it see they stayed there until they knew
[1:02:26] it was
[1:02:30] there you know something had
[1:02:33] happened something that they could put
[1:02:36] their hands on
[1:02:39] say this is it just like Noah could
[1:02:43] say this is it you know just like Moses
[1:02:47] could say with a stick in his
[1:02:50] hand it you know the disciple had to
[1:02:53] wait you know Jesus told them to wait
[1:02:57] until you know they be filled with the
[1:02:59] spirit from high and the prophet says
[1:03:02] that if you go to God and and you come
[1:03:04] to the
[1:03:06] Altar and you asking God to save you or
[1:03:08] to fill you with the Holy
[1:03:11] Spirit Prophet said that you don't have
[1:03:13] to leave the altar until you are filled
[1:03:15] with the Holy
[1:03:18] Spirit when God tells you you have to
[1:03:20] wait
[1:03:22] until know you have to wait until
[1:03:26] it might take 40 years it might take 25
[1:03:29] years it might take two days it might
[1:03:32] take a minute or a second but you have
[1:03:35] to wait until you see whatever thing
[1:03:38] that you had uh
[1:03:41] accomplished you know this morning when
[1:03:44] I was uh
[1:03:45] meditating you know I fell on the spir I
[1:03:48] fell on the uh the the story of
[1:03:51] Gideon you know you have to see that
[1:03:54] Gideon God called
[1:03:56] a man of of a great
[1:04:00] Valor but you see that
[1:04:02] Gideon the first thing that he had to do
[1:04:06] it was to destroy the sin that was in
[1:04:08] the
[1:04:09] camp went to the temple and destroy the
[1:04:12] the the uh the altar of
[1:04:16] Bale you know and then after that he had
[1:04:18] to fight you know there was a fight that
[1:04:20] was about about to
[1:04:23] happen but you see that Gideon even
[1:04:26] though the Lord called him a might a man
[1:04:28] of great Valor or Mighty
[1:04:31] Valor inside of Gideon gide had
[1:04:35] fear you know if you read the uh the
[1:04:38] chapter six of
[1:04:41] Judges I think about around verse 37 to
[1:04:46] 40 you know you will see that Gideon
[1:04:48] asked the first sign to
[1:04:51] God the first sign you know God if this
[1:04:55] you let this
[1:04:57] happen you know God showed him that it
[1:04:59] was him but yet Gideon saw that but he
[1:05:03] didn't trust God in full you know he
[1:05:05] didn't trust he didn't fully trust
[1:05:08] God you know he asked God for the second
[1:05:12] time you know God God God told him you
[1:05:15] know God gave him again that
[1:05:19] sign but yet even though God gave him
[1:05:22] two
[1:05:23] sign you know gide Gideon didn't really
[1:05:26] trust God you didn't fully trust
[1:05:28] God but the Lord saw you know the Lord
[1:05:31] saw the heart of Gideon and God wanted
[1:05:34] to help him you know if you read the
[1:05:36] verse the chapter 7 verse 10 to uh uh
[1:05:42] 11 this is after Gideon asked the the
[1:05:45] signs to God the two
[1:05:48] signs he asked him two signs and he
[1:05:51] asked him two signs and God gave him the
[1:05:53] two
[1:05:54] signs but here in verse 10 of
[1:06:01] chapter the Bible says this is God
[1:06:04] talking to
[1:06:07] Gideon let's read from verse
[1:06:10] n the Bible say and it came to pass the
[1:06:13] same night that the Lord said unto him
[1:06:15] arise get the down unto the host for I
[1:06:18] have delivered it into hand
[1:06:26] now here here is verse 10 the Lord is
[1:06:29] telling him but if thou fear to go
[1:06:35] down go thou with uh forah thy servant
[1:06:39] down to the
[1:06:42] host you know here the Lord is talking
[1:06:45] to a man who asks him
[1:06:48] signs you know the man God showed him
[1:06:51] the
[1:06:52] sign you know that he was with him you
[1:06:56] know God showed him the signs the two
[1:06:58] signs you know that I will fight this
[1:07:00] battle with
[1:07:02] you yet the Lord felt fear the lord
[1:07:04] smell fear to in Gideon's to
[1:07:10] Gideon you know the Lord saw that Gideon
[1:07:13] still you know Gideon you know was fear
[1:07:16] you know didn't believe he didn't fully
[1:07:21] believe you know sometimes as a
[1:07:24] man you know sometimes it happen that
[1:07:26] even though you see you know all the
[1:07:28] words being fulfilled but you still have
[1:07:30] that doubt you still have that
[1:07:33] fear but here is the Lord helping Gideon
[1:07:36] to overcome that
[1:07:39] fear because you can't go in the battle
[1:07:42] with that
[1:07:44] fear you know you have first to overcome
[1:07:47] it you know you cannot surrender
[1:07:49] yourself you cannot fully surrender
[1:07:51] yourself with that
[1:07:53] fear you know you cannot wait upon the
[1:07:56] Lord with
[1:07:57] fear you cannot believe in God With
[1:08:01] Fear so the verse 11 God
[1:08:04] says the Bible says and thou shall hear
[1:08:07] what they say and afterward thou sh
[1:08:11] shall th th hands be strengthened to go
[1:08:14] down unto the host then went he down
[1:08:18] with furah his servants unto this the
[1:08:20] outside of the Armed of the Armed men
[1:08:23] that were in the host to
[1:08:34] and and there Gideon showed that he was
[1:08:36] fearing because he took his servant and
[1:08:38] he went with
[1:08:41] him but there when they went you know
[1:08:45] God told them to hear whatever the the
[1:08:48] the the en the enemies will
[1:08:52] say so there when they went there you
[1:08:55] know a man had a
[1:08:57] dream you know he was telling them a
[1:08:59] dream he was telling the the enemies the
[1:09:03] dream and amongst them somebody was
[1:09:06] interpreting that
[1:09:08] dream and when Gideon heard that
[1:09:11] dream you know there at that point where
[1:09:14] Gideon really understood or he had faith
[1:09:16] in God that God would fight our
[1:09:20] battles if you read the verse 15 of the
[1:09:22] same chapter
[1:09:25] the Bible says that and it was so when
[1:09:27] Gideon heard the telling of the dream
[1:09:30] and the inter the
[1:09:33] interpret and the the inter interpret
[1:09:37] interpretation thereof that he worshiped
[1:09:40] and returned into the host of Israel and
[1:09:42] said arise for the Lord has delivered
[1:09:44] into your hand the host of median
[1:09:57] you know though Gideon was though Gideon
[1:10:00] had a fear on
[1:10:02] him but God helped him to overcome the
[1:10:05] fear because God was about to do
[1:10:08] something great with
[1:10:11] him then after that the Bible tells us
[1:10:13] about how many people Gideon had in his
[1:10:18] army you we first see that Gideon
[1:10:20] recruited 30 thou I mean
[1:10:23] 30,000 uh uh men 30,000 32,000
[1:10:31] soldiers you know who had to fight
[1:10:34] against 1
[1:10:36] 135
[1:10:37] 135,000
[1:10:40] million
[1:10:43] 135,000 you know at that point you know
[1:10:46] if you do the
[1:10:48] math you see that the ratio was 4
[1:10:51] to1 so which means that uh which means
[1:10:56] which means that one soldier from the of
[1:10:59] the Gideon's Army had to fight had to
[1:11:01] kill four
[1:11:06] enemies you know but the Lord said that
[1:11:09] Gideon this is not enough this is not my
[1:11:12] plan you know though the ratio is 4
[1:11:15] to1 after the battle you'll say that we
[1:11:18] did it with our own
[1:11:20] hands the Lord said ask them you know
[1:11:24] who is thinking about their life their
[1:11:26] family their children and everything and
[1:11:28] everything
[1:11:32] else you know and 30 and and 32 3 I mean
[1:11:36] and 22,000 soldiers wears up their hand
[1:11:38] they say that no we can't fight because
[1:11:40] we're thinking about our
[1:11:44] family if you going in a battle with
[1:11:48] god fully in you know you have to you
[1:11:52] have to made up your mind you there no
[1:11:55] turning back you know once you accept to
[1:11:59] to carry that
[1:12:01] cross you know you have to go until the
[1:12:04] end and and and 22 soldiers and 22,000
[1:12:08] soldiers
[1:12:10] returned you know and and and G Gideon
[1:12:13] stayed with 10,000
[1:12:16] soldiers that had to fight
[1:12:20] 135 135,000 soldiers
[1:12:25] you know now the ratio is 14 to
[1:12:29] one so which means that one soldiers one
[1:12:32] soldier of Gideon had to fight 14 other
[1:12:42] soldiers but the Lord said I'm not yet
[1:12:44] I'm not satisfied with this
[1:12:47] number you know I want you to give them
[1:12:49] more
[1:12:51] test you know I want you to form their
[1:12:53] character
[1:12:55] because character is not a
[1:12:57] gift you know character is a
[1:13:00] victory you know you have to fight for
[1:13:03] it you know you have to you have to
[1:13:05] fight for it you know you have to pass
[1:13:08] the
[1:13:09] test you know for you to form that
[1:13:12] character and the Lord told Gideon to
[1:13:14] say go to the
[1:13:16] river you know and let them drink
[1:13:19] water and those who will drink water
[1:13:21] with their hands you know those one will
[1:13:24] be selected to for the for the fight for
[1:13:26] the
[1:13:27] battle and those who would do with their
[1:13:29] tongue like the dog
[1:13:31] does you they would go back they would
[1:13:34] go to their home and there you know we
[1:13:37] see that you know uh
[1:13:40] 9,700 people failed that
[1:13:46] test and Gideon here stayed with 300
[1:13:51] men you know who had to fight 130
[1:13:56] 135,000
[1:13:59] soldiers so now you know if you don't
[1:14:02] have
[1:14:03] faith you know this seems this is
[1:14:07] impossible you know nowhere you'll see
[1:14:10] that 300
[1:14:13] men we have to fight with
[1:14:16] 135,000 men out other the
[1:14:19] soldiers you know now here the ratio now
[1:14:22] is now four 450 to
[1:14:28] one the test is getting
[1:14:32] harder you know now Gideon you know
[1:14:34] those soldiers have to learn how to
[1:14:36] trust God
[1:14:38] more you know now this Soldier has to
[1:14:41] understand that it's not by their own
[1:14:44] strength they to wait upon the Lord you
[1:14:48] know which means that one soldier had to
[1:14:50] fight 450 other
[1:14:54] soldiers you know which seems
[1:14:57] impossible you know which is
[1:15:00] impossible but we know that the Bible
[1:15:02] says that with faith nothing is
[1:15:04] impossible everything isoss to them that
[1:15:08] believe so but now so gon instead of
[1:15:12] letting those 300 men fight
[1:15:16] together you know because we know that
[1:15:18] when there is Unity there is more
[1:15:19] strength you know when when people are
[1:15:21] united
[1:15:25] said no let me make this harder
[1:15:28] again you know he divided this 300 men
[1:15:31] into into three
[1:15:34] companies so 100 men has to go this
[1:15:37] way 100 had to go this way and the other
[1:15:40] 100 had to go that
[1:15:42] way you know which mean that 100
[1:15:45] men had to fight
[1:15:48] 45,000
[1:15:51] soldiers 45,000
[1:15:55] which makes it harder again you know but
[1:15:58] Gideon had to trust the Lord you know
[1:16:01] Gideon had to wait upon the Lord you
[1:16:03] know God had to build the faith into
[1:16:08] Gideon you know and they went there and
[1:16:11] they fought this battle and they
[1:16:13] overcame you know nowhere with Gideon
[1:16:16] strength he had to fight that
[1:16:19] battle he had no strength to fight
[1:16:23] it you know by what
[1:16:26] needed you know he needed experience God
[1:16:30] you know he needed to have experiences
[1:16:32] with God you know that experience that
[1:16:35] will build up his
[1:16:37] faith he can go and trust God and fight
[1:16:40] this
[1:16:43] battle you know you see
[1:16:45] David with
[1:16:47] sa when go when Goliath came to to
[1:16:50] challenge them you know according to the
[1:16:53] Bible
[1:16:55] that Saul was the nearest man who was
[1:16:57] supposed to fight
[1:17:01] Goliath because the bible say that Saul
[1:17:03] was the tallest man you know among them
[1:17:07] all you know that's why he was chosen as
[1:17:10] as a
[1:17:11] king you know was the tallest man in
[1:17:15] Israel you know so you know so was
[1:17:19] lacking
[1:17:20] something you know he was lacking
[1:17:22] experience with God
[1:17:25] no faith he had no faith to go fight
[1:17:27] against
[1:17:28] goath he had fear you know David who was
[1:17:33] way smaller than
[1:17:35] sa you know he had experiences with God
[1:17:39] so when he went to sa you know David was
[1:17:42] able to tell so his experience that he
[1:17:44] had with
[1:17:46] God those experience to BU build up his
[1:17:50] faith and he went and he fought against
[1:17:52] and he fought against Goliath
[1:17:55] you know we need fa you know we need to
[1:17:57] wait upon the Lord you know you see
[1:18:00] Moses you know God told him to to go he
[1:18:03] had the promise of the Lord he had the
[1:18:04] word of the Lord to deliver you know his
[1:18:08] people you know Moses Tried by by
[1:18:13] himself you know he couldn't because he
[1:18:16] had fear you know he ran he ran from
[1:18:19] Pharaoh you know Moses was waiting an
[1:18:21] experience he wanted to have an
[1:18:23] experience with God
[1:18:26] needed that experience from the back of
[1:18:28] the
[1:18:29] desert you know and once the lord gave
[1:18:32] him that
[1:18:34] experience and once the Lord met him you
[1:18:37] know Moses went to fight Pharaoh with
[1:18:39] the
[1:18:40] stick you know the prophet said that
[1:18:42] people could have asked Moses Moses
[1:18:44] where are you
[1:18:46] going you know Moses answered was I'm
[1:18:48] going to
[1:18:50] conquer you people will ask him what are
[1:18:52] you going to conquer with
[1:18:55] you know Moses tell tell them with this
[1:18:57] stick you know that sounded crazy you
[1:19:01] know you know that is crazy you know
[1:19:04] you're going to conquer the greatest
[1:19:06] army in the world with a simple stick
[1:19:11] you know they have those armors they
[1:19:12] have those
[1:19:14] weapons you know they have those
[1:19:16] arrows but you going to conquer them
[1:19:19] with the
[1:19:21] stick but people didn't see what was
[1:19:24] behind the
[1:19:25] ve you know Moses had an
[1:19:29] experience to B himself
[1:19:33] on you know Moses waited on the
[1:19:36] Lord and he had the word of the
[1:19:39] Lord conquer you know because the Lord
[1:19:43] will be with
[1:19:44] him and we see that Moses
[1:19:47] went and Moses conquered you know you
[1:19:50] might go through
[1:19:52] something you know that seems to be
[1:19:54] impossible
[1:19:56] it's nowhere to find it you know nowhere
[1:19:58] to find the
[1:20:00] solution you just have to have faith you
[1:20:04] know you just have to trust God you just
[1:20:07] have to wait upon him you know the Bible

[1:20:36] 8 Romans 8 26-
[1:20:41] 27 you know as
[1:20:43] God you know knew what Gideon
[1:20:47] needed you know Gideon needed a word of
[1:20:51] comfort you know to help him build up
[1:20:54] his
[1:20:55] face you to help him worship
[1:20:58] God and to go to fight to go and
[1:21:01] fight you know here's the
[1:21:04] word that that is that will Comfort

[1:23:30] them no more you know because God is
[1:23:33] about to fight our
[1:23:34] battle and if you read the entire
[1:23:38] chapter you know you read the chapter
[1:23:40] the that chapter and the previous
[1:23:42] chapter
[1:23:43] before you know you will see that the
[1:23:46] God you know tell
[1:23:48] Moses and he said that Moses with this
[1:23:51] with my strong
[1:23:53] hand I deliver you you know which means
[1:23:56] that God will have God himself will
[1:23:58] fight it for
[1:24:00] you you know with his strong hand God
[1:24:02] will
[1:24:03] deliver you know one time I preached
[1:24:05] about the Redemption by Blood and by

[1:24:12] Redemption by power of the
[1:24:14] Lord God himself will come down you know
[1:24:18] to fight for you you know after God
[1:24:21] saved you from from from

[1:24:26] Blood you you will still have trials you
[1:24:30] will still have things to to fight you
[1:24:32] know God now will have to redeem You by
[1:24:34] his with his
[1:24:36] power which means that himself will come
[1:24:39] down to fight your
[1:24:40] battle he will have Victory you know we
[1:24:44] see job we see the the trial that job's
[1:24:47] had you know that help us to understand
[1:24:50] how to wait upon the
[1:24:51] Lord you know when all his wife you know
[1:24:56] his friends you know was coming against
[1:24:59] him you know telling him to forsake his
[1:25:02] God you know job had to wait upon the
[1:25:05] Lord you know he told them I know one
[1:25:08] thing that I know my redeemer
[1:25:11] living one day you know though this body
[1:25:15] you know though this body you
[1:25:17] know you know though this body forsake
[1:25:21] me you know though everybody forsake me
[1:25:24] you know my faith is on God you know my
[1:25:27] my my I still believe in God you know
[1:25:30] sooner or later you know I know God will
[1:25:33] come to my rescue it didn't matter how
[1:25:36] long job had to wait you know God you
[1:25:39] know he still had faith and God came to
[1:25:42] his rescue you know go God told Abraham
[1:25:45] God gave Abraham a
[1:25:47] promise I will give you a child but God
[1:25:50] didn't tell him when it will give him a
[1:25:52] child
[1:25:54] Abraham had to wait upon the Lord you
[1:25:57] know as the prophet say that you know 10
[1:25:59] years after Sarah asked
[1:26:03] Abraham when is that child is going to
[1:26:05] come you know Abraham said that God said
[1:26:08] it you know we just have to believe it
[1:26:12] one day that child will come you know it
[1:26:14] doesn't matter how long we can wait you
[1:26:17] know we stay we just have to have faith
[1:26:20] you know something amazing with
[1:26:22] God you know God tested Abraham's Faith
[1:26:26] you know because if you see you read the
[1:26:28] the Genesis chapter
[1:26:30] 20 you know verse 17 to
[1:26:33] 18 you'll see that God you know before
[1:26:36] that God gave the promise to
[1:26:39] Abraham Abraham was waiting for a
[1:26:43] child but here in Genesis 20 verse 17 to
[1:26:48] 18 you know the Bible says that so
[1:26:52] Abraham prayed unto God
[1:27:01] and God healed
[1:27:03] ab and his wife and his made
[1:27:06] servants and they bear
[1:27:09] children now Verse 18 the Bible say for
[1:27:12] the Lord had fast uh for the Lord had
[1:27:15] fast closed up all the wombs of the
[1:27:17] House of ab because of Sarah Abraham's
[1:27:20] wife
[1:27:24] so now here
[1:27:26] Abraham who God first promised to give a
[1:27:31] child God didn't give him a child
[1:27:35] yet you know he was waiting on God to
[1:27:38] give him a
[1:27:39] child but here is the same God telling
[1:27:43] Abraham to go pray for
[1:27:46] ab to have a child you know Abraham
[1:27:49] didn't ask Lord to say but Lord you know
[1:27:52] what AM is going to say you know my
[1:27:54] myself I prayed to you to to give me a
[1:27:56] child you didn't give him you didn't
[1:27:58] give me
[1:28:03] first I hear you telling me to to go
[1:28:06] pray for somebody to have a
[1:28:08] child you know Abraham didn't care about
[1:28:11] all of
[1:28:12] that because Abraham knew one
[1:28:15] thing that that the Lord said it you
[1:28:18] know I'm pretty sure the Lord said it
[1:28:21] and I believe it you know it doesn't
[1:28:23] matter how long I have to wait you know
[1:28:26] God will give me a child so I'm going to
[1:28:29] pray for him you know with the same
[1:28:32] faith that I have you know and God's
[1:28:34] going to give him a child we know that
[1:28:37] the Bible tells us Abraham to wait about
[1:28:39] 20 or 25
[1:28:44] years and finally God gave him a child
[1:28:48] and I usually say that if
[1:28:50] Abraham you know ask God for a child
[1:28:54] God after a year God gave him a
[1:28:56] child you know that that verse or or
[1:29:00] that experience will not impact many
[1:29:03] people as that experience is impacting
[1:29:05] people
[1:29:09] now because the longer God you know the
[1:29:11] the longer God takes to
[1:29:17] answer the great is the testimony behind
[1:29:21] it you know that testimony helped many
[1:29:24] people down the
[1:29:25] [Music]
[1:29:26] road you know we see that people who was
[1:29:30] Barren you know there saw that Abraham
[1:29:33] had to wait for 25
[1:29:35] years you know both of them passed the
[1:29:37] menopause
[1:29:40] age but God had to renew
[1:29:43] them you know and God gave them a
[1:29:46] child you know we see the
[1:29:48] prophet for 40 years the prophet had to
[1:29:52] pray God to deliver him from from
[1:29:59] gastritis you know for 40 years the
[1:30:01] prophet was praying
[1:30:03] God you know to deliver him from that
[1:30:06] sickness you know but we see that the
[1:30:08] same
[1:30:10] Prophet you know was there praying for
[1:30:13] people you know who were receiving their
[1:30:15] healing at the same place at the same
[1:30:19] second you know we see the same Prophet
[1:30:22] who saw a man a child
[1:30:25] you know who had a car
[1:30:27] accident and his body was all over the
[1:30:30] places you know he prayed for that man
[1:30:34] you know and and that and we see people
[1:30:36] saw the body coming you know coming
[1:30:38] together and built again one one
[1:30:44] body you know we see the same Prophet
[1:30:48] you know speaking the word you know
[1:30:51] stopping the storm calming the storm
[1:30:54] you know giving give
[1:30:56] giving head ride you know the salvation
[1:30:59] of of of his
[1:31:02] children you know giving life back to
[1:31:05] the to the
[1:31:07] fish you know we see the same Prophet
[1:31:10] praying for blind men and they recover
[1:31:13] their
[1:31:15] sight but here is that same
[1:31:18] Prophet you know struggling with the
[1:31:20] Sickness
[1:31:24] years you know never one time we heard
[1:31:27] in the tape the prophet complaining
[1:31:29] about what the Lord was doing to
[1:31:32] him you know he mother so so a
[1:31:37] dream his mother so a
[1:31:40] dream about six Dov you know coming to
[1:31:43] to sit on his
[1:31:48] chest you know the prophet told him you
[1:31:50] know I'm waiting for that seventh
[1:31:54] when that seventh will come that's when
[1:31:56] the healing will
[1:31:57] be you know he waited for so long but
[1:32:02] yet never one time the prophet
[1:32:04] disbelieved
[1:32:06] God you know never one time the his
[1:32:10] faith
[1:32:14] decreased you know he was there
[1:32:16] believing in
[1:32:18] God and after that and then
[1:32:20] 65
[1:32:22] 1965 you know toward the end of his of
[1:32:25] his life you know God gave him his
[1:32:28] healing you know he saw the seventh day
[1:32:31] of
[1:32:32] coming and he was healed you know it
[1:32:35] didn't matter how long that Prophet had
[1:32:37] to
[1:32:39] wait God gave him his healing you know
[1:32:42] and with the inspiration of the Lord you
[1:32:45] know the prophet was inspired to add the
[1:32:47] last verse of this song of on the wings
[1:32:49] of the do
[1:32:54] says though I have suffered in many
[1:32:58] ways you know I cried for healing both
[1:33:01] night and
[1:33:03] day you know by faithful by faith was
[1:33:07] not forgotten by the father
[1:33:11] above you know he gave me signs on the
[1:33:13] wings of the
[1:33:15] dove you know I prayed for healing both
[1:33:18] night and
[1:33:18] day but my faith was not forgotten by
[1:33:21] the father
[1:33:24] you know you praying for deliverance
[1:33:26] both night and
[1:33:27] day you know you praying for your family
[1:33:30] to get together both night and
[1:33:33] day you pray for God to help you in the
[1:33:36] situation that you are both night and
[1:33:40] day you know you praying that God can
[1:33:43] help you to overcome this trial both
[1:33:45] night and
[1:33:48] day but I want to tell you something
[1:33:51] that that faith is not forgotten by the
[1:33:53] father is not for by
[1:33:56] father you know it's in God's
[1:33:59] Journal you know it's in God's
[1:34:01] book you know he knows the exact time
[1:34:04] that God has to show
[1:34:06] up
[1:34:09] you you know she prayed both night and
[1:34:11] day that Jesus can come and heal his
[1:34:13] brother
[1:34:16] Lazarus Lazarus was sick she waited for
[1:34:19] Jesus to show
[1:34:21] up Jesus show
[1:34:24] up Lazarus was di Lazarus passed
[1:34:28] away still Jesus didn't show
[1:34:31] up after four days you know Lazarus
[1:34:35] began to
[1:34:36] rot you know then here's Jesus showing
[1:34:40] up you know for Martha it was too
[1:34:43] late but for Jesus it wasn't too late
[1:34:47] you know for Jesus he was on time as if
[1:34:49] Lazarus was
[1:34:52] alive because he knew that nothing is
[1:34:54] impossible to
[1:34:56] him you know he knew that everything was
