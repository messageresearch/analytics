[Applause] oh oh [Music] [Music] is [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah [Music] me [Music] some new ones and uh you know we're just grateful for the opportunity to be here this evening by god's grace the lord just kind of worked it out that we had been wanting to be able to come out and brother brooks had a desire to have us come and minister but it didn't seem like things were going to work out but the lord you know the lord makes a way where there seems to be no way so we're just grateful to be here by god's grace and it's a little bit time spent a little bit already so maybe we'll just get right into the word here it's just good to be back at my second home in iowa you know i grew up in ohio and came out here for a number of years and this still feels like home number two to me you know when i go back to ohio it still feels like home that's where i spent most of my time and even though i've been down in texas now for going on seven years this still feels like my second home amen and uh no matter where you go where the spirit of the lord is it is home so right so we're so thankful for that uh just really uh grateful by the grace of god to be here so you just pray for me and you know no matter what you do you know if even if you don't feel like it that's why it's called a sacrifice of praise you know you know your flesh never feels like serving the lord but you know what we do is we sacrifice it every single day by putting it down putting that old man down dying to the flesh and living living for the the if we could say this way the inside man the the spirit man on the inside so let's just turn to a couple passages of scripture this evening galatians chapter 3 verses 1 through 10 would start at verse 1. i don't know how far we'll go reading down here and then from there we're going to go to second timothy chapter three and then from there we're gonna go to matthew chapter eight and uh i was telling brother brooks there when i got a chance to greet him here before service you know my heart my heart's full you see brother brother keith and brother troy and his family and just different ones that we haven't seen in a long time and it's just you know it's so encouraging to see soldiers still standing on the front lines you know especially in the hour that we're living in so we thank the lord for that and we'll start in galatians chapter 3. it says starting in verse 1 o foolish galatians who hath bewitched you that ye should not obey the truth but for whose eyes jesus christ hath been evidently set forth crucified among you this only what i learn of you received ye the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith are ye so foolish having begun in the spirit are you now made perfect by the flesh have ye suffered so many things in vain if it be yet in vain he therefore that ministereth to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you doeth he by it doeth he it by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith even as abraham believed god and it was accounted to him for righteousness know ye therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of abraham and the scripture for seeing that god would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto abraham saying in thee shall all nations be blessed so then they which are of be of faith are blessed with faithful abraham amen and then we're going to go to second timothy chapter three maybe just kind of a disparate seeming group of scriptures here but we're just trusting that the lord will lead us in where we're supposed to go start to second timothy chapter three we'll read verses one through five this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection truth breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away and then we're going to go over to matthew chapter eight and uh this evening we'll just see where the lord would go i i have a uh you know how the lord puts sometimes seems like your heart's just kind of bursting with thoughts that he maybe the lord might desire to express but we're just trusting that he'll go exactly where he wants us to go matthew chapter 8 verses 5-10 and when jesus was entered into capernaum there came unto him a centurion beseeching him and saying lord my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy grievously tormented and jesus saith unto him i will come and heal him the centurion answered and said lord i am not worthy that thou should has come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed for my for i am a man under authority having soldiers under me and i say to this man go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it when jesus heard it he marveled and said to them that followed verily i say unto you i have not found so great faith no not in israel amen remember what the prophet the prophet told us he said that that that's a gentile faith right there that's a gentile faith amen that's the faith whether you believe it or not maybe maybe you haven't been persuaded yet but that's the faith that you possess right there amen let's just power heads in the word of prayer heavenly father lord as we've just come lord that once again has fallen our lot lord to to minister the word of life oh god but we know lord no man can truly minister the word but lord you just given a gift to get out of the way lord but we're desiring father that you would speak to your children this evening father we could certainly rejoice over the scriptures in an intellectual fashion and see lord the many wonderful christ you yourself doesn't come and break the word of life to the hearts of the believer it would profit us nothing oh god lord you said we could know all mysteries but if we didn't have charity it availeth nothing and we know charity is you lord in the person of the holy ghost lord we're asking right now oh god that you would walk up now the isles of the hearts of your children this evening lord have your perfect will and way done oh god we're not here to hear from a man lord but to hear from you bless the speaker lord myself i don't ask a blessing just for myself lord in any carnal sense but oh god that i would get out of the way lord that you would be glorified get glory unto yourself lord and bless the hearers lord that they may also get out of the way lord if there be anything that would be binding them lord anything that would be trying to hinder the work of god lord you gave your children authority father we come in the authority in the name of jesus christ to bind that spirit lord whatever it might be and we cast it down to the head of hell from once it came lord may you have your perfect will and way this evening lord in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen you may have your seats by god's grace we just if we give a title uh i just maybe speak on the power of obedience and as a subtitle we want to speak of authority under headship and i guess it's just been impressed upon me lately what the lord's really put on my heart so much lately is uh in the world that we're living in in such a gross darkness we understand that it would be a it would be a darkness among the people gross darkness so much that could be felt and i believe each one of us can feel that darkness you know pressing every single day that we live you know we see if you pay any attention to the things that are going on in the world you understand it's absolute insanity there's no doubt that uh the only the only sane the only sane person is a christian in this in this world but you know i'm impressed more and more you know as we've come into so much knowledge and revelation that we've received to the hearing of the word in this hour if i could say the thing that's come to my mind more and more is that when this is all said and done it's nothing but grace that's right because i feel and i've noticed if i could just maybe point the finger at myself a little bit i've noticed that as you come more and more into a knowledge of the saving grace of the lord through the message that we've received amen there is such a tendency of man because man always wants to see something they can put their hands to that's true but we understand if we go all the way back the lord even foreshadowed this all the way back in the old testament in the very beginning when he said i believe it was in deuteronomy the lord said if you would make an altar unto me he said make it of pile the stones one upon another and he said don't even lift your tool upon these stuff he said because if you lift your tool upon the stones he said you polluted my altar and what happens is so many times this man desires to do a service for god because they know that there is something disconnecting them from the lord that's right and and we've understood since the very beginning when man fell in the garden of eden that they had a they had a grace that they didn't even know they had i believe our uh uh brother branham called it he called it it was it was a holy veil that was upon the eyes of his children on adam and eve in the garden so much so that they were covered with so much holiness that they didn't even know they were naked and there was no shame and a person on the outside that would look what maybe in our minds would look upon it and say well that's a crazy thing but because there was so much holiness that was there that they couldn't even see that supposed shame there wasn't even shame to be had amen because they were so underneath the veil of holiness amen and that wasn't a veil of anything that they had done there was a freely given veil simply by being underneath the covenant that they had received amen a holiness covenant underneath the word of god amen provided a veil of holiness in so much that there wasn't even anything to be ashamed of and how the devil tries to steal that veil of holiness from his people in this hour and that's why we read in galatians paul says to them he says oh foolish galatians who hath bewitched you that sounds really similar to what we found in the garden of eden how the serpent beguiled eve amen even paul would tell tell the to tell the people later on in another epistle he said i fear lest as the serpent beguile thee by his septility you would be beguiled away from the truth of god the what he called the simplicity in christ because we come to so much knowledge of this world amen so many wonderful revelations and i glory in the revelation i thank the lord for the right it gives me well even paul said he said i'll sing with the understanding he said i'll preach with the understanding i want to have the understanding but if we're not careful we'll come too far into the other side of it and find out that knowledge puffeth up amen and we've received a great treasure of knowledge in this hour amen but brothers and sisters i want to have the mind of our apostle paul he said i desire to know nothing among you save christ and him crucify amen that's what i want to have amen i i want to i i've i've had such impressed upon me lately because if it's if it's not going to be grace to get us out of here what else is it going to be amen were you made did you receive this message by your works and denomination did you receive this word of the hour by your works out there in the world when you didn't even care about god that's right no but you received it by the hearing of faith through the grace of the lord jesus christ did you receive the holy ghost because you went and did this great work or did this great thing but by simply pause that it was because you've obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine that was delivered unto you amen amen didn't even obey it necessarily all in the flesh he said you obeyed it in the heart amen because when you heard the word of god there was something inside of you that cried out that be so amen amen you didn't even know what it was you couldn't understand it to this day you probably still don't understand it to some extent yeah when when you're at it feels like you're at the end of your frazzled rope yeah and you want to throw your hands up and you just want to lay down and die but there's something holding on to you on the inside of the inside that you even if you wanted to give up yes sir amen i confess to you in my flesh my wife wouldn't even tell you there's been times i said i just want to give up yeah i'm tired of it i can't do it but then there's something then when that moment comes and there's that flesh that feels it's just warring and warmth there's something on the inside that stands up amen it says though he slay me yet i trust him that turns back to the word and then the devil tries to whisper in your ear and say you can't do it and there's something in the word that says that's right you can't do it you never could do it you still can't do it but there is a god there is a blood there is a holy ghost that can do it for you that's already done it for you amen amen that's right have we frustrated the grace of god by trying to perfect ourselves by by carnal works yes sir brothers and sisters i believe in works i think we honestly don't have enough of them sometimes because the devil's hamstrung us to the point where we feel like if the lord puts something in our heart to do he's right there to say well you're just trying to work for your own salvation no it's because i'm saved it's because his holy ghost is in me that i desire to do something for it [Applause] but i know that nothing that i do that's not what grants me salvation that doesn't give me standing with god but it's because he's changed my life it's because he changed my desires it's because he's completely turned me around that i desire to do those things but it's so simple it'll pass right over us that's the don't we do we live in an age of complexity yes sir infinite complexity everywhere you go the computer's getting smaller and smaller and more complex your job tasks they seem simpler because you just point and click yeah right but then they pile on 500 million more of them than you ever had before how is it when we have computing power to do millions of things a day we have less time than we ever did because it's a deception from the devil that's real knowledge of good and evil sucking the life from the people we've got to become simpler we've got to become more humble yeah we've got to get out of our own ideas of what this what this life is in jesus christ amen we've we've we've come i believe i feel that we've come to expect the wrong things what exactly are we expecting in this hour what are we expecting because you get what you expect you get what you expect but if what you expect isn't according to the word then you're going to be looking for something that ain't ever going to come amen yes sir this is totally different from what i was going to preach but i'm just going to go this way anyway because that's why i feel led to go amen you think about what the devil has got the people see right now the the lie that the devil is selling to the people is that we have so much knowledge in this message that we've got it all figured out that's right brother that we can nail it down to a t exactly when where what how why it's gonna happen yes sir but it's it's not that way because if it was that way it couldn't be a faith it could not be of faith if you knew it if you knew it up here it cannot be faith it can't be because it once it goes into the intellectual thing see when i turn my car i don't know enough about a car to know how every part works so i live by faith i believe that when i turn the ignition i know some basics but i don't know all the the the crank ratios and the gear ratios and all that stuff but i don't need to know i know by experience that it works when i turn the key same thing with this word i don't need to know exactly how it's going to do it but i know that when that key has been entered into the right throw that holy ghost is entered into my heart and god turns that key and ain't you turning the key but when god turns that key it's gonna fire why because it's it's the faith that he's placed in his people amen we make it so complicated well if i do this and if i do this and if i do this god will do this no he promised it because you can't do it yourself amen and so many times we frustrate ourselves by beating our head against the wall but what are you expecting from god see abraham see sarah when god promised abraham a son by sarah sarah who's the type of the bride thought she'd get an idea she thought well i can figure out how god's gonna do it abraham who represented the word because the prophet represents the word he said you go and go with this this bond woman yeah see god allowed it just like he'll allow you to sow to the wind and reap a whirlwind sometimes he'll allow it and say all right you're going to suffer but i'll let you do it just to prove to you that my word is the ultimate and there's no way around it sarah you're gonna have it yeah right amen i'm here to tell you tonight you're going to have it dude i don't care how many times you've tried to mingle this word with your own ideas it'll bring forth the wild man every time but she had a certain expectation of how it might come because her patients couldn't quite take it yet right she knew there was a promise there she's heard it from abraham yeah but she just couldn't quite accept it for herself amen amen you know the scripture says that that she that sarah received strength to conceive seed it said having been persuaded you know what god's trying to do to you right now he's trying to persuade you he's trying to persuade you right now of one simple fact that what god has promised that he is able to perform that's what he let god persuade you tonight let him persuade you that when he says something about you that is thus saith the lord and it has to come to pass you can stand on that rock you can stand on that revelation when he gives you that revelation that i am christ i am god and i change not i have the same yesterday today and forever if you come to me on the same basis that they came to me back there i will perform exactly the same way that i performed back there the problem is though it doesn't always come in the way that you're meant to your carnal mind expects it to come this rapture is going to be so humble it's going to be so simple and they're going to miss it a million miles because they're looking for some great thing to happen they don't know that a little church of maybe 30 people yeah in des moines iowa on a wednesday night pretty soon 30 people gone they wouldn't know nothing about it i'm believing everybody in here one of these days it's just gone not even gonna know what happened he'd say but i thought yeah i thought that we're gonna run through a troop i thought we were gonna leap over a wall yeah what are you expecting that's right here's my quest that's my question what do you expect that's right because i tell you what the word told me yeah yeah yeah yeah the word said that when that one came crying voice crying in the wilderness makes straight the path of the lord it said the hills the mountains would melt like wax they said the hills would leap like little rams they said the high places would be made low the crooked place is made straight the rough place is made plain amen amen but i tell you what when he fulfilled that word it was one man one crazy looking man down by the river yet repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand that is the great god said that was the greatest man born of a woman up to that point and he said but the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than him yes that's you okay i'll say that's me i'm the least in the kingdom yes i'll say i won't just say it for you you may be greater that's fine but for me i may be the least i'm the least but i'm greater than that but if he fulfilled it that way that time what will it be this time oh we hear about tent visions we hear about third poles we hear about missing limbs being restored i believe all of that amen i believe why because i'm waiting for some of it myself and it's already coming that hands my head you know about my hand being almost cut off it's coming brother you know what and it won't be an open show and that's fine but i believe you'll see it because you got a chance to witness the beginning of it you'll see the ending of it i believe it 100 by the grace of god i don't know how he's going to do it i don't know where he's going to do it i don't know whether he's going to do it i don't care who knows about it but i know one thing i don't know about it and then when i do you'll know about it it may not get plastered over the newspapers for all i know we could be underground in house churches by then i don't know but one thing i know he that begun a good work he is faithful to performance and i have been persuaded right i have been persuaded that what he promised he's able to perform that's right you know how i know because i've tried to run hallelujah i've tried to fail i've tried to beat my head i've tried he care you won't let me go amen praise the lord jesus that i'm a prisoner praise the lord amen i didn't do it i didn't ask for it yes sir he did it to me and i can't help but love him because of it although he slayed me yet i'll trust him oh i've made my complaints known i've spent i've spilled many an idol word but you know what i'm not relying on my power i'm relying upon the grace of god i am relying on his grace to see me through he promised it he will finish it how i don't know all i know is we've got these big carnal ideas of what's about to happen when this rapture comes but i know one thing enoch was the type of the bride and there's only about five scriptures in the whole bible written about it what do you think we're gonna be why because the lord jesus god loves to hide a thing he said he said it's the glory of the lord to conceal a man i love it it's his glory to conceal it he said but the hidden things belong to us glory to god those hidden things they belong to me that's why i can say i know i'm there you know what you say brother oh i thought we're gonna leap over a wall you run through a troop you don't if you could see the troop of demons you had to run through to come to this service today amen you're running 200 million that's 200 million demons lose from the river euphrates that's right you ran through a troop to get here you didn't even know it you know me you owe me stronghold walls you leap over every single day just to try just that for god to give you a heart to serve him in this hour and not only to serve him but to serve him according to the revealed worthy hour see the pharisees were convinced that they had it all oh we know how he's going to come we've got all this we've got all that a bunch of pharisees and sadducees had their minds so made up they had their expectations set so when he came in a manger in a stable in the form of a baby they couldn't receive it so how will it be now how will be now i can't claim to say that i know exactly what it's going to look like according to the according what we're going to see on the outside but i know the life that it lives by the word i know the nature that it has by the word because if there's one thing we've learned through the holy ghost and the revealing of the word it's that it's his nature that doesn't change his nature doesn't change so we think oh my we get all these carnal things and the devil beat you down because oh you're not doing this great thing and you're not doing that great thing and you're not it's never been about you anyway so get yourself out of the equation but what is he doing through you what is he doing for you do you have a desire to serve god praise the lord do you have a desire deep down in your heart to live this message so close that there's no separation between you and your savior that's god that is that is such a treasure that you don't even know you hold yeah if you could cling to that just cling to that and hold on to it and stop it say lord get my expectation out of the way amen let your expectation be made known to me it's the grace of god that's gonna do it in romans chapter four let's turn there and read the scripture here i'm just you know i get excited because the more and more i see it brothers and sisters the more and more i realize it's such a fixed game it's such a rigged situation he wants someone to believe him to the end amen he wants a mesh a shadrach meshach and abednego yes he wants someone that ain't going to bow the knee even if it looks like all hope is lost he wants someone that like daniel that even when the the career is made he just keeps serving the lord now i don't know what they're going to do but i'm going to serve by god doesn't matter what it looks like romans chapter 4 verses 14 to 16 it said for if they which are of the law be heirs then faith is made void and the promise made of none effect because the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgression now i want you to listen to this next scripture therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace so it's not of it's not of your works we already know that these are simple things brothers and sisters but i believe that as the hour gets late you see you you start to realize that the close you get to the lord jesus and i believe he's been drawing this closer and closer you may not feel it but he's doing it because the only the only way you can stand in this hour is to cling more closely to him it's the only way that you can stand i don't stand here by my own ability i i know and none of you do either i'm sorry to burst your bubble if you thought you did so well but only one ran the race in one amen only one one and by the grace of god i was in him but i want therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace i love this to the end that means for the purpose this is the reason why he made it this way that the promise might be sure to all the seeds so he made it so simple you believe that with that faith that's inside and because of that he made the promise completely sure to you that sure means it's solid it's steadfast you know the scripture says that when god made the promise to abraham he said he because there was no greater he swore by himself that's right he said because there's a couple of immutable things he said in which it is impossible for god to lie amen see and the devil has been trying in this hour now to steal away the promise that you've received when you heard this message when the holy ghost came and revealed himself to you and filled you and sealed you away god gave you a promise he said you are sealed until the day of your redemption he said he said when i come will i find faith in the earth that's what he's looking for right now amen he said he didn't say will i find these great works will i find these mighty people doing these crazy things that that are just gonna like shock everybody and ever no he said when he comes will he find faith in the earth amen is there someone that will stand on the word of god no matter what it looks like no matter if they have to stand alone doesn't matter what church you belong to it doesn't matter who your supposed friends are or whatever it might be wherever you are because this is an individual affair this is an hour right now brothers and sisters we've never been more connected right with the internet and all these different things and yet we've never been so alone in a lot of ways because the devil's got us running to and fro here and there everywhere but the one thing is i'm telling you is that it is coming down it's an individual affair between you and god you and jesus christ have to meet in that in that bedroom you have to meet in the spiritual bedroom and become one that's right because you coming to higher ground tabernacle ain't enough that's right it ain't enough it's a good start it's a good start you're fulfilling the word of god by being here that's right yes sir but it's time this is uniting time this is where christ and his bride are meeting in that closet amen and and by bride i'm not talking about the collective here this comes down to individuals you and god every from littlest to oldest from youngest oldest it doesn't matter it's between you and god and it's all by grace you know i was i was we were driving down the road this was uh probably like a month month and a half ago and i had a lot of things on my mind at the time and we were driving back from a chiropractor appointment and we were sitting at a stoplight and i looked and i saw one of those big road signs that have like the orange letters you know that have the the lights the orange lights that make the letters and they put like the road traffic conditions and stuff on there and i looked up and i just been really praying like lord i really i really you know i just you know need more of the lord me more of the holy ghost just more him and just had some different things on my on my heart and i looked up and i saw it and it had uh it just said test test and just something struck me when i saw that and and surely you know maybe there's a guy that was doing a test on the board i don't know but there was something that i knew that was for me and i thought oh my i was going through a modern mind battles at the time about some certain things and said oh dear here we go oh my god and i it didn't i wouldn't it didn't discourage me but it certainly made me wary you know you start oh my here we go looking around every corner where's the test test and i kind of was meditating on that and i was i was just rejoicing because i said lord i know you showed that to me for a purpose so i'm i'm believing you know for everybody and i don't know if that's already happened or if it's to come it doesn't matter because the scripture says you know when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god will raise up the state so i don't i don't fear those things but the lord really blessed me in it because i started meditating i said lord test test that's you know i thought i started thinking about daniel yeah yeah and daniel said man they may take a little farce and he said because it said many twice he said the thing is so sure that it's gonna happen i said oh my this me that test is coming and i and but something spoke to me later i think it was later the day or the next day and all of a sudden i started i was just kind of thinking and and the lord brought it to my heart and said but the capstone came down crying grace great i said praise the lord i said there's grace grace for the test test he always covers it for me by the grace of god but i joined thinking about those things and brothers and sisters there isn't you know jesus had to tell peter he said satan has desired to sift you like wheat he said but i prayed for you amen amen i prayed for you he prayed for me he prayed for you and i say thank the lord i was there when he prayed for peter i was in it when i was in him he was praying for me because right now is that shifting time if we haven't seen a sifting time like anything we've ever seen i mean there's there's the spiritual bats there's the natural bats there's your covet stuff there's your government stuff there's your family stuff there's your every other thing you can imagine is just piling on but it's got to be grace you can't do it no you can't do it and i believe at least for me i know for me i i won't speak for anybody else because it's an individual affair but i know what the lord tell speaks to me is the failures that you're going through right now the battles that you're fighting right now that sometimes you seem to come up short are all to prove to you that it's not about your ability it was never about your ability because because sarah remember sarah being a type of that bride she was promised to receive seed she she was she was given a promise through abraham now remember she didn't receive the promise directly she received it through her husband i received the promise through jesus christ but it wasn't remember brother branham said that when sarah laughed at the promise i can tell you right now there's been times i've laughed at the promise i've looked at myself in the mirror and i'm talk i'm not talking about the natural meaning i'm talking about the mirror of god's word and sometimes you see your own reflection instead of seeing his and when you see your own reflection you kind of hold lord there is sometimes and i i this doesn't sound sacrilegious but i'm just being honest sometimes you you could you what is it that devil tries to get you in that carnal mindset get you out of the grace of god and into like what into what you can accomplish you say lord there is no way you laughed at the promise of god i have i don't know about you i have but the but the grace of god he would have slayed us a long time ago he would have slayed me a long time ago but the promise was never dependent upon my ability that's right that's true because when he made you the promise if he turned his back on you now i'll tell you what your prophet said he wouldn't be god that's right because he can't change his mind about his word and remain god so when he gave me the promise i say lord all i can cling to is you can't lie you promised amen that's what i'm relying upon i know it sounds so simple but right now all i know for me is my flaws have been magnified lately everywhere you go it's a it's a it's pr remember it's that letting off the pressure time the pressure the pressure the pressure you know we talk about the squeeze to squeeze the squeeze the squeeze is happening right now if you don't feel the spiritual pressure then you probably haven't crossed over jordan yet and entered the back because you don't fight until you cross doors that's right and i tell you right now that spiritual pressure is building that spiritual pressure is on all sides forgive me i probably shouldn't even say but i just think i was thinking uh sister kim had me had us bring our instant pot it just made me think of pressure cookers we've never thought about pressure cookers for years pressure cookers are back in style now you know why because we're in a pressure cooker it's that we're this is the time where god is letting that devil put that pressure on you because you know what it takes to mold something it takes pressure that sandpaper is rubbing that iron is sharpening eye the the the hammer the master's hammer is hammering away at you by the word knocking off the big piece and then when he's got the big pieces knocked off then the you thought that was bad he laughed off a piece here he locked off a piece there but you know where it really gets down to the nitty-gritty when he pulls out that 300 grit sandpaper and starts to rub it why because that's where it lasts a long time the pain lasts a while the pain and it doesn't seem like the gains seem to be that much it doesn't seem like great things are happening but that's where the master is taking all those fine details that he wants to see in your life and he's going to manifest those details he's taken the grit of this world and he's putting that sandpaper the word on you and he's molding you he's revving it but what does it do sometimes it takes a little grit it takes some water you ever seen him do those things with stones remember you're a lively stone that he's forming into his image amen they've had when they when they polish those stones they take that real fine grit sandpaper and then what do they do they put it under the water they put it under the water of that word and he tries to rub it oh my it hurts he's rubbing that that sandpaper on you that word but what is he doing he's getting all those burrs off he's getting all those little pristine prices away from you he's getting all those little five details see once you thought no you know what years ago oh yeah they're smoking and drinking and all those things it's pretty obvious now you stayed away from that but then maybe something you thought was okay to let go for a while now all of a sudden the lord shines a spotlight on he puts the sandpaper down and starts rubbing and all of a sudden you kind of oh there's something inside you that i used to kind of like that i thought it was acceptable but now it just doesn't seem like it's edifying to the lord anymore i gotta get rid of it and you start to think why why why can't i just kind of take it easy and go about my life everybody else seems so free but i'm a prisoner of christ there's something in me that that wants in every little detail to please my husband amen he wants he's looking for a bride that is completely submissive to the husband he is not going to have a bride that's contentious he's not going to have a bride that gets her own way he's not going to have a bride that argues with him about what he wants done he is going to have a bride that is humble and submissive and his very least desire is our greatest desire oh see paul said he said speaking about husbands and wives he said this is a great mystery he said but i speak concerning christ in the church see we take all of those natural things and we sometimes laser focus in the natural oh husbands love your wives as christ will let the church wives submit yourself to your husbands and everything that it's pleasing unto the lord and those things are true even in the natural but let's take it deeper than that you you are the bride of christ if you be the bride of christ then wives submit yourselves to your husband amen in all things and one thing about that husband and you can assure he'll never tell you to do something against the word i may mess up and do something wrong and my wife would have have a right to say i'm not doing that it's against the word but i this husband my husband jesus christ he is the word he'll never ask you to do something outside that word and he'll never ask me to do something that he didn't already do himself and they'll never ask me to do something that he didn't already do for me oh we got to do these works and we got to do this and i've got to i've got to do this and that everything that you've done he did for you he just blesses you with the grace to be there when it happened he blessed you to be a vessel that he could work through but paul said he said what did you have what do you have that you did not receive what do you have that you didn't receive where could we get any boasting from people want to even even thinking about oh i want to do these works i want to have these rewards i'm going to lay it all down to his feet anyway because he did it for me oh you maybe you could go in the message and find quotes where he talks about this and that and this and that oh that's fine i don't care if that's to me that's even still carnal yeah because i i just want to see him hey you know what my reward is going to be seeing him being with him being out of this old flash this pest house being reunited with the loved ones that went before being able to rejoice without fear or thoughts of any anything no devil ever hindering you ever again but we get so caught up in ourselves but he's looking for a bride that's going to be so surrendered to him you know in the book i think i was sharing this with brother brooks maybe a few weeks ago and the lord just really revealed this in a special way to me we know in the book of proverbs solomon talks about that contentious wife he said it's better to dwell on the corner of the corner of the rooftop than than to be with a brawling woman you know he's not just talking about the natural wife and husband relationship if you were wondering why the lord seems distant from you well maybe you should check your nature are you a brawling wife to to the lord if he doesn't seem so close to you what's been your attitude towards him have we been softened the way we ought to because this world is doing everything it can to harden it is doing everything it can to desensitize you everywhere you look is evil you need to almost be a hermit to get away from it and i'm trying to be more of that by his grace oh you say well that's crazy brother you know i want to please him [Applause] i want what enters my eyes to please him i want one enters my ears to please it i want what what i'm what i'm surrounded by to please him because enoch had this testimony that he walked with god he pleased god amen it's that simple well i'm going to do this and i'm going to do that it may be so i i believe that the lord can you know the lord will work miracles through every one of us i pray that it be the case but the only miracle i'll tell you what the only miracle i'm living for is that body change that's the only miracle i'm living for everybody else can build what they want to build everybody else can do what they want to do as long as he vindicates that word by bringing it to pass in me i'll be all right because i don't i don't care about myself i'm a useless individual if it wasn't for him i'd be nothing but a dung hill we get so pumped up by the talk of being bride there's a message he preached of choosing of a bride you did not choose me but i have chosen you praise me to the living god for his choosing why because when you can look at me and say god was crazy to choose you i could say that may be true but he did it anyhow and you can't change it and i won't change it amen i ain't gonna try to change his mind about me i feel like sometimes i'm trying moses tried to do it tried to change god's mind about himself so but i can't speak i can't do this i can't do that that's all right he's going to get you there anyhow he's looking for a bride see the problem is we've got this idea of well we've received the word so we've got this we have this and i see it different places where people just have this this kind of mentality of well we're going to go out and do this great thing and to my mind it's kind of it's a denominational mentality because what it is is trying to force the word of god into this box that he didn't create but what he wants is complete submission to the word because it's only that full obedience to the word and so maybe just we'll go real quickly here we don't want to it's probably late already lord have mercy but we'll just go a little bit farther matthew 8 and we'll read verse 3 verse 5 through 10 again we talk about that centurion he said he goes into capernaum and we understand the story the centurion says my servant is sick and tormented he said i'll come and heal him he said i'm not even worthy that thou should have come under my roof but speak the word only my servant shall be healed he said for i am a man under authority having soldiers unto me now i want you to catch this he did what did he say he said he said i'm a man of authority no he did not say i'm a man of authority he said i'm a man under authority i'm a man under authority there is a revelation that this centurion had that put him in a place where he could have such a faith in the grace of god that he didn't even need the what we would call the presence of god to be there because he knew what authority was he said i'm a man under authority he didn't say i'm a man of authority i'm a man under authority so there's something that happens this centurion understood that there is something that happens when a person comes under authority there is something that happens to the bride when she comes underneath the headship of her husband when she comes fully under the headship of her because you see as long as you're outside of that there's nothing that can be done for you because you've eliminated the authority over you because it's only the authority over you that gives you authority under you hallelujah that centurion understood why because the centurion he said i'm a man under authority whose authority was he under caesar and he understood because caesar had appointed him to this position he could tell this servant you go over here and he'll do it because he was under caesar he could say you go do this and he would do it and so because he had that revelation he could say because thou jesus the son of god are under the authority of god right right the son of god under the authority of god i don't even need you to do anything but say the word amen he said because i know that all of heaven backs you amen if i a man under caesar can have authority simply by being under the authority of caesar how much more would christ have authority being under the headship of god because remember the scripture said every the head of the woman is man and the head of the man is christ and the head of christ is god amen so if he's underneath the headship what if it was that much of authority to be had there then what is it for the bride if you could come under authority of this word in this house if you could come under the authority it's not about i will do this i'm gonna go do this because i've received the word so i've got power i can do this and i can do that i've got faith to move mountains i have this and i have that you do have it but if it's not used if it's not according to his will it profits nothing amen amen if it's outside of his world prophets nothing what would it have done david to say i desire to build a house for god and he had the ability to do it he was the king if when that prophet nathan came and said you're not going to build the house but your son and then david said but i'm the king i can do what i want because lord you gave me this authority as being the king but see david also understood being under a thorn he said lord i wouldn't have would have won for you anyway i'll follow you wherever i go so how much for us see it brings me back in mind brother brings me back to esther every time because there's something about esther when you start to see the character of esther and what she represented and how she represented this bride and how she could come to a place of being under that authority see vashtai's problem was she was not a wife under authority to her husband because when her husband called just for something simple i just want you to come and come into the the throne room so people could see how beautiful it was it was a beauty pageant for the queen could you imagine you th the king sister and said you are the most beautiful woman in the kingdom i want to show you to everybody because i'm proud to call you my wife and she just goes and has a dinner with her her girls said no i don't think so king i'll do whatever i want to do and what did this what did the servant say he said if this is noise abroad then all the women would despise their husbands in their eyes because you let it be so and so how could it be any other way in the spiritual if if we cannot come under the headship of christ see when jesus came in the flesh he was under authority he didn't come to live out moses message that's right he didn't come to live out noah's message he didn't come to live out elijah's message he didn't come to live out anything else he came only to live out what was spoken of him for his life he said i do nothing nothing but what the father showed me i do nothing is that the character of christ or is it not the character of christ if it be the character of christ is it to be our character or no yes sir amen amen i do nothing but what the father showeth me because that what the son saith the father do that do it the son likewise so if that's the character that he's bringing us to are we getting too much of a vast shy spirit when the king calls you to something simple pray for someone witness to somebody go here go there just even something simple or do we do we cast him to the side because i'll say lord you know i don't i don't think this or that or or or the best excuse because this is what the devil does to the believers well i've had a really rough day i'm just not good enough to do that you were never enough good enough to do it no matter what you did anyway it didn't matter how you could have spent five hours in prayer that morning before the lord told you to go witness to that person you still wouldn't have been good enough because it's not about you again that does see the devil will take you so far one way or the well then i don't have to pray i don't have to do nothing but the life of christ will bring those things into your eyes there's no doubt about it because the life of christ brings a character but if you're relying upon your works see that's what that's what the lord will do the lord will allow you to fall flat on your face to prove to you that your works didn't get you any closer to him i'm just i'm just telling you what it is because it's not about you it's not about your ability it's not if it was the lord wouldn't have chose a hillbilly kentuckian to bring a message for this hour if it was about ability he would have chosen a scholar he would have chosen someone who could do this or do that but he didn't he chose someone who was flawed he chose someone whether people want to believe it or not someone actually like you we've gotten to a place of of bringing people up to places where they're not supposed to be and i don't mean to say that we re we we glory before the lord for the the fact that he brought a prophet but he was a man of like passions like me and you know what encourages me is knowing that even though he could fall probably flat on his face and he's told us he he told us that in the message many times of how he would fail god and yet because his faith wasn't anchored in himself he could still get behind that pulpit and say i take every spirit under in here under my control for the glory of god why because god promised him to do that and he had enough faith in the grace of god to perform it no matter what the circumstance if it be so then without faith it's impossible to please god i know these things are really simple i've just it's so pressing on my heart brothers and sisters that we've got to come to such a place to realize that it's all about jesus christ it's all about jesus christ it's not going to be about you it never was about you it's about him and i praise the lord that he he he chose me before the foundation of the world amen that he he bestowed his grace upon me that he gave me a promise that he he brought me to a place where i could recognize that amen oh praise the lord so if we could just understand what that authority is you know brother branham told the story about that little policeman that would get out in the intersection there remember he and and you know he made it uh he made it a point to specifically talk about how this guy was a scrawny little weakling he even said in one place how his hat was kind of pulled way over down pushing his ears down because maybe his hat was too big and he was a scrawny little fella and his clothes might have been baggy what to show that it wasn't about him anyway because when he stood in that intersection and blew that whistle with that uniform he i think he said in one place he said he said that little guy might not have had enough power to stop a bicycle how many of you felt like that sometimes oh i don't feel like i could stop a bicycle but it wasn't about what his abilities were it's about who he represented and when you can know that you're in him and you know that all of heaven stands behind you if you be in this world when you come under that authority to the word there's not a devil in hell because all of heaven backs you amen that's why we could hear that when the weakest of christians gets on their knees the devil trembles why because it's not you think he trembles at the person no he trembles at what that person that christian represents because you're a representative of christ if the life of christ be in you you represent him on the earth and when the holy ghost dwells in you when that lies that very life of god that's why they could say it antioch these are christians because they represented christ there was an authority that they were under they were so much under the authority of christ to where they recognized it without even being told and they called them christians that's what i want my life to be i want my life to be so like his i want my life to be so bright if i can see it with this way so much bride of christ so much christ that i don't have to call myself pride that they'll call me brock they say why are you acting the way you're acting you're acting like you got a home that's not in this world you're acting like there's a life that's above all this other stuff because it's not about you it's not about the glory you can receive it's about the life of christ in you he wants us to come underneath that authority though you can't you cannot see power without character is satanic right that's why you see so many go off and just well i have faith to do this and they may get results they'll get results but it's satanic and they don't even know it it's a denominational spirit it's a nicolaitan spirit trying to bend the the word of god to their will you know the word obedience you look at it in the in the dictionary it says compliance with an order a request or law but i love the last part of it here it says or submission to another's authority see it's one thing to obey in one thing here and there you say well i'll just go do this and i'll just go do that the lord the lord jesus said in in the parable he said there were two he said what thank you he said there were there was a man who had two sons and the one he said go go do this and the one says i'm not gonna go and then his heart smoted him and he went and did it and then the other one said oh i'll go do it and he didn't do it he said which one did the will of the father so which one are we you know i'll be honest i'm the first one i know i'm the first one because i've done that many times the lord says go do this i said lord i can't do it and then i start to realize lord it's not about me anyway and i go i humble myself and i go do it anyhow why because it's because you start to react the devil is always putting the magnifying glass on your flesh come to a realization now brothers and sisters your flesh ain't coming with you to manifest the life of god through the flesh it's not it's not coming with you it's not coming with you so much so that the lord has to completely just get rid of it so he can give you a new body amen amen this body is death paul said who shall deliver me from the body of his death the body of this dead if paul could say the good that i would i do not but that what i don't want to do that's what i do oh wretched man that i am how many of you felt like that oh my and then when you come to a knowledge of this truth and you see you start to realize truly see when you're in denomination maybe i'll speak for at least myself you had no concept of holiness and i'm not just talking about dressing a certain way and and the carnal things that we do to manifest the holiness of god those are just carnal things anybody could any any woman could put a skirt on any per any woman could grow her hair out any man could dress in in a modest way but when you came to a revelation of the holiness of god when you understand that the angels are filthy in his sight and you start to realize as you get closer to god you remember the the story brother branham told about about the man who died and starts going towards that light he goes to the he goes to the the the gates he said we can't find your name here he said oh my gosh he said well you the only thing you do is appeal to the white throne so remember what happened he starts getting up to that light that light and as he got closer all the things that he thought were okay started to get darker all the things that thought were okay see that's what is happening to you right now that's why you feel so filthy sometimes because the lord is starting the the bar is getting high while the world is drawing that bar lower and lower and lower this bar that we're going to brothers and sisters he's bringing us higher he's bringing us higher he's it's a higher ground tabernacle i love it because he's bringing us higher than we've ever been he's bringing us farther than we've ever gone and and you don't feel like it brothers and sisters you don't but there's a reason why you despise yourselves it's because you're starting to realize that this flesh is complete abomination to god his flesh is useless without him a man without the holy ghost is a brute beast it's a truth it's only the grace of god you know what the you know what the amazing thing about the holy ghost is though is that the holy ghost and the grace of god in the blood of jesus christ can so cover you until even this filthy nasty disgusting wicked flesh is so out of the sight of god that he can manifest his life in you talk about america talk about running through a troop talk about leaping over a wall that is a miracle when you have a desire to live for god and god's god the very life of christ is being expressed in your life when the divine love expresses itself when you can't help but feel a pull to pray for one another when you can't help but feel compassion on the lost souls that are out there because you you can't help with the life of the the flesh would have none of that you see what the world is going to now and how wicked and and abominable it is and the miracle that you sit here right now to listen to to uh not me but to listen to this vessel i'm nothing i'm weird to look at i got a fuzzy face i shout i scream i spit sometimes but it's not about the flesh and to think that god in this hour while satan's making his eating the lord is preparing a very eden in your heart that holy ghost brooding over you bringing you into perfection on the inner man to where we could be so dead so underneath the authority and the headship of our husband to where they become one again see in the garden of eden we saw the split but both of of the natural when god separated man male and female and then in the spiritual when man separated himself from god but in this hour is he uniting amen all the the things that had been come between christ and his bride have been cast aside if we can receive it if we could come under full headship of this word and and that's christ because christ is the word i'm not talking about just a carnal reading of the word those things are great we want to do exactly what's written in here but i'm talking about your everyday life when he calls you to prayer you pray when he calls you to sin you sing when he calls you to fast you fast people don't even think about fasting anymore people just cast it out when people don't even think about those things but god is calling us to a higher place he's calling us to a place of perfection on the inner man completely separate from yourself you can rest are you looking to yourself to your sacrifice let's all stand i won't hold you any longer i know it's already late i know it's i feel you know the lord you know it's one of those things i you know with the you know we get so busy and we don't always get a chance to come and visit as we ought to and lord willing you know if the lord allows we'd certainly love to be able to visit you more and all those things but i think you know sometimes your heart's just full and you want to spill so many things out and i feel like i've preached about 10 messages in one so i apologize if it feels jumbled up but if i could say just the the the crux of all of it is the the grace of god is sufficient when paul sought the lord for that thorn in his flesh he said my grace is sufficient for thee he said my strength is made perfect [Music] this flesh is in a lot of ways getting weak in all ways really it's getting weaker and weaker we even heard it even in the natural things our food is hybrid the air we breathe is hybrid everything we intake even your water is hybrid now you don't know where your water is coming from you get a you know we know tap water is who knows what's in the tap water so you say oh i'll get bottled who knows where the bottled water is coming from and they say well they put a label on it they have to tell us what's in there come on like everybody actually tells you what's in their stuff i mean let's just be honest man the love of money is the root of all evil and there that almighty dollar is calling to them they're going to tell you it's reverse osmosis blessed by the the mountain filters of of the granite and filtered through 500 layers of soil and it's got the himalayan salts and it's got a perfectly ph balanced and or it's or it's gonna do this over here it's i know they got the smart water now it's gonna the smart one the only reason i say there's nothing wrong with those things you drink all the smart what do you want to or whatever you want you there's nothing wrong with those things but the point is the flesh is dying it's hybrid it doesn't matter what you do it doesn't matter the scripture says they'll get weaker but wiser so your flesh is getting weaker all the time every day it's getting weak but his strength is made perfect because when you can come to a perfect realization of your weakness then you can come to a perfect realization of how he is strong when i'm weak i want to live in the the grace of god lord give me your grace lord jesus give me your grace i don't want your law i don't want to make this message of law i don't want to make this word a law i don't want to make anything that we've heard any of those things i want to do everything that he's told me to do don't get me wrong we don't turn grace into disgrace all those things but there there is a path right down the middle that we have been called to take and i'm looking to the grace of god to see me through because i know i can't do it but i know he promised me that he that begun a good work in me is faithful to complete it this is power has some prayer heavenly father lord lord jesus lord certainly in the natural feel like a jumbled up sermon lord but lord i feel as though i've just delivered the burden that was on my heart for the people [Music] lord i know [Music] that in my life in the life of everyone here father that it's only by your grace that we stand it's only by the blood of the lord jesus christ by the power of the holy ghost lord that gives us grace that we're standing here this evening lord i know i can't do anything lord no doubt i've tried many many times to do different things and see the shipwrecks that it brings oh god when you try to put your hand to it you end up messing everything up father but if we could just get ourselves [Music] lord let you do the leading come under your authority your headship father your head the headship of this bird the holy ghost or that you could we know that you could speak to us every single day lord that

your sons and your daughters grace to come lord in a cold rainy night in a november in iowa when it's 40 degrees and rainy and cold know that but they would press themselves out to the house of god lord to hear your word lord i know that you reward them father i know that lord god you're drawing us closer to you father that we've heard your word lord that we're receiving it with willing hearts of god lord may you just manifest yourself through us lord to to the world oh god lord may we just look to the simplicity of the gospel in our lives lord help us to be just simple child-like faith believers of god lord that you would give us revelation oh god but let us just be humble and simple lord i just want to be humble lord i just want to be simple i just want to be meek and lowly before you lord jesus lord because you said he that exalts himself would be a base lord but if you've humbled himself you'll be exalted in due time lord and i'm not even looking necessarily to be exalted oh god and i don't believe your people are either but oh god it would be just enough oh god just on that day to see your face oh god to be one with you once again oh god to be in your presence lord of the weddings [Music] lord i just pray right now that you bless your people lord may your angels just in camp about that may just put a hedge of protection about the lord as we each go our separate ways lord to fight the battles that we have to fight lord wherever we may go god but knowing that you also gave us a promise that we would possess the gates of our enemies lord we're standing upon your promise lord we're trusting in you we're trusting oh god in your word lord and i just think about how europe even your apostle paul lord even said lord that the life that he lived he didn't even live by his own faith but he lived by the faith of the son of god lord we're not even relying on my own faith oh god i'm relying on you lord we just commit all this into your hands lord may you just bless your people bless the pastor lord brother brooks the precious friend and all the different ones that are here oh god we just pray that you'd bless them in a special way oh god we just commit them now into your hands lord in the name of the lord [Music] if you desire prayer we'll pray with you you know the lord said that if you lay hands on the sick they shall recover said the prayer of faith shall save the sick and god shall raise him up and i love it because the lord seems that he he loves to give even compound promises he said he said and even if they forgive if they've committed sin they'll be forgiven oh i thank the lord for his promises if god [Music] is [Music] i yes [Music] you always [Music] whenever i am [Music] i will trust [Music] oh [Music] yes [Music] [Applause]
