[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] fantasy our brothers made it back safely and we appreciate the Lord Jesus taking them over the dangerous streets and highways Amen a lot of people travel but they leave home and not return so even so it's always a blessing when God can bring you back a man we're just going to try to finish up on the message a candle in the night and we're dealing with vast I vasty however you want to pronounce it we realized by God grace how tests and trials come to us all that God expects us to make the right choices one of the things that I know about God he he places in his word that we should love him above all things even ourselves the bride of Jesus Christ will always put Christ first we want you to turn with us by God's grace - let's just go to one scripture here Colossians 3 Colossians 3 2 and 4 and we'll read the scripture there we'll go back to s10 abut in a bit there's a lot of things that could be said as I said when I started with the book of Esther there's so many things that could be said it's a book it's just full of things the types and shadows but right now I'm just dealing with those little simple things we're making the right choices the right choice could mean a matter of life or death sometimes you don't know when that last choice is being made that's why we should always go by the leading of the Lord and when we know God is talking to us we need to be obedient Colossians 3 2 2 4 set your affection on things above not on things of the earth for you are dead in your life is hid with Christ in God when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory let us pray father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves there are no words to express our gratitude tonight forgive us Lord of being a little tired but I know you are our strength and we just believe you will touch this body Lord and how Souls encouraged we thank your father for the power that lies within us and we realize how God is it's your Holy Spirit that keeps us alive grant us victory tonight we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I was just listening to the prophet of God and he was telling us about this lady who knew at that time she was supposed to give her heart to the Lord and she failed to do so and on her way home she got an accident but before she the car the approaching car hit her she sent to her daughter I did wrong tonight and I know I did and then the car came and she was killed in the accident I don't say these things to scare anyone or to bring in a fight but I do know by God's grace we for certain don't know the last moments of time that's why I read that scripture set your affection on things above we understand what it means to be born sinners now we need to know what it means to be born Saints because when we were sinners we did whatever came to our mind to do we did it and like I said most of us we enjoyed doing sin because that was our nature like a pig that enjoyed mud that's the way we were but God rich in mercy saw us and he knew that it was something about us that was different from the others one thing I know about the Lord the Bible declare he knows them that I hear I'm so glad about it because God knew I was hears before I knew he was ours ears and because of his grace he has brought us thus far when I think about what went on there in King Ahasuerus day I don't think a lot of us realized the the thing that was going on because it was somewhat today like we have now it's because you know if you look in the scriptures you don't see God hardly mention at all the setting is about a king and a queen a king who was looking for a bride or someone who could really glorify him you see the beauty of Adam was Eve she was the beauty she was a glory of a husband but she spoiled that and of course because she did that this is why we are who we are but God in these stories and these are more than stories they were historical events that were taking place and these people didn't even know that they were writing Scripture just by their lives and we find out that think about vesti who or was a queen I mean come on it's like you're in the right place at the right time and sometimes we get to the place we forget we think Laura ourselves than we ought to and whenever you come to a place like that you know that somewhere a fall is coming because that's the way it was with Vashti she thought more of herself so you can never think that your will would supersede God's will God's will will be done and often time when he can't get you to do his will then there are consequences that follows think about it when Saul was told to kill all the animals and the king and everything else and he reasoned with in his mind that God needed something from him God don't need nothing from you other than obedience but saw him and thought that he would give God the best how can you give God the best when God has all that he needs God is not someone that is need in needful God is whole even as he is and we find out that that's what happened we find out that that's what happened to many of us sometimes God blesses us put us in a good place and we forget where we came from I don't know where vasty came from but evidently she was in a better place in the King's Chamber in the king's palace than she was before she got there but somehow she forgot and see that is the thing you can never think that you can't be rejected so what do you mean Paul says I must be careful lest I myself will become a castaway so we get to a place when you think that you've got it all down packed that is the time that you ought to be way because the Bible says take key when you stand right you got to be careful that your your stand is a stand of humility and a stand of humbleness because whenever we allow pride to get into the equation we're up for a fall and this is actually what fasted thought let me tell you something that spirit is a strong spirit it is among a lot of churches not only this denominations but among thee the message believers too because like I said the last time we spoke sometimes we get the spirit of you know the Pharisees like we're better than everybody else and you see that's when you are setting yourself up for fall hallelujah understand the prophet of God when he was here on earth he ministered and his brothers and sisters were of every brand he never separated himself and he loved people for who they were not what he wanted them to be whenever he found somebody that loved God he was attracted to that person regardless to who they were I listen to tapes all the time and I get to I get in my mind what went wrong and the problem is that we come to a place we call ourselves bride but listen vest I was queen she was already the wife Israel was not at times the wife and because of her disobedience God divorced her Israel will want to vote the wife of God and God divorced her because of her disobedience God is a holy God and right now we're living at a time where God is calling for holiness let me tell you something there is no way you're gonna get to heaven without fighting you're going to fight you must fight every inch of the way you must fight is that right he told Joshua I have given you the kingdom I've given you the land mother but you must fight you must fight pay every inch fight is yours but I want you to fight for it that's what happened you know we become complacent and when we become complacent you know we're in a danger zone I was telling the Lord and I've been praying for revival here in this little fellowship but I know that a man or woman who whoever they may be you can't have a revival unless you really want one and don't you know you have to fight for it because we're living in Laodicea this is the age we're living in we are being anointed by that spirit every day to be lukewarm to feel like you have need of nothing and we are in a place where we need everything everything and I'm not ashamed to say it but every day I pray for more God every day sometimes in the morning early mornings and things like that God wakes me up I'm praying I'm seeking God I'm crying out to God and saying Lord what what what what because I want to know what can I do what what must I do amen to make this perfection in which I feel the pool I don't know whether you feel the pull I feel a pull something's pulling me more now than ever before keep pushing keep pressing do I fall do I stumble every day somehow someway but I say immediately law forgive me I'm coming just a moment see I'm coming back to vaster because remember I said vast it means to be drunk to drink and she represents the drunken church but not on the Holy Spirit but on drunken on worldly things drunken on the blood of others hallelujah and that's where we are now the churches are drunk people are drunk because they can't discern the time most people when they're drunk they date they don't even know who they are they don't know what they supposed to be they don't know how to walk a straight line they are forever twisting and turning right because they have been in fact affected by something other than the Holy Spirit somebody help me here see what we don't realize is that these things that Satan is fighting with us with their common things they're things that that that that are common to men and they all fit in the three categories that love the lusts of the flesh lust of the eye and the pride of life and these are the things that we you and I must overcome blessed is the overcomer and as I said they men when we talk about overcoming that means you've got to fight yeah God is not gonna pull you through a tube God is not gonna just make it easy for you well sir and guess what he leads you into the battles he brings you into the tests and he expects you to overcome you understand me so when you don't never you never know when that last moment that choice it's going to be your last choice or your last time of failure because I think that vasty had had it so well she rose up within herself and that's what a lot of times he what is that what is the call for the hour come unto me all ye that are laden and heavy laden and I will give you rest take upon you take upon you my yoke right because my yoke is easy my burden is light right so you got to understand it is it's come unto me not me Jesus Christ it's not come to the church come to the preacher no sir let me tell you like this and this is what has happened to a lot of people they have an adopted the thought in their mind that a system is going to save you no system can save you hallelujah it doesn't matter where you belong to the group that believed that Malachi 4:5 is it doesn't matter you see in it you're not called to that you got to go beyond that is that right it was John who called but then when when they came to John John said this is not the stopping point here is Jesus he is the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world follow him you see what I'm saying and I follow our leadership must be by the Holy Spirit hallelujah glory to God you know if fart is hard to find spiritual people anymore people want to talk about everything but Jesus they want to talk about everything other than the word you know what did God do for you today but we find out the people of troubles they love to talk about troubles and things that goes on in the world folks it is time to get God on your mind hallelujah if vasty had had sheep what happened to she lost love for her husband her Queen duties as that's what had happened her Queen ship had became become duties duties do this do this do this enemy so there was no love left when the King called for her so she basic you know denied him not realizing it was going to be a fatal mistake whenever Christianity becomes just duties to you you're backslidden I must go to church because it's my duty I must pay my tithing because it's my duty hmm y'all understand me whenever it comes to that place you are backslidden because it should never be duties hallelujah he said if you love me you keep my Commandments huh and that's what's happening you see the emptiness that's going on with the people of God that's supposed to be brighter you don't want to be why but what has happened is they have lost their love and like I was telling the Lord the other day I said Lord restore me where you are my first love y'all remember when God when you first fell in love with him oh my god nothing could keep you from Church nothing can keep you from prayer nothing couldn't keep you from reading you rejoice I did whether being street or in school it didn't matter because I was so in love with him you know how it is when you first get married and everything else always just love you know what I mean you hear the birds singing and all that and and that's what happened after a while if you don't keep the fire going it becomes duties and every marriage suffers it you go through that period of time and somehow you have to regroup and make it live again come on it's the truth you call that revival hallelujah every marriage has to be revived and what is it most of the time you have to take away your selfishness get away that get all the trash out and bring it back together but it has to be on both parts hallelujah now brother Bellamy talk about how in the marriage supper of the lamb how when things become duties he said it's wrong he says now you're living a lie and that's how it is with Christians when life the Christianity becomes a duty now you live in a lie a lie it must be love that compels you to live for Christ hallelujah it cannot be well if I don't I'm gonna go to hell or if I don't you know what I'm sayin something Bad's gonna thats not the right attitude I'm talking about nasty cause here's when she made that that statement that she wasn't gonna come to the king she list up see that's what happens to us when we fail to come to the king not to brother Brooks not the higher ground Tabernacle you must find Jesus you must come to him you must know him right when we say in turn to the Chamber be free we're not talking about entering my chamber into the into the the table of this place with all my gone into the Holies of Holies don't stop people of God it's rough right now it's hard right now it's a real press but you got to keep going because the test is given to you so that you can show yourself how much you won't heaven it is by grace but God has given us the grace to press on I think about Paul often and I think oh my god Paul Paul you'd never seen him complaining I've been beaten he said I've been you know dead and ship-wrecking you know I've been among false brethren food I don't know which one I'd rather best false brethren of the shipwreck but never less Paul it out hallelujah but Paul said I learned some things I learned how to be content and learn how to be obeys hallelujah I've learned hallelujah to be content in every position God put me in and that is battles wherever God put me I'm gonna be content if I'm in a battle I'm gonna be content and I'm on the mountaintop Valley wherever he places me see now you're growing I'm mature person and you know we're not pouting like kids you know we're growing up now coming to a place where we understand God is in control is eat our head huh think about it now I'm saying something this look look at this thing because service to God is something that must be volunteer you must voluntarily do it nobody should compel you and I think about the woman you know Mary when she got an alabaster bastard box how she ran to Simon's house and she was determined you understand me not liking it as to church she was determined and it Celeste them to be to be learned because when you come to church and you determine to get something from God he's gonna give it to you she was determined she didn't let all the coal and starchy people at Simon's house stop her right she had her heart and mind focused she saw Jesus he saw his dirty feet and she went to work hallelujah and some of us ought to be zealous enough to get here and you see how when it's dead in here put some screams in the air that's true don't go coming or it was dead in church wherever was dead in church and you was there and it was dead that means you was dead too right hallelujah somehow somehow you got to put some action in here I'd know one thing it takes one match to light a fire but anyway she didn't care she went to work and guess what God was waiting on her gotta let you worship him any you would have jumped shout run dance whatever he let you do it and at the end of the day guess we're gonna say what do you want what would you have of me see that's what a lot of time we fail to see those no simple lessons in in there we got bills to pay we got something to carry on you know me and we fail to see that the answer is in worship the answer is in worship the Bible said he indwells he inhabits the praises of his people we know that and we still won't do it God don't want your duty hear about it raise your hand why should I have to say that I remember I was out in and I'm coming out I was out in Arizona and the man the guy who was doing the conducting oh I got so angry he said uh y'all get up in stretch I got in trouble they told us not to say night we supposed to come up there and just saying yeah and being a preacher I couldn't help it I say get up and stretch I said everybody in here a shame with yourself I said there's a time that the church used to be oh so far oh so much Oh fire you'd have to tell them you may be seated now you tell them get up and stretch talk about backslidden come on somebody what kind of stuff is that anyway let me move on I don't know how come God got me here but I won't I want to say this by God's grace vasty gots it got so common Christ became so common and understand people get to a place they are ashamed of him you know whatever God strike you and you move you know what he's getting he called you into this assembly so he could show you off oh yeah is that right King Ahaz Laura called vasty in to show her off because to her she was the greatest prize of all that he had he had gold and silver he had diamonds he had rubies but the greatest of his treasure was his wife and so is it with God in you the greatest of his treasures are you that's why the devil fights you so much you're gonna be thought and sometimes you're gonna lose but he expects you to get up he expects you to get up the just man falls seven times in a day and he gets up the reason why we must stay on fire and who will not on fire we need God to relight the fire why because when you're dead everybody else become dead you understanding the influence of a dead spirit I used to call it like this the influence of a no worship demon yeah people are afraid to worship hallelujah but it's true that's how it starts a little corner starts and that comb is your spreads all over the place just like fire would do so why not bring the fire right set your affection on things above every time I think about that I think about my loved ones that's going on and I think about how important it is for me to meet up with them and how by God's grace I know they're there by faith you understand me I'm not talking about you see people a lot well I don't know whether I got some gold in the in the treasure I'm not talking about that you know the greatest treasure I got up there my relatives who made it that's what I'm looking forward to seeing them you said what do you mean remember brother Bosworth when he got ready to die the story was told that he was laying there almost like in a coma and all of a sudden he came up right he woke up and before he died he started shaking hands with his loved ones the converse that he he had won to the Lord y'all don't y'all believe that I believe that I know it's real hallelujah let me tell you something if you've never seen a demon or if you've seen a demon if a demon exists then God does too right and I've seen like I said you say well what do you mean brother books I'm saying you think about it right what what something but what it is sir to allow your family to know that you're going up just like sister Matthew over there in Ohio before she died the Lord came in and showed himself even the grandkids saw the supernatural weeping and everything when when their mom and grandma left out of the room see that's where I'm talking about I never sister who was there in Arizona and they said y'all go pray y'all preachers let me go into the hospital and pray for her and God told me no don't go cuz she's going home today I don't know what he said today but he told me she was going home gonna back that up but nevertheless I didn't go and they told me that when the preachers got there before the preachers got there all of her children were gathered in the room none of them told the other that they were going to see mom all of them were there she was laying there when the last one came in the room she all of a sudden woke up out of the coma and she began to tell them of her loved ones she was there talking about who all she's seen and all of that stuff and all of a sudden she broke out an amazing grace fell back and went on home see that's what I'm talking about the land is real it's worth the battle it's worth making the choice I live for it but in order to make this journey you're gonna have to pray mm-hmm you gonna have to pray you're gonna have to pray when you first get anointed is that right let me say it like this remember when when when Esther who was uh when Esther was chosen and and and they had to go through a purifying stage a cleansing stage I don't know what it is about Christians they don't they won't be halfway clean no God is calling for a full cleanse it's not this out with thing anybody can look make this look good he's working with the heart the heart must be clean only the pure in heart shall see God brother Branham brings out in the marriage of the Lamb he said that's what else to did that's how she ant outran the other girls she cleansed her heart he said well the way I dress doesn't make any difference yes it does because those girls amen they put on all those worldly attire and they thought they were do you know if he thought the worldly beauty was gonna appeal to God God don't care about that all righteousness not that dumb is it filthy rags to God what about a man who can't afford a nice clothes but it's hard is right hallelujah and that's what it is God wants you to cleanse your heart how by the washing of the walk by the water of the word this Bible will help you get clean is that right so that's what happens she cleansed her heart everything ryukenden and the others are Chamberlain's were telling her to do she did it this is the beauty of it because all those girls all of them were brides potential hallelujah they only became concubines after they had fellowship with the king you see what I'm saying so he's all praise God I had a wonderful experience with the Lord but what about today you can't go off and experience you had five and ten years ago that's nonsense Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever you suppose a heaven experience with God every day some way somehow if it's just him talking to you right remember some of those women may have had a wonderful time with kena has a rule that day but listen some of them were never called back they were just there and guess what there were his concubines and he could get another wife but he she couldn't get another husband somebody help me you understand me she was locked in that position and that's why I'm trying to tell you because everybody says I'm bride I'm bride that don't mean nothing until the King favors you God must favor you and when God favors you guess what he calls on you you don't have to call on him he calls on you and he calls you by name hmm otherwise you could be just a concubine that's why I said peace a bride bride bride let me tell you something many a brides many a brides maybe a bride's now Laodicea used to be a bride she was rejected back Basti because she didn't come when the King called her louia and so will we be if we don't follow through this word like we supposed to we will be rejected these are all no I'm in the bride I followed mankind you know let me tell you something revelation 2:7 that's what exactly Israel did and guess what majority of them were put away you said we're brothers you shouldn't talk like this yes because I'm gonna tell you something no unclean thing is going to enter in play with the devil all you want to but the devil got a trick for you oh yeah God lets her get away with something but not all the time huh he's always calling for repentance but when you get to a place where you can't even repent you in trouble you better cry out for repentance oh yeah I know some people may not understand what I'm trying to say but one thing I know is that the Bible says the bride have made herself ready and when the bride makes herself ready that means you're doing something you got to do something God doesn't do everything for you he'll show you how to do it right is that one time when my mom was teaching me how to wash dishes she helped me but then there was a time she said you watched him and what'd she do afterwards make sure you watched him right I had one son one time I told him to go down go downstairs and and clean the shower out you know what he did he got Lysol and just threw it on the walls ran the shower and he said he it's clean it smelled clean but he never scrubbed anything guess what he had to do it it ain't that just spraying stuff on stuff to make it clean you got a wash you got a scrub you understand me oh come on somebody sometimes the whole egos have to put some real impress some real pressure on you to get help you clean up yourself let me talk about prayer now for a moment because you got to understand that this battle without without prayer you in trouble our warfare is not carnal its spiritual and I'm going to tell you something with all of the demons that's coming along in this world if you're not careful some sexual demon go grab you because this is what the world is all about everything is that right that's how it started that's how it's going to end since I think it's been one of you for a few minutes ago when you were singing for you for you I am praying he said that's a what I want you to do here's it here's where I'm going is it's prayer that I depend on that's the secret i'ma say this again because I want you to understand you can't even really receive a a real revelation in your heart without prayer you can receive a revelation here but the revelation here doesn't work it just stimulates you your man your spirit man the revelation in your heart changes you that's what's happening with a lot of people right they're getting a stimulation but they're not changing this gospel supposed to transform you not conform you transform you change you from glory to glory to glory to glory that's why God told Timothy freely useful lust you think Timothy had problems he was young and you can't tell me what is not what it with you wow I'm so holy holy you young you keep your youth I'm glad I'm up in age now I know what it was like somebody helped me here y'all kid y'all looking at me like I'm stupid I know I've been there you can't play with the devil huh that's what I because listen y'all got show-and-tell we didn't have show-and-tell it was hide-and-seek but now y'all got show-and-tell everywhere you go so I feel sorry for you but you this is your day oh my god listen let me move on see that's the secret of all the mysteries of God that's the key that opens the door to everything of God is prayer tell me that's not where the devil fight you the most it's prayer cuz you get on your knees and you don't feel nothing sometimes and you feel like God in nowhere with you naughty metal at the ceiling of your house but when did God say feel me and I'll be there you know you don't have to feel him he's with you look at this that's God he is a breath he's always with you that's why the Bible said he is near thee naívi even in your mouth and they'll be glad he is because if he wasn't you'd be dead that breath is a it's a sign that God is with you is that right but you must pray listen this is what I say if Jesus had to pray you got to pray Dan you had to pray David had to pray asked I had to pray because God is going to bring priors on you and he said thinking that strange when divers temptations come upon you knowing that the trying of your faith is more precious than what gold because these trials have come to burn the world out of you he will do it if you want it don't say Lord I want to be like you no more because every time you say that you asking God for more it's coming can't nobody do you like Jesus he knows your weak points he knows what to struggles with but his compassion the Bible says fails not his compassion fails not don't ever think God get tired of you he cannot get tired of you if you really seed if you really hear he can't that's what David said his mercy and do it forever all generations his mercy he didn't just say grace he said it's mercy his mercy because Mercy's you know you're wrong you need help when you're wrong this is not a religion and when you find you call you handle it like a religion you're going to find yourself coming short God don't want this to be religion he wants it to be life everyday life everyday life wake up with the mind to serve God throughout the day with the mind to serve God hallelujah and when you feel yourself being pull one the opposite way that's when you say Lord be merciful how mercy on me you know put me right and am I the only one let's go through that every day every day remember the right mental attitude toward any promise of God will bring it to pass the right mental attitude toward any promise of God it doesn't it doesn't take gifts of healing to heal the sick people any person in here has a right to meet Satan anywhere huh oh I think everybody needs to hear what I said or what he said the point is sometimes we look to others to pray for us pray for yourself sometimes when will your faith increase when will you move you you know when will you come to a place of maturity where you can cast the devil out it's what we need we need to grow up listen I'm moving now listen Ephesians 1 17 through 23 you know eternity but it says with the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of this calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints this is what I love about Esther Esther just want it can I use the word naked she just wanted to be naked in other words she didn't want anything false she wanted God her King to see her for who she was she was not a hypocrite there was nothing false about her this is what I love about God I can be true I can be true I don't have to fake it you know I don't have to say like some of y'all you know you just know some of me you don't know all of me like I don't know all of you we always have that little one part that we hide behind we use as a facade because we feel like if people would see the real you all of you they wouldn't like you so we have this little mass that we work with sometimes and then to pretend but God said put away all of that you don't need that anymore that's what Paul said we don't know no man after the flesh you anymore we don't even know Jesus Christ after the flesh anymore listen we all saved by grace there is no dog there's an ocean that won't be brought to the light hallelujah and the only only thing the only way you can ever get rid of la darkness is put it under the blood be real yeah this is what I like about it she was she wanted to display her to her king the character that she had already she had character and those girls even though she knew that I can go into this chamber that they that you know where all of the jewels and all of the barrettes and braces and bracelets and everything and gowns and you know I can choose they said I can choose whatever I want to choose I can wear it and even if the King doesn't select me I can take this back with me Dum Dums excuse me what would an elaborate dress do you if you in a room all the time you ain't got nowhere to show it off this gonna be your first and last time to come before the king and you go calm a menu the crown is too big and and the bracelet too heavy but you love it y'all that's what people think but you know they don't look at people oh my god I don't even want to go there but how people come to church oh Lord but nevertheless you wonder who they gone to see oh I tell you what sometimes brother I'll be thinking wrong I said Oh Lord just hit her one time with that only goes and she get them high-heeled shoes boom now don't bother me because I it take character not to laugh especially you know told people about wearing high-heeled shoes y'all looking at me like I'm crazy I'm being real the party is yeah because people don't even realize Amen those thing gonna take you straight to hell and they just one little thing huh I had a friend she's going on I don't know whether she's with the Lord or not I don't know but I hope she did her name was well I better not tell her name but she's a big girl with them big old shoes hi you need to stop I should tell her you need to stop wearing no shoes first of all it ain't good for your back right I see it's not healthy those things are not healthy she had to wear was going down this incline and when things like that you when things like that happen you have to get serious all real serious inside you about the break so I had to wait to see whether she was make sure she wasn't hurt I think I lay out all the way to a job you know cuz I kept thinking I told you listen i'ma take this the truth never ever had to worry about her ever wearing high-heeled shoes again and people don't even think high-heeled shoes or send them to hell you know why because it takes a woman and it lifts her heel up it produces a proud look and God hates the prideful look whether it be male like female let me move on I don't know how come I got on that because most of the people that need to hear that ain't even here tonight let me move on you love the Lord the Bible says for grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourself it is a gift of God right who chose Esther it was a king what made him choose her his own desire his own liking of her nobody forced him that was His grace toward her that's how it is with you God didn't chose you he didn't choose me because I'm a preacher or singer the gifts and calling of God is without repentance how people in the world got better gifts right but that doesn't save them because they can sing or play or dance that doesn't save you the only thing that saves you is the grace of God you said well what do you mean the grace I explained it to you the grace of God is like when God opened up your understanding it's going to rain getting the ark and everybody else don't hear it nobody else can see what you see right but the grace of God has given you a revelation that God had getting ready to destroy the world get in the ark that's His grace nothing you did to earn it he chose to do that for you that's the grace of God the grace of God is to tell you this message is right this message will produce a character in you that would get you into the gates of heaven everybody don't see it everybody don't know it but that's the grace of God to us but God has not appointed us to wrath how many I'll believe that how many y'all part of it at us no delegate no devil in here can convince me that I'm going to hell hello none so what are you saying you know Peter oh I just got old Lord if I could just make the rapture if ya when did if come in it you chosen and elected before the foundation of the world you know if this is not your cheesy he chose you yeah listen it's like his like it's like no he you know he chose the animals and God directed him all right and how you said what do you mean brother even the animals that were chosen knew where to go is that right this is that right those animals were coming two by two he didn't have to pray to Harper the Horn God had anointed those animals to find that Ark it was the Spirit of God moving in that day just it is now the world is getting ready to burn why are you here something is warning you something's telling you that the world is about to fall apart get in the safety zone hmm I hope this is okay I'm enjoying it ping listen you said what brother books what are you saying you said well huh for a long time I used to hate listening to the statue of a perfect man you say why would you say like that cuz I did it scared me because I couldn't see myself doing it I didn't know how to do it don't even go to a thinking man's filter flunked the test every time I didn't know how and to God open my eyes he that begun the good work in you its faithful to complete it ain't got nothing to do with it I believe God like abraham believed God and it was counted unto Him as righteousness believe God if you truly believe him in your heart he will bring it to pass no Abraham didn't even know where he was going and yet God was taking him every place he needed to be huh and that's how he is sometimes you don't even know you were being laid when God is leading mm-hmm that's right I don't know if the Lord Kanha Terry you know I look at the devil and I said you know what first of all I'm not afraid of him because of the grace of God you know if I was standing on my own then I would be terrified but when you know that you got Christ on the inside and you can see yourself moving glory glory glory glory things changing in you your mind is more set on God now and that's what my mind is more set on God now than ever before and I know I couldn't have done that I could not you know it was God he's been God it like Lord am I losing my mind and if that's that's happening that's a real good thing yeah give me a few more minutes I told my wife I wasn't gonna preach long I said I'm gonna try my best to do it short give me 7 more minutes I know it's hard because I know you come you're tired and everything so what yeah five more minutes and I'll let you go oh look my thing is we need a revival every one of us and I I know I do I mean I feel like I'm in revival now I really believe that God is reviving me getting all the trash out of my life and most of all I think my greatest battle has always been my will he's given me a great the grace of God to deny me you know throughout today I'm constantly denying my will and I'm gonna tell you something that old boy can be strong sometimes hmm Paul said I tell you what it's like I said to do you know the will to do good and then don't do it he said I struggle with it all the time huh and sometimes I find myself doing things I don't want to do and I do it anyway I know it you call that what iniquity thank God for the blood of Jesus he covers us even we know when he knows we've done wrong and we know we done wrong all right but you expect - you know revival is getting the trash out it's not adding more water anymore people oh we got a revival going on in our church and you know more people are coming that's not a revival revival is taking what you got and getting the trash out you know what I'd love to see I'd love to see this church so consecrated in and so in love with God amen we start drawing people off the street like a magnet I want to see that the the the the very Acts of the Apostles living in us not in somebody else in us both male and female I remember when I first came to this message nobody couldn't we've seen every every gift there was and that this Bible was in act in action in action among the brothers and the sisters we had we had prophecies and everything else that was telling us days ahead what was gonna happen oh yeah it wasn't nothing to see the pillar of fire or see God move in a mighty way and people say it ain't real it's real maybe they haven't seen it but I've seen it I'm a witness I'm just one of the ones who still know it's true hmm Brian eyes open oh it didn't make the paper it don't have to make the paper but you know why you know what messes up those brothers who've been in the in the message so long it comes at Oh y'all do Pentecostal you know what was the difference we believed everything we heard and we acted on it we didn't have no man's influence we acted upon what we heard we believed it and we got results that's it you don't need an interpretation for it it's right there if you just do what's being said to be done it's finished look we're all the interpretations that garden is calling and formal fighting each other and everything else where is the revival and until we come back together that we love one another it ain't gonna beat the Lord ain't coming yet you understand me somewhere you know it may not be a big group of everybody but my point is the bride must be on one Accord that's how the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost and that's how it's gonna fall again when we stop our silliness and our selfishness and get back to being in love with one another I could remember the time didn't even want to go home from church stay up two or three o'clock in the morning tired got to go to work in the morning didn't care we was in love with God now so let me move on so behind this badger skin your skin is where God wants to place the glory of God I says no you're not you are the temples of God now you show a brother why are you saying all the things that going on in his message let me tell you what's going on before I close the world is coming to here I'm laughing but I'm serious and people looking at it and don't see it all of the signs all of the markings of the word is in-your-face nations against nations earthquakes look at all the Seas the oceans everything is downsizing you know you see that that coronavirus is downsizing what's happening I mean you see California burning over time and floods here and floods there and viruses it and Wars and everything else and people right now are so unrest I don't know about you but I just don't have the peace of walking in the streets like I used to even in your neighborhood you don't even know who gonna ride around with the gun say it won't happen yes it happened up in Ankeny my son-in-law was just out in the park when they lived over there in that place and a guy came to him because he was looking at this guy and he see and he said you know you if you was in Chicago you wouldn't be staring at me like that because he said you you'd be killed or something like that I may not have the words verbatim but my son-in-law was just right outside of his door in his Park but somebody from somewhere else threatening his life nowhere is safe other than in Jesus that's it and people weren't you gonna do I'm gonna say this again like I said Sunday evening you only get one chance you don't get a second chance you mess up this time you die without Jesus you you don't knock on your door no more you don't ever get a chance to go to heaven oh you'll be resurrected in the second resurrection even where the Dead will rise but you know where they come when they rise up you know where they're going from Hell into the lake of fire you know second chance is it worth it is it worth it sometimes we we think some things are so valuable I guess that's what best I thought her party was better that's what denominations they have in reviving us all over the place they enjoying themselves so was she drunken dancing like they drunk playing like they drunk hauling and screaming like they drunk and don't even know they've been rejected let me tell you something you don't want to be in that chair hmm make your calling and election sure y'all understand me young people they know make your call and election sure you keep pressing for them said the real Holy Ghost will bring you to the full statue of Christ the real Holy Ghost will bring you to the full statue of Christ I might have put that word real but that's what he be the Holy Ghost will bring you to the statue of Christ and I say real because a lot of people think they got it and they don't and then you came in you can't come to the statue of Christ of you ain't born you ain't been begotten if the seed hadn't been quickened Romans 10:9 come on real people say oh you quoting it yes that's the Bible and you've got to confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that's where you're saved right it just doesn't stop there it goes on you got to grow up you got to mature right and let me turn something about my flowers out there because they look like they withering I don't know much about flowers so I went and asked about how to take care of them you know and when I look you know I'm believing but the lady basically was telling me it's the environment those flowers they like water they don't like that not a whole lot of water but like like a lot of sunshine and they don't like draught and that's why they withering because they writing that doing that draft hits them but so I've got a movement flowers here I'm talking about flowers but it's a spiritual plication because in order for the plants to bloom in a state of reproduction the comet must be just right so is it with the church in order for this church to bloom and bring forth reproduction this atmosphere must be right ain't nobody coming back to a dead church nobody excited why should I come there they don't look like they love Jesus huh hey man and the truth of the matter is I've been Church we had to preach we listened they mean the music we had to go for years without it but back then we had more fire than we got now hello it's the truth we'd go out and fellowship with one another now every man for yourself we didn't have much and a hotel room but things were better in that sense seemed like we had a closer connection but something has happened and I think all of us need agree examine ourselves because until we love each other the way we ought to we're not going nowhere yeah I'm gonna tell you something love you think love is mushy but love is not mushy love can take a lot of stuff love is rough tough right let's stay now I I I'm coming to a place and I'm closing just now I took more than 10 minutes I'm sorry but let me tell you some people it's real don't let the devil play and make you think you got a lot of time because we don't and it's gonna be so simple there'll be so many so small of a amount of people missing so nobody will miss him you know I just heard the prophet of God say the other day he said he said you know he said so many people will be missing from Jeffersonville and they won't even know where they go he didn't even say all I'm you know he just said so many Oh a few what about us because we think we got it all made because we can see that God sent a prophet Israel did too and I just keep saying that because I want people to know that that a system that we developed okay saying 45 minutes you know preach so many long minutes and you know a system that don't save you it just don't save you you are saved by grace but you got to come in contact with God you got to make a union it's got to be intimate it can't be a long distant relationship you understand me you got to talk to him and he's got to talk to you it's got to be that kind of a first place and God ain't gonna take a dirty bride I don't know it always it's grace yes it's great but like I'll tell you again grace gives you the time to make it right and I'm gonna tell you something people of God I want to be wrapped arrest completely sealed with divine love see this what we don't understand the token is divine love it must be on display it can't be here though I got the Holy Ghost but you still got that temper you still got those attitudes you still got those things that you do and this is what I try to tell people I said I'm gonna say and you don't have the Holy Ghost but you're not where you supposed to be to make a rapture cuz he ain't coming for immature bride he's coming for a perfect bride word upon word upon word upon word all of the attributes of Christ must be in us as individuals it's not like I can have faith that you have virtue no I gotta have all seven of those virtues Kapton we define them that's rapture material that's when she becomes him it's not enough to say oh she becomes him yeah not potential reality is what we looking for in that brain that comes back by our union with Christ a real user you love the Lord
