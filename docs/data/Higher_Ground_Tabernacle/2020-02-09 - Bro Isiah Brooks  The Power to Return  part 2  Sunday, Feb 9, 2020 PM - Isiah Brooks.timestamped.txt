[32:58] [Music]
[33:02] [Applause]
[33:02] [Music]
[33:45] [Music]
[33:50] my favorite
[33:53] hallelujah
[33:56] I live to return
[34:05] I was telling
[34:12] further Troi to maybe we need to check
[34:16] and see if we have some kind of mole
[34:19] something coming through because every
[34:22] time I get in the pulpit I have runny
[34:26] nose the other night I walked out and
[34:27] everything stopped so we might need them
[34:30] yeah sir I think so yes sir
[34:37] [Music]
[34:43] having children here we don't need that
[34:45] for sure you love the Lord you know I
[34:51] tell you what I so enjoyed that as we
[34:59] stand let's go right into the Word of
[35:01] God
[35:03] glad to see the Columbus here amen I
[35:10] know the enemy fought you this morning
[35:11] but that's okay brother you was here
[35:15] yeah we all have those moments I know
[35:20] what it's like when you're tired in the
[35:22] air-conditioned everything is just right
[35:25] it is what it is ah but I tell you I I
[35:31] admire people who really press their way
[35:34] out to the house of God in spite of the
[35:37] things that they may have the hurdles
[35:39] the things that they have to go through
[35:41] you know it is this time that I have my
[35:45] most babbling I guess in the evening
[35:48] time because you know you expect people
[35:50] if they really enjoy the word they come
[35:52] back I know that's how it is at a
[35:55] restaurant in the natural sense they
[36:00] come back and I don't know about you but
[36:02] I've been times I've been sleepy but it
[36:04] didn't stop me from eating and so you
[36:09] know we we look at the natural and the
[36:11] spiritual and that's why I say some of
[36:14] the things I say because I know some
[36:16] people have excuses but not all and and
[36:19] my thing is is that prioritize things
[36:23] they must do that put God first
[36:26] everybody I love the Lord and I know
[36:31] it's quite difficult sometimes for
[36:35] everybody because everybody is going
[36:37] through things and everybody have
[36:40] difficulty I was thinking I'm mrs. to
[36:43] Naomi is she okay okay I'll call her
[36:49] amen
[36:50] I figure she must be working or
[36:52] something but God knows amen in
[36:56] it's always good to see her sometimes
[36:58] I'm not here to sew so that's how it
[37:02] works sometimes Amen she misses me and I
[37:05] miss her but by the grace of God we want
[37:08] to ask you to turn with us to Genesis 8
[37:10] and Ecclesiastes 1 Genesis 8 22 we're
[37:22] gonna pick up where we left off by God's
[37:27] grace Genesis 8 22 while the earth
[37:37] remaineth seedtime and harvest and cold
[37:42] and heat and summer and winter and day
[37:45] and night shall not cease now we're
[37:51] dealing with seasons and we're talking
[37:55] about the the circuit that the earth is
[37:58] on and how it moves around the Sun
[38:03] everybody have their scientific idea on
[38:06] how it all works but I'm just gonna go
[38:09] by way I see the Bible talk talking
[38:12] about it one more scripture Ecclesiastes
[38:15] 1 2 through 11 you love the Lord I how
[38:25] can you how can I say it when it comes
[38:31] to trials and temptations and things I
[38:35] know that as a prophet of God say the
[38:38] greatest battle is fought with in your
[38:41] mind and when the Lord brought that
[38:46] through a brother branham we realized
[38:50] that is no joke
[38:58] you know it's you almost rather have a
[39:01] physical battle at least you know where
[39:04] you're at you know where your opponent
[39:05] is but sometimes this mind the battle
[39:10] that we have in our mind it's can be
[39:13] overwhelming and therefore you know we
[39:16] must at all times put on the whole armor
[39:19] of God you got to put on the helmet of
[39:23] faith because without that faith
[39:25] believing all of God's Word Satan has
[39:27] already defeated you and once he
[39:30] conquers they had the body is done with
[39:32] so we realized by God's grace we're in a
[39:37] tremendous battle but we must keep focus
[39:40] understanding we're on a journey and
[39:43] that's the way it was with Abraham he
[39:45] was on a journey let me go ahead on with
[39:47] the scripture so we can have you sit
[39:48] down Ecclesiastes 1 beginning at the
[39:52] second verse vanity of vanities saith
[39:57] the preacher vanity of vanities all is
[40:01] vanity
[40:02] what prophet half a man of all his
[40:05] labour which he taketh Under the Sun one
[40:10] generation passes away and another
[40:13] generation cometh but the earth abideth
[40:16] for ever the Sun also arises and the Sun
[40:22] goeth down and hey thenis to his place
[40:25] where he arose the wind go toward the
[40:30] south turn it about unto the north a
[40:34] whirl it about continually and the wind
[40:37] returned it again according to his
[40:40] circuits
[40:41] remember returning all the rivers run
[40:45] into the sea yet the sea is not full
[40:49] unto the place from whence the river
[40:51] cometh thither they return again all
[40:55] things are full of labor man cannot
[40:59] utter it the eye is not satisfied with
[41:02] seeing nor the ear filled with hearing
[41:05] the things that have been is that which
[41:08] shall be and that which is done is that
[41:12] which shall be done and there is no new
[41:14] thing under the Sun is there anything
[41:17] ware of it may be said see this is new
[41:20] it had been already of Oh which was
[41:24] before us
[41:25] there is no remembers of former days
[41:28] neither shall there be any remembers of
[41:31] things that are to come with those that
[41:34] shall come after let us pray father we
[41:39] come before you we thank you for your
[41:41] grace and your mercy we thank you for
[41:44] being so good to us we thank you Lord
[41:46] for all that you've done for us those
[41:50] beautiful songs that you sang this
[41:52] evening Lord to touch my heart touch my
[41:55] soul songs of Hope songs of faith songs
[42:00] of praise songs of worship Lord we thank
[42:03] your father for ordaining those songs to
[42:06] be sung tonight truly blessed my so
[42:09] bless each and every heart tonight give
[42:12] us words to say and we will speak them
[42:16] for you Lord in Jesus Christ's name we
[42:18] pray amen
[42:19] you may be seated so we see by God's
[42:23] grace that we're going home this is the
[42:26] whole point about what God has done we
[42:32] can see many times about what Jesus did
[42:35] on Calvary and you know as
[42:37] denominational we didn't understand
[42:40] revelation so we thought that all Jesus
[42:42] came to do was just to save us but Jesus
[42:46] came to redeem us now we didn't even
[42:49] understand personally what Redemption
[42:52] draws and that means to bring back or
[42:54] buy back that which was already the
[42:58] owners and so we realized by God's grace
[43:00] that even though we're coming into the
[43:03] knowledge of who we are we had no idea
[43:06] that we had an existence somewhere
[43:09] somehow in the mind of God now we we
[43:13] don't understand how God see things and
[43:17] how God does things in the way that he
[43:20] he does them because God is infinite God
[43:23] is eternal and not
[43:25] evolves with God in God's thoughts
[43:27] they're perfected thoughts they don't
[43:30] did not block builders are building
[43:31] blocks they actually come into mind in a
[43:36] way that God can understand everything
[43:38] at one time understand the body is so
[43:41] intricate that the systems of the of the
[43:44] natural body tool even man and
[43:46] scientists are trying to find out how it
[43:49] all works they're even trying to build
[43:52] androids and things of that nature to
[43:54] see if they themselves can create a man
[43:57] and it is amazing how men tried to
[44:02] disregard God but yet and still they
[44:05] like to be like him they want to be God
[44:08] think about some of the great men of oh
[44:10] how they wanted to be God you say Hitler
[44:13] you said you know Pharaoh you talked
[44:15] about Herod and all these great
[44:18] so-called men who thought they were God
[44:20] and my question is where are they now
[44:23] but the God in which we serve amen has
[44:26] so designed this thing in such a perfect
[44:31] way that nothing is spilled nothing is
[44:34] lost nothing amen is forgotten
[44:37] everything is remembered the only thing
[44:40] that is forgotten is our sins once
[44:43] they're placed underneath the blood of
[44:44] Jesus Christ Solomon was a wise man and
[44:48] he talks about things because how he
[44:50] came to conclude that there is nothing
[44:53] new Under the Sun I don't know it's not
[44:55] like his life was Infinite his life was
[44:58] in time and he was born and he died but
[45:03] in all of his research he came to one
[45:06] conclusion and that conclusion was to
[45:09] fear God and he keep his Commandments
[45:11] because Solomon knew that somehow though
[45:15] we lead this world we had to return and
[45:18] we had to stand before God that was
[45:21] going to judge us so we realized Amen
[45:24] that even after this life is not all
[45:26] over you're going to have to stand
[45:29] before God in a way that either you holy
[45:32] you're righteous or you're filthy you're
[45:35] going to stand before God one way or the
[45:38] other
[45:38] I shall thank God that God did not leave
[45:42] his plan up for chance this salvation of
[45:47] God is not chance it is perfect it is so
[45:52] designed that God knows exactly the
[45:55] moment that you're going to be saved he
[45:58] knows exactly the moment that you're
[46:00] going to come excuse me into the
[46:02] knowledge of your salvation understand
[46:06] by God's grace when we talk about redeem
[46:08] we talk about redemption we talk about
[46:11] belonging to God we have been God's
[46:14] property before we got here so let's
[46:18] let's go on by God's grace I said all of
[46:21] those things so that you can understand
[46:23] that everything is controlled by God not
[46:28] Satan everything is controlled by God
[46:32] Satan has no control even when God Satan
[46:38] does anything he must first get the
[46:42] permission from God you understand me
[46:49] even though Satan no doubt has thought
[46:52] in his mind that he was outsmarted God
[46:55] but we find out that God was using him
[46:58] for his own purpose let me let me move
[47:03] on so that's why the scripture says it's
[47:06] not by power it's not by might but by my
[47:10] spirit saith the LORD right and Paul
[47:13] says power make your calling and
[47:16] election sure see when you make it sure
[47:19] that means that nothing can break it
[47:22] that means nothing can stop it no matter
[47:26] how many times you fall no matter how
[47:28] many times you come short no matter how
[47:30] many mind battles you have you are sure
[47:33] of your salvation it is like a
[47:37] revelation that can't be moved
[47:39] it cannot be moved or it cannot be
[47:42] altered it is steadfast it is an anchor
[47:46] night like the bouncer we have an anchor
[47:48] of the soul
[47:50] so you got to understand when you sure
[47:52] remember I talked about Walt Disney this
[47:55] morning and I said huh Walt Disney had
[47:58] that sure thing I'm gifted if you don't
[48:01] even believe I'm gifted guilty gifted
[48:03] you understand me I have something in me
[48:06] that keeps declaring to me that I can do
[48:08] this you understand me and in a book I
[48:11] said no matter how many times he failed
[48:14] he kept moving until the inspiration
[48:18] struck the very time that God had
[48:20] ordained see that was for Walt Disney
[48:23] nobody could have done the Mickey Mouse
[48:25] but Walt Disney and from that point on
[48:28] he became a billionaire even to his
[48:31] death is that all right
[48:34] see you got to be sure of it no matter
[48:37] what your heart says Amen you understand
[48:45] me because I was in organization
[48:46] denomination they tried to claim me you
[48:51] need to come back to the place you were
[48:53] saved but I knew a word that I was not
[48:58] saved by an organization I wasn't saved
[49:02] in the organization the only way only
[49:05] place I could be saved that would be in
[49:07] Christ y'all hear me so it's nothing in
[49:12] me to return back to that organization
[49:15] like there is nothing in Moses to return
[49:19] back and then to Egypt once he left
[49:22] Egypt the understanding he knew he was
[49:26] on a mission he knew he was on a journey
[49:29] and he was being lured by the pillar of
[49:33] fire and every one of us are on a
[49:36] journey remember I said this morning
[49:38] though we be cut differently we're all
[49:41] stones cut from the same rock and we
[49:45] have different cuts so therefore we
[49:47] can't compare ourselves one with another
[49:50] we are precious in the sight of God is
[49:55] that right
[49:55] even according to Moloch I'll fall he
[49:58] said I will make up my jewels without
[50:02] just any kind of stone
[50:04] we're jewels in that day I will make up
[50:08] my jewels now I'm saying all these
[50:11] things is because the jewels of God has
[50:16] never been lost hallelujah
[50:20] he has always kept his jewels in a safe
[50:24] place call it the Lamb's Book of Life if
[50:27] you want to but he's always knew where
[50:30] his jewels were and he had an appointed
[50:34] time to gather them is that right so you
[50:39] can understand the Bible says that
[50:42] Israel would be scattered abroad because
[50:47] of their transgression but God says I'm
[50:50] going to have mercy on them is that
[50:53] right
[50:54] even david says lord if your people if
[50:58] they should humble themselves if they'd
[51:00] to turn toward the temple if they should
[51:02] pray he said Father forgive them see
[51:05] that's the where and when when God began
[51:09] to put pressure on Israel through Hitler
[51:13] Mussolini and Stalin amen they didn't
[51:17] know that prophecy was being fulfilled
[51:19] they didn't know that God was getting
[51:23] ready to take them back to Jerusalem but
[51:27] they had to return because God said they
[51:32] must be there when the Messiah comes yes
[51:35] you time saying see God put that
[51:37] hardship and Bela Benton called it the
[51:41] tender hand of Jehovah now if that's the
[51:45] tender hand you do not want to get him
[51:50] upset
[51:51] yeah the tender hand of Jehovah drove
[51:55] them back and you remember in that time
[52:00] in 1946 I believe it was 48 and then
[52:04] during that period of time they asked
[52:06] the Jews
[52:07] why did you come did you come back to
[52:09] Jerusalem's and die and they said no we
[52:12] come to see the Messiah now think about
[52:17] it
[52:17] of people who was almost driven to
[52:22] extinction but yet there is something in
[52:26] their heart that made them know no
[52:31] matter what we've got to suffer Messiah
[52:35] has promised and we're going back home
[52:39] to see the Messiah remember I was told
[52:43] in this morning about Jacob and when
[52:46] Jacob Rossler and Penuel you know 10 UL
[52:50] means the face of God it means amen that
[52:54] that here was a man coming into a place
[52:57] where he would not only see the face of
[52:59] God but the vision of God now it sounds
[53:02] like this is what happened in our day
[53:05] because when the several angels came and
[53:08] made that mysterious cloud it was the
[53:11] face of God not only did that face of
[53:14] God all those seven angels come down but
[53:16] it gave us a vision
[53:18] it made us see where we will hear it see
[53:23] everybody's thinking that the rapture is
[53:25] coming is that right even in Elijah's
[53:28] day you had the false prophets or the
[53:31] school of prophets who knew that that
[53:34] day was coming to rapture even though
[53:37] that they weren't part of it
[53:39] they knew that religion was going to be
[53:41] caught up hallelujah and so is it in
[53:45] this day we know that there's coming a
[53:48] rapture hallelujah so it was the face of
[53:54] God or that sees God you see everybody
[53:59] don't see God and they look at that
[54:01] picture like something's wrong with it
[54:03] there's nothing wrong with the picture
[54:05] even though you don't acknowledge it as
[54:07] the face of God it is anyway hallelujah
[54:11] even the prophet of God said that's my
[54:13] lord now he would know that because he
[54:15] was caught up now a lot of people want
[54:17] to argue about it but that's alright
[54:19] because it was at this place
[54:22] when Jacobs name was changed hallelujah
[54:27] and it was at this place
[54:29] your name has changed you're no longer
[54:32] call the church you called the bye
[54:36] hallelujah you love the Lord now in the
[54:40] message Amen returned in Jubilee
[54:43] Amen he says I think of a person ever is
[54:45] sure in their heart and has something
[54:48] that faith can ankle on they should
[54:51] never cease no matter how many times
[54:55] they're defeated they should continue on
[54:58] you understand me it doesn't matter how
[55:02] many times you're defeated get up the
[55:06] Bible says the just man falls seven
[55:08] times in a day and he gets up see
[55:12] there's a scripture that I love it I
[55:14] love the scripture as a 6111 says for as
[55:19] the earth bring forth her bud and as the
[55:21] garden causes things that are sown in it
[55:24] to spring forth so the Lord would cause
[55:27] righteousness and praise to spring forth
[55:30] before all the nations hallelujah so
[55:35] what are you saying think about life in
[55:38] a flower God causes it the lily
[55:44] he doesn't have to spin or toil God
[55:47] brings it God gives him the life God
[55:51] gives him the strength God causes it to
[55:54] happen who educates the chickadee the
[55:57] little chicken in the shell who educates
[56:01] him who tells him you've got to pick
[56:03] your way out God causes it hallelujah
[56:07] and guess what God makes the shell thin
[56:10] enough so that he can crack it
[56:12] hallelujah but don't you crack it he'll
[56:16] die hallelujah and see that's how it is
[56:19] you and I must understand that in order
[56:21] to bring forth the birth that God is
[56:24] calling this fall we've got an answer
[56:26] with an angel we've got the whole Lord
[56:29] the God until he blesses us all help us
[56:34] Jesus see God is causing his thing what
[56:37] makes you yearn for God what makes you
[56:40] not quit why you won't just quit oh I'm
[56:42] tired
[56:42] I'm gonna quit and every time you come
[56:45] to that God says where you going where
[56:47] are you going
[56:48] what you gonna do is there anything out
[56:50] there for you nothing sorry
[56:54] your own but God said I never leave you
[56:58] nor will I forsake you and somewhere
[57:02] somehow you get like Samson in your
[57:05] bedroom and says I'm tired of the
[57:07] Philistines hallelujah Lord let me die
[57:11] in battle you understand me
[57:15] so that's the way it goes you know
[57:19] because we talk about the power of
[57:20] return you can't do it brother Bell
[57:23] tells us he said everything to make a
[57:27] rapture is in the seed it in you except
[57:32] the seed be in you it's not by your
[57:35] power it's the seed power it's the power
[57:38] of the seed it's the power of the juror
[57:41] all we need to do is get in the presence
[57:43] of God and let the German be quicker
[57:46] hallelujah I marvel at nature once
[57:50] seeded song but you get an ear or two
[57:52] years or three ears of corn and all of
[57:55] those chords was in that one seed
[57:57] hallelujah and though they're beyond the
[57:59] same chuckle on the same car not every
[58:02] corn is the same size not even every
[58:05] corn is the same shade of yellow or
[58:07] whatever color it is they diverse but
[58:12] they're saying can I say it like this
[58:13] but they're from the same blood save the
[58:17] life of the favorite corn that went in
[58:19] the ground real cause is it the blue
[58:21] real causes it to come up scientists
[58:26] still don't know how it works they can
[58:29] make everything look so so so natural
[58:32] but they can never discover life why
[58:36] because God is life you understand me so
[58:39] I'm coming to the place to say that if
[58:41] Christ is in you cast your down your
[58:44] burdens cash your worries away
[58:47] it is he christ in you that is falling
[58:52] you that is making you that is
[58:54] developing you into the person that you
[58:56] are
[58:56] now you said brother what do you say I'm
[58:59] saying we're coming around again that
[59:02] same ride that the prophet of God saw
[59:05] the first that that's saying Elvis's
[59:08] bride that lost before him he saw
[59:12] everything in preview
[59:14] he saw even Miss America and you know we
[59:18] are in that day time right now right
[59:23] oh she's rockin and she's rolling and
[59:26] she's doing all kinds of filthy business
[59:28] to to what rock and roll and to in the
[59:33] name of Christ but it was at that time
[59:37] God was bringing another bride around
[59:41] somebody help me here it was at that
[59:44] time that God was shaping up a virgin
[59:48] bride unto Him y'all better hear me
[59:51] listen what he says then and all at once
[59:54] I heard it coming again and coming up
[59:57] this side come the same bride that went
[1:00:00] around this away here cutting them
[1:00:02] little ladies again each one of them was
[1:00:05] dressed in the National Guard from where
[1:00:09] they come from like Switzerland and
[1:00:11] Germany hallelujah and so forth each one
[1:00:15] wearing that kind of God all along here
[1:00:18] just exactly like that one at the first
[1:00:20] and here they are here they was coming
[1:00:24] walking onward Christian soldiers
[1:00:26] marching as to war and when they all
[1:00:29] passed by the interview stand where are
[1:00:32] we standing so that you understand the
[1:00:37] question was there are some people who
[1:00:40] don't have long hair that's only in this
[1:00:43] world I don't know how it's going to
[1:00:48] look but it all will be long it will be
[1:00:54] everything that Satan put on us thorns
[1:00:57] thistles whatever you want to call it
[1:00:59] everything that's bad that this world
[1:01:02] calls to come upon us because of the
[1:01:05] fall will be taken away
[1:01:08] it will be God don't make no mistakes so
[1:01:20] we go on and I'm not saying that
[1:01:23] somebody said that I'm just saying you
[1:01:25] and I must understand that that that
[1:01:27] that returns he what was it they were
[1:01:29] marching wrong with Christian soldiers
[1:01:31] marching as to war and when they are
[1:01:33] passed by the preview and stand where we
[1:01:36] were standing
[1:01:37] you said what brother works I'm gonna
[1:01:38] tell you something I'll never forget
[1:01:40] when Joseph Hamrick was preaching here
[1:01:43] and here he was preaching about
[1:01:45] revelation in the second that war would
[1:01:46] last why we should fight and Jesus
[1:01:49] coming in on his horse hallelujah I'm
[1:01:52] right there all of a sudden I fell into
[1:01:55] a vision I saw myself and it seemed like
[1:01:58] the camera just zoom right in on me and
[1:02:02] I can tell you like this my hair was a
[1:02:05] little different than what it is now I'm
[1:02:10] not saying it wasn't curly but it was
[1:02:14] because I have no problem curly I love
[1:02:17] you're not I'm saying I have no problem
[1:02:19] with where God has made me but I know
[1:02:21] one thing it was blowing in the wind
[1:02:25] that's what I remember
[1:02:27] yeah I'm serious it was on my shoulder
[1:02:31] which my hair in the natural could do
[1:02:33] that when a user have some but
[1:02:36] nevertheless you know I saw me and I'm
[1:02:40] telling you something folks let me tell
[1:02:42] you something the colors the color of
[1:02:44] skin color is so different than what we
[1:02:47] will perceive it because I'm gonna tell
[1:02:49] you something all of nature has
[1:02:52] perverted everybody what what we call
[1:02:55] light is not right there what we call
[1:02:59] black and brown the color is so
[1:03:01] different
[1:03:02] it's a perfection of right a perfection
[1:03:06] of black a perfection of brown whatever
[1:03:09] color you are all sin has taken away I'm
[1:03:15] telling you there ain't no braces in
[1:03:17] heaven teeth were perfect I know what I
[1:03:20] saw y'all
[1:03:22] I know some people don't want to believe
[1:03:24] me but I'm telling you I saw and and all
[1:03:28] I can tell you is that I saw I saw
[1:03:32] colors that really kind of hard to
[1:03:35] describe but one thing I know for
[1:03:37] certain when sin is taken out from us
[1:03:39] will with such a beautiful people amen
[1:03:43] and I'm telling you everything is in its
[1:03:46] perfect order
[1:03:50] we're coming again you don't believe me
[1:03:53] but the Bible said that even when Jesus
[1:03:56] rose from the dead they couldn't
[1:03:57] recognize him why he was in his
[1:04:01] glorified body come on somebody
[1:04:07] so you said well what are you saying see
[1:04:08] I got to make it I'm part of that you
[1:04:13] said I'm saying there is no listen there
[1:04:16] is no and I can tell you something I see
[1:04:19] the color white and there's no way to
[1:04:21] describe it because it was such a pure
[1:04:25] white my sisters I saw my sisters amen
[1:04:31] imitating the color the color was soul I
[1:04:34] can't explain it but everything there
[1:04:38] was no blemishes there maybe on God
[1:04:42] would judge me for what I'm saying
[1:04:44] tonight and do you think how rich my
[1:04:47] soul salvation to tell you a lie I'm
[1:04:52] telling you what I saw none of y'all
[1:04:56] worth that I'm not here to impress
[1:05:00] nobody ain't nobody here worth me losing
[1:05:02] my soul you understand me
[1:05:04] so what I'm trying to tell you is that
[1:05:07] what we go through here is nothing
[1:05:10] nothing can compare to the glory that
[1:05:13] shall be revealed in us nothing
[1:05:19] hallelujah
[1:05:21] you love the Lord oh it's the truth they
[1:05:28] passed by and gestured they started
[1:05:29] going right up into the sky this other
[1:05:32] one went up to a brink at the heel and
[1:05:34] whit down
[1:05:35] like that these started marching right
[1:05:37] up in the sky and when they went to
[1:05:40] marching I noticed a couple little girls
[1:05:42] in the back looking like they might be
[1:05:44] or some kind of foreign girl like Sweden
[1:05:48] and Switzerland or somewhere and they
[1:05:50] started to look around and don't don't
[1:05:53] get don't get out of that step see and
[1:05:56] you got to say well what do you mean
[1:05:57] brother see that's what's happening
[1:05:59] we're right in this message and people
[1:06:02] are getting out of step hallelujah that
[1:06:05] moving away from the Holy Ghost and
[1:06:08] moving away from the very thing that had
[1:06:10] caused them to go up this is not a
[1:06:13] religion this is not a cult
[1:06:16] this is not some man-made thing this is
[1:06:19] God from heaven farming and shaping
[1:06:22] individuals into his very image his
[1:06:26] image hallelujah that's why I say you
[1:06:31] know when you predestinated something in
[1:06:34] you tells you when you right and wrong
[1:06:36] you don't even need education to know
[1:06:38] when you ride alone give you God gives
[1:06:41] you the Holy Ghost immediately you know
[1:06:43] what's right and wrong right from wrong
[1:06:47] excuse me is that right that's exactly
[1:06:49] right the prophet of God tells us when
[1:06:51] he was in Africa and he began to preach
[1:06:53] and those natives who was naked nobody
[1:06:55] told him they were naked but the Holy
[1:06:58] Ghost came and they went running out
[1:06:59] covering themselves hallelujah when you
[1:07:03] got the Holy Ghost you don't have to
[1:07:05] preach on clothing don't wear this don't
[1:07:07] do this don't with no he's got the real
[1:07:10] thing he will teach you how to dress
[1:07:14] he'll make you feel uncomfortable
[1:07:17] nobody has to tell you that hallelujah
[1:07:21] is this okay I want you to know we're
[1:07:24] going around we're coming right we're
[1:07:26] coming we're the last age we're the last
[1:07:29] one and we're moving around the circle
[1:07:31] now we're moving around the corner right
[1:07:34] we're not in a straight line and we're
[1:07:36] moving around the corner and our next
[1:07:38] move is up hallelujah
[1:07:41] everybody else has been previewed
[1:07:43] everybody else is gone before the charge
[1:07:45] how do
[1:07:45] and God is already condemned them
[1:07:49] literacy is condemned
[1:07:52] hallelujah she's received the mark of
[1:07:54] the beast but it was at that time the
[1:07:57] prophet of God thought oh my god is this
[1:07:59] all my ministry has test has brought
[1:08:01] forth is this it I think he said inherit
[1:08:05] in a distance a little marching coming
[1:08:07] on onward Christian soldiers marching as
[1:08:11] to war remember I shared everything has
[1:08:15] to come everything has to return and you
[1:08:18] see this whole thing after the fall we
[1:08:21] went to the dust because God said since
[1:08:24] you did this you must return to the dust
[1:08:26] but because of Jesus Christ God has come
[1:08:32] in and bound the breech you understand
[1:08:35] me
[1:08:35] before the breach everything was holy
[1:08:37] everything was righteous everything was
[1:08:40] pure but because of the fall amen
[1:08:43] because of the fall amen there was a
[1:08:46] breach there was a gap where man and God
[1:08:48] could no longer commune but because of
[1:08:50] Calvary hallelujah because of Jesus
[1:08:53] Christ because of God's grace given to
[1:08:57] us now the bridge had been been the
[1:09:01] breach have been bridged hallelujah now
[1:09:03] we can cross over now we can finish the
[1:09:06] course of going home hallelujah is that
[1:09:08] right it was kind of like Jacob when he
[1:09:11] was in that position when he saw he
[1:09:13] didn't know how the breach was going to
[1:09:14] be be brought together but he didn't see
[1:09:18] that God was working on both ends
[1:09:20] hallelujah God has softer he thought if
[1:09:22] I give Jake if I give he saw all of this
[1:09:24] and given that maybe his heart would be
[1:09:26] softened but what he did not realize was
[1:09:29] God that had God had already softened he
[1:09:31] saw his heart and he saw was ready to
[1:09:33] receive it now I showed you by God's
[1:09:39] grace it's got a return everything
[1:09:40] everything you look in the Bible return
[1:09:43] return return every time Israel fell he
[1:09:45] says return return return amen you see
[1:09:48] people who even now they want to return
[1:09:51] to the old paths right and then they
[1:09:53] have the old cowboy days let's go back
[1:09:55] no no no I'm not talking about that
[1:09:58] I'm talking about this hallelujah God
[1:10:03] don't go back as he goes forward
[1:10:05] hallelujah and we'll Road our journey
[1:10:07] back to Eden hallelujah he said all
[1:10:11] brother what are you trying to say when
[1:10:13] the seals were open we came to
[1:10:16] understand that God has brought us back
[1:10:18] to either
[1:10:19] you gotta believe that that means that
[1:10:22] if I speak if I am a true son and
[1:10:25] daughter Adam which is Christ amen I can
[1:10:29] speak it and it has to obey me that's
[1:10:32] the realm God wants us to operate in not
[1:10:36] like fallen sons and daughters we're not
[1:10:39] just sinners saved by grace
[1:10:41] that used to be but when we got born
[1:10:44] again we're not born sinners anymore
[1:10:47] we're born Saints the sailor was the old
[1:10:51] man the saint is a newly way back
[1:10:58] hallelujah is that right think about it
[1:11:02] I'm gonna try to hurry up because we got
[1:11:03] communion think about it I'm rushing a
[1:11:07] little bit that's okay but think about
[1:11:09] it when Adam and Eve excuse me we Cain
[1:11:13] and Abel offered unto the Lord in the
[1:11:19] message glorified Jesus he tells us that
[1:11:22] listen he said those both of those boys
[1:11:25] was finding or trying to way look they
[1:11:27] were looking for the the way back what
[1:11:31] did they want to do they wanted to get
[1:11:32] back into the Garden of Eden they knew
[1:11:35] that sin kicked them out and they wanted
[1:11:38] a revelation they needed something
[1:11:39] because you see you think that King was
[1:11:43] just trying to be a smart aleck Oh King
[1:11:46] was trying his best to please God that's
[1:11:53] why he was so upset he put all of his
[1:11:55] strength into pleasing God and he was
[1:11:59] rejected you understand me
[1:12:04] there everything he knew to do he did
[1:12:08] did you see that's not how the house of
[1:12:11] God is built
[1:12:12] the house of God from that moment was
[1:12:16] built upon revelation that's why Jesus
[1:12:19] said Amen the gates of hell shall not
[1:12:22] prevail against this it is built upon
[1:12:25] Revelation and it started with Abel and
[1:12:29] when Abel called the revelation it was
[1:12:32] blood that has been God's method of
[1:12:37] communicating with his people from the
[1:12:39] Garden of Eden has always been
[1:12:43] revelation it will always be revelation
[1:12:46] his cries revealing himself in you and
[1:12:49] through you that's how you know you're
[1:12:51] saved when you know that you've been
[1:12:53] changed hallelujah
[1:12:56] you're not the man you used to be you're
[1:12:58] not the woman you used to be I'm not
[1:12:59] that man I may not be what I want to be
[1:13:02] a ought to be but I'm on my way
[1:13:05] see that's where God is working and you
[1:13:08] got to realize you can't quit you can't
[1:13:10] give up I don't care if he gets
[1:13:12] stagnated you get here you get down into
[1:13:14] yourself everybody goes through these
[1:13:15] little valleys I go through them you
[1:13:18] know sometimes you think and you stand
[1:13:19] the next thing around you look like
[1:13:21] something's going wrong but guess what
[1:13:23] all of these things are ordained by God
[1:13:25] God don't look like an itchy was it old
[1:13:28] and I didn't know that I didn't realize
[1:13:30] they were gonna do this no he knows it
[1:13:33] one thing I love about God he loves on
[1:13:35] you even when you failed it still loves
[1:13:40] on you and I love that about God you
[1:13:43] wanna me God don't care I think about
[1:13:46] that woman at Simon's house how God went
[1:13:48] there the Lord Jesus went there and let
[1:13:49] that lady just wash his feet and
[1:13:51] everything else is doing what kind of
[1:13:53] woman you see but he never saw a
[1:13:55] prostitute he saw a daughter
[1:13:58] see that's how God looks when he finds
[1:14:01] you he doesn't see you as this outward
[1:14:04] share he looked beyond that and he's
[1:14:07] listening to your heart and see that
[1:14:08] representation and he he handles you
[1:14:11] accordingly go come on somebody see and
[1:14:16] you know nobody knew that that Simon had
[1:14:20] a party
[1:14:23] so that Mary could come
[1:14:28] that was Mary's party she he didn't know
[1:14:32] she she couldn't afford one so Simon had
[1:14:34] it and she came in there free honey and
[1:14:39] got the benefits of the party younger me
[1:14:41] so you see a lot of things God would do
[1:14:44] just to make his word come to pass and
[1:14:47] God told Mary since you've done this
[1:14:49] your name will go out and fame
[1:14:52] somebody help me is it right everybody
[1:14:55] preaches about her think about it King
[1:14:58] as a believer he is trying to find grace
[1:15:01] with God and came built an altar and the
[1:15:05] altar is a church a place of worship and
[1:15:08] King built an altar not only that Cain
[1:15:11] brought full and offering and their
[1:15:14] sacrifice and not only that became
[1:15:16] worship God a worship the Lord
[1:15:19] hallelujah
[1:15:20] is that right listen he said you can
[1:15:23] belong to a church you can go to the
[1:15:25] altar and pray pay your tithes and and
[1:15:27] duties appeal duties and tithing to the
[1:15:30] church make spiritual sacrifices kneel
[1:15:33] on your knees confess your faith in God
[1:15:35] and still be lost
[1:15:36] oh my god I really look at Lucifer the
[1:15:42] devil sometime and I say you know what
[1:15:44] you had a right you had a way you could
[1:15:48] have entered in if you wouldn't have
[1:15:50] been so stubborn in Cain God told him if
[1:15:53] you do what your brother Abel did you'll
[1:15:57] be a ruler over him and he was too dumb
[1:16:00] no forgive me he just didn't get it
[1:16:02] he had no revelation of what it was
[1:16:06] you see that's what's wrong with people
[1:16:08] when they're so intellectual they have
[1:16:11] to process it and it is not logical they
[1:16:14] make it makes no sense to them and they
[1:16:16] refuse it and don't even understand that
[1:16:19] they own the inspiration of the devil
[1:16:21] faith is not logic face can faith cannot
[1:16:25] be processed faith is
[1:16:32] but you know I look at this cuz every
[1:16:36] time I hear the court like this you know
[1:16:39] people's like oh can that be me oh it
[1:16:41] can't be you when you hear a quote like
[1:16:43] that you reject it yeah people don't say
[1:16:48] when you hear a quote you can do this
[1:16:50] you can do this you can do this and you
[1:16:52] can do this and still be lost
[1:16:53] that's not talking to you is it I don't
[1:16:56] hear that not for me I hear that for
[1:16:58] others maybe but it when it comes to me
[1:17:01] it doesn't ring the bell it moves on yes
[1:17:07] sir so that makes you know who you are
[1:17:11] but if you can suck that in like oh
[1:17:14] that's me you need a birth or some
[1:17:19] increase of faith he was trying to find
[1:17:26] life again he was trying to get back to
[1:17:28] the Garden of Eden but you gotta realize
[1:17:30] he could not go back there because that
[1:17:35] was not his origin his origin came by
[1:17:39] way of the serpent and not by the Son of
[1:17:42] God only Abel could go back because he
[1:17:47] came from the Son of God who was Adam
[1:17:50] you understand me that's what Judas
[1:17:53] could not go to to Pentecost he could
[1:17:56] not receive Pentecost because that's not
[1:17:59] where he came from
[1:18:01] understand Pentecost was not for the
[1:18:04] servants it was for the sons if you was
[1:18:10] a slave and he was born under the master
[1:18:15] in other words if you were born under
[1:18:18] denominationalism got him me let me put
[1:18:23] it this way so you can understand me if
[1:18:24] you were born a Baptist born a
[1:18:28] Pentecostal born and you were born you
[1:18:32] understand me
[1:18:33] under that seed there's no way you can
[1:18:37] go free that's that's Leviticus there's
[1:18:43] no way you can go free that's
[1:18:45] God didn't give us a denomination of
[1:18:47] seed God gave us a seed of him himself
[1:18:52] so Jubilee was for us because we would
[1:18:56] use spiritual Jews therefore when the
[1:18:59] word the bell rang when we heard the
[1:19:02] trumpet and then we could go free but we
[1:19:05] were going to we were going back home
[1:19:07] back to the place we came from see
[1:19:11] everything has to return back to where
[1:19:13] it come from is that right and let me
[1:19:16] say like there's a verse I confess
[1:19:18] headach to come by spiritual revelation
[1:19:20] it had to who told him where did he get
[1:19:24] it from see is something about the seed
[1:19:27] of God God will always give you the
[1:19:30] revelation you need to make it always
[1:19:35] it ain't a base about how good you are
[1:19:38] right oh how much fader well I got no
[1:19:41] Thomas didn't have much at all and yet
[1:19:45] God revealed himself to Thomas y'all see
[1:19:47] what it's election I'm working with God
[1:19:50] deals with election and the elect
[1:19:54] now let me hurry up before I forget
[1:19:56] because I can't I'm not gonna be able to
[1:19:58] finish all this anyway it's not like I'm
[1:20:00] anyway upon this rock I'll build my
[1:20:03] church and the gates of Hell shall not
[1:20:05] prevail against it what that little
[1:20:10] thing that you sure of no matter what
[1:20:15] you know that's why I put it this way
[1:20:17] that's why when when all these crazy
[1:20:20] doctrines came through in my time it
[1:20:23] never swept me off my feet you know why
[1:20:28] because there was a surety there was
[1:20:31] something that I knew that I did not
[1:20:33] have to be a part of that to be bribed
[1:20:36] or to be saved I can name the doctrines
[1:20:40] but it's not important you know all of
[1:20:43] those doctrines basically have ran
[1:20:44] shipwreck but you've got to come to meet
[1:20:49] Jesus Christ for yourself you got to
[1:20:51] have that sure thing no matter how many
[1:20:54] mistakes I make how short I come I'm
[1:20:56] still the bride of Jesus
[1:20:59] right not the power not by might but by
[1:21:02] my spirit saith the Lord right so you
[1:21:06] gotta understand listen let me tell you
[1:21:08] something there is no doctrine around
[1:21:11] here that is going to influence me and
[1:21:15] tell me that I'm not the Bride of Christ
[1:21:20] you understand me about no doctrine out
[1:21:24] here told me that you know who told me
[1:21:26] Jesus himself hallelujah
[1:21:32] now understand this now so you don't get
[1:21:35] confused because your bride doesn't mean
[1:21:38] you his wife a wife Amen must have
[1:21:46] intimacy right because remember Mary was
[1:21:53] espoused to Joseph
[1:21:55] she was only white potentially she was
[1:22:00] his bride but when you out his wife
[1:22:06] something happens that's why he says the
[1:22:09] bride has made herself ready and then
[1:22:12] you see over in the other chapter of
[1:22:13] Revelation she's become life but if I
[1:22:18] all God I'm right and by but you being
[1:22:20] tested remember the little country girl
[1:22:24] throwing out the water in the backyard
[1:22:27] there was somewhere there watching her
[1:22:31] all the time the Holy Ghost is watching
[1:22:36] you all the time to see whether you
[1:22:39] measure up on whether you're flirting
[1:22:42] with with someone else are you being
[1:22:44] true to him somebody help me it's the
[1:22:49] truth and you and I must understand
[1:22:52] because you've been chosen
[1:22:54] oh I'm the brother cousin everybody I'm
[1:22:56] the bride but being bride is not just
[1:22:58] the finished product there must be a
[1:23:02] union Rebecca will supply but she met
[1:23:05] Harvick and there's a union you got to
[1:23:09] be United United time
[1:23:12] and science this is what we've been
[1:23:18] trying to tell people these virtues the
[1:23:21] fire of God must come and burn all this
[1:23:25] trash out of our lives
[1:23:26] you got a whiff li let him do it because
[1:23:29] God is a gentleman hallelujah he comes
[1:23:32] and he burns all these things and then
[1:23:34] you know what happened he begins to
[1:23:36] build himself in you hallelujah God
[1:23:40] can't sit on his throne if there's filth
[1:23:42] he can't do it like you've heard me
[1:23:47] saying God don't share he's not a deduct
[1:23:50] that the heart is this heart is not a
[1:23:51] duplex so you and I must understand
[1:23:57] listen this is not hard people it really
[1:24:00] isn't because it's not your work it's
[1:24:02] his work you don't have to wrestle with
[1:24:05] it it ain't about you is about him the
[1:24:08] thing is what we need to learn how to do
[1:24:10] is says Lord not my will but thine be
[1:24:12] done every day every moment of the day
[1:24:15] we ought to say Lord not my will but
[1:24:17] thine be done
[1:24:18] and the more you allow yourself to
[1:24:21] surrender to him the more he gets it in
[1:24:23] a place where he would completely fill
[1:24:26] you with himself
[1:24:28] am i speaking something that I don't
[1:24:31] know about he told the prophet of God
[1:24:33] you've got to be more sincere
[1:24:36] don't you know even with the Holy Ghost
[1:24:38] you have the ability to fight huh
[1:24:42] remember brother Branham had the Holy
[1:24:45] Ghost and God told him if you don't move
[1:24:47] away when I tell you to move there's a
[1:24:49] man coming around there and he's gonna
[1:24:51] measure the tree and measure everything
[1:24:52] and he's gonna you're gonna end up
[1:24:54] fighting him if you don't move at this
[1:24:57] point in time do you think the Prophet
[1:24:59] had the Holy Ghost the air he had it but
[1:25:03] the Holy Ghost is telling you your
[1:25:05] virtue and everything else is gonna be
[1:25:07] tested right here if you don't move and
[1:25:10] go out west you gonna fight this man
[1:25:12] even showed him how he was gonna beat
[1:25:15] him up huh
[1:25:18] but that's not the character he wasn't
[1:25:21] finish test
[1:25:24] the test he went through hallelujah come
[1:25:30] out it's the truth in him he had to be
[1:25:33] tested he had to be tried he had to
[1:25:36] learn how to be God's voice no matter
[1:25:40] what how many of us wouldn't walk keep
[1:25:44] walking but Lord I got a plane to catch
[1:25:47] keep walking how many of us would have
[1:25:49] been submissive to that voice like that
[1:25:51] knowing we were going to miss our flight
[1:25:54] he told him don't always did the Indian
[1:25:57] Africa which one he was supposed to go
[1:25:59] to but he failed to go Billy Paul says
[1:26:02] daddy you better obey the age of the
[1:26:04] Lord he didn't do it he count amoeba and
[1:26:07] he almost died what was he doing being
[1:26:11] trained sometimes we mess up and we
[1:26:15] don't do what God said doing he allow an
[1:26:17] affliction or something to strike us and
[1:26:19] immediately when it happens we know why
[1:26:21] it happens and all he's doing is
[1:26:25] thanking us and telling us the next time
[1:26:27] do it the way I say do it
[1:26:29] that's God why he's perfecting us he's
[1:26:34] bringing us into the place we should
[1:26:36] have been before the fall we were there
[1:26:39] you don't remember I don't either but we
[1:26:43] were there when because we are there we
[1:26:46] are turning back into the very image
[1:26:48] that God we needed Jesus we needed Jesus
[1:26:51] amen that would guarantee us another
[1:26:54] body
[1:26:55] he's sin was judged and he became our
[1:26:58] sin that we might become the
[1:27:00] righteousness of God hallelujah oh my
[1:27:04] let me let me let me let me let me say
[1:27:06] these things and I'm gonna I'm gonna go
[1:27:08] ahead and move on to everything must
[1:27:11] return come back to its original state
[1:27:17] come back to the place it was born
[1:27:20] remember we we hear about the the
[1:27:23] Joseph's story little Bethlehem and here
[1:27:28] was Herod says no I want everybody to go
[1:27:31] back to their homeland where they were
[1:27:33] born and we're gonna take up taxes
[1:27:36] it was cruel it wasn't like they had a
[1:27:40] plane or jet it wasn't like they had an
[1:27:43] air-conditioner car a man here was
[1:27:45] married almost like nine months pregnant
[1:27:47] whatever time she was she was full
[1:27:49] enough to be dis comfortable riding on a
[1:27:52] donkey in Jerusalem from that from from
[1:27:56] Jerusalem to Bethlehem around the
[1:27:57] mountains and everything is bumpity bump
[1:27:59] bump bump right fees right out there
[1:28:05] could've robbed him everything put them
[1:28:08] in harm's way but God had to get them to
[1:28:11] Bethlehem own somebody help me I'm about
[1:28:15] ready to scream and shout maybe this is
[1:28:17] something you don't really know but my
[1:28:19] point is God had to turn them around
[1:28:22] when they didn't even know what God was
[1:28:24] doing you understand me
[1:28:27] it looked cruel it looked hard why would
[1:28:31] God do this for us to us but what was
[1:28:35] waiting on her was a manger that had
[1:28:39] already been built
[1:28:40] you said built yes it was in the wall it
[1:28:42] was a cave in the wall it wasn't a
[1:28:43] little shack built out of straw and tick
[1:28:45] or whatever it was in the wall but that
[1:28:48] that that that particular manger was
[1:28:51] meant for Jesus Christ to be born in no
[1:28:55] other manger because it was written in
[1:28:57] the scripture out of Bethlehem see you
[1:29:02] say well brothers I don't let me tell
[1:29:04] y'all something this is what I try to
[1:29:05] tell people you in a place you didn't
[1:29:07] know your gonna ever be there but when
[1:29:09] God takes you to a place there's
[1:29:11] something he's got for you there's a
[1:29:13] turning point there's something God is
[1:29:14] doing but sometimes people fail to see
[1:29:17] it because everything don't go smooth it
[1:29:20] will not go smooth when God does
[1:29:22] anything is always the rough way it's
[1:29:25] always the harder way but in that hard
[1:29:28] way if we can open our eyes and see what
[1:29:31] God is doing for us spiritually it will
[1:29:35] turn you around and let me say it God
[1:29:37] took Joseph and Mary there so that Mary
[1:29:42] could good birth to Jesus and that's why
[1:29:46] God brings you into a mess sometime just
[1:29:48] so that he can be born
[1:29:50] in you in you but you got to come back
[1:29:54] to the place she was birth come back to
[1:29:57] your homeland come back to this place
[1:29:59] Amen that God made birth himself in you
[1:30:02] right so I'm gonna leave that right
[1:30:08] there there you got a return why because
[1:30:15] even larger ministry was the ministry of
[1:30:17] return and he larger returns five times
[1:30:23] right and so you got to understand his
[1:30:27] ministry it's it's what we cut what I
[1:30:29] call the ministry of resurrection
[1:30:31] because in his ministry there was a
[1:30:33] resurrections taking place hmm and we
[1:30:38] understand that the Ministry of Elijah
[1:30:40] is the ministry of Jesus Christ the
[1:30:43] spirit of Elijah is Jesus Christ and
[1:30:46] Jesus Christ comes in this day to do
[1:30:49] what bring a resurrection now here is
[1:30:53] the old testament saying that get up out
[1:30:54] of the ground they go into the that the
[1:30:57] dimension under the altar but it ain't
[1:31:01] done yet they must return they have to
[1:31:07] return but they cannot return until we
[1:31:11] complete our work you understand me
[1:31:14] they cannot be completed without us they
[1:31:17] cannot go back home until we have been
[1:31:20] established as the life of God right and
[1:31:24] then when we go up we stay up there for
[1:31:28] three and a half years having a
[1:31:31] wonderful time with Jesus I'm gonna sit
[1:31:34] at the Welcome Table but that ain't my
[1:31:37] home and neither it is yours is that
[1:31:40] right we must return back to the earth
[1:31:44] where it all started but it will be a
[1:31:47] new earth you said all brothers I don't
[1:31:51] know about that yes remember when the
[1:31:54] Dove left the ark the dog came back to
[1:31:57] the heart because because the still was
[1:31:59] water on the earth but when that water
[1:32:03] basse wouldn't settle down and and she
[1:32:06] came back with her olive leave and they
[1:32:08] let us stay there for seven more days
[1:32:10] and sent her back out you know his male
[1:32:13] and female right she didn't leave there
[1:32:14] by herself
[1:32:16] these two were one and so they go out
[1:32:21] and don't return hi back to a new Rob
[1:32:25] back to a new earth back to a place they
[1:32:28] had never seen before everything was
[1:32:30] fresh everything looked like it was set
[1:32:33] just for the dog all unclean things were
[1:32:37] done away with huh so is it this new
[1:32:40] world that we're coming back the same
[1:32:43] world the same earth but a different
[1:32:45] world you understand me it we must
[1:32:48] return but the only way we can return is
[1:32:51] that we were with him before the
[1:32:53] foundation of the world ain't no use of
[1:32:57] being worried I don't think you'll find
[1:32:59] corn in the cornfield worried about
[1:33:02] bringing forth corn right you know when
[1:33:06] cows have babies they don't go to the
[1:33:07] doctor they don't get a checkup what
[1:33:11] makes them know how to do it it's
[1:33:14] something in them right you and I must
[1:33:19] understand that if you got that thing in
[1:33:20] you which is Christ you don't have to
[1:33:23] worry I know it gets hard sometimes
[1:33:26] sometimes we get so disappointed maybe
[1:33:31] it's just me maybe it's just me I'm the
[1:33:34] only one I guess
[1:33:35] but I'm gonna tell you something life is
[1:33:38] full of disappointments many of the
[1:33:41] flexions are the righteous but God
[1:33:43] delivered them out of all of them hmm
[1:33:47] and you and I must understand if you
[1:33:51] don't trust God who you gonna trust who
[1:33:54] you gonna lean on I wish I could tell
[1:33:58] you that that revelation how can I say

[1:37:28] Lord well you know but think about it
[1:37:30] every time I'd see Christians who think

[1:37:34] that woman with the issue of blood who
[1:37:37] were basically crawling just to touch
[1:37:39] the hem of His garment through a mob
[1:37:42] through a crowd of people she could have
[1:37:46] been trampled but she had a vision and
[1:37:50] she knew that if I just touch the hem of
[1:37:52] His garment so pain and flick shion's
[1:37:56] and all of that stuff you and I must
[1:37:58] press through to meet Jesus coming from
[1:38:04] the 11th chapter of first Corinthians
[1:38:07] starting at the 23rd verse well I have
[1:38:11] received of the Lord that which also
[1:38:13] I've delivered unto you that the Lord
[1:38:15] Jesus the same night in which he was
[1:38:19] betrayed took bread and when he had
[1:38:21] given thanks he brake it and said take
[1:38:24] eat this is my body which is broken for
[1:38:26] you this do any members of me after the
[1:38:30] same manner also he took the cup when he
[1:38:33] had supped saying this cup is the new
[1:38:35] test
[1:38:35] in my blood this Dewey as often as you
[1:38:39] drink in every members of be for as
[1:38:41] often as you eat this bread and drink
[1:38:43] this cup you do show the Lord's death
[1:38:45] till he come wherefore whosoever shall
[1:38:48] eat this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:38:50] Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[1:38:52] body and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:38:55] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:38:57] that bread and drink of that Cup for he
[1:39:00] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:39:01] eateth and drinketh damnation to himself
[1:39:03] not discerning the Lord's body
[1:39:06] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:39:08] among you and many sleep for if we would
[1:39:11] judge ourselves we should not be judged
[1:39:13] but when we are George we are chastened
[1:39:16] of the Lord that we should not be
[1:39:18] condemned with the world well for my
[1:39:20] brother and when you come together to
[1:39:22] eat tarry one for another
[1:39:24] If any man hunger let him eat at home

[2:05:18] [Applause]
[2:05:19] [Music]
[2:05:29] I believe it all my heart
[2:05:37] that God has something special for us
[2:05:41] and when it comes it won't Terry
[2:05:47] it's so amazing how
[2:05:52] when Jesus appeared to the eleven
[2:05:54] disciples in the upper room it
[2:06:01] transformed everybody
[2:06:05] it took away all doubts even doubting
[2:06:09] Thomas was no longer doubting Thomas
[2:06:12] because he came to a place where he
[2:06:15] believed and that's how it is when God
[2:06:20] moves and I know he will
[2:06:22] it's going to take every doubt every
[2:06:26] spirit of unbelief away from the bride
[2:06:29] of Jesus Christ he said brother books I
[2:06:33] don't believe that she has any problems
[2:06:35] well I remember the time brother Branham
[2:06:38] said the bride hasn't even had or
[2:06:39] revived me and I believe right now that
[2:06:43] God is going to do a great supernatural
[2:06:45] thing with us just prior to our
[2:06:48] transmission and I'm looking forward I'm
[2:06:52] watching and praying every day because
[2:06:57] we need more we need more we got the
[2:07:00] word we be more of the anointing we need
[2:07:04] more of him amen so I know he's going to
[2:07:09] give us what we all need he will return
[2:07:11] just like he's got us returning he's
[2:07:14] going to return and
[2:07:16] looking forward to seeing his return
[2:07:19] even
[2:07:24] [Music]
[2:07:26] open the floodgates even let me pray
[2:07:37] let it read
[2:07:40] well open the floodgates of Aramis
[2:07:47] yeah
[2:07:52] let it rain
[2:07:55] Oh

[2:08:11] [Music]
[2:08:16] mmm lady
[2:08:21] Oh Lord open the floodgates
[2:08:34] [Music]
[2:08:38] let it breath I don't remember the rest
[2:08:44] of that song but I do like that part
[2:08:48] because we can always meet another
[2:08:51] shower right you love the Lord we
[2:08:54] appreciate everybody coming being with
[2:08:57] us tonight
[2:08:58] I don't know whether my brother has a
[2:09:01] song ever got dismissed by God's grace
[2:09:03] we just appreciate everything that God
[2:09:06] is doing I hope the message got over
[2:09:08] today I just you know our fumble
[2:09:11] sometimes when when I'm trying to get
[2:09:13] something I'm excited about it but I'm
[2:09:15] trying to stay in that tone where you
[2:09:17] can understand me so sometimes I and I
[2:09:22] don't know where this all come from I
[2:09:24] feel like I'm doing and orchestrating a
[2:09:26] song but that's something even new to me
[2:09:30] but by God's grace we know that God has
[2:09:34] already has a well planned out for one
[2:09:37] of these old days we got to find
[2:09:39] ourselves going up I believe
[2:09:41] that we are in the last phase in the
[2:09:44] last like they say three seconds I
[2:09:46] believe it was a five how many seconds
[2:09:48] it was two seconds away from the color
[2:09:52] alone in this time whatever that is
[2:09:55] that's how close we are
[2:09:57] they say it's no longer midnight we just
[2:09:59] close to that two seconds three minutes
[2:10:01] to midnight they say two seconds
[2:10:03] but all of the things that are happening
[2:10:05] we ought to look up and keep watchful
[2:10:07] most of all we want to see Christ in us
[2:10:11] every day that's about a word of Prayer
[2:10:14] father God we come before you once again
[2:10:16] we thank you for your goodness we thank
[2:10:19] you for being so good to us Lord you
[2:10:21] have been better to us than we have been
[2:10:22] to ourselves father I say that in my
[2:10:25] prayer because it's so true Lord every
[2:10:27] day as I look at myself and see how
[2:10:30] short I come within myself it give me
[2:10:33] the opportunity Lord to thank you for
[2:10:35] this grace this great grace that you
[2:10:38] have given it to us though there is no
[2:10:40] way that we can make it without your
[2:10:42] amazing grace we thank you for the blood
[2:10:44] of Jesus Christ that was shed for our
[2:10:47] remission of our sins we thank you for
[2:10:50] the life of the blood that you have
[2:10:52] placed within us that we will qualify
[2:10:54] for the gates to open for us when we
[2:10:58] come to the end of our journey
[2:11:00] knowing your God that most of us if not
[2:11:02] all of us will return to the dust from
[2:11:05] which we came but father there are some

[2:11:13] from glory will be changed from law
[2:11:16] total immortality in the moment in the
[2:11:18] twinkling of an eye and father we thank
[2:11:20] you right now for your precious love
[2:11:23] that you have
