TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] take off your car take your car Hey [Music] as we stand I just want to bring something to your attention I know the announcement was made early I believe on the first weekend of May we will have a guest speaker Matthew McGarry disappearance mcGarry's brother you'll be speaking of Friday night and Iowa City Saturday here at 5:00 Sunday morning and Sunday evening here it made the first week in and make also the takes a third weekend of July we will be having for the fray grew up again we will be having Friday Saturday and Sunday services [Music] get by God's grace especially young [Music] as we stand [Music] scriptures [Music] her mom is recuperating well [Music] concerning myself best cholesterol was good everything was really good a man no signs of cancer and so I thank God for his good and he said he's crazy [Music] God is so good to us all I could [Music] this is the first Chapel [Music] moment [Music] Genesis 1:27 through the twenty to twenty eighth verse so God created man in his own image in the image of God God blessed him God said unto them be fruitful and multiply earth having dominion over the fish of the CEO much nine [Music] [Applause] well this is the word of promise at this time will I come say I shall have a son not only this also admitted by one even by our Father the children being not kidding either having done any good boy [Music] not at work [Music] it is written Jacob a my love [Music] Audrey thank you for your grace thanks for your mercy [Music] love you Oh [Music] [Music] god is good to us [Music] [Music] we've received the message insanity [Music] we had no idea what [Music] in school trying to find out where we belong in this world [Music] but in all of that we realize that these things are great and to be able to establish yourself in a way where you don't have to struggle it's like now trust and pushed in all of us like that with God makes some of us some of us have it easier than others but by God's grace we affirmed and we're now finding our place in this world when we think about purpose and that's the subject this morning one purpose purpose is the reason for which someone exists or is done may [Music] everybody have a little ceremony Wow I live with her one year old the dogma graduate there all day giving [Music] but be sometime [Music] I am calling if we go back to the book of Genesis we find that in Genesis first chapter [Music] Trading all these me but it's made [Music] [Applause] we heard this before because treated all these days it's like [Music] god forbid [Applause] [Music] we saw out of a doll or the reflection of the Living God Oh was it me God he was a god aided by the bother that oh god was invisible we could still find the way out of the egg his accent [Music] what God was like God was at the ADA we plenty of degree of course out of film my way of the purpose so they need after that ball we know but it's insane if I said we came into this world and still it shaped and iniquity right and so we bared the nature of Adam no longer the nature of God Adam bared the nature of God but because of the fall we now bear the nature of Adam you and I have been called and elected and all of this is a program all of this is a purpose all of this is a a beautiful thing once we can see what God is doing we understand we were created to be fallen creatures we were made to be in the image and likeness of God you're reflecting something no matter who you are you are a reflection of something you're either reflecting heaven or you reflect our lives are reflections of something somewhere you either reflecting life for you reflecting all right if it's by there's no shadow nothing can make a shadow but if it's mixed with dark in life if late to shout that's why the song is said gave I walk through the family in shadow of the end of Yui because of darkness [Music] and light mix we are what we call a shadow we're reflecting something so we are really shallows of light are we reflecting a life from somewhere and if you are a Christian there being a shadow it's only proved that there is a life where you can't not see in this life we conduct but in the real life and not die because of this life has a death in it is that right the Bible said be aboard and we are pointed to death one right we know that death has been accorded to us because everybody died it doesn't matter if you rich poor beautiful you go down a mess it brings a translation it is important that we understand the purpose of Jesus Christ about that Jesus Christ is the light of the world is that right the box that he is light and the darkness cannot comprehend it [Music] because you're living that's what we call life and that I dislike this this model I miss pure reflection why do needs have all this religious no religious we find religion everywhere but because there's something in the heart of lay makes you know he was not created to die he knows that there is something greater than this life that's why the Bible said if you put all your hope and trust in this life you are above I mean most miserable and if this is it you live in your diet you live in your diet it why do we work so hard to establish and we see things in this life why we got you know what happens with us we have a purpose because without a purpose you go in saying we don't even know what you're here for or what you come for you I don't care if you feel like you were born to be a janitor at least that's a purpose to live but when there is no purpose your mind something's happened to your mind you want not only your friends to know that you have a purpose but your family no should know you have a purpose you come to church because you wanna come to see what your purpose is you might be a lawyer doctor you know successful in this life but there still something that makes you know that you came here with a greater purpose hallelujah your reflection you are our reflection and that there is life and that there is death and when you mix those two together you have a shadow the physical has to die but if you are reflecting by your model life the light of heaven then you're reflecting eternal light that right that's why God said you must be born again cuz when we first came we were children arrived arrived we were reflecting what yeah we live the way they live inhale [Music] then you know we're an expression when a person has been so bad and so evil in beabea are they about some man will come and says Amen talking about and that's not a compliment right oh it was up dollars that's not a compliment because doll and the spine or the peak it maybe is the nastiness mostly unwanted animals that's written in the Bible I guess people think I don't talk about your dog I'm just telling you the name Jehovah naw hallelujah that that just came downtown so you and I must understand so what let me balance that out the duct Bible calls the Gentile Gentile dog you know why because the dog was closer than a brother that right a dog you can rip him who can be them you can stop him and he spilled long the kiss with your face but if you are reflecting by your water life the life of heaven in Europe respecting the eternal life God then when you die you can know how then go to that light because that's what your exact understanding whatever you are respecting when you dock that's where you go if you are reflecting light then you're reflecting that light when you die you go back if you are respecting hell or when you die you go to the dark you go to hear that light becomes a magnet to yourself so the dog [Music] hello I'm coming give your altar dog world you respect this and you can do a bowl no other way but to dock so we are in a reflection so we see that as sure as the Holy Spirit reflects light and life so this depth reflects darkness who somebody help me is you and I must understand our purpose in this world is not to reflect darkness we are not children of the night we are not children of the darkness the verb said we are children of the light and therefore won't be therefore in the light at all right these are problems what are you saying what caused is a man or a woman to walk in darkness is on short word seeing Tina's unbelief smoking gambling drinking carousing is not seeing is the proof of see it is the fruit of our vision hallelujah but seeing his unbelief is that right elleny that committed the first sin what was it unbelief the Bible tells us upon the first dawn he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the word - what the devil is that right that's why Jesus said if any man believeth in me though he was dead yet shall he live that right so you gotta understand life eternal life come by believing in Jesus Christ always there any other way there's no other way from beginning once real life when no I want was the escape and then the blood there was only one door to the earth you didn't have several doors there was only one door that door was to get in and to come out is that right when it comes a mentor to Christ he said I am the door there are no others own we must understand the purpose where our mom's coming to in just a minute because if we can understand the purpose of Jesus Christ we'll begin to see the purpose for which we were born in the beginning we were to be sons and daughters of God but because of the fall we were born into in iniquity [Music] they were infected both light and dark product of the feel then Jesus come along as you must make the tree God or you must make it evil see you can't make it true the tree good and evil why because the shadow in the and the real product has become one is that right Solomon says in that day that the shadow because what I can't give it to you Hinduism take give a deal no church can give it to you don't reach you can give it to you no bishop not elders no pulp there's only one person that can give you eternal life and that's Jesus Christ Himself hallelujah there are not two source of resources there's only one eternal life that eternal life before he was God he was called Elohim which means self existing wrong so I said well who made God when you figure that out you become God no man knows him ha come on salat it his ways of past finding out God does things that that you and I can't even explain but when you do what he says you and make sense I'm coming to it we are to aid what we call free age this is the age of freedom come out of her my people and be not partakers of her iniquity an age that God breaks the yokes destroys the works of the devil is that right because the mother said that's why Jesus Christ claimed that he might destroy the works of the enemy and you have come that God can work through you to prove that he has destroyed the works of the enemy that's why I testify this morning when the doctor said I had cancer Jesus said no hallelujah come on somebody when the Dodgers try to give up and say all kinds of things Amen Jesus still says no it's not what the doctor says is what Jesus says I thank God for the doctors don't get me wrong hallelujah appreciate our since to further she works in the teeth God can straight my teeth but God brought her here so that she hit cuz she has the method she knows what to do she knows how to do it right so God uses that method also so if y'all have a problem with teeth you know you got a system so it just it's the same it's the same you know not how brother over here we got a but insurance man now we got a doctor it is just but God said these things in the church but what makes them who they are it's not the education it's the God that's in them that will make them different from all the others who have gotten their degrees and everything else y'all see what I'm saying I appreciate it chichi they had the spinner to get there you just don't jump there you know you have the work but in all of that I'd obviously don't manage me I appreciate this God brings us to a place I mean let me say like this when we think about eternal life as I said and you show I showed you last week where I had that one piece of paper and that hope is a paper with eternal life that was calling everything there was nothing outside of that sheet of paper God is in all he feel all he's above all he's through all there's nothing on the outside for God to shop for everything that God needs was in every attribute that God wanted to express was already in him is that right even the Bible said that God said if there be another god I don't know him Alleluia so therefore all these other things that consider a call themselves God or just fake us imaginations is that right and Jesus Christ and then proved it when God sent Moses down to Pharaoh amen fail no thought he was a god until he met God I never could never thought he was God until he met God see there are people who think they're gods but I tell you what none of them can raise the dead none of them can give you breath of life none of them can heal the sick is that right listen even down in Egypt when Pharaoh when Moses called for diseases let this plague happen let this play happen chan is in jammers call for the plagues these all know that they were able to do that did you know those same plagues they call they kept they called every disease they call for they call it the saddest part of it was they weren't able to dismiss it they couldn't get rid of it because you see it took the God who creates to undo it Moses was the only one that could call and those frogs and Royals and everything else had to see I love it see when you thank you something God will prove me to be nothing here in proverbs 3 and 1 he says my son forget not my law but let thine heart keep I commend for length of days and longer life and peace shall they add to deep let not mercy and truth for safety find him about thy neck write them upon the tables of thine heart so thou so shalt thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and may that in the in the Lord with all that trustees may trust yes it trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not to thine own understanding in all that way acknowledge him and he shall direct but if Eve had only not lean if she would have just kept in faith but God had told us we would not be where we are but surely you'll not die because it if you break one word if you eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall surely not and that old serpent came a hissy I'm gonna tell people you find a little they men they all up hey you better watch that y'all understand me so you look at these thinking yes and what do you mean brother Brooks if you trust in the Lord don't go oh Lord the doctors say I'm gonna die right and because you don't you know listen when you have a purpose alright I'll just need that Pharaoh could not kill him but God had already given him a purpose when you know let you the pride of Jesus Christ and God reveal to you you're gonna take the rapture no Dublin hair can take you officer hallelujah if the only way you can trust God in the way that you should you must be bound by love that right you must be powered by love even when it came to motion a pause let me stay like this they were pow pow by changes like levels of love to do the will of God that's that's only he was a prisoner there was a prison he was a fail he was in a don't you wish that God had you so bound up that all you just love his Satan didn't mean no nothing to you he come around you and you like ignore him you know come on y'all know it's true if somebody likes you and you don't like them you don't have no problem I don't care how they look they can dress their best and you know try to show off but if you don't like them don't bother you one bit Wow because you throw in love with someone else that's how it is with the true believer you become someone that has to walk sometime by themselves about yourself when you really love God Satan hates you [Music] hmm we say they saw all the time where he leaves me I will follow huh we need to repair hallelujah we don't follow he leads but we just don't follow like we ought to hallelujah is that right this and here's another thing the Bible says blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful you know we do that even in church somebody get all happy and then some of us Amen make our remarks in our minds but don't take all that let me tell you something it takes more than what we give it more than what we kiddin we need to give you more hallelujah I get jealous sometimes you know you had a restaurant and something and they playin footballer whatever basketball in there and they hit important the waves come through the television set strikes two people they jump in scream aah because they have been transformed into that dimension and they have become a part of the game as though they were there hallelujah and the Bible said we set in heavenly places in Christ Jesus and as they worship in heaven we ought to be worshiping here if we just get in the spirit of God and then you'll see and then that same on auntie is here right now passing through this building shouldn't be a quiet soul in here let me say like this this is the quietest grace ever when I say this I'm not talking about this church I'm time I living on earth because inhale they screaming and in heaven they scream hallelujah you took quiet this is it but when you get to heaven I trust you how puppeteers there's gonna be a lot of noise guarantee you and I'm gonna be one of the vocals [Music] hallelujah listen here when we see there's not coming just of all the purpose purpose I haven't even gotten to it yet but when you see that we have a purpose and our purpose our purpose our main purpose is to reflect heaven let thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven whatever they doing in heaven Lord let me do it on earth you say well I'm not in heaven but you need to be born again because Paul said now we sit in your heavenly places in Christ Jesus right here David David says I acknowledge my sins unto thee and by iniquities have I not hear I said I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord and thou forgave the iniquity of my sin and y'all know what iniquity is it's when you know to do good and you still don't do you know it's wrong and you do it anyhow we call that iniquity it's a little bit beyond sin is that right for this cell everyone that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou may it be found so what are you saying I'm saying because you're born again because you got God in you that is a perfect seed but that perfect seed must be made manifest and while is growing up in you you gonna make mistakes hallelujah but we have a way of escape by way of confession if you confess your sin he is faithful and just to forgive you of your sins and to cleanse you from all unrighteousness boom or somebody ought to be happy fire because as soon as we get the darkness out God pushes the light air [Music] is that right the Bobby said he world that all your whole body me feel with light no space let me test me the whole body is to be filled with what light hallelujah and how come dark is when doctors come in these same the lied right here that's why when you see darkness useful to turn your head pray you know they talk anyway let's move on it's all what happens when a person say they twisted and they don't enjoy being a Christian doc hello I enjoy being a Christian [Music] there's never been a time I have not enjoyed being a Christian I'm not shame to be a hello I enjoy it do I make mistakes yes but I still enjoy being a Christian hey you don't know like I know what he done for me all cases see that the Lord is good blessed is the man that trusted in him and God hit me Trust trust in him hello God's purpose for us is to trust in him when there is a wheezing like there's a way out of no way you trust in here tell me when you see that arrow where all your world is falling apart you trust in him now you show what do you mean make it up baby clear up when Shadrach Meshach and Abednego amen was chosen by God to be put in a fire advantage guess what they trusted in the Living God and you know what they said we will not bow down to your image why because I know the true and living God we know the real true God hallelujah amen is that all you mean think about Daniel in the lion's den then you trusted in the Living God he has served him and he relied on you knew that no lion was gonna eat him was caught it already told him hallelujah before he went to Babylon where we're gonna be like you know the Lord let me tell you something trust me something else if you really trust God Satan cannot bridge you will never get depressed if you really trust you only become depressed is when you begin to doubt God God says seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things will be added unto you hallelujah is that the truth the Bible said ask anything in my name and leaving that you will receive and he said it's yours I don't get this school I don't care this work I don't care this marriage I don't care this whatever it is if you trust God and you believe him and you live with him he will bless you [Music] Trust is something else I can't explain it but all I know when God's just gave me that revelation of trust I thought sometimes you think you have revelation but the Lord showed me he said I'll never leave you I will always be [Music] is that right that's the Bible when you last see them they come in your life right in winterthur think that's not heavenly you lost trust in God some way so I need toy the Bible said in his presence is the fullness of joy shop if you're not in his palette don't expect fullness of joy or making sense who else we gonna turn to you and I if the rapture doesn't take place soon some of us when I say da me if you've been born again you can never die you passed from death in the night now reflect about the fight right but if we die when we die [Music] like the devil in you that you get on your deathbed you know what he's gonna say Oh really thank you for there I can I got a list of all these tapes you've got active record of you altogether got records but it's practice mean nothing because the Bible said no weapon formed against you shall prosper not even in their attempt to have a long list but there's one thing that he doesn't have power over and that is the blood of Jesus hallelujah and the blood of Jesus washes away every sin and cleanses everything so he is all you did is you did that Percy I'm under the blood I'm under the blood and as long as you remain under the blood there is no sin God cannot see your seat hallelujah [Music] David Freese is waiting for you Oh God in Zion and unto thee said about didn't perform all thou that here in prayer unto these shall all flesh come iniquity prevail against me as for our transgressions thou shalt purge them away blessed is the man who chooses and causes you truth God you say oh I came to God God God had to pull you to him he told you you didn't talk to him he told you [Music] that's what I did God God is perfect he makes no mistake hallelujah these are all coming what do you say think about it I love [Music] Todd comes when we got into the bottle crowd yeah that's all he's really disappointed I don't care what I gotta have proof myself and give no comment he walks through the door and he said Thomas Here I am wash your hand in the side everything here and the Thomas my god you see so even an ultimately if you really want to believe God [Music] [Applause] oh I'm feeling good right down blessed is the link God calling you [Music] what big what makes that light [Music] [Applause] son David because he is the only one that can bring for my vasila is when you throw him God why we don't have a place to both of rain cause you know you came as a cubit to your statue hallelujah if I could have brother [Music] [Applause] [Music] but nevertheless evening God knew if I had had a Louisville high to me I may not have been here you never say so you look at these things and God knew he know this that's what we need but the time said he called us he calls you you he draws you is that white Jesus had no making color to me except the father draw so what do you say if God is drawing me if God is drawing you he has a purpose for you oh oh let me hurry up let me hurry up I've gone a little far longer than I planned on this section I'm gonna do I jumping out listen we talked about the rapture and i'ma jump because for the rapture [Music] [Music] and we failed it we can stop you somehow oh god I can't take it oh please let your rap to come you've gotta be hoping you ready you ready for something you better make sure you're ready for word you know listen so you look at this day is not your reality I got this [Music] is not a way [Music] [Music] you see them say when you get to the place and you ready you come up with a rustic kind is it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I see a lot of Christians they will nothing wrap waiting for the Lord to come back they're the ones that will be changed it will be a situation [Music] [Music] that's been born again not of corruptible seed but incorruptible seed and you have allowed the Holy Spirit to mature you suffer look at those trees out there and they cannot write and in the morn you get four seasons and those trees got to take it all that wind is blowing on me we can run get half of the comb but they got to stand right there and think springtime thunder lightning they have no shelter and God comes right in there and that's from that tree amen there were perhaps week before the you know order whatever and that season came in all of a sudden that will skyrocket see sometimes we need rock we need God to shake us somewhere we need trials we need tribulations we need persecutions we need these things why because it and when it rocks that means the root of the tree closely hallelujah money go home and crypts the solid rock see and we knew nothing Cohoes encrypt it let me go not gonna be any letting go here ba because I've got a rock that's dripping up with it's okay so you so what is we is a real image of God see tonight yes oh I'm a better time president born a Baptist are born what we call method you won't be born of God you not Christ in you and when you born of a church that what you are you will not go any further than what that one of God's that means you're born of the word and you can take it from Appalachia from beginning to the ending from Genesis to Revelation and they all say Amen you can say Hebrews 13:8 he's the same yesterday today and forever he's a God that changed not that belong in the log or church or supplier [Music] hello mr. true millions of people follow a little time because they never into the they're right Jocelyn Balaam is lonely too that has been given to that [Music] and they met but nightclub you wanna dance let's go there you know they came he produced another fire or the cloud indicates they got their lights in everything else [Music] they up [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] got to you real now to your purpose yo old robot I continuity I love it never up and I'm throwing out hidden to them you can't through the will of God on your own you've got the sweet lord holy hallelujah mows it has to be a child and then out into the wilderness forty years for God to beat all that education out of it does everybody think well I'm a plus I can help God you can't help God the only thing you can do is yield to him I'm almost done with this section it's perfection excuse me God's character and if I think that right because of calling the Peter that right Peter said of all these virtues you you'll never be bearing neither will you fall you will never be hallelujah but he said if you like any of these virtues unities pasa means you are going to fall [Music] Am I [Music] he does why what happened Eve should I believe God [Music] when you become a you are found even when you wanna do something wrong cause you are prisoner y'all hear what I'm sayin when you are a prisoner I want you relative once you become a personal God God gives you whatever you desire to have you become a mature [Music] because they came from a supernatural world hallelujah and when you realize that once you wanna get you no longer just natural but you have become supernatural and your life is supernatural nowhere near [Music] they're like this you [Music] or is it [Music] [Music] but Jesus was the knight and the Bible said he was the life of me in other words when we saw Jesus we saw the first every story he was the very adamant give up call the second Adam of the last he was the Adam that we were supposed to see and understand he was the father [Music] the second atom would Jesus Christ we must be born again right and when when you're born again now you become a part of God and whatever God is if I say whatever it is you are in this world that's your spirit but but but but listen how many of them you know they don't get it but you and I must get it if you want to make a rafter you must get it and you know what that is the whole thing behind it is submission making a rapture you must submit to Christ you must take this word this is Lord whatever you want me to do this is what I love it whatever I'm gonna stop doing this what I will stop you know I'm gonna do everything you told me to do in this time when you get an attitude like that god I didn't see you yes she will so let me say like this Moses he could have stopped Pharaoh with the power and authority that move is that right because God told Moses I'm sending you down to Egypt and you're going to be gone with your tips was he not he was God to the Egyptian he didn't have to put up with Pharaohs nonsense but he was such a prisoner he was not going to move into Gaza and whatever God said do he did it right who was the truth you think about Paul if Paul wanted to stop those people from beat him and killing him Paul for the did it he could have done it Paul had the authority to do it but he was so imprisoned here's a love yous is bound by love is the character of Christ was to be seen and that's what we must understand no matter what we suffer God is looking for the character of Christ we can't get around these people you know some of us I'm telling you what the problem is is that we don't want to submit we won't we want our own Crespi's we want our own purpose we want everything to super see what God called us to be and when you do that you are see of being anointed by the devil yummy because Lucifer was the one who chose to do something outside of the he wanted to be more [Music] first Peter 1:3 3:11 I'm not gonna read it but this is how you confirm you election [Music] but I'm saying it close we talk about purpose that's why so many churches do this what I'm thinking is not they're men all over the world and we're not organized we're not part of a union that the same and it's easy when table against that right miss Paul was nowhere near the disciples would be nice with all met Jesus on the road to Damascus two men even have he is in the desert came back preaching the same gospel but because the Holy Ghost will teach you we have teachers don't get me wrong but when there's I come to places in the spotlight says Lord what do you mean he's real and he tells me lean not to your own understanding so you know if you know anything about five burning cabin it's during a time when the cattle has given birth to dates [Music] [Music] you know you know you don't know but they just get together they just carry on but when they get to the destiny these cows begin to make certain noises I don't care that little pal never loads of that God will make his way all the way over to mama you know why cuz that look half knows Mama's voice and you know to the macula to that to the herder eat all the you know those cows making already but does not care if they know the sound they know the right sound this is wrong - I'm bringing you to you see when you truly born of God if you are seed of God you were hear the voice of God in the midst of all the confusion hallelujah no matter what the churches are saying no matter what the preachers are saying no matter who they are but when you hear the voice of Jesus you gonna make your way on in here you're gonna hear the voice of God because he said my sheep here is my voice and a spring that they will not [Music] [Music] hello unlikely know [Music] out please don't think I'll ride y'all think [Music] that right I'm people God [Music] will you make a rapture oh because I'll accept yes ma'am go back to team [Music] [Music] [Music] all right [Music] you know we're gonna [Music] running toward the game suddenly everybody beat me to it I don't know but one thing I do know is that egg was designed just for me [Music] and if I came through all of that my dad is Lawrence my granddaddy's loan my great-great nanny Lawrence traveling all those years thousands of years until I reach 1956 oh it was my day in London and you saw our problems what are you saying if God was so concerned about me in my natural birth what about my spirit it doesn't matter if somebody came to church before me it doesn't matter if they've been a member of the church before I became one I'm ordained this bird is all day to bring me to birth Dunstan's I trust him I have nothing else to do but
