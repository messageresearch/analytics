[3:31] and
[3:44] um everybody there amen and Moses said
[3:48] unto the Lord then the Egyptians shall
[3:52] hear it for thou broughtest us this
[3:55] people in thy might from among them and
[3:59] and they will tell it to the inhabitants
[4:02] of this land for they have heard that
[4:05] the Lord art among his people that thou
[4:08] Lord art seen face to face and that thy
[4:12] Cloud standeth over them and that thou
[4:15] goeth before them by day in a pillar of
[4:18] cloud and in a pillar of Fire by night
[4:23] now if Thou shalt kill all the people as
[4:26] one man then the Nations which have
[4:30] heard the fame of these will speak
[4:34] saying because the Lord was not able to
[4:37] bring this people into the land which he
[4:40] swear unto them therefore he had slain
[4:44] them in the wilderness and now I beseech
[4:47] thee let the power of my Lord be greater
[4:51] be great according according according
[4:55] as thou Hast spoken saying the Lord is
[5:00] longsuffering and of great Mercy
[5:02] forgiving iniquity and
[5:04] transgressions and by no means clearing
[5:08] the guilty visiting the iniquity of the
[5:11] fathers upon the children unto the third
[5:13] and fourth generation pardon I beseech
[5:16] Thee the iniquity of this people
[5:20] according unto the the greatness of thy
[5:22] mercy and as thou has forgiven this
[5:25] people from Egypt even unto now
[5:31] am turn with me to Luke please first
[5:45] chapter we'll begin reading at the 76th
[5:48] verse 76-
[5:51] 79 Luke
[5:54] 1 and thou child shall be called the
[5:58] prophet of the highest but thou shall go
[6:02] before the face of the Lord to prepare
[6:04] his ways to give knowledge of Salvation
[6:08] unto his people by the remission of
[6:11] their sins Through The Tender Mercies of
[6:14] our God whereby the day spring from on
[6:18] high have visited us to give light to
[6:21] them that sat in darkness and in the
[6:24] shadow of death to give our to guide our
[6:28] feet into the way of Peace amen one more

[7:03] be in their
[7:08] foreheads father we come before you
[7:13] Lord as humbly as we know how and we
[7:16] thank you for your grace and your
[7:20] mercy Lord we thank you for being so
[7:24] good to us for allowing us to have a
[7:29] wonderful day a day that you have you've
[7:34] ordained to be so and I thank you Father
[7:38] for ordaining us to be here for father
[7:43] we have come for a purpose and that
[7:46] purpose is to reflect you to make the
[7:49] world know that you are God and that you
[7:53] the same yesterday today and forever
[7:56] bless your people this morning forgive
[7:59] us of our sin cleanse us from all our
[8:01] righteousness and unrighteous
[8:03] unrighteousness and we pray father that
[8:05] you would give us Grace Lord to move
[8:08] completely out of your way that you
[8:11] would have preeminence here this morning
[8:14] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen
[8:18] you love the Lord you may be
[8:25] [Music]
[8:27] seated surely I
[8:30] think about the goodness of the Lord
[8:32] Jesus and I'm always thinking about how
[8:36] unworthy I
[8:37] am to stand before you
[8:41] all it is only by the grace of
[8:45] God I think about how this is such an
[8:49] evil
[8:51] age and I was listening to that this
[8:54] morning and a little bit last night and
[8:57] and brother brandham goes on to say say
[8:59] how this age is so
[9:03] deceitful he said out of all of the ages
[9:07] the Christian ought to be on her on on
[9:10] their
[9:12] toes because Satan is
[9:15] so
[9:18] smooth he knows how to deceive
[9:23] he's very good at
[9:25] it if there's such a
[9:28] thing but the point is that he is
[9:31] profession
[9:33] professional at what he
[9:37] does we know that that the devil is
[9:40] nothing to play
[9:42] with the Bible call him wiser than
[9:45] Daniel and we realize Amen in this
[9:49] age there are going to be a many
[9:52] Christians who missed the Rapture
[9:55] because they thought they were
[9:57] Christians
[9:59] and that is the job of the
[10:02] enemy to make people believe that
[10:06] they're
[10:07] Christians uh when they're not amen this
[10:11] is the age of
[10:13] worship worship
[10:15] man worship images wor worship of
[10:20] themselves the Bible said they will be
[10:22] lovers of themselves and more lovers of
[10:26] pleasure than lovers of God Amen so we
[10:30] find out that Satan has
[10:33] achieved basically most of the things
[10:36] that he sought out to achieve and y'all
[10:39] remember when uh brother long was here I
[10:42] I believe in this uh message here he
[10:45] talked about how Satan still believed
[10:48] that he's going to outsmart God I mean
[10:51] he really
[10:53] believes that he's going to outsmart God
[10:57] regardless to what the word say he is a
[11:00] god of science so we believe that Satan
[11:04] thinks by way of
[11:05] science he's going to achieve his goal
[11:10] and become god well in this age we know
[11:14] that Satan is God over this world y'all
[11:19] understand me the Bible tells us and our
[11:22] Prophet says that Satan is the God of
[11:24] this evil
[11:27] age we want to say that we uh by God's
[11:31] grace need to always take
[11:35] inventory Satan is here to deceive you
[11:38] but don't allow yourself to deceive
[11:42] yourself right call black black and call
[11:46] white white amen uh uh don't settle for
[11:51] H
[11:53] lukewarm life the Bible said that we
[11:56] ought to be hot or cold I want to
[12:00] entitle this message
[12:02] beholding his
[12:06] face and you know I I thought about how
[12:09] brother Chris brought some
[12:11] thoughts and I was just so excited
[12:14] because I sat
[12:17] there and I thought about how that
[12:21] everybody is uh uh uh how would I say
[12:27] attacking uh the face of the Lord
[12:30] and when God came down his seven angels
[12:33] and and and and and and brother bradam
[12:36] uh told us after the picture was taken
[12:39] God told him to turn the picture to the
[12:42] right and by doing so we saw you know
[12:46] the face of what we call the hofman head
[12:48] it looks so much like that and um
[12:52] brother bam said that was his
[12:55] Lord and it is not only his Lord
[13:00] but it's your
[13:02] Lord it is truly a great
[13:08] manifestation of what we call the son of
[13:12] man now I wanted to go back by God's
[13:16] grace to the second Exodus which was
[13:21] there in in in in in in in in E uh Egypt
[13:25] uh we in Genesis how God Called Moses
[13:28] and see Moses is a a very important
[13:32] Prophet uh he he is to the Gentiles as
[13:35] well as to the Jews mainly to the Jews
[13:38] because he was a Jewish Prophet but they
[13:42] were in
[13:44] bondage and Moses was chosen by God and
[13:48] and you know the Bible doesn't tell us
[13:50] much about his parents but basically
[13:53] give us names on who they were and we
[13:57] find out that Moses the Bible said that
[13:59] he had chose to
[14:01] suffer uh uh with the children of
[14:04] Affliction than to be called Pharaoh's
[14:07] daughter I I feel the same
[14:10] way uh because I had rather be in a
[14:13] little place like this then to be in h a
[14:18] mega
[14:19] church uh like Egypt and be
[14:24] lost now God had dealt with Israel in
[14:28] such a Mighty way Moses was one of the
[14:32] first to talk with God face to face I
[14:37] know that Adam and Eve saw him and they
[14:41] talked to him but since the fall Moses
[14:45] was one of the
[14:48] first uh to
[14:50] talk with God now Enoch you know he seen
[14:54] him cuz the Bible said he walked with
[14:57] God
[14:59] and so Moses the Bible stresses that
[15:02] Moses talked with God face to face amen
[15:08] that means Moses was here and God was
[15:12] here right amen and so when I thought
[15:16] about that I thought about how
[15:21] important this was because or this is
[15:25] you see because even in the holies of
[15:28] holies the cherubims are not looking in
[15:31] the opposite direction but they are both
[15:35] beholding the glory of God face to
[15:40] face they are those who are watching
[15:43] over the uh uh uh laws and the grace of
[15:47] God The Mercy Seat all of that and these
[15:51] cherubims are looking face to face when
[15:55] I thought about that I thought about
[15:57] Paul who was the uh First Church message
[16:02] Angel and he was a prophet and I thought
[16:05] about William bradam who was a a a
[16:09] prophet of our day
[16:12] and uh how could I say it Paul looked
[16:16] toward William brandham and William
[16:19] brandham looked toward Paul and both of
[16:23] these angels or
[16:25] Messengers were set in place to God the
[16:28] mercy
[16:29] SE hallelujah hallelujah even so Paul
[16:34] said
[16:36] except if an angel and I wonder why he
[16:39] used that word Angel see if an angel
[16:42] come and preach something other than
[16:44] what I have preached he said let it be a
[16:47] curse and then William bradam comes
[16:49] along and said except an angel preach
[16:52] what Paul preached because I have
[16:54] preached what Paul preached amen let him
[16:57] be a curse amen so you see it's like
[17:01] they are alpha and
[17:04] omega now we realize amen that Jesus
[17:07] Christ is Alpha and Omega but in order
[17:11] for God to to to do something he's a
[17:14] spirit the Bible said no man have seen
[17:17] him at any time so what God does is that
[17:20] he enails uh he he veils himself Amen in
[17:26] something that mankind can see him amen
[17:30] hallelujah because you and I have never
[17:32] seen
[17:35] Holiness Hallelujah but there is a
[17:38] reflection of Holiness that comes by
[17:41] through Us by him so we realize amen
[17:46] that Moses came down out of the mountain
[17:50] having seen God face to face so much so
[17:53] his whole face was illuminated is that
[17:57] right Hebrews said that God that Moses
[18:00] veiled
[18:02] himself thank
[18:05] God because if Moses had not veiled
[18:07] himself where would we be had the people
[18:10] seen
[18:12] God hallelujah but the glory of God was
[18:16] so upon Moses that Moses veiled himself
[18:21] and what did it do it veiled
[18:25] Israel they saw Moses but they didn't
[18:29] see God y'all hear what I'm saying oh it
[18:32] was availing because it was the law but
[18:35] his grace is an unveiling this is why
[18:39] the prophet of God preached a message
[18:41] the
[18:42] unveiling of God because now it is
[18:46] Grace come on somebody remember Moses
[18:50] wanted to see God he had seen all kinds
[18:54] of Miracles he saw the Red Sea open he
[18:57] saw God curs Egypt he saw the pledge
[19:00] fall but Moses says Lord I've seen all
[19:04] of your acts but Lord I want to see you
[19:08] y'all hear what I'm saying Moses had
[19:10] talked to him and everything else but
[19:12] Moses wanted to see God listen every
[19:16] bride member wants to see God we have
[19:19] seen healing we have seen deliverances
[19:23] we have seen all his
[19:25] acts but we want to see God Amen
[19:30] God said to
[19:31] Moses no man have seen my
[19:36] face and
[19:39] live and I often wondered because
[19:42] remember now God is a god of
[19:45] immor he changes his
[19:48] mask right but now because you got to
[19:51] realize that when Moses went down to
[19:53] Egypt Moses became the face of God right
[19:59] yeah he sure did Moses became the face
[20:02] of God but Moses wasn't interested in
[20:06] his
[20:06] face he was interested in God's face
[20:11] Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying
[20:13] because remember amen God told Moses
[20:16] when you go down to Egypt I'm going to
[20:18] you will become as God unto the
[20:22] Egyptian Hallelujah not that Moses uh uh
[20:27] physically became God
[20:29] he wasn't working with his physical he
[20:31] was working with the spiritual aspect of
[20:34] Moses and Moses God would have never
[20:36] said that to Moses except that God knew
[20:39] that he had a plan to step into
[20:43] Moses Hallelujah because remember Moses
[20:46] was a man with
[20:50] God it wasn't God who broke the word it
[20:54] was Moses who smoked the rock twice amen
[20:58] but all the other times God walked with
[21:03] Moses but the day has
[21:05] come hallu God said I won't no no longer
[21:09] just be with you I will be in you
[21:12] amen wo come on somebody so we realize
[21:16] amen Moses saw what God said okay Moses
[21:20] I'm G let you see my glory I'm G let you
[21:22] see some of it but not all of it right
[21:24] you represents the
[21:26] Law right this back of ours is the only
[21:29] thing that has no
[21:31] protection if a man want to kill you he
[21:35] goes for the part that you can't where
[21:36] you can't see You're vulnerable in your
[21:38] back hello and and basically that
[21:42] represents law because I'm going tell
[21:44] you something law brings death so God
[21:47] showed Moses that part of
[21:50] him there was no freedom in the law
[21:54] there was no life in the law and every
[21:57] man that had the Lord
[21:59] died amen only the elect came out of
[22:04] thatall and it was only God could give
[22:07] the elect Grace yes sir amen y'all hear
[22:09] what I'm saying but everything else I
[22:12] don't care if they were born of this
[22:15] tribe and born of that tribe and born
[22:18] listen they all failed to complete the
[22:21] law and the Bible said by one breaking
[22:25] one word you're guilty of them all
[22:29] so even though Paul bragged and he said
[22:32] he goes on and he says listen I'm
[22:35] blameless only by Grace Paul y'all hear
[22:38] what I'm saying he said I've done all
[22:40] the
[22:41] laws right and what God says your works
[22:46] is as filthy rags amen but he was being
[22:50] he was down on the level of those who
[22:53] who was accusing him and blaming him so
[22:55] Paul condescended and said listen I'm
[22:58] speaking
[23:00] foolishly huh and I'm I'm telling you
[23:03] something I'm speaking foolishly but if
[23:05] you want to go there I'll go there with
[23:07] you I'm a Pharisee of all Pharisees oh
[23:11] come on somebody I studed under gah I am
[23:15] blameless nothing in my bloodline
[23:18] defiles me they have kept every
[23:25] order but if Paul had not met Jesus
[23:30] amen come on somebody he would have been
[23:35] lost he would have been all right but
[23:38] when Jesus
[23:40] came it changed from law unto
[23:43] Grace cuz no man can be justified by the
[23:48] law see
[23:51] remember God did a great work with Moses
[23:56] and Moses was a shadow and a type of
[23:59] what God was going to do because this is
[24:01] the Third
[24:03] Exodus in this Exodus we realize amen
[24:07] that this Pharaoh that's over the world
[24:10] is worse than the pharaoh of
[24:13] Egypt because everybody knew who Pharaoh
[24:17] was but in this age people do not know
[24:21] who the real slave master
[24:25] is it's Satan sir
[24:30] oh Lord impersonating
[24:32] himself as an angel of
[24:36] Light think about
[24:39] it on the river of Jordan if they the
[24:42] people would have
[24:45] understood who that
[24:47] was that John introduced them
[24:53] to Hallelujah remember now John had
[24:57] disciples and he constantly preached
[24:59] that the Messiah was coming and he told
[25:02] them that when he does come I will
[25:06] know because the Bible he he said I've
[25:08] had a vision let's put it this way I've
[25:10] seen the dove of God laying upon Him
[25:14] Hallelujah and the Bible said when Jesus
[25:17] came to the river of Jordan oh John said
[25:21] oh my God you would come to be baptized
[25:24] of
[25:25] me I'm not even worthy to unlash your
[25:29] shoes but then Jesus being the word says
[25:33] this must be
[25:35] done because all of the scriptures must
[25:38] be done and the lamb had to be
[25:43] washed yes sir before he could be
[25:47] sacrificed Hallelujah so we realize amen
[25:51] that if they only knew that this
[25:55] face wasn't the first time it ever
[25:57] appeared
[26:00] on
[26:01] Earth I'd say that in just a
[26:04] moment John
[26:09] amen was a a a a a mighty
[26:14] one so much so that Jesus said there
[26:17] have never been a prophet like unto John
[26:21] up until this
[26:23] day but that was that
[26:26] day and some people may not may have
[26:28] disagree with me but there's been a
[26:31] greater than John since
[26:35] then John the Baptist was a covenant
[26:39] Angel and John
[26:42] Elijah is a covenant
[26:45] Angel not only is this Elijah of our day
[26:48] was a covenant Angel but he was the one
[26:51] that God uses to perform the
[26:55] ceremony what ceremony a marriage
[27:01] ceremony he was the one that introduced
[27:04] like Isaac did Rebecca to excuse me that
[27:08] uh uh Ela re introduced Rebecca unto
[27:15] Isaac he was the in
[27:18] between see we would the know Isaac
[27:22] except uh elear came after us come on
[27:26] somebody he came looking for you am you
[27:30] didn't look for this message this
[27:32] message came looking for
[27:36] you beholding his
[27:39] face I wondered like I said why they
[27:43] were attacking the cloud and I've told
[27:45] you my testimony I don't know what my
[27:47] age was but was in the 60s E I remember
[27:51] that and and here was a white man com in
[27:53] my neighborhood with the Life Magazine I
[27:57] was
[28:00] child I didn't KN I knew nothing much
[28:03] about God but this man came and and like
[28:06] I said before he was a white man which
[28:09] the only white man that came in a black
[28:11] neighborhood at that time was the
[28:13] insurance man and the
[28:15] Milkman any other man would get Jack up
[28:19] jack up
[28:22] uh beat
[28:25] up so and everybody knew if it was a
[28:28] thing when a when an insurance man got
[28:30] ready to quit he made sure he brought
[28:32] the man who was going to take his place
[28:34] with him so that you would know this man
[28:36] is taking my
[28:38] place the word would get out y'all
[28:41] understand me so Milkman too I say all
[28:44] of that to say I don't know who this man
[28:48] was one of these old days I know
[28:53] him and I'll be honest with you sometime
[28:55] I wonder was that brother Brandon the
[28:58] reason why I say that and not to glorify
[29:01] myself because he preached in South
[29:03] Carolina
[29:05] Colombia at an Assembly of God Church
[29:09] there could have been somebody inspired
[29:12] all I know is this man was dressed in a
[29:14] black suit white shirt and dark I just
[29:16] know I remember that but my point is we
[29:19] were playing kick football me and some
[29:21] brothers friends and thise this man came
[29:26] and he had the magazine in his hand he
[29:28] said come here boys I want to show you
[29:30] something he said the Lord is soon to
[29:33] come well I was raised Baptist I knew a
[29:36] little something and and and he says
[29:38] listen the Lord is soon to come he said
[29:41] I want to show you and he opened the
[29:43] Light magazine Amen to the
[29:46] cloud he said can't you see his face in
[29:49] the clouds none of the other boys could
[29:51] see it wow amen I said I can see it I
[29:55] see it that man closed the book he said
[29:58] not not one word other than he closed
[30:01] the book and walked away and I never
[30:03] seen that man again and I never seen
[30:06] that magazine again until I came to this
[30:09] messag
[30:12] amen see so I know when they began to
[30:15] attack that and said some kind of
[30:18] science see what I mean science always
[30:20] trying to take the place of God you know
[30:23] I don't care about quantum physics
[30:26] Hallelujah without the word
[30:28] amen quantum physics would not have
[30:30] existed amen so anyway you look at these
[30:34] things and you say oh what are you
[30:35] talking about Brother Bruce I'm saying
[30:37] when when when when when brother Chris
[30:39] began to speak on that picture I began
[30:42] to see things I've never seen
[30:46] before and you know I thought that's
[30:49] right face to
[30:52] face face to face see but if you can't
[30:56] see the face in peace am then you're not
[31:00] part of the
[31:01] picture amen that's what God said to me
[31:05] he said if you I said it again right
[31:08] there he said if you cannot see this
[31:11] picture this face in peace you are not
[31:14] part of the
[31:19] picture
[31:21] Hallelujah and I thought what and then
[31:23] the brother said listen which is true I
[31:25] never saw it like this before he said
[31:28] the Angels were just the outside of the
[31:31] p and I have seen that
[31:35] picture I'mma show it to you right now
[31:38] this picture
[31:40] now and in this picture you can see faet
[31:47] Amen in the makeup of this Frame seven
[31:52] angels oh come on somebody Hallelujah
[31:55] there are faces in this picture and when
[31:58] I I used to see it all the time I said
[32:00] oh I see this I see that oh look at that
[32:02] face look at this face and not
[32:05] realizing that what God was doing is not
[32:07] only just showing you who he is but who
[32:10] he's made up
[32:15] of without us hallelujah amen that's why
[32:19] they can't be made perfect amen we had
[32:22] both eyes we had Paul we had uh H
[32:26] William Bradley amen right amen come on
[32:30] somebody amen the truth of the matter is
[32:33] oh my God thank you brother didn't even
[32:35] know the truth of the matter is every
[32:40] Paul and and and and and William Bram
[32:42] was the only two prophets amen they were
[32:46] seers Hallelujah yes but after the seers
[32:50] go off the scene you go into God's
[32:52] intelligence
[32:54] amen oh my God Amen see see that's why
[32:59] God had to bring us a word to do what
[33:01] renew our
[33:03] minds bring us back into his
[33:07] intelligence and not the
[33:11] intelligence of a
[33:13] man this is why brother Brandon
[33:15] constantly
[33:17] said I am a son of
[33:20] man revealing the son of man now I'm off
[33:24] my notes but I'm going off what what I
[33:27] what God listen so you look and I
[33:29] thought that's right brother brandham
[33:31] I've heard him say I was looking for
[33:32] that quot couldn't remember where it was
[33:34] brother brandham said amen that this one
[33:36] that stood in the midst of the golden
[33:38] candlesticks were
[33:41] likened unto the son of man and he said
[33:45] it was the bride amen well I seen it I
[33:49] remember seeing it years ago I couldn't
[33:50] F figure out where it was then brother
[33:53] Chris show I said oh my god I've been
[33:55] looking for it because you know if you
[33:56] go into the search if you put it just
[33:58] right it just won't come
[34:01] up but when he
[34:04] said Eve was in the image of
[34:08] Adam I did everything but jumped out of
[34:10] my
[34:11] seat cuz now I can see is that right
[34:15] listen the prophet of God says she
[34:17] becomes him it brings us back to one
[34:21] image amen not the image of a woman but
[34:24] the image of a man and now she's in him
[34:27] and that's how come we saw Adam
[34:30] alone amen that's why on Mount Tri
[34:33] Transfiguration you didn't see male and
[34:35] female you saw Jesus only Hallelujah but
[34:40] we were there oh God W help us Lord
[34:44] that's why Paul said my life is hid in
[34:48] Christ
[34:50] Jesus I don't want my life to be
[34:53] seen I wanted to die everything about me
[34:57] Must Die it must R Hallelujah I want to
[35:01] be able to stand like Paul said it's not
[35:03] I that lives but Christ that lives in
[35:08] me I'm on my way up folks not down I'm
[35:12] on my way up and I tell you what I
[35:15] thought that oh this last few days was a
[35:19] battle of oh my God you know and Satan
[35:23] said you know you're not going to win
[35:24] you might as well just give up I'm like
[35:26] give up on what
[35:29] you know the devil he run he talk too
[35:31] much you know I mean he goes along and
[35:34] you're listening almost some somewhat
[35:36] right but he always make the mistake of
[35:38] saying the wrong thing amen and then
[35:41] when he says what he says like that like
[35:43] he told the prophet of God just give up
[35:44] God don't care see what I'm saying when
[35:46] he went
[35:47] there I said you Expos now devil
[35:51] Hallelujah I know this is you glory to
[35:54] God y'all hear what I'm saying because
[35:56] I'm going tell you something in all my
[35:58] suffering in all my trials and all that
[36:01] I've ever gone through he's the only one
[36:04] has ever been there
[36:08] perfectly he was there when I wasn't
[36:10] there y'all understand what I mean so
[36:13] you look at this thing you say well
[36:14] brother Brooks how come listen it was so
[36:18] important that people understood who
[36:21] knowah was because only eight Souls
[36:23] caught the
[36:24] Revelation right and the Bible tells us
[36:27] that Jesus himself after he was
[36:29] crucified went down into the region of
[36:32] the lost and preached to the souls that
[36:34] were in
[36:35] prison in the days of what the anel
[36:37] luian days what was it they missed the
[36:41] son of man they missed God they missed
[36:44] the face of God because they saw Noah's
[36:48] face but it wasn't Noah preaching it was
[36:52] God in Noah
[36:55] preaching and they met miss
[36:59] it that's why they couldn't see Jesus
[37:02] they were looking too much at his face
[37:05] but his face will either Enlighten you
[37:08] or blind
[37:11] you Hallelujah come on somebody and the
[37:15] same face that we have seen in 1963 when
[37:19] God took it and listen brother Brandon
[37:22] said he was looking right at the
[37:25] thief that he pardoned
[37:28] am Hallelujah come on somebody and God
[37:32] comes in that same way and he looks down
[37:35] us that's why Moses said
[37:37] Lord these people you brought out of
[37:39] Egypt don't slay them they're full of
[37:43] mistakes Lord but have mercy on
[37:47] them have mercy otherwise the people
[37:50] going to mock us and say the god that
[37:53] they so-called serve has now killed them
[37:56] all amen
[37:59] is that right that would be the pressure
[38:02] of the foolish virgin y'all say you're
[38:04] Christians and look God done left
[38:09] you the Bible says according to Exodus
[38:12] 33:11 and the Lord spake unto Moses face
[38:15] to face as a man speaketh unto his
[38:18] friend and he turned again into the camp
[38:21] but his servant Joshua the son of nun a
[38:25] young man departed out out of the
[38:29] Tabernacle
[38:31] Hallelujah W come on somebody now what
[38:36] is it about his face I often know listen
[38:39] character is known by a person's
[38:44] face most of the
[38:47] time you can find some who can deceive
[38:50] you but most of the time you could look
[38:53] at a man you could either tell where he
[38:54] come from where he is and perhaps where
[38:56] he's going
[38:58] you ever seen somebody that's
[39:01] mean you don't even have to talk to them
[39:04] it's just that their face gives them
[39:07] away you look she look mean and nine
[39:12] time out of 10 she
[39:15] is oh it doesn't matter how nice they
[39:17] can be on the surface but when you push
[39:20] or switch that switch and me then you'll
[39:23] see oh I see why she looks like that
[39:27] right it is that character that
[39:29] dominating thing that pushes through
[39:32] some of us got
[39:35] scars but scars do tell where you used
[39:38] to
[39:41] be you can't get rid of it's engraved in
[39:45] your flesh now my point is if God is
[39:49] able to I can I put it this way see God
[39:53] can take all of that and transform it
[39:56] amen so much so that people won't even
[39:59] see your scars they'll see the
[40:00] illumination of the Holy
[40:03] Spirit Hallelujah come on somebody
[40:06] listen he said hide not thy face from me
[40:10] this what psalms 27 says when thou sayth
[40:13] seek my face my heart said unto thee thy
[40:17] face Lord will I
[40:21] seek what was he saying I'm going to
[40:23] seek his character amen
[40:27] Hallelujah come on somebody I'm going to
[40:30] seek his face Hallelujah because Jesus
[40:33] said when you see me you see the father
[40:37] he wasn't talking about this Paul said
[40:39] we no longer know man after the flesh we
[40:43] don't even know Jesus Christ after the
[40:45] flesh we don't know William bradam after
[40:48] the flesh come on somebody it ain't
[40:51] about wearing Bel buckles and cowboy
[40:53] shoes and hats it's character it's what
[40:57] was reflected through him that God was
[41:00] reflecting to us amen that we might
[41:05] see Hallelujah is that true amen oh
[41:08] absolutely remember amen the Bible tells
[41:11] us that in the day I think it was
[41:13] Nebuchadnezzar who built the
[41:16] image belzar Nebuchadnezzar whichever
[41:19] one it was but they were they were
[41:22] Phar Kings or pharaohs or whatever you
[41:25] call them but my point is they built an
[41:28] image to Daniel Amen how would we have
[41:31] known that image was the image of a
[41:35] prophet and that Prophet was Daniel the
[41:39] man thought so much of Daniel he thought
[41:41] Daniel was God and he wanted the people
[41:45] to worship the image of Daniel and
[41:47] Daniel himself would not
[41:49] bow Hallelujah the same pressure that we
[41:53] get from message people that wants us to
[41:55] bow down to the enies of William Bram
[41:58] amen because they think he's God but
[42:02] it's not the image that we're looking at
[42:06] amen we are seeing a image that God has
[42:09] brought through the
[42:11] man amen oh come on
[42:17] somebody he's taking us
[42:19] higher Lord don't worry about your false
[42:22] folks listen not one of us can make
[42:24] ourselves perfect you can't make
[42:27] yourself bride bride has already been
[42:30] chosen and if you believe that you're
[42:33] bride you completely you keep believing
[42:35] that and you keep believing like Abraham
[42:38] I don't care how bad it looks to me in
[42:40] my life he promised me Perfection he
[42:44] promised me a son and I'm going to have
[42:46] that
[42:47] son conditions in your life right now
[42:50] means nothing it is the promise that God
[42:53] has given unto us that we must look at
[42:56] amen the devil will get you looking at
[42:58] how bad a condition you're in and you
[43:01] can't make it he's a liar from the
[43:04] beginning how you can't make it when
[43:06] you're already
[43:09] there you ought to say yeah devil but
[43:11] you can't make
[43:13] it he trying to tell you what you can't
[43:16] do right so you say well what do you
[43:18] mean this is what was so beautiful
[43:20] nobody know before we just start oh in a
[43:24] twinkling of an eye we going to be
[43:26] caught up to meet
[43:28] him that's all oh I'm a Christian and so
[43:31] I confess the Lord and no matter what
[43:33] I'm going to be caught up to meet him
[43:36] and we forget that the scripture said
[43:37] the Bride made herself ready Hallelujah
[43:42] come on somebody that is a process and
[43:44] that process we know because God showed
[43:48] his
[43:50] face thank you Lord and gave us
[43:53] instructions and entrance into what his
[43:55] divine nature
[43:57] amen I got to go back there because
[43:59] without the divine nature you go nowhere
[44:02] amen am it's his divine
[44:08] nature look what brother R says he says
[44:11] see the picture the other day how he
[44:14] turned that picture sideways there let
[44:16] me tell you something this Bible is not
[44:19] a history book even though history is in
[44:21] it it's not all history it's not
[44:24] something of the past people say oh I
[44:26] want to live in the Bible days you are
[44:28] in the Bible days I want to tell you
[44:30] where you are you are in the Book of
[44:35] Revelations y'all hear me oh with the
[44:37] Book of Revelation yes because remember
[44:40] brother bandam said after the seventh
[44:42] angel message sound he said immediately
[44:46] the Rapture take place and I was saying
[44:48] that to my wife I said how long is
[44:50] immediately God knows we've spent a lot
[44:53] of time in that word so we're closer to
[44:56] it yes sir than we ever have
[44:59] been this is why God preaching what he
[45:01] preaching these are not my thoughts
[45:04] these are his thoughts God is looking
[45:07] for character he's looking for somebody
[45:09] amen who's
[45:11] willing to press through all of this
[45:13] stuff
[45:15] amen but how you going to do it if you
[45:17] don't identify the devil if you don't
[45:20] know the devil you and I know everything
[45:22] about what we need to know about the
[45:24] devil cuz he runs the same scheme on us
[45:27] every
[45:28] time he doesn't come a second way
[45:30] another way he runs the same tactics and
[45:33] we need to start writing down how how he
[45:36] works with us and gets us to a place of
[45:38] Temptation or gets us to a place of
[45:41] falling amen he ain't GNA change his
[45:44] ways he knows how to do it and one of
[45:47] the first thing he does is make you feel
[45:54] alone lonelyness
[45:57] Hallelujah he caught Eve
[46:00] alone and that's how he catches you and
[46:03] us when we feel alone that's why Jesus
[46:07] said you're never alone I'm always with
[46:09] you yes Lord so it got to be the devil
[46:12] that makes us feel that way amen huh and
[46:16] that's his look if you listen all of a
[46:18] sudden you're end up
[46:20] fellowshipping with the wrong Shepherd y
[46:24] amen y'all hear what I'm saying now let
[46:27] me move on he says listen see the
[46:29] picture the other day how it turned that
[46:31] picture sideways there and the Very
[46:34] picture of the Seven Angels being lifted
[46:37] up tur it on to the right side and there
[46:39] is the face of the Lord Jesus looking
[46:42] down to the Earth
[46:45] again who was the face of Jesus you said
[46:48] brother Brooks I told you earlier I said
[46:50] that face had been seen before and I
[46:53] ain't going to read all of it but I'm
[46:54] going tell you something that face had
[46:57] to be the same face that MDC
[47:01] had he was made after the order of MDC
[47:05] if I had a tith detergent in a certain
[47:09] box with a certain label and I made one
[47:12] after the order of that it would be the
[47:15] same tied box with the same writing with
[47:18] the same everything you say that can't
[47:20] be true well I'll tell you what Ezekiel
[47:22] said after the the Bible the Bible tells
[47:25] us that Jesus sended into the low region
[47:29] right and there he said he led captivity
[47:33] captive is that right now we realize one
[47:38] thingl is that when he descended and
[47:41] brother brandham D
[47:45] dramatizing he knocked on the door of
[47:47] paradise Abraham comes and he looks
[47:50] through the
[47:51] people he said that's the
[47:54] one amen
[47:57] come on somebody he was able to
[47:59] recognize his
[48:01] face he said that's the one I seen Amen
[48:05] in the cool of the that's the one amen
[48:09] Ezekiel said oh my God that's the one I
[48:13] see he was the will in the middle of the
[48:16] wh see they
[48:19] identified who he
[48:24] was Lord hello
[48:27] J said that's the one I see when I was
[48:31] on the a he oh
[48:37] Lord you see what I'm saying so when
[48:40] Jesus was made Jesus he took on the
[48:44] order of
[48:45] mzc even though the body
[48:48] itself wasn't mzc his life his eternal
[48:52] life he was born with being God
[48:59] amen now many of us may may not be able
[49:02] to see it but all I know
[49:04] is that we are in the face of God amen
[49:09] amen hallelujah it's amazing because it
[49:13] doesn't matter on how he cloaks
[49:18] himself he cloaked himself and here he
[49:21] was God of imorph going down to a woman
[49:25] at the well amen see the seed of God
[49:28] will always recognize him no matter what
[49:31] he looks
[49:33] like she said we know when the Messiah
[49:36] come he's going to tell us these things
[49:38] amen and then when he said I am he
[49:40] listen it was one of the few times Jesus
[49:44] told his the person whom he was talking
[49:46] with I am
[49:50] he
[49:52] amen and she ran to the city and said
[49:55] come see a man
[49:57] who told me everything that I know all
[50:00] about
[50:01] me what was it she didn't see the a man
[50:05] dirty with dirty clothes on and she
[50:08] didn't see a man perhaps look worn out
[50:11] she saw Behind the B amen she recognized
[50:16] this got to be God
[50:21] Amen y'all hear what I'm saying what is
[50:24] it beholding him face to face you got to
[50:27] go beyond the veil of William Bram and
[50:29] see who was behind that then you'll have
[50:33] respect for the word you'll have respect
[50:36] for the message sir because you'll
[50:38] understand the message wasn't brought by
[50:39] a man it was brought by God
[50:44] Amen
[50:47] Hallelujah he said listen oh he said
[50:50] them Church agents he said I can
[50:52] understand why Jesus standing there with
[50:55] he said I couldn't understand while
[50:57] Jesus was there amen with a white white
[51:01] uh over his head and he was a young man
[51:03] I I look took it back to the Bible see
[51:07] what was it God impersonating himself or
[51:10] put it this I I get there when I get
[51:12] there you said well no God doesn't yes
[51:13] he does he impersonate himself through
[51:18] you thank you
[51:20] Lord remember brother BR talk about the
[51:23] drama and how God acts things out
[51:27] he does and he act himself out through
[51:31] US amen I got a quote for that
[51:35] too see he goes on and he says listen
[51:39] standing Jesus standing there with a
[51:41] white over his head he was a young man I
[51:44] took it back in the Bible and it says he
[51:47] came to the Ancient of Days whose hair
[51:49] was white as wo Jesus was only 33 and a
[51:54] half years old at his crucifix
[51:57] so he had to act out
[51:59] or impersonate the judge who he really
[52:03] was
[52:06] amen
[52:09] hallelujah that sounded all right for
[52:12] Theologian see wait wait wait wait wait
[52:14] let me go back up he said Ancient of
[52:16] Days whose hair was white as will Jesus
[52:17] was only 33 and a half years old at his
[52:20] crucifixion I called up brother dck
[52:22] Moore Theologian he said oh brother
[52:24] Brandon that's Jesus in his glorified
[52:26] stage said after his death burial and
[52:29] Resurrection he turned to that that
[52:30] sounded all right for a theologian but
[52:32] it didn't go good it didn't hit that
[52:35] something and I went up there and I
[52:37] started on the first church age there
[52:39] the Holy Spirit revealed it now you got
[52:42] it right on your church agents I guess
[52:44] the books will be out pretty soon now uh
[52:47] uh the full details of it and it shows
[52:49] that Jesus was judged there's a white
[52:51] wig that they used to wear put a wig on
[52:55] and wear it as a Jud
[52:57] England still does it when you got
[52:59] supreme
[53:00] authority come on somebody what was it
[53:03] that's why the scripture said he was the
[53:05] only potent
[53:07] C it wasn't brother Brandon's face with
[53:09] a a wig on
[53:12] it it was the hin
[53:15] head it was Christ and right now people
[53:19] are now trying to say he all counter
[53:20] colors now who cares about what color he
[53:23] is
[53:28] he'd be porked and striped to me I don't
[53:30] care I still want to see him and then
[53:32] look at his face a million and more
[53:34] years just look at
[53:38] him oh Jesus which was the listen let me
[53:43] go on see there he is with them Angels
[53:47] the message which was the SE seven
[53:49] breaking of them Seven Seals that reveal
[53:52] serpent seed and all these things and it
[53:54] showed that it is H his very covering
[53:59] the seven angels was his very
[54:03] covering
[54:05] hallelujah oh my
[54:08] God it's supreme authority he is supreme
[54:13] and he is wigged or covered the Bible
[54:15] said that he changed his countenance or
[54:18] he changed himself in morphe the word
[54:21] comes from the word Greek word IM Mor
[54:24] which means a Greek Act
[54:27] that plays many parts today he is one
[54:30] thing and in the next ACT he is
[54:32] something else he was God the father and
[54:36] in one act God the son in another act
[54:39] then God the Holy Ghost in This act see
[54:43] there he is his word is still Supreme
[54:46] and he's living in the last
[54:49] days hallelujah Ecclesiastes 8 And1 says
[54:53] who is as a wise man and who knoweth the
[54:57] interpretation of a thing a man's Wisdom
[55:00] maketh his face to shine and boldness of
[55:03] his face shall be
[55:06] chained what you say Moses the wisdom of
[55:11] God overtook Moses so much his face did
[55:18] Shine and when God's wisdom takes you
[55:22] over there is a glorious shine about you
[55:26] now you don't see many Christians with
[55:28] that kind of shine anymore but there are
[55:30] those who do have it Hallelujah listen
[55:34] Psalms 34 is this okay Psalm 34:1 16-19
[55:39] says the face of the Lord is against
[55:41] them that do evil to cut off the
[55:44] remembrance of them from the
[55:46] earth is that right he was looking at
[55:49] the thief that he was going to Pardon
[55:52] but the one that he wasn't going to
[55:54] Pardon he didn't look that way amen
[55:57] hallelujah so God's facei is against
[56:00] those who do evil the righteous God
[56:04] that's why people don't understand it
[56:06] they attack the cloud not understanding
[56:09] the face of God and because of that amen
[56:13] God will turn his face from
[56:19] them the Lord is nigh unto them that are
[56:22] of a broken heart and save such as be of
[56:25] a right Spirit many are the Affliction
[56:29] of the righteous but the Lord delivered
[56:32] him out of them
[56:35] all Hallelujah beholding his faith you
[56:39] so brother was what I'm going to do I
[56:41] don't understand how people go back to
[56:42] these other churches I just
[56:46] don't I
[56:49] don't what the highest form of truth
[56:52] right now outside of this message is the
[56:54] Pentecostal move and look look where
[56:56] they are
[57:00] now IAB bar all over the place and you
[57:03] know what if the people in this message
[57:05] are not careful that same thing is going
[57:08] to be written over them too see because
[57:10] everything that came out of Egypt was
[57:12] not Israel amen
[57:15] amen amen and everything that come out
[57:17] of denominations praise God is Not bride
[57:23] amen help us Lord woo you got to have a
[57:27] spirit like uh Joshua and
[57:29] Caleb Hallelujah you didn't see Moses
[57:32] the man you saw God behind the
[57:38] ve and brother brandham said this butt
[57:41] ain't no
[57:42] butts it is the prophet of God that
[57:45] interprets God or God interprets his
[57:47] word through the prophet amen Amen
[57:51] brother B say you don't even have a
[57:52] thought
[57:54] coming first Corin Ians 13: 8-13 listen
[57:58] charity never fails but whether there be
[58:01] prophecies they shall fail whether there
[58:03] be tongues they shall cease whether
[58:06] there be knowledge it shall vanish come
[58:08] on somebody we've seen it we've seen the
[58:11] watch of the holy spirit amen among
[58:14] people but they had no
[58:18] charity for we know in part we prophesy
[58:21] in part but when that which is perfect
[58:23] is come then that which is part shall be
[58:27] done away listen God allowed us to get
[58:30] away with part of it but that which is
[58:33] perfect has come which God has now
[58:35] delivered to us through the prophet of
[58:37] God he's looking for a perfect
[58:42] man
[58:43] Hallelujah am I making sense Peter said
[58:46] amen if we do all of these things we
[58:49] shall never fall nor be un baren so the
[58:53] Perfection of of of what God is looking
[58:56] for is not your own abilities it's God
[59:00] in you amen which is a hope of glory oh
[59:04] so many people around this message amen
[59:06] what they don't understand the prophet
[59:07] God said listen the devil can get you
[59:10] off on just the least little thing he
[59:12] got
[59:13] you because remember it was people who
[59:16] not only identified brother brandom as a
[59:18] prophet but they went on to worship
[59:21] him where you think they're going
[59:23] brother brandom said when you worship me
[59:25] you make me
[59:29] Antichrist
[59:31] amen hallelujah so it doesn't make see
[59:34] the devil don't care it's just one
[59:36] little one little Mis
[59:43] mishap

[59:47] one and people don't understand they
[59:50] well brother BRS what what are you what

[1:00:01] power in this this is a reflection of
[1:00:04] him oh Hallelujah you don't want this
[1:00:07] reflection you want him

[1:00:12] a a messy sin because I don't have it
[1:00:15] hanging up I will in due
[1:00:21] time but I'm sure not going to put it up
[1:00:23] because somebody else want me to put it
[1:00:24] up y'all understand me they do that but

[1:00:31] him he's in
[1:00:36] me people come in I tell you what it's
[1:00:38] just the way people are taught they
[1:00:40] think something really spiritual about
[1:00:42] it you know what I mean St you I'll be
[1:00:44] you be people probably bowing down just
[1:00:47] like they did to the serpent on the pole
[1:00:55] [Music]
[1:00:57] y'all hear what I'm
[1:01:00] saying Paul warned us about those kind
[1:01:02] of things
[1:01:05] folks that's what I love brother Brandon
[1:01:07] for he was not so super spiritual that
[1:01:10] he didn't act act like a man or be a man
[1:01:13] amen that's what's so beautiful about
[1:01:15] this message brother Brandon went
[1:01:17] fishing he went hunting he laughed he
[1:01:19] joked he carried on just like men do
[1:01:23] amen he didn't ride where no wife robe a
[1:01:26] man like the Catholic priest like you
[1:01:28] got to bow down and kiss my hand
[1:01:31] no he was just a
[1:01:34] man who God
[1:01:38] used not only that guess what he made
[1:01:41] mistakes amen
[1:01:45] hello and you know what he didn't hide
[1:01:47] it he put it on record so you can see he
[1:01:51] was a man
[1:01:56] yes sir oh help us Lord Paul said when I
[1:02:00] was a child I spake as a child I
[1:02:03] understood as a child I thought as a
[1:02:05] child but when I became a man I put away
[1:02:08] childish thing yes watch children play
[1:02:12] they play one moment they mad one moment
[1:02:14] they lie on each other they cheat on
[1:02:16] each other they do all kind of stuff why
[1:02:18] they're
[1:02:19] children but when you grow up those
[1:02:22] things that were things that you did as
[1:02:24] a child must move out way amen what what
[1:02:27] you think Paul talking about he's not
[1:02:30] talking about growing up amen naturally
[1:02:32] he's working with a spiritual
[1:02:34] application yes sir

[1:07:04] you gonna suffer am oh me s yes Divine
[1:07:08] love came by way of Jesus Christ and he
[1:07:10] did what suffer amen but the Bible said

[1:07:15] righteous but God delivered them out of
[1:07:18] all of
[1:07:19] them you love the Lord well by God's
[1:07:23] grace we'll start with part

[1:07:46] Blueprints and by that blueprint that
[1:07:48] man can see exactly what he's working
[1:07:51] with right right and normally amen he
[1:07:54] can read those plans and constructed
[1:07:57] exactly the way it is there now of
[1:08:00] course the building is bigger than the
[1:08:02] blueprint but without the blueprint
[1:08:04] there would be no building right so what
[1:08:07] did God do he brought a man uh filled
[1:08:11] with the spirit of Elijah which was the
[1:08:12] spirit of God the Holy Ghost and laid
[1:08:15] out the
