Dorsey's give allah [Music] Oh [Music] I want you to say like you these are Oh in the name of I just like rubbing that in the devil's face he can rage all he want to he is defeated totally defeated as we stand we're gonna go right into the word of God god bless each and every one of you we have been dealing with the subject of preparing for a new world it is absolutely in plain view we can see the prophecies being fulfilled right before our eyes excuse me and we're so grateful that we have been chosen by God we didn't choose him he chose us and I am so grateful tonight that God knows how to preserve the soul you don't preserve your soul it is God who has preserved your soul is that right it is God who has kept this secret from the foundation of the world he put our names in the Lamb's Book of Life he hid us there but now that book has been opened it is now time for the manifestations of the sons of God the whole of creation have known and groaned and still do until the sons of God is made manifest understand when the sons of God gets in their place then the world would get in their place things will change they talk about a new order a new order is coming ha ha ha but it's not according to the way they think it is according to the way God has thought is that all right you and I we want you to turn by God's grace we realize like I said we're living in the last days God is recreating and I'm glad to be a part of that creation I'm so glad to see that I am in a process that cannot be stopped it cannot be hindered because God said that he had begun the good work in us is faithful to complete it you and I must understand we did not come here by choice if I could say it like this God dropped us in to this dimension hello and you and I must understand that before that happened a choice was made you may not remember it but the choice was made just like God made the choice of Calvary he decided that kalbarri was the best way to do it he made that choice and he came and fulfilled that choice and so therefore God gave us a choice and because we qu chose Amen to follow Jesus then we are now following him now this is not some coincident this is not something where we can think that well I just think that you know we came here by chance but I want to tell you that we you did not come here by chance God for ordained each and every one of us and I'm just so happy to be one of his I was telling her brother the other day I could have been a lot of things and you know but I'm so glad he didn't make me Judas and that has turned to second Thessalonians 2 the brother said I've never heard that before but I tell you what mighty men have come and gone but what makes a man mighty and when he can submit to the will of God Moses was the meekest man outside of Christ but the meekness was not weakness the meekness was that he was able to follow the leadership of what we call the pillar of fire 2nd Thessalonians 2 we're gonna read a couple of passage of Scripture because we're living in the last days can you we're living in the last days and you and I must ask God to give us vision you know Jesus told us in order to escape the wrath that is to come we much watch and pray watch and pray and I find out that a lot of people watch but they don't pray but you must watch and pray that God will account you worthy to escape a lot of people don't see it they really think the world is gonna continue on the way it is going somebody might even think we got another 100 I don't believe it I can't imagine it and I'm so glad if we do have another hundred within that hundred I'll be gone it is a fact that if the generations that was before us because just catch a vision of what the America has become they would die from a heart attack Daniel saw the end time and the Bible said he got so sick I forgot how many days he was on his bed just sick because he could not imagine a man who was created in God's image that he would become so perverted and things would get so loose where men would actually lose their identity and they would forget who they are and we're living in that day second Thessalonians 2 one two three now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto Him see when you come the church you're not gathering unto me you're gathering unto Him if you have the Holy Spirit you are gathering unto Christ right so you understand that if I'm under the anointing of God it's not me that speak but God through me I'm just a veil and I tried my best to prepare myself to be able to move out of his way so that he can speak just not a preacher and not a theologian but a son of God that has been ordained by God to preach and so you must understand that if you come here and you said well brother Brooks preach the good message you missed and you did not recognize the presence of God it is it either it is or it is not but something gathers you something pulls you together amen to hear the word and the Bible tells us where the caucus is there were the Eagles be gathered we are gathered together unto him that ye be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that day of Christ is at hand now you must understand this letter was written almost 2,000 years ago but now we are at the end time so that you will know the Bible says that the day a day with the Lord is as a thousand years and a thousand years is as a day is that right the first two thousand years came the flood Noah right the second two thousand years Jesus Christ hallelujah amen the third two thousand years came the son of man come on we're at the end time hallelujah because the Bible tells us when the Son of Man comes shall he find faith in the earth not some other kind of faith but his faith not religion not denominations not organisations but the faith of God hallelujah and the only way you can have the faith of God you must have God on the inside because the Bible said that the just shall live by his faith people say don't give me that whole it goes where you can't make heaven without it let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition so we understand they have to come a falling away this is why you see the true Church of God dwindling in size is that right oh it's the truth remember when Jesus was preaching he had multitudes of people but as that day approached for the Son of Man to reveal himself to show who he really was they were all gone matter of fact the people who he healed and delivered was their screaming crucify him crucify him the very word that brought deliverance that's how it is today the very word that brings deliverance people are saying crucify crucify it that's nonsense you all think you're the only one right well I can tell you like this Moses was the only one right nor was the only one right Jesus was the only one right I'm not right but Jesus is let's move on one more scripture second Peter the first chapter everybody can't be right here's what I'll follow the I follow the big churches come out somebody you and I must understand that Moses had the biggest church ever he had over 2 million in his church but how many of them were sincere how many of them made it to the promised land only 2 out of that great generation and that was Joshua and Caleb and Jesus said amen yes your father's did eat manna in the wilderness and yet yes they are all dead why they murmured they complain and they form organizations and denominations hello Nathan and Cora it's the same 2nd Peter 1 8 through 11 people don't even know who them what the mark of the beast is people but it is that way think it's coming no no the mark of the beast has been here for a long time and people don't understand when you choose your organization and your denomination over the word you receive the mark the same thing Cain did over Abel right second peter 1 i'm throwing a lot of things out i don't mean to but it's just what he's telling me to say 2nd peter 1 8 through 11 but if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ now you think everybody would want to know what this these things are if it's going to make me fruitful and abound i need to know what those things are because as christians we don't want to be just Christians we want to be the very reflection of Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sins is that right that's why you see so many Chris not living christian lives because they're lacking these things and they have come to a place where they are blind they're not living it because they'd forgotten where for the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure I love the scripture that means I can make my calling and election sure no doubt about it I know who I am and where I'm going for if you do these things you shall never fall you'll never disbelieve the Word of God if you do these things for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly not sparingly abundantly don't tell me what God can't do abundantly that means more than enough abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ let us pray gracious father God we thank you for your amazing grace Lord you've been good to us you've been better to us than we have been to ourselves you have delivered us so many times and you've delivered us you've given us great conquest over our own desires in our own ways father you have sealed us with your Holy Spirit and father I pray tonight if there be any in the house that don't know you that haven't experienced the joy of heaven that your grace will be with them tonight that you will touch them and give them a hunger for you Lord that they will never stop until that hunger it's fulfilled and quenched bless us now bless each and every heart as we administer your word speak through our lips give us grace to move completely out of your way in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated as we have spoken in the past we have done about three lessons already the thing that gives me joy is to know that this world is not my home the Bible says that a man born of a woman is sure to die and you and I know that it doesn't matter how rich and famous you become it doesn't matter what kind what color your skin if you're born a man or a woman you're going to die the only thing that's going to stop death it's the blood of Jesus Christ see because when a man accept Jesus Christ as his Savior and really believe in present - the kingdom of God the Bible says doe you be dead yet shall you live and we who die in Christ we do not die it's let's put it this way as the science as we say there's another dimension there is another dimension that people do not know and they're not aware of because it's supernatural they can't pick it up on their scientific machines but it's dead right it's like television you can't pick it up with your eyes and your ears just as we are but scientists have developed machines that can pick up these sound waves in these pictures and display them before us is that right oh come on you not understand that Marilyn Monroe died in what the 60s or so and you can turn on the set and you can see Marilyn Monroe just as she lived in speaking talking acting showing that there is a dimension that we don't know of that dimension not only records you it recalls your thoughts your words your actions the clothing that you wear see if malleable road has to go before the judgement there is no way she can say I didn't do it because everything has been filmed and captured yep you understand me what scientist comes up with is something that has already been is that right Solomon said there's no new thing under the Sun hallelujah trying to say oh we believe that there is some teleporting I want you to know we did that long time ago hallelujah the Bible said Enoch walked with God and he was found not why because he was translated hello he was teleported the same Niger he meant was caught up by Chariots of Fire where did he go to another dimension see those of us who died in Christ we live we don't die we moved to another place there is a heaven and there is a hell and if you serve God you go up if you don't serve and you go down not to it but if these things be in you and you and I know what those things are Peter tells us add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge knowledge temperance temperance patient godliness brotherly kindness and the Holy Spirit which is love divine love see so when you get born again amen you just don't get born again it's just the beginning of growth hello for example when you were born a baby you didn't stay a baby can you imagine if we just kept the baby look and all we did was just grow that would look strange but we just don't grow we mature and every Son of God was born of God must mature and as we mature we much we're not just maturing into anything we're born of God so if we're going to mature we're maturing into the very image and likeness of God somebody help me here so the things that God is able to do we learn how to do them oh come on somebody you and I must understand that Jesus when he was here on earth he was God in flesh the Bible said the fullness of the Godhead bodily dwelt in him and while he was on earth he was teaching his his children his disciples things that were supernatural is that right see Jesus was a carpenter but never in the scripture you'll find out Jesus showing him how to build a natural house but he did teach them how to build spiritual houses is that right hallelujah he even came to Nicodemus as listen you Manuka demons came to him says Nicodemus you must be born again because I want you to understand they're two worlds here there's a natural there's a spiritual world you've been born into this this natural world that is your first coming hallelujah but even as Jesus has a second coming don't you realize you have a second coming that if you came from God you go back to God and while he was here amen our first coming we came natural that's what the Bible says according Corinthians coming natural man you come corruptible you're born in a house of death this is a world of death everything that's born in it dies it's just the opposite of what's on the other side there is a world where you're never done and we are preparing we who are true Christians are preparing for the world to come this is why we press like Paul said perast toward the lock of a hot colon which is in Christ Jesus it's a press it just doesn't drop in your lap you and I who have grown to to maturity we've come to an old age some of us amen and as a child we grow up and how many of us when we were 18 years old we thought we were men all right we thought we knew it hallelujah mom and dad couldn't tell us nothing but now when we get father you look back and says oh I wish I can do it over why because amen as you mature you begin to learn and you began to understand that a lot of these things you did in the way you make decisions were childish ways of doing it and that's why Paul said I put away the childish things now that I'm a man I'm doing it I'm working as a man hallelujah you love the Lord so you and I must understand scuse me you and I must understand Amen that God is bringing us to a place that we're preparing for another world people think Christianity is just a a a denomination or cult or something to do some people think it's insanity but we're the only truth you we're the only people that has sanity a lot of what people think it's insane is what I mean but we're the only one that has sanity but because we know we're going to die and we're living preparing to die so we can live is that right I'm dying to live if that makes sense I'm losing out of the way so God can live in me which I press books that's nonsense but let me ask you about this then let me this is one of the old ones but let me ask you where were you before you got here there's an answer but I mean do anybody remember when you were in your mother's womb you were there nine months if you were healthy and that world was lovely you didn't have to work all you had to do was play suck your thumb if you won't - right sometimes mama eats something that you like and you gave her a kick and said thank you and then there were times she would eat something that you didn't like and you gave her more than a kick you made her bring it back up come on so you gotta understand what in that world it was a nine months world that you lived in and you don't remember it but it's a fact that's the only way you could have gotten here hallelujah so you said well what are you saying brother looks I'm saying before you were in your mother's womb you were somewhere you don't remember it but you got here hallelujah out of the millions of germs that that your father produced you was that one in a million your birth in your selection was more supernatural than the birth of Jesus God didn't have to go through a million there was only one but the man produces a million sperms our law and many of those spawns are those seeds get to the egg before others do but only one it's predestinated only one has your code on it that's why I try to tell people if I made it then I can make it again hallelujah if I made it then I can make it again hallelujah I and you are deep predestinated to be with us we come to this earth and guess what we had a decision to make a breath or not to take a breath hello yeah I got I got something coming for you at the well but some people think wow you know this is this thing is random random nothing is random everything that happens God predestinated to be just as that hallelujah they move on so we know that as we move along the Christ and people don't understand listen people you've got to be born again in order to mature you got to be a baby in Christ in order to be a man in Christ or woman in Christ you just don't become a woman or a man some people get saving it I'm here know when you get saved at the beginning that is just the beginning and like a toddler and like one you're going to make mistakes you go far you go skinned your knee and everybody's gonna say get up get up cuz you're young but then when you get old and you start doing that people don't treat you like they used to no because they expect you to mature into a greater Christian you don't stay the same color is that right even Paul had refuses listen you'd still drinking milk when you ought to be on meat you ought to be teaching and you're still acting like babies the pastor's not gonna burp you when you are come become a certain age you learned how to burp yourself a people want all past it please this is the hour that you must grow up songs of Solomon said that God is coming back for a mature bride he's not coming back for a little girl in character she must be mature she must be like he is she must be that way Oh in order to be compatible she has to be now it's not human effort you cannot do it I can't do it but if God if you would allow God to come into you you say old brother would you time I let God come into me the Holy Ghost yeah we as soon as we allow all those other demons come in you don't say man when that smoking demon said well I want to slow you don't say nothing when that drinking demons off I want a drink if the drinking demon and the smoking demon can rule you think about what the Holy Ghost who is God can do he'll take away all of your desires to sin he'll move in your life but you got to want him more than you want your own life you got to give him all and most Christians don't want to do that they say well I give God some of my life I give him part of my life God don't want some and he don't want hard he won't oh is that right oh it's like a man in a woman when a man marry a woman he don't want just her hand am I making sense I didn't marry your hand you're my body and I'm yours come on somebody it's the truth and so it is with God God don't want your hand he don't want your mind he don't want your show feet he wants everything you can offer hallelujah hey somebody help me here Unitas understand it meant that we are on a road to a new civilization we are on our way to a new world this one is going to be destroyed don't tell me it will be it's already in the making hallelujah is that right they didn't want to believe no one his day but did it happen people still questioning that even after scientists have actually found the ark on the top of Mount Eric you know did you know motors Moses took a rope and he climbed up there with that boat no that's it nonsense that boat settled there on the top of Mount act-out rack because the Bible said it did hallelujah and how did a boat get way up there is because the waters were way up there and that's one of the highest tallest mountains in the whole entire world let scientists explain that one y'all hear me we have a prayer on our side did y'all know that jesus prayed for you hallelujah Saint John 17:20 says neither pray I for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word how can it fail how can it ever come shot when Jesus himself pray for you I accept the prayer when he prayed he pray for me hallelujah that they all may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world we believe that thou has sent me that you and I are testimonies our lives that we live is a reflection of Jesus Christ we look strange to people because they can't comprehend us because we don't do the things of the world but don't feel bad about it that's exactly what we're supposed to do we don't put it on it puts us on it comes on it is already home it's just a light that cannot go out hallelujah oh lord have mercy that all may be one is the father and me I envy that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me this is it and the glory oh glory which thou have gave me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one what is the glory of God other than the Holy Spirit because the Holy Spirit is God Himself in you hallelujah it is Elohim it is the self existing one it's your Holman IRA you over this canoe hallelujah he's God he's hauling it all in you hallelujah that's why he told his disciples you can ask whatsoever you will and it shall be given unto you you got to believe it though it can't be some kind of hair knowledge well I know the Lord save me God ain't saving you in your head God saves you in your heart that's where the throne of God is it's in your heart whew somebody help me here because I'm gonna tell you something there's a many Christians who's singing and shouting and dancing and running up and down the house and can't live one lick hallelujah and they think they're gonna make a rapture because they feel the anointing let me tell you something Judas was anointing Judas cast out Devils with the twelve hallelujah Judas preached and he was a devil hallelujah Caiaphas's prophesy under the anointing of the Holy Spirit and was a devil hello Hey all of that that's where the world have deceived the people that's where organization denomination is to see the people it is the life of Christ you say well prove me brother Paul says you have faith to move mountains you can give all you have to feed the poor hallelujah you can give your body to be burned and have not charity with His divine love which is God himself it profits you nothing hmm the people ain't doing it you know why because they don't know it these are secrets these are things that God is imparted to his ride preparing her for a kingdom to come is that right don't believe that Jesus will call me Saint John 14 he says I behold I go away I go away to prepare for you a place that where I am there you may be also that means it's there because he says is there guarding stupid let me say it like this you and I have come into this world because God chose it and guess what he fashioned it just for you if you love mountains he created those mountains yes for you Oh somebody help it's the truth if you like rivers he created those rivers just for you because he knew you would like them hallelujah come on somebody's the truth everything you see God fashioned it for you because it was supposed to be our home until Satan directed and do his his ministry he has destroyed the earth and God said he's going to destroy all who destroy the earth come on somebody y'all getting quiet on me now y'all think ha ha listen this new city this new Jerusalem don't you know it's going to be prepared prepared for you hallelujah when a man going he buys a home for his wife he he knows all the things she's like if she liked the color blue and Allah he fixed that thing up just like that so when she comes in she and heaven is gonna be just like that oh I know some of y'all like meat forget it but eating meat came by the fall hallelujah but you have something far better than that is that Alright in the new world it won't be such of a thing let me hurry up you and I must understand that when we fail this is a pest house how many I'll believe that this is a house of diseases you can catch anything that's out there because of this hallelujah you got germs and things in your body right now if the right condition with striking you catch it it is a pass house it gets on your nerve how many y'all have ever had to scratch and you couldn't reach it he torments you with it and the devil loves to see you struggle so you got to understand Amen that this is a pest house how many times Amen you want to say you know I man I forgot what I was said to say it embarrass you he he knows how to humble yeah you a sonic on you can't even remember what you're getting ready to say see he messes with us all the time but the civilization that's to come has nothing like this it's complete perfection way beyond anything you can believe it listen see there will be a civilization in the world that we're going to but it won't be this kind of a civilization see you don't mean for in the civilization we have sickness sorrow lust death everything in the civilizations is wrong but is that that civilization there would be none of these things we won't need science hallelujah science is the perversion of the original anyhow is that right remember it was after the fall when hey I'm children moved out and they began to fall on this and build this and music and all of that but before then there was a kind of canis pee around the earth and heaven and earth was joined hallelujah before the fall Adam could hear the angels singing yo y'all know y'all don't know that that's why sometimes when you get in the supernatural and God moves you into that dimension you can literally hear angels sing how many have had a witness to that uh-huh I've been in services where the angels were singing and they caught it on tape not somebody else's tape I can get it for you precious brother I hope and hope he still has it it's been so many years but we had that even if it happened here we had that happen here where the angel were singing Hallelujah is that right I'm a witness about 1213 people in this church heard them singing you say they couldn't have been an angel wouldn't higher ground I can tell you that now you would have known hallelujah science is the perversion of the original anyhow see you split the molecules you split atoms and do so and so to blow you up you take gunpowder and bang bang this kill to kill something you take the car in the kick job that the gasoline out of the earth and the materials out of the earth to loosen up the fibers so it can blow up and go down the road at 90 miles an hour and kill somebody see oh so nervous squeezing it squeezing and hurry up and we got to put pushing and taking and all it's all of the devil y'all know that and none of us think about it when you go to the mall but how many times is it so crowd you get frustrated people bumping all into you and everything else you don't know whether they trying to pickpocket you or what mr. truth it is pretty warm in here and I apologize for that the kingdom of God will not have automobiles I'm so sorry hallelujah we won't need them ask Elijah the Bible said the anointing of the Lord healed Elijah he outran the cherry hallelujah oh come on y'all believe that oh my Amen in scientists achievements no it won't have any education at all education came by the fall that's what the two I was thinking about that there's more tonight before coming out here stop it started out looking good y'all know what I'm saying get educated you need it and what has educated education done has educated the people away from God hmm they don't need him they become so smart and so intelligent they don't need God anymore we don't need miracles because we got doctors let me tell you something thousands of people are dying every day by the hand of doctors doctors okay as long as you keep them in their place but when you think that you're so smart and that's what's wrong with people they think they're so smart they think it outsmart God and that's the problem you can get your D D D LD d and don't know nothing you say brother Brooks don't say there let me let me prove it to you the Pharisees saw Jesus and called him a devil they called him Beelzebub the doctors of divinity in that day studied the Old Testament so well so when Jesus came they they were blind to who he was yet there was a prostitute at the well who didn't know nothing but she said when the Messiah shall come he should tell us these things [Music] he didn't she never called him a devil she recognized who he was and when he said I am he she read to the city and said come see a man who told me all the other things about myself is this not the Messiah who see that don't make you closer to God matter of fact most of those people don't even believe in God they don't even believe that that Jesus was born virgin boy I know what I'm talking about many of my friends just dropped out of theology because of that help us Lord God is simple God is simple and the only way to understand God you must become simple it is not the downgrading education I think God for that but when your education rules out God and the supernatural it's bad as well put it away and get on your knees see God has secrets y'all understand that I'm trying to hurry God has secrets and most of the time his secrets blinds the world hello they said tell us Jesus tell us plainly who you are remember that they questioned him who are you who give you that your authority we heard that you was born of fornication because Mary and Joseph were married hallelujah but tell us who who gives you this authority jesus said okay since you're gonna play this game I'm gonna play it with you John was he of God or was he of the devil and they gathered together near communica Council and they began to think now if we say that John was of the devil these people are hitting on stone us but if we say that he is of God then he's going to ask you ask us why didn't you follow him and so they came with a wise conclusion they said Lord we cannot tell and then Jesus I like it he says I can't tell you either hallelujah I love that cuk not smart God you can't outsmart him he's already got it he's far ahead of who is this ok listen and his secrets listen people cannot understand how God could be in Christ and Christ can be in God they can't understand that God is one and not three three divine the station but is one God one Holy Spirit hallelujah father in creation son in Redemption and the Holy Ghost today hallelujah God unfolding himself Oh somebody help me here now you and I we are preparing ourselves we are rising up in character we can't just say well praise the Lord I got fir virtue I could pray for the sick and there get healed that ain't all it you got to come to knowledge and your knowledge must make one statement he is God he that cometh to God must first believe that he is God and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently camp if you don't know that Jesus Christ is God your knowledge is of no value ah because once you know he's God I can ask you a question is there anything too hard for God God can do anything let me hurry up don't you know God supersedes for his own children he super sees his own law what do you mean God has laws when you die you're going to rot is that right when a podiatrist that dies rots hallelujah but God can superseded hallelujah Mary said Lord don't you know that has been dead for four days he's rotted he's thinking and you want us to open the grave he said I said if you believe you're gonna see I am the resurrection hallelujah oh I feel like shouting because you got to understand when it comes to you God with supersedeas law he will go beyond that's why I see you can't put God in a box you can't put him in about teeth go beyond that the Bible said he is knowledge is far beyond whatsoever we ask or think we can't imagine what he can do because it can go beyond your imaginations hallelujah is there anything too hard for God hallelujah let's blow up and let's say he is God that's the thing that I love it meant that God took one man and superseded right he conquered him in Egypt by one man one man Moses and Egypt was just like Russia or bigger hallelujah but one man would have stick in his hand with the orders from God with down the Pharaohs that Pharaoh let my people go and guess what Pharaoh had to let them go he after God whooped him up a little bit hallelujah superseding come on somebody think about it God listen the law said you cannot walk on water how many y'all can walk on water I tell you what the only way you can't if God says walk hallelujah but God superseded his love for Peter it was not in the world it was going where in the law there was nowhere in the Old Testament you'll be able to walk on water but that was God in human flesh he was the creator and still is I remember when I was in the University of South Carolina me and my instructor got in a big argument and everybody was afraid of him because he was an atheist and he's trying to tell people you know God doesn't exist and stuff and I had I couldn't take it I had to just go out with it I thought to myself if he flunked me let him flunk me but I'm gonna let him know I am a Christian I say sure you're wrong I said just with the mental mind men can do things hallelujah I said but think about it before Christopher Columbus came over here he had to have faith hallelujah he believed that there was something here by inspiration and he found the land because he had a vision that the land was there hallelujah I said think about it we just used a small portion of our brain if God would give us a whole thing hallelujah we may even have the village to walk through walls at the end of the day I got an a he was a man how can you do that I couldn't help it something like like like like Jeremiah said it was like fire shut up in my bone that man respected me from that day on hallelujah I didn't convert him but he respected me hallelujah you see what do you mean God was superseded I still wonder how in the world Jonah stayed in that belly over the way of three days down in the bottom of that y'all know the bottom of the ocean we can't even get a submarine down there that can withstand the pressure and God took him down there because after that the whale ate he wanted to rest and he went down to the bottom of the ocean in the depths of the sea which was a representation and the type of hell that Jesus would one day descend into hell for you and I is that right that's what Jesus said remember Dona as it was in Jonah so you and I must understand all these things were shadows in time let me hurry up so you must understand God was superseded what a minute wait a minute don't you know your battles let me say it like this like our brother our Caleb said you more how can i how do you see it the devil isn't more afraid of you you you you're greater uh how do you see it I can't remember but anyway you are more powerful than the devil he ought to be afraid of you I would be if I was to see a man they say shot stand still and the Sun Stood Still the Bible said it was the first time that God a beta man voice create why because that son knew who Joshua was hallelujah and I'm gonna tell you something the whole creation know who you are that's why it's important for you to come to know who you are once you know who you are then you can work it somebody help me here it's the truth how many times we prayed in this assembly that storms that were coming our way with disperser go somewhere else and it happened just like that and the news people said we don't know what happened but we know what happened when the sons of God begins to pray things have to change hmm do y'all know how big Jericho was and God superseded the law there was no army in that day could have told those walls down it was so thick that chariots could walk on them but God told Joshua you just March it wasn't the marching it wasn't the stumping I don't care what scientists say it was not the stopping it was their obedience if you obey God's Word he'll make it come to pass hallelujah I was telling somebody today I said cuz my brother has cancer same thing and I said the doctor told me I had cancer about two years ago and I cried the first time and then I regroup hallelujah hey I said hey no way I'm accepting that come on somebody if you accept it you got it you got to refuse the package I don't care if their science science signs that you got earlier look at this x-ray I've had them tell women and men who were pregnant your baby you're gonna it's gonna have spina bifida I said if you believe that your baby got spina bifida it'll come out that way I said but if you know that God is a healer and God gave you that baby you believe that your baby is going to be right hallelujah and guess what they wanted her to abort that baby when that baby came out it was healthy that's that's what God does for his children this ain't no science is faith you love the Lord you and I must understand him and there's got to be somebody to manifest the word for this day huh God said there will be sons and daughters of God on the earth the whole creation is waiting and groaning to see the manifestations of the sons of God and they won't be able to see that until you and I become fully matured very image and likeness of God Oh miracles have always been signs and wonders have always been hallelujah from Genesis all the way up hallelujah but this age is when the true sons of God those who have been seeds to come to maturity this is the day this is the hour limit this this is not religion we this message is not a religion it's life it's blood the life of the blood hallelujah this is what we're working with we're now seeing Amen God manifests himself in human beings like he used to do see everybody think that it's all dead this with the young Pentecost pilly calls had a lot of signs but one thing they couldn't do they couldn't live it what do you say they could live it that's why you've got so many denominations hallelujah because they didn't know how to love their brothers who were different oh come on somebody but the love of God knows how to love even the unlovable hallelujah this bride she's not a denomination she's not an organization she is the word may manifest for her days this okay you and I must understand that God told Abraham I will bless you and I will make your father not I will now I have I have made you a father and you'll come to me in an old age did it happen Abraham is that right hallelujah and Abraham to this day is still known as the father of Nations hallelujah he said and you're going to be saved well and it was already done ha it was unconditional that's what people in this message you must understand in order to achieve this you must understand that you your companies is unconditional it's not based upon what you do and what you don't do it is what you believe it is what you receive hallelujah is that right it's just like Jesus telling Mary and Martha roll away the stone that's supernatural I still want to know how they did it you know you think Mary muscles you know they roll up their sleeve come on Mary Martha let's go no it was faith the same thing Jesus told them if you say to this mountain be that move same thing to women how many I been to Jerusalem before I've been there I've seen the grave I've seen how huge the stone would have been and no two women could have ever moved that stone without faith oh you think that's impossible how you gonna get up out of the grave when you don't died and your ashes are there you got to have faith that is gonna come for Lu you Oh somebody help me here yeah it does that right the Bible said the Old Testament Saints died in faith not having received the promises that they knew it was coming what was the promises promised son the resurrection hallelujah and with that resurrection King there was some that may have been just about a teaspoon of ashes left but when Jesus rose from the dead the Bible said they all rose the graves were opened reach all scripture they walked around about 40 days before they went up in their theophanies glorified body excuse me hmm see you don't die that's why when when Jesus Christ was on Mount Transfiguration Moses and Elijah was there when when Sam or when Saul went to the Witch of Endor the call of Samuel Samuel was still there whew supernatural God and the supernatural people I'm tired of being natural you ought to be tired of being natural you ought to be thirsty and crying out for the supernatural hello if you're born supernatural that's what you want hallelujah and then people say oh you know you just to Pentecost I guess I am that's my birth mom it's actually on my certificate born on the day of Pentecost huh is that right when they received the Holy Ghost were you there oh come on I was there when Paul preached all night that man fell out of the window and Paul went over there and pray for him and he rolled back to life were you there I was there why because wherever God is I am Oh somebody help me here oh that's just the way it is I mean you can't you may not be able to see it but I'm I'm saying Lord remember me cause me to remember cause me to remember what caused me to remember cuz I understand I came in here sin gave me amnesia hallelujah hey man the shock of the cake gave me amnesia and now this message is opening my understanding of who I am and where I came from and where I'm going I'm look like a lunatic that's okay because this is not my world if there are aliens I'm one of them hallelujah and one of those lights gonna pick me up when these days oh come on somebody y'all got scared on that one but it's true oh but you see but he chose to come as Abraham see did y'all know that Jesus Christ chose see Abraham super seed the way he chose to come to show in this last day God super sign we're not just anything my that's why you must be born again because if you born just of the natural you're gonna repeat what your mom and your daddy did because you are product of the tree you can't help it that's why you got to be born again Oh somebody help me you got to be born of heaven you got to be born of God and when you born of God your whole life changes your whole desire changes everything changes you're no longer connected to this world but you're looking for a city whose builder and maker is God hallelujah are you becoming Abraham's seed you become a supernatural trying to this generation hallelujah the doctors didn't even want to tell me I didn't have cancer no more but I tell you what hallelujah they say it was so aggressive it was all in my bones hallelujah I'm shouting on these bones hallelujah and all the stuff they showed me all that my point is what I was not going to accept that just like I told you my mother long when they told my mother Lord I hope I got the story correct the doctor said well you know you're gonna die she said did Jesus tell you that huh if Jesus didn't tell you I was going down what mean I'm going down you don't have the power of life one of these over you know people said well if you eat right you know you gonna extend your life what a lie science is they're liars it might help you you know have a better quality of life but when God pulls your card you can be as thin as a rail I got a brother right now a friend of mine I bet not call his name but I better not say that he's gonna listen to this tape but my point is he's still living he's still moving cuz he's a Christian y'all hear what I'm saying my point is there ain't no an extension of life God is already determined you're in and you're beginning hallelujah come on somebody what does babies do to die early and why some people live to see one hundred and something years old they say hello over there in this country they got a certain berry they eatin and you eat it and it don't extend your life science know how to make you know it's the truth the devil gonna make you pay for everything let me hurry hurry up forgive me I don't day I'm a watch let me hurry up cuz almost nine o'clock listen we are super rates until you learn and you got us think that they think I'm crazy anyway I talked to mosquitoes I talk to bees I talk to any kind of Testament when they try to come into my house rats or whatever they may be I say no evil shall come now my dwelling place now I'm giving you warning before judgment hello y'all think I'm crazy but I'm not y'all hear no sayin I don't even know how God talked to those fish but when jesus told his disciples to cast a net those fish were there so many fishing broke the net and you think God can supply your knees that's nonsense I don't care what your bills are but you gotta approach him like he's God you can't go to God in hope you must go to God in faith and he will pay every one of your bills if you approach him right or what you talk about they said Lord Caesar is calling for some taxes and we ain't got a dime Jesus they're going down there and fish and the first fish you catch open his mouth and he's got enough to pay you yours and mine maybe I'm crazy I tell you what but I like it this way because this is the way it is let me hurry up God wants to give us that supernatural power right that's what the Holy Ghost is after which the Holy Ghost has come upon you you shall receive power and that word is Authority that means the devil will recognize you when you get that Olie ghost he must obey you not you not the power that not not you but you got the uniform on it's like the policeman he ain't got no more power than you but when you see his uniform you must respect it and that's how it's the devil when the devil see that you got the Holy Ghost he must respect you I'm almost done we've got a rising character in order to make this rapture the Bible says nothing that defiles the city shall enter therein so that means all your bad habits got to go whew but Lord how I'm gonna do it you can't but the Holy Ghost can whoa somebody help me here you got to learn how to pray I'm telling you that's where the key is it's in your prayer life you want God you gotta talk to him he said you have not because you ask not hallelujah things that ought to be he said if you would pray and ask God to clean you up from all these things that God will do it God cannot lie so we ain't got no excuse Lord I got a temper hmm that temper don't mean that in the God hmm you know God no future did y'all know that and he can tell you he said Peter before the crow thrice you going to deny me now how did he know that he knows he's God he don't need to television said he don't need seeing in he knows the news before it comes why he wrote it he knew what was next in the play in the drama and he told Peter you it's already written you're gonna deny me Peter said not me Lord ain't no way I'm gonna deny you Lord I die with you cheesy okay when the pressure came guess what he did not him why why did Peter denied Jesus under the pressure because he did not have the Holy Ghost he was a real Christian but he did not have the Holy Ghost he followed Jesus for three and a half years but he did not have the Holy Ghost every time you deny Christ when you under some kind of pressure it shows you don't have it like you ought to have it and he said if you be ashamed of me and adulterous generation he said I'll be a shame of you hmm is this okay I'm just gonna close with this scripture I'm not done I just have to keep going into not tonight y'all I could feel it just that quick not tonight 2nd Peter turn with me 3 second Peter the 3rd chapter I hope you've been blessed tonight folks we must take inventory and i'ma tell you in order to comment place where Christ want you you must pray you don't have a choice huh if my people they which I'll call by my name will humble themselves and pray seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then I will hear from heaven and I will heal the land is that right and so you and I must understand in order for God to heal you and to bring you into the character that you supposed to be or you thirst for and that's a good thing if you thirsting for righteousness he said he will feel you every man and woman that hunger and thirst for Isis he said I will feel you and never let the devil take that hunger and thirst from you it's not in your time the Bible said in God's time in his own time he makes all things beautiful and that's what I try to tell the devil every time he tried to make me fall and stumble I said but still yet in his own time yeah at the end of the day huh in his own time now I don't doubt it perfection his mind in Christ second Peter three eight through ten he said beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is long-suffering to us-ward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance and that's what we're living we're living in the long-suffering of God time has already been declared no more everything that God started is only in look at all the nations they're all fighting each other not just in America all over seas everywhere even China everybody's fighting everybody's frustrated because they know somebody is going to push the button it's the spirit of destruction people that's what it is and the devil set the whole world up with with television and all of these bloody and groups scenes and now the people have been brainwashed you know that people love blood they love to see blood people love to fight and look at look at how many movies they made about the world coming to an end and you know men man destroy in the world we told them that long time ago the Bible did it's going to happen and where will you be what sides will you stand on because I'm gonna tell you something this life will end and ain't nothing you could do you can hold your your mama and your daddy hand it don't make no your wife hand your husband hand it doesn't matter you're gonna die and holding somebody hand they're gonna keep you the old baby don't leave me but when God call for you you going I'll just trust by God's grace that when you do go you ready to meet the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ hallelujah oh is this okay not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night into which the heavens shall perish away pass away excuse me with the great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up and they don't even know that the very nuclear bomb that they have created will be the same nuclear bomb that will destroy the earth that's right Russia ready to push it hallelujah how you knowing one day one day he might have one 1/2 minute Baca's and he just go at it but everybody's got how much or how much bump that's why people said climate change it ain't all about climate change is about them exploding the bombs everything has laws and when you interrupt those laws it's a set things into chaos that is why in let me say it like you want me to say that is why in the book of Genesis something chaotic happened that left the world in chaos God didn't create it like that void and without form and shape no something calls that you say how you know that because he said replenish you can't replenish something unless it was something there before he don't tell us all the secrets and all the things but one thing for certain something calls that because it's coming back to that alpha has become is becoming the Omega and mankind is gonna cause this world to spin out of orbit and instead of going out like it did in the flood it's gonna run right into the Sun that's your Bible it's gonna burn up everything what is he doing cleaning it working it all over again because there's another coming and where you and I will be brother in the secret play
