[0:00] and
[0:01] every attribute everything in that seed
[0:04] will grow and flourish and all the tree
[0:06] has to do is yield to the life that's
[0:08] within it
[0:10] so is the true believable
[0:12] but let me move on
[0:15] look at what it says in luke 2 21
[0:18] to 38.
[0:23] speaking of the coming of the messiah
[0:27] and in that day almost all of israel
[0:29] visited
[0:34] they weren't looking for
[0:36] everybody was interested in their church
[0:38] their church activities
[0:41] being renowned and how well they could
[0:43] be accepted in their little cultures
[0:47] and so when jesus came they didn't know
[0:49] him
[0:51] even when he was first born
[0:54] all of jerusalem street of boulevard
[0:57] knew nothing about him
[1:00] the people in bethlehem who didn't
[1:02] which is called the house of god's bread
[1:05] they didn't even know him
[1:08] it was such a mystery it was such a
[1:10] strange thing that god would do and you
[1:13] know it was way beyond anything they
[1:15] thought
[1:16] but it happened
[1:20] and when eight days were accomplished
[1:22] for the circumcision of the child his
[1:25] name was called jesus
[1:27] which was so named of the angel before
[1:29] he was conceived in the womb
[1:33] and when the days of her purification
[1:35] according to the law of moses were
[1:37] accomplished they brought him to
[1:38] jerusalem to present him to the lord
[1:42] as it is written in the law of the lord
[1:45] every male that opened the womb shall be
[1:47] called holy to the lord
[1:50] and to offer a sacrifice according to
[1:52] that which is said
[1:54] in the law of the lord a pair of turtle
[1:57] doves or young two young pigeons
[2:00] and behold there was a man in jerusalem
[2:03] whose name was simeon
[2:06] and the same man was a just and devout
[2:10] this is what he says
[2:11] waiting for the consolation of israel
[2:15] and the holy ghost was upon him
[2:19] what are you saying
[2:21] this is why jesus constantly told them
[2:24] watch and pray if you're watching and
[2:26] praying what you're watching what you're
[2:28] looking for you're looking for the
[2:30] prophecies that have been been made or
[2:33] prophesied unto
[2:36] the church to come to pass you watch it
[2:39] and you're praying while you're watching
[2:41] it that you will be counted worthy amen
[2:46] these people
[2:47] out of all the religious people
[2:50] were there praying and watching for the
[2:52] messiah
[2:54] now how could that be
[2:56] because they received a revelation from
[2:59] god somewhere
[3:01] somewhere in their lives god told them
[3:04] this is the season this is the day this
[3:07] is the hour that's another thing
[3:10] people always think when jesus said no
[3:12] man knoweth the day or the hour people
[3:15] always think 24 hours in a day and 60
[3:18] minutes in an hour
[3:20] no he's talking about a season
[3:24] no man knowing the day that day is a
[3:27] season
[3:29] no man knowing the hour that hour is a
[3:32] season
[3:36] but in that season you're supposed to
[3:39] watch and pray
[3:41] oh come on people amen we know let me
[3:43] stop and and say what i need to say we
[3:46] know that the mark of the beast is not
[3:48] putting 666 in your head or in your
[3:51] forehead or your hand or your forehead
[3:54] we know we didn't understand it but
[3:57] god's interpretation is a boycott
[4:01] and the prophet god said when they begin
[4:03] to boycott against the bride
[4:06] you understand when that union comes
[4:09] amen because what is it the antichrist
[4:11] is now building a system a union they're
[4:14] coming together and the whole point
[4:16] behind that is to shut the bride out
[4:21] that's where the mark is
[4:24] and when you fail to see that we're
[4:28] living in that day and and just like the
[4:31] brother i heard a brother say the other
[4:33] day watch russia
[4:35] all of this boycotting and union is
[4:38] coming together and now you see russia
[4:40] on this place what do you think coming
[4:42] then you see earthquake here volcano
[4:44] here volcano earthquake flood everything
[4:47] is setting up amen this whole system
[4:52] to do what
[4:53] to union themselves against the bride of
[4:56] christ amen you say it ain't happening
[4:59] it is happening
[5:01] rome and the church unified themselves
[5:04] against the christ
[5:06] that's exactly what's happening again
[5:08] people say well well what about russia
[5:10] russia has been ordained to do what
[5:12] she's got to do that's right
[5:14] don't you worry she knows what she's got
[5:16] to do too
[5:18] everybody think russia or
[5:20] we can beat russia russia could whoop us
[5:22] a long time ago
[5:24] but god has a season and a time to bring
[5:27] everything to pass
[5:29] look at that volcano that roughed it out
[5:31] there that shook the fault and shook
[5:33] that fault there in los angeles don't
[5:36] you know it has already been locked and
[5:38] loaded
[5:39] it's a wonder it didn't release then
[5:43] so how much time do we have and if we
[5:46] have a little time
[5:48] what must we be doing with that time
[5:56] listen it was revealed unto him by the
[5:59] holy ghost that he should not see death
[6:02] sound like a rapture message to me
[6:06] before he had seen the lord's christ
[6:13] he and anna was the only one that knew
[6:16] that when jesus would come he would be a
[6:19] baby
[6:20] they weren't looking you know they were
[6:22] out in the street looking for some great
[6:24] soldier you know dressed in some kind of
[6:27] wonderful armor no they knew
[6:30] he would come in a way that the people
[6:32] did not believe or wouldn't believe he
[6:34] would come
[6:35] amen now even god told him
[6:39] is that right
[6:40] herod even knew
[6:42] that jesus was coming
[6:45] i mean the wise men of the the of the
[6:47] roman of excuse me of that particular
[6:50] chapter told him that he would be born
[6:52] in bethlehem
[6:54] and herod said kill all the babies three
[6:56] years and under trying to kill the
[6:58] christ
[7:00] but he escaped
[7:02] went down to egypt
[7:05] veiling himself
[7:07] grew up
[7:09] come back
[7:11] he comes into the temple and he's
[7:12] teaching at the age of 12.
[7:15] confounding the pharisees with this
[7:17] wisdom and knowledge
[7:20] and they still didn't get it
[7:28] and it came by the spirit into the
[7:29] temple and when the parents brought him
[7:31] in the trial to do for him after the
[7:33] custom of the law then took he him up in
[7:36] his arms and blessed god and said
[7:40] lord
[7:41] now let us thou servant depart in peace
[7:45] according to thy word
[7:47] for mine eyes
[7:49] have seen thy salvation
[7:52] which thou have prepared for the before
[7:55] the face of all people a light to the
[7:59] light lighten
[8:00] a light to lighten the gentiles
[8:03] and the glory of thy people israel now
[8:06] watch what he does he he literally put
[8:09] the gentiles before the jew
[8:12] israel
[8:13] and what was it this jesus was coming
[8:16] for a bride
[8:18] he was coming for his other party if you
[8:20] want to say it like this which was the
[8:23] gentile
[8:24] you said well what do you mean what do
[8:25] you mean let me say it like this and you
[8:27] heard me say this before even when it
[8:30] comes and i'm gonna tell y'all something
[8:32] people
[8:34] if y'all think
[8:36] you're gonna let me say it like this
[8:37] you'll never have faith believing
[8:41] the way we we most most of us believe
[8:45] that jesus is going to sneak up on you
[8:48] and in a moment of a twinkling i catch
[8:50] you unaware
[8:52] that is not what the bible says
[8:54] the bible says you're children of the
[8:56] light
[8:57] you're children of the day
[8:59] is that right he said that will not come
[9:02] upon you
[9:03] unawares you you'll be aware of what's
[9:06] happening why because of the opening of
[9:08] the seals because of the opening of the
[9:10] word because of the seven thunders
[9:12] however you want to say it but we know
[9:14] what's coming and we know where we're
[9:16] standing
[9:18] why because he came with the book open
[9:20] amen
[9:22] no more mysteries no more secrets for
[9:24] the bride
[9:26] the thing that she needs to come to
[9:27] understand is that the move is on for
[9:30] the bride
[9:31] and she must understand that she is the
[9:34] coming of the lord that's right amen
[9:37] he calling the bride coming
[9:40] when does the bride come
[9:43] she is the elisha
[9:46] oh come on somebody that's why this holy
[9:49] ghost with your mind this anointing we
[9:51] are talking about amen you must receive
[9:54] it because if you do not receive that
[9:58] you'll never see what i'm talking about
[10:03] how can brother branham said she'll be
[10:05] so much like him she'll pull him out of
[10:06] heaven
[10:09] huh
[10:10] well how are you going to be like her
[10:11] like him if you don't receive his spirit
[10:15] you must receive his nature as our
[10:16] brother said that's the point
[10:19] and this his nature doesn't come by your
[10:22] works it comes by him maturing up into
[10:25] you that's what paul said grow up into
[10:28] him amen amen listen
[10:31] we thought the devil was our greatest
[10:33] enemy
[10:34] and brother brown says not so
[10:36] your greatest enemy is you
[10:39] it's your flesh
[10:41] you must allow the holy ghost to conquer
[10:44] your will
[10:46] your flesh
[10:49] you can't blame it on the devil no more
[10:51] because the devil is defeated
[10:54] now you must be defeated amen
[10:59] and joseph and his mother marveled at
[11:02] those things which were spoken by him
[11:05] and simeon blessed them and sent unto
[11:07] married
[11:08] his mother behold this child
[11:11] is set for the fall and rising again of
[11:15] many in israel and for a sign which
[11:17] shall be spoken
[11:19] shall be spoken against
[11:21] yea
[11:22] a sword shall pierce through thine own
[11:25] soul also
[11:26] that the thoughts of many hearts may be
[11:28] revealed
[11:29] and there was anna a prophetess the
[11:33] daughter of penuel
[11:35] of the tribe of acer
[11:37] she was of a great age and had lived
[11:40] with the husband seven years from her
[11:43] virginity do you really think that's
[11:46] left there for nothing
[11:48] do you think it's worth it there for any
[11:50] seven years seven church ages seven
[11:53] virgins
[11:55] amen there waiting what for the coming
[11:58] of the lord
[11:59] and he came in a way that the world
[12:02] they'll never believe it
[12:04] first of all
[12:05] they'll never believe it because brother
[12:06] branham said it
[12:08] and when he saw the cloud up there he
[12:09] said that's my lord amen see
[12:13] why would he say that
[12:14] if it wasn't the coming of the lord if
[12:16] that wasn't him then who was he but then
[12:20] did it did it just stay a cloud
[12:22] no sir just like it was when moses saw
[12:25] him up on the mountain that same fire
[12:27] that was in the bush stepped into moses
[12:30] the same god that was in the cloud must
[12:32] step into you
[12:33] he must become your headship
[12:36] hallelujah
[12:42] she was a widow
[12:44] of about four school in four years
[12:48] which departed not from the temple
[12:50] you know we're not with us
[12:53] because our old husbands died
[12:57] if your old husband is still living
[12:58] you're an adulterer
[13:01] but that old man that old husband that
[13:03] you once lived with
[13:05] must die
[13:08] hallelujah before god marry you anyway
[13:11] she was a widow for about four score in
[13:13] 40 years
[13:15] which departed not from the temple and
[13:17] that is a generation you know what i'm
[13:18] saying but serve god with fasting and
[13:21] praying night and day she was sincere
[13:26] she was consecrated she wasn't about
[13:29] folly
[13:31] it wasn't crazy stuff going on in their
[13:33] lives they were so dedicated to that
[13:36] thought that he's coming and i must be
[13:38] ready when he comes so i can see him
[13:43] and everybody ain't gonna see him and
[13:44] i'm telling you i'm sorry the way the
[13:46] world has told you about the rapture
[13:48] taking place planes gonna crash and
[13:51] boats are gonna sink and all people
[13:53] gonna drop dead and people in this one
[13:55] bed left in the bed and one here
[13:57] that's not the way it's going
[14:00] it's a secret catching away
[14:03] there is a third coming of christ but
[14:05] that cro that coming is for the jews
[14:09] amen
[14:12] huh
[14:14] and when he comes they're going to do
[14:15] the same thing why because they're not
[14:18] that maybe they're thinking about jesus
[14:20] with pierced hands and you know scarred
[14:23] but when he comes he'll be in moses and
[14:26] elijah
[14:29] the same god
[14:31] that's where he'll be
[14:36] and then they're going to see where did
[14:38] you get those stars
[14:40] why what do you say oh people of god
[14:42] what moses and elijah is going to preach
[14:45] the same message
[14:46] that william branham preached
[14:48] that's right
[14:51] he's going to preach the same message
[14:53] that paul preached
[14:56] they gotta preach crucifixion you know
[14:58] that burial resurrection i'm not saying
[15:01] they won't see him they will see him but
[15:04] you got to understand everything will be
[15:06] by revelation
[15:07] because let me say it like this
[15:10] they were gardeners there were people
[15:12] even at the resurrection didn't see
[15:14] jesus
[15:15] only those who god opened their eyes to
[15:17] see
[15:19] everybody ain't going to see it wouldn't
[15:20] happen
[15:22] no
[15:24] see the thoughts of men has always
[15:26] getting us on uh in in the message
[15:28] unchangeable god god he doesn't change
[15:31] he always puts it out there for people
[15:32] and and we always mess up because we put
[15:35] our theology to it and we expect for it
[15:37] to be in a way that we can you know
[15:40] everybody can grasp it but that's not
[15:41] the way it happens
[15:43] brother adam said jesus we become a man
[15:46] he was a humble
[15:48] and how could a king of heaven have
[15:51] split
[15:53] spit in his face
[15:55] and rag around his head and hit him with
[15:58] a stick and said say they tell me you're
[16:01] a prophet tell us who hit you
[16:04] and we'll believe you you understand me
[16:07] how can he he literally allowed the
[16:11] people to do that
[16:12] and the whole time he was blinding them
[16:17] to the fact that that was the messiah
[16:23] even his disciples
[16:26] was blinded
[16:28] on the road to emma as they proved that
[16:30] they were
[16:31] and they said to jesus we thought
[16:34] that he was the one
[16:37] but prior to that they believed he was
[16:42] and then god had to open their eyes how
[16:45] by anointing the scripture
[16:51] and when were they eyes open
[16:54] when he sat in that tent and broke the
[16:56] bread
[16:58] the bible says then were their eyes open
[17:00] see what i'm saying the very word of god
[17:02] was preaching to them from moses all the
[17:05] way up and they still their eyes were
[17:07] holding they couldn't see
[17:12] that's what i'm talking about
[17:19] tell us who hit you and we'll believe
[17:21] you
[17:22] and he never opened his mouth
[17:24] how could that be
[17:25] the king that they were looking for was
[17:28] going to beat the world down
[17:31] but god sent them the king
[17:33] and because god sent it in his way
[17:37] then they refused to believe it
[17:40] but god had that way of doing to sin it
[17:43] and he never sent it any other way
[17:46] but what his word said he would come
[17:50] but they had their mind made up
[17:53] it had to be some other way
[17:56] that's where we make the mistakes friend
[17:59] that's where the trouble lays
[18:01] when the forerunner john the baptist
[18:03] came
[18:04] the voice of one crying in the
[18:05] wilderness why the bible said all the
[18:08] high places will be brought down and all
[18:11] the low places would be lifted up and
[18:14] all these things would take place the
[18:16] mountain would skip like rams and the
[18:18] leaves would clap their hands why
[18:22] they was expecting a shaking of this man
[18:25] coming down
[18:27] out of the corridors of heaven all
[18:28] dressed in fine linen and crown upon his
[18:31] head and something or something what
[18:33] happened
[18:38] god sent them an old preacher down on
[18:40] the well out down on the wilderness with
[18:43] a pierced a piece of sheepskin wrapped
[18:46] around him looked like a fuzzy worm his
[18:49] face all full of beer
[18:52] oh
[18:52] away with such a fella as that eating
[18:56] locust and and with honey and wild honey
[18:58] and and we don't want nothing like to do
[19:00] with that
[19:02] how could that forerun the messiah but
[19:05] it was god's way of forerunning the
[19:07] messiah now let me say it like this
[19:10] brother branham became to came to a
[19:12] place he was no threat
[19:14] see this is where the where the where
[19:16] the enemy comes in to attack you is when
[19:19] you become a threat
[19:22] you understand me they even sent
[19:24] uh the fbi and everything to investigate
[19:27] his meetings
[19:29] but when they found out he was not an
[19:30] intellectual and that he was just a
[19:32] country little fella that said you know
[19:34] his broken english and all of that then
[19:36] he was no longer a threat
[19:39] but they had no idea that when this man
[19:41] would die what would take place
[19:44] see what i'm saying john the baptist
[19:46] they got rid of him by cutting his head
[19:48] off and they thought they got rid of
[19:50] john the baptist and then come jesus
[19:53] and that's the way it's supposed to be
[19:56] when the elijah leave elijah's supposed
[19:58] to come amen
[20:00] the power of god is supposed to increase
[20:03] and not decrease that's right
[20:07] so what's happening we're being blinded
[20:09] by layer to see if many of people are
[20:11] still being blinded because they haven't
[20:12] died and rot to their own thinking
[20:16] god is trying to unfold this mystery to
[20:19] us and we're still looking like oh
[20:21] where's he where is he now we're he's
[20:24] here then if he's here then what does
[20:26] that mean he's here
[20:28] he's not floating around in the
[20:30] atmosphere
[20:31] he's supposed to be in in you and you
[20:34] and me
[20:35] in that day you'll know that i'm in the
[20:37] father of the fathers and me and i am in
[20:38] you that's where he's at
[20:42] and the very thing that
[20:44] people saw in elijah or brother branham
[20:46] they're supposed to be seeing it in us
[20:50] yes
[20:52] in a double way
[20:54] we've got to receive it in a way that
[20:56] god said it god is pleased with it
[20:58] that's his way
[21:00] he's all wisdom he's all-powerful he's
[21:03] omnipotent i'm the present oh he's god
[21:06] that i am not that i was or will be but
[21:10] i am forever the same he's god and he
[21:13] does things in mysterious ways but he
[21:16] does it for his own glory he does it
[21:19] because that is his best to do it that
[21:23] way we must receive it the way that he
[21:25] sends it
[21:27] i'm sure that all uh and that's the
[21:29] problem
[21:31] you know people say well the seals are
[21:32] not open they're not fully open and some
[21:34] say they fully open it and those who say
[21:36] they fully opened and they said well he
[21:38] hasn't come but he's coming
[21:40] oh my god
[21:44] and if he's coming what he's coming for
[21:51] and if brother branham wasn't didn't
[21:53] finish the mystery then we might as well
[21:55] look for another malachi
[21:56] 4.
[21:58] unless you believe he's returning to do
[22:00] something
[22:02] but you'll find out that that's not
[22:03] scriptural
[22:05] and if you can just find me a type where
[22:07] it happens in the word i can understand
[22:09] what you're saying
[22:11] but i can tell you and i can show you
[22:13] how the holy spirit is a progressive
[22:14] spirit and it moves from one person to
[22:16] another
[22:20] that's how god works
[22:24] oh but believe you me even in this day
[22:26] it's not going to be a great group of
[22:28] people
[22:30] because a lot of people are not willing
[22:32] to die to their teachings
[22:35] right
[22:37] oh i know i got it right
[22:40] paul thought he had it right too
[22:43] and he began to persecute the christians
[22:47] it took jesus christ to blind him and
[22:49] then reopen his eyes for him to see that
[22:52] the god that he worshipped under the law
[22:54] has now moved into a dispensation of
[22:56] grace
[22:58] and then god chose
[22:59] chosen
[23:00] paul to preach a message that was so
[23:02] contrary to the jewish tradition that it
[23:05] caused him to be persecuted and killed
[23:07] three times and you know beaten and
[23:10] everything else
[23:12] what made that man do what he did
[23:15] because his eyes were open and there was
[23:18] a birth there was a life the same christ
[23:20] that died on calvary was now living in
[23:23] paul amen so much so that paul said they
[23:27] even took me as jesus himself amen
[23:32] and if that be the truth that's the way
[23:34] it's supposed to be with us
[23:37] you say what it was that way with
[23:39] william branham
[23:40] people literally thought that's who he
[23:42] was
[23:43] and he had to tell the people no no no
[23:45] no i'm not the one i'm just a uh uh
[23:50] i'm not the son of man i'm a son of man
[23:53] revealing the son of man i'm pointing
[23:55] you to him i'm not him
[23:58] i wait i wait on him
[24:01] and as i see him move i move he never
[24:04] gave glory to himself
[24:07] it was never about him it was all about
[24:10] jesus christ amen
[24:13] hallelujah
[24:14] he said well what do you mean even
[24:16] elijah john the baptist amen the voice
[24:19] crying in the wilderness he was the only
[24:21] one that saw the sign
[24:23] the whole pharisees didn't hear him that
[24:25] see him
[24:26] he saw that dove is sitting down in
[24:28] heaven and landing on jesus and he was
[24:30] the one that said this is my beloved son
[24:32] in whom i'm well pleased to dwell in
[24:34] everybody didn't see it amen
[24:40] standing right there and they didn't see
[24:42] it
[24:43] like the revelation of the seven seals
[24:45] people can read that and quote it but
[24:48] it's not in that except the father
[24:50] reveals it to you you won't see it
[24:54] it takes the anointing of god for you to
[24:56] see this message
[24:57] why it's been hidden hidden it's hidden
[25:00] from the wise and the pluto why do you
[25:02] think god allowed him him to say at the
[25:05] opening of the seals 700 and he said it
[25:07] more than one time
[25:11] it's bad english
[25:13] during the whole time
[25:15] it was to run those wise men away
[25:19] those people who thought those
[25:20] intellectuals those those those uh
[25:23] pharisees of the day it was to shut them
[25:26] down it was supplying them and then
[25:28] brother balaam said
[25:29] there's not one error in there
[25:35] see they they couldn't understand that
[25:38] it wasn't given to them
[25:41] but there's a pride who can hear
[25:44] there's a bride that have eyes to see
[25:46] what ears to hear
[25:48] hallelujah is that all right
[25:50] listen the word of god called into luke
[25:52] 21 9 29-34 he says and he spake them a
[25:56] power but behold the fig tree and all
[25:58] the trees when they now shoot forth to
[26:00] see
[26:01] and know of your own shells the summer
[26:04] is now nigh in hand now
[26:07] you could be out there looking for a fig
[26:09] tree
[26:14] but the bible says that israel is that
[26:16] tree
[26:20] where they now shoot forth to see and
[26:22] when they now shall fought you see and
[26:24] know of your own selves that the summer
[26:26] is not
[26:27] nigh at home they're looking for people
[26:30] now don't you understand people
[26:32] typically the whole thing they're the
[26:33] whole bible says that israel is when we
[26:36] look at our country and we they cut our
[26:39] oil off
[26:40] and then all of a sudden it goes to
[26:42] russia
[26:44] and china and we don't even see
[26:46] brother brown says watch russia
[26:48] and watch her when she goes for the oil
[26:53] you watch this
[26:54] flip
[26:56] and you're right in the midst of it and
[26:58] what are you looking for you understand
[27:01] you must understand this is the time
[27:04] this is the hour this is the season and
[27:06] therefore you need to make sure you have
[27:09] your garment on
[27:16] bearded i'm saying to you this
[27:18] generation shall not
[27:24] likewise when you see these things come
[27:26] to pass know ye not that the kingdom of
[27:30] god is nigh in here what kingdom of god
[27:33] the kingdom of god is not meat or drink
[27:35] but it's what
[27:38] power
[27:41] light i can go on where in the holy
[27:43] ghost
[27:46] and the
[27:52] [Music]
[28:09] [Music]
[28:24] he don't buy he doesn't sell man the
[28:27] earth none of those things that have no
[28:29] value to him the only thing that's
[28:31] valuable is you looking at all the gold
[28:33] and the diamonds and all that stuff
[28:35] he cares about you more than he cares
[28:38] about the sparrows and what you're
[28:40] wearing and what you look like
[28:42] that's what's wrong with
[28:56] praying and asking god to reveal truth
[28:59] to you
[29:00] you need revelation to understand listen
[29:02] without what is revelation but light
[29:05] that's your lantern
[29:07] that's your way of knowing which
[29:09] direction to move
[29:13] heaven and earth shall pass away but my
[29:15] word shall not pass i'm not saying don't
[29:18] do what you're doing but my thing is
[29:21] direction to move
[29:24] into folly
[29:26] take heed he says in the third and
[29:28] fourth verse not saying don't do what
[29:30] you're to your what self don't get
[29:32] caught unless at any time your heart be
[29:34] overcharged
[29:37] with society and drunkenness and cares
[29:39] of this life and oh i gotta have this
[29:42] and i gotta have that
[29:43] oh i gotta be rich and i gotta be this
[29:46] and i gotta have all and you're
[29:47] forgetting that the world is getting
[29:50] ready to burn i have this and i gotta
[29:52] have nothing you can achieve in this
[29:54] life is going to stand
[29:56] the thing that's most important it
[29:58] should be is your soul
[30:00] oh
[30:04] the thing that's most important it
[30:06] should
[30:11] and that's what's happening you see
[30:13] everybody in this message even in this
[30:15] church
[30:16] everybody's so busy working and getting
[30:18] this card
[30:19] in overcharged
[30:24] and now the devil's got you tangled up
[30:26] and you got to have this and you got to
[30:27] have over time you got to do it and you
[30:29] don't even know
[30:33] your mind is on those things when your
[30:35] mind should be on christ
[30:37] how are you going to have your mind on
[30:39] christ when you've allowed satan to wear
[30:41] you into some stuff how are you going to
[30:43] have your mind on christ when you've got
[30:44] mercy
[30:47] the coming of the lord help mercy this
[30:49] is approximately 500 million so-called
[30:52] christians listen there is
[30:54] what he's speaking of one in a million
[30:55] he said there's approximately one 500
[30:58] million this is a long time ago
[31:00] so-called christians in the world today
[31:02] and each day is a generation and now
[31:04] what if the rapture would come today and
[31:07] 500 people
[31:08] university will be taken in the rapture
[31:10] university you would never know or even
[31:14] in the paper of them going in the paper
[31:16] of them the coming of the lord is a
[31:18] secret comic it's a secret comment he'll
[31:20] come and steal away
[31:22] it'll be such a minority
[31:25] just like it was in the days when the
[31:27] disciples have jesus jesus why does the
[31:29] scribes say
[31:31] that elias must first come and he said
[31:35] he has already come
[31:37] and you never knew
[31:39] they didn't even know john the baptist
[31:42] the anointing of the liars was on him
[31:45] i'm almost done
[31:47] coming from the messenger god's chosen
[31:48] place of worship
[31:50] he said then father we pray that you'll
[31:53] visit us tonight in the world
[31:56] we'll come here for correction
[31:58] for understanding that we might know
[32:01] just how to live in the present day
[32:04] and what to look forward to forward to
[32:07] what to do
[32:08] but we know that the coming of the lord
[32:10] is drawing nine
[32:12] according to all the signs that the
[32:14] prophet foretold
[32:16] we're nearing the time lord when when
[32:19] complete
[32:20] uh
[32:21] differences will be given to your
[32:23] children
[32:24] god let us everyone be
[32:36] and we're trying to prepare for that
[32:39] hour
[32:40] now he's not talking about a 24-day
[32:44] uh 60-minute hour
[32:47] when rebecca saw the men coming let me
[32:49] tell you like this and you heard me
[32:50] preach this before
[32:52] jesus says lord
[33:06] and let her
[33:08] also water the canvas
[33:11] now rebecca didn't hear that
[33:13] she wasn't dead
[33:17] but being that she was bright chosen of
[33:20] god god granted her the revelation
[33:23] and if you know the message brother said
[33:25] god works on both ends and as god was
[33:28] working with elohees and abraham god was
[33:30] also working with rebecca
[33:33] it was an unwritten word it was unspoken
[33:38] word
[33:39] and she caught the revelation
[33:42] and so when she gave the water to the
[33:45] men she also watered the camel
[33:48] y'all understand me
[33:49] that was that part of the message
[33:52] brother
[33:52] i couldn't figure it out
[33:54] but it has to be manifested through
[33:57] somebody
[33:58] it can't god doesn't speak things and
[34:01] leave them out there as some mystic
[34:04] it's a revelation it is something that
[34:06] god amen is doing but it's such a
[34:09] mystery it is given only to the right to
[34:13] know what to do with the word
[34:20] it is the pride coming of christ
[34:22] i'm telling you these things and you
[34:24] know what
[34:25] without the revelation without god
[34:27] quickening it to you
[34:28] you don't even know what i'm talking
[34:29] about
[34:30] as christ was the first one and i'm
[34:32] talking it ain't nothing
[34:37] it's really simple it was always simple
[34:39] we make it complicated
[34:43] the only thing that we failed to do is
[34:44] that you can't even you got to get the
[34:46] holy ghost
[34:48] and like we know we say okay we what is
[34:51] the holy ghost it comes to change
[34:54] when you die and you rot into your own
[34:56] ideas and you surrender to god god comes
[34:58] in you might shout you might dance you
[35:00] might cry
[35:14] want to be more like him more like him
[35:17] there's something that drives you
[35:19] listen you can be illiterate you don't
[35:22] have to be a theologian because the
[35:24] revelation will come to you because he's
[35:26] in you
[35:31] as christ was the first one to raise
[35:33] from all the prophets and so forth
[35:36] all those tight all although
[35:39] all those types in many places
[35:41] he was the first fruit of those that
[35:43] slept
[35:44] in the bride coming of christ coming out
[35:47] of the church there have to be a sheep
[35:49] waved again in the last days and he did
[35:53] waving or of the sheath what was the
[35:56] sheath the first one that come to
[35:58] maturity the first one that proved he
[36:00] was a sheath that
[36:02] proved it was a sheath what's the use of
[36:05] saying oh brother burnham did this
[36:07] brother branham did that brother did
[36:08] this and you don't understand why he did
[36:11] it what was saying what god was doing
[36:14] god brought him to a maturity
[36:17] in this day
[36:19] it could not have happened until the
[36:21] capstone came down
[36:23] the fullness of the word
[36:27] you think the
[36:28] you know the capstone over there you
[36:29] think that was just what would you think
[36:31] that was for
[36:32] it what brother said it wasn't for the
[36:34] world then who was it for amen
[36:37] it was for the bride
[36:39] to recognize that this word that was
[36:42] given to our dear or her was to prep
[36:44] prepare her to meet him
[36:47] it's the only entrance into heaven
[36:51] it really is
[36:57] i'm not saying that there's a not come a
[37:00] foolish but i'm just saying
[37:02] to be bride to make a rapture there was
[37:05] a word given to her to address and adorn
[37:07] herself
[37:10] and understand this is not a natural
[37:12] adorning this is spiritual
[37:14] and the problem is is that your veil
[37:16] just like his veil and just like
[37:18] christ's veil veils jesus christ from
[37:20] the world they may look at you stupid
[37:23] and remain like you dumb and you're not
[37:24] so smart but in you you got jesus christ
[37:29] and all of us may not be raised in the
[37:30] dead and all of us may not be speaking
[37:32] things into existence but whatever the
[37:34] purpose is for us
[37:37] it's happening
[37:41] hallelujah i'm sure you see what i'm
[37:43] talking about
[37:45] it was waved over the people and the
[37:47] first time there will come forth for the
[37:50] bright age because there ain't no thing
[37:52] in the bright age it is
[37:55] that itself is a mystery
[37:59] for a resurrection out of dark
[38:01] denomination did you come out of dark
[38:02] denominations
[38:04] will be a message
[38:06] that the full maturity of the world has
[38:09] returned back again in its what full
[38:12] power being waved over the people by the
[38:15] same signs and wonders that he did back
[38:18] there that's what the prophet of god was
[38:21] there for
[38:23] to wave and to let you see that jesus
[38:26] christ is the same yesterday today and
[38:28] forever
[38:30] hallelujah when they saw him
[38:32] they saw he was a kentuckian but oh my
[38:37] when the blind eyes were being opened
[38:39] that wasn't a man
[38:40] amen amen when the dead was being raised
[38:43] that was not a man amen
[38:50] when he spoke through this to the storms
[38:52] that was not a man
[38:54] that was god
[38:57] tabernacling in what what is the
[38:59] greatest mystery that god the almighty
[39:02] god the holy god the righteous god the
[39:05] the the omnipotent god
[39:08] can literally live
[39:11] in an ungodly flesh
[39:15] that's the mystery
[39:17] that god would live in fallen man
[39:20] nothing you could do
[39:22] nothing you could say you couldn't
[39:24] manipulate him you can't pay him he
[39:28] chose you
[39:29] he elected you
[39:31] he performs in you
[39:35] for his own good pleasure and his own
[39:37] will
[39:38] because i live
[39:40] you live also
[39:43] speaking to his wife
[39:44] because i live ye live also
[39:47] what a resurrection
[39:49] that that was let me tell you something
[39:52] and the resurrection is to bring back
[39:54] that which is going down bring it back
[39:56] up
[39:57] and if we don't see a resurrected christ
[39:59] in our midst there is no resurrection
[40:03] you understand what i'm saying
[40:05] resurrection means that the christ that
[40:07] once lived is now living in you
[40:10] that means when people see you they see
[40:12] christ
[40:14] listen i'm telling you people
[40:16] we have educated this thing so much
[40:19] we have talked it out so much
[40:21] we have done everything we can a thought
[40:24] that we could but there is something
[40:27] lacking
[40:28] and until this anointing that i'm
[40:31] talking about
[40:32] revisits us
[40:34] we are in dangerous place
[40:36] we are in a dangerous place i'ma say it
[40:38] again until that anointing and when i
[40:42] said i'm not talking about all the
[40:43] shouting and dancing i'm talking about
[40:45] the divine love
[40:47] that can love his enemy
[40:49] love their friends
[40:50] and love conquers everything love don't
[40:53] quit
[40:54] love doesn't give up
[40:56] love don't give up on brothers love
[40:58] don't doesn't give up on friends
[41:00] love conquers
[41:02] love understands the warfare
[41:05] because love is god amen and i'm gonna
[41:08] tell you something until we see that
[41:10] we're standing in a dangerous place
[41:13] and i'm gonna tell you like this in
[41:15] closing
[41:16] it's not about power
[41:19] it's not by might
[41:21] but it's by his spirit amen amen
[41:25] and what we need to see is more god
[41:28] you see that's why people don't come to
[41:30] church
[41:32] they've been blinded
[41:35] people who could be here they don't come
[41:38] for various reasons now some people are
[41:40] legit they've got good reasons
[41:44] but people don't understand the time
[41:45] we're living in they don't understand
[41:47] that they overtaken the things
[41:49] they got too many things in their lives
[41:55] and that's what happened to them
[42:10] that wise version she had all the
[42:11] natural oils she wasn't looking for one
[42:13] she had
[42:14] it and that's what happened to the
[42:16] foolish virgins they would help us lord
[42:19] you pray for me and obviously i don't
[42:21] know what they thought they just thought
[42:22] they had more time and maybe they
[42:23] thought they were too good to be left
[42:25] behind
[42:26] i don't know how that's got to be more
[42:27] than so
[42:40] got to be a powerful life it's got to be
[42:44] listen he said well two or three
[42:45] gathered in my name don't you understand
[42:47] that i mean
[42:48] not because you believe in the name of
[42:50] jesus christ it means that you got his
[42:51] name you you got his character but two
[42:54] or three are gathered in my name you got
[42:57] his character you got his life in you
[42:59] that's what he's talking about
[43:02] not because you've got higher grounds
[43:05] jesus christ some other kind of talent
[43:08] that's not what he's talking about
[43:12] [Music]
[43:24] we've got remember the message i've
[43:27] talked to you about about elevating our
[43:29] minds we're so afraid of
[43:31] things that we've never written what let
[43:34] me say like this of the things you have
[43:36] heard
[43:37] already
[43:42] [Music]
[43:53] it must be a change this whole
[43:55] coming to the church coming here is
[43:57] about change lord change me bring me a
[44:00] word that's going to change me from
[44:03] glory to glory
[44:07] here is lord change lord change me but
[44:09] you give me a word that's going to
[44:11] change me from glory to glory lord
[44:17] with flesh but you've got to have a
[44:19] vision of what you're being changed into
[44:21] the word has already become flesh to
[44:23] jesus christ
[44:25] the word now the flesh must become the
[44:27] word
[44:28] everything was dying
[44:30] must come to a place of jesus
[44:33] it's just like every time
[44:34] it seemed like it gets harder
[44:37] you must come to a place have faith in
[44:39] jobs
[44:39] [Music]
[44:41] it seems like it's getting it ain't in
[44:43] you
