TRANSCRIPT
========================================
that's what our minds let God like as if God is punishing us no sir he's loving us is that right and when we get spanked listen you you call it act like it is most child when you when you get spanked he says well who spanked you Daddy or Mama they know who did it and they know they got spanked and that's the thing when something is coming our way and God is chastising us forward don't act like oh my God why and how did this come about but thank God for the spanking y'all better hear what I'm saying I remember a time my mama whooped me really good I never forgot it but guarantee you it corrected the tree I tell people I said my mom didn't cut no limbs off she went down there to the root she uprooted the whole tree oh yeah she made sure she she ate she got victory that day as a child I didn't understand it I'm telling you so this is personal I did not understand my mama whipping me like that until I matured and when I matured I said Mama you were right I could have been locked up in jail right now if that tree would have continued to grow y'all understand what I'm saying now I ain't telling you no more than that but the truth of the matter is we ought to thank God for his counseling his wisdom listen we would not know the will of God had not God had an order we'll be right out there with everybody else not knowing that God has an order because we're living in a time where man is right in his own eyes Psalm 97 8-12 Zion heard and was glad and the daughters of Judah Rejoice because of thy judgments oh Lord do you think they they talking about uh uh God punishing them no they're talking about God correcting them the word is the corrector that's why the Bible said judgment begins at the house of God now when you come here God ain't killing you he's giving you life but he's judging you by the word his judgments are true and when the word comes across the pulpit you say Amen Hallelujah it might make you feel good it may make you feel glad it might make you feel sad but you say hallelujah and how why because he's now looking in your heart and he's judging you and he's telling you hey this is not right this is not right correct this correct that and you say Amen for thou O Lord are high above all the Earth Thou Art exalted far above all gods ye that love the Lord hate evil now this is counseling now if you love the Lord give ask God to give you Grace to hate evil he preserved the soul of his Saints I love that he delivered them out of out of the hand of the wicked so if you've got some Wicked person that's troubling you don't you worry the Bible said that God will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked that's the word amen and when the enemy comes like a flood this is what you ought to bring him to Lord you said you would deliver me out of the hand of the wicked and your counseling is right and your judgments are true light is sown for the righteous gladness for the upright and heart rejoice in the Lord ye righteous and give thanks at the remembrance of his Holiness you see what I'm saying what is God doing bringing us back into his holiness where we were from the beginning into his Holiness and we know that this is a world a Fallen World a perverted world everything is uh how you said so perverted and you know uh uh hybrid and you name it nothing can go right in it nothing this is why God had to birth us into another kingdom where everything goes right in this Kingdom nothing fails God's order you've never seen the Sun get out of place people say fall in Stars a star ain't never fail but Luther Lucifer he's the only one that I know of and all the angels that was with him but all the stars that God said in the universe is still the same place doing the same thing they've always did if one of them move out of the way it would cause a a catastrophic effect right everything that like soldiers standing there the sun is faithful the Moon is faithful right everything is still moving the way God had it moving from the beginning what is it that's God's order Hallelujah think about it and if that if that God is the only thing that puts us back in our proper place no system can do it no man-made theology or anything can do this only one thing one person can do this and that's God himself the Creator the Bible said all things was created by Him all things were made by him everything that you see Hallelujah but God puts us back in order he said our brothers I don't know about that let me tell you something we were born out of order is that right take about think about it think about it when they caught this woman in in in adultery Jesus didn't see uh she he was she what he saw was a woman out of order a seed out of order everybody else saw some evil Jesus looked beyond all of that and saw a Daughter of Zion y'all hear what I'm saying what did he do he put her by back in order first of all he did what where are your accusers is that right that's the word the word says who's going to lay the charge to God's elect it is God who justify it hallelujah it's not a man it's God is that right and when God saved you he justifies you as though you've never sinned in the first place who's going to blame the Bible said when it comes to the Judgment they can't bring you will be the one that will judge them Psalms 19 1-14 I've got to move faster the heavens declare the glory of God in the firmament showeth his hand it works day unto day out of the speech at night and tonight showeth knowledge there is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard their line is going out through all the Earth and their words to the end of the world in them have he set a tabernacle for the sun in other words everything is in order we he said it declares his glory is that right the Stars it's the truth he said Abraham look at the Sand look at the sand of the sea see can you count them no Abraham you can't I want you to look up now amen and see the stars because just as you see the sand so are the stars and these be your seed listen there's a star in the heaven that represents you laughs and that star was there before I was born that star was dead when I was born y'all understand me I had to be born when I was born I could not have been born in April I could not have been born in May I had to be born in January because that's where my star lay is that right that's why Jesus couldn't be born in December he was the Lamb of God he had to be born in the spring somebody help me that's the truth because the star that represented him was only in that position when he was born so is your stars you know they used to say oh somebody just passed when you see a falling star you ever heard that that's an old that's a fable but it you know I mean people used to say that when I was young or somebody's going to die they that's what they said because they liking it as as a star falling and I think in the age of Egypt when they would see such a thing they thought it was the fall of King in the rise of a king so you know everything has a meaning I'm not an astrologer or anything I don't know nothing about that stuff but I do know one thing that Bible tells us there are lines has gone out through all the Earth and their words to the end of the world in them have he set a tabernacle for the son and basically he's saying everything is connected everything every Sun every Star every Moon every Galaxy whether you see it or not there's a line of some sort connecting them he said which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoices as a strong man to run a race you know brother Brandon preached that right he said when that sun comes up it's like a baby early in the morning this week it's bright it comes on afternoon day it's like a strong man and the evening is really really you know now it's in the evening is now dying out and then it dies and it raises back up what the Bible says it he's going forth his from the end of the heavens and his circuit unto the ends of it and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof Hallelujah and they say the star the son stands still and God says it's on a circuit that's all I'm saying we don't know we don't understand it but I know one thing the Bible is right the law of the Lord is perfect converting the soul the testimony of the Lord is sure making wise to simple you say why are you preaching this brother Brooks because the Lord spoke to my heart when God gives you space to repent and you don't repent he moves on I can't keep preaching repent repent repent because God has a bride he's working with and she's repenting she's doing exactly what his words say do Hallelujah the statue of the laws are right rejoicing the heart the Commandment of the Lord is pure enlightening the eyes the fear of the Lord is clean enduring forever the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous all together right let me let me give you an extra illustration of God's judgment David did what he did with that she and he killed bathsheba's husband and God in his order could have come down because David was a prayer Warrior God could have come down and said David you was wrong but God even was subject to his own order he had a prophet in the land so he had to go by way of the Prophet to go to David you see what I'm saying and said David there's a man in your kingdom who took somebody you lamb that's all he had dressed and fed it treated like his own and guess what a man came by and took it and and killed it and used it for his own service David said that man ought to die you see his judgment was harsh more hard amen than God's judgment was and that's what happens sometimes amen our judgment is harsh but God's judgment is loving kindness I mean you know what I'm saying to his seed ah it's the truth he had already judged Peter and said Peter you're going to deny me three times and see because you're going to deny me I'm going to take the keys back no he told Peter those things so Peter could see how Wicked he was perhaps that's what helped him at the day of Pentecost to get the Holy Ghost all I know is that God always works in your favor the Bible said all things work together for the good of them that love the Lord that's the world order of God no weapon formed against you shall prosper that's the order of God Hallelujah it may look like they're getting away but God will meet them at a time they think not is that right oh God always hard in the hearts of your enemy yeah they become like a pharaoh to you but you know Pharaoh got drowned in the mercy they got plenty of songs he got drowned in the Red Sea right but God allowed those things to happen so that you can understand and see him as God a lot of times it ain't the devil is God working in your life to perfect you trust the Lord with all your heart and lean not to your own understanding acknowledge the Lord in all your ways and he shall direct your path order it if you want to say it Hallelujah thank you Jesus Hallelujah Hallelujah more to be desired are they than gold yay then much fine gold sweeter also than honey in in the honeycomb and I feel like I'm taking some sweetness tonight amen moreover by them as thy servant warned and in keeping of them there is a great reward see what I'm saying that's his judgment he warns you and by keeping them he says there is a great reward oh Lord have mercy so when the Devil comes to try to tempt you against your arm I'm Gonna Keep the word cause I'm looking for my reward Hallelujah who can understand this era cleanse thou me from Secret faults listen I got some secrets false I got some things I'm yet still doing did that take away from him being the Son of God did that take away from him being a king no Hallelujah but what was so mighty about this King he was humble enough to say Lord I got a problem Lord I got some secret stuff going on and please deliver me from these secret faults come on somebody keep back the servant also whom from presumptuous sin let them not have dominion over me is that right that's what Jesus Christ died for that sin will no longer have dominion over you if you got something amen that's constantly amen overruling you and overriding on you you have a right to take it to the Lord in prayer Hallelujah says Lord you said sin will not have dominion over me Hallelujah and you're the king of all Kings hallelujah amen amen then shall I be upright and I shall be innocent from the great transgression Hallelujah this is what he says let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be accepted in thy sight O Lord my strength in my redeemer Hallelujah God's order right God's order and we must understand in God's order he's always separating the darkness from the light Hallelujah you love the Lord amen coming from the message amen uh uh exposition of the seven Church ages amen what God talks about separating from the light and you and I must understand the only way that you've become separators that you've got to become a believer not a make-believer you got to believe it you know a lot of people look at the days of Noah and you think why didn't they believe look how what Noah was preaching seemed impossible how can this ever be we've never seen what you call Rain water coming from it no we've never seen that and you build in this big old Bowl and you're saying that water is going to flood the whole earth you see how impossible you see how listen with that intellectual mind that the people had in that day it was impossible for anybody to make believe that they believed it oh they couldn't that give had to come from God and look what he came I ended up with he may have had a mega church at the beginning because everybody loved loved to hear different stuff even the day the itching is they want to hear all kinds of stuff you know the Bible said this is the day that people love for the preachers to preach their eyes to them the Bible says that the people even know that they're lying but they love to hear it because it gives them a comfort they don't want to change because they can't change Hallelujah and they'd rather have a preacher preacher than lies and tell them all you're going to make it you're going to make it and they know within their souls they're not going to make it but they try to comfort themselves this is what the prophet said now why does God call and I'm skipping a lot of things I've got to move this way why does God call these churches his churches even though they are the false Vine the truth of the matter is that they are Christians but they are not Christians of the spirit they are Christians of the flesh they are bearing the name in vain Mark 7 7 says how be it in vain do they worship me teaching the doctrine of and Commandments of men but indeed they are Christians for what else could they be is a Muhammad that is his religion no matter how he lives if because he subscribes in theory to what the Quran teaches in the same way a Christian is a Christian as long as he subscribes to the fact that Jesus is the son of God born of a virgin was crucified and died and rose again that he is savior of mankind Etc in fact in the lay of the sin age there will be those who call themselves Christians because they've subscribe to Divine qualities of Jesus while reserving themselves the right to deny his deity Christian Science have done that already as well as multitudes who preaches a social gospel he is a nominal Christian and belonged to the church but he is not a true or spiritual believer that kind of believer is one who has been baptized into the body of Christ and is a member of him but nonetheless it is in God's order that the tears grow with the wheat and they are not to be uprooted that is the Commandment of God their day for binding and burning is coming but not yet you see and we worry we go through all of this we all the people in church what about people in church I don't know who you are but I don't have the authority to uproot nobody he said let them grow together and God will do it so the spirit is speaking to the mixed group on the one hand he is praising and on the other hand he is rebuking he has told what is right with the True Believer now he warns what the false Vine must do if it is to stand Justified before the Lord so he's a just God he tells the truth and he tells what is required let's go back to the to Genesis he told Cain what was required he was a different Vine he was a different man came from a different dad and but there was nothing in him that could repent there was nothing in him that could be real even though he was religious he did all the religious things but he could not catch the revelation of the blood of Jesus Christ that's why I love that song tonight I was electrified amen when we say nothing but the blood of Jesus what can wash away my sins nothing but the blood of Jesus what can make me whole again nothing but the blood of Jesus oh how precious is the flow that makes me white as snow see it ain't me it's his blood it's his life his anointing that makes me who I am listen and we've got to come up to this anointing now we too start you in this place hello somebody we're too starchy in this place and I'm gonna tell you something you can never get out of order as long as you're in the spirit of God let me let me let me read something brother Randall said here amen coming from the message infallible proof of his resurrection Hallelujah 1957. um he talks about the brooding the brooding what was happening in in the beginning of time when God brewed over the Earth he said the word brooding means making love and when the Holy Spirit made love to the calcium and potash petroleum of the earth and formed it together and made a human being out of it then in return as human beings recognized him and and makes love back to him with a promise that he would raise up in the last days and what kind of Faith should we have all the fear is taken away why you can bury me in the sea but the trumpet will wake me no matter where how far what take place we are going to come from the Dust y'all hear me amen it's not about you it's God's order if God is saying he's going to change this Mortal body amen into more immortality nothing can stop him now improve with God gave us the consolation that through the righteous Son of God right who shared his blood never like to use the name split because split is a is an accident he never accidentally done it he knowed what he was doing and he did it for for a purpose and he shed his blood freely as Calvary giving his his god-given gift give given blood now I'm gonna go back to brooding just for a moment you know if you ever seen people and they just praising God oh hallelujah hallelujah what is the holy spirit doing he's brewing over them he's watching them he's cleaning them he's doing something you can't hear him talking but the person that's in that brewing in that anointing can hear him speak Hallelujah and the reason that God requires blood and the lamb was fought and told me from making a perpetuation for our sins in a shallow form but never could take away sin because the blood of animals couldn't atone for the sin of man it was only a type because the worshiper was purged from would have no more conscience or desire of sin in this case the worshiper once purged has no more desire of sin we don't desire it but the reason why we fall because of sin in the flesh Hallelujah but our soul always want to do right Hallelujah the sin question settled when the Holy Ghost come into the human heart it casts down reasoning it goes above our intellectual Affair now today the reason so many ups and downs and things are are entered the religious people because there's an intellectual concept of Christ in other words it's in their mind and not in their heart see it they just mentally believe it and your Mentor will reason could it be so could Divine Healing be so could the baptism and holy spirit be so now that's the intellectual reason but when that comes into the heart it's a faith it's a positive there's no question at all about it it's all settled forever it's in your heart and your heart doesn't reason because it's the throne that dwell in place of the almighty in the heart huh it doesn't reason God doesn't reason his word God is a amen hallelujah yes sir this is God's order now God's order is the blood there I don't care how much religion you have I don't care how long you've gone to church pay your tithes your offering I'm telling you you've got to have the blood of Jesus Christ applied this is God order when I see the blood I'll pass over you we know he's not dealing with the litter of blood anymore but it's the Holy Ghost which is the life of the blood Hallelujah not Amen in the outer Court not in the inner Court it has to be in the holies of holies where that true heart is amen listen in the message Hallelujah God provided way 1964. brother random said it like this God recommends this for his children God recommend this for believing children he did not intellectual speeches not some great theology the theology to teach he wants you to cry for your knees that's right cry out for it you're too stiff and start you you'll never get it if you are ready to limber yourself up a little and cry God will give it to you he's like to hear his children cry your knees to God God wants it that's his provided way cry out for it that's the way the baby cries that's the way he wants you to cry cry how long how long does a baby cry until he gets satisfied and that's the way the believing Christians should do God's child if you see that God made the promise don't give it up cry until it answers cry until you go till you see God vindicate his word when God vindicates his word and proves it here then you don't have to cry no more you got it walk away and thank him for it until you do that scream out till you get it I like that persistent holding on not a hybrid plant not one that has to baby and Petty and pack around Christians are real genuine born articles of God they fight for their position fight till they're finished on this Earth every move of it is a fight that's God's order and you know we've had these intellectual teachers amen that took all of that from us took it away you don't have to do all of that we're in another age yes we are but I'm gonna tell you something before you can get any other age you got to get a new one the one before you you got to be born again and you got to have the Holy Ghost and brother William said there's only one way Acts 2 38 babies know how to come forth that's screaming and Hauling right they don't like that in the church no more everything is too quiet too stiff this church got to change the people around here must change Hallelujah don't worry about what your neighbor is saying don't worry about who's looking at you amen you got to close everybody out and become you and Jesus God's order is that right he said you can try to teach a baby how to do things when they come to his mom say you can ring the bell or whatever you want to do call his name it won't ever work that baby has one way of of getting Mama attention and that's crying that's the way it is with God Hallelujah say I don't know how to cry you ask God he'll give it to you you stay there and he'll bring it on you amen but crying ain't gonna do you no good either if it's not coming from your heart you know actors can cry right but this got to come from the heart oh yes Jesus that was fresh folks that was fresh amen especially about the actors that's pretty good hey right Amos 3 7 God hasn't provided way surely the Lord God will do nothing but he Reveals His Secrets unto his servants the prophet Prophet we know how that is Hallelujah when there's a prophet in the land god comes by way the prophet Hallelujah who's going to tell Noah how to build Ark who is going to refuse you know me everybody that refused Noah message drowned everybody that refused Moses wet message got killed right listen there's an order God can talk to us and he does talk to us personally but my point is when it comes to his order he must set things back in order remember Elijah had to put the altar back in order right because they hadn't had that it was it was torn down but he had to re-establish the order so that you can understand alter so that you can understand that the altar is is not just wood and and stuff it's your heart it's your heart that's where your art the real all of that was it was shadows and type but now God wants to enter in you he wants you to be the Tabernacle he wants you to be the holies of holies where he sets in your heart that's the order and the only way you can get him there is through justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost and then you got to mature into Christ God's church is built upon divine revelation we didn't understand that this is why how so many theologians are so mixed up because they're so intellectual and they don't even believe in Revelation but listen God built his church Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it right listen you think about what I'm trying to say I believe the church is built upon divine revelation Hallelujah you remember you remember uh let me let me read this this quote it's another one Elijah and the prophet Amen 1956. brother William said as she was inspired talking about the shunamite woman to do something for this man I can hear her say one day to her husband now look dear well we can do this we have plenty we have great farms and so forth we're able to do this and what was it the shooter might want to build a little room for Elijah and the husband said we can do this we can afford it amen you know what people don't understand is that uh how you treat each other there's always a reward for it not that you're doing it for the reward because a True Believer never think about what's coming after they just do it right amen and I I just say I don't know what God is getting ready to do but I'll just say for those both of the churches from from Iowa City and here in the morning and how they blessed me the other day I mean to me I don't know what God is going to do but I really believe a blessing is coming yes I mean they did it because my my sister died and all that but it was it was wonderful and to see all those people crowding my house on Saturday and Sunday it was wonderful I can't even get all of them at church one time but to know listen the atmosphere was awesome and I really believe God has a special blessing for that didn't do it for a blessing but I believe a blessing is coming he's the judge his judgment is true his judgment is real and if there be anything I ask God that he would bless him with and that would be the fill us all with the Holy Ghost give us a Revival in this church Hallelujah that's what we want if I had anything to do with it I want to see everybody born again Hallelujah she was inspired we have plenty now we both believe in Jehovah and this is his servant now let's do something nice for him and in doing for him we're doing for Jehovah after all you're getting aged and I'm in the middle aging so it won't be long till it all falls somewhere and we have no children or nothing to go to so let's just do something nice for Jehovah by entering his PR uh entertaining his Prophet you see what they did they didn't say let's do something for Elijah they said let's do something for Jehovah that's that's the revelation of it like when you when you when you're doing something for each other you're doing it for Jesus you're not doing for brother so and so or sister so and so you're doing it as unto the Lord and when you do it eyes unto the Lord whatever you reap whatever you sow you're going to read that's God's law that's God's order Hallelujah she knew that God was in the God was in that this prophet and she wanted to give respect to God and the only way she could give respect to God was respect the servant of God see that's the problem there's so many people in the message in this church in that church that don't know how to respect the Servants of the Lord but I believe God saw something God put something in their heart and I tell you to that Saturday and Sunday was the most respect I had ever seen since I've been pastoring these churches and the only way we you can give respect to God was to respect the servant of God now friends that's the way you do it is when you respect God's order that's true you love the Lord ah so much more I could I could preach it's just 8 47 can I go on so that you understand you can't put new wine in Old bottles well that's that's the problem with a lot of people they they want to carry things over carry this over we've got methodists in the message Catholics in the message Baptist in the message Pentecost in the message and and they don't want to go no further but this this message came for us to clean up everything it's got to be a new bottle you got to get rid of everything really everything Hey listen new wine it can only be put in new new Pentecostal bottles it's amazing all those bottles Pentecostals God had 120 of them gathered into the upper room after he had all by his word and has softened up and had renewed and got all that oh I thought Orthodoxy out of them all of the old system and God had 120 bottles laying in the upper room when with their necks up and a funnel on the top and when the Holy Spirit began to Reign these bottles got so alive until they began to run outside preaching the gospel bouncing from place to place and one jumped on a stump and said this is that right back with the word this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joelle it shall come to pass in the last day said God I'll pour out my spirit my new wine into my new bottles water revival they were having that's God's order here comes a couple of bottles of it amen bursting bad and they're laid an Afflicted man and when this Afflicted man touched their hands of one of these why his afflicted left hand and he and God's and he got some of it and began leaping and praising God and running into the temple shouting and glorifying God you know the Holy Ghost can't change the Holy Ghost does not change brother Adam said no matter which where where you go when the Holy Ghost fall it makes the people act the same way something's wrong something's wrong um we don't love him like we used to somehow we don't forgot how good it used to be he said that's God's order now then tonight you believe that that's God's order that's not man so if God is ordered it he can't change his mind about the order not a big school with a degree but a living acting experience of the Holy Spirit not fanaticism but the real genuine Holy Spirit put in action may you see it is my prayer huh making love up to the Holy Ghost how long has been since the Holy Ghost has fallen in this place and all we could do is just oh Lord have you remember that one day not long ago is it like everybody was on one Accord that was such a beautiful nobody wanted to leave that was just just a tip tip it could go way beyond that Hallelujah oh my can you imagine people don't even want to they don't even look for days like that no more when the sick come in they be healed the Bible said thus said the Lord if there'll be among your sick call for the elders let them anoint them with all and pray for them the by the prayer of faith shall save the sick and again it is written in the script that these signs shall follow them that believe they lay hands on the sick they shall recover and we're taught listen my my thing is this I believe the message come to bring us into a maturity but it never come to your race what God has already established it never come to take away God what God's order from things matter of fact we ought to be more mature and have more faith and have more prayer right not wavering like James said mature and to know that every situation is still under God's control Hallelujah is that right that's the way the Church of the Living we should walk up to people sick and everything else no fear well I haven't heard him say anything what are you talking about the Bible didn't already commission you go ye therefore to all the world preaching the gospel and that's what Paul did he said I didn't come with Excellence of speech I came with power and demonstration that's the gospel doesn't mean that the individual listen what President says he said it doesn't mean that the individual that is praying must be a saint or an angel it means that that person that's coming must have faith in their own being that the Holy Spirit and his cooing by his word has dropped a little something in there that makes them believe that he will Brew over them until they are well um Hallelujah yeah I guess I'll I'm gonna cut it short but I'm a listen what the scripture says according to Romans 8 and 11. but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised of Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you so am I say like this the reason why God had to come in 1963 in the way that he did come because laodicea had gotten out of order they used to be the church you understand me they represent bastard and vastly had all the gifts vasty was beautiful God bragged on vasty did not King of hasura brag on vasty she had it all but she failed to come at the king's call they looked at William Branham and thought it was just a man but it was God calling later to see a cop come on vasty I want to show the world she has no idea how great she would have been has she come to the call Hallelujah but then there was a little girl about you know didn't have a a a a known name and we know her her uncle was Mordecai and here a little girl I'm trying to think of her name I can't think I know I know Esther but I'm trying to think of the name before then Odessa yes couldn't couldn't couldn't couldn't couldn't nobody knew who she was that's who somebody didn't know I knew her but God did who was judging all of that he thought oh they were the judge he probably had all kinds of Judges there God had already judged he knew Odessa was going to be the queen he knew that before before she even got there he knew that what was it God's order God was doing something typing and shadowing and making people act in certain ways so that we this day can look back and says we got victory is already in the word we don't need to be popular and you know this is the truth because vasty was having her own party right and that's what the Pentecostal churches were doing they were having their own parties they were having their own revivals and guess what they even shut the king out here they was here he was on the in the third chapter of Revelation knocking trying to get in thank God for Odessa who became Esther Hallelujah and Esther had to go through something to find her position but she found her position Hallelujah I'm closing we which are alive and remain shall not prevent or hinder those that are asleep dead for the trumpet of God shall sound the dead in Christ shall rise we which Our Lives shall shall be changed in a moment or twinkling of eye and the old man will be young the old woman will be young again and will be conditioned to meet the promise coming son Glory Hallelujah the next thing in God's order do y'all understand that's the next thing in God's order I I'll have to finish this later on but brother Brown said God's order to men is stay in his place God ordered to the woman stay in their place too you can't take a man's place they're trying to do it but don't do it men don't take the Woman's Place don't dress like women and women don't dress like men the Bible says it's wrong to do that the Bible said a woman that puts on a garment pertaining to a man is filthy before God an Abomination see but now you can't hardly tell one from the other see now how are you going to do but just call out against it see well when you do that see did you see the courts the other day now hear the prophet of saying something here this is this is this is this is really bad here in Indiana this is a long time ago what a shame less than 15 years ago a family were in Port Fulton I think some of the families sitting here tonight here in Port Fulton they sent a girl a little girl home from school for wearing for wearing shorts to school they said to home in my day you couldn't wear shorts to school in my day a girl could not wear pants to school in my day for girl wore a dress above her knee she was sent home now this is the South we call it the Bible Belt but that's that was when things were moral that's not too long ago now you can't get a girl in a dress and what they call shorts is not shorts they're underwear right but they sent this little girl home from school for wearing shorts or scoots this week they tried to Sue and put out put out of the school and they did it a little girl that refused to wear shorts in school what's the matter with our nation I thought this was this was a land of free I thought we had a right religious freedom the father stood up and said it's against our religion Rich religious belief for our children to wear shorts our little girls like 16 and 17 years old to wear shorts it's against our religion belief and they dismissed it it spelled the child from the school for for not where and I that was in my school too there were people who was in the Holiness Church who would not dress out for Jim because it was in a man and women and they they they they they uh they was uh suspended or pretty much expelled if they wouldn't change their mind I understand that everybody that won't won't agree uh and come in to the international agreement of this Fellowship that they're trying to form to put unite all churches together the Federation of churches that's all that want come in and Unite with it they make him a little Province they're going to send them to Alaska did you hear what he said they're making them a province and they're going to send them to Alaska you might as well get ready for cold weather because look like it's coming that's what they're going to do to the true Christians my lifelong friend Jim Poole his his son stands here tonight I wish his dad would only come in and do what his son did and we were talking today by telephone conversation and he was remarking about I believe a new uh commentator someone I don't remember just who it was he says now it used to be that that America people taking a bath and that's the truth American people taking a bath once a week and prayed every day I know that's true we took Baths on Saturdays once a week um and we didn't have a bathtub at the time we had a foot tub y'all know the footage of is one of those bigger tubs you put the hot water in no drainage to you you always want to be the first one because we watched with the lasso and all that dirt come up and you know scrape it off sanitation folks sanitation but that's the way it used to be and we bathe on Saturdays so we can go to church on Sunday clean right American people taking a bath once a week and prayed every day he said now they take a bath every day and pray once a week I believe it's rather no do without the bathroom brother I said I believe I would rather do without the bath but just show how we have fallen what happened to this nation hmm I gotta stop here but what has happened we're out of order we're out of order and God is trying to put us in order that's why it's so important for people to come to church because judgment begins at the house of God it's so important that people come and hear the word you don't even know when you're doing wrong sometime unless God comes because now the word is going Beyond this outer court is going into the holies of holies where your heart is because I'm going to tell you something when as long as you think God is punishing you you need to grow God is Not punishing his children God don't punish his children God May chasten you because the Bible said that he's chasing them whom he loved amen but punish you no it's like some kids you know when you when you whip them if you don't explain to them why they're whipping you uh whipping them they're going to thank you you're just being mean and you're punishing them you need to explain and then after you spank them you still need to hold true to what you just told them you're not going to play that game for another week or two but I said I'm sorry well it's got to go beyond that you need to understand why you're sorry in other words I'm trying to bring you to a repentance so that what you just did will not happen again that's the way God has been doing with us explaining to us talk to us and then you know when you don't listen he said and I did not tell you not to do that again pop right he comes along and give you a good spanking yeah sometimes it's a form of sickness sometimes it's a form of something some God he go he knows how to get to you let's stand I'm sorry I know I've taken the time but we appreciate you uh this is just the beginning I've got so many other things I'd like to contribute to the order of God because we want God's order in our lives we want to be just what God wants us to be and I really appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ for being good to us today tonight David said let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in my sight oh God oh Lord my strength and my redeemer
