we're going to be reading Revelations 21 9-11 then we'll go from there to First Peter 2 and9 and then one more scripture 1 John 44-6 you and I we realize that we're living in the last days and I believe by God's grace that God has something special for us and um we know and believe with our hearts that the Lord is soon to come uh the Bible tells us we don't know the day nor the hour but we we definitely can see that we're now living in the seizing of a translation I don't know about you but I'm making ready I'm preparing to be ready when he comes not by power not by might but by my spirit say the Lord and I believe with all of our hearts that all of us realize that tonight because many of the things that we might want to change in our hearts change in our lives we we know that we can't do it without the help of the Lord Revelations 21 9-11 and there came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven [Music] let's begin that again I don't know do you have a different mic I could use huh this is okay okay and there came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vows full of seven last plagues and talked with me saying come here the I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great City the holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from God having the glory of God and her light was like unto a stone most precious even like a jasper stone clear as Crystal 1 Peter 2 and9 but ye are are chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who have called you out of Darkness into his his his Marvelous Light His Marvelous Light which in time past were not a people but are now the people of God which had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained mercy first first John 4 we begin at the fourth verse of that particular uh book 1 John the 4th chapter beginning at the fourth verse ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you that he than he that is in the world they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them but we are of God he that knoweth God heareth us he that is not of God heareth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error let us pray our heavenly father we come before you Lord Jesus as humbly as we know how we thank you for being so good to us Lord we thank you for all that you have done for us you have been better to us Lord Jesus than we've been to ourselves father we give you thanks we give you glory we pray father God tonight that you would give us Grace and move out completely out of your way and we ask oh God that you would just please anoint us anoint your people give us the words Lord that you would speak or speak through our lips the words that you would want to speak Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated thank God for the uh song service we had beautiful songs by God's grace we appreciate that I I just uh have had to U entitled this a special class of people H if I had a subtopic this would it would be this this is what I call Glory when we talk about a special class of people you and I must realize that the class of people that we are are those whom God has chosen we know because of brother brandom tells telling us that we were chosen from the foundation of the world of course that is the scripture but he better explained it to us he illuminated that scripture so that we could better understand what it was all about many times I would read that scripture and not understand what it was saying because I know that God uh way he does things um it's quite different from the way we think he would do but we know that he election is something that God does and he alone and the Bible tells us that he's Sovereign and tells us that he's the only potentate he's the only he's the final authority of over all things right he is the maker and creator of all things and the Bible according to St John said nothing was made that is made without him brother random in the seven Church ages I believe uh the book of excuse me the revelation of Jesus Christ he began to talk about some things and I'm going to read this just to give it a little background on where we headed tonight now you know we've been dealing with The Arc of the Covenant we talked about the table uh according to um Psalms 23rd you know face to face um showing that in this hour in this day that's the kind of communication that God wants he wants an intimate relationship with you and this is why uh according to Revelations 10 he came down as the mighty Angel uh we saw and have seen uh the face of God Seven Angels amen actually came down and thundered out a message that was only meant for a special class of people the world in itself uh at this point in time has no idea of what's taking place uh because of their interpretations of the word that they have received d uh in their in their theology many people think that God is going to come down uh and thousands of people are going to be raptured and planes are going to wreck uh trains are going to crash boats are going to sink uh they just believe that at at that kind of drama that's the kind of drama that uh will take place at the Rapture and to be honest with you you won't find any Scripture to back that up that's right matter of fact the Bible tells us that it will be uh uh catching away and it's and it's a secret catching away uh so much so the Bible says no man know the day nor the hour and according to the prophet of Malachi 4 we understand that it will be such a small number of people that most of the people in the world won't even know that the Rapture has taken place but I'm began to read this because I really believe that something is taking place even right now and U I believe I'm in the Rapture I believe that God is Not only called me but he's transforming me even as we speak he says amen we know that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an in Invincible Army now remember brother ROM tells us about Greater Works he he talks about it's not like more of but he said here he used an an analysis and he used Jesus uh of yesterday and how Jesus turned the water into wine and how he fed thousands with a few fish and loaves of bread and he said in Jesus day even though he was God In the Flesh he took something and made something but in our day the same Jesus using the body of William brandom literally created squirrels out of nothing he stopped a storm he created things he gave a little fish life out of nothing and that was Jesus Christ in the son of man revealing himself self to this generation so we understand what the Greater Works in other words we we're God as he was in the beginning he took something he did he did something from nothing all right there was not something already there that God used it was by the spoken word that God created everything and so that's what we call Greater work she will be an invincible Army understand that this is prophecy if they get a true revelation of the two true Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God Spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit what is that Antichrist spirit that spirit that literally denies that Jesus has come in the flesh not just only in a prophet but in your flesh all right Satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely dwart today as when Christ with stod uh uh with stod his ever effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them now remember he starts out in this paragraph with the bride or the church coming into a true revelation of who she is that's right and then he comes along and says if we could just get that Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them he said you will recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book we are studying is the actual revelation of Jesus Christ himself in the church and his work is in the future ages now he says in the church he's not talking about a building he's talking about human beings in the church and he goes on to say Amen that it is the actual revelation of Jesus Christ himself in the church and his work in the future ages then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or we will fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real it is going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people that's where I got my thought from a people that is filled with the Holy Ghost like I said this this this is I if I I put this way this word is like unbaked bread Half Baked you get a little bit of something and understanding from it but with but you get the full Loaf the revelation of the full word if the shakina of Glory comes down right see you need the anointing to anoint the letter of the word it must come to life and it cannot come to life without the Holy Ghost this is why we have doctrines of divinity that still struggles with the godheads still struggle with the coming of the Lord they they they they they premen millenniums and post millenniums and whatever they they they just because because the Bible says that the Conor mind cannot understand those things which are spiritual all right it will take amen uh one with prophetic Insight it will require the ability to to hear from God it will require a supernatural instruction not a student comparing verses with verses though that is good but a mystery a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it'll never becomes clear how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and to know he he's always coming back to the spirit because it's not by power it's not by might but it's by his own Holy Spirit you the kind of mind this is why Christians we we we can't just read this Bible without prayer you the the anointing must flow in order for God to open up this word to you right as I have already said this book Revelation is the consummation of the Scripture it is even placed exactly right with the cannon of the scripture at the end now you can know why it says that Anyone who reads or even hear it is blessed it is the revelation of God that would give you authority over the devil and you can see why they who would add or take from it would be cursed it would have to be so for who can add or take away from the perfect revelation of God and overcome the enemy you can't you can't you have to have a perfect revelation of God in order to overcome the enemy it is that simple there is nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word see in verse three a blessing is pronounced on the this uh uh blessing is pronounced on those who give special attention to this book I think this refers to the Old Testament customs of the PRI reading the word to the congregation in the morning and you see many could not read uh so that the priest had to read to them as long as it was a word the blessings was there it didn't matter if it was heard read or heard amen so it's important that when you come to church you're literally being blessed when it's read you're being blessed when his preach is being blessed amen but the reason why I was kind of working in this area because I kind of worked uh the other day with the shoe bread and and I talked about the you know uh moving into this holies of holies and and I showed you by the grace of God that the only way that you'll know that the life of God is in you that because your spirit man will witness to the Inner Man and the holies of holies because there's no feelings in your soul the only thing that's in your soul is Faith or doubt and when faith is there it will show itself in the spiritual realm amen it's somehow you you come to a place and say I know that I know that I know that kind of a thing that I've been born again right all right so we understand by God's grace we are a a special kind of people and the reason being is because we have ears to hear is that right the Bible tells us that Jesus said amen that that there his sheep heareth his voice and a stranger they will not follow and we love this we love this message because we realize that we did not just become Sons and Daughters of God but even when we did not know him we were a son amen by way of his attributes it may have taking us a long while to come into the acknowledgment of Christ and Jesus Jesus Christ uh being our savior our Lord and our father but but but because of predestination you and I could not miss amen our appointment now I was uh want to read some uh another scripture let us read uh Genesis 49 and I'm not going to be long tonight hopefully I I just want to go here and because something is taking place and and God God has done a thing like I said e e even in the uh Arc of the Covenant uh you had uh I'm going to preach on the golden candlesticks tonight that's where I'm headed but but here this is just a little replica it's not it's nothing imperfection it's nothing what it really looks like because it's got a lot more designs and things on it uh but I just wanted you to know how that it actually was and and of course um all these uh arms and stuff uh basically pointed to this one because this is the main one of all the other six uh and I'll try to explain that tonight because I want you to understand that that this golden Candlestick doesn't represent seven people it represents one person and I'll read that to you in just a minute so you can understand that God is a tree too and he had branches but let's move on Jacob for uh excuse me Genesis 49 And1 it caught my attention even today uh here in the in the 49th chapter of Genesis the Bible said and Jacob called unto his sons and said Gather yourselves together that I may tell you that which befalls you in the last days now here's a prophecy hundreds of years ago given by Jacob who we know as Israel to his sons and he began to tell his sons what was going to take place in the latter day now it is it amazes me how people want to say that this Bible is not right but if it's not right why do you hate it why do you want to get rid of it uh the reason being because it is a love letter to the Bride of Jesus Christ chist and even though many people millions and millions of people will never come to understanded the Bride of Jesus Christ will and he says Amen in he and and so we know and and if you read uh here uh in in Genesis the 49th chapter he goes through all of his sons and blesses them and blesses them and blesses them and I don't really have time for all of that reading but tonight I want us to jump down to the eth verse because there's something that I have in mind to to bring forth by God's grace in the eth verse he says Judah Thou Art he whom thy Brethren shall praise thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies thy father's children shall bow down before thee Judah is a lion's WEP from the prey my son Thou Art gone up he stoop down he couches as a lion and as an old lion who shall Rouse him up the scepter shall not depart from Judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet until Shiloh come and unto him shall the Gathering of the people be and this is a major prophet and this a major prophecy excuse me that God has given to Judah and we know that Jesus Christ was of the line uh tribe of Judah and so so was David he came out of the tribe of Judah and of course Judah means praise or confession amen because remember during the time when David was in trouble Judah was one of those tribes uh that literally stayed with him and uh protected him fought for him and encouraged others to come and join him Judah played a great part now Judah wasn't even Judah wasn't even a part of the priesthood right but here we we know when it came to Aaron and Levi that was what God used in the priesthood but then God jumps over here and chooses Judah to bring Christ from who is the high priest of all things and understand by God's grace this is this is quite important that we might know that what God is doing in these last days amen he's pulling a priesthood together a people that will be under the anointing of of Judah that will stay with Christ regardless to what comes our way no matter how the battle is we're going to stick and stay because we are of the same tribe the same blood Hallelujah we are his people that's right all right so we realize amen that something is happening and and like I said you know we may know some of us may know all of the things that I'm getting ready to say today but I wanted to say these things because I'm I'm working with the the the you know I haven't taken everything in in the ark but I I'm just taking little things as we go and you know I want everybody to see that here we are in a place where God is preparing the table before our enemy and in this time and in this season we must know who we are where we came from and where we're going and the Bible tells us every bit of it and I wanted to take the golden Cath candlesticks tonight because a lot of us don't understand that the golden candlesticks were just not something that lit up the holy place but it was in shadowing type of something that was really great and in that shadowing typing Israel did not even see it themselves you know they saw all of the golden instruments and things that they had to make and form according to the way Moses did see it but to have a revelation of it they did not uh if they had only uh revelation of who that and their rituals was all about they never would have followed other gods and you see because that's the only thing that'll make you follow something else is when you don't have a true revelation of what you're following presently right because if the people understood that this message was not of a man but it was of God for ordained of God and and and only a special kind of people can hear it uh you know they would have never left because they would have seen that they were part of that special kind of people amen so I brought that up to say now listen here was the here was the thing the Bible said that the septer shall not depart from Judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet until Shiloh come and when Shiloh come which is Christ he is Christ and unto him shall the Gathering of the people be in other words there's a gathering when he comes not of just the G Iles but of the Jews as well and we understand that this message that's what brother brandom said he said this very same message that is calling the bride will be preached to the Jews 144,000 will have to hear the very message that you and I have heard amen that's right Moses and L would preach the same message excuse me let's go to Exodus 25:31 let's start there you love the Lord Lord Exodus 25:31 and thou shalt make a a Candlestick of pure gold I want you to notice the description of this of this pure goal beaten work shall the candlesticks be made his shaft and his branches his bows his knobs and his flowers shall be of the same excuse me in other words let for instance what he did what they what he did he says I'm going to give you a certain amount of gold you understand that it it's a limited amount of gold not that that's what God did I'm going give you a limited amount of gold and out of this gold I want you to form all of these pieces he couldn't give give them more than enough because it would have been an excess and he couldn't give them less because something would have come short and everything had to balance and be equal I mean whatever he formed in other words these uh uh all of the the you know we always say golden we said um candle sticks but the Bible doesn't say candle sticks it say say candle stick one golden candle stick six branches shall come out of the side of it three branches of the Candlestick out of the one side and three branches of the counter stick out of the other side and of course three bowls made like unto almonds with a knop and a flower in one branch and three bowls uh made like almonds in the other Branch with a knot and a flow so the six branches that come out of the Candlestick see and in the Candlestick shall be four bowls made like under almonds with their knops and their flowers and there shall be a knp unto under you know what a knp is you see that little piece that little little knot there that's basically what it is and of course these it was more than in just that one place but anyway I wish I had a better vision of this so you can B see what we're working with and there shall be a knp under the branches of the same and a knp under the branches of the same and a KN under the two branches of the same according to the six branches that proceeded out of the Candlestick in other words Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever no matter how and what ages these candle these uh branches represented uh they had to be the same because remember the gold was of one piece and all of these Ministries was made out of one piece of gold one body we you understand me and so everything had to be equal everything had to me be measured correctly and when it all came up to this no matter how long how long or short amen everything had to be right in the exact way that Moses saw it this is a powerful Revelation and and so we we know in the 36th verse it says their knops and their branches shall be of the same all it shall be of one beaten work of pure gold and thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof and they shall uhh light the lamps thereof that they may give light over against it and the tongues thereof and the uh um snuff dish thereof shall be a pure gold of a talent of pure gold shall he make it with all these vessels in other words that's all he gave him a talent of pure gold amen and I think that may weigh perhaps what a what a what a what a a uh five or six year old person may weigh of a talent of gold shall be M make it and with all these vessels and look that thou make them after their pattern which was showed thee in the mount now I'm going to go back here because something is being read here and and I want to make sure it's according to uh the way I have it in my Bible because there's really something I really want to bring out by God's grace that's why I don't I don't like revised stuff you love the Lord so anyway we'll just go ahead on we we see by God's grace that everything had to be made according to the pattern nothing could could uh uh take away uh from this and and we we're going to read by God's grace where this uh Candlestick was referred to as his his a is masculine so it had nothing to do with the feminine but it was his design and so uh you said what is a vision and and we know about what brother bam tells us that a vision is given to us amen it's it's symbolic some things like like like in the Book of Revelation all uh The Book of Revelation practically is given in in a symbolic way in other words in order to understand it there's a powerful Revelation behind find it but only God can give you that Revelation how many of y'all remember the time I think this individual had cancer and brother brandham was praying for the person and all of a sudden a a a rotten apple appeared in in the m a mid the middle of the air and he didn't know what it was and and and that that that uh uh Apple represented the the sickness of that person and you know he prayed and then all of a sudden the that was rotten became holy and that that gave victory over the the particular sin I mean the particular sickness so you and I must understand by God's grace that every time God show you something most of the time it's something that needs to be revealed you understand me now when we talk about the vision of the golden candlesticks or the vision of the lampstand we we'll go to Zachariah let's go to Zechariah so Zachariah seeing the same vision amen that uh that was given to Moses but he's seing this in his own time in his own day the very same vision and why was this golden Candlestick what what made this why was this not put into the holies of holies see because this represent Christ or I could say Christ in humanity that that's what this represent Christ in humanity where God used men to reflect his light and we know that the oil and the light and the lamps they always had to be lit right so we say oh what do you mean well when you find out amen that in the book of St Matthew the 25th chapter when the foolish virgins lamp went out it was it was symbolic that somewhere the oil was gone that's right and the oil represents the Holy Spirit everything was gold golden oil golden lamp gold and everything was gold and understand it was beaten gold wasn't something that was just you know manufactured no no no no it was go try like the Bible says come in Revelation 3rd Chapter receive this word you'll be like gold tried in the fire beaten WTH gold that's what God uses he takes deity that's that's full of dirt and he beats the dirt out of you and that's what God has done for us because of these human bodies starting with uh Zechariah the 4th chapter beginning the first verse and the angel that talked with me came again and waked me as a man that was waken out of sleep and said unto me what seeth thou and I said I looked and behold a candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and see what I'm saying and his seven lamps thereof thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side of the bowl and you said well who are these olive trees well what is this all about it's all about the ministry of Christ from Genesis to Revelation it's about what Jesus Christ was going to do and here he had this golden Candlestick representing himself and basically telling us what he was going to do but without a prophet you wouldn't know you wouldn't understand it and so God goes to Zechariah and says he gives him a vision and he sees it now understand Zachariah is a Jew he've seen the golden Candlestick was part of perhaps part of the service he may not have been able to handle it because of the the the priesthood but my point is he's seen it all the Jews know what the Candlestick look like you know we call it the manure but the point is God is saying I want to draw your attention to this so that you can understand what this is is all about all right and he says uh it goes on it says and the two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof so I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these Lord since you're bringing this to my attention tell me what they are cuz I have no idea and that's the way it is with Israel they they had the rituals uh they they they didn't understand what it was all about if the Jews would have known that these animals that were being slain and killed and their blood was being shed uh was for the remission of their sins if they fully understood that they would have never given God lamed animals for sacrifice and Israel throughout history got to the place they tried to commercialize God uh Salvation And when they commercialized it they lost all the feeling there was nothing there that's why God said with your mouth you praise me you give me thanks with your mouth but your heart is far from me because they be it became such a religion they lost touch with God right there's a time when the shikina glory would come down and they would be so you know excited about it but you did you ever notice for for hundreds of years the shakina glory didn't show up and it didn't bother Israel you understand me it didn't bother them they went on with their religion and see when the Holy Ghost doesn't come in your service you ought to be concerned when the Shaka doesn't come down that means something ain't quite right the sacrifice something's out of order something's out of place and and because God is not sitting down and dropping his fire but find out even in the message we get to a place well it's okay it's we we like it's religion you know we got it I'm I'm message I'm right but you see that's the wrong attitude God don't want your feelings just like how can I say it like this he when it comes to Samson in the Book of Judges brother bandam say Samson gave God his strength God but God wanted his heart God don't need oh I can be this I can be that in the church oh I can move chairs I could be the all of that's good but God that doesn't what God wants us to do is give his heart even if you're not doing anything give God your heart never ever let this message become common to you that's right when it becomes common you become lukewarm and God is now in a position to spew you out of his mouth mhm H so I answered and spake of to the angel that talked to me saying what are these my Lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and I said no my Lord you understand me here was Zachariah who should have known amen what they meant somebody was lacking in their spiritual Revelation somebody was lacking in their standing because that's the way the angel was answered to him as if he should have known what that was all about excuse me what that was all about and he did not then he answered and spake unto him saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by might not by power but by my spirit sayth the Lord hallelujah why because you must understand that this was the main source of all of the others and even though they ministered one to another this is why it was built this way to show that these were connected so much so that Revelation says that he had them in the palm of their hand his hands seven Messengers amen but one body inspired by what one Holy Spirit and to show you that this really tied all the way into the Old Testament brother R tells us he said Moses was Christ David was Christ all of those who did Mighty Works were Christ they were representatives of Zabo and zorub means Amen to to to to disperse right and and and listen what was this whole thing about even though you were born in bondage because the theu also means a stranger in Babylon is that right and remember Israel was a stranger in Babylon why because they had fallen to the wickedness of of the world and God judged them for it but it didn't matter whether they were born there or not God still raised up people like Shadrach me and abedo David I mean excuse me um and the rest of them Daniel and all what was it God you know he was showing listen oh that there might be a great Mountain standing before you but he says listen I'll make that mountain a plain see that's what God is saying to the real seat of God it doesn't matter zerubu is here amen Jesus Christ is here the almighty God had already set it out in a in a plan and nothing can come short of what he purposed it to be nothing right then he answer and SP to him he said this is the word of the Lord of to not by my power not well whose power who is it from what what but by my spirit not by your theology not by your church not by your strength nothing you can produce that's going to make this thing happen the only way it's going to happen is by my spirit amen absolutely he said Thou Art who art thou oh great Mountain before zerubu thou shall become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shouting Grace Grace unto it what was it two comings of Christ God is bringing Grace to us he brought Grace in The Becoming when he first came and he brings Grace when he comes down again Hallelujah now you say well what do you mean the two coming of Christ remember when you say you see the scripture says with shouting that means amen God had a forerunner he always had a forerunner he had Elijah he had John the Baptist in the first Forerunner right right he said the Bible said crying one crying in the wilderness that was John the Baptist is that right and the second coming he had another crying another shouting crying what Grace Grace who was it William brandham he comes along and he's the second but he's Elijah he's Elijah The Same Spirit who you said well what do you mean that's what the Bible says now who was the two all branches who are they who are they remember Moses and Elijah that's who they are amen Moses amen was a how can I say it a represented Christ in other words it he was so connected to even when Jesus came they were saying did Moses say this yall understand me and then who was the other Elijah right Moses and Elijah amen from the beginning to the ending amen was the representatives of Christ until Jesus Christ came himself you said I don't believe that didn't follow me to Mount Transfiguration Amen on Mount Transfiguration amen what was it it was Moses and Elijah standing there by the Candlestick Hallelujah and Jesus showed that the power of the Candlestick did not come from Moses it did not come from Elijah but the Bible said when that Peter James and John looked up all they did see was Jesus only see he is the Candlestick hallelujah what is it what was it Moses was a lawgiver is that right he represented the dead in Christ in other words Moses and Elijah represented the full ministry of Jesus Christ himself in his he came the Bible said he the dead in Christ shall rise is that right and those that remain they shall be what quickened so Moses represented the dead in Christ his ministry he was a lawgiver is that right and and that's what it was because he died something happened to him but he rose again even so much so that the devil looked for his body and could not find him Hallelujah but when it came to Elijah he was a quickening huh is that right amen he rose on the Char of fire right he took a Rapture Hallelujah without death see so they two were standing there by Jesus himself Hallelujah so what happens when Jesus come for his bride and quickens us and take us up he still leaves the representative of himself Moses and Elijah and I got back I don't got ahead of myself oh my is that right moreover the word of the Lord came to me saying the hand of zerubabel have laid the foundation of his house his hand shall also finish it is that right so zerubabel is a type and a representative of Jesus Christ himself he is the Builder he is the maker he said I go to prepare a place for you that where I am there you might be also and he that begun the good work in you is faithful to complete it only one only one not two not three just one who's creating and is that right the Bible says we are created in him Hallelujah right the hand of zba have laid the foundation of this house his hand shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts have sent me unto you right so zerubu represents everyone who helped build this house from Genesis to Revelation right and zerubba as I said means a stranger at Bon it also means to disperse confusion and that's exactly what Elijah did especially when it came to Jezebel right he stood there on Mount carel And he says all for the Lord he said I want you to build an altar and I'll build an altar and they all had the same kind of stuff he said but one was claiming to be of God and and one the other one's claiming to be of God he says I tell you what let the god that answer by fire Hallelujah let him be God and that's the what the prophet of God is saying right now now amen the go those who are right before God God will answer them by fire he can't change Hallelujah it doesn't matter what everybody else is claiming to be but Mount Zion Showdown is the one the fire falls on Hallelujah glory to God right so what happens brother ROM comes and he disperses all the confusion godhead marriage and divorce cre ation everybody think you you you came from a monkey or something no there was no Evolution as such we know when we came by by the spoken word of God all right so you know all of those kind of things that that we we didn't understand how the church got in such a fix how you know because in the earlier days they thought the white Hearts writer was Jesus Hallelujah and we find out through the opening of the word the white horse rider was not Jesus it was the Antichrist he was a guy disguising himself because it's turned from white to Red Hallelujah from red to Black then from all those colors came mixing what was it when that horse finished riding his name changed and now he was called death and so we understand what was it it was a spiritual Antichrist coming in now what you what are you saying this candelabra I'll put it this way this Manor right one of the things that it was used for it sheded light not only in just the holy place but it gave light to the entrance to the holies of holies and without this you couldn't see nothing right and understand that that seven Church age messenger Hallelujah was the light there shall be light in the evening time it wasn't him it was the Life of Christ shining through him one oil ain't there no changeing no you know seven different kind of Holy Ghost ain't number one Holy Ghost and all that oil has to be all in this same oil I can't get a different holy ghost in the man before me no sir no sir see so what was it you and I were born into Babylon born in captivity but God brought us out Hallelujah and guess what he's going to finish the building for who have despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubba with those seven eyes they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro from the whole earth and we know what that is the seven spirits of God the seven Church age Messengers and you know all that God has done throughout the age ages amen it was still the eye of God watching the allseeing eye watching and seeing everything now what thing that I love about uh uh uh Elijah is that because Elijah had the spirit of judging and he judged Jezebel and he told Jezebel what was going to happen to her the dog is going to lick your blood right and we know who Jezebel is right right we know Ahab was was the Pentecostals and Jezebel was the Catholics right now what's happening now they're moving in such a way and guess what they coming after us right and you remember the the time when je uh the mount Karma showed down how that uh Elijah was just powerful powerful as soon as he come down amen he heard that Jezebel was coming after him Jezebel gonna kill you boy what happened he ran he was afraid why because the anointing had left him see we ain't nothing without the anointing nothing nothing no matter how powerful you think you are you're nothing and let me tell you something no one Church nothing will be able to stop the Catholic Church in his move except Jesus Christ himself that's your Bible yeah now I'm going get in trouble with this after a while because it's getting pretty close to his coming and and the closer he gets the more dangerous these words become but it's still truth is truth what you going to do about it we're not against people it's the system right it's not the people there's wonderful people in those churches I've got friends like that but you see what you it's not listen the Protestant churches are worse than the Catholic now oh what they do Catholics wouldn't dare do not in church but anyway let's move on so we understand the daughters is like the mother right so we find out amen that what happened is we see those seven eyes where the which which which the the word of God came the seven Thunders the Seven Seals all those things were part of that grand revelation of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever then answered I and said unto him what are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlesticks and upon the left side and I just told you and he answered again and said unto him what be these two Olive branches which through the two uh two golden pipes empty uh the the golden oil out of themselves and so what was it he was saying they they so remember brother Rand was that kind that literally emptied himself out especially when the discernment came they had to pick him up they had to carry him out he says it ain't me it's him but whatever was in him he gave it all to the people and what was it he was pouring out the oil amen and that oil as as God uh replenished it he was pouring it out and there was such a relationship between Elijah and Jesus Christ that can I put it this way no wedge could come between them and there were times amen when the prophecies went out Moses and Elijah is in the building I'm sure everybody was looking around but there was a revelation behind that because Christ was Moses and Elijah that's right Hallelujah so let's move on you love the Lord then he goes on and said in the 13th verse and he answered me and said knoweth thou not what these be and I said no my Lord then he then said he these are the two anointed ones that stand by the lord of the whole earth so who was the one in the middle stood in the middle even according to Revelations he was in the midst of the golden candlesticks it was him he was the one Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that's why when the prophet of God God gave him the reation that Jesus Christ of the new uh Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the new y'all get what I'm saying you know when did God lose his power when did God lose his authority when did God forget where you are and what you're doing where when did God Amen blink and and and and didn't didn't see what you were doing in other words he's all and in all amen and the same anointing that flow through these seven golden candles St must flow through us right Hallelujah prophecy right that's what this this was all about was The Prophecy of the Messiah and his working it was the completion of the ministry of Jesus Christ and we didn't know that but in when God worked with Zachariah because now he's showing Zachariah is more to the manora than you think it's not just you going in there or priest going in there and light n you know making sure that there's this thing never goes out it was more to it and he showed that this represented Jesus Christ gold beaten gold fashion and and and and and all you know it was a it was a certain amount of gold which was a talent that He had to make not only this but all of the others pieces so you say what how can it be I don't know the figures I don't know the mathematics but it does show one thing that everything that was made from that go was symbolic that everything came from God everything came from God it was deity in the beginning and his deity in the end see amen Zachariah was the what was the Fulfillment of Zachariah that's that was Mount uh Matthew 17 and I'm on one time even though Zachariah Saw s symbolically what was going on the Fulfillment of his vision was on Mount Transfiguration let's read it beginning 17 Matthew 17 1-5 and then I'll be pretty much done and this is the part that we ought to really like and after six days Jesus Take Peter James and John his brother right faith hope and charity right right faith hope and charity and bring them up into a high mountain apart and that's what brother R talk about adoption right he talks about us receiving adoption and when he after six days is where we are now after six days this is where we are after six days right justification sanctification and then what baptism of the Holy Ghost and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his reignment was white as the light what was happening it was a manifestation of God or Christ theophany glorified what with the light Illuminating what was he trying to show Peter James and John this is you right if if all they saw was Jesus and Jesus was illuminated and you're the body of Christ he was RI lit showing what this Calvary was producing trying to give them light and understanding I'm I'm not here just to be another one of your Jewish Brethren I came here for a work and you must understand that this work will bring you back to your glorified state right and it wasn't done in a in a valley it was done on a mountain and that's exactly where Mount Zion will be on a mountain Hallelujah and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his reignment was white as the light and behold there appeared unto him what who Moses and Elijah now here it is the two candlesticks the two uh uh olive trees and remember olive trees Olive represents Jewish Jews right so you see these same olive trees will be seen I think it's in Revelation uh 21 amen and um uh and and in Revelation 21 it it tells us how these olive trees come to being and then you know one had the power of Moses and one had the authority of Elijah right the world hated them because they brought such judgment on the oil and such judgment on the world that they wanted them dead and the Bible says they literally came to a place where they killed him let me tell you something they might think overpowered God but they thought they overpowered God when Jesus was crucified too and what was happening Jesus gave them right to do it that was their job to submit to death and so it is with Moses and Elijah to submit to death and then after a while in three days what happened three and a half I believe it is they raise up you know I was so shocked because you'll find that even in the last of the scripture some of the the people that was there actually uh sound like they was trying to repent amazing but before they threw a party did you know that when Moses and Elijah was killed land in the street that show how quick Wicked and cold the world has would will be that they would throw a world party Glory oh my mind it's terrible right and behold they appeared unto Moses and elij Elias talking with him and then answered Peter and said unto to Jesus Lord is is good for us to be here if thou wi let us make here three Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses and one for Elijah and see how conal we are even under that inspiration let me tell you something there was there would be no way that you could be in the presence of God and not feel the anointing and yet you come out with such a carnal thought that's your show you how frail we are you know we come to a place where we need God at all times amen and while he yet spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him what was he saying he is God hear ye him he's the final Authority hear ye him is that right that's that's why Jesus said all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me what the golden Candlestick his woo and when the disciples heard it they fell on their faces and were so afraid and Jesus came and touched them and says arise and be not afraid and when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man save Jesus only what was it the anointing of Moses and Elijah flow through Christ through the whole time or excuse me the anointing and uh God's Christ anointing excuse me flow through Moses and Elijah they were connected the Forerunner of their their day they were the forerunners amen that's why Moses was God he say I'm going to make you God into Pharaoh I'm going to make you God un Egypt and Moses was the one under the anointing of Christ the bible say that was Christ in the wilderness amen that Del deliver the children and that's where he came to deliver us out of Egypt Amen to deliver us out of bondage to deliver us out of the Grave Hallelujah the forun of their day see they were and all all of the the the representative of Christ was the same and we're just going to read this last scripture and let you go Revelation 11 3-6 and I will give power unto the two witnesses and they shall prophesy 1,23 score days clothed in in sa cloth and these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before God on the earth and if any man will hurt them the fire proceeded out of their mouth and devour their enemies who where what what where the fire come from Elijah law said Elijah said Lord Let the Fire Fall right right so what happens and if any man will hurt them he must in this manner be killed these having power to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of the prophecy and have power over Waters to turn to blood that's Moses and to Smite the Earth with plagues as often as they will as often as what they will Gods right and when they shall have finished their testimony the Beast that ascended out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them so I say all of this to say when we talk about the Arc of the Covenant we talk about the outer Court the inner Court all of this is about worship all of it worship who Jesus Christ right all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me and what happens now you go behind the veil all you see is what just a shakina of Glory you see the swept the angels with the swept back Wings the law the of the testimony and you know and and what is it is the word anointed and that's where we are now we must become the word anointed anointed you keep you know all of this is praise but God won't worship they that worship me must worship me in spirit and in truth and you can't worship God in spirit and truth without a prophet and it takes a prophet because that's who the word of the Lord comes to and when he speaks he's speaking this Bible he a he's not changing it he's giving you the sh kind of Glory revelation of it that's what he's doing and it takes people don't understand they refused when they refused him they refused Heaven every Everybody ref refused Moses everybody refused Noah everybody that refused Jesus everybody that refused Paul all of them they were connected and they didn't have a word of their own the word in which they spoke was a word that was given to them by shakina it was shakina that illuminated this Bible that Luther said oh my goodness the just shall live by faith that was always in the Bible why did everybody before him see it it wasn't the time now we we was at a junction and God was going to do some great things and he did it right now we're at another Junction where people don't even they they can't they can't even get excited I had a brother talk to me today and I was talking to him really you know he said I need God he says brother brother books is like this he said if I was in the road and a car was coming and somebody said hey better get out of the road a car is coming he said what do you think I'm going to do he said it all depends on the way I judge it in other words if I feel like that car is far away I might just take my time to cross the street or might even stand there for a bit before I do it he said but if I could see that car close up I'm going to run and get out of that street see and that's the way people see it they know the car coming but in their minds they giving it a distance when it's so close now when it's really close and you don't see the distance that's what animals do they don't see the distance of the automobile and they run into the street cuz something blinding their their comprehension of what's happening and that's what happening to to the people in the message right now they see the distance they think it's a long way down the road and so they're not moving as fast as they should and a lot of them going to get hit by the car but those of us who see it you get out of the street and you and wait till the car pass you right you're not going to be D doing and ducking it right cuz you've already gotten out of the street and that's what we're trying to get the people to see get out of the street the car is coming we see this thing moving and is moving at a fast pace and if you don't know who you are these things that we're we're working with right now they you know they may not I'm not trying to excite you I'm trying to place you I'm trying to let you see where you're standing and what this thing is all about how God went through all these uh works and things to bring you to a place where the holies of holies you getting a revelation of yourself because that's the greatest Revelation you can get amen it's good to know about Paul and the rest of them but brother brandom in that quote says when the Bride Comes to know who she is when she comes to know who she is and who is she she is the real Queen of Heaven she is the word the the the uh of Christ let's stand she is you got to come to know that all of these things have been done for you I've been seeing things like this for a long time you know every time I would see the Ark of the Covenant I could see the bride sitting on her throne that's what I saw that's what I saw when I saw those uh Angels am Meen those uh with the uh those wings covering you know the Ark of the Covenant and and and you know coverting the mercy seat and all that and I kept The Mercy Seat where was the blood on the mercy seat right and then you see that bread sitting on a table and on that table amen it the lid of the table is gold and why when you sit bread on a on a on a piece of gold it was showing that the deity of it it literally took the gold was something to attract you to the bread and that bread represented Christ it it is you you part of the bread that's why he says I'm breaking this and I'm giving you this I'm giving you this I'm giving you this but you know what it's just come to a place where if Christ can't excite you nothing can it has to be God in you you know it has to be this is not a a a thing oh well I've heard that before whatever you might be thinking I don't know but I'm telling you now amen it's a reason why this word came to us the way it has come and we with it if we just lay in the presence of the son we need more consecration that's our problem laying in the presence of the son you love the Lord father God we come before you we thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord we're not here to be ordinary Christians Lord you said we are a special class of people we've been chosen for this day and this hour but father we also know that we must be on fire for you so Lord if there
