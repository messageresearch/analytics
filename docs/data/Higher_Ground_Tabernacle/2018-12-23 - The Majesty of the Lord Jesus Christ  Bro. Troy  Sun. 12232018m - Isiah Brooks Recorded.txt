these are four things and little family gathering we had we had one of my member of my wife's family go up to pray and he was careful to make sure that everybody knew what the reason of the season was and I appreciated that you know and you know there's a lot of different things with the season you know is you know but we celebrate the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen Christ was born into this world they may not been born December but he was born amen oh we celebrate the Lord Jesus Christ amen well all the world they they make themselves busy buying presents and setting up Christmas trees and

preeminent one in our alive se men and there's no Santa Claus no no Christmas tree no other thing that can take that away from us amen because we worship the one true God the Lord Jesus Christ amen and to him alone do we assign majesty and glory amen amen so let's just open our Bibles Exodus chapter 24 read from the eighth verse and I do I just want to title this message the majesty of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and we're gonna start talking about the the Day of Atonement here's verse 8 it says and Moses took the blood and sprinkled it on the people and said behold the blood of the Covenant which the LORD hath made with you concerning all these words and then wind up Moses and Aaron and naida and about who and seventy of the elders of Israel and they saw the God of Israel and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of sapphire stone and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness and upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand also they saw God and did eat and drink even now let's skip down to the fifteenth verse there and Moses went up into the mount and a cloud covered the mountain and the glory of the Lord abode upon Mount Sinai and the cloud covered at six days and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud and the sight of the glory of the Lord was like a devouring foul that devouring fire on the top of the Mount in the eyes of the children of Israel and Moses went into the midst of the cloud and got himself up into the Mount and Moses was in the Mount forty days and forty nights a man let's stop right there Bauer Ezra word of Prayer Heavenly Father we just thank you Lord for your word for your gospel for your presence for your holy spirit here Lord in the midst of us father dwelling in us Lord for for filling us with your Holy Spirit for for writing a word to us for making a covenant with us spot for washing us by your own blood for all these things Lord we do give you thanks Lord and we just glorify you and give you all the majesty and honour and glory do unto your name father lord I just pray Lord as we preach this morning father that you would bring the word out perfectly that all that sit here that are in this building this morning would know if surely that that your word was true where you say where two or three are gathered in your name that you were right here in our myths and you open your word to us and we saw just like Moses saw we saw your Majesty as we did eat and drink of your work and we just thank you Lord for all things we turn the service into your able hands in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you can be seated Amen you know as Moses you know I'm sure all of us could think my I wish I was there maybe I wouldn't have been a nice thing to say you know as the children of Israel he Moses he's been given the leadership over the children of Abraham and all those years he had heard about Abraham and how great Abraham was but now that all the children of Abraham were given into his hands amen and now God gave him the assignment to bring his people out of Egypt amen and to gather them together in one place and there God would be revealed unto them amen so as the children of Israel they the the children of Abraham they left Egypt and they went out into the wilderness amen and and as they gathered there in the wilderness that God came down upon the top of the mountain you know and this says they saw him as a cloud they saw him as a as a burning fire consuming the top of the mountain and and and Moses grabbed a Aaron and and the brothers and their and seventy of the elders and they went up into the mountain and they saw God to me that's just a it's just incredible to me it's amazing it's majestic you know God knows what Majesty is amen you know when we think about the word majestic it's it's when you when you go to a place that is majestic and you set your eyes and all of your senses on the majesty of whatever is around you the purpose of that is to gather your focus on one thing amen when you when you when you go up into the mountains you know you into the where the grandeur of the mountains like say in Colorado or in Alaska you know and you and you're just impressed with all that God has created and how great all the mountains are all everything that surrounds you and all of God's creation and how little you are and how big those are amen as there's a majesty to that when you begin to realize that my God created all of that amen and it draws your focus the focus of a Christian to How Great Thou art a meant to how great our God is when you realize how small how small we are and how great what he is able to do you know and then back in the olden days you know they used to build these giant cathedrals you know and there and they and that the goal was to to impress the the churchgoers and when they walked through this Cathedral that they are walking into a sacred place that this would be where God would dwell you know when they had the Tabernacle in the wilderness God created all that after a certain specific pattern so that the people would have a very specific they walked into it there would be a majesty there a meant a man and there was something majestic about it why because it came after a pattern of heaven he meant and so when when when you know God he is when the when Moses in them they walked up under that mountain that was a majestic sight they were being drawn from the thoughts that were behind them amen they ate walked up into the mountain amen and as soon as the cloud cover them everything else was taken away they became small and God became great amen amen I think about it Moses leaves them behind he says I will be back and he walks right up and as they had been staring at this cloud and Moses walks right into the cloud and there he is face-to-face with God and the Bible says that he was there for forty days and forty nights I think about that's from now until the beginning of February face-to-face with Jehovah face-to-face with him where the world is shut out hey you know to me that's that's that's all the qualifications I need for Moses III know I know where he got his his material amen I know how the book of Genesis got wrote I know how I know how the book of Exodus was written I know how the Book of Leviticus was written everything that Moses wrote I know how it was written because he was face to face with God amen amen I I know where I know what kind of a man he was I know his qualifications I know his experience why because he was a man who was face to face with God amen he left the world behind he shut himself into a place God met him in that place and for 40 days and 40 nights he was face to face with God that's all the qualifications I need to hear about amen and everything let everything that he said let it be truth they meant he experienced the majesty of Jehovah he experienced the majesty of Lord Jesus Christ and he saw things up there that he couldn't help but bring those things back amen and the Lord instructed me says whatever you saw up here I want you to recreate it down there they meant and so he was instructed take everything each you saw up there whatever it is and I want you to build it on the earth in the same pattern that you were shown when you're up here face to face with me that's how he built the tabernacle like you see that picture on the wall there all of that was built according to a very specific pattern that Moses saw when he was face-to-face with Jehovah Amite is majestic his majesty amen when when Aaron the high priest when he when he walked in and he had certain steps say like on the day of atonement you know once a year they would have the the day of atonement and Aaron the high priest had certain specific things that he had to do on that day amen so he would get the bow lock he'd get the the two goats a men who'd slay the Moloch for the for the children of Israel and you would sprinkle the blood upon the altar and you know and then he would take the two goats and they are cast lots and one of the goats would be assigned to Jehovah whichever one the lot fell upon that was Jehovah's Jehovah's sacrifice Jehovah's goat and then the other one was tied up right there and left for late a mint and so then when when and then you take the goat that was assigned to Jehovah and they would sacrifice it amen and then all and then they would catch the blood from the sacrifice and he'd go into the holiest of Holies and you'd sprinkle that blood upon the mercy seat he sprinkle it towards the curtain back towards the people Amen seven times and seven times amen and as he's to use what was he doing he was instituting a day of atonement where the children of Israel would know without a doubt my sins were gone amen and God had a very specific November all of this came from what God's what Moses saw up and Moses standing up there in the mountains saw something that caused him to come down and Institute the day of atonement there is something that Moses saw up there that caused him to cut march down into the mountain build that Tabernacle right there and to Institute the pattern a holy day called the Day of Atonement he saw something he saw something there's something that I just keep repeating that there's something Moses saw when he was up on that mountain when he peered up into heaven there's something that he saw that caused him to come down and build that tabernacle and to Institute the day of atonement I wonder what he saw it was majestic it was beautiful it was powerful let me tell you it was perfect it was glorious amen so Moses he or Aaron the high priest would on the day of atonement he would sacrifice that goat there was a sign to Jehovah in you he'd do the sprinkling of the blood and he walk into the holiest of Holies and he would take that blood he would sprinkle it upon the mercy seat so the mercy seat there you know they had dark in the Covenant I had the Word of God there on the inside amen by if there is anybody in the children of Israel that had done contrary to the word the word was covered over with a lid called the mercy seat hey man they took the blood of the sacrifice and they would sprinkle it on the on top of that mercy seat on top of that lid there was the mercy was covering over the word amen so between the children of Israel and the Word of God there was a layer of mercy a man in that and blaming that mercy was covered over with the blood of the sacrifice amen and the Bible says that the air in the high priest when he walked in there that he had these stones that were written upon all the Nate the names of the churner of Israel and it was written over his heart and so when he went in there he'd walk in there to do the sacrifice he'd have the names of the children of Israel and scribed on stones upon his heart amen where did all that where did that idea come from I think about this where did that idea come from Moses wasn't just making this up he saw something up in the majesty of heaven amen he saw something that caused him to come down to institute all of this amen so then all the the children of Israel be waiting outside of the tabernacle door and they're there waiting and there's all silence they don't hear anything they're there waiting they're waiting to see what what what you know as Aaron gonna reappear or not it is Aaron going to come back out of that tent is the sacrifice being completed are our sins gone or not amen have our sins been taken care of or not and and when Aaron would after completing everything that he was supposed to doing there he come back out and he'd walk up to that other goat the second goat and he would lay his hands on it he would transfer in a figure the sins of the people after they've been atoned for and upon the mercy seat transfer the sins of the people on that scapegoat and then they'd lead that scape go out into the wilderness to never be seen again and those the people would watch as that scape goes leaving the camp they'd say praise God my sins are gone amen we have been atoned for amen we go God gave us the word we've done contrary to the word but praise God with the sacrifice my sins are gone amen what a feeling a mint quite an experience Amen ex chapter 25 when gali was talking to Moses about building this the the tabernacle and verse 25 verse 1 he says and the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak unto the children of Israel that they bring me an offering of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart he shall take my offering a mint it's where they go they're gonna build the tabernacle with a willing heart sacrifice amen everything all the materials that were used in building the the tabernacle were built with an offering that was given by willing hearts amen let's go down to verse 8 it says and let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them according to all that I show thee after the pattern of the tabernacle and after the pattern of all the instruments arif even so shall you make it a mint so moses saw this god has struck to him go down and take up an offering you're not you're not doing the work yourself a man Moses you're going to build this using what they're willing our sacrifice amen and out of the out of this the willingness of their own heart will create a pattern of what you saw up in glory amen amen and what was the purpose of building all this verse a it says right there let them make a sanctuary that I may dwell among them why what what was the purpose God wanted to dwell amongst his people amen now you when you go down further in the chapter it starts talking about the and the holiest of Holies there let's go to verse 17 there Amen it says I've already talked about building the the Ark of the Covenant now they're talking about building the mercy seat to go on top of the Ark of the Covenant verse 17 it says and thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold two cubits and a half shall be the link theraph and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof and thou shalt make to cherubims of gold of beaten work shalt thou make them in the two ends of the mercy seat and make one cherub on the one end and the other chair up on the other end even of the mercy seat mercy seat shall you make the cherubims on the two ends era and the chair rooms shalt stretch forth their wings on high covering the mercy seat with their wings and their faces shall look one to another to where the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be and now shall put the mercy seat above upon the ark and in the ark thou shall put the testimony that I shall give thee and there I will meet you amen there I will meet thee and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat from between the two cherubim I wish our upon the Ark of the testimony of all things which I give thee and the commandments under the children of Israel a man so what does he do remember what do we read back in the beginning in in chapter 24 he says hey Moses spoke to the children of Israel he God is making a covenant with you I've sprinkled you with the blood I've sprinkled the word with the blood and Here I am bringing you the testimony the Covenant thank God right now is making a covenant between himself and you amen and all of these words that God has written we've inscribed them down upon stone or putting them in in the in the the Ark of the Covenant Amen God has made a covenant between you but between you and the and the Covenant is going to be a layer of mercy amen between you and the Covenant that God has made with you a man is going to be a layer a lid a covering a cut / of mercy a mana called the mercy seat and that that word mercy seat has to do with is the same root word as the word atonement I am going to atone for you on your sins so then there on the day of atonement you would take the blood from the sacrifice and he was sprinkle it upon the mercy seat on the day of atonement he's take the atonement and sprinkle it upon the atonement and that's where God would meet them he wouldn't meet them there on the word he met them there on their mercy that covered the word Amen and that's where God met them and issued his covenant with them he meant or the blood met the Covenant right in the midst of the word there is mercy and that's where he will meet you I will meet you right there amen bye what a powerful ceremony the day of atonement one day a year our sins are gone they've been taken away they the the sins are have been atoned for at the mercy seat where God made a covenant with us when we and we in our own failings our own failures we've done things against the Covenant that God has has given unto us but God meant us right there at the point of mercy amen and the and the blood of the cub has been sprinkled amen and our sins were taken and they were assigned upon the scapegoat and the scapegoat went out into the wilderness and we washed and now we know we have on a surety we have this overpowering ceremony showed them gave them a visible sign that praise God our sins are gone praise God my sins are gone why because they prayer in the high priest would take the sins and he put his hands upon that scapegoat and transfer the sins of the people on did I go and hear you go out into the wilderness amen our sins have gone we have been accepted by Jehovah Amen Jehovah has looked upon us and smiled amen who have been accepted by Jehovah and the thing of it is is the entire thing was something that Moses saw up and have it so there is something now as great and as powerful as that is and how I would love to go back in a time machine 3000 years and go and see this in operation or 3,500 years ago and watch this take place how much I would love to see that with my own physical eyes there is a greater testimony than that Amen why because there is a better testament than that there's a greater covenant than that for that that was the Old Testament amen that was the Old Covenant but God says I have made a New Testament with you that's why we call it the New Testament being God has said I have made a new covenant with you amen let's turn over to Hebrews chapter 9 verse chapter 9 verse 19 says for when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book and all the people saying this is the blood of the Testament which God hath enjoined unto you moreover he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood is no remission and Moses saw something in heaven that signified all that there was a testament there was a covenant that Moses saw being given a man in that covenant between God and man was seal with blood amen amen so in so in Moses what he do when good Moses when he went before he went on the mountain he spoke to the people and he gave the Covenant of God to the people and he took and he the sacrifice he sprinkled the people he sprinkled the the book he sprinkled all he says now there has been a covenant made between God and you and if they thing if you break the covenant then God will meet you right there at the mercy seat and then any weapon in the heavens and he had been to the mountain and he saw the pattern there everything was patterned off of amen now now let's keep going verse 22 it says and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood is no remission it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these heyno so there was a better sacrifice Amen now we think about why Christ came when God sent the Lord Jesus Christ sent himself into the earth well you do he came to shepherds he sent an angel band an angel came to Mary amen and the whole thing was majestic you know when you read the Bible there's a lotta there was a lot of prophets there was a lot of magnificent things that happened majestic things amazing things when you look at Mary when when when she hears the angel choir when she when she hears the the angel speaking to her you'll bear child you'll call his name Jesus we're in the Shepherds when when the Shepherd's have the angel come and speak to them and say and the angel choir singing and they're like what is going on but now it's no longer now they'd hurt now all those people Mary the shepherds Joseph all of them they had all been to Jerusalem amen they had all seen the majesty of the ceremony amen they all seen how majestic the ceremony was when their high priest would go into the tabernacle amen to it into the temple that David had built and uh and and they saw how that the majesty of that tavern amen and how and how much and how much Majesty that the people assigned to that you know when Herod built that tabernacle they assigned it unto it majesty by building it a man and they and it was supposed to be a place so it fill you with awe you would walk in you'll remember when the when the disciples walked in they're like oh Jesus look how great this building is look how beautiful this is how I'll stand forever you know and Jesus says tear this thing down I will rebuild it in three days and they were impressed with it but Jesus says there's a better building than this amen there is a better place than this you know and we can we can think about how great a worship service is or we can you know and then the Christmas season there's an orchestras and choirs all over the land in there and they're trying to institute a atmosphere of majesty you know to when they when you get though all the band with all the brass instruments and all the stringed instruments and and they sing the they sing the Christmas carols and the songs and all over the land there that people are trying to celebrate the holiday of Christmas amen but I wonder sometimes if they I've ever been with Moses upon the mountain and which Testament are they looking at amen because you know when when Jesus and the disciples went into Jerusalem the disciples works getting excited about the Old Testament the Old Covenant where God had a place where he would meet with his people and they were talking to Jesus and they said look how great this Old Testament is look how great this Old Covenant is this old temple where God will meet with men amen in all of our lives we've been taught to to revere how great this this temple is and how great this priesthood is and how the high priest who who has donned himself with these with these fine garments and he goes through and he he's holier than thou and how how great the high priest appears to be and they'd all had assigned these thoughts in their mind that this is a majestic place and it was majestic but while they were speaking to the New Testament the Lord Jesus Christ they were speaking to the New Testament lamb trying to point back and say look how great this Old Testament is and the New Testament spoke back to him he meant the lamb spoke back to him the Lord Jesus Christ spoke right out and he says tear this building down I will rebuild it again in three days amen tear this building down yo and every time I read about the the sacrifices in the Old Testament that that thought comes in your mind my wish I could have been there to see that why how I'd love to see the the majesty of the high priest Amen the the the anticipation of the people waiting for the high priest to come out and announce your sins are gone they've been cast away from as far as the temple is to the wilderness amen your sins have been transferred upon this go and now your sins are our separate as far away from the temple is from the wilderness amen but we have a greater testament to them we have a greater covenant because now in the new covenant God says as far away as the east is from the west your sins are gone a man you know he didn't say north and south because if you start heading north you get to the North Pole and now you're going south again and if you go south and you get to the South Pole and you keep going else and you're going north again but if you go east you're just always going east always going east as far as East cannot become west west cannot become East and so when your sins are gone they cannot come back to you amen the process cannot be reversed your sins are gone amen a New Testament God has given unto you amen hebrews chapter 9 verse 22 it says and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without the shedding of blood is no remission it was therefore necessary that the patterns of the things in heavens should be purified with these but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these so everything that moses saw up in the heavens needed a sacrifice amen there had to be a sacrifice for those heavenly things amen and now Christ verse 24 now Christ has not entered into the holy place made with hands he didn't go just go into the Temple of Jerusalem they meant when Jesus died upon the cross when he rose again he didn't go and present himself back to the high priest said I am I'm the bloody sacrifice no he entered up into the heavens of heavens he went to the same thing that Moses saw amen verse 24 for Christ is not entered in to the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but now into heaven itself watch now to appear in the presence of God for us not just that he has went up there to appear in the presence of God but he went up there to appear in the presence of God for us a meant every single one of us remember Aaron uh it's in let's turn to the Exodus chapter 28 I just got to read this verse I was just going to quote it to you let's turn to it X's 28 verse 29 Jesus Christ Adrian's in the heaven itself to appear in the presence of God for us for us amen in Exodus 28 says verse 29 and Aaron shall bear the names of the son of Israel and the breastplate of judgment upon his heart that when he goeth in under the holy place for a memorial before the Lord continually that there be set up a memorial unto the Lord of your name continually and now Christ is sick a turn into the holiest of holies for you with his own blood to appear before God himself for you he is the atonement for you amen we don't have to wish oh my I wish I was there oh I wish I could have seen that we have a new and a greater Testament we have been we we can see it can you see it say Amen can you see it your sins are gone a make you see that Christ is standing right there at the tabernacle at the altar wait there to appear before God for you amen amen now to appear in the presence of God for us Majesty you know someday when we in a moment in the twinkling of an eye when we get to meet him and when that rule comes over us they worked the whole thing though the whole plan for 6000 years is now finished my sins are gone I've been raptured up into the heavens I am meeting my Savior face-to-face and we realize I've been washed in the blood of the Lamb Oh majesty amen we enter into his majesty amen you know we've had a lot of good worship services here in this room but they cannot compare with what we are getting ready to experience amen because one of these days soon in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we will appear before our Savior with our garments washed and the blood of the Lamb amen white as snow amen as a pure bride of the Lord Jesus Christ adorned for her husband amen majesty lift up on high His Majesty why because now that now we've seen a lot of majestic things we've seen temples and Tabernacles of man but one of these days we're gonna enter in to the greatest majestic thing that has ever been seen upon the earth amen because there's there's only one man in the Bible that went and spent 40 days of 40 nights face to face with God and that was Moses and when he came down he had to give a pattern of everything that he saw I was up there and what did he get would he come down what was the most majestic of all the things that he saw up there of all the things that you know when he what will did he see up there when he went up there he saw the world's beginning to form he saw God say let there be light they meant he saw the Spirit of God brooding upon the face of the waters he saw the guy edan being created he saw God walking in the cool of the day in the midst of the garden amen he saw all these things but when he came down he began to express the majesty of the covenant amen the majesty of the mercy the majesty of the sacrificial lamb why is why is that though that was the most majestic thing this is what I'm going to express to you this is one can express to you that Christ the lamb is going to die for his bride amen and then when and he is going to forgive her for all of her sins he's gonna redeem her back from the fall a man he's gonna bring her back up into glory Oh Majesty this is what he came when he came down off the mountain he didn't start talking about I saw the creation I saw the heavens and the earth created he didn't say I saw the Garden of Eden he didn't say all those he wrote them later but but well the one thing he expressed he saw building after the patties on heaven was the majesty that the people's sins were forgiven he meant that there was at Christ not just a lamb not just uh not just an animal not just a goat not just a bull walk but Jesus Christ the Son of the Living God was dying for the sins of his bride amen and that was the majesty of the sacrifice he but he made it into a pattern so that the people could see it and they turned it into a dry dead religion amen and they took the pattern and turned it into a dry dead religion amen but that that's covenant that there's that that that testimony is still there the thing that Moses saw is still up in the heavens amen even if the the the pattern on the earth grows old even if the pattern on the earth you know they build a tabernacle it they lose it amen they had the Ark of the Covenant and they lost that amen they build a temple and then they it was ruined and destroyed they built another one and man destroyed that one amen but yet the pattern that was built off is still standing up in the heavens Amen the pattern was your husband the Lamb of God the Lord Jesus Christ Oh majesty How Great Thou art amen because these things were built off the patterns of what was up in the heavens amen you know and we call it the Old Testament but the Old Testament is only referring to the things on the earth amen because the things in the oven can in the heavens can never become old amen only the things on the earth can become old but the things that have had never become old that new testament was the pattern all along amen Christ and his bride amen our sins are gone the high priest the Lord Jesus Christ amen he walked up the hill to Calvary amen and and he was the Lamb of God amen he was the Lamb of God that was going to be slain amen he was the goat that was gonna be slain amen and he was nailed upon the cross amen our sins were died but then he was also the goat the way into the wilderness right amen because he took our sins and he bore them far away not just as far as the temple is from the wilderness but as far as the east is from the west he took our sins back to Hell where they came from amen amen and now and now he just sended it from up on high giving gifts unto men and that's what is he is preaching to you as they gifts this morning amen and now he is standing at the altar making intercession for you with your name standing there as a memorial before God upon his heart upon the heart of the Lord Jesus Christ your name so how do I assign this great atonement to myself how do I that's a great story but how do I take this atonement to myself you just put your name there amen because Christ is standing there at the throne for you amen Christ is standing there at the altar for you with his own blood to make intercession for you based upon your confession amen let's read Hebrews chapter 9 verse 14 says how much more I just read verse 13 for if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the Eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God purge your conscience how's your conscience doing this morning amen purge your conscience from dead works to serve the Living God and for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first Testament they which are called might receive the promise of an eternal inheritance amen are you the call this morning have you felt the call of God upon your life amen have you felt the call of God upon your life amen if God has called you a man then he's called you right here to this sacrifice if God has spoke to your heart if he's drawn you if God has spoke to you if he's drawing you to himself this is why to bring you to this New Testament to bring you to the same place where Moses was to still go and let all the things of the world be behind you to leave Egypt behind to walk up into the mountains with him face to face and see the sacrifice where your sins are gone Oh Majesty worship His Majesty amen there's a New Testament with his own blood he meant I just wanted to read this from Malachi chapter 1 it says Malachi 1:1 says the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi verse 2 says I have loved you stay at the Lord yet ye say wherein has that loved us was not Esau Jacob's brother and yet saith the Lord yet I have loved Jacob and I hated Esau amen if God has chosen you accept it Amen if God has chosen you if John if God has called you if you have felt the call go up on your life then run to him amen rolling to him why because he's standing there waiting to make atonement for you based upon your confession amen amen god is good you see all no matter how majestic that looks to us there is a greater pattern up in the heavens amen and when we and we enter into there by prayer by a contrite heart by a contrite spirit and we just like them can say praise God my sins are gone that's the you know you know it's me that's greater than any building I can ever go to it that those experiences are greater than than any mountain I've ever climbed they're greater than any tabernacle or temple they're better than E Cathedral all the earthly choirs I've ever heard sing all the great music I've ever listened to oh you know they grab your emotions and they bring them up high and then three minutes later they - them back to the ground and songs over amen but there is something about this that is so majestic that it just never ends praise God I've met my Savior face-to-face and I know my sins are gone amen amen it's a more majestic scene when you can finally assign that atonement to yourself when you can finally realize that God has given you permission to believe that your sins are gone amen now now back then when the when the when the children of Israel waited at the tabernacle door and they'd see the high priests come out with the scapegoat and thence one would lead that escape go out into the wilderness as the scapegoat was leaving they'd say we have we have we have done what Jehovah has required now on this day of atonement we know our sins are gone they're leaving the camp their goats they had a visual confirmation that their sins were gone but you know your eyes could lie to you but there is a greater thing than the sense of sight there is a sense of faith amen let every man that can see with the eyes of his faith they meant that his sins are gone to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ to believe on the sacrifice that man sins they're gone amen amen you think oh I wish I could be there you can be there right now oh I wish I could have seen that you can see it right now oh I wish I could see that Old Testament there's a New Testament right here waiting for you a new covenant that God has made a covenant between himself and you I will never leave you nor forsake you I'll come again I'll receive you into myself a man I go to prepare a place for you and if I prepare if I leave I will come again and receive you unto myself and one of these days I make a covenant with you then in a moment in a twinkling of an eye I'll come back and I will take you up to glory with me amen a covenant that God has made between you and him amen a New Testament and he sealed it with his own blood he was the high priest he was the Lamb he was Jehovah's the goat for jehovah he was the gopher the scapegoat he did it all he performed every single part of that ceremony he performed every part of the ceremony that all you had to do is stand outside stand at the door and knock amen amen and all you had to do is go to the dory men and meet Christ there at the door open the door let them in a mint how do you my sins are gone that's when you can assign the atonement to you amen you know the the Word of God as a seed and it can only grow in a heart that has faith you know faith is the good ground that seeds grow in you know if you do not believe if you're wondering if you're doubting then then the Word of God can't grow there amen but if you have a heart of faith where you say you know what Lord I'm just gonna take you at your word I'm just gonna believe in you I'm gonna take you at your word my sins are gone amen amen let's read it just here in closing let's read Hebrews chapter 10 the next chapter over - Stan I'm gonna read here Hebrews chapter ten nine through twenty five it's a long read but I just want to read all of this to read along with me amen you got to read out loud but just read make sure you read along with me here it says then said helo I come to do thy will o God he taketh away the first that he may establish the second by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever set down on the right hand of God from henceforth expecting until his enemies be made his footstool you know Jesus knows exactly what's gonna happen he are he's already seen it he knows exactly what's gonna happen amen it's the same thing with us if you have already seen it you know exactly what its gonna happen but that scene only comes by revelation amen for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified we're uh can you believe that Saints Christ died for your sins by one time he died for your sins for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us for after that he had said before this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days saith the Lord I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them and their sins and their iniquities I will remember them no more now where a remission of sin of these is there is no more offering for sin a man now what does Paul do he gives us a little bit of instruction here take these things a mint these next few verses he's gonna give us instruction this is what would seeing that you know all this this is what we need to do it says verse 19 having therefore having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus by new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh having a high priest over the house of the God lest draw near with a true heart in full assurance full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works not forsaking the Assembly of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much more as you see the Day approaching amen that and that is the pattern of the Christian life that they are gathered together often rejoicing in the majesty of the sacrifice the majesty that their sins are gone that the Day of Atonement has been that the sacrifice has been accepted for you amen and you've been washed but now let us live one to another exhorting much other all the more as you see the Day approaching a malicious borrower has a word of Prayer Heavenly Father I just want to thank you Lord for your atonement Lord I don't know if I could express it the way I see it father but Lord it's a beautiful thing to me when I realized that that I don't have to wish anymore that I could have been there I don't have to wish anymore than I could have seen those things because I've already been there amen I went to the tabernacle door I met the high priest amen and he can eat too late did the sacrifice he performed every part of the ceremony for me and praise God my sins are gone I met him at the altar and now in the Lord I see you standing there father with my eyes of faith waiting to make intercession for me based upon my confession Lord anything I have need of on life's journey Lord that you but it will pay the for it with your sacrifice and lord I thank you for it Lord I may I never lose sight of it lord I pray man never lose sight with the eyes of faith what you have done for me on Calvary and lord I just thank you Lord for all things and I pray Lord that may the faith of the people may they see what you've done for him in the name of Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen god bless you brother Isaac if you come amen praise God they meant that's this that's no small word amen hallelujah we need to put away the things of the world that are holding us down here this morning that was a [Music] majestic [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] magnify Jesus ship his majesty oh Jesus who died now glorified
