TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen we thank God for his grace and his Mercy amen amen as we stand let us turn to Revelations 3 re uh Genesis 5 then our final scripture will be coming from Isaiah 56 you love the Lord amen amen it was a surprise when I saw brother Randy walk through the door but it was a good surprise amen you know God is real to us amen Revelations 3 and 21 to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne Hallelujah he that ha an ear let him hear what the spirit say unto the churches Genesis 52 amen you love the Lord surely God is good to us amen amen I've had a blessed day I trust your day has been wonderful amen Genesis 52 male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name Adam in the day they were created Isaiah 56 and5 Isaiah 56 [Music] and5 even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters I will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut amen off Hallelujah let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your grace Lord we thank you for your mercy and your love and God you've been so good to us you've been better to us than we have been to ourselves and we want to say thank you Lord we want to give you praise we want you to to give you honor father without you we're nothing and and we know Lord God is we're here only because you thought us to be here and after that thought you spoke us Lord and Lord we materialize it your word could not come back void and here we stand Lord God as a manifestation of your spoken word and we pray here this evening father that you would bless each and every one of us strengthen us Lord and father we pray that you give us eiz that we'll not only see uh where we are but we'll be able to look and see the future as well we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated we like to entitle this message a name better than Sons and Daughters uh we thought by the grace of God to minister these things and we're still um working with those thoughts that we had on uh uh the few last few weeks uh because I think often time we don't realize what God is doing for us we realize that we're in a time when people should be really crying out before God but remember the prophet of God saw a vision and he saw a vision of the church and the bride and he actually saw the bride get out of step in the message Prov Ming his word he says father I I pray that that that you would uh get the bride back in Step she got out of Step he said because of this and because of that and no doubt as I see um the storm approaching maybe we were like Peter who asked God to let us walk on these Waters amen but we find out amen that because of the storm he took his eyes off Jesus in other words he got out of Step because he took his eyes off Jesus and the word of God tells us that he began to say but the thing about it is that the only thing he had to do was call on him amen you know we sang that song last week Jesus Jesus no other name under Heaven can save us and we realize amen that that is the only name that there is power in amen the Bible tells me that demons tremble at the name of Jesus and every knee must bow at the name of Jesus but you see we we don't realize how powerful that name is understand second Peter in the first chapter is working on a name not just character because the character of God is his name and when you realize amen that the character of God God is being formed in you or the name of God remember we told you last week to have the name of Jesus or the name of God in your forehead is not just the mark but it's the understanding that you have that God is in you amen come on somebody and once God is in you nothing can take it out amen so we read also the Book of Revelation where he says for those who overcome and that word uh I think sometimes is often forgotten overcome that means there is a battle not just a battle but continuously battling amen if you watch uh the children of Israel when they came into the promised land uh brother bam typed that out as the Holy Ghost and he said that's when the battles began and they had some real battles am but the thing that would would cause them and and and it's the same thing that causes us to lose the battles is when we've got a aen or a spirit of come on somebody when you think you've got your sins undercover God will uncover your sins and so that's what a can is is a dangerous thing to be in the promise because remember amen this hour is calling for a people who will not defile the Sabbath and that's what aen did he defiled the Sabbath it was it was a place of the Holy Ghost and therefore his unbelief was supposed to die Amen in the Jordan amen yes sir Hallelujah come on somebody it is what it is but the Bible tells us that this is a time of wrestling or travailing and no matter how quiet or reserved you might think you are God is requiring you to travail thank you brother if you don't travail you don't get it amen amen because it is god brother manam said so it is God's way amen of getting his attention he said the baby cries to get the parents' attention he said God hasn't changed it any other way he said when God did that it is the way a Christian gets God attention by travailing and crying out hello now so you know we can uh say well I didn't have to do that and I'm going to tell you something if you going to reach Perfection you're going to do it amen throughout the ages it's been done and you're not exempt the saddest part is is that we have been affected affected by the spirit of Leia let me let me move on the Bible tells us that Jacob wrestled with the Lord his name meant sh he was Amen in his natural man a liar and a thief and in your natural man that's exactly what you are Jacob typed out the church or the bride because remember amen he went seven years and seven years amen showing amen the Alpha and the Omega and he showed by the grace of God Amen that he finally got the woman he really wanted and that was Rachel and Rachel produced the Alpha and the Omega amen Joseph and Benjamine yes sir and we realize amen by the grace of God Amen but he had to wrestle with he was already blessed we're not talking about blessing we're talking about a nature change amen and he understood that he could not meet the oncoming yeah Amen brother amen hello he could not meet the oncoming wild man in the state that he was in even though he understood his father blessed him he got all the blessings of his father but he wanted to see those things live amen and so the Bible tells us that he wrestled with God now up to that point he was still selfish that's right yeah he put his family in front he put his wives his children Hallelujah hoping amen that that would be something that Esau would look at and have mercy on him but he took the long way and finally something struck him I better get down the prayer yes sir and the Bible tells us that he met an angel in that prayer and that angel tried to get away from him oh Lord Brother brandom said like this he said God will purposely tried to run you off amen he'll let things happen in your life just to run you off amen come on somebody he told the 70 except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you'll have no part of me amen he purposely split his church that's right because he really wanted the cream of the cream of the crop come on somebody that's right and then he looked at Peter and said will you go to but Peter said Lord like the bride says where else am I going to go I can't go to Pentecostal churches I can't go to Methodist or Lutheran or Catholic churches there is no way to go where am I going to go you only have the words to eternal life he goes on and he rousel and that angel said let me go it's time for me to get out of here my shift shift is about to change he said I ain't letting you go nowhere this morning you going to be late unless you bless me Hallelujah and that is the way it is with God see we've been taught we haven't been taught about all night prayer and brother brand I just heard him say he said around 4:00 is when the demons go to sleep now I don't understand that sleep part but that's what he said that's when they stop carousing but that's when God comes on the scene that's when the breaking of a day a new daring in your life that's why the god gets you up at that time and you says oh God it's just too early Lord I'm still sleepy Lord help us come on Amen now you know God talking with somebody here tonight maybe all of us are not guilty but that's when God comes when there is a changing of the guards when the demons don't got everybody drunk he he going to get drunk now they sleep all the party demons are finished laid out somewhere right all of the prostitutes are off the corner come on somebody but that's when God start working amen hallelujah come on somebody amen see we realize you and I must understand God got all these shadows and types now here I'm going preach it a little bit Esther and vasty we realize amen and brother R comes along and he talks about this in marriage and divorce he said vasty was put away because amen she refused to come to the king's banquet but you see it was going to be more than a a celebration of just showing her off amen the King was going to go into her to produce children and she refused it that's what he said and because vast I refused the king Esa became the wife of the king amen right and this was all to bring forth children in the that day let me say it like this people of God we will all be guilty if we don't produce Christ in here enough to produce children I mean the Holy Ghost children we can't come in here in a dad church and expect God to accept us because the only way that God will accept this little group you and I must be filled with his spirit amen amen produ ing children of Our Kind amen word children not intellect word children is that all right amen he said listen to this he said here it was he said you know he could put vasti away but she couldn't put him away and Christ can put the church away amen hallelujah but the church can't put her him away that that's why she's in trouble she locked him out the house Hallelujah come on somebody amen amen no matter how you look at it that is the way of God Amen now here in Isaiah 56:5 he tells us and I that thing God me he says I'm going to give you a better name than sons and daughters and at first I didn't catch it then the Lord said to me Abraham married his sister hello somebody oh come on come on come on Amen you and I must understand Abraham married his sister that was a type of God amen amen you said that can't be true Solomon woo let me go there say my sister my spouse Hallelujah W Hallelujah anyhow and if you are a Believer you marry your sister she becomes your spouse your spiritual sister come on somebody and Christ married his because we both came from the father amen amen turn with me the songs of Solomon 4:10 ain't God good see we look at this thing and that's why brother BR said even Cain had to marry his own sister that was the only way it could cuz everything came from uh come on somebody Miss Eve the mother of all living amen so here we are you said what what are you saying brother I'm saying we have come this far by faith and all all we have all oh I'm a Child of God I'm a I'm a daughter of God I'm a Son of God but God said listen I want to do something greater than that I want to marry you amen hallelujah now you can refuse it if you like because that's what vastar did she locked him out the door and says uhuh you're not coming in here and Jesus said well I tell you what for who all would come out to meet me he said I'll suck with them I have a banet with him amen come on somebody a banquet of Love is that right Psalms of Solomon 4:10 says list I love this amen it says how fair is thy love my sister my spouse how much better is the love than Wine and the smell of thy armonds than all spices thy lips oh my spouse drop as the honeycomb honey and milk are under thy tongue and the smell of thy gar is like the smell of lemon now she ain't coming to him with all kind of bitter complaints no sir everything coming out of her mouth is sweet yes sir come on somebody everything's coming out of her mouth is sweet thank you Lord you say Adam didn't marry his sister but where did they both come from from the same father Hallelujah case dismissed now you and I must recognize by the grace of God that God is calling us to a higher calling Daughters of Jerusalem so when we look at this thing you you and I must understand the bride came forth in the vision of brother brandham twice she was the alpha bride and she was the Omega bride amen but the Omega bride did something right right at the end you say the alpha bride didn't do it yes she did if she had not gone gotten out of step we would not have had amen a a a a council of churches we would not have had amen uh uh what they call it down there 25 uh uh 325 ad we wouldn't have had that now you're seeing counsel if she had not gotten out of Step she did but this time amen we had a word amen we had a prophet who saw her getting out of Stu and he word comes out of his mouth which was a creative word get in line stay in line amen W and that word amen is still affecting us every time we miss a step or get out of line that word strikes us and brings us back in line with the word thank because remember it wasn't the prophet who was speaking that's right it was God through the prophet because he did not even remember saying it he had to go back listen to the tapes and all that stuff amen thank you Lord stay in line he come out of the vision I'm sorry but in when telling those Visions I'm getting two things mixed up but in telling those Visions amen I was working with California when he talks about capernium capernium that's where I cross that up sorry but yes he knew amen and saw I mean the Bri getting out of line and he was so caught up in that anointing he spoke amen stay in line amen H is that all right amen now look at this we talk about I want you to understand that the name of God was so important and Powerful that it was mentioned hundreds of years before he came you said what do you mean see it it's power in a name amen sir it's power in a name you can say whatever you want to that but that's why the Bible said curse not don't give a name to somebody that isn't true or right right the Bible said you can't even call him a fool a Rika if you do you are in danger because remember you tell telling God His Image is a fool hello somebody now you say what do you mean brother I'm trying to say this because you and I we don't have the name of Pentecost we don't have the name of Baptist Lutheran Methodist we don't have those names we have one name amen that is the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen that's our name under Heaven that's the name we travel in that's the name we cast our devils in that's the name we're delivered in and that's the name we receive our virtues you'll never receive the virtues of God Calling On Any Other Name outside of Jesus Christ Hallelujah Isaiah 7:14 said therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel now Emmanuel we know amen was interpreted in Matthew 1:23 as being interpreted God With Us amen now think about it every time you say Emmanuel you're saying God With Us amen but it didn't stop there because the word of God came to a virgin amen and didn't give her a choice on what the child would be called that's right hello that's right he didn't give her a list to say you choose sir because amen God had already determined the name of his son oh come on somebody just like God had already determined your name amen and we realize by the grace of God that that name was determined and his name Shall be Called Jesus which is Jehovah is savior amen hallelujah so every time you say Jesus you're saying Jehovah is savior every time you say Jesus you're saying Save Me Lord whether it's from Deliverance Temptation it doesn't matter he is a savior the name saves you is that right Peter was thinking and he called on him W and God picked him up is that all right now I'm I'm working this thing because I want you to understand the Bible said the whole family of Heaven and Earth is named after him amen but we've been we've not been taking that name to ourselves you know what I mean it's personal because amen when you when you when you speak of the Lord as a second person or a third person now uh uh uh it must come to a place when your name become as it was in Genesis 5:2 their name Adam and they were so United that when the name was spoken they both responded Hallelujah and it so must be with you amen that the name must be spoken amen uh come on somebody that's what I understand that's why the B the devil has taken the name of Jesus out of most Message Church Church you hear William bram's name more than any but there's no power in the name of William Bram there's only power in the name of the Lord Jesus amen and that's why the devil is taking it out and listen what's happening we become powerless oh Lord because we're not named after a prophet amen we're only named after the Lord Jesus Christ amen and when that name is spoken that's why you know something's wrong you can say Willam brandom and they say hey Hallelujah and when you say Jesus Christ they sit still that means you and the name ain't one yet amen huh when you and that name become one you will respond yes sir to that name Hallelujah Joshua oh my God that name also mean Joshua amen Joshua and Jesus Hallelujah and Joshua was a mighty conqueror You'll Never Find Joshua crying out saying Lord have mercy huh Joshua was a warrior amen Joshua Fought amen hallelujah amen you'll never see him whipping and whining like a baby why in the scripture you find him like that never people helped him but he never whined like Moses huh he met the angel come on somebody and if the had not identified himself Joshua was going to fight him amen that's how he is if that if if it don't identify herself as God that the Bride of Jesus Christ is ready with the sword amen she's ready to fight because her name is Joshua amen hallelujah she's Anointed with the spirit of War amen you say that's not true it is true because the prophet of God saw her marching to the on with Christian Soldier marching as to war with the cross of Jesus going on before cuz you can't go with without the cross amen hallelujah amen carry everything you want to but you better have that cross in front of you Hallelujah ain't God good to us amen told Mary said that thing in you that which is in you and you shall bring forth the son told him his name is Jesus his name is Jesus his name is Jesus and the prophet God come in this day and says listen she becomes him amen hallelujah so her name is oh y'all you scared of it her name is Jesus amen ah my Adam God knows what he's speaking Adam and God knows who he's talking to Adam amen so you and I must Realize by the gra of God Amen that what God is working tonight you you and I must come up the ladder we can't stay at the bottom of this tank you and I must come up the ladder amen amen you don't come up the ladder you don't make a Rapture that's right you said well I got the Holy Ghost Solomon said I ain't coming for a bride who's not fully formed amen hallelujah you got to have both uhh can I say it I know we but he said both breasts Hallelujah come on somebody full the Old Testament and the new you know how to work it sir that's that's what he said is that all right amen amen hallelujah ain't God good to us you see what brother Brook what's wrong just like it did in E Ephesus AG the church Lo left her first love her first love was the Holy Ghost she knew nothing else but the Holy Ghost yes sir that's what it was all about the Holy Ghost it wasn't the intellectual thing it was the Holy Ghost most of those people were ignorant and unlearn all they knew was how to cry out to God to get the Holy Ghost amen but we are scared of you know so many people I don't know what it is but I'm going to tell you something you hadn't come this way before you don't know what it is you can't figure it out no more than they can figure it out but when it came amen they knew the difference they saw the change Hallelujah and the power of God was so with them they could say Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have listen you so what brothers it ain't happening now ain't because of individuals don't have it it's because of unbelief even Jesus couldn't do miracles in capernium because they had no faith so don't think amen you ain't got nothing because people ain't getting healed and delivered hey you got to know what you got amen unbeliev is the only thing that keeps it away Jesus himself couldn't do Mighty works when he went into a place of unbelief amen first John 5:4 I'll tell you what y'all I know I know what y'all see how things moving in this world and everybody's so complacent oh but praise God you know I mean it's gonna happen yeah but when it does where are you going to be where are you going to be there's going to be so many people that have heard brother Brooks preach that's going to be really crying out and wishing they had heard and listen hello all I'm trying to tell you you ain't got to be in my company to do nothing you better get it with God because I'm going to tell you something only perfect love getting there right you well brother I'm so busy I got so many things going on in my life hello that was the purpose that's why God put it here he got all these things going on in your life because he's saying listen if you can overcome it and make me number one you'll be there amen you got to overcome it all he wants to be one number one not two one he's got to come before you your family your job your everything he's got to come be number one that's why he's doing all this stuff so that you can overcome it amen for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith H H come on Amen you so what do you mean brother you got to have faith to believe you can overcome amen you can't work with no hope I hope I make it hope becomes your enemy when you act like that you got to have faith and if you don't have faith you got say God give me the faith reveal to me that I am Bri so I can push so I can go forth in God Revelation 2:7 I'm I'm working with overcoming scriptures right now he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God amen come on somebody you'll be able to eat off that tree that Adam couldn't get too Hallelujah the Bible never said he ate off of it but when he would have God closed the door say amen he took he took him in and you know who the tree of life is come on somebody brother BR we would have never known that Jesus Christ stood right there just like the serpent did those two trees both of them personalities standing right in the garden when Adam Eve and sin God put the chairs right there like he did on the Ark of the Covenant don't even touch it don't come close to it I'm enjoying myself so y don't even come close to it amen why because that's the tree of life and if you touch this unclean oh my God death is to you and they were looking for the garden of eaten all that time and here it was God didn't put it in a box hallelujah hallelujah sealed it up in a box it was hidden the very life of the garden was on The Mercy Seat amen yes sir he come on somebody Hallelujah the very life of go of Eden is in you that's why you listen it's God on the throne of your heart amen wouldn't you want is that not what you want yes sir am Hallelujah he was protecting his bride Hallelujah come on somebody if Jesus was back there she was too amen hallelujah and the whole time he was protecting her cuz wherever listen come on somebody only the bride the bride was designed to reproduce and so when the ark when when the bird when the when the when the Aaron put his Rod back there come on somebody and then the spirit of reproduction was back there Hallelujah and brought forth Birds and she was Queen you said that ain't right yes it is I'm going to read it in just a moment amen Revelations 2:11 he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit say unto churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death ain't that good stuff sir Revelation 2:26 he that overcometh keep my Works uh and keepeth my Works unto the end to him will I give power over the Nations what was his Works what was his works his works that was given to you is to believe on him whom God have sent and God sent us Elijah keep the [Music] works Revelations 3:5 he that overcome the same shall be clothed in white rment and will not I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels Revelations 3:12 he that overcome will I make a pillar in the temple of thy go my God and he shall go no more out and I will write up him the name of God in the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from my God and I will write upon him my new name now because you got to realize amen that after Redemption is over God gets a new name and you receive a new name because you're married to him amen oh my you think about it now you can't be a pillar in the temple of God unless you was a pillar in the temple of God before the foundation of the world you say prove that when that woman came up to Jesus as Lord I would my one my son sit on the right and one on the left Jesus said I can't give that to you it's already given amen it was given by my father before the foundation of the world and if you was a pillar in the beginning you'll be a pillar in y'all don't believe that sir Ezekiel Saw all that he did he saw it amen and and different other prophets saw amen and if it wasn't so how could he see something that wasn't already established already established here it is to him that overcome I would Grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am sat down with my father in his Throne not on his throne in his throne that's right you can't go there unless you came from there amen come on somebody what a great invitation like I said last week gold tried in the fire Hallelujah come on somebody listen the point is you already go you just got to be tried purified hallelujah oh these trials and things that we're going through is not there Amen to kill you or to mess you up is to get all that old nasty stuff out of you yes sir and you need to say Lord Let the Fire come and burn all of this wicked stuff out of my spirit out of my soul wherever it is let the fire find it let the fire find it I like that amen Revelations 21:7 he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son son wait a minute he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son think about it my son here it is we in oh come on some oh my my coming out of the out of the Lords of God we are his son and at the same time we set as the bride amen hallelujah oh M he here I like this one 217 he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit said unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden man are you eating off the H oh come on are you eating the hid what do you think you eating they didn't preach this in in Wesley age they didn't preach this in Pentecostal age you eating the hidden man amenallah now I'm talking about those who really eating it cuz if you eating it you're benefiting from it you're growing from it you're changing from it amen and we give him a white stone I feel like shouting amen I feel like shouting brother R tells the story about the white stone no other age had a white stone but our our day amen and he said he cut that the head of that that stone off like a pyramid and he said look on this stay right here and look on this one of these days you'll realize amen this white stone this message why it was pure come on somebody it's Unwritten but yet written amen hallelujah Glory a new name written oh I I tell you what is that the truth brother Bon Pro proven his word he says listen he said no more church he said I call you bride huh only in this day amen is that is that prophet of God he couldn't call us something that we weren't that was the angel of God preaching and calling and changing our name from a church to a bride hallelujah oh maybe it excites me to know amen what God has done and is doing is that all right amen listen coming from Isaiah uh 55 and6 it says seek ye the Lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near now you can't seek God by setting still seeking means to look amen huh the Bible says search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life you got to seek in this word this is your promise you got to go in there and look where the eternal find him that's where Jesus found him in the word that's where all the other uh prophets found him in the word and you and I must find him in the word let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon so don't go before God Amen with year sin that you'd undone 15 20 years ago and still don't believe you got faith to believe he can be pardon you I don't care there are certain things that you can do will never be forgotten because other people have been witnesses to it but when it comes to God there is no witness amen thank you Lord the Bible say not one witness be able to stand against you in that day that's Isaiah 57 I believe it is no weapon no weapon form against you shall prosper none but Lord no it won't be so won't be a stain on our garment uh come on somebody for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayeth the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts but as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not fither but WTH the Earth and make it bring forth and Bud that it may give seed to the sore and bread to the eater what is he saying I'm controlling this that's right I'm the one that planted the seed I'm the one that Waters the seed I'm the one that increase on the seed I'm the one that brings the seed to life just like I said it before amen every day come up and you ain't got a thing to do with it you can pray all night son don't come up and God done already establish that Hallelujah the work for the day it was already established before you woke up is that right he set it in order and no matter how much you want to wish it not to be it cannot come back void so is your life if God is determined you to be bride I don't care every seed don't come up at the same time but they come up that's the important thing and God will make sure you bring forth that's what he said that's what he wor for as the rain cometh down and the stor from heaven and return it not thither but WTH the Earth and maketh it to bring forth in blood that it may give seed to the sore and bread to the eater I love this thing because he said rain and snow that means you got a some good temperatures coming down rain and the winter time coming too but it's for you to grow into bud and make for right you understand some some crops don't do well without a frost or real cold hello somebody now I'm going to tell you something everything I I've ever gone through in this life has been wonderful I can say that now cuz I have had some hard times but when I look and see what he's made of me wo come on somebody it's been worth it all every tear every heartache every headache every everything has been worth it all and guess what he ain't through with me yet amen woo so shall thy word that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the things whether to I sent it y'all believe that amen I believe it and you ought to say well Lord if you feel like you're not prospering take it take this word this scripture and rehearse it back to him in prayer amen Lord this is me you caus me to believe this is me and so now I need to see some Prosperity spiritually yes sir for ye should go out with joy Hallelujah you should go out with joy come on somebody when God calls you to prosper Joy got to be in the mixst it has to be and be led forth with peace the mountains and the hills shall Break Forth before you when singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hand you got to be Qui quite you got to be quite drunk with that Hallelujah you know what I'm saying the mountains are singing and the the trees clapping their hands and you having a good time in God that means you've been in his presence I remember when I first amen uh uh uh experienced with the Holy Ghost I didn't even know whether it was right to crush a roach yeah that's the TRU I feel guilty killing a bug H the truth that's the love of God that's what it does to you it giv you such a sense of joy and love till even an inset becomes important that's why I talk to them when they come buzzing around my head that's you know I give them warning before judgment amen amen to seal those listen had an awesome experience y'all some of y'all know I jog I was jogging down from my house not long just a few days ago last week and here it was this dog had broke the chain and he was growling jumping at other people and and and circling this man with his child and all of that and the man was stand still like that and the dog was still be jumping and carrying on and then so the Lord blessed the man got away and that dog saw me and he started running across the street at me with his noise I say in the name of Jesus he like on a dime on a dime he looked around he looked around he went Hallelujah sniffing to see what I was there now what kind of man it wasn't me it was a God in Me Hallelujah I remember the time I wanted that to happen it didn't but it happened at the time I least expected it to Hallelujah he stopped on a dime right in the middle of the street confused went back and never barked another bark amen who could have done that by God hallelujah I'm not worthy of that Hallelujah but I when I was jogging I had Jesus on my mind Hallelujah glory to God say whenever you do word or deed do it all in the name of Jesus then you know you're saved and protected yes sir is that all right amen listen it's going to take a hungering and a thirsting for this thing amen question and answer he said if you got that if you just get so hungry for God shouting will take place amen if you got so hungry for God speaking in tongues will take place if you got so hungry for God you just keep on hungering keep yourself now you go to see in yourself getting indifferent just remember look out there's another Spirit trying to work itself in there stay right before God humble with travail of soul humble with Prevail of Soul just be all that good old fashion he said I can prove by the Bible that the first time the angel of God went over the land to seal with the Holy Ghost he only sealed those who cried and sigh for the Abomination done in the city Ezekiel 9 chapter is that right he set a seal upon the forehead of those who sigh and cry for the Abomination that done in the city now I want to ask you a question I ask you this you this question now with close just as quickly as I can what would take place today if the Holy Ghost went through Jeffersonville New albony Louis Louisville to seal those this afternoon who would be at home God sent a Revival just so hungry for a meeting oh God look at the sins of the city oh isn't it terrible God oh won't you please send a Revival Hallelujah I ain't got to work with the city I'm working with the church I'm working with this little group Lord s Revival I don't know what you all doing but God knows this little church need a Revival say sin killing Revival Hallelujah sign and that's what I pray for not just for me it's our father amen who are in heaven hallelujah our father give us this day our daily bread come on somebody oh my yes sir I pray for all of us our our we're part of the family we in this a together amen amen I don't just want to be filled of the Holy Ghost and you sitting back there ain't got nothing I want everybody to get it come on somebody you say oh brother I don't know about that let me say it like this brother say the wheat and the tail got baptized that's right Hallelujah now I ain't calling nobody down but I they did Rejoice they did say hallelujah they did say glory to God we ain't even doing that some of us huh oh question answer he said listen the Seal of Christ he says notice then what he says six men coming with slaughtering weapons there came forth a man from The Altar dressed in white all over with a writers incor at his side third verse and notice before the man could go through the slaughter in the in the city he said he said God Mercy God's mercy first before judgment he said I'm sure that's what America's hearing now God's mercy presented to the people before judgment then when he sees seeing this man went forth ring with the inkor at his side he said go into the City and set a seal upon the forehead of those in Jerusalem that sigh and cry for the Abomination that did in the city oh my God what are you saying he said listen why otherwise before the great destruction of 96 Titus sieging the walls of Jerusalem the city the Holy Spirit went forth the men dressed in white with the mark of pencil on his side to put a mark upon the men who sigh and cried for the Abomination that was done in the city and before America that can go up in Flames that got to be a ceiling of God Amen among the bride but she's got to be sing and crying cuz otherwise she won't get it y'all hear that he said that's the only space that we got right now God warned us we done seen amen the Army come and hit us in 9911 you think it's over Titus came the first time and Jerusalem thought it was over he came again and then the last time he came he finished it off the same thing is happening to America right now we Fallen right into Trails of of of Jerusalem what Israel went through and people are acting the same way among the bride is that right you said there was no calling out in that day yes it was there was a calling out because Jesus said amen when you see the Army Compass about he said the only people who did not get slaughtered in the city was those who didn't go back for their stuff huh the only Christians heard Jesus message those Christians that heard his message escaped out of the city amen and those Christians amen who hear this prophet's message will escape that's right amen God for telling it so that there'll be uh to get ready I want to ask you something if the same angel came to the city with which was the Holy Spirit dressed in white like his to his Purity if that angel came to this city tonight and went through the Pentecostal Church where in the world will it be will he find men that shy and cries and beg all night long in prayer for the Abomination that's done in the city who would be marked we're going to find out who's got the Holy Ghost pretty soon why we will become so Brazen so indifferent and have a pity a a little bitty prayer maybe when we get up and God bless me and Mary and Martha and all the rest of the family the rest of them do the best they can and men and women on the street sinning you know that's the truth no matter no no more burden for the loss just let them go on anyway as long as we can proelite a little bit and help our calls out fix our denomination up so that it could be the biggest and and get more people in the church and then we're Justified brother that that's good oldfashioned castra but it'll fix you up you know say that's what we need did y'all know that he said you're constipated he literally uses that need some good castol to get all the junk out of us amen is that all right give me five more minutes amen is that all right oh my you look at the hour and it's so late and we see people amen and listen uh uh yeah yeah cuz we we'll do some more on this on Sunday but anyway by the grace of God I want you to see he says listen in the Oneness of unity he said the Seal of God brother bam the Holy Ghost you say is that scripture absolutely many of them let me give you one so you won't forget it Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed to the day of your Redemption there's the Seal of God that's what I'm trying to tell you you looked for the Seal of God to come in the last days not on your forehead saying it was on your forehead is your knowledge to understand saying that it's on your forehead is your knowledge to understand but the Bible said the Seal of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and everybody that has it their hearts are free they seal by the knowledge of God in their forehead that they do know that Jesus is dead and raised again because they can see him a little while and the unbeliever will see me no more yet you'll see me the ones that got the seal for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world you know when you're doing righteous it ain't you Paul understood that concept he said it's not I that live but Christ that lives in me come on somebody you see him through by The Works that he do in you and through you even in you to to the end of the world the works that I do shall you also even greater than this for I go to my father the unbelieving world walks along in Gross Darkness around some Tow Of Babylon a touch of something another around some Superstition some cult while the real believer and the signs and wonders and in hid from the eyes of the unbeliever open your hearts now and let him come in I am going to ask the ministers also into the buildings to pray especially at this time this is a great moment this moment will seal the destination no doubt of many one Soul were of many one Soul worth 10,000 world how great is this moment and I'm going to close right there but so many people they had no idea of their visitation they looked at a man and they saw the man and and they judged his uh appearance and uh perhaps they thought they knew a little bit about his background but understand Jesus had lies going on about his background and there were a lot of people who believed those lies and called Jesus a false prophet come on somebody so is it in your day you think people ain't lying on you they going to lie on you you may not here to two or three years down the road but lies been told on you the devil going to make sure they're told on you amen he goes on and says Lord God creator of Heaven and Earth Jehovah reach down just now by the mercies of the Lord Jesus the blessed one and pour the holy oil of your spirit into every heart here those who are hungry it is written in the Bible while Peter spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on them have you ever been hungry now I'm going tell y'all something y'all know y'all know it's the truth you could be hungry for a hamburger or steak or whatever but when you hungry you going to go through that refrigerate and you might have to settle for whatever's in there but you you you going to satisfy the hunger pain and you might still go get your burger y'all

telling you folks when you hungry you going to go for it that's what brother B said he said a real hungry man if he doesn't find the truth he'll find himself eating out of a garbage can that's what a Hungry Man will do and when your soul is hungry you don't have to curse people to come to church please come if you hungry you going to be there that's right [Music] amen have y'all been ever been

of their little L snacks and everything and they wait and wait and you know what I'm going to tell you something they stampeded they don't drag themselves in the church they Stampede I'm going tell you when I used to go to the Pentecostal church if you didn't get there early there was no seat people would be running to get in the chairs that's when the anointing was and then still was lifting at that time I can't imagine what it was like before then running amen we full up if you didn't come early you might as well forget it you're in the back of the balcony God have mercy on our soul I I I've seen changes even in message churches I can remember the churches used to have gifts all every every church had gifts tongues interpretation and everything wisdom you think about Visions people all things they where is it now cuz the intellectuals have cut the the Holy Ghost out we don't need that anymore we do need it I don't want a part one eye I want both of my eyes amen I want all the whole body that's what's wrong with Pentecost and all the worldly churches they all messed up right one arm one leg and all that stuff no I want the whole body I want everything God promised people say well you know that yeah yes it is Pentecostal but that's what he promised amen he said we'll be just like him it wasn't those people on the day of Pentecost that made themselves what they were it was the Holy Ghost in them like brother said it wasn't the Acts of the Apostles it was the acts of the Holy Ghost in the apostles amen and that's what we want we want the acts of the Holy Ghost in This little church called Higher Ground we come to be United United United this is a uniting time of the Bride of Jesus Christ ah is that all right let's stand we'll finish up on Sunday Lord with God is to us a name better than Sons and Daughters you know think about it Sarah if she hadn't married Abraham she would have still been his sister but when she married Abraham she became his wife as a sister he couldn't give her the intimacy that he may have desired but when he married her he can he could give her everything thing everything that Abraham had and belonged to Sarah now who used to be his sister oh my God Solomon say my sister my spouse see because I said Lord I'm concerned how this thing dropped in me like that and then that's where God brings it right to Solomon I'm like oh there it is hallelujah it's good when the Holy Ghost give you something freshen amen then comes along and bring it to us people you bless I'm going tell oh Lord have mercy we are so blessed and let me tell y'all something there are so many people out there right now who's emailing me calling me and everything wanting us to put those messages back on on on on on on online so they can hear it and I said oh my God is that not a rebuke to the people in this church come on somebody you won't even go home take it home with you to listen to it and those are people who one brother said brother I done I done gone over it ad done went over it you know there's no more you it's done when where how my pastor amen from from South Carolina called and said the people want to hear it I didn't even know they were listening to it I said well you know what God you're faith for amen when the man of God are here may not seem like nothing to you but down there somewhere somewhere out there they're being blessed even in South Africa the people so we going to get it back up by the grace of God somehow God going to open the door even if we've got to get internet here ourselves we gonna get her done hello somebody oh it's true a prophet is without honor his own country I don't produce I don't claim to be anything or try to be nothing but I'm saying these things only to rebuke you amen God has given you words of life and you don't even recognize it special things special things how many brothers are so in tune now to know what God is doing in this season folks still working with people's head and God trying to get to your heart working on your heart and I'm just a preacher that's what brother say God's presence unrecognized I know that when I'm preaching who is up here the saddest thing is many of us you don't and I just trust by the grace of God there going some people somebody in here gonna make a Rapture amen I know that I know that I know that you know and I I tell you I put it this way not that I'm somebody but I'm going tell you something there have been times I didn't have nothing to preach and God said do it gives it to me things that I I I wasn't even thinking about I'm I'm just sitting home meditating thinking about God and what should I preach and God just opens his up and boom I know no man can do it I'm not even that smart to do it but the god in me he knows what he wants and I'm going tell you something you can't there is no way you can have the Amen in you and he ain't going to amen his word cuz God even amen himself when he created all of Heaven he said that's good let's pray father God we come before you humble as we know how we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for your love father you've been so good to us and Lord we better because of you and we're climbing this ladder Because of You Lord I have surrendered all my efforts I've surrendered all my efforts I've surrendered all my efforts because I

that people will see that all that you asking for them from them is a surrendered heart somebody who love eternal life amen and desire it more than their own life like David said Lord ah he love you more better than life and God that's the kind of a people you're looking for that loves you better and More Than This Life and whatever it can offer Lord I pray that you grant us Victory continuously Lord I Thank You for Your Grace I thank you for your mercy Lord I thank you Father for everything you're doing for us in these last and evil days father bless your people Lord open our hearts and our ears May our eyes be be be be open Lord let us not be like Samson father where the world has taken our eyes and shut them for us maybe we be able to have spiritual eyes to see the day that we're living in granted Lord we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
