[1:49] open with a word of Prayer amen just
[1:52] remember sister just to Ruby's mother
[1:55] sister Ruby in the hospital here men
[1:57] keep her in prayer amen
[2:09] pshh ever wonder what I'm saying when I
[2:12] whisper in his ears it's always god
[2:15] bless you
[2:15] it's good to see you and the same to you
[2:19] they meant had a wonderful eye all
[2:25] started probably back last last Friday
[2:28] maybe before that but at work with a
[2:32] manacle workers had a real radical
[2:36] cancer and radical treatment very
[2:39] invasive and nothing seemed to work he's
[2:43] probably went from 250 one time down to
[2:45] about 134 and you know I always just
[2:50] lift him up to the Lord and just the
[2:53] Lord never showed me to go and pray with
[2:55] him to be alongside him it was very
[2:58] clear that was a Holy Ghost but last
[3:04] week on Friday unbeknownst to me I
[3:07] didn't know I was going downstairs to
[3:09] pray with him but I walked there and the
[3:12] Lord said go in there and sat down and
[3:15] just started talking with him and waited
[3:19] for the not to jump ahead and the Holy
[3:24] Ghost it's led being all utterance what
[3:28] to say it wasn't my words at all and I
[3:32] don't think this man would tell you at
[3:35] all that I was you know being a threat
[3:41] to his personal will but I just asked
[3:45] him to tell me what he thought were this
[3:48] was all going because his cancer was
[3:51] growing he had real bad cancer surgery
[3:54] and that it didn't seem to have an
[3:58] effect and literally opening Milkin lady
[4:00] and wide opening they kind of did
[4:03] wallpaper if you will on the insides of
[4:07] him and I had a couple doctors it was
[4:10] involved with it and he shared with me
[4:14] that he was praying which was really for
[4:17] this guy a big deal and he also said
[4:21] I really have hope that things are gonna
[4:25] be better and I said well and he's gonna
[4:26] go to the doctor on on the next day and
[4:32] I said what do you think the doctors
[4:34] gotta say from your x-rays and he said I
[4:36] think it's gonna get better and I said
[4:38] well can we just lift that up and kind
[4:41] of pray with you and he said absolutely
[4:43] and that was a big big thing because
[4:46] this man doesn't pray and so we prayed
[4:51] and all I can tell you is I went into a
[4:56] Holy Ghost revival I don't know if he
[4:58] knew it or not but there was a man there
[5:01] that's not all Christian or outside his
[5:03] office and and he says Keith it looks
[5:07] like you're having a real wonderful day
[5:09] you're really happy and you know for a
[5:14] person that's not a believer that that's
[5:19] a mr. big words a big testimony I
[5:21] believe that was God and I tried to walk
[5:24] upstairs on my I wasn't sure I was gonna
[5:26] be able to go because I just felt just
[5:29] words won't begin best supply me what I
[5:33] need to say but so I went in the office
[5:36] and sat down and just tried to clock
[5:39] myself well that he was gone next day
[5:44] doctor came back the next day and I you
[5:51] know we just wanted to hear or something
[5:53] because I knew something was had
[5:54] happened and so I went into his office
[5:59] and I said well Harley tell me about the
[6:02] doctor visit and he said well the doctor
[6:05] that was there that's always
[6:07] everything's half he said half cloudy
[6:12] and the other ones
[6:14] the doctors are half sunny type reporter
[6:17] and I it's kind of different
[6:19] Kuki HD I never heard of that before but
[6:21] he said the half cloudy guy was there
[6:24] and he said he reported that the cancer
[6:29] that was in my lung is completely gone
[6:32] and that the cancer that was in his
[6:37] kidney is was 25% reduced so I told him
[6:43] I said you know the devil would Lord
[6:45] just showed me the devil's I'm gonna
[6:46] give up he'll come right back at you and
[6:48] so that we just need to keep walking
[6:51] this together and and it was just
[6:53] beautiful I I gotta just tell you to
[6:56] make sure everybody's clear here in the
[6:58] witness before God this was not done
[7:02] this healing was not done by man it was
[7:06] done by the person Jesus Christ that
[7:10] work was done it was completed and
[7:12] there's you know those people may not
[7:14] ever heard of this the message they have
[7:16] prayed for this man I believe they all
[7:19] had in effect and I just thank God for
[7:23] placing those people in around him and
[7:26] I'll just continue to report the
[7:29] complete restoration and just bringing
[7:32] him more into the fall and not just
[7:35] praying but talking about the word and
[7:38] how it applies to him so good to hear
[7:41] about sister Ruby's mother are being
[7:44] cared for by the doctors and let's just
[7:46] go before the throne of grace lifting
[7:51] her and others up it have need if you
[7:54] have need to show the Lord he knows your
[7:56] thoughts
[7:57] he knows what your needs are before you
[8:01] lifted your hand probably God we come to
[8:05] you in the name of Jesus Christ under
[8:07] the shed blood of the Lamb and we thank
[8:11] you for your grace that wonderful blood
[8:15] we thank you for your wonderful word it

[9:26] defeated death hell and the grave and
[9:28] that whatever we bind here on earth and

[10:04] not a love a fleshly love but the love
[10:08] of Jesus Christ and we thank you Lord
[10:12] for as I recall the grip some of the
[10:15] scripture you laid on my heart there
[10:17] last week was that the prayer of faith
[10:21] shall heal the sick and or not that
[10:26] wasn't my faith that was the faith that
[10:28] you gave me the faith that I received

[10:58] prior to the lost doctor appointment
[11:01] that one-pound so is precious and made

[11:19] her to him Lord I pray we take these

[20:14] destitute of the things that life

[20:22] steals and according to his words
[20:39] [Music]
[20:46] [Music]
[21:08] [Music]
[21:27] hey we'll understand it better
[21:33] bye and we think the law for His grace
[21:37] and His mercy you may be seated just for
[21:40] the moment my wife was supposed to tell
[21:43] us testimony on what was that today
[21:45] Sunday and somehow it was I guess it was
[21:52] the will of the law for me to tell it so
[21:58] we thank God for His grace in His mercy
[22:00] but on our way out down to Louisville
[22:06] the first play we got on we were already
[22:11] on the runway we're picking up speed and
[22:14] all of a sudden the pilot stopped on
[22:17] brakes as if we had hit something and
[22:20] what had happened
[22:22] some kind of light turn on motor
[22:25] whatever I don't know but it was enough
[22:28] for him to haunt the plane right then so
[22:31] we had to deplane and so it took about
[22:35] two and a half to three hours for them
[22:38] to repair whatever that was wrong so
[22:40] after that time around 9:30 going on 10
[22:44] we got aboard the plane again and this
[22:49] time even before we got on the runway
[22:51] the plane completely shut down and the
[22:54] emergency lights came on this was one
[22:57] trip I was glad my wife wasn't with me
[22:59] on and I don't I thank you so anyhow the
[23:09] pilot said well we can work through this
[23:11] and he worked through it and all of
[23:13] everything seemed like it started
[23:14] functioning well and so we got on the
[23:17] runway again this is the third time we
[23:19] going up everything looks good we clear
[23:24] the clouds I think it was around the
[23:25] time we loved it off is when we started
[23:28] losing cabin pressure so I looked and I
[23:34] looked down and I thought Lord I said
[23:37] Lord you didn't tell me I was going to
[23:38] die today
[23:42] hey I said to the Lord and then all of a
[23:45] sudden seeing how far we had to fall I
[23:48] didn't mind the dying but seeing how
[23:51] fall the drop was that's my heart stop
[23:53] fluttering a little bit I don't know
[23:55] whether I thought it or I said it but
[23:57] anyway something came perfect love casts
[23:59] out fear and just as sure as I thought
[24:01] it was saying it went away
[24:03] see it was just so much happening the
[24:05] lady the stewardess she's trying to act
[24:07] like she's not nervous and she's
[24:09] carrying on and everybody the body
[24:11] language is telling you she's she's out
[24:14] of control
[24:15] but prior to that prior to that before
[24:18] the everything started this lady was
[24:20] talking to someone in front of me and
[24:22] she looked at me and she says what is
[24:24] dad and she circled my face and I have
[24:27] been listening to prophet of God you
[24:29] know different messages I just was I was
[24:32] in the spirit of the Lord and she says
[24:35] it looks like and she started to say
[24:37] like she didn't say it but she did like
[24:39] that again and she put her hand on my
[24:42] shoulder and say you know thank you
[24:44] you're different you're different she
[24:46] said that and then that's when the
[24:50] trouble started all of a sudden the
[24:54] pilot call her back there and I don't
[24:57] know I was just smiling and praying and
[25:01] after that whatever left me she came
[25:04] back and I'm she said thank you I said
[25:09] all I c-can't be all right now I say
[25:10] it's gonna be all right and she said
[25:12] thank you thank you and then she went
[25:15] back again and started talking to
[25:18] everybody else but she couldn't keep her
[25:19] eyes off me she kept looking at me now I
[25:23] don't know what all she saw I think she
[25:25] saw the light of God I really do believe
[25:28] it because I told her you know when I
[25:30] told it was gonna be all right I said
[25:31] I'm a Christian you know what I mean and
[25:34] so she said we're gonna land we're gonna
[25:39] land you know you gotta brace yourself
[25:41] she teaching us how she said landing but
[25:43] she teaching us how to crash but they
[25:48] can't say we gonna crash they have to
[25:49] say we're gonna land so anyway she's
[25:52] teaching us how
[25:53] how to do everything and you know the
[25:56] Lord blessed because whatever the pilot
[25:58] did he got us in a place where
[26:00] everything then fall out and all that
[26:02] stuff so she said I don't know where
[26:04] we're gonna land but we got a land and
[26:06] and she said I'm and I'm looking at the
[26:10] wind and I see all the snow and ice you
[26:14] know so anyhow I wasn't worried God
[26:17] knows I wasn't because once the Lord
[26:20] gave me peace I was okay and after I
[26:24] told her we was okay then somewhere in
[26:27] this cuz everybody was trying not to get
[26:31] excited I think the stewardess was more
[26:33] excited she says we train for the stuff
[26:36] of which thing we know how to have she's
[26:39] trying to convince herself and I think
[26:43] everybody knew that so everybody else
[26:45] was quiet and I don't know what they
[26:46] were doing in the back of me but
[26:48] nevertheless a man when she found out
[26:51] that we were gonna land in Des Moines
[26:54] she was going to Des Moines the product
[26:56] out it under control and we're gonna
[26:58] land so now we don't need all of the
[27:01] fire trucks and all of the stuff that
[27:03] you just said all the thing and see we
[27:06] did we had no idea to had call on the
[27:08] fire trucks but she told us you know way
[27:10] of speaking and she came right back to
[27:14] me again she says thank you I really
[27:17] appreciate you so God showed her
[27:20] something and I'm thankful for that I
[27:23] told her I was a Christian you know when
[27:25] we got out there into into the what you
[27:29] call it terminal yeah she said it again
[27:32] and so I was gonna try to witness to her
[27:35] more but I think she's just too nervous
[27:37] to hear anything cuz she still was
[27:40] pressed but God God gave us peace and
[27:44] then there's one guy he was on there's a
[27:47] big guy he was up in first class he said
[27:49] where are you going I said I'm going to
[27:51] Louisville Kentucky he's a man and you
[27:54] gonna get back on another plane he said
[27:56] I would be calling me a cab on hooba I
[28:00] said it doesn't matter I said we gotta
[28:02] die anyway I said if it whether it be a
[28:05] plane or a car
[28:06] and God call you number that's it he
[28:09] probably he looked at me I don't know
[28:10] what he was thinking after that
[28:11] statement but nevertheless God prayer
[28:15] because my wife was feeling something
[28:17] and she was praying and then also
[28:19] brother Brad Burgess had called me prior
[28:22] and said that he was praying as well so
[28:25] there are prayers going up that I didn't
[28:27] even know nothing about for those of you
[28:29] who got anointed to pray during that
[28:31] time we appreciate your prayers God is
[28:34] good to us you know but I tell you what
[28:37] he has never failed me cuz he could have
[28:40] had me hysterical he could have had me
[28:42] just but soon is that perfect love casts
[28:45] out fear and you know what it didn't
[28:48] come from outside outside in it was from
[28:50] inside out and I thank God for that
[28:53] experience
[28:54] Amen cuz sometimes the enemy try to get
[28:57] to you worried do you have it you know
[28:59] do you do you have it like the Bible
[29:01] saying do you have it exactly like you
[29:03] know enough to make a rapture because I
[29:05] believe the rapture is at hand and I
[29:08] want to make sure I got what it takes to
[29:10] take a translation you know I just been
[29:14] listening to different messages letter
[29:15] stand and this is one of the things that
[29:18] God has given me to speak upon tonight
[29:21] those of you who may may know may not
[29:23] know I won't be here the Sun Sunday I've
[29:26] got to go to to Manitoba Canada up there
[29:29] to take care of some things and while
[29:33] there the pastor asked me in a minister
[29:35] so I would be ministering I'm not going
[29:37] to preach I'm going to settle some
[29:39] things with the couple there and so
[29:44] anyway anything to bring peace God's
[29:46] will be done
[29:47] Joshua please we're going to come from
[29:51] two passes of Scripture Joshua one six
[29:54] through nine and Ephesians 1 5 through
[29:57] 13 one amazing thing astounding things
[30:03] that I found in Louisville if you ever
[30:05] go down that way and you want a church
[30:07] to go to Brad Burgesses Church I would
[30:09] recommend he's a real godly man the
[30:13] house was full evening service full and
[30:18] you know what he said to me
[30:19] he said even on Thursday nights is full
[30:22] and I'm talking about 300 people are
[30:25] more gas and he said you know he doesn't
[30:27] even have trouble with people coming to
[30:30] church so I've got to get with him to
[30:33] find out what he's doing Lord God that
[30:40] sounds so good
[30:42] but they do believe in the Holy Ghost so
[30:44] and the Holy Spirit showed up praise the
[30:47] Lord
[30:48] Joshua 1 6 through 9 be strong and of a
[30:53] good courage for unto this people shalt
[30:57] thou divide for an inheritance the land
[30:59] which I swear unto their fathers to give
[31:03] them only be thou strong and very
[31:07] courageous he didn't just say courageous
[31:10] he said very courageous that thou made
[31:13] observe to do according to all the law
[31:16] and I'm gonna put it here to observe and
[31:21] do all according to the message which
[31:24] Moses my servant commanded thee which
[31:28] Elijah o brother branham my servant had
[31:31] commanded thee turn not from it to the
[31:34] right hand or to the left
[31:36] that thou may prosper whether so ever
[31:39] thou goeth this book of the law shall
[31:43] not depart out of thy mouth but thou
[31:47] shalt meditate therein day and night
[31:49] that thou may observe to do according to
[31:52] all that is written therein for then
[31:55] thou shalt make that way prosperous and
[31:58] then shalt thou shalt have good success
[32:01] I have not I commanded thee be strong
[32:05] and of a good courage as' chorus choose
[32:08] me be not afraid I like that
[32:10] neither be thou dismayed for the Lord
[32:13] thy God is with thee whether so ever
[32:16] thou go it it fees is 1 5 through 13 now
[32:23] he even he's emphasizing this and here
[32:26] it is these people are following the law
[32:29] is that right
[32:30] but Joshua the Holy Spirit
[32:33] a man is taking them over Ephesians 1 5
[32:36] through 13 it is so important that he
[32:40] says observe it look at it study it
[32:42] meditate on it day and night amen and to
[32:46] do what not to gain just knowledge
[32:48] knowledge is good but it's no good if
[32:51] it's not applicable if you're not going
[32:53] to apply it it ain't gonna do you no
[32:55] good that right if he's just 1 5 through
[33:00] 13 haven't predestinated us unto the
[33:04] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[33:06] himself according to the good pleasure
[33:09] of his will to the praise of the glory
[33:13] of His grace wherein he have made us
[33:16] what accepted in the beloved in whom we
[33:20] have the redemption through his blood
[33:22] the forgiveness of sin according to the
[33:25] riches of His grace wherein he have
[33:28] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[33:31] prudence having made known unto us the
[33:34] mystery of his will according to his
[33:37] good pleasure which he had purposed in
[33:40] himself that in the dispensation of the
[33:43] fullness of time he might gather
[33:45] together in one all things in Christ
[33:48] both which are in heaven and which are
[33:51] on earth even in him now he's telling us
[33:54] a great thing here Paul is explaining
[33:56] some great mysteries here amen and by
[33:59] the grace of God amen we are part of it
[34:02] in whom also we have obtained an
[34:04] inheritance being predestinated
[34:07] according to the purpose of him who
[34:09] worketh all things after the counsel of
[34:12] his own will his will not yours or mine
[34:15] is right that we should not be pray be
[34:20] the praise of his glory who first
[34:22] trusted in Christ that we should be to
[34:26] the praise of his glory who first
[34:28] trusted in Christ in whom he also
[34:30] trusted after ye have heard the word of
[34:33] truth the gospel of your salvation in
[34:35] whom also after that ye believed ye were
[34:39] sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise
[34:42] father God we come before your Lord as
[34:47] humbly as we know how we thank you for
[34:50] your grace and your mercy we thank you
[34:52] for being so good to us O Lord you've
[34:55] been better to us than we've been to
[34:57] ourselves words cannot even express our
[35:00] gratitude Lord sometimes my body faints
[35:03] father when it comes to worship and
[35:05] praise because there is no expression
[35:08] that we can make Lord to let you know
[35:11] how much we love and care and thank you
[35:14] for your Redemption Lord bless the
[35:16] service tonight in Jesus Christ's name
[35:19] we pray amen
[35:20] you may be seated I'm gonna be doing a
[35:29] lot of reading but I just want by God's
[35:32] grace your attention and trust by God
[35:36] that he will take the Word of God and
[35:38] really put it into your hearts in such a
[35:42] way that you'll leave here different
[35:45] lead tonight I entitled this message
[35:49] don't fear the battle and you know
[35:54] because a lot of time we we think that
[35:56] we're in control sometimes we forget
[36:00] it's God in control sometimes we forget
[36:04] is not by power not by might but by his
[36:08] spirit sometimes we forget is that him
[36:11] that will it no he that runneth but God
[36:14] who shows mercy so I thought by God's
[36:18] grace if I could just get us to see the
[36:21] way God allowed me to see how perfect
[36:26] his plans are and you and I must realize
[36:30] Amen this that God plan is not based
[36:33] upon somebody's theology God's plan is
[36:36] based upon his own purpose in his own
[36:39] will when we talk about predestination I
[36:43] think sometimes we forget what
[36:45] predestination really means but it means
[36:48] to be for Dane by a divine decree or
[36:52] purpose it means to be anointed and
[36:55] appointed
[36:56] to do God's will and his purpose so we
[37:01] realized that okay we established that
[37:03] by God's grace oh now we must realize
[37:05] that whatever God has spoken out of his
[37:10] mouth cannot come back boy
[37:12] what's ever written in the word the
[37:15] Bible says heaven and earth will pass
[37:17] away but the word of the Lord shall
[37:20] stand and if you can see yourself
[37:24] tonight as bride that means God has
[37:27] given you that revelation not in your
[37:30] head but in your heart so if you can see
[37:33] that tonight then you need to come to a
[37:35] place of rest that he that began a good
[37:39] work in you is faithful to complete it
[37:42] you're not the completing portion of it
[37:45] God completes you is that right
[37:49] but I look at this now because you
[37:51] you've got to understand that God Joshua
[37:54] let's start with the scripture here with
[37:56] Joshua and when Joshua is the type of
[37:59] Jesus it's a type of the Holy Spirit we
[38:02] realize a man that here God had already
[38:05] chosen Moses and God told Moses what his
[38:09] calling was even though Moses refused at
[38:13] the beginning because he felt inadequate
[38:15] to do God's work but we find out that
[38:19] that it wasn't that God that Moses was
[38:23] adequate it was that God made him
[38:26] adequate it was because God stepped into
[38:28] Moses and that's why Moses was able to
[38:32] do what God wanted him to do likewise
[38:35] you and I must understand even though we
[38:38] are the thoughts of God even though we
[38:40] have God has predestinated us when we
[38:44] come into this dimension we cannot do
[38:48] what God wants us to do until the word
[38:51] in us is quickened you see what I'm
[38:54] saying
[38:55] in other words Jesus though he was the
[38:58] word he was not only the word he was God
[39:00] but that same word needed to be filled
[39:05] it needed to be quickened by the spirit
[39:09] that we call father is that right it
[39:12] took the Holy Ghost to come down and
[39:14] declare this is my beloved Son in whom
[39:17] I'm well pleased to dwell in so we
[39:21] realized by God's grace it was after
[39:23] being Jesus ministry started he went
[39:27] into the wilderness and you and I know
[39:30] that no natural man could fast 40 days
[39:33] and 40 nights without the help of the
[39:37] Lord or leadership of the Holy Spirit so
[39:39] we realized amen being children of God
[39:43] being attributes of God we didn't know
[39:46] this you are the mystery of the whole
[39:50] entire Bible Christ in you the hope of
[39:55] glory
[39:56] Ephesians picks it up Paul who was a
[39:59] prophet of God was able to pick it up
[40:02] and he's now showing the Gentiles where
[40:06] they fit in in the plan of God right
[40:10] amen the world at large and did meet
[40:13] making it different whether he was an
[40:15] MRI da Canaanite ax here a parasite or
[40:19] whatever knew that the Jews worship did
[40:24] you hold of God they saw him on display
[40:28] they felt his wrath they knew his
[40:33] kindness toward Israel y'all remember
[40:36] that email and you see but Israel needed
[40:40] to keep in mind who they were because it
[40:44] was the enemy that kept up occupying
[40:49] their minds with with nonsense you
[40:53] understand me
[40:54] that's why God said it to Israel when
[40:56] you go through the land don't look to
[40:57] the left nor the right you just keep
[40:59] straight so you said well what do you
[41:02] mean brother Brooks you got to
[41:03] understand that the whole principle of
[41:06] the Bible is the thought of God his old
[41:09] theme
[41:09] he's the theme of everything right and
[41:13] if we could follow him we can go back to
[41:16] Genesis and I love Genesis because
[41:19] Genisys does something there in Genesis
[41:21] that is out of the context or seem to be
[41:25] something that God put a little delay on
[41:28] it to to make something seen in other
[41:31] words God could have created Adam and
[41:34] Adam and separated them so they could
[41:36] both be seen but there was a mystery in
[41:39] the mind of God that he wanted to put on
[41:42] delay right that if you look at it Adam
[41:46] was actually made on the sixth day and
[41:48] before the sixth right in the sixth day
[41:50] between the sixth and the seventh if I
[41:52] could say it like that
[41:53] Amen God divided something I could say
[41:57] like this he he ripped that seal open
[42:00] and in opening that seal which which was
[42:04] Adam which was a man under the sixth
[42:06] seal was revealed his bride who she was
[42:11] is that right and so Adam was the only
[42:14] one that could actually tell Eve where
[42:17] she came from
[42:20] hallelujah Amen because Adam was in the
[42:23] image of God he was literally God on
[42:26] earth
[42:26] so Adam said to Eve you're born of my
[42:30] bone and flesh of my flesh in other
[42:33] words you're not a chimpanzee you're not
[42:35] a monkey you're not a ring thing you
[42:38] came from me it was God's expression
[42:43] free expression of himself that at the
[42:47] end right but the sixth seal between the
[42:51] sixth and the seventh seal which you see
[42:53] the seventh seal was a day of rest right
[42:56] in between the sixth and seventh seal
[42:59] God was going to unveil his bride a
[43:04] mystery that he held from the beginning
[43:08] of time even heaven didn't know what God
[43:12] was doing hmm so you see we were we're
[43:17] right here and I want to take my time
[43:20] because you and I we ought to be just
[43:22] shouting the glories of God because
[43:25] first of all if you bribed your bride
[43:27] and if you're not you're not and only
[43:30] god knows who that
[43:33] but if you can gather within your heart
[43:36] and mind that you came from God and you
[43:38] go back to God you've got something that
[43:41] most people don't have we don't fear the
[43:48] bottom
[43:49] we're not fearing the battle the battle
[43:53] is going to come and the battle is now
[43:57] but you don't feel Lord I'm gonna be
[43:59] lost don't fear the battle because you
[44:03] cannot be lost those who work with God
[44:06] in the beginning cannot be lost
[44:11] he said you didn't choose me I chose you
[44:17] that's what he said he said Israel I
[44:20] didn't choose you because you look so
[44:22] wonderfully and we're so beautiful and
[44:24] great in number matter of fact you were
[44:26] small in number few in number I chose
[44:31] you
[44:32] now that that gives me something to know
[44:36] that God chose me the perfect God chose
[44:39] me so therefore his choice of choosing
[44:42] me is perfect his choice of choosing you
[44:46] is perfect right iris all in the word
[44:51] with brother branham called
[44:53] this message he called it the Feast of
[44:57] the Messiah and when I saw that the
[45:01] Feast of the Messiah
[45:03] I saw what Jesus was leading the people
[45:06] up to all along and when he began there
[45:09] and Saint John since he says I am The
[45:13] Living bread which came down from heaven
[45:15] If any man eat of this bread he shall
[45:20] live forever and the bread that I give
[45:24] is my flesh which I give for the life of
[45:28] the world now watch this because he's
[45:31] going to go down here and he's gonna say
[45:32] a few things
[45:33] amen they kind of throw the Jews off
[45:36] because they can say well our Father did
[45:39] eat manna in the wilderness and Jesus
[45:41] got an answer for them because you
[45:44] realize amen this was still a tight
[45:47] right let me put it this way God is a
[45:51] God of amor faith and in the Garden of
[45:54] Eden how did God stand where was he
[45:59] because you know God is in all you know
[46:02] he's always a part of the drama the very
[46:04] theme of the whole Bible is God or
[46:08] Christ however you want to put it but he
[46:11] didn't create the Garden of Eden and
[46:13] leave himself out right now he shows
[46:19] himself he meant in such a way he's
[46:22] working with Adam as a man but he also
[46:25] working has the Tree of Life but as the
[46:28] Tree of Life he's just standing there is
[46:31] that right cuz brother Balaam said the
[46:33] tree of life is a person said it was
[46:35] Jesus Christ God in our favor he stood
[46:39] there as the Tree of Life remember that
[46:43] God is a God that doesn't force you to
[46:45] do anything he always gives you a choice
[46:48] and that was the thing that he gave to
[46:52] Adam and Eve a choice now you said well
[46:55] what do you mean let me say it like this
[46:57] it does not say that II was instructed
[47:02] by Adam take not to eat up of that tree
[47:05] but she was in Adam when God spoke
[47:13] that's why the Word of God when it comes
[47:16] to you and strikes the seed is somehow
[47:19] sounds familiar
[47:23] it makes sense because in Adam was Adam
[47:28] and she heard what God said it Adam even
[47:32] in that fall so when God separated Adam
[47:37] and Eve amen even Adam was on one Accord
[47:40] there was no sin there was no confusion
[47:43] and you say well how could she
[47:45] understand her husband if he didn't tell
[47:48] her what the law said the same way Adam
[47:52] understood God when it came to naming
[47:55] the animals they were one spirit
[48:00] is that right oh come on somebody when
[48:04] Jesus talked with his disciples he said
[48:06] you know it all things no so you and I
[48:14] must understand this mystery is deeper
[48:16] than what you can imagine it takes us
[48:19] the revelation of Jesus Christ this is
[48:21] why it's so important to get the Holy
[48:23] Ghost because without the Holy Ghost you
[48:26] can't channel into the beginning and
[48:28] you'll never understand the ending it is
[48:32] the Holy Spirit who is God himself
[48:34] once he's he's in you you become as he
[48:38] is and you understand all things you
[48:41] might say well oh Lord I don't
[48:43] understand in your soul your soul knows
[48:47] the truth then he go on the Jews
[48:51] therefore strong among themselves saying
[48:53] how can this man give us his flesh to
[48:57] eat then jesus said unto them verily
[49:00] verily i said to you except you eat the
[49:03] flesh of the son of man and drink his
[49:06] blood he have no life in you didn't it
[49:10] funny because the bible said if G if
[49:14] Adam and Eve had Pro take up the Tree of
[49:17] Life they would have lived forever
[49:19] there's only one eternal life it shows
[49:23] that Jesus Christ he is the same tree of
[49:27] life and because he could not offer life
[49:31] if he wasn't like who so who whoso
[49:39] eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood
[49:42] heavy eternal life and I will raise him
[49:44] up at the last day now she's the same
[49:47] thing so eating over here in Genesis
[49:52] it's the same thing is eating over here
[49:54] it means to partake to protect
[49:59] that word to eat up that word and he
[50:03] said what do you mean but we realized by
[50:06] God's grace or when he says now you eat
[50:09] it you partake of it that's why we
[50:11] understand the Serpent's eat because
[50:14] there was another tree the tree of good
[50:17] and evil and that was the tree in which
[50:19] they ate off and put took of and we are
[50:22] evidence that they did it because of our
[50:27] lives right because of our struggles
[50:30] let's move on
[50:32] so whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my
[50:35] blood have eternal life and I will raise
[50:37] him up at the last day whoso a brother
[50:40] didn't they eat manna in the wilderness
[50:42] but that was just a shadow in a tight
[50:45] because you realize they said the matter
[50:48] means what is it but we're not saying
[50:52] what is it because now we know what it
[50:55] was
[50:56] cuz Jesus says I am the head of what is
[51:01] it and we have a I am because of the
[51:04] manifestation of the real bread of life
[51:08] hallelujah Oh somebody help me here so
[51:12] when you and I realize a man that this
[51:15] whole feeling of power God when you
[51:20] realize that this whole entire Bible and
[51:23] the theme of this Bible the principles
[51:27] of all of this was to bring and manifest
[51:30] the coming of the Lord and the
[51:34] expression of the Jesus Christ in bride
[51:38] for Jesus didn't said unto them very
[51:43] well I said you except ye eat the flesh
[51:45] of the Son of Man and drink his blood ye
[51:47] have no life in you now what is the son
[51:51] of man it is the purpose of God God
[51:56] wanted to be a son in order for him to
[51:59] be a son he had to create him a body of
[52:03] a man and when he created
[52:06] the body of a man he did step into that
[52:10] man God Himself the Bible said the
[52:12] fullness of the Godhead bodily dwelt in
[52:14] him that was the difference between any
[52:17] ordinary man because every son of man at
[52:21] some point in time was full of God
[52:24] that's why they call him the son of man
[52:26] because he was a prophet not D prophet
[52:30] but a prophet and Jesus Christ comes
[52:33] along and he is the son of man which is
[52:36] the prophet of all prophets because son
[52:39] of man is another term you just what you
[52:41] say you would say is God in man form
[52:45] that makes him a son amen
[52:50] so whosoever eateth my flesh and
[52:52] drinketh my blood have eternal life and
[52:54] I will raise him up at the last day but
[52:56] my flesh is meat indeed my blood is
[52:58] drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and
[53:00] drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I
[53:03] in him as a living father have sent me
[53:06] and I live by the father so he that
[53:09] eateth me even he shall live by me now
[53:12] understand what I'm saying now Jesus
[53:15] Christ he's got up amorphic he from a
[53:19] tree to a man right and you know then he
[53:23] comes along he says I was that water was
[53:27] he the water he said it was so he was he
[53:30] said I was that rock was he that rock he
[53:33] was that rock cuz he said he was
[53:36] hallelujah now he says I'm the brain
[53:40] hallelujah and don't you know you
[53:43] couldn't know Jesus when he would get
[53:45] his disciples together and have a
[53:47] communion he was letting him know where
[53:50] they came from
[53:51] whoo hallelujah that's why he took one
[53:55] loaf of bread on eleven and you heard me
[53:59] say before he broke it in pieces and he
[54:01] gave each one eat it all up in other
[54:05] words don't waste any of this because
[54:07] it's life in it
[54:09] hallelujah and he but that was an innate
[54:12] reform that was in a ceremonial phone
[54:15] when we do that here that's why I love
[54:17] communion it's in a ceremonial phone
[54:20] but in reality you are protecting of God
[54:24] and God is for taking of you in that day
[54:27] you know that I'm in the father the
[54:29] father's in me and I am in you you are
[54:31] taking of him he's protecting of you and
[54:34] you having communion Oh somebody help me
[54:39] it is the greatest love affair ever just
[54:43] in a ceremonial part of communion
[54:47] because those fragments are now is that
[54:50] right the Bible said he's he's gathering
[54:53] everything isn't that Colossians he's
[54:56] going to gather everything in heaven and
[54:58] in earth
[54:59] that that which is he is part of him
[55:02] what is he doing he bringing everything
[55:04] back to one loaf one body that's why
[55:11] he's a man does not live by bread alone
[55:14] but by every word that proceeds out of
[55:18] the mouth of God why because the word
[55:20] becomes the Living bread and you must
[55:25] eat of the bread you can't be in the
[55:27] message if you don't even study it you
[55:29] must read it
[55:30] amen because it's been instructed by
[55:32] John eat the whole book you must study
[55:37] it you must eat it you must observe it
[55:39] like the commission was given to Joshua
[55:41] that Commission is given to us
[55:46] hallelujah whoo see they had the natural
[55:52] and we have the spiritual listen what
[55:56] brother William says in Redemption
[55:59] Redemption in completion completeness he
[56:03] says now that bread never did cease it
[56:06] went all the way through the journey for
[56:09] them that's right and was perfect type
[56:12] of Pentecost in us that was in the
[56:16] natural the bread never did cease it
[56:20] stayed the same bread until they entered
[56:23] the promised land is that right the
[56:28] church was inaugurated at
[56:29] at the day of pentecost and when the
[56:31] believer was up there and there came how
[56:34] to sound like a rushing mighty wind feel
[56:36] the house where they were setting the
[56:39] same Holy Ghost that fell then Falls now
[56:41] it will play it will go plumb on from
[56:45] that time to the end time it'll go right
[56:48] on through it's our bread the Holy Ghost
[56:54] is our bread they were fed with natural
[56:58] bread we are fair with spiritual bread
[57:01] is that right he said what do you mean
[57:04] remember brother Branham said the very
[57:07] same camel that Rebecca watered remember
[57:11] there's two things she watered she first
[57:13] water Ella easier therefore you must
[57:16] continue to keep the message alive and
[57:20] how do you keep the message of life by
[57:22] watering it anointing it proclaiming it
[57:27] you can't be the same of it you
[57:30] understand me because if you're saved
[57:32] you're refusing Ella ease of the water
[57:34] the second thing that she wanted was the
[57:38] camel itself and brother Mel said that
[57:41] camel is the Holy Ghost the very beast
[57:44] that took any easier - Rebecca is the
[57:47] same beasts that take Rebecca to Isaac
[57:50] so how do you order the Holy Ghost but
[57:54] praise my Thanksgiving by shouting you
[57:59] keep the Holy Ghost alive you cannot be
[58:04] ashamed but the Holy Ghost
[58:05] if God wants you to say hallelujah in
[58:08] the grocery store you gotta say it
[58:11] hallelujah if God wants you to shout on
[58:14] the speed you must shout hallelujah
[58:17] that's how you order it by allowing him
[58:20] to have his way hmm the church jesus
[58:29] said I am the bread of life that come
[58:31] from God out of heaven they said how
[58:34] father's eaten manna in the wilderness
[58:36] hallelujah for space of 40 years they
[58:41] said their one their every
[58:43] one day yes sir but he that eats my
[58:46] flesh and drinks my blood has
[58:48] everlasting life and I raised him up in
[58:52] the last day I am the bread of life that
[58:54] comes from God
[58:57] hello you must understand that everybody
[59:01] has not eaten up eating the same bread
[59:07] bread in itself in in term it could be
[59:11] cabbage meat is his food and God had the
[59:18] profit to store up food and the food was
[59:22] thrown up on tapes and books hallelujah
[59:28] because he knew there was a famine
[59:31] coming in the land see that's why the
[59:34] Bible said if you meditate on if you
[59:36] study it and do an observant you'll be
[59:40] like the widow woman that woman a man
[59:42] who only had a little bit of meal in all
[59:45] your left and he lied to came and said
[59:47] give me and make me a cake first
[59:51] I understand me she prospered because
[59:55] she kept her faith alive brother M said
[59:59] when she started the fire she got two
[1:00:01] sticks together and she formed that old
[1:00:04] rugged cross and she set some fire to it
[1:00:07] y'all hear me salvation is not watered
[1:00:10] down
[1:00:10] it must be fire in order to cook this
[1:00:15] word in order for this word to be
[1:00:18] digested it must have fire this
[1:00:25] messaging did it's a lie and I'm so glad
[1:00:30] by God's grace amen that we are the
[1:00:33] people that God has ordained to keep it
[1:00:36] alive hello
[1:00:39] is that right God ordained Eliezer to
[1:00:42] keep it alive when Israel was up on
[1:00:45] Mount Carmel when Israel had died almost
[1:00:48] most of them was worshipping Bale
[1:00:51] Eliezer came and said it's time for a
[1:00:53] showdown
[1:00:55] hallelujah my god is the same
[1:00:58] he's Hebrews 13:8 he's the same
[1:01:01] yesterday today and forever he's a God
[1:01:04] that changes not and he do not believe
[1:01:08] in the idolatry is that right oh that's
[1:01:12] on the Lord's side let him come over
[1:01:14] here he said let the God that is God let
[1:01:20] him answer by fire
[1:01:23] hallelujah they built seven altars is
[1:01:26] that right they built it up hallelujah
[1:01:29] and they started a man with faith and
[1:01:31] virtue and knowledge and went all the
[1:01:33] way up hallelujah but and then the Bible
[1:01:35] said he took the water now that's the
[1:01:39] strange thing let me tell you something
[1:01:41] we say he's water in a thirsty land and
[1:01:47] that's what my god he is he's water in a
[1:01:51] thirsty land you thirst for God study a
[1:01:54] word read your earth and I guarantee you
[1:01:58] he'll give you something to drink
[1:02:00] pour in all that water the question is
[1:02:03] they was in a family hadn't rained and
[1:02:06] where did that water come from up on the
[1:02:10] mountain where did it come from the same
[1:02:13] place that Ram came from that he was
[1:02:17] still Jehovah Jireh the same place the
[1:02:21] round came from with with with Abraham
[1:02:23] is the same place that water came from
[1:02:27] who somebody help me here so we realized
[1:02:31] by God gracious it but if you eat my
[1:02:33] flesh and drink my blood has everlasting
[1:02:37] night and I raise him up in the last day
[1:02:40] come on somebody now The Living bread is
[1:02:43] back the Son of Man the same one that
[1:02:47] told those Pharisees if you eat my flesh
[1:02:49] and drink my blood the same one came in
[1:02:52] the endtime hallelujah closed and rolled
[1:02:56] it meant in a in a prophecy garment
[1:03:00] hallelujah and he said except you eat my
[1:03:03] flesh and drink my blood you have no
[1:03:06] life
[1:03:06] in you but this time in what literal
[1:03:09] Braille it wasn't something made at home
[1:03:12] it wasn't something cooked in the
[1:03:14] man-made oven hallelujah but this bread
[1:03:17] came down from Helen he said I came from
[1:03:20] God and I go back to God hallelujah amen
[1:03:24] and so now we're eating up the real son
[1:03:28] of mayhem in world foam hallelujah but
[1:03:31] that same word is quickened by the Holy
[1:03:34] Ghost and when it's quickened by the
[1:03:36] Holy Ghost it brings light to your soul
[1:03:44] feasting this supposed to be a feast a
[1:03:49] real feast when you're in a feast
[1:03:53] the only time you might get sad is when
[1:03:57] you overheat hallelujah but when you own
[1:04:03] a feast and all that y'all know how
[1:04:06] y'all we do and some of us this deer
[1:04:10] goes to the all-you-can-eat hallelujah
[1:04:13] you see all that good food and you say
[1:04:16] to yourself I'm not going to get any of
[1:04:17] that chocolate cake but somehow the
[1:04:19] vibrations of that chocolate can't keep
[1:04:21] coming to you and eventually if you stay
[1:04:24] there long enough you find yourself at
[1:04:26] the counter I'm just gonna get me a just
[1:04:28] a little piece hallelujah but that is
[1:04:32] the way when it comes to how many y'all
[1:04:34] have ever read the word you studying you
[1:04:37] feel so good and all of a sudden you get
[1:04:40] tired and you don't want to go to sleep
[1:04:43] because it's really good
[1:04:44] and all of a sudden something allows you
[1:04:49] to read something else and it quickens
[1:04:53] you and all of a sudden you eating more
[1:04:55] than when you thought you're not ready
[1:04:57] to go to bed now you can't even go to
[1:04:59] sleep that's the way it is with God
[1:05:01] hallelujah oh my god you and I must
[1:05:06] understand when God sent the prophet of
[1:05:09] God he was making his last move toward
[1:05:13] the Gentiles and it may look like we're
[1:05:17] out of step or out of time but we are
[1:05:20] exact
[1:05:20] to where God wants us to be y'all hear
[1:05:24] me and I want to say this by the by
[1:05:26] God's grace we're looking at all of
[1:05:28] these things that are happening amen in
[1:05:30] the United States and all over it's all
[1:05:32] over the world people are totally insane
[1:05:34] did you know brother Branham said it
[1:05:36] would be he said the only people that
[1:05:38] will have their sanity is the bride of
[1:05:40] Jesus Christ and folks it is that way
[1:05:44] now don't say it's bad like it was
[1:05:47] inside of my we have passed that time
[1:05:51] it's the darkest before darling that's
[1:05:54] where we are we're right at the break
[1:05:57] that they break hallelujah now watch
[1:05:59] this because your glory or the glory
[1:06:03] that shall be revealed in you cannot be
[1:06:07] expressed until it's darkest before dawn
[1:06:12] it has to be a night time a time where
[1:06:16] the darkness seems to overshadow
[1:06:18] everything is that right it doesn't
[1:06:22] matter how black the sky years when no
[1:06:24] Stars gonna shine they gonna shine and
[1:06:26] so God shows their wickedness the most
[1:06:29] wicked is aged the darkest shade the
[1:06:32] darkest time ever he didn't even let the
[1:06:34] Prophet remain here is that right you
[1:06:39] say find that scripture Lee because when
[1:06:41] Rebecca saw Isaac he's a step top back
[1:06:47] he stepped off the scene y'all
[1:06:49] understand I'm saying Rob because now it
[1:06:51] was a relationship between Rebecca and
[1:06:54] Isaac and Rebecca the Bible said it was
[1:06:58] it was him immediately y'all knows the
[1:07:00] truth when we saw this message it was
[1:07:03] actually love at first sight we couldn't
[1:07:05] get enough of it we stayed up all night
[1:07:07] talking about it even we had to go to
[1:07:10] school and go to work yeah it was love
[1:07:12] at first sight
[1:07:14] hallelujah and the thing about it is you
[1:07:16] know what did we do we we we we went
[1:07:19] into Oz extent is that right and what
[1:07:23] Isaac stint was who's his mother's 10
[1:07:26] the old-time way the way that was a foul
[1:07:31] datian the solid way and that's why we
[1:07:35] do what we do but how come how come you
[1:07:39] do it he was ordained to do it
[1:07:42] he was predestinated to do it he was
[1:07:46] chosen by God elected by God to do it
[1:07:48] you can't help it is that right
[1:07:51] sometimes we don't you know we feel a
[1:07:54] little bit like Jeremiah I ain't gonna
[1:07:56] preach my MA I can't I'm tired I'm
[1:07:58] really stubborn make me stick people I
[1:08:00] can get you know I'm quitting some
[1:08:06] preachers know what I'm Tom I know you
[1:08:08] get so wearing is so tired you want to
[1:08:11] retire but there's no retirement in this
[1:08:17] you know that's the way Jeremiah felt
[1:08:20] he's like oh my god you tricked me you
[1:08:26] told me I was going to be turned down
[1:08:28] and crushing down and building up but
[1:08:30] you didn't tell about all the suffering
[1:08:33] you didn't tell me he was gonna beat me
[1:08:36] you didn't tell me he was gonna throw me
[1:08:37] in jail you didn't tell me to go do all
[1:08:39] this stuff to me it is what it is and
[1:08:47] God came through anyhow and I am so
[1:08:55] thankful for G when you and I realize
[1:09:06] that God is doing a great thing and we
[1:09:11] must understand that when we're feasting
[1:09:13] on the bread of the Lord we must
[1:09:17] understand is finished hello
[1:09:21] God didn't give them bread undone the
[1:09:25] bread was well cooked hello it didn't
[1:09:30] need anything added or anything taken
[1:09:34] from it it was already perfect y'all
[1:09:39] hear me the bread the word the message
[1:09:43] is perfect is all
[1:09:45] ready cooked the only thing we need to
[1:09:48] do is partake of it when you are in a
[1:09:51] feast let me say it like this if those
[1:09:55] who are chosen and elected by God will
[1:09:58] always understand that they are nothing
[1:10:05] god don't care about you he needs your
[1:10:09] house you should work yeah
[1:10:14] Paul says I count everything dung it's
[1:10:21] not I that live sheet that I had died
[1:10:27] I don't live anymore it's not hard that
[1:10:31] live but Christ that lives in me let me
[1:10:34] tell you something
[1:10:35] there is no way that Christ can live in
[1:10:38] you and nobody knows it you ought to
[1:10:43] know it if no one else knows it
[1:10:50] only brothers the other day with how I
[1:10:52] was preaching how they were slouching in
[1:10:54] the chair and all that first off I don't
[1:10:56] want know about a thing I pick I'm
[1:10:57] saying your body language tell god what
[1:11:00] you what you're saying what you're doing
[1:11:02] your body language will express your
[1:11:04] appreciation before God
[1:11:06] you can't slouch in church you gotta you
[1:11:09] gotta be governing when the boss says
[1:11:12] lift your hands and praise when you
[1:11:13] laugh I catch myself sometime and I lock
[1:11:16] my head when you lock your hands that's
[1:11:18] the enemy he's trying to keep you from
[1:11:20] your locking something up in you
[1:11:23] something is happening on the inside of
[1:11:26] you and your outward expression is
[1:11:29] you're expressing it that's what I'm
[1:11:31] saying don't do it because something's
[1:11:35] happening in you and I find that that's
[1:11:37] why I was praying for the sister and she
[1:11:39] had her hair like this I said no no no
[1:11:41] sister I said do this raise your hand
[1:11:44] because that's surrender there's a
[1:11:47] spirit now that's locking hear something
[1:11:49] that's telling you or doing something
[1:11:51] that's keeping something from being
[1:11:53] released unto the Lord so when you see
[1:11:56] yourself walking down
[1:11:57] you gotta unlock it's habit it's
[1:12:00] something we do but we don't realize
[1:12:02] that something is making us do that
[1:12:10] y'all remember just the other day when
[1:12:13] she went with us and how the spirit
[1:12:15] broken things started happening because
[1:12:17] we didn't realize what what we were
[1:12:19] doing God is really sensitive to that
[1:12:22] and I wouldn't have said nothing but I'm
[1:12:24] getting closer to God when finished at
[1:12:27] lettuce here listen phiston bread I want
[1:12:28] to say these things when finished and
[1:12:33] later see later see an age according to
[1:12:36] revelation 10 the mystery of all the
[1:12:39] Bible would be gone to what the bride is
[1:12:45] that right
[1:12:47] listen close now uh-huh bride called out
[1:12:52] by the word Christ Himself calling out
[1:12:55] the bride making plain 13 and 8 Hebrews
[1:13:00] 13 and 8 that he's the same yesterday
[1:13:04] today and forever does the same is the
[1:13:07] same he that believeth on me the works
[1:13:11] that I do shall he do also luke 1730
[1:13:16] also Malachi 4 Hebrews 4 and 12 all the
[1:13:20] scriptures that promise this is to be
[1:13:22] between the sixth and the seventh seal
[1:13:25] and the sixth and the seventh trumpet do
[1:13:29] we realize what we're saying brother
[1:13:31] Branham said there's only one truck well
[1:13:33] something left the only thing that's
[1:13:35] left there's one more thing left before
[1:13:38] the bride takes off because between that
[1:13:40] six and seven all the mysteries are
[1:13:43] revealed
[1:13:44] remember he comes to the seventh seal
[1:13:47] and the Bible tells us that at that time
[1:13:50] it was a space of a half-hour
[1:13:52] how did her so many people try to
[1:13:55] explain that and brother Branham comes
[1:13:58] right in the word and tells you that
[1:14:00] that half-hour is not only just given to
[1:14:03] the Jews but it is the going away of the
[1:14:05] bride so in that sense out of silence it
[1:14:10] is the catching a way of the bride
[1:14:12] because no man know the day nor the hour
[1:14:17] brother Adam said but when Jesus rose
[1:14:20] from the dead he received it why would
[1:14:23] he received it because he's the one
[1:14:25] that's coming back for us
[1:14:26] he knows the date right is that right
[1:14:30] the young man who was coming back for
[1:14:33] the bride on the ranch and then he went
[1:14:35] his father that came back for her it was
[1:14:37] he came back for her he knew the day he
[1:14:40] knew the time he knew the hour guess
[1:14:42] what and so did she
[1:14:45] hello she knew it she stood there the
[1:14:49] same day in the doorway waiting that's
[1:14:55] the mystery and without the Holy Ghost
[1:14:57] you will not see his coming that's why
[1:15:01] you've got to have the Holy Ghost it is
[1:15:04] the sense of that that de bras got when
[1:15:07] dangers around they know how to get away
[1:15:09] from the wall the Holy Ghost is your
[1:15:11] heavenly sense
[1:15:15] will tell you amen you and I will know
[1:15:19] is that right because the Bible said
[1:15:22] that he will not come to us as a thief
[1:15:25] in the night
[1:15:28] but without the Holy Ghost you're gonna
[1:15:31] be distracted so many things go come
[1:15:33] your way you and I must learn amen to
[1:15:36] get free all over again
[1:15:38] hallelujah it's okay
[1:15:41] listen he goes on he said the Pentagon
[1:15:43] Sophie's finishes at the period of the
[1:15:46] trumpet seventh trumpet for the next is
[1:15:49] the coming of the seventh seal for the
[1:15:51] next is the mystery of the coming of
[1:15:53] Christ also the trumpet is sound for the
[1:15:57] Jews and what people didn't know that
[1:16:00] experience Lee and people call it I want
[1:16:03] to use that name but people fail to see
[1:16:06] that when Jesus at the opening of the
[1:16:10] seals when when when when it's summer
[1:16:14] when it thundered and seven thunders
[1:16:16] uttered their voices they fail to see
[1:16:18] that was Christ look it up brother Brown
[1:16:22] said the seventh seal is Christ hmm
[1:16:27] hello and they failed to see that when
[1:16:31] with that thing that happened out there
[1:16:32] in in Arizona and New Mexico whoever it
[1:16:36] was and the angel came down and picked
[1:16:38] brother Branham up and this is the way
[1:16:40] it was a pre rapture you asked me
[1:16:43] because where and how did this man be
[1:16:46] caught him into a constellation swiped
[1:16:49] off the earth nobody knew where he went
[1:16:52] he was gone and he said he was caught up
[1:16:55] into a constellation of angels not in
[1:16:58] the natural because the natural man
[1:17:01] couldn't go there no flesh and blood
[1:17:04] shall enter into so just in a moment
[1:17:08] stop
[1:17:08] you said God came dude he could do it if
[1:17:11] God can raise up Lazarus and caused him
[1:17:13] to live and die again if God can take
[1:17:16] Enoch and translate him if God can take
[1:17:19] Elijah and transform him Transplant him
[1:17:23] on the Mount of Transfiguration
[1:17:29] God could do that too but the reality of
[1:17:36] it was so that hold that perfection of
[1:17:40] God
[1:17:41] the seals that's what that's why
[1:17:43] problems it'll give you route during
[1:17:45] faith it is here so you can see it's
[1:17:48] like Adam Santa eat you're balding my
[1:17:51] bone and flesh of my flesh
[1:17:53] you were protected by me somebody help
[1:17:59] me here oh Jesus
[1:18:01] darling vindicated y'all hear me Christ
[1:18:04] the world has been thoroughly vindicated
[1:18:08] brother Branham couldn't have been just
[1:18:10] anybody his ministry declared that he
[1:18:13] wasn't y'all hear me see the Holy Ghost
[1:18:17] come to vindicate your bride
[1:18:20] i'ma say it again the Holy Ghost comes
[1:18:23] to vindicate that you are bride if the
[1:18:27] Holy Ghost that you have is not
[1:18:29] vindicating your bride something's wrong
[1:18:31] you understand me the Holy Ghost and
[1:18:35] i'ma tell people just like a trying to
[1:18:38] tell the folks I'm not saying you're not
[1:18:40] saved I'm not saying you haven't come up
[1:18:42] to faith the virtue but did you know the
[1:18:45] Bible said if you like any of these you
[1:18:48] will for you will forget that you have
[1:18:51] been once purged from your sins so the
[1:18:54] back and forth and back and forth could
[1:18:56] be just one thing missing and the Bible
[1:19:00] says that you are brother said a man is
[1:19:02] as weak as his weakest link
[1:19:05] as strong as its weakest link whatever
[1:19:07] the link is where you weak you gotta
[1:19:09] fight you gotta fight oh I got a few
[1:19:15] things here ah I'm trying to hurry so I
[1:19:17] won't miss nothing listen coming from
[1:19:20] where what shall I do with Jesus called
[1:19:22] Christ he is thoroughly a vindicated he
[1:19:25] is thoroughly identified the word of
[1:19:29] this hour the promise of this hour now
[1:19:31] understand if brother Branham has been
[1:19:35] thoroughly vindicated there Mars and
[1:19:37] they have to be a Rebecca somewhere and
[1:19:42] repair
[1:19:42] was thoroughly vindicated you say how
[1:19:45] because when she met Isaac she was
[1:19:49] wearing the jewels that Isaac's it come
[1:19:54] on ma and listen whether you realize it
[1:19:58] or not these are jewels these virtues
[1:20:03] are jewels in his spiritual form and you
[1:20:11] and I must understand that when we when
[1:20:13] Isaac when we meet him at that finality
[1:20:16] and that 1/2 hour of silence that time
[1:20:20] oh my god remember I told you in the
[1:20:22] sixth seal brother branham actually
[1:20:24] equated or brought it out that the great
[1:20:26] earthquake I'm thinking is six a fifth
[1:20:28] but he brought out that when that great
[1:20:30] earthquake took place how Jesus was
[1:20:32] raised from the dead and the Saints rose
[1:20:34] up and he brought it back to the
[1:20:36] earthquake that we're getting ready to
[1:20:38] have in California and everybody's
[1:20:41] looking around like what I told people I
[1:20:43] said you ain't stirred up something's
[1:20:44] wrong with you
[1:20:45] Washington State can have an earthquake
[1:20:47] a few weeks ago and ain't nobody stirred
[1:20:49] up that's too close to home
[1:20:52] that's like moving one pedal before the
[1:20:55] final pedal pebble huh and to know that
[1:20:59] every conglomeration everything I just
[1:21:01] heard a man say don't you know the
[1:21:03] United States will no longer remain the
[1:21:07] United States as it is because somewhere
[1:21:11] in the scripture she disappears
[1:21:14] revelation 13 tells us brother Elm tells
[1:21:18] us when that earthquake happens the
[1:21:20] islands going somewhere just disappear
[1:21:23] the whole mess will change America will
[1:21:27] never be on the topic bottom just as
[1:21:30] much as Sodom and Gomorrah just as much
[1:21:32] as Canaan I mean all the other cities
[1:21:37] Capernaum is what I meant to say yeah
[1:21:39] all those cities just like they once
[1:21:43] were on top like Egypt once was on top
[1:21:45] but because of their sins where are they
[1:21:47] now you got to dig me so many meters
[1:21:50] down justifying a city and where he
[1:21:56] we are here this is lemon read on not
[1:22:02] the promise of Luther our that was it
[1:22:04] then that was a word in the former
[1:22:07] reformers age as you all who have heard
[1:22:11] the seven seals when the reformer age
[1:22:14] went out the beasts with the with the
[1:22:16] face like a man organization issued but
[1:22:20] this is the face of the eagle the beast
[1:22:22] that went to make the challenge today
[1:22:24] and who would dare to say that wasn't
[1:22:29] the inspired Word of God is that right
[1:22:32] you said what do you mean brother
[1:22:34] branham challenged him or they
[1:22:36] challenged brother branham they had that
[1:22:39] secret meeting god told him about it
[1:22:41] told him where everybody was going to be
[1:22:43] sitting is that right he preached they
[1:22:46] made it on the path back to 38 and
[1:22:49] everything else and he said to those men
[1:22:51] he said if you want to think however he
[1:22:54] said it you come stand by my right side
[1:22:57] a man why he knew that's where the angel
[1:23:01] was standing and they knew that's where
[1:23:03] the angel was standing he said nobody
[1:23:05] move and he says I thought so yeah then
[1:23:10] get off my back
[1:23:11] what was it it was the Eagle challenging
[1:23:15] the Beast of the system hallelujah and
[1:23:21] guess what
[1:23:23] he won ha it was ordained so God knew
[1:23:29] from the beginning of time
[1:23:30] that meeting was going to take place
[1:23:34] hallelujah and just like that when when
[1:23:37] our challenge come you don't have to
[1:23:40] fear the battle Elijah didn't feel all

[1:24:00] oh my you know people don't see brother
[1:24:04] banner being the messenger of this hour
[1:24:05] then unless you can do about that

[1:24:09] if you've done your best to share with
[1:24:11] people and they don't see it ain't
[1:24:13] nothing you can do about it

[1:24:19] you if you can read it you
[1:24:21] bless if you can hear it you're blessed
[1:24:24] think about it
[1:24:26] when God called Abraham I'm almost done
[1:24:28] when God called Abraham fifteen and one
[1:24:30] says and these things the word of the
[1:24:32] Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying
[1:24:34] fear not Abram I am that shield and that
[1:24:38] exceedingly great reward I love it
[1:24:43] why amen Bible said that Abraham looked
[1:24:47] for a city whose builder and maker is
[1:24:50] God he was the same way with brother
[1:24:52] Adam like brother brand my brother
[1:24:54] brother man was like him Lord I seen
[1:24:56] Billy Graham building I see all robbers
[1:24:58] building and Lord look at my little tent
[1:25:00] God said what it is to you
[1:25:02] I am your portion that's what he was
[1:25:07] telling Abraham Abraham I will make you
[1:25:10] a wealthy man but don't forget I am your
[1:25:13] portion hallelujah
[1:25:15] don't you see this oh my every time I
[1:25:18] think about that it does something to me
[1:25:21] hallelujah I may not have a fine car
[1:25:23] fire I may not own nothing but the Lord
[1:25:27] is my portion you understand he turn
[1:25:32] arises my portion being with him in that
[1:25:35] city is my portion hallelujah you know
[1:25:40] all that he has is my portion what is a
[1:25:45] mansion that means nothing but when I
[1:25:48] got God is my inheritance
[1:25:50] y'all know what I'm saying he is my
[1:25:53] inheritance all at all the omnipotent
[1:26:02] the creator of all things that the
[1:26:05] writer of this Bible the you name he is
[1:26:09] ooh
[1:26:12] think about it even when it came to
[1:26:15] Hagar and Ishmael remember Sarah running
[1:26:19] him out and they were in need let me
[1:26:21] tell you someone you in need God is your
[1:26:23] portion
[1:26:24] if you just seek the Lord the Lord will
[1:26:26] fight your battles ooh Oh mine and here
[1:26:33] was oh this is what I love about it when
[1:26:35] Hagar was crying out to the Lord God
[1:26:39] didn't say hey God I heard your cry
[1:26:41] y'all read it you know what he said
[1:26:44] I heard the cry of the baby I heard the
[1:26:47] cause I heard the crying child he never
[1:26:52] said I heard you hear I heard the crying
[1:26:58] child that was a child but he was
[1:27:03] thirsting for something and God said I'm
[1:27:05] gonna come down and bless him anyhow
[1:27:07] is that right people think that none of
[1:27:10] those Ishmael I sayin ain't gonna be
[1:27:12] saved yes they will because the Bible
[1:27:14] said every Kidron every tongue and every
[1:27:17] nation God had to work something through
[1:27:23] him thank God for that
[1:27:25] hallelujah Jesus because it mean reality
[1:27:30] spiritually we were the wild man

[1:27:40] and see the salvation of the Lord which
[1:27:42] he will show to you today for the
[1:27:45] Egyptian who you have seen today ye
[1:27:47] shall see them again no more hallelujah
[1:27:50] what did Moses do did he fight those
[1:27:54] Israelites did he fight those Egyptian
[1:27:56] hallelujah all he had to do is stretch
[1:27:58] out the rod all he had to do was to keep
[1:28:01] the word straight hallelujah and God
[1:28:04] fall for him hallelujah Lord of God
[1:28:09] there is no fear in love but perfect
[1:28:12] love casts out fear because fear hath
[1:28:15] torment he that feareth is not made
[1:28:18] perfect in love hallelujah you don't
[1:28:21] fear the battle huh David says all you
[1:28:26] uncircumcised philistine you go bring a
[1:28:29] challenge to the Almighty God davidon

[1:29:01] I'm hiding behind the shield of God is
[1:29:08] that right the boss said he'll hide me
[1:29:11] in the shelter of his wing
[1:29:14] [Applause]
[1:29:16] I'm almost done don't fear the battle
[1:29:20] hallelujah and why won't to ask
[1:29:22] something why did he just see these
[1:29:25] things because they was not elected
[1:29:29] why didn't he eat chips and see these
[1:29:31] things because they was not elected God
[1:29:35] told Abram ham before it happened
[1:29:38] get it you see you sleep in church God
[1:29:41] told Abraham before it happened did not
[1:29:45] God tell you God has already told us
[1:29:48] what's going to happen he told us the
[1:29:50] beginning and the ending and I already
[1:29:53] told you how can you come out as a loser
[1:29:56] when God didn't already showed you what
[1:29:58] the end of the book is and call upon :
[1:30:03] that's what possible y'all don't
[1:30:04] understand you're more than conquerors
[1:30:06] because Christ is already conquered for
[1:30:09] you you're more than conquerors don't
[1:30:11] fear the devil always work you Steven
[1:30:20] God told Abraham before what happened
[1:30:24] your seed will sir join in Egypt for 400
[1:30:28] years and I bring them out that's the
[1:30:30] reason they seen it because they were
[1:30:32] elected to see it there the election
[1:30:35] Israel was elected to see the sign of
[1:30:37] God and they went out of Egypt where the
[1:30:41] unbelievers punished were perished and
[1:30:43] today God is calling his elected the
[1:30:46] spiritual seed of Abraham by the faith
[1:30:49] that he had in the Word of God don't you
[1:30:53] see the spiritual seed today that don't
[1:30:55] see that that don't see the elected
[1:30:59] church intellectual church it sees the
[1:31:01] word
[1:31:01] and is being called from those big
[1:31:05] denominations into the presence of Jesus
[1:31:07] Christ
[1:31:07] was that clear did you get it alright
[1:31:11] we'll go further the elected only can I
[1:31:19] read one more God told him way down in
[1:31:23] Egypt I give you that land but he didn't
[1:31:27] say I go out there and sweep it all out
[1:31:29] and garnished the houses and hang up the
[1:31:32] curtains and everything you all just
[1:31:35] move in no no they had to fight for
[1:31:39] every inch of ground they took that's
[1:31:42] right
[1:31:42] fighting and take it by every fight
[1:31:47] every inch but he said every that's the
[1:31:50] problem
[1:31:50] everybody wants some yards he say inches
[1:31:53] little by little you come to the devil
[1:31:56] little by little everywhere the sole of
[1:31:59] your foot land that's Poe's possession
[1:32:02] footsteps in possession that's the same
[1:32:06] thing it is today divine healing me
[1:32:08] loans to us the Holy Spirit belong to us
[1:32:11] it's our property hello is our property
[1:32:16] but you'll fight every inch of it yes
[1:32:19] sir brother foot steps in possession
[1:32:22] just keep fighting take it the devil
[1:32:25] says the day of miracles has passed say
[1:32:27] you were lying
[1:32:28] God said he's the same yesterday today
[1:32:30] and forever take it over every
[1:32:33] your footsteps that's possession that's
[1:32:36] right
[1:32:37] oh I have so much more but I out of my
[1:32:41] upper cut but I will say one more thing
[1:32:43] in i'ma let you go and Nehemiah I love
[1:32:46] Nehemiah cuz they they they knew they
[1:32:49] were they were they were already
[1:32:51] predestinated you know Ezra Nehemiah and
[1:32:56] all of them Daniel
[1:32:59] they knew after 70 years was up they
[1:33:03] were going to be set free and then God
[1:33:06] anointed Cyrus Oh a man see that's what
[1:33:12] we don't we missing that you know but
[1:33:14] that's the truth
[1:33:15] how how they took a last Trump
[1:33:21] they took Trump and they put sours and
[1:33:25] Trump on the same coin because they're
[1:33:27] the Jews and not a spiritual they took
[1:33:30] they know that Trump when Trump
[1:33:33] announced that they were now a nation it
[1:33:37] was legally legally signed all right
[1:33:42] that Israel not only just a nation but
[1:33:45] they got land that's the same thing
[1:33:47] Cyrus did and when Cyrus did that he
[1:33:50] released those Jews to come back to
[1:33:54] rebuild Israel and the temple hallelujah
[1:33:59] and that's exactly what's happening now
[1:34:01] they making coins they're doing all the
[1:34:04] things and their purpose is to rebuild
[1:34:06] that temple now understand if they're in
[1:34:08] the process of doing that don't you know
[1:34:11] that that our our translation is right
[1:34:15] on the edge right on the edge and what
[1:34:19] people don't realize is that Trump must
[1:34:21] do what he's doing in all he's either
[1:34:24] disturbance he's disturbing everything
[1:34:29] but all of this disturbance is is to run
[1:34:32] the Jews back home and bring the bride
[1:34:36] together see they've been wrong with all
[1:34:40] because you know I think the United
[1:34:41] States we we still hold such majority of
[1:34:44] a large amount of Jews
[1:34:46] they need to go home and if God has to
[1:34:51] collapse the economy to get the Jews
[1:34:54] back at home that's what he's gonna do
[1:34:58] whatever he does it's gonna run them
[1:35:01] home and he's gonna run us home but our
[1:35:05] home is gonna be all our needs cry out
[1:35:08] to God hallelujah and at that time the
[1:35:13] third pole was coming to his full face
[1:35:17] then when we have a Mount Zion showdown
[1:35:21] because that's when the church will
[1:35:24] declare they are God they're the Queen
[1:35:27] of Heaven but here is that little group
[1:35:29] following the messenger of Elijah with a
[1:35:32] double portion of his spirit brother
[1:35:35] Wendell said I believe during that time
[1:35:37] he said limbs will be regrown I got the
[1:35:42] coke huh
[1:35:45] hallelujah not tomorrow is now and you
[1:35:49] lies about what we do now what are we
[1:35:51] doing what are we supposed to be doing
[1:35:53] we supposed to be preparing ourselves we
[1:35:59] didn't heard from the rancher son he
[1:36:01] done told us he gonna marry us and we
[1:36:04] need to be working toward our garment
[1:36:06] what is your garment yeah those virtues
[1:36:12] because that's what brother Don said the
[1:36:14] only thing you're not going to carry
[1:36:15] with us is character and that character
[1:36:17] won't be your own it will be the
[1:36:19] character of Jesus Christ and this is
[1:36:22] the expression of His divine nature
[1:36:26] hello
[1:36:27] you love the Lord Nehemiah and then it
[1:36:32] says you know what we gonna fight we
[1:36:33] gonna build us wall but I'm gonna have a
[1:36:36] weapon in my one hand and I'm gonna have
[1:36:38] an instrument of work in my other in
[1:36:41] other words I ain't afraid of the enemy
[1:36:43] and while he's preparing to come to
[1:36:45] fight me and tear me and stop me I'm
[1:36:47] gonna keep building this wall while the
[1:36:49] devil is trying to stop me from building
[1:36:51] I'm gonna keep on building but I'm gonna
[1:36:53] keep on fighting and I'm not afraid of
[1:36:55] the battle don't fear the battle the
[1:37:00] battle is
[1:37:00] not your said the Lord less than you
[1:37:12] know I meant no harm
[1:37:13] all I'm saying is people of God is
[1:37:15] getting so late and I think you know the
[1:37:19] more you pull from God you don't have to
[1:37:21] feel it the Bible says a sacrifice of
[1:37:25] praise God God loves sacrifices of
[1:37:27] praise and so you know that what you
[1:37:30] need to do because I'm gonna tell you
[1:37:32] something if we set still we get sleepy
[1:37:35] we'll get you know the devil of fairness
[1:37:37] and but when we get and they start
[1:37:39] praising God the blood thought it
[1:37:41] flowing and God stars anointing and then
[1:37:44] you'll see God come in in a mighty way
[1:37:46] he's not pleased with lukewarmness he's
[1:37:48] not he's not pleased with us being cold
[1:37:50] he won't fire in this place and in order
[1:37:54] for father come you got to bring your
[1:37:55] own link
[1:37:56] don't wait on nobody else bring your
[1:37:58] only I'd rather see one person then you
[1:38:02] know then nobody's hardly saying nothing
[1:38:04] and I know God wants the fruits of your
[1:38:06] lips praising while you can because one
[1:38:09] of these old days you know this lips
[1:38:11] gonna be sealed
[1:38:13] you can't praise him in the grade you
[1:38:18] gotta praise him now we don't know the
[1:38:21] next time we're gonna be afflicted or
[1:38:22] whatever and can't get up a king saying
[1:38:24] that and all we can do is moan mmm I was
