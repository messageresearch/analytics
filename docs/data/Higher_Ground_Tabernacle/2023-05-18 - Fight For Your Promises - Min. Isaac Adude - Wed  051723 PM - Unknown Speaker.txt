burdens down something has changed my life you know yeah man we greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen we're so happy to be here this evening [Music] um let's turn to Joshua chapter 14 and verse 12. Joshua 14 verse 12. and Joshua chapter 14 verse 12 the Bible says now therefore give me this now now therefore give me this mountain where if the Lord spake in Us in that day for doubt I heard this in the in that day how the uh anakims were there and that the cities were great and fenced if so if so be the Lord will be with me then I shall I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said Joshua chapter 14 verse 12. said this is [Music] Amen in verse 13. the Bible says that and Joshua blessed him and give give unto uh Caleb the son of uh Jeff and him for inheritance as well go to God and pray first so only here father God we're so grateful to be in your presence this afternoon Lord we just want to give you thanks Lord Mercy Lord we want we Just Want To Praise Your Name Lord for everything that you have done for us Lord we thank you Father God that you continue to be with us Lord and you touch our hearts and you give us the faith father God to believe in your promises Lord help me to be so sensible to the Holy Spirit Lord so that I can say everything that you want me to say Lord we thank you we love you Lord we appreciate you Lord in Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated as well anyway this afternoon we have a little small subject that we wanted to share the harm they meant that we're entitled uh fight for your promises amen because when the promises a promise has been given to you I mean it doesn't mean that it's something that's easy sometimes you have to fight for it the fourth of the way amen that's why here we read in Joshua chapter 14 verse 12. even here is this happened 45 years after Moses gave to give a promise to Caleb is it happened 45 years after Caleb went to spy to kalash and Barney Alex when they went to spot the city is so right now here Caleb comes Moses is already dead now Caleb comes to Joshua and saying you see more easy job they said he said now therefore give me this mountain amen we all know what the mountain means in the Bible it means that you know uh challenges and obstacles and things like that I'm a mountain amen doesn't mean something that's easy but that's why Jesus said that if you have faith you can move the mountains that mountain was not a physical Mountain it was things that happens to Allah in our lives that mountain can be sickness the amounting can be a problem with the financial problems [Music] amen that mountain can be anything that are you going through right now it's a problem so now here we see that Caleb is coming to Joshua and saying Joshua give me this mountain they said that for it because you heard when Moses was talking about this you gave me this mountain so now the mountain that Caleb was asking for amen if you go back to uh on Numbers Chapter 13. amen that same place is the place where uh the 10 spies so uh the children of anak and then they were scared they were frightened because they were like uh uh butterflies [Music] let's go to number 13 verse 27. amen here the Bible says that and they told him and said we came onto the land whether thou send us amen with the people the people who are living in that land were not the people that would that were blessed by God in other words they were idolaters but with them being adulterers this land always already had the fruit and milk and honey was flowing in that land so now what will happen if that land is now occupied by people who fears the Lord [Music] so now we continue in verse 28 the Bible continues and says nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are warmed and every great uh and very great and moreover we saw the children of of anak there is what we call the Giants amen because their father was arba basketball amen and the chain of anarch was Giants were those big men's like Goliath this is jump in chapter verse 30 of the same chapter in the Bible says that and Caleb Still the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it is [Music] amen because he knew that they had the promise of the Lord they knew that the angel of the Lord was always walking with them he had the experience how God delivered them up you know when they were facing dangers and obstacles I believe that that same God will be the same God who will deliver them against those giants so that's why with all his faith he could say that let us go and possess it isn't something that was that would be easy for them to do but he knew that they had to fight for it he knew that they had to stand and fight for every inch of those of that land is nevertheless he was willing to go fight amen because he had the promise of the lord and there we saw the Giants the sons of anik which come of the Giants and we were in our own side as Grasshoppers and so we were in their side is Giants amen he knew what he was asking foreign the Wilderness and Lebanon from the river the river of Euphrates even onto the other most see a shall your Coast be just told them in verse 25 that there shall be no men able to stand before you Universe for the Lord your God shall lay the fear and you and the dread of you upon all the land that you shall tread upon and Caleb remembered that promise Caleb remember that blessing amen he knew that as long as he's as long as he's in his on his line of duty God will always be there to back him up mother who who he was gonna fight amen he knew that he will overcome so that's why he went to Joshua give me this land don't want Supreme amen he knew that it wasn't a peaceful land he knew that he had to fight for it is foreign he said that God's given every sick person in here Divine Healing every one of you Jesus was wounded for our transgressions with his tribes we were here but you have to fight for every inch of or every inch you possessed everywhere The Souls of your feet travel God told Joshua I have given you ideas uh Footprints means possession let's move in tonight amen I found someone to know amen let's go in I don't see Footprints is possession let's take every inch of of of ground that God give us pronoun positions if you haven't gotten the baptism of the Holy ghosts amen Peter said that the promise is unto you and to your children to them that's far off don't look at the circumstances don't look how hard it is you have been you have been made more than conquerors that come unto me you are thirsty and hungry [Music] man you are thirsty and tired let's go possess it yeah it belongs to us and he said at the cross that everything is fulfilled [Music] amen let's go possess it I don't see positions I have to fight for every inch of of the promises Bible is full of promises amen but he needs the faith amen we must have the faith to go claim it say that this belongs to me amen this is mine this is my Mountain this is my promise this is my land is because it belongs to me amen you know that it's easy to believe of when everything is going perfectly fine it's easy to believe when you see the power of God moving and and people speaking in tongue and things like that uh it's easy to believe when everything is going perfectly fine but where is your faith when things are not going as you as you as you thought it was your faith when you're up on the mountains where is your faith when you have to face difficult times where is your faith when your wife has been sick for 15 years where is your faith when you've been looking for a child for 25 years it's easy to say that I believe the Lord it doesn't matter even if it's how and I have to fight foreign [Applause] then we'll say one word to pharaoh and Pharaoh will start trembling um but they were surprised to see that their their deliverer is that same baby that was raised in Pharaoh's house a man was that same baby that was raised in Pharaoh's house it's the same thing that when you say that uh when they talk about Jesus the promise of Jesus will come amen all them Pharisees they thought that you know a highway will be made in the deserts Jesus coming down with you know uh bodyguards as angels and and we'll say one word and everything will be finished he he raises amen but God God does his own God does things in his own way amen God doesn't have to ask us for permission amen he doesn't even have to ask you for ideas amen God God just does his things do you think he shows you amen and then it's up to us now to believe him amen we have to see or trust him even though you ask the Lord you pray let's say somebody's sick in your family you pray for that person amen you see that you believe that tomorrow I will see my brother walking tomorrow we'll see him jumping up and down there amen but here comes tomorrow and your brother is still sleeping there on the bed and still crying because he's uh uh the pain is still there himself gave him the promise do you remember Abraham had to wait for another 25 years to see that promise to come to pass Amen in the Bible tells us that not even one time amen Abraham doubted amen Abraham kept his faith amen Abraham kept his he kept kept his face until Isaac came amen sir the man it was easy for the 10 spies to talk about how beautiful the land was it's defensively this is all of them had something to say Amen all of them saw how beautiful that land was remember when it came to the real problems they all say that it's impossible Moses we can't do this we're not strong enough to do it they forgot one thing is that it wasn't about their strength amen their strength didn't even matter amen God didn't even require this ranks because look if God required the strength [Music] God was going to use Moses when he was 40 years old and he was wrong his ability to speak wasn't what God was required amen because God doesn't care if you're fluent or not amen God he looks for a heart that will that will be submissive to his will soon amen God who is looking for a heart someone that's like Samuel say Here I Am Lord speak and your servant will he rehearsity foreign but when Moses was strong because people would have said that well because my Pharaoh was afraid of Moses because Moses was wrong but God had God wanted to show off amen God wanted to show off his powers amen that his attribute of the Redemption by power if women tell us that he cares about us amen that's what he Deliver us that's why he always fights the prophet continues and said that Joshua fought every inch of ground of paragraph 23. amen Joshua fought for every inch of ground from one end to into the country of the other one but he had a promise amen Joshua had a promise that the land was given to them amen God gave his promise to his Prophet as a prophet to Abraham Abraham that he's given him he's given him the land but why did they have to fight for it amen but they had the promise said that God said I've given it to you the prophet did you continue did you have a disease amen whether there's Giants whether there is a and whatever the world will say when things are not going right amen amen you just they couldn't even complain they couldn't have a murmur not even one time you don't remember Supreme development because the Lord has been great to them Rock for 344 for the water to drink what to drink foreign God ever failed them but when they had to face challenges amen they lost their faith is started to speak against Moses wanted to go back and eat the garlic bread they wanted to go back and go straight remember you said well brother Isaac yeah but now we don't have all these things so at least we have the right to complain when one is not going right no I mean we have better things that they did have [Music] um amen God gave the gift of healing to every believer amen he gave the gift of healing to every believer amen Mark 16 these are the sons that shall follow them that will believe in Christ Marco says they shall lay their hands on the sick and they will be here it's a promise to every believer the information amen we don't have to go to a certain place to look at one thing to be here but in everywhere you are wherever you are amen whenever whatever position that you find yourself even you can just you don't even have to speak it you can't just think about it amen and you will God will answer to your prayer whatsoever you shall ask and think amen we don't even have to say it Moses had to speak to the Rock but now we don't even have to speak it we just have to think about it God who knows everything says that before you even open your mouth amen with the word of God you can share different experiences having fellowship with God I think at 28 I can't remember foreign just keep pressing on continuous and promise God will make her way through it that's one of the greatest experiences of my life's experience is to see God see what Drew when I can't get over it get under it get around it or anyway God opens up a way and I go through it the prophet say that I can't get under it amen I can't get I can't get over it amen there is not even a way to go around it but God will open up a way through it somehow or another his grace is sufficient to carry us through it that's what the children of Israel failed to realize foreign but God was there Amen to made a way through it through it amen they failed to believe that God could you amen is the same yesterday today and forever remember what he did for them that day he was the same God it is the same God today what he did for them that day is the same God do it for us today amen when you're facing problems you can't go around it don't lose your face don't lose the faith women keep the faith foreign [Music] well amen it doesn't matter how hard the situation can get Grandpa Community even I don't know what you're going through this uh tonight yeah man I don't know I don't even know but half of your problems amen you know yourself between you and God Amen you don't even have to tell me anything about the promise me amen is still applies to everything amen because he said that whatsoever you asked amen Jesus didn't name things that we were supposed to ask Jesus didn't give us a list of things that were supposed to ask in Japan but he said that whatsoever amen you were asked in my name amen believe that you have it that you receive it amen and you shall see it amen whatsoever do amen whatsoever you will ask just replace X by his value amen put your name there amen replace your problems amen ask it in Jesus name Jesus Jesus praying for you amen and you will see it you will see her to come to pass amen believe it Caleb had to steal the people Amen to make them remember they remind them that God is able to do that and tonight even when I don't see him foreign the Christian always looks at the Unseen things every Redemptive blessings of God is unseen amen hears the whole armor of the Christians love joy Faith long suffering gentleness patience amen all of that it's unseen the false the force it's all unseen forces that works in the heart of a believer foreign [Music] less to a human side significance amen but know that it's God am I look at Elijah the rain will not come unless I say the word yes amen after after uh uh after Mount Carmel when the fire came to consume the the sacrifice cause the rain is coming amen Ahab could look and enlarge and say but the sky is clear there is no clouds so where will the rain come from Elijah knew what he was talking about he told his servant to go look at the cloud it goes if they receive any clouds in the sky is that Monday is servant came back and said Elijah there is nothing nothing at all the sky is clear there is to tell them go back seven times and go look so a little Cloud even they saw a cloud like unto a man's hands amen and they came with the good news to tell Elijah is Amen to them it looks like it was so little that nothing can really get everything ready because the rain is coming I see a cloud like a man's hands sometimes in our lives amen sometimes in our lives amen we might see things that are so little amen there sometimes when you tell it to people you go through you're an experience that you know that seems so little to the people and when you tell it to people and they don't understand why are you rejoicing because of this little you just have the faith foreign foreign foreign Hebrews chapter 2 verse 1 to 4. the Bible says that therefore we ought to give the more the more Earnest here to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them sleep for if the word spoken by angels will steadfast and every transgression and Disobedience received a just recompense recompense of rewards how shall we escape if we neglect to create salvation up if we neglect so great salvation which at the first begin to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that hurt him uh no that's that's the wrong sorry that's the wrong verse Hebrews chapter Hebrews chapters four chapter four verses he receptive for verse one or three that will yeah that one was gonna lead me somewhere else you don't want to stay here all night so amen Hebrews chapter 4 verse one to three yeah the Bible says that let us there for fear less a promise being left us of entering into his rest in your view shall seem to come short of it now verse 2 for unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it is which have believed do enter into rest as he said as I have sworn uh uh in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the words were finished from the foundation of the world I mean I'll read again verse Two For unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word Christ did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them it's the same word same promises that anybody can read but the results depends on the faith that you put in that problem amen you see Paul here saying that that the gospel was preached to everybody he's talking about two groups people who didn't have faith and people who had Faith amen the same gospel that's been preached to us amen it's the same gospel that was preached to them but they came short of it is because they didn't put they didn't mix Faith with the words the Faith with the word amen because the promises are already there amen we have the word amen to see the results we have to we have to mix it with faith women in closing we read uh uh Joshua 15 verse in closing we read Joshua chapter 15. verse 13. amen we're still now the results of the faith of Caleb amen what he had to go what he had to uh earn um in chapter 15 this is when the land was divided to uh the portion of Judah the land was divided to everyone Amen in verse 14 was when Caleb came to Joshua saying that Joshua give me the mountains knew what he was asking for he knew that he had to fight is he had to fight to bring peace to that lands verse 13 the Bible says that an unto Caleb the son of uh jaffeine he gave a part among the children of according to the Commandment of the Lord to Joshua even the city of Arbor the father of Anna which city is Hebron foreign amen he had to draft them off to bring peace because if you read in uh Chapter 14 verse 15. [Music] amen the last the last the last word of that chapter chapter 14. you don't see that the Bible said that and the land had rest from Ware because Caleb and then he had to fight for his promise he had to fight for what belonged to him to receive the peace to have the peace Amen to rest from the war is amen so we have so many promises in the Bible foreign [Music] come let's sing your wings to The Winds of Faith Museum amen you'll see that watch your Mountain what is your mouth I mean it doesn't matter how big it is just speak the word amen and you will see and then you will you you you will see it be moved your wings to The Winds of faith I mean if we can have the lyrics thank you [Music] [Music] do not struggle cause it's my grace [Music] there are two roads [Music] [Music] take the word of God or what you see what you believe is [Music] set your way s to The Winds of zombies [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] it will move [Music] in a higher please is by grace [Music] forget [Music] what you need watch your eyes [Music] where you will fly oh set your wings [Music] cause it's by grace [Music] please the winds away now watch the Eagles [Music] [Music] [Music] through the sky [Laughter] cold oh I've said joy we always to The Winds of Faith say I Can Fly please I do not struggle it's my prayers to The Winds of faith set my reading I've seen them yes Lord yes Jesus father God will come before you father Lord after hearing your word Lord Jesus Lord you telling us what we have to do [Music] it's just to set our wings it's Sneaky they don't know if the person only wanted to be sure that we will fly to the higher Place Lord we come before you father God with needs Lord we come before you Lord with questions [Music] Lord we believe oh Father God that you will hear our prayers Lord we believe father God that you hear our prayers because you say ask and it shall be given to you [Music] Lord these are your words and Lord here we are doing the exact same thing Lord we're knocking foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Lord after hearing the word of the Lord in the temple [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] what would be the comfort of God in your name I mean God bless you [Music] let's just sing this one little song Amen and will be dismissed amen foreign of God every truth changing me changing you amen we're Changed by his word amen just like the Earth when he said let there be Earth was changed amen is by his word amen word of God true true changing me is changing you oh we have come with open heart oh let the word of God oh word of God ever truth is changing me changing you you oh we have come with open heart oh let the word God words of life oh words and gave us strength and help us grow oh in this world where we roll the word of God will guide away this world they reach out with God's Own Heart oh let the word of God [Music] [Music] holy word [Music] words of Pride o word of God Amen ities [Music] whatever true changing me changing you oh we have come Open Hearts oh let the word of God Amen [Applause] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Laughter] [Music] foreign
