TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Revelation 5 and we start in the first revelation Revelation 5 uh reation 5 uh verse [Music] one then I saw in the right hand of the one who was SE Seated on the throne a scroll written on the front and back and sealed with seven and I saw a powerful angel proclaiming in a loud voice who is worth who Worth to open the scoll and to break its seals verse five [Music] verse verse five then one of the elders said to him to me stop weeping look the lion of the tribes of Judah the root of David has conquered thus he can open the scoll and e seven SE [Music] then I saw standing in the middle of the throne and of the fourth living creature and in the middle of the elders a lamb that appeared to have been killed he had seven horns and seven highes which are the seven Spirit of the God sent out into all the Earth verse 8 and 10 and verse eight verse eight and when he had taken the scroll the f creature and the 24th Elders threw themselves to the ground before the lamb each of them had a harp and Cen B full of inin which are the prayers of the Saints they were singing a new song you are with or you are with to take the scroll and to open it SE because you are killed and at the cost of your own blood you have purchased for God person from every tribes language people and Nations you have appointed them as a king and Priests to save our God and they will reain on the earth God bless his word you may be seated we are talking about uh about Adam uh who's receiving the uh book that is the title of the hor who uh that is the ti of the horor of the of Earth and the uh etal life eternal life that's what Adam lost when he fall in the when we talk about about we are not talking about the book with papers like this but we are talking about Authority the power and authority that was given which was in the hand that Authority which was called the title which cannot be contested that's what we are reading here John saw a book in the hand of the book was which was sealed with which was sealed with that book is nothing else but it's that title that him had lost that that that that book The Lamb got it from heaven and he descend with it and give it to the prophet that is the the the coming back and the Jubilee the return and that is there is the restoration and the Redemption that is is talking it's always in accordance with those book whatam had lost it was nothing but the the book sealed with seven that's what that's what gave him the the the right to have the eternal life and the right to have authority if you look at clearly in this message God has opened the Seven Seals and we believe that whatam had lost it has been returned back to the bride now that is being called by Prophet that it's a title which canot be conted even the devil cannot contest us because we are we are the H of that title in the books [Music] of now we see he was there our remp he has the title of redemption he has it in his hand and remember time that book was in his hand now now now this time is in the hand now look clear title of the hor all all the way and all the all the creation all the creation it is found in the hand of the Lamb came and got the book got that book for theace of human that book went back to God when Jesus died on the and he again L not got that book to he got that book to give it to the to the human he said the L came and CLA that book and he got that book for the not claim that book for for the angel claimed that book for the humankind and he was it was the book was when the L that book now when we are talking as we are talking the book is the prophet of I believe sometimes the people are churches churches they hear this thing sound something strange yes that's why we are different from them we have gu something very different yes this message is not the message that is being preached and telling people book that imortal that book and he was supposed to be and given and you have this possession which Angel Gabriel did not have they don't have that title am now a humankind is given this book it means he has he is above the angel when I'm talking like this I'm trying to to enter into your into your Consciousness make you understand what's what's going on let's go slowly the first man to is not a man do you know that the first the first the first being to sin was not a man it was a Satan Lucifer when the Bible say he was chased from heaven now we've never seen God wasting his time to go and look for Lucifer no now when Lucifer put sin on this [Music] and and they were down now when God came it means in heaven there was nothing he moved from Heaven why you guys Angels who say that I'm unfair he said when our brother Angel was sat when he sin you did not do anything but why when Adam Sinn you live this you live the and you go behind him to look upon him what's going on God are you unfair you don't understand I have a secret was not God but was God on don't believe there's a part of in h no I don't believe we saw in the morning that the part there's a part of God which was placed into if you are a chosen one and you got lost it means God God got lost above above theel kind am I talking about why in this God does not sit and relax in heaven and He sent Jesus he sent was it wasn't [Music] enough everything that lost and came amen that's what am that's why the Bible say you are God why you you are dying like human being listen the lamb got that book he got it that book not for for for Angel not for God but he got that book for you now when he got that book one bridge between seven seven Church agents and seven SE something different must happen amen when the seven seven seven Ages come to the end God open a bridge and in that bridge what happened he took the book itent and give that human being amen and we start another dispensation yes amen that is only for the Bride of the last days and already reach that something is fixed to happen yes am we are not like that kind of belever Jesus we are believers up Heaven has descend down for you he wants he wants to do something for you look at John John did not saw that that lamb now where was that where was that lamb when the voice says that lamb was far in the eternity and the lamb came from eternity and toward the human and when he coming closer I I I was I was trying to show you what what was happening in eternity the first things that was shown it was the the the Lamb of God who was killed who was slain before the first thing that happened in the history of redemption is the the the lamb was l world he came and is the book of Seven Seals it's the book that her had lost for the Redemption move from eternity and cut that open it and he send is something fure am what I'm reading here is history it has happened already why because it want that book to be raled to it has to be revealed to the meet the the Church of brother Bram they shout and he there were some people what that's what that's what giving the manifestation the difference the difference between what is anointing us anointing they had people in the other churches is that Dimension that Adam had L very different with what is happening in other church this is something the creation of this world Amen you've got the value which is hiden maybe you you not see that let's move [Music] forward in the message who's God it says look the communion that Adam lost when he fall restor that to us when he died take a man back to the communion with God the fellowship God now the the church is being risen the church is moved up moved up at that fellowship with God and it is a communion amen like Adam who had it at the beginning after the of Jesus what happen when the get it back in the position in which Adam before to return the church back to the position where Adam was at the beginning what what beginning I'm talking about the original beginning the beginning there was a word the Word was God and that's the beginning I'm talking about that's the beginning where the bride is going back let me ask you one question where where where was the Garden of Heaven who knows who knows that who knows where the garden of headen butam says that that Garden is the headen is in [Music] Egypt now where is the Garden of headen now we going to see that the garden that we are talking about here is not something natural it's something Supernatural you cannot see that's why I was talking in the morning that it's it's a space from eternity which came toward a humankind and when a man sined he lost that now you see what comes to us is something from eternity now brothering back the bride to that position that's where us Believers of this message we are now we are we are inheriting something now if you return to that position you have to iner something that's why we are talking about the bright because we are returning to that position and he continue and say he said the prophet said I know I don't want to take much of your I'm just I'm just reading some quotation of brother Bram and we going to pray thought that I want to goward with this afternoon is the title which is uncontested and he said this he said now look at the the beginning of the Garden of Eden where Adam came out because of his sin and it was [Music] snation the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit must purify everything that was which was thrown on us now we are free to operate or to exercise in the step coming forward now we are free to exercise the next step in God when the Holy Spirit Des sent and in in you he must clean everything you are free to exercise the next step in God what that next step Hallelujah the only spirit is not given so that exercise a step in God we are free you are free to exercise the next step in God yes amen and if we are there if we Stood Beside if you remain in the in in the at the side of those that are dying just to have the the idea that you are being saved we should start Shou that we are Victor now we if we find ourself in a position there's a a dead person here and you standing there instead of you start crying it's time for you to start shouting hallelujah hallelujah because you know you are in the position that can rise that person that Dimension is the dimension that can do and we are able to exercise that that that's where this book is taking us exercise the step any difficulties or situation any battles before the demons because you remain Victorious and you're going to shout victory even when they they telling you that some people are coming to fight you because you're going to remain a Victorious person because you have to exercise a step in God we have to exercise One Step In God now amen and by the B said you were able to do that yes amen that's why the holy spirit is given Hallelujah that's why the book is in reement we must exercise now another step in God Amen and we must cry Victory any c that's why we are here to Pro amen am that's the book which is given to us that's the position we need that's what I want you to look at that's the time that's step where we should be where are you where are you oh God your God has anointed you if you see the steps that are coming we must be sure that we we are we are we we are correct before God before getting out of do not listen to what other people are saying you have to be sure yourself that you've reached that position you have to know that you are in in accordance before we move get out of here we should be sure that the Divinity is with us God says there there's only little time the world will not see me again but you you see me because I'll be with you and even in you until the end of the world that time has come now each one must realize that is with us us that is another step with God that's the reason why the book was given what lost Has Come Back To Human now they have to enter into another dimension Dimension where is that God they oh that God is in us and is Among Us now we are going to see what is going to happen amen that's where we are until the end of the world we are going to see that reality now you see look closely Christ is in his church Christ is that anointing is in the church until the end of the world until the end of the world now now you're going to see he's in his church and we going to see that how he's going to work in his church that is the church that I Bram wants to see what kind of church brother Bram Sing Sing trying to exercise trying to work kind of church I want to see and that's the church I want to be in amen it now the believer today most people say I'm a good man I'm paying T I'm doing this I'm good member that's fine but that's a moral life amen moral life you are a member of this church you pay your that's not the problem that I'm preaching here I'm preaching about the people who are in Christ being a good member moral life that's not about the book A lot of people who are good they do that you you you go to to to Rome you're going to see the priest they walking like that they don't steal they don't smoke that's not that's not what makes difference the difference is a man pra Our God who in heaven not our God in here you worship the God in your heart if that thing happen the healing of sick this will be something easy we must exercise step in God yes sir and we start caring Victory amen God in us waking and showing some sign being a good good member it's moral life and that is not our message speaking in Tong is not our message possess and lost and if you have that you not a man like other you are one of the eternity and on Earth nobody can touch you today the church is going back to what that's where that's kind of church where I want to be even if you are a good member that's okay but it's a moral life now I don't have anything bad that I can talk about but it's not what I want to it's not what I'm preaching you Jesus he judge a person if he's a Christian for Jesus to say you are a believer he look at the character that you have what kind of character he talks he talks about his life his own life in you that's what he wants to see not not moral life for you to be a believer for Jesus is looking at his character in you it doesn't look at the and Christ wants to see that book in you look at the last word of Jesus he say go preach the good news to all those that believe they will be baptized and they will be saved those who not believe will be condemned now look at every church now we are going to see that the churches are even far from the reality and they they are far behind from the thing it is the sign that has to follow the Believers the people goes to church and they are baptized the people goes to to the church and they now when we talk about the sign that has to follow those that believe we don't see we don't see now it it has to be that that sign for it to be to be seen it means the honors of the sign has to be to be seen and pick some the disciples among the people with great joy and they preach the word everywhere now we going to see the Bible say the Lord accompan them with the the sign and the Miracles wonders and you have to believe it has to happen like that until the that's what being baptized in Jesus believe in Jesus for for you to for you to be we have a lot now having that book and show the sign that we don't have we don't see that amen oh Lord we have to go another step in [Music] God the message is the pillars of Fire show us the p and that is enough in that message he said this when God made everything and he saw that everything was good now he said let's make a man in our image and that man is a being on on earth now look before he was Loos the logos came out of him and he became a on Earth and that what what happened the beginning and he said let's make make a man in our image and that man was made in His image and he was was Supernatural if you want to see that read Genesis and there was another man who can cultivate the soil can the soil God cre that man with the the dust of the head in Genesis 28 he create a man a supernatural but made a man that man from the dust of from the dust of Soo he was he was his appearance was like monkey was like any animal was like a world beast that's what people are telling you in this world now what God has God has put five senses in that body and he he got that that being the supernatural being and that supernatural being which was it was the third person of of trity who was the S who was the only spirit inside a human that body which had exactly right that supernatural being that God created he got that Supernatural and put into a body with five senses that is God got that ton and put inside the inside the body which has that's what happened in now when that man now we see God we see God is coming and looking for Adam Adam Adam where are [Music] you deliver to the now look when you are born you are being born again when you're born again you don't need to have a card of [Music] prayer you don't need to to to have a door closed because you are out of that what you need to do in first first place is to enter into Jesus and that's what I want to do today I want to see that that nation that the world what God wants he doesn't want to see us go going to church every day what God wants to see us do it is a Revival they hold Revival which was sent from heaven and it comes from God that's what God wants to see us now now I believe even Ken Ken was religious being religious is something that you can cover up Adam and Eve they were in Garden of Eden trying to cover cover cover up themselves what God wants to see want want to see from us is not religious he wants to see us with the Revival he wants to see the Revival in the it is the only spirit that God had put in him gave him the authority that was the Revival it is the Revival the anent rival God doesn't want us to be religious God want us today he he doesn't want us to hide from him that must must be the nature of human today he want us to confess everything not say oh because I'm a members of this church and it's about 10 years now now you are a member of this this church for about 10 years what do you know about God do not hide behind the the name of a church do not hide and say I'm a Methodist I'm a Baptist I'm a presbyterian I'm a p not that this is not the time for you to hide behind do now you know that in your heart you have conation in your heart do not do that it's time for Revival now look God is coming now head where are you I'm not going to feel better if they called me that I believe in brother Bram I want to see the god of I want to have an experience with him I want to feel him I want to feel him in me I want to see the Revival in my heart that's the point where I need to see every believer we want to enter into a step and that step is in God and for that for us to enter there they have must come from God yes and God must put it in you amen and that's so is the that's so is the word that's Theos that's the seven of seal that's that Dimension we are talking about is something that must come from God sent by God and that will reach your soul yes amen it's the same that now I'm going to say something because I'm at the hand listen brother say one point here paragraph 5 is this this this quotation which is taking me to the he said my brother what we are desire we desire today an anient Revival of the Holy Spirit again and that has to come from God and that has to make God be manifested [Music] himself we want to see the strong wings like the day of Pentecost do you listen that what we want what weire today my brothers we want ancient Revival again from to manifest God we want to a strong wind Supernatural from heav like what happened on the day of Pentecost before that there were religious following Jesus before that that's what touch me Andre Peter hrew before the Revival of the ho spirit before the day of PC they were just the religious following Jesus on the days of Pentecost something came and it enters into they were not religious they had something they experience something said that's what we need today we we we we have a lot of people following we are in the message following the message we want God of us and comes today and we ask where is the god of now we have the problem we have the situation here brother did not go in in in in Gra no it not go with that let's not be religious let's have the dimension of message the other Apostles after the days of P they were following Jesus now we want to give the name followers okay that's what says to keep what says they were just the relig followers of Jesus followers of Jesus now God himself was wasn't inside what we not followers of message not religious of message we need one day of Pentecost that's the Revival one day you super need the days of two things come Supernatural Wing Supernatural Wing after that they saw the of fire and the of fire to uh to divide into part part and the Shar part descended after that of ENT that day they were not followers of Jesus now everybody who saw them he was asking to you you that that's the church we want to enter am we have a lot of followers who follows this man they don't have these pillars of fire in in in in them but just follow this man the book was that is because every believer should enter into am into that stage what weire that wind that descend on the wind wind send from God they had the of might wind amen which was sent from God before that they were all religious and followers of Jesus but they had to go and to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit and that's true before that they were supposed to receive the only Spirit Ring Of The Wind we will be sent to the bride amen there's three types of there three types of Believers if you're not in that category then you must be the belie Believers of Christ so message three three types of Believers paragraph 9 97 when is this wind that this wind comes toward the this is the reason why I believe if brother believe that it means the reason why I believe that when the bride is called out of out of what out of seven Church the Bride of the the hand time is being called the he called them out of and were chosen set in The Book of Life when the Brad is called out elected and set in The Book of Life there will be like a sound from Heaven that will take such a baptism of the Holy Spirit into th bride amen I'm repeating inen that's that will take from [Music] the god prom prom the the Rapture the Rapture is not in church the Rapture is in that experience I don't care how my science how many science how many astronauts how many they can sign it up everything else and there can be many many million miles that I can see but I don't care that nothing about that there is a heaven and there's a little Jesus Christ little Jesus CHR that will come in the bar form and receive his church to himself that's how we will come in the bar and receive the his church in the in into to himself no matter how seems it be the truth God said so that's what believer [Music] amen is there for it's there only for the bride who have been chosen there will be a a a certain Soul seals that has to come from heaven and that seals has to enter into the heart of believer and that's what's going to make uh Rapture that's what's going to make the rapture because
