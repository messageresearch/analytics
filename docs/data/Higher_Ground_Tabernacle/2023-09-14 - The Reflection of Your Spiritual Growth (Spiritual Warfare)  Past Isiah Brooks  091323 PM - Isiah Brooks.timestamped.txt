[32:12] come to be Sanctified
[32:18] amen before we come to that perfect
[32:21] perfect place in Christ
[32:25] so Jude 1.
[32:28] we're going to read from the 20th to the
[32:31] 23rd verse
[32:35] and it reads easy but ye be loved
[32:39] building up yourselves on your Most Holy
[32:43] Faith praying in the Holy Ghost
[32:46] S
[32:47] [Music]
[32:51] free keep yourselves in the love of God
[32:55] looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus
[32:59] Christ unto eternal life
[33:06] and some have compassion making a
[33:09] difference
[33:12] and others say with fear pull them out
[33:15] of the fire hating even the Garment
[33:18] spotted by the flesh
[33:33] this will be reading from the third
[33:35] verse to the seventh verse
[33:43] amen
[33:45] third verse reads for though we walk in
[33:49] the flesh we do not war after the flesh
[33:54] for the weapons of our Warfare are not
[33:57] carnal But Mighty to God to the pulling
[34:00] down of strongholds is
[34:08] casting down imaginations and every High
[34:11] thing that exalt itself against the
[34:13] knowledge of God and bring it to
[34:15] captivity every thought to The Obedience
[34:18] of Christ
[34:26] and having in a Readiness to Revenge all
[34:30] Disobedience when your obedience is
[34:33] fulfilled news
[34:39] do you look on things after the outward
[34:43] appearance If any man trusts himself uh
[34:46] trust to himself that he is Christ let
[34:49] him of himself think this again that as
[34:53] he is Christ even so are we
[35:04] Christopher
[35:06] hallelujah amen let us pray Our Father
[35:10] God we thank you for your grace
[35:16] thank you for the lovely day Lord God
[35:18] that you have given unto us father you
[35:21] have kept us from all hurt harm
[35:27] you have kept us full and Anointed with
[35:30] the Holy Ghost and we so thank you for a
[35:33] lovely day father bless the service
[35:36] tonight
[35:38] grant us Lord
[35:47] in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen
[35:50] amen you may be seated
[35:54] I like to entitle this message
[35:57] the reflection
[36:00] of your spiritual growth
[36:03] and the reason why I am bringing it out
[36:07] because every man
[36:10] every woman is who claimed to be
[36:13] Christians
[36:14] should always take inventory
[36:18] of their spiritual growth
[36:21] so much show that when the Lord comes
[36:28] it's always good
[36:31] to be ready
[36:34] uh just going to give you a little
[36:36] illustration
[36:38] when I was a boy
[36:41] we used to catch the city bus
[36:45] downtown
[36:48] and we knew uh the time that the bus
[36:51] would come to that particular stop
[37:51] and there are other people who are
[37:53] waiting
[38:09] God is on a schedule
[38:14] right
[38:15] and when God time is to translate
[38:23] he's not going to send someone by your
[38:27] house
[38:30] to say you got five minutes
[38:34] before I come it is against the word
[38:38] Bible said behold I come quickly
[38:44] and every man is
[38:54] he tells us about the ranches
[38:59] son
[39:04] and she was waiting in the door
[39:10] he was being criticized
[39:13] she was waiting in the foreign
[39:58] [Music]
[40:04] you reflect
[40:06] the light of God
[40:10] we reflect the light of God
[40:13] I have in my notes take God at his words
[40:19] and the Bride of Jesus Christ is
[40:21] ordained
[40:23] and take God at his word
[40:27] I can recall a couple of incidents
[40:30] one is when Peter
[40:33] was on the sea and Jesus came Walking On
[40:38] The Water
[40:41] Peter said Lord
[40:51] did not reason with himself
[40:59] in his heart
[41:01] Hallelujah and he did not hesitate
[41:05] and when he began to walk on the water
[41:09] never thought about the impossibility
[41:14] he just thought about the possibility
[41:18] Hallelujah is that right in other words
[41:21] he did
[41:29] and
[41:38] she asked Hallelujah
[41:48] [Music]
[42:05] she she could have said a lot of things
[42:17] but the Bride of Jesus Christ
[42:23] [Music]
[42:27] Hallelujah because in this day they have
[42:32] made science is
[42:35] that right
[42:37] science just didn't happen
[42:41] it was a very tall
[42:47] like ever he gave her the scientific way
[42:52] of reproducing
[42:55] with God had already given them away
[43:01] was by the spoken words
[43:08] because in that day it was a seduce
[43:13] doctor
[43:16] who
[43:18] seduced Eve
[43:24] and by one word
[43:33] he added one word
[43:36] now I'm gonna say things
[43:39] so that you will understand where I'm
[43:41] going for companies you and I have come
[43:44] through a lot of Trials
[43:51] and and you know in so doing
[43:55] we have come through a lot of doctrines
[44:01] we have heard a lot of things
[44:04] but I want to say tonight
[44:08] in order to see the full effects
[44:14] you must dump out
[44:17] the junk everything
[44:22] that doesn't coincide with the message
[44:25] Hallelujah
[44:33] why because if you don't because
[44:36] Satan will keep
[44:38] from making making a Rapture
[44:42] we've come not only to justify but the
[44:46] message
[44:49] Hallelujah not only to sanctify
[44:52] fill us with the Holy Ghost
[44:55] and in order for God
[45:02] you
[45:08] must do something Hallelujah
[45:12] he said that is not a victory it is
[45:15] apparent Victory if God puts you through
[45:17] a hole push you through the pipes
[45:21] there is no victory in there
[45:24] you must do something
[45:27] is that right he said the word of God
[45:32] according to Matthew 25
[45:35] um Revelations
[45:37] has made herself ready
[45:41] Hallelujah building up your Most Holy
[45:45] Faith
[45:48] when it comes to building up your most
[45:51] holy things
[45:52] I believe Jude had Peter in Mind
[45:58] of a perfect man
[46:01] it's your Most Holy Faith

[46:23] Republic Hallelujah because someone not
[46:27] as strong as we are
[46:31] some we have to have compassion
[46:35] the difference
[46:38] all right and then some of them yeah
[46:44] Hallelujah
[46:47] because they have allowed themselves
[46:50] to be given over to enticing spirits
[46:56] [Music]
[47:26] there is no reasoning
[47:30] Hallelujah now think about it if Moses I
[47:35] mean excuse me Noah annoying had
[47:37] reasoned with himself
[47:41] thought that he would um better
[47:45] buildings
[47:53] he had to do it according to the
[47:55] patterns
[47:57] no it was familiar

[48:13] and without foreign

[48:32] [Music]
[48:38] we all
[48:40] go through a lot of things
[48:44] but we sometimes forget
[48:46] that the weapons of our Warfare are not
[48:50] carnalism
[48:55] we fight the Devils Hallelujah
[49:03] and when evil thought listen
[49:41] every High thing that exalt itself
[49:45] against the knowledge of God
[49:51] the Bible said bring it into captivity
[49:57] to The Obedience of Christ
[50:01] and sometimes you gotta wrestle with it
[50:06] [Music]
[50:08] bring it down
[50:16] you and I are here
[50:22] I thought about this the other day

[51:35] saying that we are Christians
[51:37] does it make us a Christian

[51:43] and really when you're born again
[51:46] do everything you know

[52:25] him once you don't love him Hallelujah

[52:37] enticing experience
[52:39] that will make you call yourself uh that
[52:43] would make you say a lover brother

[53:01] considered prayerfully first

[1:06:25] uh
[1:06:34] your life speaks as loud as your

[1:07:54] place where she deserved
[1:07:56] between the two Spirits
[1:07:59] Hallelujah she will become what is
[1:08:05] because stop listening to what man say
[1:08:10] and get back to the world
[1:08:17] but when your confessions say one thing
[1:08:27] that's because you've got an
[1:08:29] intellectual Faith
[1:08:30] it's not a Faith from your heart
[1:08:34] that shows that outside here
[1:08:37] the knowledge of God
[1:09:04] the same scientific things
[1:09:08] would prove that that wasn't the right
[1:09:12] wasn't the right prove it

[1:19:44] that could be done

[1:19:53] Abomination
[1:19:58] you understand me and when people

[1:20:03] that is abomination with God
