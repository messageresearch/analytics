[0:00] prophecy has now become
[0:02] uh once spoken by a prophet has now
[0:04] become evident
[0:07] and that's what the word of god tells us
[0:08] in this last day that
[0:10] uh modern events is being made clear by
[0:14] prophecy
[0:15] things that have already been
[0:17] prophesied of
[0:20] a prophet is not just a
[0:22] any man he's one hand-picked man by god
[0:26] and they don't often come
[0:29] into this
[0:30] dimension but it often when they do come
[0:33] you know that the church at large has
[0:36] backslidden
[0:37] and god sends his own voice
[0:40] through a man to draw their attention
[0:43] and to try to get them back to the truth
[0:47] for israel he did that for hundreds of
[0:50] years
[0:52] but for the
[0:53] gentiles
[0:54] this is the first prophet we have ever
[0:56] had in history
[0:59] and throughout the bible there is no
[1:00] evidence of a jewish gentile prophet
[1:04] but if you understand the bible that is
[1:06] one of the mysteries of the seventh seal
[1:09] that god in the last day promised the
[1:12] son of man
[1:14] and the son of man is jesus christ
[1:17] himself
[1:18] we don't claim that william branham was
[1:21] jesus christ but it was god hiding
[1:23] behind
[1:25] the flesh of that man
[1:27] which he has always done
[1:30] the bible tells us that moses was christ
[1:34] you see
[1:35] and jesus christ himself had not even
[1:37] been born in this dimension yet
[1:41] but god always sends his spirit he
[1:43] always brings us uh a confirmation
[1:47] that the the the
[1:49] invisible
[1:51] is more real
[1:53] than the visible
[1:55] and that this dimension is just the
[1:58] negative part
[2:00] of the reality of what is really and
[2:02] truly real
[2:05] there is something in man that makes us
[2:07] know that even though we may not have
[2:09] read any type of literature to say god
[2:13] exists but there's something in the soul
[2:15] of man that that makes us know he exists
[2:19] we can criticize people in india or
[2:22] africa or or south america because they
[2:24] might be worshiping idols but the reason
[2:27] why they do that is because they know
[2:29] there is a higher being they know that
[2:31] there is a god and they understand they
[2:33] were just not made by evolution
[2:38] they understand the least of things that
[2:42] the god who created the heavens and the
[2:44] earth is still alive
[2:47] and they do whatever they can do to find
[2:49] him and of course satan gets in the
[2:51] process of that
[2:53] and mislead them
[2:55] but one thing for certain god is always
[2:57] true
[2:59] think about it how israel looked for the
[3:01] messiah
[3:03] knew he was coming according to the
[3:05] scripture
[3:06] they missed his birth
[3:08] and they missed his death
[3:10] but most of all they missed his life
[3:13] when he was born israel knew nothing
[3:15] about it and god had to choose
[3:18] wise men and shepherds
[3:21] to declare that jesus christ
[3:23] god of earth and heaven had been born in
[3:26] a manger
[3:27] all the religious people never knew he
[3:30] was here
[3:31] this is the reason why they crucified
[3:34] him
[3:34] because according to their theology
[3:37] their doctrine divinity their
[3:39] interpretation of the scripture jesus
[3:41] did not come in the way they expected
[3:43] him to come
[3:45] matter of fact he came in a way that
[3:47] they would probably never thought he
[3:48] would come
[3:50] a lamb
[3:51] born in a manger
[3:54] but that was the way he did come
[3:56] and even when he did come you had herod
[3:59] who tried to kill him
[4:01] this world has never wanted god because
[4:04] this world does not belong if i could
[4:06] say to god
[4:08] even though god created it
[4:10] adam forfeited his rights
[4:13] and from that point on satan has reigned
[4:17] over the earth this is why things have
[4:19] become worse
[4:21] and now we understand this age as the
[4:24] the most evilest age ever
[4:27] this is the most deceptive age because
[4:30] in this age
[4:32] satan is ruling
[4:34] he is the god of this age
[4:37] for now
[4:39] but we understand by god's grace that
[4:42] even even in the darkest of all nights
[4:45] god always shines light
[4:48] because the bible said he's never left
[4:50] himself without a witness
[4:54] we take it for granted
[4:56] that we can see that
[4:58] brother branimo william branham is
[5:01] malachi 4.
[5:03] we take it for granted that he is luke
[5:05] 17 30.
[5:07] but there are millions of people who
[5:09] can't see what we see
[5:12] and by seeing who he is it's more than
[5:15] that you know he didn't come for us to
[5:17] sympathize with him and say oh by
[5:19] knowledge i know that that he is the
[5:22] prophet of this day but he didn't come
[5:24] to
[5:25] identify himself he came to identify
[5:28] jesus
[5:29] see that's what that's the way john the
[5:31] baptist was he did not come to be
[5:34] identified as some great prophet because
[5:36] they asked him who are you
[5:38] are you jeremiah or you know one of the
[5:41] great prophets he says you know are you
[5:43] the christ no no no no i'm neither of
[5:46] those
[5:47] and then he read a scripture a quote in
[5:50] a scripture that was in malachi and they
[5:53] did not even recognize it
[5:56] says no
[5:57] i'm just one the voice of one crying in
[6:00] the wilderness
[6:01] prepare you the way of the lord
[6:04] it was in their scripture but they could
[6:06] not see it
[6:08] had not been quickened to them
[6:10] and therefore when they missed the
[6:12] prophet they missed the messiah
[6:16] because it was the prophet who pondered
[6:18] to the messiah and said this is him
[6:22] amen i'm not worthy to lose
[6:24] the latches of his shoes
[6:27] that's what our world has done
[6:30] everybody's talking about the rapture
[6:32] everybody's talking about the
[6:33] translation and they've gotten the wrong
[6:35] revelation of his coming amen
[6:38] because theologians
[6:40] have interpreted the word in their own
[6:43] way
[6:44] they've made movies about it and
[6:46] everybody believe that's the way it's
[6:48] going to be
[6:49] when jesus had plainly said in his word
[6:52] he'll be like a thief in the night
[6:58] they won't even know
[7:00] that the rapture is taking place
[7:03] until it's gone
[7:07] we had a prophet and
[7:11] one of the world want to call us crazy
[7:14] because we believed in it well you won't
[7:16] be the first
[7:18] those who followed noah was crazy
[7:21] those who followed moses was crazy
[7:24] and even those who followed jesus
[7:27] was crazy
[7:28] see so the world can't see who you are
[7:31] so much so jesus said if they whatever
[7:33] they did if can't you see what they did
[7:35] in the green tree if they persecuted me
[7:38] if they mistreated me what are they
[7:40] going to do with you amen those of you
[7:42] who come in the dry
[7:45] so we know that understanding this
[7:47] message and declaring what it is and who
[7:49] it is is not a thing
[7:52] this message is not william branham
[7:54] this message is jesus christ
[7:57] in word form
[8:00] and if you can believe the word of it
[8:02] you can receive the spirit of it
[8:05] which is nothing but the true holy
[8:07] spirit
[8:09] the prophet of god talks about it in a
[8:10] shame
[8:12] and how people will be ashamed of christ
[8:14] they've always been ashamed of the true
[8:17] religion of god or the true salvation of
[8:20] god pentecostals used to be it used to
[8:22] be a shame to be one of them but see
[8:25] they have compromised now they're one of
[8:28] them
[8:29] not of god they've become so worldly
[8:32] they wanted to be accepted but those who
[8:34] are truly of god you are never accepted
[8:38] amen
[8:39] not even by your loved ones
[8:42] because you're peculiar
[8:44] you're strange
[8:46] you're different
[8:48] and that's good
[8:49] because we're not from this world
[8:52] we come from god and we go back to god
[8:56] hallelujah
[8:57] in the message he said just a perfect
[9:00] message
[9:01] back
[9:02] to the word
[9:04] he was talking about how eliezer went to
[9:07] get his bride
[9:09] he said ella uh i'm sorry yeah eliza
[9:12] went to get isaac abroad his go get that
[9:15] bride now he's describing his ministry
[9:18] he said that's my duty that's what god
[9:20] told me go get my bride
[9:24] that's what i'm here for
[9:26] that's what he says
[9:28] that's what i'm trying to do is call
[9:32] out a bride amen
[9:35] they missed it
[9:37] they
[9:38] they saw the signs of the messiah
[9:41] they saw how he preached to the poor
[9:44] they saw how the message he preached
[9:46] heal the brokenhearted they saw how he
[9:49] brought deliverance through to those
[9:51] that were captive yeah right
[9:54] he they saw how he recovered the site
[9:56] many people who who who i wonder where
[9:59] they are whose site was restored that
[10:02] wasn't a man that wasn't the power of
[10:05] william branham
[10:06] that was the son of man that was god
[10:09] amen fulfilling that portion of his
[10:11] ministry through a man
[10:15] right
[10:16] hallelujah and he said at liberty them
[10:20] that are bruised
[10:22] you see many of us are bruised and we
[10:24] have been bruised by religion by
[10:27] politics by family members bruised
[10:30] but not broken amen and god was able to
[10:34] mend us
[10:36] because it was a time of acceptability
[10:38] that god was accepting us it's not that
[10:40] we accepted him
[10:42] he accepted us
[10:44] right the woman at the well he accepted
[10:47] her
[10:48] the woman at simon's house he accepted
[10:51] her
[10:53] right he didn't reject her everybody the
[10:55] religious system is the ones they're the
[10:57] ones who rejected these people matthew
[11:00] the tax collector amen was uh was uh
[11:03] contrary to the jewish belief uh here
[11:06] was a jew amen doing business for wrong
[11:09] stealing for rome cheating for rome and
[11:12] yet jesus christ come said come and
[11:15] follow me
[11:17] hallelujah look what brother branham
[11:20] says
[11:21] he says i'm only
[11:23] building
[11:24] the hour is close at hand
[11:27] when you're going to see
[11:29] something happen
[11:31] this is 1965
[11:34] when something is going to take place
[11:37] and all this background here has only
[11:40] been laying a foundation
[11:43] for a short quick message
[11:46] that will shake the whole nations
[11:50] you hear what i'm saying now you gotta
[11:52] understand people say well it won't be
[11:55] an open show
[11:56] but brother adam says in 1965
[11:59] he said it's going to shake the nations
[12:03] everybody here
[12:05] in the nations will know that jesus
[12:09] christ is alive and well
[12:17] so many people misunderstand that
[12:20] i
[12:22] i listening to it i i didn't intend to
[12:24] listen to it but so many people
[12:26] misunderstand
[12:28] the quotes where he says i ride this
[12:30] trail again
[12:32] and many people backslid because you
[12:34] know what
[12:35] he
[12:36] died but he said this was a thus said
[12:39] the lord
[12:42] and people couldn't understand it
[12:45] it wasn't a man
[12:46] saying i ride this trail again
[12:50] it was a holy spirit
[12:54] amen listen i i can't even speak what
[12:56] yeah i don't know what i told you
[12:58] i had a dream some time ago and i didn't
[13:00] understand it until just now
[13:02] but anyhow
[13:06] the thing is
[13:08] it has to stay in continuity with the
[13:11] scripture
[13:14] after elijah rode the trail
[13:18] elijah rode the trail
[13:25] in the in the quoting of the dreams
[13:28] elijah went to heaven
[13:33] but then there was another brother who
[13:34] was a a saint of god
[13:37] he received a white horse too you don't
[13:39] hear people talking about that one
[13:40] though
[13:43] and he was able to take that same bread
[13:45] and horse breed of horse and he did what
[13:48] he did and he went up to heaven
[13:50] and he stopped the horse and he came
[13:52] back down why
[13:54] it wasn't time for him
[13:57] but the same word
[14:00] that captured and took william branham
[14:03] to heaven
[14:04] it's the same word that will take us
[14:08] and what people don't understand is that
[14:11] that vision is true
[14:13] but everybody must understand the
[14:15] interpretation
[14:17] is spiritual
[14:20] it's like david
[14:22] while he was preaching
[14:23] they pierced my hand and my feet
[14:29] they never pierced david hands
[14:32] they never pierced his feet
[14:38] but they did jesus
[14:40] why because that was not david speaking
[14:44] that was jesus christ speaking
[14:47] christ the anointing speaking through
[14:49] him i know
[14:52] nobody can make me doubt
[14:56] i think i told y'all i had a dream about
[14:58] when brother branham visited me and i
[14:59] don't say that to say it lightly
[15:01] this could wipe my salvation out by and
[15:03] i'm not going to tell you the dream
[15:05] but now i understand the dream
[15:08] and i'm going to tell you something like
[15:10] this
[15:11] the best is yet to come
[15:15] amen
[15:17] but we must stay with this word
[15:21] we can't depart from it we can't add to
[15:24] it
[15:25] we can't take it or take away from it we
[15:28] must take it just like it is and the
[15:30] holy ghost will reveal to you what it
[15:33] means and what it says and what it
[15:35] stands for
[15:37] go listen to and know if it's not
[15:40] 65 815
[15:43] see what is happening
[15:46] there's a move of god that's moving
[15:48] because the bride has been quickened
[15:51] she's alive
[15:53] but she's not in a position where she
[15:55] should be because she needs revival
[16:00] all of the trash needs to be taken out
[16:02] of her life
[16:04] she found herself is that right brother
[16:06] said in the preview of the church he
[16:08] said the bride at the end was getting
[16:10] out of step and he was crying out stay
[16:13] in line stay in line and what was it
[16:17] we got out of step
[16:19] but thank god we get back in line amen
[16:23] look what he said see she's been
[16:25] quickened
[16:26] and that's what people don't understand
[16:27] we've got so many cults
[16:29] you got baptist cult
[16:31] presbyterian cults pentecost to call
[16:34] message calls you got calls
[16:37] everywhere
[16:38] but it doesn't take away from the truth
[16:40] amen
[16:43] and you always stay with the word
[16:46] when when a revelation will take you way
[16:49] out yonder
[16:50] you bring it right back here
[16:52] because this is the euro theorem
[16:55] this is the amen
[16:58] see what i'm saying
[17:04] isn't that true
[17:05] look look there in kings they were
[17:07] looking for elijah to return
[17:10] he never did
[17:13] but the prophets were they're not right
[17:15] listen they were looking where is he
[17:17] they knew he went and they were looking
[17:19] for him he never did return why the
[17:21] anointing that was on him amen was now
[17:24] on elisha amen
[17:26] they missed it
[17:29] just watch
[17:31] this is coming from the same message and
[17:33] knowing not
[17:34] and it's an urgency you hear him preach
[17:36] that message you need to listen to it
[17:38] amen i said is 8 15 65
[17:42] and knoweth it not
[17:44] it's an
[17:45] sea
[17:46] he said just watch
[17:48] stay close to christ
[17:52] let me warn you now as a minister of the
[17:54] gospel of this
[17:57] don't take any foolishness
[18:00] don't imagine anything
[18:03] stay right there until this inside of
[18:05] the inside is anchored to the word
[18:09] that you're right in christ
[18:12] because that's the only thing that's
[18:14] going to cause we're in the most
[18:17] deceitful age that we ever lived in
[18:20] it would deceive the very elected if it
[18:23] was possible
[18:25] because they have anointing they can do
[18:28] anything like the rest of them
[18:31] clean your lives up
[18:34] pay your debts
[18:35] oh no man jesus said now i mean like
[18:39] your house renting stuff you got to do
[18:42] it
[18:42] get all the things off your hands get
[18:46] everything right make it ready
[18:48] get ready remember
[18:51] in the name of the lord
[18:53] something is fixing to happen amen
[18:58] amen y'all hear what i'm saying
[19:00] you hear what's happening
[19:02] it's an urgency
[19:05] and you say what do you mean you see
[19:06] whenever the prophet prophesied
[19:09] something it has to come to pass
[19:12] it may take a long time
[19:15] i think it was 400 years before isaiah
[19:17] prophecy came to pass about jesus
[19:20] but nothing can stop it
[19:23] because it's not the man that
[19:24] prophesying is god that's prophesying
[19:27] through the man
[19:29] hallelujah think about how long it took
[19:32] for isaiah nine and six behold unto us a
[19:36] child is born unto us a son is given and
[19:39] the government shall be upon his
[19:41] shoulder and his name shall be called
[19:43] wonderful counselor the mighty god the
[19:45] everlasting father and the prince of
[19:48] peace
[19:49] it couldn't stop
[19:51] that word kept circling the earth
[19:53] throughout time until mary arrived
[19:56] hallelujah and then when mary arrived
[19:59] she didn't even know who she was
[20:01] hallelujah until the angel of god comes
[20:04] down and he visits her
[20:06] is that right she received a messenger
[20:09] and the messenger gave her her identity
[20:13] hallelujah pointed her back to the
[20:16] scripture of isaiah 9 right so you and i
[20:19] must understand this messenger gave us
[20:22] our identity hallelujah this is why he
[20:26] preached about mary and preaching about
[20:28] this thing she said lord how could i
[20:31] have a child hallelujah when i know no
[20:34] man hallelujah in other words i'm not a
[20:37] belong to a denomination i don't belong
[20:39] to an organization i don't know how it's
[20:42] going to be done lord how could it be
[20:45] he said this thing
[20:48] will be done by god himself
[20:51] he shall overshadow you the holy ghost
[20:54] that's what jesus who is god the holy
[20:56] ghost the angel said the holy ghost was
[20:59] god
[21:00] he shall overshadow you
[21:03] then he who's the father of jesus
[21:05] the holy ghost then it must be the holy
[21:08] ghost and the father it's the same
[21:10] person
[21:17] hallelujah is that right
[21:19] even when when when the bible tells us
[21:21] even according to matthew 1 23 he says
[21:24] behold a virgin shall be child with
[21:26] child and shall bring forth the son and
[21:28] they shall call his name emmanuel which
[21:30] being interpreted is god with us
[21:33] then joseph being raised from the sleep
[21:35] did as the angel of the lord had bitten
[21:37] him see god had to even let joseph know
[21:40] amen what he was doing
[21:42] right because joseph want the killer
[21:45] hallelujah that was the law if your wife
[21:47] was caught amen in a fowl adultery act
[21:51] stoned her
[21:52] this is why this is why laodicea will be
[21:55] stoned the bible says amen that hail
[21:58] stones what what a hundred pounds amen
[22:01] will drop come on somebody you'll not
[22:03] know what a small rock feel like
[22:06] the head is gone
[22:08] right
[22:11] so it had to come to pass
[22:13] all the prophecies and you said what do
[22:15] you mean
[22:17] on the road to emmaus
[22:19] three men walked that way
[22:21] two men two men walked that way and they
[22:24] begged the third to stay and the third
[22:26] was jesus
[22:27] and the bible said they didn't know who
[22:29] he was he was raised from the dead like
[22:32] he said he would didn't he say it
[22:34] he broke the bread with them in in
[22:36] communion and he talked with them and he
[22:38] told them and then one day i'm going to
[22:40] die but on the third day i raise again
[22:44] i don't know where their minds were
[22:46] i don't know what their ads were because
[22:48] when it all happened they seem to have
[22:50] forgotten everything let me tell you
[22:52] something that's exactly what pressure
[22:55] will do amen
[22:58] if it's only in your head
[23:01] it's gone
[23:03] the only one that had it in his heart
[23:06] was john
[23:08] john never ran
[23:10] and john types the bride
[23:12] you see come to pressure bride won't run
[23:15] right
[23:16] she know who she is
[23:18] and the power of god will be with her
[23:22] don't you know everybody's crying for
[23:24] rain
[23:26] denominations lord give us the holy
[23:28] ghost the organization law the rain
[23:31] the bride is saying send the rain the
[23:34] rain must fall the rain is falling
[23:37] everywhere people are experiencing
[23:39] things they haven't experienced in a
[23:41] long time
[23:42] i'm saying all of these people so that
[23:44] you won't let the rain fall and you fail
[23:48] to get in it and allow it to get into
[23:51] you
[23:52] because this is deception
[23:54] satan is going to keep you as busy as he
[23:57] possibly can
[23:59] to keep you from praying
[24:03] because that's the way
[24:05] the way up
[24:06] is the way down
[24:10] [Laughter]
[24:12] praise the lord see there is a bride not
[24:15] just only is but there is a bride and
[24:17] she's moving
[24:19] right i think it was in 1962 when
[24:21] brother branham said you know that those
[24:24] stars amen came into alignment i got to
[24:26] quote
[24:27] he said hallelujah
[24:29] five stars have come into alignment
[24:32] remember in that time they thought the
[24:33] world was going to burst scientists was
[24:35] saying all kinds of crazy things it was
[24:37] the end of the world and all the things
[24:38] but what they did not know is that the
[24:40] heaven always declared what god is going
[24:43] to do on earth first
[24:45] when jesus that star appeared in heaven
[24:47] showed that the star of david the king
[24:49] of kings was to be born on earth
[24:53] hallelujah and when those five stars are
[24:55] lined up in 1962 amen it was the birth
[25:00] of the bride
[25:02] and remember this is what you need to
[25:04] see what i'm saying if that was the
[25:06] birth of the bride
[25:08] 1963 the seals were open
[25:12] so what was it she received the seals in
[25:15] her infancy
[25:17] she was not mature
[25:19] and it proved she wasn't mature because
[25:21] she handed the word in a matured way
[25:24] this is mine give it to me no give it to
[25:27] me it's mine i was there i was with the
[25:29] prophet you know they they carried on
[25:31] like children
[25:33] hallelujah and in all of that they were
[25:36] there preserving the word
[25:39] for all day
[25:41] now you say what do you mean brother
[25:42] brook see the prophet god knew
[25:45] he told him stand right here watch that
[25:47] rock look at it
[25:49] but they all moved in their own
[25:50] direction so they never caught the real
[25:52] revelation of what the message was
[25:54] that's why they started preaching god
[25:56] sent a prophet there's a time you should
[25:58] have preached that but now we're beyond
[26:01] that amen
[26:02] you know why why should we need we don't
[26:04] need to know where the prophet went and
[26:06] all the little stories he told i know i
[26:08] get in trouble for this but it's true
[26:11] what good is that going to do for you if
[26:13] you don't truly believe what he preached
[26:15] amen it's got to be life
[26:19] he said hallelujah we've got a five-star
[26:22] general spelling j-e-s-u-s
[26:25] placing five stars on us
[26:31] faith
[26:32] f-a-i-t-h he never lost the battle
[26:36] hallelujah he conquered death hell and
[26:39] the grave and if we can see that this
[26:41] picture even that we talked about the
[26:43] seven angels that was to show he's still
[26:46] conqueror
[26:48] he has already conquered laodicea
[26:51] [Music]
[26:52] he conquered it
[26:55] that's why the devil is so mad he's
[26:56] screaming because he knows that if the
[26:59] word of god has come there's somebody
[27:01] here to take it in
[27:03] he's scared of you because we know when
[27:06] the bride shows up his end is at hand
[27:10] amen
[27:12] that's why we see all this crazy stuff
[27:14] in politics
[27:15] it's insanity
[27:18] it truly is all around the world y'all
[27:21] think it's crazy here we're not in some
[27:23] of these other countries
[27:26] people can't discern right from wrong
[27:28] good from evil
[27:30] it's messed up
[27:33] let me finish this quote
[27:35] placing five stars on faith he never
[27:37] lost the battle hallelujah he conquered
[27:39] death hell in the grave he gave he get
[27:42] the he
[27:43] get the devil out of the way
[27:45] hallelujah he's the great chief captain
[27:49] so the devil isn't even in the picture
[27:53] [Music]
[27:55] the greatest battle was ever raged is
[27:58] setting right ready now
[28:01] y'all understand me
[28:02] people of god he did not say
[28:06] the best for last
[28:08] for nothing amen
[28:11] the anointing that we're going to get is
[28:13] far greater than any anointing
[28:17] hallelujah we've ever experienced
[28:20] it's beyond speaking in tongues it's
[28:22] beyond shouting and dancing it's
[28:25] authoritative anointing amen
[28:28] that's why brother said when when jesus
[28:30] was there standing before the podium and
[28:33] he said this day this scripture is
[28:35] fulfilled he said there was no no
[28:37] anointing like that
[28:38] he wasn't jumping and shouting but what
[28:40] was it he used that word with such an
[28:43] authority today marvel at him
[28:47] they couldn't figure them out
[28:48] they stared how can you say
[28:51] this thing is fulfilled we know who you
[28:54] are you marry son you was you was
[28:57] conceived in fornication you had this
[28:59] baby before you even uh you know was
[29:02] impregnated before you even got with
[29:04] joseph they understood
[29:06] they thought they did
[29:08] you came from galilee you know
[29:11] naturals and all this crazy stuff they
[29:13] had
[29:14] going on as rumors
[29:16] but he was a man who was even respected
[29:19] in his own country
[29:21] stood there
[29:23] and said this day
[29:25] this scripture
[29:26] is fulfilled
[29:33] we don't even know what we're dealing
[29:34] with
[29:36] we think that this is some fairy tale
[29:38] and you know
[29:39] so many people think well y'all good you
[29:41] guys you got to be in a cult well jesus
[29:44] was
[29:44] a man that they followed and
[29:47] was he occult to
[29:52] hmm
[29:54] no doubt they thought that
[29:57] see what they didn't understand he was a
[29:59] king
[30:02] and those subjects those ones who
[30:04] followed him knew he was a king
[30:08] they followed him because they were in
[30:09] his kingdom
[30:13] oh glory to god
[30:16] it's raging you say what do you mean
[30:18] brotherhood we must understand
[30:20] this message is no joke
[30:25] i know everybody has interpreted
[30:29] things that shouldn't have left alone
[30:32] because truly god interprets his own
[30:35] word
[30:36] and the bride of jesus christ when you
[30:38] don't understand something leave it amen
[30:41] god will interpret it to you he will
[30:43] un-give you the understanding because
[30:44] it's given to you to know the
[30:46] understanding of the scripture
[30:48] amen

[30:51] when i stood and watched him do things
[30:54] see him reveal things open up you see
[30:57] what you see what he said he i said he's

[31:07] watched him do things see him reveal
[31:11] things open up things say i'll be there

[33:35] and guess what
[33:37] we have already been decreed
[33:40] victorious
[33:43] now what happens
[33:46] he's just talking about how he says we
[33:48] see
[33:49] a roar in the papers
[33:51] across the television and
[33:53] out across the nations where five stars
[33:56] just fell in line with the word what
[33:58] five a number of grace
[34:01] every time those stars come then
[34:04] something happens on earth
[34:06] what's taking place five stars fell in
[34:09] what
[34:10] introducing what since then just look
[34:13] what's taking place
[34:15] germany almost washed off the map some
[34:17] of the magis in the world would say that
[34:20] the world would burst like a watermelon
[34:22] everything just stressful things
[34:23] prophecy by them and for the last days
[34:26] look what's taking place england the
[34:28] other day had a storm that blowed away
[34:30] seventy thousand houses one day
[34:33] disasters everywhere california los
[34:35] angeles like to wash into the ocean what
[34:38] is it beginning of sorrows
[34:40] earthquake has quick picked up
[34:42] everywhere why is it five stars come in
[34:45] line
[34:46] grace god's grace
[34:49] what happened
[34:50] an infant church
[34:53] a bride infancy
[34:56] that power of god has began to fall on
[34:59] her
[35:00] she's taking form
[35:03] a bride for this bridegroom the three
[35:06] stars meant his perfection and the
[35:09] heavenly father of the trinity become
[35:11] one on earth among us
[35:14] god offices become one office
[35:17] what happened now is the church of the
[35:19] living god coming together under the
[35:22] word of god and the astronomic heaven is
[35:25] announcing her approach amen
[35:28] might not believe that but it's the word
[35:31] just the same
[35:33] the world is so behind
[35:35] and so are we
[35:38] god help us
[35:40] what happened
[35:41] he says i might say this friend
[35:44] the church has become
[35:46] is coming forth
[35:48] god moving to have a church without spot
[35:50] or wrinkle and she's predestinated god
[35:53] said so
[35:54] he will have it that makes it right
[35:58] who's a member i don't know i'm trusting
[36:00] to be myself i'm trusting you are a
[36:03] member but he's going to have a body
[36:06] without spot or wrinkle
[36:08] we can believe that or not but it is the
[36:11] truth and i don't mean in your
[36:12] imagination i mean in reality satan will
[36:16] have no power apparel over you
[36:20] this is what i loved about jesus before
[36:22] his death he says yes satan is coming
[36:25] he says satan is coming i know he's
[36:27] coming but he has nothing in me what was
[36:30] he saying i have no doctors in me that
[36:33] he can pull on to make me fall or come
[36:36] short and i'm doing this all for what
[36:39] you i'm doing it for my father because
[36:42] it was written of me that i must go to
[36:44] calvary
[36:45] [Music]
[36:50] and it's written that the bride must
[36:51] suffer
[36:53] he said we will suffer but we are
[36:55] overcome
[36:58] and i believe that these latter-day
[37:00] signs and things that's happening every
[37:02] one of them is peeling
[37:05] peeling together to show that the christ
[37:08] is ready to come for his bride as god in
[37:11] his word made manifest in a man a
[37:14] perfect man so is god and his word
[37:17] coming again making himself manifest in
[37:21] a bride you understand you hear the word
[37:23] i said manifest i didn't say claim it
[37:26] with your mouth it must be seen it must
[37:28] be manifested
[37:30] hallelujah about not
[37:34] not that will do like eve did hybrid it
[37:39] to something else
[37:40] but the
[37:45] unaddressed stand like jesus christ did
[37:50] with his spirit anointing
[37:52] in his word amen i believe it's the
[37:55] announcing now the prophet said there
[37:58] come a day that won't be called day nor
[38:00] night but in the evening time there
[38:02] shall be light all the bible readers
[38:05] know
[38:06] that what happened
[38:08] civilization traveled from the east to
[38:10] the west china is the oldest
[38:11] civilization we have civilization began
[38:14] in the east and it be went with the sun
[38:16] traveling west and you know we we see
[38:19] that well praise god the seals were
[38:21] opening was on sunset mountain hello
[38:23] sunset means the day is ending
[38:27] not only just night but that day is
[38:30] ending
[38:31] and so when the seals were opened it was
[38:33] showing the ending of something
[38:35] in the beginning of something because
[38:37] then he preached the word is the rising
[38:39] of the sun
[38:40] she showed there was a new day a new
[38:42] message a new word that was going to
[38:45] come which did come to prepare the bride
[38:48] of jesus christ for a rapture let me
[38:51] move on
[38:53] because i'm going to tell you something
[38:54] that you may not know maybe you do
[38:57] everybody's looking for the mysteries of
[38:59] the seals to be revealed
[39:01] out there
[39:03] when they fail to see that the mysteries
[39:05] of the seals must be revealed here
[39:07] see if christ is in you
[39:10] the secret is with
[39:12] him and he will reveal the secret as the
[39:16] in
[39:16] individuals those who have him on in the
[39:19] soul
[39:20] god will reveal the next move to you
[39:24] and like brother branham said even if
[39:26] you know it
[39:28] he has trained you so well
[39:31] till you won't tell nobody
[39:34] so when you got somebody well i know
[39:35] what i know let me tell you no
[39:39] it doesn't work that
[39:40] way because it's an individual thing
[39:44] and it's so personal to him
[39:47] right
[39:50] he shut the heavens up
[39:54] the angels stops singing holy holy holy
[39:58] no movement in heaven for a half hour
[40:02] and god brings you to a word to prepare
[40:06] you for a rapture
[40:11] the secret that moves through the bride
[40:14] is on
[40:17] let me say it like this
[40:22] did that still have any idea what she
[40:24] was doing
[40:27] she didn't even know god was working on
[40:28] her behalf
[40:31] but every move esther made
[40:34] was ordained by god
[40:36] now we can read it and we can see elsa
[40:40] and she had no idea she was a living
[40:43] word of god acting out prophecy
[40:46] that one day we'll be able to read her
[40:49] story and know the beginning from the
[40:51] end
[40:53] what about ruth
[40:55] and elsa and ruth are the two books of
[40:56] redemption
[40:59] she didn't know what god told me to do
[41:01] now it was no such thing as that
[41:04] it was an anointing it was a spirit it
[41:06] was god moving them into those channels
[41:09] to fulfill his thought for that day that
[41:11] one day we'll read that and be
[41:14] encouraged by that and understand so how
[41:17] when god elects you and choose you it
[41:20] doesn't matter
[41:21] what your nationality is on earth right
[41:25] amen
[41:26] now we must understand that the uh the
[41:29] nationality of our so-called inheritance
[41:32] uh you know i'm this and i'm that that's
[41:34] nonsense when you become born again you
[41:36] become a new race
[41:38] [Applause]
[41:41] your color means nothing to god
[41:47] ooh jesus y'all is this okay
[41:49] she is under the total leadership
[41:52] of the holy spirit
[41:54] you don't even know it
[41:56] and god is using you
[41:58] amen
[42:01] he can't tell you what he's doing we
[42:03] talk too much
[42:06] but he's using us
[42:11] everything runs out in time
[42:14] and that's what the seven seal did for
[42:16] us everything if you can't understand
[42:18] that something's wrong
[42:19] you know what i'm gonna do this i'm
[42:21] gonna do this in my future future he
[42:22] said everything is running out
[42:25] how you go you don't even know when that
[42:26] final run out is
[42:28] but everything is running out
[42:31] it's coming to the end
[42:33] the church age the end of the seventh
[42:35] seal
[42:36] at the end of the trumpets it's the end
[42:39] of the vials even at the end the ending
[42:42] of the ushering in the millennium
[42:44] that's on the seventh seal
[42:46] it's just like a firing rocket
[42:49] i want you to listen to this
[42:52] that's like a firing a rocket into the
[42:54] air and that rocket explodes here and it
[42:57] goes up
[42:58] and then explodes again and it puts
[43:00] forth put out five stars
[43:05] hallelujah
[43:06] and one of those stars explode and blows
[43:09] up five stars from it
[43:12] and then one of them stars explode and
[43:15] explode and blows out five stars from it
[43:19] see it fades on out
[43:23] what are you saying this message has
[43:25] been moving revelation after revelation
[43:27] after revelation this brother get in
[43:29] this brother get it that brother get it
[43:31] it's just been moving and moving and
[43:33] moving but somehow it's going to move on
[43:36] out
[43:37] but when it moves
[43:38] out it moves us with it
[43:42] that's what the seven seal leaders just
[43:44] ends up time for the world it ends up
[43:46] time for this it ends up time for that
[43:49] it is a time for this it ends up time it
[43:52] is the time everything that's ended up
[43:55] on the seventh seal
[43:58] see
[44:00] but the truth of our existence is being
[44:03] revealed to us now
[44:07] we never understood why we were such
[44:08] oddballs
[44:10] we didn't know
[44:11] who our in our true inheritance we we
[44:14] didn't understand it
[44:16] we couldn't understand why we had such a
[44:18] love and respect for the word we didn't

[46:30] psalms 1 11 112 excuse me one through
[46:33] four this is what we call a decree
[46:35] praise ye the lord
[46:37] blessed is the man that feareth the lord
[46:41] that delighted greatly in his
[46:43] commandments
[46:44] his seed shall might shall be mighty
[46:47] upon the earth the generation of the
[46:50] upright shall be blessed
[46:52] wealth and riches shall be in his house
[46:55] and his righteousness
[46:57] endure forever
[46:59] until unto the upright there arises
[47:02] light in the darkness and he is gracious
[47:05] and full of compassion and righteous see
[47:09] that's a decree
[47:10] [Laughter]
[47:12] hallelujah praise the lord blessed is
[47:16] the man you hear what i'm saying so if
[47:18] you are a man that feareth the lord and
[47:21] delight amen in his commandments he said
[47:24] your seed shall be mighty upon the earth
[47:29] and when you pray you use this
[47:32] lord this is what you said about my seed
[47:40] is that all right and so now you're the
[47:42] seed of god so how much more that this
[47:45] applied to you
[47:47] when the devil comes and says you can't
[47:49] do it
[47:50] take him to the scripture
[47:52] you've been sermon you've been
[47:55] served all notice your devil
[47:58] right
[47:59] listen what he says
[48:03] i i'm trying to give it to you we'll say
[48:05] many think because they speak with
[48:08] tongues they've got the holy ghost
[48:10] that don't mean that
[48:12] though the holy ghost
[48:14] does speak with tongues
[48:16] but until that real
[48:18] genuine holy spirit in there will cope
[48:21] with every word
[48:22] if that holy spirit in you that makes
[48:25] you speak with tongues look back there
[48:28] and doesn't agree with the rest of the
[48:30] world then it's it's the wrong spirit
[48:34] it's got to come from the inside
[48:38] which is the word from the beginning
[48:40] in the in the beginning of the creation
[48:43] of god when god began to create
[48:46] bring you into existence you see you
[48:49] started back there as a seed and worked
[48:52] down to where you are now
[48:54] and then you were all in christ
[48:58] and when christ died he died to redeem
[49:01] all of you
[49:03] and you are a part of this word
[49:06] hallelujah
[49:07] and how can i see the bible see all of
[49:10] it
[49:10] precept precept line upon line here a
[49:14] little there little not one jotted
[49:16] little tittle shall fail how in the
[49:19] world can you being part of the world
[49:22] disagree with the rest of it or any part
[49:25] of it
[49:27] but now he's standing in the midst of
[49:28] the church age
[49:30] church i'm moving on as he said you you
[49:33] say
[49:34] you you how
[49:36] how can you be part of this and not deny
[49:38] any of it
[49:39] it's all true
[49:41] i don't care if you don't understand it
[49:43] it's all true
[49:45] amen because it is god
[49:48] hallelujah praise the lord
[49:50] but now as he's standing in the midst of
[49:52] the church
[49:54] as he stands there revealing who he is
[49:57] in the last day he calls himself the
[50:00] author of creation of god
[50:02] this is and this is what you got to
[50:04] understand leave it
[50:06] you got to die to this
[50:08] this flesh is not you
[50:10] this is of the old creation and what god
[50:13] is trying to get you to see he trying to
[50:16] create a new creation within you
[50:22] this is another creation
[50:24] that has to do with the church
[50:26] this is a special designation of himself
[50:30] he is the creator of that church the
[50:33] heavenly bridegroom created his own
[50:36] bride
[50:38] and when
[50:39] we win throughout the church ages but
[50:42] now
[50:43] more than ever
[50:45] after your faith virtue
[50:47] you see it's him creating you
[50:51] in the spirit is that right because
[50:54] you've got to understand even in the
[50:55] beginning in genesis adam was first
[50:58] created spirit before he was created
[51:00] flesh
[51:02] and therefore god must proceed the same
[51:04] way he always have he must create
[51:07] himself spiritually in you first before
[51:10] they come a transformation
[51:12] of of this flesh
[51:16] you've got to change
[51:18] oh but it ain't you
[51:20] it's christ in you
[51:23] hallelujah the heavenly bridegroom
[51:24] created his own bride and as the spirit
[51:26] of god he comes down and created in the
[51:28] virgin mary the cell from which his body
[51:32] was born
[51:35] see he was the son of god he was a new
[51:38] creation man and god met and joined he
[51:42] was the first of his new creation he is
[51:44] the heart excuse me the head of the new
[51:47] church the new race gives me he is the
[51:49] head of the new race
[51:51] i'm jumping therefore if any man be in
[51:54] christ ii corinthians 5 17 he is a new
[51:57] creature all things old things have
[52:00] passed away behold all things become
[52:03] what knew there you can see the thought
[52:07] that
[52:07] that thought
[52:09] man was of the oh there you can see that
[52:11] though man was of the old
[52:14] uh old order or creation now is union
[52:18] with christ he has become the new
[52:21] creation of god
[52:23] ephesians 2 10 for we are his
[52:26] workmanship created in union with christ
[52:28] jesus unto god good works ephesians 4 24
[52:33] and that he put on the new man which
[52:36] after god is created in righteousness
[52:38] and true holiness
[52:40] the new creation this is it
[52:42] the new creation is not the old creation
[52:45] made over
[52:47] or it could not be called a new creation
[52:50] is that right that's what we need to see
[52:52] in abraham and sarah it was not the old
[52:55] creation created over there were some
[52:58] dna changes hallelujah
[53:01] amen it was a new creation amen and
[53:04] shadow and time it is not it is another
[53:07] creation distinct ah i love that
[53:10] distinct
[53:12] you can tell the difference
[53:15] they don't look to say they don't act
[53:17] the same it's a distinct
[53:21] from one from the old one no longer is
[53:23] he dwelling dealing by way of the flesh
[53:26] that's was how he dealt with israel he
[53:30] chose abraham and of abraham's issues
[53:32] through the garlic you understand he's
[53:35] no longer dealing with the flesh
[53:38] in other words his seed is everywhere
[53:41] it could be a drunkard a whoremonger
[53:45] a a a
[53:46] a drug addict
[53:49] it could be wherever it is
[53:52] he don't care about your lineage
[53:54] naturally
[53:58] he don't even care if you pod you
[54:00] because every jew got to be born again
[54:04] just like the gentile so what i'm trying
[54:06] to say we ought to be blessed we're
[54:07] blessed
[54:09] hallelujah i'm trying to hurry up folks
[54:11] i know i'm i'm not going to read all of
[54:13] this but listen let me tell you
[54:14] something that came from the exposition
[54:16] of the church ages
[54:20] as we said
[54:26] what god has done to us and god done for
[54:28] us
[54:29] we need to understand
[54:32] that we're now in in a warfare
[54:36] and god has given you
[54:38] power over this devil
[54:42] but understand you don't want to just
[54:44] have power over the devil
[54:47] because when those disciples came back
[54:49] and those
[54:50] sons of skiva this is
[54:52] the disciples says lord we
[54:55] we we we had power with the devil
[54:57] see denomination spirit the same holy
[55:00] ghost allowed them to cast out devils
[55:03] same holy ghost
[55:05] but you see the chosen seed that's you
[55:08] that's good all that's good but you want
[55:10] to make sure
[55:12] he comes into the holies of holies
[55:15] see that that's your way of escape
[55:18] that's the only way he's going to
[55:20] identify you'll be identified
[55:22] by the holy ghost in your soul
[55:26] the pentecostal people because they
[55:28] didn't have the truth they were
[55:30] many of them allowed to go
[55:32] and they'll make it because they were
[55:33] under that inspiration of the pentecost
[55:35] but now that the veil has been rent
[55:38] now that we can see the holy holy holy
[55:41] place
[55:42] we understand that god only dwells now
[55:44] in the soul
[55:46] that's what makes the rapture
[55:49] and the god of this evil age is demonic
[55:52] power
[55:53] and you must understand that this
[55:54] demonic power amen is no joke
[55:58] i mean it has filtrated the whole world
[56:00] through television is that right i mean
[56:02] that's that's where they the demons left
[56:04] when they they left uh uh russia i mean
[56:07] uh germany they they came and they they
[56:11] settled in hollywood and hollywood began
[56:13] to get their inspiration from demonic
[56:15] power and they spread the filth and the
[56:18] nonsense and the hatred of god and all
[56:20] that through hollywood and now the whole
[56:23] world has been polluted
[56:26] but you gotta now this is your time to
[56:28] prepare to escape let's not be foolish
[56:32] noah even knew it was going to rain but
[56:34] he didn't know when but he prepared for
[56:35] it didn't he
[56:37] right
[56:38] and let's not be like lot's wife got to
[56:40] be pulled out no we don't want to be
[56:42] poor we want to leave out
[56:44] and so you and i must understand by the
[56:46] grace of god amen that this thing is no
[56:49] joke and understand when god bring
[56:52] deliverance he bring a flood
[56:56] of some sort whether it be spiritually
[56:59] or naturally
[57:01] you've got to cross it
[57:04] you've got to come through it
[57:06] right noah built the ark they was able
[57:08] to cross over it
[57:10] right
[57:11] and there's an ark that had to go
[57:13] through the jordan
[57:14] right
[57:15] and a flood is a spiritual disturbance
[57:18] disturbance
[57:19] and the
[57:20] you know and the enemy's wrath is
[57:22] against you that's what we call a flood
[57:24] when the enemy comes in like a flood
[57:26] that spiritual wrath and satan is trying
[57:28] to consume you in every way he said the
[57:31] lord will lift up a standard
[57:33] in other words the demonic power mixed
[57:35] together
[57:37] you know uh
[57:39] you know we know the colors white red
[57:40] and black big horses power destroy what
[57:43] to see they're here to destroy the work
[57:45] of the holy ghost
[57:47] but they cannot
[57:49] and i'm trying to tell you something and
[57:50] i don't know how but i'm gonna go to
[57:52] this last quote and then i'm gonna let
[57:53] you go there's no way i can complete but
[57:56] i normally get too much going on anyway
[57:58] here but um
[58:04] i know
[58:06] i know
[58:07] for myself
[58:09] i'm crying out that god will
[58:13] not let me come short
[58:17] and take me all the way
[58:20] if there's only one person
[58:23] in this world that could
[58:25] be an example
[58:27] i believe this message with all my heart
[58:31] i hate i hate what it's become because
[58:33] of what men have done
[58:36] but i believe that god has given each
[58:38] and every one of us spiritual eyes to
[58:39] see
[58:41] that we've got to do more than what
[58:43] we're doing
[58:45] for ourselves
[58:48] right
[58:48] i mean it doesn't matter if we don't see
[58:50] this as he that we need to see this
[58:53] this is hard so change that we become
[58:55] slaves for the holy ghost
[58:58] our minds and our thoughts are gone we
[59:00] that's what we need we you know dead man
[59:02] can't think
[59:03] but that's the way we need to be that's
[59:05] what he's requiring
[59:07] a complete surrender dead to self
[59:10] and i think that i know it's not a
[59:12] thinking i know that's what he's
[59:13] requiring
[59:18] look what brother adam said and i'm
[59:19] closing with this quote
[59:21] what we are coming here for
[59:24] what are we doing
[59:26] are we coming here playing game
[59:30] are we coming here meeting as a lodge
[59:35] it's christ can't come until the church
[59:37] is perfectly ready
[59:39] he's waiting on us
[59:41] i believe we're at the end
[59:44] look
[59:45] at
[59:47] in california look at the riots look at
[59:49] 19 people being killed racial
[59:52] didn't tell you here not long ago
[59:55] that martin luther king would lead the
[59:58] people into a massacre how many remember
[1:00:00] that
[1:00:01] it isn't them colored people
[1:00:04] it's them leading leaders
[1:00:08] stirring them up
[1:00:10] now i need you to listen to what i'm
[1:00:11] saying because this thing is on the
[1:00:13] uprise
[1:00:14] it is an integration segregation
[1:00:18] and whatever they want to call it it's
[1:00:20] the devil
[1:00:22] that's right not only to the white
[1:00:24] colored this is all of them its devils
[1:00:29] the mental faculties and reasoning of
[1:00:32] men is broke down
[1:00:34] there is no hope
[1:00:35] it's beyond hope the world uh the whole
[1:00:39] thing is
[1:00:40] petra petritated sores
[1:00:44] the mental faculties of man they can't
[1:00:47] make decisions
[1:00:48] i'm not a politician
[1:00:50] i don't neither i don't neither democrat
[1:00:54] or republican
[1:00:55] they're all filthy
[1:00:57] i for i'm for one kingdom
[1:01:00] and that's the kingdom of jesus christ
[1:01:03] that's all but how in the world did you
[1:01:06] ever see a bunch of puppets like we got
[1:01:08] up there now like the church of like the
[1:01:11] bunch of texans we've got in there why
[1:01:14] they say whatever the people want if
[1:01:17] they want communism we'll give them
[1:01:19] communism if they want integration we'll
[1:01:22] give them integration want segregation
[1:01:25] we'll give whatever she did where is a
[1:01:28] man
[1:01:29] oh god
[1:01:31] that's like the puppet
[1:01:33] where is man man that man
[1:01:36] that stands for principle
[1:01:39] where is a woman that stands for a
[1:01:41] principal where is the church that
[1:01:43] stands for a principle
[1:01:45] i ain't got a nickel worth of time for
[1:01:48] wishy-washy giving in compromising
[1:01:51] spirit
[1:01:52] a woman is a woman let her be lady if a
[1:01:55] man is a man let him be man
[1:02:00] and so i'm i'm i'm closing out with that
[1:02:04] uh there's a lot of things
[1:02:08] you know what brother brahm said he said
[1:02:10] adam took life of fellowship
[1:02:12] and joy with god and turned it into a
[1:02:15] desert of spiritual darkness that
[1:02:17] brought forth all sin more decay pain
[1:02:20] suffering delusion and corruption that
[1:02:22] that wars within the soul of men
[1:02:25] adam did that by doing what breaking one
[1:02:29] word
[1:02:30] so i i say this by the grace of god
[1:02:35] if you can't see that you are the
[1:02:37] prophecy
[1:02:39] you're the one to fulfill
[1:02:41] the prophecy that's been prophesied
[1:02:45] then you're missing the whole thing
[1:02:48] if you can't see that god has more for
[1:02:50] you to do
[1:02:53] than to sit at mcdonald's or
[1:02:55] go to restaurants and we all do but
[1:02:58] there's more to it than that
[1:03:01] if you can't see that god is trying to
[1:03:02] raise up a supernatural race
[1:03:05] a supernatural people a supernatural
[1:03:08] army
[1:03:09] then you're missing it whether you be
[1:03:11] male or female
[1:03:13] you must understand by god's grace that
[1:03:15] god brought us here for a purpose and
[1:03:18] i'm i'm just paraphrasing some of my
[1:03:20] notes
[1:03:21] and that is to put satan under our feet
[1:03:24] the whole purpose of the bible
[1:03:28] is about his bride
[1:03:32] and you're it
[1:03:35] people help pray for me and i'll pray
[1:03:37] for you
[1:03:39] you know when when you start talking
[1:03:40] about cleaning up your life
[1:03:42] and getting right with god a lot of
[1:03:43] times people don't want that
[1:03:46] but you ain't going to heaven without it
[1:03:52] dying to yourself everybody think they
[1:03:53] got rights you ain't got no rights when
[1:03:55] you come to god
[1:03:57] none
[1:03:59] you got to die to everything you think
[1:04:00] you have a right to
[1:04:04] that's from the pulpit to the back of
[1:04:06] the door
[1:04:08] until you're willing to die and suffer
[1:04:10] none of us don't wanna survive i ain't
[1:04:11] gotta take that no you really don't
[1:04:14] but a true lamb
[1:04:15] will lay it down amen
[1:04:18] let's stand
[1:04:22] it is what it is
[1:04:23] i don't even know whether
[1:04:26] anyway i'll just leave it as a way
[1:04:28] but i know one thing
[1:04:32] always keep in mind god interprets his
[1:04:35] own word
[1:04:41] men we get in ourselves and we think we
[1:04:43] know what god wants
[1:04:46] but something's gonna happen
[1:04:49] you know what only the bride is gonna be
[1:04:51] able to see it
[1:04:53] other people gonna think it's fanaticism
[1:04:56] is that right i mean come on when jesus
[1:04:58] rode into nazareth
[1:05:00] the pharisees and sadducees they stood
[1:05:02] there said who is this
[1:05:04] when the people on the ground the poor
[1:05:06] begley people were saying hosanna hold
[1:05:09] on a blessing is he that comes in the
[1:05:10] name of the lord you see you got those
[1:05:13] who see and those who can't see always
[1:05:16] thank god for your sight
[1:05:19] you can't make them see
[1:05:22] only god gives sight to the blind
[1:05:26] and i trust that god keep my eyes and my
[1:05:28] heart open to receive everything that he
[1:05:31] has for me
[1:05:33] do i get scared i get scared sometimes
[1:05:36] that
[1:05:37] may not be the right word to say i don't
[1:05:39] know how to say express myself
[1:05:42] but i do know one thing
[1:05:44] i believe without i believe in bride
[1:05:48] but i can look and see where i have not
[1:05:50] been faithful
[1:05:53] or as faithful as i could be to his word
[1:05:57] and i want to be a hundred percent
[1:06:00] in everything
[1:06:03] i really do want to be 100
[1:06:07] i don't want to
[1:06:10] leave this earth without
[1:06:13] pleasing him
[1:06:14] [Music]
[1:06:16] and all of us especially those of us who
[1:06:18] of age
[1:06:19] on us we
[1:06:20] feel the pains of death
[1:06:25] sometimes we feel it just getting up out
[1:06:27] of a chair or sitting down in one
[1:06:30] and we know that our time is close
[1:06:33] whether it be by death or by a rapture
[1:06:36] that's how i'm feeling
[1:06:41] and i don't want to
[1:06:44] be one of those people who assumed
[1:06:47] they had what it would have took and
[1:06:50] then wake up in a region
[1:06:55] of the loss of some sort
[1:06:57] i'm taking it more seriously now than
[1:06:59] i've ever have
[1:07:01] because i realize that the day that
[1:07:03] we're living in and i know that the time
[1:07:05] is so so short
[1:07:08] so much closer than when we first
[1:07:10] believe and
[1:07:12] i trust by god's grace that god will
[1:07:14] envision give us the vision of what
[1:07:16] we're talking about
[1:07:19] but i know one thing
[1:07:21] the lord is not finished with the bride
[1:07:23] she will not go out looking like she's
[1:07:25] looking
[1:07:27] she'll be a real army like ezekiel said
[1:07:30] lord can these dry bones live
[1:07:33] yes
[1:07:34] but prophesy
[1:07:39] there's coming a move and his move is
[1:07:41] already on
[1:07:43] and every
