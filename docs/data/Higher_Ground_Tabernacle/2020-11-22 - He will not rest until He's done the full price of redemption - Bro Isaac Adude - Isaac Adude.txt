opportunity to be in your presence this morning lord it's something that we don't have to pay for it Lord but Lord it's a Grace that we have father lord it's a great privilege father to be found Lord in your because as the prophet says in your presence that's where everything changes Lord Lord he even went farther and he say oh God that he never seen someone going to Calvary and Lord coming back the same Lord there's always something that and Lord here we are father Lord I pray that God that you let every heart father that has not Lord yet be given to you father God Lord let let you father Lord convert them Lord may you talk to the people Lord and you father Lord and you save them Lord Lord at the end of the service father God we will not miss to say Thank you Lord thank for your presence Lord morning father thank for the song service that we had Lord Jesus now we getting ready to to to listen to the word pray father God that you continue to give me dear God take me out of the way speak to your people in Jesus Christ name we amen amen Let's uh open our Bibles in the The Book of Genesis want to chapter 28 we read the verse 15 then after that we go to the book of Isaiah Genesis 28:15 the Bible says and behold I am with thee and I will keep thee in all places where thou goest and will bring thee again into this land for I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of so in other words uh uh that in the middle of this verse you know we can say that the Lord says that he will not rest until he has done that which he has spoken amen it's a great promise that we have that we can lean on let's go to Isaiah chapter 49 we'll read the verse 13 to verse uh 18 Isaiah 49 verse 13 to 18 [Music] the Bible says Sing oh heavens and be joyful o Earth and Break Forth into singing oh Mountains for the Lord has comforted his people and he will have mercy upon his afflicted but Zion said the Lord has forsaken me and my Lord has forgotten me this is my favorite part of the verse of the chapter the Bible says can a woman this is now the Lord talking it says can a woman forget a sucking child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yeah they may forget yet will I not forget the amen verse 16 says behold I have gra I have Graven thee upon the palms of my hands th walls are continually before me thy children shall make haste th destroyers and th and and they that made the waste shall go forth of thee lift up thine eyes round about and behold all this gather themselves together and come to thee as I leave sayth the Lord thou shallal surely close thee with them with them all as with an ornament and bind them on thee as a bride death is you in other words like in in our Christian Life as we leave you know God didn't promise us only the a bed of EAS you know it's it's like Peter who asked Jesus he said Lord we have forsaken our life we have left our husband and our wife what are you going to give us the Lord said that I will give you a hund fold of everything but on top of that I will also give you tribulation they are very important amen uh we may be seated uh this morning uh I do have a message that uh I would try by the grace of God to bring to you that I entitled he will not rest until he's done the full proc of redemption we started with the subject of redemption last time that we preached that the Redemption by Blood and by power so last time we show how you know Redemption had to has has to be you know we focus more on the lamb you know uh to explain how Jesus was the Lamb of God but this morning we will go uh a little bit deeper you know try to show trying to show that all the work that started in the Garden of Eden was not complete until Jesus Christ died on the cross and this message this morning is for you if you believe this quote that I'm about to read the prophet says in the message possessing the Gate of the enemy after trial paragraph 77 and remember if you never was in God's thoughts you'll never be with God how many knows that he was a redeemer well then anything redeemed has to come back where has to come back to where he fell from so if he come if he come to redeem us how could could we was one time didn't have to be redeemed and we were all born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies it shows that the real Christian is an attribute of God's thinking before there was a world or a star or air or anything else the prophet say it's Eternal and he come to redeem us back it's God's thought spoken to a world a word made manifest brought back to his thought so the prophet said that Jesus or God is coming to redeem us before even the was a star in that position that you belong that you first had and the word redeem if we go in the Greek the the the meaning of the the word redeem or to redeem uh it's in the Greek I think it's um EXA something like that I know the pronunciation it's spelled e x a g o r a z o x r g o r r z o but it says that it's buying a slave from from the market and when we go back to the history we go back to that time where we had slaves we see that if a man did something wrong to his master his master will punish him or will put him into death or the master will have to sell him or otherwise that person will be killed you know that that that makes us think about you know about us you know as Jesus as the Bible says that the the you know every every soul that sin shall die meaning that if you did something wrong or you SE the sentence is is a death sentence and G and God made it that way so that nobody else can redeem us but him you know Jesus oh God gave us that sentence of death so that nobody else will be able to buy someone from his death sentence and and and and and and then at that time so if a man is bought from you know from saly he couldn't go back to the he couldn't go back to the market again anymore because it was sealed and that's the same thing with us Christian once being redeemed once being redeemed you can never go back to the devil or that sentence will have no Authority on you you are seal and the prophet says Satan was well Satan will be taken from the earth just exactly like Satan was taken from you Satan cannot bother or he can tempt us but he cannot get a born again Christian for God from the foundation of the world for him and sent Jesus to redeem him and the blood speaks for him how can he seen when he can't be seen you know how can the person who has been redeemed can sin when that sin cannot be is seen by God you know he don't the only thing he hears is your voice he sees your representation that is true but the thing is that we have people who have been in sin for so long they being forgiven by God you know they think like they're still they're still you know that seems see is is still on them you know it's like the the the story that the prophet G gave one time it says that there were there was a cber a bird who was tied by by by his master so he was in that position for so long for many days for many months you know he tried to flee but that couldn't work you know he tried to free himself but he felt like that couldn't work you know it was still but one day someone a kind man passed by you know he freed that bird from that prison but that bird couldn't fly because even though the bird was free you know he still had in his thought he still had in his mind that he was still TI he was still in prison and that is the condition of of many Christians this morning you know though forgiven by Christ you know though Jesus went on Calvary and he died for us you know we still have that thought in us we still our mind is still in prison you know our mind is still because the devil why the devil does is that he will make you do something he will make you sin then he will come now fighing you you know to make you remind you know he will start reminding you of the other thing that you did you know it will make you think that what you did is Unforgiven you can't be forgiven you know he will make you think as if what you did is a death sentence but somehow it's true you know that sin will be a death sentence if you don't confess it you know that sin will be a death sentence or that sin will not be forgiven you know if you don't confess it if you don't go to Calvary you know that sin will still be in you when God will look at you God will be able to see that sin if it's not forgiven but once that sin has been confessed you know once you come to Calvary and then you tell God everything about the sin and that sin has been forgiven that sin is lost you know that sin is gone forever you know that sin cannot be found in God's book you know but though the devil can come to you you know it's like brother Brooks when he preached uh the uh I think uh before before he gone before he gone when he preached last time he said that somebody asked the prophet he said that brother Bram when does God forgive our sin you know if the prophet says that God forgives you the very same moment that you confess your sin so there is no delay there is no no God will forgive me after two days or I have to let this gun you know I have to wait a little bit and then God will forgive no it says that the very same second you know just when you done confessing you know your sin has been forgiven you if we can go a little bit farther just the very same the very same time that you try to open your mouth because God answer us even the thing that we don't say even the thing we we just think you know that just the very same moment that you open your mouth God sees the intention that you have it will show up it will come ready to you know he'll be waiting for you to to get done confess and when you done confessing your sin you know he will forgive you you know Jesus comes to redeem you because you were saved before the beginning of the world you know as we read you know you were in God's thought you know before the before he even created the world you know you had a certain position you know before even a star was created you know God saw you in a certain position but when Adam and Eve when they sin the human race lost their position you know the human race you know lost the position that God saw go that God for you know that you had in God though from that time now from that time you know from that time when the SC the work of redemption was now in progress God God was working the work of redemption we see that he came in the garden you know looking for Adam and Eve you know that's something great with God you know Adam and Eve seen and they hid them themselves from God in other words you know the word say God we don't want you anymore but as the Bible says that God so loved the world God came down looking for Adam and Eve looking for the people who seen even though they didn't want to see God even though they were running away from God but God couldn't rest until Adam and Eve was redem that's the same thing with that the same thing this morning you know you seen you did something wrong and and you feel yourself you know guilty about the thing that you did and and you running away from God the prophet says that a man a sinner you know a sinner always run runs away from God you know that's that's his nature is to run away from God but you know but we have a God who love us so much that even though we try to run away you know he will come you know he will make his way through he will come until it reaches you you know that's why that's why the message this morning is that God will not rest until until you are at his side you know God will not rest until you are saved so he will try to do everything that he can you know he will try to talk to you he will speak to your heart you know he will send people telling you you know you will see dreams you might see Visions you know he will do everything to get you back to him to get you where where he saw you to get you where where you belong you know it's like the go son you know when he left his parents' house that was his own decision you know he took his money and then he's gone but though he was gone you know God was still working with his heart you know it was an experience that he was supposed to have to show him the grace that he had when he was in his father's house you know sometimes we go as straight you know just God just want to show how God just want to show us the grace that we have in him you know sometimes when we sin sometimes when we fall short you know it's just God trying to tell us you know his love for us you know how can you see the love of God if you never seen you know how can you receive the blood of Christ if you never seen how can Calvary have have a meaning for you if you never SE because God didn't die for holy people God didn't die for people God didn't die for people with no sin but God died for the people who sin you know God died for the people who had a death sentence you know espe especially us Gentiles you know if we go back to the Old Testament we were not even allowed to go into the temple you know we couldn't get into the temple but God saw us and he had mercy on on us you know he died for us he redeemed us and not only that he called us his bride and then we are the king and priest of God King and priest is the two highest you know position that you can have but the sad thing is that we forget who we are you know we forget Who We Are and if you forget if you don't know who you are you will never have a power you will never have the authority you know listen because if we take an example of the policeman or the cop doesn't have the power to stop a car you imagine a car driving 100 miles per hour a cop you know sometime you know skinny as I am you know standing there and then you know you think that that cup will have the power to stop that car if the cop only goes by his power he will never stop the car but the cop needs to know who he is and use his authority to stop that car and that's why the prophet said that us as as Christian we don't need power it says because Jesus fought Jesus fought and he won all our battles we don't need to fight anymore that's why we don't need the power but we just need the authority the devil has been won already you know but we just need the authority to remind him of who we are to remind him of the work that was done in Calvary to remind him or to claim the victory that God gave us you know do you see that the perfect lamb had to die so that we dis Ed sinner we may find life you know because the perfect lamb the law required a perfect lamb a lamb with no blemish so that us this figured sinner you know who was condemned to die you know we might find life amen the prophet says um I said uh he went into the belly of of a whale for a man he went down in a fiery furnace to get some of his children out and then he will come down into this gallery or in other words he will come down into this church you know there the officer unbuckling his gun and laying it on the floor and putting his arms around me like that and God miraculously come down so here the prophet if we go back um in this message the prophet is talking about the uh about the general I forgot his name who was a judge he was also a soldier but he was a judge you know when they went down into I think a basement where in the G in the G Gallery of Guns you know that Brother start to talk with the prophet was speaking with the prophet he said brother brandham do you know what I grew up in the church it says that my my my parents you know brought show me the church you know since I was born it says that I never missed a service you know I always was there on time you know I was singing at church you know I still play the the instrument of church you know I have this postor church but they said brother brandham to be honest with you even though I go to church I still feel that there there's something empty inside of me you know I don't know God as I as I am supposed to then he asked the prophet he says that can God save me you know that's why the prophet was saying you know his answer the prophet answered was you know God can do whatever he whatever it takes to save you you know God went down in the belly of the well to say to be with Jonas you know God went down to the Lions you know to the Lions to save to save uh Daniel you know God went down to the to the fiery furnace to save the three Hebrews children and God will come down in this place to save you you know it only takes one thing it's Faith you know if you believe in God you know God will come down to take to save you you know when we think about the the Redemption you know we think about Redemption we see that uh uh uh when when God tell Moses you know to take the children of is is out of out of Egypt and and and Moses when we know that when they went when they came to the desert they spent 40 years in the desert you know sometimes Moses you know was probably wondering or you know this is me saying you know some some of them people was wondering why do we have to spend 40 years here because if we go by the map there were there was a shorter way where they could have you know went and spend for like a week and then get to the promised lande but God made them turn around in the desert for 40 years you know we think that you know it was a curse you know yes for others it was a curse they could didn't make it they died but God was working something was working out something because they say God knew that in the other side of the of the sea you know there was a girl who had to grow up and that took 40 years for the children of Israel to cross over and arriving there you know found Rahab who RAB God prepared you know God you know when they were in the desert it was not easy you know marching on the sand and you know turning turning around you know but all of that was to prepare a a wife or a bride all of that was to work was to work Redemption for someone who was waiting there and we see that when they got there Rahab was redeemed you know Salomon you know married Rahab and then they gave a son boas Boaz in his turn you know Ruth who was somewhere you know God had to stck the land with famine you know to let someone leave that land to go to the land of Moab and God even went farther than that three people had to die you know God killed the two children of of Naomi and her husband you know all of that to save one person you know with that I want to say that God would do everything that he can to save you if you only believe you know if you can only have faith you know God will save you you know Jesus started the work of redemption in the Garden of Eden and he worked that work through the ages but that work was not complete until he died on the cross and the work of the Cross will not be completed until you accept him as a sa you know it's it's like a master who goes and he buys a slave pays for a slave you know the price has been paid but as long as it doesn't claim the slave as his or otherwise as long as the say the slave you know doesn't accept the price that has been paid you know that price means nothing you know Jesus Paid the price for our sins Jesus Paid the price for our Redemption you know the law required blood he shed his blood for us you know he the lamb he died for us he took up place he became a sinner so that we we be saved so the price is already paid but now it's only you you know you have to accept that price that was paid you know you have to come to Christ and say Lord Here I Am Lord Lord Here I Am Lord you know I I have tried it's like Peter who said Lord you know where do you want me to go there is nowhere else that I can go because it's in you that I find life you know the proc has already been paid you know what you have to do is to lay in the presence of the son you know like Ruth you know she had to go she had to lay in the presence you know in the presence of Boaz you know as as nature even nature teaches us that a seed before a seed grows that seed has to be has to lay in the presence of the sun and the sun will make that sea grow and that's the same thing with us we have the seed of God inside of us you know we have the seed of God inside of us and for that seed to be manifested we have to lay in the presence of the son we have to lay a Calvary we have to lay in the presence of Jesus Christ and he will work that seed out so sometimes you worry you said that but look at my sin look at what I have done you know it's so great you know it's it's so many I I can't I can't you know I'm ashamed on myself you know I did something that I don't even want to show up when people are there because they always remind me of what I did you know I shouldn't do this and I'm cursed and I can't be forgiven God doesn't even listen to my prayer you know the prophet says rest that that is Ruth Nomi talking to Ruth it says rest Ruth because the man will have no rest until he's done the full price of redemption amen the prophet said that right there is where I stand amen he will not rest until he's done the full price of redemption to redeem you everything that you ever lost everything that you was you know God will not rest until he sees you at the side so you have to stop worrying you know you have to stop thinking that what you have done is Unforgiven but you can't be forgiven you know you have to stop thinking that your sin is is powerful than God's blood know God if we go let's go to uh Isaiah chapter 1 uh I think it's this one verse 16 to 17 ver verse 16 to verse 18 sorry verse 19 the Bible says wash you and make you clean put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes cease to do evil learn to do well seek judgment relieve the oppressed judge the fatherless plead for the Widow now Verse 18 it says that now come come now and let us reason together sayth the Lord though your sins be as carlet they shall be as white as snow though they be red like Crimson they shall be as wool if you be willing and obedient you shall eat the good of the land if you be willing and obedient the only thing that takes it's your will if you be willing and obedient you know you can come and reason together with Christ you know the prophet used this scripture to preach about to preach about our conference the message conference it says that every time something was wrong in the earth you know God had to have conference with his people God had to had a conference with with his people you know when Adam and Eve they seen you know God had to have a conference with them and what is a conference you know a conference is when we look you know we're trying to find a solution for something you know we see that when there is wars in the world or this nation and that Nation doesn't you know they they can't get together you know they call for a conference you know there's a climate change they call for a conference and that conference you know is to find a solution how to stop that thing you know and and though you know with us human you know they will try to each of us you know each country will try to to show how benefit is it is to to keep doing the same thing [Music] but at the end of the day they will come to one you know one conclusion and that's the same thing that God is saying here in Isaiah chapter 1 verse Verse 18 you know God is saying come you know he's calling you to a conference you know I always say that if for example let's say that the president of the United States you know he calls us for a conference you know we'll be happy even though we we don't like the person but it will do us something you know to to feel like the president has called me for a conf and then we'll go tell the people about that we'll start thinking about that conference let's say if the conference is like next week you know we'll start thinking about that conference today you know you will try to you know to see what which clothes uh will I put on or how am I going to get there you know you will try to get yourself ready but the sad thing is that the Lord of lords you know the all Mighty God he's calling us for a conference but the sad thing is that it's not everybody who answers to that call you know why we love the thing that we do you know we love the sin or the situation that we're in that when God calls us for a conference you know we think that you know it'll take us a lot to for to forsake whatever we're doing to have a life change you know to become a Christian you know you will say that people will mock at us you know people will say that hey this man has changed and it's not you know it's not up to date anymore but let let me tell you that everybody in the Bible or even now who serve Christ you know they always have to go through persecution you know they have to bear they have to to have their own cross because otherwise you won't be worthy to follow Christ you know God will do everything to save you he took a Christian family to back sleep to save to save one person to save Ruth you know it maybe maybe you find yourself in a backl you know you find yourself in a position that you think that you backl you know it's not too late to come back to Christ you know he still has his arm wide open waiting for you it's like that prodigal son when he made up his mind to go back to his parents house you know the thing amazing is that his father saw him from afar and he was standing at the gate waiting for the waiting for his son you know his son was in his way back to his father you know he was thinking about the word you know trying to uh uh fix the word how he would convince his father to get him back but what he didn't know was that his father was waiting for him and that's the same thing with us you know you might think that hey I have to make a beautiful prayer you to be saved I have to be clean or I have to be in a certain place or in a certain position to receive the Holy Spirit you know the prophet says that that doesn't work even himself the prophet you know they say they told him brother BR for you to be saved or to receive the Holy Spirit you know this is how you have to phrase your your prayer you know you have to go to God and say dear Lord and use all the big word that you know it says that that will never work because there is no sincere it in it but a sincere heart tells God everything how it is you're talking to him and you telling him how you feel you know if there's something that you still love that you can't get rid of Lord you know that I love this thing Lord you know that this body always want to look at this you know I still have that desire to go back to it but I don't want to be like that I need your forgiveness then he will forgive you because it takes sincerity amen and and then we see that he took the children of Israel 40 years as we say so that one girl be saved you know he and then it would take everything to get you back to him you know Jesus we see Jesus in the weakest time of his life you know there at the cross when someone came to him he wanted to mock at Jesus then he put a board on top of his head saying that this is the King of the Jews you know that was a mockery for him but what he didn't know is that that same word that he put on top of Jesus head was able to save someone at that very same time you know we look at that that that at the cross you know if we go if we we we go uh through the process of repentance and we try to judge that Thief at the cross you know none of us will say that that if at the cross follow the procedure of repentance because we never seen in the Bible where that of the Cross prayed regretting his sin saying Lord forgive oh Lord I have done evil that if at the cross we never seen him praying for a whole hour for his repentance but what what God looked beyond that God saw their heart God saw the sincerity that was in his heart and therefore God knew his desire Jesus told him that you but this night you be with me and it was the first one you know to go to go tell the all the apost all the the prophets that there's a man coming after me who is going to free you you know that man who did not have who did not do uh he didn't do a long prayer but he just say one word when you will be in that Kingdom remember me that was a sincere prayer that was a sincere request that he did or he made Lord when you will be remember me so it doesn't matter how well your prayer is you know it doesn't matter how you try to phrase things or you try to make it beautiful so that The Neighbor Next to You may not understand everything that you're saying or it doesn't matter how big how many big words you use when you pray what it matters it's a sincerity a sincere heart that can say Lord remember me the sincere heart that can say Lord when you will answer to the prayer of my neighbor Lord Remember Me Lord think about me and when your prayer is sincere you know God he will save you the prophet says that God never separated the bride from the groom he says but remember he went there with you in him see God had never separated the bride from the groom so when God looked down upon the body of Christ he saw both male and female it was all redeemed in that one body they are one same word the same word spoke of the groom that same word speaks of the Bride you know it's it's like in Genesis I think Genesis chapter 3 or 4 when God called Adam and and and Eve you know God called them at the same the same name he say Adam I'm trying to find the verse yeah I can't find it it's somewhere here I can't find it but the prophet says well how can a bride how well how can the Bride come and fail to manifest everything that was promised of him and the groom come and he wouldn't be the bride but when he did everything even to proving it by raising himself up up from the dead then the prophet says that the bride have to do the same thing the bride have to be exactly what the word said she would be in this last days the prophet said the prophet asked a question said don't she have to return through Malachi 4 don't she have to be manifested like it was in the days of Sodom don't the world have to be just exactly like it is it's not this uh it's not these things a perfect identification of the word of God made known to us so in other words if the world condition has to be as God said it was in Sodom and gomorra you know if the Judgment has to stke the Earth you know if that word is true the prophet says that that that means that the bride and God and the bride and the groom or it is it's also true as the bride and the groom are one so now let's let's what the Lord required for Redemption you know we see that before a man could redeem his Lost Property the Bible says that that man had to be the nearest Kinsman and we see that Jesus you know Jesus was made himself our nearest because when we came to the world the devil was our our nearest Kinsman because we looked more like him than we did we look like like Christ because we were a sinner you know we did some wrong stuff and Jesus he was holy so no way we did look like Christ so the devil was our nearest kinsman redeemer but when the question was asked if the if it was able to redeem us it didn't have what it takes to redeem us because it takes someone who can become a sinner who can take your place to redeem you so was no way that the devil can could become a sinner again or there was no way that the devil could make himself another devil there is no way that the devil or Lucifer can can share can shed his blood for you so God you know God came you know he made himself a man he became a sinner you know he took our sins upon him you know he became our nearest Kinsman redeem our nearest Kinsmen so that he can be able to redeem us so therefore when the Devil comes and try to remind you about the thing that you did you know you also have to remind him he said that but the question was asked to you if you were able to redeem me but you were quiet you didn't say a word so therefore you have no you have no authority to come remind me about what I did you know as long as my sins are forgiven you know they're gone forever amen the devil the prophet says that the so the next morning the next morning then he had to make a public testimony he went down and met this man at the gate before the elders and he had to be in a public place and he looked him in the face and can you redeem her now if he had to first uh now if he had to uh now if he had to redeem her he had to redeem first Naomi in order to get Ruth and Christ had to redeem the Jewish the the Jewish church first in order to get the Gentile bride she come in with Naomi as an alien from another country a MOAB heathens that's what we were the Gentiles ethen and remember he had to get Naomi and when he got Naomi he got all that she had remember when Christ come he never spoke of the Gentile church he was going to his own he came to his own his own received him not he was always to the lost sheep of Israel and as you go preach the gospel then that's when he told the the disciples he said that heal the sick ra the Dead cast out Devils freely as you give give freely as you you receive send them two by two and he had to redeem that church and when he redeemed that church he got the Gentile bride amen that was the bargain in it he got the bride when he redeemed the church you know we see that when Jesus came you know the Bible clearly says that came for his own for the je you know even when that lady came to him you know praying asking God to heal her you know Jesus told him that we can never give the bread you know of the children to the dogs you know when he sent the disciple when he sent them at the first time to go preach he sent them to the Jews you know God had to redeem them first before he get to you you know that's why the Bible says Paul says that God had to cut that branch that first Branch the original branch to take another Branch who was from another nature to plug that Branch into the original tree that branch that was planted that is us the Gentiles God created a space for us for us to be saved for us to to re to rec to know him as Christ and that space that he created or that door that he opened it's not forever it will not last forever there's a specific time for that door and that door is closing right now because God has to turn back to the to the Jews you know God has to turn back to his brother you know it's like Joseph you know there at the the kingdom the palace where there was you know when he was about to turn down to to turn uh uh to his to his brother you know he sent his children and his wife to the bedroom and that is the thing that is about to happen you know God is closing the door to the G God is about to turn his back to us and when that that when God turns himself when God turn his back to us there will be no salvation when God turns his back to us to us you know you can cry as as hard as you can or you can cry as loud as you can you will never be saved because there will be no mercy there will be judgment for the rest of the world so now while this door is still open why don't you press into it you know why that door is still open you know there is still a little space you know in that door why don't you go through it you know why don't you come to that door you know why don't you join the others you know there is a joy on the other side of the river a joy on the other side of of the river that can never be compared to this one you know it's like a brother who asked the prophet he says the brother BR are we still going to to to hun squir the prophet said that I don't think when we'll be on the other side we'll be we'll still have that desire to hunt it says compare yourself when you was when you were in your mother's womb you had pleasure being there you were satisfied being there in that little world that you had you thought that that was the best place for you to be but once you came out I'm pretty sure that none of us will will prefer to go back to to to his mother to his mother's wom and that is the same thing with god with with with Heaven you know that is the same thing with the other side of the veil you know it's so beautiful that that that that beauty can never be compared to this beauty that we see here you know he can never he cannot be compared how we're living today today so why don't you make your way to it you know Jesus says that you know I have water free water you know there is a fountain that that has been opened in the House of David who wanted and that Fountain has no price you have nothing to pay you know God says come buy from me with no money and not paying anything you know God wants to save you more than what you want you know God wants to see you at his side so why don't you answer to that call why don't you answer to the call of God the Bible says in Revelation uh chapter 3 verse uh verse 23 or verse3 Revelation 3: 20 the Bible says behold I stand at the door and knock if any hear my voice and open the door I will come to him and will St with him and he with me Jesus is standing at the door the prophet says that Jesus knocking at the door you know he says that he can represent your brother talking to you or a message that you hear at church or a preacher you're preaching something that really touch your heart you know every time that you feel that call it's Jesus knocking at that door and that knock or him knocking at the door it's not forever because if you have a visitor who's trying to ring or knock at the door he has a certain level of patience you know when he knocks and he see that people are not in the in the house he will leave you know he might leave you a message saying that hey I was here but you weren't or you can just go and walk away you know that's the same thing with Jesus you know the patience of Jesus you know has a level has a has a time you know and and and when Jesus is knocking at the door you know you have to run and open that door before it's too late now Jesus is knocking at the door you know if you heard this message this morning and and and you felt in your heart that this is God calling me to to repent you know if you heard this message this morning and you felt like this is God's calling or you ask yourself but Lord why just today or you know why why why am I feeling like this or Lord why am I feeling this burden you know you calling me it's because he wants to save you and Jesus wants to save you more than what more than what you want and as we read Jesus is knocking at the door you know he didn't rest until Ruth was redeemed he didn't rest until RAB was saved and he will not rest you are saved so God will pursue you God will do everything you know every work that it takes for him to save you but don't step on what God is saying what the work of God you know don't don't don't make it feel like God is doing oh God's work is in vain because you will regret you know uh go God is here knocking at the door you know if someone hear his voice God is willing to come in and soap with you just if you want to you know we read it the Bible says that if you're willing you know God is more than welcome know he's been standing at the door for so long you know two 2,000 years ago you know the price has been paid and God wants you to receive him as your personal savior stand when we sing set your wings the wings of Faith you know God is here and God wants to save you more than what you want and if you feel like God God God was talking to you this morning you know right where you are you
