TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen you love the Lord surely God is good to us amen not prolonging the time glad to see everybody here this morning I hope you are as happy as I am amen might not be showing it from the outside but inside there's a real fire going on Hallelujah Lord amen you love God Amen surely without him where would we be now let's turn by the grace of God to St John 1 we're going to be uh going through some scripture here by the grace of God and uh we trust that you're blessed here this morning uh I I didn't come uh uh to be seen of myself amen but if we could uh move back the flesh amen and and see the Lord Jesus here hallu this morning I Believe by the grace of God that we are in what we would call a transition amen God is uh is changing us from glory to glory and uh it is the Lord's doing amen because no man can add one cubic to his statue amen so we're going to ask that you read with us St John 114 St John 114 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth is that all right we're going to ask with that you turn with us also to 2 Corinthians I am so glad that these things that we trust to uh become has already been settled hallelu by God before the foundation of the world yeah we're not here to impress him we're just here to obey him amen 2 Corinthians 3 beginning at the 16th verse nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord amen in other words you are changed from glory to glory by the same spirit amen you love the Lord let us pray Heavenly Father God we come before you Lord as humbly as we know how and we thank you Father for being so real to us amen we bind every Spirit every thought that would exalt itself against the word Lord we place these things under our feet and we pray here this morning Lord that you have preeminence here this morning in Jesus Christ's name we commit this service into your hands Lord in Jesus Christ name we pray amen you may be seated amen we thank God for God for being so real to us amen God has been more gracious to us than we can imagine we find out amen that he loved us so much that he came to Earth himself amen he didn't send his secretary or his his uh uh uh uh uh General he came himself and uh we realize by the grace of God that uh we have ministered many times on uh eternal security and and there is a sec eternal security and uh but it's hard for people Amen to really grasp that God never told you to grasp it he told you believe it amen because really you you find out amen that when God does a he's a perfectionist he doesn't do anything hazly in other words when he died on Calvary he was not hoping that somebody would have pity a and believe his gospel God had already ordained that he he knew those who would believe the gospel he went on to say that my sheep heareth my voice and a stranger they will not follow now I I'm working with something here this morning because I I I saw some things that the prophet of God said that really uh spark a fire in me and I'm going to be working with character amen and I'm going to be working with the Bible characters amen so that you can identify this morning whose side you're on Amen thank you Lord because the Bible tells us who we are amen every seed should bring forth of his kind you either a a Jacob or you're an Esau hello amen you're either a Saul or David but you know the thing that I want you to understand is that we are um how could I say we're under surveillance we're literally being watched every moment of the day Lord by the allseeing eye who is God himself than you Lord and you know we we fail to see that we have photographers or let me put it this way a photographer that are literally filming and screaming our Our Lives amen there are flashes going on in the Unseen World that you can't see but God is always taking pictures and snapshots and filming did y'all know that amen the prophet of God said at the day of judgment you and I won't have to worry about anything because your life will Flash and be seen on the canopy of Heaven in other words everybody will be able to see if you're not covered by the blood amen your whole life amen there will not be uh uh uh anybody to stand uh put it this way and say Lord I didn't do it because right now you're being filmed amen your thoughts are being caught and and and all of these things will be sounded out at the day of judgment Hallelujah now I I want to read a scripture coming out of Isaiah 25 and I I'm saying these things because I can appear to be something to you uh in your thoughts uh I can be a good character but but but it's not about what you think about me amen it's about what God thinks about me and what God thinks about you amen now we're living in a time we're not dealing or should not be dealing amen with just children amen we are in an age where we must come to maturity amen so we are in a transition perhaps I could say it like this from adolescence to adulthood but nevertheless when he shall come we must stand in adulthood amen now you don't have to amen this but I'mma Bring It Anyway now we are looking at a time uh and and where you and I uh must be very very watchful unto prayer and supplication but but I want you to secure something here with those who can believe uh Isaiah 25 beginning at the 8th verse he will swallow up death in Victory and the Lord God will wipe away tears from all our faces and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from all of the Earth for the Lord ha spoken it amen and it shall be said in that day low This Is Our God we have waited for him amen and he will save us now you might not understand what I'm saying right now but the Bible tells us that in our patience possess ye our souls amen you know we would love amen many times I I could recall being a youngster wanting to be a man right even though the potential in me was there to grow up to be this man but you know as a little teenager we wanted to be a man right we wanted to be able to you know shap the grow the mustache and grow the beard and all of these things I can remember when I first got a little shadow of something H HH on my face and and this man uh basically said you think you grown and he shaved it off my face and I was upset I was upset because that was my first little sign of of my transition from just being a child to to growing into to adolescence and I was really proud of it but you see it wasn't the hair on my face that was bringing me into this new position it was literally the character it was what uh changing in other words I I I I I I no longer found joy in playing with little fire trucks I no longer found joy Amen in in playing jump rope or whatever I was doing Marbles and you know those kind of kitty games I was growing up and and the young the the the little girls that used to be my enemies has now changed amen something in my my mind began to make me look at them in such a different way am I the only ones amen so we realize amen that when this transition when God began to change you and and you you understand that you are really being watched amen by The tutorer Who is the holy spirit it will cause you to govern your life a little different amen amen but see you must realize amen that that that God just didn't give you something to just uh hope foru it goes beyond hope amen it's Faith amen and faith is greater than hope amen because faith is a revelation and and once you it is revealed to you your destiny amen hallelujah you press toward that Mark amen now he goes on to said and and he will save us this is the Lord we have waited for him and we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation amen now I think a lot of times people fail to see really what salvation is and this is why they struggle so much because people think that your salvation is conditional if you do good to God God will do good to you well I'm here to tell you that if that's your concept of salvation you still yet to be saved amen because it is not what you do for him it is what he has already done for you amen salvation if you got salvation it'll take away your little struggles of trying to impress God amen amen amen Eli taught those bear worshippers something because they were trying to impress their God go cut yourself go scream go holler go do whatever you do all these emotional things and perhaps your God will show up well but but but but but Elijah didn't do all of that while he was teaching them all of these things that they should do he says maybe your God is on vacation maybe he sleep you got to do something to get his attention but not with God Amen all Elijah had to do was build the altar amen He restored the Altar and that's what you got to do in your life restore the altar amen He restored the altar He restored the sacrifice and he said let the god that be God let him answer by fire amen and we find out by the grace of God why these bites and whatever they were doing worshiping and doing all of these cuttings and all of these emotional things trying to get their God's attention you know what he never showed up but when B when when Elijah set the altar restored amen the can I say it like this the the sacrifice of the seven Church ages and he pulled water all over amen he drenched the whole thing down with water and he called on the name of the Lord and the Bible tells me that God came down with fire and licked up the whole thing see it wasn't in what Elijah oh it wasn't in all the emotional things it was in the faith of restored altar sacrifice amen restore come on somebody that's what Elijah come to do he came to restore what the faith that you and I could have faith in it now we look at this thing because we find out that so many people amen have this let's move on but we we realize by the grace of God Amen that you and I must recognize what God is doing for us and as I said right now he's taking your picture you're being filmed coming from the message sing man's filter he says check out your desires what you want really in life check what you're fighting for check what you're here for check what you go to church for what makes you it's good to go to church but don't just don't just go to church only that won't save you see just check just a few minutes it say it's my objective what kind of a filter I'm drawing through anyhow if you won't cope with the word of God and your soul don't do it then there's something wrong amen for it shows up your taste that the life what kind of a life is in you if it's a holy discreet honorable it comes out that way if it isn't you've got another taste in you drawing from right so you and I must check everything what are we here for what is the purpose for us coming why do we come to make sure the preacher is saying it exactly right or are we there amen like like like the scripture said if we could just remove the veil amen we'll be able to see the glory of the Lord amen come on somebody hallelujah amen because men make mistakes but God never makes one amen Lord y'all hear what I'm saying so we look at this thing and you and I must understand that our character is now being looked at our character is being watched cameras are are flashing right now you can't even see it but it's happening y'all look at me crazy but I've got some quotes in and I've got some scripture but I want you to realize amen that I is important in this age right now to be obedient to the word of God because because that's what real character is amen the character of Christ is obeying his word amen amen turn with me to First Samuel please did you know this the prophet of God said that there's a time then I've got to quote but there's a Time that brother that that that God just stopped not that he completely stopped but he stopped doing Miracles am among his disciples and he began to teach them and he said except a man eat my flesh and drink my blood they have no part of me but you see we we want to see it all the time sometime God don't do things like that around you because he's trying to teach you something amen and you see if you are all you're doing is following Miracles first of all you shouldn't follow them they should follow you when God began to teach you he kind of settles you down and he telling you something that you need to know and he said except you drink my blood and eat my flesh and you say well the church is going dead now because I don't see nothing moving well the word is and the word is trying to teach you you know when you're a child all you want to do is have fun but now this is a serious time and he trying to teach you something except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part in me and the Bible said 70 turn hello and that's what people are doing I don't see all these great things happening so they turn for Sensations amen and God is trying to mature you amen hey somebody I'm going to say Amen anyway 1 Samuel 15:20 amen you love the Lord because God is trying to bring us to a place you and I don't have to worry about the uh miraculous per se because if God is in you it's going to follow anyway 1 Samuel 15:20 and Saul said unto Samuel y I have obeyed the voice of the Lord and have gone the way which the Lord sent me and have brought AGI gag the king of amalec and have utterly destroyed the amalekites but the people took of the spoil sheep and oxen the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in gilar and Samuel said have the Lord as great Delight in burnt offering and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord see God don't care even how you amen worship hallelujah praise him see that means nothing to God what means more to God is your living the life amen oh come on now Leo theia can worship in that way better than all of us amen but they're dead and don't even know it amen behold to obey is better than sacrifice amen and to hearken than the fat of Rams for Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry because thou has rejected the word of the Lord he have also rejected thee from being King so here was Saul aen a was a king amen and all he had to do was obey destroy the king destroy all animals and every else but he thought he had he thought he had a better way of doing it see let me say it like this that's why I've been dealing with the thoughts your thoughts must line up to God's thoughts and God's thoughts is God's word hello somebody if we could realize what a prophet is a prophet is one who could take God's thoughts catch them thoughts and put them down for the people amen lay them out the pages you see that's how the Bible see the Bible the thoughts of God had already gone out before there was ever a written word hello amen and and and and those prophets couldn't add they couldn't just Implement what they thought God meant they had to write it down just like God said amen that's what makes the word infallible amen because it's not the thought of man but it's the thought of God and God as I said last week could not even reveal himself in this day until there was a prophet born amen that's the only way he can do it not by a priest not by a pope come on not by a bishop or some potentate it has to be a prophet and so therefore God sent us a prophet with this thoughts that we might understand salvation amen oh God have mercy on us now we look at this thing and and and here Saul thought that he could uh uh uh do you know he's King and and you got to be careful oh I'm bride no you've got to be careful Amen on how you handle this word because amen you can't allow uh uh popularity or whatever to to influence you because that's what happened to uh uh Saul uh he uh feared the people and so therefore he allowed himself to slip now watch this because he had truly forgotten and he comes along and says but I have done what God told me to do and and the Samuel say well if that be the truth then what is this bleeding out he in my ear what ises this sound come on if you have done what you God has told you to do then why is your life R why is your life still making sounds that it shouldn't be making amen it amen hallelujah hello amen Philippians please Philippians 2 beginning at the 13th verse now I want you to realize this I used to have a a a person there used to be a person even Among Us that always said well brother y'all don't worship y'all don't do this y'all don't do that and I had never seen him move clap his hand or even shout hallelujah y'all know why I'm bringing is out because none of you should complain about worship amen if you're not worshiping I don't want to hear it amen hello I don't want to hear it because if if worship is needed here then you be the example amen hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying oh they so quiet well you don't have to be they might be but you don't have to be right and let me put it this way it doesn't take but one match Amen to start a fire yes sir I thought I'd throw that in that's free Philippians 2 y'all want me to teach this morning so I guess that's the way I go that's how you're pulling amen so Philippians 2:13 for it is God which worketh in you both to Will and and to do of his good pleasure y'all agreed amen 14th verse do all things without murmuring and disputing amen I'm going read that one again do all things without murmuring and disputing that you may be blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation among whom ye shine as lights Amen in the world Amen hello somebody Lord amen so here it is God is to do a work in you he it is his pleasure to work it out in you amen and you and I must realize amen that there is a what they call Growing Pains amen you got to grow up amen is that all right you got to grow up but in order to grow up there must be something you growing up into amen there must be an image there laying before you so that you can see it have you ever seen those uh little commercials or or you ever seen your child imitate you right you bite off your sandwich he bites off his you cross your leg he cross is his what is he doing he's he's imitating you he's he's looking at you and and thinking Perhaps it is mine I'm like Daddy is that all right amen amen uh uh Troy's little boy uh you know he he so much like that you know he oh I could remember when he got his glasses he was so proud I got glasses like Daddy I mean he he loves his he he walks in the very image and likeness of his father amen see there's something about that and listen when it comes to the children of God you know it's ought to be something on the inside of you that that hunger and thirst after being just like him amen I can't put it in you it's got to be something born in you something birthed into you a revelation that you you're looking at because his son looks at him Troy's son Jo looks at him and and and try look where he's at now back there with his daddy you see you know because there's something in him that makes him want to be like his daddy amen and there ought to be something on the inside that makes you want to be like him amen amen hallelujah you like that amen oh so let's look at this thing here Malachi please three is that all right just bear with me here Malachi 3 because here we we're talking about character I don't I like I said I'm tired of me I done seen enough of me you know the only thing I want to see is him Hallelujah right it disappoints me when me show up amen all I want to see is Jesus I don't care to live anymore all I want is him to live in me if that makes sense to you I don't have it rights hallelujah amen I fulfilled all of my rights all of my thinking all of my welfare all of my my my adventures and all of the things that I want to achieve in this life means nothing like Paul said I counted all D amen what somebody just took the picture there was a flash that went on caught you on the camera amen and whatever you were thinking at this time God got it amen hallu Malachi 3 y'all y'all think I'm crazy but I got something for you Malachi 3 amen 1617 amen because you're coming up to a time we're living in the very last minutes of this time amen really time is ended and we're now living at a time right now you're going to be put to the test am what this thing that's happening right here now it's going to show whether you was getting something or not amen amen y y'all hear what I'm saying it's going to show whether you're getting something or not because whatever in you will be made manifest you can call it to squeeze call it whatever you want to but it's coming amen hallelujah that's right if you're going to when I look at these things and I say it to you by the grace of God if you going to want to see something take place amen listen let me put it this way you be the leader amen right Hallelujah y'all know I worship hallelujah amen Malachi 3 16-1 17 listen because you know we we look at this situation and I want you to understand this because am mean we're looking at a time where where you know it's hard to get people just to talk about God I'm talking about Christians but they don't mind talking about e and everything else but when it comes to talking about the about God you know the Lord Jesus let me put it this way everybody say God I'm talking about the Lord Jesus talking about what God is doing and and what he's doing in my life and how I see changes being made in my life Lord all right I'm I'm just trying to lay a foundation here this morning am mean so you can see that God is looking at you and he's recording every moment of your conversation amen Brother Rich and I were talking the other day and a lot of times people want to be great you know great ministry I don't have a great ministry the only Ministry I got is his I'm not trying to build an Empire or something wrapped around my character around me period it's about his character it's about him but sometime people get this that it it you know I don't know how you put it but they they they they got to it's got to be them and others but no it's him and others amen but listen when we talk about the Lord it makes us recognize how frail and how small we are and how great he is Malachi amen 3 and 16 then then they that fear the lord speak often one to another and the Lord hearkened and heard it they th those people that fear God they reverence him they fear Him they respect him and they talk about him and they hearken and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that fear the lord a book of remembrance you don't believe that's true it's true amen the word of God came to the house of K and said listen Kus your prayers have gone up before God like a as a memorial amen W you got a big you got a big something up in heaven amen you've been praying amen listen and God remembered him Hallelujah and because of K's prayers his whole house was saved amen thank you Lord One Moment One Time One Shot amen word of God fell and they heard the word they already ready already prayed up already broke through and here was God right on the scene God remembering pass a lot of Jews and went to a gentile yes amen listen and they shall be mine say the Lord of hosts in that day when I make up my jewels and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not I'm getting ready to bring something here because I want you to realize amen you're in the book amen I don't care if you're a positive or negative you're in there yes Hallelujah this is The Book of Life amen and everybody's in there almost now brother B said there are some people who names were not even in the book of life and I don't understand that but that's what he said is that all right Corinthians please that let's read that please go back to Second Corinthians I think we need to go there you love God life is a hard thing this world's life is that right it's so hard Paul said oh Wretched Man that I am oh troubled and tried man that I am who's going to deliver me from this body of death your body is the enemy of God Amen ain't nothing good about your flesh it's condemned and is there to hinder your progress Hallelujah but my God it cannot hinder amen cuz if God has spoken it's already done come on somebody it's amazing because we might look at somebody by the by Thomas and say you know Thomas you're a doubter why you always doubt man you're so negative glory to God but who did God reveal himself to amen he walked right through the door see you got to realize it's at the end that we're looking at it's the end of our Salvation it's the end of our Salvation we look at not in the middle not in between not at just the beginning it's the end of it it's what we are at the enden that's what God sees amen he took a photograph of you and your Perfection amen and he's looking at that photograph right now Lord see he ain't looking at what you're looking like now you all marred up and maybe hadn't come completely out of the dark room yet but God has a perfect picture of you amen and nothing can change it Hallelujah his mind about what he sees 2 Corinthians 3:17 this is not a hope salvation I hope I'm saved this is a no so salvation and only those whose name was written WR in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world will be there as bride is that right 2 Corinthians 3:17 the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is I'm going read it again there is Liberty but we are with open faces or open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord now come on somebody what are we looking at the glory of the Lord amen what was the glory of the Lord in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and that word became flesh and dwelt Among Us come on somebody that is the glory of the Lord the glory of the Lord is Revelations 5 Hallelujah when John said who is worthy amen the angel said who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof the Bible said no man was worthy to loose come on somebody but the Bible tell John John Don't You Weep there's only one Hallelujah and it is the lion of the tribe of Judah and the Bible said that John turned to look and he saw a lamb as it had been slain before the foundation of the world that's the glory of the Lord hallelujah that God could take a child amen a man in his own image raise him up as a man slaughter him like a lamb and he become king of kings Lord of lords Hallelujah amen that's the glory the glory of the Lord is you amen that God could take such a sinner like you and me and transform it Glory Hallelujah change it from the inside out not patch it up and make it some look like some uh clown suit amen it's really a new garment Hallelujah a new person on the inside of you living Christ life through you you looking at it you say okay what is the glass brother bandom talks about it in the identification he said there was a young boy who had never seen a looking glass or a mirror so he goes to one of his relatives houses and up the stairs on the door there was a mirror and as the young boy climbs up the stairs see a lot of us we don't understand there was one time people didn't even own mirrors they were so poor and so backwards they had never seen seen one and this little boy was one of those fellas who had never seen a mirror and as he goes up the stairs he sees another little boy coming in view right as he goes up the stairs as he goes up the stairs amen as he's transitioning as he goes up the stairs he sees aen a a little fella amen all of a sudden he raised his hand and the fell in the mirror raised his hand and you know he he he he does other little things and all of a sudden he says mama that's me amen hallelujah he said and he stopped and looked at the little boy he was waved at him and he waved back at him he kept getting closer and closer watching the little fellow first thing he reached out his hand he looked around and his parents and watching him they were watching him because he'd never seen a mirror before that's so that's me so just wonder today if we could look in the Bible and say that's me now here I am looking into the Bible he didn't say no other book amen he said looking into the Bible and saying that's me I can remember when I first said that to somebody they thought I was crazy I say God woke me up and told me this is me amen hallelujah I know you might not understand it and neither do I but I believe what he says maybe your God don't talk to you but he talks to me amen he said this me yes amen when I need help and strength I go to the Rock am as we wonder which one is it which character in The Bible would look we would look like see there I'm coming now which character in the Bible you and I would look like see that's your identification there's only two kinds serpent seed and God's seed amen come on somebody and when you look into that word it shows you which character you are amen see our character molds us and that's coming from the same message identification 1964 our character molds us to the image of what we are amen our character of life that's in us that's why you can try you can practice you can do all you want to do amen but if God ain't in you it's going to reveal itself amen it's going to show its true colors because the only way that Christ's character can be seen through you and the only way it can mold you it's got to be in there first amen amen come on little somebody now you take a little germ of life and if that germ of corn it'll produce corn see the life that's in it molds the character of it then you it's the truth you can plant a corn tree and you can plant a different a stock of corn and wheat amen you never see that corn trying to be wheat and you'll never see that wheat trying to be corn what's ever in that seed is going to make it is no matter where it is it could be in India it could be Alaska South America if you can grow corn it's going to produce corn no matter where you're located it makes no difference because the power is in the seed hello what we are how we walk no matter what we say our Li speaks louder than our words does amen if we might say I am a believer in God well do you believe all the Bible Well I don't know then you see your lips your very lips is speaking louder than what you your words would be if you say I'm a Christian and do not believe in doing or believe I can that God said is true then the very the life any kind of life after that see your life speaks louder than what your testimony does and you know the one of the greatest hindrances of the Church of God amen has been the Bootleggers the gamblers them people are see we all know which way they're headed and they know themselves but the fellow that professes to be a Christian the woman that professes to be a Christian and them live some live something different it's the greatest stumbling block that's outside the world has got there is the outside world anywhere it's worse than anything the world can produce is a person that's supposed to be a Christian and they live something else different from that lying stealing cheating and doing things that he ought not to do is a discredit to his testimony and when you take people that do these those things there our character is molded in there by the light that is in US y'all better say Amen to god let's go back to Revelation 5 I quoted it but let's go back to Revelation 5 huh none of us want to do wrong but now is the time to make it right hello Revelation 5:2 and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof you see that's why God gives you the Holy Ghost right the Holy Ghost will lead you and guide you into all truth and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look their own now my thing is where do we where do we get this arrogance from this this this pride of thinking that you you got something somebody nobody listen if you got the Holy Ghost and I got the Holy Ghost I got just as much God as you amenu y'all hear what I'm saying now the point is no man was worthy that means if without the lamb taking the book we all would have been lost amen I don't care how how righteously you think you're living how righteously you thought you lived without the lamb you're lost without the blood you're lost people say well we don't need the blood maybe you don't but I need it even if it's just to get the life out of it am amen now we look at this thing and let me say it like this you see religion is something that we've all had for a long time and that has been the problem of the mess message people are so religious but they don't know how to love one another they don't know how to fellowship with one another come on somebody you don't have to say Amen the word speaks for itself amen oh yeah this is not a Hallelujah message but I stayed in the presence of the Lord yesterday amen so I want you to understand by the grace of God when we look at this thing you and I must understand amen it doesn't matter whether you belong to this little assembly that's not important the most important part is that you belong to the body of Christ amen huh is that right hallu there ain't no difference between us if we're truly Born Again Believers I don't care if you're black yellow white porket out striped or purple there's no difference between you and me hello I look at some of y'all I tell you what I hope God is not Discerning your thoughts in the way I am now God loves to love to the world and God is love and when God projected himself to the world to save the world there could be nothing else but Sovereign Grace to produce a savior in other words you didn't even do anything to produce a savior Lord it was God's Sovereign Grace he decided to do it Hallelujah when God's love see when God loves something has to operate and God so loved the world that the divine Savior appeared let me put it this way don't you realize because you have accepted the Gospel of Jesus Christ you are the very thought of God made manifest every everything he spoke must materialize it's not it cannot come back void it has to materialize whether today tomorrow but it must come into existence as he spoke it so if God spoke Bride on your behalf there is nothing in the elements of this life or this world that can stop it from materializing oh now in the day that we're living in all day we were born Sons and Daughters of God we are offspring of God and being offspring of God there's something about us that believe God there's something in you that calls for something and today to satisfy that longing in our heart many times we try to satisfy with education we try to satisfy with denomination we try to satisfy with f f f uh fantasies sorry fantastic excuse me we try to satisfy it with one thing and listen the point is you can't satisfy that other than with God amen amen Satan has caged in the human race and as I was studying and thought about it this world because you know I I have a close friend of mine who lives in West Virginia and she has always told me that you know that I'm in bondage because of the way we believe because the way we dress because of the way we act she's supposed to be a Christian too but she look at the women and they can't wear makeup and you know cut their hair and do all and she says that's just bondage you know and I I say this by the grace of God Amen then if if then what is freedom because in 1963 around that time you had the hippies the yippies and whatever more coming out saying that we want to be free we're tired of morals and laws we want to behave the way we want to behave and they did it just like that they thought they were literally coming out from bondage into freedom and all they were doing is moving in a transition from one slave to another at one time God was their Master but now they chose for Satan to be their Master they ended up being engaged into slavy and immorality and drugs became their gods come on somebody and they called that Liberty then Hollywood came in to wash to brainwash them and now they become uh uh uh television addicts and and movie star addicts and addicted amen come on somebody addicted to movies and stars and and yet they're free come on some they're not free amen and their masters are demons out of hell amen but they chose that over God Amen and so is it today come on somebody oh yeah they protested in the 60s they wanted to be free from morals in the church and and they were freed and they became slaves to sex and morality and drugs is that right now they're prisoners of Hollywood and demons that comes with it y'all don't believe that but it's true that television brainwashed more people than anything in the world and are you going to church to be rainwash yes I'm going to church to be brainwashed Washed by the word hallu well you let the devil make you think you free look at all the slaves you say they're not slaves amen here it was you had what that Midnight Man is what they call it Black Friday cold cold freezing cold out there and they're waiting because they become technological slaves slaves to te technology I got a iPhone 3 I need a iPhone 4 and I got a iPhone 4 and I need a iPhone 5 nonsense but they're slaves to it spending their money when they don't have money to spend come on somebody why these old ignorant Rises around here amen sitting in church Lo learning about God maturing in the Lord while the world is gone for their Fantastics maturing understanding that the fire that's getting ready to come is going to burn it all up maturing to the fact that this is not our world this is not our home and therefore I don't seek a home in this land amen maturing character of Christ Christ knowing the purpose for which we came they said Jesus are you a king he said but thou sayth th King and for this purpose came I into the world to do what bear witness to the truth amen the purpose for which you've come into this world is to Bear witness to the truth how you going to Bear witness to the truth you got to have truth in you that's right amen is that right and you and I know that the character of God is Christ you how are we going to say we've got God God listen there's so many people that religious around here I mean everywhere you go everywhere everywhere I've gone you know and there's nothing and I'm going to say like this there's nothing like going around message people who thinkk they God at all and everywhere I go there's always somebody trying to tell you something something that's not even scriptural but they they feel like they obligated to tell you because they're right that has been the that has been the downfall of Christianity cuz every organization and denomination think they're right hello the Bible tells us like this there were seven women and none were found faithful and the woman types out the church hello amen it listen you must understand because we were born of a woman we have a body called death and the only way that you going to escape this body is that you be born by a man Hallelujah and that man is Jesus Christ himself Hallelujah that was the process that it was supposed to be in the beginning it was Adam who was supposed to speak amen amen and bring forth a birth come on somebody hallelujah amen to be born of the man Christ Jesus is the one who will you will escape this body of sin and death it must come a perfect nature I'm almost done because y this is what y'all pulling for listen we come to this place and you and I must understand it took a perfect nature you and I don't have a perfect nature we're flawed that's why Paul said it's a body of death remember I I read you that quote last week where brother Bram said he was the perversion right he's the perversion he was the one amen you and I were born of sin bodies Jesus Christ was not amen he said he had to die but Jesus never did amen see listen you and I must understand amen by the grace of God Amen that we are the perversion we were born of a woman we've got sin in this old flesh we got a we got something that's on the inside of us that don't want don't want to do right it is your arch enemy it ain't the devil is you amen you the enemy of yourself come on somebody the greatest enemy if you didn't have this man Satan couldn't move you right now the devil listen your body don't want you to reflect God your body don't want you to reflect God your body listen your body wants to do the things that are of the world but it is the inner man that God is looking at amen it is the nature that he's put into you come on somebody I remember when I was there in in in Africa and you know I had a a little uh Cub Pat her and everything her little Sarah you know she was a little cute little cub and her parents were she was found out in the in the in the wilderness and she was on the game W you know he he took her in and you know she was cute when she was a kitty but a few years later she was no longer a kitty she was a lioness I wasn't about to go Pat Sarah y'all understand what I mean we went walking Sarah with this little stick and the whole time I never thought about how when she was a kitty her nature had changed amen she's now a lion is she she might look similar but now she's bigger you know she's got a different uh perspective of life and she's now become a a hunter back in that day we had to feed her but now she's become a hunter and guess what she hunts so my point is listen listen people of God you y'all better be careful you better be careful you know we look at these things and you say you you might say well I know all of this you don't know all of this because if you knew all of this God wouldn't be speaking it amen that's right amen that attitude caught God now let me say it like this you and I must recognize amen that God Amen is in the midst of this place it might seem simple but I can tell you now only a small percentag is catching what I'm trying to say Amen we have allowed Satan to make us think we we've arrived and you haven't Lord there's a there's a maturing amen I'm going tell you like this if you think in your mind that if somebody came in here with a machine gun to kill you that you'll be able to stand and you've got to recognize you'll be put to the test remember the prophet of God spoke of message there's a man who could turn on the light Hallelujah and in that message he tells us how the World Council of churches are going to throw us into darkness he said just like that it'll come upon you he said that little girl who was screaming represented the bride should I read you the quote should I read you the quote that little girl that was screaming amen represented the bride cuz she was scared and that little boy said oh little sister amen Don't Be Afraid amen there's a man who could turn on the lights he said even at that point if you recognize the message to be right he said you're too late amen you're too late and we can sit up here let me say it like this these words that are being spoken to us this morning you're going to be a accountable for what you've heard this morning amen God ain't concerned about your tradition he ain't concerned about your habits and your ways and the oh come on somebody he's looking at character amen if the character of Christ is not in you when he return you will not go with him how you going to get it you got to go through some fire amen you got to go through some trial but most of all see I used to be a runner and you got to have a goal you got to have something fixed and when I I used to be a cross country one you got to have your timing set right you can't just run because you want to run you know you can't you don't start off with all that you got you got to pace yourself and know what you're working with come on somebody amen and so it is but you have a goal you know the the length of the run and you have a goal that you're pressing toward amen people of God you got to have a goalen in your heart and in your mind and you can't let God stop until it's completely finished in you Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying let me put it this way for most of the people and I'm not bragging but I say like this I probably don't seen the pillar of five more than most of you I don't seen the pill of cloud I don't seen the dead raised I've seen cancer healed I didn't ask for it I was just there in the right place at the right time but I'm not I'm not stupid Israel saw all the Miracles of Egypt huh and only two of them were saved amen why because they kept the right mental attitude toward the word am hello somebody amen listen I don't care it doesn't matter how much you've seen is whether you keep the right middle of attitude oh my the nature of God on the inside amen is not one who looks at others as if you listen and this is I know I'm I'm I'm feeling it right you know we look at this thing we say well you know uh I I this is what I love brother Brandon for one of the reason he he loved everybody even his enemies and it was more than lip service it was action you can't tell me you love me and there is no action there's no signs of you loving me yet you love me what Jesus Christ God loved me so much he sacrificed he didn't just leave it on the pages he came down and proved his love love proves itself oh come on somebody amen is that right listen the only way that you'll ever be able to express God's word that you believe it and watch it act behind you you have to have the sinless nature that comes from God Amen sinless nature am that comes from God that's out of in ident ification you the sinless nature not your nature amen you see that's the way I am yeah that's the problem the way you are the way you are got to die amen hallelujah his thoughts as I say is a Christian today is that right can I ask you a question when God thought about Moses what was his thoughts when amram and yoseth had Moses they knew he was a proper child somehow God revealed that cuz looking at a little baby in the crib you would never know it somehow God revealed that right probably with a pillar of fire or something like he normally does and here was Moses and Pharaoh's house being raised as an Egyptian it would have looked like it was not going to work whatever God thought about Moses it ain't happening hello God is here on the right side and Moses way on the left hand learn all the Egyptian ways brother B said he was a scholar probably M Magnum Kum he was up there he was teaching the teach us like Jesus on and it would have looked like it wasn't going to happen but God's thought about Moses amen was that he was to to deliver the children of Israel so Moses believed his mama his mama told him the story according to the prophet is that right and we find out that Moses thought that he could do it on his own human ability like some of us think you can change your character on your own human ability and the only thing that you're going to ever produce is a dead man amen this is not psychology and so what happens am he he produces a dead man but listen it was all set up Hallelujah God knew that he needed Moses out there in the wilderness Amen Let me put it this way so when tragical things happen to your in your life it's set up amen God set it up to get your attention Hallelujah it was the only way he Moses full attention amen he first had to strip him from his pride amen strip him of his knowledge go come on somebody he had to strip Moses he didn't leave nothing on Moses by the time Moses got up on the mountain he said take them shoes off even to his shoes take off your shoes the ground you standing on is Holy he had to strip him and let me tell you something if you be SE God will strip you from all of your ways no matter what it takes God's will be done amen his mind toward you come on somebody I'm coming here amen cuz I want you to understand you can all we can be uh like Samuel who who said now listen Saul you did not do all that God said because I can see and this is what I'm working with right now you saying you've done all that God say but I can see I hear I see and what is this that I hear and see you have not killed everything amen and God don't want those sacrifices that you offered he wants obedience Hallelujah come on somebody now you can be amen like those who were at Simon's house Simon invited Jesus and we all invite Jesus to church and sometimes I I tell you one thing y'all it's it's a shame that we do god like that if we were sitting up out at a ball game we'll be screaming and holler and singing and shouting and laughing and everything else amen because of the activities going on the field but when you set up in church and you sit still Lord you sit still amen because amen listen now some of us are not emotionally like that but listen if you can go out there and scream at a a game watch a television program amen and get all upet and and don't say you don't do it you do it I mean and get all excited it rather amen and then you come to church and the word of God is just oh you know but let me put it this way Samuel said you didn't kill everything we can be like uh Simon house and and and and inviting Jesus and there's only one person coming to church see that's all that God matters there was one lady who came to church to have church amen she could care less about what anybody else said she screamed she CRI she snotted she wiped his feet she washed his feet she could care less about all her surroundings and see that's the problem we all waiting to see if so and so move then if he move you move or she mov you move that's wrong that's not the true spirit of God if you ain't got enough holy ghost in you to get you stirred up something's wrong with you you need to go get your own listen I don't want nobody in here got to have my spirit amen you have your own AMJ I ain't going to work you up into it either you have your own Spirit until God give you the Holy Ghost when God give you the real thing going on I won't have to worry about nothing in this church amen listen so she comes along and all the other ones are criticizing criticizing I think what it is many of us have forgotten where we come from amen see if you remembered you was like that woman who was a prostitute a and a y'all know what I'm talking about you was a illame woman if you could remember that you always remember to wash his feet hello somebody but you find out people forget they done been Christians so long they forgot where God done brought them from and so therefore it affect their character if you ever forget Calvary you you are in a trouble if you forget where you come from where God done brought you from you're in trouble Onward Christian Soldier marching as to walk with the cross of Jesus going on before is that all right amen we are invited to shape our own character to his this is what he said we are invited to shape our own character into his now we're going to find out what we've done shape our character to his own by his spirit is that right Hallelujah sons and daughter of God Listen by having his mind in us to shape our character to his having his mind in other words having his holy spirit in US is the purpose of having the Holy Ghost is not to shout dance and all that it is to have his character all of that other stuff comes with it but listen if without the character what good is it going to do amen is that all right give me about five more minutes like I said it was just a foundation everybody says well if I was in the days of Noah I would have got on the ark have you gotten in the ark yet huh but you said if I was in the days of North Jesus said as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in this day if I if if you was in Noah's day you would have got on Ark now that you in this day you're supposed to get in the ark right in the ark so the ark is Jesus Christ so my point is if you were there then you would do it and if you were here then you'll do it you got in the ark what is the arc Christ Jesus now we look at this thing and we say well brother let me tell you something they got all kind of ridicules they got all kind of people amen out here amen but the worst part let me put this way people out there in the world don't affect F me is people in the church it's attitudes that flies in the church that affects me maybe it shouldn't but it does you know why cuz I do care hello I do care and when you care then God Amen does something for you now here at this woman at Simon's house and everybody says shouldn't he know what kind of woman she is they ought to know he ought to know if he'd be a prophet I'm so glad to be one of them brother Brandon giv an illustration he talks about Billy Grahams group and or Roberts and how they came dressed in they nice suits all fine intellectual people their group came out first looking all clean and here was his group Hallelujah he billies in they all Hallelujah M come on somebody wheelchairs amen nobody didn't want to have nothing to do with them but that's who God came for hallelujah amen hallelujah he came for the scum of the earth he comes for the scum of the earth he come for the rejects of the devil the devil didn't even want you thank you Lord amen he comes amen you see because even the devil like he has a image we didn't even fit there coab BS but had wheed on the inside wo come on somebody you would have said well you know if I would have been in Moses day I man you know I'd have been in Moses day I'd have been up there with Moses you know mhm well they had had a a big group there waiting with him going across there and up in the ministry of Moses raises two Dayan a daythan and a Kora who basically interpreted what the prophet said you they had their own little whatever slant to it and they said well Moses do you think you're Theo the only holy man come what they didn't fail to see was that that was just a man that was God in a man and God had already told Moses you going down of Egypt and you're going to be God into pharaoh and Aaron is going to be your Prophet now watch this because even when Aaron messed up he got in trouble amen hello somebody so I want you to understand by the grace of God here it is you got all around and let me put it this way it ain't just the foolish virgins that GNA catch the the earthquake there'll be that day in Andor group oh amen among the message amen hello that would be left behind amen oh come on somebody because all they do is murmur and complain where are you in the scriptures if you were there with Elijah on Mount Karma where would you be let all of them that on the Lord's Side come on over here Moses said come on over here remember when they did that there in in in the wilderness Aon and the rest of them I'm jumping back now when they they they built this golden calf right and what they did made be deity out of a beast come on remember when that great Roman leader thought he was God and he felt dead right there cuz he lifted himself up remember Nebuchadnezzar I believe it down there in Babylon who thought he was so great right amen and what happened to him he ended up in the field acting like an animal a beast but here they come and B here they come along and they actually uh build a calf a golden calf a beast out of gold and said this and listen you will always know the effect of the golden calf because you began to strip yourself let me tell you something messes Church there in in in where I come from from began to let the women cut their hair oh you can wear makeup until God gives you a revelation men wearing shorts come don't tell me I know what a golden calf look like amen hello somebody and that same group of people ends up denying the cloud hello so listen people it's real when you began to let down to standard there's somewhere a golden calf and you know what they said they take the tradition of the prophet's life and they said well he did it so I can do it and brother B said that's where men fall when they take the prophet's life and make a tradition out of it it ain't his life is what this this Bible declare amen oh y'all don't like it but in his way so we look at this thing and what about Elijah you know Elijah was building The Altar and they they both building altars you know Moab and Moab was just a mixture anyway and they building the Altar and he's building the Altar and you know seven altars seven Rams seven you know they had all of the the fundamental things right in place but what they failed to see was the Covenant they failed to see who Elijah was come on somebody now let me put it this way and I'm going to close on this your character and I I didn't go get back to the Flash part cuz that's what brother B said he said flash he literally use the word flash he said your life is caught on the camera amen the photo has caught you amen you can't deny it you ever seen people do that amen especially in Hollywood the paparazzi find the people doing things they ain't got no business go you can't deny it you were there you did it and that's how God is and his holy spirit he when y'all think God ain't looking he watching every moment think about it think about it think about it what you fail to see the bible say that fear of the Lord the angel of the Lord encamp about those you're not by yourself you can't see it but they're there watching everything every move you make every thought you perceive and conceive that God is right there watching you amen and what you going to do about it the only thing that can conquer that is the nature of God Amen y'all hear what I said the Holy Ghost is the only thing your human ability can't conquer that nature it just make things worse yes amen hello somebody amen you say I'm crazy maybe I am but I'm going tell you something I was raised Muslim part Muslim and part Christian my daddy was a Muslim and my mama was a Christian and one thing I know about a lot of the Muslims mainly like Christians is that they can wear all the outer garments but the inside is filthy look so holy but the inside is filthy that's not what we want I could care less about the outside let the inside be holy hello and we find out by the grace of God this is where you and I must recognize that God is trying to clean you up and bring a transition amen but he said whosoever will whosoever will God is not going to go over your will he's not going to force you to do anything and if you're bride it's going to it's an anointing that comes with this age amen amen when God looked at Gideon are you a Gideon here and Gideon God told Gideon that Mighty Man of he said who you talking about me right he couldn't even see did God allow Gideon to go on on his human strength no he did not God said I'll go before you Gideon I'll fight this battle for you Gideon and Gideon had to say well Lord are you sure I'm the right one let this fleece be wet let this fleece be Dr are you sure I'm the right see he had a hard time with identification which is a lot of us amen we have a hard time with identifying ourselves as bride and because we have a heart time we always want this sign we always want that sign it ain't that it's taking God at his word amen when you take God at his word the signs will follow amen amen maturing amen coming into a place amen that this word is you and you are the word brother B said one thing about a True Believer said when he make a mistake he immediately say Lord forgive me amen right off the battle if he say something to somebody says well I I didn't mean to say it that way forgive me see but let me say it like this to you people we're in a day and I'm closing we're in a day in an hour that there's going to be so many people who are disappointed very disappointed because you know they put this way let me say it like this there was a young lady who had gone to the insane asylum because her boyfriend married another girl and she was so in love with this boy and she could not get over the fact that he went and married someone else and she told Brother Bram she actually believed that she know this boy love brother B said get over it basically he could not have loved you and married another but he said what you see what had happened she had created a world in her own mind she wanted to believe that this boy loved her and she created that world herself in her own mind and though the he never loved her in her mind he did and that was the thing that drove him crazy her crazy excuse me see that's what happened to a lot of us we create these things in our minds and it's going to take the Holy Ghost to come and release us from it we make ourselves believe a lie and that same lie works on our mind to almost drive us crazy hello somebody when somebody love you they'll die for you come on y'all hear what I'm saying don't it's it's what you've created in your mind surely he must know his action will prove the love amen or her action however you want to put it but we create these things in our mind see that's how powerful your thoughts are your thoughts create come on somebody amen your thoughts will create an imagine and you can create a whole world around Illusions and you'll believe it that's why so many people right now in their s or silent right now because they've allowed themselves to create a world that doesn't even exist huh and that's what happens to a lot of Christians they in their minds create this world I'm saved and they have no evidence of it they got no life to back it up they got nothing there and Satan will allow you to cocoon yourself into that world when God said these signs shall follow them that believe amen amen God said if you're born of God you have the love of God Amen hey somebody come on somebody and then so you can't allow yourself I'm telling you you got to see a change and if there's not a change you need to be at the altar somewhere you need to be crying out to God make the change amen and if I ever built my world around lies Lord break these lies up destroy these lies hallelujah amen I need to know that God is in me because he said in that day you'll know the father's in me I am in you is that right I'm in him and he's in me and I'm in you is that right so God said listen we can't allow ourselves Amen to build the state if so let the Holy Ghost come and destroy that thing that you may be free amen when brother around and brought her to her attention what she had done the reason why he tricked her he made her think that he loved her and you know how they said if you love me then you sleep with me and so she thought because he loved her she did that that that was love and what and he used her huh and she did not want to believe she had been used hello let us not let the devil use us people if you love God you keep his commandment you'll do everything you can to do what God wants you to do if it means you're skinning your own self amen that's stand character how many of us would have done like Peter holy spirit said Peter you got to go back this is your time to die that's Christ you think brother bandam didn't know he was going to be in that car accident he told that sister he said your dream was right God has taking it they taking the stering wheel out of my hand why use a stirring wheel he knew like Paul and the rest of them I'm going to The Chopping Block hello yes amen now I want you to understand by the grace of God you say he didn't know if you listen to on the wings of a snow white dove that's one of my favorite songs brother I'm talk about that war and how that dve was hit wounded blood all over it that's just the way it was say but the message made it home you see the message made it to the people people it's supposed to get to and I'm one of them you see that's what people don't understand like I was a lot of people you know we we we don't even understand what a prophet is that's why sometime you know people have a hard time with it but let me tell you something without a prophet we wouldn't have this messag amen according to Amos 3:7 God can't even reveal nothing to us except he reveal it to his Prophet first then his Prophet comes and he tell us like Noah nobody would have never known the world was coming to an end God dropped the thought in Noah's heart Noah became a preacher and God did what he said hallelujah amen Moses knew God came down to destroy Egypt right right that's what he was sent for nobody else knew they was living just like everybody else and they were so engrossed Amen in the Egyptian world that when Moses first came they weren't ready for him just like this message amen when the prophet first came they weren't ready they ready now people ready to get out of Ed is that right they're ready to lead this world now come on now God can do a Third Exodus Hallelujah he can bring a translation CU we're ready amen this time we're not carrying nothing of Egypt with us hallelujah we're leaving everything Hallelujah but I'm going tell you something people of God I want you to really meditate on what was preached this morning if you could grasp anything I pray that you grasp that there is a transition going on and and there's a stage of moving from whatever adolescent whatever stage you in you got to move on up to maturity right because I'm going telling you the dark room is coming it's prophecy it's the thought of God it's coming and I'll read prob have some things this evening but I want you to understand by the grace of God this is not a thing that we can play with it's real and and and I'm going tell you something America it's not just America it's the whole world everywhere I've gone is filthy and polluted it really is but America is being judged because of the mighty wonders and signs and wonders that was done in her and she rejected it anyway I mean we had more prophets and reform whatever we had we had more Ministries in America trying to wake her up than the history of the whole world or Roberts Billy Graham come on some Tommy Hicks all of these people William brandom all of these people on the field of America surely God must have loved her but because because she rejected it listen she will be destroyed amen we're past the age of Sodom and Gomorrah we into something else it's worse than that day it's worse than Pompei it's worse than com uh uh in the days of of of uh capernium it's worse and you expect God to Let It Go on like this it's not people and and one of the thoughts I I wanted to say in closing it is a wise Nation it is a wise country it is a wise people that prepares for war in a time of Peace this is a Warfare this ain't no joke it wasn't it was just yesterday we saw what those demons did to to the Jews staling and Hitler melini and all of them come on somebody that was just yesterday that's your day and you think people ain't going to do that now you think it's not no the Bible said evil seducers get worse and worse you and I cannot imagine the torture and and I'm not trying to put fear I'm trying to put re a reality in your heart you and I must recognize the day we're living in and let everything else listen the first priority is to make it into the ark amen come on somebody the first priority is to make it inside once you get inside you don't have to worry about nothing else you're taken care of the first priority is to make sure that you sealed with the Holy Ghost y'all hear what I'm saying this worldly Goods everything else means nothing amen people don't care whether you're rich or poor they don't care and you and I must come to a place listen it doesn't matter whether I got a billion a million what good if it my soul ain't right with God God Amen and knowing this message being able to quote it verbatim or or know what book and Page Don't Mean a Thing the devil knows that too but when that life is formed in you brother B say God Legion wasn't afraid of of no man Legion saw the character he saw what was coming at him he saw the character demons ain't afraid of nothing but character and that's God's character amen not human made character God 's character and when he saw Jesus come even the demons know the word is true when some of us struggle with it he said are you come to torment me before our time they knew know they going to be tormented amen hallelujah I I get zerious I get zerious I get jealous if you want to say it like this when I can see people like uh uh Beyonce who knows she's got a demon you you look at some of these Stars they know that demon in them and they let them demons listen they didn't just get those demons overnight they worked at it you got to work at opening your spirit but they know who they are even though they know they going to hell for it hello and you think the devil ain't the devil ain't Heaven told them they going to have eternal life you think the devil a hadn't offered them something you the devil ain't saying well listen you know but they know Listen People let me put it this way if if if a if if people can open themselves to demons and them demons can have control like that what about us if we could just open oursel to the Holy Ghost you see what I'm saying it's you you as an individual got to open up to God it don't have to be here it could be at your house wherever you want to be in the midst of a feel somewhere but you need to get somewhere to let God completely come into your life I used to be so concerned about anointings and the Holy Spirit spoke to me yesterday he's trying to teach you something you're trying to grow he's trying to bring you into a maturity you know because everything's going to cease everything's going to cease tongue's going to cease all these things going to cease everything but the word and guess what even in the most a lot of people Divine love is going to Cease the love of many will wax cold right you know what makes that happen when you become judgmental when you start looking at something and looking at that and judging it the wrong way like the told me that anyway that's the truth he T me so he said me and my my my son-in-law was talking other day he talked about the man who said you got three three fingers po that he said but hey so now he don't point this way he point this way but that's the truth and then you got to recognize amen that you know Jesus said if you put away the pointing of the finger I'll heal you and that's the thing we we constantly do we've got to stop it amen my heart is trying to pour out to you um and I in closing God loves you but do you love God do you love God I tell you what uh both of my grandbabies uh Judah and um Nehemiah love the the tamarine I wish I had it on film my wife bought both of them Tamarin the other day and the expression of those babies were Priceless it was like I can't explain it it was just like oh I've never seen anybody that would appreciate such toys but it's like I can't explain it but it it I'll never forget it and that was a tambourine now one thing I I I I I I know about Jude uh Nehemiah I can't say about Jud because I'm not there but sometime they I know he he likes to play it early morning and he likes to play it at night and he worships he really worship they both do and and and Judah uh Judah get his one leg and he work that thing and he work it right and in Nehemiah he jumps I ain't never seen a bo boy baby like that I they both you know you look at them and you think what's going on you think they just playing no no it's serious and they they're not playing it's real serious things going on in there and and until the natural eye you'll miss it when I went down to brother Craig's church and seen all those little children all the way up just in there telling me what was preached and how and this and the scriptures and this just and I'm thinking here's these old folks something's going on and I'm going tell you something people you you see God getting these children ready for something and here we are standing getting the fullness of the word because I'm G to tell you something you say well I I need it deeper let me tell you something the deeper the deepest thing you could ever have in you is the character of Christ there'll be things we'll never understand until we get over there but if you miss the Deep things it's not like you said becoming a parot I can quote brother brandom I can quote the scripture but that means nothing if that life is not living amen and that's all I'm saying people of God anybody can be religious anybody can wear long dresses anybody can wear long hair because a lot of Cults wear the same thing but that ain't it people are shaving come on somebody who can look as well as the Mormons they come out looking clean but but that ain't it it's Christ it's the Holy Ghost in you and that's what that's what matters how can you say you got the Holy Ghost and ain't no joy in your life somewhere you're not in his presence because the Bible said in the presence of the Lord there's fullness of joy there is no way you can say I'm in Christ and there is no joy amen if I'm in the claps of the rock the storm is not affecting me cuz I'm here in Christ and that's all I'm trying to say don't build this illusion around your world making a a world that doesn't exist reality is what we're looking for it is the only way you're going to grow out of this thing that Satan has locked you into some religious illusion you better have a reality in your life and it's got to be God in you and I don't care how so many people who can you know that's what all I say is this listen nothing wrong with quoting him and all that but listen what good is that going to do if the life of Jesus Christ is not in you brother brand said it like this and I'm closing for real he said if you don't get desperate it's going to pass right through you and if there be a time to be desperate it's this time cuz you can see the flood waters coming your way am I the only one you can see this thing coming your way can't you see it coming your way it's coming this whole flood thing is headed toward the bride because you're the only one that's going to fully be rebellious you're the rebels of the age you're the Martin Luther you're the westons come on somebody you're the William Brams you're the ones who who Who's who's standing against not only just the church system but the political system that's literally all wrong and corrupt you're the one and God has ordained you to do that now what you going to do with it are you prepared are you prepared one thing our president say this is a time of change he caught the inspiration he caught the inspiration but look what kind of change he bringing versus the kind that God trying to bring to you you love God let's pray our gracious Heavenly Father God I pray father that you would have mercy upon our souls I pray that you give the the people a spiritual ear to hear and receive the word Lord God I pray father God that you would move into their lives I pray father God that you would just do something father oh God that that to open their eyes that they might see Lord I was a little choppy and a little hard this morning but Lord God it is the hour that we're living in where nothing matters but your character father way you think the way you live the way you speak the way you are is what you're coming back for lord images of you Lord Jesus not of something else not something H not something the image of you must be found in us at your coming Lord and what you would do in all circumstances is what we must learn and yield ourselves to do Lord I pray father God that you grant us death to ourselves that we might die out to ourselves father God I ask these things in Your Name Lord Jesus Christ be merciful to us Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
