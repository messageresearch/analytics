[20:55] called the fountain of living water amen
[20:59] the fountain of living water
[21:07] this has been a wonderful message to go
[21:12] through the Scriptures on I've just had
[21:14] a good time last night as I was thinking
[21:17] about this and this morning as I got up
[21:20] came here and it's going through the
[21:22] scriptures is just all the scriptures
[21:26] say when they just start meshing and
[21:28] flowing together you know there's
[21:30] nothing like it in the world amen
[21:33] so let's read from John chapter 4 we'll
[21:36] read from the 13th verse remember this
[21:41] is the woman at the well amen and Jesus
[21:44] is speaking to her and he says jesus
[21:47] answered and said unto her whosoever
[21:49] drinketh of this water shall thirst
[21:53] again but whosoever drinketh of the
[21:56] water that I shall give him shall never
[21:59] thirst but the water that I shall give
[22:01] him shall be in him a well of water
[22:05] springing up into everlasting life Amen
[22:10] Lissa Speier has a word of Prayer
[22:12] Heavenly Father we just want to thank
[22:14] you Lord for your gospel father for
[22:16] Laura has given us light all the day
[22:18] long father
[22:19] it's your gospel Lord that you used to
[22:21] change us Lord to lead us into you
[22:24] father and for that we thank you Lord
[22:26] for giving it unto us Lord and as we
[22:28] read from your gospel this morning
[22:31] father all the verses that we've written
[22:33] down and whatever you make quicken to us
[22:35] Lord we pray father that you would open
[22:38] the hearts of every person father flora
[22:40] when their people come into this room
[22:42] they come to have their hearts searched
[22:43] father and I pray Lord that you would do
[22:45] that this morning faithfully like you
[22:47] always do and we just submit ourselves
[22:49] unto you this morning father in the name
[22:52] of Lord Jesus Christ for you to take
[22:54] control and we just think you father for
[22:57] all things in your name we pray amen
[23:00] amen you can be seated hey man I think
[23:06] you all remember this is a very familiar
[23:09] scripture a familiar story about how
[23:12] Jesus was traveling and he told his
[23:15] disciples I have needs
[23:18] to go by Samaria
[23:20] amen and I just I love the way that's
[23:22] written because Christ had a neat you
[23:26] know it's nice to think about what
[23:27] Christ has needs up and when you think
[23:29] about he had needs to go by Samaria
[23:31] there was someone down there that had a
[23:34] neat Amen there was a seed down there
[23:37] that was thirsty amen and he was gonna
[23:40] go down there and give that seed that
[23:42] was thirsty give it some living water
[23:46] amen because I give that seed some
[23:51] living water amen so what'd he do he
[23:55] went down and he met her at the very
[23:57] place where she was getting her natural
[24:00] water amen so if she would go and she
[24:03] was like you know I need to a little
[24:05] thirsty I need to get some water for the
[24:08] next day for cooking for all the things
[24:10] I have Nita for the next 24 hours or
[24:12] whatever I go down to the well and get
[24:15] some water amen the water will supply
[24:17] all my needs for the next day and then
[24:19] when it runs out I'll go back down to
[24:21] the wat well again the next day and I
[24:24] all gather more water for the next day
[24:26] that was her daily habit to go down
[24:28] there and get water but on this day was
[24:30] unlike other days amen because when she
[24:33] went down to get water to supply her
[24:35] needs for this day there was a need that
[24:39] was in her heart that was not being met
[24:41] by the daily water that she was getting
[24:43] amen because she had a need to be saved
[24:46] she had a need to be filled with the
[24:48] Holy Ghost she had a need that the
[24:50] promise of Jehovah would come upon her
[24:52] amen why because there was a seed deep
[24:54] down on the inside of her that was
[24:56] crying out for water amen and no matter
[25:00] how much water should get it out of that
[25:02] well that water that she drank could
[25:04] never touch the seed that was within her
[25:06] heart amen because that that seed will
[25:09] only grow by the everlasting water from
[25:12] Jehovah amen that that seed can never
[25:15] grow by any natural water there's
[25:17] nothing that we can do to make that seed
[25:19] grow but once that seed ever comes in
[25:22] contact with the living water from Jesus
[25:25] Christ then that seed will begin to grow
[25:28] amen and so if you are in this church
[25:31] this morning amen and you
[25:33] a seed within yourself if it hasn't
[25:35] grown yet if it hasn't borne any fruits
[25:38] yet if you're not doing anything in the
[25:40] kingdom of your father let me tell you
[25:42] that seed needs to come in contact with
[25:45] the living water
[25:46] amen their Christ has a water that seed
[25:50] will only respond to one type of water
[25:53] it won't respond to anything natural
[25:55] this world you can do it won't respond
[25:57] to you the habits of this life or the
[25:59] things that we enjoy won't respond to
[26:01] our cell phones they won't respond to
[26:03] our jobs or our careers they won't
[26:05] respond to our schooling or anything
[26:07] else that we might do but there is a
[26:09] seed that God gave us that's deep down
[26:12] the inside of us that will only respond
[26:14] to the water that Jesus Christ can give
[26:17] a man once it come brings it into
[26:20] contact with that water then Christ will
[26:22] give you water and you will never thirst
[26:24] again that's quite a promise I have
[26:30] water to give you and if you drink of
[26:33] this water you will never ever thirst
[26:36] again and the woman when she heard that
[26:38] promise she said I come I have to come
[26:42] to this well every single day amen only
[26:47] I can only carry out so much just enough
[26:50] to last for the day and you could make
[26:53] me so I don't have to toil and come here
[26:56] every day this is amazing this is gonna
[26:59] give me so much time but you don't know
[27:01] what he is doing was he was offering her
[27:03] rest
[27:04] a mint he was offering her rest from all
[27:07] the foolishness that she had going on in
[27:09] her life amen you know what I mean so
[27:13] when Jesus got there he got down to the
[27:15] well he had a purpose in his heart he
[27:18] sent his disciples away amen and he's
[27:21] because he knew that he had water they
[27:23] had to bring into contact with the seed
[27:27] amen so the seed that was deep down
[27:29] inside of her heart in order to get
[27:31] access to that seat he just sat down and
[27:34] just waited for her to come amen as soon
[27:37] as he came the the spirit of Jesus
[27:40] Christ began searching her heart what
[27:45] was he doing he's looking for that
[27:46] see he's looking to find out what is
[27:48] stopping the water from getting to the
[27:51] seat I mean what what is preventing it
[27:54] what why is there a drought here what
[27:57] what's going on that the water is not
[27:59] getting to the seat because he could see
[28:01] that there was no fruits of his life in
[28:04] her life amen there was no fruits of the
[28:08] the seed that he had given her before
[28:10] the foundation of the world was not
[28:12] bearing any fruit amen and so they began
[28:15] to talk to her and began to get a sense
[28:17] of what her spirit was what her nature
[28:20] was what her habits were what she did
[28:22] right what she did wrong and throughout
[28:25] all that he couldn't find any evidence
[28:26] of the fruits of the seed that he had
[28:29] given her a man named now God has given
[28:32] all of us the opportunity to have the
[28:35] seed amen amen if you're here in this
[28:37] building this morning amen you are
[28:39] brought here because of a thirst inside
[28:41] of your heart amen and there is a thirst
[28:43] why is there a thirst because there's
[28:45] something inside of you that needs to
[28:47] come to the well to come to living water
[28:50] amen and all of us come here why because
[28:52] there is something inside of us this
[28:54] thirsting for living water
[28:56] amen well God has that living water for
[28:59] you amen and when as soon as you bring
[29:02] that seed into contact with the water it
[29:04] begins to bear fruit it begins to grow
[29:07] amen God has a water for you that if you
[29:10] drink of that water you will never
[29:12] thirst again and by never thirst and
[29:17] again that means that that seed will
[29:19] grow and grow and grow and will push out
[29:22] fruits and branches and leaves you know
[29:25] keep growing because there is a
[29:27] everlasting supply it's like a tree that
[29:30] is planted by the rivers of living water
[29:32] amen why because they continually thirst
[29:35] if that tree is never thirsty because I
[29:38] can never thirst again because it is
[29:40] tapped into the mainspring the river of
[29:43] flowing water will to where there can be
[29:45] no drought that's to be the description
[29:50] of every Christian
[29:54] amen so when Jesus Christ got down to
[29:57] the well and found out that that was not
[29:59] the description of this woman amen then
[30:02] he sat down and he began to search her
[30:04] heart you know the Holy Spirit still
[30:06] does that you know that is a process
[30:10] that has never ceased Jesus Christ will
[30:12] still meet you wherever it is that
[30:15] you're trying to fulfill these desires
[30:18] amen whatever you're doing to fulfill
[30:20] your natural thirst he'll meet you right
[30:23] there and he'll just search your heart
[30:25] amen whatever it is you're doing to
[30:27] fulfill the natural desires of your life
[30:29] you think you're going there to to
[30:31] fulfill some natural thing in your mind
[30:33] and Christ will just sit there and begin
[30:35] talking to you amen the Holy Spirit
[30:37] what's he doing he searches your hearts
[30:39] let's just I want to read a couple
[30:40] scriptures here let's turn over to
[30:41] Romans chapter eight Romans eight and 26
[30:52] he says likewise the spirit also helpeth
[31:01] our infirmities for we know not what we
[31:04] should pray for as we ought but the
[31:06] Spirit itself maketh intercession for us
[31:09] with groanings which cannot be uttered
[31:13] and he that searches the hearts knoweth
[31:16] what is the mind of the Spirit because
[31:19] he maketh intercession for the Saints
[31:21] according to the will of God amen and
[31:24] that is happening right now that is
[31:28] happening right now you have come to the
[31:30] well this morning amen and the Holy
[31:32] Spirit is here to search your heart he
[31:35] is here to find out exactly what you
[31:36] have need of amen and as he searches
[31:39] your heart he is finding out what you
[31:41] have need of what do you have need of
[31:43] what are you lacking why are you not
[31:46] bearing fruit like you're supposed to
[31:47] bear fruit why are you not rejoicing the
[31:50] way you're supposed to rejoice Amen why
[31:51] do you know I have a revival the way
[31:53] you're supposed to have revival it is
[31:54] they begin searching and searching what
[31:56] does he do he knows the every single
[31:59] thing about your heart amen amen
[32:02] so and then what what is he doing he
[32:04] discovers the knees it says in verse 26
[32:06] likewise the spirit
[32:07] also helpeth our infirmities because we
[32:12] don't know how we should pray the spirit
[32:16] we you know we don't always know exactly
[32:18] what's wrong with us amen we don't
[32:21] always know why we're not living the way
[32:24] we ought to live but this spirit helps
[32:27] us by praying for us by discovering why
[32:30] is the seed not getting the water like
[32:33] it's supposed to
[32:33] why is the tree that was supposed to be
[32:36] planted by the rivers of living water
[32:37] why is it not bearing fruit like it's
[32:40] supposed to amen what what is the matter
[32:42] here and I will help your infirmities I
[32:45] will pray for you I will meet you at the
[32:48] well amen and I will pray for you and I
[32:50] will bring you and I'll give you this
[32:51] water and if you can ever get in contact
[32:54] with this water you will never thirst
[32:57] again what a promise that was that
[33:02] promise wasn't just to the woman at the
[33:04] world it wasn't just that Samaritan this
[33:07] wasn't a one-time thing
[33:08] no God is still doing that today and he
[33:12] will do it for you God will search your
[33:15] heart you know who's else heart he
[33:17] searches let's go to 1st Corinthians 2:9
[33:22] the Holy Spirit searches the hearts 1st
[33:30] Corinthians 2:9 as it says but as it is
[33:35] written eye hath not seen nor ear heard
[33:42] nor have entered into the heart of man
[33:44] the things that God hath prepared for
[33:46] them that love him but God hath revealed
[33:50] them unto us by his Spirit for the
[33:53] spirit searcheth all things yea the deep
[33:56] things of God amen so there's somewhere
[34:01] no that means there is a divine purpose
[34:03] beyond God visiting us the well because
[34:07] the Holy Spirit has searched the heart
[34:10] of God doesn't just search your heart he
[34:13] goes he searches his own heart he finds
[34:16] out what the will of the father is for
[34:19] your life and he comes down to you and
[34:21] he wants to give you that eternal will
[34:23] amen to get our minds off the blinders
[34:27] of this age get our eyes away from just
[34:29] thinking about these natural things but
[34:31] let me tell you my father has prepared
[34:33] something for you a man from before the
[34:36] foundation of the world is he said I've
[34:38] I believe here I go to prepare a place
[34:40] for you and I will come and receive you
[34:42] again unto myself but if I leave you I
[34:45] will go and prepare a place for you a
[34:47] man saw was he done he is gone and he
[34:49] says no man I is not seen the ear is not
[34:52] heard neither have it entered into the
[34:53] heart of man the things that God has
[34:56] prepared for them that love him amen
[34:58] that's those that have met him down at
[35:00] the well those that met him down at the
[35:03] well at the river living water they
[35:05] partook of the living water
[35:07] they'll never thirst again and he has
[35:09] prepared something for you the eye has
[35:12] not seen it neither has the ear heard of
[35:14] it it hasn't even entered into your
[35:16] heart the joy that it could be a meant
[35:18] but God has revealed them unto us by his
[35:21] Spirit for the spirit searches all the
[35:24] things yea the deep things of God and
[35:26] when God begins to reveal this eternal
[35:28] purpose to you it gives you a
[35:31] steadfastness that you're not here to
[35:35] further your career you're not here just
[35:39] to raise a family you're not here just
[35:41] to build your house you're not here just
[35:44] to grow up and get a good job amen but
[35:46] you're here because you will never ever
[35:49] die amen now think about this body is
[35:55] just a temporal body this body that we
[35:59] are living in right now is just a
[36:01] temporary body it was given to us to
[36:05] meet our needs for the time being while
[36:07] we learn these things down here through
[36:09] the things that we suffer amen amen and
[36:12] we learn these things but there's a
[36:13] spirit down on the inside of us that
[36:16] must have a body amen and it has a body
[36:19] but one of these days we will trade this
[36:21] body in for another body and in a moment
[36:25] in a twinkling of an eye of an eye at
[36:27] that last day this body will begin to
[36:30] disappear and we'll be given a body like
[36:33] his glorious body
[36:35] I will be changed and when we see him we
[36:38] will be like him hey man it will be
[36:40] flesh of his flesh bone of his bone amen
[36:43] so our soul has changed to be like his
[36:47] soul our spirit has changed to be like
[36:49] his spirit and then our body gets to be
[36:51] changed like his body it's a process
[36:54] that we were going through why why why
[36:57] all that because in the very beginning
[36:58] we had a seed that was like under his
[37:00] seat a mint and the seed must have a
[37:04] body amen amen but I remember this body
[37:08] is only temporary but God has prepared a
[37:10] body for you God has prepared a
[37:13] tabernacle for you to live in amen amen
[37:18] you know the Jews typed it out in so
[37:22] many ways through all our feasts and all
[37:24] those things you know you think about
[37:25] how the rejoicing that they had all the
[37:29] day long their harvests you know the
[37:32] land of Israel was dependent upon the
[37:34] ring of God they had their their crops
[37:38] the eating the God told them when they
[37:42] were leaving Egypt and they're coming
[37:45] into the Promised Land he told them in
[37:47] the book of Deuteronomy he says the land
[37:51] that you're going into is not like the
[37:53] land of Egypt and he tells them he says
[37:57] in the land of Egypt you had irrigation
[37:59] channels and you would have to dig these
[38:02] channels and then the water would come
[38:04] down through the river and and they
[38:06] would go flow through these channels and
[38:07] you'd always have always have water for
[38:10] your crops and God told them by the
[38:12] prophet Moses the land of Israel is not
[38:15] like the land of Egypt amen you know
[38:17] that's true the land of this of this
[38:21] Holy Spirit life is not like that
[38:23] natural life it's not like the life that
[38:27] we live back there amen but he told them
[38:29] by the prophet Moses he says the land of
[38:32] Israel is not like the land of Egypt
[38:34] you're not going to water your crops
[38:35] through irrigation you're not gonna dig
[38:38] channels for the water to flow through
[38:39] he says how you're going to get the
[38:42] water for your crops is you're gonna
[38:43] pray to me for a rain and I will bring
[38:47] you rain as do
[38:48] season four they even itch her into the
[38:54] land he told them he says if you listen
[38:57] to me and you obey my Commandments I
[39:00] will bring you the latter rain and the
[39:03] former rain is due season if you want
[39:09] your crops or grow good just pray to me
[39:11] I will send you the rain I will be your
[39:14] source of water you don't have to dig no
[39:16] channels you don't have to trust in your
[39:18] own Labor's you don't have to trust in
[39:19] this or in the river all you got to do
[39:22] is just trust in me and I will provide
[39:25] you water see God has been doing this
[39:28] for a long long long time amen he has
[39:31] always been the fountain of living water
[39:35] he's always wanted to make sure that his
[39:38] people understood thoroughly that if you
[39:41] need water you come to me whatever you
[39:43] have need of in this life's journey you
[39:45] come to me and I will be your source I
[39:48] will be I will provide for all of your
[39:50] needs I will be Jehovah Jireh to you and
[39:53] I will be providing for your needs
[39:56] don't go off over here and look to this
[39:58] don't do the way of the Egyptians don't
[40:01] trust in your own self itself but just
[40:03] trust in me and I'll provide for you hey
[40:07] man he came to the woman at the well and
[40:09] he found out that she was trusting and
[40:11] some man made well that was made
[40:13] thousands of years ago hey man it wasn't
[40:16] changing her it wasn't do anything for
[40:17] her she is still living in her sins she
[40:20] had a seed of God but it wasn't doing
[40:22] anything for she wasn't she wasn't it
[40:25] wasn't producing anything she had a seed
[40:27] there so he met her and said you need to
[40:30] get this water from me amen you don't
[40:33] need to beasts going over here to the
[40:34] well you don't need to be going over
[40:35] here but just come to me I'll give you
[40:38] water when you will never thirst again
[40:42] amen he is the fountain of living water
[40:46] amen you will never thirst again
[40:54] you know this fountain of living water
[40:57] is a flowing fountain a man it's not a
[41:00] stagnated pool
[41:02] it doesn't just sit there but it's
[41:04] always refreshed you know of a while
[41:08] back our dishwasher was broken and my
[41:11] kids were having to remember how to do
[41:14] dishes by hand and they were you know
[41:20] and sometimes you know you do you have
[41:21] so many dishes to do and pretty soon
[41:24] your dish water when you started was a
[41:28] dish as a sink full of clean water and
[41:33] it's full of soap suds but you know
[41:36] after you washed so many dishes all of a
[41:38] sudden the water will used to be clear
[41:39] is now turned gray all your soap suds
[41:42] are gone and there's grease in your
[41:44] water and you look at that and you know
[41:46] and you have to kind of remind your
[41:48] children you know you cannot use this
[41:50] water to clean anything when the water
[41:53] gets to this condition Amen it will no
[41:56] longer clean anything amen now when the
[42:00] water was clear and there were soap suds
[42:03] in it you could have somewhat kind of a
[42:05] faith that if you put a dish in there
[42:06] and you scrub it on all around it
[42:08] then when you pull back up all the
[42:09] grease will be gone all the dirt and
[42:12] crumbs will be gone amen you could run
[42:14] your finger across it with those squeaks
[42:16] please do you think why cuz it's squeaky
[42:18] clean amen but when you but when you try
[42:22] to but when your water turns gray and
[42:25] the soap suds are gone and it's full of
[42:27] grease and you put your greasy dish in
[42:30] there and you scrub it for a while and
[42:31] you bring it out and scrubber on the
[42:32] other side you pull it out and you rub
[42:34] your finger across it it just slides
[42:36] roll it why because it's already greased
[42:38] amen why because that water couldn't get
[42:41] the grease off amen it's become a
[42:43] stagnated pool of water amen let's throw
[42:47] her to Jeremiah Jeremiah chapter 2
[43:03] God's been talking about water for a
[43:04] long time a mine jerem and jeremiah
[43:10] chapter two in the third and the twelfth
[43:13] verse he is commanding the heavens to be
[43:17] astonished he's speaking to the heavens
[43:22] and he's just basically commanding all
[43:25] of creation look at this
[43:29] amen verse 12
[43:31] Jeremiah 2:12 be astonished Oh II
[43:34] heavens at this and be horribly afraid
[43:39] my god is speaking no it's a strong
[43:44] language Jehovah God the fountain of
[43:49] living water is speaking to all creation
[43:52] and he's telling it be astonished and be
[43:56] very afraid know what could bring
[44:00] creation into the sphere be astonished
[44:05] oh he heavens at this and be horribly
[44:08] afraid be very desolate saith the Lord
[44:12] for my people have committed two evils
[44:15] they have forsaken me the fountain of
[44:19] living waters and have hewed them out
[44:22] cisterns broken cisterns that can hold
[44:26] no water and when the people fall all
[44:33] creation suffers a mint my people have
[44:38] committed these two evils
[44:40] I was the fountain of living water when
[44:43] they enter into this land I commanded
[44:46] them this land is not like the land of
[44:48] Egypt Amen you won't get your crops
[44:51] through irrigation but you'll get your
[44:53] crops through praying to me and you'll
[44:56] get water for your crops by praying to
[44:58] me amen and when they quit serving the
[45:02] Lord it says if you ever forsake me and
[45:06] go to your to the other gods or the gods
[45:09] of your neighbors then I will speak to
[45:11] the heavens and I all the heavens will
[45:14] withhold their rain from you
[45:16] amen and that is what is happening in
[45:18] this in this very thing because their
[45:21] sins were caused it so the heavens were
[45:25] now becoming unreliable
[45:27] amen amen they were trying to live in
[45:31] the land of Jehovah but not trust
[45:34] Jehovah for the rain so they forsook
[45:38] Jehovah the fountain of ever flowing
[45:40] water a man they forsook him the one
[45:43] that would provide them with water and
[45:45] when they began to run out of water they
[45:48] dug themselves cisterns holes in the
[45:50] ground and they would try to hold over
[45:53] water from another age aiming and that
[45:55] water would get stagnated amen I'd have
[45:58] things growing in it it was leaked out
[46:00] amen and run out at the worst time amen
[46:03] if they had anything all be left to be a
[46:04] little pool with bugs in it amen and
[46:07] then and God says commands to the
[46:10] heavens oh heavens be afraid be
[46:13] astonished at this
[46:14] I used to command you o heavens to rain
[46:18] down upon my people but look at them
[46:20] they are no longer living according to
[46:23] my plan they're no longer living
[46:24] according to my laws
[46:25] so be afraid you will no longer be
[46:28] providing water for my people because
[46:30] they're trying to live if I get their
[46:32] water through sisters or some other way
[46:35] they may you know some people try to
[46:37] live this life without pre hey man some
[46:41] people try to live this life without
[46:42] reading their Bible a man some people
[46:44] try to live this life and come to church
[46:47] and call themselves a Christian yet
[46:49] inside themselves they just have this
[46:51] cistern where they're trying to hold
[46:53] hold this little bit of water from when
[46:55] they read their Bible two months ago the
[46:58] last time or were the last time they met
[47:00] Jehovah was three months ago and they're
[47:02] trying to hold this a little bit of an
[47:04] experience inside of themselves because
[47:07] it's been a long time since they've met
[47:09] the Lord Jesus Christ and God calls to
[47:13] the heavens stop the rain my people are
[47:17] no longer seeking after me the one true
[47:20] God but they've went off and they sought
[47:22] the gods of the people around them amen
[47:25] and so what does he do he calls to the
[47:28] heavens
[47:29] stop the rain amen
[47:33] remember about six weeks ago we preached
[47:36] a message when Iced preaching on the
[47:38] return to righteousness and where we
[47:41] read that verse in Haggai chapter 1
[47:44] let's just turn over to it
[47:46] Haggai chapter 1 verse 11 I found out in
[47:57] Iowa City and French it's pronounced AG
[48:00] AG hey guy
[48:03] second-to-last book in the Old Testament
[48:09] and just kind of recap what we preach on
[48:12] I think it's about six weeks ago or so
[48:15] we read this verse here but we only read
[48:19] the first six words of it Haggai 1:11
[48:22] and we read it and it says there in
[48:26] verse 11 says and I called for a drought
[48:30] and the basis of the message was is here
[48:34] the people the children of Israel were
[48:37] living in a day of restoration they are
[48:40] living in a day where they come out of
[48:42] the Babylonian captivity they had come
[48:45] back into the promised land they had
[48:47] been given everything they had need of
[48:49] to restore their national life to
[48:52] restore the temple they've been given
[48:54] gold and silver and money by serous the
[48:58] king of Persia amen when he gave out the
[49:00] game in the commandment leave Babylon or
[49:03] Persia go back to Jerusalem build
[49:05] yourself a temple there and worship the
[49:07] God of your father's you can't get much
[49:09] better than that amen and when they and
[49:12] when they got back there and that they
[49:15] when they got back there that they had
[49:18] everything they had need up to restore
[49:20] to have a restoration and instead they
[49:23] just built their own houses and instead
[49:27] they took all the money that they had a
[49:29] head up and in because Haggai chapter
[49:32] one takes place sixteen years after Ezra
[49:36] chapter one so Ezra chapter one they're
[49:39] the Kyocera Sims them back they have all
[49:42] the goal
[49:42] hold the money the silver the HR into
[49:44] Jerusalem they're there they're going to
[49:46] rebuild their temple they can restore
[49:47] their national life they're gonna pray
[49:50] to Jehovah again they're gonna build
[49:51] their crops again they're gonna do all
[49:53] those all these things and they're gonna
[49:55] live life like they used to before the
[49:58] Babylonian captivity amen but they can
[50:00] in this day of restoration amen God 16
[50:04] years later God sends a prophet knocking
[50:07] at their door
[50:09] why because sick after 16 years of
[50:12] living in this day of restoration God
[50:15] sends a prophet at their door and he
[50:17] says Jehovah is calling for a drought
[50:20] that at the very time of the restoration
[50:23] of all things God's chosen people living
[50:26] in God's chosen land in the day of
[50:28] restoration of all things God is calling
[50:31] and speaking to the heavens I'm calling
[50:34] for a drought why is he calling for a
[50:36] drought because this time at this point
[50:38] I have given you everything you have
[50:40] need of to restore yourself to restore
[50:44] the temple and instead of restoring the
[50:46] temple as a place to praise me you went
[50:49] and you built your own houses and trim
[50:51] them out and now it's been 16 years and
[50:55] you haven't done anything and so God
[50:58] sent a prophet
[50:59] you know God sends his prophets to get
[51:01] his people whipped back into shape hey
[51:04] man when God's people are living in a
[51:07] day to where they should be doing one
[51:09] thing and he needs him to turn a corner
[51:11] and so he sends a prophet to get them to
[51:14] turn the corner amen those that turn
[51:17] that corner live along with God and live
[51:20] in live with him in peace joy and
[51:21] righteousness amen but those that ignore
[51:24] what the Prophet says they go keep going
[51:26] straight off into destruction amen and
[51:30] that's what it is
[51:31] God always sends his prophets at those
[51:34] Junction times where you have to turn a
[51:36] corner amen that's what God has done in
[51:40] our day he sent her prophets so that we
[51:42] might turn the corner so we could live
[51:45] in a day of restoration but I want to
[51:47] warn you that just like in the day of
[51:50] Haggai there it's now been long enough
[51:53] we've been living in this day of
[51:54] restoration because
[51:56] day event restoration for them was Ezra
[51:58] chapter one Amen but here in the book of
[52:01] Haggai it's been 16 years and they still
[52:04] hadn't done anything a man I think that
[52:06] God has a message for us that we need to
[52:11] need to be fulfilling what the Prophet
[52:13] told us to do amen amen we've already
[52:16] had our Ezra chapter one experience amen
[52:18] amen but it's time for us to get her
[52:21] getting gear amen amen and Haggai
[52:25] chapter 1 verse 6 it says you've sewn
[52:28] much but you bring in little you eat but
[52:31] you have not enough you drink but you're
[52:33] not filled with drink you put on your
[52:35] clothes but there's no one that's warm
[52:37] and he the earth wages earth wages to
[52:41] put it in a bag of holes and he says
[52:45] thus saith the Lord of hosts consider
[52:47] your ways go up into the mountain bring
[52:51] down the wood and build the house build
[52:54] the house of Jehovah do the first things
[52:57] you did the last things first and you
[53:00] left the first things undone I want you
[53:02] to come here and build my house you know
[53:05] these things are types for us every
[53:09] single one of us has a house amen
[53:17] he cares for you but do you care
[53:22] amen he is the fountain of living waters
[53:28] but are you drinking Amen because he has
[53:32] provided us the fountain but if we don't
[53:36] drink then how can he transform us you
[53:42] know my dad told me that some of the
[53:45] best medicine you can ever have is water
[53:50] some of the best medicine you can ever
[53:52] ever take is water hey man you know
[53:56] because there in reality your body knows
[53:58] how to heal itself God put it in your
[54:01] DNA that your body will be self-healing
[54:04] amen and really just to eat the right
[54:06] foods and drink enough water and your
[54:08] body will know how
[54:10] to heal itself amen amen let's turn it
[54:14] over to Deuteronomy chapter 11
[54:27] your body knows how to heal itself why
[54:31] is it knowing because God told it to God
[54:35] put it inside your body that if you get
[54:38] a scratch on your hand that your body
[54:41] immediately goes to work taking water
[54:44] and the things that you eat a mint and
[54:46] begins rebuilding according to the
[54:49] pattern that's written in the DNA in
[54:50] your body there's a DNA in your body
[54:53] that it was exactly what your body is
[54:55] supposed to look like amen it's that DNA
[54:58] that created your body the first time
[55:00] it's God's Word from the foundation of
[55:02] the world it's inscribed there in the
[55:04] DNA in your body
[55:06] amen and that DNA knew how to make your
[55:08] body the first time amen and when your
[55:11] body gets sick the DNA knows how to
[55:13] recreate your body the second time a man
[55:16] so God just has to speak and give you
[55:19] the see the DNA on the inside and make
[55:21] sure it has everything it has need of
[55:23] the water and the raw material to
[55:26] recreate it the second time amen but in
[55:29] Deuteronomy chapter 11 verse 10 so the
[55:31] verse that we were speaking about it
[55:32] says for the land that our goal is
[55:34] Enterprise s it is not like the land of
[55:38] Egypt from whence you came out of where
[55:40] thou so acai seed and water sit with thy
[55:43] foot that's irrigation digging
[55:45] irrigation channels as a garden of herbs
[55:47] but the land where you go to possess it
[55:50] is a land of hills and valleys and it
[55:53] drinks the water of heaven it drinks the
[55:57] water of the rain of heaven amen this
[56:01] water is not like the land of Egypt but
[56:03] it needs to get us water from heaven and
[56:05] let me tell you this or you you are not
[56:07] like the Egyptians out there Amen you

[58:26] fountain of living waters amen if you
[58:29] don't do it you're being dilatory and

[58:33] for a drought until you come back to
[58:35] your senses a man some people say boy
[58:37] I'm just so dry it's been a long time so
[58:40] I had an experience with the Lord well

[59:56] the olives and everything was brought in
[59:58] and they were successful and when you
[1:00:00] come to the end of the year you were to

[1:00:05] to rejoice that God had provided you
[1:00:08] everything that you had Nita and now you
[1:00:11] were to enter into his rest and enjoy
[1:00:14] the fruits of the harvest amen amen and
[1:00:17] when he called this feast he says I want
[1:00:20] you to be this to be a feast of
[1:00:22] tabernacles and he says go and build
[1:00:25] little booths outside your house and be
[1:00:28] a temporary dwelling place amen and you
[1:00:31] live in this temporary dwelling place
[1:00:33] during the eight days of this feast and
[1:00:35] on the eighth day on the seven days of
[1:00:37] the feast and on the eighth day
[1:00:39] everybody gathers together and there's a
[1:00:41] time of rejoicing it's a time of great
[1:00:44] joy

[1:03:09] and enjoy it
[1:03:10] amen but in the last day of the feast
[1:03:14] and the eighth day there's supposed to
[1:03:16] be a day of great joy rejoicing unlike
[1:03:19] any other day
[1:03:21] a man is supposed to be a day of
[1:03:23] rejoicing where you leave your booth you
[1:03:26] go back into a house that was prepared
[1:03:28] for you a mend and leave the temporary
[1:03:31] dwelling behind and you going back into
[1:03:34] your house and you go to the temple and
[1:03:36] you rejoice or the crops and everything
[1:03:37] that God has provided for you
[1:03:39] amen I was reading I wanted to read as
[1:03:45] reading on a Jewish website they're
[1:03:47] talking about some of the some of the
[1:03:51] ceremonies that they did back in the
[1:03:53] time of Jesus during the Feast of
[1:03:54] Tabernacles amen I want to read this
[1:03:57] little quote here and this came from
[1:03:58] about 2000 years ago said he was talking
[1:04:03] about the water libation ceremony during
[1:04:05] the Feast of Tabernacles so in the Feast
[1:04:08] of Tabernacles every day the priest
[1:04:12] would take a jug of water a jug he would
[1:04:16] go down to the base of the mountain Zion
[1:04:19] and at the base of the Zion there was a
[1:04:22] spring there that spring water would
[1:04:25] come up out him and he would take that
[1:04:26] jug and he'd fill it up with water and
[1:04:29] he go up and he pour it out while
[1:04:31] they're rejoicing on the top of the
[1:04:33] mountain Amen that God was and they were
[1:04:36] supposed to do it with great joy amen
[1:04:39] and so that's what the ceremony they do
[1:04:41] that every day of the feast so they on
[1:04:43] the last day of the feast they take
[1:04:45] seven jugs of water and pour him out in
[1:04:47] a circle around the altar while they're
[1:04:49] dancing and rejoicing amen it says here
[1:04:52] in in these old Jewish writings he says
[1:04:55] whoever has not seen the celebration of
[1:04:58] the water libation has never experienced
[1:05:01] the feeling of true joy he said great
[1:05:05] lamps of gold were hoisted up they have
[1:05:08] these great columns with bowls on top
[1:05:10] and they filled with oil and they are
[1:05:13] light him on fire and they'd be on top
[1:05:16] of Mount Zion and there would be like
[1:05:17] great torches on top of Mount Zion amen
[1:05:21] and he says great lamps of gold or who
[1:05:23] stood with four golden bowls at the top
[1:05:26] of each lamp for young priests and
[1:05:29] training would climb to the top carrying
[1:05:32] immense oil jugs
[1:05:34] which they would fill which would fill
[1:05:36] these bolts and once they were lighted
[1:05:39] there was not a courtyard in all of
[1:05:42] Jerusalem that did not glow with the
[1:05:45] light that emanated from the celebration
[1:05:47] in the temple courtyard every house in
[1:05:50] Jerusalem we all sudden be filled with
[1:05:53] light from the soul of the celebration
[1:05:56] amen
[1:05:58] and the people's as the people saying
[1:06:00] the righteous and pious men would dance
[1:06:03] before them while juggling flaming
[1:06:06] torches the Levites standing on the
[1:06:09] fifteen steps that descend from the
[1:06:11] court of Israel to the women's Court
[1:06:12] would play on the Lear's and the harps
[1:06:15] and the trumpets and many other
[1:06:16] instruments two priests who blew the
[1:06:19] silver trumpets stir at the top of the
[1:06:22] stairs on either side of the entrance of
[1:06:23] the great gate of the court and this was
[1:06:25] done to honor the commandment of the
[1:06:27] water libation what the purpose of the
[1:06:31] water is is they were celebrating that
[1:06:35] every time they needed water God
[1:06:38] provided throughout the entire year all
[1:06:43] of their crops came because God provided
[1:06:46] the water amen and when they would and
[1:06:49] see if the if the what the spring at the
[1:06:52] base of Mount Zion was there because
[1:06:54] when it rained on Mount Zion the water
[1:06:57] would filter down through the mountain
[1:06:59] and pressurized the mountain and when it
[1:07:02] spring out as a little spring at the
[1:07:03] base of the mountain a man sofa quit
[1:07:06] raining the spring would go dry if it
[1:07:11] quit raining that spring would go dry
[1:07:13] but here at the very end when God had
[1:07:17] provided them everything they had need
[1:07:19] of in this life's journey that they go
[1:07:21] down with jugs of water at the spring
[1:07:24] and they would carry it up because it
[1:07:26] was a sign that God had provided them so
[1:07:28] much rain that Mount Zion in the
[1:07:30] mountain itself was filled water and it
[1:07:32] was overflowing and coming springing out
[1:07:34] at the bottom and they come out and they
[1:07:36] pour at the at the poured out on the top
[1:07:39] every day of the feast and the last day
[1:07:41] of the feast the great day they pour out
[1:07:43] seven jugs of water because God provided
[1:07:46] them water every single
[1:07:48] each of all the church ages amen
[1:07:52] God provided and then you need to take
[1:07:54] jugs of oil which came from the olives
[1:07:57] that grew from that water amen and they
[1:08:00] take the olive oil and they pour it in
[1:08:02] the lamps a man they light it on fire as
[1:08:05] giant bowl of flaming oil and they light
[1:08:08] on fire and the light would shine
[1:08:10] throughout all Jerusalem what a sign can
[1:08:14] your spiritual mind grasp this with that
[1:08:17] picture in your mind let's go over to
[1:08:20] John chapter 7 I give out three more
[1:08:33] scriptures here just want to end with
[1:08:40] John chapter 7 verse 1
[1:08:59] after these things Jesus walked in
[1:09:02] Galilee for he would not walk and jury
[1:09:06] because the Jews sought to kill him
[1:09:09] they're trying to kill the fountain of
[1:09:12] everlasting water now the Jews Feast of
[1:09:15] Tabernacles was at hand his brethren
[1:09:19] therefore said unto Him depart hence and
[1:09:22] go into Judea that thy disciples may see
[1:09:25] the works that thou doest but there was
[1:09:26] no man that do us anything in secret and
[1:09:29] he himself seeketh to be known openly if
[1:09:32] thou do these things show thyself to the
[1:09:34] world for a neither did his brethren
[1:09:36] believe him
[1:09:37] and Jesus said unto them my time has not
[1:09:41] yet come but your time is always ready
[1:09:45] the world cannot hate you but me at hate
[1:09:48] ahthe because I testify that the works
[1:09:50] there ever evil go ye up unto this feast
[1:09:53] I go not yet I go not up yet under this
[1:09:57] feast for my time is not yet full come
[1:10:03] look at verse 10 but when his brethren
[1:10:08] were gone up then he went then he also
[1:10:11] went up unto the feast but not openly
[1:10:14] but as it were in secret amen so here
[1:10:19] comes the Feast of the Tabernacles the
[1:10:22] Jews are beginning to celebrate all that
[1:10:26] God has done for him throughout the last
[1:10:28] year God has given them their reign and
[1:10:32] due seasons he has provided them water
[1:10:35] from heaven amen all their crops grew
[1:10:38] but in the midst of this here is Jesus
[1:10:41] Christ the fountain of living waters the
[1:10:44] one that provided them all this water
[1:10:46] for their crops and they are rejecting
[1:10:49] him at the very time that they're
[1:10:51] celebrating God's providence amen and
[1:10:54] that's the situation that we're going to
[1:10:56] now when during this water ceremony
[1:10:59] where they would bring the water up they
[1:11:01] would bring it up chanting Psalms 113
[1:11:05] through 118 so I want to turn back here
[1:11:09] to psalms 118
[1:11:12] solves 113 and 118 were sung at all the
[1:11:17] major feasts and at land of Israel
[1:11:20] amen so Psalms 118 is the very end of
[1:11:26] what they would be singing as they would
[1:11:27] go up let's read from verse 19 as
[1:11:32] they're singing all this and they said
[1:11:34] their singing was they pour out the
[1:11:36] water they say for the 19th verse open
[1:11:41] to me the gates of righteousness I will
[1:11:43] go into them and I will praise the Lord
[1:11:46] this gate of the Lord into which the
[1:11:49] righteous shall enter I will praise thee
[1:11:52] for thou has heard me and arn't become
[1:11:54] my salvation
[1:11:56] amen they sing that they're carrying
[1:11:58] their waters up from the spring they're
[1:11:59] entering into the gates into the court
[1:12:01] and they pour him out at the altar amen
[1:12:04] I will praise thee for thou has heard me
[1:12:07] and art become my salvation the stone
[1:12:10] which the builders refused has become
[1:12:13] the headstone of the corner this is the
[1:12:15] Lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes
[1:12:18] this is the day that the Lord has made
[1:12:20] we will rejoice and be glad in it amen
[1:12:24] now we get to verse 25 he says save now
[1:12:27] that we're safe now as hosanna Amen
[1:12:30] remember when they laid down the palm
[1:12:31] branches in Jerusalem Jesus went in on a
[1:12:34] Colt of a donkey and they are going
[1:12:37] Hosanna Hosanna blessed is he that
[1:12:39] cometh in the name of the Lord amen then
[1:12:42] later on he told the Pharisees you will
[1:12:44] never see me again until you say blessed
[1:12:47] is he that cometh in the name of the
[1:12:49] Lord so let's read verse 25 there again
[1:12:51] saved now I beseech thee O Lord O Lord
[1:12:55] I beseech thee sin now prosperity
[1:12:58] blessed is he that cometh in the name of
[1:13:01] the Lord we have blessed you out of the
[1:13:03] house of Lord amen
[1:13:05] God is the Lord which has showed us
[1:13:07] light bind the sacrifice with cords even
[1:13:10] to the horns of the altar there entering
[1:13:15] into his gates with Thanksgiving there
[1:13:16] entering into the courts with praise
[1:13:18] there bringing the water from the
[1:13:20] fountain amen there saying Hosanna you
[1:13:23] will save us you will give us
[1:13:25] deliverance
[1:13:26] Jesus is there in secret watching all
[1:13:28] this my he was the cornerstone that the
[1:13:36] builders rejected and they're singing
[1:13:38] about it as they're carrying the water
[1:13:40] up as they sing about as they finish
[1:13:42] this chapter then they had pour out the
[1:13:44] water around the altar and where the
[1:13:46] sacrifice was laid for the forgiveness
[1:13:49] of their sins and Jesus is standing
[1:13:51] there watching all this it's incredible
[1:13:55] amen now now with that in mind let's go
[1:13:58] back to John chapter 7
[1:14:11] John chapter 7 verse 37 let's let's read
[1:14:21] from the 33rd verse right there in the
[1:14:24] midst of the Feast of Tabernacles then
[1:14:26] jesus said unto them yet a little while
[1:14:29] I am with you then I go unto him that
[1:14:32] sent me he shall seek me and shall not
[1:14:35] find me where I am thither ye cannot
[1:14:38] come and then Jesus then said the Jews
[1:14:41] unto themselves where shall he go that
[1:14:46] we should not find him let's go down to
[1:14:49] 36 there what manner of saying is this
[1:14:53] that he said ye shall seek me should not
[1:14:55] find me and where I am thither you
[1:14:57] cannot come where is he gonna go
[1:15:00] amen then in the last day this is the
[1:15:04] eighth day that great day of the feast
[1:15:06] Jesus stood and cried this is when they
[1:15:09] pour out the seven jugs of water on the
[1:15:11] altar Jesus stood up and cried and said
[1:15:13] if any man thirst let him come unto me
[1:15:17] and drink he that believeth on me as the
[1:15:19] scripture has said out of his belly
[1:15:21] shall flow rivers of living water but
[1:15:25] this spake he of the Spirit that they
[1:15:28] which believe on him should receive for
[1:15:31] the Holy Ghost was not yet given because
[1:15:33] Jesus was not yet glorified he's giddy
[1:15:38] ready to enter into the Gentile age we
[1:15:41] would be the Feast of Tabernacles the
[1:15:43] seventh days living in our temporary
[1:15:45] Tabernacles amen the fountain of living
[1:15:47] waters there at the base of Jerusalem
[1:15:51] the Mount Zion water would reign on
[1:15:53] Mount Zion
[1:15:54] it would pressurized the mountain now at
[1:15:56] the bottom was spring a well of living
[1:15:58] water and Jesus said I am the fountain
[1:16:01] of living water if anyone thirsts let
[1:16:04] him come to me and drink and you will
[1:16:07] the Holy Spirit will come in and dwell
[1:16:09] inside of you you will become Mount Zion
[1:16:12] and out of your belly will flow the
[1:16:14] fountain of living water just like out
[1:16:16] of the base there amen you will become
[1:16:19] Mount Zion God is turning a corner
[1:16:25] and no longer will you worship here in
[1:16:27] this mountain but you worship Him in
[1:16:28] spirit and in truth
