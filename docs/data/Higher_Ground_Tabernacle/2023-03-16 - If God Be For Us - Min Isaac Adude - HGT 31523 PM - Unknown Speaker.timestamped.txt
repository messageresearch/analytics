[33:49] him and to thank him for everything that
[33:51] he has done for us
[33:52] hey man let's go straight to the word
[33:54] and open our Bibles in the Book of
[33:56] Daniel chapter 3.
[33:59] we read the verse 15 and verse to the
[34:02] verse 18.
[34:06] Daniel chapter 3 verse 15 to verse 18.
[34:21] the Bible said uh now if he be ready
[34:25] that at what time you hear the sound of
[34:28] the Cornet the flute the ARP the
[34:31] suckbutt
[34:32] the Sultry and the
[34:35] in all kinds of music You Fall Down and
[34:38] Worship the image which I have made
[34:41] well but if you worship not you shall be
[34:45] cast the same hour into the midst of the
[34:48] burning fiery furnace and who is that
[34:51] God that's a delivery out of my hands
[34:56] verse 16 the Bible continue to see the
[34:58] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego answered
[35:01] and said to the king o NATO we are not
[35:06] careful to answer thee in this matter
[35:09] if a bit so our God whom we serve is
[35:13] able to Deliver Us From The Burning Fire
[35:15] furnace and he will deliver us out of
[35:19] thine hand O King but if not begin known
[35:23] unto thee O King that we will not serve
[35:26] thy Gods nor worship the golden image
[35:29] which thou has set up
[35:33] amen uh let's turn again to Romans
[35:36] chapter 8.
[35:43] Romans chapter 8 verse 28 to
[35:46] 34.
[35:54] Romans 8 uh 28-34
[36:00] the Bible says
[36:02] and we know that all things work
[36:05] together for good to them that love God
[36:08] to them who are called according to his
[36:11] purpose
[36:12] verse 29 for whom he did for new
[36:15] he also did predestiness for whom he did
[36:19] for no
[36:20] he also did predestinate to become
[36:23] to be confirmed to the image of Islam
[36:26] that he might be the firstborn among
[36:29] many Brethren moreover whom he did
[36:31] predestinate them he also called and
[36:34] whom he called them he also justified in
[36:37] whom he justified them he also glorified
[36:40] verse 31 what shall we then say to these
[36:44] things if God before us who can be
[36:47] against us
[36:50] his own son but delivered him up for us
[36:54] all how shall he not with him so freely
[36:58] give us all things
[37:00] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[37:03] God's elect it is God that justifieth
[37:07] who is he that condemneth
[37:11] it is Christ that died yet rather
[37:15] Daddy's reason again who is even at the
[37:19] right hand of God who also maketh
[37:22] intercession for us

[40:33] the king as the story tells us that the
[40:35] king told them to worship that that
[40:37] gravity
[40:40] and if they don't do it there will be
[40:43] cursed into the Pharisees
[40:45] the Bible says that they respond and
[40:48] saying that the god that we served
[40:52] amen we believe that he will be able to
[40:54] free us from
[40:57] amen if he doesn't do it but we will
[40:59] never worship yourself
[41:02] even if he doesn't do it we will die
