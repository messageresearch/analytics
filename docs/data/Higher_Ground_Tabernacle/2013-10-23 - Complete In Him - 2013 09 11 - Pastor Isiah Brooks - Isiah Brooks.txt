TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we're going to ask that you turn with us I've got so many places I would love to uh let's turn to Hebrews 11 and 40. this is a a series and of course I won't be able to finish this tonight this is basically a foundational type of message that I'll be preaching tonight and uh we want you from there to turn with us to second Colossians I mean Colossians 2 10 and then second Peter 1 amen so Hebrews 11 40. amen God Heaven provided some better things for us that they without us should not be made perfect you love the Lord Colossians 2 10. uh amen Colossians 2 and 10 and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and Power amen second Peter please first chapter we'll start reading at the fourth verse according as his divine power let's let's read the second verse I'm sorry Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord I really want you to really take note at Peter what he's saying here Grace and peace amen because he's getting ready to deliver something that uh is a powerful thing we don't have to fret a worry but we should be consistent according as his divine power have given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue now I want you to see where Peter's coming he says according as his divine power his divine power have given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to his to glory and virtue now if you could just hold that right there and flip to the 11th verse of the same chapter for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly on into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and I want you to know that this 11th verse could not be fulfilled completely until all day we need a Malachi for five we need an Elijah and I bring that out in the message how that Elijah brother Branham of our day was given that Ministry of entrance where we would know how to enter because remember a man that uh Matthew 25 uh we realized we had five wives and five foolish but the five went in the Bible never told us other how they got there other than that they had oil and extra okay oil and extra oil amen that's what makes the difference between us and denominationals is because God in this last day gave us extra oil all right let's go back amen whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partaker of the divine nature have an escape having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust so by having the divine nature of being partakers of it that means God give each and every one of us apart amen and by having this we escape uh the corruption that is in the world through lust and understand he just uses plural lust because his lust is the flesh loves to the eye and pride of life and beside this giving all diligence to your faith virtue into virtue knowledge into knowledge Temperance into Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charities for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that likes these things is blind and cannot see a far off and have forgotten that he was purged from his sins wherefore the rather Brethren give diligent to make your calling and elections sure for if you do these things you shall never fall foresaw an entrance shall be ministered I love that unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ now let us pray Heavenly Father God we come before you Lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for your Mighty grace and mercy and love that you have bestowed upon us father we come here to lift you up and to glorify your Holy Name there are no words to express our gratitude for the love divine that have been ministered unto us through your servant Elijah and father we thank you right now for the words of life in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I like to entitle this message uh complete in him completion is my theme wherein we realize by the grace of God that they cannot be perfect without us you know that really struck me in my studying and I really believe that it is just the season that we're living in we have heard and I want you to go home by the grace of God at some point in time and listen to Statue of a perfect man listen carefully amen because I really believe that that's the season that we're living in everything else is gathering and I believe that the Bride of Jesus Christ is gathering too you see uh the the denominational churches cannot produce a people for a rapture uh because the Rapture amen will consist of people who are without spot wrinkle and blemish I often wondered what that really was amen and how was that going to be possible for those of us who were born sinful and of sinful flesh but in Peter Peter is basically telling us that in this last day that God will fill you amen completely with his divine nature because he is the only one who was without spot wrinkle or blemish amen that is the only way that we can make a Rapture it doesn't mean that we uh won't be saved because the five foolish was saved they were complete as the five wise were complete now I want you to know something that God has shown me tonight amen according to James 1 and 4. it says but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing amen so we understand calling and crying out for these Virtues Of Christ doesn't mean that they're going to come instantaneously but we understand as our brother Branham have said that every virtue is a victory there is a conquering of self self pride self uh uh Ambitions self everything that comes with self it is a conquering of self is that right amen and so we realize by the grace of God Amen that we are living in oh my the most exciting age of of all times we realize amen that God has done a mighty work Amen in our day and you know as the prophet of God said on that message he said you ought to seek these virtues every day every day until you are completely filled or satisfied or you can see it amen living its way through you it will not be something a man that you will mistaken it will be the literal life of Christ Living in you now I'm going to throw some things out because he said listen before these things can be added to you you must first be born again now I know what people say uh but they you know that I've had a many uh ways I've heard people say it but you know I asked the Lord and I says God I said now if I wanted to know exactly what to do uh in order to make a Rapture seeing that you have a ordained brother Branham uh to uh Minister this to us I said to myself you know what if I've got one tape what what if just one book or one tape is given to me which tape would it be and the Lord showed me the Statue of a perfect man uh and when I said that I asked that today I've heard it I've had Witnesses amen but personally I needed to know because I realize amen there's so much in there that personally I had myself missed salvation in itself come by way of election this is not something that you and I can manufacture it is not something that you can put on like brother Branham said you know a black bird trying to put in peacock feathers it is beyond any human effort that this thing is actually done so I want to just have to take my time tonight and like I said this is almost this is somewhat like the foundation I tried to uh by the grace of God really a minister Sunday morning and evening uh just to get it all cleared out but I'm so glad that you all who are here can hear about the grace of God what the Lord has in store for us in Isaiah 66 and 1 it said thus said the Lord the heaven is my throne and the Earth is my footstool where is the house that you build unto me and where is the place of my rest for all those things have mine handmade and all those things have been said the Lord but to this man will I look even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit and tremble it at my word first of all a man you there there's a condition I believe that the Holy Spirit has to get each and every one of us into and that condition is a poor and contrite spirit and one who can truly tremble or fear the word of the Lord now if you would just turn with me by the grace of God to James 4 2 you say well Lord maybe you would say well God I've been praying and you know I'm not there yet well it all depends on what you're praying for we're not here praying to be greater than one or the other uh but we're we're we're we're praying that God's word will be made manifest in US see we're not in the seventh age but this message brings us into what brother Branham called The Eternal age you can say the eighth age however you want to say it but brother Branham basically said it is an eternal age right amen so this age that we have been birthed into is eternal amen amen so anyway let's go on to James 4 2. it says let us start at the first verse for which come Wars and findings among you come they not his even of your lust that you warn your members ye lust and you have not you killed and desire to have and cannot obtain you fight in war and yet you have not because you ask not so our condition that we're now standing in is not because God's word has failed us but our motive and our objectives in life have been the cause of our condition now if you really want God the Bible said that if we ask in faith God would give it to you liberally and he will not upgrade right in other words God is waiting on us to ask amen not only to ask but to receive amen see because we have been so guilty in the past of listening to The Prophet's message and walking away and just saying is good but the prophet of God also preached the message hearing receiving and acting so how in the world we're going to act on what God would have us to bring forth now you and I realized by the grace of God that you must first have the seed because without the seed it cannot be a production of Christ it won't work it's like going to the soil of a place expecting an apple tree when the seed was never planted so the seed has to be planted in you and that seed must have had been planted amen before the foundation of the world now it's the seed in you because I want you to understand it's the seed in you and brother Branham goes along in the second coming he says and I'll give you an Akon and you have an econ tree potentially but it's in the seed form you cannot say you have actually got a tree and to the seed has produced a tree hello somebody so how you understand the Tree of Life must be produced in you it can't just remain in seed form right now once the life is quickened in you that means that seed has now began to grow brother random said in that sea we have everything everything to make a rapture see so God didn't even leave it in your hands he placed it in the sea but if the seed is in there it will cause you to act and behave in a certain way right so I want to say by the grace of God that listen because you're thirsting for more righteousness that is such a great thing but you don't just thirst without seeking for the water right you don't just stars for righteousness and said I'm thirsty and you're not seeking for more of it right because here Amen in the message time of a decision he said the word of God is a seed and a seed is planted in the ground and if that seed is watered it's spring forth into life if it's a germanized seed Jesus said the word was a seed then if the seed was falling into your heart and you watered that seed by faith believing it'll bring forth just after its kind or you can put it on record and after 30 years of preaching I can say this that I have never one time sincerely ever asked God for anything and committed it to him he either give it to me or he told me why he couldn't do it and if you take the right mental attitude toward any Divine promise God has made it'll bring it to pass so if you look at Peter and add to your faith virtue knowledge all if you take the right mental attitude behind it amen here he says God will bring it to pass if you just simply say it's God's word it's not for me to try to figure it out that's God's business he spoke it that's all's necessary something will take place if there has been any to the glory of honor of God I have no education to be a preacher and God knows I'm not a Healer so he's basically saying I've done nothing other than take God at his word and because there's a seed in it it was quick and it was dramatized and it brought forth oh my God oh let me read another one tokun and when anything sealed inside of a seal you better not break it can't break it you not God's seal no for you uh you grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed into the day of your Redemption and when the body's raised up it's a seed a sign that's the seed has been germanized with eternal life Zoe my own life and I raise it up at the last day and as you walk you have confidence that the Life of Christ is in you and you are in him by one Spirit we're baptized into one body and shield there by the Holy Ghost among disbelievers like this until the day that Jesus raises us up apply the token that what is mean to us we expect the sacrifice to give us life and it does then it gives us a token and we apply the token which is sealed see being partakers of this seal remember the scripture said we first believed we receive the Holy Ghost and then was sealed so you got to understand this is a process and a tree doesn't grow overnight but you've got to realize that those who make a Rapture in this day will be those who are mature who are crowned with Divine love don't get nervous because if you ordained to it nothing can make you I can't keep you from it right come on somebody now listen he this is what brother random said he says listen I have obtained this faith and I'm addressing this to them that has obtained the like Precious faith is not to the outside world this is to the church those that are in Christ and explaining Peter he said Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and through of Jesus Christ Our Lord according as his divine power has given unto us all things his divine power now has given unto us all things now watch this because every Church age had a virtue but in this age all things all of the virtues have been given to the Bride of Jesus Christ oh come on somebody it was only in this age all things pertaining to Jesus Christ could be given this is the only age and so therefore we needed an Elijah we needed a Ministry that could show us how to obtain these things that Peter is talking about right because most churches said if you just believe you know they say well you know you don't have to do all of that you know you saved by grace you know in some ways they're right but let me tell you something if you don't follow the message of your hour you're going to be left behind and when I say follow I don't mean mentally I mean step by step by step remember I said the other night amen it is the Shepherd that leads it is the sheep that follow right nothing gets ahead of the shepherd except the goat right come on everything else Lee the shepherd the Sheep the shepherd the Sheep I read that to you last week and so you and I must understand that God has an order right uh come on somebody yeah I that I'm glad you're keeping it low because I don't want to preach I want to teach just like this here whereby we are given unto given unto us a seemingly great and precious promises that by these we might be partakers of the divine nature now let that salt real deep now preaching this we're just teaching this lesson divine nature right we are giving unto us a seemingly great and precious promises that by these we might be partakers of his divine nature now I want to say this by the grace of God because we've had seven Church ages seven angels Seven Virtues and seven is completion and the word of God said we are complete in him right so the very things that so you can't say these virtues cannot be obtained you've got ages that have already done it those who made up the bride in each age obtain that virtue that's why I hear a Paul tells us they cannot be complete in Hebrew they cannot be complete because we are the ones that actually the literal Capstone comes down on WE display Divine love which seals in all the other Church Ages come on somebody amen and when we seal see they can't we say well Lord let the Rapture come they can they can't get up they cannot even come back until you and I are displaying Divine love you and I we're the holdup and you know why because we're not seeking him every day that thing hit me and struck me so hard Lord help me to seek you every day add to me Lord see because the Bible said can any man add a cubit to a statue you know if we could do that we'd go Zoo we'll finish it off but you see the greatest victories are the of the greater the battle the suite of the victory and God put us in this place to be tried and tested remember I told you amen when tried in the fire you've been invited the Bible said if come on go be tried in the fire and you say yes Lord so you answered that call because you recognized you were gold only the gold could recognize it right only the gold could respond to the invitation oh come on somebody that that makes me feel good he meant to know that I'm gold and I've come this way so the fire can prove that I'm gold all the tests go come the trial is going to come that's all right it's for ordained it's predestinating if Ephesus made it I can make it if Smyrna made it I can make it all the way down if if Philadelphia made it I can make it come on somebody why because they could not have made it either without Grace and peace um every Christian he says I'm an old veteran he said look at brother and sister kid here they're probably oldest in the building but if I ask them what is your harsh desire they'd say it it'll be closer to God see when you learn to when you learn of Christ there's something about him that's so loving you just try to get right into him excuse this expression I told my wife here not long ago both getting old and I said it to hers do you love me like you used to and she said I certainly do and I said you know I love you so much till I would like to take you and pull you inside of me so we would just be really one he said boy he says now multiply that listen a hundred million and then you'll find out how that the believer Who falls in love with Christ want to get into him because it's a love now I'ma tell you that's a thirst that's a desire that will not leave you until it's done my daughter Clara is pregnant and she was telling me about those cravings and you know she loved to exercise and she thought she was right now and she said when she got pregnant it caught her by uh surprise and the first thing she said Daddy did this and daddy did because I have been crying out to the Lord fix it give her a child and God did it hello somebody now my thing was amen she says daddy you know these Cravings she'd probably get mad at me for telling this she said these Cravings she says not only did I go by uh Chipotle and get me was one Sam and she said I got me two just in case I might want the second one later And she said Oh Daddy she said and think about it I had such a desire for Taco Bell now all she says I know this is wrong and maybe I'm expressing my fat feelings but what it is there's a life in there we're not like craves I asked my daughter in this sense it's so strong you've got to do something about it and she says nothing else will satisfy come on somebody that's how it is with God nothing else would satisfy that craving that's on the inside that's thirst to be just like him nothing nothing but one Soul what's so wonderful about my brothers the Bible said to you thirst and hunger for righteousness you shall be filled hey is that a promise or not that is truly the promises of God the thing about it is we must learn how to respect you know there's no respect to or for the things of God that's the problem you know we have hearted sacrifices given to the Lord I think about it and I was reading the scripture and I thought to myself Lord show me what this is all about Emma read it to you somehow I I missed what chapter I got it from uh you can look it up if you like if you write a few words down he that killeth and aren't a man I shall lamb as if he cut off a dog's neck he that offered oblation as if he offers swines blood he that burneth incense as if he's blessed and Idol yay they have chosen their own ways and their soul delighted in their Abominations I also would choose their delusions it would bring their fears upon them because when I call none did answer when I spake they did not hear but they did even before mine eyes and chose that in which I Delight not hear with the word of the Lord hear the word of the Lord ye that tremble at his word your brethren that hated you that cast you out for my name's sake said let the Lord be glorified but he shall appear to your joy and they shall be ashamed a voice of noise from the city a voice from the temple a voice of the Lord that rendereth recompense to his enemy and the Bible tells us by the grace of God listen what is it oftentimes we come in church we give him halfway praises oh come on somebody it's true we we offer up something that you know is equivalent to slaying a man or you know bringing in a dog or you know what I mean something that and that's the way he looks at it when there is no joy in it there's no uh you know excitement or you know uh uh uh uh uh being thankful or grateful this is the way God looks at it and really when you're in that condition condition you're not serving God you're serving yourself listen coming from a quote that the statue I got get the birth into you and it will add itself see think it's some kind of a hoax there's something fixed up between them they can't understand it until that man is born again then when he's born again then he's in line of Fellowship because he's a new creature creation that old suspicious doubting character he was is dead now he's a new creation so you see he don't have to add anything to his his now because it's automatically be added notice you must be born again and when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith that's right so you see on my chart here I got the very Foundation faith is the foundation of it all for without faith it's impossible to please God he that coming to God must believe that he is and reward of those that diligently seek him wait a minute he's a rewarder of those that diligence seek him now if Jacob had to wrestle with the angel to change his walk what do you think you got to do amen what do you think you got to do somebody said well can I lose my salvation no if it was real the first time you can but that's the thing you got to make sure it's real come on somebody see he must be and when you are skeptic of the Bible when you're skeptic of the word being right you just might as well stay back until first you believe it who listen you got to look at Peter and you got to say Lord this is me this is mine and I keep praying and praying and praying and praying till I see these things added to me because you got to understand it's the Holy Ghost that puts his approval because every time we think we got something we make a mess and I'm gonna say it like this that's way down down the road on my notes but a chain is only strong at his weakest link wherever you weak at that's where Satan breaks it and you know what it's like a domino effect y'all ever seen breeze on the string and break and go everything all those bees that's been added on that string break and Scatter why because at that point of weakness it destroyed the whole thing and that's why often time you feel like you're not a Christian because at that weak link is where Satan keeps getting you and he scatters everything else and guess what you got to start adding the bees all up again that's it and you see by the grace of God that's all right just don't ever give up you don't give up you keep adding adding adding adding adding and how do you add by faith and prayer right cause you can't do it the Bible said what have what house what house can you build me he said listen no no house he said the heavens is my it's my throne and Earth is my footstool he said but you have prepared prepared a body so God has prepared you how is he going to prepare you first of all he's got to bring the fire if we're going to abide behind in between the cherubins you got to have all this worldly stuff out of you but God is able if you pray amen right I'll never forget a brother Bible said those foolish version ass you know uh uh the wise give me of your all they say you go pray up you go pray up it's in prayer that's why Satan robs us that's where he robs him because he knows that the weakest Saint if they fall on their knees amen they can whip the devil that's the word any time any place any condition anywhere so down on your knees is where you get your victory amen nobody don't have to tell you where you're coming short all of us know as individuals we know where we're coming short what you're going to do about it when you realize the saints of God the Bible said we are encompassed about we're so great a cloud of witness they're cheering and says come on boy yeah you can do better come on they're cheering us on looking at us and says we can't move until you move God chose you to be the cream of the cream of the crowd come on somebody that's why the devil fights us we're in the worst age there ever was but God is using the greatest weapon he have a kid and that's the word that's why the word had to be restored had to be until you come and you and I come listen you can't even go up to up the scale without having faith in the word Now understand listen brother I'm saying now he says listen he goes and talks about he did not come to build an organization Christ never sent me to build an organization Christ me to build individuals to the statue of Jesus Christ that might be the powerhouse now I I've read you that the 11th verse the entrance he says listen I was ordained to fulfill that scripture who I was ordained to feel that scripture dwelling listen he said Jesus Christ that he might be the PowerHouse Dwelling Place of His Holy Spirit by his word uh-huh by his word built of an individual to that place not build an organization a great denomination but build the individual to Sons and Daughters of God he says that's the idea see add to your faith virtue to your virtue now add knowledge well now come on to a place now when they began to say well we don't have to accept that today you do have to it must be the scriptures cannot lie there are no private interpretation the Bible said you just believe it the way it is written there see you've got to have these things and the only way you'll ever be able to have them is to have heaven-born knowledge here it is see that's why he says I was out there in the woods he said and I waited for God to give me this see it was Heaven bone he said I couldn't preach that I I couldn't that ain't me God had to put the scriptures together and now I've got those heaven-born knowledge and I'm giving it to you here is the entrance you want to make a Rapture here it is there are no private interpretation anyway there's no private interpretation the Bible said you and us believe it the way it is written here see heaven-bone knowledge heaven-born knowledge will vindicate the word see you've got to believe now not make believe none of these are make beliefs see if you try to say uh don't be a blackbird putting pecan peacock feathers in yourself because they'll fall right out they're not naturally grown in there so you must understand the supernatural God must be supernaturally grown if I could put it that way it must supernaturally allow itself to be expressed because she says now listen you've got to understand that even uh uh uh uh uh Christian Science can show all of these things almost all of these kind of Virtues and things like that but you see they can't come all the way up they always will have a weak link why and it's put on Mind Over Matter but I tell you slap a man hard enough I tell you what he'll forget his Christian Science he will he'll forget his Christian Science but if it's God he'll turn the other chief come on somebody that's the kind we want we don't want the the kind we practice we want the kind that lives like brother Brandon said there's got to be seven live voices oh I love this the Bible says don't you worry about it talk about Israel now seventh verse here it says before she travails she brought forth but for her pain came she was delivered of a man-child who have heard such a thing who have seen such a things shall the Earth be made to bring forth in one day or shall a nation be born at once for as for as soon as Zion travaileth she brought forth her child how come on somebody oh so it's like this ah any woman in here know what prevailing is huh y'all know what travailing is it's going to take something but soon as you prevent it ain't going to take that long but you got to get to the place that you wanted so much till you travail for it shall I bring to the birth and not cause to bring forth so if God put a desire in you to come to this and then cause you not to have it no no no no no I know he's talking about a nation but he's talking about us too in just a moment you'll see listen he says cause cause you to bring forth says the Lord shall I cause to bring forth and shut the wound said thy law thy God Rejoice you with Jerusalem and be glad with her all you that love her Rejoice for Joy with her all you that moan for her that ye may suck and be satisfied with the breast of her consolations that you may milk out and be delighted with the abundance of her glory y'all know what milk out is have you all ever seen a baby amen when that baby milk out all he's look like he's seeing angels and stars and everything I mean his eyes are just battening he's smiling from ear to ear he's milked out that's the way it is supposed to be a Christian come on somebody amen you and I supposed to milk out on the words Hallelujah for thus said the Lord behold I will extend peace to her like a river and the glory of the Gentiles like a flooring stream then shall she suck she shall be born upon her side and be dangled upon her knees and as one whose mother confident so will I comfort you and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem and who is Jerusalem the Bride of Jesus Christ she is the Jerusalem is that right come on somebody listen Psalms 127 1 says accept the Lord build the house they labor in Lane that build it except the Lord keep the city The Watchmen Wicked but in vain hello it is God who's keeping God who's God who's building the house he's still a carpenter son come on somebody and he still he laid the foundation amen zeruba said that same stone that was rejected God had made the head of the corner now the Lord belonging and shaping the heart why at of all times and all day when the prophet of God was on the scene he brought out the scripture as a man thinketh in his heart so is he he said theologians scientists and all thought that scripture was wrong because they say man thinketh in his head he said but science has discovered that in the heart of a man is a small little place about the size of a pinhead that has no blood vessels and he says that's where God abides see you don't need a whole lot of him you just need to live here hi come on all you need is a pinhead whatever it is think about it that little computer chip controls everything so you look at this he says listen all you need is that and let that be a pure seed if that seed is pure it'll bring forth pure God hello now God is powerful because he said a mustard seed and he likened himself as a mustard seed amen and he said that Mustard Seed is pure but look at the tree it brings forth huh the Bible said that Mustard Seed grows up to be one of the largest trees there is and every fowl of the air come in large in it come on somebody because I'm gonna tell you something about the Seal of the Holy Ghost amen that seal is recognized coming and going now let me get here just a minute give me a few minutes I'm not going to keep you long because I want you to really hold to what I said tonight like I said this is the foundation of what I want to finish ministering on Sunday if the Lord tariff not I'll keep going until then now first of all we understand you got to recognize it and you got to understand amen that you can't remain where you are none of us can remain where we are the whole point about this message is for you to examine yourself to see whether you be in the faith if you are in the faith then you ought to realize and recognize Lord or ask God where am I wait usually you don't have to ask you that you wouldn't have to ask him that because all of us know if you're still getting hot tempered that means you ain't you you'll be low temperance that means right you're below temperance if you still getting upset and carrying on like you yeah you still you're below tempers but that's okay maybe you got knowledge because I'm gonna show you by the grace of God wherever the weak link is is that where you that's where you're breaking before you can get Perfection you got to conquer that ooh Faith nah let me put it this way folks let me let me say like this how many look through the Old Testament was it Gideon who won the war or was it God who won the world forget him did David win the wars or was The God Who won the wars for David did Joshua win the walls no or was it God that won the war for Joshua see it was a promise and all Joshua David and Gideon had to do is believe what God Said and God made him a winner and all you got to do is believe what God Said and God will make you a winner Paul said we're more than conquered through Christ Jesus our lord thank God who gives us the victory so we have not because we asked not faith is a foundation right Peter stars are with faith right because you can't even start the building until the foundation is laid and the foundation is you must be born again right ain't no reason you're starting you must be born again of the water and of the spirit right come on somebody now we're not life you said well brother when does it really take place understand when that life comes in you because the word of God can't lie the life comes in you when you says Lord Jesus I accept you as my personal savior Jesus said at that time you have passed from Death unto life at that time you have passed from Death of the life you still as dirty as filthy as you've ever been but in there is a life that's going to change you if you feed it that's your that's your foundation you see a lot of people die at that point because they won't continue to feed it right but you see if you are absolutely elected God says ooh this is what I was telling somebody the other day I said I don't care nothing about no Greek in Hebrew that ain't what gives me life the Bible said the Holy Ghost will lead you and guide you into all truth not the dictionary or the commentary or the whatever area is just Jesus the Holy Ghost I I come on if I can't read or write I'll steal more no more than the theologians everyone that have gotten their doctorate degree amen why because I got the Holy Ghost and they don't no sir the Bible said the Holy Ghost will lead when somebody come with your Greek stop them right there because they confused about this Holy Ghost they don't know nothing about it why because you gotta in order to understand the scriptures you got to be born let me say it like this who understand God but God and an eagle understand an eagle because it's got the same life and you'll understand God because you got the same life Faith so you got to be born again you got to have God on the inside right that's where your foundation starts right it's way before baptism baptism is just the outward show that you've accepted the Lord Jesus Christ in your heart yet it's still necessary just as necessary as commune is that right so you can't even go any further if you don't have the baptism you're right there at Faith that's as far as your house has been built virtue and I think there's a lot to it and I'm gonna hit this back and forth back and forth virtue is strength and power must be able to give it out you must have it before you can give it out right because remember the woman amen who touched Jesus Jesus turned and said who touched me said virtue has gone out of me brother when he was here he had virtue because the Bible they tell us amen there were many times he almost couldn't even make it to his seat because he was so weak virtue is the power of God it's the strength of God even scientists have said that when people lay hands on the sick they have seen the light of God leave them and go to another person scientists know it's true hello somebody and you can't have virtue or even know that you got it without having faith that you have it oh I feel like I got virtue no I got virgin because he's in there is his virtue not mine that's why the prophet God said Jesus never healed one person he said I can't do nothing except the father show me and neither you or neither me I no nobody Jesus Christ is the Healer right now here it is knowledge knowledge to judge whether it's right or wrong see the word is right and every man be alive the Bible don't contradict itself you must get rid of everything that is scripturally scripture that isn't scripturally scriptural based I don't care how real it seems right for instance you have women preachers and all of them say God visited them all of them say that unseen visions and everything else and that's why they're there and the Bible says according to the knowledge of the word they are not supposed to preach it right so where do you go with the signs the Wonders the visions and the experience remember in this last day in Elijah time amen 400 prophets was deceived Pentecostal Brethren deceived because they rested on experience and not the word is that okay help us Lord the word is the revelation of Jesus Christ he keeps all of his promises don't need education from theological School the Holy Ghost will lead and guide me into all truth I'm leaving it right there that's knowledge knowledge to know that the word is right and it doesn't need an interpreter because God is his own interpreter interpreter right temperance mean Holy Spirit Temperance how to control I know y'all tongue not be a Tattler and fly off when somebody offends you yay yep that's where we need it you haven't gone no further than that you steal that knowledge so you got to get some Temperance in order to have Temperance he's got to seal it in you there's got to be some victories some hot fires getting all up in your face right it's the truth thank God in Jesus face and the Bible said he was like a sheep dumb wouldn't open his mouth that's the life that got to be present in US not just present but revealed or a manifest excuse me right not a toddler girl let me tell you and and women too nowadays you know they talk just as much they do amen come on somebody and when someone offends you right when you rail upon when you're railed upon and you're rail not back somebody really railing on you don't say nothing if you're going to say anything bless them bless those that curse you that's Jesus's word right you know here it is I'm gonna tell you something I have been so guilty because sometimes God gives you secrets hello he says listen he said if you come into your secret closet I'll tell you things secretly means if a secret Angels voting down nobody he didn't tell everybody he told you and how many times you try to tell people secrets and they don't know nothing about what you're trying to tell them because you ain't supposed to tell them I'm guilty you think they're going to rejoice come on somebody y'all can at least say amen God that's the truth we all are guilty all right I said Secrets now there's a difference between praise and all that I'm talking about secrets and sometimes people don't even want to hear that but anyway let's go on y'all all right with that I come listen listen in Temperance we have one thing and that is when somebody call you names like I said the other day I had people calling me two days to distract and then I was running the other day and I was crossing the street and I was still somewhere like on the edge with the rocks and the man said I saw it I felt it coming get on the sidewalk I like you know what I said you move over see and guess what just as soon as I did that the Holy Ghost says wrong because the college for the street right somehow I should have made just kept my mouth shut and just praise God y'all understand what I'm saying so but God showed me it's a good thing when God show you amen where you're wrong so you says Lord have mercy forgive me Lord cleanse me strengthen me brother random use the word vulcanized because every every uh uh uh uh uh virtue seals itself to the other and it strengthens it strengthens each other right so we look at these things and and understand that when you got faith virtue and knowledge that God's word is amen amen amen amen nothing contradicts it's true it's going to give you temperance is that all right and it's going to also give you patience see because our thing when you really know God's word is true you learn how to wait this is where the prophet of God says not only just patient is but he says patient patience with God patience with God it ain't just winning on each other we know we got a little of that but most of our problem comes from not being patient with God genuine Faith give genuine patience and Noah listen I want you to understand every one of these virtues operate by faith every one of them will operate by faith they can't even move without it you got to First believe that God's gonna give you all this the Bible said of men who come to God first believe that he is God and that he's a rewarder but it's going to reward you for what are you going to God for the Bible said it's a throne of grace so therefore you aren't you don't you don't you don't have to worry about whether you married it or not it's already unmerited favor for you it is Grace so he gives you that opportunity to come listen you and I will really have a rough time if God had to say well why didn't you do it I gave you everything you ever needed to make it I made it as easy as I possibly could for you and why didn't you do it don't tell me it's not easy the problem is we don't want to die to ourselves this old lazy flesh don't want to buckle the knees right this old lazy flesh and I tell you what we can run to wherever we want to run won't even worry about time especially when they come to shopping and but when it comes down to prayer huh oh it's true we can fellowship with each other for hours and with Jesus is only 10-15 minutes if that much ain't no travail in there no travailing now listen and I I'm not going to worry you because I'm going to stop right here on patience because I don't want to finish all of this I want you to go home and I want you to listen if you got a way of listening to Statue of perfect man so when I come you'll be spiritually ready amen patience patience with God genuine Faith give genuine patience Noah have patience with God for what 120 years oh Lord out listen I'm gonna have to say it God give me the Holy Ghost did you repent will you baptize the name of Lord Jesus Christ then wait on it they had to wait and you do too maybe your weight is a little longer but he promised it see so the devil came through me now I ain't gonna get it yes I am he promised it I don't care how long it took it took no 120 years he waited you know brother I said God attest you too he told Norris I'm gonna shut the door let the people know he's gonna rain no one say oh boy it's gonna rain it's gonna happen it's gonna happen he told me and listen with the door shut and God waited seven more days seven days no I look really silly but he believed God yep he never thought well made out maybe I made a mistake and I need to come up out of Desire Hallelujah but God made sure he didn't because it was God who shut the door Hallelujah see he was predestinated to take that trip and so are you you and I are predestinated to make a Rapture and God will lead you to it or he's going to drive you and you don't want him to drive you down but he's more than able to do it right if it's not here today it will be here tomorrow right when it comes to Healing deliverances whatever the case may be listen I'm not trying to tell you to manufacture something if it ain't there amen's healing sickness whatever it is you go to the doctor yeah I just read what brother Brown said you know there's a lady who actually believed that going to the doctor was sinful he says not so it is not a sin and you know what he eventually told that lady go take your medicine there's a balance to this thing folks but the devil will make you think you're not even a Christian because you don't believe in medicine hello Jesus could have spoke to that woman but he took spittle and Clay I'm that man and put put in that eye Jesus could have said you're healed but he said go wash in the pool us along see there must have been something in there that would if it wasn't just obedience something so God has more than one method of healing and delivering y'all love the Lord God will try your patience make you wait a little longer than you expect to right see there will come a resurrection some may sleep but there will be one right think about it everybody throughout the ages had to wait wait can you actually be the Hebrew boys waiting on God and God still ain't answering and you're approaching the fire yeah but they said even if he don't deliver us we know he's able see that's the attitude that's the right attitude oh my God you yeah I'm gonna wait on God no matter what and listen I'm a you that's that's where we've gotta we've got to understand that the promises that God is true we can look back and say he kept everyone one of one of them every age has been kept by God every one of them and God will not leave this this age undone there will be divine love manufacture uh manifest excuse me in a bride there will be ain't no answer but about it it might not be a great number but there will be those and I'm so thankful to say I'm one of them let's stand I wish I could quiz you right now to see how many of us understood what's being said because I want you to understand by the grace of God what did I say the victory is on your knees now you gotta fight the devil to get on your knees I don't care whether you feel it feeling got nothing to do with it it'd be good to feel it but if you don't feel it you stay there you talk to him because you know he hears you come on somebody you think God can't hear you on your knees when you can hear what's in your head every thought that goes through your head God hears it come on somebody I might can't hear but he hears every bit of it whether it's good or bad come on somebody and I'm telling you right now people he's waiting on us he's waiting on us amen if we've been disconnected if we've got out of line get back in line I have you know when you see yourself amen you've drifted on this side and maybe this and that whenever you find yourself doubting something that God has said already listen the thing is to repent get on your knees everything because this is not a man this is not a message this is not an hour of private interpretation everybody in this area everybody got a private interpretation of what they think the word means that's why God had to send a prophet with the right interpretation because it wasn't his like I said a prophet is like a eunuch he has no seed only God speaks through him he's built that way you love God Heavenly Father God we come before you as humbly as we know how Lord we thank you for your goodness we thank you for your grace Lord we believe that we have your Holy Spirit but we also know there's a growing period there is a maturing Lord and father that's what we are here for tonight that you put such a hunger and thirst in your people that after tonight they will seek you every day oh until the fullness of Christ is made manifested in them this is not a group thing Lord this is the individual thing and I pray father God that you would do just that for us tonight granted in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen to be like Jesus to be like Jesus on Earth our long to be like him all through life Journey from Earth to Glory I only have to be like it to be like Jesus to be like Jesus on Earth our Lord to be like him Glory I only am to be like him to Love Like Jesus to Love Like Jesus foreign I owe I only amen I just want to stress one thing it is the grace of God that God gives us space to repent amen because remember amen he gave Jezebel space to repent and she wouldn't do it so think about the grace of God that he gives us space to repent and when he gives us that space we must repent lest we become like Jezebel amen you love the Lord he always will give you that space but you've got to take advantage of it
