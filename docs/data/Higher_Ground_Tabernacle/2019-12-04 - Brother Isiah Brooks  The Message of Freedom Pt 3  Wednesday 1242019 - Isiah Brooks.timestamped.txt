[11:49] God gave me the grace to write that song
[11:51] years ago so it's amazing they got in

[11:59] forgot about it
[12:02] god is good to us glad to see everybody
[12:06] tonight as we started last week
[12:14] [Music]
[12:18] because I was turning it off we
[12:25] appreciate everybody tonight we thank

[12:57] [Music]
[13:02] Oh
[13:11] [Music]
[13:18] [Music]
[13:28] [Music]
[13:42] Oh
[13:43] [Music]
[14:00] [Music]
[14:10] [Music]
[14:20] I said
[14:30] [Music]
[14:39] Oh
[14:47] [Music]
[14:52] Oh
[15:04] Oh
[15:07] [Music]
[15:11] I shall I
[15:25] [Music]
[15:35] me
[15:37] [Music]
[15:47] [Music]
[16:04] even beyond
[16:06] [Music]
[16:24] hallelujah that tells the story God is
[16:29] good to us we stand we ask that you turn
[16:33] with us to the scripture we preached the
[16:45] other day on the message of freedom and
[16:51] I trust that you understand when we
[16:55] preach that everything we preach we
[16:59] preach grace now if you take it by way
[17:03] that is law you're getting the wrong
[17:07] impression
[17:10] if the Jews couldn't do the will of God
[17:13] by law surely we cannot but there is a
[17:19] law that God wants us to live by and
[17:21] that is the law of love which is Christ
[17:25] because he said if you love me you'll
[17:28] keep my Commandments I want to speak
[17:33] again kind of tying everything in with
[17:36] this freedom because I think sometimes
[17:39] we don't understand or it just doesn't
[17:41] strike us like it ought to that once
[17:45] you're set free you're free indeed the
[17:48] Bible said whom the Sun set free he is
[17:50] free indeed there is nothing restraints
[17:55] because if you realize the saving grace
[17:58] that God has given to you and and and
[18:01] and what it's entails maybe we can paint
[18:04] a picture tonight maybe we can do
[18:05] something that God will show us how much
[18:09] he really loved and cares for us
[18:12] so as we stand we're gonna ask that you
[18:15] turn with us to the scriptures Galatians
[18:21] we're gonna come there at the 6th
[18:23] chapter 15 verse don't forget to keep
[18:29] our brother rich in prayer and in
[18:32] Philippians 3 Galatians 6:15
[18:38] the Philippians 3 the more I see this
[18:41] message and more I get excited about it
[18:44] I feel like kicking my legs back and
[18:47] just resting because I realize a man
[18:51] that everything that is being done is
[18:54] being done by God you say oh I got faith
[19:00] but don't you understand that faith is a
[19:02] gift it is a gift from God you can fast
[19:06] 40 days if you want to and that's not
[19:08] gonna produce faith faith comes by
[19:11] hearing and hearing by the Word of God
[19:13] God gives you things yes education or
[19:18] nothing like that will give you faith
[19:22] galatians 6:15 for in Christ Jesus
[19:27] neither circumcision availeth anything
[19:31] nor uncircumcision but a new creature so
[19:42] what Paul was talking to the Jews
[19:44] because you remember they had the order
[19:47] of circumcision every male child was to
[19:52] be circumcised on the eighth day and not
[19:55] to be circumcised amen was a real crime
[19:59] and you know Paul says now that law is
[20:03] gone because the circumcision of the
[20:06] flesh was symbolic or symbolism of God
[20:11] circumcising the heart and that is to
[20:15] get rid of the Serpent's part because
[20:17] all of us got it we were born with it
[20:21] right the Serpent's part but God was to
[20:25] circumcise us our hearts to get rid of
[20:30] the Serpent's part right because he had
[20:33] a part in this creation this fallen
[20:35] creation Philippians 3:13 214th brethren
[20:43] I count not myself to have apprehended
[20:47] but this one thing I do
[20:51] forgetting those things which are behind
[20:53] and that's what's very difficult for a
[20:56] lot of us to do is to forget the things
[20:59] that are behind and reaching forth unto
[21:03] those things which are before that means
[21:07] there's something I had and God is
[21:10] saying okay forget all this don't even
[21:13] go back looking let's go forward I press
[21:18] toward the mark for the prize of the
[21:21] high calling of God in Christ Jesus now
[21:26] watch this the calling of God in Christ
[21:29] Jesus that's that's the key those key
[21:32] words the calling of God not about him
[21:36] not around him but in him Christ Jesus
[21:41] so what was the calling of God in Christ
[21:44] Jesus I'm about ready to shout let us
[21:49] pray father God we come before your Lord
[21:53] we thank you for your grace and your
[21:54] mercy we thank you for being so good to
[21:57] us Lord you have been better to us than
[21:59] we have been to ourselves and father we
[22:03] realize Lord Jesus this hot calling that
[22:06] you have in your son dear Jesus Christ
[22:09] you Paul says he pressed toward that he
[22:13] want to see that we want to be that we
[22:16] want to express that help us now give us
[22:21] grace to see with our hearts give us
[22:25] grace to understand by revelation the
[22:28] word that would be spoken this this
[22:30] evening we ask these things in Jesus
[22:32] Christ's name we pray amen you may be
[22:34] seated this is one of the things that
[22:38] makes us different than all of the
[22:41] organizations and denominations even
[22:45] those who call themselves
[22:47] nondenominational because the Bible
[22:50] tells us without a vision the people
[22:54] perish
[22:57] just giving you an example an artist
[23:01] cannot paint without a vision he has to
[23:07] have something to look at to focus on
[23:11] something whether be in front of him or
[23:15] in his mind or heart wherever it may be
[23:17] but he himself may be let's see it must
[23:20] be a revelation to him if nobody else
[23:22] can see it he must have something in
[23:26] order to place it on a canvas so you and
[23:29] I could see and you said well what do
[23:32] you mean brother books you see Jesus
[23:35] Christ was the art of God we didn't know
[23:40] what God looked like what he would act
[23:43] like what he would be like but the Bible
[23:47] says that Jesus Christ was a very
[23:49] expressed image of God so by watching
[23:54] Jesus Christ we can see what God the
[23:58] invisible was like that is why he said
[24:03] to Philip he's and Thomas when you see
[24:05] me you see the father I am the father
[24:09] wonder what was it it was it was
[24:11] something going on there that that the
[24:13] normal man couldn't see and i'ma tell
[24:15] you something christians christians most
[24:19] christians don't even know what a
[24:21] Christian is that's why I like that song
[24:25] it's dripping with blood this Holy Ghost
[24:30] gospel is dripping with blood in other
[24:34] words every seed must bring forth of his
[24:37] kind
[24:37] whatever the Christians were in the
[24:41] earlier day can never change their
[24:44] character they must women if they be
[24:48] Christians if they're born of the same
[24:51] seed or of the same Holy Ghost of the
[24:55] same word they must reflect the very
[25:00] character of the original Christians
[25:04] because Christianity is not a
[25:07] denomination is
[25:09] organization is not a club christianity
[25:14] is life it is the life of christ
[25:19] reflecting through believers they
[25:24] understand me this is what paul said i'm
[25:26] pressing toward that mark because you
[25:31] got to understand Jesus Christ is the
[25:34] mark and if you understand Jesus you
[25:38] realize that Jesus was not an ordinary
[25:41] man though he looked ordinary though he
[25:45] walked ordinary though he hung around
[25:47] ordinary people he was not ordinary he
[25:53] wasn't born ordinary matter of fact Amen
[25:57] he was born virgin born his body he
[26:01] meant was created by God is that right
[26:04] he was a very living sacrifice or the
[26:08] very reflection of the invisible God
[26:10] that's why he said when you see me you
[26:13] see my father he said I can't even do
[26:15] nothing except the father show me and
[26:20] people find it very difficult because
[26:23] they can't understand the oneness of God
[26:26] and let me say it like this
[26:27] if you don't understand the oneness of
[26:28] God you'll never understand your oneness
[26:30] I say that a lot because amen in the
[26:34] Saint John the seventeenth chapter Jesus
[26:36] Christ pray father I would that they be
[26:40] one even as we are one that right he
[26:45] even goes on to say God give them the
[26:47] glory that you gave me from the
[26:52] beginning give it to these people
[26:54] oh come on somebody there is how I want
[27:03] to say it I want to say like my son said
[27:05] it to me the other day and I thought God
[27:07] that's really deep because through him
[27:09] God spoke through him and he says daddy
[27:13] you're different
[27:14] he said I can see the difference in you
[27:17] and and just listening to you know
[27:20] basically what you said he said God is
[27:23] calling us to be higher beings I
[27:29] wouldn't know how many in the service
[27:31] the other day or the other services
[27:33] beforehand could see just that that the
[27:40] calling that God has for all of us
[27:43] is not just to be Christians so-called
[27:48] but we are born in a way that that's
[27:55] different we're born like God said to
[28:00] Mary this thing that's in you would be
[28:06] of the Holy Ghost
[28:07] cuz we're said being a virgin I've never
[28:11] known a man how could this thing be and
[28:15] the scripture said don't worry Mary Mary
[28:18] the Lord shall overshadow you you
[28:22] understand me
[28:23] and the Bible says that God / shouted
[28:26] Mary what the Holy Ghost shall
[28:29] overshadow you now if the Holy Ghost is
[28:33] the father of Jesus then the Holy Ghost
[28:36] and the father must be one person cuz
[28:39] you can't have two daddies so we see by
[28:44] God's grace that if we are to be this
[28:49] bride and I say that because I believe
[28:52] that the people even around this message
[28:55] have allowed themselves either men to be
[28:59] confused or they have allowed themselves
[29:01] to look back and stellar forward and
[29:05] when we turn to look back to see what
[29:09] brother Branham did and not what you're
[29:11] supposed to be doing you lose the very
[29:14] image is that right everybody did not
[29:19] leave John when John introduced Jesus
[29:24] hallelujah and as it was then so is it
[29:29] now somebody help me here and you must
[29:34] understand by God's grace
[29:36] you're not called to become ordinary
[29:39] you're the highest of God's order is
[29:45] that right even even even in science you
[29:48] know they they go science be dig and and
[29:52] they find you know that you know in
[29:54] their own thoughts that man man evolved
[29:58] from a Polliwog then into a frog and all
[30:01] of that but but when it comes to
[30:03] evidence the highest of order he can
[30:07] only find a man he comes along and he
[30:12] finds what he called me on and at all
[30:14] and he filled that Neanderthal is a
[30:17] mixture of the monkey in man whatever
[30:21] but the highest of all orders he knows
[30:26] mankind knows the highest of the order
[30:29] of God's creation is man
[30:32] nothing supersedes his intelligence not
[30:38] in this world but you see there's
[30:41] something greater than this order
[30:45] because this order amen was a natural
[30:49] order to bring it back to where we
[30:52] should be understand that the first Adam
[30:54] amen was for spiritual man before he
[30:57] became natural man and you and I must
[31:00] understand at this creation God is
[31:04] bringing us back but in a higher order
[31:09] than it was then because we had to come
[31:15] to know good and evil in order to be
[31:19] like God somebody we had to be able like
[31:25] I said the other night God is looking
[31:27] for this generation this age to subdue
[31:33] the devil or the serpent come up Adam
[31:38] didn't do it he failed the second Adam
[31:41] did it the Bible said he'd not only
[31:44] defeated death hell and the grave but he
[31:46] led captivity captive and gave gifts on
[31:50] man hallelujah but is that we have a
[31:57] duty and as long as the devil can get us
[32:02] looking back fussing with each other
[32:05] striving with each other will we will
[32:08] fail God's intent for us for an example
[32:15] when Peter said Lord if that be you bid
[32:18] me come God said come as long as Peter
[32:22] kept his eyes on Jesus he stood when he
[32:27] started looking at all of the winds and
[32:28] the doctors that were around him he
[32:31] began to sink don't look at all of those
[32:35] things that coming know who you watching
[32:39] keep your eyes on Jesus Christ he's the
[32:43] only one that can lift you up out of the
[32:46] troubles so superior race is what I'm
[32:53] coming to do because everybody wants to
[32:57] be superior the Egyptians thought they
[33:01] were superior BHEL thought he was
[33:05] superior the Greeks thought they were
[33:08] superior Rome thought they were superior
[33:11] Hitler thought he was superior and I'm
[33:14] sure there's a lot more I can't remember
[33:19] some of that the Koreans in the end in
[33:23] the Chinese and the Africans I don't
[33:25] remember their names
[33:28] but everywhere you go you find somebody
[33:32] who think they are superior because you
[33:36] know what there exists a superior people
[33:42] [Music]
[33:44] hallelujah say break it down brother
[33:47] Brooks well the Bible said let this mind
[33:51] be in you that was also in Christ Jesus
[33:56] hallelujah who thought it not robbery to
[34:00] be equal with God come on
[34:04] you can't if you're gonna be equal with
[34:05] God that means your superior but he
[34:08] humbled himself come on somebody see if
[34:13] the man puffs up like this it shows that
[34:15] he's it is not of God because the
[34:18] greater the man become the more humble
[34:21] he becomes that's how God is who was
[34:25] more superior than Jesus Christ but he
[34:27] came in so humble the Bible labored him
[34:30] as the Lamb of God it ain't no big eyes
[34:34] and little use there's only one big eye
[34:37] and that's the all-seeing eye
[34:40] who is God himself
[34:43] listen so when you we talk about a
[34:47] superior race we talk about people who
[34:49] are washed in the blood of the Lamb you
[34:53] know why I'm saying these things because
[34:55] I want you to understand that you and I
[34:58] don't have to believe in our hearts that
[35:00] because we're Christians we should allow
[35:02] people to dog us around show me in the
[35:07] scripture where Jesus Christ ever
[35:09] allowed anybody to dog him around you
[35:14] know what he was you know why because he
[35:16] knew who he was he wasn't afraid of the
[35:20] revelation that was in him he wasn't
[35:23] afraid to express the revelation of what
[35:25] was in here is that right oh it's the
[35:29] truth he knew who he was and when this
[35:33] true revelation comes into you that
[35:36] don't mean you mean arrogant or whatever
[35:38] but it's like when they tried to trap
[35:41] Jesus and they said Jesus let me ask you
[35:47] know who what authority you have we can
[35:50] see you didn't graduate from Harvard or
[35:52] Yale or any of these great seminaries
[35:55] who gave you your authority huh Jesus oh
[36:03] no no no he said let me ask you a
[36:07] question and if you answer my question
[36:10] I'll answer yours John the Baptist was
[36:15] he was a man or was he of God
[36:18] hallelujah and they got in a little air
[36:22] communica huddle this is not if we say
[36:25] Amen he came from John then he gonna ask
[36:28] us why didn't we believe he said but if
[36:31] I admit if we said it meant he didn't
[36:33] come from God the people don't stone us
[36:36] because they know John the Baptist was
[36:39] of God so right they went out they came
[36:41] back and said Lord Jesus you know we
[36:45] cannot tell well I love this and jesus
[36:48] said well says you can't tell me I can't
[36:51] tell you he punched him hallelujah
[36:57] shut him up hey man see that's what I
[37:00] love about God he said don't think about
[37:01] what you go saying just wait and I give
[37:05] you the words to say hallelujah see you
[37:09] and I must understand that this Holy
[37:12] Ghost is God that we serve supposed to
[37:14] be so real to you that you can talk to
[37:16] him and he can talk to you he is off the
[37:20] book he's off the pages he's supposed to
[37:23] be in you you're not like everybody else
[37:27] and when I say that if you truly got the
[37:30] Holy Ghost and you've been washed in the
[37:32] blood of the Lamb he meant God is
[37:34] changing you from glory to glory to
[37:36] glory to glory hallelujah if you abide
[37:40] in my word my word abiding you he said
[37:43] you could ask what you will and it shall
[37:45] be given unto you is that right see
[37:49] faith create it we was made for that
[37:52] purpose then through that fall listen
[37:55] when he says why we are taken away from
[37:57] that and then in Redemption we was to be
[38:01] brought back to it again and the only
[38:03] thing that in hinders the human race
[38:06] today
[38:07] from being superior and controlling like
[38:10] they did in the beginning is because the
[38:12] power line of the outlet of God made in
[38:16] the human being has been clogged up you
[38:22] understand me
[38:23] that means it's there but you got to
[38:26] unclog it that means the same Authority
[38:31] and power that Jesus Christ had it's in
[38:35] their right oh come on somebody see what
[38:41] can God not do is there anything too
[38:44] hard for God but until we come to
[38:49] recognize the word is for you see the
[38:51] word is not for us just to listen to
[38:53] memorize it is an instruction book it is
[39:00] a book that's supposed to reflect to us
[39:02] show us by revelation what the character
[39:05] of God is like what he loves and what he
[39:08] doesn't love is that right David said in
[39:12] in the scriptures I hate everything that
[39:14] God hates that's what he said
[39:18] I'm just paraphrasing it but understand
[39:22] this everybody can't hear this nothing
[39:25] brother brings you off your rocker
[39:27] a Christian is just a a weak individual
[39:31] you know he ain't got nothing else to do
[39:34] so he choose to be a Christian nonsense
[39:38] a Christian the Bible said is the salt
[39:42] of the earth in other words without us
[39:45] the world wouldn't even be preserved
[39:48] because we are here we still have this
[39:51] world moving hallelujah that's what the
[39:56] Bible said you get rid of the Christians
[39:58] the world ain't worth nothing but to be
[40:00] tried and upon destruction hello is that
[40:06] right
[40:06] once noir got into the OP him and his
[40:10] family what God did destroyed it hey
[40:14] what's Lord and his family got out of
[40:17] the city what God did he started there
[40:21] was nothing worth saving hey that sounds
[40:26] funny but it's true now we're back in
[40:29] the same condition but where is the
[40:33] little amateur gods where is the Messiah
[40:38] where are those who are now expressing
[40:42] the reason that they very are unseen God
[40:45] in their lives there must be somewhere
[40:52] you see because everybody won't be able
[40:57] to see it you know let me put it this
[41:02] way you and I must come to recognize
[41:07] that the word speaks of us and
[41:11] understand the word that it's been
[41:13] spoken prepared you for this hour
[41:17] you didn't come unprepared God prepared
[41:21] you prepare to you before you knew you
[41:23] was being prepared first of all he gave
[41:27] you a seed gene he gave you something
[41:31] that will cause you to recognize your
[41:34] day and his message ain't nothing you
[41:38] did he did it and you and I must
[41:42] understand that he prepared it what do
[41:45] you brothers let me say it like this
[41:47] when Isaiah when he spoke a virgin shall
[41:50] conceive I think was eight hundred years
[41:52] later and don't you know that when
[41:57] Isaiah spoke that he had nothing else to
[41:59] say how many see anything could have
[42:03] been there what did you say how was that
[42:07] going to be done it wasn't his business
[42:09] and nobody else's business
[42:12] it's our ludicrous but he never
[42:18] questioned it
[42:19] he knew that inspiration was of God and
[42:24] no doubt the people when they first
[42:26] heard it thought oh my god this is
[42:28] wonderful and all those look virgins
[42:30] they men thought they would be the one
[42:32] eight hundred years later see if God
[42:35] speaks it it cannot come back boy it
[42:39] doesn't matter how long it takes it has
[42:42] to come to pass hallelujah
[42:46] like you know for example we know that
[42:49] California is gonna fall
[42:52] been a long time coming it doesn't
[42:55] matter how long it takes it's going to
[42:59] happen even scientist says it's going to
[43:02] happen and if you living while it
[43:04] happened when it happens you're in
[43:06] trouble because I believe by God's grace
[43:11] that that's during the time of the
[43:14] rapture hallelujah the property God ties
[43:20] that into the rapture and the sixth seal
[43:22] of early it is now let me move on
[43:25] because I'm talking about something that
[43:29] you and I must understand you did not
[43:32] elect yourself you did not choose
[43:36] yourself like Mary didn't but you know
[43:40] when Isaiah said that a virgin shall
[43:42] conceive God knew her name was going to
[43:44] be married you say all praise God I just
[43:50] so happened to come no you didn't
[43:52] everything has been ordained of God and
[43:56] every seat is gonna bring forth of his
[43:58] kind
[43:59] why this message seemed to interest you
[44:01] you don't even know why but it's because
[44:05] of the God that he placed in you yes or
[44:07] what do you mean brothers remember even
[44:10] before you even thought about coming
[44:11] becoming a Christian there was always
[44:13] something in you that would turn on
[44:15] every time you did wrong you always felt
[44:19] bad about it you always wanted to feel
[44:22] better it's the truth
[44:24] even when you as a sinner maybe some of
[44:27] your friends could do things you
[44:28] couldn't even do but the opportunity was
[44:31] there why didn't you do it for something
[44:35] in here registering wrong it's wrong
[44:40] what was that that a little peace of God
[44:43] I say that little piece of a seed that
[44:46] little see God put in you thank God for
[44:49] God hallelujah so what are you saying
[44:52] brother Brooks I'm trying to comfort you
[44:54] tonight we got to stop this fighting and
[44:57] when I say that fighting with ourselves
[45:00] you can't change a lecture
[45:06] you can't change it it's saddled it's
[45:08] fixed and if you're gonna do anything
[45:11] you must believe that you are because if
[45:14] you can believe that you are elected to
[45:16] be bribed you began to act like it
[45:19] every word you hear in this Bible we
[45:22] began to make you mature and grow it's
[45:25] only when you doubt because faith comes
[45:27] by hearing hearing by the Word of God
[45:30] right but God is only pleased by faith
[45:34] and understand God is giving you the
[45:38] faith to believe this
[45:39] you couldn't just believe this on your
[45:41] own is that right
[45:44] it's the truth faith it has to be there
[45:47] remember in the property God says I
[45:50] don't have basically need faith because
[45:51] once God showed me a vision I know it's
[45:54] gonna come to pass but God had to try my
[45:57] faith he had to give me faith to have
[46:00] faith right God has to give you faith
[46:04] why do you think some can believe in
[46:06] some can't because God gives Psalm and
[46:09] God don't give others other that's my
[46:13] gifts are there so we can work together
[46:15] in love somebody help me she all cannot
[46:21] see except my father draws him first and
[46:26] all that the father has given me will
[46:28] come to me
[46:29] no man can understand who he is or how
[46:33] it is except it be revealed to you by
[46:37] the revelation of God is that right oh
[46:40] come on it's the truth Peter who you say
[46:46] I am
[46:48] he said all some say the dark you John
[46:51] the Baptist he John about the Jeremiah
[46:54] one of the prophets you know but she
[46:56] said who do you say I the Son of Man I
[46:59] love that I love that that scene right
[47:01] now because Peter said thou art the
[47:04] Christ the Son of the Living God what
[47:07] was he saying you are God in flesh
[47:10] according to the Jew a son of God is God
[47:16] and so he was saying he said Oh
[47:19] flesh and blood did not reveal this to
[47:21] you and he's saying his flesh his blood
[47:25] didn't reveal no other man's flesh and
[47:27] blood review this but my father who is
[47:30] the Holy Ghost who is the Holy Spirit
[47:32] he's quickened this to you he revealed
[47:35] it to you and upon this rock I'll build
[47:39] my church see because once God reveals
[47:43] the world to you nobody can take it
[47:46] hallelujah nobody can snatch it nobody
[47:50] can steal it it becomes so personal it
[47:53] becomes a part of you right because even
[47:56] when Mary says all Lord I mean to that
[47:59] angel how can this thing be knowing that
[48:00] I'm not seeing a man the Holy Ghost will
[48:03] overshadow you then she said be it unto
[48:04] me according to that word then she
[48:07] didn't go to it Elizabeth says you know
[48:08] I think I'm pregnant no there was no
[48:11] signs but she ran to Elizabeth said
[48:14] Elizabeth I want you to know I've had an
[48:16] experience with God and the angel king
[48:19] and he told me I had I'm bearing the
[48:22] Messiah and he and this was a tall she
[48:27] was happy I'm bearing Messiah and his
[48:32] name shall be Jesus that baby who've
[48:37] been dead and Elizabeth womb for six
[48:39] months began to leave for Josh
[48:42] hallelujah and if the name of Jesus can
[48:45] wait to dad baby what about us huh and
[48:53] you know what when Mary received that
[48:57] revelation she was willing to die for
[49:01] her revelation now because Joseph surely
[49:04] was going to stone and no matter what
[49:07] she said Joseph wasn't believing her
[49:09] hallelujah it took God to step in how
[49:14] would you have been if your wife is
[49:18] telling you she's pregnant not with a
[49:21] man but God gave her the baby hallelujah
[49:26] can young it wasn't a tough decision for
[49:31] Jonah it was difficult
[49:33] I knew is difficult to the Bob said
[49:35] George was gonna take her privately and
[49:37] he was go stone her you ain't shaming me
[49:40] with that report who gonna believe that
[49:44] nobody's gonna believe that all right it
[49:47] took God to intervene but from that
[49:50] point on Mary knew who she was
[49:54] that's why it was such a critical thing
[49:56] when when Jesus got lost and she began
[49:59] to testify among the Pharisees and the
[50:02] Sadducees your father and I she she
[50:05] literally cut her testimony to a zero
[50:09] but Jesus Christ being the word saying
[50:13] no no no no no woman I'd be about my
[50:17] father's business never call her mother
[50:21] because she's never was how can she be
[50:23] the mother of God come on she had
[50:27] nothing to do with it God created the
[50:31] blood and the body that Scripture she
[50:34] was an incubator she was a surrogate
[50:36] mother find me anywhere in the scripture
[50:40] he ever called her mother hmm I don't
[50:45] mean to mess up your Christmas but
[50:46] that's the truth faith is a revelation
[50:52] as I said it is a gift from God by what
[50:58] his grace
[50:59] you can't merit it you can't earn it you
[51:03] can't work it is God giving it to you
[51:09] you see if Mary had had anything blood
[51:14] wise to deal to do with Jesus Jesus body
[51:17] would have been in just as sinful as
[51:19] everybody else's because these bodies
[51:22] are contaminated hallelujah and these
[51:26] bodies are meant to die y'all hear what
[51:31] I'm saying
[51:31] he could not and if he had been part of
[51:34] that his blood was to being so
[51:36] contaminated he would not have been able
[51:38] to redeem us God needed a pure blood
[51:42] hallelujah he needed a pure blood you
[51:47] to the anointing of the hour this is
[51:49] what we must understand we must
[51:51] understand there is an anointing that
[51:53] comes with this message it ain't just a
[51:57] Pentecostal jumping shouting speaking in
[51:59] tongues running up and down the aisle
[52:01] all of that is good when it's God but
[52:05] everything that dude you know ain't
[52:07] always God but the thing that God has
[52:10] come to do is to bring a new creation
[52:13] somebody help me here is that right the
[52:16] Bible and I'm gonna get I'm gonna move
[52:17] on now the Bible said that Jesus Christ
[52:19] according to revelation third chapter is
[52:21] the beginning of the creation of God
[52:23] well then how can God be created he's
[52:26] not talking about the spirit he's
[52:28] talking about the flesh body the
[52:30] creation of God that's right the first
[52:33] ball and meeting impairs the firstborn
[52:35] there must be second third and fourth
[52:39] hallelujah yes sir and you and I must
[52:42] understand that when we received the
[52:44] Holy Ghost the real Holy Ghost we are
[52:47] born of God we now been created in His
[52:51] image is that right and God is reflected
[52:54] expecting us to reflect his character in
[52:58] this world that's why I said ye are the
[53:01] light of the world see this is what gets
[53:05] me there's so many people think you know
[53:08] we're just gonna make this a religion
[53:10] we're just gonna settle down and we
[53:11] ought to call ourselves you know that's
[53:15] foolishness because by doing that you
[53:20] become starchy you become cold you
[53:24] become formal and the very image that
[53:26] you are supposed to be reflecting is
[53:28] actually lost it's the truth listen it's
[53:35] the truth look at the Pharisees and the
[53:39] Sadducees when Jesus came on the scene
[53:41] they were so off the word they did not
[53:45] even recognize the God they worshiped
[53:50] here it comes in refresh reflecting it
[53:53] wasn't bad it was bad bad bad huh here
[53:58] it is because Israel always believed
[54:00] in the supernatural Moses Joshua they
[54:05] knew the supernatural was real but here
[54:10] was a man born blind thirty years and he
[54:15] receives his sight by the touch of the
[54:20] master's hand Jesus himself and we
[54:24] remember if you know the scripture they
[54:26] said they had a order that if anybody
[54:30] believe in this Jesus Christ we're gonna
[54:32] kick them out to church read your Bible
[54:36] is it there and this man who was born
[54:39] blind mom and daddy was afraid to
[54:43] testify by their son because they was
[54:46] afraid that they will be kicked out of
[54:48] their church in that the truth isn't
[54:50] that real how people even to this day it
[54:53] meant claimed to be leave this message
[54:55] but they are afraid to testify of it
[54:58] because they might lose friends or may
[55:00] be kicked out of their church no that's
[55:03] insanity nobody don't care and the thing
[55:11] about it is when you leave what you know
[55:14] is truth they laugh you and mock you as
[55:16] a hypocrite it's the truth and Jesus
[55:24] amen amen and here's the man says wait a
[55:26] minute I've never gone to theological
[55:28] seminary I don't know nothing about this
[55:30] thing
[55:31] he's about I tell you what I do know is
[55:33] it true that even in your law we know
[55:36] that the devil can hear you yet you
[55:40] called Jesus a devil and you said we
[55:42] know that the devil came here right he
[55:46] said I'll tell you what that's settled
[55:48] the whole thing let me tell you the way
[55:50] it is I was was blind but now I see you
[55:55] know what they did they got mad with the
[55:57] man what you trying to do convert us
[56:00] they keep them out of church but when
[56:03] they kick them out of touch then Jesus
[56:06] came hallelujah every time you get in
[56:09] trouble every because you stand on the
[56:11] Word of God gee
[56:13] Christ Himself will personally come by
[56:16] to encourage you hmm what we're dealing
[56:22] with now in this agent this is important
[56:25] this is important because it's not
[56:27] enough to know the message you see what
[56:29] I'm saying when I say this I mean
[56:32] intellectually don't you know you can
[56:35] get pregnant intellectually huh when I
[56:40] was in the Apostolic Church years ago
[56:42] this is the one of the babies so bad and
[56:45] she believes she had one and she ate
[56:48] like it and she grew like it but every
[56:51] time she went to the doctor they say
[56:53] ain't nothing day in her mind she was
[56:57] thinking she was pregnant oh people I
[57:02] think that's what we're dealing with now
[57:05] it's in the people's mind that they have
[57:08] been impregnated ain't got nothing in
[57:11] there you don't want to show up at the
[57:13] end of the day with nothing there it
[57:17] cannot be a mind game it must be a
[57:20] transformation it must be something that
[57:23] can be visible and not only visible you
[57:26] need to feel some kicks and things every
[57:28] now and again and any woman that refuses
[57:39] a man his child has no right to be a
[57:41] wife to him even you remember in the
[57:45] Bible when the Kings married Esther
[57:47] because of Queen refused he just got him
[57:51] another one what happened when he
[57:53] refuses to come out with the King and
[57:55] obey him the same thing it is with the
[57:58] woman that refuses to be the wife of her
[58:01] husband so what do you saying I'm
[58:03] getting ready to move on with that cuz I
[58:05] look and I see around this I don't use
[58:09] the term but the churches that we
[58:11] fellowship with we fellowship with
[58:13] whoever world ever would allow us to but
[58:15] my point is I see like a vasti gathering
[58:20] together they're having a great revival
[58:24] among themselves intellectually
[58:26] but refusing the king hmm are they
[58:33] refusing again you stop preaching about
[58:35] Jesus a coming to Jesus and giving your
[58:38] heart to Jesus and and and and dying and
[58:40] rioting to Jesus see you got to come to
[58:45] Jesus the king is calling oh come on
[58:50] it's happening whether you want to agree
[58:52] with this and not this came from God and
[58:53] I'm gonna tell you something is
[58:55] happening Oh where's the birth where's
[59:03] the fire hallelujah and if you have
[59:10] failed to become impregnated with this
[59:13] word God will put you away also deals
[59:18] with the church that refuses to become
[59:20] pregnant in the age that we now live in
[59:24] to bring forth children of this age we
[59:28] are not Lutheran's
[59:29] we're not Wesleyan neither are we
[59:31] Pentecostals we've got to be the
[59:34] children of this age through the
[59:36] pregnancy of the Word of God to bring
[59:39] forth a child of this age the seed child
[59:42] a man I hope you understand couldn't be
[59:44] praying couldn't be pregnant No
[59:47] so what did he do put her away in
[59:49] divorcement that's right she but she
[59:52] dares put him away he put her away he
[59:56] went right in revealing his word to the
[1:00:00] body and vindicating him shame by
[1:00:03] himself by what his children were you
[1:00:06] saying
[1:00:08] Lutheran's used to be real Lutheran's
[1:00:11] they were impregnated by that revelation
[1:00:14] to just shall live by faith but they
[1:00:16] organized and they died put away wesley
[1:00:23] ins get the same pentecost has done the
[1:00:25] same and i fear that a lot of people
[1:00:28] around this so-called message amen is
[1:00:30] doing the same thing
[1:00:32] Christ must be seen he must be seen
[1:00:38] it ain't about all of
[1:00:40] is that the truth we have typed out the
[1:00:43] prophet of God for years what he did
[1:00:46] what God has done in the devil I guess
[1:00:50] why cuz he knows you don't see the
[1:00:53] vision of who you are you see him but
[1:00:57] you can't see yourself you don't see
[1:00:59] where you are positionally placed
[1:01:01] hallelujah and you must understand and
[1:01:04] then when when we're not ah ah did we
[1:01:08] see Rebecca ELISA
[1:01:14] moved off the scene hallelujah and what
[1:01:19] happened Isaac and Rebecca with we're in
[1:01:23] Sarah's tent the old-fashioned way and
[1:01:28] the old-fashioned way is what Malachi
[1:01:31] for came to turn us back to and that is
[1:01:34] the real genuine Pentecostal experience
[1:01:39] it must be that is the old-time way
[1:01:48] hallelujah I hope you understand
[1:01:53] revealing his word to the body and
[1:01:55] vindicating him the same by himself his
[1:01:57] children began to to kind of look more
[1:02:00] like him because it's fully maturing or
[1:02:03] they become children of the word not
[1:02:05] children of the church children of the
[1:02:07] word and the bride will be a lovely
[1:02:10] little lady of the word unadulterated
[1:02:14] not touched by any man's organization
[1:02:16] any man-made theory
[1:02:18] she'll be purely unadulterated pride of
[1:02:21] the word a man and I hope you get that
[1:02:24] see that's what's getting me because I
[1:02:27] told the Lord that says God and I told
[1:02:31] my son I said I can't help it I'm
[1:02:32] different I can't help it I made this
[1:02:34] way I'm just made this way I can't help
[1:02:40] it I want God real you know I'm not
[1:02:46] about popularity why am I here I had a
[1:02:49] far bigger church than this I don't care
[1:02:51] about that could have been
[1:02:53] famous yeah had opportunities to be in
[1:02:57] Hollywood I didn't want that I'm
[1:03:01] different and I've known that from a
[1:03:03] child I'm different there's something I
[1:03:06] don't care about my fault
[1:03:07] because God didn't look about my fault
[1:03:10] hallelujah God ain't looking at my
[1:03:12] steering ways that's what grace has done
[1:03:14] for me
[1:03:15] that's what grace has done for you God
[1:03:18] is looking at the Commission that he's
[1:03:20] given you and you and I I have one
[1:03:23] desire it see the manifestations of the
[1:03:26] sons of God in my day the very thing
[1:03:30] that the whole creation is groaning for
[1:03:32] I've got to see it I've got to be a part
[1:03:35] of it because I know I am there's no way
[1:03:38] to explain it when the revelation drops
[1:03:41] in your heart it just drops in your
[1:03:42] heart you become a fool for Christ I
[1:03:51] told my friend I told whoever I was
[1:03:55] talking to I said listen I said I don't
[1:03:57] run around I'm faithful by God's grace I
[1:04:04] don't look for all this great money
[1:04:08] hello let me say it like this yes God
[1:04:12] has delivered me from a lot of things
[1:04:14] that's what makes me know he's real hmm
[1:04:20] sanctification has been a process for me
[1:04:22] just like it is for everybody else
[1:04:26] hallelujah joy doesn't matter when it
[1:04:29] comes to us who and what he said what
[1:04:32] what do you mean brother Brooks I don't
[1:04:33] know a man yet who's been born of a
[1:04:36] woman or a woman who's not born as a
[1:04:39] sinner sinner right faulty but guess
[1:04:43] what
[1:04:44] this old man must die and rock in order
[1:04:47] for Jesus Christ to live in you right oh
[1:04:51] it's the truth you got to come into
[1:04:55] faith into Christ but faith is not just
[1:04:59] a thing the Bible said in the beginning
[1:05:01] was the word the Word was with God and
[1:05:03] the Word was God by this word all things
[1:05:06] were created
[1:05:07] by him so it's a person hallelujah
[1:05:13] she and the Bible tells us and listen I
[1:05:16] love this amen
[1:05:18] I love this first Corinthians 15 for
[1:05:22] 4549 just to back up what I'm trying to
[1:05:24] say and it is so written the first man
[1:05:27] Adam was made a living soul the last man
[1:05:30] Adam was made a quickening spirit I'll
[1:05:33] be in that was not first which is
[1:05:36] spiritual but that which is natural and
[1:05:39] afterward that which is spiritual in
[1:05:41] other words Jesus came after Adam the
[1:05:46] spiritual man came after the Adam the
[1:05:48] natural man right the first man is of
[1:05:51] the earth earthly the second man is the
[1:05:55] lord from heaven so one man this man
[1:06:00] came from the earth but that it was made
[1:06:03] that's been born again it came from the
[1:06:07] lord of heaven that's where we come from
[1:06:10] that's why we're so different we can't
[1:06:13] help it hallelujah as is the earthly
[1:06:18] such are they also that are earthly and
[1:06:21] as is the heavenly such are they also
[1:06:24] that are heavenly that's why the world
[1:06:29] can't comprehend you darkness cannot
[1:06:32] comprehend light and light can't
[1:06:35] comprehend darkness right call me you
[1:06:39] say how can they do that you can't in
[1:06:41] Kenny you can't answer me but people do
[1:06:43] think that you can't even comprehend why
[1:06:45] they would do it then they looked at you
[1:06:48] said oh what's wrong with y'all y'all
[1:06:49] don't know how to have fun and they
[1:06:51] don't understand how fun comes from God
[1:07:00] you know I hate people who you know I'm
[1:07:02] so bored
[1:07:03] I do not let that spirit I don't know it
[1:07:06] me how can I be bored and sitting in
[1:07:09] heavenly places
[1:07:11] if you bored that means you ain't in the
[1:07:14] right place y'all better hear what I'm
[1:07:17] saying it's the truth you said what do
[1:07:20] you mean let me
[1:07:21] saying like this when you were born and
[1:07:23] out we were born we were born into this
[1:07:25] third dimension third right this is the
[1:07:29] natural man three three one two three
[1:07:31] right but when we were born of God we
[1:07:36] change dimensions from the third to the
[1:07:41] sixth dimension come on somebody and the
[1:07:45] Bible says we are supposed to live like
[1:07:48] we are in the sixth I mentioned not the
[1:07:50] tire because our influence now it's
[1:07:55] coming from that dimension is that right
[1:07:59] brother Balaam said it he said as you
[1:08:01] are whatever is influenced you now it is
[1:08:04] what you are what whatever right if
[1:08:06] you've been being influenced from down
[1:08:08] there you acting like they do right and
[1:08:12] if you be influenced from heaven you
[1:08:14] acting like they do is that right holy
[1:08:20] holy holy said the law your life must
[1:08:23] speak that that's why the high priest
[1:08:26] when he had those pump granted those
[1:08:27] bells on him when he walked holy holy
[1:08:30] holy is the Lord that's how he went and
[1:08:34] the footstep of a righteous man are
[1:08:36] ordered by the Lord see this is another
[1:08:39] creation God has created something new
[1:08:42] on you he's not patching you up huh

[1:09:53] head and God is here cuz the man does

[1:10:00] get a man's ear swinging he'd up and

[1:10:05] Jesus picked up the ears slapped it back
[1:10:07] on there you know I don't even
[1:10:09] understand what I meant then become and
[1:10:11] convert it right then hallelujah he says

[1:11:24] also bear the image of the heavenly what
[1:11:28] was there having the image Jesus Christ
[1:11:30] and how did we see that after his
[1:11:33] resurrection he had his glorified body
[1:11:36] hallelujah they were there in the upper

[1:11:59] the Wizards where they get it all from
[1:12:01] Holly yeah is that right
[1:12:03] oh people don't want to believe in the
[1:12:04] Bible but why do they believe in good
[1:12:06] and evil how do we know good and evil
[1:12:10] except we understand it by the Bible huh
[1:12:13] is that the truth but every Hollywood
[1:12:15] movie is gonna be good and evil true you
[1:12:22] know if there's no good and evil
[1:12:23] just throw it all away and let a man do
[1:12:26] what he wants to do you can't labor him
[1:12:28] good not even coz there ain't nothing in
[1:12:29] law there's no law to govern him but the
[1:12:32] pipe see how conscious even tells us
[1:12:35] that this Bible is right whoo I'm
[1:12:40] feeling good tonight I don't know what
[1:12:42] y'all feeling is good I feel like flying
[1:12:44] away because I realize I don't have to
[1:12:50] worry anymore don't you understand if
[1:12:53] you are selected and elected by God
[1:12:55] don't God doing it it's his work he is
[1:12:59] the workmanship he is the Potter and
[1:13:02] we're the claim he Moses he shapes us
[1:13:05] but he needs for you to believe that the
[1:13:08] work that he starts in you he's faithful
[1:13:10] to complete it that's what he wants from
[1:13:13] you don't worry about how long it takes
[1:13:16] when God gets ready to finish his finish
[1:13:19] you said what do you mean brother God
[1:13:22] said let there be light and history
[1:13:24] doesn't even tell you how long it took
[1:13:26] for that light to be manifested it may
[1:13:30] have taken 800 years of law but we can
[1:13:33] see it came is that right look how God
[1:13:37] shed a virgin shall conceive it took 800
[1:13:40] years longer than America existed but it
[1:13:44] came it came and we look at it like oh
[1:13:50] it's just but we don't understand how
[1:13:55] long it took for it to come and look
[1:13:58] what all went on in between that
[1:14:00] I'm in this time look at the book of
[1:14:02] Genesis when God prophesied in the 3rd
[1:14:05] chapter that Jesus would come huh
[1:14:09] how many thousands of years it took for
[1:14:13] Jesus to come but he was there all the
[1:14:18] time
[1:14:19] hallelujah is that our high it's the
[1:14:21] truth mechanic is that right
[1:14:25] Abraham met because of it after the
[1:14:27] battle you understand me there was a
[1:14:31] shadow in the type of us meeting the
[1:14:33] Lord Jesus Christ after the battle when
[1:14:36] it's all over hallelujah
[1:14:39] yes we'll have communion with him oh yes
[1:14:43] it's a real thing a man just like the
[1:14:47] world don't even know about the flying
[1:14:48] saucers Oh UFOs yes their unidentified
[1:14:52] objects to you hallelujah
[1:14:55] but we know who they are we know what
[1:14:57] they are they are investigating angels
[1:15:01] that's why they can move from one
[1:15:03] dimension to another and they think they
[1:15:05] just running no no no they changing them
[1:15:07] they hope they move boom they're gone
[1:15:09] not even a sonic boom what are they
[1:15:14] looking at they're looking at the world
[1:15:16] they're judging the world they looking
[1:15:19] at the world writing everything down and
[1:15:21] they saying Lord it's time hmm oh it's
[1:15:29] true you know God is what God is
[1:15:31] everywhere God is but by omniscience God
[1:15:35] is a man in the form and image of a man
[1:15:39] before he was a man he with your spirit
[1:15:42] but when Jesus raised from the dead he
[1:15:46] gave him all power and all authority in
[1:15:50] heaven and in earth but because he knows
[1:16:01] all things he can be everywhere in that
[1:16:04] sense is that Alright
[1:16:09] Lord have you seen what's going on down
[1:16:12] there
[1:16:13] all his angels are telling him man yeah
[1:16:17] I've been looking but have you seen Lord
[1:16:19] you know these three Hebrew boys they've
[1:16:21] been praying and you know they haven't
[1:16:24] even got an answer from you don't worry
[1:16:25] I got it all under control
[1:16:29] see some battles that we go through God
[1:16:32] has chosen to get in there with you for
[1:16:34] himself hallelujah sometime you let
[1:16:38] ministering spirits work it but there
[1:16:41] are times God come himself
[1:16:43] especially when the battle is rough like
[1:16:48] I told the Lord you know I I don't want
[1:16:50] to go to heaven you know you know you
[1:16:52] know everything all smooth ain't no
[1:16:54] scars no where yeah what battle you've
[1:16:57] been in and you ain't got not even a
[1:16:59] scratch you don't sound like you was
[1:17:01] AWOL hiding somewhere if you gonna be in
[1:17:05] a battle you need some scars
[1:17:11] I had a friend I'll tell you what who it
[1:17:15] was a you know brother Craig ball he was
[1:17:17] a professional pretty much almost a
[1:17:18] professional boxing everything he said
[1:17:20] boy when they got a black guy he they
[1:17:22] wore that black guy like a trophy they
[1:17:26] wanted people to see they win a fight
[1:17:28] yeah I know what I'm saying it's the
[1:17:30] truth now that's man who won hmm it's
[1:17:42] something about that it is something
[1:17:45] about that a little you love the Lord
[1:17:47] for who is in the image of the invisible
[1:17:50] God the firstborn of every creature who
[1:17:54] is he talking about Jesus Christ for by
[1:17:57] him we're all things created that are in
[1:17:59] heaven that are in earth visible
[1:18:01] invisible whether they be Thrones or
[1:18:04] dominions or principalities of power all
[1:18:06] things were created by him and this is
[1:18:09] what a partner like for him that means
[1:18:13] you too
[1:18:14] God knew you was coming here before you
[1:18:17] came he already prepared it for you
[1:18:21] y'all know it is the truth I desired I
[1:18:24] wanted to be an artist so bad
[1:18:26] I like art I love stuff like that you
[1:18:29] know me and I tried and I tried and then
[1:18:35] when I got to sculpturing I was finished
[1:18:39] I had to you know we had to do something
[1:18:44] like you know the head of a man oh my
[1:18:46] goodness you were not even wanted to see
[1:18:47] that here it didn't even look as well as
[1:18:51] the Neanderthal you know me
[1:18:53] it was bad that's when I gave it up but
[1:18:57] you see why because it wasn't my gift
[1:19:00] right but I came out singing right I
[1:19:06] didn't even know I could sing and you
[1:19:08] know when I started taking notice to my
[1:19:10] voice when my brother who always liked
[1:19:12] to beat up on me told me I could sing so
[1:19:17] I knew it must be true cuz he ain't
[1:19:20] gonna tell me nothin nice so I started
[1:19:25] paying attention and it got to the place
[1:19:26] where he started wrecking me recommended
[1:19:29] me to audition for these certain singing
[1:19:31] functions and stuff so and I say that
[1:19:35] only now don't you think I'm arrogant
[1:19:37] prideful that's that's not true
[1:19:40] cuz I don't listen to me singing I don't
[1:19:45] go home and like wow that was good I
[1:19:48] can't stand my voice because my voice
[1:19:51] wasn't given for me and I work with the
[1:19:54] Ananta y'all understand me I work with
[1:19:57] his anointing yes I think all right I
[1:20:01] gotta go home and listen I gotta play
[1:20:03] this over cuz I thought that was good
[1:20:04] Oh y'all think I'm crazy but they're
[1:20:07] people like that you know the invisible
[1:20:13] God let me hurry up here the invisible
[1:20:17] God I know I can't complete it all but
[1:20:19] what I'm trying to say is that it we
[1:20:21] can't be just church members we've got
[1:20:23] that seek God we gotta lay as the
[1:20:27] prophet of God said in the presence of
[1:20:29] the son play them tapes and when you
[1:20:32] hear you hear something that you know
[1:20:34] you don't you don't have you know what
[1:20:37] you need to do ask for mercy because God
[1:20:39] is rich in
[1:20:40] see we know we've got grace y'all
[1:20:43] understand me grace is unmerited but
[1:20:46] mercy is what we mean cuz we're gettin
[1:20:48] in trouble all of us are coming short
[1:20:51] hello don't tell me you're not you can't
[1:20:54] say you're not if you tell it and you
[1:20:56] don't be truthful every day we're
[1:20:58] falling short and every day we need to
[1:21:01] ask for God's mercy it doesn't mean
[1:21:04] you're not saved you're saying is that
[1:21:07] right you're saved you make a heaven if
[1:21:11] you keep asking for his mercy and really
[1:21:12] mean it
[1:21:13] because the Bible said His mercies are
[1:21:15] renewed every morning it never runs out
[1:21:20] god don't get tired of you saying have
[1:21:23] mercy especially when you mean it and
[1:21:25] when you mean it he comes to your rescue
[1:21:28] whoo she the devil his man you know why
[1:21:33] he's mad cuz some people are beginning
[1:21:35] to see what he's done and how he's
[1:21:39] tricked a lot of people this bride like
[1:21:43] I started this message I said this bride
[1:21:45] is preparing for a new world don't get
[1:21:49] that out of your heart lord help me
[1:21:51] prepare for this new world I know that
[1:21:55] sounds crazy I don't have a world to
[1:21:57] take you to but he does say John 14 that
[1:22:05] not your heart be troubled that's what I
[1:22:07] love about it don't worry about it if
[1:22:09] you believe in God believe also in me in
[1:22:12] my father's house there are many
[1:22:14] mansions if it were not so I wouldn't
[1:22:17] have told you I go to prepare a place
[1:22:19] for you that where I am there you may be
[1:22:22] also
[1:22:23] that's the 14th chapter he's talking
[1:22:26] that and then the 17th chapter says Lord
[1:22:28] father I ask of you one thing that these
[1:22:34] who believe in me according to their
[1:22:37] word Peter Paul James and John I would
[1:22:43] they be with me
[1:22:45] hey Lord you know you know st. John 17
[1:22:49] that God loves us with the love that he
[1:22:53] had for Jesus Christ himself is that
[1:22:59] right
[1:22:59] Paul st. no man ever hated his body oh
[1:23:04] lord have mercy let me hurry up it's
[1:23:07] just okay listen Saint John 10 1929-30
[1:23:15] says my father which gave them me is
[1:23:17] greater than all and no man is able to
[1:23:22] pluck them out of my father's hand do
[1:23:26] you know what that means that means that
[1:23:29] before God I put it this way in the
[1:23:32] beginning before God became logos which
[1:23:39] we know the logos is Jesus Christ
[1:23:41] because before he came became low-cost
[1:23:44] he had already given us an inheritance
[1:23:50] he had already identified us as sons he
[1:23:57] saw the attributes in him and he had to
[1:24:02] make a way for these men attributes to
[1:24:05] be made manifest oh the thing that I
[1:24:08] love is that after this world after this
[1:24:12] scene of the drama hallelujah there will
[1:24:15] not be another Lucifer there not be
[1:24:19] another murder or killing we can't we
[1:24:22] can't even believe we can't even fathom
[1:24:24] a world that there's no stench no
[1:24:29] pollution no water filters everything is
[1:24:35] pure you and I can't even imagine not
[1:24:38] think about this one not having a evil
[1:24:41] thought I told the Lord I said if I
[1:24:46] could get rid of this body I'll be
[1:24:47] perfect it's this thing that causes me
[1:24:52] to fall y'all
[1:24:54] is this thing that caused me to drop
[1:24:56] back
[1:24:57] I know what the inner man is saying I
[1:25:02] know what he wants and he wants to be
[1:25:05] just like his daddy
[1:25:07] all right listen what he says he says no
[1:25:11] make him pluck them out of my hand
[1:25:13] 30 verses I and my father are one father
[1:25:16] I would they be one even as we are one
[1:25:19] you understand me that's a higher being
[1:25:22] there's nothing higher than that being
[1:25:24] you know that's why the bride takes the
[1:25:27] city her reward is greater than all of
[1:25:31] the ages before her you understand me
[1:25:36] this is the hardest and most difficult
[1:25:37] age ever you should all know the dark
[1:25:41] ages no sir you know why because the
[1:25:43] dark ages they recognize the enemy this
[1:25:47] this age is so deceptive and so much
[1:25:50] deception is difficult to to recognize
[1:25:54] the devil sometimes the devil right on
[1:25:56] you and you don't even see him but in
[1:25:59] that day they knew when they were dying
[1:26:01] they were dying for Jesus Christ oh they
[1:26:05] could see their enemy nowadays amen the
[1:26:08] devil come in such a subtle way
[1:26:10] religious not serpent himself around
[1:26:14] y'all understand me and listen when we
[1:26:16] preach we're not trying to preach people
[1:26:18] into some kind of religion we're talking
[1:26:20] about salvation we're talking about
[1:26:22] being filled with the Holy Ghost letting
[1:26:24] God virtues coming to you the Lord and
[1:26:29] don't you understand folks it is a
[1:26:31] battle a battle you love the Lord just
[1:26:38] give me just a few more minutes see the
[1:26:44] Holy Ghost is the father of Jesus Christ
[1:26:46] is that right yeah some people say wait
[1:26:49] a minute buddy two years and then people
[1:26:54] it gotta be two of no it's tier one
[1:26:57] marry his mother when she was exposed to
[1:27:01] Joseph she was found with the child of
[1:27:03] the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the
[1:27:05] father of Jesus Christ and when the Holy
[1:27:08] Ghost comes and reveals the word
[1:27:11] and makes it live just exact then it's a
[1:27:14] revelation to you you see it's unfolded
[1:27:18] for example like myself or like some of
[1:27:21] you who've ever been healed you've been
[1:27:23] healed how did you get it
[1:27:26] you didn't have to pray it was a
[1:27:30] revelation that God had healed you I
[1:27:34] mean we pray right we do pray but many
[1:27:37] people pray and don't get the revelation
[1:27:39] that they healed but when you pray God
[1:27:42] dropped that revelation and whatever
[1:27:44] devil that was in you had to go of
[1:27:48] course you know you were healed there
[1:27:50] was not all brother Bruce listen when
[1:27:53] when I had the cancer and everything and
[1:27:56] you know the doctors and you know
[1:27:57] anything what about it just fell into
[1:27:59] that groove I may have not been here
[1:28:02] today but when you know God is a healer
[1:28:07] hey let me tell you something when Cigna
[1:28:11] strikes you like that you search the
[1:28:13] house you want to make sure ain't
[1:28:17] nothing going into you from your healing
[1:28:19] and I'm gonna tell you just in that time
[1:28:21] I searched the house I ask God God if
[1:28:24] there be anything I've done show me Lord
[1:28:26] and when God showed me there was nothing
[1:28:30] that I had done that's okay I got some
[1:28:35] fighting ground now because if I had
[1:28:37] seen something I've done I'll make it
[1:28:39] right
[1:28:39] you understand me so that's what that's
[1:28:42] the only way God would reveal it to you
[1:28:44] now my point my point is this I'm gonna
[1:28:46] stop because there's no way I can finish
[1:28:48] all of this but my thing is this because
[1:28:52] God I knew they wanted to cut on me and
[1:28:56] do all this kind of stuff and that was
[1:28:58] nonsense and anybody that takes like to
[1:29:02] say it but I put this way God just
[1:29:04] didn't give me a whatever that is for me
[1:29:09] to take revel a radiation I know
[1:29:12] radiation kills you it's poison
[1:29:16] and whatever it if it doesn't kill the
[1:29:18] cancer is killing everything else
[1:29:21] doctors alone at that's why so many
[1:29:23] doctors are afraid to get cancer
[1:29:24] they don't look answer cuz they don't
[1:29:27] believe in and they don't know nothing
[1:29:28] that can cure it and they test and try
[1:29:32] you just like my friend my friend I just
[1:29:35] died just prior to me leaving the one
[1:29:38] that was in South Africa a precious
[1:29:39] friend of mine and I told him about how
[1:29:42] God healed me and the next time I talked
[1:29:44] to him he was telling me he was on
[1:29:46] radiation and I just couldn't say
[1:29:48] nothing I was so discouraged by his him
[1:29:50] doing that but he said that's where he
[1:29:52] was and so what can I say about it if
[1:29:54] you feel led to do it then do it I stood
[1:29:57] with him though in spite of it all and
[1:29:59] then the next thing I know Amen they
[1:30:02] telling him Amen that they gonna give
[1:30:05] him a new liver they gave him a liver I
[1:30:10] don't know how I prayed if his wife is
[1:30:13] listening to this that she understand my
[1:30:15] thoughts about it you know he's going on
[1:30:18] to be with the Lord and he did the best
[1:30:19] he could and he felt led to do it and
[1:30:22] you know one thing for certain of God
[1:30:23] was God was finished with him and that's
[1:30:27] the way God led him to go to take him
[1:30:29] out but I'm saying as for me I wouldn't
[1:30:31] have gone that way and and the thing is
[1:30:34] that they gave him his blood type if I
[1:30:36] got it correctly his blood type was a
[1:30:38] and then the liver donor was B plus a B
[1:30:43] they killed it they gave all this
[1:30:47] medication trying to make it work it was
[1:30:49] not going without a miracle it wasn't
[1:30:52] gonna work and then the the gallbladder
[1:30:54] or whatever that they found had melanoma
[1:30:57] so they had to take that portion of the
[1:30:59] cancer off the liver where every
[1:31:01] location I don't know but wherever it
[1:31:04] was they had to do that you understand
[1:31:06] me
[1:31:06] the man lived they didn't kind of you
[1:31:08] know his kidneys failed a bit more time
[1:31:10] he bled out one time and he still lived
[1:31:13] but one day he told me that he had a
[1:31:16] dream and he in this dimension he saw
[1:31:20] living stones and he said he saw the
[1:31:24] high priest of God that he described him
[1:31:27] to me
[1:31:28] I never said this to him but I thought
[1:31:31] to myself I said well brother yeah God
[1:31:36] got you on your way out I never told him
[1:31:38] that so but anyway when he died just
[1:31:40] like I said a few days before I left to
[1:31:43] go to Guyana was really uh it was just a
[1:31:49] very odd situation because he and I have
[1:31:52] been discussing the word all almost two
[1:31:56] to three times a week
[1:31:58] by God's grace
[1:32:01] but he still lives my brother's not dead
[1:32:06] he sleeps and I can't Holly wait to see
[1:32:10] him on the other side no matter which
[1:32:14] way we go we got to go one way or the
[1:32:16] other and I've seen God do some reckless
[1:32:22] things but when that doctor wanted me to
[1:32:26] take radiation and all that stuff I told
[1:32:28] him no you know why I don't love this
[1:32:32] life like that I don't and I'm not
[1:32:38] afraid of death I ain't holding on to
[1:32:41] nothing
[1:32:41] got it my wife don't like me talking
[1:32:44] like this but it's the truth
[1:32:47] because somebody had to leave me death
[1:32:54] is what happens somebody gonna leave you
[1:32:57] are you gonna leave somebody that's the
[1:33:02] way it works huh and I'll be honest with
[1:33:06] you I said God took care of me when
[1:33:07] everybody left me he'll take care of you
[1:33:11] when I leave ya
[1:33:13] he's got everything planned you love the
[1:33:18] Lord and I must say we must labor to
[1:33:22] enter into his rest y'all know what I'm
[1:33:24] saying and when I say that I'm closing
[1:33:27] now cuz I keep going but you see you got
[1:33:30] to come to a place where you got to
[1:33:31] believe what's being preached not just
[1:33:34] for me but from the prophet of God you
[1:33:36] got to believe that that is the only way
[1:33:39] faith is the only thing that will make
[1:33:41] it live
[1:33:44] you can't come oh I hope it's for me no
[1:33:47] it's got to be for you hope don't work
[1:33:50] not in this situation
[1:33:53] you gotta have faith you see what I mean
[1:33:55] yes brother branham how well I mean how
[1:33:59] can I make the rapture he said you know
[1:34:01] what he said read your Bible every day
[1:34:03] and pray why because if you read your
[1:34:05] Bible every day and pray God will change
[1:34:09] you and give you the faith that you need
[1:34:10] to operate it that's how simple it is
[1:34:15] read your Bible everyday and pray God
[1:34:18] will open the word to you is that right
[1:34:20] he would give you the faith to put it in
[1:34:23] action it ain't complicated it's simple
[1:34:26] but what we need to do is focus I'm
[1:34:30] gonna make this rapture Lord help me
[1:34:34] give me your grace in your mercy that I
[1:34:37] will cut loose everything that's not
[1:34:39] like you that I will become pleasing to
[1:34:42] you and that I will become that very
