[20:46] [Music]
[20:57] [Music]
[21:27] [Applause]
[21:31] [Music]
[21:40] my soul
[21:46] [Music]
[21:59] [Music]
[22:01] I
[22:36] by which testimony to start I'm just I'm
[22:40] just I've been going through some
[22:42] battles where the devil will tell me
[22:45] that God won't answer my prayers anymore
[22:47] and for sometimes I start I kind of
[22:50] believe that because there are things I
[22:52] was praying to God and it seems like it
[22:54] was he wasn't answering so I went
[22:57] through like almost like a depression
[22:59] depression time well where I thought
[23:02] that God was not answering my prayers
[23:04] anymore but um still there was just that
[23:09] faith inside of me that you still I
[23:11] still know that I mean even if it
[23:13] doesn't answer some prayers but His Word
[23:15] is still true like if he says ask and
[23:18] you shall be given as to I don't know
[23:19] how to explain that but I still knew
[23:21] that his word was true and also one day
[23:24] actually Frank should have given that
[23:26] testimony but I don't know why I didn't
[23:28] give the testimony but so one day just
[23:32] in the middle of the depression I texted
[23:34] Frank and it was a he was at school and
[23:36] I asked him where it was and he told me
[23:38] that school and I told him and he told
[23:41] me lost his car key and all it's been
[23:44] it's been searching for that for a long
[23:45] time and he can't find it and I'm like
[23:47] okay I'll pray for you still the devil
[23:50] telling me that God isn't its he won't
[23:53] even matter if I pray because God
[23:54] doesn't even answer my prayers anymore
[23:56] but I still told him I'll pray for you
[23:58] and I prayed for him and I told God that
[24:01] because I've had I've had some
[24:02] experiences where God showed me where
[24:04] certain things that were lost were and
[24:07] so I told God that you know where the
[24:09] key is so if you can help find I'll help
[24:13] Frank find the key or you take that key
[24:16] you bring it to Frank and in less than
[24:19] five minutes Frank texted me told me you
[24:21] found the key
[24:24] somebody somebody had the somebody
[24:26] turned the key to the security officer
[24:28] and the security officer brought it to
[24:30] Frank so that was very very encouraging
[24:34] to me cause oh I know the devil is a
[24:37] liar he always tells me that God doesn't
[24:39] answer my prayers
[24:40] and he's still telling me that that's
[24:42] why I had some hard times not knowing
[24:44] which testimony to start by because I
[24:47] knew that I still know God is to God
[24:49] Israel you just gotta learn how to check
[24:51] his yes and those two another one was um
[24:55] I've been going to some financial
[24:57] battles and um so yeah that was today
[25:02] about two days ago I went to do a
[25:03] demonstration for like a me salesman and
[25:06] I do demonstration for my product and um
[25:08] when I enter into that the house I mean
[25:14] that's the I noticed like do it there
[25:16] was the husband and his wife and as
[25:18] after a child his phone his phone rang
[25:21] and I heard like I can only imagine that
[25:23] was his ringtone and I thought dear
[25:26] Christians so um that made me
[25:28] comfortable and I started talking and I
[25:31] went to the bathroom to like put one of
[25:32] my device there and I saw the Bible in
[25:34] the bathroom was like oh wow and I asked
[25:36] him what were you reading and he said I
[25:38] was reading The Book of Isaiah and um
[25:40] and in the made me comfortable we
[25:42] started sharing about the word and it
[25:44] was talking about how nowadays many
[25:46] people have their own interpretation of
[25:48] the word and I was like you definitely
[25:50] true and one of those is Matthew 28
[25:54] where Jesus says baptize in the name of
[25:56] Father Son and Holy Ghost but then men
[25:59] have brought their own interpretation of
[26:01] baptizing name of Father Son and Holy
[26:03] Ghost but nowhere in the Bible you see
[26:05] the baptism in the name of Father Son
[26:06] and Holy Ghost and I explained to them
[26:08] Jesus the baptism in jesus name they
[26:10] were just like wow we've never heard of
[26:13] this before and oh they were very amazed
[26:16] and then I just like his wife had like a
[26:19] share to live on oxygen support she'd
[26:22] locked a long oxygen line that should
[26:24] drag everywhere she goes
[26:25] and I that made me sad and I asked her
[26:27] like how did you like do you mind
[26:30] sharing how you what's wrong with you
[26:31] and she's like yeah she they diagnosed
[26:34] they diagnosed me with all these disease
[26:36] and it's been there I think it's like Oh
[26:39] from father to son to likely just like
[26:43] from generation to generation and I saw
[26:45] is there in any way you can get rid of
[26:47] that she's like no like I'm gonna stay
[26:49] like that for the rest of my life and
[26:51] she can't she can't work she has kids
[26:53] they're really good people and I told
[26:57] her but you know you don't have to stay
[26:58] that way because when Jesus died for you
[27:00] on the cross if that's so you can be
[27:02] healed and saved it wasn't just for you
[27:04] your salvation but also your healing and
[27:07] I started telling her about those
[27:10] Bradburn I'm so disturb Abraham Lincoln
[27:12] how that one guy was already pardoned
[27:15] but he refused his pardon because he
[27:17] thought I was a joke and then so pardon
[27:20] his pardon if it's receivers pardon and
[27:22] healing is healing if it's received as
[27:24] healing and I really encouraged her and
[27:26] I noticed the guy will go outside and
[27:28] smoke cigarette and I'm like well you
[27:32] know the and after the normally I'm not
[27:35] even supposed to talk about religion at
[27:36] work but just because they made me do it
[27:38] I just had to do it and oh so I told him
[27:42] you know the Bible says that your body
[27:44] is a temple of the Holy Ghost so you
[27:46] shouldn't defile it when you go and
[27:48] smoke cigarette and you claim to be a
[27:50] Christian it's like yeah that's sure
[27:52] unlike you guys do you promise that if
[27:54] I'll pray for your wife but you promise
[27:57] that if God kills your wife you're going
[28:00] to give up the bad habit of smoking
[28:01] cigarettes but I just try to do what
[28:03] bourbon and we're doing the prayer lines
[28:05] and I'm like do you promise that if God
[28:08] will heal your wife that you'll give up
[28:10] the bad habit and you guys both of you
[28:12] you will give your life to Jesus and
[28:14] you'll be baptized the right way the
[28:15] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ
[28:16] they're like yes no doubt about it and
[28:20] I'm like wow that's a good thing so
[28:22] let's join hands and pray so we just
[28:24] join hand and pray and I told them to
[28:27] keep believing and I just keep trusting
[28:29] even when the devil keeps telling me
[28:31] that God is not answering my prayers but
[28:33] I keep trusting
[28:34] I just did what brother but I'm told us
[28:36] to do to apply the token everywhere we
[28:38] go and also it's up to God now to do and
[28:42] just keep praying for them and all god
[28:44] bless you

[42:27] amen amen amen
[42:29] as we stand we'll go right into the word
[42:35] of the Lord
[42:37] appreciate the musicians amen those of
[42:42] us who were not here on Wednesday night
[42:45] the Lord really blessed us and I'm
[42:53] looking for the Lord to do exceedingly
[42:57] above that I'm an expectation of all of
[43:05] the things that have been prophesied for
[43:08] us but I know that the only place these
[43:16] things could happen is that we find
[43:17] ourselves in that provided place the
[43:23] Prophet God tells us that the only place
[43:25] of worship in this day is under the
[43:28] blood of Jesus Christ
[43:31] so as we stand I want us to turn to
[43:34] Exodus the twelfth chapter will read the
[43:39] 13th verse there there's a lot I'd like
[43:45] to say and I trust that God will grant
[43:48] us this morning not my thoughts but his
[43:51] thoughts that we will speak to this
[43:54] morning to all of us I believe that we
[43:58] are living in a time where it's very
[44:00] serious and we need to know that it is
[44:07] the will of God or what the will of God
[44:09] is for us so Exodus the 12th chapter
[44:14] xiii verse and
[44:21] shall be to you for token upon the
[44:26] houses where you are and when I see the
[44:30] Blood I will pass over you and the
[44:35] plague shall not be upon you to destroy
[44:38] you when I smite the land of Egypt
[44:43] hallelujah
[44:45] let us pray father God we come before
[44:49] you Lord we thank you for your grace and
[44:52] your mercy we thank you for being so
[44:56] good to us and Lord we thank you Lord
[44:59] for all that you have done for us and
[45:03] everything that you are doing for us God
[45:06] I I see your perfect plan and I see how
[45:11] you have protected us throughout all the
[45:14] ages and Lord we realize this morning
[45:18] that even our our standing here is not
[45:21] some coincidence it's not some freak
[45:24] accident of science but Lord you chose
[45:29] us and elected us before the foundation
[45:31] of the world and father we know that
[45:35] your word is sure and stedfast and
[45:38] father we believe because that was your
[45:41] theme song Lord when you came Oh God in
[45:44] in in in the mask of William Branham
[45:47] that song was sang almost every service
[45:51] only believed and father we believe this
[45:55] morning Oh God that that's all that we
[45:58] can do that means no space for doubt no
[46:02] space for fear there's no space for
[46:05] reasoning Lord we thank you for the the
[46:10] revelation of only believe thank you
[46:15] Lord for all that you are and all that
[46:17] you are doing for us in Jesus Christ's
[46:20] name we pray amen you may be seated
[46:28] I like to entitle the message this
[46:32] morning facing the plagues of Egypt and
[46:39] we realized by God's grace day prophet
[46:43] of God spoke a message on the token
[46:47] after the seals were opened and one of
[46:53] the greater things messages that he
[46:56] spoke after the seas were open was the
[47:02] token and God revealed in simplicity we
[47:10] have to know that in the line of duty we
[47:19] must understand that we must all come
[47:23] under the blood in that time in Egypt I
[47:32] find it amazing how God hundreds of
[47:38] years ago could lay out such a plan that
[47:42] we could actually look back and see that
[47:44] that plan not only was for them but for
[47:46] us haven't missed a beat everything
[47:52] perfect in its own way we realized by
[47:57] God's grace that the only way that we'll
[47:59] make a rapture is that we believe all of
[48:03] the word by one word we have found
[48:08] ourselves in this fallen condition and
[48:12] we are yearning and groaning amen for
[48:18] our new home but understand that the
[48:22] blood of Jesus Christ or the revelation
[48:24] of the blood of Jesus Christ can only be
[48:27] given to those who are elected we
[48:30] realize Amen that when God shed his
[48:33] blood on Calvary even though he
[48:36] purchased the whole entire earth or the
[48:39] whole entire world
[48:41] everybody will not be saved so for those
[48:45] of us who are failing to see how blessed
[48:48] you are I hope by the end of the service
[48:52] you'll see that the message itself come
[48:54] to give you Liberty but one thing about
[48:58] God is that he will never force anything
[49:01] on you the Word of God say whosoever
[49:04] will let him come now I don't know about
[49:08] you but my anchor holds you and I must
[49:12] understand that we're living in a time
[49:14] when when when when if you don't have
[49:17] Jesus you're in trouble because there
[49:23] are two pools one pool is in pulling you
[49:26] downwards and the other pool is pulling
[49:29] you up to heaven even brother branham's
[49:32] had two facets one facet is to believer
[49:36] the other facet of this message is the
[49:39] unbeliever one this message come to
[49:43] condemn and the other one the message
[49:46] come to give liberty is that right you
[49:49] and I must understand that the life is
[49:51] in the blood now we do not put blood on
[49:55] the doorpost in a little we're not
[49:57] looking for a man whose hands are
[49:59] bleeding we're not looking for somebody
[50:01] who has scars on his brow because we
[50:05] realized where the word of God is you
[50:08] and I must understand Amen that the
[50:11] blood of Jesus Christ came to not only
[50:13] justify us sanctify us is that right
[50:17] Amen - give us the Holy Ghost so that
[50:22] Christ Himself can live in us now the
[50:25] Bible tells us not to grieve grieve not
[50:28] the Holy Ghost and see a lot of time
[50:30] like I was speaking on Wednesday you
[50:33] know we've got to be connected is that
[50:39] right it has to be a connection between
[50:41] God and you and I think that's what has
[50:45] happened to a lot of people they have
[50:47] lived what you call an artificial
[50:51] Christian experience because
[50:54] they have allowed systems to - - how
[50:58] could I say it they have allowed systems
[51:00] to reform them but this message come not
[51:05] to reform you it comes to transform you
[51:09] right anybody can have false teeth and
[51:13] and use them and a false arm or leg and
[51:18] use it but in reality that false arm and
[51:22] that false leg is not you you'll never
[51:26] be connected with those things even
[51:30] though they are useful brother branham
[51:33] actually liking it on to this he said
[51:35] that's the way it is like a lot of times
[51:38] we think that even Christians who are of
[51:42] their denomination those who are born of
[51:44] a denomination sometimes they have a
[51:46] denominational spirit and therefore they
[51:49] can't see the truth no matter how much
[51:52] you give them the word they cannot see
[51:55] the truth because their experience is
[51:58] not a world experience it is a
[52:01] denominational spirit so let us be
[52:04] careful because no system can save you
[52:09] because you were raised in the message
[52:11] or raised around the message and you
[52:14] know God the Prophet and you know
[52:16] his name is William Branham
[52:18] you know Amen that God opened the seals
[52:20] you know that there have been thunders
[52:22] and lightnings hallelujah that still
[52:25] does not save you because in order for
[52:29] you to make a rapture you must be
[52:32] connected you must be born again this is
[52:37] why I put emphasis on it because we are
[52:41] now experiencing a lot of things not in
[52:45] just America but all over the world and
[52:48] the only way of your escape is to be
[52:52] found underneath the blood of Jesus
[52:55] Christ when we see how people don't seem
[53:00] to understand you can't play with this
[53:03] it ain't something that you can just
[53:06] have an option
[53:08] because remember priests don't Esther
[53:11] Esther amen excuse me I preached Amen on
[53:15] Unown Esther and the other day I
[53:18] preached her own vasti right and that's
[53:23] tea refused the king's call and a lot of
[53:27] time we think because we come out of
[53:29] denomination and we come out of
[53:31] organization praise God I got it made
[53:34] well the children of Israel came out of
[53:36] Egypt and they still didn't having me
[53:39] they knew that Moses was a prophet and
[53:42] they still did not have it made
[53:46] hallelujah and in the 40 years of
[53:48] Jehovah teaching them in the wilderness
[53:51] showing them that he was still still God
[53:55] there is none of them sick out of two
[53:58] million people are law none was sick ha
[54:03] because they had a smitten Rock and they
[54:07] had a pillar fire and the blood had been
[54:10] applied somebody helped me here see they
[54:14] were protected from all of the germs and
[54:18] diseases that they could have contracted
[54:22] while they were in the wilderness
[54:24] hallelujah and think about this God will
[54:28] heal you
[54:29] God will will deliver you from diseases
[54:32] he will protect you even prosper you but
[54:36] that still doesn't mean you got in me
[54:38] because the children of Israel it meant
[54:42] in the wilderness they did they met the
[54:45] shoes never rule out that clause never
[54:48] got ragged hallelujah but there was one
[54:50] thing they did not have they did not
[54:53] have the connection to Jehovah they saw
[54:58] who Moses was and in their mind they saw
[55:01] Moses as a man who was trying to exalt
[55:04] himself hallelujah
[55:07] so is it today we look at William
[55:10] Branham and many people looking at him
[55:12] not even understanding who he is or who
[55:14] he lost and we look at him as though he
[55:17] was a man
[55:18] who God exalted but you let me let me
[55:21] say like this
[55:21] that still doesn't fix it the Bible says
[55:26] that Joshua and Caleb had a different
[55:28] experience somehow they met the God that
[55:33] was moving Moses like that they knew
[55:37] that Moses what could not have come up
[55:39] with the things that he came up with so
[55:43] they had an experience somewhere reading
[55:46] between the lines they had the same Holy
[55:49] Ghost or the same anointing that Moses
[55:53] had that's why they did not blaspheme
[55:59] Josh when Caleb
[56:01] they followed every word Moses spoke and
[56:04] at the end of the day of their
[56:07] generation they were only the only two
[56:10] that God did not destroy y'all hear what
[56:14] I'm saying you see because God protected
[56:17] them when the Death Angel came in while
[56:21] they were in Egypt God protected them ah
[56:27] because they had the blood on the
[56:30] doorpost and 11 but what they fail to
[56:34] see was that the blood justified them
[56:37] when they came through the waters they
[56:40] meant it was baptized unto Moses he
[56:43] meant the blood the water sanctified
[56:45] just i sanctified them but you gotta
[56:48] understand after being sanctified that's
[56:52] when the test comes in God told him Amen
[56:57] that he put them out of the wilderness
[56:59] in the wilderness to be what tested so
[57:03] that they could see what was in their
[57:05] hearts God knew wasn't what was in their
[57:08] hearts just like God knows what's in
[57:10] your heart
[57:10] God knew what was in their heart he put
[57:13] them out because you see nobody would be
[57:16] able to stand before God as his Lord you
[57:19] was unfair because God give everybody a
[57:24] fair chance somebody help me even when
[57:28] he know you're not gonna go any further
[57:32] hallelujah is that right
[57:34] it's true the same thing happens with
[57:38] this message animalic I saw hallelujah
[57:45] the number of people who saw the
[57:48] miraculous saw the pillar fire there in
[57:53] the meetings and where are they now
[57:56] hallelujah remember you said oh if I
[58:03] could go back to Egypt oh I remember the
[58:07] millions and the leaks and all of the
[58:09] good things we had over there see we
[58:11] weren't so we're not so organized that
[58:15] we could produce such stuff is that
[58:17] because we're on a journey we're
[58:21] travelling we're trying to meet me
[58:24] heaven our home but the Bible tells me
[58:28] that because of the murmuring and
[58:31] complaining believe you me if God judged
[58:34] him doing for that God will judge you
[58:37] now for that because of the murmuring
[58:40] and complaining always in God's face as
[58:42] the God is unjust hallelujah he is he
[58:49] your the claim he's the potter he knows
[58:53] how to load and make you and oftentimes
[58:56] we need to hush and let God Mode and
[58:59] make us facing oh I can hardly stand it
[59:07] when everybody who's in here yeah were
[59:09] you clothed you fed him then you got a
[59:11] nice hole and then a place to stay and
[59:14] live and we complain to God because we
[59:16] don't have nonsense nonsense pride is
[59:21] the thing that makes you want more than
[59:23] what you necessarily need I remember the
[59:32] time and I must job just for a moment
[59:33] cuz I feel led to go this way I was over
[59:36] in India where kids didn't even have
[59:39] clothes to wear not y'all hear what I'm
[59:42] saying not just kids
[59:43] people had
[59:45] no closer where they had cardboard boxes
[59:48] as houses but one thing I saw in them
[59:52] that I've rarely see in what we call
[59:55] Christians and that's joy they will
[59:59] content with what they had the fact and
[1:00:03] then the brother went out about three or
[1:00:05] four o'clock in the morning because we
[1:00:07] wanted to get to the real poor we wanted
[1:00:09] to get to those who were not pretending
[1:00:10] and we were just passing out candy and
[1:00:13] this one little boy saw us he could
[1:00:16] recognize we were I guess Americans or
[1:00:17] whatever he ran into us too big
[1:00:20] amen we just said I just gave him some
[1:00:22] candy you know what that little boy did
[1:00:24] I'll never forget it
[1:00:26] he ran and he went and got all of his
[1:00:32] buddies all of his friends and they all
[1:00:37] came we had to be confident we wouldn't
[1:00:40] be still paid but it touched my heart so
[1:00:44] much this made this little boy who say
[1:00:47] here he could be back in his pockets but
[1:00:50] he went and got his friends so they
[1:00:53] could share awesome
[1:00:56] just-just-just and I left there thinking
[1:00:59] who is the rich man the one who has
[1:01:04] character and the one who has wealth
[1:01:06] with no character hello somebody I'm a
[1:01:12] preach on anyway now you must understand
[1:01:15] that God amen
[1:01:17] this is the age of repentance how many
[1:01:19] y'all know that and now you say why why
[1:01:22] you bringing it up because it's so hard
[1:01:24] to get people to repent wish there was
[1:01:30] such a beautiful night everybody came to
[1:01:33] the altar didn't have to ask much didn't
[1:01:36] have to beg everybody was down only
[1:01:39] needs one wait one place or another
[1:01:41] crying out or speaking to God I was so
[1:01:44] moved and so touches as Lord that's what
[1:01:47] I like because the Bible said our broken
[1:01:50] and contrite spirit is what God delights
[1:01:53] in prideful look he hates it
[1:01:57] he hates a prize for luck and yet we'll
[1:02:01] come in here looking prideful according
[1:02:09] to the fourth seal the Prophet Goss said
[1:02:14] I might just give you an individual a
[1:02:19] little shake here he said to refuse God
[1:02:23] to refuse God call you know what I'm
[1:02:27] trying to say he said O Lord I came out
[1:02:29] I came out but you see what it is we
[1:02:31] fail to see we got to go in and you
[1:02:35] can't go in without the character of
[1:02:37] Christ Peter tells us it meant how that
[1:02:41] there has been an entrance and
[1:02:43] interested to what that same door it
[1:02:46] meant that the foolish virgins could not
[1:02:48] go in the wise went in because they
[1:02:53] didn't stop in the middle of the trip
[1:02:55] they kept moving because they knew that
[1:02:58] the time and the season was an urgent
[1:03:01] season your character must be shaped it
[1:03:07] must be formed into the image of God and
[1:03:11] you're going to if you are elected let
[1:03:14] me put it this way if you are elected to
[1:03:16] make a rapture it's going to be done
[1:03:21] whether you like it or not you're going
[1:03:25] to either be led by like God leads a
[1:03:27] lamb or driven like cattle he's going to
[1:03:33] get it he said Oh brothers why would you
[1:03:38] say that Jacob was elected and God put
[1:03:42] Jacob in such a position for 14 years he
[1:03:46] fought but by the time God finished with
[1:03:51] him he was ready to be sealed with the
[1:03:54] Holy Ghost he was ready Amen to wrassle
[1:03:57] with the angel see some of us ain't
[1:03:59] ready that's why we ain't got what we
[1:04:01] say we have related people we just want
[1:04:06] God to just drop in on us brother man
[1:04:09] who said no no no
[1:04:11] God ain't pulling nobody through a tube
[1:04:13] you got to work for this salvation and
[1:04:16] about said work out your own salvation
[1:04:19] you can't work mine out and I can't work
[1:04:22] yours out
[1:04:23] you got to work your own hello in nobody
[1:04:28] knows like you know the demons that you
[1:04:32] have in you every bit of those dark
[1:04:36] thoughts and you must go out every demon
[1:04:40] that you're possessing so I ain't
[1:04:42] possessed no demons yes you are if
[1:04:44] you're not filled and sealed with the
[1:04:46] Holy Ghost
[1:04:47] you got some demons that ain't nothin
[1:04:52] but the truth the Holy Ghost comes like
[1:04:56] brother Baron said in the future home he
[1:04:58] said we're not sure when that earth gets
[1:05:01] its fire baptism he said people complain
[1:05:03] about all the noise in the sound I wish
[1:05:07] I had some noise and sound in here it
[1:05:11] shows we ain't where we think we are
[1:05:13] mm-hmm you think how to get people to
[1:05:15] say Amen real good they get attitudes
[1:05:18] because you preach it on them I'm
[1:05:20] preaching on you this morning
[1:05:23] ha because God told me so and let me say
[1:05:28] it like these people of God there is no
[1:05:31] gospel real gospel that will not cut you
[1:05:35] every true gospel come to rebuke is that
[1:05:40] right Laodicea he said I come to rebuke
[1:05:44] you and be zealous to repent and when
[1:05:49] you repent that means you ready to turn
[1:05:50] from the evil that you're doing now you
[1:06:00] tell me y'all I need I need more help I
[1:06:03] need more God huh yeah yeah you don't
[1:06:08] have to raise your hand and all you know
[1:06:10] what I know you do cuz you're human you
[1:06:14] got flesh when you take this flesh off
[1:06:19] you don't need no help but as long as
[1:06:22] you got this man on you Oh
[1:06:24] we go give you trouble and that's why
[1:06:26] the pot tank called the kettle black
[1:06:29] every one of us need help that right
[1:06:33] even brother Brendan said he confesses
[1:06:35] he sees everyday the prophet of God at
[1:06:39] least acknowledged he has problems some
[1:06:42] of us think we don't he said but oh when
[1:06:46] I see the Blood I pass over you who
[1:06:49] praise God
[1:06:51] see and when she refused it let me see
[1:06:56] and just like that church did excuse me
[1:06:59] it's over see God
[1:07:02] patience will not always strive with man
[1:07:07] y'all think I'm gonna keep putting up
[1:07:09] with y'all nonsense
[1:07:10] he ain't gonna put up with mine and he
[1:07:13] ain't gonna put up with yours and when
[1:07:17] she refused it and refused to accept it
[1:07:21] then she can change right she's got a
[1:07:26] name called death why because she
[1:07:30] refused but what would you say while
[1:07:34] they were in Egypt they accept escaped
[1:07:38] the death angel but when they got in the
[1:07:42] wilderness they failed to see that the
[1:07:44] death angel was coming again hmm
[1:07:47] understand if you refuse God's character
[1:07:52] when he's telling you you must have
[1:07:54] patience he's telling you you must have
[1:07:57] knowledge and the private God said this
[1:07:59] is a battle this is a fight you've got
[1:08:02] to have these things ever I'm telling
[1:08:05] you it's not because you believe in
[1:08:07] America you if you really believe in
[1:08:09] Malachi 4 and the message in which God
[1:08:12] has brought you'll be pressing toward
[1:08:14] the mark you do everything you can do
[1:08:18] hallelujah
[1:08:19] even though you know it's by grace
[1:08:21] you'll do everything you can do to make
[1:08:25] things right but when you refuses it
[1:08:31] that's what God won't put up with when
[1:08:34] you know to do good and do it not we
[1:08:36] know us we know it's nicotine but we
[1:08:38] understand that the bride of Jesus
[1:08:39] Christ she's not made like that
[1:08:43] she's not made like that she's a woman
[1:08:46] that says Lord whatever your will is let
[1:08:48] your will be done in our lives she's
[1:08:52] that kind of a woman right see I've even
[1:08:56] I really take her children and listen if
[1:08:58] God had me and a brother me and Troy I
[1:09:00] was just talking in a it's so true if
[1:09:05] you think is bad now i'ma say like this
[1:09:07] let me use this scenario brother Ellen
[1:09:11] said that the Catholic Church was the
[1:09:14] true Church of God one time they
[1:09:19] actually believed in acts 2:38 they
[1:09:22] believed in the baptism of the Holy
[1:09:23] Ghost they were the true Pentecostal
[1:09:26] Church of Rome and look how far they
[1:09:32] have fallen the real deal and think
[1:09:37] about this they meant that how God has
[1:09:40] come and in the Prophet I told the
[1:09:43] Pentecostal church just give you a long
[1:09:45] long time and you'll be worse than the
[1:09:48] Catholic Church hello and they are at
[1:09:54] least the Catholic Church people know
[1:09:56] what they worship Him
[1:09:57] a lot of them know what they worship it
[1:10:01] but the Pentecostal people don't know
[1:10:03] what they worship it do you know what
[1:10:05] you worship it because if you're not
[1:10:08] worshiping god you're worshiping the
[1:10:10] devil and because people go to different
[1:10:14] churches don't need their true
[1:10:16] Christians give them the word test and
[1:10:20] if they don't take the word that means
[1:10:21] they're born of another seed that's true
[1:10:28] what happens that's what I'm saying you
[1:10:30] know why I'm telling you all this
[1:10:31] because if you don't press into Christ
[1:10:34] you're going to get worse your habits
[1:10:39] will increase your bondage will increase
[1:10:42] if you refuse God he will refuse him for
[1:10:46] the last time and God is gonna reject
[1:10:48] you he's not a respect to person
[1:10:52] making sense no brother books
[1:10:57] everybody ain't creaking like this I I'm
[1:10:59] not concerned because I have to give an
[1:11:02] account for those who I pastor and let
[1:11:05] me tell you like this
[1:11:07] but the velum said I think he said the
[1:11:08] preachers ought to be telling the people
[1:11:10] about the end time the time we're living
[1:11:13] in do you realize we are living in the
[1:11:17] time where the fourth horse rider is
[1:11:20] riding do you all know who that is
[1:11:22] that's death that's that pale horse
[1:11:27] it meant that mixture and his death is
[1:11:32] not natural spiritual look if you do not
[1:11:37] press into we don't have to wonder what
[1:11:43] the end is going to be
[1:11:46] he says I've even taken their children
[1:11:48] the Protestants and ice-cream sometimes
[1:11:52] every time I think about it every time I
[1:11:56] think about those 400 preachers who's
[1:11:58] supposed to meet brother Branham down
[1:12:00] there and Jefferson via to be baptized
[1:12:02] in the name of Jesus Christ they didn't
[1:12:06] even show up what did they do they
[1:12:10] rejected the gospel and not only because
[1:12:13] they rejected it everybody they preached
[1:12:16] to if the blind leader Lisa bride they
[1:12:20] both fall in the ditch
[1:12:22] thank about the thousands of people
[1:12:24] under those ministries who thought they
[1:12:27] were saved the only way they could have
[1:12:31] ever been saved is that God gave them
[1:12:33] grace to escape come out of her my
[1:12:35] people no system can save you I'm going
[1:12:40] to tell you that over and over again no
[1:12:42] system can save you
[1:12:45] y'all don't have to believe me but I
[1:12:47] know I'm of God what was it you know
[1:12:56] when that that was given out in the Age
[1:12:57] of Thyatira when the woman wanted to be
[1:13:01] the boss
[1:13:04] hello and don't tell me that that the

[1:13:59] them to repent look how long it's been
[1:14:03] brother Branham is off the scene and
[1:14:05] look what we're doing the very stuff he

[1:14:28] are you saying let me let me jump here
[1:14:29] just for a moment the corona virus is
[1:14:32] now plaguing nations now they say is
[1:14:38] here it's not some false propaganda it's
[1:14:43] real
[1:14:43] people are dying their only protection
[1:14:52] when I see the blood I'll pass over your
[1:14:57] your only protection this is why I'm
[1:15:00] screaming I can't help it the only
[1:15:03] protection doesn't will be the blood of
[1:15:07] Jesus not because I think I've got it
[1:15:11] you got to know that you have it the
[1:15:15] blood must be on display and his
[1:15:17] the chemistry is to life that means
[1:15:23] people supposed to see the life of the
[1:15:25] blood living through you here oh I got
[1:15:31] it let me tell you but let me tell you
[1:15:32] something even if you've got let me say
[1:15:34] like this what good will it do you if
[1:15:36] the faith of it not is not on display
[1:15:38] you got to have faith in what blood
[1:15:46] y'all believe that I believe it I'm
[1:15:51] gonna get there I've got a few quotes on
[1:15:52] germ warfare because y'all don't
[1:15:54] understand I looked it up even on the
[1:15:55] internet today and I thought on my phone
[1:15:57] and I thought oh my god I didn't realize
[1:15:59] it was so vast I didn't realize that
[1:16:01] they've been experiencing with this
[1:16:03] stuff for a long time America and
[1:16:05] everybody anthrax you name it they've
[1:16:07] got all kinds of these jars locked up
[1:16:10] that they have hydrated you understand
[1:16:13] me that means a demon out of hell has
[1:16:16] gotten into it and Jesus listen in
[1:16:25] the days of each of these in place and
[1:16:28] everything else and I used to wonder
[1:16:30] when I used to read this revelation and
[1:16:32] I thought oh my God look at this look at
[1:16:34] this I'll be playing everything else you
[1:16:37] know scorpions Olga and the Bible said
[1:16:40] and the people would not repent God we
[1:16:46] live in the same day we live in a day
[1:16:49] right now where the people will not
[1:16:50] repent they don't repent they don't want
[1:16:55] to repent not your bad shape you don't
[1:17:01] repent have you ever been in a place you
[1:17:06] want to cry and you can't cry that's an
[1:17:08] awful feeling but if you still want to
[1:17:14] cry God can give you some tears but if
[1:17:18] you don't want to repent he can't give
[1:17:20] you nothing
[1:17:21] am I making sense I know this is a hard
[1:17:25] message for people of God I'm I'm
[1:17:27] looking for a revival and the only way
[1:17:29] revival can come is that we
[1:17:31] clean up car can't see no revival in a
[1:17:34] trashy place and I don't know your lies
[1:17:36] but one thing I know I could tell by the
[1:17:38] atmosphere that things ain't right and
[1:17:42] when we come in here and our lives are
[1:17:44] not right
[1:17:44] we greed the Holy Ghost it's not up to
[1:17:51] the song leader to get you stirred up
[1:17:53] he's supposed to come in here stirred up
[1:17:55] am I making sense come in here with your
[1:17:57] fire and I don't care if it's just one
[1:18:00] person one person would fire can let let
[1:18:02] like the whole church on fire let me
[1:18:06] move on and now last days he promised a
[1:18:09] game that he was sin a message to call
[1:18:14] her out i'ma read that again brother
[1:18:16] sorry and now in the last days he
[1:18:19] promised again that he was sin a message
[1:18:22] to call her out and restore the original
[1:18:25] faith back to it back to the word let me
[1:18:29] ask you something has it truly been
[1:18:32] restored we've got the word but the word
[1:18:37] has got to be a living word and as long
[1:18:42] as we don't have the Holy Ghost to
[1:18:44] activate it it hasn't been personally
[1:18:47] restored in your life
[1:18:48] I believe the restoration is a personal
[1:18:51] thing it's not a group thing it has to
[1:18:54] be here a personal thing where it has
[1:18:58] been restored and you believe every word
[1:19:00] and you're getting results everybody's
[1:19:04] not getting resolves why I don't care if
[1:19:08] you got an iron here or electric stove
[1:19:11] or electric heater it's got everything
[1:19:13] working you got the plug and everything
[1:19:15] else but if you don't set it in there
[1:19:16] and plug it up is of no value and with
[1:19:24] all this message that you have all the
[1:19:26] words have been preached on us we ought
[1:19:28] to be ashamed because we're living in
[1:19:30] the last moment of this time and with
[1:19:32] the raptures right at our face and we
[1:19:35] are not on fire and the Bible said I
[1:19:37] would that you be hot or cold help us do
[1:19:43] help us help us but this is just what
[1:19:48] I'm going to he said and restore the
[1:19:51] original faith back to it back to the
[1:19:53] word and they won't receive it he didn't
[1:20:00] say they didn't believe it he said they
[1:20:02] won't receive it there's a difference
[1:20:04] you can believe something because Satan
[1:20:07] believes and tremble but he doesn't have
[1:20:10] anything to receive with and you've got
[1:20:15] to receive this you got to take this
[1:20:17] word and this word must become a part of
[1:20:19] you is that's what Jesus had he broke
[1:20:21] the bread and he said eat take heed
[1:20:24] he took the ride he said drink it why
[1:20:26] because he wanted that wine and that
[1:20:29] bread to be connected to you symbolic it
[1:20:33] was us being connected to him bearing
[1:20:37] his suffering burn his shame and dogmas
[1:20:42] increasing gonna get it well they didn't
[1:20:49] receive it and their dog was in creature
[1:20:53] they don't want it it's true I can
[1:20:58] preach Jesus Christ here and I tell you
[1:21:02] what you'd be surprised at the people
[1:21:04] that will receive it you know you know
[1:21:11] brother barons message was Jesus Christ
[1:21:13] it wasn't his message it was given to
[1:21:16] him am I right or wrong and that word in
[1:21:21] which he preached amen it was Jesus
[1:21:24] Christ and this is why he said the same
[1:21:26] yesterday today and forever but they
[1:21:31] won't receive it
[1:21:32] people think you let me tell you what
[1:21:35] the devil did what he has done he has
[1:21:37] given this message or people in the
[1:21:39] message of Baptist doctrine when you
[1:21:44] believe the message you got it that's a
[1:21:47] lie
[1:21:48] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[1:21:52] you believe this message
[1:21:56] hmm have you got the kinda holy ghost
[1:22:01] and somebody spit in your face you can
[1:22:05] forgive them somebody help me here
[1:22:09] because the pressure is coming you think
[1:22:12] you have an adversities now it's going
[1:22:14] to get worse but my question is can you
[1:22:17] love the person that spit in your face
[1:22:19] but you know Jesus did it they spat in
[1:22:24] his face they mocked him they stole him
[1:22:27] and while he was in his dying moments he
[1:22:30] said Father forgive them for they know
[1:22:32] not what they do
[1:22:34] that's the character that takes a
[1:22:36] rapture hey divine love is what he's
[1:22:41] looking for
[1:22:44] hmm I love it this way he says you know
[1:22:50] he said he takes something ignorant and
[1:22:53] stupid and I know sometimes people think
[1:22:55] that of me but that's okay
[1:22:57] something that don't know hardly
[1:22:59] anything not a B C's or anything and
[1:23:02] then he takes that type of a person cuz
[1:23:05] he can take something that's nothing and
[1:23:08] then work through it and as long as
[1:23:11] something think there's something then
[1:23:14] they can't do nothing with it and that's
[1:23:17] exactly what the devil has done to a lot
[1:23:20] of us we had given us the message and
[1:23:22] given us a message pride with it
[1:23:25] Pharisees of all Pharisees mmm we can't
[1:23:33] even love nobody else if they don't
[1:23:36] proclaim this message who's somebody
[1:23:39] help me here that ain't the way brother
[1:23:41] Brandon was he didn't care what brand
[1:23:44] you was he just wanted to know have you
[1:23:46] been born again help us lord help us
[1:23:57] he's done it again she won't do it her
[1:24:01] rejection away makes her all her
[1:24:04] rejection mixed up the perfect way of
[1:24:06] satan to come into her
[1:24:09] be incarnated whoo put you wet if you
[1:24:14] reject the Holy Ghost you get the unholy
[1:24:17] gold which is called Satan and just like
[1:24:22] the Holy Ghost will inject himself in
[1:24:24] you Satan will inject himself in you
[1:24:26] without the Holy Ghost you have no
[1:24:29] protection and right now we're living in
[1:24:33] the most darkest time ever is that right
[1:24:37] the darkness can be felt and that's the
[1:24:42] way it was in Egypt y'all know what I'm
[1:24:44] saying did do you know why I call it the
[1:24:46] plagues facing the plagues of Egypt
[1:24:48] because the plagues came before the
[1:24:50] Exodus
[1:24:53] he so I'm not gonna be here when that
[1:24:56] happened yes you will
[1:24:57] just like he Israel was there in Egypt
[1:25:00] amen they were there when the plagues
[1:25:03] failed every one of them but they were
[1:25:07] in a hiding place called Goshen and even
[1:25:13] at a time where it was so dark in Asia
[1:25:15] there was lighting ghosts somebody help
[1:25:20] me here see what you got to understand
[1:25:23] it may be a hard time if neither a dark
[1:25:26] time but there's lied in Goshen
[1:25:31] hallelujah I'm not stumbling around in
[1:25:33] the dark
[1:25:34] I'm not stumbling around in the dark I
[1:25:36] see which way I'm going whoo hallelujah
[1:25:42] do I fight every day I fight every day
[1:25:44] do I deny myself every day I deny myself
[1:25:47] every day do I get a hundred percent
[1:25:50] every day no but I'm still pressing
[1:25:55] hallelujah
[1:25:56] I'm pressing toward that mark of the
[1:25:58] high calling there's no giving up
[1:26:00] there's no turning round ha because I
[1:26:03] feel the pool my pool is upward surely
[1:26:08] is not that way hallelujah that's right
[1:26:14] incarnated himself in her because she
[1:26:16] rejected the word hmm now he just
[1:26:21] talking about denomination you know we
[1:26:23] don't
[1:26:24] if you believe this hey you don't have
[1:26:27] to believe it I know it's true and I
[1:26:30] don't told y'all some of my experience
[1:26:32] experiences here I went to a
[1:26:35] Jeffersonville when they had brother
[1:26:37] branham's cable put no man could have
[1:26:39] carved that cave like that and he was
[1:26:42] just man figures hanging from the
[1:26:44] ceiling right he's got a whole mountain
[1:26:48] range in his profile I don't understand
[1:26:53] even in Sabino Canyon out there amen
[1:26:57] he's there what was it this generation
[1:27:01] is without excuse God said make no
[1:27:06] graven image and yet God caused this
[1:27:09] man's image thousands of years you gotta
[1:27:14] realize this happened way before when
[1:27:20] the Indians got here it was here and you
[1:27:26] gonna come to a time in your life right
[1:27:27] now you're gonna doubt it what foolish
[1:27:29] mind or what foolish thinking that is
[1:27:32] because you're doing work it in your
[1:27:34] life don't blame it on God faith will
[1:27:37] move mountains where is your faith hmm
[1:27:43] some of us we're so small we just want
[1:27:46] God to snap at our finger guarding you
[1:27:48] don't rule him and one thing you
[1:27:50] understand no church rules God
[1:27:53] hallelujah he have might have been ruled
[1:27:56] by Jezebel though no one whose God no
[1:28:01] chart tell him what to do he's the head
[1:28:04] of it I feel like shouting but I got a
[1:28:09] preach oh my and that's exactly the same
[1:28:14] thing the president church becomes a
[1:28:16] harlot is because she rejects the
[1:28:19] vindicated truth of the world of God God
[1:28:22] don't change with fashion we don't care
[1:28:26] about liberal artwork women's living all
[1:28:29] that nonsense the trick of the devil
[1:28:36] that's what we got all these Bert's
[1:28:38] perverts now is that right brother brown
[1:28:42] said because the woman moved out of her
[1:28:44] place Jesus help us Lord that's exactly
[1:28:50] the same thing that Protestant church
[1:28:52] become a hot harlot is because she
[1:28:55] rejected the vindicated truth of the
[1:28:58] world of God and that gives the devil a
[1:29:00] place to come right in and incarnate
[1:29:03] himself what about all those people who
[1:29:07] rejected this truth you think they're
[1:29:10] still the same that's why many of them
[1:29:12] are stripping themselves going out on
[1:29:14] the beach drinking and pot many of them
[1:29:17] have become atheists because Devils have
[1:29:20] entered because they refuse the Holy
[1:29:21] Ghost message this is the Holy Ghost
[1:29:24] message hmm I preached nothing there
[1:29:28] Peter didn't preach on the day of
[1:29:30] Pentecost he said repent they said what
[1:29:33] must we do repent change your mind
[1:29:37] change your heart
[1:29:40] Satan's business is to put bitterness in
[1:29:43] your heart and unforgiveness because
[1:29:45] when he does it he know he's got you at
[1:29:48] a standstill but you gotta overcome that
[1:29:51] and don't tell God you can't do it cuz
[1:29:54] he put it in your life allowed it to
[1:29:55] happen so you can overcome so you can
[1:29:57] stand on that day set a comma
[1:30:00] how you gonna overcome something without
[1:30:02] battles how are you going to do it don't
[1:30:07] tell God he doesn't know what he's doing
[1:30:09] he knows what he's doing hallelujah what
[1:30:15] we need to do is in tune our minds into
[1:30:17] Christ right let this mind be in you
[1:30:20] that was in Christ Jesus you see what
[1:30:22] one thing about the Lord no matter what
[1:30:24] G God told him to do he did it he
[1:30:27] humbled himself and that's the problem
[1:30:30] we need to humble ourselves is that
[1:30:37] right he said he gave each of a place to
[1:30:40] repent and what was the last plague was
[1:30:43] death and that's where we are
[1:30:45] he's given us place to repent and death
[1:30:49] is the lad
[1:30:49] play that's the last plague that hit the
[1:30:52] Pentecostal church his spiritual death
[1:30:54] she's dead is that the Bible increased
[1:30:59] with good have neither nothing and I
[1:31:01] said she did and don't even know it
[1:31:03] that's in the name of the Lord
[1:31:05] she is spiritually dead he gave her
[1:31:08] space to repent and she rejected it oh I
[1:31:10] love this message you know why because
[1:31:13] those gifts always confused me and the
[1:31:17] Bible says that the gifts and calling of
[1:31:19] God was without repentance that means
[1:31:21] God gives gifts some can preach some can
[1:31:24] sing some can have a little discernment
[1:31:26] but it still don't mean they say y'all
[1:31:30] better think are for election y'all
[1:31:32] looking at like the Doomsday bombers hit
[1:31:34] you it ain't hit you it will if you
[1:31:36] don't repeat it
[1:31:37] it's coming this is your out of it event
[1:31:40] I don't know what you're going through
[1:31:42] but make it right with God even the
[1:31:46] scientists in what two seconds now two
[1:31:48] seconds to midnight the coronavirus and
[1:31:53] and and I got a quote here and I'm have
[1:31:55] to hurry up let me let me jump to that
[1:31:57] quote because time is moving and we're
[1:31:59] trying to finish it up but just to give
[1:32:04] everybody a word of encouragement those
[1:32:06] of us who know you elected maybe you
[1:32:08] haven't come to the place you want to
[1:32:09] but don't stop don't quit this is not a
[1:32:13] time to give up the finishing line is
[1:32:17] right there yes times are hard but guess
[1:32:20] what they could be harder you ever heard
[1:32:23] the word worst worse is worth it's the
[1:32:27] next level in the force field he says
[1:32:34] those with him and this is I love about
[1:32:36] it because we realized Amen that this
[1:32:40] battle is not all over it ain't over yet
[1:32:42] right it means that we got something
[1:32:47] else coming but let me start with this
[1:32:49] one so I'm a little longer than what I
[1:32:52] intended to be he said let me pass
[1:32:54] something here quickly as our time or
[1:32:57] going listen you did did you know the
[1:33:01] Bible predicts that in the
[1:33:03] last days that there that there be a
[1:33:07] germ warfare that diseases will break
[1:33:10] out upon the people and we're following
[1:33:13] everyone without the baptism of the Holy
[1:33:16] Ghost but with the angel or who has
[1:33:20] charged over these plagues was given
[1:33:22] order to touch no one on whom the mark
[1:33:25] was why how much kind of teaching have
[1:33:28] we got to be present to get the church
[1:33:31] in order to be in that condition immune
[1:33:37] and a lot of us don't even know how to
[1:33:39] fight the flu y'all hear me let me let
[1:33:46] me read you another one
[1:33:48] because I want you to understand by
[1:33:50] God's grace now now we are here it is
[1:34:01] let me read this to show you how people
[1:34:03] can be deceived
[1:34:04] how many I'll believe that William
[1:34:06] Brennan was the last messenger the last
[1:34:08] age okay let me say it like this how
[1:34:15] many of y'all know okay now here it is
[1:34:22] in closing not my closing he's saying
[1:34:25] this to those who don't believe that the
[1:34:28] last messenger to the church ages Elijah
[1:34:31] the prophet a man anointed in that line
[1:34:35] he's the last one now he says now in the
[1:34:39] fifth sealed that was the fourth seal he
[1:34:41] says now the first Elijah that was him
[1:34:44] the second Elijah was Elijah the third
[1:34:47] was John the fourth person seven angel
[1:34:50] or the messenger up to the Church of
[1:34:52] corn America for in Revelation 10 seven
[1:34:55] the fifth time he is a messenger to the
[1:34:58] Jews to the 144,000 to the Jews after
[1:35:01] the church is gone so the fourth one is
[1:35:05] the last is the Elijah to the church
[1:35:07] there ain't no eighth angel there's no
[1:35:12] great prophet that's gonna come around
[1:35:17] if it is this is wrong but you've got
[1:35:23] people who have not entered into his
[1:35:26] arrest and see that's why people run to
[1:35:28] and fro he said if he says in the desert
[1:35:31] don't you go ha ha he said if they say
[1:35:34] whatever you make don't go ha because
[1:35:37] we're the caucus is there were the
[1:35:40] Eagles be gathered and you know what
[1:35:44] people know this is true yet they go
[1:35:46] a ministry because they have not
[1:35:51] made their calling and election sure
[1:35:55] somebody helped me here
[1:35:58] that's why God did not give a man the
[1:36:02] ability to give you the Holy Ghost if
[1:36:05] you get the Holy Ghost God gives it to
[1:36:07] you I don't care if I lay hands on you
[1:36:09] all day God has to give it to you you
[1:36:12] are brought by Jesus Christ and him only
[1:36:15] you think I'm crazy but I was told that
[1:36:24] in a meeting demons was being cast out
[1:36:27] of people and then one person took the
[1:36:30] picture of William Branham and asked him
[1:36:33] the devil do you know this man what he
[1:36:37] said yes but that was going to do you
[1:36:45] Jesus I know Paul I know but who are you
[1:36:51] that person was just lucky that the
[1:36:54] devil didn't jump all over him it's all
[1:37:03] right I'm telling you the truth I'm
[1:37:06] looking for something that I can't find
[1:37:07] it but that's all right our ministry
[1:37:09] tonight so I want you to understand that
[1:37:13] I'm not just saying anything to be
[1:37:14] saying anything but the inspiration that
[1:37:18] I'm getting is coming from the word I'm
[1:37:21] a quote this one scripture now and imma
[1:37:23] let you go proverbs 27:19 and I finished
[1:37:26] tonight or completely tonight I would
[1:37:29] like to encourage everybody
[1:37:31] well you know if you can come come if
[1:37:33] you can't you can that's just the way it
[1:37:34] goes but everybody that can come come
[1:37:37] this is the last day if you really love
[1:37:41] the Lord you don't care if you getting a
[1:37:43] slice you're gonna get a slice any soup
[1:37:47] kitchen if they said all you're gonna
[1:37:49] get is a one cup I'm going cuz I'm
[1:37:51] hungry now if you ain't hungry you don't
[1:37:53] have to come proverbs 27:19 but I'm
[1:37:59] always looking for more word um you know
[1:38:02] what I don't care about let me put the
[1:38:03] way law understand what I'm saying
[1:38:05] people I love too deep things but let me
[1:38:09] tell you something when a preacher can
[1:38:11] come and show me what faults I have when
[1:38:16] he can shine the light of the gospel in
[1:38:17] my soul and show me the devil's
[1:38:20] that's-that's-that's that's hiding
[1:38:21] within me those are the kind of
[1:38:24] preachers I like that's why I so love
[1:38:27] brother Branham because you know brother
[1:38:29] Branham didn't play no jokes he went
[1:38:31] straight for the jugular that's what he
[1:38:36] did even now I could listen to his tapes
[1:38:39] and be moved by God's voice crying and
[1:38:42] repenting hallelujah but it doesn't
[1:38:45] confuse me I know God sent a fivefold
[1:38:48] ministry you love the Lord this is what
[1:38:56] he says proverbs 27:19 this is what I
[1:39:02] preached last Wednesday and I'm gonna
[1:39:04] show it to you again as in water face
[1:39:07] answers to faith and so the heart of a
[1:39:10] man to a man I meant to bring my mirror
[1:39:13] and I forgot hmm it must have not been
[1:39:15] the will of God I was gonna bring my big
[1:39:17] mirror and I was gonna show you I wanted
[1:39:19] everybody to look into it and tell me
[1:39:20] what you see
[1:39:21] right when you look at that mirror you
[1:39:23] see your face whether you like it or not
[1:39:27] you're the image in the mirror the
[1:39:30] mirror don't lie you understand me it
[1:39:35] the light of it just reflects what you
[1:39:37] are and the Bible says Amen that here it
[1:39:41] is he said he goes on to say Amen
[1:39:44] so the heart of a man to a man right in
[1:39:47] other words what's ever in your heart is
[1:39:49] what you show on the outside and people
[1:39:52] say dont you judge me I ain't judging
[1:39:54] you I'm seeing your reflection that's
[1:39:59] what it says the heart of a man so don't
[1:40:03] tell me I'm judging you if you looking
[1:40:05] all worldly it's out in your heart your
[1:40:11] heart is telling me something ain't
[1:40:13] right
[1:40:13] because the mirror of the world is
[1:40:16] supposed to reflect the mirror the
[1:40:18] reflection of Jesus Christ and if I'm
[1:40:20] looking at you and I see that you're not
[1:40:22] reflecting what Jesus Christ would be
[1:40:25] reflecting no something is wrong and no
[1:40:31] matter what you say you can't get out of
[1:40:33] it your heart is going to tell the truth
[1:40:36] oh all right I didn't read that quote I
[1:40:48] wanted to read but i'ma tell you
[1:40:49] something own artificial Christians you
[1:40:52] know how it is we say all the Lord I
[1:40:54] love you and the moment we can get a
[1:40:56] chance to do a Judit Aryan kiss we kiss
[1:40:58] the devil who you got quiet you know
[1:41:07] what do it Judit Aryan kids look it up
[1:41:09] in the message flirting with the world
[1:41:13] doing things you know you ought not to
[1:41:15] do huh
[1:41:18] and you're coming say Oh Lord I love
[1:41:20] your brother and say he don't like that
[1:41:23] God don't like you and any man that's a
[1:41:25] good man and love his wife wouldn't like
[1:41:27] that I'm just throwing that out at you
[1:41:32] it's time to us all of us to become more
[1:41:36] sincere more consecrated we need to be
[1:41:42] connected you love the Lord best and
[1:41:48] when I see the blood
[1:41:50] I pass over you
[1:41:57] you know one of these old days like
[1:42:00] brother branham said you'll appreciate
[1:42:03] what I'm telling you there's no way I'm
[1:42:06] trying to equate myself with the Prophet
[1:42:09] but one thing I know it's gonna be a lot
[1:42:12] of souls in hell because brother Branham
[1:42:14] said don't wear those high-heeled shoes
[1:42:16] that we do it anyway he tells us amen
[1:42:21] the reflection what we saw in heaven he
[1:42:24] said I saw the bride she was dressed in
[1:42:29] comet that was loose-fitting and she
[1:42:33] said she had sleeves and her dress was
[1:42:35] down to her ankle that was the
[1:42:40] reflection that means that someone up
[1:42:43] here is living that way here
[1:42:47] [Music]
[1:42:49] hallelujah even Einstein knew that you
[1:42:52] can be in two places at one time Jesus
[1:42:55] said how can the Son of Man be here on
[1:42:57] earth and be in heaven at the same time
[1:43:00] how can he say Joe where were you
[1:43:02] blessed Joe was there in here too
[1:43:07] see this is not some coincidence it's a
[1:43:11] reality he's our brother but you just
[1:43:14] being legal no I'm not all I know is
[1:43:17] that if you knew and understood your
[1:43:19] election Amen you do and try your best
[1:43:21] to reflect what you would be reflected
[1:43:24] that's why he said let thy will be done
[1:43:27] in earth as it is in heaven this ain't
[1:43:31] our home but we act like it is no I'm
[1:43:35] not I'm not saying let me just leave it
[1:43:38] the way it is
[1:43:39] but if you got the real Holy Ghost the
[1:43:41] real Holy Ghost to teach you how to
[1:43:42] dress it'll tell you when you're naked
[1:43:45] and when you're not naked it'll tell you
[1:43:47] when you're going worthy when you're not
[1:43:49] going word hallelujah a little leaven
[1:43:52] leavens the whole lump hallelujah you
[1:43:56] love the Lord what can I say

[1:47:22] I
[1:47:40] Oh
[1:47:44] the
[1:47:46] [Music]
[1:47:59] and exchange
[1:48:03] for
[1:48:11] just want to say to the saints of God
[1:48:13] this morning
[1:48:15] one thing I'm certain of I don't ever
[1:48:18] get in this pulpit without knowing that
[1:48:19] I've heard from God I don't I don't rely
[1:48:24] on anyone elses anointing
[1:48:29] what I get I get and you may not feel or
[1:48:35] even understand what I'm trying to say
[1:48:37] but I know if the seeds are planted at
[1:48:40] some point in time you're gonna
[1:48:41] understand what's being said and you
[1:48:45] will react to it
[1:48:48] but I must do as he tells me and I know
[1:48:52] my god break when it comes to the time
[1:48:56] line we don't have much time when I
[1:49:01] wiggle now because a lot of us have
[1:49:05] strongholds
[1:49:06] you know the stronghold is you in deep
[1:49:08] we don't know how to get out of it it
[1:49:11] has a grip on you but understand that
[1:49:14] God destroys stronghold the same Lord
[1:49:17] Jesus think about it
[1:49:19] a brother was say it really sick and I
[1:49:23] told I said brother God he is some
[1:49:26] perfect he put the greatest example of
[1:49:30] resurrection and restoration in that
[1:49:33] little story of Lazarus you might be
[1:49:36] sick but you ain't dead and if he was
[1:49:38] there God still Carrera and I think
[1:49:41] about stuff like that I think about
[1:49:43] what's in hospital for God if God can
[1:49:45] raise up people who have been in the
[1:49:47] grave for thousands of years raise them
[1:49:50] up clothe them in a glorified body and
[1:49:53] take him to him he can do the same for
[1:49:56] us we're just in time but when that time
[1:49:58] means we are we are eternal beings and
[1:50:02] understand that where I am now there is
[1:50:05] no sickness there is no failure there is
[1:50:07] no no no no nothing that that can relate
[1:50:11] to this everything over there is
[1:50:13] victorious there's not a bad day there's
[1:50:16] not a rainy day there's not a time of
[1:50:19] depression or anything so why should I
[1:50:21] be depressed here why should I be down
[1:50:24] here when I'm over there enjoying
[1:50:26] whatever I enjoy that's the way you got
[1:50:29] to look at it you got to look at health
[1:50:31] like I'm looking at my health too bad
[1:50:34] I'm looking at my deliverance up there
[1:50:36] I'm looking at mine
[1:50:37] everything I'm up there okay I'm
[1:50:40] perfectly her
[1:50:41] so if I'm perfectly hold there I should
[1:50:44] be perfectly whole here that's the way
[1:50:47] God wants us to look at it that's why he
[1:50:49] said set your affection on things above
[1:50:51] not on the things of the earth people
[1:50:55] set your affection on things above he
[1:50:57] told Abraham that he didn't say Abraham
[1:50:59] see all her says to seal this know sure
[1:51:02] he told me Ben look up this is not all
[1:51:05] it I've got something up here for you
[1:51:07] and inheritance up there and as it is
[1:51:11] here so shall it be there
[1:51:13] if we can just see those things and move
[1:51:16] in a give us a plane where there'll be
[1:51:19] no quitting and there'll be no turning
[1:51:21] around or looking back
[1:51:24] but befallen forward forward wouldn't it
[1:51:28] be a shame to miss a rapture because you
[1:51:33] you like something so slow I loved it
