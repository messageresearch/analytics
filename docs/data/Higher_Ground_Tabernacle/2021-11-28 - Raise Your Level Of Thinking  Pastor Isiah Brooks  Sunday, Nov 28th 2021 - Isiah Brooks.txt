we're just going to go right into the word of god so just about the jury trust everybody had a wonderful thanksgiving moment after the thanksgiving i did love you i had my family come up many of them my family my my son amen he is here i have four sons the other one had to leave to go back to colorado but i thank god for him yeah for those of you you can turn around and see him with the wonder mask amen so we love the lord and i'm so glad all of you guys are happy as you are this is your worker was it because i know it could be worse but uh we've had a good song service and so for more videos and i'm just trying to find out why everybody was whispering it's a purple collision souffle right like it was really hard to praise god but i don't care what you go through god is worthy to be praised amen and with the number of people that we have in this service directly we should take the roof off the building but uh maybe one of these old days if the lord tarry will be capable of doing that and maybe you're thinking i'm going to preach something that you want me to preach but they that are led by the spirits they are the sons of god so i'm going to preach what god has told me as we stand we're going to ask that you turn with us to hebrews the 11th chapter how many y'all want to make a rapture villa well i i know there's only one pastor here isn't it just one just like that by starting okay that's what i thought hebrews the 11th chapter and we're going to begin reading at the sixth verse of that chapter but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him why could you exist by faith nor being warned of god of things that things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith by faith abraham when he was called to go out into the place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing where he went by faith his sojourn in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs with him of the same promise vancitable for he looked for a city which have foundations who builder and maker is god man through faith also sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised let's read this last one here it is only down you see therefore spraying there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky in in multitude and as this saying which is by the seashore innumerable. in posterity these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and was persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth sedona small one more scripture and then i'll let you be seated ephesians 2. ephesians the second chapter you love the lord amen amen god is good to us we must always remember amen he is the head of all our lives for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god had before ordained that we should walk in them jesus christ let us pray our gracious father god we come before you lord shall progress jesus as humble as we know how and we thank you for being so good to us we thank you for the amazing grace you have given unto us and we pray father god that your perfect will be done in our lives lord we're now here to do your will amen amen you may be seated we preached a message similar to this before but i i'd like to uh kind of approach it in a different way we talked about raising your level of thinking [Music] that's where we are see and let me say it like this you see only those who really search and truly have a revelation of the grace of god de la [Music] what this message have done for us has given us a higher level of grace as the word of god says we've never gone this way before and hopefully this morning you better understand where i'm going with this thought and men always think according to their flesh and that's not what god has called us to do he's literally called us to a higher calling in this calling we must recognize that god is in full control of my life and of yours and you and i must understand that whatever we are is what we are say in other words as you heard me say on it quickens apple tree please set up please if it's an apple tree you and i must understand that that apple tree is going to bring forth apples and if if it's whatever it may be if grandpa's gonna it will never switch its nature it's going to only produce the nature that's in it hallelujah amen now remember amen brother branham talked about mr lily uh the lily had to come through a lot of mud and i felt the least it had had to come through a lot of uh dirty water it had to press through hard times it pressed through but the mud could never change what the lily was from the dirty water could never change what the lily was lost in the profession it was born a lily it had to deliver amen was to be crushed [Applause] your now god don't care about nobody's tradition i want you to know that i don't care about god's word is always right right now you and i must understand that if we are to be bride listen i'm gonna jump back to this last quote i want to read go ahead on uh if we're going to be brides you must understand what makes us bride and and if you want to uh look it up brother branham talks about it in uh trying to do god of service in 1965 he said did you know that he promised it how he would do it now how did god truly choose christ jewish was it increased he didn't go to a grocery store nepalese he didn't go to another planet now how did did excuse me how did he bring christ here how did god bring christ here come on christ by the word of the prophets that's your truth is that right how will he bring his bride here by the word of the prophet hallelujah that's why you can't even read this message because if you read it in a kind of way you'll bring forth the law of grace hallelujah how did he identify come on is it him when he comes by a man with the spirit of elijah upon him come out of the wilderness who now i'm gonna tell y'all something that y'all think y'all know should we do hallelujah it tries everything about you so you understand today today you either stand as a true believer yes sir now god is working on you now you're going to tell him how to do it are you going to tell him how to do it god works on you and let me say it like this by the grace of god however you perceive the word that's why i try i know i know that people who say they understand this message they really don't because they are understanding that it intellectually that that's what made the message or made the world or made the people barren hallelujah you understand me and i want to say this by god's grace so that you can understand it doesn't matter what you call yourself if you don't produce jesus christ somebody help me here i'm gonna say it again it does not matter how long you profess to be a christian you could have gone a long time but until you produce the promised c bring forth the word you know just at the time when you say i confess the lord jesus christ this is my savior but i understand quickening my company brings life apart you understand me quickening brings life now you and i must understand even the prophet even when it comes to uh uh uh abraham and sarah abraham and sarah sarah was barren was she a believer was she a believer was she a believer let me say it like this just one of your questions if you're still drinking if you want to deal with smoking if you still remember rousing around whatever you do and you're not expressing jesus christ jesus you're still barren you understand me must i give myself amen amen must i give myself amen i mean understand by god's grace completely this this is the judgment seat that's it and god made me the pastor he drafted the woman i'ma say it again god made is not right and it's not only you need to repent because otherwise god would not be grieved in this service boy we had a time down there in iowa the holy spirit really came down hallelujah now the bible tells us to let this mind be in you which he also was in christ jesus said let's pick you down it is so funny how people can sin but they're saying it's not sin right we can come 30 to 40 minutes late but that's not sin but you say you believe all of the message come here half hour early i'm definitely yeah you don't but that's not saying to you mr so you see his fingers are pointed fingers can also which was also in christ jesus christ who being in the form of god thought is not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation hallelujah and took upon him the form of a servant that formed themselves and was made in the likeness of man you're there philippians uh okay two and eight now and being found in fashion you see as a man he humbled himself he said he became obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore in how do you know brother brooks let me tell you something about the bride of jesus christ always amen the word am i shopping i am chopping i haven't even got to where i'm going yet but you know what what let me tell you something about me i refuse to be a system of systems i could care less about what you think so that you understand i have a true revelation of who i am where i came from and where i'm going now the attitude that some of y'all brought in here this morning it's not right it could be just one person i don't know but i watch you when i'm seeing this atmosphere from behind and i'm thinking what is going on here did any of you die for uh anybody anybody just kidding who who went to calvary every one of us every one of us every now you have not seen me angry but i'm going there but it's a righteous indignation tell me i'm wrong i didn't want to shoot 24. none of your business it's about concern and you have the mind of christ i apologize to those who came to hear something different something but but let me say it like this you see i am led by god jesus and this is the message he gave me now however you respond to it you need to drop whatever you came in here within your mind with the village and you need to pay attention to what god is trying to tell you if the villain other than what's being preached you need to whatever we're talking about making a rapture there is only a certain kind of character in that concern or characteristics that will be translated so you've got to be careful how you watch see things the person in this hour hallelujah let's move on and being found i'm glad i'm glad oh my god i'm so glad that you guys are not my savior where would i be and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross eighth verse eight okay he said to me the remembering god also harley exalted him and giving him a name which is above everything julian of things in heaven and things [Applause] everything there is a challenge a challenge that you and i are getting ready to face you think or defeat this stuff that we're going through now is difficult the army people that walk on feet on their feet oh the the the sodeki masters yeah so you and i must understand these things convex you this is sure get you into a place where you can't worship god our emotions hallelujah that's what the holy ghost is for your emotions in check hallelujah you love the lord about these mediums the mediums witches oh this the saucy that had a chair and had an audience and these mediums or witches got to the place where they were literally deceiving those who were christians and so when the witch saw brother branham she said unto him you claim to be a christian oh man of god and it stayed right there now this is god's provided place of worship in 1965 and he said i i commanded that table to fall down in the name of the father son in the holy ghost and he stayed right there and i said i command that table to fall down he said hallelujah in the name of jesus christ i know this is requested and it like to broke all four of the legs off hitting the floor what and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth hallelujah if you are struggling reading your messages to your messages if you're struggling uh reading your bible hallelujah i wonder what kind of experience you have experienced it's a religion your religion won't get you there and because you say i know god sent a prophet that's not going to get you there not only you not only must you be born again but now i'm preaching because i care about i refuse refuse to see this church become organized diversity in your organization where you think you're something that you're not every time i see something that god can show me i'm going to preach on it why because we need to understand the enemy that we're not facing can never be taken for granted hallelujah and if you don't have the holy ghost he is will he will deceive you oh my people you got to understand what i'm talking about jesus holy demon that the name of the father he put his name in jesus christ in him he needs to worship in him he meets that jesus said also the word name jesus means jesus jehovah's savior jew vasil jehovah the savior hallelujah what is it is it the reason why we don't get get it you say well oh i i know i got it no you your attitude and the way you behave tells me [Music] and you have heat quick and that's the scripture quicker means you were dead quicker she does not have the living god living in and through her viva just one scripture you know it's true there's jesus there's no position how many times should i forgive my brother and he has said seven times seven is that the seven in a day for sit for le jour how many of us are capable of doing that understand that's the word and the bride of jesus christ is supposed to be the word hallelujah you understand me let me move on i'm throwing some things out so now when we talk about uh going to a higher level of thinking he doesn't leave you in the same frame of mind even less partner remember you in give it that you once thought was impossible um and all of this comes by the grace of god when like i said you say well well i don't believe that well let me just say this you see as long as israel was under the law israelites they could never produce the messiah you know why because it was the law of god it was the law that uh uh uh uh how can i say it was the law that didn't it was the law that magnified israel's sick condition condition as long as adam and eve was under the word and they did everything that god wanted them to do they had only waited jesus hallelujah and for thousands of years did reign and it rained by way of the law because the law calls death hallelujah let me show you it's a month how it was so bad in israel israel by law that god was always just just in that one place that god was just there under the the mercy seat and you know that's where he stayed and see like if i wasn't near the mercy seat i can sin and do what i want to do but they didn't understand that was just god's provided place of uh to meet them but you can't you can't get rid of god he knows your actions he knows your heart hallelujah not one person will be able to go before god personally and defend his case hallelujah when god is giving you grace what do you mean by that because god said be fruitful and multiply this he said it and that's what he meant is that jesus you understand me so and how can we produce children as a church we're barren see we have allowed the law to keep us from the grace of god i'm gonna because i want you to understand god waited for the company and he chose a man by the name of abraham he chose a name by a woman by the name of sarah is that right and sarah was barren but she was a christian hallelujah y'all understand me now she it wasn't her sin per se but we understand she did disbelieve me hallelujah she didn't see where it was possible for her to bring forth a child in her old age i don't know foreign we can't help it some women can't help it the fundamental right just like some men can't help being impotent but we know that because the issues were caused by sin that's good that's just not necessarily your sometimes it goes on like that they do force ourselves but you must understand all the promises in the world no matter what the devil says the bible says if you ask god and believe that it shall be done given to you amen hallelujah you must stand on the word if god is in you that means god is expecting you to stand on every test to overcome every battle to claim victory every day this is what god wants you to do this good job um hallelujah now we must understand um god gave sarah strength somehow he quickened it [Music] god promised abraham god promised me and god said i am coming again abraham and i'm going to visit you now understand when he came to visit abraham he didn't come to the masculine he came to sarah which was a type of the bride of jesus christ and now god is coming to you now if you can see it you can understand victim it'll quicken in you see that you are to be the sarah of this day jesus oh come on somebody you ought to be the one that god wants to bring forth a child no matter amen hallelujah being bride is saying like mary said be it unto me let's give him something according to thy word can you imagine we imagine all of the traditional things traditionally that jesus broke because you have a breezy by doing the will of the father he allowed mary and marie to wash his feet an unclean woman from empire hallelujah can you imagine what the pharisees and the sadducees were thinking uh even at simon's house he thought within himself how can this be a man of god and he let this kind of woman this is jealous wash his feet hallelujah but you see you can look from the outside i can look from the outside i can judge from intellect people intellectual people listen to each other think about all of the people that's left the message think about it right why they weren't quickened they walked like they were they talked like they weren't they worshiped like they were and yet they were not where do you stand what's good with your name that's just intellectual i'm reading what brother said if when the book is opened to you it looks good it's supposed to be jesus christ this was just y'all understand me what made brother branham malachi was the life that was was lived through him the prophecies that came forth the healings the deliverance all of those things declared [Music] the greatest vindication like is an unmistakable awakening i know some don't even know what i'm talking about i'm not i'm not a deep preacher but i'm trying to tell you something she said and i hope you're spiritual enough this morning to understand what i'm trying to say one thing i won't be you won't i won't stand before god and and god accused me for not telling you you know why i i know what everybody does she says when i was when i was in in lima ohio ohio i started off with 13 people and before i left we had over 2500 and and one thing i've always depended upon uh god coming to my rescue and he has always done that now my my thing is this maker even there i saw god just change people that's what i keep it took away that sour look let me see it took it took away the traditions the tradition you know i i you know there was a time in my life i thought everybody had to shout i thought everybody had to scream on the victim i thought everybody had to do that kind of pentecostal thing dude that was legalism hallelujah but one thing i do know ensures everybody should say amen [Music] is that right he said it's like saying sycam [Music] when you when you when you tell a dog to sick him look it right it stirs him up it puts him in a place where he's ready and so we must understand amen when it comes whether you like it uh whether you amen is amen amen okay let's move on yeah it changes you and you say oh well i've been this way all my life let me tell you something you don't even have to be a christian be to be moral but because you moral basketball you say san jose amen every person persona that knows who have had had this experience he knows exactly what i'm talking about six like the most of those pounder and testify of the exact same thing when this message had been quickened to you hallelujah the bible becomes a new book hallelujah yes sir and they are not stuck in their precious in this empire life in the church don't say people that's why they don't this is more than a building collection or being collected in a building that's not even what the church is hallelujah amen but often times may default we think this is it aren't you miserable to it if out of this awesome message see on the other side you're miserable [Music] and it's true you say right there are people who are still who've been in the message for years and you still have a temporal problem you will be on your let's go to ephesians two i don't know two through three i admit the messages take taking a different turn but that that's okay i'm gonna i'm gonna preach it just like you want where in time past second verse ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience the third verse among whom also we all had our conversations in time past in the lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and whereby and were by nature the children of wrath even as others come amen when it comes to our lives as christians we must understand that we are being trained you develop in something for me right now meant to know because one of these old days god will use us as judges [Music] hallelujah and so therefore we must understand that we must always have the mind of christ not so much but i see you know like the scripture says communication fulfilling the lust of the desires of the flesh are complicitly volunteered that's what the pharisees did that's what they did excuse me and they always judged everybody in a way that made them look superior and if we're not careful we will fall in the same situation because it's not me that's not me but i want you to know that is you measure and don't feel the pain in the past until when somebody steps on your toe or slaps your face you don't feel the pain oh y'all got so quiet the bible says listen he quickens you he changed you from death into life takes away the barrenness and bring christ in your life you don't live that's the reality christ doesn't make you silly it makes you peculiar it makes you a special people it makes you a chosen people it if jesus can do it i can't tell you jesus the things that cause his spiritual bearingness it is it is an illness and sometimes uh it causes barrenness uh and also impotence hallelujah and regarding the word of god and the righteousness of the word have you ever thought let me throw this up how the church was on fire for god come on they were producing jesus christ all the time until 80th uh until until the niacial council then the niacille council began to add to the word uh bring in laws and rules and regulations became relationship with the savior himself remember amen and until you get there are you still in layers we are so close to the coming of the lord y'all know what i mean listen it's going to be an individual affair right now is that right brother branham said it like this and i'm paraphrasing i want did you come to this but he said one of these old days jesus will materialize himself jesus in front of you right not in front of y'all you all know in front of you and those of us who are walking in the light it's being led by the holy ghost and we're allowing god and that's what a lot of people do you screen the messages from here and if it doesn't come through what you've learned is this a lot of what you feel thank you blurry i bought scoops of videos see that's what people don't understand and then you make it difficult for the preacher to fit because you you always go back to that first husband that is you need god to do something for you regarding the word of god and the righteousness of the word no matter what good christian we were denominational message we're not saying you know like you know speaking in tongues and shouting and dancing that's not we're beyond that good but we're beyond that we're living in the age of life not hallelujah now it ain't enough for you to wear a shirt with jesus sage i said that doesn't make you alive but it doesn't make your and that's when they were called christians they didn't have to run around and say i'm a christian no it was the life that they lived they were just signs that followed them it was the power of god that was in them jesus even said it is jesus he said you will not they will know that you are my disciples because of the love that you have one for another hallelujah amen this is a day of unity that's illuminati separation but we we do it and we claim we got an experience of one experience no no brother branham loved every denomination in the denomination he never showed a respect a person and here we are in the message if you're not born rich enough i can't handle you if your language is not like mine i've got a problem with you if you don't i'm gonna say it if you don't speak french correctly there's little things like that you think doesn't matter that's a petition amen that's why it's so hard on brother frank well because if you interpret for me because he knows every one of y'all watching every word not to understand what i'm saying but just to see how well his french oh yeah is true you know what i was learning french and i was learning french by by the the app uniform in order for my french to be accepted pokemon [Music] you know it is what it is she said you see but i'm trying to tell those people it doesn't matter important the early church primitive they were some poor in some wretch you know they saw all they had so it's bringing everything into a common place now i'm you understand what i'm saying that's not the inspiration right now inspiration but listen there should not be one person in this church and you know the need and don't help them even amen and when i say it like that i don't mean you need to help them so that you can look good hallelujah when you do things in the uh under the uh uh anointing of god you do it as unto the lord and nobody else need to know what you've done a person who does have oscars of your face i'm almost done i'm almost done with this but but i'm trying to bring bring some thoughts just just give me a few more minutes it didn't want to communicate you know what what happened to sarah there was nothing sarah could have done to make her have this child bibi didn't happen you know to say okay i'm not going to have any children but she always wanted them but if we leave this on phone you'll hear what i'm saying and as long as there's a deep call to the deep there's always a win will respond in his own time amen god will change you you can't go by what the doctors say god will change you amen but god always work in his own time he has his own way of doing things and we can't make him does it the way he wants to do it y'all understand what i'm saying how many you've ever wanted to be delivered from something you cry out to the lord and you ask god to deliver you well god can't deliver you until you believe you can be delivered [Music] hallelujah amen is that right right how many times committed brother branham said the doctor said this sister that is paralyzed will never walk again hallelujah but she heard the word and that word was quickened you know when it's quicken it becomes personal that's me that's for me when that happens has y'all hear what i'm saying all of the things that you have in your life that is wrong and you know they came by way of sin give no one you have a right as long as you write his words [Applause] how many days i lay in the grave [Music] god has to he cannot deny his word hallelujah he has to it is dua oh lord have mercy but it calls for patience patience and saul uh you know saul got in his in in the flesh of his mind please god people by doing what he thought was right to do officials keep on succeeding hallelujah and you know what uh sam you're saying you have done scripture it's disobedience hallelujah and he likened that deed [Music] let me ask you a question how many of you can truly make yourself ready what does that really mean when the bride makes yourself ready you know what it really means submitting yourself to the word because the word is the only one that can make you ready trying to do god service you see he said if the bride is to be the word it is then she's got to be of christ part of the bridegroom she's got to be the word the word not for his day that he sent his word forth to the world of his bride and made her right and made her yeah in other words he sent his what what what does he do he's come to mold and make her that means she wasn't in her right shape and you grow into the grace and the knowledge of jesus christ you understand the you think like god you you walk like god you talk don't get somebody don't get some idea of your own now you need the remember and don't take somebody else's idea take the vindicated word here for the bible it says god has promised in his word how he would choose his bride for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus which god could you have before ordained a preparedness and that path is y'all saying now i i'm closing on this drift in order for us to obtain heaven we must understand what real grace is and you can't have like brother branham says no love no grace no grace no love by the move and we ourselves have come in such a sick generation where everything goes and you and i must understand it in order to judge a situation any situation [Music] that you would want to be judged i'm saying that even in the bigger things or the smaller things we look at people's failures we think oh my you know well that's this is not that's not something new the world has always judged themselves and others that way this is why you got you got the upper class and the lower class class the world's going back to that they're getting rid of the middle class so you got to understand the way men think that's the way they think you need to stop thinking like man once we and at the end of the day make sure that we all walk in in his spirit i really don't know but one thing i know is that whatever i feed you i will have to give an account for it i know that every word that i preach is is being recorded even my heart what i'm thinking is being recorded even as i speak and this is why i must say i feel god jason far more than i fear any man you understand me so you can understand that maybe you don't understand what i'm saying but i i believe if you ask god he'll tell you we came in here with carnal minds something that's the only thing that i know that really grieves god see when the atmosphere is not set and don't tell me what it is some of you couldn't even praise god songs don't talk about stuff you had no business talking about say about it and you have imprisoned yourself and you think you're going to place that judgment in my spirit you're not going to do that with anybody i'm not going to allow you to do it both coming through the film i don't pay nobody to come to church here i think everybody comes because you will too do you understand what i'm saying either i'm your is or i'm not and if i am then you need to respect the word right all those brothers who are ahead of our houses we want our wives to respect you respect the church of the church i don't push that doctrine so i just thank god for his grace thank god for his mercy by god's grace something was said you know this message would have went totally different i think but you see the atmosphere has all need to be right at all times i've been told many times you might did before by those who were in jeffersonville when brother branham was alive atmosphere that was in the church before he even got there and the holy ghost didn't disappear because brother branham went to sleep and to be honest with you he's supposed to be in a greater way i pray and i'm going to continue to pray that god will open our understanding to what it really means the only thing i get jealous about the essentials when it comes to brother branham is that the love he had for jesus christ of christ lord let me love him love you the way he loves you the way he spoke things the way he is you can feel the love that he had for jesus and i said lord give me jesus you promised me a double portion of that anointing the message denominational standpoint don't point to them you never have seen it [Music] you haven't seen it and so many of us we've been born into a system and we didn't even know it and we wondered why people act the way they do i was supposed to give some people because they have been they have been married to a system thinking it was jesus christ what we've done is no different than what organizations have done but if you're on the scriptures against the same faith it's the truth and you know what we do we make every we want everybody to look alike saying the same thing no matter what color people is like when the holy ghost comes to the sentence they act the same way that's right amen act the same way that's what i'll be looking for i'm looking for the way the holy ghost act is [Music] it may sound a little rough but i'm really trying to help as you say did he the lord is appearing we see signs everywhere but brother branham said he can basically count on his on one hand that's going to make a rapture he said you need to say i'm one of them or that's me this is not a time to rest the worst thing you could do is be at ease in zion and you say well when i see this happening that happens then i he's talking about christ in you god in you and god in you knows how to control his tongue knows how to control his actions the god in you the bible said love thinketh no evil the love of god does not puff up itself the god in you does not behave itself unseemly no sir the god in you it's a god of humility the god of you in you that's the kind of spirits we have some of them here no no this is not where we fight in other words our enemy is not our family not for me our enemy is satan we wrestle not against flesh and blood spiritual wickedness in high places see if you don't understand what i'm saying a simple complaint about scriptures you're going to always have things going on in your family that's going to always keep you in a low place you understand what i'm saying the more that i surrender the lighter my lord [Music] the more that i release my cast the more you take control the more that i can humble myself the more you lift me up and every day i live lord i love you more the more that i surrender the more that i surrender the light [Music] the more that i release my cares the more you take control [Music] the more that i surrender my lord the more you take control more you lift me up and every day [Music] oh if there be anybody that is our prayer we'll be willing to pray for you
