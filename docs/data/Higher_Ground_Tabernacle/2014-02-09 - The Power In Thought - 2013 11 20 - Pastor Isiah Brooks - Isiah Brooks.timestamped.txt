[0:00] hey God is good to us
[0:03] amen we love the
[0:06] Lord we taught on something last night
[0:10] uh and I told you last night we was
[0:12] going to try to go ahead and continue on
[0:14] the thought to me it's a powerful
[0:16] thought if we could all catch the
[0:18] Revelation and understand what God is
[0:20] trying to get us to do I believe uh
[0:23] we'll be uh soon setting in Heavenly
[0:26] places in Christ Jesus
[0:30] let us turn uh to Philippians
[0:33] 2 and
[0:35] five from there we'll go to
[0:40] Philippians
[0:42] 1:27 and then
[0:45] Philippians 3 and 20 Philippians 2
[0:51] and5 it reads let this mind be in
[0:55] you which was also in Christ Jesus amen
[1:00] who being in the form of God thought it
[1:03] not robbery to be equal with God may but
[1:08] made himself of no
[1:10] reputation and took upon him the form of
[1:13] a servant and was made in the likeness
[1:17] of
[1:17] men being found in fashion as a man he
[1:22] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[1:26] death even the death of the the cross
[1:31] Philippians 1 and
[1:35] 27 we read down to the 29th verse only
[1:40] let your conversation be as it becometh
[1:42] the gospel of Christ amen that whether I
[1:45] come and see you or else be absent I may
[1:49] hear of your Affairs that ye stand fast
[1:52] in one spirit with one mind striving
[1:56] together for the faith of the gospel and
[1:59] in nothing terrified by your adversaries
[2:02] in nothing now terrified by your
[2:06] adversaries which is to them an evident
[2:09] token of predition but to you of
[2:12] Salvation and that of God for unto you
[2:16] it is given in the in the behalf of
[2:19] Christ not only to believe on him but
[2:22] also to suffer
[2:25] for his
[2:27] sake amen praise the Lord let's go to
[2:30] Philippians 3
[2:32] now Philippians 3:20 and then we'll read
[2:36] portions of Proverbs
[2:38] 237 Philippians 3 and
[2:43] 20 and it reads for our conversation is
[2:47] in heaven amen from which also we look
[2:51] for the Savior the Lord Jesus Christ who
[2:55] shall change our vow bodyall that it may
[2:59] be fashioned like unto his glorious body
[3:02] according to the working whereby he is
[3:05] able even to subdue all things under
[3:11] himself one more scripture Proverbs 23
[3:14] and7 and we'll just read that portion
[3:17] that uh is pertaining to the word that
[3:19] I'll be ministering tonight Proverbs 23
[3:27] and7 and it reads
[3:30] for as he thinketh in his
[3:33] heart so is he let us pray father God we
[3:39] come before you Lord as humbly as we
[3:41] know how we thank you for allowing uh
[3:45] the saints of God to be here tonight you
[3:47] say where two or three are gathered in
[3:49] your name there you are in the midst so
[3:52] we welcome you here this evening we
[3:54] thank you for your love divine uh that
[3:58] passes all understanding we thank you
[4:01] Father God for your grace your mercy and
[4:04] your love in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[4:07] amen you may be
[4:10] seated first of all I I just want to
[4:13] kind of uh give thought on what I'll be
[4:16] the Lord is bringing
[4:18] tonight the Ser uh the the the subject
[4:21] of the matter would be the power in
[4:24] thought the power in
[4:27] thought first of all I I want to say
[4:30] this so that you and I can
[4:33] understand that salvation didn't come to
[4:36] you when you recognized it it always
[4:42] was we're dealing with a Divine
[4:45] love God is love God doesn't change it
[4:49] he cannot change it it is the essence of
[4:51] his being and what God
[4:55] thought in the beginning he can't change
[4:57] it amen cuz he's perfect in his
[5:01] thoughts one of the most powerful
[5:03] scriptures there is in the Bible is the
[5:06] one that says for God so loved the world
[5:11] that he gave his only begotten son that
[5:15] whosoever believeth in him shall not
[5:17] perish but have everlasting life amen
[5:21] understand that thought was always with
[5:25] God John picked it up and he spoke the
[5:29] thought of God that thought that word
[5:33] can never change it is what it is and so
[5:38] when we understand that I was talking to
[5:40] a brother today and I said brother uh
[5:45] that is
[5:46] salvation once you see that your peace
[5:50] come by way of the work that he has
[5:54] already done it is not what you do it is
[5:59] what what he has already done that is
[6:03] salvation am and we are accepted in the
[6:07] Beloved that's why brother brandham
[6:09] always talked with the Christian and he
[6:12] tried to keep them
[6:14] encouraged and he talks to them you know
[6:17] like why aren't you believing it and
[6:19] what's wrong with your faith and you
[6:21] know you're living Beneath Your
[6:22] Privilege he never said they were not
[6:25] Christians but he showed them that they
[6:28] were not receiving
[6:30] all of their benefits and that's what
[6:33] that's what psalmist says let us not
[6:35] forget all of your benefits see because
[6:40] you did not come to God it was God
[6:44] thought about you that Drew you to him
[6:48] amen thank you Lord hello somebody I'll
[6:51] say it
[6:53] again God came to you you didn't look
[6:56] for God even as the prophet of God said
[6:59] you know and he took it back to Adam and
[7:01] Eve they didn't look for God Fallen men
[7:04] do not look for God Amen it is God who
[7:07] look for them why because they are his
[7:10] attributes amen and God promised he will
[7:14] not lose one amen the power of thought
[7:19] you know I I wanted to know what thought
[7:22] is and you know it that's a difficult
[7:24] thing to Define and you know uh cuz it's
[7:29] a it's a it's a spiritual thing it's not
[7:33] something that you do in your brain it's
[7:35] a spiritual thing that takes place like
[7:39] I was saying last night how many times
[7:43] we have spoken things not even realizing
[7:46] that we thought it amen out of the mouth
[7:49] it comes and the Bible said out of the
[7:52] abundance of the heart the mouth
[7:54] speaketh so there was a process of some
[7:58] kind going on in your mind or in your
[8:02] thought machine that you didn't even
[8:05] know about but your mouth spoke it amen
[8:08] right it went from your head to your
[8:11] heart and out of your heart came what
[8:12] was thought so we realize God is is um
[8:18] concerned I'll put it this way let's put
[8:20] it this way God um will judge us
[8:24] according to all of the idle words
[8:28] spoken right because understand you and
[8:32] I as little creators when we speak
[8:34] things we put things into motion amen
[8:37] and believe you me words that we speak
[8:41] can hinder it can never stop the word of
[8:44] God but it can hinder what God intend to
[8:48] do
[8:49] amen right think about it when Elijah
[8:53] call down fire from heaven and when
[8:56] Elijah amen told uh call told those
[8:59] Bears to eat those children and when
[9:02] Moses spoke that struck that rock come
[9:05] on it changed the order of God that's
[9:09] what the prophet of God said he said
[9:11] that Moses was not supposed to strike
[9:13] that rock but his
[9:16] thoughts was contrary to what God's
[9:19] thoughts were and he implemented his own
[9:23] thoughts and he cursed amen come on and
[9:28] he said you are
[9:30] what was he doing he was literally
[9:32] trying to put a curse now he didn't mean
[9:34] to do it out of anger he spoke it and it
[9:38] caused him not to
[9:41] walk in the promised land now he saw it
[9:45] God was gracious enough to let him see
[9:47] it but he wasn't able to place his feet
[9:50] there amen because he allowed his
[9:54] thoughts to interfere with what God's
[9:58] thought and his intent was even the
[10:00] prophet of God
[10:02] says that's why it was Christ was
[10:05] smitten
[10:06] again in this age because of what Moses
[10:10] did he was only supposed to be smitten
[10:13] once and that was at calary but there
[10:16] was a second
[10:18] crucifixion because of what Moses
[10:21] did see action reaction now when we look
[10:26] about thought I want you to understand
[10:28] you know this is a dictionary and it
[10:31] says the act of
[10:33] process of thinking or the power of
[10:38] reasoning and
[10:40] judging it is also considered the power
[10:43] of
[10:44] imagination something as an idea formed
[10:48] in the
[10:50] mind thoughtfulness and I thought about
[10:52] thoughtfulness it means to be full of
[10:54] thought or concern about someone now
[10:58] when we talk about the Bible says as a
[11:02] man thinketh in his heart and brother
[11:05] bam said for years theologians and and
[11:08] Skeptics argued the point and said that
[11:12] that was wrong because a man doesn't
[11:14] think in his heart but he thinks in his
[11:17] head well in in in the 60s or wherever
[11:20] what time it was we found out that
[11:22] science found out that there's a little
[11:25] compartment that has no blood vessels in
[11:27] the heart and he said and they
[11:30] acknowledge that is the place where he
[11:32] thinks Hallelujah
[11:36] now the thing that God looks at the most
[11:40] is not what you think in your head it's
[11:43] what you think in your heart the head is
[11:47] the Battleground amen of
[11:50] thoughts as I wrote down today I said if
[11:54] one never would uh one never would do
[11:58] evil if one would block all of Satan's
[12:05] thoughts amen it is Satan
[12:08] thoughts that literally influences us
[12:13] and causes us to go
[12:16] contrary to the thoughts of God Amen
[12:20] that's why I read Eep uh Philippians 2
[12:22] and 5 let this mind be in you amen right
[12:28] not m in your head but mind in your
[12:32] heart amen because this heart that God
[12:35] has designed has for us has also been
[12:38] designed as a
[12:40] throne where God becomes the head amen
[12:45] and you know the thing about it is when
[12:48] you look at it you that's why it's
[12:50] important that you die to your thoughts
[12:53] amen and let the thoughts coming from
[12:55] the heart rain Amen in no more the
[13:00] body now I thought about this because
[13:04] remember it was the thought it was the
[13:07] head that Satan aimed at when it came to
[13:12] Eve he made her
[13:15] reason he separated her thoughts from
[13:19] God's thoughts amen by adding one word
[13:22] you shall not die and she reasoned with
[13:26] it because he made her feel she had a
[13:31] right to have her own
[13:34] thoughts see and that's what the devil
[13:36] does he tried to make us feel like we
[13:39] have a
[13:40] right to our own thoughts but the Bible
[13:44] tells us that you've been bought with a
[13:46] price amen and you're not your own and
[13:50] when you and I surrender to God we're
[13:53] literally surrendering our body our soul
[13:56] our spirit and everything that's contain
[13:59] within amen even your
[14:02] thoughts God will not allow you to
[14:05] function or put it this way God will not
[14:09] allow you to live by your own thoughts
[14:13] and get away with it amen let's read and
[14:16] this is a powerful scripture it might uh
[14:18] shake you up a little bit but let's read
[14:20] uh uh I think it's Psalms 50 where where
[14:23] I want to
[14:24] go Psalms 50
[14:29] see the power of thoughts and uh I think
[14:32] it was brother Randy we were talking
[14:34] with somewhere in the course of a few
[14:37] weeks ago or so and he mentioned thought
[14:39] and and I never thought I was going to
[14:41] preach on it but he talked about the
[14:43] speed of thought and I I thought wow
[14:47] that's that's wonderful because that
[14:49] after he mentioned that I started
[14:50] thinking you know
[14:55] Rapture and they said that thought uh
[14:58] you you know is like 350 millisecond
[15:01] that's just for you to figure out what
[15:03] you're looking at but to comprehend it
[15:06] it takes about 400 to something
[15:10] milliseconds now I don't know how fast
[15:12] that is I can't imagine it but we're
[15:15] going to read something here tonight
[15:17] where brother said Heaven may be a
[15:19] billions of billions of miles away but
[15:20] he said when you die it's just a
[15:21] moment's time and you're there now how
[15:24] fast can you travel bro and me you know
[15:26] I just want you to realize amen that
[15:29] scientists are beginning to see that the
[15:32] mind is far
[15:34] stronger than what we imagine it to be
[15:39] now they say that we as men we only
[15:41] think think on one side of the brain and
[15:43] you know I always say that's why women
[15:45] think they're smarter because they use
[15:46] both
[15:47] sides but we know by the grace of God
[15:50] and they are I mean for for for some
[15:52] reason you put a man when it comes to
[15:55] the knowledge and things like that they
[15:57] supersede right because That's what
[15:59] Satan promised
[16:01] them he promised them that that they
[16:03] would be gods in order to be Gods you
[16:06] must Excel and be above all it is what
[16:10] it is so anyway by the grace of God um
[16:13] when we look and we see how powerful the
[16:16] mind is and I go back to that that
[16:18] hospital room I I I wish I'd have
[16:20] brought that quote where brother
[16:21] brandham he was working with that young
[16:23] girl who was sick and he brother Brandon
[16:25] was saying asking her she had Faith she
[16:27] saides I do he said' no you don't'
[16:29] and then he looked at that that light
[16:31] fixture whatever it was and he began to
[16:33] cause it to move back and forth back and
[16:35] forth and and she said you know who did
[16:38] who did it did did you do it or God how
[16:41] she brother did God did it
[16:44] or Lord Jesus did it yeah or the devil
[16:47] that's what that's right and then he
[16:48] says no I did
[16:51] it and you and I must understand so if
[16:54] that be the case it is a law it is a law
[16:58] and the prophet of God that revelation
[17:00] of that law was revealed to him and he
[17:02] was operating it now he's not the only
[17:05] one you don't even have to be Sav to
[17:07] operate it amen because the Hindus and
[17:10] and all of them they can take knives and
[17:12] stick it down their throat and don't you
[17:13] try it and you know what I mean and
[17:16] through you and walk on Co of fire no
[17:18] burn no scar no blood no
[17:20] nothing hook their faces and I no pain
[17:24] but what it ain't mine over matter is
[17:27] Faith amen
[17:30] it's faith I don't care M over a matter
[17:32] my mind could never get over that matter
[17:34] it takes Faith Amen to operate that
[17:38] right now I don't know how true this is
[17:40] and please it's not in the message
[17:43] anywhere but I forgot what brother it
[17:45] was he told me he was hunting with
[17:46] brother Brandon one time and there was a
[17:49] young man that was on on on uh uh in
[17:52] with them camping and said brother
[17:55] brandham said something and the brother
[17:57] got upset and he was the one cooking and
[18:00] he had little grease in the frying pan
[18:02] he said he took that frying pan and he
[18:04] threw the grease in brother braham's
[18:07] face now I don't know how true it is I'm
[18:09] just going by what he said if so be true
[18:13] still yet he said it didn't burn it
[18:16] didn't Scorch he said brother brandham
[18:18] never Flinch he wiped the grease off his
[18:21] face and said to the brother is exactly
[18:24] what I I said exactly what I
[18:26] meant i' have died
[18:30] if that had been me if it be true but
[18:33] but whether or not it is or no the fact
[18:36] is that's what faith does when it is
[18:40] undisturbed and he told the one brother
[18:42] he said only fear is what burn you not
[18:46] the
[18:48] fire
[18:50] fear see so you know you look at that
[18:54] kind of a thing and you think to
[18:55] yourself
[18:57] Lord you know
[18:59] I got to be
[19:00] there amen you see nothing could have
[19:03] harmed Jesus if he hadn't laid his life
[19:05] down amen
[19:07] amen right he would have never died if
[19:10] he had not surrendered
[19:12] it see it was something he had to do in
[19:16] order for that to even happen to him as
[19:18] a
[19:19] man oh think about it think about it now
[19:23] here it goes in in in Psalms uh 50 and
[19:27] I'm not even there yet
[19:30] Psalms 50 and we're going to begin at
[19:32] the 19th
[19:34] verse is this
[19:36] okay it's it's kind of piercing thou
[19:39] giveth th mouth to evil and thy tongue
[19:43] refra refrain deceit thou sth and
[19:46] speaketh against thy brother thou
[19:48] slander thy own Mother's Son these
[19:52] things has thou done and I kept
[19:55] silence thou thest that I was alog
[19:59] together such a one as
[20:02] thyself see he thought but I will
[20:05] reprove thee and set them in order
[20:09] before Thine
[20:10] Eyes now consider this he's telling them
[20:14] to
[20:14] think ye that forget God lest I tear you
[20:19] in pieces and there be none to deliver
[20:23] so using this I want you to understand
[20:25] how God hates
[20:27] that if God is saying I will tear you
[20:30] into the pieces that ain't that's no
[20:32] joke you know that's serious
[20:36] language serious language and we are so
[20:40] Carefree y'all hear what I'm
[20:43] saying right tell you into pieces and
[20:45] there be none to deliver whoo offereth
[20:50] praise glorify me and to him that
[20:54] orderthe conversation remember I said
[20:57] that last night that means means when
[20:58] you order something you already have
[21:01] thought about what you want you go to a
[21:03] restaurant you know what you order you
[21:07] know what you're looking at you order
[21:09] your
[21:10] day I'm going to be holy today you order

[21:22] I'm going to do this is what's going to
[21:24] happen this is what's not going to
[21:27] happen right and in all of that you're
[21:30] praising God for giving you the strength
[21:32] to do it you're praising him he said and
[21:36] and and order with his conversation a
[21:39] right a right will I show the salvation
[21:44] of God you listed you put down all the
[21:48] right you're going to do today amen
[21:52] amen he said then I'll show you the
[21:54] salvation of
[21:57] God and ain't God good the power of
[22:01] thought because think about it oh this
[22:05] is good to
[22:06] me I don't know why but he did the
[22:11] omnipotent
[22:13] Elohim self-existing one thought about
[22:19] me thought about you and that's why you
[22:24] here think about it God the Almighty
[22:29] you just didn't happen this is not some
[22:32] some uh freak Show from
[22:35] Evolution this is
[22:37] reality that God thought about you and
[22:42] think about it his thoughts were good
[22:45] amen amen is that the word he thought
[22:49] good about you and he was going to give
[22:52] you and expected
[22:55] in it wasn't evil God thought good of
[22:59] you amen the evil came by the serpent am
[23:02] but his thoughts have never changed
[23:04] about you it can never change nothing
[23:09] and so to prove that it could never
[23:12] change he died for you even while you
[23:14] was a sinner amen hallelujah but he
[23:17] loved you even when you was a sinner
[23:22] amen his thoughts think about it I'm the
[23:26] breathing living thought of God so are
[23:31] you
[23:33] amen and he knows your downsitting
[23:37] you're Uprising you're going in you're
[23:40] coming out he knows all of that about
[23:43] you because it is all his thoughts that
[23:47] you are living by
[23:52] amenu oh come on somebody I often
[23:56] wondered how on Earth God God could call
[23:59] Saul who is Paul to be an apostle or an
[24:02] angel of God you see what it was it was
[24:04] Satan history God you see what I'm
[24:07] saying Satan always tried to to
[24:09] interfere with the program of God always
[24:12] right always he tried to stop it from
[24:16] happening matter of fact he knew that if
[24:18] he could get Moses amen stirred up
[24:20] enough to deliver the children of Israel
[24:23] he was going to produce Mo make Moses
[24:25] become a murderer
[24:28] he knew Mo Moses was a
[24:31] warrior he knew he set him up but what
[24:34] he failed to see that when he set Moses
[24:37] up God was waiting him on him in the
[24:39] back of the desert
[24:40] amen and sometime that's what happen God
[24:43] puts us in predicaments and it look like
[24:46] we go out down like a loser but that's
[24:48] where God wants you to lift you up amen
[24:52] because his thoughts cannot come back to
[24:54] him void I don't care how Wicked you've
[24:57] been I don't care what you've been into
[24:59] what you struggling with now God's
[25:01] promise is that he will see you as a
[25:04] bride without spot without wrinkle
[25:07] without blemish amen God said so
[25:12] amen God said so this not about my
[25:14] thoughts it's about his thoughts amen
[25:16] and that's why he said let this mind be
[25:18] in you not the negative stuff not the
[25:22] stuff that's going to send you to hell
[25:23] cuz you weren't designed for that he
[25:25] said you're not the children of Wrath
[25:28] you're Children of the day not the
[25:30] Children of the Night come on you heard
[25:33] that amen The Children of the Night
[25:35] don't hear it you've heard
[25:37] it Hallelujah and he said look take
[25:40] these thoughts now this is one of the
[25:42] things that I thought I said Lord that's
[25:45] why the word of God according to Peter 1
[25:47] 1 13 wherefore girdle up the Lo of your
[25:50] mind be sober and hope to the end for
[25:52] the grace that is to be brought unto you
[25:54] at the revelation of Jesus Christ now
[25:56] let me ask you that scripture has has
[25:58] been
[26:00] fulfilled in your life when this message
[26:03] came to you that was a revelation of
[26:06] Jesus Christ amen at the Revelation and
[26:09] he says look Hope to the end what for
[26:12] the grace of God that'll be brought to
[26:15] you amen this revelation of Jesus Christ
[26:18] is bringing Grace yes amen come on
[26:22] somebody it's bringing grace to you why
[26:25] because the scripture says we all look
[26:27] like the children of wrath we all had
[26:29] that old cabur uh thing going on come on
[26:32] but it took a prophet said but in the
[26:34] midst of that cabur God had a wheat germ
[26:37] we wouldn't have never thought about it
[26:39] we would have never known it now let me
[26:41] let me show you say this to you so the
[26:43] wheat germ is on the inside but the cuur
[26:45] still exist y
[26:49] amen your flesh ain't nothing a cur
[26:51] that's just the way don't even think
[26:54] that's wheat that ain't no wheat amen
[26:56] that's your enemy praise the Lord amen
[26:58] it's wild and untamable if you if you
[27:00] don't is that the truth show you how
[27:03] Wild it is it goes right back down to
[27:05] James James said that tongue is unruly
[27:07] amen that tongue right is unruly that's
[27:10] what happened in the beginning sin
[27:12] started too with the
[27:14] tongue you shall not that word changed
[27:18] it that thought changed right and so
[27:21] that tongue
[27:23] always it it's ready to say something
[27:26] contrary to the thought of God is that
[27:30] right it's true it's always amen with
[27:33] the stripes I'm Healed that tongue will
[27:35] say man I feel bad right
[27:38] now right that tongue just set something
[27:41] to fire amen it kindled something that
[27:45] he should should be dead but he just
[27:48] kindled your feelings he kindled
[27:51] something and when you accept that guess
[27:53] what you feel
[27:54] worse like you've heard me say many
[27:57] times the devil can't curse you but he
[27:59] knows you got the ability to curse
[28:02] yourself cuz what God has blessed can no
[28:05] man curse amen right but out of your
[28:09] mouth you can give leave way to the
[28:12] enemy to your flesh Soul and
[28:17] Spirit out of your
[28:20] mouth you you bring an interest to the
[28:22] enemy is that all right now the Bible
[28:24] tells us also be not conformed to this
[28:28] world but transformed by the renewing of
[28:31] your mind your thinking capacities your
[28:35] where you think youro your the seat of
[28:37] your emotions and everything else is
[28:39] laying right there he said but be
[28:41] renewed there that means amen uh you
[28:45] once was new now you got to be
[28:49] renewed there was a point there's a mind
[28:51] that belongs to you that's got to be
[28:55] brought back to you and that's the mind
[28:58] that you lost by way of the
[29:01] fall right because the mind that Adam
[29:05] had was the mind of Christ amen amen and
[29:08] he would have passed that mind on
[29:10] because remember the brother R talks
[29:13] about he says listen he said he said
[29:15] Adam and Eve they would have come to it
[29:17] but God's perfect way of creation was by
[29:19] Spoken
[29:22] Word right but he and then he goes on to
[29:26] prove that to you in the future home he
[29:27] said said when we get over there he said
[29:29] we won't have any sex glands he tells
[29:33] about the story when he went beyond the
[29:35] curtain of time that woman who was 90
[29:37] something years old she embraced him and
[29:39] everything else amen there was no sex
[29:41] glands there because that's what's got
[29:44] us going wild right now amen you have to
[29:49] kill that joker every day don't you even
[29:51] think it don't you even try it you think
[29:53] you so super
[29:56] spiritual you better put that your foot
[29:58] on that Serpent's neck every day
[30:01] amen ain't God good to
[30:04] us listen how do you know you're out of
[30:07] the will of God is when you know you're
[30:09] covering
[30:14] something and so many people it is a
[30:17] natural thing brother Bram said that
[30:19] when Adam and Eve and sin Adam and Eve
[30:21] sin they hid themselves from
[30:25] God and that sin that you cover is the
[30:29] thing you need to be delivered from it
[30:32] is the thing that will send you to hell
[30:35] why because you haven't placed it under
[30:37] the blood amen am I making sense your
[30:40] thoughts is that I'm safe by not
[30:43] allowing it to be
[30:46] known no you're not safe you're in a
[30:49] danger zone hello somebody I'm not
[30:52] saying tell me you got to tell God Amen
[30:55] you see I'm not no priest or Pope that I
[30:57] can wash your sins if I could I wash
[31:00] everybody's sin plus my own but my point
[31:03] is amen covering is dangerous amen
[31:08] because amen covering like Adam and Eve
[31:10] is dangerous but the grace of God was
[31:12] with them God told them they surely die
[31:16] right and he and they did both
[31:18] spiritually and I mean I'm sorry uh both
[31:21] uh yeah spir and God comes around and he
[31:23] reconnects them right save them by his
[31:26] grace and they die spiritually right um
[31:30] naturally is the point I'm making right
[31:33] they're saved but they died naturally
[31:36] right why because the blood covered them
[31:39] that's how come they
[31:41] lived the blood covered them right aen
[31:45] he tried to hide that sin and he caused
[31:47] death unto others not just only to
[31:50] himself so I'm showing you what covering
[31:53] sin will do not only will it kill you
[31:56] but it'll also kill and affect your
[31:58] loved ones
[32:00] amen your animal your dog your cat
[32:03] whatever you got it
[32:06] curses hello come on when they kill a
[32:09] can they kill everything his children
[32:11] his wife his animals everything burned
[32:15] everything he
[32:17] owned see that's how
[32:22] effective God's word you must align your
[32:25] thought see and had aan confess
[32:28] before it was uncovered perhaps the
[32:31] grace of God would have been with him
[32:33] but he had to be uncovered his sin had
[32:37] to be exposed now watch this because
[32:40] remember most of the people that sins
[32:42] are exposed they don't ever repent have
[32:45] you ever seen one you ever seen one
[32:48] Fallen preacher that ever repented I'll
[32:50] use a preacher for an
[32:52] example when they were
[32:55] exposed but had they repented
[32:58] and come clean
[33:00] before you see I'm just just throwing
[33:03] that out y'all looking at me y'all my
[33:05] point is it's got to be that sin you
[33:08] cannot see God with sin that's not
[33:12] confessed amen okay I I I don't know
[33:15] what God put that in at the last minute
[33:16] while I was out there and he showed me
[33:19] ananas and
[33:20] Safar see just a simple sin and all they
[33:25] did was try to cover it don't cover C it
[33:28] people it is what it is I don't care
[33:31] what it may be it it may be the grossest
[33:34] thing to somebody else's mind or thought
[33:36] listen all Sin is Sin amen amen there
[33:40] ain't no big sin and no little sin it's
[33:42] all Wicked and your problems ain't no if
[33:46] you got a liar and a thief they're all
[33:48] wrong
[33:49] amen it's all fruits of the
[33:55] Flesh and not one of us I don't care who
[33:58] you may be we have no right to look down
[34:00] on anybody because of a shortcoming in
[34:03] somebody's else's flesh you might not
[34:06] have that problem but you got something
[34:08] amen amen y'all hear what I'm saying
[34:11] that's the only kind of love we supposed
[34:12] to have
[34:14] huah that's the only kind of love but my
[34:17] point is when the sin is covered you are
[34:20] in danger zone and the only way that you
[34:23] can be delivered is to uncover it and
[34:26] I'm going to tell you something this
[34:27] this is how I've learned this is how
[34:29] I've grown and I'm giving a testimony by
[34:32] going before God and calling it exactly
[34:37] what it
[34:40] is and said I need you deliver me from
[34:45] this I can't do it Lord you know and I'm
[34:48] going tell you something if you have a
[34:49] love for it tell
[34:51] him that's not wrong it's wrong to say
[34:54] talk to God and and oh I hate this thing
[34:57] no you don't cuz you're still doing it
[34:59] amen you got to love for it there's a
[35:01] spirit that loves it there's a pleasure
[35:03] in sin and the only way you can be to
[35:06] delivered is to say Lord but your
[35:09] thoughts concerning this is not the way
[35:12] it is with Amen in my life and I want
[35:15] your thoughts I want to hate what you
[35:17] hate I want to love what you love and so
[35:20] therefore I need you to renew my mind CU
[35:24] like I told you the problem is in the
[35:27] mind amen is your thoughts concerning
[35:29] the thing right so I'm working with that
[35:33] because I want you to understand that's
[35:35] where we are today in order to go
[35:37] forward in other words if a drain is
[35:39] stopped up it'll never it'll never it'll
[35:42] never drain properly until it's
[35:43] unplugged unstopped and if you want the
[35:46] Holy Spirit to flow through you like
[35:47] it's supposed to then that thing that's
[35:49] blocking the drainage the blocking the
[35:51] way of entrance must be unplugged
[35:53] unstopped
[35:56] am I'm going to tell y'all something
[35:58] just like this there things there were
[35:59] things I I stuttered I could didn't want
[36:01] to
[36:04] admit but I had
[36:12] to yeah I'm just telling you that's how
[36:14] you overcome be honest with God only the
[36:17] pure in heart shall see God all right
[36:21] and you keep you keep confessing it you
[36:24] keep asking for deliverance I don't care
[36:25] if you fall 20 minutes later you keep
[36:28] asking and showing God your sincereness
[36:31] about him delivering you and he will
[36:33] deliver you every time every time every
[36:37] time listen what the word of God says in
[36:39] Psalms 41 and I mean 14 and 2 the Lord
[36:42] lookth down from heaven upon the
[36:44] children of men to see if there were any
[36:46] that did understand and seek God they
[36:49] all all gone aside they are all together
[36:53] become filthy there is none that doeth
[36:56] good no not one not the preacher not the
[37:00] Deacon not the y'all hear what I'm
[37:02] saying or Prophet or anyone we had all
[37:05] come short of the glory of God this is
[37:07] what I'm saying what we need to see is
[37:10] the love of God for us amen if you can
[37:13] see this eternal predestinated love of
[37:17] God it'll make you want to repent amen
[37:20] like brother Adam said Lord you calling
[37:22] for a perfect people take this out of me
[37:25] take this out of me take this out of me
[37:27] why because I want to be perfect for the
[37:28] perfect place see your motive and
[37:31] objective is what God is looking
[37:38] at
[37:42] huh Romans 4:17 it says as it written
[37:46] have made the a father of many nations
[37:48] before whom he beli even God who Quicken
[37:52] the dead and call those things would be
[37:54] not as though they were and that's what
[37:55] you and I must learn how to do it's has
[37:57] nothing to do with your feelings your
[38:00] feelings got has nothing to do with it
[38:02] it's calling it The as you know what you
[38:05] want to be a perfect man that's what you
[38:07] say Amen it almost make you feel like a
[38:09] liar and a hypocrite I'm a I'm perfect
[38:13] amen in Christ Jesus by his
[38:16] grace Hallelujah I'm full of all of his
[38:19] virtues I don't care if you just
[38:21] stumbled a five minutes ago said no
[38:23] matter what you made me do devil I still
[38:26] got it yeah I got it am right you have
[38:30] to call those things you got to pull for
[38:32] it remember because your words go out
[38:35] meet God's thought God thought comes
[38:37] back and Quicken it make it right for
[38:40] you that's what God
[38:42] does no no not one is that right oh
[38:47] listen I I thought about it and I I I
[38:49] can't remember where the man of God said
[38:51] it but and now you know if you don't put
[38:54] it right in that in the program like it
[38:56] says it you will never get get it but so
[38:58] let me paraphrase it he basically said
[39:01] when you need
[39:03] a a something is going on in your life
[39:06] he said choose a character that's going
[39:09] through the same thing and you become
[39:11] him that's the essence of what he said
[39:14] right so if you going through something
[39:16] you got a Goliath in your in your in
[39:18] your life you become David amen right
[39:21] and now you you follow what David did
[39:24] you follow David's attitude cuz that's
[39:27] God's thoughts David caught God's
[39:30] thoughts it was all of those uh his
[39:34] brothers and all of Israel who was
[39:36] shaken in their shoes because they had
[39:38] their own thought their own thoughts
[39:41] brought fear yes their all thoughts
[39:44] brought
[39:46] unbelief come on somebody their own
[39:49] thoughts made them
[39:52] uh how would I say it not a loser but
[39:55] they were were not Victorious
[39:58] but David caught God's
[40:01] thought God Who Who Are You You
[40:05] uncircumcised philis and watch what he's
[40:07] working with he's working with a man who
[40:09] knows not God
[40:12] uncircumcised he uses that term come on
[40:15] and because he's really saying you
[40:18] devil amen right now we know
[40:20] circumstances of the heart now we're not
[40:22] working with the natural but he says you
[40:24] devil how can you boast yourself against
[40:26] the Living God God Amen see so he caught
[40:29] God's thought and he flowed with God's
[40:32] thought now David knew never knew how
[40:35] exactly God was going to do it but he he
[40:37] like I like you've heard me say many
[40:39] times he could have done a a a Cod wheel
[40:42] and a backwards flip before he threw
[40:44] that stone and he knew God was going to
[40:46] kill a giant with that's how his faith
[40:49] was he'd rather put his life online to
[40:53] stay with the thought of Goden because
[40:56] he knew the thoughts of God would save
[40:57] him
[40:58] amen see and that's how it is the Bible
[41:02] is they are this is the thought of God
[41:04] these words are what God thought from
[41:07] the beginning and if we can and and
[41:09] that's what I was working with
[41:10] meditation meditation because as
[41:13] Christians we don't do much of that we
[41:15] don't more less pray yes let's meditate
[41:19] but meditate is mean to uh uh you can
[41:22] sing it you can hum it you can but you
[41:24] take uh the word of God and you think
[41:27] about it you allow it to consume you
[41:30] like for instance Paul says amen
[41:33] according to uh Philippians 14 14 I can
[41:36] do all things through Christ which
[41:39] strengthen is me now the Bible says and
[41:42] I'm going to get to that scripture
[41:43] because I'm I'm moving a little bit too
[41:44] fast but but it goes on and says if
[41:47] there be any virtue if there be any
[41:49] praise think on these things amen
[41:53] hallelujah you meditate on the word of
[41:55] God and that word becom becomes you and
[41:57] you becomes the word because you are
[42:00] God's thoughts it is collect it is a
[42:03] collecting of God's thoughts and
[42:05] bringing them into your heart and that
[42:07] collection of God thought become you and
[42:09] you become amen let's put it this way
[42:12] scientists know that men can be
[42:19] brainwashed yes a a scientist they can
[42:22] they can literally take you through H uh
[42:25] uh experiences and literally change your
[42:28] name and you won't remember what it
[42:31] is they can take a coward and make him a
[42:36] warrier yeah just by feeding him
[42:40] thoughts thoughts thoughts right amen
[42:44] and that's
[42:45] forcing what about the man whosoever
[42:48] will what about the one who wants it to
[42:50] happen what about the one who says Lord
[42:52] renew my mind wash me clean like David
[42:56] says wash me wash me clean create in me
[43:01] a clean
[43:04] heart see that's where we are created I
[43:07] want your thoughts to be my thoughts I
[43:09] want your ways to be my ways I want your
[43:11] words to be my words I want to speak
[43:14] like you speak and talk like you talk
[43:16] and brother brandom said that's exactly
[43:18] what God wants to do in you live his
[43:21] life through you see through your eyes
[43:24] speak through your mouth hear by way of
[43:26] your ears
[43:28] that's what he wants Hallelujah God's
[43:30] thoughts and think about it you'll never
[43:34] perish Heaven and Earth will pass away
[43:37] but you'll stand cuz you are the word
[43:41] think about it see that's where we've
[43:42] been we've been wasting I won't say
[43:45] wasting time but but but put it this way
[43:48] Abraham had had a revelation when he
[43:50] called those things that be not as
[43:51] though they were Abraham caught a
[43:54] revelation cuz he said God said so amen
[43:58] see it ain't what appeared look like
[44:00] we're growing older and you know what
[44:02] I'm saying but God says we are in a
[44:04] Rapture amen we're being changed right
[44:08] now
[44:09] amen right now it doesn't matter what it
[44:12] looks like we're being changed from
[44:15] Mortal to immortality amen right now
[44:20] amen that's what the word say Paul was
[44:24] so convinced he says nay in R 8:37 n in
[44:28] all these things we are more than
[44:30] conquerors through him that loved us see
[44:32] what I'm saying he said because he loved
[44:34] us we are more than conquerors not
[44:37] because we love him because he loved us
[44:41] we are more than conquerors wo come on
[44:43] somebody for I am persuaded that neither
[44:46] death nor life nor Angel nor
[44:49] principality nor powers nor things
[44:51] present nor things to come nor height
[44:54] nor death nor any other creature shall
[44:56] be able to separate us from the love of
[44:59] God which is in Christ Jesus our lord
[45:04] Hallelujah and when that bundle of love
[45:06] was was born in a manger I was in there
[45:09] am you were in there come on somebody we
[45:13] traveled from Heaven to Earth and now
[45:15] we're changing from Earth to
[45:17] Glory by way of Jesus
[45:21] Christ the first Adam had all these
[45:23] natural bodies in him the second Adam
[45:26] had all the spiritual
[45:29] oh my look what he
[45:32] says in the message uh here you him is
[45:35] this okay I don't have time he said he
[45:37] that believeth not in is condemned
[45:40] already before you even get started we
[45:43] condemned you were born in sin shaped in
[45:45] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[45:48] no matter how much you was dedicated on
[45:50] the altar how many times you were
[45:52] sprinkled baptized poured water it
[45:55] whatever it is you still a that's all
[45:58] until you repent and God recognizes and
[46:01] seal that promise with the Holy Spirit
[46:04] that's right then you're born again then
[46:06] you're Sons and Daughters of God it's a
[46:09] regeneration a new creation and that's
[46:13] another thing we are allowing Satan to
[46:16] make us think that we are a patched up
[46:19] job yeah Lord but we are New Creation
[46:23] listen the scripture says All Things Are
[46:27] pass away oh right and behold all things
[46:30] have become new that's the way it's
[46:33] supposed to be amen but it is our
[46:36] thoughts that make us feel like it's a p
[46:39] up job you and I must come to the place
[46:42] and tell devil you've been lying to me a
[46:44] long time I am a new
[46:48] creation and all things have passed away
[46:51] then when you began to speak like that
[46:53] all of those things must pass away
[46:56] because the word is active the word is
[46:59] active the word is
[47:03] active it's his thought we must speak
[47:06] then you're born again then you Sons and
[47:07] Daughters of God is a regeneration a new
[47:09] creation then your attributes your
[47:12] thoughts are not like they were your
[47:14] life is not like it was you become a
[47:17] complete surrendered vessel to God and
[47:20] he speaks and uses you and you're not
[47:23] your own no more you but you've been
[47:26] brought with a price that price of the
[47:29] Precious Blood of the Lord Jesus think
[47:31] of it now it's instant they cried to cut
[47:35] div they try try to cut out Divine
[47:38] Healing off from salvation see what I'm
[47:40] saying now you look at this thing and so
[47:43] you and I understand what the word of
[47:45] God says now as our brother conly gave
[47:49] me that quote which is so true if you
[47:50] don't believe in Divine Healing you're
[47:53] lost you there's no Rapture for you
[47:56] there's no eternal life because God is
[48:00] Divine Healing yes sir amen there's no
[48:02] such thing as being in his presence or
[48:04] where he's at and sickness can
[48:07] abide hey that's why the Bible says over
[48:10] there there'll be nothing that will
[48:11] defile there'll be nothing that you know
[48:13] Li there's nothing that will will change
[48:16] that over there because there's no way
[48:18] you can stand before Holy Fire no germ
[48:20] can stand before Holy
[48:23] Fire
[48:25] now so that we can understand this is
[48:28] why our thoughts are so important now uh
[48:31] our thoughts must coincide it doesn't
[48:34] mean it doesn't mean Satan is not going
[48:37] to fly into your
[48:39] head see and that's the thing what the
[48:42] devil does he says oh I let's just use
[48:45] this let's just use this S as a scenario
[48:47] oh I just feel like smoking and you all
[48:50] to tell him go ahead on you go ahead on
[48:53] and smoke because I'm not amen he uses
[48:56] the first person to make it think that's
[48:58] you thinking
[49:03] that y'all hear what I'm saying that's
[49:05] what he does he used the first person to
[49:08] make you think you were thinking that
[49:10] and he gets into your head and he brings
[49:13] that thought to you remember I said
[49:14] you'll never sin if you don't listen to
[49:16] his
[49:17] thoughts but he does it he brings that
[49:19] that and listen people don't want to
[49:21] think he's got an anointing but he
[49:22] brings feelings with
[49:24] it he brings feelings he says oh I feel
[49:27] like doing this and he brings that
[49:28] anointing to you got to say I rebuke you
[49:31] devil cuz my thoughts are pure and clean
[49:34] before God Amen see somewhere you got to
[49:37] learn that's maturity amen I'm teaching
[49:40] you now teaching you how to combat the
[49:43] devil when he comes with those negative
[49:45] thoughts you've got to say no this is it
[49:49] it is written it is written Hallelujah
[49:52] you ain't got to jump scream and holler
[49:54] you say it is written and walk away from
[49:57] it cuz when you walk even if you got to
[50:00] express a
[50:01] walking you move out of that oppress
[50:04] anointing if you stay there that
[50:06] anointing will be there with you and
[50:08] eventually it will convince you to do
[50:12] what it wants you to
[50:13] do yes brother there it is reasoning he
[50:16] will reason with you you know you want
[50:18] to do it yes that's what he
[50:22] does see the devil know has been has
[50:25] known that offes yours a long time now
[50:28] he knows what you like he ain't no guess
[50:32] work he ain't guessing amen but the
[50:35] point is you got to let him know you are
[50:37] a new
[50:39] creation is that the truth now God knows
[50:42] his the truth I tell you what when I got
[50:44] saved it was no problem leaving my
[50:45] so-called friends behind because they
[50:47] left
[50:48] me is that right they saw that Holiness
[50:51] and they didn't want it the devil is the
[50:53] same way once he see you really serious
[50:55] about your holiness he ain't going to
[50:57] bother you he'll leave you he might come
[50:59] back for a season to see whether you
[51:01] really mean it
[51:02] still but he ain't going to be
[51:04] fellowshipping with you when you all
[51:06] talking about Holiness and praising the
[51:07] Lord and God is good he don't want to
[51:09] hear that stuff he want he want to see
[51:11] you defile yourself or bring yourself
[51:14] into a a mental state where he got you
[51:16] all impr prison in your
[51:18] mind we've been set free people we've
[51:21] been set free your thoughts must be
[51:23] Freedom the voice of many Waters cry out
[51:26] thickness in multitudes the voice of
[51:28] those seven stars in his hand every
[51:30] Church age preaching the baptism of the
[51:33] Holy Ghost the baptism in Jesus name
[51:35] speaking in tongues the power of God the
[51:36] resurrection of Christ the second coming
[51:39] Divine judgment the voice of many Waters
[51:41] coming forth from this one that looked
[51:43] like the son of man many Waters what
[51:46] it'll be to know to know that you see it
[51:49] set in meetings and heard that and you
[51:52] should get right with God and receive
[51:54] the Holy Ghost and a drifting soul to
[51:56] hear that voice speak out of the meeting
[51:59] that you set in and heard the Judgment
[52:01] of God preach and refused it the Great
[52:03] Falls just before you The Great Cat
[52:07] cataracts that'll take you to your
[52:09] Eternal
[52:10] Doom brother B said Hell Fire will seem
[52:13] like a pleasure he said 100 times over
[52:17] worse is this place called
[52:20] hell no way to describe it y'all hear
[52:23] what I'm saying amen how you going to to
[52:26] do it now I want you to understand that
[52:28] was the only thing that made Cain
[52:29] different Cain
[52:32] thought contrary to the
[52:34] word and even though God brought the
[52:37] thought his thought his intent to Cain
[52:41] Cain still refuse to accept the thoughts
[52:44] of God am and that's what condemns us is
[52:48] when we refuse to take the thoughts of
[52:50] God versus our own thought and our own
[52:54] reasoning Lord help us die to ourselves
[52:58] amen I'm going jump now but look what he
[53:02] says he goes on to say but God knows the
[53:04] thoughts and intents of the heart he
[53:06] knows all about it he said to the
[53:08] Pharisees you hypocrite how can you
[53:10] speak good things when I out of the
[53:12] abundance of the heart speaketh the
[53:14] mouth calling me master good and I know
[53:17] I can look right through you and see
[53:19] that you're hypocrit you don't mean that
[53:22] oh what will that be on that day when
[53:25] that voice Thunders out of many Waters
[53:27] many Church agents forming out now I
[53:29] want to ask you something else let me
[53:31] say something to you people that's saved
[53:33] let me say this to you now you drifting
[53:36] Souls you P Drifter Drifters that's
[53:38] drifting over the great cataracts y be
[53:41] careful it'll be a horrible thing when
[53:43] you know that there's no saving for you
[53:46] then you can get you can you can't get
[53:49] saved then you know your doom lays right
[53:52] before you when you know within a few
[53:54] minutes you'll hear the voice speak out
[53:56] depart from me you workers of iniquity
[53:59] and into Everlasting fire which is
[54:00] prepared for the devil and his Angel
[54:02] you'll know when you hear that Great
[54:05] Falls or roaring of those voices of
[54:07] those meetings while you're passing out
[54:10] of this oh what a horrible thing what a
[54:13] nightmare don't let it happen to you
[54:15] people repent get right with God now
[54:18] while you can get right I I listen let
[54:22] me say it like this I'm reading this
[54:24] because a close friend of mine just died
[54:25] the other day had his wake I think today
[54:27] and tomorrow um they'll be having his
[54:30] funeral only 59 years old a pastor of a
[54:34] church lovely wife is his best friend I
[54:37] don't know what she's going to you know
[54:38] I mean it's going to be pretty hard
[54:40] children Family Church he's out there
[54:45] hunting he's in the the what you call it
[54:47] the tree place tree stands he catches a
[54:51] heart attack and
[54:52] falls and hit the ground dead
[54:57] they couldn't revive him but one thing
[54:59] about him he's got a true
[55:01] testimony amen he was a real Christian
[55:04] if I've ever seen one Hallelujah y'all
[55:07] hear what I'm saying but the point is
[55:09] God didn't give no warnings God don't
[55:11] have to make you sick before you
[55:14] die and a lot of time we think we got to
[55:16] feel something that no God can call your
[55:19] number right now and you boom the point
[55:21] is you must be ready when that thing
[55:24] when God calls your number I thank God
[55:26] for our brother Sam I I feel bad because
[55:28] I've been trying to go back and visit
[55:30] some of my old friends for years and
[55:32] even when I was in line I can I'm going
[55:34] back I'm going back and I hadn't been on
[55:35] the East Coast for a long time I got
[55:37] awesome friends there and I told her
[55:39] sister today I sure want to get there
[55:41] before all of them leave me you know I I
[55:43] love him and Samuel he he knows now he
[55:46] can see you know and I you know I just
[55:49] thank God for him uh you know especially
[55:51] the testimony uh of his life you know
[55:55] and uh you know he's going on to meet
[55:57] with God that's another one I'll see
[55:59] when that Resurrection come amen but you
[56:02] know I'm saying that because you don't
[56:05] know when that hour is going to come you
[56:08] can look like a picture of health and
[56:10] gone but if your thoughts are contrary
[56:12] to God's thoughts like brother say God
[56:15] will judge what's the life that's in you
[56:17] amen not what you portray it's what's in
[56:21] you that speaks to God
[56:26] Philippians 4:8 finally my brethren I'm
[56:29] not going I'm not going to finish this I
[56:30] see finally my brethren whatsoever
[56:32] things are true whatsoever things are
[56:34] honest whatsoever things are just
[56:37] whatsoever things are pure whatsoever
[56:39] things are lovely whatsoever things are
[56:41] of a good report if there be any what
[56:44] virtue if there be any praise think on
[56:47] these things now virtue is strength vert
[56:50] if there be it says listen these things
[56:52] are the things that bring strength to
[56:54] you amen which in turn would bring
[56:58] praise right and I thought about what is
[57:01] a good report what is a good report the
[57:03] Bible says now Faith is the substance of
[57:05] things hope for the evidence of things
[57:06] seen for by it the elders obtain a good
[57:10] report Hallelujah that's a good report
[57:14] Faith amen faith in God faith in God's
[57:17] word faith that acted upon his thoughts
[57:20] am faith is what gave them a good report
[57:26] through faith we understand that the
[57:28] world was framed by the word of God so
[57:30] that things which are seen were not made
[57:32] by things which do appear we had a
[57:34] prophet tell us what it was about God
[57:37] thought it he spoke it it
[57:38] [Applause]
[57:40] created
[57:42] right that's exactly right he believed
[57:45] his own word he's his thoughts expressed
[57:48] and you must believe if God got to
[57:50] believe his own word you got to believe
[57:52] it how can God deny his own word he
[57:56] cannot and if God is in you it can't
[57:58] help but to believe it amen by faith
[58:01] April offered unto God of all excellent
[58:03] sacrificed and came by which he obtained
[58:06] witness that he was righteous God
[58:08] testifying of his gift and by it being
[58:11] dead yet speak it now it's powerful to
[58:13] me that is so powerful to me when God
[58:16] judges you to be righteous and holy he
[58:18] makes a way for that to happen and how
[58:20] does he do it by revealing it revealing
[58:24] your airing ways is God righteousness
[58:27] toward you and so when he reveals your
[58:30] erroring ways and you find a way to fix
[58:33] it like abble
[58:35] did it was a revelation the blood of
[58:38] Jesus Christ was his Revelation and he
[58:41] received it and repented and he offered
[58:44] unto God the very thing God gave to him
[58:46] and God said you
[58:48] righteous come on somebody so God just
[58:52] just he's not just more than just he's
[58:54] he's he's merciful
[58:56] because he comes and he reveals to us
[58:58] our aing ways and say repent if you
[59:00] repent I know you're mine Hallelujah
[59:03] that's what he says that's basically
[59:05] what it is cuz Cain saw the thoughts of
[59:07] God and walked away from
[59:09] it and where did God mock him in his
[59:16] head is that all right so we look at
[59:20] that and then then uh he says by Enoch
[59:22] this where and and my brother gave me
[59:24] some good quotes I I was back there St I
[59:26] had to lay them down but it's true the
[59:29] Enoch because remember and I'm going to
[59:31] get to that quote in just a minute I'm
[59:33] about there by faith Enoch was
[59:35] translated that he should not see death
[59:37] and was not found because God had
[59:39] translated him for before his
[59:43] translation he had this testimony that
[59:45] he pleased god without faith is
[59:48] impossible to please God now here it is
[59:52] Enoch testimony final test I'm sure it
[59:55] was
[59:56] it probably didn't say that but let me
[59:58] put it this
[59:59] way he had to have a final
[1:00:02] test Jesus had a final test Moses had a
[1:00:06] final test
[1:00:09] right uh you look at it there's always
[1:00:11] that one thing that God will try you
[1:00:15] with to see whether you are true
[1:00:18] Overcomer now Jesus's test was what
[1:00:23] Calvary he knew he was supposed to go
[1:00:26] through it he understood he was the one
[1:00:29] but he in his natural man he said Lord
[1:00:33] would you let this cup be passed for
[1:00:35] me see your natural man ain't going to
[1:00:38] want to do it but there's got to be
[1:00:40] something great on the inside which is
[1:00:42] representation that will overcome that
[1:00:44] nevertheless not my will but thine be
[1:00:47] done you think Peter then was all happy
[1:00:51] praise God I'm going to be
[1:00:53] crucified you know that flesh
[1:00:56] come on somebody let's get real with it
[1:00:59] but Peter overcame it and he was so bold
[1:01:02] with it he said don't crucify me like my
[1:01:04] Lord turn me upside down I'm not even
[1:01:06] worthy to be crucified like him come on
[1:01:10] somebody they must have look at him like
[1:01:12] he was a fool and he was one for Christ
[1:01:15] see so but he knew the thoughts of God
[1:01:18] why because God told him this is what
[1:01:20] this was your
[1:01:21] ear you go
[1:01:23] back right come on somebody Paul to God
[1:01:26] told Paul what his Destiny was going to
[1:01:29] be you're going to meet
[1:01:30] Nero right you'll die at his chopping
[1:01:34] block and Paul said oh death wears your
[1:01:36] stain oh great you see they knew the
[1:01:39] thought they stayed with the thought of
[1:01:42] God even unto
[1:01:45] death if it's God's will for me to die
[1:01:47] so be it because I rest in his
[1:01:51] peace right so let's move on so Enoch I
[1:01:55] put it this way Enoch
[1:01:56] final test oh I wish I could have
[1:01:59] anybody ever seen and I hate to say
[1:02:01] things now because I I'll be messing up
[1:02:03] sometime but have any of y'all seen
[1:02:05] where brother brandom said God I mean
[1:02:07] Enoch wave goodbye to his
[1:02:10] family okay is in there
[1:02:13] somewhere I didn't even know he had a
[1:02:15] family he say way goodbye to his
[1:02:18] wife I'll find it I just wish I could
[1:02:22] put it all together like some of these
[1:02:23] people can but nevertheless even I say
[1:02:25] didn't have one but think about it when
[1:02:28] Enoch walked with
[1:02:30] God Amen when Enoch walked with God Amen
[1:02:34] he was by
[1:02:37] himself the whole world was against him
[1:02:41] and here was a man living a holy
[1:02:44] life corruption was setting in and he's
[1:02:48] standing with the word of God now he had
[1:02:51] to believe that he would be translated
[1:02:54] otherwise he would not have had he he
[1:02:55] wouldn't have happened Jesus Christ when
[1:02:58] he went down to the Grave he had to
[1:03:00] believe that
[1:03:02] scripture I will not let uh corruption
[1:03:06] set in what's
[1:03:12] the suffer my Holy One yeah I think
[1:03:15] that's in Isaiah or Psalm one or two I
[1:03:17] will not let suffer my Holy One to see
[1:03:19] corruption he had to believe that that
[1:03:22] had to be a faith to
[1:03:24] him before he he would go down he had to
[1:03:27] believe he was coming up amen that's why
[1:03:30] the Bible said those they died in faith
[1:03:34] they know they coming up they know
[1:03:35] there's a resurrection Joseph said take
[1:03:38] my body out of Egypt put it back in the
[1:03:40] promised land cuz there's coming the
[1:03:42] resurrection he died in faith believing
[1:03:45] in the resurrection and so will you I
[1:03:48] don't care how beat up your body may be
[1:03:50] when you get ready to go down you got to
[1:03:53] believe one day I'm coming up amen
[1:03:56] you got to believe it by God's grace but
[1:03:59] without faith it's impossible to please
[1:04:00] him but he that cometh to God must
[1:04:02] believe that he is and that he is
[1:04:04] rewarded them that diligently seek him
[1:04:06] now I'm going jump because I talked
[1:04:08] about meditation but I'mma jump
[1:04:10] now I just believe and it that Enoch was
[1:04:13] a meditator on the word because he
[1:04:16] walked with
[1:04:18] God now here's the quote and I read this
[1:04:21] last night I'm going to close it out on
[1:04:22] this because I'm G to finish up on
[1:04:24] Sunday then the second heaven is
[1:04:26] considered the solar
[1:04:28] system and the third heaven goes beyond
[1:04:31] that now we just happened to think just
[1:04:34] watch this a minute now Einstein proved
[1:04:37] by
[1:04:38] scientific that if two objects were was
[1:04:41] coming to each other like two cars
[1:04:44] coming down across the road and if we're
[1:04:46] coming fast enough now they really have
[1:04:50] to be going fast like a billion miles
[1:04:52] per second but they could pass right
[1:04:55] through one another and never disturb
[1:04:58] disturb a thing you know I probably
[1:05:01] could give this quote to a scientist and
[1:05:03] if he can produce a machine that could
[1:05:05] actually move something at a billion
[1:05:06] miles per second I guarantee you the
[1:05:10] work brother ROM threw things in there
[1:05:13] like he didn't understand what was
[1:05:14] happening but I'm going tell you
[1:05:16] something now you can find out some of
[1:05:17] these things that he said scientists are
[1:05:18] now declaring them
[1:05:20] now see so you know you look at these
[1:05:23] things and and you sometime we we we
[1:05:26] listen to him and we anyway but they
[1:05:28] could pass right through one another and
[1:05:30] never disturb a thing the speed would do
[1:05:33] it pass them right through one another
[1:05:35] without disturbing anything now I I'm
[1:05:39] standing here not long ago at Mount
[1:05:42] Paloma California and I was noticing
[1:05:44] there a telescope that can see hundreds
[1:05:46] and 20 million years of light space now
[1:05:48] that now think 120 million years of
[1:05:52] light space how many miles that would be
[1:05:54] to be broke down see but yet Heaven is
[1:05:58] so many billions and billions and
[1:06:01] billions of light years beyond
[1:06:04] that till it's not even thought of how
[1:06:07] would we get there it's the travel it
[1:06:10] will be it will be like the
[1:06:15] Mind think about it it will be like the
[1:06:18] mind it's so
[1:06:21] fast it'll be
[1:06:24] faster if you could think of Heaven
[1:06:27] that's how quick you'll be
[1:06:29] there Jesus after he was resurrected
[1:06:31] came right through the wall right
[1:06:33] through the door and stood and ate bored
[1:06:36] fish and honey comb Hallelujah speed no
[1:06:39] sooner than life has come out of this
[1:06:41] body we're in the presence of God
[1:06:44] y he said billions and billions and
[1:06:47] billions of miles now I I know what he
[1:06:49] said he said it's a dimension but I
[1:06:51] think if he's if you working with I
[1:06:54] don't know how you do that because they
[1:06:56] said there's now a way that you can
[1:06:57] actually instead of going around you can
[1:07:01] go through I don't know the scientific
[1:07:03] terms on that but you know they say it's
[1:07:04] a giant now they talks about wormholes
[1:07:07] and all these kind of things these
[1:07:10] things
[1:07:11] exist so my point is think about this
[1:07:17] because here we are in our minds and God
[1:07:21] got certain things laying there
[1:07:23] dorming for his use
[1:07:27] see Jesus Christ didn't have no problem
[1:07:29] with hybrid Foods he had a perfect mind
[1:07:32] his functions were perfect right and God
[1:07:36] could use him perfectly but here we are
[1:07:40] if I I be look at it one of these old
[1:07:43] days let's put it this way one of these
[1:07:45] old days and I know y'all gonna think
[1:07:47] I'm crazy but you're going to be
[1:07:49] thinking about the
[1:07:51] Rapture or perhaps you might be dreaming
[1:07:54] about the rapture
[1:07:57] but whatever it is the rapture is going
[1:07:58] to be on your
[1:08:00] mind and before you know it you going to
[1:08:03] be raptured amen because you'll be able
[1:08:07] to catch God's
[1:08:09] thoughts for that period and for that
[1:08:13] time amen and when you catch it see
[1:08:16] nobody else will catch it only those who
[1:08:19] are designed and got the mind of
[1:08:21] Christ Hallelujah come on somebody and
[1:08:24] when you got the mind of Christ you
[1:08:26] going to catch that thought and before
[1:08:28] you know it you'll be swept away
[1:08:31] amen come on somebody and God going to
[1:08:34] make it so easy for us brother he'll
[1:08:37] begin to let us see loved
[1:08:39] ones and that in itself will cause us to
[1:08:42] think about it oh come on somebody it
[1:08:45] will be truly a real Faith
[1:08:52] Builder don't you feel that don't you
[1:08:54] feel that amen amen that's God's mind
[1:08:57] he's not going to just leave us alone
[1:08:59] and say f for yourself he has fought the
[1:09:02] Battle for us every inch of the
[1:09:06] way he'll never leave us nor forsake us
[1:09:09] let's
[1:09:11] stand I will start by God's grace Sunday
