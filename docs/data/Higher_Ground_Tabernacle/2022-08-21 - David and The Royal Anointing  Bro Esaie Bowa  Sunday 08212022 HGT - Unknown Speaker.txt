for every one of us from the beginning of the year till now i believe that it's a particular grace that god has granted to us [Music] some are in the sickbed some found themselves in prisons they were prevented from their liberty some died passed away and if we can just look back we're going to see that it was the grace of god maybe you were not maybe we were not the best person that exists on earth maybe we did not live the word fully as we should ask but did not look at that he gave us life without price [Music] [Music] holding him along and i want you lord to place your word in my in my tongue and that you move me out of the way and that your place and your presence in it leaves this place right now in the name of the lord jesus christ and we we cast it out from this place and we want the holy spirit to dominate us in this [Music] in the name of jesus christ our god amen amen we're standing we're going to read the holy scriptures and samuel we're going to read in the book of first samuel chapter 16 from verse 1 to 14. we're going to read this first samuel chapter 16 from verse 1 to 14. okay and the lord said unto samuel [Music] provided for i have provided me a king among his sons if so hear it he will kill me i am come to sacrifice to the lord i will show thee what thou shalt do and the elders of the town tremble that is coming and said cometh that peace only happened and said cometh that peaceably and he said possibly i come to sacrifice unto the lord sanctified sacrifice sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice and he sacrificed jesse and his sons and called call them to the sacrifices and it came to pass when they were come that he looked on eliab and said surely the lord and the lord's anointed is before it beforehand but the lord said unto samuel look not onto his countenance on the heights of his stature because i have refused them. the lord does not look on what the lord seeth not amen what man seemed for man looketh unto on the outward appearance but the lord looketh on the heart is and he said neither has the lord chosen this then then then jesus made shama to pass by and he said neither has the lord chosen this is again jesse made seven of his sons to pass before samuel and samuel said unto jesus the lord has not chosen these songs and samuel said out to jess they are or hear all thy children and he said there remaineth yet the youngest and behold he keepeth the sheep and samuel said unto jesus send and fetch him for we will not sit down till he come either and he sent and brought him now he was ready with all of the beautiful countenances and the lord said arise anoint him for this is he samuel um then samuel took the orange oil and the spirit of the lord came upon david from that day forward so so samuel rose up and went to rama esprit de la tunnel but the spirit of the lord departed from soul and an evil spirits from the lord in my prayer to you okay man to remove every thoughts of man and that only the thoughts of the father remain so that you may give the gift of life to your children as soon as we surrender in your word in the name of jesus christ amen amen this morning i'm going to title my little subject david and the the the anointing of the king first i wanted to say something first i want to say something but i i don't know if it's going to be understood the way i want it to be understood i'm going to put this aside i want to say this but it's the word of god [Music] he says that when the preacher is everyone has to be silent so that the preacher can be heard now this is the word of god that's being being proclaimed if he's preaching under the anointing spread the prophet's son to me or prophet then every spirit of the prophet is subject to the prophet when a pastor walks to the black platform turns the bible along and you can preach you're wondering if the people that are listening to you are understanding what you're saying i've seen brother brooks say brother brooks say sometimes how are you looking at staring at me like that as if i'm lying to you on paper no but when you stand here you cannot lie we're waiting on god [Music] and and when you come here you also have to be expecting from god to speak and when you come together brother rhyme says we come here to get better the power of pleasure and his servants are waiting on him to bring the word for him so when you see the word of god being preached you can say amen you can say it as the then you're gonna then you're going to say then you're going to say that he's he's talking about me i'm wondering if we're still those spiritual christians that that wait to hear from the spirit now it's a tradition that people come to church now you think that people are waiting to understand what's being said but they're they're actually waiting to understand when you come with such attitude you're not going to be what gratitude because your attitude toward god is not good is that even when the person that's preaching doesn't know your personal issues spoke to the preacher to speak about with the problem that's happening now you're just going to be saying that oh he's just talking about me and those who are perfect don't live with us here on earth those the gods sought perfect he took them out from the earth do you understand those who aren't god took them out from the earth standing here i have i have mistakes no you also have your faults but when you come here you have to expect that the word of god either blesses you or comforts you fine maybe water yeah mercedes i also saw that there are new faces among us here we all bless you in the name of our lord jesus christ we are this is your church here was just to prepare your spirit so that you feel well and not a pastor because the preacher can come from any place not knowing your problem when he's gonna but it could be that the holy spirit spoke to you through that preacher that lives with you hello now listen we read with you in the book of samuel uh and i told you that i'm titling the subject david and the royal anointing and if you noticed well ivanka david saw when the launch before david was anointed by the royal anointing david did not do anything to to to be worthy of that anointing david did not do anything to be worthy of that anointing it was just the grace of god and god said that they were not the ones that were chosen david was the one that was chosen israel before he was still king but he was already rejected from god was rejected by god because he did something that did not please the lord the bible said that god told tonight that through the mouth of my prophetic just like the soldiers came god was not pleased with it because they were bringing foreign is listen to this my brothers and sisters not after that prophecy [Applause] just because the person doesn't follow god anymore we must find myself yes my brothers and sisters god predestinated he will choose yes the program of god cannot stop because of one person god will always have someone to raise an economy because in the economy he never missed witnesses it did not depend on the appearance of the person was a good a good man but he was rejected and when saul when samuel came to another but the choice of god was somewhere in the woods he was there with the sheep he was there with the pastors god took him from the past he [Applause] get your son because you are his choice it doesn't depend on the appearance it doesn't depend on the height but it depends on the grace of god that's on you that he was anointed among his brothers no god will not raise you up somewhere else he will raise you up among your brothers the anointing that you will get from god will be among your brothers yes my brothers and sisters david was the one that was the most neglected he was neglected even from his father [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] people that are neglected god can place his hand on god does not count on things like that but god counts on people that are neglected people that don't have importance those are the people that got counted those are the people that got god count on we said yes it's true my brothers here oh we're children of uh but there was one person that had the grace of god and it was david remember that's why the same david said when the spirit of god called us later he said blessed are those in [Applause] no matter what sin you do say to your cornea [Applause] i want you this morning to understand that you are the choice is whom the lord does not impute sin the grace of god is different it was different with david and his brothers the children of david's father were all children of david's father david was also children but the grace of god was granted to them in a different way [Applause] i want you among you always have this one child that you consider the most and that you love the most parents will not tell you that among all the all of you there's always this child among everyone that's loved among everyone it's the nature that's why when he grants his grace like she liked to spank me and sometimes she respect me then i wouldn't cry anymore now she saw she thought that i became weird i remember she took my hand one day and hit it against the wall and now i i started crying because she wanted me to cry when she spanked me and i also wanted to show her that even that every that everything she was doing to spank me to make me cry we're not going to make me cry but now i want he has some he has children and he has prevail children that are privileged now it can hurt you but what i'm saying is the truth now david was the son of jesus but god said that it was a man according to his own heart god has never said this for anybody anybody else but he said for david that that was a man according to my own heart what so that god could say that david was a man according to his own heart he didn't do anything it was just the grace of god that's why i say that god gives us his grace differently for everybody yes my brothers and sisters now in the garden of god because god does his grace differently [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] so now this one god can give him a big mistake yes the great warrior david in 1955. he says paragraph 55. notice the david was called by election he was elected first because nothing was found against joseph all right david was called if you feel my number dude and brother brother says david elected first by god [Applause] exactly that's where we are that's what brother brethren says are you a david david because of david is the type of the believer david you are david and because you are a david the lord hasn't as he elected you because the bible tells us that he elected us before the foundation of the lord exists now he you're not a christian by your own desires we are christian by god's desire because he said no man come true except my father draws first what [Applause] he's baptized in with the holy ghost is from assembly in a symbol form now that you understand that you're not a christian by your desires [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] i believe that something will happen too i believe with now listen to what god says of david hey let's play god had those people that he loved in that person but david is not islam but he is the beloved the man according to god's will now listen and he said david my servants with my holy my only hoyle i have anointed him my hand my arm shall strengthen him and my arm shall strengthen him the enemy shall not surprise him and the enemy shall not shall not uh afflict him i won't beat dallas foreign is before his face and i won't beat down those that hate him my my faithfulness and mercy shall be with you and his strength shall be shall be exact i want you to understand this that's [Applause] he's not alone [Applause] yes how many times did soul traps try to hurt david met that fear there's some problem but what was the problem because he was the beloved of god he left everything he surrendered everything he was angry because of that your hatred will not do anything and you can't hurt god david there down there then he cried soul soul is trying to hurt me every time while i didn't do anything to you voila david said i will not want to hurt an anointed of god the heart of david was the heart that he needed no matter what how how david appeared to be [Applause] david was the little man but the bible told us that he had good beautiful eyes that he had a good uh appearance he was the choice because he was the man according to go to god's heart myself yes my brothers and sisters now listen to what brother says god saw the heart of david pettit preached in 1958 [Music] as i'm giving this because they're projecting it on this one so that those who can read can read along now listen to this but david showed what he was looking for not in the outside appearance but inside a man [Applause] that's what [Applause] david believer he's a type of the christian in his last days in which we're living because you are also a david god also [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] in his last days [Applause] [Applause] on earth god heard their prayers and that's why in 1909. god answered to that prayer [Applause] are you a son of god too then brother branham is the son of god too but that son is the holy ghost it is the lord jesus christ now listen when people [Applause] [Applause] he can send [Applause] brother [Applause] the the the the the um the wound was infected and brother branham says now when god spoke to him he said lord be burnt happy but [Applause] because i have david's of god this morning brother branham says he said don't consider what men have said almighty if men said they showed them miracles but the days of miracles are passed the baptism of the holy ghost doesn't exist remind remember that peter says in the day of pentecost but the promise is for you and for your children and for all those that are far off we may profess that and yes my brothers brother says god has promised that those things will happen in the last days that god with and if those things are there [Applause] god in his last days and the gift of healing was right right there for confirmation to vindicate again the new david of god and brother brown says [Applause] was manifested in the humanity can't we call jesus on the scene yes my brothers and sisters call them on the scene well the problem says [Applause] and that was so so that does the messiah and god could not let things go that way remember the same lord jesus christ remember the same mighty god so that so that that god be jesus manifest and remember he had to manifest [Applause] but he has become the prophecy it's not the prophet but he is the prophecy that's that's what's giving you the the atonement oh you die in your sins bring people to believe jesus christ remember the angel was god and told him he told him if you bring people to believe you you rolling brother [Applause] the son of god comes on earth you don't need [Applause] that's why people [Applause] she fulfilled the messiah but what happened today jesus and he says now [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] they were fulfilled in this last days i don't want you to be among those people that reject their brother brother when he was living brother branham brother brown is our prophet he's our brother because we're talking about david that received the the royal anointing and brother brothers the anointing are not emotions the anointing is the supreme power under control exactly knowing where and how uh and that's what it is now the anointing [Applause] we know that the anointing is the holy spirit [Applause] [Applause] he says i started with the first church ages that's where the holy spirit revealed it preached in 1955. [Music] there's a white wig that they used [Applause] supreme authority now brother branham says by turning the picture on the side [Applause] we see him with his black hair [Applause] and on the side of his beard wig he is the last authority he's supreme authority remember like he remember even god said so this is [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the beneficiary so that we be beneficiaries of that supreme authority because that is our lord jesus christ he is a supreme brother the supreme authorities and he came down so that we at the beneficiary that we benefit from it we benefit from that we benefit from that from that foreign he will quicken your mortal the quickening yes oh sickness is nothing there may not be one um a small part of that on her left smash on her butt circle this body your [Applause] the at all times it is here in this last days i came here to visit us so we can be alive don't fear or not a lion can come hey goliath he told you fear or not and we fear nothing when you have the supreme power and the supreme faith you need a supreme god and then he will produce a supreme result he says in the uncertain sense i don't need it too and now listen to this i want this morning because we're talking about david [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] knowing that some years later david would do this evil i want you to understand that when god talks about perfection it's maybe not in our own way of perfection it's the ways of god of profession but i believe if you were god you would have said well but i'm going to do this well brother brown says [Applause] because i wouldn't [Applause] family family would have been saying us here where you probably would have been in heaven but he had to be gone [Applause] and that we had to be human because it's gone [Music] and he's also an advocate a lawyer but we always want to be judges we take the book of judges that's what we always yes same [Applause] i didn't tell you to go take stranger's wife that's not what i'm telling you but we have to say things as they are here david speciality is [Applause] [Applause] and it's written in the scriptures impersonation of christianity here are the signs that will uh uh uh follow those who will would believe i'm in the message impersonation of christianity he says here are the signs that will follow those who would believe they will put their hands on the scene and they will be healed they was told to us to do so and the holy spirit uh um tells us it's the order that god made for those that are and the holy spirit forces us and constrained by the holy spirit that this is god's order of ministering to those who are needy and now he says what's important it says that it does not mean that the individual that is praying must be a saint or an angel what it means it means that the person that's coming must have faith you don't need to be an angel okay so god can grant us the desire of your heart you don't need to be a saint okay for god to grant you the desire of your heart your general demands all that god asked for she can come in the prayers what made the prostitute to be uh [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] this is a supreme god [Applause] any [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] i believe in my sister all your destiny give you the desire of you all the god requires that you come before yourself with a supreme voice the supreme face okay so god can grant you the desire [Applause] god it's god's battle it's not your battle i learned that not fear not basket remember in the past because he will take care of you yes my brothers and sisters all it's possible [Applause] where you can look at everything god he can give you his it's not [Music] [Music] but god put oh [Music] you all is possible everything is possible [Music]
