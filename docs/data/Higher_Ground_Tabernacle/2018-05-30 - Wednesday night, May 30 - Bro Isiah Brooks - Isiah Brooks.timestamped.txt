[24:19] man they do come every now and get on
[24:20] Sun every other Sunday night Amen it's
[24:23] wonderful when they do show by God's
[24:25] grace so we appreciate the Lord Jesus
[24:28] amen we thank you it was so amazing I
[24:32] had two experiences today one good and
[24:35] one bad how about that
[24:37] of course y'all don't know what I'm
[24:38] talking about none of y'all ever have
[24:40] bad experiences Amen but you know I like
[24:46] to tell it because you know sometimes
[24:47] Satan think he's get the best of you
[24:49] when he causes you to falter I'm
[24:52] thinking I'd say the good one to the
[24:53] last but today I had to take my card
[24:57] took my copy prior to coming here I took
[24:59] my car to the wash and I got in a little
[25:05] heated argument which I have haven't
[25:08] been angry like that in a long time if
[25:12] you know anything about my card has that
[25:13] little button that you push to start the
[25:16] car you put your foot on the brake and
[25:17] you start it with the button of course
[25:20] they've been about six times they've
[25:22] done that and they push my button all
[25:24] the way down in there so once it start I
[25:27] can't stop it you know I can't cut it
[25:29] off and I can't cut it back home so
[25:31] anyway I've had patients with them
[25:33] because the first time they did it they
[25:35] they said it was my I did it it was like
[25:37] your car has a problem and I know they
[25:41] broke it but but
[25:43] as long as he repaired it they put it
[25:44] back to a place where I could use it I
[25:46] just left it but every time they would
[25:48] do it I even instructed them and the
[25:51] times I instructed them they didn't do
[25:53] it they did it right when I figured they
[25:56] knew what they were doing that's when
[25:57] they messed it up about six times so
[26:00] today I got really upset because the guy
[26:03] blamed it on the button I said but if
[26:06] it's broken y'all did it I'm not asking
[26:09] you for no money
[26:09] I've been patience with you anyway one
[26:12] thought went to another but at the end
[26:15] of it all
[26:16] my voice was elevated so much so I
[26:21] really felt ashamed of myself that I I
[26:24] just did not show that witness for
[26:26] Christ
[26:27] you see that's what the devil does he
[26:29] allowed things like that to happen to
[26:31] make it difficult for you to witness to
[26:33] that person and that person could be
[26:35] seed so it won't be the first I
[26:38] apologize he apologized so I know this
[26:40] guy didn't have to apologize but he did
[26:43] and we got it all straight we did
[26:44] everything but hug each other but I
[26:47] still felt bad because I knew better
[26:49] when I let the enemy get to this to me
[26:51] secondly I was down at at grace lake
[26:54] this is the good part and I was walking
[26:56] and this man was behind me he says look
[27:00] at that eagle and I thought he was
[27:01] talking about in the nest here was a
[27:03] eagle following me just a little bit
[27:05] above I jumped I could have scared he
[27:07] really scared me here he comes like this
[27:11] like this walking I'm looking at him and
[27:13] then all of a sudden he went forward and
[27:14] looked me in my face like that and then
[27:17] he turned back and flew off I said whoo
[27:20] my god I don't know what that was all
[27:24] about but we're just talking about how I
[27:26] love Eagles
[27:26] well he must have felt the vibe I don't
[27:30] know how but I said Lord if that's you
[27:32] telling me you want to see me face to
[27:33] face that's okay cuz it was it was a
[27:36] little nervous movement being that close
[27:40] to an eagle and I'm thinking when the
[27:42] man said to ego anyway when I he went
[27:44] back up into the nest and he's kept
[27:46] staring at me it were facing me like I'm
[27:50] like I'm not going to look because I
[27:51] don't want you to attack me I don't know
[27:52] what you do I don't know but it was a
[27:56] blessing
[27:57] it was a blessing at after I settled
[27:58] down it's so strange I've gone there
[28:02] many times they used to be tuning this
[28:04] I'll call when I'm grooving there an
[28:05] eagle Ruby and Isaiah and I brought a
[28:08] minister there with me one time I said
[28:10] all right now y'all show off for me and
[28:12] they got a part of an S and came for I
[28:14] know y'all think I'm crazy I know the
[28:16] truth I said I said I told I told the
[28:20] past I say you know they always hear my
[28:22] voice but I was just kidding y'all just
[28:25] kidding with him but it was amazing when
[28:27] I asked him to show they show one time I
[28:31] was down there I saw the Eagle come and
[28:33] hit that water caught that fish right in
[28:35] front of me and just took it back up to
[28:36] the nest
[28:37] I don't know it was a wonderful thing
[28:39] you love the Lord and I get carried away
[28:42] maybe I'll go to the extreme of things
[28:44] but I try to balance it out I try to
[28:46] think everything is done for a purpose
[28:48] everything everything has a meaning
[28:50] nothing nothing happens by chance
[28:53] hallelujah I told you about that one
[28:56] time as a little boy I learned that
[28:58] because I bought my head I was walking I
[29:00] mean scuse me I stomped my toe and when
[29:02] I was I was walking under that tree
[29:04] house dumped my toe and I had to bend
[29:05] down and I not dump my toe I want to hit
[29:08] the branch which one would you prefer
[29:11] just missed it
[29:13] so I thank God for every action you know
[29:15] everything has a purpose as I see well
[29:18] thank you Lord for that in Jesus name
[29:20] okay we thank God for His grace and His
[29:23] mercy amen and we still thank God for
[29:26] Jared imma Kailyn amen coming and you
[29:29] know I I thought to myself I said lord I
[29:32] want to see how they doing today I don't
[29:34] want to pressure him or anything you
[29:37] know I want them to feel free to come
[29:39] and go as they choose however the Lord
[29:41] lead them it
[29:41] I really thank God for them showing up
[29:44] or coming tonight he even drove down and
[29:47] the other brother the other brother he
[29:50] must have gotten caught up I know he
[29:51] said he was going to be here brother
[29:55] Mike from Main Street but you know God
[29:57] is real God is real Amen let's get right
[30:01] to the scripture here trying to think
[30:04] where I really want to start by God's
[30:06] grace because I'm kind of working with
[30:08] the same thought the life of a warrior
[30:11] and account the cause you know we all
[30:13] have to counter cause we have to realize
[30:14] and see what it's going to be when we we
[30:19] have it so easy in our day and you know
[30:22] it's the truth because we realize by
[30:24] God's grace easy living is our worst
[30:28] enemy right it is the thing that kills
[30:30] the Christian you know it's when a
[30:34] person go through trials and tribulation
[30:36] is when you really see what's on the
[30:38] inside and so you know the Christians of
[30:41] all understood where they stood they
[30:44] were willing to sacrifice their life
[30:46] even unto death and so like I said we
[30:50] find out that that's what happened in
[30:51] Israel when God began to bless Israel
[30:53] with so many great things the Bible said
[30:56] when Jack when jess wan wet wax fat that
[30:58] was another name for Israel she begins
[31:01] to kick and God said listen when I found
[31:03] you you would still hook to your
[31:05] mother's neighbor cord you were still
[31:07] laying in your blood I cleaned you up
[31:09] and yet once I've made you what you are
[31:12] you kicked against me and that's what
[31:14] happened to Israel god bless them so
[31:17] greatly until they really miss their
[31:19] Messiah but we know by God's grace it's
[31:22] just in a little while mmm you can
[31:26] almost taste that honey right the coming
[31:29] of the Lord is sooner than what most
[31:30] people think the Bible said it'll be at
[31:33] a time when you think not Amen let's
[31:36] let's go to the scripture here let's go
[31:41] to Ephesians 6:10 2:14 Ephesians 6:10
[31:47] 2:14 the life of a warrior is a it's a
[31:52] difficult and and it's full of trials
[31:55] it's full of tests but most of all it's
[32:00] also full of victories a real warrior is
[32:05] one who had been in battle and have a
[32:07] few battle scars anybody know what I'm
[32:09] talking about
[32:10] amen you're gonna have a yeah brother be
[32:14] to a lot of battle scars but
[32:18] nevertheless you know it makes you when
[32:22] when we get over
[32:23] again to tell our story you could say
[32:25] see this one that's when that happened
[32:27] it see this so you'll be able to of
[32:30] course it won't be any scars there I'm
[32:31] just saying you know you have a
[32:33] testimony by God's grace
[32:35] finally my brother were getting at the
[32:37] tenth verse be strong in the Lord and in
[32:40] the power of his might put on the whole
[32:43] armour of God that you may be able to
[32:46] stand against the wiles of the devil
[32:48] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[32:51] blood but against principalities against
[32:54] powers against the rulers of the
[32:56] darkness of this world against spiritual
[32:59] wickedness in high places
[33:01] well 4 take unto you the whole armour of
[33:04] God that you may be able to withstand in
[33:07] the evil day and having done all to
[33:10] stand stand therefore having your loins
[33:13] Girt about with the truth and having on
[33:16] the breastplate of righteousness father
[33:20] God we come before your Lord as humbly
[33:22] as we know how and we thank you for your
[33:23] grace we thank you for your mercy we
[33:26] thank you for being so good to us we
[33:29] thank you for Malachi 4 5 & 6 Lord oh
[33:32] god were the spirit of Elijah Lord and
[33:35] how you've done so many great things for
[33:37] us through this word when we pray father
[33:40] god hallelujah that by the preaching of
[33:42] this word we will be transformed into
[33:45] your very image and likeness and father
[33:48] we'll be careful to give you the praise
[33:50] glory and honor in your Lord in your
[33:52] name Jesus Christ we pray you may be
[33:55] seated
[34:02] you know we fight this battle but had it
[34:04] not been for Jesus Christ where would we
[34:06] be for here's the true and mighty
[34:10] Conqueror he is the only one that was
[34:14] able to defeat Satan even though we've
[34:17] had great leaders like Moses Elijah
[34:21] right Joshua you know they were great
[34:25] warriors but there was one who was
[34:28] perfect and each one of these prophets
[34:31] also exemplified a portion of God like I
[34:36] said
[34:36] this whole thing is like a puzzle and
[34:39] your piece of that puzzle
[34:41] the puzzle in itself cannot be complete
[34:43] without you right so you and I
[34:47] understand that god when he created all
[34:50] things he created us and we were in him
[34:52] in other words so you cannot have
[34:54] eternal life and less eternal life was
[34:57] with you before the foundation of the
[34:58] world eternal life has no beginning and
[35:01] has no ending so how are we who are in
[35:03] time receive eternal life the thing that
[35:07] gives us eternal life is the eternal God
[35:09] because once eternal life is in this
[35:12] body in this house in this vessel this
[35:15] vessel becomes eternal you understand me
[35:18] and when we say these things are better
[35:20] we could better understand that those
[35:22] who are with God in the mind of God amen
[35:25] in other words let me say like this a
[35:27] woman cannot ever tell she'll never know
[35:30] how many children she can produce
[35:32] neither can a man right but we know by
[35:36] God's grace if that man and that woman
[35:39] got married they will have so many
[35:41] children and then stop at some point it
[35:44] stops right it is then they know how
[35:49] many children were in them that was
[35:52] needed to be manifested hallelujah but
[35:55] God is not like that God knows all of us
[35:58] he knew all he knows all of our names
[36:01] hallelujah he said Jeremiah I knew you
[36:04] before you was formed in your mother's
[36:05] womb is that right
[36:07] think about it God a man who who knows
[36:11] who we are as the Bible says he knew us
[36:16] before we were fashioned right before we
[36:20] even started in our mother's womb God
[36:21] knew us and and so if God knew us that
[36:26] means we must have been with him right
[36:29] before the foundation to learn see God
[36:33] is not like you and I will forget the
[36:35] only thing that God forgets is your sins
[36:37] once they're confessed hallelujah so we
[36:42] realized by God's grace amen that when
[36:44] God he knows the outcome like the Bible
[36:47] says he'd know our beginning from the
[36:50] end and all
[36:50] in from the beginning he saw his commie
[36:52] Souls lead and no matter how many times
[36:55] you know I don't care what kind of
[36:57] machines they produce by way of science
[36:59] when God get ready for you to die you
[37:02] can have a thousand people hold your
[37:03] hand and say please don't leave me and
[37:05] you're going to go right because life in
[37:09] itself is given by God and life in
[37:11] itself is taken by God right everything
[37:16] moving moving moving by what the power
[37:18] of God now we look at this and you say
[37:21] well what do you mean see God this is a
[37:23] whole drama and the Bible said God
[37:25] created all these things for his
[37:28] pleasure
[37:28] now we don't fully understand everything
[37:31] but think about it in our worship God is
[37:34] amused yes he is he's entertained yes he
[37:41] is hallelujah and he didn't have to do
[37:45] it God did this a man he had angels way
[37:47] before we were there in a manifestation
[37:49] form right they worship Him in other
[37:52] words he was Elohim and Elohim means
[37:55] self existing one he could not become
[37:59] God until there was something there to
[38:01] worship him so he created cherubims he
[38:04] created Sarah films he created the
[38:06] living creatures and all of that and all
[38:09] of these beings were worshiping him
[38:11] right
[38:12] the Bible says according to Isaiah the
[38:14] seraphim's cry out holy holy holy holy
[38:17] all day long
[38:19] oh you know they're feeling good amen
[38:21] they're in the presence of the Lord
[38:23] hallelujah but that's what they were
[38:25] designed for is that right but let's go
[38:28] to Genesis so you don't have to turn
[38:30] there I'm just saying in Genesis we find
[38:32] out that the Bible created Adam and we
[38:35] we went through that he created Adam
[38:37] spiritually then he phoned him out of
[38:38] there that's in the ground and he was
[38:39] Adam but there Adam looked around and he
[38:43] saw mr. and miss cow mr. and miss horse
[38:46] mister miss sheep whatever whatever the
[38:49] animals he saw - right and what did it
[38:52] do it drew a loneliness can you imagine
[38:55] I can't imagine how it would beat yes I
[38:59] could Amen a minute I can imagine by
[39:02] God's grace living in this
[39:03] mansion with all these rooms that that
[39:05] could be filled with children and
[39:07] grandchildren and everything else and
[39:08] I'm just by myself I believe I would get
[39:11] lonely hallelujah and that's the way God
[39:14] was he got lonely
[39:16] that might sound strange but he never
[39:18] said it but he said it through Adam
[39:21] because Adam was the god of the earth
[39:23] Adam could speak to the wind and say
[39:25] winds peace be still he could tell a
[39:27] tree to pluck up a man and move that's
[39:30] why I Adam was design he came on this
[39:33] earth to be the god of the earth the
[39:35] heaven father was God of heaven and Adam
[39:38] was a little God God of the earth that's
[39:40] why Adam could name all the animals
[39:43] without making a mistake he did not wake
[39:45] one mistake why he and God was one Adam
[39:49] was the very reflection of God
[39:51] hallelujah so you must understand he
[39:54] meant inside of Adam was a feminine
[39:57] spirit he was male and female y'all
[40:00] believe that let's turn to Genesis
[40:02] quickly I'm gonna get to the battle part
[40:04] in just a minute
[40:04] Genesis 5 please let the Bible speak
[40:10] here so you understand where I'm working
[40:12] so we realize that man here was Adam
[40:15] which was a reflection of God Genesis at
[40:17] the first book is the beginning of it of
[40:20] the Bible amen in Genesis the fifth
[40:24] chapter let's see how it reads this is
[40:30] the book of the generation of Adam in
[40:33] the day that God created man in the
[40:35] likeness of God made he him listen to
[40:38] this male and female created he them and
[40:42] blessed them and call not his name
[40:46] but their name Adam in the day when they
[40:49] was created so in the day that they were
[40:53] created it was male and female is that
[40:55] right and in there
[40:57] their names were Adam that means you had
[40:59] mr. Adam and mrs. Allen right so when
[41:03] God would say Adam they would say yes
[41:05] Lord they both turn right it's like if
[41:08] we had two or three people in here by
[41:10] the name of John I would say John you
[41:12] look and somebody said which one right
[41:15] Amen so we realized
[41:17] God's grace God in Adam and so what was
[41:19] Adam what was God reflecting there was a
[41:21] feminine part there was a part in the
[41:24] spirit and you said who are they that's
[41:26] us
[41:27] see we're liking us to the church we're
[41:30] like an ass to the feminine part of God
[41:32] hallelujah he's all-powerful he's
[41:35] Almighty hallelujah but we were in him
[41:39] like Adam and Eve was in Adam hallelujah
[41:44] and before the fall
[41:45] her name was Adam it was after the fall
[41:48] she gate became II God gave her a new
[41:52] name because now she was reflecting
[41:54] something different than her husband ooh
[41:59] so it's not complicated I'm saying all
[42:02] of these things because because of the
[42:05] fall of man which came by way of Eve but
[42:08] the Bible said Adam was to transgress
[42:10] her that means Adam knew better Eve was
[42:15] deceived hallelujah that's why it's so
[42:17] easy for the church to be deceived
[42:20] hallelujah but God said in this last day
[42:23] if it was possible the elected would be
[42:27] to see why because my sheep heareth my
[42:31] voice and estranged that they will not
[42:33] follow it's something about the name of
[42:36] Jesus something about hearing his voice
[42:39] you can't explain it but you know truth
[42:42] when you hear it
[42:43] is that right oh you think about it
[42:46] think about it he was the disciples Amen
[42:49] mining their business Peter them fishing
[42:51] and everything else and Jesus walked
[42:53] Owens they come follow me and the man
[42:55] quit his job and follow Jesus why
[42:59] because Jesus was his shepherd he was
[43:02] Jesus knew his sheep heard him it was in
[43:05] a different dimension hallelujah his
[43:08] voice didn't go just as a natural ear
[43:11] but his voice went to the soul and when
[43:14] the Word of God can quicken your soul to
[43:17] what is truth that is the voice of God
[43:21] hallelujah see you got to understand
[43:24] because we have two thoughts remember in
[43:27] this battle this battle started in in
[43:30] before the foundation it was Lucifer who
[43:34] raised up against God is that right
[43:36] the Bible said that God who is the holy
[43:39] ghost said you you have said in your
[43:44] heart now Lucifer had not even spoken
[43:46] when he was feeling and we don't know
[43:49] how long he worshiped God he was God's
[43:50] right-hand man he was a holy cherub
[43:53] that's why he's the master of music oh
[43:57] yeah oh yeah who can touch some of the
[44:00] voices he's God he looked like he picked
[44:04] the best of all he just hadn't found the
[44:06] church long enough there's some faucet
[44:08] that'll make some of them voices in
[44:09] Hollywood look shame be shame right I've
[44:11] heard him hallelujah but never let's go
[44:13] on we find out so that's what about was
[44:16] God's will versus Lucifer will that's
[44:19] your battle right now every day battle
[44:21] are you battling whether I should do
[44:23] God's will or the devil's will right
[44:26] thanks to Lucifer you have that that you
[44:30] have to fight with hallelujah and in his
[44:33] life we don't know how oh he preached
[44:35] that lie but the Bible said are
[44:37] thoroughly angels I read it today the
[44:39] third of the angels followed Lucifer and
[44:42] guess what we called them demons right
[44:45] you see these demons could not get into
[44:48] the human race as long as they stayed on
[44:50] the word but when the serpent beguiled
[44:55] Eve it brought in a way where the devil
[44:59] could enter into manhood
[45:00] mankind right so now because of him you
[45:04] part partly in the image of God and
[45:07] partly in the image of the devil y'all
[45:09] have seen those cartoons right God on
[45:12] the right hand and the devil on the left
[45:14] that's inspired I think right because
[45:18] Paul said whenever I'm trying to do good
[45:19] evil is always there present so now
[45:24] we're battling I'm working with
[45:25] something here because I want you to
[45:26] understand that this battle this thing
[45:28] that we live in Christians are called to
[45:31] war is that right
[45:34] Christians are called a walk we didn't
[45:37] come to have a great picnic even though
[45:40] God give us joy he give us peace he give
[45:43] us
[45:44] explain it he'd give us joy unspeakable
[45:46] like I was tell us about the other day I
[45:48] said when I'm in a church setting or
[45:50] when I'm talking about Jesus of God I'm
[45:53] excited you know what I tell you what
[45:56] brother brother Jared I almost got I
[45:59] almost got out of hand
[46:01] last night they were at the graduation
[46:03] Christopher graduated last night we
[46:05] didn't find out to the last minute but
[46:08] we're gonna have a thing for him at the
[46:09] house my wife is gonna organize
[46:10] something but they saying that Battle
[46:13] Hymn a republic oh my god I want to
[46:17] shake everybody here oh they were
[46:25] profession based on that thing and if I
[46:27] could identify everyone um I will shoot
[46:30] everyone I'm hand and even the director
[46:32] saying oh my god I was sitting back
[46:34] there I was I was tearing up I'm like
[46:36] Lord don't let me cry I was best
[46:40] I was so and another thing I was reading
[46:43] where I was so blessed because I didn't
[46:45] know that schools were still allowed to
[46:48] say anything about God I said Lord
[46:51] blessed us ankeny school that's how good
[46:56] it was to me it was so good even my wife
[46:58] came out talking about it and and
[47:01] crystal said I can't get over it was
[47:02] just so professional so yeah it touched
[47:06] me I tell you what yeah that was the
[47:09] best graduation service I've ever gone
[47:11] to seriously even all the three speakers
[47:14] everyone um has something to say it was
[47:17] short and sweet it was wonderful
[47:20] nothing boring about it at all I'll tell
[47:24] you what I wish everybody would have
[47:25] been able to experience that but anyhow
[47:27] you look at these things and I thought
[47:29] Lord God somebody you got and eat those
[47:32] kids I don't know who all were there but
[47:34] some of those kids sang that song from
[47:39] the heart because only what comes from
[47:42] the heart touches the heart it
[47:44] encouraged my soul so much so we
[47:47] realized by God's grace that when God in
[47:49] this battle because we can't see and God
[47:52] can see the future
[47:52] you didn't know that that's what
[47:54] prophets are prophets are seers that
[47:58] in whom God ordained to be able to see
[48:00] into the future
[48:01] for example Noah nor was a mighty
[48:06] warrior is that right he was he was a
[48:09] mighty warrior and you know this thing
[48:11] about it is people don't believe that
[48:13] God still have them but they still
[48:14] available God still use me and God still
[48:17] have prophet gods have prophetess God
[48:20] have preachers God have teachers God
[48:22] still have his army and we find out by
[48:26] God he's the same yesterday today in
[48:28] Vera
[48:28] Hebrews 13 and 8 said Jesus Christ is
[48:31] the same yesterday today and forever
[48:33] whatever God did for Israel he must do
[48:36] it for us but in a greater measure right
[48:40] see because people don't understand
[48:42] people look at Israel and Israel is she
[48:45] is she is wonderful but Israel is the
[48:47] servants of the Lord they are called
[48:50] what we call the temple guards right
[48:52] they are the tribal people that
[48:54] protected the king in the Queen oh it's
[48:58] the truth is the truth see they said you
[49:01] had 12 tribes here 12 12 12 lion lamb ox
[49:07] eagle you had all four those tribes
[49:10] under those banners so when they go out
[49:12] the water trot the trouble go you know
[49:15] that's bad for trumping but the truth of
[49:17] the matter is the trumpets sounded and
[49:19] one tribe Dan would run out right at
[49:21] ravenous will run out a man then hot the
[49:24] wild if we got Ian kids all for them but
[49:26] they're there up there they were
[49:28] obligated to keep the Ark of the
[49:33] Covenant safe and that Ark of the
[49:36] Covenant represented God Almighty
[49:40] hallelujah oh come on somebody I'm
[49:43] getting a little excited because you and
[49:45] I must understand that also that
[49:46] represented who the bride because that's
[49:49] where the blood was placed on the mercy
[49:53] seat and those angels that Alpha and
[49:56] Omega set right there protecting what we
[50:01] call the hole in the Holies of Holies
[50:03] the bride of Jesus Christ so let's go on
[50:07] because remember that even in in the
[50:09] garden you had two trees you had a god
[50:11] and a tree of knowledge
[50:12] of good and evil that's what we happen
[50:13] to happening now in other words Satan
[50:15] Trey uh Adam trade in the Tree of Life
[50:19] for the tree of knowledge of good and
[50:21] evil reason being the devil and I'm
[50:26] going here because this is the warfare
[50:28] the devil Towey I will make you a god
[50:35] has he done it in the last day we have
[50:40] seen women and I say this in a
[50:43] respectful way they are so beautiful
[50:49] they come out beautiful yeah yet note
[50:53] the truth there were times when babies
[50:55] would be born ugly now they come out
[50:58] beautiful beautiful hair beautiful
[51:00] collection yeah and then they grow up
[51:02] right and now women are worship now
[51:07] don't I'm not a chauvinist I'm just
[51:10] saying it is reality if you're gonna
[51:12] sell a truck you're gonna use a woman if
[51:14] you go sell a boat you're gonna use a
[51:16] woman if whatever you go at you you're
[51:18] gonna use a woman right if you're gonna
[51:22] even a song you what you're gonna have
[51:25] you're gonna have a woman what you call
[51:28] your trunk that's right you ain't gonna
[51:31] call him Adam it's just she's workshop
[51:37] in America a few years ago to establish
[51:41] the fact that a god of America is the
[51:45] woman when you come into New York who's
[51:49] standing there with her miss statue
[51:51] right he promised it
[51:53] he did it he is the god of this age
[51:56] that's why people worshipping zombies
[51:58] and worshipping vampires at work what is
[52:01] it people you are in a battle you are in
[52:05] a war and most people don't even know
[52:07] there are in a war they think all of
[52:10] these things are common but understand
[52:12] Satan like you see the television okay
[52:14] i'ma go to this because now you're
[52:16] dealing with dimensional things right
[52:18] you can't see these pictures that's
[52:20] flowing through here but they are if I
[52:23] had a television all I had to do is
[52:24] click it on and you
[52:25] see it right there television is a thing
[52:27] of eternity
[52:29] you understand me is able to tap go
[52:31] beyond time and bringing it to now right
[52:36] it could go all the way into England
[52:38] which is on a different time zone and
[52:40] bring it to you and says now this is lie
[52:43] it's daytime there and nighttime here
[52:47] see that's what television does it is a
[52:51] dimensional thing that could catch the
[52:53] unseen and bring it to the scene am I
[52:57] making sense but all of these things are
[52:59] used for battle because understand Satan
[53:03] could not move as fast as he wanted to
[53:06] with just a telegram or what's that
[53:10] Kaaba code they used to do yeah he
[53:14] couldn't do it fast enough so science
[53:16] invented us an instrument where it could
[53:19] use now watch this now because that same
[53:21] instrument could be used in a mighty way
[53:24] for the gospel but you see everything
[53:27] had to cover the whole world in a short
[53:29] period of time right after World War two
[53:32] everything exploded Amen it got so bad
[53:35] two peoples they were all there must be
[53:36] Martians there were no Martian
[53:39] ain't no space aliens if there is any
[53:44] alien you are the ones cuz you came from
[53:47] a different world he came from God let
[53:51] me move on I'm saying all these things
[53:53] because we don't understand the
[53:55] inspiration about about all these things
[53:57] be stained and like I said it's good and
[53:59] evil there are things you can see on TV
[54:01] that's good and things that are evil
[54:03] everything is good and evil right school
[54:06] is evil but then school could be excuse
[54:09] me school is good but school can also be
[54:12] evil huh because too much intelligence
[54:15] will take you away from the fact that
[54:17] there is a God we're living in Laodicea
[54:21] right nothing wrong with getting your
[54:24] doctoral degree you can get as many as
[54:25] you want as long as you still believe
[54:27] there's a god but the truth of the
[54:30] matter is it's difficult to witness to
[54:31] people because now you've got to
[54:33] convince them that there is a god
[54:38] there's nothing
[54:39] new Under the Sun even even even Solomon
[54:43] said there's nothing new Under Sun what
[54:46] was yesterday is now what is now will be
[54:48] tomorrow that's what he says nothing new
[54:54] you know we think we so intelligent in
[54:56] this age we do but before we admit that
[55:01] the Bible is right we would give the
[55:03] credit to some alien force some alien
[55:08] force came down and built the pyramid
[55:12] hallelujah some alien force came down
[55:14] and built the Sphinx
[55:15] huh well who would have known I'm gonna
[55:19] tell you who knew God the same God that
[55:23] told nor to build a boat he built it and
[55:26] he survived and he and his family what
[55:30] did they say do you understand those
[55:33] tidal waves that was coming in Noah's
[55:35] day was probably taller than the
[55:37] mountains that that he sat down on when
[55:41] that map that they rolled back in all
[55:43] the animals deep freeze dry freeze
[55:46] whatever you want to call it they found
[55:48] the mamak up in in in Atlanta Alaska
[55:51] with food in its mouth still scientists
[55:54] know things they're not telling you
[55:55] folks because if they tell you the truth
[55:59] there then you would have to come to the
[56:00] conclusion like Einstein there's a God
[56:04] so anyway let's move on because that is
[56:07] the devil the devil don't here here you
[56:10] know it's so funny about him he he makes
[56:12] people believe that there is no God but
[56:15] the Bible said the devil believes and he
[56:16] trembles huh
[56:20] and to me you know you got people and I
[56:22] don't know why I'm on this thing because
[56:23] mine I'm not into my nose but my thing
[56:26] is this you know I think it's difficult
[56:27] don't you think it's difficult more
[56:29] difficult to believe in evolution and it
[56:31] does the Bible the Bible is so much
[56:34] easier I cannot believe that I evolved
[56:38] from some tadpole and think
[56:44] because if we still evolve and look what
[56:46] it's turning into science is limited if
[56:54] you put science above God then you make
[56:57] science God and then you can find out
[57:01] through history science always lie and
[57:03] they always have to correct when they
[57:06] started with the first automobile this
[57:08] there's no way of making riding that
[57:09] automobile and live 30 miles 40 miles an
[57:12] hour he'll die now you try to tell them
[57:16] who it what I'm trying to say is that
[57:21] science experiments trying to learn
[57:23] things when God has already told us
[57:28] hallelujah you love the Lord science has
[57:32] his place but when it's contradicts the
[57:34] Bible it's wrong because science says
[57:40] once a man is dead he's dead
[57:41] but Jesus got up out of the grave he
[57:46] lives how you know he lives in me
[57:51] science said leprosy can't be healed but
[57:54] how many lepers did Jesus heal how many
[57:57] lepers are being healed today still
[57:59] doing it I'm just a believer but but
[58:05] that's the battle that's the battle
[58:07] between good and evil right good and
[58:10] evil because you got to realize by God's
[58:13] grace amen that's the tree we eat all
[58:15] offer think about it so I'm a glooming
[58:18] home to my next thought this food we eat
[58:20] is the same food we ever ate then why
[58:23] are we getting older when we was evening
[58:27] when were younger oh my we were growing
[58:29] up being strong but after a while the
[58:31] same food we eating we're dying from it
[58:35] why cuz God told Adam I need the data to
[58:39] eat of this tree you should surely die
[58:43] so we're battling we're battling good
[58:46] from evil and most of the time the
[58:48] people that stand with God you look
[58:49] crazy you look odd you know you know
[58:52] he's the strange he's off somewhere yeah
[58:55] but it's okay because you know we are
[58:57] people we just oddballs because we
[59:00] really believe that this Bible is true
[59:02] is that right explain this to me this is
[59:05] a battle now think about it when you're
[59:06] a Christian and you like the Hebrew boys
[59:09] right you're the Hebrew boys and this
[59:12] dis man said listen if you don't
[59:14] denounce your god I'm gonna throw you
[59:17] into the fiery furnace hallelujah and
[59:21] the Bible tells us that these Hebrew
[59:24] boys Amen I like to call them in but the
[59:27] Bible said they're boys so that's what
[59:28] they are now we realize Amen that they
[59:31] stood there and they prayed and didn't
[59:35] get an answer
[59:36] Bobby doesn't say they even got an
[59:37] answer from God but they did say in
[59:40] other words throw me into the fire if my
[59:43] God doesn't answer my prayer I know he's
[59:46] still God and for me rather before I
[59:52] ever bow to you before I ever denounced
[59:55] my god throw me into the fire I love
[59:59] that see because I want you to
[1:00:01] understand God is the all-seeing one he
[1:00:05] sees everything every move you make
[1:00:08] every thought you think God is in
[1:00:10] control of it all I don't know how he
[1:00:12] does it but he is but I do know one
[1:00:15] thing God must have heard the
[1:00:17] conversation in heaven
[1:00:20] hallelujah and the Bible tells me that
[1:00:25] God Himself came and stood in the fire
[1:00:29] with them talk to them
[1:00:33] the King looked in that furnace of fires
[1:00:35] that I thought we put in 3o but boy I
[1:00:40] see four and he get he goes on and said
[1:00:43] the one must be the son of God see
[1:00:48] he's a heathen he didn't understand who
[1:00:50] it was but it was God in the fire
[1:00:52] because God is a fire and he is a
[1:00:55] consuming fire hallelujah whoo
[1:01:01] scientists are so smart they can't even
[1:01:03] explain what electricity is they really
[1:01:06] don't even know what fire is they don't
[1:01:08] know what it makes that make makes it
[1:01:09] live and they can say whatever they want
[1:01:11] say they know how to make it happen but
[1:01:13] they don't know why it happens
[1:01:17] hallelujah but God does he knows because
[1:01:20] he created it all right so let's go I'm
[1:01:24] talking about this is a war it's a
[1:01:26] battle we're living in the most
[1:01:27] scientific age there is hallelujah for
[1:01:31] the rich should be dead he had what they
[1:01:34] call the Widowmaker almost all his
[1:01:38] arteries closed and God sent the doctor
[1:01:41] and don't get me wrong I'm not against
[1:01:42] medicine but God could have just touched
[1:01:45] him and healed him but God sent a doctor
[1:01:47] in there did his science I walked in and
[1:01:51] said oh my god is that what you're
[1:01:52] supposed to look like
[1:01:54] he looked 20 years younger
[1:01:56] hallelujah what about our brother
[1:01:59] Stamper his two heart attacks struck him
[1:02:02] so hard in front part of his heart was
[1:02:03] dead what wasn't functioning do I have a
[1:02:06] right brother absolutely look at him now
[1:02:09] look at sister Alana what God has done
[1:02:11] to her hallelujah
[1:02:13] she didn't know what was going on in the
[1:02:15] end drawing up just nobody was telling
[1:02:17] her but she was shrinking in size God
[1:02:20] comes along and healer he's the same
[1:02:25] yesterday today and forever he's a God
[1:02:27] that changed not I don't care what the
[1:02:29] churches have said you've got all these
[1:02:31] big mega churches and all they know
[1:02:32] about is dancing and shouting and
[1:02:34] speaking in tongues and running down now
[1:02:36] whatever they do it's alright but we
[1:02:39] want the real God ain't no use of me
[1:02:41] trying to serve God he ain't real
[1:02:43] I need a God that's gonna show himself
[1:02:51] that's what you know what I didn't I
[1:02:53] didn't believe how much have much with
[1:02:55] Christianity one time but my mother was
[1:02:57] stricken with cancer and she's pray she
[1:02:59] lived for 12 years because she asked God
[1:03:01] to let her live - my sister and I became
[1:03:04] of age where we could take care of
[1:03:05] ourselves but before my mom died my mom
[1:03:09] was stricken with liver cancer of the
[1:03:11] liver she refused to have a liver
[1:03:13] transplant and I shot my mom John does
[1:03:17] complete jaundice and she was still I
[1:03:20] mean just a moment from she hadn't been
[1:03:22] living but I heard my mama say Lord just
[1:03:25] let me go
[1:03:25] one more time y'all got to understand
[1:03:29] she said to my sister help me get up my
[1:03:33] sister helped her get up and she slowly
[1:03:34] moved to the restaurant and she had a
[1:03:36] bowel excuse me but that's what she did
[1:03:37] right and she felt so happy since then
[1:03:41] everything to me as a child that was a
[1:03:43] miracle I saw a woman that was just rest
[1:03:48] away from death yet she asked God I
[1:03:50] heard her with my oh my that was my
[1:03:52] miracle that made me know God was real
[1:03:55] and I said Lord if I ever come to serve
[1:03:57] you I want to serve the God my mama sir
[1:04:00] the one that's still the same the one
[1:04:02] that manifests itself I wish my wife was
[1:04:06] here so she can witness to me I was
[1:04:08] coming down we was coming from Chicago
[1:04:09] well not from Chicago pastor in Chicago
[1:04:11] and if the traffic was really bad and I
[1:04:14] didn't know which way to turn I'm trying
[1:04:15] to gather my my bearings and my wife
[1:04:18] said turn here and then I've moved her
[1:04:19] way oh my god wrong way to this day we
[1:04:23] don't know how we got out of that
[1:04:25] honestly if I told you what I thought
[1:04:27] you'd think I'm in crazy I'm saying and
[1:04:29] saying but there was no way we should
[1:04:31] have gotten out of that accident alive
[1:04:34] three cars was headed us in editors in
[1:04:37] different directions there was no way
[1:04:39] out and I still we we rolled four miles
[1:04:44] before we said anything to each other
[1:04:47] because we were just that shocked and
[1:04:49] that's time we did do one thing we said
[1:04:52] Jesus you know my if you ever hurt my
[1:04:57] wife she could call it and he comes to
[1:04:59] you know so amazing how God can do that
[1:05:03] but that's a battle you say a battle you
[1:05:05] think to yourself well why did God even
[1:05:07] allowed that he allowed that to increase
[1:05:09] my faith mmm God allows it because
[1:05:15] listen how would you know that God could
[1:05:18] answer your prayer if you never go
[1:05:20] through something where he could answer
[1:05:21] your prayer he has to allow Satan to put
[1:05:26] things in your way
[1:05:28] so that you will know that he's alive
[1:05:30] and well
[1:05:35] hmm the Bible tells us in isaiah 54:17
[1:05:39] no weapons that is formed against thee
[1:05:42] shall prosper hmm
[1:05:46] let's the truth I could tell you years
[1:05:49] ago
[1:05:50] I was working for Ramadi in al I was
[1:05:52] told on me my manager who was the owner
[1:05:55] of the building believed the lie he came
[1:05:58] to me and he cursed me out knowing I was
[1:06:01] a Christian he literally wore me out and
[1:06:04] I'm begging him to try to get him to
[1:06:06] listen to what I what the truth of it is
[1:06:08] he didn't even want to hear the truth he
[1:06:11] carried on so bad I really was hurt
[1:06:13] because I loved him
[1:06:14] this man gave me my basically he came to
[1:06:18] the hotel and he saw my little jalopy my
[1:06:20] little piece of car he said that's mine
[1:06:24] he said oh no no no no you can't park
[1:06:26] that in front of my hotel he said how
[1:06:31] much you make it
[1:06:32] and I told he's oh no no no no we're
[1:06:34] gonna have to give you law so you could
[1:06:36] get you a better car that man gave me
[1:06:38] such a raise I got a car and my first
[1:06:40] house I'm telling you I'm telling you
[1:06:44] but that man suffered few months later
[1:06:48] he fell off of his tractor with a stroke
[1:06:50] he lost his hotel and he died but I was
[1:06:56] young I didn't know to pray for him I
[1:06:58] didn't know to pray for him because the
[1:07:01] Bible says it is better for you to tire
[1:07:03] millstone around your neck catch
[1:07:05] yourself into the sea than to fin the
[1:07:08] least of these I prayed for the young
[1:07:13] man that we we had an argument today and
[1:07:15] I said Lord it wasn't his fault it was
[1:07:17] mine
[1:07:21] y'all I'm telling you this is the truth
[1:07:24] there's a sister I told this testimony I
[1:07:27] feel like doing it before I go anymore
[1:07:29] went further with this remember the
[1:07:31] sister I told you about in South America
[1:07:34] in Georgetown she had been married six
[1:07:38] times I think it was six or seven to
[1:07:40] each a different man she had a child
[1:07:43] from each one of those men but this last
[1:07:45] man was a beater he beat her a lot
[1:07:48] and he'll remember what grandma said she
[1:07:52] came to our church folks and she wanted
[1:07:55] to be saved this lady was so worldly she
[1:07:58] didn't know how to talk in church he she
[1:08:00] is testifying and cursing at the same we
[1:08:04] let her go because that's that was her
[1:08:06] language she didn't know no better I was
[1:08:09] glad they didn't stop her and one of the
[1:08:12] brothers said well who gonna baptize her
[1:08:13] because she's been there I said yeah you
[1:08:17] remember the toy inventor I was with us
[1:08:20] and me and Ron took pleasure in
[1:08:22] baptizing that later
[1:08:23] Danette when we got there to the house I
[1:08:25] think a couple of days later she was
[1:08:27] there waiting worshiping God giving the
[1:08:29] tithing and everything else and she's
[1:08:31] still example they shook their village a
[1:08:34] man but she was at the marketplace later
[1:08:37] and somehow this man was a wicked man he
[1:08:40] literally threw her while they would cuz
[1:08:42] in Guyana this portion of Diana you have
[1:08:44] to travel by boat you know because it's
[1:08:47] so much water and she's traveling by
[1:08:48] boat with this water and this man and
[1:08:51] he's trying to kill both of them
[1:08:53] so he throws the baby overboard and she
[1:08:56] has to jump out to save the baby I don't
[1:08:58] know how she got back in the boat how
[1:09:00] salvation I don't know but I do know one
[1:09:04] thing she had been praying and this is
[1:09:06] the testimony I didn't hear her say this
[1:09:08] but the pastor told me she had been
[1:09:09] praying Lord I know I made a lot of
[1:09:11] mistakes but deliver me from this man
[1:09:13] please deliver me she was really crying
[1:09:16] out to the Lord because she wanted to be
[1:09:17] a free woman so this man meets her at
[1:09:21] the in the marketplace and he fainted
[1:09:23] beto and I don't know what her prayer
[1:09:25] was I really don't but this man he got
[1:09:28] so frustrated he said I just wish I was
[1:09:32] dead fell dead right there in the
[1:09:37] marketplace and the people thought she
[1:09:39] was doing some kind of witchcraft no he
[1:09:41] cursed himself God had his number is
[1:09:46] that Alright touch not my anointed and
[1:09:48] do my prophet no harm
[1:09:50] that's the Word of God you say God do
[1:09:53] things like that yes even when I was in
[1:09:55] denomination it happened one of those
[1:09:57] old faithful sisters her husband was a
[1:09:59] beater he come home all drunk and ready
[1:10:01] to beat her
[1:10:02] amen but this time he went across the
[1:10:04] line he went up Amen to strike her he
[1:10:07] was struck with a stroke a stroke guess
[1:10:10] what she had to roll him around in a
[1:10:12] wheelchair until he died who loved him
[1:10:15] he loved him she took care of him I
[1:10:20] never I saw the man I knew him I didn't
[1:10:23] know him but I'd say I met her husband
[1:10:25] garlic sister loving the Lord why are
[1:10:29] you saying these things he because the
[1:10:32] Bible says no weapon formed against you
[1:10:34] shall prosper
[1:10:38] is that right every tongue that shall
[1:10:42] rise against the in judgment thou shalt
[1:10:44] condemn this is the heritage of the
[1:10:48] service of the Lord and their
[1:10:50] righteousness is of me sayeth the Lord
[1:10:53] hello it's not all brother blue
[1:10:55] superdude isthat the other no I bear his
[1:10:58] righteousness he became my sin that's
[1:11:01] the beauty of the cross he became my sin
[1:11:03] that I might become his righteousness
[1:11:05] you should have all you make mistakes
[1:11:06] but I'm his righteousness he has
[1:11:09] declared that that's how I get to heaven
[1:11:11] not by my works in my deeds I get there
[1:11:15] because of his grace at his mercy
[1:11:16] because he declared me righteous is this
[1:11:23] okay do I have a little bit more time
[1:11:25] Alleluia so we looking at this thing he
[1:11:28] said oh this God tries too hard I'm
[1:11:30] gonna tell you something every one of us
[1:11:31] are dead ordained amen you'll be a being
[1:11:38] here's ordained a few months ago you
[1:11:42] never thought you'd be here right
[1:11:44] some of us years ago I didn't know do
[1:11:47] you really think living in South
[1:11:49] Carolina I would come to Iowa no way
[1:11:54] Jose absolutely not
[1:11:57] I hate cold weather hallelujah and you
[1:12:01] know this miss Iowa can be bad this time
[1:12:04] she didn't want to let us go she she she
[1:12:07] kept her who went to kept holding us a
[1:12:09] man who rich was pleading with Allah let
[1:12:12] us go let this free come in then she
[1:12:15] jumps from Springs
[1:12:16] summer but my point is is this God
[1:12:22] brought me here
[1:12:23] I'm glad I wouldn't have never known you
[1:12:25] our paths would have never crossed
[1:12:31] people call me crazy me and you leaving
[1:12:34] this big Church to go over there ain't
[1:12:35] up about 13 people that how'd it go take
[1:12:38] care you gonna be taking care that's a
[1:12:40] god gonna take care of me if he called
[1:12:43] me to do anything he's his obligation
[1:12:46] hallelujah now think about this God how
[1:12:50] he God never gives up on us in spite of
[1:12:53] all our failures hallelujah God knew you
[1:12:57] was gonna fail him before he saved you
[1:13:00] hallelujah
[1:13:02] let me tell you something it doesn't
[1:13:03] make any difference how bad my children
[1:13:05] are they're mine and I had to learn to
[1:13:09] love them unconditionally
[1:13:11] why because I wanted to love my children
[1:13:13] as God loves me hallelujah no matter how
[1:13:18] bad they are they're mine and I do
[1:13:22] whatever I can do to help them my flesh
[1:13:25] might not won't be some time to do it
[1:13:27] but I love them and I have to remind
[1:13:30] myself it could have been me alright so
[1:13:34] you look at these things and you said
[1:13:35] well what do you mean think about it
[1:13:36] Samson God raised him up right y'all
[1:13:39] have heard the story of Samson Samson
[1:13:41] was raised up unless judges seven you
[1:13:44] can't look that up he wrote ooh but he
[1:13:46] was oh I'm sorry that's Gideon I'm
[1:13:49] working with Samson any men but let's go
[1:13:52] back to Gideon y'all remember Gideon
[1:13:53] Gideon a man was fighting but for his
[1:13:56] rights a man and we realized by God's
[1:13:59] grace amen that that Gideon see God want
[1:14:02] you to understand he you don't need
[1:14:03] everybody if Bobby even said we're two
[1:14:07] or three are gathered there I'm in a
[1:14:09] mess
[1:14:10] that means I don't have to feel him I
[1:14:12] don't even have to see him cuz he
[1:14:15] promised that he'd be there that means
[1:14:17] he's there God keeps all of his
[1:14:20] appointments right it's good to feel him
[1:14:24] and though saying but even when I don't
[1:14:27] feel him
[1:14:30] he's there and I know by God's grace
[1:14:34] Amen that here was Gideon Gideon God
[1:14:37] said Oh Lord if you be God let me do
[1:14:39] this God did it put the free snip mmm
[1:14:41] Flynn sees that everything got Gideon
[1:14:44] asked for God did it he still wanted to
[1:14:46] make getting a believer because he knew
[1:14:49] that in his heart he really was a
[1:14:50] believer but Gideon like that his own
[1:14:53] stuff and that's how some believers are
[1:14:55] they like they feel it
[1:14:57] is that right I feel it was Thomas was
[1:14:59] the same way
[1:15:00] Thomas said I ain't gonna believe that
[1:15:02] Jesus was raised from the dead unless I
[1:15:04] see him with my eyes and I can thrust my
[1:15:06] hand into his room then I will become a
[1:15:09] believer Jesus walked through the walls
[1:15:11] and said Thomas
[1:15:14] hallelujah see what people don't
[1:15:16] understand oh my god is that God is not
[1:15:20] so far away he's closer to us than we
[1:15:22] realized
[1:15:23] and people say I was in I was in I was
[1:15:25] in the University of South Carolina in
[1:15:27] my in my composition class and this
[1:15:30] professor start talking about Jesus he's
[1:15:32] now if you're gonna talk about him talk
[1:15:33] good because if you don't I'm coming up
[1:15:35] and that's what happened he's trying to
[1:15:37] tell the people that Jesus I stood up I
[1:15:40] was rude cuz though I was I wasn't
[1:15:42] mature at that time see I challenged him
[1:15:46] in his own class which could have meant
[1:15:48] some bad stuff but he admired me after I
[1:15:51] did that because now I wasn't speaking
[1:15:53] on my own it was God spoke to me I said
[1:15:56] I said well how can you say that God
[1:15:57] doesn't exist that Jesus don't you know
[1:15:59] I said that's like telling Christopher
[1:16:02] Columbus that America is not here it
[1:16:04] doesn't exist
[1:16:05] there's no new land I said you gotta
[1:16:07] understand faith is the substance of
[1:16:09] things hoped for the evidence of things
[1:16:10] not seen something in you tells you that
[1:16:13] this thing exists whether you see it or
[1:16:15] not he what about the man who our
[1:16:18] Benjamin Franklin some about something
[1:16:21] told him that that electricity that
[1:16:23] lightning could be harnessed hallelujah
[1:16:25] thank God for Benjamin Franklin he had a
[1:16:28] vision he had an understanding that
[1:16:29] there was some things that he could not
[1:16:31] see but he knew it existed and he went
[1:16:33] for it Christopher Columbus and all we
[1:16:36] wouldn't even be in America because
[1:16:38] people said the earth was flat you're
[1:16:40] gonna fall off of it but there was a man
[1:16:43] who had a
[1:16:44] greater vision why because America had
[1:16:46] to be discovered because she's in the in
[1:16:48] the scripture hallelujah
[1:16:51] yeah revelation 13 America is there
[1:16:55] hallelujah where do you think the woman
[1:16:57] ran into the wilderness this is America
[1:17:00] where she was safe from the dragon this
[1:17:02] is America we were born white on freedom
[1:17:05] of religion because the old world was
[1:17:08] persecuting all Christians that was not
[1:17:13] of their organization come on yes to
[1:17:14] truth so we realized by God's grace all
[1:17:17] of this thing happened and people who
[1:17:19] are America ain't in the Bible then the
[1:17:21] Bible is not made whole there's no such
[1:17:24] thing as something popping up and it's
[1:17:26] not already in there let me go on by
[1:17:28] God's grace so what Gideon said God said
[1:17:30] listen you got 3,000 you gotta cut it
[1:17:32] back it's too many too many soldiers
[1:17:35] right and so here Gideon said God said
[1:17:38] I'm gonna tell you listen I love about
[1:17:40] it God hand-picked the people God knew
[1:17:44] who was ready and God knew knows when
[1:17:46] you're ready right and god said the
[1:17:50] people that goes down and don't even
[1:17:52] look up just slapping like a dog down in
[1:17:55] there he said I don't want them he said
[1:17:57] but that man they laughs up like this
[1:18:00] he's ready he's ready for war right the
[1:18:04] other ones just let him go on back home
[1:18:06] all right
[1:18:08] see that was God's dealing and then God
[1:18:11] told Gideon just how to fight the battle
[1:18:14] don't you understand if God told Gideon
[1:18:17] how to fight the battle God will also
[1:18:18] tell you how to fight it right he is the
[1:18:22] captain the orders come from him you got
[1:18:24] trouble on your job you gotta ask God
[1:18:26] how do I fight this battle no matter
[1:18:30] what and sometimes God said I'm gonna
[1:18:32] walk you through Jericho hallelujah amen
[1:18:35] because that's what he did in Jericho
[1:18:37] right he told Joshua he said Joshua I'm
[1:18:40] taking you over here and now the wall
[1:18:43] city is all walled up didn't heard about
[1:18:45] what you've done down there in Egypt how
[1:18:47] did you you defeated Pharaoh forty years
[1:18:50] later forty years ago they still talk
[1:18:53] about how these group of Israelites
[1:18:56] defeated Egypt
[1:18:58] for years we don't even know how to old
[1:19:02] rehab work when it all happened but
[1:19:04] however she told she was told she
[1:19:06] believed the report right so she goes
[1:19:11] down in there amen and God says listen I
[1:19:15] want you to march around Jericho and
[1:19:17] Jericho was a pretty good city right
[1:19:19] it's all like like launched around
[1:19:21] Ankeny however but my point is you had
[1:19:24] to march around neck that city wall and
[1:19:27] you had to keep your mouth shut
[1:19:29] sometimes when you are in battle God
[1:19:31] don't want you to say one word why
[1:19:34] because your mouth will tell the enemy
[1:19:36] where you are right don't say a thing
[1:19:40] March around the wall he also ain't none
[1:19:43] to it yes it was to all them children
[1:19:46] and whatever else they had they had to
[1:19:48] say don't see nothing have you ever
[1:19:50] tried to keep a kid quiet it's difficult
[1:19:54] amen so we realized by God's grace they
[1:19:57] march around this wall one the this city
[1:20:00] and listen this city wall was so big you
[1:20:03] can race chariots on it so what not no
[1:20:07] look thin-walled like that it was so big
[1:20:08] you could build houses that's where
[1:20:10] Rahab house was built on the wall March
[1:20:16] around it seven times and alone on the
[1:20:18] seventh day March around seven times so
[1:20:22] they had to do all this and he said now
[1:20:24] listen when I'm ready for you
[1:20:25] I have already delivered this city into
[1:20:27] your hands this is what I like a lot of
[1:20:30] time we fighting about and we don't
[1:20:31] understand that God has already
[1:20:32] delivered it he's already answered it
[1:20:35] for you but you because you are in time
[1:20:37] you got to come to that time right and
[1:20:40] so you said oh my goodness Lord and he
[1:20:43] said but what when it when I'm ready for
[1:20:45] you to shout I want you to blow his horn
[1:20:46] I'm gonna need all y'all shout I want
[1:20:49] you to shout the name of the Lord
[1:20:50] however he said it in me but I want you
[1:20:52] to understand when you do this I'll
[1:20:54] bring those walls down oh if I could
[1:21:00] have only been there to see that
[1:21:02] Amen because you can imagine what those
[1:21:05] people in Jericho what are those holy
[1:21:07] rollers doing now what are those silly
[1:21:09] people doing now
[1:21:11] we don't even see that god that was the
[1:21:13] problem with Egypt they had so many gods
[1:21:15] they had to see and here was it was
[1:21:17] Moses God you couldn't see but what they
[1:21:20] didn't understand that Moses God was
[1:21:22] right in pharaoh's face because the god
[1:21:24] of Moses was in him hallelujah the fire
[1:21:28] that was in the bush and I was in the
[1:21:30] man that's the mystery of it all oh let
[1:21:37] me hurry up folks you know the thing I
[1:21:41] love it about because God said I'll
[1:21:43] never leave you nor forsake you and I
[1:21:46] think I testify to that one day I was in
[1:21:48] my kitchen and I heard the Lord say that
[1:21:50] to me and I just jumped and I began I
[1:21:53] wept and praise the Lord like you
[1:21:55] wouldn't know I was just me and nobody
[1:21:57] else was in the house
[1:21:58] I wasn't disturbing nothing and nobody
[1:22:00] but it was showing how good I'll never
[1:22:03] forget it because God from nowhere spoke
[1:22:06] that to my heart you say how you heard I
[1:22:08] heard him that's all I could tell you
[1:22:10] well well inaudible and it was in a way
[1:22:15] I hurt him so you said what I mean yeah
[1:22:19] that's that's the way it goes anyway
[1:22:21] let's move on so you realized by God's
[1:22:23] grace that when God give orders now
[1:22:25] think about it God doesn't tell you
[1:22:27] everything sometimes you want to see how
[1:22:29] much faith you got because faith is the
[1:22:30] substance of things hoped for right by
[1:22:33] faith God it's like a father and son he
[1:22:36] wants his son to develop into what he is
[1:22:39] if that makes sense everybody like when
[1:22:42] you have a son oh yes and you know
[1:22:44] that's how it is then when you first get
[1:22:46] married you hope that boy come out
[1:22:47] looking like you when I first had my
[1:22:53] first baby and it was a girl I was
[1:22:55] disappointed but then when I saw how
[1:22:57] pretty she was I got happy I'm being
[1:23:02] honest right and then when Isaiah was
[1:23:04] born I saw I was like they're watching
[1:23:08] cuz we didn't at that time we didn't
[1:23:10] have where you could go see if you did
[1:23:12] we didn't do it anyway so I'm in the
[1:23:14] labor labor delivery room looking just
[1:23:16] watch it and see what was good what was
[1:23:17] right soon as I saw was a boy I was out
[1:23:22] of control I ran
[1:23:25] oh man but my wife had a first checkup
[1:23:31] they said the doctor says your husband's
[1:23:33] still jumping amen so look we look at
[1:23:38] these things and you say oh lord have
[1:23:39] mercy but here it was God didn't tell
[1:23:41] Moses and God don't always tell you the
[1:23:44] next step but understand this the steps
[1:23:46] of a righteous man they're ordered by
[1:23:48] God God is already ordained your
[1:23:51] footsteps is not oh I'm gonna go this
[1:23:54] way no God will order your footstep if
[1:23:56] you go wrong like like Joe excuse me uh
[1:24:00] like Jonah if you go wrong like Jonah
[1:24:03] he'll make you go right all right Jonah
[1:24:07] running from the orders of God he ends
[1:24:09] up in the whales belly see you can't get
[1:24:12] away from his wheel who's gonna counsel
[1:24:14] him who's gonna tell him he's wrong
[1:24:16] who's going to judge God at the end of
[1:24:18] the day we all have to stand before him
[1:24:23] right we've seen what's happening to
[1:24:25] Lucifer
[1:24:26] read the back of the book who want to
[1:24:28] help who want that ending anybody not me
[1:24:31] not me mm-hmm I love God too much to
[1:24:35] want to go to hell like I said if don't
[1:24:38] go there they're gonna be in trouble
[1:24:39] because I feel about way I feel about
[1:24:41] God here whoo thank you Jesus I'll mess
[1:24:50] up his hell you know me I mess it up but
[1:24:54] anyway by God's grace it's the truth if
[1:24:58] you love him here you love him there
[1:25:00] it doesn't displace your death changes
[1:25:03] nothing if you love him here you'll love
[1:25:05] him there wherever you go your loving
[1:25:07] but anyway let's move on so Moses not
[1:25:11] told everything and now he's got two
[1:25:12] children either
[1:25:13] this is bad now because he's not telling
[1:25:16] he told Pharaoh in the beginning let my
[1:25:18] people go fair so I'm not gonna let him
[1:25:20] go now you got a battle between forces
[1:25:21] good and evil right and so now Moses
[1:25:25] doing all of these things and God doing
[1:25:26] these things with Moses and you know you
[1:25:29] know what we didn't even have fleas
[1:25:30] until Moses called for he created fleas
[1:25:35] it was the same
[1:25:37] that turn into bugs honey oh and you
[1:25:42] said oh is that was the thing about it
[1:25:44] the magicians could do everything Moses
[1:25:46] did but they couldn't take them away
[1:25:48] if Moses said let there be frogs they
[1:25:51] said let them come frogs they have frogs
[1:25:54] frogs in the bathroom frogs in the
[1:25:57] shower prowlers in the sink
[1:25:59] frogs in the refrigerated frogs
[1:26:01] everywhere hallelujah but they didn't
[1:26:05] know how to get rid of them they came to
[1:26:10] Moses again help us out Pharaoh Moses
[1:26:13] got rid of them but the whole point is
[1:26:18] this after a while Pharaoh's heart say
[1:26:21] take your kid take whatever just leave
[1:26:24] your you know a little bit of here and a
[1:26:26] little bit of there Moses said I'm not
[1:26:28] leaving one hook behind every one of us
[1:26:30] leaving this think about it here was the
[1:26:33] slaves read the Bible here's the slaves
[1:26:36] leaving Egypt with all the spoils all
[1:26:39] the gold all the silver all the diamond
[1:26:42] everything they could carry the cattle
[1:26:44] they lamb they whatever here they mostly
[1:26:46] take it I'll get get out of here and
[1:26:50] Moses all Pharaoh saying all this and
[1:26:53] Moses all happy and everything and he's
[1:26:55] taking praise the Lord we've gone
[1:26:56] through our promised land right but he
[1:27:01] doesn't understand that God got
[1:27:05] something up the road because a lot of
[1:27:09] time you think the storm is passing know
[1:27:12] anything something else comes right so
[1:27:16] that's what happened he's thinking is
[1:27:17] all over he gets at the Red Sea
[1:27:20] mountains on one side the waters right
[1:27:23] on the other side here come Pharaoh in
[1:27:25] his army now that's just shows you how
[1:27:28] trials can make you doubt in the skinny
[1:27:30] minute I'm coming from Exodus 2:14 and
[1:27:36] we find out that Moses got a little
[1:27:40] upset because the people accusing him
[1:27:43] what have you done
[1:27:44] have you caused us to leave Egypt so we
[1:27:47] can die out here
[1:27:48] they're always come and look at the
[1:27:50] charity
[1:27:51] we don't know all they said but one
[1:27:52] thing for certain it made Moses a little
[1:27:54] nervous and Moses began to cry out to
[1:27:57] God right he cries out to God and God
[1:28:02] says why you crowd at me why cry speak
[1:28:05] I've given you the authority right so
[1:28:08] when that thing comes to Moses he takes
[1:28:09] his rod and he speaks and then the sea
[1:28:11] opens up people don't believe that the
[1:28:15] pillar of fire exists I've seen it I've
[1:28:18] seen the pillar of cloud people say well
[1:28:20] I don't know about that when I was in in
[1:28:21] in India I was preaching the pillar
[1:28:24] cloud came down it looked like smoke
[1:28:26] like they pretending now they do the
[1:28:27] churches there we didn't have a machine
[1:28:29] it was the real thing
[1:28:31] those Hindus ran to the altar gave their
[1:28:36] hearts to Christ was baptized in the
[1:28:39] name of the Lord Jesus Christ I've seen
[1:28:41] it with my own eyes Moses began to speak
[1:28:48] to see open and they walked out on dry
[1:28:51] land
[1:28:52] people say dad didn't happen even
[1:28:54] theologian says no he sent them to read
[1:28:57] the water of the reeds there you know
[1:28:59] I've been to Egypt one time I never go
[1:29:02] back there ever ever ever
[1:29:04] unless I get a dust at the Lord from God
[1:29:06] it was the worst place I had ever
[1:29:08] visited all of my and all of my vacation
[1:29:13] thieves
[1:29:14] little games like this I saw the boys
[1:29:17] beating up on the women the little girls
[1:29:19] beating them like men and it's against
[1:29:22] the law for a woman to hit a man she
[1:29:24] could be thrown in jail or stone or
[1:29:26] whatever the case may be
[1:29:27] yeah so that little girl couldn't do
[1:29:31] nothing she just let that little boy
[1:29:33] beat her up and then stole stuff out of
[1:29:37] our our our luggage before we got to the
[1:29:39] hotel wicked place that the man that was
[1:29:46] the guide told us you can find whatever
[1:29:50] you want in Egypt any time in the day me
[1:29:56] and my wife said we stand if we stand in
[1:30:00] this place been going out let everybody
[1:30:02] else go out if they want to and it's
[1:30:04] went out and got food poisoning oh my
[1:30:08] god so anyway let me hurry I hope I'm
[1:30:12] not being too long but I'm trying to
[1:30:14] tell you something people we are in a
[1:30:17] position where we're not the only ones
[1:30:20] right this is what right we're like
[1:30:26] everybody else we can get off just like
[1:30:28] everybody else can get off but how you
[1:30:31] stay right is when you could continue to
[1:30:33] believe this Bible you believe this word
[1:30:36] every bit of it you said well it was
[1:30:39] written by me and the Bible said it was
[1:30:40] inspired by God men only wrote what they
[1:30:44] were inspired to do and God was the one
[1:30:46] who had the real ink pen that's why we
[1:30:49] don't believe by God's grace that we
[1:30:52] have men in this by in the thing that
[1:30:54] can literally change this Bible into
[1:30:56] what they call the NIV because the NIV
[1:30:59] Bible takes away takes away passages of
[1:31:02] Scripture not just words but passages
[1:31:05] and what it does it keeps you away from
[1:31:07] the truth and if by one word it brought
[1:31:12] us by disobeying me and one word brought
[1:31:14] us in this condition how are we going to
[1:31:17] get out of it by taking more the word
[1:31:19] out of it you can't do it
[1:31:22] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:31:24] and forever right the only person we're
[1:31:28] trying to point people to is the Lord
[1:31:30] Jesus Christ right so you can see let's
[1:31:34] turn the Hebrews 13:8 I'm a close here
[1:31:36] you know this is this is what we're
[1:31:39] going to be working on for a while
[1:31:51] Hebrews 13 and eight you know we it's
[1:32:00] just a strange thing because you know
[1:32:02] what it's so amazing think of how
[1:32:06] difficult it was let's read this Hebrews
[1:32:08] 13:8 and then I'll comment and then I'll
[1:32:11] let you go Jesus Christ the same
[1:32:16] yesterday and today and forever that
[1:32:21] means he changed not is that what God
[1:32:24] told Israel know that the LORD thy God
[1:32:27] he is one and their God says if there'll
[1:32:30] be another God I don't know him and
[1:32:33] Jesus in st. John 10:30 says I and my
[1:32:36] father are one and I find out that in
[1:32:41] this day you know people we've had a lot
[1:32:43] of strange thing follow through a lot of
[1:32:46] strange things you know all kinds of
[1:32:49] copes and variations of the scripture
[1:32:56] and I thought to my day I thought to
[1:32:59] myself what would Jesus have looked like
[1:33:04] here he was a single man and he's got 12
[1:33:10] disciples following him no matter where
[1:33:13] he goes they actually seem to be against
[1:33:17] all the systems because here Jesus told
[1:33:20] the Pharisees he says your father is the
[1:33:25] devil say you hold the truth in
[1:33:27] unrighteousness so you know I am the
[1:33:30] truth but you won't tell your people
[1:33:32] that you're standing right in the door
[1:33:33] and you won't go in and you won't let
[1:33:35] your book your people go in and that's
[1:33:38] how it is today you've got to realize
[1:33:40] that if I was out to fame and fortune
[1:33:44] I wouldn't be here if I was here so I
[1:33:50] could preach so you can like me because
[1:33:52] of what I preach I wouldn't be here
[1:33:57] because I you
[1:33:58] why I preach I preached because I
[1:34:00] preached the truth I know I've got
[1:34:01] something that some others don't have
[1:34:04] not because I'm good not because I've
[1:34:07] been good it's God's mercy it's God's
[1:34:11] grace like I said the other day I've
[1:34:16] gone through almost every denomination
[1:34:17] before I got here I got tired of all of
[1:34:21] the stuff all of the pomp all of the
[1:34:25] pretense and whatever more they were
[1:34:27] going on and I said God where are you
[1:34:30] and the Holy Spirit spoke to me and says
[1:34:32] I'm in my word so now I God sent me
[1:34:35] someone that knew God and His Word was
[1:34:38] one in the beginning was the word the
[1:34:40] Word was with God and the Word was God
[1:34:42] still is today and I knew that this is
[1:34:47] this Bible I don't care a thousand
[1:34:49] people put it together why do the world
[1:34:51] hate it so why have they tried to tear
[1:34:54] it away take it away they've tried to
[1:34:57] change and look at all the churches now
[1:34:59] that you know you know I had a friend of
[1:35:01] mine said well it makes it easier to
[1:35:03] read hello
[1:35:05] what are you talking about you're
[1:35:08] reading it and you're reading the wrong
[1:35:10] revelation of it what do you mean let me
[1:35:14] say it like this what makes a car
[1:35:16] understand a cow because it's a cow then
[1:35:21] we have to go to school to learn cow
[1:35:23] language with we're falling that's why
[1:35:28] we have to learn English a language but
[1:35:30] if you listen to all the babies they cry
[1:35:32] the same in in Japan Japanese and
[1:35:36] Chinese and why they come here singing
[1:35:38] the same song they cry when they're
[1:35:42] hungry they laugh when they're happy you
[1:35:45] know but it's because we're falling
[1:35:47] bable bable bable we become Babel all
[1:35:50] right and we've had to teach these
[1:35:52] things to them a horse is not falling he
[1:35:56] never sinned he doesn't have to go to
[1:35:59] school says now when you born in a few
[1:36:01] more minutes you're gonna stand up of
[1:36:02] your feet and there's gonna be somebody
[1:36:04] they're gonna instruct you instruct you
[1:36:06] on how to go feed from Mama's past it's
[1:36:10] in them
[1:36:12] because they're not falling we're the
[1:36:14] only falling creatures and because we're
[1:36:18] falling we get lost but one thing about
[1:36:23] cows one thing about sheep I don't care
[1:36:25] if there's a thousand sheep out there
[1:36:27] and that loose that that that little
[1:36:29] sheep getting mixed up in the bunch that
[1:36:32] mother can hear that bleep and she'll
[1:36:35] find him or that little little sheep
[1:36:39] will find his mother why it knows the
[1:36:43] mother's voice that's how it is in the
[1:36:47] spirit if you truly one of those that
[1:36:51] God has ordained to eternal life I don't
[1:36:53] care it down the road how long it takes
[1:36:55] there'll be a word there'll be something
[1:36:57] that's gonna strike you and you'll know
[1:37:01] you know my sheep here is my boys not my
[1:37:08] sheep I don't have any
[1:37:09] it's his sheep and this message what
[1:37:12] we're preaching like this is all over
[1:37:14] the world
[1:37:15] I don't know much myself but what I know
[1:37:18] is true is what I preach and there are
[1:37:22] Christians all over there Christians and
[1:37:25] every denomination every organization
[1:37:27] that need to hear what truth is and
[1:37:34] that's what I've been ordained to do
[1:37:37] tell the truth be wise in my teaching
[1:37:43] and telling it but I know what is truth
[1:37:46] and you know I look at I look at things
[1:37:50] and I say to myself you know I am the
[1:37:56] least of all God's servants I don't say
[1:38:03] that to flatter or to make like I'm
[1:38:06] trying to know that's the way I feel
[1:38:07] that's the way I believe but I do know
[1:38:11] one thing that I know him and he knows
[1:38:13] me and what has amazed me about God is
[1:38:18] that no matter how many times I make
[1:38:20] mistakes he's always there when no
[1:38:24] Raina's around who's there singing in my
[1:38:26] ear
[1:38:29] you ain't no devil gonna saying to me
[1:38:31] I'm so doubt I didn't got no song on my
[1:38:34] heart and here he comes
[1:38:36] it wasn't my mind my mind don't know how
[1:38:38] to tune into that hallelujah
[1:38:42] y'all remember on New Year's I'm closing
[1:38:45] now New Year's right here it is we sing
[1:38:49] it in y'all know we don't sound good
[1:38:50] when we sing awesome bosses it was turn
[1:38:55] y'all know all of a sudden we sing in
[1:38:58] our what was it hallelujah and that
[1:39:03] angel choir came down I thought I was
[1:39:05] losing my mind
[1:39:06] I really did and here I was in my house
[1:39:11] talking my daughter I said I tell you
[1:39:13] what I'm almost afraid to say that I
[1:39:14] said but I heard angels singing
[1:39:15] she broke she started rejoicing you cry
[1:39:19] insane tearing down she said I thought I
[1:39:22] was I was I thought it was just me I was
[1:39:25] afraid to say anything and how many we
[1:39:27] got about 12 witnesses who heard that
[1:39:28] choir the pitch was too perfect it was
[1:39:35] beautiful
[1:39:35] it wasn't the first time I ever heard
[1:39:37] that I was testifying about this same
[1:39:40] thing there at the airport and these two
[1:39:42] ladies were sitting in and they were
[1:39:44] shaking my hair like that poor so he
[1:39:46] really believes that kind of a star and
[1:39:49] I'm looking at him and I'm saying
[1:39:51] you a poor soul see when I when I was
[1:39:57] young I heard this same choir down there
[1:39:59] dear brother Simmons and I'm telling you
[1:40:01] we you took my devil's cast out of
[1:40:03] people and all that I seen with my eye I
[1:40:04] didn't even you know I heard it but when
[1:40:07] I saw it I said every Christian need to
[1:40:10] see a demon cast out every Christian it
[1:40:15] scared me how
[1:40:17] I'm serious I'm laughing but I'm just
[1:40:20] telling you as a young Christian it
[1:40:22] scared me y'all think that stuff y'all
[1:40:25] see on the TV estate that lady eyes
[1:40:27] turned blood-red she started selling
[1:40:29] like pigs sounds of birds came out of
[1:40:32] and she was moving like a serpent seen
[1:40:35] it with my own eyes I ain't the only one
[1:40:37] that's seen it and she was sneaking
[1:40:39] herself right up to that pulpit like
[1:40:41] like she was coming my way and as a rule
[1:40:43] Lord Jesus I said this thought what's
[1:40:45] the same way I said whatever I did
[1:40:46] freeze don't let it come and be God
[1:40:51] delivered her to but I've seen it with
[1:40:54] my own eyes I was believer from then on
[1:40:56] that that stuff is real you know and but
[1:41:01] anyway and all of this I'm saying we are
[1:41:03] battling and God challenged that service
[1:41:05] with that lady's condition and God
[1:41:08] healed her God delivered her I've seen
[1:41:11] too much to notice that it's real I've
[1:41:14] seen it just convincing others that that
[1:41:20] they're just it's more to this world
[1:41:22] than just living and dying like I said
[1:41:27] in closing you could stand in the end of
[1:41:30] this whole thing you and I must realize
[1:41:32] we're at a battle it's good and evil
[1:41:35] there's nothing in between it's good and
[1:41:37] evil and you and I know by God's grace
[1:41:39] amen you and I can't live it
[1:41:43] I can't live good I tried it with my mom
[1:41:47] living I tried to live good I couldn't
[1:41:49] do it and every weekend I went and I did
[1:41:51] my thing to the faith to the point I
[1:41:55] ended up with a gun in my head trying to
[1:41:57] commit suicide and God delivered me from
[1:42:00] that and he saved me a week later
[1:42:04] however long it was he saved me and
[1:42:07] we're not God took all that stuff out of
[1:42:10] me like he did I just thought I was an
[1:42:11] angel didn't know down the road I had
[1:42:14] battles to face yeah joy you better
[1:42:22] enjoy that joy when his friends could
[1:42:23] the battles coming but I've never had a
[1:42:26] mind to turn back ever

[1:44:10] god is real

[1:47:14] [Music]
[1:47:25] in my do you feel him when you know he's
[1:47:37] dead you can be like David he said
[1:47:41] though I walk through the valley in the
[1:47:42] shadow of death I fear no evil for thou
[1:47:47] art with me
[1:47:48] if people could just read the back of
[1:47:51] the book there come to see that it is a
[1:47:54] law and Satan is defeated
[1:47:58] and all of his angels and the demons and
[1:48:01] everything is cast into the lake of fire
[1:48:03] a man the Bible said he deceived the
[1:48:06] whole world all whose names were not
[1:48:10] written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:48:13] that's a lot of people one escaped death
[1:48:17] and that was Enoch and Noah day was 8
[1:48:20] think about it if there was eight
[1:48:23] million it was one out of a million and
[1:48:26] escaped the flood and if God said it was
[1:48:29] going to be like that in this day as it
[1:48:31] was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah as
[1:48:32] only three they're only three and as it
[1:48:36] was
[1:48:36] the days of Noah 1 excuse me right think
[1:48:43] how small the percentage will be this
[1:48:45] yeah this time Israel is this nation all
[1:48:49] of the things that happening the earth
[1:48:50] is quaking volcano's eruption disease on
[1:48:52] the rampant you know lawlessness is what
[1:48:56] this world has become how much longer
[1:48:59] and if God would not judge this world he
[1:49:02] have to raise up Sodom and Gomorrah and
[1:49:04] apologize we know by God's grace that
[1:49:08] God has sent a way of escape he promised
[1:49:10] he would in every age and now we know by
[1:49:14] God's grace today is our time today is
[1:49:16] our day you know you have a song sir
