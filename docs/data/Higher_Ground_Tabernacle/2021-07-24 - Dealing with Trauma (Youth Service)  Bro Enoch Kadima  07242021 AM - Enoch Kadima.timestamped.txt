[31:05] close friends passed away due to coveted
[31:09] you know even though he's we know that
[31:11] he'll be in a greater place
[31:13] just the fact that i'll not see him on
[31:15] this side again is
[31:16] rather saddening and it's amazing
[31:19] because one of these old days
[31:22] uh we'll see him in jerusalem
[31:25] we thank god for our precious brother
[31:29] stephen francis and we my condolences to
[31:32] the family
[31:33] there in south africa and i trust that
[31:37] and i know the lord will bring him
[31:38] through the good part is that
[31:40] his wife is recovering
[31:44] and i know it's very difficult for them
[31:46] because
[31:47] i've never seen two live human doves
[31:51] as it were with them they really loved
[31:54] each other
[31:55] but anyway we thank god for the youth
[31:58] this morning
[31:59] and we had
[32:03] planned to minister but you know our
[32:05] brother enoch came through
[32:08] he is with brother chad lamb and he
[32:11] goes to the church and there and then we
[32:14] have our brother wesley
[32:16] godfrey who i've known
[32:19] uh even when his within his mother's
[32:21] womb if you want to say it like that
[32:23] i remember we prayed another pray that
[32:26] god will
[32:27] bless her with children and of course he
[32:31] was the first we thank god for him
[32:36] by god's grace and we appreciate him
[32:40] coming and
[32:41] we're going to invite our brother
[32:44] enoch to come up and he can introduce
[32:46] himself
[32:47] he's got some
[32:52] roots
[32:55] that will tie in with some of us today
[32:57] and so
[32:58] i just want him to have his way um
[33:02] he first told me no and then god touched
[33:04] him
[33:05] amen you know because i feel like this
[33:07] man has come through a lot of things
[33:08] he's been
[33:09] in the message for a long while and he
[33:12] can tell you some things that will
[33:13] encourage you
[33:15] so we're trusting that uh the lord i
[33:17] want him to be free don't be nervous i
[33:19] will be able to tell it no i'm just
[33:20] kidding
[33:21] i shouldn't say that

[33:26] cost a penny
[33:30] and we thank god come brother have you
[33:34] have the all weight

[34:02] to talk to the bride of christ
[34:04] and um just wanted to you know
[34:07] brother um asked me yesterday to uh
[34:12] uh maybe to share my testimony a little
[34:14] bit
[34:15] and initially i'm actually a very shy
[34:18] person
[34:19] so it's not something that you know
[34:23] i uh that comes naturally to me but
[34:29] i had the opportunity to speak to
[34:32] a some youth um
[34:35] with my my dad's church um
[34:38] you know i'm back in boston um and just
[34:42] uh
[34:42] it was definitely a burden for me to
[34:44] just share my heart and
[34:46] just to know what kind of things that
[34:47] y'all go through
[34:49] you know i've gone to you know middle
[34:51] school high school college
[34:53] i understand the pressures of all those
[34:55] things i understand

[35:13] that be a benefit to all of you all
[35:15] right so let's just
[35:16] pray and just let the lord have his way
[35:20] heavenly father um when i look through
[35:24] this
[35:24] these these young men here this group
[35:27] here
[35:28] god it just reminds me so much of uh of
[35:31] myself god
[35:32] and god i'm such a un
[35:36] worthy vessel to to bring just uh
[35:40] something here but god i know that
[35:43] you put something in my heart god and i
[35:46] pray that
[35:47] be i'll be able to just just uh
[35:51] let let go and have and have and let you
[35:54] have your way god
[35:56] and may it be a benefit um they they
[35:59] have a great ministry here
[36:00] surely that um the pastor had something
[36:04] great of value god but i you know just
[36:07] uh what he's
[36:09] uh just uh the news maybe that he had
[36:11] today maybe it's
[36:13] a good thing that he can just uh take
[36:15] time just to
[36:17] deal with the sad news that has occurred
[36:21] to one of his friends god but i pray
[36:24] that you be with us from the beginning
[36:26] to the end god i pray that you may just
[36:28] anoint the word that we're about to
[36:30] preach
[36:31] and just uh and to just testify about
[36:33] our testimony a little bit
[36:35] we pray all this in the name of jesus
[36:37] christ amen
[36:42] [Music]
[36:45] well let's just start with a uh a
[36:47] scripture
[36:48] and in romans
[36:52] romans 8. and
[36:55] 14
[37:04] for as many as led by the spirit of god
[37:07] they are the sons of god
[37:09] for we have now received the spirit of
[37:11] bondage again to fear
[37:12] but we have received the spirit of
[37:15] adoption
[37:16] where we cry abba father
[37:19] the spirit itself bear witness with our
[37:21] spirit that we are the children of god
[37:24] and if we're children then we're heirs
[37:25] of god and joining
[37:27] with christ if so be that we
[37:30] suffer with them that we may be also
[37:34] glorified together for i reckon
[37:37] that the suffering of this present time
[37:40] are not worthy to
[37:41] be compared with the glory which has
[37:44] been revealed in us
[37:46] amen you may have your seed amen
[37:55] you know um as i
[37:59] you know talk to any any group of
[38:02] especially
[38:03] young people i always put myself in
[38:06] their shoes
[38:07] and because it's still pretty easy for
[38:10] me to do and
[38:11] and try to remember what kind of
[38:13] challenges
[38:15] and what kind of um
[38:18] things are dealt with as somebody who is
[38:21] growing up in the message you know
[38:23] my dad was um is a minister but was a
[38:27] pastor
[38:29] and just watching what
[38:32] uh what kind of things make
[38:35] young people successful what kind of
[38:38] things make them
[38:40] um be really the kind of christians that
[38:43] they need to be
[38:44] and the these are they're very simple
[38:47] keys and
[38:47] and i i believe that no doubt um your
[38:50] pastors
[38:51] have uh your pastor has covered that and
[38:54] and
[38:54] and just uh i just want to bring it in
[38:56] my own anger and my own
[38:58] my own story you know um
[39:02] and and i just uh want to start with uh
[39:04] a lot of these
[39:05] quotes will be coming from a message why
[39:09] are my people so tossed about and
[39:13] the first one here is um uh as
[39:16] the prophet will say the christian the
[39:19] the christian rest
[39:20] in that hope upon the stormy seas
[39:24] there's
[39:24] sure uh storms rise and all kinds of
[39:28] trouble
[39:28] but we're anchored that's all i'm not
[39:31] here
[39:32] uh it never it never sinks it never
[39:35] sinks i notice i've noticed many times
[39:39] in my life to be
[39:40] uh i've noticed many christians in my
[39:43] life to be
[39:44] up and down and i wondered about it and
[39:47] i
[39:49] and without preaching such a text
[39:53] out here in other churches where i go i
[39:56] want i thought it best to
[39:57] deliver this to the people in the time
[40:00] like
[40:00] why are people so tossed about you find
[40:03] them
[40:04] people who have that seem to be very
[40:06] religious
[40:08] seem to have a deep desire and
[40:11] a daily search and hunt and seek god
[40:15] but never come to a settlement of any
[40:17] kind
[40:18] to here to where they
[40:22] could ever be rested or anchored in
[40:25] christ
[40:26] now this is a question that the prophet
[40:28] is asking himself and
[40:29] he's watching um uh different
[40:33] different uh uh christians that they
[40:36] have a desire to live a christian life
[40:38] i believe most young people have a
[40:40] desire
[40:41] to live a christian life most of them
[40:44] you know
[40:45] you want to live a christian life but
[40:47] you find yourself
[40:48] always like struggling between two
[40:51] different
[40:52] opinions because yeah you come to church
[40:55] and the pastor is preaching one
[40:56] direction right he's telling he's
[40:58] telling you
[40:59] um uh how how to obtain the things of
[41:03] god he's telling you
[41:04] how to uh be live a christian life
[41:07] and then you go to school and then you
[41:09] have this
[41:10] this influences it's it's like living a
[41:13] different world
[41:14] sunday on sunday you're feeling like
[41:18] you know this today was my day on monday
[41:21] you know i know most of you have some
[41:23] probably summer vacation
[41:25] you're gonna miss that but um i i'll
[41:28] tell you
[41:29] i'll tell you like go i remember going
[41:31] back to
[41:32] you know after a good summer going to
[41:34] different camps and things of that
[41:35] nature
[41:36] um and then having
[41:40] uh having to go back to public school
[41:43] and it was this uh this fight between
[41:47] the influences of the
[41:49] the right influences and the wrong
[41:51] influences
[41:52] and the thing that i wish
[41:56] i would have grasped earlier is that
[41:59] if you want to live a christian life if
[42:02] you want to
[42:04] um you know live a li a a life
[42:08] that is worthy of the gospel you have to
[42:10] be
[42:11] you have to you can't be as the bible
[42:13] says uh having two different opinions
[42:16] you can there's no way to uh live a
[42:19] christian life
[42:20] and fear what people think there's
[42:22] there's
[42:23] you it's uh it's it's a
[42:27] a waste of time to live a christian
[42:30] try to live a christian life and not let
[42:33] your friends know that you're a
[42:34] christian it's a waste of time to
[42:37] try to you know have all your all your
[42:39] church friends oh
[42:40] they know that you know you you read the
[42:42] bible you come to church every day
[42:44] but none of your uh worldly friend order
[42:46] friends or
[42:47] classmates know that you're a christian
[42:50] that's those are two different uh
[42:53] that's a hypocrisy if i go to your
[42:56] school and i asked uh about
[42:58] or your workplace or your uh college or
[43:02] whatever
[43:02] and i asked them uh this young man this
[43:06] uh or this sister or this individual uh
[43:09] you know
[43:10] uh are they christian if they
[43:13] they give me a look like they don't know
[43:15] that's
[43:16] that's a bad sign that that's that's a
[43:19] really a waste
[43:20] of a cr uh it's it's a waste of a your
[43:23] uh christian walk it's a waste of your
[43:27] you're not actually living the christian
[43:29] life
[43:30] it's not because remember uh when the
[43:33] uh when chris when christian andy first
[43:36] started
[43:37] people were willing to die for it
[43:40] people were not ashamed of the gospel
[43:43] and i find so many individuals that are
[43:45] ashamed
[43:46] of the gospel because the gospel has a
[43:48] reproach
[43:49] you know uh you see the sisters
[43:52] dressed and right and and they're
[43:55] automatically
[43:57] the first thing is the peer pressure of
[43:59] everybody already knows you're different
[44:01] and young people just want to be the
[44:03] same as everybody
[44:05] but that aspect of that it's a natural
[44:08] um tendency to want to to go
[44:12] where your peers are going but if you
[44:14] feel in your heart
[44:15] that there's this aspect of wanting to
[44:19] please
[44:20] people that you know once you graduate
[44:23] from college once you graduate from
[44:25] high school you probably not never see
[44:26] these people again
[44:28] if you have that aspect that you still
[44:31] want to
[44:32] kind of show that hey you know um
[44:35] uh you know like i try to please them in
[44:38] any way
[44:39] when it comes and it makes you
[44:41] compromise
[44:42] you already know that there's something
[44:44] wrong with your christian experience
[44:46] already know that you're not there yet
[44:48] you're in your way there maybe
[44:50] you're reading your bible maybe you're
[44:52] really um
[44:54] uh maybe you're really sincere and as as
[44:57] we read the quote here
[44:58] about um uh you have a deep desire
[45:02] you're not you're not a bad kid you know
[45:04] a bad uh young man or
[45:06] a bad young uh sister no
[45:09] it's just that it's a fight and it's
[45:12] hard
[45:12] to die in this generation it that's what
[45:15] it is it's a it's uh
[45:17] it's a lack of depth to self and
[45:20] you find many people who have you it's a
[45:23] pride
[45:24] because because to be a christian that
[45:26] means
[45:27] that means they'll you know as you would
[45:30] know like uh
[45:31] there'll be jokes that are around and
[45:34] there's a choice do you partake in that
[45:37] or do you choose to live uh
[45:41] to actually be alone that's what it is i
[45:44] remember
[45:44] i remember being in high school and
[45:48] um and my family moved a lot so i was in
[45:50] three different high schools like
[45:52] you know four years three different high
[45:54] schools so that's you know very
[45:55] interesting but
[45:57] and i would uh
[46:00] you know the uh i i gave my life to
[46:03] christ
[46:04] and and i was
[46:07] you know i i would go i would go to
[46:10] you know the first uh week of class and
[46:13] they would they will they would look at
[46:14] they look at me and be like oh well he's
[46:16] probably into sports they just guessed
[46:17] that
[46:19] he sp they thought that i was one of
[46:21] them
[46:22] so you know everybody would try to to
[46:25] make new friends and things of that
[46:27] nature
[46:28] and eventually i couldn't go to the
[46:31] parties that they were going to
[46:32] i couldn't you know joke about the
[46:34] things they were joking about
[46:36] so i just kept quiet many times i
[46:37] couldn't do all these kind of things and
[46:39] and it just brought a separation
[46:43] and many times the word brings us
[46:46] separation
[46:47] and we try to bring a unity with things
[46:50] that we shouldn't
[46:51] unify with there's a reason the the
[46:54] the messages is is is is cutting
[46:58] it's because god does not want you to
[47:00] make alliances
[47:02] with with uh canaanites for the lack of
[47:04] bad word
[47:05] he doesn't want you to you know your job
[47:08] is not to be the most popular kid
[47:10] in school your job is not to be uh to be
[47:14] liked you're you're you know if you're
[47:16] if you want to be like you're still
[47:18] living for yourself
[47:20] you're still living for your own
[47:21] pleasures your own um
[47:24] you know uh you're you're still living
[47:27] for yourself you haven't actually done
[47:28] the first thing
[47:29] by dying to uh uh
[47:32] dying to yourself
[47:36] so not coming to a a deep
[47:40] relationship with christ is usually it's
[47:42] actually
[47:43] our fault you know it's our fault
[47:46] because it's available
[47:48] i'm just coming here to get a quote here
[47:50] um
[47:51] i told my dad a few minutes ago or
[47:55] uh maybe a hour ago that i was i was um
[47:58] gonna you know maybe share a little bit
[48:00] of my testimony and i asked for this
[48:02] particular quote
[48:03] and he was just laughing because he was
[48:05] like he's uh he's gonna be ministering
[48:07] as well and um maybe in a few weeks here
[48:11] and he just happened to be also using
[48:14] this quote as well so he just had it
[48:16] so it kind of encouraged me a little bit
[48:20] and the the this quota um
[48:24] is from questions and answers
[48:28] um the first first one that preached in
[48:31] 19 1964
[48:36] um and the pro
[48:39] the prophet is answering a question from
[48:43] one of his
[48:46] probably a young lady here as he he will
[48:48] he would say
[48:49] um and let's just read it here brother
[48:52] bro um
[48:53] let's see where to start brother brown
[48:57] um i can't
[49:01] okay let me just uh spend the right
[49:04] the rest of the time here you um you
[49:07] can't
[49:08] uh surrender to jesus they they don't i
[49:11] don't
[49:12] i um
[49:16] i don't know man or woman i
[49:19] i can't tell what which it is
[49:22] god knows you can't surrender to jesus
[49:27] why why what's the matter if you are
[49:30] a woman don't you have a a
[49:33] uh don't you sacrifice to your husband
[49:36] to be
[49:37] a wife surren uh surrender all you are
[49:40] a little a little lady when
[49:44] you're married virtuous fought all your
[49:46] life to
[49:47] uh to be virtuous but one day you find
[49:50] a man that you love you've where he is
[49:54] you are he is completely the
[49:58] the uh the thing is that you
[50:01] the things that you fought for all your
[50:03] life uh to keep clean to keep
[50:05] um clear to keep a virtuous now you
[50:08] surrender
[50:09] every bit of it to one man isn't that
[50:12] right
[50:12] you put yourself completely in uh
[50:15] in his uh his hands you are all that you
[50:19] stood for uh indicency and moral and
[50:22] everything that
[50:23] now you uh you are you turn over uh
[50:26] because you sir
[50:27] uh you surround yourself to that man
[50:30] can't you do the same to uh to jesus
[50:33] christ
[50:34] just surrender yourself that way all
[50:37] that you are
[50:38] all your mind your thoughts certainly
[50:41] i don't think you are possessed of the
[50:44] evil spiri
[50:45] evil spirit i think that the i think
[50:49] that
[50:49] uh evil spirit anoints you with them
[50:52] thoughts
[50:53] uh try to make you think you cannot
[50:55] surrender
[50:56] yourself to god and
[50:59] uh this quote is uh just uh a little
[51:02] illustration as a a woman asking
[51:06] uh brother branham why can i not fully
[51:09] surrender
[51:11] and and the question uh the answer to it
[51:15] the prophet turns it around and say why
[51:19] he basically brings the responsibility
[51:21] to the individual
[51:23] and he says why can't you
[51:26] surrender why can't you um
[51:30] you know live a uh
[51:33] completely trust in god
[51:36] and the iss in the in the issue uh
[51:39] with this uh uh young uh
[51:42] young woman or uh individual here is
[51:45] that
[51:46] she has he's been anointed with evil
[51:49] spirits
[51:51] to make her think that she cannot
[51:52] surrender and that is actually what the
[51:55] devil does to all of us
[51:57] the reason you know like if there is a
[52:00] part of uh one's life
[52:02] that they can't surrender it's because
[52:04] the devil has convinced you
[52:06] that you cannot surrender it that's what
[52:09] it is
[52:09] the devil has convinced you it would be
[52:11] too hard to
[52:13] uh to surrender this the the the devil
[52:16] will tell you it's too hard to surrender
[52:19] entertainment
[52:20] that's what he will tell you be like
[52:22] well what else are you gonna do
[52:24] you know and i think one of those things
[52:27] uh entertainment is a plague in our
[52:30] generation
[52:31] you know i don't even think people can
[52:32] think right anymore without you know
[52:35] take your phone for five minutes
[52:36] i think people start shaking a little
[52:38] bit you know and and it's like how can
[52:40] and it hit me how can you live a
[52:43] christian life
[52:44] and not never have dedicate time to
[52:48] prayer
[52:49] because the issue is you know instagram
[52:51] is always
[52:52] you know you always hear that that alert
[52:55] telling you
[52:56] that there's something uh uh
[52:59] you know some of the somebody post
[53:00] something or whatever
[53:02] you know and it's just like with uh
[53:06] you can't you can't do that i i i was
[53:09] actually uh i thought it was funny
[53:11] um uh just speak uh that subject came up
[53:14] with uh some of us uh fellowshipping
[53:17] and and we find that
[53:20] in this generation we have so many
[53:22] influences
[53:24] so many things you know uh that
[53:27] the plague our time we have no time for
[53:30] dedicated prayer
[53:31] we have no time to deal with with issues
[53:35] we have no time to look at ourselves and
[53:37] say
[53:38] you know our time the prophet talked
[53:40] about you know meditation
[53:42] sitting down and thinking about
[53:45] what i need what i need to go to the
[53:49] next level
[53:50] in my life what do i need like and it's
[53:53] it's such a freeing time god can tell
[53:55] you what you should be doing
[53:57] god can tell you what career you should
[53:59] be pursuing
[54:00] god can tell you every every young man
[54:02] i've seen
[54:03] that takes time just to uh
[54:06] to worship him to read this scripture to
[54:10] to read the message to to really
[54:12] dedicate themselves
[54:13] i find that god blesses everything they
[54:16] do
[54:17] everything you know career-wise people
[54:19] you know they just
[54:20] uh they just take a career and just try
[54:22] to do something
[54:24] and you're not gifted in that that
[54:26] avenue
[54:27] god could have told you that and make
[54:28] you you know
[54:30] spend less tuition money if you just
[54:32] listen to him
[54:34] you know like and and not having that
[54:37] personal
[54:38] really the the most beautiful thing to
[54:40] have is a personal
[54:42] relationship with christ that's the most
[54:44] beautiful thing like
[54:45] you know that that time to
[54:48] to uh to be in prayer god answering
[54:52] your your uh your questions
[54:55] reading the scriptures and listen to the
[54:57] message and then you go to church
[54:59] and and the pastor is preaching exactly
[55:02] what you've been reading
[55:04] you know the and it's because you know
[55:08] there's individuals that um
[55:11] have taken basically you get what you
[55:15] put in
[55:16] you get you know like if you if you give
[55:18] ten percent
[55:20] you're only getting ten percent of what
[55:22] god has for you
[55:23] amen you know if you if you if you give
[55:26] fifty percent you're getting fifty
[55:27] percent
[55:28] if you get a hundred percent god will
[55:30] even give you more than that
[55:31] that's the secret that is a secret and
[55:34] and just
[55:35] you know i just want to encourage you
[55:37] never ever be ashamed
[55:39] of christ never be ashamed of living
[55:43] a christian life and that's and that's
[55:44] one of the things that deborah is going
[55:46] to try
[55:46] to do he's going to try to traumatize
[55:48] you with
[55:50] with rejection that's what he's going to
[55:52] try to he's
[55:53] it's uh and that's actually uh one of
[55:56] the things
[55:56] uh the title of this uh little uh
[56:00] uh talk right here um dealing with
[56:02] trauma
[56:03] there is a trauma in rejection
[56:07] there's a trauma in going to places and
[56:10] always being rejected
[56:12] there's a trauma with you never being
[56:16] uh you know because of your stance
[56:19] some people are avoiding you because of
[56:21] your stance your family avoiding you
[56:23] even if even your media family sometimes
[56:27] there's a trauma to that but if you
[56:28] can't you know
[56:30] withstand that you're not his
[56:33] if you cannot uh it's it's a choice you
[56:36] have to
[56:37] i want everybody to really look at their
[56:39] hearts today and just say
[56:40] am i willing to withstand rejection
[56:44] every day that's our christian life like
[56:46] we're rejected for
[56:48] you know our work rejected for just
[56:52] not going to uh you know uh
[56:55] any of the christmas uh parties and
[56:58] things of that nature
[57:00] it just doesn't stop you're just always
[57:02] gonna be rejected
[57:04] and but i'd rather be rejected and have
[57:07] experience with christ
[57:09] then then everybody except me and it's
[57:12] you know and everybody think
[57:13] you know i am whatever popular cool
[57:16] whatever the words that
[57:18] now people use uh
[57:21] it's not it's not worth it it's not
[57:23] worth sitting in your seats and
[57:26] having a a a
[57:29] a a a a life here that seems right
[57:33] and then going to
[57:36] one's home or one's place of work
[57:40] or one's uh or any
[57:43] friend group and and
[57:46] accept things that they're they'll be
[57:48] saying
[57:49] accept and live a mediocre life
[57:54] it's not that that it's like the biggest
[57:56] waste of time
[57:57] you know the most dangerous position to
[58:00] be
[58:00] in is to be close to the word
[58:03] and not be a part of the word you know
[58:06] that's you you find yourself
[58:08] in a jewish position because you're so
[58:11] close to the world you know um other
[58:14] you know uh other people that have never
[58:16] heard the message
[58:18] maybe in the day of judgment they'll
[58:20] have something to say you know
[58:21] i never heard you know but any person
[58:24] that
[58:25] has heard and walks away
[58:29] because and the reason people walk away
[58:31] is because they never
[58:33] took this time to
[58:36] to really take inventory if they're
[58:39] if they're willing to pay the price
[58:43] of of what of what the message is asking
[58:46] them to do
[58:47] that's why people walk away the for
[58:49] years
[58:50] they just a church they're clapping
[58:53] they're
[58:54] they seem to be as a good christian as
[58:56] anybody there
[58:57] at home you know on their computers
[59:01] on on whatever the it's a
[59:04] it's a double standard you know when you
[59:07] have a
[59:09] um when you have a uh
[59:12] issue in in whatever aspect if you're
[59:15] dealing with
[59:17] uh uh if you're dealing with things like
[59:20] uh i'll just say if you're dealing with
[59:23] things like lust and things of that
[59:24] nature
[59:25] it has to be dealt with you know you
[59:28] have
[59:28] you you have uh you got uh you probably
[59:31] have great parents that can talk
[59:33] you can talk to them about if you have a
[59:36] dad in your life
[59:37] you gotta talk to them about that kind
[59:38] of stuff god already sees it
[59:42] um god i'm just i'm just i've gone to
[59:45] enough youth camps talked to enough
[59:46] young people to know what i'm talking
[59:48] about okay so you have to deal with it
[59:51] that's a trump that's a trauma so you're
[59:53] going to church
[59:54] and and and every time you know
[59:58] the the gospel is being preached and you
[1:00:00] know
[1:00:01] that it's right and you know and you
[1:00:03] want to surrender
[1:00:04] but you know that you have this in your
[1:00:06] life and
[1:00:07] that trauma of sin and unconvinced sin
[1:00:11] or just besetting sin is affecting your
[1:00:14] walk
[1:00:14] to to to live a life a life that is
[1:00:17] worthy of the gospel
[1:00:19] and now it's in your subconscious you
[1:00:22] you know that uh i i you can't walk to
[1:00:25] his throne boldly
[1:00:27] you can't fully surrender why can't the
[1:00:29] young people can't fully surrender
[1:00:32] it's because uh the the guilts that
[1:00:35] they're
[1:00:36] they're facing they know the the they
[1:00:39] know
[1:00:39] every time the uh
[1:00:44] how holy this this standard is and they
[1:00:47] know they're not living up to that
[1:00:48] you just have to be honest what you need
[1:00:51] is to be honest
[1:00:52] and talk to uh talk to your pastor talk
[1:00:54] to uh i
[1:00:56] i know you uh this uh associate
[1:00:59] ministers here and and things about
[1:01:01] nature and and talk to god about it
[1:01:03] seriously just
[1:01:04] say this is where i struggle with god
[1:01:07] you know and maybe it's not that maybe
[1:01:09] it's entertainment
[1:01:10] and i think entertainment is i'm going
[1:01:13] to use the word trauma for entertainment
[1:01:15] because entertainment makes people neuro
[1:01:18] neurotics
[1:01:19] it's you're so you can't even
[1:01:23] young people can't even sit down for
[1:01:24] five minutes for a service
[1:01:27] young people like that's why you know uh
[1:01:32] that that's why i would say that's why
[1:01:35] people struggle because
[1:01:37] the entertainment runs you know 100
[1:01:39] miles per hour
[1:01:40] the things of a god you know
[1:01:43] are slow they take time
[1:01:47] it takes time to pray it takes time to
[1:01:50] just
[1:01:50] relax your not your mind so god can
[1:01:52] speak to you many
[1:01:54] many times people ask why is god not
[1:01:56] speaking to me he's actually speaking to
[1:01:58] you but you can't just hear
[1:01:59] because you know whatever sport sport is
[1:02:02] going on
[1:02:02] and there's always something that you
[1:02:04] know basketball season is over
[1:02:06] football is coming the dev already knows
[1:02:07] he gets you whatever baseball whatever
[1:02:10] it is
[1:02:11] and you're always and it's these are not
[1:02:12] even bad things right like
[1:02:14] uh there's nothing wrong wrong with with
[1:02:17] uh with
[1:02:18] with sports the the issue is the time
[1:02:22] it's the time we a lot to it is adultery
[1:02:26] like it's it's you can't live a
[1:02:28] christian life
[1:02:29] and give god five minutes and give
[1:02:31] lebron james like you know for
[1:02:33] four hours of your time that's it like
[1:02:37] that's that's that's what it is you know
[1:02:40] and and that's a decision you have to
[1:02:42] also make how much time am i
[1:02:44] am i spending on entertainment
[1:02:48] how much time am i spending on sports
[1:02:52] how much time am i am i spending doing
[1:02:55] things that not profitable
[1:02:58] and and just have that uh that clear
[1:03:02] clear channel with with the lord
[1:03:05] um let's just uh i don't know how much
[1:03:08] time i have here so
[1:03:10] i'll just uh you know maybe move it
[1:03:12] along a little bit here but
[1:03:14] uh once again going to a message called
[1:03:17] um
[1:03:18] why are my people so tossed about and
[1:03:22] and um this i've learned in experience
[1:03:26] that is
[1:03:27] people of um in uh uh sargon
[1:03:31] god and this i have learned to be
[1:03:35] in experience is is that
[1:03:38] people of intel uh intelligence now
[1:03:42] now uh speaking this there's two types
[1:03:46] of christians that seems that seems
[1:03:49] strange
[1:03:50] but i would not say two
[1:03:53] uh different types i would say two
[1:03:56] phases
[1:03:57] will be uh will be better to use
[1:04:01] not two different types two different
[1:04:03] phases the same christianity
[1:04:06] but two different phases of it one of
[1:04:09] them
[1:04:09] they have intel uh intelligence or a
[1:04:12] mental conception
[1:04:14] of what god has said in his word
[1:04:17] and and of jesus christ by the way of
[1:04:20] knowledge
[1:04:21] and the other is by ex experiential
[1:04:25] exp uh experiential experience that god
[1:04:28] has given
[1:04:29] that the man in his heart so there's
[1:04:32] two different phases of it like and i
[1:04:35] believe most of you have probably
[1:04:36] experienced the first phase which is the
[1:04:39] the mental conception
[1:04:42] uh you know the knowledge of the message
[1:04:44] the
[1:04:45] knowledge of the bible and that's what
[1:04:47] most people have they really
[1:04:49] have a a knowledge of the bible
[1:04:52] but what they lack is experience of it
[1:04:56] and that's why
[1:04:56] once you get the experience you can't
[1:04:58] walk away once you get an
[1:05:00] experience i've i experienced you cannot
[1:05:02] walk away from my experience
[1:05:04] and but the problem is why do people
[1:05:06] don't get experience
[1:05:08] is because they don't spend enough time
[1:05:11] for that experience to drop from their
[1:05:14] head into their hearts
[1:05:15] that's why it's it's a lot it's a it's a
[1:05:18] it's a lack of time of surrendering you
[1:05:21] know i remember
[1:05:22] a story where the prophet would talk to
[1:05:24] uh was
[1:05:25] uh talking about a woman a pink a
[1:05:27] believer her name
[1:05:28] a forgotten name but uh she was
[1:05:31] struggling with um
[1:05:32] with alcohol and she was at the
[1:05:35] institutions i've given her up
[1:05:37] and and um you know
[1:05:40] and she would go from church to church
[1:05:43] just trying to
[1:05:44] get rid of this this habit in a lot in
[1:05:47] their life
[1:05:48] um and and it took so she finally comes
[1:05:52] up to
[1:05:53] uh the prophet and the prophet asks her
[1:05:55] to pray
[1:05:56] about this this situation so she prays
[1:06:00] maybe for five minutes and she comes
[1:06:02] back to the prophet says i believe
[1:06:04] something has changed
[1:06:05] and the prophet goes like nothing has
[1:06:07] changed in you
[1:06:08] go back and pray and and and the prophet
[1:06:13] and the woman uh prays prays for more
[1:06:15] time and comes back the prophet
[1:06:17] and and and he he tells he he tells her
[1:06:20] again
[1:06:21] go back and pray what you know and then
[1:06:24] she goes
[1:06:25] until she breaks through she takes
[1:06:28] she took time to really not
[1:06:31] to not uh something hap
[1:06:34] something hap it's an experience where
[1:06:37] what you've always known
[1:06:39] becomes a reality to you what you've
[1:06:42] always have heard
[1:06:43] becomes a reality and now you are doing
[1:06:46] things
[1:06:47] um automatically and many times
[1:06:51] faith is actually as the prophet would
[1:06:53] say it's unconscious
[1:06:55] what your real you is your uncon
[1:06:58] it's your subconscious and that's well
[1:07:01] that's why many times
[1:07:02] many people believe in this the
[1:07:05] conscious level
[1:07:06] you know they think they believe but
[1:07:08] what but
[1:07:10] the way you know that you believe is
[1:07:13] when things get hard
[1:07:16] and you see what is in you then
[1:07:20] that's that's that's the real you like
[1:07:22] that in the real you is not your
[1:07:25] your your conception of your sincerity
[1:07:28] your the real you is not you know what
[1:07:31] you oh i heard this in in church
[1:07:33] i i really believe that's not the real
[1:07:35] you the real you is
[1:07:36] when the devil comes and challenges that
[1:07:40] and there's something there that that
[1:07:42] tells you
[1:07:43] that i i i can't do that
[1:07:47] i can't go there with you i can't
[1:07:49] there's
[1:07:50] there's something that that that
[1:07:52] triggers you just
[1:07:53] to to uh that that is a real
[1:07:57] the real you when you have a
[1:08:00] when somebody says something bad about
[1:08:02] you what
[1:08:03] what rises up is it
[1:08:06] your old self or is it a new life that
[1:08:09] actually
[1:08:10] abides now um same message
[1:08:14] the one is intel uh intelligence
[1:08:17] or um the the
[1:08:20] intellectual is hungering
[1:08:24] he he is feasting on god but his
[1:08:27] feast does not hold the other seems to
[1:08:30] have victory all the time
[1:08:32] there's nothing that bothers them
[1:08:34] they're solid they're anchored as
[1:08:36] they can be no trials no storm brother
[1:08:41] uh brothers bothers them at all
[1:08:44] but they seem to have something about
[1:08:46] them that some p
[1:08:48] us that some who are christians
[1:08:51] try to live for god um
[1:08:54] admire that type of christian and
[1:08:57] i've uh i i've often wondered
[1:09:01] lord what is it that makes people
[1:09:04] um has um
[1:09:08] lord what is it that these people
[1:09:11] has that others pray so much and yet
[1:09:15] feel to have
[1:09:17] uh yet seem to fail to get it
[1:09:21] um and and that's and that's a question
[1:09:24] one
[1:09:24] uh that that um you know
[1:09:27] obviously uh dealing with right now what
[1:09:30] makes
[1:09:31] uh some christians
[1:09:34] really achieve that
[1:09:38] solid place in their life where they're
[1:09:40] unshakable
[1:09:41] nothing seemed to happen there's no you
[1:09:43] know one of the most hurtful places you
[1:09:45] can be
[1:09:45] is actually church that's actually it
[1:09:48] and it's it's meant to be that way
[1:09:51] because it's meant to test you
[1:09:52] everything if
[1:09:54] if you still have complexes oh church
[1:09:56] you bring them out
[1:09:58] because somebody is you will say
[1:10:00] something do something
[1:10:02] that really will challenge you
[1:10:06] really will hurt you and and that's
[1:10:08] that's
[1:10:09] and that's why god wants us to still
[1:10:11] come to church
[1:10:12] because it's a place where it challenges
[1:10:15] what we we think we believe
[1:10:17] many times um
[1:10:20] and say uh same message i've met people
[1:10:23] who
[1:10:24] stand in church and rejoice and will
[1:10:27] seem to get out of the
[1:10:28] the church uh maybe on monday or tuesday
[1:10:31] um and just uh unbelieving
[1:10:35] uh or uh living on behalf
[1:10:40] be having or becoming to christian
[1:10:44] and the man or the woman would
[1:10:47] will make it uh will be would would turn
[1:10:50] again and shake your hand
[1:10:51] and say i don't mean to do those things
[1:10:53] i feel sorry for them
[1:10:55] you you see people accept divine healing
[1:10:58] oh yes
[1:10:58] it is is the word oh i believe it lord i
[1:11:01] believe it
[1:11:02] and the goal right for a
[1:11:05] few days and the first storm that
[1:11:08] strikes
[1:11:10] god uh and and um
[1:11:13] they're back they they go again you know
[1:11:15] this it's true
[1:11:17] and people can't help it it's something
[1:11:21] so what is it about what causes these
[1:11:23] things to happen
[1:11:25] you know and any if you if you watch
[1:11:27] your life your life will tell you
[1:11:29] the fruits of your life will tell you
[1:11:31] what you are
[1:11:33] when a storm happens what is your
[1:11:36] how do you cope with it many times what
[1:11:38] the devil wants you to do
[1:11:40] is to use you know back open mechanisms
[1:11:44] you know such as entertainment such as
[1:11:47] you know instead of
[1:11:48] spending that time with uh with the lord
[1:11:51] and and dealing with him
[1:11:59] amen
[1:12:05] same message
[1:12:08] now you truly have two different
[1:12:11] faculties
[1:12:12] you have one of them that is in your
[1:12:14] head
[1:12:16] by your brain and you have another one
[1:12:19] that is in your heart
[1:12:20] which is called the soul and
[1:12:23] the soul now they are so much
[1:12:28] now they are so much in disagreement
[1:12:30] many times
[1:12:31] when the heart seems to say something
[1:12:33] the soul wanders at it
[1:12:35] is it's it's uh it that at it if it's
[1:12:38] right
[1:12:40] but when it comes into the soul the the
[1:12:42] head seems to be
[1:12:44] uh the head seems to step back and
[1:12:48] that's where we want to be all these all
[1:12:51] these uh
[1:12:52] uh concepts we've been hearing for
[1:12:54] genera uh for for years now
[1:12:56] we want that to drop into the soul we
[1:12:59] want it to not be
[1:13:00] something that is in in just in our
[1:13:03] mental faculties
[1:13:05] we want it to be something that is
[1:13:07] something that is real
[1:13:10] amen i wrote a couple of uh
[1:13:14] notes as well here
[1:13:17] just uh wanted to deal with a few things
[1:13:19] before
[1:13:20] we just turned the service over
[1:13:25] um
[1:13:29] you know and one i just wanted to do
[1:13:32] deal for
[1:13:32] uh some some different uh traumas
[1:13:36] that could uh that that do happen
[1:13:40] to a believer you know one of them being
[1:13:44] the the trauma of not
[1:13:49] um the the the trauma of
[1:13:53] seemingly on prayer unanswered prayers
[1:13:58] you know it's
[1:14:01] it's a it's an odd subject but i believe
[1:14:03] it's true because many people
[1:14:06] the truth is we can be offended even at
[1:14:09] god
[1:14:10] um let's take the the story of john the
[1:14:13] baptist
[1:14:14] he finds himself offended at god why
[1:14:17] because
[1:14:18] he did everything what the that the lord
[1:14:20] want him to do
[1:14:22] but he still finds himself in a
[1:14:23] situation where he is
[1:14:26] he's caged up you know um jesus is doing
[1:14:29] what
[1:14:30] he uh you know he uh has a
[1:14:33] uh jesus is doing what uh john has
[1:14:37] always said he would do
[1:14:38] but it seems like jesus is not coming
[1:14:40] there and taking
[1:14:42] john from that situation and that
[1:14:45] actually causes a complex
[1:14:47] when you see when you see uh
[1:14:50] uh you know you have something in your
[1:14:53] heart
[1:14:54] that you're bringing up to the lord and
[1:14:57] he it seems like he doesn't answer it
[1:14:59] right away
[1:15:01] you know i mean the the things of god
[1:15:03] sometimes um many times take time
[1:15:06] you know and and and i i remember being
[1:15:10] um being in school and
[1:15:13] i actually um
[1:15:17] one of one of my biggest prayers
[1:15:20] was was uh uh you know just
[1:15:24] praying for god to give me academic
[1:15:26] success
[1:15:27] um i was i came to this country kind of
[1:15:30] uh later in um well not too late like
[1:15:34] uh seven years old um i found myself you
[1:15:38] know all the kids there
[1:15:40] uh in school seemed to get things much
[1:15:42] faster than i could
[1:15:44] um and then years later i found out i
[1:15:46] was i was dyslexic
[1:15:47] so basically um i had a
[1:15:51] hard time decoding um words and
[1:15:54] and which made english and comprehension
[1:15:57] uh
[1:15:58] not not not great and i would i would be
[1:16:01] constantly praying god just
[1:16:03] help me in my in my studies and you know
[1:16:07] i after a few i would call them f
[1:16:10] pluses you know uh i just
[1:16:13] got frustrated with all all these things
[1:16:16] i got a plus it was
[1:16:18] f plus but it's a plus uh and
[1:16:21] and and it was just like god why why did
[1:16:24] you put me in this situation
[1:16:27] why why am i i found myself isolated
[1:16:30] not doing well in school uh
[1:16:33] not having friends in school trying to
[1:16:35] live a christian life that's all i had
[1:16:37] and i'm like what's what's wrong with
[1:16:41] with you know i go to church in the
[1:16:44] these i see all these promises that the
[1:16:46] lord promised
[1:16:48] and then i go to uh to uh uh
[1:16:51] to school and and nothing seems to be
[1:16:53] working right
[1:16:55] and it took it took uh i think
[1:16:59] a complex buildup um
[1:17:03] because of that and
[1:17:06] in in and what i found was this
[1:17:10] when when it's not god's time
[1:17:14] it's just not gonna work out you know
[1:17:18] when it's not god's time it's it
[1:17:21] you know if if god um you know god was
[1:17:24] waiting for moses to come of age
[1:17:28] if the uh the people of israel will have
[1:17:30] uh prayed and fast or whatever
[1:17:32] it did not matter because the prophecy
[1:17:34] said 400 years
[1:17:35] that's right so many times we pray for
[1:17:38] maybe we pray for revival maybe we pray
[1:17:40] for
[1:17:40] uh our friends and loved ones or
[1:17:43] whatever but it's
[1:17:44] not god's time yet but what i would say
[1:17:48] is that
[1:17:49] even if the prayer is not being answered
[1:17:52] immediately
[1:17:53] it doesn't mean god is not answering i i
[1:17:57] tell you i only say this to the glory of
[1:17:59] god
[1:17:59] you know at 16 years old
[1:18:02] or 17 years old um
[1:18:06] my teachers were under the impressions i
[1:18:08] was reading
[1:18:09] i wasn't i was memorizing words just
[1:18:12] like each word
[1:18:13] was a each word it was a um
[1:18:17] a different character like a symbol you
[1:18:19] just think of about
[1:18:20] that way um and i had no
[1:18:24] ability to just to be if it was a new
[1:18:27] word
[1:18:27] there was no way for me to break it down
[1:18:29] because you know i didn't have the
[1:18:31] uh all the the rules of um
[1:18:35] uh uh you know of just breaking down a a
[1:18:38] word down i just i couldn't do it it
[1:18:39] just
[1:18:40] that's dyslexia you just just can't do
[1:18:42] it and
[1:18:44] and god super uh supernaturally
[1:18:47] uh brought um you know
[1:18:50] one day my my my my mom was
[1:18:54] was uh was reading the article
[1:18:57] and they were just describing the
[1:18:59] condition i had
[1:19:00] you know like basically uh dyslexics
[1:19:04] you know we tend to do great in science
[1:19:07] math and
[1:19:08] and things of that nature but you know
[1:19:10] and some people you actually think
[1:19:12] that uh we're you know i guess
[1:19:16] a gifted in some areas but this is a
[1:19:19] uh by when it comes to reading like i'll
[1:19:21] give you example like einstein was
[1:19:22] dyslexic it's well-known
[1:19:24] um but um um and
[1:19:27] but he couldn't it took my while to
[1:19:30] actually read
[1:19:31] but he could do all the math in the
[1:19:32] world right and physics
[1:19:34] so but god
[1:19:38] brought me to uh uh you know uh
[1:19:41] uh brought this article to my mom and
[1:19:44] and we discovered that we're just
[1:19:45] i'm dyslexic and uh i'm going to a uh
[1:19:48] uh you know to a another
[1:19:52] psychologist and mind you all off of my
[1:19:54] life i've gone through so many
[1:19:55] so many psycho because uh psychologists
[1:19:58] and neurologists to see what's what was
[1:20:00] wrong
[1:20:01] so this is another individual that and i
[1:20:04] was tired of it because they they make
[1:20:05] you play with little puzzles to check
[1:20:06] check your intelligence
[1:20:08] and it's like okay this is a triangle
[1:20:09] could you match it up with a triangle
[1:20:11] i'm like yeah
[1:20:12] thank you like i'm fine so uh
[1:20:15] so i was i was thinking it was one of
[1:20:17] these things again so
[1:20:19] um i i go there and for
[1:20:22] and for the first time they actually got
[1:20:24] what was wrong with me
[1:20:26] and they're they were showing me you
[1:20:29] know
[1:20:30] uh really decipher discerning what was
[1:20:33] going on and
[1:20:34] and it was such a relief to know what
[1:20:35] was what was going on and
[1:20:38] and eventually i got placed into the
[1:20:39] school where they basically taught me
[1:20:42] uh junior year uh basically in the
[1:20:45] summer
[1:20:46] i learned how to read for lack of that
[1:20:47] word um
[1:20:49] see uh then i went uh finished junior
[1:20:52] year
[1:20:52] um then went to uh as a senior and then
[1:20:56] i went to college um
[1:20:58] and you know uh i actually did pretty
[1:21:01] good in college it was it was very
[1:21:02] strange
[1:21:03] i i never wrote an essay until i got in
[1:21:05] college
[1:21:07] you know my first like a good essay you
[1:21:09] know because
[1:21:10] of the essays that i would write there
[1:21:12] would be more corrections
[1:21:14] than what i wrote in high school
[1:21:17] but for some reason you know god gave me
[1:21:20] so much
[1:21:20] favor that i actually became you know
[1:21:23] pretty pretty good and i'm just saying
[1:21:25] this for the
[1:21:26] glory of god um and and nowadays you
[1:21:30] know
[1:21:30] he he placed me in a career that really
[1:21:33] works for me uh
[1:21:34] uh i just you know work in i.t
[1:21:38] and i work with uh i
[1:21:41] work with a bunch of ophthalmologists or
[1:21:43] uh eye doctors
[1:21:45] and i basically train them for like a
[1:21:47] word
[1:21:48] uh which is very different
[1:21:51] but you know like and you know it's you
[1:21:53] know i train them in different clinical
[1:21:56] applications
[1:21:57] um and you know just kind of own that
[1:22:00] department
[1:22:02] i'm just saying that for the glory of
[1:22:03] god because
[1:22:05] when it's god's time god was listening
[1:22:08] to all his prayers
[1:22:09] i remember my my mom you know god given
[1:22:12] her
[1:22:12] scriptures you know i will take care of
[1:22:15] you i will take care of your son
[1:22:17] i'll i'll take care of all this gun uh
[1:22:19] this situation
[1:22:20] and those and that trial you know
[1:22:25] uh taught taught me to be dependent on
[1:22:28] christ
[1:22:29] and many times god gives you a burden
[1:22:32] something that is constantly bothering
[1:22:33] you
[1:22:34] and that actually turns out to be the
[1:22:37] best thing that ever
[1:22:38] happened to you because now i don't rely
[1:22:41] on my intelligence i don't rely
[1:22:44] on uh figuring things that figure things
[1:22:48] out
[1:22:49] it made me to rely on unjust
[1:22:53] on revelation it made me rely on the on
[1:22:56] god it made me
[1:22:57] know that if god if if god brings a
[1:23:00] problem he
[1:23:01] he already has a solution to it
[1:23:04] and and when he opens it nobody can
[1:23:07] close it and when he opens it
[1:23:08] it's like what what you know
[1:23:11] you know all my siblings they
[1:23:15] you know they were uh they they did
[1:23:18] amazing in school like uh and
[1:23:21] now that we look back let's just say the
[1:23:24] first is
[1:23:25] the last shall be first let's just say
[1:23:27] that way
[1:23:28] because of god god's provision and i
[1:23:31] only say that's the glory of god
[1:23:33] um i i prefer not even saying that
[1:23:35] testimony because sometimes i'm
[1:23:36] embarrassed about it
[1:23:37] but um just you know like but
[1:23:41] i know but my point is irregardless of
[1:23:44] what you're dealing with
[1:23:46] god will bring you out of it you know
[1:23:49] and many times the toughest things that
[1:23:51] you go through
[1:23:52] are actually the best things that you're
[1:23:54] going through you you might you might
[1:23:56] you never liked the trial i i hated
[1:23:58] every minute of it
[1:24:00] but now i'm i i'm so grateful
[1:24:04] that he he took me aside and just said
[1:24:07] you know focus because because i didn't
[1:24:10] have anything else
[1:24:10] the only thing i did was focus on the
[1:24:12] word for the lack of that word
[1:24:14] and he did that for a purpose you know
[1:24:17] um
[1:24:18] and and and and that's
[1:24:22] that's a trauma a trauma where you think
[1:24:25] that your prayer is not being answered
[1:24:27] you think that your your work all the
[1:24:30] good things that you're doing
[1:24:32] are not being answered that is a lie of
[1:24:34] the devil
[1:24:35] the things that everything you know that
[1:24:37] you every sacrifice that you've done
[1:24:39] you've done god will will reward you for
[1:24:43] it you know
[1:24:44] i it just that's a um
[1:24:47] experience that that you know
[1:24:51] i will never forget ever you know uh
[1:24:55] you know we're i believe uh a country
[1:24:59] you know will be facing even
[1:25:02] tougher times um just look at what has
[1:25:05] happened to this this country where
[1:25:07] we if we thought it was solid before
[1:25:10] there's no confidence in anything
[1:25:12] there's no confidence in your abilities
[1:25:15] there's no confidence in going to school
[1:25:16] because
[1:25:17] you know many of you were going to
[1:25:19] school and then
[1:25:21] uh i i know many people were graduating
[1:25:24] around where corona was hitting all the
[1:25:27] jobs disappeared in two seconds
[1:25:29] you know the only thing you have is
[1:25:32] christ
[1:25:34] and when when when you rely on him
[1:25:37] for your finances you know
[1:25:40] god god will bless you coming coming to
[1:25:43] church
[1:25:44] is such a privilege if you want to be
[1:25:47] successful
[1:25:48] never take a job they'll take you out of
[1:25:50] church
[1:25:52] never that's a trap of the devil where
[1:25:55] if you like i i've seen my my dad being
[1:25:58] a pastor for years
[1:25:59] we always noticed individuals that just
[1:26:02] you know pay the tithe and never
[1:26:06] you know with any um
[1:26:10] and and took every precaution to be on
[1:26:12] church
[1:26:13] whenever the door is open because that's
[1:26:15] what the prophet said whenever the door
[1:26:17] is open that's when it's your
[1:26:19] responsibility to be in church
[1:26:21] you know uh i've youth meetings uh um
[1:26:25] in my in my uh in my church in bcf
[1:26:28] i you know like i'm a little older so
[1:26:30] sometimes i'm just like you know
[1:26:32] running out of all these kids but i'm
[1:26:33] like well the doors is open
[1:26:35] i should be there you know um
[1:26:38] so perhaps uh perhaps i'm just there to
[1:26:42] to be a influence on the young people
[1:26:45] about
[1:26:46] wherever god has me um that's where i
[1:26:48] want to be
[1:26:50] um that's that's uh
[1:26:54] well i guess i guess that's those are
[1:26:56] the kind of things i i want to share
[1:26:58] today
[1:26:59] um just just want to share
[1:27:02] my heart here and and uh just
[1:27:06] just to summarize and if you didn't get
[1:27:09] because i feel like i
[1:27:10] uh repeated myself a couple of times
[1:27:13] it's just
[1:27:14] basically being honest with oneself
[1:27:17] you know one of the things i i did that
[1:27:19] i feel like was such a benefit
[1:27:21] was i wrote down a couple of um
[1:27:25] items or things in my life
[1:27:28] that i felt that god god needed to
[1:27:31] help me with you know maybe a top ten
[1:27:34] list
[1:27:35] of um uh of things
[1:27:38] that i i needed to to be dealt with
[1:27:42] and and really bring that up to and i
[1:27:44] brought up
[1:27:45] that to the lord and say god your word
[1:27:47] says this
[1:27:48] but i don't see it lining up with my
[1:27:50] life
[1:27:52] your word says you know you know forgive
[1:27:54] one another but i have uh
[1:27:56] you know uh things i have not forgive
[1:27:58] people for
[1:28:00] you know your word says this but i i
[1:28:04] see that i can be better here and it's
[1:28:07] not
[1:28:07] your it's not your responsibility to
[1:28:11] clean yourself up it's not your
[1:28:13] responsibility to
[1:28:15] um make yourself live a christian life
[1:28:18] because
[1:28:18] remember a sheep bears wool
[1:28:22] your your responsibility is to just
[1:28:24] constantly
[1:28:26] to uh to eat the the food that god
[1:28:28] prepares for you
[1:28:29] every day read your bible pray every day
[1:28:32] deal
[1:28:33] and and just keep asking god god i see
[1:28:36] that i'm not
[1:28:37] i'm not there yet yet with this this
[1:28:40] portion of my life and god will
[1:28:41] answer those kind of things and just be
[1:28:44] sincere about it
[1:28:45] you know you know we're we're the time
[1:28:48] where
[1:28:49] you know as the prophet would would say
[1:28:51] when he was going to his third pool
[1:28:54] the prophet uh and the god told the
[1:28:57] prophet you must be more sincere
[1:29:00] if he needed to be more sincere i don't
[1:29:02] even know where he needed to be more
[1:29:03] sincere
[1:29:04] but apparently he needed to be more
[1:29:05] sincere if you want to go to your next
[1:29:08] level in christ because there's
[1:29:09] different levels in christ
[1:29:12] you have to be more sincere you have to
[1:29:15] be honest with god
[1:29:16] you have to be honest with each other
[1:29:18] you know uh
[1:29:20] as the scripture says you know confess
[1:29:22] your faults to one another like
[1:29:23] you have to be honest with where you're
[1:29:26] at
[1:29:27] and you have to be honest on where you
[1:29:28] need to be
[1:29:30] so as i feel like i shared my heart and
[1:29:34] i don't want to take any more of your
[1:29:35] your time and appreciate you just
[1:29:37] allowing me to say what i need to say
[1:29:39] here let's just uh bow
[1:29:41] our heads in the word of prayer heavenly
[1:29:43] father
[1:29:46] i'm so appreciative that even now
[1:29:48] there's still
[1:29:49] young people that want to hear the
[1:29:52] things of god
[1:29:55] i'm so appreciative that
[1:30:00] you just allow me to share my heart with
[1:30:02] them
[1:30:03] [Music]
[1:30:04] knowing that these things are so simple
[1:30:07] it's not nothing deep
[1:30:08] god nothing profound
[1:30:12] but the imp the
[1:30:17] if they would take these principles
[1:30:20] and just apply it to their lives and be
[1:30:23] serious with you god
[1:30:25] they will never falter they will never
[1:30:28] fall
[1:30:30] they will never be of course
[1:30:33] we all make mistakes and we all get
[1:30:36] outlined sometimes but they'll be solid
[1:30:38] believers they'll be the the church of
[1:30:41] they're not just the church of tomorrow
[1:30:43] but the church of today
[1:30:45] and god i just pray god that you come
[1:30:48] down
[1:30:49] and just uh help them god in their
[1:30:52] challenges because it's
[1:30:54] i i've always heard a minister say that
[1:30:56] you know
[1:30:58] this is the most polluted time
[1:31:02] many times they struggle with things but
[1:31:04] it's not even their fault god
[1:31:06] it's the time and season they find
[1:31:08] themselves in
[1:31:09] it's the environment that's so
[1:31:13] sick god it's the
[1:31:16] lack of regard to your word
[1:31:20] that this called the see a
[1:31:23] generation god makes it
[1:31:26] difficult but you give us a standard you
[1:31:29] give us a word
[1:31:31] that can make them overcomers in this
[1:31:33] life
[1:31:35] that can make them victorious
[1:31:38] that can make them live
[1:31:42] a life that is worthy of the gospel it
[1:31:45] can still be done i've seen it been done
[1:31:48] i've seen many young people live lives
[1:31:52] that
[1:31:52] are very impressive why is just because
[1:31:56] they just took the time
[1:31:59] to open up your word to read the word
[1:32:02] the message from themselves to read the
[1:32:03] bible
[1:32:04] from themselves to pray for themselves
[1:32:07] god
[1:32:08] not wait for their parents not wait for
[1:32:10] their
[1:32:12] uh even their ministry which
[1:32:15] can be is very helpful but having a
[1:32:18] personal
[1:32:18] relationship with christ is even more
[1:32:21] important
[1:32:23] god i just want you to do
[1:32:27] and a work in their lives a greater work
[1:32:29] many of them
[1:32:30] have already surrendered many of them
[1:32:33] have already
[1:32:34] gave their lives to you and
[1:32:37] but there's still more land to conquer
[1:32:41] there's still more of you to gain
[1:32:44] and god i pray that we will achieve that
[1:32:47] i pray for everybody here even myself
[1:32:49] that i can walk in higher
[1:32:53] rams in christ them not
[1:32:56] stop my uh my experience
[1:32:59] by holding to this world whether it be
[1:33:02] just
[1:33:03] you know work working too much or
[1:33:06] not focusing on whatever it is god
[1:33:10] i pray that you just bless us god
[1:33:13] with clear mind minds
[1:33:16] with clear a clear vision
[1:33:20] and just a greater dedication to your
[1:33:23] to your principles god we pray all this
[1:33:26] in the name of jesus christ amen
[1:33:43] [Music]
[1:33:48] wow i had not planned to
[1:33:51] say anything but um i truly enjoyed what
[1:33:54] our brother had to say
[1:33:57] one of the things i do want to say
[1:33:58] because with all that it was said
[1:34:01] if you don't know how to pray
[1:34:05] because prayer is very important
[1:34:09] and sometimes i know that when we pray
[1:34:12] we just say little words to the lord and
[1:34:14] we actually thank that prayer
[1:34:19] one of the things that brother enoch
[1:34:21] said was
[1:34:22] that he prayed and often times when you
[1:34:26] pray you expect immediate results
[1:34:29] and sometimes you think that because it
[1:34:31] doesn't happen as fast as you think it
[1:34:33] ought to
[1:34:34] god did not hear your prayer it kind of
[1:34:37] reminded me of
[1:34:39] saul you know when
[1:34:44] samuel told him that i'll be back just
[1:34:47] wait till i get back
[1:34:48] i'm coming and because of his impatience
[1:34:53] he began to listen to what the people
[1:34:56] around him were saying and that's what
[1:34:57] we do
[1:34:59] but instead of people we listen to
[1:35:01] devils that brings lies to us and
[1:35:04] tell us that god is not going to come
[1:35:06] back and he's not going to do this that
[1:35:07] any other
[1:35:10] but i thought about the things that he
[1:35:11] said which was which is
[1:35:14] i trust that you caught it
[1:35:17] his prayers were answered
[1:35:20] but not in the time that he expected it
[1:35:22] to be
[1:35:24] and he talked about his mother receiving
[1:35:26] word
[1:35:27] and how many times we receive word from
[1:35:29] the word
[1:35:30] somebody's preaching somebody's talking
[1:35:32] and and we hear it
[1:35:34] we receive it but it doesn't come the
[1:35:36] way we want it to come
[1:35:38] in the time that we want it to come
[1:35:41] you know my mother died not seeing me
[1:35:43] saved
[1:35:44] but she prayed for me and she believed
[1:35:47] for me
[1:35:48] and before she died she told me junior
[1:35:50] you're going to be saved god's going to
[1:35:51] save you
[1:35:52] with her natural eyes she didn't see it
[1:35:54] but by faith
[1:35:55] she claimed my salvation and even though
[1:35:58] she was gone
[1:36:00] the word of god like the prophet god
[1:36:02] said if god doesn't answer here he
[1:36:04] answered there
[1:36:05] but he answered the prayer you
[1:36:08] understand me
[1:36:09] now all of the things that we have in
[1:36:11] our lives that we have been praying for
[1:36:13] don't give up on god because god don't
[1:36:15] give up on you
[1:36:17] and uh you know it's amazing because i
[1:36:20] was looking up on some things on prayer
[1:36:22] in prayer is when you begin to worship
[1:36:24] god a lot of times we
[1:36:26] we want to ask god you know for
[1:36:28] substance give me give me give me give
[1:36:30] me but a lot of times you don't get
[1:36:31] nothing because of your protocol
[1:36:34] because of your approach to god they
[1:36:36] that come to god
[1:36:38] must first believe that he is god and
[1:36:40] that he is rewarded of them that
[1:36:42] diligently seek him
[1:36:44] you know it's like the prophet god said
[1:36:47] when you're going before the judge you
[1:36:48] don't say what's up
[1:36:52] they'll throw you right out of the of
[1:36:54] the courtroom there's a protocol there's
[1:36:56] an approach that you must
[1:36:58] approach your king he's your king
[1:37:02] he's your god so you if you've ever seen
[1:37:06] movies they they tell you how to
[1:37:08] approach a king you
[1:37:09] you approach a king with praise you give
[1:37:12] him honor
[1:37:13] you know you you just laid on thick
[1:37:16] well that's if that's in the natural
[1:37:18] what about in the spiritual
[1:37:20] you and i must learn how to worship god
[1:37:23] don't get to him like he's like
[1:37:24] an errand boy talk to him praise him
[1:37:28] glorify him let him know that the
[1:37:30] changes in you have been
[1:37:32] made because of him give honor we're
[1:37:35] honors do
[1:37:36] and then when it comes to supplication
[1:37:38] that's when you begin to
[1:37:39] get into the things that you need
[1:37:42] you know i mean you when you get into
[1:37:45] supplication you know
[1:37:46] when that anointing changes because
[1:37:49] you know a lot of times when you're
[1:37:51] glorifying god you may not feel them at
[1:37:53] that moment then all of a sudden
[1:37:55] the atmosphere changes now you're moving
[1:37:57] somewhere
[1:37:58] brother branham said prayer is not that
[1:38:00] you
[1:38:02] that god comes down to you he says
[1:38:05] prayers when you go to god
[1:38:07] and in your spirit you change it's the
[1:38:10] the dimension changes the atmosphere
[1:38:12] changes
[1:38:13] because you're leaving from the earthly
[1:38:15] cares y'all know how it is
[1:38:17] i'm saying these things because if you
[1:38:19] listen to our brother enoch
[1:38:21] he gave you a lot uh
[1:38:24] and he told you testimonies and he told
[1:38:26] you things that
[1:38:27] hindered him you know he said dialect
[1:38:31] how do you pronounce that word dyslexia
[1:38:33] i've heard that word before
[1:38:34] and i've heard people who very
[1:38:36] intelligent but they struggle with
[1:38:38] a certain area you know and reading and
[1:38:41] stuff
[1:38:42] i know a doctor who's a reader you she
[1:38:44] struggled struggle struggled
[1:38:46] and yet then years later because they
[1:38:49] thought well something wrong with they
[1:38:50] thought she was dumb something's wrong
[1:38:51] with her
[1:38:52] but i don't know in her essence she was
[1:38:55] saying things backwards
[1:38:58] you know we see t h e y and she see
[1:39:01] why e however that goes i don't know but
[1:39:03] the point is
[1:39:05] once they found that the problem she was
[1:39:07] able to go forward
[1:39:09] and that's how it is in our lives a lot
[1:39:12] of times we think
[1:39:12] other people are the problems but most
[1:39:15] of the time
[1:39:16] it's because we're not praying right the
[1:39:19] problem is in your prayer life
[1:39:22] you can't be sincere if your prayer
[1:39:24] prayer life has gone wrong
[1:39:26] right i'm just going to i'm not going to
[1:39:28] take no longer a long time because we've
[1:39:29] got other
[1:39:30] services and stuff but this is what
[1:39:33] brother branham said in
[1:39:34] in the message the supernatural he said
[1:39:37] prayer is to come into an
[1:39:39] atmosphere where you realize that you
[1:39:42] are
[1:39:42] in the presence of god and you're moving
[1:39:46] to then in the deepest of sincerity
[1:39:50] first it's a worship o jehovah how i
[1:39:53] love you
[1:39:54] you see it then after worship
[1:39:58] of prayer then you come with sincere
[1:40:00] heart
[1:40:01] asking see if you abide in me
[1:40:05] and my word abiding you you can ask
[1:40:07] whatsoever you will
[1:40:09] let me read this one and imma close
[1:40:11] because i don't want to take away
[1:40:13] from what he said and i appreciate
[1:40:15] everything you did say brother
[1:40:17] i understood i saw and i could see
[1:40:20] where god was trying to take us
[1:40:22] especially young people i'm not in
[1:40:24] school
[1:40:24] and i'm so glad i'm not young like you
[1:40:26] are i don't i wouldn't want to deal with
[1:40:28] what you have to deal with your
[1:40:30] your pressure and your temptations and
[1:40:33] things that you go through is far
[1:40:34] far greater than what we what i ever had
[1:40:36] to go through
[1:40:37] um even as a man of age as i am
[1:40:41] i have my struggles in this life and i
[1:40:43] would never want my
[1:40:46] to go back and never so we do understand
[1:40:49] your struggles
[1:40:50] but then there's a greater god satan is
[1:40:53] the
[1:40:54] god of this evil where age satan is but
[1:40:57] god in satan eater
[1:40:58] is still greater than god satan in his
[1:41:00] own eden
[1:41:02] see down north all things he says now
[1:41:05] see what we we what what prayer does
[1:41:08] prayer is not exactly
[1:41:12] prayer is not exactly bringing god down
[1:41:14] to to man it's
[1:41:15] bringing man up to god as for you
[1:41:19] prayer you lose uh you lose
[1:41:22] sight of these earthly things you say
[1:41:25] you you sway out into
[1:41:28] somewhere else beyond and
[1:41:32] on and on and on and on and on until you
[1:41:34] come into his presence
[1:41:36] and then a faith that you have
[1:41:39] laid it out before god see you know
[1:41:43] and he goes on to say now think about it
[1:41:46] god heard the prayer of a man and it was
[1:41:48] elijah
[1:41:48] and elijah said it's not going to rain
[1:41:50] until i call for it
[1:41:53] you see because god listens to the
[1:41:56] mortal prayer
[1:41:57] right he says now if i say this with
[1:42:01] all my truth and reverence he says with
[1:42:04] truth and reverence
[1:42:06] he said there is not another force on
[1:42:09] earth
[1:42:10] there is nothing on earth no matter what
[1:42:13] it is what kind of gift
[1:42:15] it is there's nothing in the world
[1:42:18] that would come ahead of prayer
[1:42:22] prayer is what does the work
[1:42:27] so if you're in a dilemma if you're in a
[1:42:29] place where you feel like you
[1:42:31] your back up is against the wall that's
[1:42:34] when prayer comes in
[1:42:36] and like i said prayer ain't just saying
[1:42:38] give me give me give me
[1:42:39] prayer is worship you start off in
[1:42:41] worship
[1:42:42] then you enter into uh uh
[1:42:46] the supplication and supplication is
[1:42:48] when you have humbled yourself
[1:42:50] so much so till the spirit of god can
[1:42:53] take control of you
[1:42:55] and take you from the earthly realm into
[1:42:57] the heavenly realm
[1:42:59] you stop worrying about all of the
[1:43:01] natural things you don't see those
[1:43:02] things anymore
[1:43:03] all you see is that you're in the
[1:43:05] presence of god
[1:43:06] in some way i feel like our brother
[1:43:08] enoch with all of the
[1:43:10] he testified or told me some things
[1:43:13] of how you know he was bullied and stuff
[1:43:15] like that in school because of the stand
[1:43:17] he took
[1:43:18] and how often time he wanted to quit or
[1:43:20] give up but god
[1:43:21] scott wouldn't let him do it and no
[1:43:24] matter even so you no matter how
[1:43:25] backslidden
[1:43:26] you become if you are truly of god
[1:43:30] god will bring you back you know why
[1:43:32] because somebody greater than death than
[1:43:34] the devil prayed for you
[1:43:36] and that was jesus christ himself so
[1:43:39] be encouraged uh by the words that's
[1:43:43] been spoken
[1:43:45] be encouraged i had planned to do this
[1:43:48] later but i thought if i don't connect
[1:43:49] this with what he said
[1:43:51] you might go out here and pray
[1:43:54] but if you don't pray correctly if you
[1:43:56] don't pray
[1:43:58] you know you don't think it matters it
[1:44:00] does
[1:44:01] because when that woman you know uh said
[1:44:04] thou
[1:44:04] son of david well he was not son of
[1:44:07] david to her
[1:44:09] right but when she said lord he turned
[1:44:12] and that's how god is you must approach
[1:44:15] him in the right way
[1:44:17] to get the right results you you
[1:44:20] can you hear that so understand this man
[1:44:24] has gone through what a lot of you are
[1:44:25] perhaps going through
[1:44:27] and he's sharing with you that he made
[1:44:29] it god brought him through it
[1:44:31] all of it even when he felt so alone and
[1:44:33] rejected and i know
[1:44:35] nobody likes rejection everybody wants
[1:44:37] to be
[1:44:38] accepted everybody and it's just
[1:44:41] the way god is he god wants to be
[1:44:44] accepted he's not going to make you
[1:44:45] accept him
[1:44:47] but all of us like to be part of
[1:44:49] something
[1:44:50] but sometimes god places it in place to
[1:44:53] allow us to experience what rejection is
[1:44:56] so we can understand him better
[1:44:59] you love the lord thank you brother
[1:45:01] enoch for
[1:45:02] everything you shared with us we
[1:45:04] appreciate it
[1:45:06] this is just the beginning of a great
[1:45:08] weekend
[1:45:10] and so we thank god for his grace
[1:45:13] brother tori you have anything to say
[1:45:26] but there was an altar amen
[1:45:30] and now with the experience of years of
[1:45:32] looking on down
[1:45:33] i can see that even though god didn't
[1:45:35] answer right away that all those prayers
[1:45:37] i laid on the altar
[1:45:38] through my trials and my teenagers god
[1:45:40] has constantly answered them one by one
[1:45:43] amen amen
[1:45:47] you love the lord amen where's the song
[1:45:50] leader
[1:45:52] amen we thank god for giovanni i
[1:45:55] i just uh appreciate him
[1:45:59] god bless you brother thank you for your
[1:46:01] service
[1:46:02] and thank you amen
[1:46:06] i believe we all have been blessed by
[1:46:07] the word i know i have
[1:46:10] so let us stand so we can um get into
