liar you know but we always appreciate you god is good to us and we thank the lord for his goodness and his grace and we're trying not to be long with just god communion tonight and my wife brought it to my attention this is the last communion we're gonna have before the new years i wasn't even thinking about it things have gone by so quickly and i appreciate her reminding me i said hon i didn't remember myself i just knew we were having communion so i thank the lord for his goodness and his grace and i'm so glad to see everybody just overwhelmed with joy if i can't get it i can speak it keith is back there jumping you can't see him folks but he's jumping god is good to us amen hallelujah we we touched on a little something this morning and we'll try to finish it up we were talking about in christ amen he is our only place of worship and you know a lot of times people think it's just the presence of the lord and i'm not talking about his presence i'm talking about himself you know because a lot of times you know he can come and shower down on us but you know we want the rain cloud we want the whole thunder we want the whole voice we want everything that he possessed in us by god's grace amen so let's just turn by the grace of god amen to a passage of scripture here and as we said it's only in christ but we want to ask that you turn with us colossians 3 17 and we're not going to be long we appreciate the lord jesus christ and everything that he's doing for us everything that he's done for us we know that trying times we are in a time where there are a lot of tribulations and trials but we know that we must be tried in the fire this is all part of his process and you know i'm not going to murmur and i'm not going to complain about what he's doing because i can see the finished product you know what this is my only earnest desire to to be able to be transformed into his very image and likeness and we all are trying but we realize amen that the work that god is christ christ has begun in us he will complete it it's nothing we can do and uh we thank god for that let's turn to colossians 3 17 and read there it says and whatsoever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god and the father by him and many people reading the bible may not understand that scripture but we know that according to the book of acts jesus said that all power i believe that's the first chapter in heaven and earth is given unto him and so we understand what he means and what paul is writing when he say giving thanks to god in the father by him because if you have the revelation of who jesus christ is you understand that he is the father in creation son and redemption and the holy spirit in the church today so let us pray father god we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for being so good to us lord you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves and we pray father that you bless lord the service uh this evening as we surrender it all to you to your glory lord in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated this is why we baptize according to matthew 28 19 and and we take it all the way down to acts 2 and 38 and for those who may be listening uh we are not jesus only but we understand the the oneness of god in a different way than most people do it is a true revelation how that god can be in christ amen but the bible said god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself and showed us that the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt in jesus christ so we know that the bible also says no man have seen god at any time except the son he has declared him but when we see jesus we see him and so we notice by god's grace as we said today that there is no salvation in any other other than the name of jesus christ amen that's the bible we showed that there is no salvation in churches you say what do you mean there is you know because you're a baptist doesn't mean you're saved because you're a methodist doesn't mean you're saved because you're pentecostal doesn't mean you're saved it doesn't mean you're saved if you even consider yourself message it's whether you have applied the blood of jesus christ because without the blood there is no remission of sin and we understand the bible said he shall save you from your sins not she and so when you talk about the church we're talking about a female a she but it's he he he lamb not she lamb amen amen he was a ram amen uh caught in the thickets is that right and he was a ram amen there on calvary but we we know by god's grace amen that we need to understand what it is what he is in order to understand where we're going right because the bible says all will be deceived except those who are whose names are written in the lamb's book of life and understand so there is only one life and that is the lamb's book of life that is the lamb's life and his life is the is the life of the father is that right because jesus said amen according to uh john 10 30 i and my father are one now we understand that there is only one place and as we said it cannot be a denomination or organization and i'm not saying you know not to go to church because you need to go somewhere but you need to go somewhere where people are preaching the word and understanding is the word of god that you go to receive not the creeds not the dogmas all right not the man-made stuff amen but you must understand that you have come and you go to work go to the church to hear the word to feed on the word to consume that word because it is the word that is going to bring life to you right as we said this morning amen by god's grace that god has a certain place uh a certain place that he even met abraham and abraham worshiped and all through the testament amen and his promised word will be interpreted uh in you by him i like that so you got to understand when when god said the virgin shall concede i believe it took like 400 years before that come to pass but when it did come to pass mary did not have to work at it she was the promised word and that word quicken brought forth a virgin and that virgin's name was mary right the angel came and visited marion's told her that she would be that she would conceive and that child that she would conceive would be emmanuel we would call him jesus now according to isaiah isaiah he called him emmanuel which means god is with us and that's what i don't understand if emmanuel is god with us then who was that called jesus amen he was god with us but god just don't want to be with us he wants to be in us that is its whole purpose to be in us and when god is in us then he can begin to do the work that he had thought of in his mind before the foundation of the world this is why paul says it's not i that lives but christ that lives in me is that all right so we understand him in the word that he promised to fulfill in the the day that you're living in you will be a written epistle of god right of all men right that's what he's talking about it's not talking about you uh living in noah's day nor was that epistle nor was that word moses in his day was that word jesus in his day was that word now there's a day that we call the bride age where we must be just like him doing the same signs the same wonders hallelujah and having the same personality and characteristics of jesus christ himself is that right not what you claim but what god does through you will speak out louder than anything you could claim i like that it's not that i'm claiming to be a christian i'm living it hallelujah that is what we call a testimony when somebody can say man that guy is really a christian you know i tried him and i know he's a christian hallelujah is that right oh it's the truth shadrach meshach and abednego daniel amen what did he say daniel god is god [Laughter] why and he saw that daniel amen were and the hebrew boys in their day was willing to sacrifice you understand me they themselves became the sacrifice to prove that the invisible god that they worship was real and that he's alive and well he smoked he spoke of this age and what would be now see the believer of this age has to believe this and what he promised today you understand me just the same as they had to come into the ark to be saved go out of egypt to be saved they have to come into christ to be saved now into the word message that he's the same yesterday today and forever it's not just claiming it you've got believe it and receive it it's christ only christ alone that's the only place of worship right amen and once he comes into you then you yourself become an idol hallelujah right you become a troll trophy of christ hallelujah you love the lord and his word see you won't have to interpret it he will interpret it through you what you are doing what he promised to do the church that follows him would be so much like him until the people will know amen it won't be any guesswork it's like when god birthed the new testament church and peter and john when they were questioned about healing a man at the gate of call beautiful they said they perceived those priesthood that they were both ignorant and unlearned men but they take notice that they had been with jesus what what was it they were ignorant unlearned but others could see they had been with jesus why because they were doing the same things that jesus was doing silver and gold have i none but such as i have what was it they were the living epistles of their day they were joel two in action y'all understand me and that's what god wants us to be now we are enoch enoch was the bride of jesus christ in type you all agree with that and the bible said by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him amen but this is the key to it for before his translation huh before his translation i'ma say it again it wasn't that at his translation it was before his translation he had this testimony y'all understand me and right now this is before because we haven't been translated yet this is before the before is now that you and i are to have a tr uh uh testimony that others can see that we're different they might call you holy rollers they may call you fanatics they may call you all kinds of name but one thing for sure while they're calling you all of these names you have a testimony that you're walking with god but without faith is impossible to please god or to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a reward of them that diligently seek him how many all really believe he's god see what i'm saying you got to believe he's god people and if he's god he has the supreme authority over all things he's omnipotent y'all understand me he's the only potent kate he's the only power amen that we need to look up to hallelujah you love the lord amen we read this earlier like we said we're not going to be long but see all the epistles written in our and we are our epistles written in our where heart see we come to this building but this building really is not the church you are the church of god right you are where you you're the place in your heart right is where god wants to abide hallelujah when god abides in your heart that means the strong man is in the house and when the strong man is in the house the devil can knock all he wants to but he can't whip the throat the strong man y'all understand me in your heart he's your shelter in your heart he's your buckler in your heart he's your sword in your heart he's your defense in your heart he's your protector in your heart he's your shelter in your heart he's you're all in all he will be to you whatever you allow him to be never limit the god that's in your heart [Music] it's so easy to put him in heaven but he ain't in heaven he's here hallelujah you understand me he's on the throne of your heart we forget he's there sometimes we forget he's there but he never leaves you he said i'll never leave you nor will i forsake you and what's so awesome about it he sits on his throne and then you have the angels there guarding you protecting you amen right because you must always remember that the covenant in which he has given to us is unconditional this is the day of grace it doesn't mean we you know it doesn't give us the right to just go do whatever we want to but we know that when we do make mistakes we already have an advocate hallelujah hey i'm so thankful that when god saved me it was once and for all god doesn't have to resave me he saved me once and for all he saved you once and for all now the bible says for as much as you are manifestly declared to be the epistles of christ y'all know what that means that means that you are manifested you have declared your life is declaring what you are the manifested epistles the living word of christ manifested ministered by us written not with ink but the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart is that all right are the living bible right and this is what god is trying to tell us we are the living bible amen what does that mean manifested displaying bringing it to a place where it's clearly seen all can see who you are and what you are right what is holiness what does holy mean being holy but being holy not doesn't mean just just just uh uh declaring it it means doing things right it means to do things right to to to be a sacrifice means to give up that which is most precious to you can we do it y'all hear me giving up that thing which is most precious to you that's the way god works that's the way he operates but understand that if you give it up he'll give you more is that right abraham i need you to leave your country abraham the bible said didn't even know where he was going but he sacrificed he took his family and all and what happened to abraham in the end abraham becomes the father of nations right amen when it comes amen to sacrifices god told abraham to sacrifice his son right the most precious thing now even though abraham had lived with his wife and everything but to have a son meant that his generation was going to continue and god says sacrifice him god abraham moved at the fear of god i've seen movies where they had abraham almost fussing at god that's not real that's not the way it was because abraham was like a lamb right he followed through with god even though he didn't even know the end result but he knew that that same god amen that was able to change him from uh old to young was also able to raise up his son hallelujah is that right see and you know a lot of times people think well my reasonable service your reasonable service is doing just right you know i mean you and i can't repay god for anything he's done now i'm just talking but we can't repay him how if you had a thousand hands to praise him and clap it still wouldn't be enough you can't repay him but your reasonable services tried to conduct with all your with all that's in you conduct yourself as a christian the bible says don't even don't even suffer for being an evildoer if you suffer let it be for the name of jesus christ in other words you're going to give up what all of your bad habits you say i quit now you got to understand that has a confession confession has to come out of your mouth first then god can work with it god want to hear you say it god want to hear you declare that you're giving it up and it may not happen right then but god has heard your request and god will see to it that it disappears from you is that all right let me say it like this then god will call for an allegiance he won't self-sacrifice because when you self-sacrifice yourself you're showing you're giving god your ultimate allegiance i'll say that again self-sacrifice it's when you because when you self-sacrifice you're giving god your ultimate allegiance you know it's easy to sacrifice somebody else but when it comes to self-sacrifice that's something else because even when it came to job you know the devil says lord i cause him to curse you to you through your face and and god says yeah but i know job i trust job i have a uh uh uh trust in him and said listen devil you can do whatever you want to do but don't take his oil in his wine that's all i say i don't care what i go through just keep that holy spirit in my inside let the oil and the wine stay here you can go i can go through whatever as long as i know that god is with me but lord don't make me feel like i'm alone don't leave me lord you know you know david said lord whatever you do don't take your holy spirit away from me you see but david didn't understand that once the holy ghost is in there he never leaves you know paul says i am crucified with christ nevertheless nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me do y'all understand what what i'm working with let me put it this way you come through out of the outer court you come into the inner court now you're into the holies of holies you shut the veil behind you people won't ever see you again if you stay there the only thing they'll ever witness is the shekinah glory that's permeating out from that place you understand me when you hide in christ that means they see you no more all they see is christ and that is the way god wants it to be in our lives hello god is able this is the whole purpose of calvary is to bring us back to that place when we were hidden in christ from the beginning right and then paul says listen i do not frustrate the grace of god for as righteousness come by the law then christ is dead in vain so let's not frustrate the grace of god bringing it bringing him back into a law like your dues and your don'ts is going to save you i'll say i'm not going to frustrate the grace of god because i realize righteousness don't come by the law y'all understand me see when you when you can realize amen that you are set free god don't justify you as if you never sin in the first place every time you sin that's once and for all but it's so difficult for us to understand amen how the law of life works when the law of life is working in you you don't have to do anything it's the law of life that's working it destroys the darkness in your life not you brother i'm saying you keep drinking you keep drinking you keep drinking and that life in you will keep pushing out keep pushing out keep pushing out see if we we're just responsible for eating the word staying in the presence of god and god is responsible for bringing the change because the bible says no man can add one cubit to his statue right galatians 6 15-16 for in christ jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision what but a new creature that means your religion means nothing whether you be gentile or jew circumcised on the eighth day nicodemus you must be born again see what i'm saying so all of those things mean nothing the only thing that god is interested in as far as you and i are concerned is to see a new creature where all things are passed away and behold all things become new that's what our aim is to make sure we have become new creatures in christ right for as many as walk according to the rule peace be unto them and mercy and upon the the upon the israel of god you see what i'm saying as many as walk according to this rule what rule the rule of becoming a new creature in christ a new creature not a patched up jaw a new creature hello you love the word second corinthians 5 17 i'm just going to go through a few scriptures here because i know that today has been long we've got the your communion still but let me read this uh beginning at the 17th verse of the fifth chapter of second corinthians therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature all things are passed away and behold all things are become new the scripture cannot lie this is a is an experience that every believer must have and all things of god who have reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and have given to us the ministry of reconciliation let me ask you how do you know you're a new creature is when your appetite changes maybe you as a hog right but now you are dove right but your desire is to eat dove food you understand me that's how you know you change when you want the word when you hunger and thirst for righteousness you're changed a devil cannot hunger and thirst for righteousness a devil doesn't care but when you hunger and thirst for righteousness that means something is inside of you pulling for some food a baby something has been born in you and so now you're searching and you're looking for those things that's going to make you grow and mature is that right and all things are of god who have reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation to which that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and have committed unto us the word of reconciliation now we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you in christ's stead be reconciled to god for he have made him to be sin for us you can't get through that who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him and made being made is a process you understand me we become the righteousness of god hallelujah amen amen amen go uh turn to james now because i want you to understand uh what we go through james 1 12-15 says blessed is the man that endured temptation for when he is tried he shall receive a crown of life which the lord had promised to them that love him you will have to go through temptation and trials there's no other way remember revelations three when you've been called in in in the book of in laodicea was called to be what tried in the fire gold tried in the fire of all the ages god is calling gold and gold represents deity tried in the fire and how do we we hold fast to him right let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god for god cannot be tempted with evil neither tempted he in a man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed so there is something that's not dead yet something or spirit that you have allowed to enter in amen and uh god said when you're drawn away is your own thing that's happening but by god's grace amen god is more than able to kill the enemy right then when lusts have conceived it bringeth for sin and sin when it's finished it bringeth forth death so understand what what death is he's saying you're going to die it means at that moment you're separated is that right but brother adam said when that nature chur turns from amen a lamb to a goat say he doesn't leave you he just goes off on a limb until you repent and then that goat nature moves away and then the lamb nature comes back so it's just that separation that he's speaking of and that temporary that's a temporary separation until you repent of your sin and make things right you love the lord amen i've got one more scripture to your mind and i go back to uh romans 12 1-2 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice wholly acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world you know why i said he said reasonable service because a lot of times people say i don't do this and i don't do that and i don't do this and when you when you go on that tangent that kind of a thing you develop a self-righteousness you forget that your righteousness is of god hallelujah amen you say well i i you know i i ain't never smoking i i i've never drank but see that's still the grace of god there's a lot of people who've never smoked and never drank and still sinners right but you got to understand that if god gives you grace to overcome something it's it's so that you can give grace and mercy to others right we're here as testimonies that's why it's always good to communicate one with another because we can then in turn strengthen your brother or your sister is that right not looking down even the bible says when you see your brothers doing wrong be careful the attitude that you have because if you're not careful the thing that he's doing wrong will come upon you so god doesn't like those things we must always judge righteously and that righteous judgment is with grace mercy and truth and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of god that brings you right into the holies of holies because that is the perfect will of god for all day a transforming people a transformation among people that brings them back to the state of being that they were before the fall that's the purpose you and i are it we're the ones i'm so glad i'm one of them we're the people that god has chosen and elected to go into the holies of holies right and and so we ought to be excited about it you know it's amazing because it's amazing because esther and i'm closing but you know you think about a little esther who who nobody who even knew who she was you know and yet and still god knew and can you imagine i'm telling y'all whether y'all know that or not the people in that over in that country uh you you rarely find an ugly one it's the truth persians were beautiful people did y'all know that they were beautiful i mean i won't go into that but they were very beautiful people and to find an ugly one was was a strange thing and so what they did they went and they went and they sought for the most beautiful ones right and esther was one of those right and so but she didn't believe it i mean you know it wasn't like esther was the prettiest of all it she may have been according to the king's eyes but there were beautiful women everywhere and if you know women they always compare themselves to each other and perhaps esther felt like unworthy just to be there but nevertheless it wasn't what the king was looking at see that's what we must understand we may not have all the fancy faint dangles and all of the things that goes with the glorified church of this world but we know one thing is what we're trying to do is catch the eye of the king and as long as we catch the eye of the king we don't have to worry about nobody else because no matter how simple esther looked she was the one the king eyes caught right and so she was chosen and i can't imagine when the king began to call on her and then call on her again and the next thing you know esther was his wife understand people when god calls and he brings you into this place there is no way there is no getting away you understand what i mean there is no getting away once you have made the connection with him the word it pulls

the bread the wine in jesus christ's name we pray amen and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this dude in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup when he had sup saying this is the new testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup until of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eaten and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another if any man hunger let him eat at home that you could come together not together excuse me under condemnation and the rest i was set in order when i come those who are participating may come out [Music] [Music] when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this student
