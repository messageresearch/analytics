[20:46] long as you're fighting you know you're
[20:47] not done and I think our for His grace
[20:50] and His mercy we're trying to wind up
[20:54] the message we've been talking about
[20:57] traveling to that city and preparing for
[20:59] a new world all those good things and
[21:02] you know I just ask God today to keep me
[21:05] focus that's less less turn to the
[21:09] scripture where we'll be working with
[21:13] this evening you love the Lord acts 1
[21:22] beginning at the 10th verse acts 1 and
[21:26] 10 glad to see our brothers up I know
[21:32] it's a sacrifice appreciate your coming
[21:35] we don't get tired of you you know we're
[21:40] always happy to see you acts 1 and 10
[21:43] brother rod brother Samuel has a paper
[21:47] or some sort of thing that he has to do
[21:49] for school so he said that he would not
[21:52] be here tonight x 1 in 10
[21:57] normally I'm not so hoarse but I did
[22:00] have coffee and you don't do coffee
[22:01] before you had a preach but you know I'm
[22:08] nothing I'm not trying to be anything I
[22:11] just want God's will to be done tonight
[22:17] and while they looked steadfastly could
[22:20] you cut that down a little bit
[22:21] while they looked steadfastly toward
[22:24] heaven as he went up behold two men
[22:27] stood by them in white apparel which
[22:31] also said you men of Galilee why stand
[22:34] ye gazing up into heaven they're saying
[22:38] Jesus which is taken up from you into
[22:41] heaven shall so come in like manner as
[22:45] you have seen him go in to heaven one
[22:51] more scripture go back to st. John
[22:53] please 14
[23:07] saij on the 14th chapter we'll be
[23:13] reading from the first verse once again
[23:16] let not your heart be troubled you
[23:20] believe in God believe also in me in my
[23:23] father's house are many mansions if it
[23:26] were not so I would have told you I go
[23:29] to prepare a place for you and if I go
[23:33] and prepare a place for you I will come
[23:35] again and receive you unto myself that
[23:39] where I am there you may be also whether
[23:42] I go you know and the way you know
[23:46] Thomas said unto Him Lord we know not
[23:50] whither thou goest and how can we know
[23:52] the way and jesus said unto him I am the
[23:56] way the truth and the life no man cometh
[24:00] unto the father but by me if you had
[24:04] known me you should have known my father
[24:06] also from his fall you should know him
[24:10] and have seen him
[24:12] let us pray father God we come before
[24:16] you we thank you for your grace thank
[24:19] you for your mercy and your loving
[24:21] kindness father we pray that you bless
[24:24] the service in a special way forgive us
[24:27] of our sins and our shortcomings Lord
[24:30] give us grace to move completely out of
[24:32] your way that you might speak to your
[24:34] people tonight in Jesus Christ's name we
[24:37] pray amen amen
[24:39] you may be seated we realized Amen
[24:42] tonight that we image it's really going
[24:45] home time I was listening to the message
[24:48] according to brother branham countdown
[24:52] and seeing that we really are out of
[24:56] time sometimes we forget but if we could
[25:02] just remember that the same devil that
[25:04] conquered Egypt or the children of Egypt
[25:08] in Egypt also conquered the children of
[25:11] Egypt Israel in in the in the wilderness
[25:14] only because they forgot where they had
[25:18] been delivered from
[25:20] they had forgotten the bondage of
[25:22] Pharaoh and how hard and difficult it
[25:26] became and they forgot that it was God
[25:30] who delivered them not because of their
[25:34] goodness because of their merits as we
[25:38] can see when they got into wilderness
[25:39] they were no different from the
[25:41] Egyptians they did exactly what the
[25:44] Egyptians did they worship the same God
[25:47] that Egyptians did and so you see even
[25:51] then it was the grace of God that
[25:53] delivered them understand when God sends
[25:56] a prophet it's always the grace of God
[25:59] men we don't deserve it but it is the
[26:03] way god has determined to do things
[26:06] every time Israel got in trouble in so
[26:09] much trouble that God needed to dispatch
[26:12] a prophet because they forgot what the
[26:16] Word of God said many of them fail to
[26:19] read it or even teach it to their
[26:21] children and so therefore when you fail
[26:24] to read and fail to teach it to your
[26:25] children expect the next generation to
[26:28] be worse than you were and so that's
[26:31] what happened with Israel they didn't
[26:34] have any character about themselves amen
[26:38] every test every trial everything that
[26:40] came their way they murmured and they
[26:43] complain they had forgotten that God had
[26:47] done such a great work in Egypt and you
[26:50] know sometimes people complain so much
[26:52] till if you're not careful you as an
[26:55] individual will lose your vision
[26:58] remember when Moses got to the Red Sea
[27:01] the people had complained and given him
[27:02] so much trouble he himself lost a vision
[27:06] and lost the very understanding that it
[27:09] wasn't Moses who delivered the children
[27:11] of Israel in the first place it was God
[27:15] and but yet God had given him the
[27:18] authority and I love this because I want
[27:21] you to understand when God is in your
[27:23] life God expect to see some achievements
[27:28] I'm gonna say that again when God is in
[27:31] your life God expect to see
[27:34] achievements in your life God just don't
[27:38] give you himself for you to stand still
[27:41] is that right
[27:43] remember even when God told Adam
[27:45] throwing him out of the dust of the
[27:47] earth placed him in the Garden of Eden
[27:49] and God said it to Adam you must achieve
[27:53] this you must subdue everything but we
[27:59] see that Adam instead of achieving that
[28:02] he never did he failed and because he
[28:07] failed Lucifer or the devil took over
[28:10] his territory you understand me God
[28:13] gives us the Holy Ghost to achieve what
[28:19] the natural man cannot achieve somebody
[28:23] help me here when we think about a new
[28:26] city and like I said we talk about a new
[28:28] world we're not talking about a world as
[28:31] flesh and blood matter of fact Jesus
[28:33] told Nicodemus flesh and blood can't
[28:35] even enter into that place we must
[28:39] understand that the thing that God is
[28:41] dealing with us about is all spiritual
[28:44] and it's all about a spiritual world and
[28:47] the only way that you can get there you
[28:49] must be spiritual hallelujah the Bible
[28:53] said a man that's not even born again
[28:54] he's carnal and he can't even understand
[28:57] those things that are of God I've got a
[29:01] lot to say in a little while
[29:02] but I want to say by God's grace God he
[29:06] then took Joshua and he achieved things
[29:09] by Joshua and he told Joshua the land in
[29:12] which you're about to go in it's full of
[29:15] memorized Canaanites paradise you're
[29:18] every right there is but I want you to
[29:20] go in there and you need to conquer the
[29:22] land y'all understand me but I want you
[29:25] to also understand that wherever you
[29:27] place your feet or your foot amen it's a
[29:31] possession it is yours so what did God
[29:34] said I've given you the land but it
[29:36] takes faith to conquer it right without
[29:40] faith is impossible to please God you
[29:44] can say oh I believe this message but
[29:46] without faith you know
[29:48] never operate for you it takes faith
[29:51] which is a revelation of God that God
[29:54] gives you to conquer the land hallelujah
[29:57] is that right
[29:58] that's what Joshua and Caleb that's why
[30:00] they could come back with a great report
[30:02] they had a different spirit than the
[30:04] others and they were willing to fight to
[30:06] achieve whatever God wanted them to
[30:09] achieve you understand me
[30:11] this is why we go to school folks we go
[30:14] to school to learn and we learn to do
[30:18] what a chief to come to a reality of
[30:22] accomplishment and you and I must
[30:24] understand that God is the same way we
[30:27] are born again we're like children and
[30:30] the whole time God is teaching us and
[30:33] he's teaching us his rules his laws his
[30:36] ways the way he act the way he does and
[30:39] he's teaching us how to have faith
[30:41] because without faith it's impossible to
[30:44] please God understand by God's grace
[30:47] that that but by the walk working of
[30:50] your hand came by the fall hallelujah
[30:53] but everything that Adam was supposed to
[30:56] achieve was to come by faith that right
[31:00] by the spoken word and whatever he would
[31:04] do you can't speak the spoken where you
[31:06] say church chair moving you you don't
[31:08] have faith that the chair will move you
[31:10] must understand that by your faith you
[31:14] operate the laws of heaven yellow by
[31:18] faith you operate the laws of heaven and
[31:23] of Earth is that right it's the truth
[31:28] and you must understand that these
[31:31] achievements only comes through God
[31:35] hallelujah what good is the resurrection
[31:38] if God is not here to do something how
[31:42] would you know that Jesus Christ has
[31:45] resurrected the Bible said these signs
[31:48] shall follow them that believe is that I
[31:51] write in my name there's a cast-out
[31:53] delta yeah is that right see these are
[31:57] achievements that Christ performs or do
[32:00] through you
[32:02] right and you and I must understand all
[32:05] of these things that we are now
[32:09] achieving in Christ is to prepare us for
[32:13] the city to come I'm gonna say that
[32:16] again everything that we achieve here is
[32:21] to prepare us for the city to come is
[32:26] that right
[32:26] say give me something to hold on to
[32:29] Samuel who was a prophet here everything
[32:34] Samuel achieve in this life by being a
[32:37] prophet was because over there he was a
[32:41] prophet is that right he had to achieve
[32:44] it here to be there and because he was
[32:48] there he was then able to tell Saul and
[32:52] the Witch of Endor what God has already
[32:56] installed for them so what are you
[33:00] saying brother books we say we're bride
[33:03] where do we become bride here and if we
[33:08] are bride we have the authority of the
[33:10] word in our possession and God wants to
[33:14] see achievements hallelujah
[33:18] I'm a given example when when Ravana
[33:23] described it like this in the countdown
[33:24] he said as science developed and began
[33:29] to achieve things he said the church did
[33:32] the same thing in the spiritual realm is
[33:36] that right he talked about the horse of
[33:38] horse-and-buggy the Wesleyan days and
[33:40] all that and then he comes to the
[33:42] airplane he says he told the Pentecostal
[33:45] were different because they achieved you
[33:48] know a greater spiritual revelation that
[33:53] they could fly above the earth a little
[33:56] bit is that Alright
[33:58] he said but listen as science achieve
[34:01] things so the spiritual Church of the
[34:04] Living God achieve also now they went to
[34:08] the moon
[34:09] supposedly they went into the air
[34:11] supposedly but my point is if they were
[34:14] a Qi able to
[34:15] to achieve those things in the natural
[34:17] what are we supposed to be achieving now
[34:22] we are not supposed to be feeding with
[34:25] the chickens we are Eagles and Eagles
[34:30] cannot eat chicken food hello
[34:35] oh you can't compare the denomination of
[34:38] food with the food in which we are
[34:41] eating we're literally eating off the
[34:43] blood of bleeding Word of God we're
[34:46] eating from the bread of life hallelujah
[34:50] and because we are eating this eternal
[34:53] food it will cause us it would transform
[34:57] us hello
[34:58] it will transform us into spiritual
[35:02] beings the food transfer forms you you
[35:07] don't transform yourself it's the food
[35:11] that you're eating remember you and I
[35:16] know that the food that we're eating in
[35:18] the natural hybrid food and it makes us
[35:20] soft and dhoti and may it make you
[35:23] wonder what the spiritual the people
[35:25] that call themselves bride are eating
[35:28] hallelujah because the real food of God
[35:31] that God has given us in this day will
[35:34] call up cause us to be strong Eagles
[35:37] let me ask you something have you ever
[35:40] seen an eagle with weak eyes no you look
[35:45] at the Eagles are in their Sirius all
[35:48] times hallelujah and that's how it is
[35:53] with the Eagles today they are serious
[35:56] about the things they are to achieve
[35:59] hello
[36:01] you said well what do you mean brother
[36:02] Brooks you got to achieve a certain
[36:05] amount of faith that not only would get
[36:08] you up out of the grave but if you are
[36:10] alive and remain it will quicken your
[36:12] mortal body and take you into an
[36:15] atmosphere or another dimension it is
[36:18] the only way we're going to get there
[36:22] hmm I go to prepare a place for you and
[36:25] I love that because in the 17th chapter
[36:28] of John
[36:29] Jesus pray father would that they be
[36:31] with me out of all the things that
[36:33] brother I'm said out of all the things
[36:35] he ever asked for he has for one thing
[36:37] and that was a bride to be with him now
[36:41] you must understand by God's grace amen
[36:45] that we must go beyond Pentecost
[36:48] here's all will be on Pentecost the
[36:51] spiritual bride is the counter bride is
[36:56] not young you be the spiritual bride
[37:00] will achieve this Holies of Holies place
[37:05] is that right they will not allow
[37:09] themselves to remain in the holy place
[37:14] see in the holy place you got the seven
[37:17] golden candlesticks you got faith with
[37:19] me and rule but in the Holies of Holies
[37:22] God rules and this is what God wants to
[37:27] do with us and then he doesn't want the
[37:29] Holy Ghost just to anoint you and your
[37:31] friends or on your spirit God says you
[37:34] must achieve hallelujah is that right
[37:38] when did the veil of God rent it when it
[37:43] was at the death of Jesus and the veil
[37:46] of God would become visible to you the
[37:50] unveiling of God would become visible to
[37:52] you when you die when you come to that
[37:55] place of death God will then open up the
[37:59] portal she is open but note not anything
[38:06] can go in it you understand me
[38:11] you can't go beyond the way is that
[38:14] right if the high priest was to go
[38:17] behind that veil with sin in his life he
[38:20] would immediately die and neither can
[38:24] you and I go beyond that veil with sin
[38:28] in our lives
[38:30] hallelujah is that Alright she the Holy
[38:35] Ghost comes to identify you and I said
[38:39] that one time before we talked about a
[38:41] city we talked about a pea
[38:43] we're talking about a holy place and the
[38:44] only people that I'll ever get there is
[38:46] that right
[38:47] but Jesus said be holy for my father
[38:49] which is in heaven is holy and brother
[38:51] man said the only way we can ever be
[38:53] holy is that the holy God come on inside
[38:55] of us right amen and we must achieve
[38:58] that God just don't let it just happen
[39:02] you got to work at it
[39:05] ooh absolutely you think you don't have
[39:10] to do anything oh yeah
[39:12] God tries your faith is that right he
[39:16] said Mary and mops I want you to roll
[39:18] away the stone
[39:19] if you roll away the stone you'll see
[39:23] the resurrection two women had to roll
[39:27] away this huge stone let me tell you it
[39:31] took faith for them to do that they
[39:34] could say Oh Lord easily can say God we
[39:37] can't do that we don't have it the
[39:39] strength all the muscles to do it no
[39:41] they heard the word and they went into
[39:44] action see the moment you think about it
[39:47] is the moment you fail you can't think
[39:51] about it you can't process it you must
[39:54] do what he says do right Oh Peter
[39:58] Oh Peter you your Lord we haven't we've
[40:01] been toiling all day all day and we
[40:03] haven't caught any fish he said throw
[40:06] your net on the other side
[40:09] seee he goes beyond your reasoning or
[40:13] beyond your thinking and most of the
[40:15] time God can't use you until you become
[40:18] a failure till you get to a place to
[40:21] realize you ain't got nothing can I say
[40:24] it like that you don't have anything to
[40:27] offer God but your will it is then when
[40:34] you are perfectly weak that's when he's
[40:37] perfectly strong but as long as you feel
[40:41] like you can ask something to God God
[40:43] your work is just in vain God don't need
[40:48] that God need an empty vessel that's all
[40:51] he needs a empty vessel to use somebody
[40:55] to say I
[40:56] I yield is that all right you and I must
[41:00] understand we must and this is what I'm
[41:04] saying we must go beyond the veil we
[41:08] don't have an option if you don't go
[41:11] beyond the veil you will die
[41:15] it used to be death to go in there I'll
[41:19] stay right now is death to stay out you
[41:23] must go in there no anybody could go in
[41:26] there one time only the high priest but
[41:29] now since the blood of Jesus Christ has
[41:31] been shed his whosoever will let him
[41:35] come and every man must go beyond the
[41:40] veil and you can't go there until you
[41:43] become the sacrifice see that usually
[41:47] you have the bulls and the goats and the
[41:48] bullocks and the pigeons and all that no
[41:50] no no you the one now you must live
[41:53] yourself only ulta you must die before
[41:57] God before he can allow you to go there
[42:00] all your will all your reasoning
[42:03] everything you think you can offer God
[42:05] must die hmm
[42:09] that's the truth that was what was wrong
[42:12] with quick equipment with cane he had
[42:16] thought he could offer God something to
[42:18] to to to to qualify him for eternal life
[42:23] there is nothing you can offer God to
[42:26] qualify for eternal life what can you
[42:31] offer him no money nothing there's
[42:36] nothing there the only thing God
[42:40] requires of you is your surrender a
[42:44] surrendered life hallelujah and you
[42:49] guess what we know we cannot win it with
[42:51] a church become lukewarm guess what
[42:53] happened God moves on is that right the
[42:57] Bible says it like this God fused them
[43:00] out of their mouth out of his mouth
[43:02] right and the Pentecost is every Church
[43:05] age that got lukewarm God's peeled out
[43:08] but what about this man
[43:11] everybody that could become lukewarm
[43:13] listen it's a time of repentance it's a
[43:16] time to seek God hallelujah it's time to
[43:19] say God have mercy on me I live my life
[43:22] down hallelujah

[45:11] that a little booklet I read I must have
[45:12] been in the third or fourth grade I can
[45:16] see it almost in my in my mind but they
[45:20] said even then in a little booklet I
[45:22] read this

[45:32] coming our way

[46:25] that you're fighting witchcraft it is
[46:27] highest full word absolutely and I'm
[46:33] gonna tell you something a lot of these
[46:35] churches got witches in them and you
[46:37] know what the preachers are not smart
[46:38] enough don't even know how to discern
[46:41] the difference between the two I'm no
[46:43] fool I know how to pray y'all think I'm
[46:49] crazy I know what I'm talking about
[46:52] I don't worry about witches nor warlocks
[46:56] you know why because God got it all
[46:58] under control
[47:00] see they came to you and they came here
[47:04] to me if God has predestinated us to
[47:07] make a rapture
[47:08] what devil gonna stop it that's what
[47:13] they're trying to do you cannot stop the
[47:16] resurrection it is what it is and God
[47:24] has already numbered the days of these
[47:28] witches y'all think I'm crazy
[47:31] you watch people gonna start dying he
[47:33] goes there what's wrong with them
[47:36] he already you know what God talks to me
[47:41] in prayer and I'm gonna tell you
[47:43] something these people who think they
[47:44] doing things behind these they think God
[47:47] don't see them God sees it all you know
[47:50] I look at these things and I said what
[47:52] you talking about brother Brooks I know
[47:53] y'all don't know what God knows this
[47:55] this God knows but my point is I want
[47:59] you to be aware because you need to know
[48:01] warfare
[48:03] what is warfare pray our prayer if you
[48:11] don't know how to pray the devil got you
[48:14] and the thing about it is people are so
[48:18] spiritual they think because they you
[48:20] know it's just like up there in Canada
[48:21] when they used to say oh they were
[48:23] speaking in tongues and people thinking
[48:25] they had the Holy Ghost barking like a
[48:27] dog come on
[48:29] what Holy Ghost go to bark like a dog
[48:31] that is not the Holy Ghost I don't care
[48:35] how good it feels
[48:37] hello a dog is an unclean thing and God
[48:40] do not tie himself with a unclean thing
[48:43] as such I don't know God got me here
[48:48] it's guaranteed people don't even know
[48:54] that pornography is a form of witchcraft
[48:58] it is what it is and you when you under
[49:02] that spell it is what it is it is a
[49:05] spell and if you don't confess it and
[49:08] make it right before God you will go to
[49:10] hell with that same thing that's how
[49:15] powerful it is it's witches warlocks
[49:19] demon power right straight from Hell
[49:23] trying to take you there what's
[49:26] happening I'm saying you God allow you
[49:28] to fall into it so he knows you can
[49:30] achieve a successful you get out of it
[49:34] not by power nor by might but by my
[49:37] spirit saith the Lord God will deliver
[49:40] you out of all of that but you can't
[49:43] think we are somehow he'll help me out
[49:45] no sir
[49:46] God is looking for desperation
[49:49] you must be desperate you know the thing
[49:53] about it
[49:54] people think that brothers are the only
[49:56] one that falls into that know nowadays
[49:58] you get more sisters looking at that
[50:00] nasty stuff then you do men whoo y'all
[50:03] didn't know that oh yeah this is this is
[50:06] the new world we're dealing with and let
[50:08] me tell you something every you don't
[50:12] fault people what I'm trying to say is
[50:13] this and God knows amen
[50:16] that everything how can you walk the
[50:20] streets you can't even go to the grocery
[50:21] stores the books are already there
[50:28] they're there
[50:30] what we see now was considered
[50:33] pornography in my day we didn't see that
[50:41] kind of stop bikinis oh let me stop let
[50:45] me go on I'm saying these things because
[50:48] I know what I'm saying is everywhere
[50:52] it's everywhere better books y'all you
[50:57] know people don't listen to you on the
[50:58] only thing I don't care the truth is the
[51:01] truth you have to fight you've got a
[51:09] fight to get out of that don't you even
[51:12] think the devil's gonna just let you out
[51:14] easily hmm you and I must understand by
[51:25] God's grace who we are that's the only
[51:28] way you'll be able to set your goals if
[51:31] you can get to you can make the devil
[51:33] you let the devil thank you or I'm just
[51:35] a sinner saved by grace that's all
[51:37] you're going to be you and I must
[51:40] reprogram or let the Bible reprogram us
[51:43] you and I must let God wash us away from
[51:47] the filth of the flesh and the filth of
[51:50] the mind only God can do that but we
[51:53] need to let God do that and we need to
[51:56] let God let it make bring a revelation
[51:59] that we are the sons and daughters of
[52:01] God
[52:02] the Bride of Christ we have a right we
[52:10] have a right and God want us to defeat
[52:13] the devil in his Eden is that right what
[52:24] I'm trying to say I had a precious
[52:27] brother called me today and he just
[52:29] having such battles in that area that's
[52:31] what one of the things that made me
[52:33] think about that and you know he's
[52:35] nowhere in this state he's in another
[52:37] state but he's having a hard time you
[52:39] know what was so bad about it
[52:41] he has a hard time even finding a godly
[52:45] sister in the message hello and he ain't
[52:50] black he's white now says understand me
[52:54] it's more white people in this message
[52:56] here in America then it is black y'all
[52:58] don't know what I'm saying
[52:59] I went everywhere in the world trying to
[53:02] find black people map for my family to
[53:04] marry I did I got tired but I did you
[53:13] understand me but when you got you got
[53:16] white sisters everywhere and you white
[53:19] and you can't find a decent bride
[53:22] something's wrong with the picture
[53:24] that's all I'm saying
[53:25] and you cannot marry somebody because
[53:29] they're your color well let me tell you
[53:35] what if I saw if I had it where I was
[53:37] the only black man in the world and it
[53:39] was the only black woman in the world
[53:40] and she had no character I live single I
[53:46] live single am I making sense why you
[53:50] why about again yeah y'all look strange
[53:52] when I say black and white y'all don't
[53:53] know colors it's real if you are I'm
[53:58] free because I know I'm not prejudiced
[54:00] right and I'm trusting you on either but
[54:03] if you are we'll pray for you my point
[54:06] is you and I must understand it's real
[54:10] and don't ever ever let yourself get
[54:14] that low because I've seen people do it
[54:16] it doesn't work you love the Lord can I
[54:23] go on we're the family of God and you
[54:27] and I must understand we have power is
[54:31] this alright understand me the
[54:33] revelation of Pentecost gave those
[54:37] people so much power and authority they
[54:40] had they seen the eyes of the blind open
[54:43] they seen dead raised they see miracle
[54:46] after miracle after miracle and each
[54:49] page gained more power and more
[54:52] authority and the bride come on somebody
[54:57] she's got more power than the
[55:00] Pentecostals hallelujah why if she can
[55:04] only die to herself
[55:06] gotta use her by way of the spoken word
[55:09] but you got a rot because God don't need
[55:13] your opinions he needs somebody that's
[55:17] going to submit and surrender
[55:19] hello you see brother banner was a was a
[55:23] covenant angel he wasn't just a
[55:25] messenger
[55:26] he brought a covenant just like the
[55:29] first John the Baptist right hallelujah
[55:33] our covenant is different from the
[55:36] Pentecostal covenant our our our our
[55:41] birth our we're up the ladder put it
[55:45] that way and we're right at the end call
[55:49] seven and the next thing is zero or
[55:53] eight how do you want to say it blast
[55:56] off
[55:58] but God cannot move the rocket until the
[56:03] bride of Jesus Christ get in her
[56:06] position where's the authority of this
[56:11] age not the devil somebody help me here
[56:15] is that right when Jesus conquered death
[56:19] hell and the grave and he brought back
[56:22] amen the redemptive the purchase of the
[56:26] redemption it brought us back to a
[56:28] perfect
[56:30] in the eyes of God Satan is no longer at
[56:35] rule in this Eden the bride of Jesus
[56:38] Christ is to rule in his Eden is that
[56:42] right he ruled in ours when Adam and Eve
[56:46] failed God kicked him out because he did
[56:49] not want the devil to rule there but
[56:52] because of the failure of Adam Satan had
[56:55] a right to rule I said not in here y'all
[57:01] better understand me in this kingdom
[57:04] Satan does not rule and that's the
[57:10] challenge that's where God wants us to
[57:13] work and achieve things in him but it
[57:15] only comes by faith is that right y'all
[57:19] think brother Branham just obeyed
[57:21] everything God told him to do God fix it
[57:24] until he did y'all understand me and God
[57:28] gonna fix it until you do when you and I
[57:31] do not do as God wants us to do he gonna
[57:35] spank you and correct you until he can
[57:37] get you to humble yourself hallelujah he
[57:41] wants you to humble yourself him because
[57:44] he wants to use you but he can't use you
[57:46] when you in and out and in and out and
[57:48] in and out he can't do it James says it
[57:53] to be double-minded you unstable in all
[57:57] your ways God can use that he needs some
[58:01] stability hallelujah is that right
[58:05] remember brother man talks about the
[58:07] little boy who won the bicycle contest
[58:10] right he said those guys what other guys
[58:13] were so skilful and everything else and
[58:16] this little boy he said all he knew is
[58:18] to keep his eyes straight on the end and
[58:21] they had to cross this little board on
[58:24] the bike and everybody was different
[58:26] ones was falling off the bike and he was
[58:28] the one they they called him a little
[58:29] they thought nothing was to him
[58:31] this boy is just weak he's a little
[58:33] but one thing about this boy he
[58:35] said when he they asked him after he won
[58:38] the contest they asked him how did you
[58:42] do it he said
[58:43] what I did I focused on the end and I
[58:47] wouldn't look to the left nor right
[58:49] I just kept straight hallelujah and
[58:52] that's what brother battle said he said
[58:54] that's what we need to do focus on the
[58:57] in don't look to the left or the right
[58:59] keep looking at the end receiving the
[59:03] end of your salvation hallelujah all
[59:08] these distractions you don't even
[59:10] understand what the devil is doing he
[59:12] distracting you got you worried about
[59:13] this and got you oh and I've only do
[59:15] this and hi I got problems too but I
[59:18] know the problem solver and like they
[59:21] say you can't get blood out of a turnip
[59:23] don't come knocking on my door for bills
[59:26] cuz I ain't got the money you can't get
[59:30] it to Jesus give it to me y'all
[59:33] understand me why should I worry about
[59:35] it if you ain't got it how you gonna do
[59:38] it but I know one thing if you get down
[59:41] into prayer you get in prayer God coming
[59:45] t realized every bit of money you need
[59:48] don't tell me you can't cuz I don't have
[59:51] it I I was in the Pentecostal church one
[59:53] day and I I was praying before that's
[59:55] when I you know especially when you're
[59:56] singing you're praying fast all the time
[59:58] but I was praying and fasting all the
[1:00:01] time during that time needed some money
[1:00:03] because I was in college and everything
[1:00:04] else and then you know on my knees I
[1:00:07] didn't even ask God he said today I'm
[1:00:09] gonna bless you with some money well I
[1:00:12] thought it was going to come through the
[1:00:13] mail didn't come I thought somebody was
[1:00:16] gonna knock on my door they they never
[1:00:19] knocked I was on my way to church and it
[1:00:21] started raining and there was a little
[1:00:24] store or country look store on the side
[1:00:26] I had to stop there and wait to the rain
[1:00:28] stop and as I was going up the hill
[1:00:31] because the church stood up on the hill
[1:00:33] the Lord spoke to me and says did not
[1:00:34] promise you some money
[1:00:35] I said yes Lord he said look down I
[1:00:38] looked down and there it was the rain
[1:00:42] held it in place I don't know who lost
[1:00:45] it but I do know who found it yeah they
[1:00:50] come crazy oh it's the truth just the
[1:00:55] other day I rebuked that devil up buying
[1:00:57] my financials and everything I said you
[1:00:59] are liya Baba and you know I can't
[1:01:02] remember all I said and and and and to
[1:01:04] be honest with you the very next day I
[1:01:06] received armed alone in the mail no you
[1:01:14] don't need to know how much it was but
[1:01:16] it was more than what I had somebody
[1:01:19] help me in and I thought Lord this is
[1:01:22] just a little bit coming on come on
[1:01:24] bring it on y'all understand me
[1:01:27] you control you you you you you stop
[1:01:29] worrying and fretting about things and
[1:01:31] God supplies all needs but we have not
[1:01:35] could we ask not and you know what
[1:01:38] sometimes we just don't believe he can
[1:01:40] do it but God can do all things
[1:01:44] hallelujah amen that's the kind of city
[1:01:49] we live we're going to nothing is
[1:01:52] impossible there and the Bible says now
[1:01:54] we're sitting in heavenly places in
[1:01:56] Christ Jesus if I'm sitting in heavenly
[1:01:59] places in Christ Jesus that means
[1:02:01] whatever I desire whatever I need as
[1:02:03] long as I'm in the spirit and will of
[1:02:06] God it is mine
[1:02:08] I just believe it that way I was head
[1:02:14] where's the wise and where is the scribe
[1:02:16] where is the disputer of this world have
[1:02:20] not God made foolish nation wisdom of
[1:02:23] this world but after that in the wisdom
[1:02:25] of God the world by wisdom knew not god
[1:02:28] it pleased God by the foolishness of
[1:02:32] preaching what I'm preaching right now
[1:02:34] to the natural man economy it sound
[1:02:37] foolish hallelujah but what what is more
[1:02:45] foolish when I'm talking about a
[1:02:46] resurrection with people that died and
[1:02:48] around it for years and I'm telling you
[1:02:50] they gonna get up hallelujah that's
[1:02:54] foolish little wise man I can
[1:02:57] Christianity state shut the stuff was
[1:02:59] that
[1:02:59] why is God who said it and we believe it
[1:03:05] like I said everybody tell me I'm
[1:03:07] seeking you know we got all got problems
[1:03:09] God always
[1:03:10] yes it's time to to unfold himself but
[1:03:13] listen I don't care how sick a man is if
[1:03:16] he believed God has healed him he's
[1:03:19] healed God gonna raise him up God will
[1:03:22] never let his words fail when he knows a
[1:03:25] man have faith in Him
[1:03:27] did you know that God will heal if a man
[1:03:30] has its appointed time to die a certain
[1:03:33] time god I healed him before he take his
[1:03:36] life hello y'all know that's happened
[1:03:41] before people who brother Brad and pray
[1:03:44] for God healed them and because it was
[1:03:47] their time they had to go hmm that's how
[1:03:51] it is
[1:03:52] let me tell y'all something God will
[1:03:54] never let his word fall to the ground
[1:03:56] whether you believe it or not he gonna
[1:03:58] find somebody who gonna believe it I've
[1:04:07] said let no man glory in men and how
[1:04:10] come we do that all over the message we
[1:04:13] glory oh this man can do this and this
[1:04:19] man can do that you know I really hate
[1:04:22] that you go there you know I go to the
[1:04:24] hominy whoo brother you came and I'm
[1:04:27] like Lord Jesus help me I have to pray
[1:04:29] every time before I get up to sing you
[1:04:32] know why because I need to move out of
[1:04:34] the way I need to die people be puffing
[1:04:38] you up it's okay to give compliments
[1:04:39] every now and again but you know some
[1:04:41] people get to a place where they almost
[1:04:42] worshipping you some of y'all don't know
[1:04:45] what that feels like but let me tell
[1:04:50] like that why you think I'm hoping that
[1:04:54] over here in Iowa you have no idea what
[1:04:58] I've gone through I'm right I got to run
[1:05:00] from people a lot of preachers ain't got
[1:05:03] enough sense they let them worship them
[1:05:05] and then all of a sudden they get pumped
[1:05:07] up and guess what then because God says
[1:05:09] no no man go get any glory he causes
[1:05:12] them to fall let no man glory in men why
[1:05:18] because all things are yours
[1:05:23] I'm yours and yours you're mine that's
[1:05:26] what the Bible says whether Paul or
[1:05:29] Apollo's Cephas are the world of life or
[1:05:32] death or things present or things to
[1:05:34] come all are yours wait a minute that's
[1:05:40] a whole lot heaven and earth is mine
[1:05:43] oh god help us think like Eagles right
[1:05:46] now sig like egos not like chickens down
[1:05:50] here plucking we're up here all things
[1:05:53] are yours as far as the eye can see
[1:05:58] spiritual eyes that I'm talking about
[1:06:02] they're yours is that the scripture and
[1:06:06] you're Christ's and Christ is God's
[1:06:10] everything is of God is yours that's why
[1:06:15] you said ask what you will and it shall
[1:06:18] be given we are the children of faith
[1:06:24] and we are the children of achievements
[1:06:28] and what the other ages could not do God
[1:06:32] has placed us here to achieve it
[1:06:35] hallelujah the Bible said they cannot be
[1:06:38] completed without us how are you come on
[1:06:41] somebody you know and I know in a race
[1:06:44] especially a relay race you take the
[1:06:48] good man and you put them at the end the
[1:06:51] fastest one you got two ways you can do
[1:06:55] it if you got 2 1 2 that's fast you put
[1:06:57] Blount the fast I defer at the beginning
[1:07:00] and the one at the end
[1:07:01] not just in case the ones in the middle
[1:07:04] slack up a little bit right that one at
[1:07:07] the end boy he can take it and you see I
[1:07:09] love track I love a running I think but
[1:07:11] you know I love seeing that I'm I'm like
[1:07:13] I just marvel how fast people can refer
[1:07:16] oh my just look like they look like a
[1:07:19] blur yeah but anyhow hey God puts us out
[1:07:28] at the end why because we not only just
[1:07:32] we don't run like the Pentecostals and
[1:07:34] try to you know pick it
[1:07:36] Oh catch the win no we we get this way
[1:07:39] and then we go this way we Eagles we go
[1:07:46] beyond the Pentecostals if you can't go
[1:07:49] beyond the pillow call so you that's
[1:07:51] what you are Pentecostal but you got to
[1:07:53] be an eagle to go into the astronaut age
[1:07:55] as our prophet have said people that's
[1:07:58] y'all hear what I'm saying my point is
[1:08:00] you know what's defeating us our own
[1:08:02] character hello our own character is
[1:08:07] defeating us but you know what you got
[1:08:10] to get rid of him
[1:08:11] I don't care how good you think he is
[1:08:16] how moral you think he is it has to die
[1:08:20] God don't need your morals he meet his
[1:08:24] life in you who people come on let's
[1:08:27] understand this and I'm gonna tell you
[1:08:30] something listen desperation is coming
[1:08:34] wherever you go there now or later
[1:08:38] desperation is coming if you are to make
[1:08:42] a rapture your pressure is coming hello
[1:08:47] and God is gonna put it on you and he's
[1:08:49] not gonna spare you
[1:08:50] is that right brother BAM said he said
[1:08:54] sometimes we whip it before God sometime
[1:08:56] he feel like kicking us around that's
[1:08:59] what he said
[1:09:00] he said God feels like kicking us around
[1:09:03] cuz may God have mercy cuz you don't
[1:09:09] ever want him to kick you people of God
[1:09:18] we must understand every little demon
[1:09:21] every little thing that we are facing
[1:09:23] God allowed you say oh I mean let me say
[1:09:28] like this why not you which would you
[1:09:31] prefer going to Nero's chopping block
[1:09:35] eaten by lions huh
[1:09:38] would you prefer or having battles in
[1:09:41] your head where you can get you can do
[1:09:42] you can be delivered yeah yeah the
[1:09:46] greatest battle ever fought is in your
[1:09:47] mind but which you prefer
[1:09:50] think God has been so unjust do you
[1:09:52] think God been unfair to you because you
[1:09:54] go through these changes let me tell you
[1:09:57] all something
[1:09:58] these young men and these young women
[1:10:00] you are flesh certain desires that you
[1:10:06] will encounter it's not evil it is what
[1:10:10] it is it was set there for reproduction
[1:10:13] is when you do something you've got no
[1:10:16] business doing this when it becomes evil
[1:10:17] but you're not abnormal because you have
[1:10:20] desires you understand me you're not
[1:10:23] abnormal that is what the normal person
[1:10:27] feels but it's what you do with those
[1:10:30] desires is what God is saying and you
[1:10:33] cannot control them the Holy Ghost is
[1:10:35] the only one that can hallelujah those
[1:10:40] of us with the Holy Ghost have a time or
[1:10:43] two every now and again Oh somebody say
[1:10:46] man y'all like y'all got these little
[1:10:48] halos around your head y'all better
[1:10:50] understand the Prophet God had to put a
[1:10:52] cross in front of his vehicle to keep
[1:10:55] his mind straight that was back then
[1:10:57] they one more closed in I don't know how
[1:11:02] to brothers do it I have no idea oh lord
[1:11:07] have mercy
[1:11:07] one great thing I love about beginning a
[1:11:10] older it changes it's thank God for
[1:11:16] safety
[1:11:18] hey man glory to God I'm almost done
[1:11:24] supernatural achievements is to brings a
[1:11:29] successful end we are here to hear God
[1:11:35] say well done I don't want to be a
[1:11:39] doormat I don't want to make it very
[1:11:42] barely make it in I want to hear him say
[1:11:45] well done and I'm almost done
[1:11:55] relevé I'm sitting like this he says Wow
[1:11:57] we will watch right here before that
[1:12:01] time comes and see the glorious power of
[1:12:05] God returned to the church the presence
[1:12:08] of Jesus Christ the omnipotence showing
[1:12:12] that he is and where he is right among
[1:12:16] us doing the same works that he promised
[1:12:19] would be done in this age
[1:12:22] here he is proving that he's the same
[1:12:25] now you say well that's brother Branham
[1:12:28] but God used him as a wave sheaf it was
[1:12:33] the Christ in him now but it was showing
[1:12:36] that would come more like him and you
[1:12:39] the more you the more don't shadow for
[1:12:44] nothing less than the more we can't
[1:12:49] allow his life
[1:12:50] that's like allowing Jesus Christ like
[1:12:52] to cut be vain if there was no
[1:12:55] manifestation of Jesus to prove that he
[1:12:57] was alive and well his crucifixion was a
[1:13:00] vain no purpose behind it
[1:13:05] and we can't allow Malachi foreing God
[1:13:08] to come through him and you know the son
[1:13:10] of man we we we we caught all of these
[1:13:12] things but it's vain if this message
[1:13:14] don't live in others outside of him it's
[1:13:19] come to collect the family of god of
[1:13:24] this age and folks you he had to be
[1:13:28] serious he had to be trained you must be
[1:13:33] serious and God will train you and God
[1:13:36] will spank you and whatever else it
[1:13:39] takes to get you where you need to be
[1:13:44] he's gonna do it not by power not by
[1:13:48] might but by my spirit saith the Lord
[1:13:51] we have a city whose builder and maker
[1:13:54] is God and God I'm telling you I said to
[1:13:58] before the early of the mist I'm gonna
[1:14:00] close character is the key to the city
[1:14:05] not yours his character
[1:14:08] that's the only thing that's gonna get
[1:14:10] you up it is the only thing that's gonna
[1:14:13] open up that portal right it's the only
[1:14:17] thing and I don't care what everybody
[1:14:19] else is preaching old millions new Moses
[1:14:22] was a prophet but they fail to allow God
[1:14:27] to mold their character and every trial
[1:14:32] they went through was to mold their
[1:14:34] character and only two of them came up
[1:14:37] with different spirits that was Joshua
[1:14:40] and Caleb that's Stan I just love that
[1:14:50] statement that
[1:15:01] estimated if I perish let me perish I'm
[1:15:06] going to see the king you and I must
[1:15:12] know that you can perish one way if
[1:15:15] you're gonna die let do it for the cause
[1:15:17] of Christ you're gonna die you're gonna
[1:15:23] die unless the Lord take you up young or
[1:15:26] old
[1:15:26] the grave is waiting unless to wrap to
[1:15:31] take place and you go there or go in it
[1:15:35] it's inevitable it's a guarantee ooh
[1:15:41] [Music]
[1:15:42] whether you look forward to it or not is
[1:15:45] going to happen
[1:15:47] my thing is there's why do we waste our
[1:15:49] time
[1:15:51] and I've been asking God iiiiii you know
[1:15:54] I'm always rededicated my life even
[1:15:56] today I rededicated my life and I said
[1:15:59] to the Lord keep me steady keep my eyes
[1:16:05] focused and keep it steady no matter
[1:16:11] what things are happening people and I
[1:16:17] know a lot of the attacks that's
[1:16:19] happening to my family it's about me
[1:16:23] Satan is trying to distract me because
[1:16:27] he knows it's like a domino effect if he
[1:16:29] can get me it Falls everybody else could
[1:16:32] be knocked over or whatever just only
[1:16:37] Sunday my she trying to try to commit
[1:16:41] suicide again God's continued to pray
[1:16:45] for her but you know the thing is easier
[1:16:52] said than done I don't know
[1:16:55] but I can tell you I saw it when it
[1:16:57] happen and a lot of times people don't
[1:17:01] understand but I'm gonna tell you
[1:17:02] something all folks get to dancing that
[1:17:07] these weddings and some of the dances
[1:17:10] that they do is not right I know people
[1:17:12] don't like me to do that
[1:17:15] because I saw when the spirit took my
[1:17:17] daughter I was there and I told her not
[1:17:22] to do it she did it anyway people think
[1:17:27] I'm crazy
[1:17:28] brother books you crazy let me tell you
[1:17:29] something if God doesn't let Elvis get
[1:17:33] away with moving and gyrating he's not
[1:17:37] gonna let you and nobody else do I don't
[1:17:40] care where you come from that's true it
[1:17:44] might be a culture thing but everything
[1:17:46] must die and rot God's Word is the only
[1:17:52] thing on stand and I get people mad at
[1:17:55] me because I'm saying it but I'm gonna
[1:17:57] tell you something one of these old days
[1:17:59] if people don't repent and hear what I'm
[1:18:01] trying to say they're gonna wish there
[1:18:03] had because I know that when I say these
[1:18:06] things it's a word from the Lord I'm no
[1:18:09] prophet but I do know it comes from God
[1:18:12] and I'm gonna tell you something saints
[1:18:14] of God people think that it doesn't
[1:18:17] matter when it does you got it you got
[1:18:21] to trace things back and see where all
[1:18:23] of this stuff come from is that right
[1:18:31] it's like short pants people wear short
[1:18:33] pants and everything else you know I
[1:18:35] don't know why I'm saying but they don't
[1:18:38] know they wearing a women underwear
[1:18:42] they don't know they think I'm just
[1:18:46] legalistic or whatever because I'm
[1:18:48] telling the sister don't come in here
[1:18:49] with these these high-heeled shoes
[1:18:52] whoa hey the Prophet said a pillock also
[1:18:56] woman went to hell because she wore high
[1:18:59] heels shoes he said she had no hope and
[1:19:07] they they think well we the bread
[1:19:09] messaging we're justified as though we'd
[1:19:11] never seen before let me tell you
[1:19:13] something the Bride of Christ you really
[1:19:15] believe that and have a revelation of
[1:19:18] that she does nothing to be contrary to
[1:19:24] the Word of God is that Alright
[1:19:29] without God I could do nothing my life
[1:19:39] would be drifty
[1:19:45] like God
[1:19:47] [Music]
[1:19:58] I will need nothing
[1:20:03] [Music]
[1:20:14] get out
[1:20:19] [Music]
[1:21:09] y'all believe that without God I am
[1:21:13] nothing
[1:21:16] don't want to be nothing
[1:21:18] [Music]
[1:22:30] y'all understand what I'm saying when I
[1:22:33] was talk about the bad the bad dancing
[1:22:35] all dancing ain't bad it's just when you
[1:22:39] start moving too much and it distracts
[1:22:42] you understand
[1:22:45] I know it's okay either I'm a devil
[1:22:50] along the Son of God I'm the son of God
[1:22:53] I'm telling you the truth
[1:22:56] so you know it's like people people
[1:23:00] don't understand and I know it's hard
[1:23:03] it's hard can you imagine what it's like
[1:23:06] to
[1:23:07] tell a man who's been blind all his life
[1:23:10] you can see I can pray for you and you
[1:23:14] have your sight
[1:23:15] how can he how could he understand what
[1:23:18] I'm talking about what he's never seen
[1:23:19] inside he's never had it so how can he
[1:23:23] understand what I'm trying to tell him
[1:23:26] only faith can drop in his heart that
[1:23:29] what am I saying is possible if he
[1:23:32] believed and I'm telling you now that's
[1:23:35] people don't understand but all of the
[1:23:38] fighting that we got going on around
[1:23:40] this message this doctrine against that
[1:23:43] doctor is the very thing that's holding
[1:23:45] up the myth of the rapture
[1:23:47] it's the preachers that causes the
[1:23:49] people to end hello you don't have to
[1:23:53] say Amen is to in it's the same thing
[1:23:56] the Pentecostal church did and we doing
[1:23:58] the same thing how we're going to reach
[1:24:01] brotherly love and brotherly kindness
[1:24:02] when everybody is so interested in the
[1:24:04] depth of the world depth of the word and
[1:24:07] nobody is interested in living it I'm
[1:24:10] interested in living
[1:24:13] because what Paul says what good is
[1:24:16] going for me and know all the mysteries
[1:24:18] and can't have challenge you can't even
[1:24:23] love your brothers and your sisters and
[1:24:25] disagree and still love you can't do
[1:24:27] that and you and I expect a rapture but
[1:24:29] the bride is an entity she's a single
[1:24:33] person one by one she will accomplish
[1:24:37] this we're gonna take a rapture and
[1:24:40] everybody else God knows what he's doing
[1:24:44] with amen amen
