[39:40] oh
[40:24] brother isaiah called so i believe
[40:27] that's what he was wanting me to do
[40:29] so amen
[40:32] if we could this evening let's just turn
[40:34] over to uh
[40:35] ephesians chapter 2
[40:40] verse 1.
[40:48] i started preaching out of the book of
[40:50] ephesians about
[40:52] almost three years ago and i'm still in
[40:54] it
[40:55] and brother keith they back home they
[40:56] tell me they say we know if cliff's
[40:58] preaching
[40:59] we're going to be in ephesians but i
[41:00] said you know what brother branham said
[41:02] you could look at a
[41:03] at a club piece of clover and you could
[41:06] just preach for years on that right
[41:07] there i believe he said you preached the
[41:09] rest of his life on it i thought man
[41:10] what about a whole
[41:12] a whole book of the bible so but we're
[41:14] not going to preach the whole bible
[41:15] we're just going to take a little piece
[41:17] tonight
[41:18] ephesians chapter 2 verse 1
[41:21] and you hath thee quickened who were
[41:24] dead in trespasses and sins
[41:27] wherein in time past you walked
[41:29] according to the course
[41:30] of this world according to the prince
[41:34] of the power of the air the spirit that
[41:36] now worketh
[41:38] in the children of disobedience you can
[41:41] be seated
[41:42] i want to continue reading but i just
[41:44] want to take my time with this now
[41:46] you understand that he's talking about
[41:48] we were dead in sins
[41:51] and we walked according to the course of
[41:53] the world now
[41:54] we see that the way that the course of
[41:56] the world's going
[41:57] we see where they're at and so what we
[41:59] begin to find is that
[42:01] you know i can't be lifted up brother
[42:03] frank in the fact that i serve god but
[42:05] the only thing i can do is say thank god
[42:08] that i'm not like those out there thank
[42:09] god that i'm not of this world
[42:12] but he says you were he said among whom
[42:15] also we all had
[42:16] our conversation in times past in the
[42:19] lust of our flesh
[42:20] so we were all sinners we all took
[42:24] a part in the lust of the flesh
[42:27] and of the mind and we're by
[42:30] children we're by nature the children of
[42:33] wrath
[42:34] even as others the scripture says
[42:38] but god and i like this the word but
[42:42] there means it's a conjunction it's
[42:44] we're changing what we're talking about
[42:46] it
[42:46] you know it's talking about any time you
[42:49] use but or and it's
[42:51] look this is what we were talking about
[42:54] but now this is
[42:55] what we are talking about and he tells
[42:58] me about a group of people that are
[43:00] walking after the course of the world
[43:01] and
[43:02] he's telling me how i used to be and
[43:04] he's telling me the way i
[43:06] used to think but then he puts a
[43:08] conjunction in here
[43:09] he says but god rich in mercy
[43:15] for his great love wherewith he loved us
[43:20] even when we were dead in sins hath
[43:23] quickened us
[43:23] together with christ by grace ye
[43:27] are saved and i just want to take a
[43:28] little simple thought tonight on god
[43:31] rich in mercy i looked up this word rich
[43:35] and it says
[43:36] wealthy abounding in materials
[43:40] and in resources and i i thought about
[43:42] how god is
[43:43] he's not just just rich in in
[43:46] in you know money but he's got all kinds
[43:49] of resources
[43:50] you know sometimes you're praying and
[43:52] you you know god's got resources of
[43:54] animals
[43:56] there was a brother in our church one
[43:57] time praying and he said lord
[43:59] you know if you want this certain thing
[44:00] to happen and he asked something to do
[44:01] with a squirrel and it happened
[44:03] and another brother one time was telling
[44:05] me he was praying you know
[44:06] lord let let a deer walk out here and
[44:09] you know how many
[44:10] points he wanted on the horns and all
[44:12] this and it happened
[44:13] he's a god of resources and and i'm
[44:16] going to tell you he
[44:16] he's a god that can give you a house and
[44:19] he's a god that can give you a job and
[44:22] he's the god that can heal your body
[44:24] we're you know i think sometimes we're
[44:26] guilty
[44:26] of limiting god we're guilty of putting
[44:30] the
[44:30] you know a box around god and we go i
[44:32] know you can go to here and
[44:34] i know you can go to there but i'm
[44:36] telling you he's a limitless god
[44:38] he's a god that you know i think about
[44:41] this he's a god beyond exaggeration
[44:45] you think about that brother frank we
[44:47] can exaggerate anything that we know
[44:50] about is that right brother
[44:54] i can exaggerate how bad a person is i
[44:57] can exaggerate how good a person is
[45:00] i can exaggerate the size of the
[45:03] united states i could exaggerate the
[45:06] size
[45:07] of the earth in total i could exaggerate
[45:10] anything that i wanted to exaggerate
[45:12] until it comes to god
[45:15] and there is nothing that you could say
[45:17] that is so great
[45:18] that you can exaggerate how great god is
[45:24] but he's rich he's abounding
[45:28] in mercy and i looked up this word
[45:32] mercy in the lexicon and it says
[45:34] kindness and good will
[45:37] toward the miserable and the afflicted
[45:41] and that's who i was i was the miserable
[45:45] and i was the i was the sinner
[45:48] i was the one that didn't love god i was
[45:50] the one that didn't serve god
[45:52] but i was the one with the keith that he
[45:55] chose to have mercy on
[45:57] i was the one that he chose to come and
[45:59] get
[46:02] he's sending kindness and good will
[46:04] toward the miserable and afflicted
[46:06] joined with a desire to help them
[46:10] when i read that i thought oh my it's
[46:13] not just that he will help me
[46:16] but it's actually his desire to help me
[46:19] it's not just that he can
[46:20] help me but it's that his very being is
[46:24] i want to help them
[46:27] you know there's a church of christ a
[46:30] church in our town and
[46:31] you know our town is almost overran by
[46:34] church of christ you know sometimes you
[46:36] go to their catholic towns and there's
[46:38] baptist towns but in our town
[46:40] there's church of christ and so i used
[46:43] to work for a man that was church of
[46:44] christ
[46:45] and and we began to talk about miracles
[46:47] and of course he said we don't believe
[46:48] in miracles i said well what about
[46:50] healing and he said well we believe god
[46:52] could heal you
[46:54] if he wanted to we're not saying that he
[46:57] couldn't we just
[46:58] it's just that it's it's not really
[47:00] something that he does anymore
[47:03] but i'm thankful that i found a god that
[47:06] it's not
[47:06] if he decides he wants to it's that he
[47:09] always wants to
[47:10] it's not a god that could but it's a god
[47:13] that can
[47:14] it's not a god that used to but it's a
[47:16] god that does
[47:20] god's desire is to help me
[47:23] now as i begin to look in the scripture
[47:27] i saw some things that i just wanted to
[47:30] point out because
[47:30] god's help doesn't always seem like
[47:33] mercy
[47:34] brother frank god's mercy doesn't always
[47:37] seem merciful
[47:40] second samuel 7 and 14 says
[47:44] i will be his father oh aren't you
[47:47] thankful for that
[47:49] and he shall be my son
[47:52] if he if he commit iniquity i will
[47:55] chasten him
[47:56] with the rod of men and with the stripes
[47:59] of the children of men
[48:01] i looked at that and i thought oh my we
[48:03] love to talk about the god that wants to
[48:04] be our father
[48:06] but now he's saying listen if you're my
[48:08] son i'm going to whip you
[48:10] i'm going to whip you when you need it
[48:12] you know i've been looking lately at
[48:14] what the heart
[48:15] of a real shepherd is the heart of a
[48:18] real
[48:19] shepherd and christ is the good shepherd
[48:22] but i begin to look you know brother
[48:24] branham tells us that a pastor
[48:26] is a shepherd and you understand that a
[48:29] shepherd
[48:30] has a staff and that staff helps him
[48:34] walk and that staff is the word of god
[48:37] that staff in his hand is what helps him
[48:40] take those sheep to green pastures but
[48:43] that
[48:43] is the same staff brother keith that he
[48:46] will break those sheep's legs with
[48:47] whenever they get out of line
[48:49] you understand that the word is not
[48:51] always just
[48:52] oh it's a good word and it's a god is a
[48:55] god of blessing but
[48:56] sometimes the word has to come and it
[48:59] has to strike us
[49:01] it has to take our knees out from under
[49:03] us why
[49:04] sometimes we stray a little bit but i
[49:07] was
[49:08] reading today and the prophet of god
[49:09] said listen he said
[49:11] sometimes the sheep will stray he said
[49:14] but the
[49:15] shepherd will stray with him and i begin
[49:18] to think that even at my lowest valley
[49:21] i have a shepherd that is willing to go
[49:24] into the lowest valley with me
[49:26] when i would stray off a cliff i have a
[49:29] shepherd
[49:30] who is willing to stray off the cliff
[49:33] with me
[49:33] and he said the shepherd will stray to
[49:36] bring the seat back
[49:41] he said i'll chase in him with the rod
[49:44] of men
[49:45] and with the stripes of the children of
[49:47] men
[49:49] but my mercy shall not depart away from
[49:51] him
[49:52] as i took it from saul whom i put away
[49:55] before thee
[49:56] you see chastisement
[50:00] is mercy
[50:03] you know i thank god when he whips me
[50:07] you know sometimes i i'm driving down
[50:10] the road brother keith i'm listening to
[50:12] a tape and i just start
[50:13] realizing man i i ain't been living like
[50:16] i ought to and i hadn't been praying
[50:18] like i ought to
[50:19] haven't been as sincere as i ought to be
[50:21] and i feel like god is just kind of
[50:23] whipping me and he's saying cliff you've
[50:25] you've been straying you've been getting
[50:28] out of line but what i'm thankful for
[50:30] is that the same god that whips me he
[50:33] pulls me back into explosive
[50:36] when i say god forgive me i'm sorry for
[50:40] failing you he pulls me back in
[50:43] my legs may be broke but then he heals
[50:45] me
[50:47] it's the god i serve he's rich in mercy
[50:52] chastisement it's mercy
[50:57] brother branham in questions and answers
[50:59] in 62
[51:01] he says god bless you
[51:04] be rich in mercy to you
[51:08] make his face shine upon you
[51:12] and keep you and bless you
[51:15] in all heavenly blessings oh that sounds
[51:18] great
[51:20] he says now i say this not cruel but of
[51:23] love
[51:25] i pray that you that don't know him that
[51:28] your pillow will be so hard
[51:30] that you'll not be able to sleep no more
[51:35] he said your food will be so
[51:38] foul till you can't eat no more
[51:42] until you slip out by the side somewhere
[51:45] and say lord
[51:46] be merciful to me he said that's not
[51:49] wishing anything wrong to you
[51:51] that's for your good brother and sister
[51:54] i i'm going to tell you i find that
[51:57] sometimes we don't pray the right way
[52:00] sometimes we're not willing to say god
[52:02] whatever it takes and and if it takes
[52:04] the food not
[52:05] tasting good and if it takes sleepless
[52:07] nights but
[52:08] we've got to come to a point where we
[52:10] realize no matter how
[52:12] rough it may seem no matter what kind of
[52:15] a trial it may look like it puts someone
[52:17] through praying
[52:18] for god's mercy is is the only
[52:21] option and god's mercy is great
[52:26] but sometimes it hurts
[52:29] the mercy of god i'm going to tell you
[52:32] sometimes you might be going the wrong
[52:34] direction and the mercy of god
[52:36] will make your truck motor go out on you
[52:38] it's god's mercy
[52:40] and you think why did this happen but
[52:42] it's the mercy of god
[52:44] i'll share with you a testimony
[52:48] there was a a young man who used to go
[52:51] to church with us and
[52:53] he he came up to our pastor's house one
[52:56] day
[52:58] and he said brother david he said my
[53:00] transmission is out
[53:02] on my truck he said i can't get it to
[53:05] drive hardly at all and he said it
[53:06] i barely got here and brother david
[53:08] walked outside and he said do you
[53:10] believe the lord would heal
[53:11] your vehicle he said i do
[53:15] and they laid hands and they prayed over
[53:17] that vehicle and he drove it for two
[53:19] years
[53:20] never done anything else to it but that
[53:23] young man got out of church
[53:25] he got on drugs and one day
[53:28] was driving past our pastor's house and
[53:30] he saw that he wasn't home
[53:33] and he was he done some tree work and he
[53:36] pulled up into our pastor's drive
[53:39] and he stole a chainsaw
[53:43] and when he went to back out of his
[53:44] driveway
[53:46] that transmission went out again
[53:51] what was god doing brother keith now we
[53:54] think
[53:54] why did god let that happen i'll tell
[53:56] you why he was showing him
[53:59] that young man's testimony was he said
[54:01] when that
[54:02] happened he said i knew right then this
[54:05] is a real god
[54:07] he said a god that can hold a broken
[54:09] transmission together
[54:11] until i went wrong he said that's a real
[54:15] god
[54:19] i had an uncle one time he was raised in
[54:21] the message
[54:23] he served the lord as a young man but he
[54:25] went astray
[54:28] and we began to pray for him i i heard
[54:30] my dad tell the testimony as just a
[54:32] young boy
[54:33] he was out in sin and they began to pray
[54:35] and they said god don't let him sleep no
[54:37] more
[54:39] until he gets everything right with you
[54:41] don't let him sleep
[54:43] lord make him miserable until he turns
[54:46] himself around
[54:47] and one night my uncle called my dad and
[54:49] he said forrest i gotta get right with
[54:51] god
[54:52] he said listen he said my food don't
[54:54] taste good no more
[54:55] he said i can't sleep no more he said my
[54:58] truck broke down
[54:59] everything's wrong at my job he said my
[55:02] life is falling apart
[55:04] what was it it was god's mercy
[55:12] uh our pastor back home
[55:15] when he was a young man he was raised up
[55:18] in church but he went astray and
[55:22] he was in a motorcycle gang and
[55:25] he was a pretty rough pretty rough fella
[55:29] not serving the lord
[55:32] he told me that one day he took a
[55:37] i hope this is all right to tell but he
[55:39] he he actually took a contract he was
[55:41] going to kill a man
[55:45] and the man was living in a mobile home
[55:47] and
[55:48] brother david tells us the story he said
[55:50] i went and he said i opened up the door
[55:51] on that mobile home and what he didn't
[55:53] know there was a gas leak in there
[55:55] and it blew up burn him
[55:58] burn him from head to toe and he was put
[56:00] in the hospital and they had to
[56:02] scrub him and scrub the skin off of him
[56:05] his family tells the story they said you
[56:07] could hear him screaming
[56:09] anywhere on that floor of that hospital
[56:12] he was in so much pain
[56:15] but he tells the testimony he said
[56:17] through that he said god got a hold of
[56:19] me
[56:19] god didn't let me take that man's life
[56:22] and god
[56:22] began to to restore him through through
[56:25] all of that pain and through all that
[56:27] term on you saying
[56:29] how in the world could it be a good
[56:30] thing i'll tell you how
[56:32] because 50 years later he's serving god
[56:36] 35 years as a sitting pastor in this
[56:39] message
[56:40] what was it it looked like turmoil and
[56:42] it looked like destruction
[56:44] but it was god rich in mercy
[56:50] when i was a young man coming up our
[56:53] pastor used to tell me as a teenager i
[56:55] was
[56:56] you know i was just like any other
[56:57] teenager i done bad things
[57:01] i sinned you know i i dealt with lust i
[57:05] dealt with those problems and
[57:08] i would go over and over and over and
[57:09] i'd go back to the altar and
[57:11] and i one time i told brother david i
[57:14] said i don't know why i just feel so
[57:15] terrible and he said that's good
[57:19] he said brother cliff i want you to
[57:20] always remember this he said
[57:22] condemnation is your best friend
[57:25] and what i didn't realize when i would
[57:27] mess up brother keith and
[57:28] when i would fail god i'd always the
[57:31] same thing would happen i'd get sick to
[57:34] my stomach i'd start bobbing at it
[57:36] you know what to me it was just pain and
[57:38] it was sickness
[57:39] but it was god's rich mercy he was
[57:42] whipping me back into line and you know
[57:44] what
[57:45] as many times as i failed i found out i
[57:48] could go
[57:49] back to an altar i found it and it
[57:51] didn't have to be an altar at church but
[57:53] i could go back to an altar in my heart
[57:55] and i remember one time i was out
[57:57] hunting and
[57:58] i just got so miserable with myself i
[58:01] just stopped my truck out on a gravel
[58:03] road
[58:04] i got out and i knelt down on an old
[58:06] muddy gravel road and i said
[58:08] god you gotta fix me god i'm tired of
[58:11] living this way
[58:12] you gotta fix this problem what was it
[58:16] god rich in mercy
[58:23] david said in psalms 5 and 7
[58:27] he said but as for me i will come into
[58:30] thy house
[58:32] in the multitude of thy mercy and in thy
[58:36] fear will i worship toward thy holy
[58:39] temple
[58:41] you know when i looked at this brother
[58:43] frank i thought
[58:46] david david said god
[58:50] had a multitude of mercy
[58:54] well isaac david needed mercy
[58:59] david was a guy that we could pick his
[59:01] life apart
[59:04] we could talk about david and we could
[59:05] say he was a failure
[59:07] and that'd be right we could say that
[59:10] david
[59:11] was an adulterer and we'd be right
[59:14] we could say that david was a liar
[59:17] we'd be right we could say that david
[59:20] was a murderer
[59:21] because he had a man murdered and you
[59:24] know what we'd be writing all those
[59:25] things we said
[59:26] but i'll tell you something else we
[59:27] could say about david that he had a
[59:30] repentant heart
[59:31] and every time he messed up he went back
[59:34] to god
[59:34] and through the adultery and through the
[59:36] lies and
[59:37] through the murder and through all of
[59:40] the mess-ups that we know about david
[59:43] he would go back to god and because he
[59:46] had a heart that he wanted to be right
[59:48] it would later be recorded that david is
[59:51] a man after god's own heart
[59:56] david needed a lot of mercy
[1:00:01] you might feel like david here tonight
[1:00:02] and you say man i mess up all the time
[1:00:05] that's good
[1:00:10] i said that's good i'm not saying it's
[1:00:14] good to sin
[1:00:16] but i'm telling you sometimes i think we
[1:00:17] need to mess up just enough to remember
[1:00:19] that we're nothing
[1:00:21] and to remember brother keith that if he
[1:00:23] ain't holding our hand
[1:00:26] i can't walk out that door if he's not
[1:00:28] holding my hand
[1:00:30] i told a brother the other day i said
[1:00:32] listen
[1:00:34] i said the reason you know people are
[1:00:35] leaving the message because
[1:00:37] they were taught as kids that brother
[1:00:39] branham couldn't make a mistake
[1:00:42] and then they found out that he did make
[1:00:45] mistakes
[1:00:47] and i said you know what i have to
[1:00:48] realize to realize he was a prophet
[1:00:50] i have to understand that that prophetic
[1:00:53] gift was perfect
[1:00:55] and that prophetic gift never failed
[1:00:58] but that prophetic gift dwelled inside
[1:01:01] of a human being
[1:01:03] that was born by a sex birth that came
[1:01:06] the wrong way
[1:01:07] who had the ability to lie and have the
[1:01:10] ability to sin
[1:01:11] and i said you know why i have to give
[1:01:13] brother branham that much grace
[1:01:15] because i gotta have that much grace i
[1:01:18] realize that
[1:01:19] to ever stand behind a pulpit brother
[1:01:21] frank i know i'm not worthy brother
[1:01:24] samuel i know i'm not worthy to stand
[1:01:26] here
[1:01:27] but i know that there's a perfect gift
[1:01:29] laying on the inside of me
[1:01:31] there is a perfect seed gene down on the
[1:01:34] inside
[1:01:35] but it's inside of just an old failure
[1:01:37] piece of flesh
[1:01:42] david needed a lot of mercy
[1:01:48] and through all that david went through
[1:01:50] he said in psalms chapter 23 he said
[1:01:52] surely goodness and mercy
[1:01:56] shall follow me all the days of my life
[1:01:59] and i will dwell in the house of the
[1:02:02] lord forever i'm going to tell you
[1:02:03] mercy is following you
[1:02:07] me and my wife we were on the road here
[1:02:09] a while back
[1:02:11] excuse me
[1:02:14] i said we just need to pull over on this
[1:02:16] exit
[1:02:18] and i'm going to tell you i still don't
[1:02:20] know brother keith why i stopped
[1:02:23] before i could get in the turn lane for
[1:02:25] the exit i saw that the gas station was
[1:02:27] out of business
[1:02:29] and for some reason i went ahead and
[1:02:31] pulled over and i remember thinking i
[1:02:35] said i don't know why
[1:02:37] i even looked at my wife and i said i
[1:02:38] don't know why we pulled over
[1:02:42] and i just got right back on the exit
[1:02:44] and when i did
[1:02:46] about a quarter of a mile up the road
[1:02:48] right in front of me
[1:02:50] there was a car that i we had been right
[1:02:53] along in the same area
[1:02:54] and i got back up behind this car and it
[1:02:56] ran right up underneath a semi truck
[1:03:00] semi had locked up his brakes in this
[1:03:02] car went up underneath there and i said
[1:03:03] my god
[1:03:04] if we wouldn't have pulled over i'm
[1:03:06] going to tell you sometimes
[1:03:08] god speaks and and sometimes he leads
[1:03:11] you to do something and you're going
[1:03:12] it doesn't seem like that great of a
[1:03:14] thing but it's
[1:03:16] god rich in mercy sometimes you don't
[1:03:19] understand the things that he's keeping
[1:03:21] you out of
[1:03:23] but it's god rich in mercy
[1:03:28] david tells us about a god
[1:03:33] you know i like to talk about this i i'm
[1:03:36] a radical believer
[1:03:40] you know what radical is you know they
[1:03:43] talk about
[1:03:45] muslims and they say well there's
[1:03:46] muslims and then there's
[1:03:48] radical muslims
[1:03:51] i want to tell you i'm a radical
[1:03:53] believer
[1:03:55] i'm radical i i i just believe that
[1:03:58] god's got enough power
[1:03:59] to do whatever he wants to do i i
[1:04:02] believe that there is
[1:04:04] nothing beyond his reach and i i believe
[1:04:07] that he's so
[1:04:08] merciful that to the what let me tell
[1:04:11] you how merciful god is
[1:04:13] i want to ask you a question now and i'm
[1:04:15] asking you to talk back to me
[1:04:16] what's the one sin that cannot be
[1:04:18] forgiven
[1:04:22] what is it blasphemy
[1:04:27] but paul said i blasphemed
[1:04:32] so even when you go so far
[1:04:36] that you could even find scripture to
[1:04:38] prove there's no coming back
[1:04:40] god still has enough mercy
[1:04:44] david described a radical mercy
[1:04:48] romans 4 and 6 says even as david also
[1:04:51] describeth
[1:04:52] the blessedness of the man unto whom god
[1:04:55] imputeth righteousness
[1:04:57] without works saying blessed are they
[1:04:59] whose iniquities are forgiven
[1:05:02] and whose sins are covered blessed is
[1:05:05] the man to whom the lord
[1:05:07] will not impute sin
[1:05:12] he won't impute it not that he didn't
[1:05:17] not that he just said i won't
[1:05:21] this timer i'm going to let you slide by
[1:05:24] today
[1:05:25] but he said i'm not going to i will not
[1:05:28] do it i
[1:05:29] i god cannot impute sin to you why
[1:05:32] because of the shed blood of calvary
[1:05:35] when the blood is upon you and you claim
[1:05:38] the blood
[1:05:39] god sees the blood of jesus christ
[1:05:42] and for god to impute sin to you he'd
[1:05:45] have to be imputing it to his
[1:05:47] own blood
[1:05:53] you might think well i use a lot of
[1:05:57] mercy
[1:06:00] have you ever felt that way i need a lot
[1:06:03] of mercy
[1:06:05] maybe you feel like you've used up his
[1:06:07] mercy it's okay
[1:06:09] lamentations 3 22 said it is the lord's
[1:06:12] mercies
[1:06:14] that we're not consumed because his
[1:06:16] compassions fail not
[1:06:19] they are new every morning
[1:06:24] great is thy faithfulness i when i read
[1:06:27] that scripture i thought oh my
[1:06:28] if for some reason i could fail him so
[1:06:32] much brother frank
[1:06:34] that i could run out of mercy today
[1:06:37] i can lay my head on a pillow knowing
[1:06:40] that when i wake up in the morning that
[1:06:42] his mercies are new again
[1:06:45] i confess he said he said for us to
[1:06:47] forgive 70 times 7
[1:06:50] 490 times if by
[1:06:53] chance brother keith you fail him 491
[1:06:57] times
[1:06:58] remember this his mercy is new
[1:07:02] every morning you say but i failed him
[1:07:05] so bad
[1:07:06] but when you wake up in the morning he
[1:07:08] says i don't even remember what you did
[1:07:10] yesterday
[1:07:13] that's the god i serve i serve a god
[1:07:16] that when it got down to the last minute
[1:07:19] i tell you sometimes we talk about
[1:07:22] abraham's ram
[1:07:24] but that wasn't really abraham's ring
[1:07:28] come on now if abraham would have killed
[1:07:32] isaac
[1:07:33] he might could have had another son
[1:07:36] but if isaac got killed it was over for
[1:07:39] isaac
[1:07:41] and isaac was laying there in need
[1:07:44] and god provided a ram for isaac and i'm
[1:07:47] going to tell you i i know about a god
[1:07:49] that can provide when you're down to
[1:07:51] your last
[1:07:52] hope when you're down to where there's
[1:07:54] nothing left whether it's in prayer for
[1:07:57] a
[1:07:57] family member and you've given your last
[1:07:59] bit of strength and
[1:08:01] you're down to your last bit of hope or
[1:08:03] maybe it's for the church that you go to
[1:08:06] or
[1:08:06] maybe it's for your job or it's your
[1:08:08] whatever it is it doesn't matter i'm
[1:08:10] talking about a
[1:08:11] god who's rich in mercy
[1:08:16] i begin to think about hezekiah
[1:08:21] i want to talk to you about hezekiah
[1:08:25] second kings verse chapter 20 and verse
[1:08:27] one
[1:08:28] it's a little bit of reading but i want
[1:08:29] you to catch something in this
[1:08:32] in those days was hezekiah sick unto
[1:08:34] death
[1:08:35] and the prophet isaiah and the son of
[1:08:39] amos came to him and said unto him thus
[1:08:41] saith the lord now when thus saith the
[1:08:44] lord comes forth
[1:08:46] there's no change in that
[1:08:49] set thine house in order for thou shalt
[1:08:52] die
[1:08:53] and not live then
[1:08:57] he turned his face to the wall
[1:09:02] brother keith i'm going to tell you what
[1:09:04] i think we lack we turned our face to
[1:09:06] the wall enough
[1:09:10] and he prayed unto the lord saying i
[1:09:12] beseech thee oh lord
[1:09:14] remember now how i walk before thee in
[1:09:17] truth
[1:09:18] and with a perfect heart and have done
[1:09:20] that which is good in thy sight
[1:09:23] and hezekiah wept sore
[1:09:27] hezekiah turned his face to the wall he
[1:09:30] began to weep on the inside
[1:09:33] and that man's prayer and that man's
[1:09:35] faith
[1:09:36] touched the heart of god
[1:09:39] and it came to pass before isaiah was
[1:09:42] going out in the middle court
[1:09:44] that the word of the lord came to him
[1:09:47] saying turn again and tell hezekiah
[1:09:51] the captain of my people thus saith the
[1:09:54] lord god of david thy father
[1:09:57] i have heard thy prayer i have
[1:10:00] seen thy tears behold i will heal thee
[1:10:03] on the third day
[1:10:05] thou shalt go up unto the house of the
[1:10:08] lord
[1:10:11] i looked at this i thought now brother
[1:10:14] keith how could god send a man with thus
[1:10:17] saith the lord
[1:10:19] and turn him back around
[1:10:23] and change what he said
[1:10:27] verse 6 says and i will add unto thy
[1:10:31] days 15 years and i will deliver thee
[1:10:34] and this city out of the hand of the
[1:10:35] king of assyria
[1:10:37] and i will defend this city for my own
[1:10:39] sake
[1:10:40] and for my servant david's sake and
[1:10:43] isaiah said
[1:10:44] take a lump of figs and he took it and
[1:10:46] laid it upon the bowl and he recovered
[1:10:49] and hezekiah said unto isaiah what shall
[1:10:53] be the sign
[1:10:54] that the lord will heal me and that i
[1:10:57] shall go
[1:10:58] up into the house of the lord the third
[1:11:00] day
[1:11:01] and isaiah said the sign shall thou
[1:11:04] s this sign shout thou have of the lord
[1:11:07] that the lord will do the thing
[1:11:09] that he has spoken shall the shadow go
[1:11:13] forward 10 degrees
[1:11:16] or go back 10 degrees
[1:11:20] and hezekiah answered it's a light thing
[1:11:22] for the shadow to go down 10 degrees
[1:11:26] i begin to think about this
[1:11:30] if if for some reason
[1:11:36] if for some reason the shadow suddenly
[1:11:39] move forward you could say well
[1:11:40] maybe maybe it was supposed to have been
[1:11:43] there maybe
[1:11:43] you know you there would be all these
[1:11:45] questions in your mind
[1:11:47] he said it's a light thing that he'd go
[1:11:48] forward
[1:11:52] if we was looking at a clock on the wall
[1:11:54] i don't see one
[1:11:57] here we go i won't preach too long
[1:12:01] if i looked at my clock and all of a
[1:12:03] sudden it moved forward brother keith
[1:12:04] you know what i could say
[1:12:05] i could say well maybe the battery was
[1:12:07] just catching up
[1:12:09] but if it went backwards it'd be
[1:12:11] something real
[1:12:12] significant and he said
[1:12:16] or go back 10 degrees and hezekiah said
[1:12:19] it's a light thing for the shatter to go
[1:12:20] down 10 degrees nay
[1:12:22] but let the shadow return backward 10
[1:12:25] degrees
[1:12:27] and isaiah the prophet cried unto the
[1:12:29] lord
[1:12:30] and he brought the shadow 10 degrees
[1:12:34] backward
[1:12:37] now look at this
[1:12:40] he walks in as a prophet of god
[1:12:43] and he says get your house in order
[1:12:48] you're going to die it's thus saith the
[1:12:50] lord
[1:12:52] and he walks out the door and before he
[1:12:56] can get
[1:12:56] out of the middle court let me put it in
[1:12:58] today's terms before he can get out of
[1:13:00] his front yard
[1:13:02] god says go back
[1:13:06] and ten minutes later here he is back in
[1:13:09] his
[1:13:10] living room or his bedroom again and he
[1:13:12] says listen you're not gonna die
[1:13:18] let me talk about how great god is
[1:13:21] the shadow going backward 10 degrees i
[1:13:24] looked this up
[1:13:26] brother keith it was a 15 minute gap
[1:13:32] the prophet of god told us that god
[1:13:34] cannot change his mind about his word
[1:13:37] but i'll tell you what god is able to do
[1:13:40] he's able to take time back to before he
[1:13:43] said that he came with thus saith the
[1:13:47] lord
[1:13:48] but god turned the time back so that
[1:13:50] when he came back he said no
[1:13:52] you're gonna live i'm talking about a
[1:13:55] god
[1:13:56] rich in mercy maybe maybe the
[1:13:59] could have said wait a minute at 6 15
[1:14:02] you said he was going to die and isaiah
[1:14:05] could say
[1:14:06] it's not 6 15 yet oh i'm talking about a
[1:14:09] god rich in mercy
[1:14:11] he can turn back time for you
[1:14:16] i'll tell you that's what happens when
[1:14:18] you go to a doctor and he tells you you
[1:14:19] got cancer
[1:14:20] but you go back and he says there's no
[1:14:23] cancer there what is
[1:14:25] it god takes you back to a new body he
[1:14:28] takes you back to the healing
[1:14:31] i want to go further than that i
[1:14:32] remember one time brother branham said
[1:14:34] he was praying for a little woman
[1:14:35] that was in an insane asylum he said he
[1:14:38] was sitting talking with her and she
[1:14:40] said i
[1:14:40] gave my my mind has been given to the
[1:14:43] devil i gave my body over to him
[1:14:45] and the prophet of god said little
[1:14:47] sister i know a god
[1:14:50] that can take you back to when you were
[1:14:52] a virgin
[1:14:53] i'm talking about god rich in mercy
[1:15:01] brother branham says and god almighty
[1:15:04] jehovah
[1:15:06] reconsidered that man's case
[1:15:10] i'll tell you maybe tonight you got
[1:15:12] something you need god to reconsider
[1:15:15] maybe you failed him so bad you just
[1:15:17] need you need him to come back to you
[1:15:19] maybe you've grieved him away and
[1:15:20] you want to go back to the time when he
[1:15:22] wasn't out there on a limb but he was
[1:15:24] with you
[1:15:24] the time when oh let me brother keith i
[1:15:28] was thinking
[1:15:29] sitting in the back there when you was
[1:15:30] praying for service
[1:15:33] i'm going to tell you sometimes they're
[1:15:34] just things that stand out to you
[1:15:37] i remember you remember when we met at
[1:15:39] the restaurant a few years ago
[1:15:41] i tell you we met we had all been
[1:15:45] praying
[1:15:46] we were all on fire before we knew it
[1:15:50] we didn't really care about the food on
[1:15:52] the table we were shouting
[1:15:54] we were saying glory to god in the
[1:15:56] middle of a restaurant
[1:15:58] people were looking at us like they've
[1:16:00] lost their mind and we had
[1:16:02] we had lost our mind but we had been we
[1:16:04] had stepped into a place where the mind
[1:16:06] of christ had come in and
[1:16:07] it didn't matter that we weren't in
[1:16:09] church it didn't matter that we wasn't
[1:16:11] in a prayer room somewhere
[1:16:13] we had turned a denny's restaurant into
[1:16:15] a meeting house of god
[1:16:20] i tell you sometimes we
[1:16:24] we just get to the point where it ain't
[1:16:25] like that you know what i mean brother
[1:16:26] keith we just get cold on him
[1:16:29] but i'm telling you you can't ever get
[1:16:30] so cold that you can't go back
[1:16:33] you can't go back i'm talking about a
[1:16:36] god that no matter how cold you're
[1:16:37] getting
[1:16:38] how far you run and how many bad things
[1:16:41] you do that you can go right back and
[1:16:42] say lord i'm sorry
[1:16:48] i was telling a man that i worked with
[1:16:49] the other day he said
[1:16:52] he said i don't know about a death bed
[1:16:54] repentance i said i do
[1:16:56] that's the kind of god i serve
[1:16:59] i told excuse me i told him that there's
[1:17:01] people that don't know about him
[1:17:03] he told me he said well what if what if
[1:17:04] a man took his own life
[1:17:06] could he be saved i said listen all i
[1:17:08] know is that i serve a god that's rich
[1:17:10] in mercy
[1:17:11] i said god don't judge those who are out
[1:17:14] of their mind
[1:17:15] and i don't believe you could take your
[1:17:16] own life and be in your right mind so i
[1:17:18] don't know if god judges them or not but
[1:17:20] what i
[1:17:20] what i'm trying to tell you is that i
[1:17:22] serve a rich a rich god
[1:17:25] it's rich in mercy he said
[1:17:30] god almighty jehovah reconsidered that
[1:17:32] man's case
[1:17:33] because he prayed think of that
[1:17:38] almighty god that had pronounced death
[1:17:40] upon the man
[1:17:41] reconsidered his case the prophet of god
[1:17:45] said my
[1:17:46] that's too much for me the great jehovah
[1:17:50] to immortal
[1:17:51] to one of the earth would reconsider
[1:17:55] his word that he had said to him
[1:17:59] a god so rich in mercy brother
[1:18:02] that you could go to him in prayer with
[1:18:05] tears
[1:18:07] turn your face to the wall and brother
[1:18:09] frank he would reconsider what he told
[1:18:11] you
[1:18:14] that's a rich god
[1:18:18] i began to think about
[1:18:22] paul one time before he was paul
[1:18:26] when he was still the old man he was
[1:18:27] stoning stephen
[1:18:34] stephen looked up he said i see jesus at
[1:18:37] the father's right side
[1:18:41] this is how much mercy god had
[1:18:44] if we could put it in today's terms a
[1:18:46] message preacher of the day
[1:18:48] and saul was standing there killing him
[1:18:52] but god would not allow stephen
[1:18:55] to pronounce judgment on him because
[1:18:58] there was a predestinated seed down on
[1:19:01] the inside of saul
[1:19:03] and all that saul needed for that
[1:19:05] predestinated seed to come forth
[1:19:08] was just one walk down the road to
[1:19:11] damascus
[1:19:13] and because god knew there was a seed
[1:19:15] there
[1:19:16] and because god knew that damascus was
[1:19:19] coming
[1:19:20] he would not allow stephen to pronounce
[1:19:23] judgment on him
[1:19:24] and stephen said oh father lay
[1:19:27] not this sin to his targets oh if
[1:19:31] stephen would have laid the sin
[1:19:32] there paul would have never been apostle
[1:19:34] paul but because
[1:19:36] god is rich in mercy he took the
[1:19:39] blasphemy from
[1:19:40] paul and put it under the blood
[1:19:47] i began to think about
[1:19:52] when gross darkness begin to cover the
[1:19:55] earth
[1:19:58] i'm going to tell you you can you can
[1:20:00] listen to the radio
[1:20:03] you can get on facebook
[1:20:06] you can watch the news
[1:20:09] it's dark it's gross darkness
[1:20:14] i feel brother keith that it's about
[1:20:15] like it was in egypt where the scripture
[1:20:17] said it was a darkness so dark you could
[1:20:19] feel it
[1:20:22] but i was out in sabino canyon a few
[1:20:25] years ago
[1:20:27] a dear friend of mine and he took me up
[1:20:30] there and
[1:20:32] i don't know if any of you ever been to
[1:20:33] sabino canyon
[1:20:36] it's precious so you may know this
[1:20:40] but i'm gonna tell you again
[1:20:45] we walked up and sabino canyon you know
[1:20:49] comes down like this
[1:20:52] and then there's just this one little
[1:20:53] mound that kind of sticks up and
[1:20:55] we were standing there and the brother
[1:20:57] told me he said brother cliff he said
[1:20:59] you're standing
[1:21:01] where the prophet of god was standing
[1:21:04] when the sword came in his hand
[1:21:08] and i looked up and out of sabino canyon
[1:21:11] there's this little dip
[1:21:15] and the brother told me he said brother
[1:21:16] cliff he said that time of year when
[1:21:18] brother branham was up there he said the
[1:21:19] whole canyon would be dark
[1:21:22] he said but where the sun comes up it
[1:21:24] comes up right over that little dip
[1:21:27] and he said because this little mound
[1:21:29] stands up
[1:21:30] he said the rest of the canyon would be
[1:21:32] in black darkness
[1:21:34] he said but there was light right there
[1:21:37] and i began to think that the message of
[1:21:39] the hour came
[1:21:40] the sword came into the hand of a strong
[1:21:44] hand of faith
[1:21:45] and though the rest of the world was in
[1:21:47] darkness and in gross darkness the
[1:21:49] scripture
[1:21:50] isaiah 60 and 1 says but arise
[1:21:53] and shine for thy light has come it
[1:21:56] wasn't a light for all of the canyon
[1:21:58] it was a light for those who had been
[1:22:00] caught up and brother branham tells us
[1:22:02] that we're not in a laodicean church age
[1:22:05] he said we've been called up he said god
[1:22:08] pull the bride out of the church
[1:22:10] what was it light shined on the bride
[1:22:15] it was god rich in mercy darkness
[1:22:19] upon the earth but god sent a message to
[1:22:21] call you out
[1:22:24] brother branham says in the seal of
[1:22:26] christ he said it's god's mercy first
[1:22:28] before judgment
[1:22:30] he said and i'm sure that's what america
[1:22:32] is hearing now
[1:22:33] god's mercy presented to the people
[1:22:36] before judgment
[1:22:37] what was the message of the hour his
[1:22:39] mercy
[1:22:42] you know people are walking away from
[1:22:44] this this message brother keith and i
[1:22:46] don't understand it
[1:22:49] you know when i heal hear jezebel
[1:22:51] religion you know what i hear i hear
[1:22:52] mercy
[1:22:54] people hear it and they go well he was
[1:22:56] just fussing about makeup and he was
[1:22:58] fussing about television
[1:23:00] i don't hear that i hear mercy
[1:23:04] when the prophet of god tells about his
[1:23:07] vision
[1:23:08] and he said they were starting to get
[1:23:09] out of step and he said i was screaming
[1:23:11] get back in step brother keith i hear
[1:23:13] mercy
[1:23:16] i don't hear it as a judgment cry i hear
[1:23:18] mercy in it
[1:23:21] let me try to i'm going to try to
[1:23:25] i say i'm going to try to close i'm
[1:23:27] going to try to start closing it takes
[1:23:28] me a while to close
[1:23:31] but i'm going to tell you about
[1:23:32] something that happened down about 30
[1:23:34] minutes from my house
[1:23:37] brother branham was he was in jonesboro
[1:23:40] arkansas and there was a little girl
[1:23:41] there she was blind
[1:23:44] she came to the meeting and she was
[1:23:46] wanting to
[1:23:48] want to receive her sight brother
[1:23:51] branham said that i could see she was
[1:23:52] blind and she was calling out for her
[1:23:54] daddy
[1:23:56] he said i just moved around and i got in
[1:23:58] front of her
[1:24:00] and he said i got to where she had to
[1:24:02] bump into me
[1:24:05] i'm just going to read a little bit of
[1:24:06] this story
[1:24:09] brother brandon begins to talk to this
[1:24:10] little girl and she said
[1:24:12] if you'll just help me to wear that
[1:24:15] man's at that's praying for the sick
[1:24:18] i'll be able to find my daddy after that
[1:24:21] brother branham said that was too much
[1:24:23] for me he said i thought i'd been a
[1:24:25] hypocrite long enough i said now lady
[1:24:27] hold your peace do you believe that
[1:24:29] guy's the healer
[1:24:31] she said i believe jesus is the healer i
[1:24:34] said that's right
[1:24:35] i said but i'm brother branham she said
[1:24:38] is you the healer and i said no
[1:24:42] brother branham said she grabbed me by
[1:24:43] the lapels of the coat
[1:24:47] and said is you the healer and i said no
[1:24:50] you said
[1:24:50] jesus was the healer she said yes sir
[1:24:54] but you're the parson branham and i said
[1:24:57] yes ma'am
[1:24:59] she said oh have mercy on me parson
[1:25:01] random she said lord

[1:25:05] tell you sometimes i see god so great in
[1:25:07] mercy i think how in the world
[1:25:10] how did this happen
[1:25:14] he said see he said how did this
[1:25:18] ever be he said god knows how to do it
[1:25:21] and i said well
[1:25:22] if you'll turn loose of my coat
[1:25:26] he said and i couldn't pull it no sir
[1:25:28] she wasn't going to turn me loose
[1:25:31] she was holding right on tight she said
[1:25:33] no sir
[1:25:35] i might lose you well frank i thought my
[1:25:38] if we would get a hold of our promises
[1:25:40] that way
[1:25:42] the prophet of god said if you've got
[1:25:44] lost loved ones he said you claim the
[1:25:46] blood over them
[1:25:47] and i'm going to tell you what we ought
[1:25:48] to do brother keith we ought to grab
[1:25:50] ahold of that quote
[1:25:51] and just not turn it loose i'm going to
[1:25:54] tell you he said there was going to be a
[1:25:55] bride in this last day that'd be
[1:25:57] victorious and
[1:25:58] we ought to grab ahold of that quote and
[1:26:00] just not turn it loose
[1:26:02] brother branham told us there's going to
[1:26:04] be a bride that's going to rapture out
[1:26:05] of this chaos and i'm going to tell you
[1:26:07] i'm holding on to that quote i'm not
[1:26:10] turning it loose why
[1:26:11] it's the mercy for me
[1:26:15] he said i might lose you and i said no
[1:26:17] i'll pray for you
[1:26:20] and i said let me have your hand just a
[1:26:23] minute
[1:26:24] i want to hold your hand while i pray
[1:26:26] for you
[1:26:30] he said now after brother branham prayed
[1:26:31] he said i said now open your eyes
[1:26:33] you've received your sight in the name
[1:26:35] of jesus christ
[1:26:38] she opened her eyes she said light
[1:26:42] is that lights said what is this see it
[1:26:45] wasn't too thin yet
[1:26:47] she couldn't tell daylight from dark but
[1:26:48] it shrunk you see
[1:26:50] when the life went out of the cataract
[1:26:52] she said what
[1:26:53] is them spots is that people going i
[1:26:56] said that's right
[1:26:58] she said oh lord i who was
[1:27:01] blind now sees and she gave a big
[1:27:05] scream and jumped out like that and i
[1:27:08] began to thank for the keith about when
[1:27:10] i came in contact
[1:27:11] with the prophet oh no i never touched
[1:27:15] his flesh
[1:27:16] no i never touched the lapel brother
[1:27:18] frank but i
[1:27:19] came in contact with a word that opened
[1:27:22] my blinded eyes
[1:27:24] i was blinded by lust i was blinded
[1:27:27] in sin i was blinded by a by just an old
[1:27:32] natural sex birth but i came in contact
[1:27:35] with a new birth
[1:27:37] i came in contact with a message of the
[1:27:39] hour
[1:27:40] and it took the blinders from my eyes
[1:27:42] that i could see
[1:27:44] what was it god rich in mercy
[1:27:50] you probably know the testimony but my
[1:27:51] dad
[1:27:53] you know he came here and preached here
[1:27:54] not too long ago and
[1:27:57] he's supposed to be crippled
[1:28:01] i don't know if you all know that
[1:28:02] testimony do you know about brother
[1:28:04] keith
[1:28:05] i'm going to tell you you know about it
[1:28:06] brother all right well you're going to
[1:28:07] hear it again
[1:28:09] he was supposed to be crippled but he
[1:28:13] came in contact with a prophet
[1:28:15] and that prophet called his name called
[1:28:17] the name of my grandfather out
[1:28:19] and he said you're praying about your
[1:28:20] son with his feet he said he's healed in
[1:28:22] the name of jesus
[1:28:24] i'm going to tell you something i like
[1:28:27] the way the prophet
[1:28:28] said it he said his feet are healed
[1:28:33] he didn't say that they'll be straight
[1:28:36] he said they're healed
[1:28:38] my dad was no longer a
[1:28:42] but about five years ago my dad had a
[1:28:44] motorcycle wreck
[1:28:46] and his foot was broken
[1:28:50] my mother she sent a text to all of us
[1:28:53] kids and she said
[1:28:54] just pray for your daddy's foot
[1:28:58] brother keith i found that quote and i
[1:29:00] sent it back and i said i don't have to
[1:29:02] pray
[1:29:03] i've got a quote right here that said my
[1:29:05] dad's feet are healed
[1:29:07] and i'm here to tell you my dad went
[1:29:09] back to the doctor
[1:29:10] and without surgery my dad's foot was
[1:29:13] healed again
[1:29:14] what is it god rich in mercy
[1:29:19] i'm telling you that quote it wasn't
[1:29:21] just good for a five-year-old boy or a
[1:29:24] ten-year-old boy
[1:29:25] but when he was 55 when he was 60
[1:29:28] when he needed the quote again it was
[1:29:31] still fresh
[1:29:32] why because my mercies are new every
[1:29:36] morning
[1:29:38] i'm here to tell you you're healed if
[1:29:40] you need it
[1:29:43] i hope you don't think this is too far
[1:29:45] out there
[1:29:46] but i was driving down the road one day
[1:29:50] i'd just been really nervous
[1:29:55] and i i turned on a tape i was listening
[1:29:58] to it
[1:29:59] about that time i just reached up and i
[1:30:00] went like this right here
[1:30:02] and brother branham said what about you
[1:30:04] young man scratching your nose
[1:30:07] he said do you believe god will take
[1:30:08] that nervous condition from you
[1:30:11] come on it's god rich in mercy
[1:30:17] hear about i guess it's been about a
[1:30:19] year ago
[1:30:20] i was supposed to minister in our home
[1:30:22] church on a sunday night
[1:30:23] and sunday afternoon i came down real
[1:30:25] sick to my stomach
[1:30:28] and i thought well i'm not going to let
[1:30:29] the devil win
[1:30:31] you know sometimes we just lay down and
[1:30:32] let the devil win we got to quit letting
[1:30:35] the devil win
[1:30:36] the devil can only win if you allow him
[1:30:38] to win
[1:30:41] i told my wife i said i'm going to go
[1:30:43] out to the car and just sit for a minute
[1:30:46] and i went out and i was sitting in the
[1:30:49] car and
[1:30:51] i was listening this taping all of a
[1:30:54] sudden brother keith i just felt a
[1:30:55] presence moving to that car
[1:30:58] and that presence got so strong i'm
[1:31:00] gonna tell you
[1:31:02] i thought man i don't i don't want to
[1:31:05] leave this
[1:31:06] and about that time i heard the prophet
[1:31:08] of god say he said do you
[1:31:10] feel that presence
[1:31:14] now you might think i'm crazy but i said
[1:31:16] yes i do
[1:31:18] he said that pillar of fire is hanging
[1:31:20] right over your head
[1:31:22] and brother keith when i heard him say
[1:31:24] that i went to shouting
[1:31:26] and i went to crying and i went to
[1:31:27] praise it and you know what
[1:31:29] i didn't hear nothing else that he said
[1:31:32] so i rewound the tape
[1:31:34] and this is how it went he said that
[1:31:36] pillar of fire is right over your head
[1:31:37] he said that stomach trouble just left
[1:31:39] you i'm telling you it's fresh
[1:31:42] it's not a 60 year old gospel it's a
[1:31:45] fresh
[1:31:46] gospel why as i said the message is the
[1:31:49] mercy of god
[1:31:50] and the message the mercy is new every
[1:31:53] morning
[1:31:56] what are you going to do when you can't
[1:31:58] get a word from the lord
[1:31:59] what are you going to do whenever you
[1:32:01] can't get a hold of your pastor and you
[1:32:03] need a word from the lord
[1:32:04] i'm telling you his mercy's new
[1:32:13] there was a brother in our church and
[1:32:15] i'm closing i promise i
[1:32:16] i don't want to keep you too long there
[1:32:19] was a brother in our church back about
[1:32:21] two years ago he was sitting back here
[1:32:24] about where brother samuel's at
[1:32:27] and our church is kind of over on the
[1:32:28] right side like that and
[1:32:30] my dad was preaching and the brother
[1:32:32] fell out
[1:32:34] and you know i like the way god works
[1:32:36] out things
[1:32:37] the brother fell he falls out he he
[1:32:40] slumped over in the pew
[1:32:42] and we had one man there that was a
[1:32:44] first responder registered cpr
[1:32:48] or excuse me uh certifying cpr
[1:32:51] we had another man there that was a
[1:32:52] paramedic
[1:32:54] and both of them went over to him
[1:32:58] they said he's dead there's no pulse
[1:33:01] left in him
[1:33:05] our pastor told the church he said just
[1:33:08] just don't get work don't get shook up
[1:33:10] about it and
[1:33:12] i was gone but they tell me my dad just
[1:33:15] kept right on preaching
[1:33:17] i'm gonna tell you can't stop preaching
[1:33:19] just because the devil gets in the mix
[1:33:21] of something
[1:33:22] you cannot stop if god's told you to do
[1:33:24] something don't stop just because of the
[1:33:25] commotion
[1:33:26] there may be a lot of commotion going
[1:33:28] around just keep doing what god told you
[1:33:30] to do
[1:33:32] and they went down there and they prayed
[1:33:34] over him now i'm here to tell you that
[1:33:36] dead man raised back up and set up on
[1:33:38] the pew
[1:33:39] and he looked around for the keith and
[1:33:41] he said he saw them people standing
[1:33:42] around him and they said he said
[1:33:44] what's going on it's god
[1:33:48] rich in mercy he can still raise the
[1:33:51] dead
[1:33:54] about six or eight months ago i don't
[1:33:58] know some of y'all may have heard about
[1:33:59] it there was a tornado that came through
[1:34:00] our area
[1:34:02] just demolished demolished one of the
[1:34:05] larger towns thereby
[1:34:08] there's a sister in our church that goes
[1:34:09] there that lives there in that town and
[1:34:13] she said that they walked outside and
[1:34:15] they saw the tornado coming from their
[1:34:16] house
[1:34:19] and they went into their closet
[1:34:23] brother keith the closet she went into
[1:34:25] she testified later she said that's the
[1:34:27] closet i go pray in
[1:34:30] and they went in there and they just
[1:34:32] they just kind of huddled up in the
[1:34:33] closet and they began to pray and they
[1:34:35] said lord
[1:34:36] will keep us safe from this tornado and
[1:34:39] they begin to hear the storm
[1:34:41] taking their house and when they walked
[1:34:45] out of the closet they said they had to
[1:34:47] push the door open because debris was in
[1:34:49] front of it
[1:34:51] brother frank the whole house was gone
[1:34:54] but the only wall left standing was the
[1:34:58] closet where they were there praying
[1:35:00] i showed the picture to the church back
[1:35:02] home and i may have it if some of y'all
[1:35:04] want to see it
[1:35:04] the whole house was gone i said i'll
[1:35:07] tell you why the house was gone
[1:35:09] but the closet was standing i said an
[1:35:11] angel came
[1:35:12] and stood between the storm and i'm
[1:35:15] telling you you may be in a storm right
[1:35:17] now
[1:35:17] but i know a god that can send his
[1:35:20] angels
[1:35:21] to have charge over thee that when the
[1:35:23] storm would take you out
[1:35:25] they'll just cover you
[1:35:34] one year ago
[1:35:37] it's about this this same month our
[1:35:40] pastor
[1:35:41] found out he was a diabetic he had a
[1:35:44] sore on his foot
[1:35:46] it wouldn't heal up
[1:35:50] he finally went to the doctor with it
[1:35:51] and he was having some headaches and
[1:35:54] they said sir
[1:35:55] you're in bad shape they said you've had
[1:35:58] two heart attacks
[1:35:59] and multiple strokes
[1:36:04] there he was i watched him brother keith
[1:36:06] he's my best friend
[1:36:10] i watched him lay in that bed and i
[1:36:11] thought oh god he's
[1:36:13] he's going to take him and i was laying
[1:36:16] by
[1:36:16] or sitting by his bedside there one
[1:36:18] evening he turned over to me and he just
[1:36:21] so weak
[1:36:22] he couldn't hardly even function
[1:36:26] he said brother cliff he said the lord
[1:36:27] told me
[1:36:29] everything's gonna be all right
[1:36:32] and i told my wife when i walked out of
[1:36:34] there i said i don't know how he means
[1:36:36] everything's gonna be all right
[1:36:37] because if he goes home it's all right
[1:36:41] i said i don't know how he meant it
[1:36:44] but i just had to hold on we had to
[1:36:46] believe
[1:36:48] the doctor come in and they said you're
[1:36:50] a diabetic
[1:36:52] you got heart trouble you got this
[1:36:54] stroke trouble and they began to put him
[1:36:56] on medications and
[1:36:57] they put him under two different heart
[1:36:59] surgeries within a matter of a month and
[1:37:00] we just believed
[1:37:01] he wasn't gonna make it but i'm a
[1:37:05] witness today
[1:37:07] that the first weekend of february
[1:37:10] he stepped back out to the pulpit and he
[1:37:14] preached to us
[1:37:15] and i'm a witness of something else he
[1:37:18] went back to the doctor a few weeks ago
[1:37:20] and they said your heart
[1:37:21] is fine don't come back they said your
[1:37:24] blood pressure is fine
[1:37:26] don't come back they said your blood
[1:37:29] sugar seems to be okay and he gave
[1:37:31] witness he said brother cliff
[1:37:33] he said i have not took insulin in three
[1:37:36] months and my blood sugar is regulating
[1:37:38] itself
[1:37:39] what is it god rich in mercy
[1:37:47] i just want to close with this right
[1:37:48] here
[1:37:50] you may know this story but
[1:37:54] there's a very famous painting that
[1:37:57] hangs
[1:37:58] in the louvre in paris
[1:38:02] it's called checkmate
[1:38:08] and this painting portrays a young man
[1:38:11] playing chess
[1:38:14] with the devil
[1:38:17] of course you know that checkmate means
[1:38:19] the game is over
[1:38:23] but i was reading a story and they said
[1:38:26] that there was a
[1:38:26] chess master
[1:38:30] that was standing looking at this
[1:38:33] painting
[1:38:35] and they said he stood there for a very
[1:38:38] long time just looking and looking
[1:38:41] and then they said finally he began to
[1:38:43] scream
[1:38:45] and they said what's wrong he said i'm a
[1:38:48] chess master
[1:38:50] and he said i've been looking at this
[1:38:52] board
[1:38:53] and he said it's not checkmate he said
[1:38:57] the king
[1:38:58] has one more move and he said let's set
[1:39:02] up the chessboard again and let
[1:39:03] me play and i begin to think oh my god
[1:39:07] that sometimes we get down to the point
[1:39:09] where the devil comes to you
[1:39:11] and it might be your family or it might
[1:39:13] be your church or it might be your job
[1:39:15] or
[1:39:15] maybe it's just you've lost your joy and
