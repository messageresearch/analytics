this morning and said well brother I hope and trust you still coming by his prais nothing happen I'll be going there asroy to minister so by the grace of God I trust that you pray for us they have a Saturday service morning service by the of God love the Lord as we stand let us stand by the of God we're going to be coming remember we just started on power of Satan's and uh we showed you uh by the grace of God how that this illusion is is so powerful has become the delusion of the whole world uh only because the Bible said they had not a love because they didn't have a love the truth God gave them over to a strong that they might be liive I had a brother I talked with last night uh from Diana South America coming end of ail part of uh he called and said a good friend of here called and said no longer believe this m and basically you know even need the Holy Ghost that's the Bible said if you got the Holy Ghost guide you all you know it all depends on what you a lot of people saw Moses but only a few people saw God behind and that was Joshua and C come on anybody know anybody knows a perfect man there's only one as Jesus Christ it won't be any other outside of Jesus Christ that's going to be perfect I don't care how you try your best he's the only one and our Perfection is in him is that all right amen so we're going to uh come by the grace of God to uh we're going to read a scripture this morning we second part of this message but we want to call it God versus Satan or Satan versus God uh but we're going to start reading uh the scripture according to Isaiah 664 Isaiah 66 and4 this is a pressing time hard pressing yes and so you've got to know what you believing in you got to know what you got on the inside of you and I'm so grateful this morning to know him to know of him to know who he is and to know that he's living on the inside of me amen the same one that created heaven and earth the same one that created all things is living in me he's not not only my Creator but he's my God and he is my husband that might sound a little weird but it's true anyhow amen so let us turn to Isaiah 66 and4 amen glad to see everybody here this morning it reads I will choose their delusions and will bring their fears upon them because when I call none did answer when I spake they did not hear but they did evil before mine eyes and chose in which I delighted not hear the word of the Lord ye that tremble at his word your brethren that hateth you that cast you out for my name's sake says let the Lord be glorified but he shall appear to your joy and they shall be ashamed name Hallelujah is that all right surely will let let us just pray father God we come before you Lord as humbl we know how we thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord we pray father that you would break the bread of life this morning we pray that you would have preeminence Lord bless those who desire to come this morning and could not make it I pray for those oh God our Father who's being distracted Lord away from the promises of God help us right now Lord God in your name Jesus that we'll be mainly focused on you Lord granted in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen you may be seated we like to uh just uh uh thank God for his goodness um as we said we we're living in a time where it's becoming more difficult uh for people to see and to understand uh the times that we're living in I I don't know how come but you know uh why some can and some can't other than election you know that's the only thing I can rest upon uh because I haven't been such a great man of God that I feel like I can Merit his goodness all I know is that it's been the grace of God is why I'm standing here and I just want to basically brag on him this morning a little bit uh because he is all that he said he is and he's far much more than that I kind of really like that message brother uh digs BR uh he's a god of adjectives I can't get that out of my head because every time I need a as a problem arise I say he's a god of adjectives amen I can put Almighty up there I can put Jehovah Tyra whatever I want to put in front of his name he is all of that amen so the Bible tells us that he's a present help in time of need now we said last week that Illusions is something that deceives by producing a false or or or a misleading impression of reality something that you think it's right when it's wrong and we wanted to say by the grace of God that we understand what's happening nowadays the greater Falling Away we saw uh the move of Kenny copelin last week did we not amen how that he received this powerful message powerful message from the pope and then you know he thought it was one of the greatest things that ever happened oh he said about how many years 20 30 40 years ago this would not have been possible but what he didn't understand is that Spirit was working on it from that point on But the saddest thing is is that they are given over to a strong delusion no doubt these men who are now prosperous they seem to be great men of God speaking in tongues and all of these crazy things that they call the evidence not that speaking in tongues is crazy but what they call the evidence uh uh you know the prophet of God said this morning I heard him he says why on Earth did the Pentecostal ever do that make the evidence of the Holy Ghost speaking in tongue and what did they do they open up the doorway of devils y'all hear what I'm saying amen because I can remember even in the church that I went to there were people who spoke in tongues amen and would carry pistol to church yeah oh curse you out and everything else they would do but they could speak in tongu they could shout they could run down the aisle they could do all of those things that we call the Holy Ghost hello somebody and I'm not saying the Holy Ghost don't do those things but it is the Life of Christ whether you speak in tongues whether you shout whether you dance whether you run up and down the aisle as long as you know you've been changed you say Brothers how I know I've Been Changed cuz I'm not what I ought to be I'm not what I used to be hello amen you know but and you know you've gone from Death unto life something has happened on the inside of you and you're no longer the same person that you used to be that's beautiful amen it is a growing process amen you don't come to Perfection overnight even though the perfectors inside amen it is you who need to be perfected not him so he's working on the inside of us amen bringing us Amen to a place of perfection and let me say it like this you're gold and I keep saying that Revelations 3 gold tried in the fire why do we feel like we're going to come to a time and a place of picnics and holidays and oh all of those things when God said this age is a age of fire a age where you going to be tried all the time tested all the time hello somebody and you said amen I'm coming Lord I want to be that gold tried in the fire amen so the Bible said think it not strange when you fall into diverse Temptation knowing that the tri of your faith is what more precious than gold gold fine gold however you want to say it amen because realize amen what we are now developing or grow going into is eternal I can't explain it I just know that it is now we're going to read uh by the grace of God let us turn to Isaiah 14 Isaiah 14 I'm going to show you something uh hopefully the Lord will it's nothing uh so deep but I when I was reading this the holy spirit says something to me and I'm going to say it to you what the way he said it to me amen so I I I'm looking Isaiah the 14th chapter and the 12th verse we're speaking of Lucifer I actually don't like calling him that but because the Bible says Lucifer I read it that way he's a devil Lucifer sound like you know a prince you know what I mean amen how art thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did weaken the Nations for thou H has said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will set also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north brother bradam said he did it he is the God of this evil age he is now setting above the stars of God fallen stars I will Ascend above the heights of the cloud I will be like the most high yet thou shall be brought down to hell to the size of the pit now I want you to understand what this is what's happening you know the holy spirit said locked in there Lucifer Satan is locked in this scripture he can't get out of it he's in prison where the scripture sets us free the scripture places him behind bars he's literally locked into the scripture that there is no remixing revising this is it I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high yet thou shall be brought down to Hell to the sze of the pit they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider the saying is this the man that made the Earth to tremble that did shape kingdoms one of the most humiliating things I've ever seen amen even in Hollywood is when someone sets a trap for someone else and they end up falling into the Trap themselves and that's how it is with Lucifer that's how it is with the Devil the Trap he set for us has become his own trap the ditch he dug for us has become his own ditch so you and I must realize amen if this scripture how many of y'all believe this scripture is right he can't go beyond it the this scripture it is his boundaries he cannot PR Prosper he can't go no further than the word has declared he can go now let's move on they that see him see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider you saying is this the man that made the Earth to tremble that did Shake kingdoms I wish people could read that word man and they can understand the serpen SE a little bit that made the world as the Wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof that open not the house of his prisoners thank God for Christ if the Lord Jesus had not conquered death and hell and the grave we would still be in prison even those who died in the anian day because Lucifer devil will not open his prison door it took the Messiah it took Christ himself to go open the prison door took the keys of death hell and the grave and loosed see so therefore no man can say God there was no way made for me all the kings of the Nations even all of them lie in glory everyone in his own house but Thou Art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch and as a remnant of those that are slain thrust through with the sword that go down to the stones of the pit as a carcass trod under feet thou shall not be joined with them burial because thou has destroyed thy land and slain thy people the seed of the evildoers shall never be renowned I don't care how great it looks this world look like they're on top of everything they will never be renowned with God prepare listen all of this all that you see all of this what we call Prosperity all of this thing we call Glamour all of this thing that we call uh wealth will be destroyed everything will go down with Lucifer and and you you got to understand now why people in the new age and why people in this luciferian worship why they think he is God because what they do they twist the scripture they make him the winner they make Cain the real seed they they they twist everything and makes it a lie so they really believe by way they see things Lucifer really is God because in this day and age evil prevails according to the Natural Eye y'all hear what I'm saying so how can you say look where's Christianity on the bottom of the totem pole you see what I'm saying and look where all of the wickedness is evil has become good right and it's just it's his his way of deceiving but thank God we have a prophet that described and told us what this age was he said this was Satan's Eden this is Satan's Paradise now if this is if this is the best he can do God have mercy on those who follow him the Bible says amen if a man have hope only in this world he is most of all most men miserable of all me most miserable is that right so we realize amen if all your trust all your hope all is in this world you're miserable that's why the Bible says set your affection on things above I'm telling you people that's the only thing that's going to keep you with joy is when you began to focus on Calvary focus on the coming of the Lord focus on the kingdom that is here and is to come that's what keeps you in Joy with God enjoying with God is that right but look what he says now at the 20th verse says Thou sht not be joined with them in bual because thou has destroyed the land and slain thy people the seed of the evildoer shall never be renowned I don't care how many time they call them Divas those Divas are devils and I don't care how much glim glitter and Glamour and diamonds and all all of these things they're all going up in fire y'all hear what I'm saying he said it won't be water it's going to be fire so what what are we what are we looking for that's why the Bible said if you seek first the kingdom of God and is righteousness all things all things will be added why because it's yours anyhow it really is it's ours now my my thing is is that I find out that so many people we're coming in this last day I'm going to tell you something the storm that's coming folks you better believe you got to have something this storm that's coming Ain't No No Light Whirlwind come on somebody it is going to be a real tough time if you think it's hard now give it if the Lord car give it a few more years I hope not but that's just my personal thing because I believe no one there's not one one person added all that can be saved will be saved not one person is added to this bride not one it's not my will but his will and all that the father has given will come that that's just it now I'm working with something because I want you to understand Satan has always defied God and the Lord knew he would but now the thing about it is in our age s has come in a more subtle way he's not taking us to the guillotine burning us at the stake or anything like that he's giving us science and science takes away your faith it has been science it has been the reasoning you know it is like people wants to update God's word there's no such thing God's word has it just doesn't need need updating it is God you can't revise it he's the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah and the thing is you and I must learn to truly trust in him I said that about Lucifer I said that about his seed because you understand his seed is locked into the same scripture he's in like God's seed is locked into the same scripture God is in everything that applies to Jesus Christ applied to the SE need of God everything what He Is We are in this present world is that the word and what the devil's children are is what they are saints of God they can't change you know a corn can't turn into a weak it is what it is but thank God that God has given you ears to hear you know we have we have we have we have we have come to a place and and we work with this uh we work with denominational people all the time and you know we don't want to dechristianize them but I want you to understand what the prophet of God said he said that they are truly worshiping the devil not knowing it and if they're worshiping the devil and not know it you're the light of the world excuse me don't mean the point you're the light of the world and you're the only one that can show them the difference hello somebody it cuz we got to look Beyond Rel ReliOn and seek for election y'all hear what I'm saying it is the election that brought you out it is the election that gave you ears to hear it is the election that opened your eyes it wasn't your intellect or anything it was election it's not what we do for him it's what he's done for us we are under the abrahamic Covenant don't ever forget that because I'm going to tell you something that is the illusion remember I told you we showed you how the pope kept calling uh Kenny copel and brotherr and you know Brethren and you know who's the blame you know we all come short and Jesus Christ is the flattery and I showed you in Daniel the 12th chapter the word of God said he would come in with flatteries but the Bible call him vile you go out there and tell somebody that the pope that's in office right now is vile they'll think you crazy but the Bible said he'll be vile amen unclean and he's got a wicked intent behind him oh but you see the cathic can speak in tongues now too right right this is something uh uh uh uh we we know to be true and yet we're looking at this thing we looking at this thing and we're almost like I don't know whether the people are just trying to close eyes to it or what but why I'm preaching on this is because that's what's happening prophecy is being made clear through the events that we are now undertaking you know I had a pastor brother tell me he says oh brother I'm so glad you sent me that article he said because he said I know what knew it was happening but it made me feel so good to see now it really is happening we're in a uniting and it's so amazing because God inspired me to preach that message on Unity not knowing what was going on behind the scen now my point is if they are uniting you and I must unite not by church membership but by the Holy Ghost I was listening to choosing of a bride brother BR called those people down he said cry out to God as if you're dying that's what he said quote cry out to God as if you are dying as if this is your last time come on he somebody now if that was what he instructed them to do what about us we're too starch we too stiff we too proud We too a little bit of everything we got too much of us living still hey somebody you don't have to do that here go home somewhere get in your car ride down the road find you some bushes whatever but you need to break through that's the most important thing he said listen he said they will do it when the squeeze come he said they'll do it but it'll be too late you can't wait till the squeeze come to cry out he said that's exactly what what uh uh uh Esau did sold his Birthright he cried and he couldn't break through at the time see now is the time well I got to find you cannot the devil is not going to give you time to find he's taking taking your time you got to take your time you see what I'm saying you got to make it you got to drop it you got to you got to cease whatever and this is what you must do all right God didn't send the children of Israel into battle till after the day of Pentecost Holy Ghost and Fire you're going to have power after which the Holy Ghost he didn't send them into battle and God can't move until you the bride until we all sealed away and I believe that's the hindrance it ain't the preach it ain't the Deacon it ain't the Usher it's you and I we've got to be completely sealed away he can't move we got his hands tied we locked in the scripture y'all hear what I'm saying we're locked and until that is made manifest Amen in every true bride of seed life we ain't going nowhere amen am I making sense oh it is an illusion and that's what he's done he's made he's given us a lot of religion to make us think we're all right oh people the grace of God Reigns on the just and the unjust you can't say oh well I ain't doing so bad come on we're in the worst condition ever if we not SE it or have that Holy Ghost we're standing in a danger zone Hal Hallelujah help us Lord how many of us need more of God I do I do I'm not ashamed to say I need more of him amen we're going to come from Titus 3:3 for we ourselves also were sometime foolish disobedient deceived serving diverse lust and Pleasures living in Malice and and EAS uh uh uh hateful and hating one another H malice and envy yes hateful and hating one another hey were we not it's not what we supposed to be now the Bible said we once were we there was some time we did it all all of us did it but we got to be careful in this age Galatians 37 says be not deceived God is Not mocked but whatsoever a man Seth that shall he also read That's the Law that is absolutely law you cannot s something and expect not an in turn a incoming it's you're going to reap it oh I'm a preacher that don't make no difference I'm a deacon that don't make no difference I'm a bishop that don't make no difference we all will have to give account for the Deeds Done in our bodies hello somebody it's true anyhow Now understand what's going to happen if we don't seek repentance if we you me I don't care you know what Satan started off in church too don't you ever think amen well you know oh that brother fell away oh so did Lucifer huh he was he was the he was the choir director whatever he was amen he was the head of music and everything else so he fell away were they surprised maybe some of the Angels were God wasn't and if Lucifer can follow away what what Paul said let me be careful lest I myself find myself a gast away I got to be careful Paul said the angel to the Ephesus Church a had to be careful he had to Works walk circumspectly now we're in a place we must redeem the time we done lost so much time playing with God playing come on somebody oh we done lost so much time think about God's grace now we don't lost so much time amen just just doing whatever not the will of God but our own will well I'm going tell you if we don't repent what's going to happen to you 2 Timothy uh 3:13 but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived in other words there's no listen if you don't repent you and I of whatever it may be guess what you don't get better you're going to get worse amen huh repentance keeps you from getting worse it cleanses you of the spirit that makes you evil a Meek man is one who does the will of God that's why Moses was so Meek he was the meekest of all men because he did the will of God Jesus was me because he did the will of God blessed are the meat oh my God help us Lord cuz I want you to understand you're doing this or the other you're either serving God or you're serving the devil I was telling the brother the other day I saids Lord help me I said in everything my music my everything that I listen to Everything I Do I said because I want you to understand there's only one way of worshiping God and that's in spirit and in truth it might be spiritual oh I feel the anointing but is it true see it it's things that God has been waking me up to amen the reality of what Satan is doing is an illusion he makes it look spiritual when it's not think about the bride and and versus the lean Church age group they literally they thought they were actually worshiping God they were brother said it was Christian lyrics to Rock and Roll it's true anyhow we got to repent Hallelujah and and you know that it's just amazing because they thought they were going to go up but it was though the spirit was right the truth the word was wrong so it took him down instead of up am I making sense see listen your joy doesn't come by way of Music your joy comes by way of the Holy Ghost music might have stimulated but it's supposed to be something that you should supposed to have supposed to have anyhow hey somebody come on I was telling I think it was Brother Rich I said when I came out here God stripped me from everything cuz he knew how much I love music he knew how much I love to sing he knew and he stripped me of everything no music no nothing ain't no fine choir here H we barely making the Joyful Noise y'all hear what I'm saying and God come I told him I said but see God knows I love him more than anything Hallelujah hey I can worship him even without all of that I love him anyhow he took it cuz he wanted to see how much I loved him do you love me more than what you can do see because sometime we think amen because we can do things you know we got a feather somewhere God done put no no there were Angels way before you and me people could saying five better than you and I amen and where are they in hell but take that man or that woman who can't hardly hold a tomb but it's coming from the heart that's spirit and that's trueu y'all hear what I'm saying when it's all said and done we're not in caves do you think they had a a grand organ in in a cave and a piano all of these things they didn't have the big tamarine in the cave they trying to keep quiet and even when they couldn't sing they had Joy hey somebody that's joy unspeakable joy so much so they were willing to run to the Lions W come on somebody oh people if we can see the delusion Satan got our minds in the wrong places and then we come to show and declare that Jesus Christ is is God not by the emotional sin but by the word and the life that he's want to live through US anybody can jump and Shout is that okay Luke 2218 says and he said take heed that you be not deceived for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and the time draweth near here go ye not therefore after them all right so he said there many going to come saying that I am Christ you know I honestly honestly I there were so many great old singers I I I liked and um I'm trying to think of the one that I really liked and I I've sang some of her songs then I began to watch her and God moving on YouTube and she moved from the plain face to makeup and then from makeup to cutting the hair and yet now she's singing a little bit of jazz I sung a song in Africa and I was wondering why the people weren't playing for me and afterwards they said no brother that's Jazz now I didn't know it I honestly didn't know it but that's what they told me and when I when they told me I I hadn't sang it since they could know by what I was doing it was was Jazz but listen I didn't know that was Jazz but I was edicated and I'm glad that God gave it to me right amen he could have left me going on listen and I've sang that song many times and the anointing would fall might have been Spirit but it wasn't truth oh y'all getting quiet on me now cuz I'm telling you the truth brother bam listen a lot of people said well why a fing that Prophet no more I never followed him he was going off the scene I followed Jesus it was the Jesus Christ he preached I followed yeah I making sense how can you follow brother brand he ain't here it was the Lord Jesus the message the word that I followed wo but let's look at what he says in this quote some somebody sent me a precious brother he said but I want to bring another thing into your uh into your remembrance if God sent the messenger and Vindicated it by the signs that he was the messenger sent from God then it's up to them to obey this message exactly they must obey the messenger and have they must obey the messenger and have respect to the messenger see look at Joshua and Caleb they stayed right by his side yes sir whatever Moses was in they was in it too whether Moses was right or wrong they stayed right with him anyhow see because they know that that was God's messenger well brother B was off here brother B was off here but was he God's messenger see I I'm not looking at perfection in the man I'm looking at the perfection in the word y'all hear what I'm saying my point is this do you know anybody who had the Messiah sign outside of William Brandon was anybody able he and all of the rest of them anybody able to go down into the hearts of your life years when you were a child and said listen when you were a child your nervous condition is because you was a you you got startled and you know a dog made you anybody anybody today doing that he said it'll never be another gift like that and from since he went on to be in glory there's never been another gift that way what is it it wasn't the man it was Jesus Christ back behind the man and listen I'm not smart enough to know where he was in air well let me put it this way God told Elijah he said you go tell the tell tell the those who follow ba you scream and holler and and and why don't you just now he was teaching them a false worship he was teaching them a false worship well you go beat yourself and do all this and that he said go do that let's see if he answer the whole time he's keeping his cool building his altar putting the water on it and everything else see because he realized the word was being restored and it was the restored word that brings God down that brings the fire down [Music] Hallelujah and look at him now you know it's true you know you look at it and there's a balance in everything but you look at how people are now beating themselves and carrying on you know and doing all they can people of God uh it was in 1973 74 I had a music music teacher that told me one of these old days they'll be dancing choreographically in the churches and they're doing it and they think that's God what a deception women with leotard and all that kind of stuff on y'all hear what I'm saying and they really think that's [Applause] God what an apostasy and nowadays if you don't have a a praise team or a worship team you ain't in it you ain't with it come on up that ain't up that's down amen but they think that's God all that is the effect of Hollywood and Satan Satan's illusion listen I'm going on now he says listen you got to love your pastor you got to know that he's a human being but God has made him his Pastor God made him his Pastor the Holy Ghost has made him overseer then you've got to respect him in that manner and no matter what the past is done if you respect him in your heart as God's servant God will respect you for doing it message respect Jeffersonville 1061 you know you know because a lot of time it's true folks y'all know this is true in the message churches pastors get the least respect he's a brother and we leave him there that's why a lot of time people have Brothers have said okay don't address me as brother no more address me as Pastor I I'm not asking for that but my point is sometime people get confused and they forget the office that the man of God holds and they fail to see that he's the angel to the church he is the Angel to the church I didn't make me this no Pastor makes himself most Pastor want to run God knows is knows this the truth I'm standing in the Holy pit of God I would have quit long time ago if I didn't fear God I'm scared many times I thought but I don't want no whooping I'm being with you amen not because of the people because of me often times pastors feel oh how unworthy we feel cuz we battle too we come short too and yet God has chosen us to preach to speak may God have mercy on us amen but listen what we must realize and I hope it's okay this morning we're looking at Satan God versus Satan or Satan versus God and I said earlier the whole thing is the word versus science right because I want you to realize what makes us so lazy here in America versus those somewhere overseas who don't have much science right we can go I go in I go in the uh supermarkets thing sometime and I think I know people ain't buying all this food you you know God they can't be eating up all that food but they throwing probably two-thirds of it away and rather giving it to you they throw it away and mark the prices up to cover the loss now you think God God ain't going to judge us for that y'all hear what I'm saying but it makes us feel rich it makes us feel puts us in a place amen where we don't have to say Lord give us this day our daily bread some people won't even eat the back of the bread you know how the back and some people won't eat that I remember the time you know we were so hungry we fight for it I can remember the time amen mold would be on the bread you think we threw the bread away we picked that piece of mold off my mama said that mold ain't up fill us in go on boy eat that bread it might have not had the best of taste but we ate it we put it down y'all hear what I'm saying those were times when people needed God and L see a science as as literally made us lazy it's true you've heard me preach on it but I want you to know that's his deception that's where Satan deceives us because we naturally get along we feel like we okay with God that's not true y'all hear what I'm saying there are millions of people who are naturally getting along and if they should die right now they go straight to hell I I I was thinking what shall wash away my sin nothing but the blood of Jesus what can make me whole again nothing but the blood of Jesus Hallelujah is that all right nothing but the blood of Jesus nothing but this bleeding bloody word that can make us whole and let me say it like this folks this is not time and I know all of us are going through things the other the other night when I was so sick I I I I don't know whether I told my wife this or not I was talking to somebody on the phone I said man I said I thought I was getting ready to change dimension seriously I thought I was getting ready to change di mention I was seeing things with my eyes open and closed still don't understand what I was looking at so I'm telling you when you you you you laying on your bed that's just how quick it can happen you don't need this this drama to die you know so when you look at this thing you think oh God this is where I'm going we cannot allow ourselves to go with modern Theory it must stay with the word I don't care what the modern modern uh people are doing you and I must stay with the work give me that oldtime religion amen you hear what I'm saying because look at what the church did 1963 like you we said and we've seen many times women as they were all look holy just a little leing Le's a whole lump now I heard today that some football team got a female something on it I was thinking to myself they ought to hit her hard and low if she going to be on the field she need to get it come on don't make her do 10 push-ups and I got to do 20 no oh she female so she's out here in the mail make her do 20 is she tough come on break it on Bring it on but you see what I'm saying what they doing they sissifying every sport I don't mean no harm sisters but y'all know what I'm saying you can't even open the door for a woman right now without her getting offended almost no you go first like thank you I with you you know and it's that is it's just such a deception that's going on in this world that it's it's just hard if you don't have this word this message you will not catch it this is the light this is the light modern Theory well because somebody else do it don't mean we're going to do it right oh y'all are so strict over there y'all don't do nothing so what if y'all want to be on the borderline be on the borderline but I'm going to hug I'm going to hug where the mountain is I'm going hug the curve there I'm not going to go to the edge of the thing so if something come by to blow me off if I'm overdoing it at least I know I'm in the safety zone Hallelujah and it's best to overdo it than to undo it Hallelujah yeah all that ain't necessary but what people don't understand you cannot it's true folks it is so hard for people to see that the Trinity did not come by Jesus Christ the doctrine of that thing is truly devilish and one of these old days we'll lose our lives for standing on acts 238 oh folks it's true it's true it's true because you got to recognize they they said to Kenny Copeland I won't I won't let it die for a while said don't you know we're you're Catholic anyway I'm like what he's taking it he's smiling like with joy Idol worshippers that's all I can think about people what's wrong with you brother I sat in that kind of a church I remember them statues following me staring can't tell me that's God just listening to that message in me the choosing of the Bride I think that's the one I was listening to but he said he was there in Africa somewhere wherever he was I can't remember where it was he said they were doing things in the name of the father Son and the Holy Ghost and they had this chair floating in the air brother B said that's wrong that's of the devil but they were teaching the people that was God he said in the name of the Catholic Church nothing happened Hallelujah in the name of William brandom nothing happened no power in that name Hallelujah he said in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost nothing happen he said in the name of Jesus Christ he said that chair came down boom breaking the leg Hallelujah showing that there's only one name oh my I thought I wrote that thing down uh uh uh brother Kei shared with me different ones I I like when you share with me but anyway um I thought I wrote it down but I must not have yeah here it is and this was in February 2 I just wrote down a little bit of it Catholic training Exorcist training how to cast out Devils Jesus never train his he said I give you power and that power comes in my name you go cast them out in my name there was no training let me see how to do this a b c see there's no such thing it is come out of her come out of him in the name of Jesus Christ training the Reverend Daniel and when I when I saw where it was taking place that's what shook me see I'm going tell you something we God didn't put this little church here for knock there's going to be a Mount Zion Showdown whether you want to believe it or not here in this area there going to be a mount Z Showdown because you see Janice and jamers raising up the Reverend Daniel Fleming of St Pas the 10th Catholic Church in Urbandale is one of the 50 US priests recently chosen to train in the right of exorcism Fleming was named the official Exorcist of the dicese of Deon the official Exorcist my god oh [Music] nonsense devil going to whoop him up too huh like the sons of ska come on somebody it is what it is and I don't even understand here it is you know the Bible said that same spirit and I'm going tell you something you can't play with this Spirit listen brother bam said it like this he said if you he said the mark of the uh the beast in the head amen is to receive the doctrine and with the hand is to is to do the will huh that's the spiritual aspect of it whether they GNA put a mark in your head or not only God knows because I'll be gone y'all hear what I'm saying but my point is amen they said oh everybody that was in kenth Copeland assembly that agreed with that you think the people would have walked out they stood there you could see some was confused but the for the majority all it took was one man to appla and all the other ones went after it they received the mark of the beast and didn't even know it did not even know it because here they saw the pope on tap calling him Brethren wanting to receive him and everything else and he in return sends the pope of message by video himself what nonsense they had a voice in the land that told us about Jezebel and her religion and right now like I said this this Pope right now he's the he's the greatest of all popes he's more lik than any Pope in history whether he is the final or not I don't know but I sure enough know he's setting up a pretty good stage right now we look at this thing and here the word of God listen is choosing wrong over right what is it it started off with a little deed deed of the nickan little deed has brought this church into this great grandor right she's a wh sitting on Seven Hills amen with a face painted like Jezebel come on nobody can outdo those churches when it come to Beauty naturally it's a little spooky to me but it's Beauty to the eye gold here and painted stained glass windows and choirs and all this stuff and you know and and you say well brother are you insane I said I put it this way right now this what I'm saying may not affect you but it's it will it's coming and my point is are you making yourself ready Hallelujah come on somebody listen Daniel said now listen what he said he said now the scripture says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God will lift up a standard is that right but Daniel says in 11:22 and with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him and and and it said it in that term it means forced or swept away like a tsunami y'all hear what I'm saying like a tsunami how are you listen people I know I got it I withand that the Bible said to me that the devil went to Jo to went to God says let me touch it God said you can cuz the devil say skin for skin what will a man give for his own life hello come on somebody what will you give for your own life when the pain is there racking your body come on somebody what's going to happen amen if if if they take one of your little ones or whatever the case may be what are you going to do what are you going to we don't know how far this is going to go we have no idea but my point is are we ready for it we can't be getting ready the bride has made herself ready already ready that's all I'm saying that's all I'm saying it ain't the multitude of people in here it's what we got we need to make best of it and the only way we're going to achieve that people of God is that all of us make sure we're filled with the Holy Ghost and if we are we are automatically unite and become strong that's it because that's the uniting force that's the uniting force so he said listen be swept away with a flood sh uh overflown be from before him and shall be broken yeah also the prince of the Covenant therefore my beloved Brethren be steadfast I'm I'm going to cor Corinthians now first 1 Corinthians 15:58 be steadfast unmovable because everything's being shaken right now but the kingdom Can't Be Moved Hallelujah the real Kingdom Can't Be Moved that's the Bible and that word locks you into that scripture if you truly bride truly were locks you in when God showed me and spoke to me that about that loose for this morning locked in that so true so locked in and if he's locked into his scripture I'm locked into M which is Jesus Christ amen we're locked into the world you said will I be perfected if you're locked if you're see you're in there you got to be perfected God won't leave you undone said Lord and that's the point is no I've heard this so many times no man can make himself desperate brother and I said but but you surely can cry out for it if you know you need it huh God I don't care what it takes make me desperate a friend of mine I I don't uh I'm trying to his name I just had it I read it this last night one of those eag view uh can't remember his name but anyway he's a close friend of mine he's now out in Arizona but he pastored down there in um he pastored in in in in uh Georgia there and uh Henry Henry Wilson Henry he was a close friend still is a close friend we contact but anyway he lost his wife at a young age she was really young they had two sons and I just read this last night not knowing she had two other sisters and they all died of cancer one behind now I knew about his wife and I just read that last night about the other two sisters and they all had cancer and here's the father broken when his last daughter died and they trying to beat this cancer beat this cancer in every way and the cancer was just steadily increasing just like just just going at her and finally she died from pneumonia his last daughter but he said it was during that time he recognized who he really was and that God was the king y'all hear what I'm saying he prospered from that trial it brought him to a spiritual level he probably would have never come to had not those trials came come had not they come upon him you understand me he come and he says I wish I could put it in his words but but it just and that's what that whole little view was it was showing people who had like uh tragical things in their lives and how those things made them better Christians that's what the Trials come from make you a better Christian make you closer to God hallelujah that's what they come to do now come on somebody if anybody would have known exactly what he what Jo not exactly but Clos to what job felt he did job lost all of them one shot hey come on somebody and we think our trials are so difficult and job didn't have what we got at least that's the way we understand it y'all hear what I'm saying all he had was a [Laughter] sacrifice and that's what he had confidence in I know my redeemer liveth hey somebody and though the skin worms eat up my flesh yet in my flesh I Ser him this life means nothing folks don't make the devil think you got eternal life in this fles y'all hear what I'm saying no sir yes I even had a dream about a precious sister of mine this morning and I I don't know what the dream what it really meant but we were somehow I I can't remember whether she was thrown overboard fell overboard but she was down in the water and she had been there a long while and I died down and saw her there I I I began to push her up to the top and the whole time I'm thinking Lord she's been down here so long I don't know how to revive her how can I get her living again and then I woke up you know I I believe God was saying pray for a lot of time people we don't realize amen when we are in situation and we're so low down it takes somebody's prayer hello it takes prayer when somebody else's prayer when you can't pray y'all know what I'm talking about you ever been in a place you can't pray I have I have I've been there I mean you get on your knees and nothing right not even words come to you feel like you've been deserted huh those are times you thinking Lord what have I done where am I what's going on and sometime he put you there just to see how you're going to respond every time you get on it it's true but it's God training you to not rest upon your feelings it ain't the way oh I feel good cuz I had I felt so good in prayer that ain't prayer you can go through prayer reminiscing about all the wicked things you ever done and God done forgave you for all of that and you give it off your knees say oh I feel good why all you did was try to remind God of all of the things that's supposed to be under the blood Hallelujah prayer is talking to God on a daily basis oh my God and and and expressing to him how you love him how you care for him how you worship Him and how you're going to love him unconditionally see but uh but we look at this thing and I'm almost done but the Bible tells us that the host of Heaven all of them will be destroyed and you know when the word of God works about the host of Heaven he's working with Satan in his cre because remember there in that's what Israel worship the host of Heaven the Queen of Heaven and that Queen of Heaven is who uh Nimrod and and all of his crew right so we realize by the grace of God now but the B if you want to look that scripture up and I'm going to go there it's 34 Isaiah 34 1-4 he said the the whole thing will be rolled back like a scroll this this world is getting ready to be destroyed folks I mean the scientists know know it the animals know it they're fleeing but there is no place to run no place to hide and we who are human we who are supposed to be in the image of God we looking at this thing and now as we said last week I mean the whole world they did a they did a survey and now is a 50% of America think that the same-sex marriage is okay come on folks I mean a blind man can see right now my point is let let me move on we looking at the thing I want you to understand I'm not done with the subject because I want you to understand how subtle this thing is this thing is moving in such a subtle way it's like television if it like they said if if they can get you to laugh at it they know they got you if they can get you to laugh at sin they know they got you come on it's true oh it's true you know I I and that's true I had to ask God to deliver me from I Love Lucy because she was my favorite comedian I mean my mama's favorite comedian and the whole time she was just a rebellious woman right come on somebody I mean she was the prettiest redhead I ever seen I don't know whe that was natural or not but but I'm just telling you that's the truth he got the devil took a beautiful woman right put her up there and Mark God word from time one a from A to Z she made the man look stupid right she was the woman of authority she was always correcting him y'all hear what I'm saying she never was obedient and guess what all of America patter now that's all it takes I guarantee you if they put me on the television or the radio and I can come up with something stupid if I could just develop a crazy laugh I guarantee you the whole world will started it's true they they they all I got to do is be a renounced actor and I can just go just after somebody say something and I guarantee you it'll it'll become a fat or whatever everybody will start laughing why it's spiritual because all those stars are ministering spirits come on somebody it's true and if you ever listen to a gospel song and you don't get up spiritual you thinking crazy thoughts now you just picked up the spirits of those who were just singing see what we don't see the spirits that's being ministered we just hear the sound come on or the words not all of us but y'all know what I'm saying my point is this you and I are living in a day where people are becoming more blind if there's such a thing people are be they're just blind and the Bible I said last week you are the light of the world if you lose the Bible said if you lose if the salt lose it sa what good is it you might as well be tried under fooot that's why the the foolish version get that because they lose it they lose their Direction they lose their purpose for what they come in this age to be and we can't lose that it doesn't matter death don't mean no thing I was born and didn't ask to be born so when it's time for me to die I have nothing to say about it none of us do but when that time come it's going to come whether you like it or not you better be ready my point is this are you sealed with the Holy Ghost and if if if if if you don't feel and believe that you are you need to get somewhere to God answers brother Brandon said his daughter-in-law prayed and fasted for seven days before God filled her Billy Paul's wife prayed and fasted for seven days and God f with my question is was that worth it somebody was desperate cuz it's hard nowadays to fast a day somebody was desperate and when you're desperate you'll do some of the most unusual things you don't care care you don't care but my point is whatever it takes and I'm not telling y'all to go fast seven days I'm telling you that whatever makes your clock tick you need to do it whatever whatever you need to do you need to do it and Satan is not going to make it convenient for you just forget it he's not going to make it convenient he didn't make it convenient for the Lord Jesus did he God Jesus said listen the hour of Temptation is coming and that's all I'm saying the hour of Temptation is coming you can't fight with a natural sword you got to have a spiritual sword come on somebody you got to have something on the inside of your heart amen that's the only way you can't listen people of God how on Earth are you going to know the will of God if you're not fing on the word you got to read your Bible you got to pray you got to listen to the messages you can't well I know I'm I'm just reading my Bible you got to listen to the message what do you think he brought it for that's a must you say how can that be a must because the Bible said take this little book and eat and that little book represented the revelation of the word for our day eat it all up he said not just the Bible we've always had it but there's a revelation of every age in this Bible and the only way you'll ever see it is that God revealed the messenger to you huh you see the messenger before you see the message come on somebody right all reveal was the messenger but the messenger was British is coming warning right prepare yourself for war and that's where it is that's what prepare yourself for war and I'm telling you people of God what scares me about a lot of people because we are out of sin and it's everywhere but I'm just en encouraging you this morning whatever it takes I don't care if you got a little bit of muscle left you pull yourself up from wherever you are and get back to where God want you to be in God in God in closing I know it's a prep I know what I'm saying is not easy I know these demons that are now out there they're out and they Loos on you and every one of us in this church right now are feeling the effects y'all hear what I'm saying how many of us in our heart perfectly want to serve God and how many of in our actions we can see you see what I'm saying but it ain't you it ain't you see that's the point I'm trying to it's not you that you're fighting with it ain't flesh and blood it's spirit spiritual wickedness in high places and the devil is making you think it's you it's not you you're the bride and that's what he's come to do to stop you the real you from progressing but you locked in the scripture I I I I got to read this last one and then I'll let you go forgive me I almost forgot it but we know the scripture turn with me to Romans now I'm not trying to beat anybody up I'm just trying to encourage you we all are in this particular thing together we're in this together right and we know the only way we're going to get out of this way is by grace of God the grace of God Amen who shall lay anything to anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justify okay let me read it this way who shall lay anything to to the charge of uh God's elected Isaiah it is God that justify e continually justify you who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died y rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also make intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness of pearl or sword huh I'm locked in there that's my scripture that's your scripture it ain't about your feelings it's what God is chosen you to do oh my every time I think about doubting Thomas it give me a great hope it does he doubt it and he was like that that was just part of what he was but after the day of because you never heard no more about that did you something changed he metant the Living God and that's all we need meet the Living God Amen and God will do something for us but every time I see him it give me such a hope I was teaching this I was just reading this morning you know yeah on how how the the early church chose Mattias to be uh the next apostle there's not a chair up there for Mias there's only 12 and I mean know how Paul took his seat because it's who God chose choose to do and listen they were under the inspiration of the church Matias got a place but he wasn't one of the Apostles that God had told brother brandham says that so you you look at us and we say oh brother Brooks listen I'mma tell you something I don't care what God does for me with be right now I don't I mean when when I say that as long as it's it to his glory now I know there are things in me that need God needs to work with and whatever they are I want them out lot time we don't even know things are in us until Trials come and then we see these things but who's going to lay it a charge to your who going to accuse you ain't nobody accuse none of us can accuse one another in here if we the ne of God your accusation is going not going to stand anyhow God is the judge of it am I making sense amen who should separate as it is written for for for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounter as sheep for the slaughter n and all these things we are more than conquerors to him that love us I am persuaded you know what I'm saying more than conquers through him that love us he conquers for us let me get a witness he conquers for us you know for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor Angel nor principality nor power nor things present nor things to come nor height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God I'm so glad he didn't say separate me he said separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord oh there's going to be a lot of people in heaven I guess we thought wasn't going to make it you know why would they would make it because they were elected and God going to make sure they make it is that right he causes us to Triumph Hallelujah every time I think about that Thief people said if that don't apply to us that was the alpha why wouldn't it be the Omega that Thief said Lord you know have mercy on me recognize his day in his message amen and Jesus said this day you'll be with me in Paradise it ought to put put something in fire put a fire on you because that was the beginning of that Grace right there right there right there right there right there right there the man didn't do nothing but confess Jesus Christ as his Lord and Savior and he was in Paradise in a moment's time so I'm I'm going to say it like this people of God if you are in the Lamb's Book cuz I hadn't got there the Bible said all all word you see names not written in the L of my are you deceived and if you're not deceived that means as simple as ABC how would you to really meditate on that cuz the devil want to say well you're not going to make it in there's no way are you you deceive do you know who your sacrifice is do you know who die do you know how you get into heaven oh Brothers I did this I did that ain't that ain't a lot of people did that and that that won't make it Lord had I cast out devils in your D didn't I do no they did a lot of things that didn't make it who God Justified see what I'm saying is because deception if you ever think that your works is the thing that saves you you are L I'm just saying like this it doesn't mean that because you saved you don't do Works your Works come because you are saved you think saving no you might be building up a treasure you might get a little extra because you've done a lot of work salvation only comes by the grace of God the word amens himself and now let me put it this way it doesn't I don't say that for you to get doitory and lazy but my point is this if you think that you going to make heaven without the sacrificial L you are totally blind it ain't work always been Grace will be hello somebody and that's where the problem is with us that's why a lot of us can't live Christian life because we trying to work our way and every time we make mistakes we always beating ourselves up and putting oursel in jail forgetting is the grace of God forgetting amen that these these things God knew you couldn't do it in the beginning that's why he sent his son Jesus is an unconditional Covenant amen that you're supposed to love him and keep his commandment not because you fear him you love him he said if you love me you stand I believe that a man supposed to approach the throne of God not just once a day but as often as he can I believe a man also should always walk in worthy being worthy of the of the Lamb put it this way if you got a a germ killer put it in the bottle everywhere you go you ought to take that germ killer with you that's what this world is full of Journey right and every opportunity you get a chance to spray your bottle keep you from being infected that's your prayer y'all hear what I'm saying you spray in your bottle Lord keep this germ away from me don't let me get sick right and that's what you and I must recognize the blood of Jesus Christ like brother say doesn't save you it keeps you saved election chosen right from the foundation of the world you were saved before the foundation of the world hello and you were sealed before the foundation of the world before you even got here did any kind of sin God had already done that for you and that's it it won't be one extra the only thing is that a lot of us are lacking is the revelation of who we really are because once you realize who you really are you'll begin to act and behave that way the life in you will begin to live its way through you and and there's no way you can stop it once that Revelation comes in love God let's pray father God we come before you Lord as how you know how we thank you for this time and opportunity to worship you and to praise you father we pray father God that you would bless the service Bless the people Lord we come Lord as humble as we know how and we just kind of took our time talking but father I pray that you anoint the words into the people's heart that they could hear not with their head but with their hearts Lord this is a time a serious time a Time Lord a deadly time so many Fallen away so many people losing their Vision so many CAU into the illusion and the delusion of Satan help us right now that we're walk in the light you said that we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus Christ will cleanse us from all our righteousness Lord Oh unrighteousness Lord we thank you for your word this morning we thank you for the wonderful songs that went up before Zion Lord we pray that you would please with the service we ask these things in Jesus Christ name we pray God
