tired but God knows how to refresh the soul and y'all anybody that knows me you know I'm a happy fell I love Jesus and I love to worship him you know if I can't do nothing else that's one thing I know I can do you know and I want to say this by the grace of God if there was a competition of worship I wonder where we would fit because somehow we're afraid it's like but when nobody's looking I guarantee you you're doing something but God is good to us I didn't come to rebuke you I think I just did but anyway I say these things in love when you when you get my age you'll understand if the Lord carry hopefully he won't I know how it feeling but but you must understand by the grace of God we're living in the last days and and we've got to be on fire we we can't be acting like Methodist that's trying to be Pentecostals we've got to have more life and more fire y understand what I'm saying it's not a put on it's a come on when you really love Jesus something happens on the inside and you can't help yourself and I tell you what when if you praise God more you find out the devil wouldn't want to be around you Satan hates fire and the more fire you got the least amount of problems you have amen so we're going to do a a message we're not going to sing we're just going to do we've done enough singing But I want to say this by the grace of God you are beautiful people God has chosen you God has elected you to be here and I'm grateful to the Lord that he has allowed me to talk to his bride or to preach to his bride what an honor and uh you never bother sometimes I get busy I wish I was more than one man but I am not I'm just one but I do the best that I can as we stand let us read the word of God according to Genesis 3r chapter we know that it's not in the emotions but I'm glad I've got some you know that's why God God liking us as Gentile dogs you know that one thing about a dog they full of emotions right right one little thing I love to see a dog do is eat there's nothing like a dog eating how many of y'all can say amen amen when they get to eating and they start licking their lips and you know all of that I like that you hear all the sound too it that sounds crazy but I see myself as a dog enjoying the word of God Amen you're supposed to lick it all up by the grace of God Genesis the 3 chapter beginning at the sixth verse we'll read the sixth and seventh verse I'm going to try not to be long if there be any kind of questions you were supposed to write them in but if they're not difficult I wouldn't mind answering them if they're are some um we appreciate everybody's coming especially those from Iowa City that's a long ride especially when you're tired but we thank God for your being here by the grace of God Genesis the 3 chapter good to see our brother Charles we we've been really missing each other I teased him a little bit like what's your name but I always will remember his name Genesis the 3r chapter 6 through 7th verse and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took up the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat in their eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they saw fig leaves together and made themselves aprons 1 Corinthians 1013 please 1 Corinthians 10:13 there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be temp temped above that ye are able but with the Temptation also make a way of escape to escape so every time we fall into temptation God has already made the Escape we just choose not to take the Escape roote that ye may be able to Bear it because he said he wouldn't put no more on us than we could bear let us pray father God we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for all that you do for us Lord you've been better to us than we have been to ourselves we pray Lord God that the young people will be blessed this evening give us wisdom give us Grace give us understanding not with our head but with our hearts may we see Lord God the tactics of the devil may we see the enemy who is our foe not our brother not our sister but uh evil spirit that have come against the bride of Christ and we pray father God that you would bless us that we may see and understand and not only that be a doer of the word we ask these things in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated I'd like to entitle this little subject the strategy of the devil the strategy of the devil and it just started in the Garden of Eden we know that first of all Lucifer deceived the third of the heavens there and as brother brandham said he brought it down into the Garden of Eden and Adam had to fight the enemy of course the woman being the weaker vessel by way of her creation God purposely did it that way as we understand because God want to be a savior Redeemer is not to look at the woman as if she's nothing but you must understand that she was placed in that position by God and reality is without her falling we would have never known what Redemption would be like so God had a purpose for everything it doesn't make Eve so evil right right but God knew before the foundation of the world what she was going to do he made it so God doesn't force people but he puts you in a position to make choices and he already know what your choice is going to be this is what grace and mercy is all about I don't know whether you ever heard of Snow White in the Seven Dwarf you'all ever heard of that story it's a simple story it's a worldly story but you remember uh uh uh how Snow White I believe it was Snow White maybe it was somebody else but I get a up but anyway was deceived I think it was sleeping beauty is what I'm thinking about the one who was deceived by the Apple but the point is that Satan always Snow White right in the seven dwar yeah the people you know Satan always puts something before you to tempt you Eve had no idea she she she followed through with his temptation with his lust this is what I'm working with anybody know what lust is I'm so glad it should have had 100% because there's not one of you in here that doesn't know what lust is especially when you come into that age of accountability that age where you CH from 12 to CH from 12 to 13 and some of us have found out what that is or was before we even reached that age and you got got to understand that a lot of things are passed on through your DNA things that you didn't even know was there or would discover later on in your life but it's h it happened to come up now I'm going to tell you the truth because of lust that's why I'm saved that's right it was the lust that had control of me so much so that I knew if I didn't kill somebody somebody else was going to kill me it was just that bad it was totally out of control maybe some of you have never been there but I'm going tell you something that's not a good place to be but here was Eve and she fell but one of the things that really got me is because all of a sudden they understood that they were naked and I love the fact they tried to fix it you know and that's how it is with us we tried to fix it but religion won't fix it you got to have the blood of Jesus us only God can fix this you can't you can't control your flesh I don't care how strong your will is right that's right it's going to take more than a human will that's right to defeat Satan y'all understand what I'm saying and my point is that we're not here to judge one another cuz everybody's fire has a different temperature y'all know what I'm saying so we understand but the Bible said with all the tempt ation it's a common thing it's a common thing but you know when we do fall to to to the flesh it shames us It embarrasses us it weakens us it do you know what I'm talking about and how many times you have and I have said to the Lord I'm not going to do it anymore and of course we respond to God basically as the way Adam and Eve did we throw our religion on thinking that because I know brother brandom is a messenger because I'm in the message I'm not going to do it anymore and the fact is you don't want nobody else to know that's right and so when you hide it only God knows you're hiding y y'all hear what I'm saying as I said this morning the most spiritual you are the more demon powers that's going to fight you right and the reason being it because you have a purpose and it is Satan job young people to stop you from fulfilling that purpose that's nothing but the truth and many of you may even think that there's nothing to me I'm just a believe I'm just raised up in the message but let me tell you something there there are millions of people that would love to take your place if they knew what you POS possessed sir never throw away what you have and this like like the promised land you can't stay at Jericho you can't stay with just crossing over the river Jordan you got to move into the land amen and in the land there's Giants there sir there's Canaanite parasites jebusites and every kind of I there is and all of those demon powers represents your flesh and God said go in there and conquer the land is that not what he told uh Adam sedo the land now your land is your body you've got to sedo it now we understand that the weapon of our Warfare are not carnal right yes so what is he saying when somebody Falls or when somebody offends you or when somebody you know uh do something that you don't like you got to recognize that somebody is the devil that's right amen is that the truth it's not the individual you don't help listen you're on the same side and Satan if he could get the same soldiers fighting each other you already defeated because the Bible said a house divided cannot stand you got some people from Iowa City some people from De Mo but you still family hey y'all understand what I'm saying let me tell you something and and I want I I don't want to equate this to my experience but it was an experience when I was in the denomination we had people who was in the city of Lugoff we had a uh people who was in the city of Denmark but when the young people came together we were together we never thought about you being in DeMark or you being in the other place we all were one we enjoyed each other Fellowship y'all looking at me some of y'all but I'm trying to tell you you must put your differences down and recognize that you all are one people washed in the blood of the Lamb can I say this not being disrespectful but your tribe means nothing to God where you came from means nothing to God he's only concerned about where you going youall understand me I I I know how the elders think but if the elders are thinking different uh than the word the word has preeminence now I'm going say it that's what Miriam got in trouble because Moses married an Ethiopian woman yes sir yes sir what and God did not like that now I'm going tell you I know some of y'all so indoctrinated y'all think I'm crazy but maybe I am I'm crazy for Jesus and I'm crazy enough to say it because he's telling me to say it and so I want you to understand I'm not telling you to disrespect your parents but when it comes to the word of God the word of God Is Right all by itself now the Bible said we for the weapon of our Warfare are not carnal Hallelujah But Mighty through God to the pulling down of the strongholds that means strongholds just don't fall you got to pull them down yes sir pull them down where in your mind the thing is when Satan comes with you to a evil thought you don't rebuke it cuz nobody sees you and sometimes you entertain it and once you entertain it guess what you're going to in eventually give birth that's right to a habit or a demon habit you got to bind that thing sometimes the only like I said this morning sometimes the only time thing you can do is give God a praise when Satan comes with a thought thank you Jesus you know ain't nothing wrong with looking crazy I'd rather look crazy than to have Satan plant something in my head and then it becomes uh you know I become impregnated with that thought and then bring forth a devil after lust is conceived it bring forth sin and sin bring forth what death his whole purpose is to destroy you this is not about um religion it is not it's about salvation it's about you being the children the daughters and sons of God and Satan has attacked it to stop you for fulfilling the word now I'm going say it like this he might even mess with you bring you a place like he did Samson was Samson did Samson have a problem come on and brothers don't even tell me if you're a real red blooded man don't tell me that worldly women don't look Goodtime if you say that you lie or something wrong with you cuz that Delilah I don't know what she look like but Delilah made Samson forget about who he was and can I say it like this sometime y'all sisters can dress in a way that will make the sons of God forget their sons of God right right brothers too that's right come on Brothers some sometimes it's so tight the children have to the sisters have to turn their head it ain't just the women it's the brothers too that's right it's the truth and the Bible says are not we our Brother's Keeper huh see that's why I be honest with Y y'all know I'm honest the way some people they do the dance and everything I can't handle it I'm just telling you the truth lust was my problem before I got saved and your mind doesn't forget that's right and what look all right to y'all to a red blooded man Satan be working now I'm telling y'all sisters so y'all can understand Pastor might act like he ain't seeing but I I see that's right y'all understand me I let me move on by the grace of God my wife going to say you give out too much information but she's not here thank the Lord so I can be free and say what I want to say because all of us are matur individuals y'all understand me so I'm going to say to the Brethren by Nature you are a polygamist right that's right sisters understand that so that you understand can I say it like this if you're not feeding him at home he'll get fed somewhere else Holy Ghost don't leave me y'all understand what I'm saying you have a duty to if you get married to make sure that man is satisfied amen that's right after you get married you come out come out the uh he do worked all day and you come out like you just got out of bed with rollers in your head and all that kind of stuff uh-uh no and he done been fighting the spirit of Jezebel all day you're supposed to come in like a queen oh come on somebody y'all looking at me like I'm I'm a mad man been mad 47 years so I know know what I'm talking about some of y'all don't want to say Amen but it is amen you got to keep that man unless he's truly filled with the Holy Ghost y'all H that's why I say you shouldn't marry a man that ain't got the Holy Ghost cuz if he's he ain't got the Holy Ghost his his flesh is his leader that's right I'm just telling you it's a strategy and this strategy was used on the first woman and man and guess what Satan won any man in here stronger than Adam you not unless you got the second Adam in you right but the first Adam produced carnal children I just want you to know that casting down imagination and every every High thing that exalt itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ that means everything that you have learned that doesn't coincide with the word must be brought under subjection I don't care if mama taught you or daddy taught you do y'all know what Idol worshipping is I'm going tell you in the simplest form sir Idol worship is fornication yes sir yes sir right same thing amen Israel fought read judges Israel fought idolatry and fornication the whole time because it's the same spirit amen yes sir spiritually when you leave God and find an idol you have committed fornication yes sir naturally you know what that is a spirit that's why God hated it so much God had a good judge then he had a bad judge he had a good judge he had a bad judge and during judges the Bible said the people was right in their own eyes that means they were full of reasoning amen instead of staying with the word they were full reasoning isn't that true yes sir yes sir the devil say surely you shall not die sir and she took that reasoning yes and when she received the reasoning her eyes were open yes sir now she finds the serpent attractive yes sir yes sir you understand me listen the devil ain't going to send you somebody that looks like something out of somewhere sir God the devil ain't he not going to send you somebody that look like an alien for the sisters he going to have everything you imagine right that's right A man should be in your head and for the Brethren y'all know what that is it's true and don't let her walk by you with that cologne I'm just saying you are working with your senses I'm trying to be real listen I'm not trying to be funny which I know I can be but I'm trying to be real so you can understand your Warfare this is strategy am it's not about just you lusting it's not just about you falling to the flesh but it's all about Satan defeating you because what happens the more you fall the more you hide it and the more you hide it the more distance God becomes that's right you understand me that's why the Bible say confess your faults one for another pray one for another sir yall understand me because if you're not careful God the devil will have you in a pit you know what I mean a deep pit is that right that's why David said Lord deliver me out of this pit right because in a pit nobody can see you there but you and when you get in that pit it's not so easy to get out of because the only way you can can get out of this pit is through confession amen and the devil say what's the use of confessing you going to do it again throw the scripture on him a righteous man falls seven times in a day and he gets up see there is no stopping to the bride once your eyes are open which I'm trying to do today I'm trying to open your eyes to to to to the to the Strat of lust right the Bible said love not the world neither the things of the world now the Bible also talks about let me back up and after you have done this now after you fall and you and you find yourself being brought into captivity then you you you you find yourself acknowledging God back to God back to God I don't care how many times I fall back to God back to God right but when you come back to God the Bible says now you must Revenge all Disobedience that means you got to take measures never to do it again Hallelujah right it's like going to the liquor store and saying I ain't going to buy no liquor y'all know what look is whiskey yeah especially if you had a problem drinking there ain't no way you're going to go to a liquor store and not be influenced but nowadays we don't have to do that we can go to the mall and fulfill all the lust of the eye y'all looking at me like I'm crazy but people of God I'm telling you because I know what I'm talking about I've been guilty and every man on Earth has been guilty amen married man and all come on somebody until God have full control of you your flesh is going to make you know I'm alive and well oh y'all I hope you're thinking and not just understand what I'm trying to do for you because I'm going tell you something you can be a pope or priest and you can go to a monastery and the devil going to show up you know why he going to show up cuz you brought him there the devil is in your flesh right and you don't think the devil watches you he watch you Just Like Jesus Does say prove that for the scripture God says to Jo to the devil have you considered my servant Jo yeah and God the devil said yeah Lord but I can't get to him cuz you protect him you got a hedge about him don't you like that I like the idea that God had a hedge about me and Satan couldn't get to me but then there's a this is a thing God had a purpose for job job in all of his riches and all of his pleasure all of his peace with God he had no idea God was making plans for him to suffer and that's where we get in this in all things give thanks to the Lord because God everything is moving by the power of God you see all the hardships and everything that I've gone through listen what makes you think why you love God why have you tried to quit at times but you can't cuz there's something in your heart deeper than you amen I've had backsliders tell me they're miserable cuz even when they try to sin God is always there he is he said I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you sir you say well prove that to me was not God in Babylon yes sir and he told Israel you better obey the kingdom the king and when you put in in there they you'll be slaves but I still make you prosper sir oh come on if you obedient I will prosper you am in other words this is my doing you understand me and wherever you find yourself I want you to understand there's a purpose and somebody's watching you I even had a Christian say to me one time I wish I could be the kind of Christian you are and I'm thinking what am I doing all I've done was just be a Christian you know I don't pref I don't use profanity I don't go with crazy places you know what I'm saying and I always say to myself but you don't know the battle that's in me if you could see what I'm going through you might even not you might not think I'm a Christian at all my victory is in Jesus it's not in me I could never fight these battles on my own see the enemy is a has a strategy he knows if he can get you to fall he knows he he he has weakened you he knows he's hindering the purpose and just like I said with Samson I don't know how long he hindered the purpose but someday one day Samson woke up and remember he had a purpose now I'm going tell you something what reason why we don't we don't see newcomers cuz we done forgot our purpose we're the light of the world we supposed to be Witnesses not like Israel Israel was supposed to be a light to the world but Israel got full of Pride and because oh we are God's people they didn't care about nobody else Samaritans were supposed to be saved the Gentiles were supposed to be saved they were supposed to see the light of Israel and come to worship the the god of Israel yall understand me we're the Bride of Jesus Christ we don't have time to be prideful we got a job to do our purpose is to win people to Christ but because we have looked at our failures because Satan has engaged you by your lust you feel unworthy and weak and you just feel like you're not able to witness to somebody how you can tell that Jesus is a deliverer when you don't feel delivered yourself hello but Paul did it Paul said the good that I would I don't do and the very thing that I don't want to do that's what I find myself doing but it didn't stop him from preaching because he understood my failures is my victory in Christ amen am I making sense don't be ashamed of this gospel there is none like it Hallelujah if they turn it down let them turn it down but give your chance yourself a chance to witness for Jesus am right that's all I'm saying if he can make you feeling better and that's what it is we have been fed fed up with laws don't do this don't do that you can't do this you can't do that and we're so legalistic and so self-righteous come on you don't even know it how do you know that you're self-righteous when you see somebody else in falter ways and you judge them God didn't give you that ability to judge that that that's right God said have mercy and Grace right and he said be careful how you approach your brother or sister if they fall you got to be careful with that you can't go pointing your fingers the Bible said you got to be careful L the same thing that happened to them come upon you amen amen there's not one of us that's better than the other I don't care what family you came from that's right or the family you come from so we know by the grace of God that you because you're young you have no idea with the Revelation that I have now if I could be young again ah my God y'all see me on the corner cuz when I had the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's all I I had I was on the corner with my tamarine me and a few others and I wanton a lot of people to the Lord just with acts 238 H up and I asked the Lord when I came to this message how Lord how you let me stay in this church in my best years and he said just like I brought Israel to Egypt to preserve her I brought brought you in to this place to preserve you I thank God for the preserving cuz my life I would not have been here Ecclesiastes 11:9 Rejoice oh you young man in thy Youth and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy Youth and I'm like oh my God where is the cheer where's the joy you know we we we we sit in church like we in prison you know we like stuck no emotions but I guarantee you if I got out there and say let's play a little bit of Uno y'all know how it works but this is God this is God show the Lord how much you love you you can't you can't purify yourself you can't cleanse yourself you can you can confess but he's the sanctifier and you ought to be thanking God every time you fall you need to praise God for getting up getting up that's what God's listen when job he said I caus him to Cur you to your face job said God says not so I know him I know him God knows you sir sir he's got his eyes on you like I said this morning don't you worry you'll make it this you're going to make this journey it's him focusing on you even at times when you think he's not looking you're getting making the wrong decision he's still right there to encourage you he's there when nobody else knows he picks you up and ENC anybody know what I'm talking about how many times God himself brings a song to me amen a song of encouragement I know the devil didn't do cuz he the one that caused me to fall hallelujah amen Rejoice oh young man in in thy Youth and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth walk in the ways of thine heart and in the sight of thine eyes but know thou listen that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment what do you he saying go ahead enjoy yourself do what you want to do but understand there's a penalty for it always been God told Adam and Eve the day that you eat of this tree you should surely die did they die and everything after them has been dying sir sir right oh some of y'all so young you don't even know what dying is but when you get my age you know all about it you can't do what you want to do you can't get up out the chair like you get up like you want to get up you roll out the bed and your bones are aching and sore oh it look like I don't go through that but I do but you know what I thank God anyhow I'm still living and I got a new body you understand me this is not your home let me say it like this brothers and sisters if you don't help one another you can't let your best friend do wrong and not say nothing amen amen don't cover that kind of sin if you cover it cover it where you don't tell nobody but you got to tell that person you're wrong you need to repent because if you cover that person when they're wrong guess what it's going to get worse for them that's right and you know what happens they lose respect for you they will and they're going to do it again in your faith y'all understand what I'm saying I'd rather be friends with God and lose a friend on this Earth y'all understand what I'm trying to say because two can't walk together except they be agreed you don't go condemning your friend you help a wounded soldier even if you got to carry him on your back or carry her on your back you don't you don't kick them down you don't stomp them because reality that's you let me say it let me say it again in reality that's you you say well what do you mean one body we many members one body yes sir so if that person is part of that body that's your body yes sir that's his body you understand me yes remember now the Creator in the days of your youth while the evil days come not nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt say I have no pleasure in them right you got to remember listen in the day of your new because listen it's when you're young you can almost handle anything you know what I mean you get up you fall you get up easily but when you get older it's not so easy to get up and like I said as long as you keep your sins hidden Satan has a stronghold on you and it's not going to get better the pit goes deeper you understand what I'm saying it goes deeper you say no man don't see me yes perap David thought that right right he probably thought nobody saw me in B Shea but God said yes I did and guess what happens when you don't repent God shows some somebody else it's the truth sometime they have a dream they have something going on and say listen I I was talking to my grandbaby the other day not not Michaela my other grandbaby and I dream had a dream about her and I said you know I had a dream and the Lord showed me this this this this and this she said how I said well the Lord showed it to me I said but don't you do that and she didn't do it she saw God it was real whenever I have a dream that that needs no interpreting I know it's God Amen and sometimes I do so y'all better be careful how you're walking you never know I'm not the only dreamer there's other people who see things too but I'm telling you if God show you something about an individual you supposed to go tell them in privacy because you might be helping them keeping them from falling and making the wrong mistake well they ain't going to like me they might reject me that's all right I'd rather for them to reject me than God you understand me that Prophet had to go and tell David David there's a man who had a UL lamb his only UL lamb he he treated like his own his loved one and guess what somebody took away that you lamb and Slaughter it David said oh my goodness ain't that the way we do it we judge everybody else we should kill you should this man need to die he retracted that didn't he when the prophet say but it's you David am I making sense yes sir I hope I'm not going too long I'm trying to hurry up but I'm trying to give you something to look at I want you to see yourself off on the same plane everybody else is on because when we take the Rapture it ain't going to be you you you go up we all go up as a body right so also you so a free useful lust anybody know what useful lust is it's a monster yes it's a monster I'm going share something personally with you when I was in the world I was like a dog on the Chain whenever Satan pulled me I followed you understand me so when he when he when I got saved honestly I didn't know what that was because in the in in the world I fulfilled my flesh the lust of My Flesh I just did but when I got saved and God saved me and I'm telling you he saved me so much till he took that spirit away from me almost 3 years I thought I was going to be a unic I'm just being honest but my wife saw me and she prayed for me and she said it was love at first sight I always bring that back to her and guess what happened God took the hedge of white out from from me and for a whole week I couldn't sleep because I told the Lord if you don't give me a wife I'm going to sin now I told him I mean maybe y'all don't know what I'm talking about but everywhere I turned the fire was there I'm being honest cuz I know some of y'all know what I'm talking about but I refuse I ref refuse to satisfy myself now I'm being pling with you y'all understand exactly what I'm saying right but I said Lord if you don't give me a wife and here I was in church I fasted and prayed cuz I'm going to tell you something that's a weapon against the devil when lust comes and beat you up you need to do some fasting you need to do some praying you need to put this flesh in a weak State yeah I know what I'm talking about now so anyway God by way of vision and that you don't have to believe that I'm just telling you my wife appeared before me sister Ruby and another girl in the church who am I like her name was Sandra and I knew I wanted to marry sandre it was in my heart oh she make a good wife sister Ruby I didn't know nothing about her you know what I'm saying I'm just saying and then but it wasn't my Choice it was God's choice and all of a sudden sandre in the in the vision My Eyes Wide Open sandre disappeared and Ruby stood there and I said Lord if that be my wife I'll go ask her now and I did I I because what it was it was like a missionary night and we were had a prayer and I you know and all of that and and and and everything and I went got up off my knees and I at the service and I called her to myself and I I said sister Ruby I got to ask asked you something I said I said would you marry me she said Minister Brooks don't you be playing with me I said I'm not playing with you I said let's go to the bishop oh right after that we knocked on the bishop door got in his office told him about it as soon as we came out people saw me and her coming out of the bishop office and the News hit the internet was no internet back then but my point is it's spray like like Facebook or whatever it is and think about this people I had about I wanton I don't know how many girls who said that God showed them that I was their husband I said well he show didn't show me and they they went against my wife she had a war on her hands because of me and some girls say we be in your wedding and waited till the last week to cancel it to mess her wedding up but God always had a ram in the bush so what I'm trying to say is to you when God show you the right one it's yours whether it be male or female y'all know what I mean by that let me clear that up women if it's a male men if it's female you know right I don't want you to get confused but my point is if God has shown you is worth waiting for amen amen I'll never get over Jacob and he waited for Rachel right 14 years and it said like it he said it seemed like it just yesterday as oh my God I need that that's the kind of love we all need y it's true it's all right to wait if God says wait because you got to understand maybe there's something in that person character that that person need to get victory over before you marry them amen right so I'm I'mma drop back into this before let me know when my I don't want to be too much longer but every one of us has been wounded abused in one way or another yes come on somebody and maybe your wounds are deep and as long as you have those deep wounds that have never healed Satan will try you and more than likely he's going to get victory over you because there's nothing like feeling lonely rejected unloved y'all hear me and that's what those wounds will always come and remember when a wound is not taken care of it literally gets worse it gets infested so your secret life that you now have is going is getting worse and you don't know how to O overcome it the only way you can overcome it is that God heal you of those wounds you say oh brother I don't understand that I had an abusive father he didn't love me you understand me he was always rejecting me giving my brothers my sister s is more money and everything else and then when he comes to me I'm sorry I just ran out that's what he would do to me and all my life I wanted him to love me CU nobody likes to be rejected even when my daddy growing up even when my daddy wasn't around his his wounds his things that he Afflicted with me on me was still directing my life can I say it like this it caused me to look for love in the wrong places maybe y'all don't know what I'm talking about it can made me confused lust with love or love y'all understand me you just want somebody to conf you want a friend you want this you want that and listen you know not you're not going to get it and you're going to always have that going on in you until you say Lord deliver me amen amen right amen my daddy was a something else he died at 89 I saw a dream of him and told him I knew he was dying a't going to die I told my church this church here that I had the dream and I was leaving to go see him and then I would stopped by God not to go see him and then when I called him on the phone he talked to me like he killed me for no apparent reason but I'm going to tell you what it was his wife was a real witch and I've known her since I was a boy didn't know she was a witch I thought she was my aunt and she wasn't feel fill in the blanks but she said to me they called me Junior they said Junior I knew you was different I told Ike which they call my daddy that you was different what was it when she said that I didn't know what she was talking about but then when God opened my understanding I remember meeting this woman at the fairground as a snake Handler y let me tell you something she was a real witch she had powers but she was frustrated because she couldn't use up those Powers over me even when I was a sinner God would not allow her powers and she couldn't understand me she even gave us food and I don't I didn't know she was a witch at that time if I had known she was a witch I would have never ate her food but I did but she figured something was going to happen nothing happened I gave my daddy some money and I gave him some money just out of the out of goodness of my heart he cursed him me I said Daddy at least I gave you some money the point I was thinking is you should be giving me some but the the point is he cursed me and I didn't understand all of this you understand what I'm saying until I figured until I found out she was a witch she took a picture with us and her face the whole face was blurred now I'm telling y'all something personally no weapon formed against you shall prosper I don't care what it is it'll never Prosper God is real so I'm saying this and I'm going close in just a minute for I know that in me Paul says that's in my flesh dwelleth no good things for to will is is is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not for the good that I would do not but the evil which I would not that I do a prophet now if I do that which I would not is more I that do it it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in my flesh you understand me I love Paul CU he was able to separate himself from his flesh he said that's flesh doing that that ain't the real man see the real man has been revived the real man has been redeemed the real man is in the image of God but the flesh still lives that's why Paul said you got to Die daily now I know you say oh brother we don't heard all these things but I'm going to tell you something you can take lightly what I'm saying if you want to but one of these days you're going to have to come back to the realization that you're a flesh and you got to overcome this flesh nobody can help you do that but God you understand me you said well why are you telling me all your stories because I want you to understand I'm a man of like passion so was Elijah so are you and these habits that you are have that are secret they're only secret with you cuz God knows and guess who else knows the devil and he's going to keep coming at you until you allow God to heal you from within do you understand that you'll never understand what real love is until that wound is healed because you're going to substitute real love with lust that's not real love amen anybody know what I'm talking about I'm I'm really serious because I want to see a Revival in this church I want to see a Revival in the young people but the only way you're going to have a Revival you got to acknowledge that you are somebody you have a purpose and you have personally allow Satan to hinder you you ought to be tired of being a slave hiding every time you sin you're going to hide like Adam Adam and Eve that's just the way it goes but you ought to be free the Bible said whom the sun set free is free indeed and where the spirit of the Lord is Liberty some of y'all got things in y'all and you just you know if somebody know it they would probably scone you you know Shan you right but I'm going tell you something every one of us have something that'll make somebody Shan You In the Flesh that's why I can't understand why some of these preachers pastors Lord over the people when they had this you know all of us are saved by the grace of God there ain't no great preacher I I'm not a great preacher I'm a brother that God just sat in this position and people think OHA brother Brooks he's holy here only because the Holy Ghost is in me there ain't no good thing in this flesh like the Bible says but we have a tendency we want to put too much emphasis on this when we ought to look Beyond this and see the real side inside this is what caused me to love the people of God because I asked God I said Lord show me their heart I don't need to see their faults those things are easily seen you understand me but if I see a man's heart I don't care how fault to they are I'm going to love you because I know your intent is to be what God wants you to be amen you understand me I'm almost done you have a purpose and some of us I was thinking today when y'all were singing I said you know what we need to have a choir singing at least twice a month in this church I wouldn't even care if it was every Sunday young people y'all need to be used keep you busy and if you C kept busy you don't have time for flesh y understand what I'm saying it of mind they say it's the devil's workshop right so I'm I'm going say it I'm I'm going say a lot of little things that and I'm almost done I'm at the end of this thing every everybody has a purpose whether it's singing preaching sharing love whatever it is but Satan device is real and I know how he worked on me you say oh brother books what are you talking about let me tell y'all something some of y'all not even old enough to go through menopause or man's change but I'm going tell you something if you live to see that you haven't seen a real devil yet when I first started into my menopause or my man change however you want to call it felt like all my walls of protection was gone if I didn't have Jesus I would not be here today I literally was insane and nobody knew it but me and the Lord but he kept me during that time my son is going through that now so I'm able to help him but my point is this and what what what it what is it that makes you like that is that same old sex Gene that's in you and when your body is in the place getting ready to die it fights right and so you got to understand you know you you you you you you right now you got it good compared to what it's going to be down the road some women lose their mind they go insane during that time men do too brother bam said a man is when he start going through his change he makes some of the worst mistakes I know a man who did that ended up divorcing his wife and then when he came to himself the damage was too too much it was it was already done there was no way he could complete it and sometime we don't understand our fathers when they going through changes but I'll tell you if they're 40 and on up yeah that's that's why they're acting strange and you ought to be praying for them yes amen instead of judging them amen they become schizophrenic I'm be honest with you it's like two personalities working with them and they don't even know themselves cuz nobody is telling them but it still come down to lust I'm almost done Satan use it as a weapon against you because he knows what you're capable of doing amen if you are a singer and you can sing well Satan don't like it especially when the Holy Ghost come down you will become a Target music piano player whatever you are you're gifted the more gifted you are the greater your battle and people don't understand you why is that person look like that why you don't understand the battle but the greatest thing behind that is they still standing they still here we are Overcomers because we have to overcome am that's what that's what tickles me about the Catholic Church they call them nun nuns you can believe there nuns if you want to too nuns don't have babies I'm just saying y I don't mean to be funny but it's the truth they do have them you know yes and they end up killing them and stuff but they do have them celibate priest what what a joke that's not the way God planned it like I said you can be up on the Mountaintop in a secluded place and guess what the devil going to knock on your door I'm almost done James says by every man but every man is tempted when he's drawn away of his own lust and entice am I helping anybody I'm just trying to tell you I can't help your problem but God can and he knows every bad thing every dark thing every little thing that you've gone through but the Bible said he he knows how to comfort us amen he's the great comforter and I want you to understand god holds nothing to your charge amen you understand me he design you to be this way you say oh brother Brooks I don't know about that but let me say it like this what about the woman who had the uh uh brother Adam said that uh God put her out their parents put her out the house and she became a prostitute she had to make a living people people are strange they don't understand but a woman if she married and a a husband leave huh and she's got to work all by herself and she's coming short of making ends meet and she's got children a real mother will sacrifice her own life for her children she will do the thing that she knows wrong but the thing that's in her heart I'm going to save my children I'm going to protect my children I'm going to feed my children listen I look at a mother like that and I said that's a real mother I don't care if she's wrong but God look at the cause amen see what I'm saying God looks beyond all those things that P people look at and and he see what she's doing what she what causing her to do that now I'm going tell you something God put it in a mother like that and you don't maybe don't know what I'm talking about but let me tell you something I grew up with women and sisters and all that who without husbands because they walked out on them but they did what was necessary to keep their family living and going I don't judge them I don't criticize them because if I was in their place I would have done it the same for my children am I making sense so here was this woman that had to do whatever she had to do to make a living and she had a seed of God in her huh all she needed to do was Meet Jesus see I don't care what background you come from God don't care if you save if you see it of God he's going to make sure it comes to pass Hallelujah Heaven wouldn't be Heaven if we didn't go through the suffering oh amen amen that's true so I say this when you're drawn away You're drawn away with your own lust and enticed and when lust has conceived it bring forth sin and sin when it uh finish bring forth death that means it's giving birth it's giving birth it's giving birth you don't wait till it's conceived you stop it right here Satan you a liar you know devil come to my thoughts sometimes and I said oh no those are not my thoughts I talk to him like a man amen I said those your thoughts and I resist that amen right if you catch it then you got it you got it but as long if you entertain it you let him s s that seed that seed is going to grow and it's going to grow little by little right seeds don't grow overnight little by little then the next thing you know you got a big tree in front of you and that tree is bringing forth fruit right at the end of the day that one little seed of lust that was placed in your head that you failed to reject is going to bring forth fruit am I am I am I getting to you I'm almost done I keep saying that like a preacher but I want to say this by the grace of God I am seriously talking to your soul don't let the devil condemn you like that come out of that dark place confess your sins you don't have to tell me but tell God right and if you're involved with someone that you know you shouldn't be involved with cut that thing loose cut it off stop it and make those people know I've Been Changed God has heard my prayer I'm now liberated because now he's healing me amen right you should never marry a man if you you still have wounds let God heal them because it's not fair that he's going to have to go through chaos because of your wounds vice versa man woman whatever is not fair that you have to send somebody else through and they don't even know what's wrong with you and you you flipping like pancakes they don't even know why you flipping cuz your mood is out of control because now the devil has anointed you with the thoughts of your past you understand me it's not right let God heal you let God deliver you so that you can have a wonderful husband or a wonderful wife you know that you can grow up together like children and enjoy your children and all that kind of stuff if any new thing come up Let it Be new but don't let don't let your marriage and things like that be based upon your your your your your your past history of wounds and hurts and all of that am I making sense see cuz the devil want to keep you from your purpose and your purpose might even just be making somebody happy as a husband or a wife whichever it is you give God your best and don't take keep taking that stuff off the devil stop it you're young you said what brother book if I stop it is going to come again hello it doesn't it rains every year whether you like it or not season going to bring season changes but you don't have to go wet get wet they got umbrellas and then they have houses that you can stay in you don't have to get you don't have to when it's all sorrow and everything I know I'm taking too much time but my point is you you the Victor amen walk away from those pains and those hurts and says Lord this is what I had to do and I'm closing I'm really closing this time I cried when I went to go see my daddy I called my my daddy and his wife answered my daddy died from Alzheimer's and my daughter my my his wife thought I put some voodoo on him because I gave him some money that was the last thing and she's a witch so she believe in all that crazy stuff why would I put voodo on my daddy I don't even know what about no Voodoo I do not but my point is my sisters and stuff were very superstitious oh somebody cross your leg somebody step on your foot you know all kind of crazy stuff but the point I don't fear stuff like that that's why it doesn't I've seen God protect me even when I didn't even know he was was protecting me so you know I know it's real now I ain't going to tell you it's not real y'all know it's real and if you believe in it it will affect you and sometime if you don't believe in it it will affect you if you're not under the blood now leave that alone so what happened my daddy she put my daddy on the phone he's in in the hospital with Alzheimer's you know and he's carrying on he's doing everything he's literally cursing me not not cursing but like basically saying I could kill you I don't care what you comeing he was so angry with me and I know it's because of what she said cuz he's thinking I put him in the hospital but the Lord said don't go my M my daddy was a angry man and he had the ability of killing people I'm not not going to go into detail but I knew if I would go he would kill me he would really kill me and then blame it on his Alzheimer you understand me and Brother Rich who sits right here his wife sister Kathy who's gone from Glory God told her call Brother Brooks tell him not to go she didn't know what was going on tell him not to go I came back from I was already over halfway to to to to to where my my daddy lived and I'm crying I'm crying I'm really crying God deliver me from this man please deliver me that's when I realized that my dad had such a stronghold in my life and every bad decision I ever made was because of the way he treated me my mother was an angel you understand me but my daddy was something else and all I can truly say is this God delivered me you know why you know what he said I said why Lord why you gave me a daddy like this he said because because I want to be the
