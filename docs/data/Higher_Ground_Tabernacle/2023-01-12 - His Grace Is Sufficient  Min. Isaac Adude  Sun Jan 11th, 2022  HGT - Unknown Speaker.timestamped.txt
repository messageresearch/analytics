[16:40] thank you
[16:41] foreign
[16:56] thank you for this
[16:59] is not a note presentation but
[17:03] it's something the Lord really laid on
[17:05] my heart that I have not shared quite a
[17:08] bit with the uh
[17:10] the
[17:11] family of God here at Higher Ground
[17:15] um I retired a couple retired from
[17:19] working
[17:20] at uh a place called Seneca Tank about
[17:23] two years ago I'd worked there about 20
[17:26] years worked along Brother Rich and uh
[17:30] just uh had a great opportunity there uh
[17:34] to witness the Lord uh I had customers
[17:37] coming in put me in the out of state fly
[17:40] in and
[17:41] but the the whole poll to
[17:45] to leave Seneca Tank a couple years ago
[17:49] is when I was out in Charlotte South
[17:51] North Carolina
[17:52] and the Lord I heard his voice and
[17:55] and I proceeded to tell my wife at the
[17:58] hotel that night that
[18:00] I'm pretty sure that it was time to
[18:03] retire and she said
[18:05] what she said are you sure can we talk
[18:09] about this and I said well God's already
[18:11] showed me and that was right before the
[18:14] shutdown
[18:15] many of you know and uh
[18:19] that shutdown happened and I went home
[18:22] and it just seemed like it that call for
[18:26] me was put on the back burner
[18:28] and uh shut down happened and
[18:32] went back to work months later and
[18:36] guess where I was at I was back in
[18:38] Charlotte again I'm not playing not
[18:41] thought out that was just God had opened
[18:45] doors for me there and
[18:48] it was an opportunity they had their
[18:51] first ever uh tornado there they had a
[18:54] lot of hurricanes and and but never a
[18:57] tornado and helped a lady get through
[19:00] that
[19:01] fear of tornado
[19:05] but
[19:06] it was a a day that my last day it was
[19:10] in November a couple years ago and
[19:13] and uh
[19:15] the day after I walked out of there the
[19:18] last time
[19:21] I had a guy call me and he was a
[19:23] customer I had worked 21 years at one
[19:26] company and then consulted for personal
[19:29] consulting company for about six years
[19:33] and then another 20 years at this last
[19:35] company and
[19:37] uh
[19:38] don't you adding all that up so
[19:42] a
[19:43] it was uh
[19:45] it was a time when I sensed some
[19:49] emptiness walking out of there and I
[19:51] didn't know what was going to happen
[19:53] well the Lord had something on the
[19:55] agenda first day
[19:58] had a guy call me he used to be a
[20:01] Executive Vice President of a company
[20:03] downtown and I hadn't seen him for 20
[20:07] some years 25 years and
[20:09] and uh
[20:11] and Jeff this Jeff as it was his name
[20:13] and he called and he said do you
[20:16] remember me and I said well sure I do
[20:17] and he said well
[20:19] um is this a bad time and I said no
[20:22] matter of fact this is my first day off
[20:24] from work we call what we call
[20:27] retirement
[20:29] and he said well can we talk and I said
[20:32] sure So we set up the next day and we
[20:34] met and come to find out he had a very
[20:36] rare cancer
[20:39] he had
[20:41] Mayo Clinic had as a client and uh
[20:46] he uh
[20:49] they did all kind of face time if you
[20:52] will with maybe a dozen doctors around
[20:55] the world and nobody knew how to come up
[20:58] with a plan for him in some sort of uh
[21:01] medicine he may take and to help the
[21:05] process and
[21:06] and so he I just told him I said we've
[21:10] got all we need right here and he was
[21:13] not a Christian and uh
[21:16] explain to him what the word said about
[21:18] afflictions
[21:20] and I said I'll be glad to walk with you
[21:23] on this path and
[21:25] he says how how would we have ever known
[21:28] it worked out this way
[21:29] but you know God had it all in hand and
[21:32] uh I'm still walking with that man today
[21:35] his numbers improve right away and have
[21:39] held
[21:40] uh since then and uh so if you saw him
[21:44] today I think brother Isaiah has seen
[21:47] him before and I pointed him out to him
[21:50] and who he was and he said
[21:52] I would never have guessed he had any
[21:55] cancer at all he looked so healthy and
[21:57] but that's that's brother Jeff and he
[22:00] and I see each other at least once maybe
[22:03] sometimes twice a week and uh and
[22:07] sometimes it takes uh he needs a little
[22:09] bit of what he doesn't know how to call
[22:12] upon the Lord to circumcise and I have
[22:15] helped him through that and with the
[22:17] prayer Faith even though you may have a
[22:19] a Believer but he's not walking
[22:23] close like he needs to but just having
[22:27] the grace for him and I thank God for
[22:30] for Jeff and uh and I just pray for his
[22:34] completion whether it's on this side of
[22:36] river that completion of healing or on
[22:39] the other side of the river
[22:41] I just praise God for what he has for
[22:44] him amen
[22:50] praise God Amen
[22:55] Hallelujah God is good amen hallelujah
[22:59] in all of our Lives amen whatever he's

[51:02] I have a little subject that uh wanted
[51:06] to share with you uh I intelligently his
[51:09] grace is sufficient
[51:11] and then I'll read again uh Second
[51:13] Corinthians chapter 12 verse 9.
[51:22] uh Second Corinthians chapter 12 verse 9
[51:24] he says that
[51:26] my grace is sufficient for thee
[51:29] for my strengths he's made perfect in
[51:32] weakness
[51:34] amen his grace is sufficient
[51:36] amen that's all I care about man that's
[51:39] that that's all I want to know amen when
[51:41] I know that his grace is sufficient amen
[51:44] uh you know I'm happy because I know
[51:46] it's not you know what I do or it's not
[51:49] works that I would do or it's not how I
[51:52] will leave my life but it's just Grace
[51:54] in me amen when we talk about Grace amen
[51:58] but the perfect example that I could
[52:00] come up with uh uh uh uh tonight it's
[52:04] about the life of David amen I was just
[52:07] thinking about David and I saw how his
[52:10] life was and and David's life was Grace
[52:13] I mean it was early but it was all the
[52:15] grace of God look David uh first of all
[52:18] he had Brothers amen they were stronger
[52:20] than him and taller than him and bigger
[52:23] than him and they had everything that
[52:25] David didn't have they made a matter of
[52:27] fact even the his own father favorite
[52:30] those Brothers you know more than David
[52:32] but when so uh I'm sorry once Samuel
[52:35] came even even Samuel by seeing those
[52:38] brothers and he was like well these are
[52:40] the ones that God told me this is this
[52:42] is the Fulfillment of the prophecy right
[52:44] here amen because he saw them he was
[52:46] like yeah these people are worthy to be
[52:48] Kings amen and he wanted to to anoint
[52:51] them with the oil but God said no that's
[52:53] not him the second one came God said no
[52:55] that's not him the third one came God
[52:57] said no that's not him then Samuel was
[52:59] like well
[53:00] uh do you have any other son that may
[53:02] say about his father but David's father
[53:04] said yes I have one but he's he's away
[53:07] he went to work and he's not he's not
[53:09] he's not here
[53:11] they met when Samuel came and he saw
[53:13] David amen it wasn't something that was
[53:17] attractive to to the eyes I mean it
[53:19] wasn't he didn't have the composure of a
[53:21] king and when he was there and been
[53:24] sitting there with uh his heart playing
[53:26] for for the ship and everything but
[53:28] Samuel anointed him and God said this is
[53:31] the one amen he wasn't Devin wasn't
[53:33] elected King because he was wrong David
[53:35] wasn't elected King because he was tall
[53:38] or he was big but he was the grace of
[53:41] God that took him from where he was it
[53:43] meant to put him there on top of Israel
[53:45] to lead his children amen he was the
[53:48] grace of God it wasn't the might of
[53:50] David it wasn't the power of David but
[53:52] he was the grace of God when he had to
[53:54] face the lion amen David was not strong
[53:56] enough in himself to defeat those like
[53:58] to defeat the lion amen David was not
[54:01] strong himself to this I mean himself to
[54:03] defeat uh uh the bear but it was the
[54:06] grace of God that was protecting the
[54:08] gift that was inside of David even when
[54:10] he came against Goliath a man's Soul was
[54:13] there him and was supposedly the
[54:16] strongest man in the Army but he
[54:19] couldn't face Goliath because Goliath
[54:20] was it was a big and then giant man but
[54:23] he was the grace of God that was in
[54:25] David that defeated amen that Goliath he
[54:28] wasn't because David was wrong or he had
[54:30] a power in his arms or something like
[54:33] that but he was the grace of God Amen in
[54:35] other words the grace of God was
[54:37] sufficient for him the grace of God Amen
[54:39] was keeping David all this dead around
[54:42] me
[54:42] throughout this entire life and God had
[54:45] a purpose it meant God had a vision for
[54:48] him amen there was a prophecy for him
[54:50] that he had to be the king so no matter
[54:53] amen no matter what danger all the
[54:55] dangers that could have come to David
[54:56] those danger couldn't destroy him now
[54:58] the word David couldn't be killed until
[55:01] until he fulfilled it meant the promise
[55:04] that God has probably that God has put
[55:06] for him until he has fulfilled that
[55:08] prophecy that was given for him amen so
[55:11] David you heard from the prophet that he
[55:13] is Anointed to become a king
[55:16] amen that was the free that was uh that
[55:18] was the grace of God and David amen as
[55:21] the Bible says that he had five stones
[55:23] in his uh behead Five Stone that's the
[55:25] thing that you want to fight Goliath
[55:26] with amen if we tried to imagine that
[55:29] with a human mentality and a human mind
[55:31] that's that's impossible a man a giant
[55:34] man he was uh uh he had all those
[55:37] buckles and armors and shield and all of
[55:39] that and you go fight those men that man
[55:41] with only five Sons I mean people will
[55:44] make fun of you people will say but well
[55:46] you know you're dreaming or
[55:49] you know you want you you wish to you
[55:51] know to die but David knew the God that
[55:53] he was serving it meant David knew that
[55:56] he wasn't gonna die until that promise
[55:58] came to pass so he went there with five
[56:01] Stones amen which the prophet says that
[56:03] those five Stones represented Jesus
[56:05] Christ amen Jesus had five letters amen
[56:08] that represented the grace amen David
[56:10] was going with the grace of God Amen
[56:13] sometimes I asked myself a question I
[56:15] was I asked myself I said Lord why did
[56:18] you leave all those great mans in the
[56:20] world why did you leave all those great
[56:22] teachers why did you leave all those
[56:23] great amen those great people and then
[56:26] rich people and you came to reveal to me
[56:28] you came to reveal you came to reveal
[56:30] your word to me
[56:32] amen I tried to steal myself amen what
[56:34] if I'm worthy but you know I look at my
[56:36] life I was like Lord you know I'm not
[56:39] worthy you know to receive this Grace I
[56:42] mean it's not the thing that I do every
[56:44] day or it's not what I did when I was a
[56:46] little kid that you saved me I try to
[56:48] think of of a reason why God served me
[56:50] but what God saved me but I just can't
[56:53] find one amen by the only reason I could
[56:55] find it was because of his love amen
[56:58] it's his love in me amen that he loved
[57:00] me before the foundation the word that's
[57:02] what the prophet says that
[57:04] and so will it be upon the bride
[57:07] and so is it on the bride we unworthy
[57:11] creatures
[57:12] deserving of hell
[57:14] by his grace holds us through it
[57:18] look at how many lost and blind how many
[57:21] Sinners was there in the world
[57:24] the hour I got saved
[57:27] God saved me from purpose and I'm
[57:30] determined by his will to do that
[57:33] purpose I don't care what any else what
[57:36] anything else goes
[57:38] I want to do it amen there were so many
[57:42] Sinners amen there were so many people
[57:44] that God could save amen but God chose
[57:46] you and when it was not a random story
[57:49] or multiple choice that God has still a
[57:52] man just to uh choose like that but he
[57:55] chose you for a purpose amen he saved
[57:58] you because he knows that I mean he has
[58:00] a work for you that there's a work that
[58:02] you have to do there is a in the picture
[58:04] of God Amen there is a part of that
[58:06] picture that you have to fulfill there
[58:08] is your place in that picture amen
[58:10] that's the reason why you were saved
[58:12] amen but we have to make sure Amen to do
[58:15] that purpose we have to make sure we're
[58:16] meant to fulfill the purpose for which
[58:19] we were saved amen it's like the prophet
[58:21] says that I'm determined by his will to
[58:24] do that purpose amen I'm determined amen
[58:27] I'll Give All My Life to do that purpose
[58:30] and when you have to ask God lord what
[58:32] is my purpose Lord why what is my
[58:34] purpose Lord what what what what what is
[58:37] what is the work that you want me to do
[58:39] for you amen and when God revealed you
[58:41] that work when God revealed you Amanda
[58:43] the job that he wants you to do for him
[58:46] amen do it with all your hearts you made
[58:48] me suck we're hurting on wash night and
[58:50] God doesn't God doesn't call halfway
[58:53] Christians amen God doesn't call halfway
[58:55] singers God doesn't call off with
[58:57] preachers but amen it's you you're a
[58:59] Christian 100 Christian amen when that
[59:02] works is being revealed to you amen that
[59:04] work has been revealed to you I mean you
[59:06] have to pray God lord just give me the
[59:08] strength
[59:09] amend to do your will it's like the
[59:11] prophet says I'm determined
[59:12] by his will
[59:14] to do that purpose
[59:16] First Chronicles chapter 17 verse 16 the
[59:19] Bible says
[59:20] and David the king
[59:23] came and said before the Lord and said
[59:26] who am I oh Lord Oh Lord God
[59:30] and what is my house
[59:32] that thou has brought me this far
[59:36] amen he started to think about the Lord
[59:38] he started to think about what the Lord
[59:40] has done for him
[59:41] and he asked himself he said Lord who am
[59:44] I
[59:45] Lord what is my house
[59:48] that your Grace has brought me this far
[59:50] Lord I've been to to so many bottles and
[59:53] that so many times I faced death but
[59:56] Lord you still keeping me alive Lord
[1:00:01] you're still keeping me alive
[1:00:04] in my Lord and so many people try to
[1:00:06] kill me I have so many enemies and the
[1:00:08] enemies everywhere in my right left and
[1:00:10] before me behind me and they're trying
[1:00:12] to find a way where I'm where I'm sleepy
[1:00:14] or or I'm not looking and to try to kill
[1:00:17] me amen by Lord but you're still keeping
[1:00:19] me alive Lord I go to work and I go to
[1:00:22] school I come back home safe Lord I I
[1:00:24] drive and I I fly but Lord I'm still
[1:00:27] living today Lord because of your grace
[1:00:29] Lord because you're still keeping me
[1:00:31] alive well so many times I was driving
[1:00:34] and I missed accident now you know but I
[1:00:37] I came too close to death but Lord you
[1:00:40] still keeping me alive amen he's keeping
[1:00:43] you a left for a purpose amen because
[1:00:45] the prophet said that once God once God
[1:00:47] is done with you God will take you out
[1:00:49] of this life amen God will take you out
[1:00:52] of this world Amen but because you are
[1:00:53] still alive amen there is a purpose for
[1:00:56] what there's a purpose behind it amen by
[1:00:59] you have to pray God you have to ask God
[1:01:01] for that Revelation Lord reveal me the
[1:01:03] purpose will reveal me
[1:01:05] and Lord I'll be determine
[1:01:08] to do your will amen it's like the story
[1:01:11] of John Newton
[1:01:13] amen John Newton is the one who wrote
[1:01:15] the song The Amazing Grace that we sing
[1:01:18] BM ideas The Amazing Grace that almost
[1:01:20] everybody sings it might even do
[1:01:22] sometimes people sing the song but they
[1:01:24] don't understand the purpose and they
[1:01:26] don't understand the powerful words
[1:01:28] behind the song Amen the story tells us
[1:01:31] that that John Newton amen was selling
[1:01:34] slaves and when he was going to Africa
[1:01:36] and by the slaves and and coming and
[1:01:39] then sell them but one day on this ship
[1:01:41] it was just driving it was uh on the
[1:01:44] ship amen and then and then the storm
[1:01:46] came and killed almost everybody but he
[1:01:49] was still there amen and he cried Lord
[1:01:52] have mercy on us and God saved the sword
[1:01:55] and from that time it meant the best
[1:01:57] story says that from that time John
[1:01:59] Newton his life was changed and when he
[1:02:02] started serving God and he wrote the
[1:02:04] song Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound
[1:02:07] it might that sound of that Amazing
[1:02:09] Grace amen that had to save the rich
[1:02:12] like me and and when other people they
[1:02:14] were doing good works and how the people
[1:02:16] were going to visit other people who
[1:02:18] visit uh sick people in the hospital
[1:02:20] other people amen they were giving money
[1:02:23] to the Poors other people that were
[1:02:25] doing so many great things and so many
[1:02:27] great works but Lord you didn't save
[1:02:29] them but you came to save me
[1:02:31] a Wretch like Me
[1:02:34] I once was lost but now I'm found
[1:02:38] I once was blind I couldn't see your
[1:02:41] grace but now I can see
[1:02:43] amen why it's the grace of God amen is
[1:02:47] the grace of God it's like it's like the
[1:02:49] prophet says that if you try to compare
[1:02:50] amen Jesus versus the Pharisees amen you
[1:02:54] will see that the Pharisees they were
[1:02:55] doing all those great works women if
[1:02:57] somebody needs care needs a consolation
[1:03:00] that will go to the Pharisees and they
[1:03:02] will give them you know those sweet
[1:03:03] words and and if the people are sick
[1:03:05] they will go and pray for them in the
[1:03:07] hospital and if people are hungry those
[1:03:09] Pharisees will go and feed them and feed
[1:03:11] people need money those Pharisees will
[1:03:14] go and give them the money amen by Luke
[1:03:16] but but Jesus said that they were still
[1:03:18] in darkness despite those great works
[1:03:20] that they weren't doing amen because
[1:03:22] we're not safe by our works remember we
[1:03:24] are saved by the grace of God Amen we
[1:03:27] are inside where Paul Roden and uh uh I
[1:03:30] think First Corinthians or second
[1:03:32] Corinthians chapter 13 about love it
[1:03:35] says that even though I'll be able to
[1:03:36] give my my own body to be burned for my
[1:03:39] brother amen look the person to reach
[1:03:42] that level Amen to sacrifice his own
[1:03:44] body to be burned to save his brother
[1:03:46] God but even though I do that great work
[1:03:49] but if I have I don't have love inside
[1:03:51] of me even if I don't have Chariot
[1:03:54] inside of me that will be in vain amen
[1:03:56] it's not it's not about it's not a
[1:03:58] gravity or or or of the work that we do
[1:04:01] amen but it's what's inside and then
[1:04:04] what's inside it's about the grace of
[1:04:06] God

[1:08:57] redemption no you're not
[1:09:00] or you wouldn't be at the church this
[1:09:03] morning
[1:09:04] Grace will make a way for you in this
[1:09:07] dark hour if you're just accept it
[1:09:11] Adam had to be willing to accept it so
[1:09:15] do you
[1:09:16] accept it I mean it doesn't matter what
[1:09:19] you did

[1:09:22] it amen the grace of God will always
[1:09:24] make a way for you amen the grace of God
[1:09:27] the fact the prophecy that the fact that
[1:09:29] you hear me the fact that there is
[1:09:30] something inside of you that is telling
[1:09:32] you that you have to repent that the
[1:09:34] refactor there is the little voice
[1:09:36] inside of you that is telling you that
[1:09:37] you have to serve God that the life that
[1:09:39] you're living it's not right amen that
[1:09:41] is the grace of God for you amen that is
[1:09:43] the grace of God and that grace of God
[1:09:45] Amen will create or we will make a way
[1:09:47] amen for your return it's like The
[1:09:49] Prodigal Son amenity took all these
[1:09:52] worth and he took all the money from his
[1:09:53] dad and said Lord he said my dad give me
[1:09:56] my inheritance amen and he went away and
[1:09:58] he started spending their money in the
[1:10:00] filthy way amen and he spent all the
[1:10:02] money but the grace of God was there
[1:10:04] amen that Grace was there when he came
[1:10:07] back to his father's house and man the
[1:10:08] father didn't blame him but the father
[1:10:10] amen welcomed him with the with his arm
[1:10:12] open amen is that Jesus amen it's like
[1:10:15] God to us sometimes we we amen we do
[1:10:18] things that are not correct sometimes we
[1:10:19] want much things that are not correct
[1:10:21] sometimes we think of things that are
[1:10:23] not correct but when we go back to him
[1:10:25] and we repent our sins
[1:10:28] amen Sorry God doesn't reject us amen
[1:10:31] but he welcomes us amen with his brain
[1:10:33] with his arm wide open say that you are
[1:10:35] my son he welcomes us amen because he
[1:10:38] shared his blood for us amen he shared
[1:10:40] his blood for us amen he gave his only
[1:10:42] begotten son even so that we who believe
[1:10:45] in him amen we might be saved amen is
[1:10:48] the grace of God and you try to think
[1:10:50] about Peter amen Peter walked with Jesus
[1:10:53] amen Peter was with Jesus all of that
[1:10:56] Peter was there and and when he didn't
[1:10:58] have money or fish didn't find fishes
[1:11:01] amen Jesus told him exactly where to go
[1:11:03] fish mnp that was the one that God said
[1:11:06] God told him that uh Peter one win when
[1:11:09] Jesus told them taught all the rest of
[1:11:11] the disciples to go and Peter said that
[1:11:14] where will we go amen Peter was the one
[1:11:16] who Jesus told him to take care of the
[1:11:19] ship amen Peter was the one to whom the
[1:11:22] revelation of Jesus Christ was given to
[1:11:24] amen and Jesus said upon this Revelation
[1:11:26] I'll build my church but look at that
[1:11:29] Peter when the persecution came and
[1:11:31] Peter denied Jesus amen that we want to
[1:11:34] be one persecution came amen amen Peter
[1:11:36] amen denied Jesus Peter wanted that
[1:11:39] didn't want to take part of that of that
[1:11:41] sufferance amen Peter did not believe
[1:11:43] the Bible even says it I think in
[1:11:45] Matthew 26 uh verse 73 that the Bible
[1:11:48] said that Peter began to curse and swear
[1:11:51] amen Peter began to do the amen but but
[1:11:54] the grace of God was inside of him the
[1:11:56] grace of God told him that what you did
[1:11:58] was wrong amen and he started to repent
[1:12:00] and sin amen but when you see that when
[1:12:03] the the the the the angel came with the
[1:12:05] word amen and the Bible says that here
[1:12:07] in Mark 16 Verse 6 and 7 he said that
[1:12:10] and he said
[1:12:11] unto them beating up for being not
[1:12:13] afraid you seek Jesus of Nazareth which
[1:12:17] was crucified he is risen he's not here
[1:12:20] behold the place where they let him but
[1:12:23] go your way tell his disciple and Peter
[1:12:26] amen the angel had to specifically name
[1:12:28] Peter amen because Peter was also the
[1:12:31] disciple the angel could just stop there
[1:12:33] but but God wanted to show Peter's Grace
[1:12:36] and he said go tell my disciple and
[1:12:38] Peter
[1:12:40] that he goeth before you in the Galilee
[1:12:42] there shall you see him and he said unto
[1:12:46] you amen no matter what Peter did it
[1:12:49] meant the grace of God was there for him
[1:12:51] amen the grace of God was there for him
[1:12:53] to forgive all his sins even the grace
[1:12:55] of God was there for him and when it was
[1:12:57] the curse of God Amen that made him
[1:12:59] realize that what he did was wrong so
[1:13:02] now you say well brother Isaac but but
[1:13:04] since we have the grace of God that
[1:13:05] means that we don't need to repent
[1:13:07] anymore that we can't sin and we can do
[1:13:09] things and and as we see it please amen
[1:13:13] the grace of God that is inside of you
[1:13:15] will keep you from doing those things
[1:13:16] amen the grace of God that is inside of
[1:13:18] you will tell you exactly when you did
[1:13:20] when you do something wrong amen will
[1:13:22] never make you feel comfortable and it
[1:13:24] will push you to go repent amen is that
[1:13:27] grace of God Amen is that grace of God
[1:13:29] inside of us amen that that makes us
[1:13:31] repent amen is that grace of God inside
[1:13:33] of us that said Lord forgive us
[1:13:36] I mean it was the grace of God in
[1:13:38] Minnesota Peter
[1:13:40] amen sometimes after sinning the devil
[1:13:42] will come to you and say that you're not
[1:13:45] worthy
[1:13:47] to talk to talk to God and and and and
[1:13:50] he and and you're not worthy to talk to
[1:13:53] him God will not listen to you
[1:13:56] amen and hear the devil we will make you
[1:13:58] sin we devil will make you do something
[1:14:00] and then after that when you want to
[1:14:02] pray and you come to your mind and say
[1:14:03] well
[1:14:04] don't pray just wait a little while
[1:14:06] until that sin go until what a little
[1:14:09] while until you forget about that don't
[1:14:11] pray right now because God will not
[1:14:12] listen to you God will not forgive your
[1:14:14] sin right now because your sin is just
[1:14:16] fresh
[1:14:19] there is no time it meant limits amen
[1:14:22] there is no specific time when we have
[1:14:24] to go and repent our sins amen whenever
[1:14:26] you feel that desire you're meant to go
[1:14:28] repent him and just go in here just go
[1:14:31] ahead and repent amen just go ahead and
[1:14:33] say Lord forgive me Lord I need your
[1:14:35] help Lord I need you Lord in My Heart
[1:14:37] Lord Lord I've done that Lord I know
[1:14:39] what I did was wrong but Lord I just
[1:14:41] need your grace Lord I need you to
[1:14:43] deliver me Lord I need your deliverance
[1:14:45] Lord
[1:14:46] Lord I need you to save me Lord I need
[1:14:48] you to watch me to claim me to make me
[1:14:51] news that I want to become a new person
[1:14:53] Lord I know that I love that thing that
[1:14:56] I did Lord I know that by myself this
[1:14:58] body loves it too much but Lord the
[1:15:00] Bible says that I'm not supposed to do
[1:15:03] it Lord but I just need the strength
[1:15:04] Lord I just need you father God help me
[1:15:07] and God will help you because God the
[1:15:10] God because God here is that sincere
[1:15:12] heart amen God hears that sincere it's
[1:15:15] that sincerity that moves God Amen is
[1:15:18] that prayer that's in spirit in your
[1:15:19] prayer it might that be that moves God
[1:15:22] and that that pushes God to come and
[1:15:24] answer you
[1:15:26] amen is that grace of God
[1:15:28] amen he says that my grace is sufficient
[1:15:31] for you
[1:15:32] amen my gracious of him before you were
[1:15:34] even born amen before the foundation of
[1:15:36] the word amen God saw you amen his grace
[1:15:39] was there amen he knew exactly amen what
[1:15:42] to do with you he knew exactly man it
[1:15:45] meant the work that he would do with you
[1:15:46] amen he knew exactly amen where you will
[1:15:49] be and he knew exactly amen his grace
[1:15:52] was there with you from the beginning
[1:15:53] amen from the day that you came out of
[1:15:56] the your mother's womb and his grace was
[1:15:58] there amen and it's the same Grace that
[1:16:00] is keeping you alive right now the man
[1:16:02] it's that same grace even sometimes when
[1:16:04] you don't when you think the amen things
[1:16:06] are not working the world the way they
[1:16:08] were supposed to be amen sometimes amen
[1:16:10] amen things are not working amen it
[1:16:12] seems like all your planes are not
[1:16:14] working well amen is still the same
[1:16:17] grace of God trying to teach you a
[1:16:19] lesson it's still that same grace of God
[1:16:21] Amen try to make a great try to form
[1:16:23] your character amen because remember the
[1:16:25] prophet says that the character is not a
[1:16:27] gift it's not a gift but it's a victory
[1:16:29] amen it's something that you have to
[1:16:31] fight for it
[1:16:32] I mean it's something that has to be
[1:16:34] formed on me and you I mean it's
[1:16:36] something that comes with experiences so
[1:16:38] when those things comes amen sickness
[1:16:40] come amen you pray God and God heals you
[1:16:43] amen it's that character man it's that
[1:16:46] faith that has been strengthened inside
[1:16:48] of you man so that when something else
[1:16:50] will come amen you will remember amen
[1:16:52] those testimonies that you had amen and
[1:16:54] it will give you Faith Amen to to just
[1:16:57] to see more result amen it's that grace
[1:16:59] of God Amen he says that his grace is
[1:17:02] sufficient for me
[1:17:04] amen you see that the grace of God was
[1:17:06] in the Garden of Eden amen God says that
[1:17:09] the day that you will eat from this tree
[1:17:11] and that day that same day you will die
[1:17:13] amen it was the word of God that word
[1:17:15] was clear you eat and you die amen but
[1:17:18] when the Bible when uh Eve ate it and he
[1:17:20] gave it to Adam remember God when God
[1:17:23] came amen certainly the Adam and Eve
[1:17:26] they were expecting for they were
[1:17:28] expecting to die over death or something
[1:17:30] like that but when God came
[1:17:32] amen God gave them the grace amen God
[1:17:35] killed the lamb but man he killed the
[1:17:37] lamb and he shed his blood and when he
[1:17:39] gave them that Grace that unmerited
[1:17:42] Grace amen when they were not worthy of
[1:17:44] living amen God came and he presented to
[1:17:47] them another way out and many presented
[1:17:49] to them a Grace amen is that same Grace
[1:17:52] that that sent Jesus on the cross amen
[1:17:55] when we we did all those things and and
[1:17:58] amen amen that's the Bible says that we
[1:18:00] us Gentiles amen we were not even worthy
[1:18:02] to go in the temple amen by Jesus God
[1:18:05] sent Jesus to Down the Cross Amen to to
[1:18:08] divide the veil Amen to give us that
[1:18:10] opportunity to go in the holiest of
[1:18:12] holies Amen to go there and to repent
[1:18:15] our sins Amen to to go there to meet God
[1:18:18] personally Amen to talk to him Amen to
[1:18:20] have a one-on-one conversation with him
[1:18:22] amen whenever we need him amen we can go
[1:18:25] to that channel and talk to him he will
[1:18:27] talk back to God to us and when he was
[1:18:29] that grace of God
[1:18:32] him enough to sin Darkness came
[1:18:35] amen and all the leaves and will work
[1:18:38] quiet
[1:18:40] amen and then Adam started hearing a
[1:18:43] thunder rolling and calling out his name
[1:18:44] Adam where are you amen he tried to hear
[1:18:47] to try to tickle fig leaf and men to
[1:18:50] cover himself remember he didn't know
[1:18:52] that that fig Leaf had the pre-order
[1:18:54] period amen he didn't know that that
[1:18:56] fake lift will wither one day it meant
[1:18:59] by God when he came in man he gave them
[1:19:01] a way out and then he gave them that
[1:19:02] that true amen close the true clothes
[1:19:05] and Men of his grace it meant that he
[1:19:08] didn't have to change the Fig leaves and
[1:19:10] day after day after day remember he shed
[1:19:12] that blood amen because the prophet said
[1:19:14] that when God sees you God sees you
[1:19:16] through his blood amen when your sins
[1:19:18] are ready man and God sees you through
[1:19:20] his red blood amen you are seen as white
[1:19:23] as no amen God will make away somehow
[1:19:26] amen God will create a way God Will Make
[1:19:29] Her Way amen you just come amen imagine
[1:19:31] Adam and may none of them even repented
[1:19:34] none of them even said the lord it's my
[1:19:36] fault none of them amen say that look
[1:19:38] but but God asked Adam what did you do
[1:19:40] that Adam said by Lord It's the wife
[1:19:42] that you give me Lord I didn't choose
[1:19:44] this wife but Lord you gave me this
[1:19:46] Weapon It's your problem if you didn't
[1:19:48] give me this wife and I wouldn't have
[1:19:50] sinned amen fbias uh if but if why did
[1:19:53] you do it Lord It's that serpent Lord if
[1:19:56] you didn't cast Lucifer out there man
[1:19:58] and serpent it wasn't here it didn't
[1:20:01] come here on Earth Lord I wouldn't have
[1:20:03] sinned it's him amen none of them amen
[1:20:06] repented of their sins but the grace of
[1:20:08] God was still there amen the grace of
[1:20:10] God still created the way up for them
[1:20:13] and when it's dark crazy man sometimes
[1:20:15] you you try to think about that Grace
[1:20:17] and you try to understand it you try to
[1:20:19] study it but it's just some it's it's
[1:20:22] it's impossible to study it's impossible
[1:20:24] to they meant to to bring that Grace in
[1:20:27] a simple words amen because you will see
[1:20:29] it meant many different examples in the
[1:20:31] Bible but you see but Lord this one you
[1:20:33] say that we're supposed to repent but
[1:20:35] this one didn't repent amen you see the
[1:20:37] thief on the cross amen this one didn't
[1:20:39] even say a prayer but he was saved it

[1:20:48] days and lay on the floor and and and
[1:20:51] and and and and and and and all of that
[1:20:52] but but Lord you still had to save them
[1:20:55] amen there is not a simple word they
[1:20:57] meant to describe that grace of God Amen
[1:20:59] it's just so big and it's just so amen
[1:21:02] it's just the grace of God Amen Lord why
[1:21:04] did you save me amen I don't know why
[1:21:06] but it's only because of his love
[1:21:09] amen the grace of God
[1:21:11] amen the Bible prophecies that God had
[1:21:14] to transfer our sins upon him he says
[1:21:17] that now it isn't what I can do
[1:21:20] it isn't whether I'm good or not
[1:21:23] it's whether he was good
[1:21:26] I can never be good enough to make it
[1:21:29] you can't you can't be good enough to
[1:21:31] make it
[1:21:32] if you ever make it you stand in the
[1:21:35] merits of Jesus Christ
[1:21:37] I tell you that now because there is
[1:21:40] nothing else you can do
[1:21:42] but God transferred all our sins upon
[1:21:45] him and he died and because he died a
[1:21:49] sinner the Bible said his soul went to
[1:21:52] hell that's right and while he was there
[1:21:55] he preached to those that were in prison
[1:21:57] that reprie that re uh that repented not
[1:22:00] in the long-suffering of the days of
[1:22:02] Noah but it wasn't possible that he
[1:22:06] would leave his body see corruption
[1:22:08] neither he's so in hell and on the third
[1:22:11] day he rose up for a justification
[1:22:15] showing to us
[1:22:17] that as our faith is confessed in him
[1:22:20] and we've been born Anew of the spirit
[1:22:24] they are as sure as he come from the
[1:22:28] grave we will rise also in the second
[1:22:30] coming oh what a perfect hope
[1:22:34] even that's the play that's that's where
[1:22:36] we have to put our faith in
[1:22:38] amen as he has he left that tomb empty
[1:22:41] amen amen that's that's the promise that
[1:22:44] sure will rise up again and that that
[1:22:46] second commandment will rise up again

[1:23:24] of you and me and when he had to go
[1:23:26] through all those pains amen because of
[1:23:28] you and me amen amen he had to go
[1:23:31] through all of that because of you and
[1:23:32] me man because of that love that he had
[1:23:34] and when the prophet says that because
[1:23:36] of that law of God couldn't send an
[1:23:38] angel to come and save us in many words
[1:23:40] because of that law of God couldn't send
[1:23:42] uh Micah if God couldn't send all those
[1:23:45] great angels to come and save us amen
[1:23:47] but he had to come himself Amen to make

[1:38:02] amen of your word amen because when you
[1:38:05] have the revelation of your word amen
[1:38:07] you can't move
[1:38:08] the story of Adam and Eve and you'll
[1:38:12] notice that when Ed when God told them
[1:38:14] not to eat from that tree even God told
[1:38:16] Adam alone amen God Adam Eve was not
[1:38:20] created then amen but Adam had to teach
[1:38:23] e of them this is what God's saying amen
[1:38:26] but Eve amen just took it as a as a
[1:38:28] knowledge as a common knowledge that God
[1:38:30] told us that we're not supposed to do
[1:38:32] this but it wasn't really a revelation
[1:38:33] amen that's what one the devil came to
[1:38:36] tempt her amen she failed and that's why
[1:38:38] when the devil came to tempt her amen
[1:38:40] she was easily moved amen because that
[1:38:42] word amen was not revealed to her it was
[1:38:44] just a simple knowledge that that she
[1:38:46] quoted to the devil that as you call it
[1:38:48] to the serpent that God told us not to
[1:38:50] eat from that tree amen but when Adam
[1:38:52] came a man he knew that Revelation amen
[1:38:54] amen was not only a a knowledge a common
[1:38:58] knowledge but it was a revelation amen
[1:39:00] that's what he didn't that's what he
[1:39:02] chose amen the prophecy that he chose a
[1:39:04] man to eat that that treatment to save
[1:39:07] Eve amen it's the same thing with Jesus
[1:39:10] amen amen he knew exactly what he was
[1:39:12] doing him and he chose to become a sin
[1:39:15] Amen to save us Amen to save us cement
[1:39:18] that's why you had to die that's what
[1:39:20] the item women had to forsake his
[1:39:22] rightful place he meant to go down and
[1:39:25] then sin with his wife in order to vote
[1:39:27] through him and his wife can have the
[1:39:29] Redemption amen and that is the same
[1:39:31] thing that God has to forsake his
[1:39:33] rightful place it went up in heaven amen
[1:39:35] so that through him the blood of Christ
[1:39:37] you have amen the Redemption amen
[1:39:39] through him amen so that would make be
[1:39:42] redeemed amen he was that Grace that
