TRANSCRIPT
========================================
oh come on somebody that's what he's trying to tell us he's now gone away Hallelujah but that's the time you must wake him you want to see a Revival you must call Jesus on the scene to see a Revival in your life the preacher can't do it for you you are an individual you must do it yourself Hallelujah you love the Lord and because of the veil Israel is still blind the lutherans had Luther the Methodist had Wesley the Pentecostals they had Bishops and elders and whatever more and they're blind why because all of them followed the traditions of the elders is that right I mean that's what that's what the Jews did in Jesus day well why don't your disciples wash their hands I mean you know they had laws that the elders did and they wanted Jesus to follow that stuff Jesus was the word we're not tradition we're not time Hallelujah we are eternal there is no time with us and you must understand that the message come Amen to make us see we are Eternal beings and one day we'll step into that eternity see but as long as you uh Captain by time time will make you old time will make you unhealthy time will rotten you destroy you but if you are eternal somebody help me here eternity is the only thing that can stop time is that right because when the mighty angel came down and the seals were open the word was to come time shall be normal somehow the revelation of that must strike the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah there's a veil that we need to break through amen that eternal you know we you know uh Paul said we're settlingly in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus there is a place that God wants us to move into but you'll never get there being carnal and you'll never get there depending on someone else to take you there huh there are people there are people in this message who are waiting on brother Branham to take them there that was my message I didn't finish last week or whatever two weeks ago president said I've taken you as far as I can take you but you see those bloody Footprints he said follow those bloody footprints see and the Bloody Prince come from Jesus Christ himself people afraid because tradition is being broken Veil is man being smashed Hallelujah don't be afraid this is what happens Amen to a real in a real birth a chicken KC Beyond the Veil but when he breaks through it Hallelujah he breaks through through light and life in a in another dimension he didn't even know existed and that's what we are we're in the womb of the Earth but we must break through these elements break through this carnality break through everything that's that time holds us prison to we've got to come through to this great great atmosphere this Kingdom that Jesus spoke of it's beyond this little message thing what we've been doing going around in circles just like Israel it's beyond that I'm not trying to criticize anybody I'm just trying to tell you I'm anointed by God Amen to break through the Veil Hallelujah to break through tradition to break through everything that has been holding this bride back is later than what we think Hallelujah I believe the men of God that have come before me has done an excellent job to do whatever they was ordained to do I'm not criticizing anybody but I must do I be I must do what I'm ordained to do amen amen this message is so great the word corrects all error as I said it corrects science it corrects Society is that right when Herod uh uh uh uh I think it was Herod that one took his his wife's brother's wife John the Baptist clearly ah that ain't yours see that's the that's the word that wasn't John that was word in John hallelujah thank God for the grace of God none of us would be worthy right now you see what I'm saying most of us was worse than Herod oh amen but the grace of God has found us amen we were probably more like like the woman at the well or Mary Magdalene or somebody you know but nevertheless they Pride you hear what I'm saying it didn't matter what they did under sin it was when the grace of God found them like I said he will make you free the truth we did what we did because we didn't know who we were but now that we know that we've been born to be Sons and Daughters of God it has awakened us to who we really are it's sometimes hard to believe that I can be a Son of God a true Son of God a son of Hell or him if you want to say it the God who created all things you and I are Sons and Daughters of the Creator it's just can't I get cave fathoming so they're in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made now that in itself tells you who the ruler is if you make something it makes you greater than the thing that you've made right it didn't make itself there's nothing that you see with your natural eyes that made itself it really it really sickens me when I hear people talking about evolution some tadpole or something dropped his legs and became whatever started from Iraq I think it was you mean to tell me my great great great great great great great grandfather is a rock people ought to wake up and
