TRANSCRIPT
========================================
where there's a bloody bleeding word of God that God has given to us and this unveiling of this message is given to the Bride of Jesus Christ Alone she sees it she understands it and she's moving forward somebody says the bride's Revival where the bride is in a Revival uh everybody that claimed to be bride is not but the true bride of Jesus Christ is in a Revival God is pulling on her and moving her into a position that she has no idea of where she's headed because we have not traveled this way before and we are a blessed people because we're going to see why those seals were sealed or locked and and there was they were locked for a purpose it was to keep away the very essence of God's inheritance from Satan because Satan comes to steal kill and destroy but mind you in every age God protected the seed of that age and he saved them all by grace and you and I must understand by the grace of God how powerful this is because when God said that he that begun the good work in you is faithful to complete it it proves to us that we are not the ones who are completing it it is God who is completing his his job his business this is God's business but we must understand that Grace and law cannot abide in the same place and when the seals were open so many things happened during that time that even the men of that age did not see all that God was doing but as we have traveled from 63 all the way up to this day we're beginning to see our inheritance and what was literally laying in the word of God all of these years and we couldn't even see it because God had our our eyes holding unto this day until this hour and this was given to a special class of people that God foreordained before the foundation of the world the world may have looked upon us as being scum and rejects but in the eyes of God he chose us to be the Bride of Jesus Christ this thing that I'm talking about the seals were blocking it was the blocking of God for each age it was the thing that was hidden because you know Satan in his own mind was thinking he was getting the victory over God's inheritance and all alone God was defeating Satan on his grounds now when they were open we we they were open that we might see The Inheritance it has always been about inheritance when you go down into the Genesis you'll find out that the whole battle between Cain and Abel was about inheritance of the battle between Jacob and Esau it was about inheritance the battle amen between Judas and Jesus was about about inheritance if you look at it you'll find out that it's the devil who came to take the inheritance of of God's people The Inheritance away from them but he failed to see that that God saw the program way before it happened and the Bible said that God put our names in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world you see what belongs to us could never become come to Devils of the devil right it's God who gave us these things it's our day and this is our time and I think that we need to do with all all that we have within us to redeem that time this is Lord here we are everything is moving and everything is moving by the power of God you know the Bible talks about the fullness and I haven't finished that message but I just started on at the until the cup of the the the fullness of the amorites and I I did do a little studying on the amorites and I found out they amorites uh was a mingling people they filtrated almost every culture and they were people who were a people of control they were people who would move into a situation and basically uh gain control and manipulate systems to their advantage and the Bible talks about it how you know the the fullness of the amorites we we fully didn't understand but what now we're seeing in the government and all over the world is that the amorites has taken their position and they have influenced everybody and this is why the enemy uh God told us uh Israel kill them all killed them all if you let them live they will become thorns in your flesh and so now we see by the grace of God that what this is all about that the amoritis is now in position where they're changing the laws manipulating even in the church World in so much so amen that this place and this place that we're living in is almost to a place where God's full full of judgment amen is about to fall is that right uh because you got to realize amen that these spirits that we're working with has already been ordained to do what they're doing Hallelujah but in the midst of all of this Darkness there still is God's Amazing Grace Hallelujah because there is no way to escape them amen they have branches they have names and we don't know who these people are but we can see them now amen some of them because they were on stage but where is the Bride of Jesus Christ let's move on we realize by God's grace so all of these things have been locked up into the word word and and and we understand that the The Inheritance it just seems like uh uh uh this is why the Bible says if the princes of this world knew who Jesus was they would not have crucified him amen because he was the very essence of the inheritance of God everything that was in him he was the title deed himself he was God himself he was a ruler of mankind heaven and in Earth and so we realized amen that when he died amen he he he broke himself up into 120 pieces right little pillars of fire and he did something he had never done in all of history he filled mankind he changed their nature he created a new generation of people hallelujah and you know people thought it was about all shouting and dancing and all no no they shouted they danced because they were changed Hallelujah from All Creatures to new creatures Hallelujah and they began to identify and understand who they were because we were for a long time they saw the Messiah they saw the Messiah the Messiah was with them but something changed when the Messiah came in them Hallelujah and then they recognized their relationship with the Messiah amen they understood when he called them Brethren amen they understood amen His Amazing Grace and they understood that nothing could separate them from this love of God grace shall always abound you and I realize amen even in the first seal when when that white horse rider began to ride it looked like innocence it was so religious and but it was deadly because what the the white heart it was it was just the the anointing of what rode on that horse right it was a he had he had no bow he had a bow but he had no arrows and you see that's the way the devil does every seed must bring forth its kind you see what I'm saying and it was Seas of the devil that had already been planted within the church and that the same anointing that anointed amen God's seed anointed the other sea to bring forth of his kind religious is that right another Cain and Abel was born and it was religious and it looked so innocent but in his character it was a murderer y'all hear what I'm saying and what that little white horse and this is why I try to tell people even now that white horse is still riding among message churches and because what the White Horse did it removed the hardship of the Holy Ghost and made men the headship of other men and it was never to be that way God always wanted to be the head of his church Hallelujah is that right because the deed became a Doctrine and the doctrine became a man and then the Man became a murderer Hallelujah now mind you when you talk up when you think about the simple symbolism of all of that it was people that this anointed this anointing anointed that's right it was seeds that was already planted among the two Christians is that right and what did it produce murderers Brothers hating each other is that the Bible and the Bible said if you can't love your brother you are a murderer where is he taking that from all the way from Genesis Cain and Abel Hallelujah and you'll find that this thing has become such a religious thing and it's become so common and people are accepting it they're being can I say it like this what we call Christianity has become the deception to Christians I'll say it again what we call Christianity has become the deception to Christians Hallelujah because you can only be a Christian if you're born of the word amen amen amen hallelujah it's nothing but the truth a friend of mine was talking to me you know he had seen a movie and this movie was really bad in the sense that it the way it betrayed Christianity and I told him I said listen that's not Christianity that's a business called Christianity it's not Christianity Christianity produces Christ I said and what you see there cannot be placed within the word because Amy is that right the Old Testament New Testament saying says Silver and Gold Have a number such as I have give ID and now you see these people with rose roses and all of this fabulous clothing and you name it they've got it come on I said that ain't Christ I say just like our country poses as a country when it's no longer a country it's a business that's all America has become a business now they're saying it because that's what it really is it looks so innocent but look where it's going now even among our own ranks men are ruling other men ruling the church telling them who to marry tell them who you can't marrying all of those kinds of stuff it's the truth it's got so sad amen that you know people even in this message who are now in churches in America amen instead of paying their ties to the people the pastor in the church here they send it back home that's a system that's has nothing to do with the word it's wrong but men allow other men to rule them instead of letting the word rule them now that wasn't even in my notes but the point is amen we must understand what this grace is Grace is God's gift to give us eyes to see the difference between the system and His Holy Spirit y'all understand what I'm saying and they that are led by this you know the spirit of God uh they are the sons of God not they that are led by men you understand me oh come on somebody it's nothing but the truth it's so bad if this path will say oh you can't fellowship with those over there they won't do it and Jews said any brother who causes division is seemingly that that they have the Holy Ghost they don't even have the Holy Ghost Fellowship comes by the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah wherever he leads me I will follow because being right with God it does not always appear to be righteous and let me explain that to you the Pharisees were righteous is that right but Jesus was right huh God told him to go and watch let that woman wash his feet to the Pharisees that was not righteous but who was more right and it was Jesus who was being led by the Holy Spirit to allow that woman to wash her feet his feet is that right let's go to another place what about Jesus at the well talking to her to a Samaritan woman in the eyes of the viewer he would have looked unrighteous but he was right see what makes us different is that we're not concerned about righteousness we're concerned about being right wherever he lead me I will follow I do his will oh God I come to do his will it's not about whether you like me doing what I'm doing if I'm doing what God wants me to do I could care less about what anybody else is thinking about it amen This is Amazing Grace when God gives you Grace to hear his voice and to know that he's directing you and leading you to do what what you're doing is that right oh it's true is that right I think it was Paul they said oh Paul you can't go there but Paul said uh God told me to go there you see what I'm saying in the in their eyes even a believer was looking at it in a different way can I say it like this it's like it's like um when the disciples I think it was uh Matthias they chose Matthias it looked like the righteous thing to do they needed 12 and they only had 11 now so they voted cashed Lots and even though it looked righteous it was not right because it wasn't Matthias that was to be the next Apostle Paul comes along says I'm the one God chose me and so regardless and you know what you never hear anything else about Matthias Hallelujah but when God chooses you he puts you in a place where your gift make room for you and nobody can deny it amen hallelujah think about it those 10 spies they went to oh to spy out the land and they come back and say we can't do it let me tell you something this message will exceed extremely hard to you when you like the understanding of Grace and Grace is the unmerited love for you he chose you he ordained you Hallelujah this way is a harder way because you know what your biggest enemy is you you understand me you gotta fight this thing wants to appear righteous before God this thing and the Bible says amen that this thing is like filthy rash don't even put trust in your flesh you understand me this thing will fail you when you need it the most but God will never fail Hallelujah and Grace covers every mistake you make Hallelujah is that right do you really think that you were so holy and so righteous what because that's the reason why God gave you the Holy Ghost absolutely not it was God chose you it was God's favor toward you and none of us can boast on it nobody God accepted you why because he knew you before the foundation of the world Hallelujah this thing has nothing to do with time Hallelujah don't the devil fight your mind sometime oh God will I make the Rapture oh look at me I'm such in bad shape how can I make the Rapture hey you'll be in bad shape when the Rapture take place the only thing God is going to see is the blood he'll see his life in you and that's what takes you it's not this old sinful flesh amen Hallelujah that's nothing but the truth Joshua and Caleb said steal the people we're more than able to take it because God promised it to us and I don't care what the opposition is somebody help me here you see because what it was it was the people who described the Giants it was the people who described themselves is that right the Giants were just Giants but to the people that says we're like grasshoppers and and you and I must understand by God's grace amen what are you what are you what do you see yourself as being I tell you what Joshua and Caleb saw themselves just as big as God was Hallelujah you understand me and that's what we must begin to see we're just as big as God because God is in US man don't see yourself something less oh you I can't do it I can't make it but that was already established before you got saved that's why it took Grace the savior because there was nothing you could produce on your own that could Merit the grace of God in this last day we need to just just step up to the bat and stop thinking so carnal in our minds we need to be transformed by what the renewing this is what the message is all about this is not a Pentecostal message to make us feel like we can jump and shout all of that's good but it's beyond all of that it's now being filled with the character of Christ and and trusting his way of leadership above all Satan Weaponry one of his biggest weaponries is fear fear I'm not going to make it in fear I can't do it and fear fear fear you know we ought to question fear doubt feel like we doubt faith foreign doubts you know Satan where is fear right he always make you think and and that's that's the thing you know he he twists things so badly you know when you get sick the first thing he almost want to put on you is because of something you've done wrong he never tells you well you know you're sick because God wants some communion with you oh God wants fellowship with it he never tells you that you know you've gone through something because God want to get closer to your a God is building you into Perfection he never tells you that he'll tell you curse and remember when you did this remember when you did that and you said but you know what I may write see Hallelujah the Holy Ghost give what power and that power is Authority that power gives you end of a sound mind right we're not double-minded that's what the Bible said the devil-minded man is unstable in all his ways that means you got two Spirits working in your spirit your spirit in the devil's spirit Spirit of unbelief in the spirit of Faith they can't work together hallelujah it's like a tug of war Hallelujah but you've got to overcome that unbelief that double-mindedness and and put your put it under your feet you want God to bless you be tried and tested and still praise him yeah we we be tired trying to wonder what God is doing Just Praise Him and all things give thanks praise him why because he's worthy to be praised that's when you realize I love God and he loves me you you don't doubt his leadership no matter what you go through he is right he is just he is Holy and he knows the path in which he takes you it's the thief Satan himself that cometh not but to steal and to kill and destroy and everything that God has given you how much you've allowed him to destroy with your unbelief Hallelujah that's why I love those messages on New Year take that with the devil and stole from you hallelujah it's your time to possess the land and God gave us this land if he wanted to leave us out there with all of the rock and roll and all of the uh seducing spirits and everything else he would have left us out there but he called us into a holy place a place where we could stay in that that fellowship with him amen and grow into him what do you want to become oh oh I want to become a doctor I want to become a lawyer I want to become this and that and the other what what what your first ambition should be I want to become like him I want to be in His image I seek ye first I seek first the righteousness of God and if anything else be added so let it be but my whole heart is to be like him that's what I've been called for that's what you've been called to do it's not about being part of this when you know everything is going to perish Hallelujah and if God should Grant you riches thank God for the riches but your goal is to be like him don't be deceived what good it was to do there's people out there with all kinds of money and clothing and everything else and their perverts they they got so much they don't even know what to do with it the thief cometh but to to steal and to kill and destroy I come that they might have life and that they might have it more what abundantly oh Jesus now let me I wonder how you Define life you know the world Defined Life with partying in and this is life that's not life that's death then we need to find out what life is life is God as the president life is the Lord Jesus and if I could get abundance of him and me that's what I want I want an abundance of his life in me Hallelujah so much so that I can defeat Temptations Jesus defeated Temptations is that right and if that be the case the same holy spirit that was in him is in us and we can defeat Temptations Hallelujah talking about the seed of discrepancy we've got so much of it the prophet God says now we lived through Luther's age and we've lived through Wesleyan age and methods of this age all down Through the Ages and the Pentecostal age and each age is given a promise of the word did they fulfill their promise you better believe they did had not they done it we wouldn't be here today and the people of that age that listen the people of that age that manifested that promised word is the seed of that age y'all hear what I'm saying we're in the broad age if you don't manifest the word for this day you're not right you're not true seed because that seed of whatever age you're in or day to be will manifest yourself Hallelujah that's right it's the seed of that age according to what Jesus said right here they are the children of the Kingdom that's right that manifestation of the Holy Spirit operating through his children is those seeds of the kingdom of that age see so you can follow the message is that right and you can know the messenger but it doesn't mean your seed y'all hear what it was Joshua and Caleb they manifested the seed of their age and everything else that did not know what was it because the Bible said they had a new spirit they saw behind the veil of Moses and they knew that was God that was there they came in Union with it so they understood that the god of Moses wasn't dead it was he was still alive living in them and I love that testimony when they had conquered the land that says oh like Caleb said I'm I was young and now I'm old my inheritance I won my Mountain that's what I'm saying now I'm not I'm not I'm not satisfied with just church entity or even allowing I'm just not going to allow myself to be deceived by Christianity a system Hallelujah when God has broken the Veil and I can see Jesus Hallelujah Ephesians 2 4-10 says but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sin have quickened us together with Christ by Grace ye are saved and have raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the age to come he might show what in the age to come what age you talking about Paul is talking about this age right in the ages to come it moved it moved and moved and now we've come to the finale what good uh would we be if if if Jesus would not return hey what good would it be and the thing about it is every time he returns most people don't see it it's always been mysterious it always will be mysterious Hallelujah is that right it's nothing but the truth and God always gives us Mysteries to ourselves personally that others don't do not receive have you ever seen God say Abraham there is a city whose building maker is God where did he say it in the scripture huh by his revelation gave him understanding that there was a city how what Revelation he met the king of the city so he understood that there was a king there had to be a kingdom there had to be a city and the Bible said his whole life he's looking for a city whose Builder and maker was God you'll never find it where he spoke to Abraham that there is a city or whatever no it's not there but the revelation that we're not feasting on was given to Abraham nobody else could see it Hallelujah you know Abraham couldn't choose Sodom and Kamar he's looking for a city who's building making with God Hallelujah is that right and you and I meet we don't understand it but there are Revelations there are things there are Inspirations and things that God gives the believer that he doesn't give other people that's why we have a joy that's why we have a peace while everybody else is struggling with things and you say well I don't understand it no foreign this is the day we're living in Hallelujah you love the Lord listen even when we were dead in sin have quickened us together with Christ by Grace you are saved and have raised us up excuse me together and made us sit together in Heavenly places where in Christ Jesus where are you setting in Heavenly places that that's something something that's that's powerful to me where in the Christ Jesus I'm in him you're in him that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace in his kingdom toward us through Christ and we who are Gentiles are to be forever rejoicing a wild Vine grafted into the real one Dogs We Were and yet God God's grace found us Jesus have mercy and you think well look at this time and this let me tell y'all something I want you to look around and you see all the people who are Islams and Muslims and Buddhists and all of this kind of stuff and then you say well I'm a Christian so you feel safe you feel safe because you can say I'm a Christian everything that called himself Christians are not Christians and what we call Christianity is not Christianity the Bible calls all Hall Mr Babylon the Great yes all of these churches and if you're not careful you'll be a part of that same system and the Bible said there's a cage of unclean and hateful Birds sound familiar even Among Us The Same Spirit of Cain and Abel killing your Brothers Without a Cause backbiting backstabbing and speaking evil of preachers and all that kind of stuff and none of that's God can't be is that right and brother Venom said if you can't speak something good about a person don't speak nothing at all that's something we must all learn killing even among ourselves watch the political move we have that even in this little assembly a little patch of pocket of politics and they think I'm blind but I see it moving but they've been ordained to do exactly what they're doing like they said I ain't scared because I realize who I'm following right let these people be the Bible said let them grow together see because I don't you know I I know who I am and everybody got to come to recognize who they are yeah yeah yeah yeah you know what I'm saying let's move on by the grace of God exceedingly riches but I I wonder sometimes I don't even know I think to myself with all the mistakes I've made how in the world could I be and I'm so glad it wasn't my choosing he chose me I made understand once I get there you know why I love God because he's so patient he's been very patient with me he's been so long suffering I cannot tell by grace are you saved through faith did y'all know prayer don't save you fasting can't save you you are saved by faith by Grace amen through faith right and that can that not of yourself oh my God you didn't get this if nobody in school gave it to you and that not of yourself Hallelujah it is the gift of God not a Works lest any man should boast Amen brother you can shout a little bit if you want to Hallelujah for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God have before ordained oh this is what I love that we should walk in them that's why we walk in them it was ordained by God Hallelujah excuse me but we find out this is a quote God gave the word for his defense our defense God gave his children his word for their defense we have no other defense than the word of God that is our defense there's no bombs no shelters no hiding place no arizonas or California or wherever it is only one defense we have and that is the word you think about Daniel had one thing that he was charged he worship His God he served as God too much he paid prayed three times a day Hallelujah Daniel didn't give his chance to himself a chance to make a mistake you understand me amen he constantly stayed in connection with God and listen we always see those stories and we hear him and we think that uh somehow God takes away the man element at some point he does but before Jesus went to Calvary the main element was still there and he says Lord I wouldn't this cup passed from me but nevertheless not my will but die and be done y'all hear what I'm saying and you can't tell me that the man element wasn't there with Daniel at the first but Daniel knew how to pray he knew how to keep the connection and God so loved the way Daniel conduction himself that he stood in the fire with in the in the Lion's Den with him y'all hear what I'm saying now let me say it like this the pillar of Fire stood within the fire and what is our inheritance today the pillar of Fire y'all hear what I'm saying he's here what was brother branham's defense he was preaching the word but when that pill of Fire Hallelujah when that angel came nobody no demon in the place would dare challenge him y'all hear what I'm saying that's all I'm saying that's our inheritance but not the pillar fire here peel a fire that's here Hallelujah and when you come into the presence of the pillar fire it will change you oh and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us which is Christ Jesus he is our only defense being in him we are safe let me tell y'all something I'm gonna say it again Christianity is the greatest deception to most Christians not even sin is imputed to the genuine believer I'ma read that again these are not the words of brother Bradham even those he's preaching it it was already written not even sin is imputed to a genuine believer did you know that he that is born of God does not commit sin he cannot sin sin is unbelief amen amen it is not even imputed why David said blessed is the man who God will not impute sin when you're in Christ you have no desire to sin let me you know what I'm saying so you can better understand me in your heart you have no desire to sin but you can't stop this thing that comes through your your head that's why the Bible said put on the helmet of faith the heaven of Salvation the breath y'all know what I'm saying and you see by the grace of God you understand amen that you it goes it's going to come as long as you in this monster it's going to come but it's your duty to fight it it's your duty to reject it Hallelujah and what I what I do know one good way to get rid of the the devil not only just to rebuke him but but sing a song or two amen worship God because when you start worshiping God the Bible say he inherits the praise of his people will change you did you know that he that is born of God does not commit sin can not sin see it's not even imputed it ain't even written down it's not even put on the books or David said blessed is the man who God will not impute sin when you're in Christ you have no desire to sin the worshiper once heard has no more conscience of sin you don't desire it that's why we keep crying out that's why we keep praying that's why we keep asking for deliverance because within our souls there is no desire to do the wrong things we want to do right because our father does right he is righteous he is Holy and this is why we constantly empty ourselves out confess our sins and and God sees those things now to the world you might be a sinner but to God you're not because you're in Christ how can you be a sinner when you're in the sinless one and God only see him who you are in did I just cut the head of the devil off right excuse me do you love the Lord give me a few more minutes this Amazing Grace it will always be amazing praise the Lord Hebrews 6 17-20 says wherein God willingly willing more abundantly to show unto The Heirs of Promise the immutability of his counsel and confirm it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie we might have a strong consolation Hallelujah who have fled for Refuge to lay hold upon the Hope set before us amen like those Hebrew boys says even if he don't deliver us we're not going to Bow see they had a strong consolation they understood what God meant to them and God could not lie and they were more interested in God's will than their own Hallelujah who have fled for rescues to lay hold upon the Hope set before us which hope we have an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast which entereth into the within that Veil I was greed a moment or two today only because I thought about all of the souls that falls under Christianity every denomination and I know if they're going to be saved they got to be pulled away from the system it doesn't matter what system they're in they can't remain in the system and be saved because that system will is the mark of the beast and if you allow yourself to be entrapped oh I'm a Baptist or a Methodist Presbyterian whatever you call yourself if that's what you think saves you you're a law still yet we're saved by the blood of Jesus Christ the grace of God is that right and you can obtain that no matter where you are you understand what I'm saying but you don't stop there God has a word for this hour that you must come into you can't listen in a man woman Boy Child whoever you are if you'll not take all of the word you're guilty of the same if God said you must be repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and your tradition says no oh I was baptized Father Son and Holy Ghost I was this way listen that ain't gonna work I don't know how you'll come up at the day but Rapture material will be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's Rapture material because they see it in the word and they obey it and that's what I try to tell people you want the real Holy Ghost use the real formula Hallelujah is it different people look at uh let's say like Betty Crocker cake mix and then you can get a generic it ain't the same then you might mix it the same way but it's not the same ingredients it will not come out the same and and and then you know what I'm saying it's the truth so is the word of God do I look down on somebody no that that's not what I'm doing I used to be myself but what I'm gonna tell you something God brought me through from a Baptist from the Baptist to a Catholic from the Catholic to a Methodist from the Methodist to an Apostolic from the apostolic to the word I went through all of that all of that but I always could see something was wrong and don't you think if I could see that something was wrong then I could see that something is wrong now systematic worship God hated it even when Israel got to a place where they did all the rituals right but their heart was far from it he said it becomes a stench in my nostrils and it's the truth we don't have to stand up and say everybody stand up everybody clap your hands everybody do this that should never be when the Holy Spirit is moving God wants spontaneous worship like our brother say he like popcorn worship I loved it I loved it amen good it's nothing but the truth see he's interested in anything we do for his glory right and I don't think people are going to lose their rewards because they don't see everything that we see we got Penny nickels dimes quarters 50 cents and a dollar and God uses all he's God I don't know how he's going to do it I just know my position that's all I know but there's nobody that I know I will receive lost or unsaved but it's these preachers they're the ones that are going to have a foot race in hell he loves us His Amazing Grace his sweet he's sweet oh how sweet the sound that saved a poor Rich like me huh you love the Lord listen when a man stands and say he's a gospel preacher and said that the days of Miracles has passed that's the seed of discrepancy when a man stands and say that he's a minister a pastor of a church of somewhere and he does not believe that Jesus is the same in every detail except the physical body same yesterday today and forever that seed that's a seed of discrepancy when he say that Miracles and the apostolic age are passed that's the seed of discrepancy when they say there's no such a thing as Divine Healing that that's a seed of discrepancy and the world is full of it is crowds out and chokes out the wheat you understand me that's still that white horse rider and you say well Brothers what are you trying to say what I'm trying to say we're not trying to Major on a minor the most important thing is that God will form us here in His image and his likeness that's where we are right now coming into the statue of a perfect man all of these other things would follow it right these signs shall follow them that believe almost done second Peter 10 1 10-11 second Peter 1 10-11 wherefore rather Brethren give Dylan to make your calling an election sure for if you do these things he shall never fall for such an entrance shall be ministered unto you what abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ nothing but the grace of God huh is nothing but the grace of God in Saint John 15 5 says I am the thine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in them the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing and I'm just going to stop there people say well I was so inspired inspiration is good but inspiration is not always right David was inspired to bring the locker the Covenant back to Jerusalem and he knew that's where it's supposed to be but his inspiration gave him a revelation that was not according to the word and he calls a man to die had all of the preaching Hall you know went to the high class all of the big guys of the message you know is this right this right this right but you got to understand we have a message we have a word that we can go to if we have questions we can go through this message and find out the true answer we don't need a bishop to tell us who it is or what it is we've had a prophet for this day he left a message and so when we need to find out what's right and what's wrong we have a message laid out before us with the word of God you understand me but there's so many people that are being inspired and they think because they're inspired let me tell you something inspiration will lead you oh certain Inspirations can be so powerful it will lead you away from the truth those people that would Inspire to leave right it was an inspiration and they didn't even understand that they were fulfilling the word of God the seed that was in them was made manifest by their inspiration and you and I must understand that the inspiration is true it's always true in that sense but watch the word watch what is it what is what you're being inspired to do it has to line up with the word of God you love the Lord let's stand sing that song again Amazing Grace How
