TRANSCRIPT
========================================
he told joshua that all of it i've given to you wherever you place your feet possess it but understand that you're going to fight for it and i've learned by way of rearing children that when you give them an easy life they don't seem to appreciate it but if you teach them how to work and how to labor and how to use their own abilities and talents to gain what they desire to have when they do get to the top they can appreciate it because they know that they have work to get there but anything that's given easily or when you give something to people and you know sometimes you know people just don't appreciate it and and we're living in an age that brother branham call and the scripture calls uh this age age of unthankfulness and we as christians we must be careful that we don't fall into that category of being unthankful god is worthy to be praised and we should thank him for the good and the bad for the sunshine and the rain from the for the valleys and the hills and the mountains in this invitation it wasn't given to everybody it's like having a party or a function you send out invitations but because you send the invitations out doesn't mean the people whom you send those invitations to will attend sometimes people have what they call more important things to do and so has it been in this age but i want you to understand and i'm gonna make it clear tonight what we desire to have has already been given to us but it's not the easy way matter of fact the angel of the lord told brother branham said because you have chosen the harder way the narrow way the straight way a greater portion is laid aside for you and i believe that everyone that follows this message will have a hard time what is required of us to do is naturally impossible no man can add one cubit to his statue but god being gracious in his grace has made this possible for us by giving us an unconditional covenant let us not forget as the psalmist says all of his benefits there are great benefits in serving god and it's a shame that people don't know the blessings of the lord one thing i could say about every victory that i've ever gained is that god was there to make sure i received the victory this is why paul said every victory i gain is is from god and he's made me more than a conqueror and that's so important to believe that you are more than a conqueror doesn't matter how evil this age is god has designed you and jose has ordained you to be a conqueror in the message victory day the prophet god began to talk about all of the victories in the old testament and began to name some of those characters that that had to fight to gain the victory now isn't that amazing how great some of them are and how great some of them were but in all of their victories they still had to die all we have left is records of what they have done but but by god's grace because of their records we can believe and have faith to know that there is a final victory and that this world is not our home see the old testament saints fought because they realized that there there were pilgrims they were they were people who were journeying and there's a better place than this one in this place everything has to die but there's another land where never now no one ever dies in this quote the prophet god says all these great victories were temporal or temporary victories even to moses israel went right back into bondage again always in and out in and out we find it many heroes still fought on and died they still do it in wars in the natural focus of the glass they do it in the spiritual heroes fight and die how we could go on down i've got a whole line of them wrote down here like daniel and the hebrew children and them great victories back there that won their that one victory but they continually find finally come a a thing called death took them see regardless and you know that's what men do even in the natural nobody wants to be forgotten people raise up great statues of men and try to make them immortal but we know that even the statue that's been formed and shaped into their image has a period and a time to end because the bible said that the grass will wither the flowers will fade away but there's only one thing that will last and that is the word of the lord so it doesn't matter how great you become in this world and that's why jesus said what prophet a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul now we have a invitation a city that awaits us and this city is eternal it'll never perish it's been built for souls eternal and there are people amen even on this earth who are eternal who had no beginning nor ending because their lives were in elohim from the beginning now let me go ahead on with the quote please we realize amen that all of these victories are temporal daniel we've heard of that we preached it many times but they continually finally coming a thing called death took them see regardless they went right on see still fighting dying fighting dying victories dying winning victories dying i'm saying all of this to make you understand in order to reach the celestial shore you're going to get victory after victory but there are battles you're going to lose and there are sometimes amen you might get discouraged or frustrated but when you take the word and you understand that you are one of them that can never be defeated and the reason being that you cannot be defeated is because christ won every victory for you even in the time of your failure you steal a victory victorious amen listen it takes pain distress and discomfort to get there hallelujah i don't know about some of you all but i remember when i was a young boy we didn't have cars you know people had cars maybe you know one or two uh you know so many blocks away but every family didn't have a call you didn't have a two two cars and you were blessed to even have a bicycle but we walked sometimes my friend old friends we talk about how many miles we would walk and never think about it we talk our way through the whole journey laugh our way through the whole journey uh but but it didn't mean that times that the journey wasn't tedious it it wasn't tiring it and there are times you perhaps were sick and didn't feel like it we didn't have uh uh uh what they call uh those kind of ambulance now uh back then where you call 9-1-1 and they come most of the time you had to call a cab or something a taxicab in order to get from point a to point b now i'm saying all of these things because i want you to hear what brother branham says because a lot of times we think that we're going to go sweeping through the city this is a warfare this is a warfare and people say well man i don't want to be a christian let me tell you something you're going to suffer whether you are a christian or not and if you're going to suffer you might as well suffer as a christian because if you suffer as a christian there are great rewards hallelujah and the greatest of all rewards is eternal life now you have been invited think about it a piece of dust a piece of dirt david even i've been thinking it was david to call himself himself a worm how low can you get where the wormhole our house is in the dirt not just on top of the dirt in the dirt it's just a low uh uh a creature but god took that and made something out of it and you're it you're what god is forming and making and shaping into his own image but we know because of the world being fallen you've got to have seasons you're going to have your winter you're going to have your summer you're going to have your spring and you're going to have your fall but in all of that you know no matter how dark it gets and this is what i love about it we don't have to ever worry about spring showing up it's coming it's here now the spring is here we don't have to ever worry about summer it's coming and no man can stop it it has been ordained by god now i'm saying all of these things because sometimes when we're going through the winter we don't want the winter to last but so long you know it's true it's true and and and we want to stop it and if i could i would but it's not something you can stop not here in iowa there is a four season that and is separated up like that and it comes just the way it's supposed to you'll never see the winter jumping into summer it's always an inter uh uh uh uh uh how can you say it uh a a a change coming before the summer comes an interval now he goes on and says my thoughts now to you he said it takes pain distress comfort look how the pharisees died to that law through pain distress discomfort why are you saying that because once you understand that this message is grace you're going to go through pain especially if you're a legalist especially if you're working with the law it's going to take pain distress and discomfort why because you realize amen that it's no longer in your hands and that's one of the hardest things for men to do is to surrender to god and let god do it we always want it in our hands hey it never was supposed to be now we find out that rain which bring forth the fruit upon the earth it's born as the porch said in the fields of thunder in a ragged jagged skies but if we didn't have that thunder and the ragged jagged skies the little distilled drops of rain that's been lifted from the seas and distilled from the salt it will not be born and we never think about it that when it rains it is a birth hallelujah it is a birth it is something that god is birthing and that rain once that rain comes hey man you know most of us don't like dogs dogs cows and most of us don't like thunder and don't even talk about lightning but it takes all of that to produce the rain y'all understand me hey you know i never thought about it pulling all of that salt water up there and then now it's got to take all of these things to bring distilled water to you and nobody has ever could ever say well well i tasted the rain it was salty it's never salty because the salt has been taken out a process has been taken for uh taking that salt out it's birth pure clean water well not so much today but back in the day when we didn't have so much pollution right anyway let's move on it would not be it without it it would not be born it takes the lightning thunderblast ragged ragged fearful thing to bring forth the soft petal drops of water it takes pain to bring forth birth it takes dying and as as the clouds die rain is born because rain is a part of that cloud one has to cease to the other one can exist right one has to cease so the other one can exist in other words in order to make this journey law must stop it must come to non-existence yeah you know what i'm saying hallelujah law and grace cannot exist at the same time it can't happen but you know what most of us are afraid to try to trust grace because we're so used to doing hallelujah but it takes pain discomfort hallelujah you know it's so it's amazing because most of the time you know when we come up short when we come up short we feel so condemned hallelujah but you know what god said that the spirit of the word is supposed to take away that guilt consciousness hello the grace of god is supposed to cover it but we're so afraid of grace we think you may not even think of it like that but it's true we have a hard time with it because we've been taught if you do this i give you that if you do this there's a law about that even our children you know get a good grade i'll give you this see so they're used to working in that capacity but doesn't it alarm you when people just give you something and say well you know the lord moved on my heart what is that you know you didn't deserve it you don't deserve it it's god's grace and then you think you know it's hard for people to even receive that they think what's oh what's what's on his mind what's in the back of this and you got to tell people i'm giving this to you because god put it on my heart to do it and there are no strings too attached right is that the truth because real love amen has no strings attached oh it's not because i'm doing for you you got to do for me no sir i'm going to do for you if you don't do for me god so loved the world he set a perfect example about that right he give to the sinner when they don't give back he give to christians and they still don't give back hallelujah but let me move on because i'm talking about getting into this setting in heavenly places in christ jesus remember i told you we've got to think differently how can god take such a thing like you and me and bring you into an equality with him somebody help me here that was a lightning bolt did you feel it see god bringing you into a place of equality not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the lord you got to trust god think about it satan is always trying to reroute us he's always trying to change our our position you know instead of going straight he want us to go these kind of places right is that right abraham yeah abraham never did go straight with the way god told him to do it but because he had an unconditional covenant he still got to the place god ordained him to be y'all understand me and we're like abraham we his seed you know god say go this way we go this way god said go this way we go this way and he always meet us in our arrowing ways there is a city whose builder and maker is god and there is a pull on the believer something that cannot be quenched no no no no stopped hallelujah you we can't explain it all we know is that to the natural man we seem insane oh you're going to be with god i didn't say it i didn't even desire it he called me he saved me he called you he saved you he is the rewarder is that right you and i could not have sought god god sought us we were lost hallelujah is that right and then the bible says blessed is the man who diligently seek me hallelujah greed is your reward right if you seek him he said you will find him what part of that word you don't believe god don't work on your time he works on his own i hope this is a blessing to you for an example as wayward as jacob was jacob had the promise is that right he did he had the promise he was a shyster by nature he he he was a real businessman and he knew how to get away with stuff he knew how to bargain he bargained with his brother esau he bargained with his father-in-law huh and though and it worked and guess what god stepped into the business is that right god stepped in the business showed jacob just how to do it right so it could come out in his favor you because you understand me you understand me his covenant was unconditional because he was abraham's seed his covenant was unconditional and no man can curse that which god is blessed hallelujah jacob was warned of god see if something let me tell you something if you're not being warned in your heart something's wrong right now you should have something in your heart telling you it's time to go back home y'all hear me here was jacob over here prospering and he also saw the attitude of his father-in-law changing but that wasn't what made him go home something was telling him now is the time hallelujah god then blessed you over here all of the natural things that you ever wanted god has given to you right or all that you need god has given to you but now there's a deep call to the deep i got to go back home you know what i'm saying he remember the time he was in bethel and he knew he had to go back home that the house of the lord bread let me tell you something you and i must understand there's a call in you that you cannot explain it you can't understand it but something is telling you it's time for the rapture it's time to get back well it back to the place from which we fell that's our home is not up here we're strangers we're pilgrims but there's something saying the character something's got to move and you know if if no one else knows you know whether the character that you need is in you to face the persecution because esau represented the persecution esau represented the church without the holy ghost you understand me esau represented troubles amen in the last day holly if you don't see esau i see him hallelujah and at the same time that esau was coming your way you were going his way because you got to understand amen they have a sense you know come on let's move on so i'll say it like this jacob was afraid but god had already predestinated him god had already chosen him it was kind of like a a jonah experience jonah thought he was running from god he didn't want to go do what god said do but god had a way of fixing it you understand me you can't get around what god is ordaining you to do there's no way to do it none of his word will come back void and so esau i mean jacob goes home and y'all know the whole story but the thing that gets me at the time of his pull right the bible said if a man hunger and thirst for righteousness he shall be filled hallelujah and that's what east uh jacob was hungering and thirsting for righteousness he wanted to be able to to to that when he got back back and and he meet esau he was able to say i'm sorry you understand me confession i love you brother you understand me he wanted to be able to say that from his heart and he understood amen he did not have the power to do that so one day he thought let me pray now come on it was more than his thought he was inspired to pray and he prayed and god showed up y'all understand me you don't think that jacob prayed when he was with his father-in-law no he did no doubt he did he had prayer time and all this but now this is different it's time for a change that old nature must die if somebody help me it must die and jacob had his good ways too but he still was a shyster but anyway can you imagine how difficult what for for jacob yeah we don't see that do we jacob sent everybody to meet esau but himself all of his children his wives hoping to soften the heart of esau for a moment he forgot god was in control and that's what happens to us we forget god is in control you'll never be in control he's headship you'll never be in control if you're in control you got the spirit of vastly you'll never be in control god is the one that will be in control if you're going to be his wife can i go on sometimes we we we sometimes god will put a choice before you you know and sometimes he want to see what it is you know not that he he's ignorant of it he want to see how you're going to respond right you say oh it's not a test oh yes it is god told abraham i want you to kill your first i want you to kill isaac i want you to sacrifice him something that abraham had never heard of coming from the mouth of jehovah he knew that heathens did it but now god asked me to do it and the bible said he staggered not he didn't complain he didn't question it i know how movies stay well lord no no no no he didn't stagger he did what god requests you see what i'm trying to say when god say do something do it the moment you think about it the reason you're going to reason it away but he put those things in it to see whether so that you can see where the real faith is real faith but abraham had a secret revelation you know what it was he had the revelation that even if he killed his son the same god that gave him to him is able to raise him up it's getting juicy up here but the truth of the matter is that's what it was you understand me if i die in jesus i can come up in jesus now you got to understand paul had a revelation too paul understood that his mission could not be completed until he was done and paul was killed about two three times got straight on up what was it god wasn't finished hallelujah come on you know you think to yourself but i don't die at once i don't want to come and get it but paul was so convinced and convicted with his ministry he knew that he could not go until it was done in fact he said oh it's my desire to go but i have such a love for my brethren it's better for me to stay than to leave somebody help me here what about ruth and naomi i'm coming to the way i'm going just just because i'm just gonna i'm not gonna finish it tonight but ruth and naomi they were there and god and ruth naomi tried her best to discourage ruth and oprah say i i don't have another son for you and what good am i and let me ask you a question if i was able to and get mad again will you wait for the offspring nonsense so i think you need to go back to where you are where you came from is that right see that's how god that's what people don't understand even now that's why so many people go back because god put them in a position where they may have to make a choice and it didn't look good for ruth to go with naomi was going hallelujah why she was a morbiditis i don't suffer and my husband done died over there and more about moab and now you going over here with naomi too oh y'all know how those jews can be and they got a law to kill us you understand the kind of things that the devil was putting in her her head but she wasn't afraid there was an anointing there was a revelation that the god that they only served was the true and living god and she said your god be my god and your people be my people y'all got to understand that was not at just a fly-by-night decision that came from her heart that meant she was willing to suffer whatever she had to suffer in jerusalem bethlehem wherever the jews were you understand me she didn't care if i got to suffer let me suffer but i'm staying with the one that has the word you understand me and naomi represented the old-time way hallelujah she could have gone amen and found her a good husband or new husband but no she wanted to stay within the will of god come on y'all hear what i'm saying this journey is not easy this journey you're going to be tested this journey you're going to be tried hallelujah but thank god for the tests and the trials hallelujah physically you'll be tested financially you'll be tested how do you think mary and martha fell when lazarus died brother adam said it was their approach hallelujah they could have railed jesus and say oh you know we fed you you was in my house and you let my brother die but you see you don't approach god like that hallelujah one thing they acknowledged lord if you had been here my brother would not have died see what i'm saying when you approach god you can't approach god like he's some man you got to approach him like he's god you understand with reverence and respect he don't owe us anything don't even un he doesn't owe us a reason why he allowed things to happen but let me hurry up because i've got another quote to back that up but anyhow we understand that nothing could have taken ruth's place and i want to say this there's two women only two ruth and esther and the whole old testament revolves around that book those two books did you know that even the new testament because it shows our redemption through those two books it shows how god took a gentile bride through those books i mean we can go by by world uh uh perspective but let's just look at what god has done there for us look what he did for us and we was all mixed up among idolaters and you name it that's what we were but nobody could have taken the place of ruth and this is what i want to say to you if there's two characters in this book you should relate to it should be ruth and esther in those two books it opens up where you are who you are and where you're going and even the position that you're going to have at the end why because those books were written with you in mind that's just the anti that's just a type we're the real deal hallelujah and the word cannot fail neither can it falter hallelujah but understand in order to meet boaz you've got to have character and in order for you to become the the king uh uh wife of the of the king ahasuras you've got to have character so god is working on your character so that when you do meet the king he will accept you hallelujah now you say what do you mean brother well let's put it this way we are accepted in the beloved but that doesn't come by mind that come by experience y'all hear what i'm saying it comes by experience we are fighters excuse me my mouth is so dry we are fighters are you a fighter god put you in an age if you don't fight you in trouble you got to fight to stay alive you have to fight to stay in the anointing it's a constant every day hallelujah i love that i love it because you got to empty out every day so god can refill you every day it's true because we're in grace doesn't mean that you don't confess you're wrong no you confess you're wrong that's the word but god has already forgiven you oh come on somebody we have such an unconditional covenant god is stamped you never did it in the first place but you got to believe it first timothy 6 11-12 let me hurry ah i'm so far behind first timothy 6 11-12 but thou o man of god flee these things and follow out the righteousness godliness faith love patience meekness fight the good fight of faith not paul is saying follow after these things but you're going to have a fight fight the good fight of faith lay a hold on eternal life sound like paul is understand what wrestling is all about jacob lay ahead lay the hole of the angel and he wrassled and let me tell you know what wrestling is you get victory you're on top after a while you're on the bottom you're on the side you're on the top you're on the bottom it's back and forth back and forth and finally your opponent gives out and you become victor you see what i'm saying it it and that angel that angel that that that he wrestled with and you got to understand we're talking about self you're the one that needs to die and god is there to change you but not only die we've got a rod and none of us don't know how to die nor rod so it becomes a wrestling it becomes a match am i going to let him live or i'm going to let the one that's in me live hallelujah the one who's calling me he's got to live at the end of this he must come out as a victor let me let me hurry up now fight the good fight of faith lay a hold of eternal life where unto thou art also called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses you know what that means confession and profession when you like brotherhood said you confess a profess a christian you're going to be judged as a christian so let your profession and your confession be true hallelujah oh my commission is a message he brought in 51 he said won't it be wonderful to feel his arms around you and say now don't cry enter into the joys of the lord you fought a good fight so while we're here and got his this opportunity let's make a good fight a real fight hallelujah is that all right i've never been fond of boxing and fighting on the tv or that kind of a thing but you know when you've been in a fight and you walk out walk out as a victor you feel pretty good you might be in the pain but you know you're whooping you know yeah you know it's that kind of thing and paul said hey be a good fighter fight the good fight of faith don't ever let anybody make you believe that jesus christ has changed he's the same yesterday today and forever and he's doing everything he's always done but without faith is impossible to please him hallelujah second timothy 4 6-7 i'm picking it up a little bit starting at the sixth verse he says for i am not ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith that that in itself you know paul wasn't trying to brag but paul had confidence that he's done all that god wants him to do you understand me see that's what i'm saying i don't want to die until i've done all god wants me to do whatever it may be it may be small it may be big but whatever i want to have that confidence that the devil didn't hinder me and and and though he hindered me at times i still accomplished my purpose you and i have a purpose here whatever that purpose is you want to finish it you look at elsa and i'm jumping a little bit but don't you understand that esther israel could not been completed without her that's why the word of god says listen you know they they was before us they cannot be completed without us we are the capping if you want to put it that way we are the queen of heaven we are the ones amen that fully how can i say it because of the embodiment of christ in us the bride of jesus christ when we take our position the rapture takes place see but we've got to we've got to make sure we take our position it's in the bible it's right there in the book of esther i'm coming to that in just a moment just to taste just a little bit by god's grace i have fought a good fight i've finished my course i have kept the faith his fourth day is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and this is the part i like not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing and what people don't understand is that the appearing and the coming is two different things his appearing was when william branham was here his appearing is now in the bride showing he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah and if you love his appearance that means you're eating that word you're studying that word you're living that word so that people can see him not you see him that's what it was about brother says it's not me it's him what you see is him he's the healer i'm not a divine healer there's no such thing if i could be a divine healer that makes me a divine savior it's impossible there's only one savior there's only one divine healer and it's our duty and purpose to make sure the world see that he's alive and well god can't judge a man for nothing he's never seen people need to see jesus did you know that's what happened to israel that's why god she was a vast guy too and when god called for her to to uh to see the unfolding of the word it meant she rejected and crucified him this same generation cut the generation coming out day we did the same thing in the pentecostal world and i'm jumping we've done the same thing i say we they did right listen brother said it seems like the christian life if the fellow is not absolutely centered on christ the christian life seems like hold so many disappointments but those disappointments are god's divine will happening for us now it don't seem like it would be that but it's god's way of doing things he let us hit the river to see what we'll do he let disappointments come he let your children go wayward he let your job treat you any kind of way he let those discipline amen he does it to see what you're going to do god how can you let me let this happen to me oh he's working on your good he's working for your good lord i want to be just like you oh don't ever say that the trial is coming the test is coming you said i want to be just like you that means lord i want to be perfect just like you whatever whatever darkness in you god is going to get it out it doesn't matter who you are from the pulpit to the back of the door it's going to happen for such a time as this you've been called i've been called hallelujah i like the way keith said we've been ordained for this hour i've been ordained for this hour you there is no such thing i can't make it through land to see you you've been ordained hallelujah you ordained to carry this out moses led the children of israel right in the path of duty pharaoh's army behind him and the dust balling from see half a million men in arms and here was two million helpless jews with nothing standing there men women children and so forth and the red sea had him cut off that yeah the red sea had him cut off there's no place to go see but moses had a v-day when he prayed through he went and began to cry out to the lord hallelujah is that all right and the lord said why are you crying to me i commission you to do it speak to the children that they go on in the line of duty amen there you are don't cry to me don't cry out to me you're commissioned to take these people this is what i'm talking about you say you bride and every time you're looking out you're whining like a little baby you and i have been commissioned to do it stop that nonsense and have faith in god hallelujah that's what god told moses and he wasn't trying to be indifference he was just telling him the truth who are you if you're the bride you're supposed to be a conqueror if you're the bride you you're supposed to be a controller controlling your situation i don't care how out of hand it gets speak the word and believe it that's it when that did the the disciples in all was on the sea amen and they they running to jesus and you know what he did he rebuked them ye of little faith i've given you the authority i told you even if you tread your tread upon serpents i told you that if a serpent bite you it can't harm you hallelujah i told you what i'd done and whatever you say i told you if you say to a mountain be thy move it shall be done that's what he said i told you these things why are you crying to me i've commissioned you to do it ordained you to do it hallelujah have faith in god because that's where they were lacking they did not have faith is that right there you are don't cry out to me you're commissioned to take these people over there just speak to them that they would go forward stay straight in path of duty is that right that's what i'm trying to tell everybody i'm trying to tell everybody let's go forward let's not just stay here let's go forward we can't read how can i say it you can't to bring back the past you know the church ages amen what they did in pentecost and all that that was good but god got something even greater but you'll never know what the greater is until you go forward so you say well how could it be great it's greater the promised land was far greater amen than egypt in egypt they were in bondage in the promised land they were free they had to fight giants but at least they could fight back you couldn't even fight back in egypt if you fought back you were killed hallelujah but unless amen they could fight back and as long as they stayed with the word god gave them victory out the victory after victory after victory it was only when they got off the word they began to fail hallelujah you like you love the lord call to do what sin in the stone you can't you cannot take this lightly most of us don't even know what it means to to even repeat that scripture because we haven't meditated on it we never thought we don't think about what he's asking us to do and do you think that in this condition that we're in that that's going to happen absolutely not there must be changes made in all of us hallelujah he's calling for a perfect bride and that's what he's going to get can you give me a few more minutes i said i was going to cut short at least some of y'all alive tonight to say amen you're saying it in your heart or your head or something i'm going to close on this scripture and i'll pick it up next service won't be sunday because i'm down there in iowa city esther the second chapter in the seventh verse the bible said and he brought up hadassah that is esther his uncle's daughter for she had neither father nor mother that the maid was fair and beautiful whom mordecai when her father and mother were dead took for his own daughter and i'm gonna stop there because that phrase is a type having no father a mother he didn't have to say that but he placed it in there so that you could see that there was something a mystery hid within that passage of scripture because there's only one that i know in the spiritual realm that had no mother or father that was melchizedek and that was elohim and here he's bringing out some because see god can't join you to something that's unequal he can't join himself to something that's not equal it's like the chinese laundry ticket as the prophet of god explained it to us one ticket torn in half see you got to understand amen a lot of these things and listen if the word is opened which it is brother brown said i'm just laying down the basics but i have ministers who will be able to come and bring it to a another level enlightened you he didn't say they're changing because it stays right within the word but i they'll be there they ordained and i'll explain that to you maybe the next service what that is because you got to understand if you just brother said god don't need parrots you know what he meant by that so you understand bird the parrot bird he don't need nobody to repeat it oh just repeat it and see when brother said say say it just like i said it so i'm gonna ask you a question did brother branham quote everything brother paul said he did what paul said he brought the revelation of what paul preached but you'll never see him quoting every scripture going down this is what paul said you understand me it was a revelation you if you if you take it and you bring it intellectually you miss what god does what he do he works by inspiration he works by revelation and if we can't go in this bible with the very stories that brother branham has laid out before us and then find things that he didn't have time to bring out but it's still the word it's not a adding neither is it taken away if the book is not open to you because that's what brings people to fear that's why what has made the nominations in organizations right now in the message because men men are afraid to meet the king they told they told esther that too if you go in meet the king without him summoning you you're going to get killed he gonna kill you if you go to the king's chamber which types out the holy of holies if you go back there if you go there you're gonna die especially if he didn't summons you you know what she said and here's a mystery i'm gonna fast three days at night without food or water and i'm going to see the king you got to understand that esther started out with a wine the whole book started out with a feast what feast there's only been really one feast and that was the opening of the word and everybody was invited to it worldwide it was invited said amen let this go out invitation go out through all of the kingdom which was the type of the whole world let's find a bride for the king you all hear what i'm saying what was it and mordecai had already worked on esther he he you know and i think mordecai means little one and that's what brother branham was he was a little one he wasn't a big one he was a little fella showed the statue as well but he wasn't one of these great preachers that got all his recognition you would have missed him many missed him hallelujah but he was the one working on the bride he told the bride who was esther he said i'm going to tell you what the king likes hallelujah i'm going to let you know what he's like hallelujah and i'm going to give you a robe i'm going to give you a a gown whatever a garment it meant to wear and this is what he likes what was it she didn't dress herself like the worldly woman she dressed herself simple she wore it just like he told her to wear it and when the king saw the character that flowed from her the bible says he loved her and chose her to be queen now i'm gonna stop right there and by god's grace we've got a lot uh uh a lot to share but by god's grace i trust that we if you don't if you don't stop with this intellectual way of thinking it's not because you haven't heard it before some things you may have and some things you may not but the bible says you haven't passed this way before but as long as it's preached and you can find it in the word it is the word amen we're not we're i had a brother correct me he says well you know brother didn't say that the seven church age was over but let me in in in 1956 he preached indictment in revelation uh uh or the third chapter he was put out of the church so what can a church be but over if jesus christ is out huh then where is he he's in the bride of jesus everyone that opened that door to him he said i will come into you not into you and suck with you i will break the bread the revelation open to you if you open the door to me that's where we are it's going home time and we're still fussing and fighting over doctrinal things if we understood grace our doctrines won't mean a thing because brother bradley said when that pressure comes and these christians began to get persecuted he said you're going to be so happy to see a real believer he said you in other words he said you won't ever have you want to ask him what doctrine you believe huh that's not going to if it didn't if it don't matter it won't matter then it doesn't matter now brother brown said god gives all of us the holy ghost with our peculiarities amen people say oh well you know if they ain't baptized in the name of lord jesus christ i don't heard so much stuff i don't heard so much people doctrinal things you don't know election will bring the truth to every believer real believer whether they're part of this or part of something else god will bring it right when elijah thought i'm the only one left god said uh-uh there's 7 000 that hasn't bowed that needs to bail and i don't think elijah knew who those 7 000 were uh you know we so we we're crippled in our minds and you know what as long as we continue to judge as long as we continue to be the way we are you'll never reach perfection your level of thinking must come up higher you must let the mind of christ be in you and if you find out through the scriptures when jesus was called to go somewhere he didn't care whether they were purple yellow blue or black he went even to the to to legion he didn't care what other people think thought about him he did what the father commanded him to do and well we we you know we so what we've done to this message is not right and i don't care if i'm considered a rebel i guess i am because some of the stuff that our people want to believe ain't true he whom the son is set free is free indeed and i got a word that holds me i don't hold a word the word holds me glory to god there's a word called esther is it there ruth is in there hallelujah and garden already told me my story i know what my energy somebody help me here so you say what do you mean let me tell you something even if i'm still on my journey i know my destiny you love the lord amen [Music] [Music] do [Music] once my soul was destroyed [Music] give me peace [Music] when he reached [Music] i was lost [Music] god i was nearing despair when he came and he told me that i could go free [Music] gave me [Music] is [Music] when he reached down [Music] without god [Music] how my [Music] from the tempest to him now i flee i'm sicker from all harms [Music] oh [Music] without god [Music] foreign [Music] oh lord i give [Music] lord guide my feet hold my hand grind with me [Music] is [Music] me i was lost [Music] oh [Music] one more time when he reached he wished [Music] is [Music] without [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] so [Music] you
