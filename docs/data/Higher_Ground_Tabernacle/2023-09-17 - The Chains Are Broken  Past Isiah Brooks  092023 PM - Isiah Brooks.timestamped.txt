[44:08] do that
[44:10] and uh
[44:12] amen so uh uh where we read in Hebrews
[44:16] chapter 1 verse 3 I'm going to read it
[44:18] again
[44:24] so the Bible says that who being the
[44:26] brightness of his glory
[44:29] and the expressed image of his person
[44:32] and upholding All Things by the World by
[44:36] the word of his power when he had by
[44:39] himself Persia Persia sins
[44:41] sat down on the right hand of the
[44:44] Majesty on
[44:50] Heights
[44:57] amen so here's Paul is talking about
[44:59] Jesus
[45:01] amen he's talking about God saying that
[45:04] God you know back then in the Old
[45:06] Testament used to speak to the prophets
[45:12] God spoke to Moses God spoke to David
[45:17] and all those prophets
[45:20] amen and it's that same God who is and
[45:24] then Jesus is the express image of his
[45:26] person
[45:28] Amen in John chapter one we read that in
[45:31] the beginning was the word
[45:35] amen a word doesn't have an image
[45:38] amen nobody can tell me how the word
[45:41] looks like
[46:04] so here Paul now is saying that Jesus
[46:07] Christ
[46:08] amen who being the brightness of his
[46:11] glory
[46:12] amen and the express image of his person
[46:18] so meaning that Jesus Christ is the very
[46:21] image of God himself
[46:25] let's go to First Corinthians chapter 3
[46:27] 10 to 11.
[46:33] First Corinthians chapter 3 verse 10 to
[46:36] 11.
[46:37] I'm trying to place a foundation here
[46:43] amen Paul here says that according to
[46:46] the grace of God which is given unto me
[46:48] as a wise master builder I have laid the
[46:52] foundation and another bill uh and
[46:56] another bill that's thereon
[46:58] but let every man take heed how he
[47:01] buildeth their opponents
[47:10] issue
[47:14] amen so now what is that Foundation
[47:18] verse 11 Paul continue and say that for
[47:21] other Foundation can no man lay then
[47:23] that is laid which is Christ Jesus
[47:31] Christ amen Jesus Christ is a foundation
[47:35] amen Jesus Christ is the foundation of
[47:38] everything
[47:39] he's the foundation of Our Praise women
[47:43] he is the foundation of our worship
[47:45] amen he is the foundation of our prayers
[47:52] everything has to be based on Jesus
[47:55] Christ
[48:04] first of all you have to have Jesus
[48:06] Christ inside foreign
[48:16] [Music]
[48:54] amen Jesus Is God as we started
[48:59] he's the very image of God
[49:02] Amen he's a very image of that word
[49:06] amen so now here in Isaiah chapter 42
[49:09] verse 8.
[49:12] so here is God back in the Old Testament
[49:15] was he juicy don't know he's talking
[49:18] about he's saying that I am the Lord
[49:46] he's a God who will not even he said
[49:48] that my glory will not give to another
[49:50] it's immigration
[49:52] amen so for the people who believes in
[49:55] Trinity
[49:57] amen this verse alone tells us that God
[50:00] will not even share a glory to his own
[50:02] son
[50:03] [Music]
[50:05] amen so he said that my glory will not
[50:08] uh will I not give to another Edition so
[50:12] my glory is for me myself
[50:15] amen so now let's go to Zechariah
[50:17] Chapter Chapter 14 verse 9.
[50:22] is the uh the Bible verse before the the
[50:26] book before Malachi zakaris
[50:30] chapter 14 verse 9.
[50:33] Amen in Isaiah he says that he is the
[50:35] Lord and His glory will not share it
[50:37] with anybody else
[50:42] so now as a career Chapter 14 verse 9
[50:45] the Bible says
[50:47] and the Lord shall be king over all the
[50:51] Earth
[50:54] and that day shall there be one Lord
[51:00] and his name one
[51:04] Isaiah says that his glory will not
[51:07] share
[51:09] and The Courier here says that he says
[51:11] that God will be king all over it but
[51:14] over the all the earth
[51:18] a king has a glory
[51:21] amen the glory belongs to a King
[51:24] amen and he says that in that day
[51:27] there shall only be one Lord in in
[51:31] Europe
[51:33] and
[51:35] his name one is
[51:38] so there is no other Lord
[51:41] amen we don't have two Lords there is
[51:45] only one Lord amen and that Lord will
[51:49] never share his throne
[51:51] with anybody else
[51:53] amen so now let's go to the New
[51:56] Testament
[51:57] amen and find out who is that Lord
[52:00] amen let's go to John chapter 20 verse
[52:04] 27 to 29.
[52:08] amen he is the one Lord
[52:10] and His glory will not share it with
[52:13] anybody
[52:15] John chapter 20.
[52:17] verse 27 to 29.
[52:20] in my verse 27 when the Bible says that
[52:23] is
[52:24] then saith he to Thomas
[52:28] reach hither thy finger and behold my
[52:33] hands and reach here thy hand and thrust
[52:37] it into my side and be not faithless but
[52:41] believing the advance is
[52:49] amen this is Jesus talking to Thomas
[52:52] after the crucifixion
[52:54] so now verse 28.
[52:57] amen the Bible says that and Thomas
[52:59] answered and said unto him my Lord and
[53:02] my God
[53:06] and Jesus said unto him Thomas because
[53:09] thou has seen me thou has believed
[53:12] blessed are they that have not seen and
[53:15] yet have believed
[53:22] amen we heard in the Old Testament
[53:26] amen that God saying that there will
[53:29] only be one Lord
[53:32] and His glory not share it with anybody
[53:35] else
[53:36] so now he comes here after the
[53:39] crucifixion
[53:40] amen Jesus talking to Thomas that Thomas
[53:43] you can see where I was crucified and
[53:45] you see the the uh my side and the palm
[53:48] of my hands
[53:52] and Thomas by touching it and finding
[53:55] out that this is Jesus
[54:00] amen he called him my Lord and my God
[54:05] Amen if Jesus was somebody was another
[54:08] being but I I I I I'm another being
[54:12] different from the father
[54:13] [Music]
[54:15] amen Jesus was going to rebuke Thomas at
[54:19] that same place
[54:23] but rather instead of Jesus rebuking
[54:25] Thomas
[54:28] but Jesus now come to say that because
[54:30] you have touched and you but that's why
[54:32] you believe it anticipated
[54:46] [Music]
[55:04] [Music]
[55:33] now here this is when Peter now started
[55:36] to preach
[55:39] amen this is Peter's first sermon
[55:42] after receiving the holy spirit
[55:45] so now while this is what Peter's saying
[55:49] verse 36 of that chapter two the verses
[55:52] he says that therefore you
[55:56] let out the house of Israel no assured
[56:00] assuredly that God has made that same
[56:04] Jesus whom you have crucified both Lord
[56:08] and Christ amen
[56:13] [Music]
[56:17] amen God has made him Lord and
[56:21] Christopher that same God said that my
[56:24] Throne I will not share with anybody
[56:30] the same God the prophet
[56:34] Prophet said that there will only be one
[56:36] Lord
[56:38] amen but here's Peter it was his CPL
[56:41] after receiving the Holy Spirit
[56:43] which the Holy Spirit Jesus told them it
[56:46] will lead them to all truth
[56:51] which is the holy spirit Jesus told them
[56:54] it will be their
[57:07] amen Peter comes and he says that God
[57:10] has made that Jesus that you have
[57:12] crucified both Lord and
[57:18] Christopher hey man so you want to tell
[57:22] me that the Bible contradicts itself
[57:24] no that means that there is a mystery
[57:27] that we have to find out
[57:30] amen let's go to Revelation chapter 4
[57:33] verse one to three
[57:36] amen this is John now
[57:39] after Jesus calling because revelation
[57:42] we know if you read Revelation chapter
[57:44] one
[57:46] John is doing the introduction of Jesus
[57:49] Christ
[57:51] showing that this is the revelation of
[57:53] Jesus Christ meaning that it's talking
[57:55] about Jesus
[57:57] Christ
[57:59] amen I believe the last chapter of that
[58:01] of that chapter one it says that I am
[58:04] the one who was and who is and who is to
[58:06] come
[58:10] amen so now here in chapter four of the
[58:13] of Revelation
[58:15] verse one two three
[58:18] amen here John says that after this I
[58:21] looked and behold a door was open in
[58:24] heaven
[58:25] and the first voice which I heard was as
[58:29] aware of a trumpet talking with me which
[58:32] said come up hither and I will show the
[58:35] things which must be hereafter
[58:39] was
[58:49] sweet and immediately
[58:52] I was in the spirit and behold a throne
[58:55] was set in heaven and one sat on that
[58:59] throne and he that said was to look upon
[59:04] like a Jasper and a sword and stone and
[59:07] there was a rainbow round about The
[59:09] Throne inside lock onto an emerald is
[59:21] right so now let's look uh very
[59:24] carefully in the verse 2 of this chapter
[59:26] Allah
[59:28] and immediately I was in the spirit
[59:32] and behold I saw only one Throne it was
[59:38] and was said in heaven that was set in
[59:41] heaven
[59:43] and on that Throne
[59:45] one person
[59:47] said on that Throne
[59:50] John did not see two Thrones
[59:55] tree Thrones one from the one for the
[59:58] Father the other one from the Son and
[59:59] the other one from those Spirits
[1:00:04] amen but he only saw one throne
[1:00:07] and on that Throne only one person said
[1:00:11] on that Throne
[1:00:13] amen so now when you jump again to verse
[1:00:16] 9 and 11.
[1:00:19] and he said that when those beasts give
[1:00:22] glory and honor and thanks to him
[1:00:26] amen John did not say today that said on
[1:00:29] that throne but he said to him
[1:00:36] [Music]
[1:00:38] who liveth forever and ever
[1:00:42] the secretary sector amen only breath
[1:00:45] forever and ever
[1:00:47] amen if you look downward forever and
[1:00:49] ever
[1:00:51] amen you look it up in chapter one
[1:00:57] you will see Jesus telling that to John
[1:01:02] the one who was dead and now we rise not
[1:01:05] arose and and I live uh forever and ever
[1:01:10] amen so John so Jesus sitting on that
[1:01:14] throne
[1:01:16] and now verse 10 it says that the 4 and
[1:01:19] 20 Elders fall down before him that said
[1:01:22] on that throne and to worship him that
[1:01:25] leaveth forever and ever and cast their
[1:01:29] crowns Before the Throne saying
[1:01:32] this is
[1:01:42] saying they are worthy O Lord
[1:01:46] to receive glory and honor and power for
[1:01:49] thou has created all things for thy
[1:01:52] pleasure they are and were created is
[1:01:56] [Music]
[1:02:10] [Music]
[1:02:17] because thou has created all things
[1:02:22] amen when you go in Genesis chapter one
[1:02:27] that verse chapter 1 verse 1.
[1:02:30] amen that verse says that in the
[1:02:33] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[1:02:36] Earth
[1:02:39] so now here is in the Revelation
[1:02:43] apocalypse John is talking about Jesus
[1:02:54] Genesis chapter 1 verse one
[1:02:58] the Bible is telling us that in the
[1:03:00] beginning God
[1:03:03] created all things meaning that Jesus is
[1:03:07] God
[1:03:09] Amen he said that and for that pleasure
[1:03:14] they are and their work created
[1:03:18] now let's go to First Timothy chapter 3
[1:03:21] verse 16.
[1:03:25] amen First Timothy chapter 3 verse 16.
[1:03:30] amen here the Bible says that and
[1:03:33] without controversy great is the mystery
[1:03:35] of godliness
[1:03:37] God was manifesting flesh in the flesh
[1:03:41] justifying the spirit
[1:03:43] scene of angels preached unto the
[1:03:46] Gentiles believed on in the world
[1:03:49] receive their pin to glory amen
[1:04:10] amen God was manifest In the Flesh
[1:04:14] seriously manifested on a chair amen he
[1:04:17] didn't save somebody else but he said
[1:04:19] God
[1:04:21] was manifest In the Flesh
[1:04:24] amen so the word manifests
[1:04:27] it means to become obvious In the Flesh
[1:04:33] amen it becomes obvious to the human eye
[1:04:37] yes
[1:04:40] so in other words God became obvious to
[1:04:43] the human eyes
[1:04:47] amen he could walk and people will see
[1:04:50] him
[1:04:51] and he could eat and people would see
[1:04:54] him eating
[1:04:55] amen so that's why he said that great is
[1:04:58] the mystery of godliness
[1:05:00] amen because God became obvious In the
[1:05:04] Flesh
[1:05:05] amen God became obvious in the human eye
[1:05:08] do you see my face
[1:05:10] amen he was justified in the spirit
[1:05:14] amen he was seen of angels Buddhism
[1:05:16] preached unto the Gentiles believe down
[1:05:20] in the world
[1:05:21] received up in the glory
[1:05:24] amen so what was that God was manifested
[1:05:28] Amen in first John chapter 1 verse one
[1:05:31] question
[1:05:32] the beginning was the word
[1:05:35] and the Word was with God
[1:05:38] the Word was God
[1:05:40] Amen you jump to chapter verse 14.
[1:05:44] it says that that word became flesh
[1:05:48] amen that same word that created
[1:05:51] [Music]
[1:05:52] that same word that say Let There Be
[1:06:54] amen you see that John is calling him
[1:06:57] the Lamb of God
[1:06:59] was it two different people
[1:07:03] or the same person
[1:07:05] who's that same person manifested Amen
[1:07:08] manifested in the other
[1:07:11] ways to manifested
[1:07:13] same person amen fulfilling another
[1:07:16] scriptures
[1:07:21] to dream and he's the Lamb of God
[1:07:24] Amen so the father is the son
[1:07:28] the son is the spirit
[1:07:30] amen and that's God is he drew amen so
[1:07:34] now who and what is God I mean
[1:07:38] who is God
[1:07:40] Amen Prophet says that God is an object
[1:07:42] of worship
[1:07:45] amen so God is something that is
[1:07:48] somebody or something that we worship
[1:07:51] so now we come at church and we worship
[1:07:54] God
[1:07:56] amen will praise the name of the Lord
[1:08:00] so who is God
[1:08:03] amen the prophet here uh uh uh here he
[1:08:07] says that the prophetic uh God had three
[1:08:10] uh God had three-fold purpose in his
[1:08:13] great mystery
[1:08:17] Minister the first one God wanted to
[1:08:20] reveal himself to his people
[1:08:24] and the way to do it was to become a son
[1:08:29] God in Christ
[1:08:32] amen that's why he was manifesting in
[1:08:35] the flesh
[1:08:37] Amen to become a son amen that's why he
[1:08:41] says that in him
[1:08:43] amen what's the fullness of God
[1:08:46] Amen that dwelled in him amen so Jesus
[1:08:50] was the flesh
[1:08:53] if you look at other other sermons you
[1:08:56] see that the prophet saying that when I
[1:08:57] was a part of God
[1:09:01] Amen because there is not a Eternal sin
[1:09:14] let's go to John chapter uh John chapter
[1:09:17] one uh uh uh verse 1 and 2.
[1:09:23] amen amen here the first purpose of God
[1:09:28] reveal himself to his people
[1:09:31] in the Old Testament when God was on the
[1:09:35] mountain
[1:09:37] anything that was touching that mountain
[1:09:39] had to die
[1:10:05] even Moses when Moses was coming down
[1:10:08] from the mountains
[1:10:10] the anointing of God was so strong
[1:10:14] amen the Bible says that his face was
[1:10:16] veiled
[1:10:17] people wouldn't even see his mother's
[1:10:20] face
[1:10:21] so what about God seeing God
[1:10:25] yet he had a desire
[1:10:28] to show himself to be to us
[1:10:32] and when he had a desire
[1:10:34] to manifest himself to the people
[1:10:38] amen he had a desire
[1:10:40] meant to become Our Savior
[1:10:42] the only way to be our savior yes
[1:10:48] and go die as the Lamb on the cross
[1:10:54] we said in John chapter 1 and 2.
[1:10:58] amen
[1:11:01] amen in chapter 14 and verse 14 it says
[1:11:05] that that same word was made flesh
[1:11:10] and that would dwelled Among Us
[1:11:13] so now here he says again the end we
[1:11:16] beheld this Glory his glory the glory as
[1:11:21] the as of the only begotten of the
[1:11:23] father full of grace and truth is
[1:11:34] to see or to observe contemplation
[1:11:38] Amen to observe a thing
[1:11:59] God the word was made obvious to the
[1:12:03] human eye
[1:12:06] amen and that word was Jesus Christ
[1:12:09] now in first John chapter one
[1:12:13] verse 1 and 2.
[1:12:15] first John verse 1 and 2.
[1:12:20] so now here the Bible says
[1:12:23] that which was from the beginning
[1:12:29] first John chapter one
[1:12:31] I believe there's only one chapter in
[1:12:34] first John
[1:12:35] first John chapter one verse one
[1:12:40] John is saying that that which was from
[1:12:43] the beginning
[1:12:46] from the beginning
[1:12:48] the word
[1:12:50] god drew that which was from the
[1:12:54] beginning
[1:12:55] which we have heard
[1:12:58] what did we heard we heard the word that
[1:13:03] was from the beginning
[1:13:05] which we have seen with our eyes
[1:13:09] how can you see the word unless that
[1:13:12] word becomes a person
[1:13:15] he says that that word that was from the
[1:13:18] beginning
[1:13:20] we have heard that word that was from
[1:13:22] the beginning
[1:13:24] and we have seen it with our eyes
[1:13:28] which we have looked upon is
[1:13:32] and our hands have handled
[1:13:35] to see of the word of life
[1:13:39] amen so now verse 2. he says that for
[1:13:44] the life was manifested
[1:13:46] manifesty and we have seen it a bear
[1:13:50] Witness
[1:13:53] and show unto you that eternal life that
[1:13:59] eternal life which was with the father
[1:14:02] and was manifested unto us
[1:14:06] amen remember when we read in Revelation
[1:14:09] apocalypse I am the one whose lives who
[1:14:12] is who was and who is and who is to come
[1:14:16] who lives forevermore
[1:14:18] it was that eternal life who was with
[1:14:21] the father
[1:14:23] and was manifested into us
[1:14:28] in the message to take on uh the the
[1:14:32] whole armor of God
[1:14:36] paragraph 113.
[1:14:38] amen the prophet says
[1:14:41] first he was the spoken word out yonder
[1:14:46] now here it is
[1:14:49] you could touch it
[1:14:54] and then when the enemies still coming
[1:14:56] like a flooded means he poured the word
[1:15:01] into the person
[1:15:04] being the form of the Holy Ghost a
[1:15:07] Donald former juicent is free there is
[1:15:09] your there's your one two three again
[1:15:15] justification sanctification
[1:15:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:20] like Father Son and Holy Ghost and so
[1:15:23] forth and Perfection
[1:15:28] now notice the spoken word
[1:15:33] that was God above us
[1:15:36] God With Us
[1:15:39] now God in us

[1:16:28] amen he's the one who was in the
[1:16:30] beginning
[1:16:32] he created everything for him and by him
[1:16:37] and he is the god who lived with the the
[1:16:39] with the apostles
[1:16:46] and he said that he will not leave us
[1:16:48] nor forsake us
[1:16:51] amen
[1:17:02] so the first purpose
[1:17:08] so the only way to be a father was to be
[1:17:11] a son Allah
[1:17:14] so now the second purpose
[1:17:18] he purpose purpose was to live in the
[1:17:21] people
[1:17:23] and the only way to do that is
[1:17:30] amen he had he wanted to live inside of
[1:17:33] people if we live on interior of the
[1:17:35] zone now in John chapter 4 verse 24.
[1:17:40] amen so now how can thou God Jesus
[1:17:45] amen who was walking
[1:17:47] come and live inside of us
[1:17:51] how can it be
[1:17:54] amen how can that God Jesus
[1:17:58] amen live inside of us
[1:18:01] so now John chapter 4 verse 24.
[1:18:05] the Bible says that God is a spirit
[1:18:10] and they that worship Him
[1:18:13] must worship Him in spirit and in truth
[1:18:25] have to worship Him in spirit and in
[1:18:28] truth
[1:18:30] amen before that we say that the Holy
[1:18:33] Spirit the God Jesus said the holy
[1:18:35] spirit will teach us in all truth
[1:18:38] and here it says that God is the spirit
[1:18:41] is free and the only way to worship him
[1:18:47] it's in that spirit
[1:18:52] amen so the only way to worship Him
[1:18:56] amen is with the holy spirit
[1:18:59] amen because he is the spirit is free
[1:19:02] because that's the truth so now John
[1:19:05] Chapter 14 verse 16 to 21.
[1:19:10] in my John Chapter 14 verse 16 to 21.
[1:19:16] Amen in chapter four The
[1:19:32] and here Jesus is saying that I will
[1:19:35] pray the father
[1:19:38] and he shall give you another comforter
[1:19:41] that he may abide with you forever
[1:19:45] um
[1:19:50] so if you take only this verse 16.
[1:19:54] amen you will think that Jesus was
[1:19:56] talking to will pray to someone else
[1:20:01] and that's someone else who is the
[1:20:03] father is
[1:20:07] a comforter
[1:20:10] to be with you so it makes it three
[1:20:13] people
[1:20:14] remember if we continue here you see
[1:20:18] that the Bible continue Jesus continues
[1:20:20] and says
[1:20:21] even the spirit of Truth
[1:20:25] amen before that we read that God is a
[1:20:28] spirit
[1:20:29] we have to worship Him in spirit and
[1:20:31] truth
[1:20:32] so now Jesus is saying that even the
[1:20:35] spirit of Truth
[1:20:38] whom the world cannot receive
[1:20:41] because they see of him not
[1:20:44] with him but you know him
[1:20:48] for he dwelleth with you and shall be in
[1:20:52] you
[1:20:55] amen he says that that Spirit of Truth
[1:20:57] it is
[1:21:01] [Music]
[1:21:03] meaning that in this the same moment
[1:21:06] that Jesus was talking
[1:21:07] [Music]
[1:21:09] that Spirit of Truth was with them
[1:21:13] and he said that and it will be in you
[1:21:17] so he couldn't say that he is in you
[1:21:20] amen because Jesus was that same spirit
[1:21:24] amen he was talking to them so he was
[1:21:28] that Spirit of truth that was with them
[1:21:31] so he couldn't be in them
[1:21:34] because before being in them he had to
[1:21:36] die and go up and then God will send
[1:21:39] that spirit that same Spirit down
[1:21:40] baskets
[1:21:45] because it's only one person
[1:21:49] with different masks
[1:21:55] changing masks is that same God that was
[1:21:59] with them
[1:22:00] and it's that same God that will be in
[1:22:03] them
[1:22:05] and he said that I will not leave you
[1:22:08] comfortless it is
[1:22:12] here Jesus is using the personal pronoun
[1:22:31] [Music]
[1:23:13] is the Lord Jesus Christ because he will
[1:23:17] be that spirit that will be in US
[1:23:20] and in verse 21 he said that he that has
[1:23:24] my Commandments and keepeth them
[1:23:27] he it is their love with me and he that
[1:23:31] love with me shall be loved of my father
[1:23:34] and I will love him and will manifest
[1:23:38] myself
[1:23:48] Jesus Christ is that same Spirit
[1:23:52] Jesus Christ is the holy spirit is the
[1:23:56] spirit of God Amen he is the spirit of
[1:23:59] Truth
[1:24:00] amen so we have when we worship
[1:24:03] we have to Worship in Jesus name
[1:24:06] amen so when we worship we have to
[1:24:09] Worship in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:24:11] Christ
[1:24:12] amen because the Bible says that we have
[1:24:15] to worship God in truth and in spirit
[1:24:20] amen so the spirit is God or this
[1:24:23] procedure amen and that spirit will be
[1:24:25] in US
[1:24:27] a person who will be enough Jesus said
[1:24:29] it will be me what will be in you
[1:24:31] [Music]
[1:24:33] amen so the only way to worship
[1:24:36] the only way to pray
[1:24:39] it's in the name of the Lord
[1:24:42] amen that's the reason why we do baptize
[1:24:44] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:24:48] amen because he's the only true God
[1:24:52] that is the name of God
[1:24:55] because he was manifest In the Flesh
[1:24:59] because he is the very image of God
[1:25:03] Amen because he is that same word that
[1:25:05] was in the beginning
[1:25:07] that same word
[1:25:10] that word lived with us
[1:25:13] and now the promise is that that word
[1:25:16] will be in us
[1:25:19] which is the holy spirit
[1:25:22] chapter 2 verse
[1:25:24] so now in First Corinthians chapter 3
[1:25:33] Corinthians chapter 3 verse 16 to 17.
[1:25:38] amen the Bible says
[1:25:40] no ye not that you are the temple of God
[1:25:47] and that the spirit of God dwelleth in
[1:25:51] you
[1:25:53] and when you see here now the the the
[1:25:57] tense of that verb has changed
[1:26:01] amen Paul did not say that that spirit
[1:26:04] will be in you born with Deepak but he
[1:26:07] said that that spirit is in you it is
[1:26:10] amen because Jesus already died
[1:26:15] this was after the crucifixion
[1:26:18] that that spirit dwelleth in you it is
[1:26:22] and if any man defiled the temple of God
[1:26:35] which Temple you are
[1:26:38] so now Jesus is the spirit of God
[1:26:42] Amen you are the temple of God
[1:26:45] because of that spirit that dwells in
[1:26:48] you
[1:26:49] across the city is
[1:26:51] amen John Chapter 14 verse 6 is
[1:26:56] amen because of that Spirit according
[1:26:59] the spirit of Jesus it is produces you
[1:27:03] amen the Bible says that Jesus saith
[1:27:05] unto him now people this is really D I
[1:27:08] am the way
[1:27:09] the truth and the life no man cometh
[1:27:14] unto the father but by me
[1:27:18] I am the way this is
[1:27:25] that we have to worship God in
[1:27:38] [Music]
[1:27:39] John says in first John chapter one
[1:27:45] um that everlasting life that was with
[1:27:49] the father in the beginning
[1:27:52] was manifested to us
[1:27:56] amen this that same life that Jesus is
[1:27:58] saying I am the way is he said to
[1:28:01] remember
[1:28:02] I am that truth
[1:28:04] and I am their life
[1:28:07] so no man can come to the father but by
[1:28:10] me
[1:28:14] when we started with our servant
[1:28:18] we wanted to build that Foundation of
[1:28:21] Jesus
[1:28:23] showing that Jesus is the foundation of
[1:28:26] everything
[1:28:45] [Music]
[1:28:54] advising us how to pray
[1:28:57] you notice he said that I no longer call
[1:29:00] you servants
[1:29:02] because the servant does not know his
[1:29:04] master's business
[1:29:07] but instead I have called you friends
[1:29:10] for everything that I learned from my
[1:29:13] father I have made known to you
[1:29:17] so now verse 16 it says that you did not
[1:29:20] choose me the verses
[1:29:22] but I chose you and appointed you so
[1:29:25] that you might go and bear fruit
[1:29:42] the father will give you if they are
[1:29:45] thank you
[1:29:47] and when he said that whatever you ask
[1:29:50] in my name
[1:29:53] why in his name because he is the
[1:29:55] foundation
[1:29:57] because everything has to be about upon
[1:30:00] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:30:02] [Music]
[1:30:04] even our house has to be built upon the
[1:30:07] name of the Lord Jesus
[1:30:10] amen our relationships has to be based
[1:30:13] upon the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:30:17] amen amen amen everything that we do has
[1:30:20] to be built upon the Lord Jesus
[1:30:24] and when we go and pray
[1:30:26] he says that whatever you ask in my name
[1:30:31] whatever you ask in the name of the Lord
[1:30:33] Jesus Christ
[1:30:36] the father will give you
[1:30:39] why because you ask him in the name of
[1:30:41] the Lord Jesus
[1:30:48] amen amen let's read uh one more
[1:30:54] um
[1:30:54] Court here is only really not situation
[1:30:57] amen it's found in an explosion uh
[1:31:01] exposure of the seven Church ages
[1:31:03] degrees
[1:31:09] and when he says that let's go back in
[1:31:12] the Bible and see what he was in the
[1:31:13] beginning according to the Revelation he
[1:31:16] has he gave of himself is
[1:31:24] the great Jehovah appeared to Israel on
[1:31:27] the pillar of fire the ground
[1:31:33] as the angel of the Covenant
[1:31:38] he lived in the appeal of in that pill
[1:31:40] of fire and led Israel daily
[1:31:45] foreign
[1:32:01] body that was prepared for him
[1:32:10] [Music]
[1:32:12] he says that the god that tabernacled
[1:32:15] above the tents of Israel now took on
[1:32:18] himself a tent of Flesh and Tabernacle
[1:32:22] as a man amongst men
[1:32:37] [Music]
[1:32:52] [Music]
[1:33:08] [Music]
[1:33:23] Jesus said
[1:33:25] I came from God and go back to God
[1:33:30] John chapter 16 verse 27 to 28.
[1:33:35] that is exactly what happened
[1:33:38] he disappeared from Earth
[1:33:41] by way of his death burial and
[1:33:45] Resurrection
[1:33:49] then Paul met him on the road to
[1:33:51] Damascus on sweeter
[1:33:55] and he spoke to Paul and said so so why
[1:33:59] persecute us
[1:34:07] he said I am Jesus
[1:34:11] amen he was a pill of fire
[1:34:15] a blinding light
[1:34:17] he had to turn back exactly as he said
[1:34:22] he would
[1:34:24] reset the former exactly
[1:34:26] back to the same form that he was before
[1:34:30] took on a tabernacle of Flesh
[1:34:36] that is exactly how John saw it
[1:34:41] chapter 1 verse 18.
[1:34:44] no man has seen God at any time
[1:34:48] the only begotten which is the bosom of
[1:34:52] the father
[1:34:53] he has declared him
[1:34:57] no this is where John says that Jesus is
[1:35:03] says that he is in the bosom of the
[1:35:05] father
[1:35:07] amen so the prophet here is saying
[1:35:10] amen that Jesus amen who created
[1:35:13] everything
[1:35:15] he started the first form that he took
[1:35:20] was a form of a pillar of fireman
[1:35:24] amen so now he has gone back to that
[1:35:27] foreign
[1:35:33] amen is that same God Jesus amen there
[1:35:36] is no three Gods there is only one God
[1:35:40] and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:35:43] amen Paul says that God
[1:35:46] has made him both Lord and Christ
[1:35:54] amen it's under that name that we should
[1:35:57] be baptized
[1:35:59] amen that's why Jesus said that go
[1:36:02] therefore to every nation and baptize
[1:36:05] them in the name of the father Son and
[1:36:06] the Holy Spirit foreign
[1:36:33] say that go baptize in the name
[1:36:36] so meaning that the father son and
[1:36:38] Spirits
[1:36:40] they have One Singular name
[1:36:43] amen and that name is the Lord Jesus
[1:36:46] amen and it's under that name that every
[1:36:49] nail shall bow is
[1:36:52] only that name that one the devil hears
[1:36:55] that he trembles
[1:36:59] amen it's only under that name that we
[1:37:02] do cast out evil
[1:37:05] amen it's only under that name that we
[1:37:08] pray for the sick people
[1:37:11] it's only that same name under that same
[1:37:13] name that we worship
[1:37:16] amen we don't worship Brothers
[1:37:19] amen but we worship the Lord Jesus
[1:37:21] Christ
[1:37:23] Amen brother Branham is not our God
[1:37:26] Amen we don't pray in the name of
[1:37:28] Brothers
[1:37:30] remember we pray in the name of the Lord
[1:37:32] Jesus Christ
[1:37:36] [Music]
[1:38:32] that same God who told Peter where to go
[1:38:35] get money
[1:38:37] amen that same God who was given the
[1:38:40] five bread and two and three fish
[1:38:45] amen is that same God that multiplied
[1:38:50] the Pentacles amen that came in the
[1:38:54] supposed to remember
[1:38:57] Paul says that that same God dwareth in
[1:39:00] you
