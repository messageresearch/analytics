[45:37] relationships and the man was the most
[45:40] important part of that relationship and
[45:42] how a man was the most important port
[45:44] sorry important part of that
[45:48] relationship and we have to be very
[45:51] careful and we have to be very careful
[45:53] that we keep the man as the head of the
[45:54] house that we keep the man as the head
[45:56] of the house because in this
[45:58] day in this day we live in an age where
[46:04] people try and live equal we live in an
[46:07] age where people try and live equal oh
[46:10] listen to the radio
[46:12] about oh a long time ago now I listened
[46:14] to the radio a long time ago
[46:18] and psychology I was his psychologist on
[46:22] he was talking about at one time men and
[46:25] women knew their place
[46:27] he was talking about that at one time
[46:29] men and women knew their place and would
[46:31] stay in their place and would stay in
[46:33] their place would be the bread woman
[46:36] bread winner the man would be the bread
[46:37] winner and the woman would
[46:39] be sub servant him and the woman would
[46:43] be Subs servant to him but now he said
[46:47] but now he said when they come home when
[46:49] they come home the man is fighting his
[46:51] Corner the man is fighting his corner is
[46:54] fighting her Corner the woman is
[46:56] fighting her corner corner and the sad

[1:07:42] you to see that and God wants you to see
[1:07:45] that you want another yes 1 Corinthians
[1:07:51] 7 1 Corinthians 7
[1:08:01] I some
[1:08:11] cies yeah conning the things have you
[1:08:15] got you got it have you all got
[1:08:19] it certain things all you me it is good
[1:08:25] from man nor to T your woman
[1:08:28] amen now I may say a few things here
[1:08:33] which may seem inappropriate I may say a
[1:08:37] few things here that seem inappropriate
[1:08:41] but you go to the doctor you go to the
[1:08:45] doctor and he he tells you the truth and
[1:08:48] he tells you the truth let me say this
[1:08:50] let me say this if I can't preach the
[1:08:52] truth if I can't preach the truth
[1:08:57] with respect to who I'm talking to with
[1:09:00] respect to who I'm talking to there
[1:09:02] something wrong then there's something
[1:09:03] wrong am
[1:09:06] so it is good for a man not to touch a
[1:09:09] woman it is good for a man not to touch
[1:09:11] a
[1:09:12] woman a psychologist a psychologist or a
[1:09:15] doctor or a doctor will tell you that
[1:09:20] man he reacts sexually to what he sees
[1:09:25] they will tell you that he reacts
[1:09:27] sexually by what he sees a
[1:09:30] woman reacts to touch but the woman
[1:09:34] reacts to
[1:09:35] touch
[1:09:37] and and
[1:09:39] so we we should take seriously so we
[1:09:43] should take this seriously it is good
[1:09:45] for man not to touch a woman it is good
[1:09:48] for a man not to touch a
[1:09:51] woman he's he he's enclosing something
[1:09:55] her because he's encouraging something
[1:09:57] in her as she dresses
[1:10:01] in
[1:10:03] in clothing that makes her sexual and if
[1:10:08] she dresses in clothing that makes her
[1:10:11] sexual she too will
[1:10:15] be encourage him right she too will be
[1:10:19] encouraging something in him and and is
[1:10:24] is up to us and it's up to us to choose
[1:10:27] our way to choose our way
[1:10:35] yes and God wants you to choose your one
[1:10:40] and God wants you to choose your way
[1:10:42] your way should be his way your way
[1:10:44] should be his way and his way I believe

[1:12:04] they were naked because they were
[1:12:07] naked
[1:12:09] and
[1:12:12] and else as well and
[1:12:18] I as I'm concerned as far as I'm
[1:12:21] concerned God what God
[1:12:25] going to be clo want everybody to be
[1:12:30] clothed yes and God wants
[1:12:36] us to see all and God wants to see wants
[1:12:40] us to see in our day what it says about
[1:12:43] those around us what it says about those
[1:12:47] around

[1:12:54] poor God blind naked naked and don't
[1:12:58] know it and don't know it so if they

[1:13:18] but there's a church somewhere is naked
[1:13:21] that is naked and don't know it
[1:13:27] and we we got to walk in in this way we
[1:13:32] have to walk in this
[1:13:39] way he's good for a man not to touch a
[1:13:42] woman
[1:13:44] nevertheless to avoid
[1:13:48] fornication that every man have his own
[1:13:50] wife every husband everyone have own
[1:13:53] husband to avoid
[1:13:57] fornication to avoid
[1:14:04] fornication fornication
[1:14:14] fornication it's the worst thing that is
[1:14:16] foration it's the worst thing that is
[1:14:20] fornication Bible says flee fornication
[1:14:24] the Bible says flee
[1:14:26] fornication do you flee fornication do
[1:14:28] you flee
[1:14:35] fornication I remember was
[1:14:39] preaching town in England I I remember
[1:14:42] once preaching in a town in England and
[1:14:45] the Lord stopped me and the Lord stopped
[1:14:47] me and say foration in the congregation
[1:14:51] and and he said there's fornication in
[1:14:53] the congregation oh I said it so I said
[1:14:56] it
[1:14:58] and and I made an appeal and I made an
[1:15:02] appeal those who want prayer about it
[1:15:05] and those who want to prayer about
[1:15:07] it come forward come forward
[1:15:11] well to my
[1:15:14] surprise people started coming forward
[1:15:16] to my surprise people started coming
[1:15:18] forward
[1:15:20] because my surprise the reason why I say
[1:15:23] to my surprise is is because I really
[1:15:26] should say go to the pastor I really
[1:15:29] should say go to the pastor and talk to
[1:15:30] him in private and talk to him in
[1:15:32] private because if a woman saw husband
[1:15:35] go
[1:15:36] forward if a woman saw a husband go for
[1:15:39] forward then
[1:15:42] [Music]
[1:15:44] then it could wreck the marriage it
[1:15:46] could wreck the
[1:15:49] marriage but fornication something to be
[1:15:52] avoided but fornication is something to
[1:15:54] be avoid void
[1:15:56] it and once you're married once you are
[1:16:01] married let the husband Render unto wife
[1:16:04] two brothers and
[1:16:07] also wife un
[1:16:10] husband that
[1:16:12] means
[1:16:14] that your body is not your own that's
[1:16:17] right it means that your body is not
[1:16:18] your own amen and your body should be
[1:16:21] used to to fulfill what
[1:16:25] your husband and wife needs your body
[1:16:29] should be used to fulfill what your
[1:16:32] husband or wife
[1:16:34] needs this is the Bible this is the
[1:16:37] Bible and you should live it and you
[1:16:41] should live it amen not discuss it not
[1:16:46] not discuss it and go your own way and
[1:16:47] go your own way not
[1:16:51] use use sex to get your own way not use
[1:16:55] sex to get your own way which is another
[1:16:58] common thing which is another common
[1:17:02] thing where instead of instead of being
[1:17:06] free where instead of being free man has
[1:17:10] to pay for it the man has to pay for
[1:17:14] it by
[1:17:17] buy by by buying wife for buying things
[1:17:21] for her wife for his wife and things
[1:17:24] like that things like
[1:17:31] that verse
[1:17:34] four Corinthians 7 verse4 the wife the
[1:17:39] wife has not power of her own body but
[1:17:42] the husband and likewise also the
[1:17:45] husband has not power of his own body
[1:17:47] but the
[1:17:50] wife and verse five defraud ye not one
[1:17:53] the other except it be with consent for
[1:17:56] a time that you may give yourselves to
[1:17:58] fasting and prayer and come together
[1:18:00] again that Satan tempt you not for your
[1:18:05] incontinency do that make sense to you
[1:18:07] does that make sense to
[1:18:09] you oh press on let's just press on then
[1:18:14] you men you men I see your wife not as
[1:18:18] dor you must treat your wives not as
[1:18:21] doormats p is if you treat them wrong
[1:18:25] Peter said if you treat them wrong then
[1:18:29] your prayers will be hindered then your
[1:18:31] prayers will be
[1:18:33] hindered and I don't want my prayers
[1:18:36] hindered I don't want my prayers
[1:18:38] hindered nor should you nor should you
[1:18:41] but the reason for that is the reason
[1:18:44] for that is your wife should be a part
[1:18:47] of Jesus Christ your wife should be a
[1:18:49] part of Jesus Christ and this is what
[1:18:51] you treat her and the way you treat her
[1:18:54] you treat the Lord Jesus Christ means
[1:18:56] you treated the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:18:59] God wants you to treat him
[1:19:05] as someone special and the Lord wants
[1:19:08] you to treat her as someone special and
[1:19:10] God will bless you and God will bless
[1:19:13] you but he will also AV answer your
[1:19:17] prayers but he will also avoid answering
[1:19:20] your prayers depending on your attitude
[1:19:22] you want depending on your attitude
[1:19:24] towards your
[1:19:26] wife so we see that God is in complete
[1:19:31] control
[1:19:32] of our marriages so we see that God is
[1:19:36] in complete control of our marriages if
[1:19:38] we let him be if we let him be we you
[1:19:40] let him be in complete control of your
[1:19:44] marriage will you let him be in complete
[1:19:46] control of your marriage because if he
[1:19:47] won't because if you won then there's
[1:19:49] something wrong there's something
[1:19:53] wrong is he is he in control of your
[1:19:56] money is he in control of your
[1:19:59] money do you share your money problem
[1:20:02] you why do you share your money properly
[1:20:04] with your wife money proper with your
[1:20:07] wife pardon money proper with your wife
[1:20:10] money problem yeah do you discuss money
[1:20:13] problems with your
[1:20:16] wife
[1:20:18] because she may be a good accountant
[1:20:20] because she might may be a good
[1:20:23] accountant she knows how how to spend
[1:20:28] money and she knows how to spend money I
[1:20:31] don't mean that in a funny way I don't
[1:20:32] be in a funny way but but she may she
[1:20:35] may be a better better user of money
[1:20:38] than you she might be a better user of
[1:20:41] money than you so you should take
[1:20:43] advantage of that so you you should take
[1:20:45] advantage of that because she'll help
[1:20:48] you get your finances sorted out she
[1:20:51] will help you get your finances sorted
[1:20:53] out this is how a wife can help her
