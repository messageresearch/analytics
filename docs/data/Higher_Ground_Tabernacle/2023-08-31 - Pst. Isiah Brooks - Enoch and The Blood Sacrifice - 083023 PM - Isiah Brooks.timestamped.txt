[26:42] how many of y'all believe we're living

[26:46] I believe that with all of my harsh
[26:49] questions
[26:53] God in his greatness
[26:56] the more I think about my salvation the
[26:59] priest responsible what he's done for me
[27:02] I'm sure things that people want you you
[27:03] go through this throughout the day
[27:07] that God wasn't going to risk savaku Jr
[27:13] it's a Redemption plan
[27:18] with not even the greatest of all angels
[27:23] we know that God came down himself
[27:27] as our Prophet said I didn't use even
[27:31] the secretary
[27:34] he came down himself remember so First
[27:38] Corinthians
[27:43] for who have known the mind of the Lord
[27:48] that he may instruct him
[27:51] but we have the mind of Christ
[28:03] Philippians 2 or Philippians
[28:06] five through six we also sanctuary
[28:15] and it reads
[28:17] let this mind be in you which was also
[28:21] in Christ Jesus Christ
[28:27] who being in the form of God thought it
[28:30] not robbery to be equal with God
[28:32] existence
[28:38] let us pray
[28:40] our heavenly father we come before you

[29:11] Lord we believe there's Hallelujah with
[29:15] all of our hearts
[29:18] we thank you Father God for your
[29:21] accusing for us
[29:23] this last day to manifest Your Glory
[29:28] Jesus Christ
[29:31] amen amen you may be seated
[29:36] my I like to entitle this message
[29:46] and you wonder why um
[29:49] working with the word Enoch this name is
[30:01] first of all he was the seventh
[30:03] generation from Adam
[30:08] which places Us
[30:11] in the seventh City Church age
[30:17] and it was during this time
[30:21] that God had a Prophet by the name of
[30:25] Enoch could you imagine
[30:27] and brother Branham tells us that Enoch
[30:31] was a type of the Bride
[30:34] [Music]
[30:35] for those of us who may not know the
[30:39] meaning of Enoch so the name
[30:44] Enoch means dedicated
[30:48] trained for me and discipline a
[30:52] discipline
[30:54] I'm gonna say that again
[30:56] Enoch means dedicated
[31:00] train for me
[31:03] and discipline a discipline
[31:06] and you know and I know
[31:09] brother Branham said the Bride Comes to
[31:12] be tested
[31:15] and we know by God's grace
[31:19] that the one who's testing us
[31:22] is actually God himself
[31:27] in the message God provided place of
[31:30] worship
[31:36] 1965.
[31:38] paragraph 140 the biographer uh brother
[31:43] Branham says it like this
[31:45] let's take a man here that kept all the
[31:49] word of God
[31:53] back in the Old Testament
[31:56] by the name of Enoch
[31:59] he was so quickened by the word of God
[32:05] that he had a testimony
[32:08] that he pleased to
[32:13] there wasn't one thing
[32:16] that God commanded Enoch to do now
[32:21] what he did because
[32:24] y'all understand me let me read this let
[32:27] me read this last portion again
[32:30] there wasn't one thing that God
[32:34] commanded Enoch to do
[32:37] but what he did because
[32:40] Hallelujah so we said well what do you
[32:43] mean brother Brooks
[32:44] if we if that is the shadow city of what
[32:50] we're to be we're to be the real thing
[32:52] the students
[32:59] done what he did
[33:02] they had to be a blood sacrifice
[33:06] the song uh you must realize that the
[33:11] true seed of God
[33:13] Hallelujah
[33:34] [Music]
[33:46] because it is not us
[33:48] that is perfect it is a sacrifice
[33:53] that is perfect
[33:55] Hallelujah this is what made Enoch
[33:58] perfect he had a blood sacrifice
[34:03] it doesn't mean that he didn't make
[34:05] mistakes
[34:08] but for certain death has been only one
[34:12] man that has been perfect
[34:15] and that's Jesus Christ himself he's to
[34:18] remember and when John Amen in the Book
[34:21] of Revelation
[34:22] when he heard the word
[34:25] who is worthy to open the book
[34:29] and loose the seals
[34:32] the Bible said that there were none
[34:35] worthy
[34:36] Hallelujah not even Enoch it was not
[34:41] worthy but he had a worthy sacrifice I'm
[34:45] trying to get some nothing here tonight
[34:48] I want you to be free the devil do not
[34:52] want you to be free
[34:56] it's never been here
[34:59] even though we try to live right
[35:05] for them who knows to do good
[35:08] and do it tonight to them it is
[35:13] the prophet of God says
[35:16] we will make mistakes
[35:19] Hallelujah but you say I've got the Holy
[35:22] Ghost even with the Holy Ghost
[35:26] you make mistakes
[35:29] Hallelujah but we have a perfect lamb we
[35:33] have a perfect sacrifice
[35:35] and because we know who he is and what
[35:40] he is hallelujah we have been set free
[35:48] of the life of God through Jesus Christ
[35:53] Our Lord
[35:56] amen all right that's it
[35:59] Hallelujah because of the blood
[36:04] there is remission of sins
[36:07] because the Bible said without the blood
[36:10] there is no remission
[36:13] and the blood we are Justified
[36:16] as though we've never seen in the first
[36:19] place
[36:20] I'm not talking about a mental thing
[36:23] here I'm talking about people who know
[36:25] they've got the Holy Ghost
[36:28] Hallelujah when you receive the Holy
[36:31] Ghost
[36:31] when the Seal of the Holy Ghost is
[36:34] placed in your heart
[36:38] as though you've never seen in the first
[36:41] place
[36:43] because of the blood
[36:46] we have total salvation
[36:49] let me put it this way because of the
[36:52] life of the blood we have total
[36:55] salvation
[36:56] it is the life of the blood
[37:03] somebody
[37:27] [Music]
[37:39] because of this sacrifice according to
[37:42] sacrifice
[37:44] we can be translated
[38:46] he declared he was the
[38:50] and the Bible tells us according to John
[38:54] the first chapter
[38:56] that Jesus Christ he is
[39:02] Hallelujah
[39:11] [Music]
[39:22] and that same God is to remember is
[39:25] alive today
[39:27] by the blood sacrifice
[39:30] you see Enoch had a shadow he had a
[39:34] little lambs
[39:37] we've got the real Hallelujah
[39:45] [Music]
[39:52] [Music]
[40:19] thank you Lord hallelujah because of the
[40:23] Lamb of God
[40:24] or because of this lamb we have a new
[40:28] life
[40:30] Hallelujah did y'all think possible
[40:33] Enoch was born perfect
[40:36] no no he was born of a woman he was born
[40:40] in sin just like
[40:42] Hallelujah it doesn't say when God came
[40:46] to Enoch when and what time
[40:52] God called him
[40:55] Hallelujah now Enoch was by himself
[40:58] I don't know where Noah was what I can
[41:02] say is that Enoch was the only one in
[41:06] the whole world that was translated
[41:10] one man out of the entire world walk
[41:15] with God
[41:17] hallelujah what was it Hallelujah
[41:27] and it had to have been a revelation
[41:36] that was that that wasn't given to Noah
[41:39] Hallelujah no way even though they were
[41:42] in the same we would say the same age is
[41:45] that right because Enoch represents
[41:52] in a way represents the church the
[41:55] foolish virgins
[41:56] and we are coexisting right now
[42:00] Hallelujah but one of these old days
[42:04] because we have a revelation
[42:08] and we have a Revelations
[42:18] because he promised to do so Hallelujah
[42:22] [Applause]
[42:23] Hallelujah
[42:25] Hallelujah you love the Lord hallelujah
[42:31] and the Bible says he whom the son I
[42:35] love the scripture and set free it's
[42:38] free indeed and where the spirit of the
[42:41] Lord is there is Liberty
[42:44] Hallelujah remember I think it's um
[42:48] Romans the first chapter no I'm sorry
[42:51] it's Ephesians the first chapter
[42:54] all the Apostle says that he was called
[42:58] by God
[43:00] you understand me he wasn't called by a
[43:04] bishop he wasn't even called by a uh
[43:11] and because he was called by God that
[43:15] made him free from the political realm
[43:18] from all this politics
[43:21] from the power and authority of Life
[43:24] y'all better hear what I'm saying and
[43:27] the Bride of Jesus Christ she's called
[43:30] by God
[43:31] amen
[43:33] oh Jesus
[43:35] the reason why I'm preaching these
[43:37] messages
[43:40] is to
[43:42] Hallelujah
[43:47] [Music]
[43:51] as Christians I'm preaching these uh
[43:54] messages
[43:55] also to stimulate your faith
[43:59] to recognize
[44:01] we're living in an age
[44:04] and the spirits of this age is
[44:08] literally taking people away
[44:12] you must be aware of the spirit that is
[44:17] influencing you Hallelujah
[44:21] is that right okay see it was evil
[44:25] evil very evil in the days of Enoch it
[44:30] was very evil in the days
[44:40] how can I say it he was predestinated
[44:45] he was elected
[44:48] he was chosen
[44:51] to make a rapture
[44:54] and Noah was not in New England even
[44:57] though Noah was saying
[44:59] he did not have the Revelation that
[45:03] Enoch had
[45:06] no way
[45:07] heard the voice of God
[45:12] walked with God
[45:15] hallelujah that means
[45:19] do you have it foreign
[45:28] [Music]
[45:53] [Music]
[46:08] [Music]
[46:17] I'm talking about I'm talking about the
[46:20] same Holy Ghost about to remember
[46:22] because I want to share something with
[46:24] you
[46:26] Enoch Enoch had the ability to do
[46:29] something
[46:30] that had not yet been done
[46:33] since the fall of Man
[46:38] say where do you get this from I want
[46:40] you to think about it Adam had the mind
[46:43] of God
[46:47] and Enoch had the mind of God
[46:51] by Revelation
[46:53] Enoch knew exactly you know what God
[46:56] wanted what God required and brothers
[47:00] said everything God required him to do
[47:03] the foreign
[47:27] [Music]
[47:38] the Holy Ghost truth only sentence God
[47:41] is the Holy Ghost
[47:44] Hallelujah
[47:47] see we're here
[47:49] because we often preach about Noah
[47:53] but we never hardly ever hear about
[47:55] Enoch news
[47:59] he's in the message
[48:01] doesn't say much about him but if you
[48:04] search the quotes if you search the
[48:07] scriptures to find out he says some good
[48:10] things about it
[48:13] and then we find out that Enoch Amen in
[48:17] the book of Jude
[48:19] began to say things
[48:22] that no other ones could say
[48:25] he began to talk about the destruction
[48:29] he talks about the the church
[48:32] that would have two kinds of Believers
[48:36] he also talk about those who are
[48:38] ordained to be vessels of Dishonor and
[48:43] those who are vessels of Honor
[48:45] Hallelujah and he began to
[49:36] [Music]
[49:44] and anybody couldn't go back
[50:00] [Music]
[50:05] [Music]
[50:18] [Music]
[50:19] Hallelujah he became my nakedness that I
[50:24] might be clothed with his righteousness
[50:26] Hallelujah
[50:35] [Music]
[50:48] [Music]
[50:55] but you see the most important thing is
[50:58] important that you and I must come to
[51:01] understand
[51:03] is a revelation
[51:06] of our Perfection do not perfection
[51:09] and that's
[51:10] that's true right
[51:12] because we realize our Perfection is not
[51:16] by works
[51:22] even though let me see we try our best
[51:27] to live the way he wants us to live
[51:31] you can't even do it because the Bible
[51:35] says
[51:36] our righteousness is as filthy rice
[51:42] see when you come to see it's just
[51:46] sacrifice
[51:47] it's a blood sacrifice
[51:50] that God recognizes when I see the blood
[51:56] pass over you not when I see your works
[52:00] not when I see your Deeds not when I see
[52:03] what church you go to is when I see the
[52:07] blood I will pass over you Hallelujah
[52:30] [Music]
[52:33] when you know you mess up every day
[52:38] Hallelujah
[52:43] [Music]
[52:52] [Music]
[53:06] his holiness
[53:10] [Music]
[53:12] I get stirred I'm sorry
[53:15] [Laughter]
[53:17] his Holiness is my Holiness
[53:23] for I am Holy the prophet God said there
[53:27] is no way
[53:30] without the Holy Ghost
[53:32] that's why the devil don't want people
[53:36] to get the Holy Ghost
[53:38] he don't care if you're sanctified
[53:44] you but when you see that shine
[53:48] [Music]
[53:49] wherever you may be when you get serious
[53:53] with God I was going to try everything
[53:58] [Music]
[53:59] but I'm here to tell you nothing can
[54:03] stop this
[54:04] Hallelujah you've been predestinated
[54:07] you've been ordained together
[54:12] and even brother Branham said God want
[54:15] to give it to you more than you wanted
[54:20] but listen
[54:23] listen
[54:33] the devil don't want you to know you're
[54:35] free
[54:37] so many people
[54:40] you're afraid
[54:43] Hallelujah why are you afraid if God
[54:47] called you
[54:48] and you answered
[54:51] he predestinated
[54:56] you didn't come to God I came to you you
[55:01] didn't choose God
[55:05] amen hallelujah we don't have to fear
[55:09] the devil is that all right
[55:12] how do you say it
[55:17] I said like he says no matter what
[55:21] God will
[55:23] make it happen
[55:25] that's not exactly the way he said it
[55:27] respect at the moment but basically he
[55:29] was saying nothing can hinder the plan
[55:33] of God
[55:44] hallelujah
[55:45] oh Jesus yes we want to be holy we want
[55:50] to be like him that's what our thirst is
[55:55] but think about it he gave you the
[55:57] things
[56:00] Hallelujah
[56:02] yes sir
[56:05] oh my God
[56:07] see the Bible tells us we were we were
[56:10] in him
[56:11] and we we are still in snooze
[56:16] the Bible said as he is
[56:40] God never sees it
[56:43] hallelujah amen amen that's it amen amen
[56:47] what are you talking about
[56:49] you can't be Sanctified it's
[56:52] unsanctified at the same time
[56:56] you can't be holy
[56:59] at the same time y'all understand me
[57:02] what do you think the blood is all about
[57:07] yeah
[57:10] you may have what you might wipe it off
[57:13] Hallelujah
[57:16] he didn't put it where it could be
[57:18] spoiled he put it in a place
[57:34] but what we fail to see
[57:37] Having the Holy Ghost is not just
[57:39] shouting and dancing I've already sent
[57:41] this episode all those things
[57:44] but God gave you the Holy Ghost Jesus to
[57:48] resist the devil's thoughts
[57:53] God gave you the Holy Ghost
[57:56] to resist the devil's thoughts and I'm
[58:01] gonna explain this to you because when
[58:04] Adam and Eve
[58:07] the words of the serpent
[58:11] the serpent became their headship
[58:17] Adam lost his headship
[58:24] is that right
[58:26] and even though God remembers
[58:30] talk to Adam
[58:32] now Adam even though I know
[58:37] that was contrary to the world
[58:42] and everybody after that
[58:44] y'all hear what I'm saying you say well
[58:47] what are you I got scripture for this
[58:48] the Bible said who knew you
[58:51] almost to obey this is
[58:55] and if you hear your members to The
[58:59] Devils
[59:04] that's right
[59:05] Hallelujah
[59:08] foreign
[59:34] for sin shall not have dominion over you
[59:38] 14th verse I'm sorry
[59:41] Romans 6 14. romances
[59:46] for ye are not under the law but on the
[59:49] grace
[59:53] shall we sing because we are not under
[59:57] the law
[59:59] put on the grace God forbids
[1:00:04] your serves
[1:00:10] [Music]
[1:00:12] weather of sin unto death
[1:00:17] unto righteousness
[1:00:21] you have a choice even with the Holy
[1:00:25] ghosts
[1:00:30] into where you are you have to go out
[1:00:35] he can't come in he came under the blood
[1:00:39] he becomes a brother Michael
[1:00:49] yeah
[1:00:51] to hear his temptation
[1:00:54] so let me show you what I'm saying
[1:00:59] but the battle said it like this
[1:01:02] he said Moses problem
[1:01:05] or his weakness
[1:01:08] was his temper today
[1:01:11] they got him in the temple
[1:01:15] police
[1:01:22] he said but Jesus
[1:01:24] his weakness was Hunger
[1:01:29] he like to eat
[1:01:32] as a man he like to eat so the devil
[1:01:37] thought he was going to try him with the
[1:01:39] bread
[1:01:40] you see the stone
[1:01:42] turn the stone into bread
[1:01:48] and the devil waited till he got weak he
[1:01:54] was hungry in February and then the
[1:01:58] devil came to tempt him
[1:02:00] Hallelujah but he was Unbreakable
[1:02:03] [Music]
[1:02:06] yeah
[1:02:07] [Music]
[1:02:40] [Music]
[1:03:05] the devil amen

[1:03:52] church they got away exactly discrimity
[1:03:54] from the name of Jesus Hallelujah
[1:03:58] you got to go back to that name is that
[1:04:02] right is it right brother Adam said it
[1:04:04] he told us that he was like he said he
[1:04:06] was among some witches
[1:04:08] and he said that the the the medium
[1:04:11] whatever she was
[1:04:13] she had these chairs
[1:04:24] and there were men trying to pull the
[1:04:26] chairs
[1:04:29] and this witch challenged him
[1:04:33] Hallelujah said I heard you got power
[1:04:36] and that you can bring these things down
[1:04:39] he said no I don't have no power
[1:04:42] Hallelujah but my power is in the name
[1:04:45] of Jesus Christ
[1:04:46] I'm paraphrasing it he said in the name
[1:05:14] [Music]
[1:05:20] let this mind be in you that's cool
[1:05:24] thank you
[1:05:26] the blood still prevails
[1:05:31] Hallelujah
[1:05:33] you love the Lord hallelujah
[1:05:36] see our Perfection
[1:05:39] and what does God do with preparing us
[1:05:43] learning by the power and the authority
[1:05:46] of the Holy ghosts
[1:05:54] but the only way you can know his
[1:05:56] thoughts you got to study his words
[1:06:00] you got to study his word you gotta
[1:06:04] listen to the tapes you gotta understand
[1:06:06] God put you in this place

[1:20:24] Hallelujah you and how we just didn't
[1:20:28] become Christians
[1:20:31] we just didn't know it is
[1:20:35] [Music]
[1:20:46] but that little bit of God of God it's a
[1:20:49] whole lot of God y'all hear what I'm
[1:20:52] saying
[1:20:53] absolutely absolutely and we constantly
[1:20:56] looking at our flesh
[1:20:58] well let me say it like this if you're
[1:21:02] waiting for your flesh to be converted
[1:21:07] it'll never happen
[1:21:09] your flesh cannot be converted your
[1:21:14] flesh has been condemned
[1:21:16] and God got it attached to you
[1:21:19] to train you before for me
[1:21:24] Hallelujah that's your trainer you is
[1:21:27] that part of you God uses to train you
[1:21:32] with it
[1:21:33] for me Hallelujah but one what but what
[1:21:37] the devil don't understand
[1:21:39] and I'm getting ready to close that
[1:21:41] power of the holy spirit
[1:21:43] that Christ in US is maturing is
[1:21:48] beginning to see who he he is
[1:21:53] and her love and his love it's becoming
[1:21:57] more and greater for God in God's word
[1:22:02] we're in a place right now we're trying
[1:22:06] to drop all of the foolishness
[1:22:09] Hallelujah is that right right it's kind
[1:22:12] of like what God Said to job
[1:22:14] the job had gone through all these
[1:22:16] things
[1:22:20] girdle thyself like a man
[1:22:24] and give me an answer
[1:22:29] he said where were you
[1:22:33] he said I demand an answer
[1:22:36] where was thou oh it's the truth when I
[1:22:39] laid the foundation of the earth
[1:22:43] declare dealer if thou has understanding
[1:22:48] Hallelujah job couldn't answer the
[1:22:51] questions
[1:22:52] but God in this last day
[1:22:56] answer the question
[1:23:00] I can truly say
[1:23:02] he was with you
[1:23:04] when the sons and gods began to shouts
[1:23:08] [Music]
[1:23:12] also
[1:23:14] Hallelujah when I saw that my sin death
[1:23:19] had been paid I was one of them one of
[1:23:23] the redeemed Hallelujah that's why Joe
[1:23:26] says
[1:23:27] hallelujah though the skin worms yeah
[1:23:44] hey
[1:23:46] Hallelujah
[1:23:48] under the inspiration certain
[1:23:51] inspiration of perfection
[1:23:54] that's where we are
[1:23:56] in this message
[1:23:58] you are under the inspiration
[1:24:02] of perfection
[1:24:04] Hallelujah because the Holy Ghost is the
[1:24:09] only way you will be perfected
[1:24:13] I'm not done with this subjects
[1:24:21] Hallelujah Jesus
[1:24:28] the devil don't like it
[1:24:30] because there's a group of people who
[1:24:34] are now beginning to see
[1:24:36] exactly who they are it's like the
[1:24:38] monkey song so now they're not going to
[1:24:40] be worried
[1:24:42] about their mistakes
[1:24:45] you know because God is already declared
[1:24:48] you're righteous
[1:24:50] he knows that when we make mistakes he's
[1:24:53] sickness we're going to make it right
[1:24:56] he counted as though we've never done it
[1:24:58] in the first place
[1:25:01] God is Not hoping that you love him
[1:25:05] God knows that you love him because he
[1:25:08] put his love in you you can't love God
[1:25:11] the way he wants
[1:25:12] [Music]
[1:25:18] that's exactly right you can't even have
[1:25:22] the Faith remember what God wants you to
[1:25:24] have and let God push the faith in you
[1:25:28] one thing you must know today
[1:25:31] [Music]
[1:25:36] I'm a stranger
[1:25:38] this is not my home this is
[1:25:41] hallelujah can I read one more quote
[1:25:44] while you're standing and I'm Gonna Let

[1:25:55] came across it
[1:25:57] so I want you to understand the season
[1:26:01] we're in and things in the Unseen that
[1:26:04] you need to see and understand

[1:26:55] Christ
[1:26:56] the Churches of Christ of America
[1:26:59] yeah the Churches of Christ of America
[1:27:01] is
[1:27:03] already confederating with all their
[1:27:06] churches
[1:27:12] and they're going to have a ban here
[1:27:15] someday
[1:27:19] they have a shout out to fight communism
[1:27:25] and this is what America is working with
[1:27:28] now it's a school we've finally got
[1:27:30] communism
[1:27:33] which will hook up
[1:27:37] with Catholicism
[1:27:40] with the Protestant church
[1:27:43] and the Catholic church together
[1:27:47] and the inter-denominations
[1:27:50] who stand out for the truth
[1:27:53] and get away from the dormant that they
[1:27:55] got
[1:28:05] The Showdown will soon come report

[1:28:49] the people will jump into it
[1:28:53] they'll Confederate the churches
[1:28:56] and bring and try to make Christianity
[1:29:00] one unit I mean
[1:29:02] and the Bible says in Revelation that

[1:29:21] time to hook Revelation into the things

[1:29:36] and maybe the people couldn't see what
[1:29:39] he was talking about in 53.
[1:29:42] but right now
[1:29:44] Spirit of the world
