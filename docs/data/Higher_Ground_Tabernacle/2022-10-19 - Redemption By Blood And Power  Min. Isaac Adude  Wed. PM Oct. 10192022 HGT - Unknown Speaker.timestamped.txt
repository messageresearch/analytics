[21:42] amen we're so happy to be here and uh
[21:47] let's open our bubbles in the book of
[21:50] Exodus
[21:58] man standing open our bubbles in the
[22:00] book of Exodus we read the chapter 12.
[22:04] and verse 11 to verse 13.
[22:13] Exodus chapter 12 verse 11 to verse 13.
[22:21] amen the Bible says and thus shall ye
[22:24] eat it with your loins girded and your
[22:27] shoes and your feet and your staff in
[22:30] your hand and you shall eat it in haste
[22:32] it is the Lord's Passover
[22:35] for I will not for it I will pass
[22:39] through the land of Egypt this night and
[22:42] was Milo the first born in the land of
[22:44] Egypt both men and Beast and against all
[22:47] the gods of Egypt I will execute
[22:49] judgment I am the Lord
[22:51] and the blood shall be to you for a
[22:54] token upon the houses where you are and
[22:57] when I see the blood I will pass over
[22:59] you and the plague shall not be upon you
[23:02] to destroy you when I smite the land of
[23:05] Egypt
[23:06] anyway let's go to Hebrews
[23:09] read chapter chapter 9 verse 11 to verse
[23:13] 15.
[23:20] Hebrews chapter 9 verse 11 to verse 15.
[23:29] the Bible says
[23:31] but Christ being by cross being come and
[23:35] high priest of good things to come
[23:38] by greater and more perfect Tabernacle
[23:41] not made with hands that is to say not
[23:45] of this building
[23:48] neither by the blood of goats and calls
[23:51] but by his own blood he entered in he
[23:55] entered in once into the holy Place
[23:57] having obtained Eternal Redemption for
[24:00] us amen I just love how the Bible says
[24:02] that
[24:03] Eternal Redemption I mean it's not
[24:05] something that that has a time limit to
[24:07] it amen when you're redeemed it's
[24:09] Eternal you're not going back to to sin
[24:12] amen for if the blood of bulls and goats
[24:17] and the ashes of heifer
[24:19] sprinting the unclean sanctifiers
[24:23] to the purifying of the flesh how much
[24:26] more shall the blood of Christ who
[24:28] through eternal spirit offered himself
[24:31] without spot to God
[24:34] Purge your conscience from dead Works to
[24:37] serve the Living God
[24:39] and for this cause he is the mediator of
[24:43] the new testament which also means the
[24:46] New Covenant which is the grace the
[24:48] Covenant of Grace that
[24:51] that by by means uh uh I'm sorry and for
[24:55] this cause he's the mediator of the New
[24:58] Testament that
[25:00] by means of death for the Redemption of
[25:04] the transgressions that were under the
[25:07] first testament
[25:08] they which are called might receive the
[25:11] promise of Eternal inheritance
[25:13] amen that's bald heads
[25:15] the heavenly father Lord we just read
[25:18] your word father God we ask you Lord to
[25:20] be with us Lord this night
[25:23] Lord Jesus we pray father God that you
[25:25] come and you open this word to us Lord
[25:27] Lord we pray father God that you come
[25:29] and you teach us your word O Lord that
[25:31] you explain it to us Lord and you reveal
[25:33] it to us Lord Lord and let it be a
[25:36] blessing father God for everybody in
[25:37] here father God and those who will those
[25:39] who are listening father God on YouTube
[25:42] and those who will listen to it
[25:43] afterward though we pray father Lord
[25:45] that you continue to be with us Lord you
[25:48] helped me Father God to be so sensitive
[25:50] to the Holy Spirit father God that I can
[25:52] say exactly what you want me to say
[25:54] father Lord we pray that Lord your
[25:56] spirit be with us Lord in Jesus Christ
[25:58] name we pray amen
[26:00] amen
[26:04] I mean you might be seated
[26:06] and when this uh
[26:09] evening we have a little subject that we
[26:12] wanted to share with you
[26:17] that we entirely Redemption by Blood and
[26:20] by power
[26:22] amen I will try to do a little bible
[26:25] study this evening so I'll pray that you
[26:27] bear with me because I will read a lot
[26:30] and amen uh a lot of you know Bible
[26:32] verses and quotes of the prophet and
[26:35] just try to explain you know a little
[26:38] part or a partial party of redemption
[26:41] because Redemption it's a it's a really
[26:43] huge subject and uh and it's hard to
[26:45] explain it all and I'm pretty sure that
[26:47] it's impossible to explain it all amen
[26:50] we can just uh take a little and you
[26:52] know an angle and then just try to uh to
[26:55] go with it amen well try this uh this
[26:58] evening to speak about Redemption by
[27:00] Blood and by power
[27:02] I meant because uh where we read in
[27:06] Exodus chapter 12 in in Hebrews chapter
[27:09] I'm sorry Exodus chapter 12 we
[27:11] understand that there is something that
[27:14] uh that really when I read it uh
[27:17] it kind of Hit me hard because you will
[27:20] see that when God told the children of
[27:22] Israel to apply the blood amen he told
[27:25] them to apply the blood and when he will
[27:27] see the blood amen it's the blood that
[27:30] you have to apply the token and that
[27:33] token has to be seen from the outside
[27:35] amen God wasn't gonna go inside the
[27:37] house to check if the blood was applied
[27:39] amen but he wanted to see the blood from
[27:42] the outside when he will see it from the
[27:45] outside then he will go through amen he
[27:47] will pass over amen it's the same thing
[27:49] with rehab amen one day the children of
[27:51] Israel told her to you know to uh
[27:55] uh to put that sign that token I think
[27:58] it was a a Scarlet thread it meant in
[28:01] the window amen so that from the outside
[28:03] they could see it that this this house
[28:06] can't be touched I mean it's it's a
[28:08] token it's something that has to be
[28:10] applied it meant people has to be these
[28:13] people has to see it from you know from
[28:15] the outside so by definition we know
[28:17] that Redemption means the action of
[28:20] regaining possession of something in
[28:23] exchange for payments or clearing the
[28:26] debt amen you have to regain something
[28:28] that you have lost
[28:31] amen it's just it's just it's like a a
[28:34] lost and found section amen you have to
[28:37] found something that you had before amen
[28:39] you have to redeem something that you
[28:41] had before so amen so you have you had
[28:43] to have that thing before Amen in order
[28:46] for you to read it to be able to redeem
[28:48] it because when you are redeemed amen
[28:50] it's not something new you're not
[28:51] getting something new remember you're
[28:54] just getting something that you lost
[28:55] before amen so the Bible teaches us
[28:58] different types of redemption amen
[29:01] throughout the Bible you have one
[29:03] um that I think it's called the sabbatic
[29:05] year which means that the children of
[29:07] Israel had to sow for six years in a row
[29:10] and and then they had to rest for the
[29:12] seventh year I mean on the seventh year
[29:15] they were not supposed to sow any seed
[29:18] amen because uh uh the land had to be
[29:21] redeemed I mean the land had to rest uh
[29:24] go through that part of redemption I
[29:25] forgot the the actual word of it uh
[29:29] where the land had to go uh uh rest and
[29:32] be redeemed so that the land can recover
[29:35] from all the the the chemical uh
[29:38] nutritions that he had lost throughout
[29:40] those six years and and the Bible says
[29:43] that you know in that sixth year it
[29:45] might because God told them not to sow
[29:47] or not to do not to work on the seventh
[29:50] day on the seventh year amen God was
[29:52] blessing them for three years in a row
[29:55] amen they had to have food for the sixth
[29:57] year for the seventh year and for the
[29:59] eighth year which is the first year amen
[30:02] and God had to supply to their needs and
[30:05] by the second one there's a uh the Year
[30:08] of Jubilee which is the 50th year of it
[30:12] which is the fifth year year which is uh
[30:15] uh after seven Sabbath a Sabbath has
[30:18] seven a Sabbath which means it's seven
[30:20] so seven times seven that's 40 49 so the
[30:23] next year the following year it meant
[30:25] it'll be the Year of Jubilee because 50
[30:28] is Jubilee
[30:29] and then they had the Redemption of The
[30:32] Inheritance like for example if your
[30:35] brother uh uh becomes poor and he sells
[30:38] a property
[30:39] one of his skin one of his skin had to
[30:42] had the opportunity or had your ability
[30:44] the ability to redeem whatever he saw if
[30:47] he wanted it back and then there is the
[30:49] Redemption of the poor brother like also
[30:53] if he becomes poor and then he sells
[30:55] himself instead of his property so
[30:57] someone else or his brother could had
[31:00] the ability to go and and and and redeem
[31:02] him back the Bible also talks about the
[31:05] Redemption by power which is the
[31:06] Redemption that we will be talking about
[31:08] uh uh very soon and the Redemption by
[31:11] Blood
[31:12] so but the common thing about all those
[31:15] types of redemption is that a payment is
[31:18] due even some sort of a sacrifice is
[31:21] needed amen you had you you had either
[31:24] to work for your Liberty or you had to
[31:27] pay we had you had to pay for it amen
[31:30] but to redeem us
[31:32] the the Bible required that a blood you
[31:35] know the the sharing of the blood was
[31:37] required to redeem us because death life
[31:42] is the only thing that can overcome
[31:45] death amen you can only overcome death
[31:48] by life I mean there is no any
[31:50] substitute that can overcome death it's
[31:52] like for example uh you see the children
[31:55] of Israel
[31:56] when they were in uh uh uh Egypt you see
[32:00] that God that they were under a covenant
[32:04] of of the circumcision the one God told
[32:06] Abraham that you have to circumcise your
[32:09] children and and everybody you know
[32:12] after you
[32:13] you'll see that when God was sending
[32:15] plagues to Egypt
[32:17] the Covenant of circumcision was saving
[32:20] them from those plagues amen because
[32:22] they were in gulsion the first nine
[32:24] plagues the plagues that God sent them
[32:26] amen they were able to to be kept safe
[32:29] because they were under that that that
[32:31] that low or under that a covenant of
[32:34] circumcision but when he came but when
[32:37] it was about life and death it meant
[32:40] that circumcision amen didn't mean
[32:42] anything it meant something higher than
[32:44] that was required amen the tenth plague
[32:47] which was death that God said that I
[32:49] will kill all the firstborn Amen in that
[32:52] time it meant being circumcised didn't
[32:54] matter anymore amen you had to do
[32:57] exactly what God told Moses that these
[33:00] children of Israel had to do amen you
[33:02] will see that he gave them uh uh
[33:06] it gave them restrictions like steps
[33:09] that they had to follow
[33:10] you find it in Exodus chapter 12 I mean
[33:13] it's a long chapter so I'm not going to
[33:15] read it uh the first thing that they had
[33:18] to do was to take a lamp they had to
[33:19] find the lamb
[33:21] it meant the second thing they had to
[33:23] check if that lamb met all the
[33:25] requirements in my meaning that they had
[33:28] to check if the lamb had uh if the lamb
[33:30] was hurt or if the lamb had uh uh some
[33:33] skin colors or things like that it might
[33:36] because that limb had to be perfect amen
[33:39] and then they had to keep that lamb for
[33:41] I'm pretty sure for four days and and
[33:44] test that lamb Amen to make sure that
[33:47] this lamb is the perfect lamp that is
[33:49] supposed to go uh for uh that is
[33:52] supposed to be killed and then after
[33:54] that they had to kill the lamb
[33:56] and when they were killing the lamb amen
[33:59] God told them that no born should be
[34:01] broken when the lamb was supposed when
[34:03] the lamb was killed and then after that
[34:05] they had to apply the blood on the
[34:08] lentil they had to apply the blood and
[34:11] stay in the house amen they had to apply
[34:15] the blood on the outside but stay inside
[34:17] of the house that the blind that the
[34:19] blood has been applied amen they had to
[34:22] roast up Lamb with fire
[34:24] amen and then they had to eat the Flesh
[34:27] and and then take the leaven out so the
[34:30] prophet says here that uh uh
[34:34] that people are trying to eat the word
[34:36] of God and they take it like it was
[34:39] wrong they chew on it the speed on it
[34:42] and everything else
[34:44] they say oh I just can't take it I I
[34:48] can't stand it it isn't cooked done
[34:51] enough that's all he said cook it with
[34:54] fire fire represent the Holy Ghost so
[34:57] you get God in your heart first and
[35:01] it'll cook it for you that's right
[35:03] cooked it out done season then test that
[35:07] then it'll taste good
[35:09] now you can't stand off like this
[35:11] outside and say oh I don't know whether
[35:14] it's for me or not that might be for
[35:17] days gone by just get the Holy Spirit
[35:20] first and watch what Divine Healing
[35:22] means to you then look what a heartfelt
[35:26] religion means to you then when you've
[35:28] got the Holy Spirit here to cook the
[35:31] lamb as it comes amen that's right cook
[35:35] the lamb first cook the lamb first and
[35:38] you have to have fire to cook it
[35:41] with it should be roasted yeah amen then
[35:45] when they had to eat it and when God
[35:47] told them to eat it with the shoes on
[35:49] their feet amen they had to have you
[35:51] know they had to be dressed like people
[35:53] who are ready to walk amen because after
[35:55] eating the lamb it meant it wasn't
[35:58] Exodus that was coming amen they had to
[36:00] leave that land to go into the promised
[36:02] land so they were eating that lamb Amen
[36:05] in haste amen because they were getting
[36:07] ready to walk amen amen and the Bible
[36:10] tells us that Jesus Christ was that lamb
[36:13] amen amen Jesus Christ represented that
[36:16] lamb that lamb represented Jesus Christ
[36:18] amen you will see that Exodus 12 chapter
[36:20] 1 and and 28 it meant all about all
[36:24] those things amen talks about Jesus
[36:26] Christ amen how Jesus Christ had to die
[36:28] how Jesus Christ had to be captured how
[36:30] Jesus crossed a man after his death no
[36:33] born a man could have been broken and
[36:35] and all these things you would find out
[36:37] that in in John chapter 1 verse 29
[36:41] amen Jesus says that he's the lamb the
[36:43] man the Bible says that the next day
[36:45] John seeth Jesus coming unto him and
[36:47] saith Behold the Lamb of God which
[36:50] taketh away the sin of the world Amen
[36:53] that that lamb Amen in Exodus That was
[36:55] supposed to die for the children of
[36:57] Israel amen Jesus Christ in the New
[36:59] Testament amen is the lamb who's
[37:01] supposed to die for the sin of the world
[37:03] Amen in this time amen is not only dying
[37:06] for the firstborn amen but he's dying
[37:08] amen for the human race amen for the
[37:10] people a man who was in him before the
[37:13] foundation of the world Amen because the
[37:15] Bible says they are even before the
[37:16] Redemption amen you have first to be in
[37:19] God Amen God had to foreknown God Amen
[37:22] the Bible said that those that He
[37:24] foreknew amen he also Sanctified amen
[37:28] before that you have he had to know you
[37:30] first amen so Jesus Christ is that lamb
[37:33] and First Corinthians Chapter 5 Verse 6
[37:35] to 8 amen the Bible says that Your Glory
[37:38] that Christ is our Passover amen the
[37:41] Bible says that your glory is not good
[37:44] know ye not that a little living
[37:46] levelness the whole lump
[37:49] amen Purge out therefore therefore the
[37:51] holy the old living that he may be a new
[37:54] lump as you are unleavened for even
[37:57] Christ Apostle very Sanctified for us
[37:59] therefore let us keep the feast now with
[38:03] old leaven neither with the leaven of
[38:06] malice and weakness but with the
[38:09] unleavened breath of sincerity and Truth
[38:12] amen Deliverance remain represents sin
[38:15] amen that's why you will see that after
[38:17] the Passover amen God told them that God
[38:20] told the children of Israel to keep the
[38:22] leaven out of their house he says here
[38:24] that seven this shall be shall there be
[38:26] in Exodus chapter 12 verse 19. seven
[38:29] days shall there be no leaven found in
[38:33] your houses amen for seven days it meant
[38:36] no leaven shall be found in your houses
[38:38] amen and the prophet tells us that those
[38:40] seven days represent the seven Church
[38:42] ages amen throughout the church ages it
[38:45] meant no leaven that means a note sin
[38:47] amen shall be found in our houses amen
[38:50] witches our hearts amen we have to be
[38:52] pure you know serve God in sincerity and
[38:55] Truth amen Jeremiah
[38:58] uh uh oh I'm jumping here Jeremiah
[39:02] chapter chapter 29 verse 10 to 14.
[39:05] amen the Bible talking about sincerity
[39:07] and Truth the Bible says that for thus
[39:10] saith the Lord that after seven years be
[39:13] accomplished at Babylon I will visit you
[39:16] and perform my good word towards you in
[39:20] causing you to return to this place
[39:22] for I know the thoughts that I think
[39:25] toward you saith the Lord thought of
[39:28] peace and not of evil to give you an
[39:31] expected end then shall ye call upon me
[39:34] and you shall go and pray unto me and I
[39:37] will hearken unto you and you shall seek
[39:40] me and find me when you shall search for
[39:44] me with all your heart Amen in other
[39:46] words that when you will see when you
[39:48] will search for me in sincerity and
[39:50] Truth amen because that is the only way
[39:53] to search God with all your hearts amen
[39:55] it's when your heart is sincere amen
[39:57] when your heart is sincere and Truth
[39:59] there is no any distraction there is no
[40:02] bitterness there is no Envy there's
[40:04] nothing else that can block you from it
[40:06] amen that's when you search God from all
[40:08] your heart and then when you do that the
[40:11] Bible says in verse 14 that I will be
[40:13] found of you saith the Lord and I will
[40:16] turn away your captivity and I will
[40:19] gather you from the Nations and from all
[40:22] the places where that I have driven you
[40:24] saith the Lord and I will bring you amen
[40:27] and I will bring you again into the
[40:29] place when I cause you uh to be carried
[40:33] away from
[40:35] amen daddy oh that is only when you
[40:37] search God in sincerity and Truth amen
[40:40] when in your heart there is nothing else
[40:42] but just that desire Amen to serve God
[40:46] just that desire Amen to to look for him
[40:49] and to serve that is when God will uh
[40:51] come and uh be found to him amen the
[40:55] Bible now what is the token that the
[40:57] Bible has been talking about what is the
[40:59] token amen the token is the proof
[41:02] that you have completely obeyed amen
[41:06] that is the token remember that God gave
[41:08] them those things to do in Exodus 12.
[41:11] amen gave them the thing that they had
[41:13] to respect amen they had to obey
[41:15] everything that God Said Amen in order
[41:18] for that blood Amen in order for them to
[41:21] apply the blood amen it wasn't that the
[41:23] prophet said that some some of them
[41:24] could come to Moses and say well Moses
[41:26] amen Moses uh um um
[41:29] I'm in the Trump from the tribe of Levi
[41:32] and I've been circumcised and no need to
[41:35] apply the blood and no need to apply the
[41:37] blood because I have the circumcision
[41:38] amen Moses we tell them well that
[41:41] circumcision was able to save you for
[41:43] the nine plagues but this one is
[41:45] different amen this one is the battle
[41:47] between life and death amen this one is
[41:49] the battle between amen Lo and Grace
[41:52] amen you have to I mean the blood has to
[41:54] be there you have to be identified amen
[41:57] with by their blood I mean you have to
[41:59] be identified by the blame amen that
[42:01] blood amen some of them could come and
[42:03] Moses I have the I have the token inside
[42:06] of me Moses I don't need to apply it
[42:08] Moses will tell them well I need to see
[42:10] that token from the outside amen because
[42:12] God Amen that dear future when that
[42:14] death angel will come amen he will not
[42:16] be searching amen for that token inside
[42:19] of you it won't be searching for it it
[42:22] means a lot of people are trying to find
[42:23] diamonds or something like that I mean
[42:25] he has to be something that is easy to
[42:27] find a man from afar him and he was will
[42:30] see that this house can't be touched
[42:31] amen because the blood is being applied
[42:34] amen that is the kind of token that God
[42:36] is asking for I mean it's not like
[42:38] you're saying well brother I have the
[42:40] Holy Spirit brother have been baptized
[42:41] and all of that but where are the
[42:43] actions amen because the holy spirit
[42:44] amen is not something that is supposed
[42:47] to be just inside of you that people
[42:49] have really to open your heart and
[42:52] search your soul to find it amen but you
[42:54] have to prove you have to manifest the
[42:57] actions amen of that holy spirit amen
[42:59] it's like you see a tree I mean you call
[43:01] it the mango tree but where are the
[43:03] fruits amen people have to test the
[43:05] fruit it may eat the fruit of that tree
[43:07] amen and then they will know that it's a
[43:09] mango tree because they tasted amen it's
[43:12] the same thing with the holy spirit amen
[43:14] you have to see it amen why was the
[43:17] blood required amen because life is the
[43:20] only thing that can overcome in my death
[43:23] in my life is the only thing that's why
[43:25] Jesus understanding that life is the
[43:27] only thing that can overcome death amen
[43:29] couldn't send any Angel to come to for
[43:31] our Redemption amen he had to come down
[43:34] himself Amen to die for us and he had to
[43:37] come down himself he meant to take our
[43:39] places amen the Bible says that he
[43:41] became sin amen though he wasn't a
[43:43] sinner amen but he became sin amen he
[43:46] took our place amen it was an exchange
[43:48] amen and he died for us I mean it was an
[43:52] identification of that lamb to that lamb
[43:55] amen you have to identify yourself amen
[43:58] and now in this last age amen Jesus
[44:00] Christ the Lamb of God Amen died for us
[44:02] so now we have to identify ourselves to
[44:05] him by the word amen we have to have a
[44:08] complete obedience amen that's why I'm
[44:10] pretty sure Samuel who said to sow that
[44:13] obedience is more than sacrificed I mean
[44:16] it doesn't matter how many sacrifices
[44:18] you have done I mean it doesn't matter
[44:19] amen how many times you have preached
[44:21] and how many times you have sinned for
[44:23] God not many times you have done many
[44:25] sacrifices but where is your obedience
[44:28] amen so where is The Obedience it
[44:30] doesn't matter amen if you did 95 of the
[44:33] job but if God required you to do
[44:35] exactly what he said
[44:37] and when that's when you will have the
[44:39] token it may that's when you will have
[44:41] that token amen First Peter chapter 1
[44:44] verse 18 to 19.
[44:48] amen you will see that Jesus was that
[44:50] lamb without spot and blamers
[44:53] for as much
[44:55] as you know the
[44:57] you were not redeemed with corruptable
[44:59] things
[45:00] as silver and gold
[45:03] from your vain conversation received by
[45:05] tradition from your fathers
[45:08] but with the precious blood of Christ as
[45:12] a lamp without blemish and without spot
[45:15] amen Luke chapter 11 verse 53-54
[45:19] I mean the Bible says there and as you
[45:22] say and has and and as he said these
[45:26] things unto them the scrubs and the
[45:28] Pharisees begin to urge him
[45:31] uh uh I don't know how to pronounce this
[45:34] word uh
[45:36] vehemently is that right
[45:38] vehemently and to provoke him to speak
[45:42] of many things laying wait wait for him
[45:46] and seeking to cut something out of his
[45:49] mouth that they might accuse him and
[45:52] when that land was supposed to be
[45:54] without without blemish
[45:57] and then so they decepted the Pharisees
[45:59] amen they kind of was laying traps even
[46:02] when they were uh uh uh uh talking to
[46:05] Jesus amen they were saying things that
[46:07] so that when Jesus reaction will be like
[46:10] something that they will go and tell the
[46:12] public because he said this that's why
[46:14] we crucified him amen by the Bible says
[46:17] that amen is if Jesus was crucified not
[46:19] because why not because he's sinned amen
[46:22] Jesus was crucified not because he done
[46:24] something wrong amen but Jesus was
[46:26] crucified because of love the love that
[46:28] he had for us amen God wanted us to be
[46:32] with him amen God wanted us he meant to
[46:34] to be with him like the Bible says in
[46:36] Genesis I'm pretty sure chapter 12 that
[46:38] this plane of redemption that I started
[46:40] I'm not gonna arrest until I have done
[46:43] amen everything that I said I mean until
[46:46] I have fulfilled it amen that's why
[46:48] Jesus died for us amen it wasn't because
[46:50] he he stole something or you know he bit
[46:53] somebody or or he hurt somebody or he
[46:56] did something wrong wrong amen but Jesus
[46:58] died because of us because of you and me
[47:01] amen that's why Jesus Jesus died
[47:03] remember John chapter
[47:05] John chapter 18 verse 38 the Bible said
[47:08] that pilate saith unto him what is truth
[47:13] and when he had said this he went now
[47:16] that he went out unto the Jews and said
[47:19] unto them I find in him no fault at all
[47:23] it meant nothing had to be found in that
[47:25] lamb amen that lamb had to be a perfect
[47:28] image amen no mistakes no nothing I mean
[47:31] he has to be perfect amen and pilate
[47:34] pilate bear that testimony saying that I
[47:37] found I find in him no fault at all amen
[47:40] that means that there is nothing that I
[47:42] can accuse him to make his crucifixion
[47:44] worthy of amen amen it was something
[47:46] done with love I mean it was because of
[47:49] the love that he had for us amen that's
[47:51] why he died John 12 23 to um
[47:55] uh or let's read the Hebrews chapter 9
[47:58] verse 22 the Bible says that uh uh and
[48:02] almost all things are by the law perched
[48:05] with blood and without the shedding of
[48:08] blood there is no remission
[48:11] amen he had to die because like we said
[48:14] earlier it meant only life could
[48:18] overcome so it can overcome death amen
[48:21] It's Only Life that can overcome death
[48:23] amen that's why that's what the Bible
[48:24] said that we've been Justified amen
[48:27] we've been Justified because Jesus
[48:29] Christ took our place amen he took our
[48:32] places and he died for us amen that's
[48:34] that's the thing that causes our
[48:36] justification amen it when because he
[48:38] died for us amen there is nothing else
[48:40] that can that they can accuse us from
[48:43] amen because Jesus by Dying For Us amen
[48:45] he took everything with him amen he took
[48:48] all our burdens away with him
[48:50] amen uh
[48:53] in John chapter 1 of First John chapter
[48:56] 1 verse 7. the Bible said that but if we
[48:59] walk in the light
[49:01] if we walk in the light as he is the
[49:04] light we have Fellowship one with
[49:06] another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[49:09] his son cleanse us from all sin amen
[49:13] it's only the blood of Jesus Amen that
[49:15] can cleanse you from everything amen you
[49:18] can try to to do any kind of things I
[49:20] mean you can try to uh uh Say the Name
[49:23] of Jesus how many times you like you can
[49:25] try to amen do those uh uh um uh uh um
[49:30] you can try to even go baptize yourself
[49:34] under the water and things like that
[49:36] Amen in order for you to be cleansed
[49:38] amen there's only the blood of Jesus
[49:40] that has that ability it meant to clean
[49:43] you from your sins I mean it doesn't
[49:45] matter what you try to do amen there is
[49:47] only that I'll be that the blood of
[49:48] Jesus in my dad is able Amen to clean
[49:51] you from from all your sins amen you can
[49:53] try everything that you know of you can
[49:55] try everything that it meant every kind
[49:58] of method that you can try amen that
[50:00] will not do any good amen because the
[50:03] Bible says that the blood of of of
[50:05] the goats amen could only clean the
[50:08] flesh I mean he could only claim amen
[50:10] the the the amen he could only clean the
[50:13] scene but not forgive not forget amen
[50:16] but whenever but when you are cleansed
[50:18] it may cleanse by the blood of Jesus
[50:20] Amen the prophet says that in other
[50:22] words the balance goes back to zero amen
[50:25] everything that you have done in the
[50:26] past now has been forgotten amen it's
[50:29] been it's now under the the sea amen so
[50:32] there is nowhere to find it amen that
[50:34] was the Redemption by Blood amen showing
[50:37] that Jesus Christ the Lamb of God and
[50:39] when he had to Die For Us Amen in order
[50:42] for his blood it meant to redeem us amen
[50:45] because the love says that amen the man
[50:48] that the soul that sinneth amen the soul
[50:50] Shall Perish amen that low amen somebody
[50:53] had to Die For Us amen amen that's what
[50:56] Jesus died for us that was the
[50:57] Redemption by Blood it meant by the
[50:59] Redemption by power
[51:02] amen it's when you are facing troubles
[51:05] amen when you are facing troubles it's
[51:08] like Jesus it's like the children of
[51:10] Israel amen after the Passover amen they
[51:13] had to go out amen because Redemption
[51:16] it's also
[51:18] in other words Redemption is also that
[51:20] connects with us amen you have to go you
[51:23] have to come out of a man to go into
[51:25] amen by the difference between
[51:27] Redemption and exodus I mean it's like
[51:30] Redemption you're not going into a new
[51:32] place amen you're going back to your
[51:35] first initial position amen bye bye next
[51:37] so that's amen you can come out of
[51:39] something somewhere and go wherever go
[51:42] into wherever you want but in Redemption
[51:44] amen you come out of something by you
[51:46] going back Amen to your first your
[51:48] initial position amen that's that's the
[51:51] Redemption amen but you see that when
[51:53] God redeemed them by his blood amen
[51:55] amenity he saved them from being from
[51:57] dying amen now he can't wear trouble
[52:00] came to them and then he came that they
[52:03] were facing troubles amen now the power
[52:05] of God was required and then now the
[52:08] power of God was required Amen to face
[52:11] to stop Pharaoh amen because Pharaoh a
[52:14] man promised them that I would set you
[52:16] free amen but he had no intention to set
[52:19] them free I mean he was telling Moses
[52:21] well Moses if you do this and that then
[52:23] I will set you free if you do this and
[52:25] and after this I will set you free you
[52:28] can go but but when they will come back
[52:30] again amen they will see that Pharaoh
[52:32] will change his mind the Bible says that
[52:33] Moses came to Pharaoh about nine times
[52:36] telling Pharaoh that you have to let my
[52:38] people go amen by he wanted he didn't
[52:41] want to let them go amen it's like the
[52:43] devil amen today amen he can lie to you
[52:45] tell you about these things that hey
[52:47] you've been uh
[52:49] uh just uh you know you've been uh
[52:52] forgiven and and and and you can do this
[52:55] just one time and I will let you go and
[52:57] you forget about it but the next day you
[53:00] find yourself doing the same thing again
[53:01] and again amen you can watch this today
[53:04] and probably tomorrow uh uh you I will
[53:07] let you go tomorrow you will stop
[53:09] watching this and and you can sing today
[53:11] tomorrow to more this scene today just
[53:13] the last time for you to sin and do and
[53:15] and after that you will be fine you know
[53:18] God will forgive you amen and if you
[53:20] didn't repent amen he's just a trap amen
[53:23] that he's telling you that you do this
[53:25] just for today and then I will let you
[53:27] go then you can forget about it amen but
[53:29] he will not let you go in and you do it
[53:31] today and tomorrow remind you will have
[53:33] the same desire and the same desire will
[53:35] become will become now a nature to you
[53:38] amen he will come now and have it
[53:40] I mean it's like uh there's a say that
[53:43] says um I'm trying to find it here
[53:49] there's a proverb that say that so a
[53:53] thought and you will rip an action
[53:57] so in action and you were ripping a
[54:00] habit so a habit and you will reap a
[54:03] character so a character and you reap a
[54:06] destiny it meant everything starts with
[54:09] the thought it meant everything starts
[54:11] in your mind amen you start thinking
[54:13] about something if you start thinking
[54:15] about sinning you start thinking about
[54:17] doing something wrong and then after the
[54:19] thought I mean he comes with it comes in
[54:22] action then then you will rip an action
[54:24] that thought would create will tell you
[54:26] we give you the strength amend to act
[54:28] and then after an action that thing will
[54:31] become inhabit if you don't stop amen it
[54:34] will become a second nature to you and
[54:36] after habit then it will become your
[54:38] character and then after your character
[54:40] amen then will become your destiny amen
[54:43] that's why it is good it meant to think
[54:45] about the word of God every time amen
[54:48] that's why it is good to think about God
[54:49] every time because when you think about
[54:51] him and when you think about his his
[54:53] word and his wonders and everything that
[54:55] he has done for you amen will become an
[54:58] action and then it will become your
[55:00] destiny amen you have to start thinking
[55:02] about him all the time amen that's why
[55:04] the prophet says that that our mind is
[55:06] in no man's land and no man's land is
[55:08] the place where it battles where where
[55:11] where soldiers fight where when there's
[55:13] a war between nations amen they look for
[55:16] that no man's land where where people
[55:19] will not be heard like the the city will
[55:21] not be hurting and things like that that
[55:23] will find a neutral point Amen in our
[55:25] neutral point is our mind amen that's
[55:27] why we have different thoughts flowing
[55:29] through our mind we have bad thoughts
[55:31] and good thoughts so it just depends on
[55:33] what thought that you nurture the most
[55:35] that's the thing that will overcome amen
[55:37] you'll see that the Redemption by power
[55:40] and made the children of Israel
[55:42] they were leaving Egypt amen because God
[55:45] told them God tell Moses to tell the
[55:47] people that to tell pharaoh to let these
[55:50] people go so now on their way out of
[55:52] Egypt amen Pharaoh promising Pharaoh
[55:55] would tell Moses after the last plague
[55:57] that you just go I don't need you
[55:59] anymore in here but after they left
[56:03] emefaro was behind them trying to pursue
[56:06] them to kill them amen because he just
[56:08] couldn't grasp that that thought of
[56:10] letting the the the the children of
[56:13] Israel go because the irritation of
[56:15] Israel amen worse were the key of the
[56:19] blessing of Egypt amen it was because
[56:21] they were there in Egypt that's why
[56:23] Egypt was a strong Nation amen because
[56:25] they had the promise of God that God
[56:27] will always provide for you amen God
[56:30] will always be with you God will always
[56:31] help you it was because of them that
[56:34] Egypt was blessed amen was because of
[56:36] Joseph in a man who went to Egypt a man
[56:39] who helped them amen throughout those
[56:41] family years is it meant to still have
[56:43] to still have food but when the cheese
[56:46] that those children of Israel left it
[56:48] meant nobody talked about Egypt anymore
[56:50] Egypt became in history amen because
[56:52] God's people were not there amen that's
[56:55] why that's why Jeremiah you will see
[56:57] that God told Jeremiah to go in the city
[56:59] amen if he finds one or two people who
[57:02] still fear the lord God will spare that
[57:04] City because God cares amen for you so
[57:07] God cares for his children
[57:09] amen Redemption by power amen God did
[57:12] not just stop you know redeem it by
[57:15] redeeming them by the blood by with his
[57:17] blood God did not just stop redeeming
[57:20] their soul I mean he also had to keep
[57:23] their physical being safe
[57:25] amen the prophecy that the deaf Angel
[57:27] passed over
[57:29] proving that God had made a way of
[57:31] Escape through the offering of the blood
[57:34] and their skin they accepted it
[57:36] now he's going to make a way of escape
[57:39] from a physical death
[57:42] like a black believer as soon as he gets
[57:46] saved may be a cancer has eaten has
[57:50] eaten him up or something um some uh
[57:53] some diseases God has Redemption also
[57:57] through Power
[57:58] the same as he has Redemption for the
[58:01] soul he has Redemption for the body
[58:04] they weren't saved
[58:06] and they were circumcised they were
[58:09] under the blood by yet Pharaoh it might
[58:13] the enemy was going to destroy them kill
[58:16] them all right there in the wilderness
[58:18] then God sowed
[58:21] and then God showed his power of
[58:23] redemption for their body you get it you
[58:27] know what I'm speaking of the
[58:29] congregation says amen Redemption by the
[58:32] power
[58:33] and then
[58:34] when the the enemy was right nearly on
[58:39] them the great Supernatural pill of Fire
[58:43] raised up from uh raised out from over
[58:47] Israel come over here
[58:50] and stood between them and death amen
[58:53] Redemption by power amen God had to keep
[58:55] them safe that's why you understand the
[58:57] Bible somewhere and says I'm pretty sure
[58:59] Exodus he says that the god that hold
[59:01] the pill of fire was leading them in
[59:04] front was in front of them leading them
[59:05] amen by what danger was in their back
[59:08] when danger was coming the Bible said
[59:10] that the pillow fire that was leading
[59:12] the children of Israel left from being
[59:13] before them amen went behind them it
[59:16] meant to become a shield it meant to
[59:19] make sure that they were safe amen
[59:21] because God doesn't only care for your
[59:22] soul he also cares for your body amen he
[59:25] also cares for your physical being
[59:26] that's why he's a Healer amen that's
[59:29] what amen he's a way out when when we
[59:32] Face troubles and temptations amen
[59:34] that's why God also cares that God had
[59:36] to make sure amen that those children of
[59:38] Israel they were also safe
[59:40] amen so that's why you don't have to
[59:43] fear even though death is knocking at
[59:45] your door amen you don't have to fear
[59:48] because the prophet says that when death
[59:49] is knocking amen you have the ability to
[59:52] choose whether to die or not to die amen
[59:54] you have the choice if he says that now
[59:56] to every believer Born Again child of
[59:58] God when death comes stealing to the
[1:00:01] door prematurely
[1:00:03] the angel of God stands between you and
[1:00:06] the sickness now if you want to run on
[1:00:09] to run on to it that's your business but
[1:00:13] you don't have to see he is standing
[1:00:15] between you and death amen is standing
[1:00:18] between you and death making sure that
[1:00:21] that you can't go prematurely that one
[1:00:23] was found in uh Redemption and
[1:00:25] completeness in George paragraph 63. it
[1:00:29] meant that God is standing there the
[1:00:31] angel of God Is Standing There amen amen
[1:00:33] then you have to make a choice like we
[1:00:35] we preached the last time we preached
[1:00:37] him and that life is a choice amen life
[1:00:40] is constituted by choices it meant
[1:00:43] everything that we do in our lives in
[1:00:44] many churches is all of them are choices
[1:00:47] amen you choose to wake up in the
[1:00:49] morning it's a choice you choose not to
[1:00:50] wake up amen it's your choice you're
[1:00:52] trying to be uh neutral amen is still a
[1:00:55] choice amen but when also death comes to
[1:00:57] you amen you feel sick and your body
[1:00:59] can't get well and and the doctor says
[1:01:02] that you know there is no more hope and
[1:01:04] and you're gonna die tomorrow amen the
[1:01:06] prophecy that you still have that choice
[1:01:08] to choose amen if death is coming
[1:01:10] prematurely you still have that choice
[1:01:12] to choose it may either it meant to say
[1:01:14] no to it or to go right on to run into
[1:01:18] it amen it's your choice it's your
[1:01:20] business amen you don't have to amen
[1:01:22] because the angel of God is standing
[1:01:24] between you and death
[1:01:27] amen When the Children of when they left
[1:01:29] Egypt
[1:01:30] Pharaoh was on their back coming back
[1:01:32] coming becoming with the coming behind
[1:01:35] them to kill them and when he had all
[1:01:37] the intention to kill them that's why he
[1:01:39] took all these armies all these armies
[1:01:41] he meant to kill them amen and the Reds
[1:01:44] he was before them
[1:01:46] the power of God was required then amen
[1:01:49] because there is the Red Sea before them
[1:01:51] no so that there was no way to go to uh
[1:01:54] there was nowhere to go overseas and
[1:01:57] Pharaoh was coming behind them amen the
[1:02:01] children of Israel was trying to try to
[1:02:02] panic and and and go to Moses well Moses
[1:02:05] should have left us back then and and
[1:02:08] eat our onions and and and things like
[1:02:10] that amen Moses you are rather even
[1:02:13] serve fairer than than come and die here
[1:02:16] amen because they didn't find any way
[1:02:18] out amen they didn't know where to go
[1:02:20] they couldn't go back because Pharaoh
[1:02:22] what was up wanted to kill them and they
[1:02:25] couldn't go forward amen they even said
[1:02:27] well Moses there is no boat here it
[1:02:29] meant to even take us to go through
[1:02:32] there Moses we don't know how to swim
[1:02:34] even though we tried to swim we can't
[1:02:36] make it Moses there is no there is no
[1:02:39] well that can swallow us as they did
[1:02:41] with Jonah Moses there is no way out
[1:02:43] amen they try to think amen as human
[1:02:45] being try to think their way out they
[1:02:47] just couldn't and some of them started
[1:02:49] to cry some of them started to panic I
[1:02:52] mean some of them started to to complain
[1:02:54] Moses just take us back just go and
[1:02:57] apologize to Pharaoh amen so that he can
[1:02:59] receive us back in Moses I'd rather be a
[1:03:02] slave than than to die here but when God
[1:03:05] told Moses and he said Moses why are you
[1:03:07] crying amen Moses why are you crying
[1:03:10] amen you have the ability to speak the
[1:03:12] word amen Moses why are you panicking
[1:03:15] you have the ability to speak the word
[1:03:16] stand still and know that I am God Amen
[1:03:20] Moses stand still and I know that I am
[1:03:22] God you have the ability to speak the
[1:03:24] word and to divide this Red Sea and you
[1:03:26] guys will walk in dry land amen and
[1:03:29] Moses did exactly that amen God divided
[1:03:32] the Red Sea and they walked on dry land
[1:03:34] amen because God showed them that he has
[1:03:36] the power of redemption him and he can
[1:03:38] redeem them with his power amen that he
[1:03:41] wanted to keep them safe amen so that's
[1:03:44] why when troubles come to you amen
[1:03:45] troubles come in your family amen you
[1:03:48] don't know what to do just turn your
[1:03:49] faith to God Amen just let your faith
[1:03:52] look up to him amen just turn your eyes
[1:03:54] to him and say Lord
[1:03:56] I'm just depending on you lord lord what
[1:04:00] is the next step Lord what should I do
[1:04:01] next amen what troubles come to you it
[1:04:04] doesn't mean that you have been forsaken
[1:04:05] amen try to imagine if Joseph Iman
[1:04:09] stopped amen because everything was
[1:04:10] going wrong for him amen he went to Fair
[1:04:13] first of all uh he was hated by his
[1:04:16] father by his brothers amen his life was
[1:04:18] miserable amen he couldn't he didn't
[1:04:21] feel safe when he was with his own
[1:04:22] Brothers amen they sold they sold him to
[1:04:25] fit to to uh party for
[1:04:28] arriving there amen amen he had troubles
[1:04:31] with his wife with 45 uh with his
[1:04:34] master's wife and then after that he
[1:04:36] went to prison amen Joseph could have
[1:04:39] been there complaining about God why my
[1:04:41] life is just going worse after worst and
[1:04:43] worse things are just coming to me but
[1:04:46] Joseph amen amen just could Joseph kept
[1:04:49] his faith in God Amen because right
[1:04:51] because more troubles was coming to him
[1:04:54] the closer he was he meant to fulfill it
[1:04:57] made the closer it was to to uh uh uh
[1:05:02] the closer was his Joy his Joy was on
[1:05:04] the way amen he says that amen amen amen
[1:05:08] the night amen will never last forever
[1:05:11] amen there is a time limit for a night
[1:05:14] peer amen because morning Joy shall come
[1:05:16] in the morning amen George uh uh uh
[1:05:20] Joseph had to remember God's word him
[1:05:23] and he had to remember that Joy will
[1:05:25] come in the morning amen because my life
[1:05:27] is being worse and everything is not
[1:05:29] going well it doesn't mean that God has
[1:05:31] forsaken me amen that was something that
[1:05:34] God has to eat that he had to go through
[1:05:36] so that he can be ready Amen to manage
[1:05:39] amen that the position that he was
[1:05:41] supposed to take amen before because if
[1:05:44] God just took Joseph from his father's
[1:05:46] house and and brought him to that
[1:05:48] position where where he was where he was
[1:05:50] supposed to be amen I believe that
[1:05:52] Joseph would have failed amen because he
[1:05:54] didn't have that character amen because
[1:05:56] Joseph had to go through those trials in
[1:05:59] man Jesus and Joseph had to go through
[1:06:01] all those things it meant to build that
[1:06:03] character amen because character is not
[1:06:06] a gift but character is a victory I mean
[1:06:08] he had to go through those trials it
[1:06:10] meant to build a character amen because
[1:06:13] and to build a character because when he
[1:06:16] will be blessed amen he will know
[1:06:18] exactly how to handle it amen when he
[1:06:20] will be blessed amen you will not turn
[1:06:22] his back from God because he's blessed
[1:06:24] amen when he will be blessed him and he
[1:06:26] will still be remembering amen what he
[1:06:28] had to go through and he will still be
[1:06:30] remembering God Amen God had to redeem
[1:06:33] them amen God had to save them Pharaoh
[1:06:36] was on their back the Red Sea before
[1:06:38] them amen there is nowhere to go on your
[1:06:40] left side and on your right side they're
[1:06:42] still dangerous you feel stuck and you
[1:06:44] don't know where to go just turn your
[1:06:47] eyes to God
[1:06:48] amen you have troubles before your
[1:06:50] troubles behind your troubles you know
[1:06:52] left troubles in your right there is no
[1:06:54] solution even though it says that my
[1:06:57] help comes from above my Help Cometh
[1:07:00] From God Amen when you feel yourself
[1:07:02] amen amen uh uh
[1:07:04] amen you you feel yourself in midst of
[1:07:07] troubles imagine just trust God Amen he
[1:07:10] has a plane he has a way out amen
[1:07:12] because the Bible says that God gives us
[1:07:14] troubles that first of all that we are
[1:07:16] able to overcome it but even though we
[1:07:19] are over able to overcome it y'all we
[1:07:21] always finds he always gives us a way
[1:07:23] out amen but you just have to depend on
[1:07:25] him amen you just have to trust him you
[1:07:28] just have to wait on the Lord amen
[1:07:30] Joseph had to practice his patience amen
[1:07:33] Joseph had to wait on God Amen Joseph
[1:07:36] had to wait on God because God had
[1:07:38] something plain for him imagine God has
[1:07:40] something big that was coming for him
[1:07:42] amen so he had to be patient amen until
[1:07:45] the time of the Lord was there amen
[1:07:48] Abraham had to be patient amen until the
[1:07:51] time of the of God was there amen If
[1:07:54] Abraham had Isaac after one year of
[1:07:56] marriage amen that testimony wouldn't
[1:07:59] help amen uh
[1:08:01] wouldn't help it meant uh uh uh those
[1:08:04] people who came after him amen but he
[1:08:07] had to go through that 25 years of
[1:08:09] waiting amen so that when you tell
[1:08:11] somebody about the testimony of Abraham
[1:08:13] amen that person will still know that
[1:08:15] there is a God who still care amen is
[1:08:18] still it doesn't matter how long I have
[1:08:19] to wait amen but God still hears my
[1:08:22] prayer amen because you promised me that
[1:08:25] he will give me a son and God will honor
[1:08:28] his promise amen God can never give you
[1:08:30] something that he knows that he won't do
[1:08:32] it amen whatever God says whatever that
[1:08:34] comes out of his mouth amen he's more
[1:08:37] than able to fulfill it
[1:08:39] amen God had to stand between them
[1:08:42] amen the prophet says that when they
[1:08:44] come out of on the other side
[1:08:48] here it is I want you to see it as they
[1:08:51] come out on the other side crawled up on
[1:08:54] the bank and looked back
[1:08:56] and seen all those tests test Masters
[1:08:59] who had been uh who had beaten them
[1:09:02] killed some of them just like cancer and
[1:09:06] cigarettes and tobaccos and whiskey and
[1:09:08] everything else drives the kids insane
[1:09:11] sends them to the Asylum into hospitals
[1:09:16] and a bunch of neurotics and and
[1:09:18] everything else produced in the world
[1:09:21] when they looked black
[1:09:23] and so all those things struggling
[1:09:26] helpless and dying in the sea brother
[1:09:29] you talk about the meeting they had won
[1:09:31] amen they had a good meeting Moses this
[1:09:34] dignified man as soon as he come
[1:09:38] through that experience he's seen all
[1:09:40] those test Masters dead he know he knew
[1:09:44] all of them you know all them things was
[1:09:48] gone forever then all those things that
[1:09:51] had drove them and beat them and wiped
[1:09:55] them around and and was finished he
[1:09:58] raised his hands and sank in the spirit
[1:10:01] oh my never been typed
[1:10:05] and won't be until we get the glue we
[1:10:08] get to Glory up yonder when the
[1:10:11] completion was made there he sang in the
[1:10:14] spirit and when we're redeemed in that
[1:10:17] body that was a type of the Holy Spirit
[1:10:20] coming at Pentecost
[1:10:22] when we passed through the sea it was a
[1:10:26] type of Pentacles and Moses
[1:10:30] in the type back there
[1:10:32] when he passed through that he sang in
[1:10:35] the spirit he come on that day of
[1:10:37] Pentecost and when the body is perfect
[1:10:40] redeemed now all now our soul is perfect
[1:10:44] redeemed right cannot perish God
[1:10:48] everlasting life what the Bible says oh
[1:10:50] I feel good know this why because I know
[1:10:54] it's thus if the Lord just anchor my
[1:10:57] soul there and walk on and say Satan
[1:11:00] just he saw
[1:11:02] uh he saw you want to to me don't bother
[1:11:06] me because I know whom I have believed
[1:11:09] and then persuaded he's able to keep
[1:11:12] that which I have committed to him
[1:11:14] against that day
[1:11:16] amen
[1:11:18] Moses so all God has done for him amen
[1:11:21] because Moses gave that promise to the
[1:11:23] children of Israel that these Egyptians
[1:11:26] that you sing right now amen you will
[1:11:28] see them no more amen they probably they
[1:11:31] didn't understand what Moses said they
[1:11:33] didn't understand some of them asked
[1:11:35] Moses but what are you saying because

[1:11:38] they're not slowing down amen they're
[1:11:41] just coming look they have the arrows
[1:11:42] ready to Amen to to kill us but Moses
[1:11:45] what are you saying Moses could have
[1:11:47] told them just trust God Amen just put
[1:11:51] your faith in God Amen that these
[1:11:53] Egyptians that you sing right now amen
[1:11:55] you will see them no more amen there is
[1:11:58] a time that is coming that you will be
[1:11:59] free forever amen that you will be free
[1:12:02] from your labor amen you will be free
[1:12:03] from sin amen those things that is
[1:12:06] bothering you right now the sickness sin
[1:12:08] and everything amen you will see them no
[1:12:10] more amen because Christ died for you
[1:12:13] amen but when they went over it that
[1:12:15] when they went over that land amended
[1:12:17] that on the other side the Bible said
[1:12:19] that Miriam amen she took her tambourine
[1:12:22] and she starts singing in the spirit
[1:12:24] amen she started rejoicing it may
[1:12:27] rejoicing because she started to think
[1:12:29] about how her life was miserable amen
[1:12:32] why she had to go through amen all the
[1:12:35] trials that she had to go through it
[1:12:37] meant all the persecutions amen how she
[1:12:40] was beaten even how she saw her brother
[1:12:42] died and the brother dying and and
[1:12:45] little babies dying and children and
[1:12:47] mothers and fathers dying and when she
[1:12:49] started to think about these things and
[1:12:51] and think about the grace of God that
[1:12:53] she was one of the few amen that was
[1:12:55] able to make it over amen that she was
[1:12:58] one of the few living Amen to testify
[1:13:00] amen the goodness of God Amen she
[1:13:03] started to give thanks to God and when
[1:13:05] she started to to sing and once she
[1:13:07] started to sing amen all those sisters
[1:13:10] and girls that was there Amanda joined
[1:13:13] her they said well Miriam let's sing now
[1:13:15] it's our time to praise the Lord amen to
[1:13:17] thank him for what he's done for us amen
[1:13:20] but when you see that everything is done
[1:13:23] it meant All the Troubles is gone
[1:13:26] amen this is time to Rejoice amen
[1:13:29] because God died for you amen he shared
[1:13:32] his blood for you amen it's the time to
[1:13:34] Rejoice because there is no sin that can
[1:13:36] Bond you anymore amen because you have
[1:13:38] been forgiven from all your sins amen
[1:13:40] for your worst nightmare that you can

[1:13:47] reason to be crying amen you have no
[1:13:49] reason to be sad even you have no reason
[1:13:52] to be sad and start complaining amen you

[1:14:16] will be free from it and then you will
[1:14:19] be free for me amen is like this song
[1:14:21] that says once like a bird in prison at
[1:14:24] wealth no freedom from my for my sorrow
[1:14:27] I felt but Jesus came and listened to me
[1:14:31] and glory to God he set me free amen he
[1:14:35] set me free
[1:14:37] a man he set me free he broke the bonds
[1:14:39] of Prisons for me I'm Glory bound my
[1:14:43] Jesus to see for Glory to God he set me
[1:14:46] free amen Jesus listen to your cry amen
[1:14:50] remember he told Moses that I have
[1:14:52] listened to the Cry of my people amen
[1:14:54] amen when they were crying when they
[1:14:56] were praying to God and when they were
[1:14:58] saying Lord we need that we need you to
[1:15:00] deliver us Lord we we need you to come
[1:15:03] and save us amen God didn't forget all
[1:15:05] those prayers amen God remembered all
[1:15:08] those prayers amen God listened to all
[1:15:09] those prayers when he came and he talked
[1:15:12] to Moses he said Moses I've listened to
[1:15:14] the Cry of my people amen amen all your
[1:15:17] prayers that you do all the prayers that
[1:15:19] you do for your family all your prayers
[1:15:20] that you do for for your loved ones amen
[1:15:22] for your friends and for your neighbors
[1:15:24] amen God listens to you amen God
[1:15:27] remembers it amen there will be a time
[1:15:29] where he will come to you will say my
[1:15:31] son amen I've listened to all your
[1:15:33] prayers and now is the time for your
[1:15:35] deliverance
[1:15:36] amen because God doesn't forget that God
[1:15:39] doesn't forget us amen God always thinks
[1:15:42] about us amen that's why he gives us
[1:15:44] that's why he gave us a prophet amen
[1:15:46] that's why he gives us his word amen he
[1:15:49] gave us the Bible amen he gave us the
[1:15:51] word he meant to keep reminding us amen
[1:15:54] that he's always there by our side so
[1:15:56] amen there is no time it's not a time to
[1:15:58] be worrying amen it's not a time to be
[1:16:01] complaining amen it's not a Time amen
[1:16:03] amen to be asking yourselves questions
[1:16:05] amen without we like does God care for
[1:16:09] me it's not a time to do that amen but
[1:16:11] it's a time to to trust God
[1:16:14] the song that we sing that my faith
[1:16:16] looks up to my faith looks up to him
[1:16:19] amen you have we have to put our faith
[1:16:21] in him say the Lord
[1:16:23] I believe in your word Lord amen I
[1:16:26] believe in everything that you have said
[1:16:28] amen your Bible the Bible is true and
[1:16:30] your word is true and Lord here I am I
[1:16:33] give you my heart I give you my soul
[1:16:35] lord I want to be washed Lord I've done
[1:16:37] so many things that I'm ashamed of Lord
[1:16:40] I've done so many things that I'm not
[1:16:42] proud of but Lord here I am I need you
[1:16:45] to wash me I need you to cleanse me amen
[1:16:48] he will redeem You by his blood and when
[1:16:50] troubles come when sickness come amen
[1:16:53] his power is always there Amen to make
[1:16:55] sure it meant that you are safe amen the
[1:16:58] Bible close with this the prophet said
[1:17:01] that God vindicates that that's always
[1:17:04] been right God vindicates it to be true
[1:17:08] so plainly the predestinated is the only
[1:17:12] one that's considered in Redemption
[1:17:17] did you get it let me say it again let
[1:17:19] me say that again the predestinated is
[1:17:23] the only one that's considered in
[1:17:25] Redemption
[1:17:26] people might be making people might be
[1:17:29] making like
[1:17:31] think they are but the real Redemption
[1:17:35] is those that are predestinated
[1:17:38] because the very word redeem means to
[1:17:42] bring back is that right redeem the
[1:17:45] redeem
[1:17:46] to redeem anything is to bring back to
[1:17:49] its original Place Hallelujah
[1:17:52] it's only the predestinated
[1:17:55] will be brought back because others
[1:17:58] didn't come from there see to bring back
[1:18:02] amen you came from God and you're going
[1:18:05] back to God Like Jesus says in John
[1:18:07] chapter 16 that I came from God I came
[1:18:10] from my father and I'm going back to my
[1:18:13] father amen you're only going back where
[1:18:15] you came from amen you're not going back
[1:18:17] to you know for something new and when
[1:18:20] the devil was the person who had the
[1:18:23] right to redeem us amen the devil was
[1:18:25] the first person who had the right for
[1:18:26] our Redemption remember he didn't have
[1:18:29] the price to pay amen he couldn't pay
[1:18:32] the price that was required amen only
[1:18:34] the blood was required for our
[1:18:36] Redemption so the Devil Couldn't die for
[1:18:38] us that's why he lost his place and
[1:18:40] Jesus had to become the closest Kinsmen
[1:18:43] Amen in other words he had to become his
[1:18:46] son he had to make a body to become to
[1:18:48] come here on Earth he meant to to feel
[1:18:51] the pain that we feel it meant to be
[1:18:53] sick like we are sick amen to be hungry
[1:18:55] like we are hungry to be tried and to be
[1:18:57] tempted Amen to go through everything
[1:19:00] that we go through in our daily lives
[1:19:01] Amen to understand our pains to
[1:19:04] understand what we go through then the
[1:19:06] Redemption will make sense that then
[1:19:08] Redemption amen will become more
[1:19:10] valuable that's why he didn't send his
[1:19:12] angels amen because Angels couldn't sin
[1:19:14] amen Angels Angels they don't Angels
[1:19:17] they don't they don't they don't have
[1:19:19] that thing that take
[1:19:21] they don't have that thing that takes to
[1:19:24] pay the price I mean it was only his
[1:19:26] blood amen That was supposed to redeem
[1:19:29] us amen he who was not a sinner amen
[1:19:32] here who did not commit any sin amen he
[1:19:35] became sin amen for you and me so that
[1:19:38] today you can say praise the Lord I'm
[1:19:40] free amen so that today you can sing
[1:19:43] that amazing grace that saved the rich
[1:19:45] like you amen said that today you can
[1:19:47] sing all the wonders of God Amen because
[1:19:49] that day on Calvary amen he died for you
[1:19:52] he took your place
[1:19:53] amen so you don't have to you to take it
[1:19:57] very lightly amen because Grace as I
[1:19:59] always say grace as has a period amen
[1:20:02] Grace is not something that is giving
[1:20:04] you Eternal amen there is a period for
[1:20:06] Grace because when you reject Grace that
[1:20:09] same Grace becomes a judgment for you so
[1:20:11] if you have the grace of God Amen you
[1:20:14] better take it because the prophet says
[1:20:15] that a pardon is a pardon when it's when
[1:20:18] it's received coming when it is received
[1:20:20] as a pardon so if it's not received the
[1:20:23] grace is also a Grace when it is
[1:20:25] received as a Grace so if you reject
[1:20:27] that Grace that same Grace will become a
[1:20:30] judgment amen don't make the same don't
[1:20:32] make the mistake that the children of
[1:20:33] Israel made it meant to reject Jesus
[1:20:36] Christ when he first came amen but you
[1:20:38] have to receive them
[1:20:39] he meant to say Lord come in My Heart
[1:20:42] Lord I need you inside of me Lord I want
[1:20:45] you to save me if the musician can come
[1:20:47] and sing that that Amazing Grace Lord I
[1:20:50] want you to come inside of me Lord I
[1:20:52] need you to save me I know Pharaoh
[1:20:55] doesn't have the Pharaoh doesn't want to
[1:20:58] let me go I mean he's just giving me
[1:21:00] things and and trying to make me happy
[1:21:02] for a while but then he will come and
[1:21:05] put the time for me to go he will say no
[1:21:07] but Lord I want you to set me free but I
[1:21:10] want you to break all the bonds if the
[1:21:12] bondage Lord I want you to take me from
[1:21:14] this prison I mean if we can stand and
[1:21:16] and sing this Amazing Grace amen you who
[1:21:20] was once rich and man you was once a
[1:21:23] sinner and when you did bad things in
[1:21:26] the past and and Jesus Christ died for
[1:21:28] you amen he shared his blood for you I
[1:21:31] made this Amazing Grace let's sing this
[1:21:33] song
[1:21:35] [Music]

[1:26:35] the grace that God my father
[1:26:42] he looked beyond
[1:26:47] my fault and his soul my knees
[1:26:54] God looked beyond your fault
[1:26:58] and he saw your need
[1:27:01] and when you saw what you needed exactly

[1:29:55] and and you couldn't see it from the
[1:29:57] outside
[1:29:58] everybody claimed to have it but it must
[1:30:00] be seen it can't be something
[1:30:03] um that you know God has to go search
