[0:00] based on the living thoughts in a living
[0:02] book like I don't want to kind of do
[0:05] another is that part one two or three
[0:08] I'm not sure but I just wanted minister
[0:11] on that again I'm working on another
[0:13] lesson and and I I'm sure God is going
[0:18] to do something with that but I think
[0:23] he's a little more it's too premature
[0:24] two brains at night so I just want to
[0:28] kind of finish up on that or do
[0:31] something so that you can see by God's
[0:33] grace how important it is for us to
[0:37] protect our thoughts amen proverbs 23
[0:41] and 7 and then we'll go to Philippians
[0:43] 2:5 proverbs 23 and 7 we had a wonderful
[0:52] time there in Columbia South Carolina
[0:56] God really outpoured the Holy Spirit
[0:59] like in the old-fashioned way it was
[1:02] just amazing how how everybody went away
[1:07] blessed they were healings deliverance
[1:10] is I and if I had to judge it it would
[1:13] have been the greatest of all the ten
[1:16] meetings I've been to down south so we
[1:20] appreciate God for His goodness and His
[1:22] grace has been good to us and that's why
[1:27] Satan caused me to lose my phone he's
[1:28] trying to agitate me but that's okay he
[1:32] has to do what he has to do and I've got
[1:34] to do what I've got to did Psalms 23 and
[1:37] 7 it says for as a man thinketh in his
[1:39] heart so is he
[1:41] eat and drink say that he to thee but
[1:46] his heart is not with it just shows a
[1:48] man hypocritical man
[1:52] Philippians please Philippians 2 and 5
[1:57] he says let this mind be in you which
[2:01] was also in Christ Jesus who being in
[2:04] the form of God thought it not robbery
[2:07] to be equal with God but made himself of
[2:11] no reputation
[2:13] and took upon him the form of a servant
[2:15] and was made in the likeness of men
[2:20] let us pray father God we come before
[2:23] your Lord as humbly as we know how we
[2:26] thank you Father God for those who have
[2:27] come out to the house of God Lord we
[2:30] don't know where the others are but I
[2:32] pray that you're keeping them safe and
[2:34] sound no hurt harm or danger come upon
[2:38] them god we don't know but you know you
[2:40] are the God the God who knows all things
[2:44] and all things work together for the
[2:46] good of them that love you Lord bless us
[2:49] tonight as we commit this service into
[2:51] your hands in Jesus Christ's name we
[2:53] pray amen
[2:55] you may be seated I wanted to kind of
[2:59] think teach on by God's grace
[3:05] once again thoughts and just thinking
[3:10] about what the Word of God says about us
[3:14] one of the things that I know by God's
[3:17] grace is that we don't really meditate
[3:19] on God we don't take that word and
[3:22] really think about it like we ought to
[3:24] and I think by God's grace if we can
[3:27] rely we realize Amen that there is as
[3:30] there's only two ways of anything and
[3:33] that is the right way in the wrong way
[3:36] and most of the time it the way that we
[3:40] do things is is our way against God's
[3:43] Way and you know the prophet of God says
[3:46] you can't be in your way in God's way at
[3:49] the same time you've got to forget your
[3:53] own way to get in God's Way and you've
[3:57] got to get out of your own way to get in
[4:00] God's Way for as long as you're in your
[4:03] own way you out of his way so forsake
[4:08] your ways forsake your thoughts forsake
[4:13] everything and just rely one thing on
[4:19] one thing and that is thus saith the
[4:21] Lord that's all see and when we
[4:24] you began to see how the prophet of God
[4:27] comes along he's trying to get us to see
[4:29] that we're not here to add to God we're
[4:33] not here to think in our own way to to
[4:37] establish righteousness or holiness
[4:40] everything that we are here for is to
[4:43] say amen to God is the one who
[4:46] establishes all righteousness I thought
[4:50] about it and this was one of the things
[4:51] that I learned even while I was there in
[4:54] Colombia how that God you know I've been
[4:57] really stressing you know the labor to
[5:03] enter into your it's a rest and and but
[5:05] there's another angle to laboring and
[5:08] laboring you know I thought well you
[5:10] know just pushing it you know forcefully
[5:13] making it happen but then the Lord
[5:15] revealed to me by some someone saying
[5:19] you know no it's like yielding the
[5:23] laborer is a yielding it's not like in
[5:29] my mind I pictured it because when God
[5:32] gave me the Holy Ghost you know I didn't
[5:34] have to labor what it was I yielded and
[5:38] as soon as that individual said what
[5:40] they said I thought that's it because
[5:43] yielding is getting yourself out of the
[5:46] way and when you yield to God because
[5:49] God is a gentleman you don't have to you
[5:52] know forcibly try to make it happen and
[5:57] I thought Lord that is so real to me it
[6:01] is so true to me and I thought to myself
[6:04] my approach is Lord I surrender Lord I
[6:08] surrender until everything is
[6:11] surrendered rendered amen and I thought
[6:14] about it by God's grace you know the
[6:18] only way that you and I will establish
[6:20] or come to a place where where God is
[6:22] glorified is that we come to a place
[6:25] where amen we began to really meditate
[6:28] on the world if you don't know the word
[6:30] then how do you know how to yield or
[6:33] what to yield to see you've got to know
[6:36] the Word of God it
[6:38] you got missing Joshua said in the book
[6:40] of Joshua now I love this it says the
[6:43] book of the law should not depart out of
[6:45] thy mouth and I'm gonna get into some
[6:47] thoughts in just a moment but thou shalt
[6:49] meditate therein day and night and thou
[6:54] that thou made observe to do according
[6:58] to all that is written therein for then
[7:02] thou shalt make thy way prosperous and
[7:04] then thou shalt have good success is
[7:09] that right have not I commanded thee be
[7:12] strong and of a good courage be not
[7:15] afraid neither dog dismayed for the Lord
[7:18] that God is with thee whithersoever thou
[7:22] goest now that takes a mint yielding to
[7:25] the Lord you may not feel him you may
[7:32] not taste it you may not see him you
[7:35] know but you know that the Lord is there
[7:38] how do you know because he said I will
[7:41] never leave you nor will I forsake you
[7:44] so when we realize Amen that God is
[7:47] there we must understand it like I said
[7:50] there's only two way of thinking good or
[7:53] evil right and remember I preached the
[7:56] last time God said you make the tree
[7:58] good or you're making evil he gives you
[8:00] a choice he don't even he doesn't give
[8:03] us this lukewarm stage of life good and
[8:06] evil he said make it good or make it
[8:09] evil amen
[8:11] but how are we going to do that without
[8:14] yielding to the one who can make it good
[8:16] see because the Bible tells us that no
[8:20] man can add one cubit to a statue
[8:22] hallelujah but listen it's a power
[8:26] behind Lord not my will but thine be
[8:31] done it's a power behind that because
[8:35] remember I said last time I ministered
[8:38] that one portion of the Our Father
[8:41] prayer let that will be done in earth as
[8:45] it is in heaven and the Holy Ghost keeps
[8:49] them in heaven so the Holy Ghost
[8:52] real and true holy ghost has the power
[8:54] to keep us in earth see but the word l
[8:58] ET let that's yielding let God have his
[9:04] way let go and let God see so we must
[9:09] understand that we have a battle
[9:10] the greatest battle according to the
[9:13] prophet of God the greatest battle ever
[9:15] fought is in the mind and you and I it
[9:18] is a battle anybody anybody says not it
[9:21] is a battle but we do not want to yield
[9:24] to the bad voice you become a house of
[9:28] thoughts I'm gonna say that again you
[9:32] become a house of thoughts and God wants
[9:35] you only to be a tabernacle or a house
[9:38] of thought that thoughts thought right
[9:42] because you remember I told you that in
[9:45] the beginning Adam and Eve was a house
[9:48] of thought they had only one thought and
[9:52] that thought was whatever God thought it
[9:56] wasn't a maybe they had several choices
[10:01] even though God gave him the choice God
[10:05] said the day that you eat of this tree
[10:06] so they knew to stay with God thought to
[10:10] eat of this tree is a bad thing right
[10:14] when that bad thing became good a good
[10:18] thing that's when they messed up so is
[10:25] it in our day Satan can't get us to do
[10:29] anything bad until he makes it look good
[10:33] think about it that's the truth the lust
[10:37] of the eyes the lust of the flesh and
[10:39] the pride of life he can't get us to do
[10:41] it neither these until it becomes
[10:44] pleasing in the eyes see but it's not
[10:50] eyes here
[10:51] he's our heart when in our heart we
[10:56] began to desire or to see it looking
[10:59] good that's when we become that's when
[11:02] Satan has blinded us like he blinded me
[11:04] now
[11:06] says meditators and but be strong Bistro
[11:09] in other words how can I say it
[11:11] y'all know the battle when we talk about
[11:13] yielding you got two voices coming at
[11:16] you do it don't do it do it don't do it
[11:18] you know and you got those losses but he
[11:21] saying be strong in the sense of
[11:23] yielding to the right voice be strong in
[11:28] that bless it because I want you to
[11:31] understand what you hear will affect you
[11:34] as I said I think I said the last time I
[11:37] was here you know when when when II Eve
[11:40] is one she's a woman and a woman loves
[11:44] to hear things you can buy all kinds of
[11:47] stuff and she won't ever be satisfied
[11:50] until you hear her he she hear you say I
[11:53] love you honey oh you're so sweet you
[11:56] just you're beautiful right Caesar
[11:59] that's how the serpent seduced her he
[12:02] seduced her by words now we go by sight
[12:06] right what the man see is what deceives
[12:09] him but because he's not so easily
[12:13] deceived by words but as the church as a
[12:16] bride of Christ or as a Christian being
[12:20] that we are in the feminine agenda you
[12:23] got men you have two men you got the
[12:25] devlins
[12:25] and in God and they're both saying words
[12:28] to you right and those words are going
[12:32] to get next to you one way or the other
[12:34] oh it's the truth nice for example let's
[12:38] use the example the devil come to a
[12:40] woman says oh girl you know you look
[12:42] good but if you put a little bit of that
[12:43] makeup on you're gonna really look sweet
[12:45] right so he seduce her with those nice
[12:48] words and she falls for it right that's
[12:52] how it is with the church that's how it
[12:55] is with preachers they make it all sound
[12:58] good and while they making it all sound
[13:00] good
[13:01] she is wound into her his presence
[13:04] hallelujah leaving the right for the
[13:07] wrong absolutely blessed is the man that
[13:11] walketh not in the counsel of the
[13:13] ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[13:16] sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the
[13:18] scornful but
[13:19] his delight is in the law of the Lord
[13:22] and in the Lord of the meditate day and
[13:25] night now you got to understand that
[13:29] we're working with thoughts as a man
[13:32] thinketh in his heart so is he
[13:35] you don't even know what's in a man's
[13:37] heart until he acts only he either say
[13:41] it or he moves in his motions like the
[13:45] Bible said is not that thing that goes
[13:47] in that defiles a man and what is what
[13:50] come out that defiles him see so I
[13:54] thought you said what do you mean
[13:55] brother looks everything that you
[13:57] receive is of he's of God or the devil
[14:01] by way of thought you said well I heard
[14:04] the devil you heard a thought right and
[14:07] understand when when thoughts comes into
[14:09] your mind
[14:10] it's a picture with it for example amen
[14:16] when the Scylla goes before the white
[14:18] throne judgment the Bible said as a man
[14:21] thinketh and every idle word when you
[14:23] see a word you're not going to see you
[14:25] know the word fornication you're going
[14:28] to see the very individual in motion
[14:31] where he did it it whether it be in
[14:35] heart or whether it be you know whether
[14:38] it be in the spirit or whether it be in
[14:39] the flesh because that's what a movie is
[14:42] when we get to heaven in the white
[14:44] throne judgment we're not going to hear
[14:46] radio we're gonna see television and
[14:50] that television will have sound to it
[14:53] and as we think in our heart that those
[14:56] words are those thoughts produces
[14:59] pictures yummy so understand by God's
[15:04] grace as we think in our heart God just
[15:06] don't hear words he sees the picture
[15:10] that's what Jesus said him in lust
[15:13] thinks in lust in his heart he's already
[15:16] committed see it's a picture now you and
[15:19] I must understand Amen that God's Word
[15:22] is so important it is our very defence
[15:25] and we want the thoughts of God to be in
[15:28] us well what do you mean brother books
[15:30] so that you understand a word
[15:33] thought it originated as a thought and
[15:36] the thought comes from either God or the
[15:40] devil Lucifer thought in his heart right
[15:43] and with that thought he influenced the
[15:47] third of the angels to follow him and
[15:49] how in what way did they follow him by
[15:52] allowing themselves to think outside of
[15:55] the will of God and when they began to
[15:58] think out of the will of God they
[15:59] themselves or defile and they fell with
[16:01] Lucifer hallelujah so is it with us when
[16:05] we began to think outside of the Word of
[16:08] God we fall and defiled ourselves that's
[16:12] the way it is they've seen it on the
[16:14] commercials all the other little TVs
[16:16] amen when you know the little cartoon
[16:18] either got a angel the Lord ain't just
[16:20] standing on what right side and the
[16:22] devil on the other and they're fussing
[16:23] with one another that's a reality
[16:25] because a thought is a person hello
[16:31] because we don't see Satan but you say
[16:34] the devil said the devil made right
[16:37] because he's injecting his thoughts into
[16:41] your mind into your spirit right
[16:44] this is it hi and my word i won well the
[16:49] devil in his word is one you see so you
[16:53] and I must understand that's what he
[16:55] said in the old days a man is judged his
[16:58] characters judged by his words back in
[17:01] the day a man stood with his word stood
[17:03] if I said it was whatever that seals it
[17:06] because that man and his word was the
[17:09] same see so you got to understand that
[17:12] when there are inspirations of thoughts
[17:15] coming in your mind there is a person
[17:17] standing there whether it be the devil
[17:21] or whether it be demons but they're
[17:23] they're talking to you as if it's the
[17:27] same way the Holy Ghost comes and talk
[17:29] to you and when the Holy Ghost when you
[17:32] say oh the Lord said to me or the Lord
[17:34] told me you talk about a person yeah it
[17:38] came into your heart and your spirit as
[17:40] a thought you see them saying there's
[17:44] only to wait like I said
[17:46] before Lucifer fell they all had to
[17:50] thought some God whatever God wanted
[17:52] them to do that's what they do did if
[17:54] God say holy holy holy that's what they
[17:56] did if God said bow they bow and God is
[18:00] a spirit so they proceeded they heard
[18:04] God in their spirit and they obeyed God
[18:08] but it was just as good as a word hmm
[18:13] when you being led by the Spirit what
[18:14] you say what you say God I heard you say
[18:18] come follow me right it's something that
[18:23] moves you you're hearing something in
[18:25] your spirit and you're moving by that
[18:27] spirit is that okay
[18:30] see so you must understand that the only
[18:34] thing that is going to protect us from
[18:37] spiritual attacks when people say things
[18:39] against you when people do wrong against
[18:42] you understand like brother Ram said
[18:44] make excuses for them he said that is
[18:47] the devil right it's not your brother
[18:50] it's the influence of the devil
[18:53] it is his words his thoughts that he
[18:56] have injected in them and therefore now
[18:59] they're walking according to the
[19:01] thoughts of the devil right when Peter
[19:04] said Lord you'll not be crucified Jesus
[19:08] surely says Satan he wasn't talking to
[19:10] Peter he wasn't calling Peter Satan but
[19:14] he recognized the thought and where it
[19:17] originated from and he addressed that
[19:19] issue see them saying so when your
[19:23] brother and your sister say things to
[19:25] you that's contrary to the Word of God
[19:27] because the Bible said blessed and
[19:30] cursed not so somebody say something
[19:32] negative you and I'm trying to apply
[19:34] that to you well you know that didn't
[19:36] come from God it came from devil from
[19:39] the devil so what happens you you you
[19:42] don't you don't look and sayd like Jesus
[19:44] Satan get behind me unless you in
[19:46] trouble you want to fight a million but
[19:49] you recognize the devil listen what the
[19:51] Bible tells us there in Psalms 119 23
[19:54] Prince's are also also did sit and speak
[19:59] against me
[20:00] but thy servant did meditate in that
[20:03] statue in other words when words of
[20:05] offense come when the devil comes and he
[20:08] brings things to you by way of
[20:10] individuals
[20:11] yo yo yo defense is not the gossip or
[20:14] the talk or go around I'm guilty
[20:16] anybody guilty or to say what we
[20:19] shouldn't say but your defense is to
[20:21] hurry get behind the word meditate on
[20:25] the positive things like I am blessed
[20:28] no man can curse me write words that
[20:32] will will will build up a standard and
[20:36] block that negative atmosphere from
[20:39] penetrating into your spirit see so you
[20:43] and I must understand even if it just
[20:46] testimonies that's what the Bible says
[20:47] that testimony is also a my delight and
[20:50] my counselor so I've got testimonies
[20:53] that you're with me
[20:55] and if God before you no man can be
[20:58] against you
[20:59] right so you and I we're dealing with
[21:02] spirits we're dealing with inspiration
[21:05] and when you know that these
[21:07] inspirations are not coming from God you
[21:10] do not allow these things to penetrate
[21:13] you because otherwise you're allowing
[21:16] that devil that's coming from the
[21:18] individual to come down and anoint you
[21:20] in the same way right and all of a
[21:24] sudden you began to say something back
[21:26] and what has happened now both of you
[21:28] need to repent and both of you need need
[21:31] the devil to be exorcised all right
[21:34] because we are we are the Living Word of
[21:39] God this see people to all the raptures
[21:44] coming where the rapture can take place
[21:47] cannot take place until the rod coming
[21:50] them Christ which is the it's manifested
[21:54] and she's manifested by what his
[21:57] thoughts
[21:59] she's emptied all of her thoughts out
[22:02] and now she's going back to one thought
[22:04] that one single singleness of mind and
[22:07] that's what the gut the Holy Spirit is
[22:09] requiring of the church they have
[22:11] singleness of mine
[22:13] not to be a double-minded church or
[22:15] double minded people have one purpose
[22:17] and that is to glorify God to produce
[22:20] God to manifest God to declare God
[22:25] everything is about declaring Jesus
[22:27] Christ not ourselves there are no great
[22:30] ones among us whenever you think there's
[22:33] a great one as a person you think you're
[22:35] a great one among those you are fallen
[22:38] you are anointed by the devil it's the
[22:42] truth those you got to understand
[22:48] whatever man is thinking that's why I
[22:51] had to come repent about the camera and
[22:54] all that stuff because even for a moment
[22:56] I was anointed it sounded like a joke
[22:59] but a spirit that came from a spirit
[23:01] didn't come from the Holy Ghost so if it
[23:04] wasn't from the Holy Ghost it came from
[23:05] the devil and if you got a recognize an
[23:07] individual that when you when you speak
[23:10] or say something that's contrary to the
[23:12] word is that right
[23:14] the Bible said Jesus made of himself no
[23:17] reputation so when you find an
[23:19] individual whoever it may be trying to
[23:22] establish a reputation that is not of
[23:26] God here the God of all heaven and earth
[23:29] the Bible said he humbled himself like a
[23:31] man and became a servant he wasn't
[23:34] looking for reputation hallelujah
[23:39] he was so humble they didn't even see
[23:42] him they didn't even know him Judas had
[23:45] to portray him by kids see you got to
[23:51] understand that our thoughts is in the
[23:54] spiritual realm you can't see it you
[23:57] can't feel it you can't taste them yet
[24:00] they are just as real probably more real
[24:04] than the things that we see in touch
[24:06] thoughts are tangible to the mind right
[24:11] because thoughts you know I can say
[24:13] faint
[24:14] operates in that way fake all those
[24:17] things that be not as though they were
[24:19] and we can get the thoughts of God in us
[24:23] like with these stripes we are healed
[24:27] your thoughts not based upon your
[24:28] feelings but his thoughts says we are
[24:31] healed nothing can withstand that
[24:34] absolutely but if you got a double mind
[24:36] about it a man that's good and evil make
[24:39] the good tree good or make it evil right
[24:42] he's talking about you and me you and I
[24:44] have a charge we can make the tree good
[24:46] or we can make it evil but when is good
[24:50] and evil it's got to go that that is not
[24:54] what God is looking for in this hour
[24:56] he's looking for the good tree and the
[24:58] good tree is the tree of life and in the
[25:01] Tree of Life there are no there is no
[25:03] death
[25:03] right so you so oh that's why the Bible
[25:07] said cast down every thought that exalts
[25:09] itself against the word ha because you
[25:14] will become it whatever that thought is
[25:17] that exalted self against the word
[25:19] Lucifer said I will a sin did he not the
[25:23] very thing he said he became now Lucifer
[25:27] which we call Satan is the god of this
[25:29] evil age right see and the thing about
[25:33] it people of God it's like is like this
[25:36] when you think when you catch the mind
[25:38] of God that's why we need to meditate we
[25:40] need to take that word of God and apply
[25:43] to ourselves God this word is me I was
[25:46] trying to tell the people of God this I
[25:48] said this Bible is you because you are
[25:51] the thoughts and attributes of God but
[25:54] you and I have come to be made manifest
[25:56] what Oh
[25:57] God didn't send me to say Oh Isaiah
[26:00] brushes now hit the earth that's not my
[26:03] purpose my purpose is to reflect the
[26:06] light and thought of God for my day so
[26:10] are you
[26:11] we're here to respect the life the light
[26:13] right the Bible said in the beginning
[26:16] was well uh yeah let me say it like the
[26:18] hard st. John says that that word let me
[26:23] read it let me read it it's right there
[26:26] in front of us you know we look at this
[26:28] thing and we shall oh the light was the
[26:34] light was the light life of me I like
[26:38] that I like that because it says it
[26:40] Word was made flesh and that light was
[26:42] what the light of men in the beginning
[26:45] was the word the Word was with God and
[26:47] the Word was God right in him the fourth
[26:53] first jumping down in him was life and
[26:56] the life was the light of live right the
[27:02] light in a number one light the
[27:04] revelation that was in Christ that life
[27:07] that light what was in Christ was the
[27:09] life of me it was the revelation of what
[27:12] men are to be we never knew as you heard
[27:16] me say previously you and I have never
[27:18] known what a real man supposed to be
[27:20] like but Jesus Christ reflected what the
[27:24] life of man supposed to be right because
[27:28] he had the thought of God the Bible said
[27:31] he had the mind of God he thought it not
[27:35] robbery to be equal with him so people
[27:38] of God the Bride of Christ must meditate
[27:40] on the world and you and I must come to
[27:42] a place that we do not think that we
[27:45] robbing God by being equal is that the
[27:51] word because he poured himself into us
[27:54] there's not a lesser God maybe you got a
[27:57] smaller portion but you are just as
[28:00] potent as the God of heaven as long as
[28:05] we think I said to be less see you and I
[28:08] have been born-again those of us who
[28:10] have been sealed with all the ghosts you
[28:11] are the Living Word of God the very
[28:15] thought of God manifested in what we
[28:18] call this evil age and so we are and we
[28:23] must carry ourselves like that not
[28:26] trying to find a reputation not trying
[28:28] to be a big guy a great God but to keep
[28:31] humble before God so that when God wants
[28:35] to use us he can use us and we won't be
[28:38] afraid when you think okay listen what
[28:47] it says cast down every thought that
[28:50] exalt what it self
[28:54] self is a character it's a person itself
[29:02] so there itself against every thought
[29:05] that exalts itself so the thought comes
[29:08] from some self somebody someone and that
[29:13] someone is the devil the same one that
[29:16] whispered and Eve's ear is still
[29:18] whispering in the ears of Lee right
[29:21] so whatever the devil brings to you that
[29:24] is against God you must put it under
[29:27] your feet ooh thoughts can be powerful
[29:39] how do they come from one brother rich
[29:43] you know he I was thinking about that
[29:47] the other day and I really said
[29:48] something to you know why do we have
[29:51] airplane pilots and everybody can't be
[29:54] one why do we have engineers and
[29:56] everybody can't be engineers why do we
[29:58] have painters and artists and everything
[30:00] everybody can't be the same thing but
[30:03] God put all of these gifts and
[30:05] individuals and these individuals had to
[30:08] believe they could be it
[30:10] you understand me they had to believe
[30:14] that they could be it and then God took
[30:16] all these things together to what
[30:18] produce his thought to make sure his
[30:23] word comes to pass is that right also
[30:28] true somebody had to make the car cuz
[30:31] the Prophet said there was a chariot
[30:33] they didn't have horses somebody had to
[30:37] produce amen the plane right somebody
[30:41] had to mechanically go into the science
[30:44] of making planes because Israel had to
[30:46] fly back on the eagle see all of these
[30:49] things and and you know I can't make no
[30:52] plate I don't even know how to begin
[30:53] I don't even know how this up had work
[30:56] more or less but somebody had to do all
[30:59] of this why because the Bible says in
[31:02] the last day knowledge will increase
[31:06] hallelujah
[31:08] see all these things have to seeing in
[31:11] all that because you said all the whole
[31:13] I saw those two prophets without
[31:15] satellite without these things that
[31:18] we're not experiencing and then they
[31:21] would have been in a way that we the
[31:23] world would have seen Moses and Elijah
[31:25] laying in the street see so all of these
[31:29] things had to be and you say what do you
[31:31] mean those were the thoughts of God if
[31:34] those spots are so real and in an
[31:37] engineer found his place a painter found
[31:40] his place in that a mathematician found
[31:42] his place how can the bride not find her
[31:45] place and where is her place he said if
[31:49] you overcome I will grant with you to
[31:52] sit in my throne even as I have said in
[31:55] my father's song Jesus praying said
[31:58] father I would the baby one even as we
[32:02] hallelujah that word it's a thought of
[32:05] God that we would be one with him he's
[32:08] not my thought is his star I receive it
[32:12] hallelujah
[32:13] I wanted hallelujah help me give Jesus
[32:16] to yield
[32:17] amen to that thought that I will become
[32:20] one with you that's how powerful
[32:23] thoughts are because those thoughts
[32:26] becomes words and those words amen on
[32:28] what we're feeding on but you'll never
[32:30] understand what these words are unto you
[32:33] many man it meditate on it the word when
[32:35] he says my word they are spirit so then
[32:38] this thing on the page must become
[32:42] spirit to you all over again that's
[32:44] where the revelation is where do they
[32:51] come from
[32:52] as I said Ebola good yes the truth right
[32:58] you know seed
[33:00] I said say there was a tree of knowledge
[33:01] of good and evil now what are we doing
[33:03] there because he he infiltrated the
[33:05] human race we are now a manifestation of
[33:10] the act that they did we are born now
[33:13] good and evil see have we eat off the
[33:18] Tree of Life
[33:19] we were all been life-death wouldn't
[33:22] have been nowhere near us but because we
[33:26] ate of the tree of good and evil that's
[33:28] what we are
[33:28] now we're now bad eating off of the Tree
[33:32] of Life that's what this message is
[33:36] Alleluia is Jesus Christ revealed to us
[33:39] and who is the Tree of Life Jesus Christ
[33:42] we wouldn't have known that but it took
[33:45] a prophet to tell us that both of the
[33:46] three Jesus Christ died and so did
[33:48] Lucifer stood right there in the Garden
[33:52] of Eden and a tree was there to do what
[33:54] bear forth fruit Judah
[34:05] see so you and I must understand a man
[34:08] that the thoughts is spirit and if you
[34:14] received the thought you received the
[34:16] spirit of the thought because remember
[34:22] Amen you are what you eat that is the
[34:25] truth and the Bible said that
[34:27] spiritually he ate of the tree right
[34:31] she ate of it he said oh how the Bible
[34:34] said that she found that what he was
[34:36] saying was good and pleasant and they
[34:39] did eat see so she in her spirit Amen
[34:43] she received this now she is what
[34:46] because he promised her that you'll be a
[34:49] god but he didn't say he didn't tell her
[34:52] that she was already a God in the gods
[34:53] and the god narrow she's a God but she's
[34:58] up the world see now you saw all brother
[35:01] Bruce how could I say it
[35:09] this is why brother battle-ax uses a
[35:11] term he said a of a wheat germ in a
[35:15] a burro
[35:16] because the spirit of a kookaburra is
[35:20] different from the spirit of a wheat and
[35:22] though they may look alike that once
[35:25] that wheat germ is in a kookaburra and
[35:28] is brought to life it's no longer gonna
[35:30] behave like a kookaburra it's gonna
[35:33] behave like a weed seeing as how it is
[35:36] with us because of the seed of God in us
[35:38] and understand me that's why the Word of
[35:41] God the perfect way of receiving the
[35:43] Holy Ghost is by hearing the word
[35:46] because God said let there be light that
[35:49] spirit of that those words hit those hit
[35:52] those seeds and those seeds came to life
[35:55] that's how it is in the preaching that's
[35:57] why if a person can actually catch the
[35:59] spirit of what's being said because out
[36:03] of the Marvel of reason though you don't
[36:05] see it it's eternal fire eternal fire
[36:08] comes through these lips because you
[36:11] can't give something you don't have but
[36:14] once the Holy Ghost is in there and the
[36:16] inspiration is now being moved a man is
[36:19] being moved not by my thoughts where all
[36:21] these thoughts come you don't see me
[36:22] like this these thoughts are now coming
[36:25] from somewhere and I'm preaching I'm
[36:29] saying what he wants me to say and if we
[36:33] could take the faith and catch it it
[36:35] will owe in a set us on fire that God
[36:39] Amen spoke to me and I heard him
[36:42] hallelujah and look what he's doing for
[36:44] me now I am you got it you looking at
[36:47] brother Brooks oh brother Brooks a good
[36:49] message you don't understand you missing
[36:51] the whole spiritual application behind
[36:53] this whole thing God has used me as a
[36:55] channel to speak to you to bring life
[36:58] see that's how it all works is that all
[37:01] right thoughts in itself can either set
[37:04] you free a blind you right
[37:07] remember Johnny crow in his mind he
[37:11] could not allow himself to be free it
[37:13] wasn't he wasn't free but he had been
[37:16] tied up so long by the master to when he
[37:19] cut the card
[37:20] Johnny crow could never think about him
[37:23] himself being free and that's the way a
[37:25] lot of Christians are you're free
[37:28] you've been delivered but you know a lot
[37:31] of time we can't see it because Amen we
[37:33] we've been so long tired up and we've
[37:36] been so long in prison we don't even
[37:38] realize that God done set us free it's a
[37:41] true sometimes we want we want the
[37:43] Pentecostals periods we want feelings
[37:46] and goosebumps and all that stuff oh you
[37:48] know if I cut a cord you won't feel it
[37:50] the fact is you're free because the
[37:54] Bible said he whom the Sun sets free is
[37:56] free indeed and where the Spirit of the
[37:59] Lord is there is Liberty but the devil
[38:04] will make us feel because you anchor it
[38:06] up in our thoughts in our minds you know
[38:09] you got to have it and that's what
[38:11] happened to a lot of druggies you know
[38:14] you got to have it you got to do it you
[38:16] got to do nothing right great as he does
[38:20] in us than he that is in the world so
[38:23] you ain't gotta do nothing it's what
[38:25] you're listening to if you're gonna
[38:27] listen to the false preachers you're
[38:29] gonna get the false preachers result if
[38:32] you're gonna listen to the Holy Spirit
[38:33] talk to you and then you're gonna get
[38:35] the Holy Spirit results this is all to
[38:38] it is that right you not must understand
[38:47] him and by God's grace we are blessed
[38:59] how many I believe the Bible says
[39:02] according 54-17 no weapon I'll just
[39:10] believe that that spirit to me that's
[39:12] life to me no matter what the devil
[39:15] tries no weapon is that right was it
[39:24] chaotic to Jesus when he was on the boat
[39:26] he didn't care about all his the
[39:29] panicking of those disciples he didn't
[39:31] get up all nervous and all shook up
[39:33] hallelujah he got a peaceful and calm
[39:36] and then he said o ye of little faith
[39:39] where did you doubt see God had already
[39:42] given him the authority over the wind I
[39:45] seen people it's the truth we were on
[39:48] our way to the church I spoke to the
[39:50] wind and the rain I'm not saying nobody
[39:52] else didn't do it but I saw God somebody
[39:55] some say but cut off you wish your wife
[39:56] is just gonna stop and brother God is my
[39:59] witness
[40:00] Craig was there the think crystal was in
[40:03] the car at a time yes and it stopped
[40:06] there's no glory to me he told me I pray
[40:10] I said God we want a real meeting we
[40:12] want a dim meeting I know you got things
[40:14] to do I know this rain is for our
[40:16] purpose but the Lord if you will could
[40:19] you please stop the rain and bring a
[40:22] little cool I can't remem all I said but
[40:24] one thing I'm saying it happened God
[40:27] brought the rain several days it
[40:30] happened the same way no clouds in the
[40:32] sky no you know thunderstorm cloud all
[40:35] of a sudden clouds come in from
[40:36] somewhere brain and cooled it off and
[40:42] when the job was over dinner temperature
[40:43] shot back up very noticeable everybody's
[40:47] everyone's seen it
[40:48] see when you trying to do God's will is
[40:51] like God said to Joshua says Lord Sun
[40:53] stand still see that's the saying God we
[40:57] serve it's your purpose it's the reason
[41:00] why you want God to do things you see
[41:02] but if it's takfir this kingdom and to
[41:04] do things for his kingdom god will do
[41:06] just for you no weapon that is formed
[41:09] against these your prosper in every time
[41:13] that Shiraz against be in judgment thou
[41:15] shalt convinced there will be one town
[41:18] not all I saw him do this oh yes she did
[41:21] this man there won't be one tongue cuz
[41:25] you know who the heck accusing is the
[41:27] devil daughter you listen to it he don't
[41:30] care about what accuses what the
[41:32] accusers say concerning you the Bobby
[41:34] said you justify your free don't let the
[41:39] devil accuse you in your mind
[41:41] oh you're lost I can't not be lost I've
[41:45] been elected before the foundation where
[41:47] oh but you're doing this yes he's still
[41:50] working on me
[41:53] he's they're working on me
[41:57] this is the heritage of the servants of
[42:00] the Lord and their righteousness is what
[42:04] of being that was one of those
[42:09] scriptures brothers brother you know
[42:11] I've seen it many times but you know our
[42:13] brother Richard shot that there'd be one
[42:14] time I'm like that that's good and I've
[42:16] been holding on to it since so no weapon
[42:20] that is formed against me shall prosper
[42:22] and every time that your rise against
[42:25] the in judgment thou shalt condemn this
[42:29] is the heritage of the servants of the
[42:31] Lord and their righteousness is of Lee
[42:35] saith the Lord that means the Lord
[42:37] sayeth hallelujah hit our
[42:40] righteousnesses of him who's gonna like
[42:42] lay any charge that's why Paul says to
[42:45] Godsey liquor ain't nobody goin King
[42:49] okay no no no no he said that's the
[42:55] reason I do believe that when the bride
[42:57] is called
[42:58] out and elected and set in the book of
[43:00] life there will come a sound from heaven
[43:03] that it takes such a baptism of the holy
[43:05] spirit into that bride that'll take her
[43:09] from the earth in a rapture in grace God
[43:12] promises don't care how many science how
[43:15] many astronauts they sign up everything
[43:18] else and how many millions miles they
[43:21] can you see I don't care nothing about
[43:24] that there is a heaven there
[43:26] is a literal Jesus Christ there that
[43:29] will come in a body form to receive the
[43:32] church his church to himself no matter
[43:34] how old the story scene is still the
[43:38] truth I don't care all y'all been saying
[43:41] about the rapture it's coming how do you
[43:43] know it's here in me hallelujah I'm a
[43:47] witness of the rapture because the
[43:49] resurrection is living in me it's just
[43:56] about believing listen ah he says listen
[43:59] God said I am the Lord heals all that
[44:02] diseases I am God and I changed my amen
[44:05] God is the word and if God don't change
[44:08] how is the word going to change see I am
[44:12] God and I changed not the scripture says
[44:15] that God said it himself that if he can
[44:18] and if he cannot change then he is the
[44:22] word in the beginning was the word the
[44:24] Word was God the Word was God the
[44:28] unchangeable word right the Word was
[44:31] made flesh and dwelt among us so that's
[44:34] what I'm saying if God is in you if God
[44:37] is in me if God is in anybody everybody
[44:39] that ain't that declare that God is in
[44:41] them it has to be made manifest it
[44:44] cannot be worse service lip service it
[44:47] has to be made manifest in other words
[44:50] it must be vindicated Mary was
[44:54] vindicated that she was a virgin there
[44:57] were a lot of mergers in Mary day but
[44:59] Mary was the virgin right and she was
[45:02] vindicated by what becoming impregnated
[45:05] with Christ and that's the bride of
[45:07] Jesus Christ
[45:08] she must become vindicated she has to be
[45:11] indicate how is it that God Himself
[45:14] steps into you to vindicate you brother
[45:17] Branham couldn't vindicate himself that
[45:19] was the Holy Spirit that vindicated him
[45:21] we he didn't for a long time he didn't
[45:25] even know he was a prophet of the age
[45:27] God vindicated him oh you said all what
[45:32] about the third pole he couldn't just
[45:34] turn it on when he wanted to God in his
[45:37] season turned it on
[45:40] so is it with us you can't turn on being
[45:43] the bride but at least you ought to know
[45:45] you're there you ought to know you're
[45:47] close to it however you know one thing
[45:50] that something is different about you is
[45:53] that right
[45:54] you're following in the steps of Enoch
[45:56] people do you really think that he
[46:00] Nadja's all of a sudden please God he
[46:04] had to walk with God to please God and
[46:08] you got to walk with God to please him
[46:11] the Bible doesn't say anything about
[46:14] Emax he knocks failures but you know
[46:18] they were there he was a man but whom
[46:24] God justify who do you go and his
[46:27] election hello he was born of a woman he
[46:31] didn't come here about no spaceship
[46:35] death was all in his body but he got a
[46:38] word from the Lord hallelujah and every
[46:41] time God would say some even say yes
[46:44] Lord yes Lord yes Lord see that's how
[46:47] you walk with God you say yes Lord
[46:50] whether you can do it or not you say yes
[46:53] Lord hallelujah
[46:55] see think about it that God let me I'm a
[47:01] clothes I'm not going to be I didn't
[47:02] plan to be long but think about it think
[47:05] about this scripture now I said a
[47:06] thought because you understand this is
[47:09] God thought God had conned in sin I
[47:13] don't need to write though he came here
[47:16] or he wrote on the wall in Babylon and
[47:18] he wrote on the earth when Jesus finger
[47:21] but Jesus finger he didn't have to write
[47:24] God don't go to school
[47:26] God created his school for us if you
[47:30] want to put it at learning for us now
[47:32] Adam didn't happen learn by way the way
[47:34] we learn we learned this way because of
[47:36] the fall think our faithful God is that
[47:40] he would even take the fall and produce
[47:44] his product through it now win us all
[47:48] over we will need school
[47:50] but Satan calls this thing
[47:54] so God used satyrs methods of Education
[47:57] to educate us hallelujah
[48:00] but when God want to talk to you he'd
[48:02] get rid of all of that right
[48:05] he took Moses in the bathroom desert
[48:07] right forty years he beat out everything
[48:10] Satan put in him so that he could
[48:13] receive a revelation of who he was and
[48:16] what his calling
[48:17] see that's what God does he don't need
[48:20] your reason he don't need my reasoning
[48:22] because your reasoning is that you have
[48:25] a thought that is resisting God you
[48:29] don't need it I don't need it right just
[48:32] may be dumb enough to follow him see and
[48:36] say a man to everything he says that's
[48:39] all I need to be but behold what manner
[48:42] of love is this that's why Jesus said
[48:45] listen how who was the son of God who
[48:48] was actually the God manifested in flesh
[48:51] he said I came doing nothing except the
[48:54] father show me now you think that Jesus
[48:57] Christ as a man wasn't intelligent very
[49:01] intelligent he was the most intelligent
[49:03] man ever walk the face of the earth but
[49:05] he waited he wouldn't he wouldn't use
[49:08] his own thoughts to do nothing and he
[49:13] was so he was so United that whenever at
[49:16] the spirit mu he booed is that right
[49:18] that that's just how not think about it
[49:21] the four living creatures of salt United
[49:24] with God they don't move about said
[49:26] wherever the spirit move they move they
[49:31] never move backwards always forward see
[49:34] and that's that's when you know the
[49:37] Spirit is moving you or the thoughts of
[49:39] God are leading you because you're not
[49:40] going backwards you're going forward one
[49:45] more thought
[49:57] he said I asked the question a Christian
[50:01] that's Christ in you and if Christ is in
[50:05] you then the word is in you and then if
[50:09] the word is in you when the light is
[50:12] shining how you're going to walk out of
[50:14] it see
[50:15] that's the question that's what is now
[50:18] the light the evening light shining the
[50:21] bride tree is blooming see so you and I
[50:26] must understand what is all about he
[50:30] says listen but if we if it becomes a
[50:34] real revelation of God that you see it
[50:36] before it happens and express it in Word
[50:39] form that word takes a hold and become
[50:43] material I'm gonna read that again but
[50:46] if it becomes a real revelation a real
[50:50] revelation comes to you an example you
[50:52] heal and he says that you see it before
[50:56] it happened somehow you see it it's
[50:59] gonna happen and express it in Word form
[51:04] like for instance goggled bless me I can
[51:09] feel it I eat I ask God for a car he
[51:12] gonna give me that I can see it now you
[51:14] don't see with your natural but your
[51:15] spirit that caught it and he says when
[51:18] you say it it will take form
[51:21] see that word takes a hold and becomes a
[51:26] material a thought expressed oh my how
[51:29] God could see your heart and your mind
[51:32] is so and filled with God's Spirit until
[51:35] your thoughts become his thoughts amen
[51:37] there you are when your mind and you'll
[51:41] excuse me win your mind and your leading
[51:45] and your guiding becomes a direct place
[51:48] or a direct inspiration of the Holy
[51:51] Spirit that's moving your mortal being
[51:53] he's it all mine he said what kind of
[51:56] people should we be if the very Holy
[51:59] Spirit has - if the very Holy Spirit has
[52:03] used so embalm
[52:05] or empowered that you don't use your own
[52:08] thoughts you don't use your own line you
[52:11] don't use your own opinion but the Holy
[52:14] Spirit has you saw built unto your
[52:17] thoughts and your being is God's Spirit
[52:21] expressing itself through you he said
[52:23] what what kind of a church we would be
[52:27] right see and they that our sons of God
[52:31] are led by the Spirit of God then when
[52:33] the human element goes out and the
[52:35] Spirit of God feels that they can see
[52:37] where you empty yourself a man then will
[52:41] be then will be will be when the church
[52:46] in his power of the resurrection of the
[52:48] Lord Jesus we're walking a step in his
[52:51] power in his thoughts it is being and
[52:53] it's moving he says see see what I mean
[52:55] he said then your thoughts will become
[52:57] words in your words we become
[53:00] materialized he said that's when the
[53:02] church is in its power you and I have
[53:06] been so yielded to his thought become
[53:09] our thought and all things become
[53:12] possible to them that believe Amen less
