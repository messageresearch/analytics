[44:25] what a wonderful song service we've been
[44:28] having some good ones lately
[44:30] so we thank god for the brethren who
[44:34] sacrificed themselves with their talents
[44:39] we appreciate that
[44:48] amen we're going to be coming from
[44:51] ii john
[44:55] the 12th verse
[45:00] from there we'll go to proverbs 27.
[45:09] and then from there we'll go to second
[45:11] chronicles 13
[45:13] 10 and 11.
[45:16] you love the lord
[45:19] second epistles of john
[45:23] the 12th verse
[45:29] and it reads having many things to write
[45:32] unto you i would not write with paper
[45:36] and
[45:36] ink but i trust to come unto you
[45:41] and speak face to face that our joy
[45:46] may be full the children of thy elected
[45:51] sister greet thee
[45:53] amen one more
[45:56] uh let's go now to proverbs 27 19
[46:01] proverbs 27 19.
[46:07] i love this scripture i've read it
[46:09] before but i'm gonna use it again
[46:11] for what we're doing tonight
[46:19] did i say proverbs 27 okay
[46:23] proverbs 27 19.
[46:29] and it reads as
[46:32] in water face answers to face
[46:37] so the heart of man to man
[46:48] ii chronicles
[47:00] the 13th chapter
[47:12] i'm glad that the lord god has grace and
[47:14] mercy
[47:20] he had to place us in this day and time
[47:23] because
[47:24] otherwise we would not have survived
[47:29] we are in an age and where the bible
[47:31] said we'll be
[47:33] wiser and weaker
[47:37] second chronicles 13 will read the 10th
[47:40] verse
[47:47] but as for us
[47:50] the lord is our god
[47:54] and we have not forsaken him
[47:58] and the priests which ministered unto
[48:01] the lord are the sons of aaron and
[48:03] the levites wait upon their business
[48:07] and they burn unto the lord every
[48:09] morning and every
[48:10] evening burnt sacrifice and sweet
[48:13] incense
[48:15] the shoe bread are also set they in
[48:18] order upon
[48:19] the pure table and the candlesticks of
[48:22] gold with the lamps thereof
[48:24] to burn every evening for we
[48:28] charge should be for we keep the charge
[48:31] of the lord our god
[48:34] but ye have forsaken
[48:38] him
[48:42] it does something
[48:48] let us have a word of prayer
[48:56] heavenly father we thank you right now
[48:57] for your grace and your mercy
[49:00] we thank you for being so good to us
[49:05] lord we come in a time
[49:08] the world is falling apart
[49:12] men is calling right wrong and wrong
[49:15] right
[49:16] they can't discern between good and evil
[49:20] have mercy upon us lord
[49:24] wash us clean cleanse us from all
[49:27] iniquity and any wicked thing
[49:30] we may do what we may have done
[49:33] let your blood lord jesus continue to be
[49:36] with us
[49:37] let your grace and your mercy o god
[49:39] abide with us day
[49:40] and night and father we'll be careful to
[49:43] give you the praise glory and honor
[49:46] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[49:50] you may be seated
[49:55] just the other day
[49:59] i was thinking on the word
[50:03] and
[50:06] i was asking the lord in my spirit
[50:13] what is the time and why do we
[50:17] need to preach something different
[50:23] in such a simple way
[50:28] he spoke to my heart and said you are
[50:29] composed of
[50:31] body spirit and soul
[50:35] and each one of those rams have already
[50:38] been made manifest
[50:41] luther represented justification which
[50:44] was the body
[50:46] wesley represented sanctification which
[50:50] was the spirit
[50:52] and the pentecostals rep represented the
[50:55] baptism of the holy ghost
[50:58] which is so sold
[51:02] and if you notice that even in the
[51:07] diagram of the ark of the covenant
[51:12] or solomon's temple however you want to
[51:14] put it
[51:15] there was an outer court there was an
[51:18] intercourt and there was
[51:20] a holies of holies the outer court was
[51:23] where the brazen altar was that's when
[51:25] you came to
[51:26] christ and you justified and you died to
[51:30] yourself
[51:31] and your will and then you had to move
[51:35] into the holy place where the seven
[51:37] golden candlesticks were
[51:40] there you were to be sanctified
[51:45] and of course the journey wasn't
[51:47] complete until you got behind
[51:50] the veil of god which is the holies of
[51:53] holies
[51:55] what was preached to you
[51:59] at the brazen altar
[52:02] cannot be preached to you
[52:06] in the holy place
[52:10] and what is preached to you in the holy
[52:11] place
[52:13] cannot minister to you and will not be
[52:16] ministered to you
[52:18] in the holies of holies
[52:21] and you and i know that we've been
[52:23] talking about the
[52:25] statue of a perfect man i had
[52:29] uh brother john legue could do this for
[52:32] me
[52:34] and it was just the ideal thing of what
[52:36] i wanted
[52:38] because i wanted you to see that the the
[52:41] crowning or the capping of the pyramid
[52:43] was the
[52:44] mighty cloud of god
[52:48] in 1963
[52:51] at his coming we know by god's grace
[52:55] that
[52:56] the world didn't see it but it was
[53:00] placed in a may 17
[53:04] 1963 life magazine
[53:08] on one page it was the seven angels in
[53:12] their display and on the other page it
[53:15] was the mighty rainbow
[53:17] just like he says in the book of
[53:19] revelation
[53:21] i wanted to be careful i have that book
[53:23] if anybody ever want to see it
[53:25] i wanted to be careful on how i'm saying
[53:27] things because
[53:29] before coming out here the word of god
[53:31] spoke to my heart not to
[53:33] casters pearls among swines
[53:37] and the reason why i say that because i
[53:38] know a lot of people are listening
[53:41] i say a lot but few of them are um
[53:44] you know we we we we must uh
[53:47] revere this message greater than we
[53:51] have been doing you remember the time
[53:55] when we
[53:57] our bibles were so reverent and revered
[54:00] hallowed you know we were
[54:04] we were very careful with it there was a
[54:07] time you know
[54:08] uh the children in in in in the house
[54:12] could play with every book but the bible
[54:14] it was a sacred book it was a holy book
[54:17] and you know
[54:18] it was so holy to us we carried it
[54:20] everywhere we went
[54:21] would go as a christian we want the
[54:24] shame of it
[54:26] y'all hear what i'm saying you and i
[54:29] must understand that this bible has
[54:31] changed those who claim to be christians
[54:34] have
[54:37] we say we're not ashamed of him but our
[54:40] action speaks
[54:42] louder than our words
[54:46] one thing i want to say is that we can't
[54:49] stay here
[54:52] you see the political realm moving
[54:55] everything's changing
[54:56] the move is on for the bride and if you
[54:59] think it's going to get better you are
[55:01] deceived
[55:02] it's going to get worse perhaps worse
[55:05] than you ever
[55:06] thought it could get uh would be
[55:13] even when this seven angels came down
[55:16] and displayed themselves out there in
[55:19] arizona
[55:20] around in mexico going up there like
[55:22] that and
[55:23] the bible uh we've been told that when
[55:25] you know judgment struck
[55:27] struck the west coast that uh california
[55:29] and washington almost sunk
[55:32] and judgment has been moving ever since
[55:36] but you've heard me say by god's grace
[55:38] that uh
[55:40] even the prophet of god did not even
[55:42] know what was taking place until
[55:44] the lord told him to turn it right
[55:48] and he kind of go over this in the
[55:50] message try to do godless service
[55:52] without his will
[55:53] in 1965 where the holy spirit said turn
[55:56] it right
[55:58] he thought maybe the voice means turn
[56:01] it to the right and when i did you see
[56:05] what it is hoffman head of christ at 33.
[56:09] here look in here see his black beard
[56:13] his face his eyes his nose and
[56:15] everything else see the part in his hair
[56:18] here coming up and he's wigged
[56:21] with that white angel wig to show
[56:24] that the message of him being god is
[56:26] true
[56:27] yes sir y'all believe he's god amen
[56:31] he is the supreme judge of the universe
[56:34] supreme judge of heaven and earth he is
[56:38] god
[56:39] and nothing else but god he is god
[56:42] expressed in human form called the son
[56:44] of god
[56:46] which the son was a man and if
[56:49] that don't make our message exactly
[56:51] right
[56:53] identified by the scriptures identified
[56:55] in service
[56:57] identified by his presence the same
[56:59] yesterday
[57:00] today and forever therefore those seven
[57:03] seals
[57:04] are the truth brethren might disagree
[57:07] with them
[57:08] but just set down and study it with your
[57:11] open heart one
[57:12] time just let the holy spirit lead you
[57:15] from you see he was really telling us
[57:18] there was a changing
[57:20] in the time and god was moving on the
[57:23] domination
[57:24] organization that's why they're all in
[57:27] such a state of apostasy
[57:29] and many of them are serving but they're
[57:31] serving the wrong god
[57:34] because according to revelations the
[57:35] third chapter jesus christ is
[57:38] outside of the door trying to get in
[57:42] what it is that we have pushed
[57:46] uh uh uh how could i say it everything
[57:49] in but christ
[57:51] we have made our church
[57:54] a setting for hollywood we have our
[57:58] dramas we have our actors we have our
[58:00] music we have our dancing
[58:02] we have everything that's gotten so bad
[58:04] to people are choreographing everything
[58:06] just like hollywood when they film i
[58:09] remember the time years ago i went to
[58:11] ptl
[58:12] just to visit them and i could remember
[58:14] the time that the choir would be singing
[58:16] oh my
[58:17] it sounds so spiritual and then they say
[58:19] cut then they stop
[58:21] singing and the choir go over there
[58:22] making jokes laughing and playing
[58:25] and when they try to tell them okay it's
[58:26] almost time to come back up on the stage
[58:28] they get up and they get back up there
[58:30] and they act it out again
[58:33] it was a sad experience for me to see
[58:37] that people had made god's business
[58:40] a business of acting oh and they could
[58:43] literally
[58:44] cry and they would bring the drama and
[58:46] they'd bring in
[58:47] all of the money you know and things
[58:49] what they do
[58:51] but god did catch up with them right
[58:55] they did fall i'm saying all of this
[58:58] because i read that first scripture
[59:01] so that you understand that there's an
[59:04] event taking place that we must
[59:06] understand
[59:07] that god god wants to see your face
[59:11] and god want to see you see his face
[59:18] and the bible tells us you know i love
[59:20] the scripture because
[59:22] every scripture testifies of jesus
[59:24] christ
[59:26] and as in water faith answers to face
[59:29] sow the heart of man to man
[59:32] one thing about the face it tells who
[59:35] you are
[59:38] and one thing about your face you know
[59:41] it when you see it
[59:43] and all the water is is a reflection of
[59:46] you
[59:49] and this is what god wants us to see
[59:51] that
[59:52] this body of christ you understand the
[59:54] body
[59:56] the body of christ goes all the way up
[1:00:01] but the head of the body is jesus christ
[1:00:05] is that the scripture so we understand
[1:00:08] that what happened is
[1:00:10] everything can become ritualistic
[1:00:14] and this is what happened to israel
[1:00:18] even during the time of jeroboam we find
[1:00:20] out that
[1:00:21] that the priest you know
[1:00:24] aaron and all of the rest had been
[1:00:27] faithful in their
[1:00:29] duties but to the people it became
[1:00:33] common
[1:00:36] and once this message become common to
[1:00:38] you
[1:00:41] you have forsaken god
[1:00:46] when it becomes common
[1:00:50] you reject your priesthood
[1:00:55] because the bible calls us priests and
[1:00:57] kings
[1:01:00] but the priests all of them at all time
[1:01:02] had to be
[1:01:04] sanctified they had to be
[1:01:07] cleansed they had to be proper
[1:01:11] in order to handle the working of the
[1:01:12] lord
[1:01:16] because that place was holy
[1:01:21] remember the time amen before the fall
[1:01:24] adam and eve was
[1:01:25] in a holy place a place of consecration
[1:01:29] a place where they could hear from god
[1:01:30] and and they could see his face
[1:01:33] because the bible said that his voice
[1:01:35] will walk in the cool of the evening
[1:01:39] but one day his voice walked the
[1:01:41] fellowship so he got to understand like
[1:01:43] this and i i'm going to come in just a
[1:01:45] moment
[1:01:47] god has come to establish or reestablish
[1:01:51] the fellowship with his wife his bride
[1:01:55] his people and god you know it's one of
[1:01:59] the worst things you can do
[1:02:01] and i have to pray about it sometimes
[1:02:03] because when
[1:02:04] when you're talking with someone they
[1:02:06] want to see
[1:02:07] you eye to eye they want to see your
[1:02:10] face
[1:02:12] and it's so rude when somebody's talking
[1:02:14] to you and you go this way
[1:02:16] or you go this way or you go this way
[1:02:19] and then you you realize that you you
[1:02:22] you you're being disrespectful
[1:02:25] especially when someone is talking to
[1:02:28] you
[1:02:29] and that's the way it is when we come to
[1:02:31] the bot to the church
[1:02:32] is god speaking it's not me i'm under an
[1:02:36] inspiration
[1:02:37] these are not my thoughts
[1:02:41] i i can't own them
[1:02:44] they're gods and when we began to speak
[1:02:48] amen if you can really revere it
[1:02:50] reverence it
[1:02:52] you'll walk out here in a different way
[1:02:57] face to face is my topic
[1:03:00] god wants to speak face to face with you
[1:03:07] hallelujah is that all right i can
[1:03:10] remember the bible says
[1:03:12] when adam and eve had fallen of course
[1:03:16] they had been used to the voice of god
[1:03:18] they fellowshipped with him
[1:03:21] and they heard the voice of the lord god
[1:03:23] walking in the garden in the cooler that
[1:03:24] went of the day
[1:03:25] and adam and his wife hid themselves
[1:03:28] from the presence of the lord
[1:03:30] god amongst the trees of the garden
[1:03:33] and isn't that what that right that's
[1:03:35] what we do many people don't come to
[1:03:37] church because they're trying to hide
[1:03:40] right and a lot of times people don't
[1:03:42] really want the preacher to be anointed
[1:03:44] to preach
[1:03:45] he they really don't want you to go into
[1:03:46] their lives they're trying to hide
[1:03:51] but when you find yourself hiding it
[1:03:54] shows that you are
[1:03:55] naked somewhere satan
[1:03:59] has stripped you
[1:04:03] but the believer you and i would should
[1:04:05] always say
[1:04:06] amen to the word so be it
[1:04:09] lord if i'm naked clothe me
[1:04:13] and the lord god called unto adam and
[1:04:15] said unto him where art thou
[1:04:18] there was a question with the young
[1:04:19] people the other day why did god ask
[1:04:21] that question if he's god
[1:04:23] god knew where he was but god wanted to
[1:04:26] know
[1:04:27] wanted adam to know where he was adam
[1:04:30] was in a place he had never been before
[1:04:33] he had always been in the presence of
[1:04:35] the lord but now he's feeling something
[1:04:37] else
[1:04:38] he's feeling disconnected
[1:04:41] and the god that was once his friend
[1:04:43] he's now
[1:04:44] afraid of him because the word of god
[1:04:47] amen went out and said the day that you
[1:04:49] eat of this tree you should surely die
[1:04:52] and god never told adam at the time that
[1:04:55] he had a remedy
[1:04:58] hallelujah god never told him
[1:05:02] so adam no doubt but thinking i'm going
[1:05:04] to die
[1:05:08] but to his surprise when he should have
[1:05:11] died
[1:05:13] completely
[1:05:16] god managed to have grace
[1:05:19] slew a lamb and the blood was shed and
[1:05:22] he took that lamb and stripped him of
[1:05:24] his skin and wrapped adam and eve around
[1:05:26] it
[1:05:27] wrapped it around adam and eve and they
[1:05:29] walked out of the garden
[1:05:32] disconnected
[1:05:35] one thing about god he's a holy god and
[1:05:37] you know we look at this thing and we
[1:05:38] say oh brother brooks
[1:05:40] you know maybe you're too strict i
[1:05:41] cannot be strict enough
[1:05:45] the bible said holiness without no man
[1:05:47] shall see god
[1:05:49] holiness is not your outward appearance
[1:05:52] but holiness produce an outward
[1:05:55] appearance
[1:05:57] amen hallelujah people say well you
[1:06:00] can't
[1:06:00] judge me by the way i wear what i wear
[1:06:03] yes i can
[1:06:05] because whatever's out on the outside is
[1:06:08] an expression of what oh what's on the
[1:06:10] inside
[1:06:13] god is a holy god exodus 25
[1:06:16] and 20 and the we we know what god did
[1:06:19] amen he
[1:06:20] he set those cherubims there at the
[1:06:22] garden of eden
[1:06:24] but during the time when the people uh
[1:06:27] didn't want to hear god
[1:06:28] god set up a system if i could say it
[1:06:30] like that a worship
[1:06:33] and he showed moses the tabernacle and
[1:06:36] told him the bill did according
[1:06:38] to the pattern moses did just that
[1:06:42] but one of the things that in the ark
[1:06:45] there
[1:06:46] of the covenant the bible said they were
[1:06:48] cherubims
[1:06:50] and these cherubims stretched forth
[1:06:52] their wings
[1:06:54] they were there with their wings
[1:06:57] touching each other
[1:06:59] hiding their face and they were
[1:07:02] looking at them each other as they
[1:07:06] covered the
[1:07:09] and the mercy sheets and all those
[1:07:11] things those
[1:07:13] uh uh how can i say uh furnitures and
[1:07:16] things were
[1:07:17] were made of gold overlaid with gold
[1:07:21] you know wood that was things that were
[1:07:24] made of
[1:07:24] shipping wood was then covered with gold
[1:07:29] and that them wood was to identify
[1:07:32] mankind we're just dead trees
[1:07:37] but then god will cover us
[1:07:41] with that gold from heaven amen
[1:07:44] and when he covers you and covers me we
[1:07:47] become
[1:07:48] deity
[1:07:52] it says the covering
[1:07:57] the wings on high they cut their wings
[1:07:59] covered the mercer sheet
[1:08:00] and to win their wings their faces
[1:08:04] they shall look one toward another and
[1:08:06] toward the mercy seat shall the faces of
[1:08:08] the terrorists be
[1:08:10] and thou shalt put the mercy seat above
[1:08:14] upon the ark and in the ark thou shall
[1:08:18] put the testimony that i should give
[1:08:20] thee
[1:08:21] and what was the testimony about the
[1:08:23] word of god
[1:08:24] and there will i meet with thee in our
[1:08:27] commune
[1:08:28] with thee from above the mercy seat
[1:08:32] from between the two cherubims which are
[1:08:35] upon the ark of the testimony
[1:08:38] of all these things which i give thee in
[1:08:40] the commandment of the children
[1:08:42] of israel as i said these
[1:08:45] instruments and this this box and
[1:08:47] everything was made out of
[1:08:49] wood and it was laid overlaid with gold
[1:08:53] thank god for the covering
[1:08:56] and as it said it speaks of deity
[1:09:00] but it also speaks a flesh becoming word
[1:09:06] this box that was covered was also
[1:09:09] crowned with a
[1:09:10] a golden lid covering
[1:09:14] and upon that we know that even when it
[1:09:17] when they would bring
[1:09:18] in the shoe bread think about it it was
[1:09:23] like common bread but it wasn't common
[1:09:26] because
[1:09:26] it was holy bread one of the things that
[1:09:29] you might not know about
[1:09:30] shoe bread is that when the when the
[1:09:33] priest would bring in the shoe bread
[1:09:35] they would bring it in
[1:09:36] half cooked half baked
[1:09:40] and the other half would be baked by the
[1:09:42] shekinah
[1:09:45] and so you say well what do you mean
[1:09:46] what was the difference because you got
[1:09:48] to understand
[1:09:48] that shoe bread was a bread of leavening
[1:09:52] in other words this bible represents the
[1:09:54] shoe bread
[1:09:57] and in its form it's half cooked
[1:10:00] half baked so what do you mean by that i
[1:10:03] mean
[1:10:04] that you can read this bible and won't
[1:10:06] get a thing
[1:10:07] from it until the kind of glory comes
[1:10:10] down on it
[1:10:12] and quickens this word gives you the
[1:10:14] full revelation
[1:10:16] of the word that's written in this book
[1:10:19] hallelujah so
[1:10:22] it showed that bread that bread laid out
[1:10:25] there
[1:10:25] on that golden lid and and here it is
[1:10:29] amen that bread
[1:10:31] y'all believe that if this if the
[1:10:34] shekinah glory
[1:10:36] can take aaron's rod and bring it back
[1:10:40] to life
[1:10:41] don't you think there's a kind of glory
[1:10:44] a man can cook bread
[1:10:46] or bake bread and it was a way
[1:10:50] god did things because that bread
[1:10:54] never molded it was on a pure table
[1:11:00] and that pure table was because the gold
[1:11:02] was pure
[1:11:04] and it showed that the only way that you
[1:11:06] can have fellowship here
[1:11:08] in this place your heart had to be pure
[1:11:11] is that
[1:11:12] right the bible says only the pure and
[1:11:14] heart
[1:11:15] shall see god hallelujah
[1:11:21] when you come to god you've got to come
[1:11:22] with no agenda
[1:11:25] um just as i am
[1:11:28] without one plea oh god your blood was
[1:11:33] shed
[1:11:33] for me hallelujah
[1:11:37] remember there's something is something
[1:11:39] special that
[1:11:40] something's happening here even in this
[1:11:43] time and in this
[1:11:44] in this dimension this is why so many
[1:11:46] people are stuck
[1:11:47] in their revelation it's not that the
[1:11:50] message is not right
[1:11:51] it's because we're not reverencing it
[1:11:54] we're not treating it
[1:11:55] in a holy way we're trying to handle it
[1:11:58] with unclean hands
[1:12:00] you can't do it god can't speak to you
[1:12:03] that way
[1:12:04] hallelujah if you approach god in such a
[1:12:07] way
[1:12:08] and then now if you were in the outer
[1:12:09] court he could take you by the brazen
[1:12:12] order
[1:12:13] but when you come into the holy place
[1:12:16] you got to be clean and don't even try
[1:12:19] going into the holies of holies because
[1:12:23] it was
[1:12:23] death automatically hallelujah
[1:12:27] you understand what i'm saying now you
[1:12:30] and i
[1:12:31] understand that all the bible is shadows
[1:12:34] and types
[1:12:36] in leviticus 24 and 5 i'm coming in just
[1:12:40] a moment
[1:12:41] and thou shalt take he was telling them
[1:12:44] how to make these cakes bread or
[1:12:48] how we want to put it he said thou
[1:12:50] should take fine flour
[1:12:53] and bake twelve cakes thereof
[1:12:57] two tenth deals shall be one cake
[1:13:02] and thou shalt set them in two rows
[1:13:05] six on a row upon the pure
[1:13:08] table before the lord
[1:13:12] now understand what he's doing here he's
[1:13:15] taking fine flour that fine flower
[1:13:18] that had been you know uh uh uh
[1:13:22] processed or made into this meal or this
[1:13:25] flower
[1:13:26] corn brother brandon said they were all
[1:13:28] about the same size
[1:13:32] the 12 loaves of cake represents the 12
[1:13:35] tribes of israel what we call the
[1:13:38] patriarchs
[1:13:39] now watch this because he said they're
[1:13:41] measuring by two-tenths
[1:13:43] deal amen so two tenths
[1:13:46] in other words and then he says listen i
[1:13:48] want you to put them
[1:13:50] where in two rows six
[1:13:53] on a row i like that six here
[1:13:56] six here now understand one tenth is a
[1:13:59] tithing
[1:14:00] right two tenths represents both six and
[1:14:03] six
[1:14:04] you see what i'm saying but anyway god
[1:14:07] used this
[1:14:08] and and the part that i like about it he
[1:14:10] said i want you to also put some
[1:14:12] frankincense upon each row
[1:14:15] that it may be on the bread for a
[1:14:17] memorial
[1:14:19] even an offering made by fire there
[1:14:22] that's the fire again
[1:14:24] see the offering has to be made by fire
[1:14:26] now this frankincense also
[1:14:28] works uh represents worship
[1:14:31] so everything that you're doing is about
[1:14:33] worship
[1:14:35] is that right it's about worship
[1:14:38] worshiping you
[1:14:39] god himself and this is what israel
[1:14:42] god was showing israel there's a certain
[1:14:44] provided way to worship me
[1:14:47] and here it is and you couldn't just do
[1:14:50] it the way you wanted to do it
[1:14:52] like now you can't just worship god the
[1:14:54] way you want to
[1:14:56] the bible says they that worship the
[1:14:57] lord must worship him in spirit
[1:14:59] and in truth this is the hour of spirit
[1:15:03] and truth not just truth spirit and
[1:15:06] truth amen holy ghost and fire
[1:15:14] seeing him face to face remember the
[1:15:17] time when
[1:15:18] moses brought the children to mount
[1:15:21] sinai
[1:15:22] everybody wanted to see god everybody
[1:15:25] wanted to hear god
[1:15:27] and by the time it started lightning and
[1:15:30] thundering and the mountains shaking in
[1:15:31] the earthquake
[1:15:33] they were so afraid shut him up shut him
[1:15:35] up
[1:15:36] moses we don't want to hear him
[1:15:41] see that's what people say oh let me see
[1:15:43] god you don't want to sin
[1:15:46] because if you ain't right you're in
[1:15:48] trouble
[1:15:49] hallelujah he was so holy not even the
[1:15:53] the animals could touch the mountain
[1:15:56] if they touched the mountain beast
[1:15:59] ignorant beast they died
[1:16:01] holy that's the way i saw him holy
[1:16:05] is that right he said when the year in
[1:16:08] the year that isaiah
[1:16:09] died king does i die he said i saw the
[1:16:11] lord
[1:16:12] what was it he was high and lifted up
[1:16:15] and his train
[1:16:16] filled the temple hallelujah who's the
[1:16:19] train
[1:16:20] you are amen
[1:16:23] is that right that's what the scripture
[1:16:25] says in that new jerusalem will be
[1:16:27] dressed in white
[1:16:29] hallelujah and the train which is the
[1:16:32] people of god the bride of christ
[1:16:34] filled the temple frankincense is a
[1:16:37] beautiful thing isn't it
[1:16:38] i don't know i like frankincense it's
[1:16:40] not only just a
[1:16:42] a thing that you can use as a medicine
[1:16:46] but it also produces a nice fragrance i
[1:16:49] know some people who had
[1:16:50] uh a real uh eczema eczema
[1:16:54] and they used that frankincense and it
[1:16:55] really cleared them up
[1:16:58] you know the thing is i'm trying to say
[1:16:59] it's an old herb it used to be really
[1:17:01] expensive
[1:17:02] but now you can get it you know pretty
[1:17:04] much at a reasonable price i still think
[1:17:06] it's expensive
[1:17:07] a little bottle like that but
[1:17:09] nevertheless
[1:17:11] god knew what he was doing he was trying
[1:17:12] to say you cannot come
[1:17:15] in my present stinking
[1:17:20] you must be washed you can't come in my
[1:17:23] presence smelling like sin
[1:17:25] hello you must be clean
[1:17:29] hallelujah you think god don't smell he
[1:17:31] does
[1:17:32] he smells hallelujah now remember
[1:17:39] i i basically just quoted that but i'll
[1:17:41] say it again
[1:17:42] i'll read it from exodus 33 and 80 says
[1:17:45] and it came to pass when moses went out
[1:17:47] onto the tabernacle that all the people
[1:17:49] rose up and stood
[1:17:50] every man at his tent door and looked
[1:17:52] after moses
[1:17:54] until he was gone into the temple or
[1:17:56] tabernacle
[1:17:57] this is the thing that moses did the
[1:17:58] bible said moses was a man
