musicians the lord is good to us we thank him for his grace and his mercy good to see you brother james we're going to ask that you turn with to that favorite psalms psalms 27 please we're going to read the fourth and fifth verse of psalm 27. then we'll go to psalms 32 and 7. psalm 27. we read the fourth and the fifth verse one thing have i desired of the lord and i will seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock psalms 32 we're going to read the seventh verse thou art my hiding place thou shall preserve me from trouble thou shall compass me about with songs of deliverance amen let us pray father god we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us lord you have been better to us than we've been to ourselves we pray this morning oh god that your perfect will be done we'll be careful to give you the praise glory and honor anoint your servants servant lord we can't do nothing without you lord and we're not here to be seen of ourselves we pray father god that the people will see you lord granted in your name jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated as many of you know that we've been working in the area of destiny last time we ministered we ministered a man for in a time of trouble i love that because i realize that my god always hears us when we uh in trouble we know by god's grace that we have talked about various things uh in the book of joshua in the book of judges and we kind of like been working along that line just trying to show everybody where we are and who we are because as jesus christ is through every page or throughout the bible so are we because we are one with him and therefore if we can see the very shadows and types that brother branham talked about because that's why he said that's how he learned that's how god taught him rather is by the shadows and types and knowing that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and that he is a god that changes not i thank god for that because if he was a god that that would change i wouldn't know how to serve him i wouldn't know how to love him um you know even even james talks about it he said a double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways so we realize by god's grace we're living in a time of perplexity where things are so confusing you don't know who to trust um you see your country uh and not just in america it's everywhere falling apart and and uh you know the messenger of this hour actually preached a message this world is falling apart well if we couldn't see it then we can see it now amen but we realize amen that the gospel has always ran neck and neck with what we call science as science achieved things uh in the natural the bride of jesus christ or the church of jesus christ always would achieve things in the spiritual and you know it kind of confuses me sometime because you know i can see the progress uh from the horse to the horse and the buggy i can see the progress from the horse and the bugger to the airplane i could see uh different things of that nature but we are supposedly we are in what we call the uh the uh uh uh astro the astronaut age and um the astronaut age is the the top of the line you don't get any uh higher than that because in their achievements they are able to travel they're able to uh go beyond and break the sound barrier as well as time you know they actually gives us a a place where we can see where the church should be now whether the church is there or not uh that that's that's where that's where god come becomes the judge but my thing is we are a bride we are the bride of jesus christ and you and i must understand that this bible in itself should be our heartbeat it is where we live or should live it is where we come to understand not only god but comes to understand ourselves and the day that we're living in we're living in a horrible time as far as i'm concerned and it's just a horrific time but nonetheless in all of that it is the age in which god has ordained us to be in uh you know coming from the message countdown brother branham said uh a science when assad as science achieves some things and as we just did a moment ago we could look backwards and see their achievements and everything else and understand that all of their achievements even though it started with a horse uh yet and still you must understand it becomes more horses it doesn't become like a camel or something else the power increases from what it used to be into what it is now and and the achievements that that are going on you and i must understand that we supposed to be beyond what we call the church ages is that all right now coming from revelation 17 15 uh you know we we know the scripture uh uh talks about things but we're lit we're reading from the seven church ages and and i'm just building a a a a platform by god's graces brother baby says watch the church speaking to him now waters revelation 17 15 says waters means thickness and multitude of people now his voice or this being that was standing there looking like this christ in his church as bride and church being one like husband and wife is one the church and christ being molded together with one person the same holy ghost and and the things that christ did the church does also and see when i hear those things i'm like okay it's something that we're supposed to be doing and whatever he's doing is what we're supposed to be doing you know this bride of jesus christ is not just the assembling of people or just coming together on a sunday or wednesday the bride of jesus christ is some it's it's it's it's it's as a born-again believers who are working in the will of god every day hallelujah see the beautiful church there is holiness in power and majesty with seeing visions signs wonders everything just like he did here it is on earth giving all praise to god saying i can do nothing except the father show me but he shows me and here it is and we come to see these things go to taking place so the problem of god is saying listen these things are working god is working in a way that everybody's not going to see him but we realize by god's grace you know we can look back and we say you know we can see what william branham did we know what we we in branham but the focus is not on william branham anymore it's on the bride of jesus christ it's on you if you consider yourself the bride of jesus christ it's on you now we come to a place amen it is the capping off of the age it is what god is doing you know you can call it uh you know adoption whatever whatever you choose to to say it is but it is a time where the bride of jesus christ comes into a maturity not only just maturity but she comes to a place amen that she is so much like him right now we understand because even in the message of desperation the prophet says now what we're watching after the seven seals the uniting of the people uniting signs the red light flashing in the last day and you know i didn't realize amen that this particular phrase would be used in the quote that i'm reading right now because yesterday i was just thinking just thinking on the lord and you know god came and he spoke to my heart and this is what he said the red lights are flashing how many all know what that means that means it's a danger whenever the red light is flashing that means this is a warning it is a dangerous time and if you don't see the red light flashing and you cross the track you're in trouble if there's a train coming and you fail to see the warnings you're going to be hit by the train and that's not going to look so pretty red lights are flashing it is a warning right y'all know what i'm talking about you're going down the road you're bringing the speed limit all of a sudden you see the red light flashing and your heart starts beating right are you in trouble yes you are right because you have broken amen a speed law and it it's up to the police whether he gives you a ticket or a warning or just grace so you know either way you know when you see the red light flashing that means either stop be cautious don't go anywhere look both ways right so we understand it's a red light flashing he said the signs of women preaching pretty excuse me the signs of women getting prettier and man and what they would do and all these signs of the holy spirit leading up then come right here to the capping off of all those messages since the seventh seal now you say what do you mean brother books you've got to understand that when the prophet god was on the earth and we've gone through this before amen inside sir is this the time you know he didn't understand what god was doing he had this burden in his heart he knew god was going to do something with him he didn't know exactly how and what it was going to be like there was a time he thought he was going to die amen but it was not that it was the furthering of his ministry this is the purpose for which he was born and now is coming into play and it is the highlight of the word it is the greatest oh lord are you all weak this morning hello somebody it was the highlight of the word and here it comes into a place and then the god is getting ready to do something and think about it brother troy and i was talking about that this morning who else could it have been could you have done it i mean what he did will you matter what he did could you have done it the answer is no no you could not have because god when god chose him there was no option there was not two or three he could choose from there was only one there was only one moses there was only one joshua there was only one malachi 4. you could not have been that because god didn't choose you to be that hallelujah is that all right so i'm saying all of these things he did a perfect job because he was ordained to do a perfect job see it capped off in one thing and that was the token now we say oh brother books i i i want to be perfect i want to be just like him well in order for you to be just like him in the beatles it has to be the token how many all know what that is the token that's why he didn't say oh just the holy ghost he called it the token because that is god imperfection it is the sealing of god in you and you and i know that we consist of three part right the outer court the inner court and the holies of holies right the flesh the spirit and the soul and understand this your perfection is not perfection until the holy ghost is in your soul everything else is just potential you understand that you love the lord now brother adam talks about the pyramid and he doesn't go to a place where the pyramid we're not talking about a pyramid doctrine but we understand by god's grace what that is that is the statue of a perfect man and brother goes on he says you know the pyramid being those foundations into the king's chamber and this is what i like i'm trying to get you to see where we are okay if we have come up this ladder and we have come to brotherly kindness and we're we're looking in that place to be capped off with divine love where are you where are we and if this is a time to play this is a time to be sincere if you ever ever wanted to be sincere this is the time to be sincere this is not a time amen to play church hallelujah listen and we know we're talking about the king's chamber and you know in this particular quote come from god's only provided way he said there he says and you know uh and just before you hit the seventh wall there is a little introduction plank there where a messenger comes out to bring you to the king and i've been in that great pyramid in egypt what a blessing until i got claustrophobic but it was a blessing to know that i was able to climb those stairs and i was able to go into the king's chamber now i'm trusting that the natural types of spiritual amen but in that we realize amen the higher you went into the pyramid the smaller it became and it was such a a rush for me because i had never experienced claustrophobic uh but uh but you know it was just like more than enough people were coming in we were almost like this like you know in this little room there's only one way to go up and one way to come down which is the same way up and down and to be honest with you something struck me and i'm about climbed over the people getting out but you know i thought about it and i thought you know lord this is this is a place where many are called and few are chosen the room wasn't built for all of those people it was limited space and that's how it is in the king's chamber it is limited space but the messenger goes on and says the message of john the baptist that introduced the king and we know that he introduced jesus christ but they rejected him they call it the stone of scone whatever it is they don't know where it's at because it's a rejected stone but that's the stone that decaps the whole thing that makes the pyramid through complete seven church ages add grace to this and add this to this seventh and see the last one is christ now y'all get where i'm going i'm talking about now i'm not talking about the illustration i'm talking about a time and presence right now right now and like i said when you get to the place where this word becomes common and boring to you you are totally backslidden right so we realize by god's grace there is coming a final move and you're it i'm trusting that we are a move that god is bringing this bride into and it just scares me it really does something to me it makes me cry sometimes it makes me worry sometimes because i can see how the people are not spiritually in the condition they should be should be you say i don't brother book's god ain't yes he is if god made me the pastor i can see where you are and you and i must understand i'm trying my best to get you to see you don't have the time you think you have and think about it since you've been a christian how long it has taken you spiritually to get where you are now and you're still not where you want to be and you think that all of a sudden you're going to have a snap crackling pop no don't let him catch you with your work undone y'all understand me goes on he says listen the angel the one the voice who's talked to me has never ever told me anything wrong everything he's ever told me has come to pass that's right and he said because of that i can believe him hallelujah is that all right listen so you and i must understand amen that he he ever did say anything but was the truth hallelujah i believe him he said there will be after the baptism of the holy spirit and speaking in tongues and divine healing and so forth these things the capping of the pentecostal message is what we're speaking of today see that's what makes the message different we're not preaching a pentecostal message we're preaching a capstone message we're talking about amen rapturing faith rapturing gays amen and we're talking about getting the people in line amen to be translated but how can we be translated if our minds are still on the world how can we be translated when we're so rooted and grounded in the things and cares of the world and you know what the bible says when those things overtake you the love of god leaves you hallelujah you cannot love the world and love god at the same time we talk about a dangerous time you say that'll never happen to me let me tell you something israel thought there was something too the worst thing you can allow yourself is to develop pride in the message there's a lot of pride you know what i mean you don't even know what let me say it like this you know one of the worst things awakening things that i had have experienced is when i went to israel and i saw how prideful they were and they were prejudiced who were the jews yes the jews they were prejudiced and here and i'm not talking about against black people they were prejudiced against everybody that wasn't jewish and me and some of the sisters and brothers stood in line there at a shop and this jewish lady was waiting on us as soon as another jew came in she left us there didn't even say excuse me pardon me she left us there in line went and served that jewish lady then came back and served us it was obvious you understand what i'm saying but you got to understand that even so these jewish people can never get to heaven because they're jew the only way they can get to heaven is now you must be born again huh you and i must understand by the grace of god amen that this thing is turning their way and when god closes the gentile door he could care less on how vehemently you knock when the door is shut the door is shut the capping of this ministry where brother said this ministry is christ himself impersonated among his people y'all know what that means they're gonna act like him they're gonna talk like him they're gonna walk like him the miracles the signs the wonders and that's the thing it seems like the more uh we begin the world began to unfold to us either the more we want to become starchy this is not it it was fire that fell on the day of pentecost hallelujah and that same fire must be seen in the bride of jesus christ it cannot we cannot go as a dead church we cannot go as an intellectual church we must have the same fire of god that william branham had or we are not the we're not the product of william branham let me say that again we must have the same fire that william branham had or we're not a product of william branham hallelujah oh it don't matter how much you say i'm in the message millions were in the message of moses look how many amen that was in under joshua you see what i'm saying but my point is you must have a personal relationship with god and let me tell you something you don't have to tell me i know the devil don't like you praying he don't care if you come to church he don't care if you pay your tithe he'll let you read your bible but when it comes to prayer that's where he's going to fight you the most you know why because prayer changed things that's where god comes and anoints you that is your entrance into the holies of holies right there on your knees hallelujah hallelujah i'm trying to hold my peace right see when he was here on earth in his body the bride which is part of him doing the same things as husband and wife or king and queen just before the marriage ceremony i can remember the time when i proposed to my wife and there was about four or five sisters who claimed me as their husband i don't know where they got their vision from but it didn't come from god and they were mad with my wife because i chose her instead of them and you know what i'm going to be honest with you it never was in my mind to choose them but in their mind y'all understand me in their mind oh god to show me brother brooks is my husband yeah god didn't show me nothing of the sword i was looking for character and that's what i got you know we must understand that character is what's going to win for you it's not how much message you got or how you can remember the bible you understand me it's your character that's why you're being tried right now that's why people steps on your toes that's why they bump into you i'm speaking spiritually that's why you go through changes it is not from the sinners it's from people in the house brother adam said in the in the later church agent this is what i'm looking forward maybe i'm crazy but you know i'm looking forward to for this powerful demonstration i like whooping the devil i like it when i see satan defeated we pray for cancer we pray for different things and we've seen god heal we've seen god deliver i love it because i know it's jesus christ doing it i can't do anything but i do believe he's still the same yesterday today and forever he says after a short and powerful demonstration of the spirit this little haunted and persecuted group will go to be with jesus i don't know one woman i don't know one young lady that when her husband give her a rock she's to hide it you know what she does the first thing she called on is her girls i don't know if that what finger that is but she makes sure they can see the big rock you know what i'm saying she'll even act differently she'll be acting like oh just to show her rock just to show who she belongs to and that's how we're supposed to be we're supposed to shine the diamond of god that the world can see who we belong to we're not ashamed of our husband hallelujah brother brandon said we feel like we're going through a great time of distress and trials perplexity of this time and distress between the nations and all kinds of things happening and sometimes i get engulfed like where ever ever where i look is like in a ship out on the sea and i've been given charge of the boat and how we going to make it that's what he said and how we're going to make it and here comes me one with a white cap hundred times bigger than my ship but we'll crest them everyone we are more than victors through him the captain and the chief captain has caught a hold of the string on on on the end of the ship he's pulling us through he says we'll crest every one of them now he's talking about holy ghost feel people now right he's not talking about a peter who's not converted yet and that's the truth peter could not stand the test while he was unconverted but once he became converted he became a powerhouse just another word of encouragement he says now the stabilizers have been put on the ship now you got to understand the prophet of god is speaking something to him and he's not just wasting words god is not idle god don't use idol words and now he's speaking something so you can understand he said that that the way he saw was was was one of the greatest waves a hundred times bigger y'all understand what he's saying this test that's coming it's gonna be great but if you trust in the word you'll crest every one of them now the stabilizer has been put on the ship great fearful waves are out here before us but we know just beyond that wave yonder we're nearing the shore in other words if they're coming a great way but just after the wave oh my god see we're nearing the show just stay stable just stay in the word stay with god no matter how you feel what anything else stay right with the word let it stay stable when you are all these great big old clouds around us storms coming atomic bombs and everything else they're talking about it but our stabilizer is right straight in the word god said it would be there here we'll crush every one of them yeah we'll go right over the top of them yes indeed they they can't sink us that's what i like they can't sink us why you're predestinated to stay afloat it doesn't mean amen that you're not going to go through the battles but they're coming and this is what i'm trying to tell i told a brother the other day i said let me he i said brother i said i really think the next move for all the bride is is persecution i said because i could see everything moving in that direction he said well what about peace and safety i said well we have someone in the office now that can bring the jews and the gentiles together oh yeah in a matter of time he can bring them together and if that's what it means peace and safety let me ask you a question after this coronavirus after all of this what would be a more perfect time for the unit for the for the whole of the world gathering together and say now we've got the formula peace and safety y'all understand me you can you see the bill up because every right right now people are frustrated people are losing their minds the suicide rate has increased young people are losing their mind they can't hardly take the pressure uh social distance and all of that but there's only one group of people that has a peace at mind and that's the bride of jesus christ hallelujah it does not matter what satan throws at us i'm anchored in jesus the storms of life i wait y'all understand me i mean god and when you anchored in jesus it doesn't mean the boat is not going to toss to and fro but you know you're steadfast you can't be uprooted let me ask you something why do you think you're still here with all of the things that are happening in the message people are leaving speaking evil but yet there's something that's anchored something you know that you know that you know you can't even explain it but you know that you know that you know you can't give it up because you know right nobody could ever convince you that one plus one is equal three because you know that one plus one equals two right and no matter how you wish it to be three it'll never be three at least not in our mathematical system so what i'm trying to say is that a lot of us possess stuff possess things this is what the message did for you the message has given you hope and faith and a lot of time we don't even know we got it you don't even know what you possess by eating this word this word has placed you in a position that you cannot help somebody you could never be deceived huh how can you be deceived with a message like this you know the correct baptism you know there's only one god and when they force you or try to force you to believe anything else like shadrach meshach and abednego i cannot bow am i making sense okay let's move on so we realized by god's grace he said that's just all there is to it there ain't no way in the world to keep it down there we'll crest every one of them because our great captain is calling at the other side now i i you know how many y'all have ever seen those swarms of birds you ever seen birds that get together and and some going this way is like art like a painter paint you know he's painting something some go this way some go this way and all of a sudden they come like this and it's just absolutely beautiful and you'll never see one of them bumping to each other i've never seen any one of them drop out of the sky because he got out of the lane because all of those things are being orchestrated by god and whether we see it or not god is moving in the bride she's moving forward let me this is what i'm trying to tell you it doesn't well i ain't feeling nothing listen if you're not feeling nothing if there's not a pull in your life to get closer to god something's wrong i'm telling you something's wrong something's wrong and you need to pray i can't hardly sleep sometime thinking about jesus last night was one of those nights yeah i can't hardly sleep i'm thinking about the coming of the lord i'm thinking about the rapture i'm looking at myself and thinking oh my god do i have all the goods i'm preaching but i gotta have them all myself i gotta have it myself and i'm looking at all these things and i'm thinking to myself lord what is wrong with the people then brother branham preaches a message one in a million we'll look right at that and we'll think sometime that that could never be me the only way it could never be you is that you've made your call in an election sure amen so we come to a place by god's grace where there's wars and rumors of wars we see all of these things i'm coming to something just a moment see but we gotta understand you are in the scripture you just gotta find your identity in the word we know the shadows and the types amen but when god opened those seals another dimension was open it wasn't just now we're still in the same church there's no sign brother bannon said there must if it's a new message a messenger must bring a new message and every messenger comes at the end of the age so brother adam came at the end of the pentecostal age but at the end of that pentecostal age he also came in the beginning of a new one a age we call the bride age the age we call the capstone an age we call eternal and it is for those who are eternal and this bible has locked us in we would have never known about ruth naomi we would have never known hallelujah about boaz and all the rest of them we would have never known had not there been a prophet it was joseph's bread joseph's meal that's why the pentecostals in all can preach it because he left them a lot before they kicked him out huh yes what would you preach outside of this message if he was to leave it what is that nothing i'm just going to go where i left this part out last service one thing about the message right now and i know people are not seeing it but we're we are you know in a kind of like a age like judges because we don't have a prophet joseph is gone you understand what i mean moses is gone y'all understand what i'm saying now there's a word we have but understand israel had the same word joshua had and joshua had the same word moses had but when it comes to judges that you know if you read judges you find out there was a lot of crazy stuff going on and you know what it was that israel kept backsliding isn't that funny god will deliver you from something oh god deliver me and i promise you i'll go i walk right before you and he delivers you and there's just in a short period of time you return right back to the to the vomit that you threw up come on somebody it's the truth and israel was always returning back to that to her stuff how many times did god have to deliver them constantly delivered them constantly delivered them because there were times and i don't know where how god looked at it but every time they got into real trouble they called on god help me isn't that the way we do it we want god to help us because the devil is beating us up but at the same time we're not ready to repent we feel sorry because we're caught in a trap but once god releases from the trap amen we forget about who released us from the trap and how painful the trap was we do that why do we do that it just seemed to be human nature israel constantly constantly was was getting in trouble and y'all know it's the truth real judges little man by the name of sham god why do you think the philistines and all of these different countries were coming in and ravishing israel why do you think amen that every time they thought they had things going good here come these devils coming in amen and taking their stuff taking their wheat taking their children taking their goats kicking their sheep taking their cattle it meant everything that it seemed like they were going good like some of us look like you're going good financially here come the devil now sometimes it's just trials but sometimes it's sin hello but one thing and the thing that i love about this because i told you the last one of the last times i preached joshua when he came into the land it was no longer a one-man ministry the people were involved and in that involvement amen they not joshua they had to go and fight see that's how it is that's how it is in this church people think it is a it's a pastor's duty and you can't hardly get any kind of help because everybody comes like it's a one-man ministry it is not a one-man ministry the whole body here is supposed to function and work but we're coming here oh pastor gonna feed me pastor's gonna say something he's gonna either say something i like or he's gonna say something i don't like i don't know what it's gonna be but i'm gonna go up to church because i'm gonna be religious hallelujah now this is turning a different way than what i expected this morning but i'm a preacher just like he want me to because joshua he got the people together and and he and one of the things that he taught them was to learn how to listen to the voice and the commandment of god because remember in the wilderness their fathers amen didn't know how to listen and obey the commandment of god that's why they all died joshua gives them a test i want you to walk around jericho seven times and y'all know the story but everybody was involved all of the warriors like i said he never had one child or one woman or anybody that wasn't a warrior in that line because he needed somebody who was able to take commands whatever you do i don't want you to say one thing until that seventh day and on the seventh day we're gonna walk around jericho seven times and we're gonna shout we're gonna blow the horns and god will intervene this is what i'm talking about we must come back to a place with god until god intervenes you understand me we're not there yet we should be there the word is here but we got to have somebody who's going to believe the word somebody who's going to act upon the word somebody who's going to know this is right right because the old testament i get jealous of it because i see god come on the scene for people who did not even have amen the true sacrifice like we have is that right joshua comes in and god says listen i want you to walk around and did god do it yes the walls came falling down and they conquered jericho oh that was in as warriors went in and they slew all of the enemy i love that do you realize that the bible said if two or three are gathered in my name you could ask whatever you will just two or three he must have known the kind of condition that people were going to be in in this day if i could get two or three believing ask what you will and it shall be given think about it even in the old testament in the first chronicles when it came to david how how how saul david's people went to make saul uh went to witness to saw people to bring him over to make david king and basically that's the way we're supposed to be we're supposed to be out here witnessing and telling them listen saul is dead the denomination is dead god has departed from that but there is a message and there's a king that we're working with to be crowned first chroniclers 12 38 says all these men of war they could keep rank came with one perfect heart to hebron to make david king over all israel and all the rest also of israel were of one heart to make king and i thought oh god if we could just have one heart if we could just get people don't want to call it get them out of their selfish ways amen thinking that it's all about you it ain't all about you it's about us hallelujah god could not even outpour the holy ghost on that 120 until they got on one accord and you think he's going to do something differently no if the anointing isn't not in here you can't blame the preacher i think we need to look at each other look at ourselves what am i doing to make it great what am i doing to make the anointing come y'all understand me it's all of us will give an account before god amen what we have done with what he has given us you think you don't play a part you play a part and if you're not playing your part god will judge you for that hallelujah now i'm just going to talk about deborah for a little bit y'all know deborah some people call it deborah like i said i'm going through judges i talked about sham god how sham god was a judge as well maybe not a major but he was a hermione one and he looked at the land and he saw amen how the land was being devoured by the enemy and they were always coming to him you know destroying his stuff and sham god wasn't even a real warrior and this is the thing i love about judges because god takes nobody and makes them somebodies he takes the common people and he raised them up that's what i love about judges he he took failures failures like like samson people like samson he took people like that and made them something and if we could see that judge is exactly what god wants us to see we're living just like they did in the same kind of era amen because people are right everybody's right in their own eyes even though we got a message everybody's still right in their own eyes my revelation is greater than yours if you don't know this or you don't know that you're not in the message my what nonsense if you hear somebody say that i don't care how anointed he or she may be you know what you need to tell them you must be born again how are you going to say what you believe and let me tell you what we know by god's grace it ain't about you it's about him and i'm gonna tell you as a preacher you can study all you want to if god doesn't come and anoint those scriptures you'll just know nothing ain't no man this is not a man thing y'all understand what i'm trying to say it's about god and you i do not and this is the thing i'm talking about i do not want to get on my deathbed and realize that i'm not right what a horrifying experience i'd rather somebody take a gun and blow my brains out than to face god unrighteously you understand me i'd rather be lynched i'd rather be and feather whatever it takes i'd rather die like that and die holy than to die physically fit unholy you understand me let's move on because we need to see deborah and his deborah the word deborah means be i is you think what what does a b think about a b a b is a uh uh uh uh uh uh in animal whatever you want to call it uh uh but it it it organizes you know we see bees and we see bees they work together no bee work by themselves all bees work together and the bees work together to do what crown the queen and there are some things in that endeavor that you must understand that it's something about this book amen that a lot of people all of them all of the judges are speaking to us because we're now in a age william branham is gone the law the word is is here the holy ghost is here but it seems like people are now in it just like they're doing falling backwards and who are they worshiping baal and and moloch and you name it they're out there worshiping those devils under the umbrella of religion the very same thing israel did these people are doing a game somebody got to be raised up god gotta have somebody some voice because he said i never left my uh without a witness my people without a witness somebody but let me tell you something when a man begins to scream and holler at the people when when it comes to their wrongdoings they don't want to have nothing to do with it but that doesn't mean the man is not called we see people in this message all we have done is come to a place that we've learned a system and we don't even know nothing about god we can quote the scriptures but at the same time we don't know how to love one another you don't know nothing if you can't love one another you know nothing that is the very foundation of being a christian understand we are at a place why do you think we're called the bride of jesus christ it's called lady grace you can't even have grace if there is no love the feminine attributes of god is still god i told you that the last week we are the feminine attribute of god i showed you how he she she he walked through in the midst of the golden candlesticks which we already know but the question was asked by the family said is the bride of christ and the body of christ the same he said absolutely yes sir and this is what i'm saying i don't want theology theology won't get you anywhere knowing what he said won't do nothing for you until you do what he says to know the baptism in the name of jesus christ is right is not good for you if you don't obey it you got to put it in action you know that's what gideon says lord if you be with us where be all the miracles and you know what we have gotten so smart in the message till we don't even want miracles anymore we just want the word word word word and people don't understand the word word word word has never been dead it's a lie hallelujah it is a lie the true identification of the church those things must be y'all hear what i'm saying now you say oh brother brooks well we don't have none of that well don't you understand the bible we understand one thing amen that the word of god cannot come back forward at some point in time if you be god god will correct us he said also the bride of christ will have a ministry before the rapture and my question is if it's before the rapture when is that time and what is the ministry that's right that time is now the bible says the spirit and the bride says come right i'm talking about our destiny our destiny and i i don't know about you i believe i'm a king i believe i'm a priest i believe i'm the bride of christ hallelujah and i cannot settle for church entity it's dead been dead a long time ago and you're the only ones that can make the change i can't change it for you you have to change it there's got to be something in you that gets tired of this religious acting that we do that was pretty rough but deborah was hidden in the prophecies she was hidden in the book she's right in the book you know and i used to you know i know about deborah because all women preachers use is deborah they all use debra you know and so i've heard deborah for a long time but you know just to see where deborah is setting and you know because of time i'm not going to have uh uh uh be able to do all i want to do but brother bam goes on and says we need an old-fashioned revival that's what he said holy ghost revival amen trying to keep you to you to get excited i know you're not excited but brother that's the truth trying to get the point to you it's the truth it's what we need he said oh i'm looking at this thing he said he's preaching to somebody he can't even get excited and that's how i do sometimes i preach and can't get nobody excited about just looking at me like i'm a show not everybody but my point is we understand where everybody sits by their behavior you either in the outer court the inner court are the holies of holies and your actions will always tell where you are your behavior because you can't fake it it must it must be real is that right see the holiness of jesus christ comes to what cover you but i thought i think to myself i said lord have mercy upon us amen we understand that god dwells in fire and if we don't come to church with fire what are we going to get the preacher's not up here for amusement folks he comes to hear tell you what thus says the lord he's here to tell you what god is thinking of you and understand we are in that ministry of judgment as i explained what judgment began first where at the house of god and as you've heard me say many times america would be america the beautiful if the church had only stayed on course but god doesn't judge the world until he first judged the church when the church goes wrong god judges the church and the world hallelujah braz has always been that sign of judgment is that right you and i must understand that here it was in the book of of of uh when it came comes to uh deborah and i'm not going to be much longer but one of the things i love about deborah is because you can't do what she did without an anointing and god anointed her but there was another thing that that took place and i guess i'll have to cut it short because of time there's another thing that endeavor took place when she called for barack it seems as if barack didn't want to do he seemed like he was kind of a little hesitant to to go after but we find out that in the midst of all and i want you to understand this here was he was this man i'm trying to think of his name right now and i thought i had it written down here but you know any he he he he he he come the captain of this uh host comes to do what he comes to destroy israel and i think he had 900 iron chariots and his with israel little farmers didn't have much i think they had to get go against jabin and you got to understand by god's grace amen that let me bring it to the spiritual because you got to realize we're talking about a bride and her ministry and we're here amen to do what jesus didn't when i could say we're here to further his ministry and deborah was a judge and so are you you say how can that be remember i spoke the other day amen when the woman was caught in adultery here she was this lady amen who caught an adulterer and here was jesus standing there and he judged the whole situation and then he turned to her and says hey what do you think about it where are your accusers she says i have none she was the amen to the judge right and when when the seals were open what happened he came down not floating like a butterfly he came down amen as a man a warrior amen with a white wig a judge wig on his head put one foot on a land one on the sea that's the inspiration that's why the prophet of god was able to say i indict this generation i'm putting you amen under an indictment you've been judged and you've been found wanting then god amen cut her off now who's next who's next absolutely israel amen thought they had a good even when they were in egypt under slavery you never seen god come down judging them but once they got under the voice of a prophet once they were out of egypt now god comes not only to bring them out of egypt but to judge them as well is that right the bible said he god put them in the wilderness so that he could try their hearts so they could see what was in them israel was so messed up amen that all all that debra could get out of that 12 tribe was two to help her fight and everybody else looking around and standing it's there it's there and we find out that that's exactly where it is now people want everybody else to work and they sit back and want to enjoy that's not the way it's supposed to be we're in this battle together hallelujah and so we come to a place amen that we find out that here was let me find those exact words i want to say so i won't be fumbling over here you love the lord hallelujah yeah that's what jabin amen you know he was basically the the captain of the israel and in in sasira was the the the captain of the the army amen y'all know how that works but anyway we find out amen that here it was they were coming to overthrow israel again and god inspires deborah now it has to be something that that that uh uh uh uh uh david know that that god is dealing with this woman because amen he he he consults he actually surrenders to her will and they go and they fight the battle now i want you to understand because you've got a battle to fight you got body soul and spirit right and you got a veil that keeps you away from the holies of holies but there must come an anointing to destroy the veil it's like 900 chariots of iron and you can't do it on your own you can't do it on your own why because this man has kept you in prison for 20 years that's the way it was because see after joshua and after the different uh battles they they won through the other judges amen they have freedom i think it was like for 80 years but then at that end of the 80 guess what happens they began to fall away from god again and every time you fall away from god god is going to judge you understand that if you're truly a seed of god god is going to gut you and bring you back and if you've got any sense and that's the thing how do you think that you're going to love the world more than love god and god gonna sit down back there he says no not only that i'm a jealous god and my name is jealous hallelujah they have been enslaved for 20 years the devil working them over for 20 years i hope you're not like that i hope you're not allowing the devil to work you over and over with the same thing for years and years and years and years and years and god want to deliver you you know what you need to do you need to cry help am i making sense so you understand you're in the bible and the man that got you captive amen is the same devil that captain have had israel in captivity many times may have come in a different name but it's the same devil and you and i must understand in order to overcome this thing we need a deborah we need somebody anointed let me let me let me let me let me read something to you coming from the fifth chapter after deborah in in barack and all of them had defeated their enemy deborah began to sing a song and y'all know the story right let me let me pronounce that word sierra sierra sisiera amen who was the captain of the lord host he had they had chariots and here was a what two thousand or what it was ten thousand versus whatever but the point is israel whip them but you don't get it you see that israel won but you don't understand how did they win chariots of iron 900 that's just the chariots that's not even talking about the footman you're talking about a wave like brother brown said a giant wave coming your way and how in the world you're going to crest it now this is just in the natural but understand by the grace of god amen you have been ordained to defeat sierra the bible says you are and when this devil and that's what that's one thing about a king you never allow the king to escape that's why i saw amen samuel killed the king of when when when samuel when saul wouldn't kill him because you know what a king is he's a leader and a leader will always find followers he kills the king and says era amen he he fled amen he ran and guess what it was nothing but a setup because deborah had already told barack says listen you're gonna you're gonna win the battle but you're not gonna get any glory you know who he's gonna go to a little woman hello and you said well who does this woman represent first of all she wasn't an israelite she was a gentile and this sierra amen knew and of course they were friends of the of of uh this man and he runs to her thinking he's going to gain favor but she he didn't know that in this lady's heart she loved israel i'm bringing something i'm trying to try to bring it but the point is because i'm just moving fast the point is i mean she runs to and think about it he asks her for water and she gives him milk and you know what it was an ice cold it was probably warm and just enough to put him good put him down and make him sleep real well i love milk but i can't drink it but anyway and then she gives us his milk and he dies how he dies not from the milk this lady goes and she's get in the tent she goes out while he's asleep she doesn't allow him to sleep and she goes out and she takes a peg do y'all know how big a peg that holds a tent together how big it is do you realize how big it is she gets one of those nails and she gets that nail and she's quietly see that's what i'm saying silence is something else so much can be done in silence and she silently went over and she put that nail to his head oh my god what a way to die and she drills that thing boom how many of you could have done that as long as i knew it was the devil i could do it and she takes that nail and she drives it into his head here devil the prophetess has already prophesied a lady was going to get the victory but let me read this before i close out here this morning so that you can understand by god's grace you're right in the word devil represents the spiritual part the attributes of god she's the one amen that god has ordained for the hour and understand here she comes along because there's a secret behind the tent there's a secret amen that god amen has in store because here it was now the word of god is going out and god has anointed this little girl ja l has anointed her and joelle amen is a plural word because amen is ja which represents amen jehovah and l that represent elohim and really it's called yael the j is the y and this word means you know because here she was a god she was a priest and here was god putting the masculine and the feminine together amen and what happens she kills him don't you see what i'm saying she takes a nail and she drives it into his head is that right the bible says amen that this serpent will bruise our heel well we'll bruise his head and the pride of jesus christ is to do what right in this day bring to open shame the devil and all his tricks by way of a world of prophecy we will put the devil to shame absolutely because you and i have been ordained amen to drive the nail into his head hallelujah it's old brother books ain't nothing to that it is if you can see yourself in the scripture you'll see what i'm trying to say even if you don't get what i'm saying trying to tell you that you have a part in the scripture you're a little church you don't mean like nothing nothing nothing go on but listen at the same time god has ordained you to kill the enemy that have kept you in prison let's go to the spiritual aspect god has ordained you to destroy the sierra that's blocking you who have kept you prison for all these years you are ordained to kill him and the only way you can kill him is by the anointing let me read this quickly i'm sorry i just got off for a moment the fifth chapter then saying deborah in barack the son of benedict the day saying praise the lord for the evening israel when the people willingly offered themselves and that's the thing they willingly offered no grudges no will don't go fight hear o ki ye king and give ear o ye princess i even i will sing unto the lord and i will sing your praise to the lord god of israel you know one of the saddest things that's going to really strike people is when they realize when they realize when the time strikes it'll be like a woman uh going into labor suddenly it comes oh here you came give ear o ye princes i even i will sing unto the lord and i will sing praise to the lord god of israel lord when thou wenteth out of see air when thou marches out of the field of edom the earth trembled and the heavens dropped the clouds also dropped water so what was happening when they went to fight god helped in the fight not only did it the earthquake but it began to rain this is what they're singing about in other words people of god what you what you understand we're talking about the third pool brother brown says hey he said in this third pool he said i didn't have nothing he said jesus had a few fish and loaves of bread he had water he turned into wine he said but in this third pool he said i had nothing but the spoken word and at that spoken word that's when things were created y'all understand me it's when god anoint you to say something because no doubt deborah didn't understand how god was going to do it but do you really think those little bit of people could have destroyed those people without the help of god the earth shook it rained then the river overflowed it was the help of god and let me say it like this here we go through little things in our lives right now and don't even realize we are under the third pool and god could do the same thing for us nobody should have you in prison or have you in a cage anywhere if you really believe this word amen the bible said god has already made a way of escape i'm just going to stop there my point is this you you know as the people of god we're going to either get on or we're going to either get off in somewhere and let me tell y'all something so you can understand that i don't mean like i'm fussing my my point is is that only god knows god knows because we have come to a place when the word of god has become so common we don't feel it anymore that's like a man kissing his wife and she doesn't feel it anymore or a woman kissing her husband she doesn't feel it anymore it doesn't incite her it doesn't enthuse her it doesn't do nothing danger red light flashing and i know right now we think oh my god i think about it sometimes when the bible says maybe i'm too pentecostal maybe that's what's wrong with me i'm just i love the joy i love to see the joy i love to see people smile i love to see people happy i love to see god you know in battle i love to see it you know i look at places and you know we read all of these great things and i can't stand for this book just to be history it's got to be a now god right now god i love to see when god do things just the other day we pray for people and god healed them just like that things that i don't say about pull put all the time because i ain't trying to be nobody but i know who i am and when i see god moving moving and moving and listen am i struggling am i having battles you better believe it everybody ought to be having battles now and if you're not having battle something's wrong with you but there is no time to give up this ain't no season to give up this is the time to fight back you know sometimes you get tired of the bully right when you get tired of the bully what do you do you find a way to whoop him good that's all the bully need to know is that you're not afraid of him right that's what a bully is he's not but a bully i've seen him they could come big big big big but you know what i always tell people i said you know one thing about this place right here everybody has a weakness and if they're tall you go for the knees and if they fat you go for the stomach you find the weakness of your opponent right that's all i'm saying i'm not trying to teach y'all how to fight don't go out there and say pastor say i can get you my point is in this picture you find the weakness you go after the weakness of the individual because isn't that what devil does for us he see your weakness and he comes after it so what i'm trying to tell you people of god we've got to come to a place where service has to keep going up and it's not the preacher it's not the preacher it got to keep going up when you see it this way it shows that we're not in the holies of holies all of us are not there when it keeps going up and down like this something's wrong you're allowing your trials and your your things to get the best of you you're letting your job get the best of you you're letting listen i don't know nobody that had to work like william branham did and he never came to church without joy in his spirit and he had to preach over and over and over i would not have been able to do that in closing i remember the time i went to trinidad for the first time and i preached i think in some places four or five times four different places on one day i was so angry with the people i was i'm like i'm human i'm a man right i promise i'll never go back to that place those people don't have no they don't have no compassion on preachers they don't understand i never understood it and some people can do that and they can just keep going keep going and keep going but all i know is i thought this was being overworked and then when i hear brother branham talk it just puts me down like this to know that he went from place to place to place three service here four services just back out the back and you think too much think to yourself oh my god only god's anointing could have kept a man going that way or people of god i don't know i know maybe how can i say it my heart goes out not just for this church for everywhere everywhere everywhere i know how i fight every day i know the struggles i go through every day and and i know why i do but i'm gonna tell you something i fight for you as well as for me and all i'm saying is that we're coming to the we're coming i can feel it i don't claim myself to be a prophet but i know something's coming and i know that a lot of people are not prepared and that's the kind of a thing that's troubling me right now because i could see that people are not prepared there are some people who are not even thinking about the coming of the lord they're not even thinking about it and that's our message and you got people in the message who's not even thinking about the coming of the lord and when i can't stop thinking and i just think to myself you know one in a million he says one in a million he says i'm not going to make this a doctrine but he says one in a million and he says you got to say that i'm and listen it can't come from your intellectual building the ability it must come from your heart you love the lord well i trust somehow something was said and i'm not finished with this subject uh maybe maybe we'll we'll be able to explain it better later but my point is trying to get us to see that we're in this book and once we come to see ourselves in the book then in itself it it it'll change you because you got to know when the trial comes that you're victorious and if you don't realize the grace of god in your life because i'm gonna tell you something you can't see full grace until you get into his full presence y'all understand me in the holy place you know the candle lights goes out it gets smalled over but in the holies of holies that's a presence that you'll never forget it is a present that dwells with you forever and i'm just trying to tell you being your christians all these years that i have been it's not enough to say i've been a christian for a long time the only resting place is behind that veil and guess what you got a labor to get in there you love the lord let's stand you gotta fight fight who you your biggest enemy is you you got to fight yourself the dot deny yourself remember i said on the other day that that big old curtain that old badger skin represented man's will and nothing stronger than your will and you have to deal with that because many times we know the word but our will says no do something different [Music] must die it must rot uh in this last day i can [Music] i i see i see i see the word i i see things maybe in a different way and i don't know whether it's coming out in the way that i see it i understand people i'm not trying to make anybody feel bad i'm trying to encourage in the best way i know how i'm trying to shout and scream in the way i know and the way i see things [Music] because the bible said that it is it's god's will that none should perish [Music] now what is what will happen to you to an individual if they know this message and they find themselves left behind where do you go from there [Music] you know what the devil is going to first say you're not even saved no matter what you do you can't be saved so you might as well give up i don't know what it's going to be like for the foolish virgins i have no idea and god knows i don't ever want to know but it's going to be a hard time because if they had a hard time in an era where the anointing was to believe the word what kind of time they're going to have when the anointing was lifted i don't understand and honestly that is such a puzzle uh a mystery to me how they overcome is a mystery to me the venom talks about world war ii he said it'll be like a picnic this compared to what we're getting ready to go through and i know one thing in the army when you're in basic training you can tell the sergeant i'm tired all you want to and now all you do is when you say i'm tired he said give me five more he pushes you beyond your limit yeah and you don't eat when you want to eat you can't rest when you want to rest and one thing for certain you learn how to take orders and you do whatever he says and if you don't do what he says you get in trouble and you get the whole company of people in trouble as well and that's how it is in the church of god when we fall short any of us fall in short all of us fall short because all of us will suffer from it just like in israel day when a cam was in the camp and he did the sin i think was 36 people died [Music] you and i must understand that everything we do will affect the body of jesus christ whether it's here or there so what we need to do is really says lord help me make me more sincere make me more serious give me grace oh god to make it through this dark time that's the thing when it's dark you can't see you can't see where you are where you're going but god is rich in mercy merciful to us let's pray father god we come before you we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us lord you have been better to us than we've been to ourselves and father we pray this evening oh god that your perfect will be

and the cares of this life is choking the people help us give us father will be careful to give you the praise and glory and the honor in jesus christ amen i said in the text that we would determine whether we would have one service today or two so this is our final service for today so if you have something that you choose to do and so let it be [Music] so i just want to announce that we have a
