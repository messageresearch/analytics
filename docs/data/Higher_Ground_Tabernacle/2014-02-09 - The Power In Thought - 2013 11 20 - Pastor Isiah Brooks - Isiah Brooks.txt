TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hey God is good to us amen we love the Lord we taught on something last night uh and I told you last night we was going to try to go ahead and continue on the thought to me it's a powerful thought if we could all catch the Revelation and understand what God is trying to get us to do I believe uh we'll be uh soon setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus let us turn uh to Philippians 2 and five from there we'll go to Philippians 1:27 and then Philippians 3 and 20 Philippians 2 and5 it reads let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus amen who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God may but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the the cross Philippians 1 and 27 we read down to the 29th verse only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ amen that whether I come and see you or else be absent I may hear of your Affairs that ye stand fast in one spirit with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel and in nothing terrified by your adversaries in nothing now terrified by your adversaries which is to them an evident token of predition but to you of Salvation and that of God for unto you it is given in the in the behalf of Christ not only to believe on him but also to suffer for his sake amen praise the Lord let's go to Philippians 3 now Philippians 3:20 and then we'll read portions of Proverbs 237 Philippians 3 and 20 and it reads for our conversation is in heaven amen from which also we look for the Savior the Lord Jesus Christ who shall change our vow bodyall that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things under himself one more scripture Proverbs 23 and7 and we'll just read that portion that uh is pertaining to the word that I'll be ministering tonight Proverbs 23 and7 and it reads for as he thinketh in his heart so is he let us pray father God we come before you Lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for allowing uh the saints of God to be here tonight you say where two or three are gathered in your name there you are in the midst so we welcome you here this evening we thank you for your love divine uh that passes all understanding we thank you Father God for your grace your mercy and your love in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated first of all I I just want to kind of uh give thought on what I'll be the Lord is bringing tonight the Ser uh the the the subject of the matter would be the power in thought the power in thought first of all I I want to say this so that you and I can understand that salvation didn't come to you when you recognized it it always was we're dealing with a Divine love God is love God doesn't change it he cannot change it it is the essence of his being and what God thought in the beginning he can't change it amen cuz he's perfect in his thoughts one of the most powerful scriptures there is in the Bible is the one that says for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life amen understand that thought was always with God John picked it up and he spoke the thought of God that thought that word can never change it is what it is and so when we understand that I was talking to a brother today and I said brother uh that is salvation once you see that your peace come by way of the work that he has already done it is not what you do it is what what he has already done that is salvation am and we are accepted in the Beloved that's why brother brandham always talked with the Christian and he tried to keep them encouraged and he talks to them you know like why aren't you believing it and what's wrong with your faith and you know you're living Beneath Your Privilege he never said they were not Christians but he showed them that they were not receiving all of their benefits and that's what that's what psalmist says let us not forget all of your benefits see because you did not come to God it was God thought about you that Drew you to him amen thank you Lord hello somebody I'll say it again God came to you you didn't look for God even as the prophet of God said you know and he took it back to Adam and Eve they didn't look for God Fallen men do not look for God Amen it is God who look for them why because they are his attributes amen and God promised he will not lose one amen the power of thought you know I I wanted to know what thought is and you know it that's a difficult thing to Define and you know uh cuz it's a it's a it's a spiritual thing it's not something that you do in your brain it's a spiritual thing that takes place like I was saying last night how many times we have spoken things not even realizing that we thought it amen out of the mouth it comes and the Bible said out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh so there was a process of some kind going on in your mind or in your thought machine that you didn't even know about but your mouth spoke it amen right it went from your head to your heart and out of your heart came what was thought so we realize God is is um concerned I'll put it this way let's put it this way God um will judge us according to all of the idle words spoken right because understand you and I as little creators when we speak things we put things into motion amen and believe you me words that we speak can hinder it can never stop the word of God but it can hinder what God intend to do amen right think about it when Elijah call down fire from heaven and when Elijah amen told uh call told those Bears to eat those children and when Moses spoke that struck that rock come on it changed the order of God that's what the prophet of God said he said that Moses was not supposed to strike that rock but his thoughts was contrary to what God's thoughts were and he implemented his own thoughts and he cursed amen come on and he said you are what was he doing he was literally trying to put a curse now he didn't mean to do it out of anger he spoke it and it caused him not to walk in the promised land now he saw it God was gracious enough to let him see it but he wasn't able to place his feet there amen because he allowed his thoughts to interfere with what God's thought and his intent was even the prophet of God says that's why it was Christ was smitten again in this age because of what Moses did he was only supposed to be smitten once and that was at calary but there was a second crucifixion because of what Moses did see action reaction now when we look about thought I want you to understand you know this is a dictionary and it says the act of process of thinking or the power of reasoning and judging it is also considered the power of imagination something as an idea formed in the mind thoughtfulness and I thought about thoughtfulness it means to be full of thought or concern about someone now when we talk about the Bible says as a man thinketh in his heart and brother bam said for years theologians and and Skeptics argued the point and said that that was wrong because a man doesn't think in his heart but he thinks in his head well in in in the 60s or wherever what time it was we found out that science found out that there's a little compartment that has no blood vessels in the heart and he said and they acknowledge that is the place where he thinks Hallelujah now the thing that God looks at the most is not what you think in your head it's what you think in your heart the head is the Battleground amen of thoughts as I wrote down today I said if one never would uh one never would do evil if one would block all of Satan's thoughts amen it is Satan thoughts that literally influences us and causes us to go contrary to the thoughts of God Amen that's why I read Eep uh Philippians 2 and 5 let this mind be in you amen right not m in your head but mind in your heart amen because this heart that God has designed has for us has also been designed as a throne where God becomes the head amen and you know the thing about it is when you look at it you that's why it's important that you die to your thoughts amen and let the thoughts coming from the heart rain Amen in no more the body now I thought about this because remember it was the thought it was the head that Satan aimed at when it came to Eve he made her reason he separated her thoughts from God's thoughts amen by adding one word you shall not die and she reasoned with it because he made her feel she had a right to have her own thoughts see and that's what the devil does he tried to make us feel like we have a right to our own thoughts but the Bible tells us that you've been bought with a price amen and you're not your own and when you and I surrender to God we're literally surrendering our body our soul our spirit and everything that's contain within amen even your thoughts God will not allow you to function or put it this way God will not allow you to live by your own thoughts and get away with it amen let's read and this is a powerful scripture it might uh shake you up a little bit but let's read uh uh I think it's Psalms 50 where where I want to go Psalms 50 see the power of thoughts and uh I think it was brother Randy we were talking with somewhere in the course of a few weeks ago or so and he mentioned thought and and I never thought I was going to preach on it but he talked about the speed of thought and I I thought wow that's that's wonderful because that after he mentioned that I started thinking you know Rapture and they said that thought uh you you know is like 350 millisecond that's just for you to figure out what you're looking at but to comprehend it it takes about 400 to something milliseconds now I don't know how fast that is I can't imagine it but we're going to read something here tonight where brother said Heaven may be a billions of billions of miles away but he said when you die it's just a moment's time and you're there now how fast can you travel bro and me you know I just want you to realize amen that scientists are beginning to see that the mind is far stronger than what we imagine it to be now they say that we as men we only think think on one side of the brain and you know I always say that's why women think they're smarter because they use both sides but we know by the grace of God and they are I mean for for for some reason you put a man when it comes to the knowledge and things like that they supersede right because That's what Satan promised them he promised them that that they would be gods in order to be Gods you must Excel and be above all it is what it is so anyway by the grace of God um when we look and we see how powerful the mind is and I go back to that that hospital room I I I wish I'd have brought that quote where brother brandham he was working with that young girl who was sick and he brother Brandon was saying asking her she had Faith she saides I do he said' no you don't' and then he looked at that that light fixture whatever it was and he began to cause it to move back and forth back and forth and and she said you know who did who did it did did you do it or God how she brother did God did it or Lord Jesus did it yeah or the devil that's what that's right and then he says no I did it and you and I must understand so if that be the case it is a law it is a law and the prophet of God that revelation of that law was revealed to him and he was operating it now he's not the only one you don't even have to be Sav to operate it amen because the Hindus and and all of them they can take knives and stick it down their throat and don't you try it and you know what I mean and through you and walk on Co of fire no burn no scar no blood no nothing hook their faces and I no pain but what it ain't mine over matter is Faith amen it's faith I don't care M over a matter my mind could never get over that matter it takes Faith Amen to operate that right now I don't know how true this is and please it's not in the message anywhere but I forgot what brother it was he told me he was hunting with brother Brandon one time and there was a young man that was on on on uh uh in with them camping and said brother brandham said something and the brother got upset and he was the one cooking and he had little grease in the frying pan he said he took that frying pan and he threw the grease in brother braham's face now I don't know how true it is I'm just going by what he said if so be true still yet he said it didn't burn it didn't Scorch he said brother brandham never Flinch he wiped the grease off his face and said to the brother is exactly what I I said exactly what I meant i' have died if that had been me if it be true but but whether or not it is or no the fact is that's what faith does when it is undisturbed and he told the one brother he said only fear is what burn you not the fire fear see so you know you look at that kind of a thing and you think to yourself Lord you know I got to be there amen you see nothing could have harmed Jesus if he hadn't laid his life down amen amen right he would have never died if he had not surrendered it see it was something he had to do in order for that to even happen to him as a man oh think about it think about it now here it goes in in in Psalms uh 50 and I'm not even there yet Psalms 50 and we're going to begin at the 19th verse is this okay it's it's kind of piercing thou giveth th mouth to evil and thy tongue refra refrain deceit thou sth and speaketh against thy brother thou slander thy own Mother's Son these things has thou done and I kept silence thou thest that I was alog together such a one as thyself see he thought but I will reprove thee and set them in order before Thine Eyes now consider this he's telling them to think ye that forget God lest I tear you in pieces and there be none to deliver so using this I want you to understand how God hates that if God is saying I will tear you into the pieces that ain't that's no joke you know that's serious language serious language and we are so Carefree y'all hear what I'm saying right tell you into pieces and there be none to deliver whoo offereth praise glorify me and to him that orderthe conversation remember I said that last night that means means when you order something you already have thought about what you want you go to a restaurant you know what you order you know what you're looking at you order your day I'm going to be holy today you order your conversation and your conversation is your lifestyle amen I will not you put the dos and the don'ts this is what I'm going to do this is what's going to happen this is what's not going to happen right and in all of that you're praising God for giving you the strength to do it you're praising him he said and and and order with his conversation a right a right will I show the salvation of God you listed you put down all the right you're going to do today amen amen he said then I'll show you the salvation of God and ain't God good the power of thought because think about it oh this is good to me I don't know why but he did the omnipotent Elohim self-existing one thought about me thought about you and that's why you here think about it God the Almighty you just didn't happen this is not some some uh freak Show from Evolution this is reality that God thought about you and think about it his thoughts were good amen amen is that the word he thought good about you and he was going to give you and expected in it wasn't evil God thought good of you amen the evil came by the serpent am but his thoughts have never changed about you it can never change nothing and so to prove that it could never change he died for you even while you was a sinner amen hallelujah but he loved you even when you was a sinner amen his thoughts think about it I'm the breathing living thought of God so are you amen and he knows your downsitting you're Uprising you're going in you're coming out he knows all of that about you because it is all his thoughts that you are living by amenu oh come on somebody I often wondered how on Earth God God could call Saul who is Paul to be an apostle or an angel of God you see what it was it was Satan history God you see what I'm saying Satan always tried to to interfere with the program of God always right always he tried to stop it from happening matter of fact he knew that if he could get Moses amen stirred up enough to deliver the children of Israel he was going to produce Mo make Moses become a murderer he knew Mo Moses was a warrior he knew he set him up but what he failed to see that when he set Moses up God was waiting him on him in the back of the desert amen and sometime that's what happen God puts us in predicaments and it look like we go out down like a loser but that's where God wants you to lift you up amen because his thoughts cannot come back to him void I don't care how Wicked you've been I don't care what you've been into what you struggling with now God's promise is that he will see you as a bride without spot without wrinkle without blemish amen God said so amen God said so this not about my thoughts it's about his thoughts amen and that's why he said let this mind be in you not the negative stuff not the stuff that's going to send you to hell cuz you weren't designed for that he said you're not the children of Wrath you're Children of the day not the Children of the Night come on you heard that amen The Children of the Night don't hear it you've heard it Hallelujah and he said look take these thoughts now this is one of the things that I thought I said Lord that's why the word of God according to Peter 1 1 13 wherefore girdle up the Lo of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ now let me ask you that scripture has has been fulfilled in your life when this message came to you that was a revelation of Jesus Christ amen at the Revelation and he says look Hope to the end what for the grace of God that'll be brought to you amen this revelation of Jesus Christ is bringing Grace yes amen come on somebody it's bringing grace to you why because the scripture says we all look like the children of wrath we all had that old cabur uh thing going on come on but it took a prophet said but in the midst of that cabur God had a wheat germ we wouldn't have never thought about it we would have never known it now let me let me show you say this to you so the wheat germ is on the inside but the cuur still exist y amen your flesh ain't nothing a cur that's just the way don't even think that's wheat that ain't no wheat amen that's your enemy praise the Lord amen it's wild and untamable if you if you don't is that the truth show you how Wild it is it goes right back down to James James said that tongue is unruly amen that tongue right is unruly that's what happened in the beginning sin started too with the tongue you shall not that word changed it that thought changed right and so that tongue always it it's ready to say something contrary to the thought of God is that right it's true it's always amen with the stripes I'm Healed that tongue will say man I feel bad right now right that tongue just set something to fire amen it kindled something that he should should be dead but he just kindled your feelings he kindled something and when you accept that guess what you feel worse like you've heard me say many times the devil can't curse you but he knows you got the ability to curse yourself cuz what God has blessed can no man curse amen right but out of your mouth you can give leave way to the enemy to your flesh Soul and Spirit out of your mouth you you bring an interest to the enemy is that all right now the Bible tells us also be not conformed to this world but transformed by the renewing of your mind your thinking capacities your where you think youro your the seat of your emotions and everything else is laying right there he said but be renewed there that means amen uh you once was new now you got to be renewed there was a point there's a mind that belongs to you that's got to be brought back to you and that's the mind that you lost by way of the fall right because the mind that Adam had was the mind of Christ amen amen and he would have passed that mind on because remember the brother R talks about he says listen he said he said Adam and Eve they would have come to it but God's perfect way of creation was by Spoken Word right but he and then he goes on to prove that to you in the future home he said said when we get over there he said we won't have any sex glands he tells about the story when he went beyond the curtain of time that woman who was 90 something years old she embraced him and everything else amen there was no sex glands there because that's what's got us going wild right now amen you have to kill that joker every day don't you even think it don't you even try it you think you so super spiritual you better put that your foot on that Serpent's neck every day amen ain't God good to us listen how do you know you're out of the will of God is when you know you're covering something and so many people it is a natural thing brother Bram said that when Adam and Eve and sin Adam and Eve sin they hid themselves from God and that sin that you cover is the thing you need to be delivered from it is the thing that will send you to hell why because you haven't placed it under the blood amen am I making sense your thoughts is that I'm safe by not allowing it to be known no you're not safe you're in a danger zone hello somebody I'm not saying tell me you got to tell God Amen you see I'm not no priest or Pope that I can wash your sins if I could I wash everybody's sin plus my own but my point is amen covering is dangerous amen because amen covering like Adam and Eve is dangerous but the grace of God was with them God told them they surely die right and he and they did both spiritually and I mean I'm sorry uh both uh yeah spir and God comes around and he reconnects them right save them by his grace and they die spiritually right um naturally is the point I'm making right they're saved but they died naturally right why because the blood covered them that's how come they lived the blood covered them right aen he tried to hide that sin and he caused death unto others not just only to himself so I'm showing you what covering sin will do not only will it kill you but it'll also kill and affect your loved ones amen your animal your dog your cat whatever you got it curses hello come on when they kill a can they kill everything his children his wife his animals everything burned everything he owned see that's how effective God's word you must align your thought see and had aan confess before it was uncovered perhaps the grace of God would have been with him but he had to be uncovered his sin had to be exposed now watch this because remember most of the people that sins are exposed they don't ever repent have you ever seen one you ever seen one Fallen preacher that ever repented I'll use a preacher for an example when they were exposed but had they repented and come clean before you see I'm just just throwing that out y'all looking at me y'all my point is it's got to be that sin you cannot see God with sin that's not confessed amen okay I I I don't know what God put that in at the last minute while I was out there and he showed me ananas and Safar see just a simple sin and all they did was try to cover it don't cover C it people it is what it is I don't care what it may be it it may be the grossest thing to somebody else's mind or thought listen all Sin is Sin amen amen there ain't no big sin and no little sin it's all Wicked and your problems ain't no if you got a liar and a thief they're all wrong amen it's all fruits of the Flesh and not one of us I don't care who you may be we have no right to look down on anybody because of a shortcoming in somebody's else's flesh you might not have that problem but you got something amen amen y'all hear what I'm saying that's the only kind of love we supposed to have huah that's the only kind of love but my point is when the sin is covered you are in danger zone and the only way that you can be delivered is to uncover it and I'm going to tell you something this this is how I've learned this is how I've grown and I'm giving a testimony by going before God and calling it exactly what it is and said I need you deliver me from this I can't do it Lord you know and I'm going tell you something if you have a love for it tell him that's not wrong it's wrong to say talk to God and and oh I hate this thing no you don't cuz you're still doing it amen you got to love for it there's a spirit that loves it there's a pleasure in sin and the only way you can be to delivered is to say Lord but your thoughts concerning this is not the way it is with Amen in my life and I want your thoughts I want to hate what you hate I want to love what you love and so therefore I need you to renew my mind CU like I told you the problem is in the mind amen is your thoughts concerning the thing right so I'm working with that because I want you to understand that's where we are today in order to go forward in other words if a drain is stopped up it'll never it'll never it'll never drain properly until it's unplugged unstopped and if you want the Holy Spirit to flow through you like it's supposed to then that thing that's blocking the drainage the blocking the way of entrance must be unplugged unstopped am I'm going to tell y'all something just like this there things there were things I I stuttered I could didn't want to admit but I had to yeah I'm just telling you that's how you overcome be honest with God only the pure in heart shall see God all right and you keep you keep confessing it you keep asking for deliverance I don't care if you fall 20 minutes later you keep asking and showing God your sincereness about him delivering you and he will deliver you every time every time every time listen what the word of God says in Psalms 41 and I mean 14 and 2 the Lord lookth down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand and seek God they all all gone aside they are all together become filthy there is none that doeth good no not one not the preacher not the Deacon not the y'all hear what I'm saying or Prophet or anyone we had all come short of the glory of God this is what I'm saying what we need to see is the love of God for us amen if you can see this eternal predestinated love of God it'll make you want to repent amen like brother Adam said Lord you calling for a perfect people take this out of me take this out of me take this out of me why because I want to be perfect for the perfect place see your motive and objective is what God is looking at huh Romans 4:17 it says as it written have made the a father of many nations before whom he beli even God who Quicken the dead and call those things would be not as though they were and that's what you and I must learn how to do it's has nothing to do with your feelings your feelings got has nothing to do with it it's calling it The as you know what you want to be a perfect man that's what you say Amen it almost make you feel like a liar and a hypocrite I'm a I'm perfect amen in Christ Jesus by his grace Hallelujah I'm full of all of his virtues I don't care if you just stumbled a five minutes ago said no matter what you made me do devil I still got it yeah I got it am right you have to call those things you got to pull for it remember because your words go out meet God's thought God thought comes back and Quicken it make it right for you that's what God does no no not one is that right oh listen I I thought about it and I I I can't remember where the man of God said it but and now you know if you don't put it right in that in the program like it says it you will never get get it but so let me paraphrase it he basically said when you need a a something is going on in your life he said choose a character that's going through the same thing and you become him that's the essence of what he said right so if you going through something you got a Goliath in your in your in your life you become David amen right and now you you follow what David did you follow David's attitude cuz that's God's thoughts David caught God's thoughts it was all of those uh his brothers and all of Israel who was shaken in their shoes because they had their own thought their own thoughts brought fear yes their all thoughts brought unbelief come on somebody their own thoughts made them uh how would I say it not a loser but they were were not Victorious but David caught God's thought God Who Who Are You You uncircumcised philis and watch what he's working with he's working with a man who knows not God uncircumcised he uses that term come on and because he's really saying you devil amen right now we know circumstances of the heart now we're not working with the natural but he says you devil how can you boast yourself against the Living God God Amen see so he caught God's thought and he flowed with God's thought now David knew never knew how exactly God was going to do it but he he like I like you've heard me say many times he could have done a a a Cod wheel and a backwards flip before he threw that stone and he knew God was going to kill a giant with that's how his faith was he'd rather put his life online to stay with the thought of Goden because he knew the thoughts of God would save him amen see and that's how it is the Bible is they are this is the thought of God these words are what God thought from the beginning and if we can and and that's what I was working with meditation meditation because as Christians we don't do much of that we don't more less pray yes let's meditate but meditate is mean to uh uh you can sing it you can hum it you can but you take uh the word of God and you think about it you allow it to consume you like for instance Paul says amen according to uh Philippians 14 14 I can do all things through Christ which strengthen is me now the Bible says and I'm going to get to that scripture because I'm I'm moving a little bit too fast but but it goes on and says if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things amen hallelujah you meditate on the word of God and that word becom becomes you and you becomes the word because you are God's thoughts it is collect it is a collecting of God's thoughts and bringing them into your heart and that collection of God thought become you and you become amen let's put it this way scientists know that men can be brainwashed yes a a scientist they can they can literally take you through H uh uh experiences and literally change your name and you won't remember what it is they can take a coward and make him a warrier yeah just by feeding him thoughts thoughts thoughts right amen and that's forcing what about the man whosoever will what about the one who wants it to happen what about the one who says Lord renew my mind wash me clean like David says wash me wash me clean create in me a clean heart see that's where we are created I want your thoughts to be my thoughts I want your ways to be my ways I want your words to be my words I want to speak like you speak and talk like you talk and brother brandom said that's exactly what God wants to do in you live his life through you see through your eyes speak through your mouth hear by way of your ears that's what he wants Hallelujah God's thoughts and think about it you'll never perish Heaven and Earth will pass away but you'll stand cuz you are the word think about it see that's where we've been we've been wasting I won't say wasting time but but but put it this way Abraham had had a revelation when he called those things that be not as though they were Abraham caught a revelation cuz he said God said so amen see it ain't what appeared look like we're growing older and you know what I'm saying but God says we are in a Rapture amen we're being changed right now amen right now it doesn't matter what it looks like we're being changed from Mortal to immortality amen right now amen that's what the word say Paul was so convinced he says nay in R 8:37 n in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us see what I'm saying he said because he loved us we are more than conquerors not because we love him because he loved us we are more than conquerors wo come on somebody for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor Angel nor principality nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord Hallelujah and when that bundle of love was was born in a manger I was in there am you were in there come on somebody we traveled from Heaven to Earth and now we're changing from Earth to Glory by way of Jesus Christ the first Adam had all these natural bodies in him the second Adam had all the spiritual oh my look what he says in the message uh here you him is this okay I don't have time he said he that believeth not in is condemned already before you even get started we condemned you were born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies no matter how much you was dedicated on the altar how many times you were sprinkled baptized poured water it whatever it is you still a that's all until you repent and God recognizes and seal that promise with the Holy Spirit that's right then you're born again then you're Sons and Daughters of God it's a regeneration a new creation and that's another thing we are allowing Satan to make us think that we are a patched up job yeah Lord but we are New Creation listen the scripture says All Things Are pass away oh right and behold all things have become new that's the way it's supposed to be amen but it is our thoughts that make us feel like it's a p up job you and I must come to the place and tell devil you've been lying to me a long time I am a new creation and all things have passed away then when you began to speak like that all of those things must pass away because the word is active the word is active the word is active it's his thought we must speak then you're born again then you Sons and Daughters of God is a regeneration a new creation then your attributes your thoughts are not like they were your life is not like it was you become a complete surrendered vessel to God and he speaks and uses you and you're not your own no more you but you've been brought with a price that price of the Precious Blood of the Lord Jesus think of it now it's instant they cried to cut div they try try to cut out Divine Healing off from salvation see what I'm saying now you look at this thing and so you and I understand what the word of God says now as our brother conly gave me that quote which is so true if you don't believe in Divine Healing you're lost you there's no Rapture for you there's no eternal life because God is Divine Healing yes sir amen there's no such thing as being in his presence or where he's at and sickness can abide hey that's why the Bible says over there there'll be nothing that will defile there'll be nothing that you know Li there's nothing that will will change that over there because there's no way you can stand before Holy Fire no germ can stand before Holy Fire now so that we can understand this is why our thoughts are so important now uh our thoughts must coincide it doesn't mean it doesn't mean Satan is not going to fly into your head see and that's the thing what the devil does he says oh I let's just use this let's just use this S as a scenario oh I just feel like smoking and you all to tell him go ahead on you go ahead on and smoke because I'm not amen he uses the first person to make it think that's you thinking that y'all hear what I'm saying that's what he does he used the first person to make you think you were thinking that and he gets into your head and he brings that thought to you remember I said you'll never sin if you don't listen to his thoughts but he does it he brings that that and listen people don't want to think he's got an anointing but he brings feelings with it he brings feelings he says oh I feel like doing this and he brings that anointing to you got to say I rebuke you devil cuz my thoughts are pure and clean before God Amen see somewhere you got to learn that's maturity amen I'm teaching you now teaching you how to combat the devil when he comes with those negative thoughts you've got to say no this is it it is written it is written Hallelujah you ain't got to jump scream and holler you say it is written and walk away from it cuz when you walk even if you got to express a walking you move out of that oppress anointing if you stay there that anointing will be there with you and eventually it will convince you to do what it wants you to do yes brother there it is reasoning he will reason with you you know you want to do it yes that's what he does see the devil know has been has known that offes yours a long time now he knows what you like he ain't no guess work he ain't guessing amen but the point is you got to let him know you are a new creation is that the truth now God knows his the truth I tell you what when I got saved it was no problem leaving my so-called friends behind because they left me is that right they saw that Holiness and they didn't want it the devil is the same way once he see you really serious about your holiness he ain't going to bother you he'll leave you he might come back for a season to see whether you really mean it still but he ain't going to be fellowshipping with you when you all talking about Holiness and praising the Lord and God is good he don't want to hear that stuff he want he want to see you defile yourself or bring yourself into a a mental state where he got you all impr prison in your mind we've been set free people we've been set free your thoughts must be Freedom the voice of many Waters cry out thickness in multitudes the voice of those seven stars in his hand every Church age preaching the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism in Jesus name speaking in tongues the power of God the resurrection of Christ the second coming Divine judgment the voice of many Waters coming forth from this one that looked like the son of man many Waters what it'll be to know to know that you see it set in meetings and heard that and you should get right with God and receive the Holy Ghost and a drifting soul to hear that voice speak out of the meeting that you set in and heard the Judgment of God preach and refused it the Great Falls just before you The Great Cat cataracts that'll take you to your Eternal Doom brother B said Hell Fire will seem like a pleasure he said 100 times over worse is this place called hell no way to describe it y'all hear what I'm saying amen how you going to to do it now I want you to understand that was the only thing that made Cain different Cain thought contrary to the word and even though God brought the thought his thought his intent to Cain Cain still refuse to accept the thoughts of God am and that's what condemns us is when we refuse to take the thoughts of God versus our own thought and our own reasoning Lord help us die to ourselves amen I'm going jump now but look what he says he goes on to say but God knows the thoughts and intents of the heart he knows all about it he said to the Pharisees you hypocrite how can you speak good things when I out of the abundance of the heart speaketh the mouth calling me master good and I know I can look right through you and see that you're hypocrit you don't mean that oh what will that be on that day when that voice Thunders out of many Waters many Church agents forming out now I want to ask you something else let me say something to you people that's saved let me say this to you now you drifting Souls you P Drifter Drifters that's drifting over the great cataracts y be careful it'll be a horrible thing when you know that there's no saving for you then you can get you can you can't get saved then you know your doom lays right before you when you know within a few minutes you'll hear the voice speak out depart from me you workers of iniquity and into Everlasting fire which is prepared for the devil and his Angel you'll know when you hear that Great Falls or roaring of those voices of those meetings while you're passing out of this oh what a horrible thing what a nightmare don't let it happen to you people repent get right with God now while you can get right I I listen let me say it like this I'm reading this because a close friend of mine just died the other day had his wake I think today and tomorrow um they'll be having his funeral only 59 years old a pastor of a church lovely wife is his best friend I don't know what she's going to you know I mean it's going to be pretty hard children Family Church he's out there hunting he's in the the what you call it the tree place tree stands he catches a heart attack and falls and hit the ground dead they couldn't revive him but one thing about him he's got a true testimony amen he was a real Christian if I've ever seen one Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying but the point is God didn't give no warnings God don't have to make you sick before you die and a lot of time we think we got to feel something that no God can call your number right now and you boom the point is you must be ready when that thing when God calls your number I thank God for our brother Sam I I feel bad because I've been trying to go back and visit some of my old friends for years and even when I was in line I can I'm going back I'm going back and I hadn't been on the East Coast for a long time I got awesome friends there and I told her sister today I sure want to get there before all of them leave me you know I I love him and Samuel he he knows now he can see you know and I you know I just thank God for him uh you know especially the testimony uh of his life you know and uh you know he's going on to meet with God that's another one I'll see when that Resurrection come amen but you know I'm saying that because you don't know when that hour is going to come you can look like a picture of health and gone but if your thoughts are contrary to God's thoughts like brother say God will judge what's the life that's in you amen not what you portray it's what's in you that speaks to God Philippians 4:8 finally my brethren I'm not going I'm not going to finish this I see finally my brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any what virtue if there be any praise think on these things now virtue is strength vert if there be it says listen these things are the things that bring strength to you amen which in turn would bring praise right and I thought about what is a good report what is a good report the Bible says now Faith is the substance of things hope for the evidence of things seen for by it the elders obtain a good report Hallelujah that's a good report Faith amen faith in God faith in God's word faith that acted upon his thoughts am faith is what gave them a good report through faith we understand that the world was framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made by things which do appear we had a prophet tell us what it was about God thought it he spoke it it [Applause] created right that's exactly right he believed his own word he's his thoughts expressed and you must believe if God got to believe his own word you got to believe it how can God deny his own word he cannot and if God is in you it can't help but to believe it amen by faith April offered unto God of all excellent sacrificed and came by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gift and by it being dead yet speak it now it's powerful to me that is so powerful to me when God judges you to be righteous and holy he makes a way for that to happen and how does he do it by revealing it revealing your airing ways is God righteousness toward you and so when he reveals your erroring ways and you find a way to fix it like abble did it was a revelation the blood of Jesus Christ was his Revelation and he received it and repented and he offered unto God the very thing God gave to him and God said you righteous come on somebody so God just just he's not just more than just he's he's he's merciful because he comes and he reveals to us our aing ways and say repent if you repent I know you're mine Hallelujah that's what he says that's basically what it is cuz Cain saw the thoughts of God and walked away from it and where did God mock him in his head is that all right so we look at that and then then uh he says by Enoch this where and and my brother gave me some good quotes I I was back there St I had to lay them down but it's true the Enoch because remember and I'm going to get to that quote in just a minute I'm about there by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god without faith is impossible to please God now here it is Enoch testimony final test I'm sure it was it probably didn't say that but let me put it this way he had to have a final test Jesus had a final test Moses had a final test right uh you look at it there's always that one thing that God will try you with to see whether you are true Overcomer now Jesus's test was what Calvary he knew he was supposed to go through it he understood he was the one but he in his natural man he said Lord would you let this cup be passed for me see your natural man ain't going to want to do it but there's got to be something great on the inside which is representation that will overcome that nevertheless not my will but thine be done you think Peter then was all happy praise God I'm going to be crucified you know that flesh come on somebody let's get real with it but Peter overcame it and he was so bold with it he said don't crucify me like my Lord turn me upside down I'm not even worthy to be crucified like him come on somebody they must have look at him like he was a fool and he was one for Christ see so but he knew the thoughts of God why because God told him this is what this was your ear you go back right come on somebody Paul to God told Paul what his Destiny was going to be you're going to meet Nero right you'll die at his chopping block and Paul said oh death wears your stain oh great you see they knew the thought they stayed with the thought of God even unto death if it's God's will for me to die so be it because I rest in his peace right so let's move on so Enoch I put it this way Enoch final test oh I wish I could have anybody ever seen and I hate to say things now because I I'll be messing up sometime but have any of y'all seen where brother brandom said God I mean Enoch wave goodbye to his family okay is in there somewhere I didn't even know he had a family he say way goodbye to his wife I'll find it I just wish I could put it all together like some of these people can but nevertheless even I say didn't have one but think about it when Enoch walked with God Amen when Enoch walked with God Amen he was by himself the whole world was against him and here was a man living a holy life corruption was setting in and he's standing with the word of God now he had to believe that he would be translated otherwise he would not have had he he wouldn't have happened Jesus Christ when he went down to the Grave he had to believe that scripture I will not let uh corruption set in what's the suffer my Holy One yeah I think that's in Isaiah or Psalm one or two I will not let suffer my Holy One to see corruption he had to believe that that had to be a faith to him before he he would go down he had to believe he was coming up amen that's why the Bible said those they died in faith they know they coming up they know there's a resurrection Joseph said take my body out of Egypt put it back in the promised land cuz there's coming the resurrection he died in faith believing in the resurrection and so will you I don't care how beat up your body may be when you get ready to go down you got to believe one day I'm coming up amen you got to believe it by God's grace but without faith it's impossible to please him but he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is rewarded them that diligently seek him now I'm going jump because I talked about meditation but I'mma jump now I just believe and it that Enoch was a meditator on the word because he walked with God now here's the quote and I read this last night I'm going to close it out on this because I'm G to finish up on Sunday then the second heaven is considered the solar system and the third heaven goes beyond that now we just happened to think just watch this a minute now Einstein proved by scientific that if two objects were was coming to each other like two cars coming down across the road and if we're coming fast enough now they really have to be going fast like a billion miles per second but they could pass right through one another and never disturb disturb a thing you know I probably could give this quote to a scientist and if he can produce a machine that could actually move something at a billion miles per second I guarantee you the work brother ROM threw things in there like he didn't understand what was happening but I'm going tell you something now you can find out some of these things that he said scientists are now declaring them now see so you know you look at these things and and you sometime we we we listen to him and we anyway but they could pass right through one another and never disturb a thing the speed would do it pass them right through one another without disturbing anything now I I'm standing here not long ago at Mount Paloma California and I was noticing there a telescope that can see hundreds and 20 million years of light space now that now think 120 million years of light space how many miles that would be to be broke down see but yet Heaven is so many billions and billions and billions of light years beyond that till it's not even thought of how would we get there it's the travel it will be it will be like the Mind think about it it will be like the mind it's so fast it'll be faster if you could think of Heaven that's how quick you'll be there Jesus after he was resurrected came right through the wall right through the door and stood and ate bored fish and honey comb Hallelujah speed no sooner than life has come out of this body we're in the presence of God y he said billions and billions and billions of miles now I I know what he said he said it's a dimension but I think if he's if you working with I don't know how you do that because they said there's now a way that you can actually instead of going around you can go through I don't know the scientific terms on that but you know they say it's a giant now they talks about wormholes and all these kind of things these things exist so my point is think about this because here we are in our minds and God got certain things laying there dorming for his use see Jesus Christ didn't have no problem with hybrid Foods he had a perfect mind his functions were perfect right and God could use him perfectly but here we are if I I be look at it one of these old days let's put it this way one of these old days and I know y'all gonna think I'm crazy but you're going to be thinking about the Rapture or perhaps you might be dreaming about the rapture but whatever it is the rapture is going to be on your mind and before you know it you going to be raptured amen because you'll be able to catch God's thoughts for that period and for that time amen and when you catch it see nobody else will catch it only those who are designed and got the mind of Christ Hallelujah come on somebody and when you got the mind of Christ you going to catch that thought and before you know it you'll be swept away amen come on somebody and God going to make it so easy for us brother he'll begin to let us see loved ones and that in itself will cause us to think about it oh come on somebody it will be truly a real Faith Builder don't you feel that don't you feel that amen amen that's God's mind he's not going to just leave us alone and say f for yourself he has fought the Battle for us every inch of the way he'll never leave us nor forsake us let's stand I will start by God's grace Sunday on what is truth and that will be exactly where I'm still working with it the thoughts of God what is truth that's truth God's word is truth amen we're living in an age in a day now where they are legalizing sin come on somebody let's just use shorts brother B say it's wrong the world say it's right I mean he shows and Prov that's a woman's garment reasoning to say it ain't wrong God's word said it is the bride will say it is you love the Lord let's pray father God we come before you Lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for your grace in your mercy and love Lord keep our hearts our minds our thoughts clean and pure Lord
