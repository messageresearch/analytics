of what Christ has done for you the more the enemy is gonna fight you when he sees that you're getting close to that perfect revelation of the message and when I say that I'm not talking about in your head I'm talking about in your heart and when that message is in your heart and you realized that nothing can stop you he's gonna pull all his troops out against you is that right that's why he took all those demons out of the river Euphrates cuz he knows the bride is gonna come to that perfect revelation and all of his artillery won't be able to stop us why because we are the word and right now it may seems like in your life you've failed a lot and you've come short but this is not a time to disbelieve God you understand me the sacrifice has already been made right the warfare has already been accomplished it's not if you win we've already won to those who can believe that to those who can receive that I don't care what situation you know I look at things and think about Harlan it nice last few months or whatever last this whole of the year or whatever I've been going through any kind of battle there has I mean Satan has been coming from every side but he doesn't understand when he gets next to me I run to my daddy I've got to help I've run to the tower the name of the Lord is a strong tower he's the one that keeps me he's the one that guides me he's the one that has sheltered

God called it the hare the mess of Hell the mess of hell and we're now seeing it right now people are just out of their minds things are going crazy everywhere you're going you got people everybody's crooked stealing from each other robbing each other legally and unlegal e illegal excuse me I know my even my English is not good how could I learn French [Laughter] it's okay y'all understand me I'm

to say to you and encourage you keep it up let's go higher more people were clapping and worshiping and I surely enjoyed that I would sit back there just thinking wow something's happening we want a revival and we want all of the trash out of our lives and the only way that we can get that is that we gotta call upon him we got to build one of causes god this is what we all want if it is that right everybody ought to say Amen we want a real revival and God is more than it you know the Bible says if we call on him he'll answer and so let's keep praying don't worry about your conditions the revival will take care of it but keep praying God revival we need revival we need revival here and I'm not talking about a world where I would Bible we know that's over but this church could have a revival this as an individual you can have a revival Amen so let's keep praying keep praying keep praying I believe I see things I'm seeing things that's happening and I am excited because I know it it's moving it's moving in a positive way so I thank God for its grace before I forget the third week of June we're gonna have another youth meeting I call it the youth meeting but I mean everybody is
