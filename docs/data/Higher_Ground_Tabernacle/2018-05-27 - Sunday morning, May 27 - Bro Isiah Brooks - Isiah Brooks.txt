not interested wealth or riches there's one thing I'm interested in and that's Jesus Christ as we stand appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ for being so good to us you know I believe if I serve God he'd give me whatever I desire if his gold if it's silver if it's whatever because the Bible said if we ask anything in his name and believe in it they shall be given to us and I believe that you know that I figure it's like this when I marry Jesus I marry everything Matthew 16 please we have our dear friends with us brother Jared and his girlfriend mckaela they were with us on Wednesday we welcome you we're just a little group serving the Lord and we do our best we're not we may not have all of the fine things of most churches but one thing that we do have and that is the word of the Living God that is what's drawing the people it's not brother Isaiah or anyone of course it's not the music we love to have that God is going to bless us with that and we see them we see it all in the making and we just thank God for all that we have you love the Lord Matthew 16:24 I feel very emotional and very full this morning just because God has been so good to me Matthew 16 hallelujah Matthew 16:24 then said Jesus unto his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it for what is a man profited if he should gain the whole world and lose his own soul what shall a man give in exchange for his soul let's pray father God we come before you we thank you for your grace and your mercy surely you have been better to us and we have been to ourselves there are no words that can express our gratitude we thank your father for being at all in all we see you every day in every step we make go to bed you're there for us we thank you for your amazing grace Lord we pray that your perfect will be done here this morning breaking the straw every yoke of the enemy deliver your people from all of the leaf we ask these things and your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated we were out to lunch with a brother and we were just talking by God's grace just how we are now facing Satan in a way that we've never had - it's tough but don't forget that your greatest enemy is not Satan as you our desires versus cause desires our will versus God's will when I believe that this is why Jesus Christ had to pray so vehemently there in the Garden of Eden because he himself had to die to his own will father would that this cup pass for me but not my will but thine be done so I drew up a topic the life of a warrior because I think oftentimes we as Christians forget that we are in a battle this battle is not easy anybody know how difficult it is to carry across but not only did Jesus carry a cross but he said those who follow me must carry on a cross is a symbol of shame it is a symbol of judgment it is a symbol that you are rejected the Bible said cursed is a man that hang at the pond the tree and we know that our Lord became a curse that we may become blessed but we are warriors this battle that we are now fighting is not something that just started before the foundation of the world we know that this battle was in array the Word of God said that Lucifer raised up he said with in his heart I will ascend above God I will ascend above the throne of God and I will cause the stars of God to worship me and of course when Lucifer made statement he had us in mind but thank God for Calvary the devil may say to you that you are of no value but you mean everything to God because Adam exemplified that as I said Wednesday Adam said and he had the whole world in his hands all that he had amen was beautiful he had a wife and she fell and Adam lost and gave up everything for his wife basically in himself he was saying paradise won't be the same without you who I love that I love that I love that it thrills me to know that God didn't want to live without me and you we realized they'd been when we talk about fighting we stood in that day you said brother Brooks I don't remember neither do i but we understand that the Word of God for our day tells us that we were in the mind of God and during that battle we stood with Christ there was a third or so that actually failed believe Satan's lie and we now call them demons but those demons one time were in a church service so was Lucifer they all worship God in the beginning but Lucifer started the rebellion y'all hear me now and in this rebellion God allowed him to do it he said well what do you mean because God allowed demons all those angels God knew would fall after Lucifer's preaching and now we see it happening all over again because Jesus is the Alpha and the Omega what happened in the beginning we are now seeing in the ending and we see by God's grace that those who stood with God or Christ in that day he's now standing with us cuz really no man can conquer Lucifer except Jesus himself because he was the greatest of all the Angels you know Beauty thought he was could see who the man could sing but in all of that he got lifted and right then the battle started Lucifer caused the first church split because of his own will now we talk about now now are we now so you understand by God's grace in our natural self there's no way we can conquer Satan believe you me he is the god of this age everything is now about the devil right all of the demons out of hell all the Hollywood stars and all of them that they are producing where do you think the inspiration comes from it doesn't come from heaven there's no violence in heaven there's only peace and joy and happiness holiness y'all you know what I'm saying here now you say what brother what are you saying I'm trying to get us to a place and I need to hurry up with this God is looking for warriors warriors are people who are trained most warriors are born warriors a warrior is a person who is engaged or experienced in warfare it's like when you get ready to have an operation you're not gonna happen some God that just graduated yesterday operate on you you want somebody that's in season somebody who's gone through the test of trials of failure but yet they knew how to spring back is that okay a warrior though he is faced with fear his courage the fear that's why the Bible tells us that love conquers fear cashes out hallelujah is that Alright God want this bride to be valiant want us to be bold and courageous and brave hallelujah we ought not to be afraid of the devil because the devil can't do me no harm hallelujah think about it if Satan in history y'all know about Napoleon some of us have read of him he died at the age of 33 amen and the message great in our mighty Conqueror we know that Napoleon amen conquered everything and you know he was one that Keller was like an astrologer he watched the moon he watched the stars he watched all those things to see win and the season was right to conquer his enemy and he came over into France and he become a great warrior he put me me to death because that they wouldn't agree with him and he cleaned his entire country of anything that was against him I like that because that is the marking of a real warrior he doesn't want anything to remain in his kingdom that will later on become a threat remember the time Amen God told us all kill everything and Saul was a warrior for his day he did great things but he made a mistake because he meant the word of the Lord told Saul to kill everything and saw thought within himself his own reasoning see a warrior a good warrior amen shows how to follow instructions without deviating hallelujah why because he realized the authority above him is more powerful more knowledgeable and more experienced than he himself so he knows the teacher knows what he's teaching and him saw had only understood that God spoke to him God knows what he's doing God doesn't need you to add or take away he said kill everything and because of the people so I thought that he has saved the best of the sheep and the oxen and all of these good things and oh you know I'm going to save the King to anybody knows a king is born a king and if it's a boring King he has to have followers and that's why all nations make sure they kill the king right because they know if they kill the king they've stocked out the kingdom but Saul thought ha I saved this King samuel came and said saw what have you done it's okay now I'm talking about warriors because you got to understand a warrior knows how to follow instructions and so a man said but I've done everything God told me to do Sam you're being a prophecy but what do I hear in the background I hear some sheeps I hear goats I hear all these animals in the background but you see okay so I Samuel what I did I thought I do God a service without it being his will God don't need your service he needs your beedi ins and as long as obedience is within his service you are accepting so Saul comes along and and Samuel says no no no no no no no you have not done what goddess is say so don't you understand that snow stubbornness is like witchcraft obedience is better than sacrifice bring me that King hallelujah and what did Sam you do he cut that king up he killed him because he was Elias about doing the will of God yeah I understand me it seems like them the word is brutal but you got to understand that was a shadow and the type of what's happening man if you don't kill the demons in you that demons will kill you the whole purpose about demons is to send your soul in my soul to hell how can we escape it by being obedient when it came to Napoleon I like it because even though Napoleon was the negative part of what God is doing see Christ was the same way he was a conqueror who conquered at the age of 33 hallelujah and just like Napoleon will not allow anything in his kingdom that will work against him so is Jesus Christ Jesus Christ will not allow Saint to know anything about Satan to enter into his kingdom you talk about a warrior he's the greatest of all warriors who is this ok Psalm 16:11 through 12 says give us help from trouble for vain is the help of man through God we shall do valent Lee for he it is that shall tread down our enemies see the powers not within us it's not us that that literally defeats the devil is Christ in us is that right how many y'all have heard of Shamgar one time one name one place Amen he's named hallelujah the Bible none of us knew about sham God like I preached last week sham God Amen was just almost of nobody that God made somebody Shamgar was tired he was tired just like gideon he was tired of these these people coming in and treating and invading his family what were they doing taking the substance from his family hallelujah you ought to get tired of devil coming in into your house afflicting your children hallelujah making them do things that ought not to do you ought to get tired you ought to say if God be with us where we all the miracles sham God got so mad that day he he saw them it the enemy come and he got him a oxy goat and those of us who don't know what the Ox goat is is it's a long stick a man with the end point on it to when that ox don't want to move a man the man that's riding the thing stick him giddyup and that's what that's what that's what sham God did he took that stick and he with the beating now I'm going to show you something many of us in our own power to have trouble whipping one man but under the anointing of the Holy Spirit sham God defeated 600 oh somebody help me that's the kind of God I want to serve hallelujah that can give me strength when I am weak that's the rate that's the way it goes hallelujah now we realized by God's grace said warriors now I want you to understand that there's no way I can complete this message this morning but a warrior starts off as a soldier he's recruited in such a way a man that when he's recruited him and the person or persons that's training this warrior this man to be a warrior takes him away from his family he takes him from mother father sister brother if he's got children he takes him away why because the man who's training this man wants to train him properly y'all know Heidi as though the clothes of us who've been in the military when you get in the military the man says well I'm your mama I'm your daddy I'm your brother I'm your sister I'm your all and all right now you're gonna listen to what I say I remember the time when I was at getting into the Air Force there and you know how they say well you know how do you want your hair cut we had these guys who had all day long hair and everything and I remember one guy said you know I want it like this net day and that man said come on get in my chair he got the man in the chair and he said he cut it ball he said how do you like that right why because you're no longer yours once you sign up for Uncle Sam you become Uncle Sam's property hallelujah now listen the Bible said you're not your own you're bought with a price so when you come to God you're no longer yours yourself you are the property of the Lord Jesus Christ settle the question within you you must come to know who you are first and what you are here for that's the gospel the gospel is ever is able to tell you who you are where you come from hallelujah who your mom and daddy is people say with oh my God if if I had been there if I was Eve I wouldn't have done it yes you would if I was Adam I wouldn't have done it yes you would have those people were perfect but God had a plan he knew how to place the weak one there and he knew how to do what he was doing hallelujah God didn't cause him to do it but God knew that they would you see had not Adam can you imagine this and I don't know why I'm going this way but i'ma go this way can you imagine Adam and Eve they meant there in the garden Amen at all Adam saying oh I just love you sweetie I'm just loving you and you know that's all they know is love they've never seen a rainy day they've never seen a thundercloud they've never seen snow or anything new earth in itself was perfect why because it stood straight it was the flood that rocked us this this world off its axle that's why we experiencing the Four Seasons the way we are but before then it was all paradise hallelujah is that all right and can you imagine he said oh I love you sweetie you my all and all and all in all a mine but it was when she fell it's when Eve sin is when Adams love was placed in display in such a way that even recognize what he meant by I love you you don't know whether you love somebody until they go wrong until they make a mistake that's when you know how much you love that person but as long as they doing what you want they've doing what you want them to do oh you're so sweet but when it goes bitter do you love them still oh come on somebody see that's the real deal hey that's the real deal am I qualified to say that I'm going on 41 years of marriage hallelujah it's been sweet it's been better amen but it's God's love that has kept us together Alleluia she training to become what what are you training what what this whole thing is about and and we talked about the statue of a perfect man but don't you know that's your whole armor that is only way that you're gonna will stand the devil and that is a building factor hallelujah you should all brother Brooks let me say it like this just like the property God said listen God ain't gonna just pour something in you he ain't gonna push you through the hole and push you through it come oh I want you to be saving I'm just gonna pull you this way no sir you got to do something every action even science pick that up for every action there's an opposite but equal that's Newton's law opposite for the equal reaction that's probably the only thing I remember but in all of that it is true and you know this is what I'm saying if you take one step that gotta take a - it's a training to become who you are and what you are listen we were not it was not God's perfect will for us to remain sinners God wanted to show himself Rahila he wanted to show himself our Savior he wanted to show himself a comforter and the only way he could do that just like Adam allowed Eve to sin so that sin could come in so he could show how much he really loved her and that's what God has done he is a deliverer he is a healer he's a comforter he's everything you need he wants to be that right the life of a warrior is hard hallelujah my sons were there in Iraq Co waitin and and what's the other Iraq Kuwait and there's a storm and they had the dodge bullets it was rough on them hallelujah and guess what proud kept them he said what do you mean brother there was a sister named Angela senior and y'all know her she lives all the way in Virginia and while my son was going through something God placed my son on her heart on her heart and at the same time she was praying he almost got blown up that's what he told us because we told her told him the time she called and the time this thing was happening his sergeant got hit by the bomb or whatever it was blew his brains out and my son had to go pick it up y'all hear me it was hard as real hard because now he suffer with that post-war thing but God is in control my son while he was over there Amen he got struck with some kind of disease that was literally taking his sight they sent him a man from that Kuwait and back home later into Washington DC my wife and I was running back and forth amen we got a doctor we went to prayer for him and guess what his sight is better than mine we saw the x-rays of his eyes deteriorating and we had a friend doctor who said he had never seen such a condition like that in his life but when God finished whew see God is an unseen warrior he is the greatest of all warriors the Bible call him the captain of the Lord's host and what are we being trained to do trust God with all of our hearts and lean not to our own understanding you see what I'm saying that's the first as it the first thing God wants you to do is trust him when all of the doctors that everything says there's no hope it can't be done God says all things are possible to them that believe amen see the lack of faith you can't you can't like faith one of the things they men when you being trained you're being trained that you are invisible invincible right that nothing can harm you mentally or physically and for every one of them that that that that don't come to that level of being fearless they become a threat to the whole group hmm it may because they can't afford to have somebody who's gonna fade on them in a time when they need it the most hallelujah and that's how God is God won't strong warrior God won't strong Christians God won't people who know who is not going to faint when something goes wrong to know that God is working everything you understand me the Bible even tells us without faith it's impossible to please God you've got to have it and faith is not something it's not like this book oh I'm gonna wanna wave my faith this ain't no faith this is a book faith is not a thing faith is a person huh oh yeah by faith God created the heavens in the earth is that right and the Bible tells that that Jesus Christ created everything so Jesus Christ must be say and the Bible said the just shall live by what his faith that's when you get the Holy Ghost you don't have your faith in it's his faith we make our down we might get weak but when you got God in you he's the standard hallelujah whoo is that right so while you in bootcamp hallelujah those of us who's been through some boot camp near rich rich and I and I know we've talked about things amen and you know there are times it men you're not the one that gets in trouble but you get in trouble it's somebody else go bad you go bad - they learned that all the group must suffer together right so and you look at the stingy's who are all brother Brooks is that not like God the Bible tells us when one of us hurt all should hurt when all of us having meat all should have a need hallelujah the New Testament church from Peter name was thrown in jail what happened they were warriors hallelujah they didn't fight with the natural sword but they had a spiritual sword which was a Word of God and they all went into prayer guess what happened God shook the door hallelujah he set the captive free yeah he's the same yesterday today and forever see so we look at this thing in Luke says 14 25 to 33 y'all don't mind me reading I'm hurry up though and there went great multitudes with him and he turned and said unto them if a man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters yay and his own life also he cannot be my disciples you know that word hate him like what is he saying Lord I don't understand that I could never hate my loved ones but what is he saying is that you are going to say nothing will separate me from your love if my family want to persecute me let them persecute me hallelujah but I am going to love God see when you follow Jesus you have tunnel vision a real warrior has tunnel vision hmm you say all Brotherhood's I don't know about that what about David soldiers David said I thirst I want some water hallelujah and they cut through how many miles of Philistines just to get him a drink of water those are not just stories these things like its historical facts somebody said well I don't believe it well you know this was the thing I it's a little sweet thing Kyle gave me some I said well I don't believe there's a god and that's and then I said well I don't believe you exist but brother I can't feel me touch no if God don't exist you don't either hmm help us Jesus right let me go home with the scriptures here and whosoever they're not bears cross and come after me cannot be my disciples for which of you intend to build a tower see when you become a Christian you're supposed to think about what you're doing it's not something that you just join right it's giving your life to christ to say Lord you do with my life as you choose this but if you know him just like I know a new you you you find out you're making the right choice for which of you were intended to build a tower sit it not down first and count the cost whether he has sufficient to finish it now my brother Jarrett knows all about that because he had to build little things and construct things and stuff and you know you came promised a man I'm gonna do this and you ain't got enough fund to make it you have the funds you have to have the funds and you have the supplies to finish it right and this is what God says if you go to be a Christian finish it don't start out and quit finish it don't be discouraged and quit finish it be a good warrior fight like a good soldier hallelujah Oh before I allow my God to be ashamed I'd rather go to the chopping block for the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah is that right some of y'all read the foxes Book of Martyrs amen when they were killing people and everything else a man in this one man he they were going to chop his head off or something like that I can't remember exactly and all of a sudden he got afraid and he recanted and there was a young girl in the in the in the in the in the audience and she stepped forward and she said you fool that you would give your life for a few moments of pleasure you would give eternal life up for a few moments of pleasure think about it this is just a few movements we're talking about eternal life something that we can't even grasp with our minds an eternal life where you'd never grow old you see young people here they they they young Nate they almost make perfect you know look but I don't pass that day so heaven is going to be a great thing for me without looking see myself back to a young man hallelujah the more the older you get the more glorious it becomes but nevertheless amen and that's the truth how many times and then people a man recanted and I'm gonna tell you something during that Ox age during that time Amen where those people had to suffer they suffer not Elyria you know according to those medieval medieval things that they used to do they used to put people in rotisserie I mean metal things and and cook them slowly trying to get them to say I denounced Jesus Christ you think all of that was in vain because of that we're here today and we know it's a shame because we call ourselves the same church and we can team Holly take a little teasing from the devil may God help us will help me Jesus it's just okay amen for which of you intending to build a tower said not first and counted the cost whether whether he has sufficient to finish it let's happily happy he had laid the foundation and is not able to finish it and all that behold it began to mock him how many times you going across the street or down the road you see a house that once looked like it was going to be a beautiful situation amen and then now you see grass all grown up it ain't it hadn't even been finished and you said what happened but the person went bankrupt right you don't want to go bankrupt you got to keep enough God in you to make the journey hallelujah you got to be filled to make the journey you can't come to God with a half cup this journey calls for a full tank not a half a tank hallelujah huh oh my give me like David said oh I owe you not only left my cup run or whether lost my salsa - is this okay I'm trying to get through what King going to make war against another king sit it not down first and consulted it whether he he is able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand or else while the other is yet a great off he said that them am best ambassador and desired conditions of peace so likewise whosoever he be of you that forsaken not all that he had he cannot be my disciple see this is you know God I'm willing to give up ninety nine percent no no no no you gotta give a hundred hallelujah he told that rich young ruler he said listen rich young ruler he said I say to you he said listen sell all that you have incoming and come follow me huh if that ruler would have known that that was the king of gold that was the owner of heaven and earth he dropped his bags hallelujah let me tell you something God will never take something from you and not give you more hallelujah God is a man that if you put ten dollars in the bank he'll give you 20 back he gives you high interests not one man would say Lord you owe me no sir the Bible said even if you do give them a person a drink of water in the name of the law you can inherit eternal life but you mean to tell me if I'm kind to a Christian amen will that be a Christian or not God that that that's that's an inheritance God has given me something amen that he's gonna save me at the end that's exactly right that's what he said a real warrior the Bible tells us y'all God little children and have overcome them because greater is He then he that is in the world hallelujah I love Christ by because when we put him on y'all know what I'm saying about say put on Christ now do I not only do I put him on but he puts me on high he became my sins that I might become his righteousness he's our president you make mistake but you see that God doesn't hallelujah ha because you and I have been justified hallelujah well I I felt like brother dick just now is here amen you and I have been so justified it meant in that justification means before God is though you've never seen in the first place that only is a plan applicable to you it meant when the Holy Ghost comes up to the Holy Ghost time you just a potential Christian but when God comes down and he feels you with his virtues you will never fail and you will never fall you can't you see we're in this Rama I make mistakes but not in that room hallelujah oh is this okay we run this race hey man I'm trying to hurry up now therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ hallelujah I was just telling my brother I said you know I got some children I got some it got high pain tolerance yeah and you know I was the kind of person I didn't spank my kids until they really needed it but when I would respect him I'd give him a good one I had one that was standing there like couldn't make him cry but you know with prayer the Lord harness that same stubbornness and he's right now in school going on he's got it he's got his nursing degree and getting ready to get another one but see that's that's that's determination that once he said his mind to do something he can do it he's not looking for a wife don't tell him I told you that but he'll make a good husband the only thing he's not going he's short you love the Lord I'm not trying to kid I'm just you know it's just amazing that you know God is a God of variety he the smallest of the other males but he's got that he's just tough he's tough yeah I love him you know you and I must understand a man that God is doing some great things and you know I'm gonna jump second Peter 1:3 through 11 it talks about the divine nature because that's putting on and understand no virtue is given to you you gotta fight for it you say I won't patience hallelujah patience up there yes sir brother and don't you know when you desire patient guess what the devil do he's gonna bring every trial you got everything he can put at you and he's gonna say what God don't hear you hallelujah and you know you debt dealers do about five days from now and where you think you're gonna get it from hallelujah but they that wait upon the Lord hallelujah the Bible said will renew their strength I've seen God come down in the nick of time hallelujah and guess what people I was not sweaty huh because when you touch God you don't know how he's gonna do it but remember God your father is the creator he is the creator I know people don't believe some of my testimony but I remember when I was a poor little college kid a man didn't have much of nothing he had to stay with my sister because my mama had died I had no place to live amen in roach-infested plays rats and everything else and I'm sleeping trying to sleep and they plan while I'm trying to sleep the rat saw a man you think that was a lot of fun no that was not a lot of fun hallelujah but I needed a dime a dime and God gave me a quarter y'all don't understand I had to walk everywhere and I needed a dime and back in the day they had those public phones y'all remember that some of y'all do and you put the dime in there all quarter you know it used to be smaller net but did you dial the number and everything else well I didn't have a dime and I the Lord gave me a quote cuz I promised a person something and I couldn't fulfill it I forgot that I needed to let them know that I wasn't able to come by to pick them up for church and the sister who's deceased now she saw it with her own eyes I did too we stood there in that basement all of a sudden out of the corner came a light and we were both talking and we both saw that light come out of that corner and that night did like this circuit right there and it stopped and there was a quarter God is my witness but it's true you know I've had God says listen up because my prayer life was just i pray pray pray and you know one day I was like okay I'm getting on God says I'm ambition with money not folks I'm not the only this money kicked butt let me tell you something you know I thought it was gonna come through the mail it didn't come through the mail I thought about a little knock on my door and bring me something he didn't on my way to church it had rain and I had to stop for a while - the rain stopped walking up the street just almost up to the church and in the law said didn't I promise your money I said yes Lord he said look down there the rain had folded somebody's money up but that's somebody's money became mine you think I just left it there's a tall who lost it hallelujah God did it I spent y'all listen I love God and I love heaven do you really think I stand here to tell you a lie endanger my soul it ain't happening mister truth just stuff out so much stuff but it's finally my brother be strong in the law and the power of here's what might not your mind here's mine it's warriors that's what God wants us to do hallelujah is that okay let me tell you something just like I said it's a training it is a training and you training amen you've got to grow up into Christ hallelujah God don't want you acting like the devil carrying on like the devil he wants you to grow up into Christ hallelujah and how can we grow up into Christ the Bible said according to 2nd Peter God has given us amen our entrance into his divine nature add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge chippers all the way up patient godly brotherly kindness and then God seals you with the Holy Ghost and when God seals you with the Holy Ghost don't you know it's whatsoever you say full adoption comes through hallelujah is like it's like God writes a check and gives you signs to check and say here you go son whatever you want to buy with it go back hallelujah is that okay no weapon formed against you the Bible said it shall prosper yeah I'm feeling pretty good folks are y'all gonna feel good with me don't let me feel good by myself hallelujah amen is that right y'all remember the day a man abused out drinking you didn't keep the body to yourself you passed it on we didn't care about no germs wiping the bottle nah you drink I drink if I'm gonna get drunk the whole party's about you gettin drunk with me see that's what give me some of y'all like y'all been sanctified all your life some of y'all looking at me like y'all don't know what y'all tamo maybe some of these babies in here don't know what I'm talking about because they've never experienced it but y'all know and I ain't encouraging y'all let me tell you something these people these divas out here tell you when you get drunk is wonderful it ain't wonderful you can't even stand up straight you're bumping the things and after doll overuse it and then the devil so who didn't you have a good time he said oh yeah I had a good time that ain't no good time a good time is when you can jump for Jesus oh don't get me started folks don't get me started hallelujah this is the thing I love about the scripture the scripture is so real amen it is so powerful to me a member called you think okay here's a battle here's about oh I was there nine five and seven look how he answers this question look how he answered the statement for every battle of the warrior is with confused noise and garments rolled in blood but this small this shalt be with burning and fuel of fire mmm in other words this word that I'm talking about it's gonna come with burning and fuel a fire but look up what Allah says for unto us a child is born that's the next statement that's the next unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty God the everlasting father the Prince of Peace that's what the Bible says and then we didn't understand what it was but God is conquering Satan's Kingdom by the fuel of fire but fire fire of the Holy Ghost that's what John said concept I am not worthy to loose his laches of his shoes but he that comes after me he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and we were fire because when God comes in he burns all the Devils out of you that don't mean you won't have problems but it won't come from inside out hallelujah the problems that we have is from the outside and not the inside hallelujah why because that Holy Ghost has come in whoa thank God for the Holy Ghost you love the Lord I can't finish it and I'm taking a lot of time I'm sorry but you know it's just so much what I'm learning and teaching and trying to bring to you is this whole Bible it's all about war it's just at the end of the day you see peace when Satan is cast into the lake of fire huh when all of his Devils are is actually burned why because God don't have any formal anymore hallelujah if that ain't that what you do it trash hallelujah and just think about it man God is bringing us into a place where we come to know who we are you know I used to hope years years ago I stole Lord I hope I'm saving them I'm just hoping I'm saying and then the Bible says you make your calling and election sure I don't want to be dying and thinking oh I hope I'm gonna make it hallelujah like I said I gotta have my ticket the price has already been paid hallelujah as long as I got my ticket and man I don't have to worry about getting in hallelujah come on somebody I used to work I used to work in the hotel business amen it didn't matter how many always well I made reservations show me where your brother and I want to see him and that number that I gave you you didn't no number you didn't have no reference to you purchasing that room I don't care you cried with tears you don't get it unless I have mercy hallelujah but heaven ain't gonna have mercy on you if you ain't got no ticket what is your ticket that holy goes woo people don't want that no more because they don't know how you're gonna go back and everybody act differently some people maintenance you know maybe just they made they made this stretch their eyes you know yeah but something gonna know after the stretching they know something changed y'all hear what I'm saying you don't have to have to Amen me this is God whether you can recognize him or not I'm looking at people they said Oh what you know people think see you don't know what a preacher is until you a preacher you know the probably God said every prophet lose by inspiration and I am a prophet manya minor a preacher is a minor prophet and I moved by inspiration when you know God you know God and so you said well brothers what do you say see y'all understand when I'm up here as I asked the Lord I said lord help me cuz their thoughts I hear you and I know exactly where they come from and you know so I have to be careful that I don't get in flesh because I know it's a spirit that's trying to counteract what God is trying to do and say you love the Lord I'm just stop there but I will say you know God tries the heart it doesn't matter what you say up here is what's going on in your inside what's on the inside if darkness is there you need to be delivered I've been preaching this message ever since I was 1986 1986 I've been saved every since I was 20 years old I got married I think around 21 raised I don't know how many children trying to raise them in the right way I've seen two people did raised from the dead where people say it don't happen anymore I'm a witness Jesus Christ is to say I've seen cancer delivered almost everybody in this in this church has a testimony of some kind of cancer or some amount of diabetes or some kind of something going on who did that one brother Brooks see brother Branham said if you'd preach it God will vindicate if it's the true Word of God God will vindicate I've seen God then decayed the Word of God in this place and he's not through yet the devil is mad cuz we getting ready to have a revival in this place you said what do you mean brothers you see in God's own timing but I see it coming I see what God is doing I see just a little glimpse of light coming through I'm not telling my so some major thing that's gonna sweep the world that's over but God promised that any man woman who wants revival can have and as David and that's Napoleon y'all know me I try to cut every devil out of this place every spirit y'all understand what I'm saying every spirit not people I'm my flesh I don't fight flesh and blood it's spiritual things but our whole point is its Napoleon says if you're not with me you've got to go that's the Holy Spirit he's not me I'm not talking about if you ain't with me I'm nobody but I'm trying to tell the people of God you can't give up on your day you can't look back and see what God did yesterday and you need him today you need God today I need God today and he's the god of yesterday today and forever this ain't no one-man show it ain't all about me I ain't got nobody I'm just it's you know it's just what I'm pleading to you I'm so this is simple I'm a warrior my whole duty is to fight against spirits you understand me and so we are the place at a read to you already I'd rather have Jesus you can't produce each Eagles in a dead atmosphere you can no eggs are hatched if placed in a refrigerator it's gotta be some heat and that's how the church got it you got to be hot you gotta be on fire you can't allow starchiness and religion to hold you in your seat that's of the devil that's not of God and you and I must understand as it is in heaven so shall it be earth whatever they doing up dead that's just what I want to do if they dance and if they're shouting that praising God I want to do the same thing here because I'm there and so are you is that right don't get scared my pony we're separate sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus don't you understand as Christians if you're a real Christian you can't lose you can't die you just can't you know we all get to a place sometimes and then we get a little starchy but you gotta fight it y'all making too much noise I wish I had that complaint hallelujah like I said I used to be part of the Catholic Church I've never didn't join it but I go to some I go to some places and the Catholic Church got more movement than us the Catholic churches they say you know needs Dan Neil huh they waving their hands and right you know we just come saying don't criticize them they got more motion and some of y'all huh and you gotta realize they meant that we come in listen I love Israel I can't hardly wait Amen to this thing is over and I see them marching in the gate come on somebody with that unit that Jewish music I love that stuff you know I look at and you see people say you know what brother would you you know you're to Pillar costs are you just to something I'm like you don't understand my grandpa was Pentecostal which one the one way down I got no power y'all know Peter and James and all him did y'all hear what happened to me on the day of Pentecost did you hear about how they jumped out the window then ran down the street crying he's alive he's alive T y'all got to read some history some some some good background on what happened in the beginning those people don't staunch Jews all of a sudden got quickened by the Holy Ghost and they ran down the street screaming he's alive how do you think three thousand came together and they didn't have one of these microphones y'all better move why you know after a while you get like me you gotta move carefully you love the Lord I love the people of God there's not a soul I hate or dislike because my enemy is not people it's spirits and you know we've got spirits even around this message that I have to fight against hello and because it's around this message don't mean it's right we worship one Lord one Savior and that's Jesus Christ himself no other God before me not me not my wife not my children ain't nobody comes before the Lord Jesus Christ and if you can't see that you are possessed and need deliverance am I right or wrong the Bible said that there was one that stood on the right hand of God I'm happy in Jesus see when you get the real Holy Ghost it would testify who as we said the confident the father was sent in my name and he would testify who me he said not me Jesus crying I don't know what TD jakes and all the rest on saying there's only one one way to get to heaven there was only one door to get in no Assad hallelujah and Jesus was that door and he told the Pharisees of this day he said except a man believe that I am he I don't care how many degrees he's got he's lost that's your Bible and Jesus Christ is not long no oh come on something I got a quote where he's the Prophet God said Amen the prophets they move by inspiration not not intellectual knowledge knowledge is not what moves people it ain't your knowledge the devil know more about it than you right but when you are inspired yo your movement I'm almost done your movement may look contrary to everybody else but you right right oh yeah you don't you said all Brotherhood's what he said look at Noah he didn't make sense but he was right look at Moses they say wait a minute we've got our organization our denomination I want you understand we had we had Abraham as I father and no Moses wouldn't say yeah that's true but I heard from God he told me if you don't put the blood on the doorpost in the little your firstborn going down I don't care oh but wait a minute Moses we're circumcised we've been circumcised on the eighth day we're Jews mostly I don't care if you argues you could have been thoroughbred all the way through but I heard from God and the death angels coming and if you don't put blood on the doorpost and a little you gonna die everybody that did not obey Moses from the Egyptians to the Israelites they died if they were any Israelites I believe they heard Moses but the point is I'm saying that's what inspiration will bring things that seem so contrary you know God I know I took a lot of your time left and we just got one service today all right so I took my liberty this is just the beginning of what I'm trying to teach by God's grace I'll try to slow down and give more more scriptures and things I want you to understand by God's grace I've been kissed by God he said Wow before I knew him and the Lord brought that revelation now I don't you don't have to believe me go all out mystery say you know that preaching crazy but I was in junior high school and I'm gonna tell you how it happened I don't throw this thing and I'm letting you go first time I ever had a dream about Jesus Christ and I want you to know before there was times in my life I never thought about God of Jesus at all but I had a dream and in this dream I wasn't even a preacher I wasn't even a Christian as far as I was kind of nicer now when I was in the Baptist Church I gave my heart to the Lord at 12 years old and I knew something change but I didn't have a word to keep me but when I was in the in the sixth grade seventh seventh grade it was I had a dream and in this dream Jesus stood there and I was the gates were open and I'm telling you it's the most prettiest that's all the gold and the blues and what we call colors this is faded and it you'd be surprised you're gonna be surprised if this dream be true you will be surprised on what real colors look like this is like the faded part of all things it was so beautiful and everybody was showering and jumping in praising God I had no idea I was going to do the traveling I traveled all over the world and I'm telling you in this group of people was almost every nationality coming through that gate and I stood there and Jesus stood there and the whole time he'd never watched those people he watched me and as he watched me I was afraid terrified but I was already in the gate because once I got in something pulled me to the side and I stood there I'm not trying to be nothing people I'm just saying personally I I am and I'm not trying to be some great leaders those days are over this is a mini moment body of Christ there are no great ones among us I'm your pastor only by position I'm just your brother in Christ and as I walked as I stood there they listened I didn't know what a mean long that's why I play this because there's a I was playing the tambourine coming in the gate the only difference is I had tassels had different colored tassels on it and that those tassels hung like that and I was playing it I remem that and I didn't know I was at the Harmon it doesn't they said when I played this light striking and gives a rainbow color don't know but the whole point is that's why I play this I've had men all over the message trying to take me my tambourine God gave me this and if it was with me in heaven it's gonna be there with me in heaven that's all I can tell you you might not like the way I play it but he does and and and I was terrified then all of a sudden I saw the gate closed that's why I know I'm one of them I saw the gate closed I saw when the last came in I saw that and I was terrified this is a dream people but I believe the dream I'm telling you as a dream I'm not saying this is the stay at the Lord I'm just telling you what I believe okay so as I stood there I was really scared and not realizing because I didn't know nothing about holiness or anything about this nothing like what we're doing but anyway the next thing I know after everybody had passed I went to do this because I was terrified on my left foot to this day I know what that means yeah something I don't know but anyway the next thing I know I was right in front of him that's how I know the Hoffman here was the closest thing to him his looks and he lifted me like this and he kissed me on my lips and I woke up screaming and Holle with that anointing y'all know what I'm saying with that anointing all over me I jumped out of my bed I ran into my mother's room bust in there scared half to death almost screaming in Harlan and I said mama I just had a dream about Jesus and I began to tell her and she said praise the Lord God don't call my son to preach that was the worst thing she could have said to me I walked out our room and I said I ain't going back to church ever again cuz I ain't gonna be nobody's preacher well my mama died and that was to think that was the first time I went back to church well something no I gotta correct that it wasn't but it was the first time I went back to church which when it meant something got quickened something to me there it was only until I came to where I am because I got tired of all of the denominations and organizations now I can remember crying out to the Lord where are you because after a while you learn everything they learn and then you start drying up say where are you and he says I'm in my by my mama I'm here I didn't know nothing about the message at that time but when I I was in my mind was settled to leave out from where I work that's when it came to me and I say this people of God by God's grace I know that what I it's truth and I say that not in Pride but I say that because I'm resounding that which has already been sounded when God gave us Malachi 4 that's all I have he left a word I revelation not by letter because I'm not a parakeet and I think a lot of times people want me to be parakeet but I'm not going to be that I'm not quoting anything that I don't have a revelation of it keeps me safe you love the Lord so man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God man does not live by your tradition yo isms and your schisms man lives by every word that proceedeth amount of God and I'm gonna tell you something once God fill you with the Holy Ghost and seal you nothing can stop you from making heaven well I want to make mistakes yeah you'll make mistakes but nothing can stop you from heaven let's pray father God we come before you we thank you for your grace I don't know father while I had to stand there they give my defense but you allowed me to beast do so Lord I am Who I am and I must preach the way you ordain me
