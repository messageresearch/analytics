[20:08] certainly wanted to again express our
[20:12] gratitude for being here this weekend in
[20:15] fellowship with you all
[20:18] certainly hearts have been blessed and
[20:22] just been in fellowship brother Brooks
[20:26] has been inviting for a number of years
[20:29] and I'm just so happy that the Lord made
[20:31] a way for us to be able to come a man
[20:34] during this time and this morning we had
[20:38] a wonderful time there and I was sitting
[20:40] and you know and just just being there
[20:43] with the Saints and I got a chance to I
[20:46] think appreciate for the Brooks a little
[20:48] bit more for the great sacrifice that he
[20:52] makes to kind of take care of both
[20:54] churches and and I thank God for a
[20:57] servant of God a man that I'd be willing
[20:59] to sacrifice himself so much for that
[21:03] the people a man so Iowa you are blessed
[21:07] a man you are blessed and a man thank
[21:10] God for a servant like that but this we
[21:13] want to this evening just kind of go
[21:16] right into our thought I want to read
[21:19] from two passes of passages of Scripture
[21:23] and certainly good to see these precious
[21:26] brothers here I knew that they were in
[21:28] service last night went back home and
[21:31] and then can't you know brother Isaac
[21:35] make sure that we got there to church
[21:37] okay this morning but Isaac what I was
[21:39] showing you there I took the microphone
[21:41] from the church this morning so I left
[21:44] it back to her brother Brooks and he's
[21:46] gonna give it to you right now so you
[21:50] all you all forgive me I don't want to
[21:52] take that part of Iowa City back home
[21:54] with me you know but but God
[21:58] so but I want to just use two scriptures
[22:04] we should be familiar with these one is
[22:07] out a second Peter one you saw see the
[22:09] statue of a perfect man there on the
[22:11] wall and and we've been going through a
[22:13] series back at home a man using that and
[22:16] and and I can't preach the whole series
[22:20] and and one service a man but I didn't
[22:24] want to just bring wanted a thank you so
[22:26] much my brother just bring one thoughts
[22:28] that we've been sharing back at home we
[22:32] have been taking the virtues because we
[22:37] notice is something that applies to all
[22:39] of us as as as believers God has called
[22:43] us all to this this is not just a sign
[22:45] we put in a church right but this is a
[22:48] this is where God is trying to elevate
[22:50] us and bring us to as as Christians this
[22:53] is what Christianity is all about we
[22:56] didn't even know that when we were in
[22:58] our denominational churches it took a
[23:00] prophet to come and bring a sermon like
[23:03] statue of a perfect man so that we could
[23:05] understand what God was really calling
[23:07] us to and what he's expecting out of us
[23:10] so I've been taking that and using it as
[23:12] a foundation a man and we're using that
[23:16] foundation but then going back in the
[23:18] Old Testament and showing where one of
[23:21] those virtues were was manifested during
[23:24] a war right so this is uh this is title
[23:29] war strategies patience with God that's
[23:34] that's what our title is to tonight war
[23:37] strategies patience with God let's read
[23:40] here
[23:40] a man from Ephesians I'm sorry our
[23:43] second Peter chapter one a man second
[23:48] Peter chapter one and just verse three
[23:52] through ten will read that and then
[23:54] we'll take a scripture from the Old
[23:56] Testament as well here in 2nd Peter
[23:59] chapter 1 verse 3 it says actually let
[24:04] me skip down a little bit alright I'm in
[24:08] the role
[24:09] chapter ii feet of one i'm in first
[24:12] peter okay alright verse three according
[24:14] as his divine power hath given us given
[24:17] unto us all things that pertain unto
[24:18] life and godliness through the knowledge
[24:20] of him that have called us to glory and
[24:24] virtue whereby are given unto us
[24:27] exceeding great and precious promises
[24:29] that by these you might be partakers of
[24:31] the divine nature having escaped the
[24:34] corruption that is in the world through
[24:36] lust and besides this giving all
[24:41] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[24:43] to virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[24:46] temperance to temperance patience and to
[24:49] patience godliness and you know I love
[24:52] one of the statements that the Prophet
[24:53] made in the statute of perfect man he
[24:55] says when you're truly born again he
[24:57] says these things will automatically add
[24:59] to you when you're truly born again now
[25:02] amen don't gonna skip that part
[25:04] amen but when there's a true birth that
[25:06] has taken place then these things will
[25:08] automatically add to you this is what we
[25:11] should see in the in life of a believer
[25:13] right verse 6 says and to knowledge
[25:15] temperance and to temperance patience to
[25:17] patience godliness and to godliness
[25:19] brotherly kindness and to brotherly
[25:20] kindness charity for if these things be
[25:24] in you and abound they make you that you
[25:27] neither that you should neither be
[25:29] barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[25:30] of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that
[25:33] lacketh these things is blind and cannot
[25:37] see afar off and have forgotten that he
[25:39] was purged from his old sins verse 10
[25:42] says wherefore the rather brethren give
[25:43] diligence to make your call him and
[25:45] election sure for if you do these things
[25:48] ye shall never fall now let's go back
[25:50] and look at a man a passage over in
[25:53] Joshua chapter 5 and man Joshua chapter
[25:56] 5 praise the Lord
[25:59] a man just a couple verses here in
[26:02] Joshua chapter 5 verse 13 through 15 I
[26:07] believe is where I want to read amen in
[26:10] Joshua chapter 5 since this it came to
[26:13] pass when Joshua was by Jericho
[26:16] that he lifted up his eyes and looked
[26:19] and behold there stood a man over
[26:22] against him
[26:23] the sword drawn in his hand and Joshua
[26:26] went unto him and said unto Him art thou
[26:28] Forest or for our adversaries and it's
[26:32] that nay but ask captain of the host of
[26:35] the Lord am I now coming Joshua fell on
[26:38] his face to the earth and did worship
[26:40] and said unto Him what saith my lord
[26:44] unto his servant a man and the captain
[26:48] of the Lord's host said unto Joshua
[26:50] loose tashu from off thy foot for the
[26:53] place whereon thou standest is holy and
[26:56] Joshua did so amen let's pray over the
[26:59] word that we have read dear God we thank
[27:02] you for the privilege and the
[27:04] opportunity to stand before this portion
[27:08] of the elect a man the elect lady the
[27:11] bride of Jesus Christ a father as you've
[27:14] given us this opportunity we don't take
[27:16] it lightly we prayed it's something to
[27:18] be said to strengthen Lord that the
[27:21] church here that'll be something that
[27:23] has strengthened the people that will
[27:24] help them in their journey Oh God and
[27:26] just pray O God that it won't just be
[27:28] words that go in when they're not the
[27:30] end of us something that we can apply to
[27:31] our lives that would make us better
[27:33] Christians that would cause us to love
[27:35] you more and to want to serve you got
[27:37] with everything we have we just act so
[27:39] God that you would be a part of this
[27:41] service we take every spirit that's
[27:42] against the Spirit of God
[27:43] underneath control of the Holy Spirit
[27:45] even right now and we pray to to have
[27:48] your way in this portion of the service
[27:49] god it's in Jesus name we pray amen and
[27:53] amen god bless you can be seated
[27:55] praise the Lord again we want to take
[27:58] for our title war strategies patience
[28:02] with God amen and when you go back and
[28:04] you listen to the sermon a statue of a
[28:07] perfect man when brother Branham got to
[28:09] the virtue of patience he brought out
[28:12] two things about that particular virtue
[28:14] says we got to learn to have patience
[28:17] with God and then he said the second
[28:19] thing we got to learn to have patience
[28:21] with one another hallelujah amen so I I
[28:25] just felt led with him there at the
[28:28] church just to kind of separate that
[28:29] into two different sermons and and we
[28:31] preach patience with one another and
[28:33] then patience with God amen and we even
[28:36] show
[28:37] in scripture there was a strategy a
[28:39] man-of-war that was needed and went
[28:43] where where Abraham demonstrated that
[28:49] when he went after lop he was having
[28:51] patients with lots a man lot what's
[28:53] constantly getting himself in trouble
[28:55] but Abraham would took disturbance out
[28:58] of his own house and went and got a lot
[29:00] out of trouble it was a war strategy
[29:02] that that Abraham had in order to rescue
[29:05] lot from the things that he was in and
[29:07] you know we looked at this a mint from a
[29:09] number of different places and you know
[29:12] I when we started with faith I used the
[29:15] character Gideon amen
[29:17] Gideon it took faith for Gideon to
[29:19] overcome and the day in which he lived a
[29:22] man Gideon took 300 men to battle
[29:27] now now now understand it that had it
[29:29] had been one of us we probably would
[29:32] have questioned God and said no I can't
[29:34] go out to battle when Gideon first
[29:37] started out that when took to this
[29:39] battle he had 32,000 warriors and I want
[29:43] you understand with 32,000 warriors he
[29:47] was going up against a hundred and
[29:49] thirty five thousand million Knights
[29:51] amen and when I looked at that the odds
[29:53] with 32,000 warriors
[29:56] the odds were Gideon before amen four
[29:59] million nights to one Israelite what a
[30:02] what would the odds were actually
[30:04] against him with four to one and God
[30:07] says it tells Gideon please make an
[30:10] announcement in the army whoever has
[30:13] fear tell them to turn around and leave
[30:14] right now
[30:15] oh my twenty two thousand men took off
[30:19] in it in one announcement Lord Jesus
[30:23] twenty-two thousand men going after one
[30:25] announcement and and I can just imagine
[30:27] some of the guys said I've been waiting
[30:29] to get out of this and I don't know how
[30:31] to get out of this but I'm taking my
[30:33] chance to go home right now
[30:35] twenty-two thousand goals just like that
[30:37] the odds were four to one now the eyes
[30:40] became thirteen point five to one and
[30:45] you know when they get down to ten
[30:46] thousand men God challenges
[30:49] Gideon once more
[30:51] and God says now even even though the
[30:54] odds I get you if you all won the battle
[30:57] we have 10,000 meeting you would think
[30:59] you did it in your own strength
[31:00] they say summer I'm going to bring the
[31:03] odds down a little bit more say click
[31:05] the men go to the water and and I want
[31:07] you to separate them based on how they
[31:08] they lap like dogs and and how they
[31:11] drink the water you say now some you
[31:13] know got it got prostate I'm prostrate
[31:15] on their own they facing and brother
[31:17] branham say they were idol worshipers a
[31:19] man they weren't even thinking about the
[31:21] enemy and nothing but the others just
[31:23] kind of leaned down and and cut the
[31:24] water and brought it to the mouth but
[31:26] they were looking in every direction
[31:27] because that's the way a dog would drink
[31:30] he would leak but he looked up in every
[31:31] direction making sure that he safe he
[31:34] said now put the ones that lap like dogs
[31:36] in one side and put the others on the
[31:38] other side God got down to 300 million
[31:41] that were laughing like dogs say now
[31:42] this is the army this the army I want
[31:45] you to go forward with get him probably
[31:47] looked and say how 32,000 the odds were
[31:52] stacked against me now then I got to
[31:54] 10,000 the odds were stacked against me
[31:57] now down to 300 you know the odds are
[31:59] now 450 million Knights
[32:02] 2-1 Israelites Oh hallelujah amen for me
[32:08] I get excited when the odds are stacked
[32:11] against me because greater is He that is
[32:14] in me than he that's in the world and
[32:17] also the Bible says one will chase a
[32:19] thousand and two will put ten thousand
[32:23] to a flight so there's nothing to fear
[32:25] when the odds are against you walk out
[32:28] by faith and know that God somehow is
[32:31] gonna make a way Gideon overcame in that
[32:35] battle with 300 men and and and and the
[32:38] other thing that God used this allowed
[32:39] him to go down into the the enemy's camp
[32:44] and hear a dream that they were
[32:47] interpreting amongst themselves and when
[32:51] he heard about the dream and how the man
[32:52] say there's nothing but the sword of
[32:54] Gideon coming in here and destroying us
[32:56] when he when he heard that that when he
[32:58] realized that the enemy was more afraid
[33:01] of him than he was of the enemy
[33:04] it changed everything and I think it's
[33:08] time for us as believers to recognize
[33:11] that the enemy is more afraid of us than
[33:14] we are of the enemy cancer is more
[33:18] afraid of you than you are cancer
[33:20] diabetes is more afraid of you than you
[33:23] are of diabetes whatever the devil might
[33:27] be trying to attack you with he is more
[33:29] afraid of you than you are of him we
[33:32] have nothing to fear come on church
[33:35] praise the name of the Lord but we you
[33:39] know that was a strategy when we talked
[33:41] about faith amen the war strategies
[33:44] faith we use Gideon as our example but I
[33:48] want to a man just take us on a journey
[33:50] tonight war strategies patience with God
[33:54] again the prophets say we got to learn
[33:56] to have patience with God and we also
[33:58] have to learn to have patience one with
[34:00] another glory to God now let me just
[34:03] read a few quotes for you just to get us
[34:05] set up here a man and then we will we
[34:07] will go as the Lord will lead us and
[34:09] stature of a perfect man the Prophet
[34:12] says patience with what it says
[34:16] what kind of patience says first thing
[34:19] is have patience with God if you got
[34:22] real genuine faith he says you have real
[34:27] genuine patience because faith worketh
[34:32] patience glory when God says anything
[34:36] you believe it that's all you got
[34:40] patience and might you might have to
[34:42] wait on it but when God says anything
[34:45] you believe it
[34:46] you got patience he said well I asked
[34:50] him last night to heal me and I'm just
[34:52] as sick this morning he says oh my what
[34:56] patience Laurie says God told Abraham
[35:00] and 25 years later there wasn't even one
[35:04] side he was still believing he was
[35:08] patient with God uh-huh put him always
[35:11] before you let him be the next crossing
[35:13] thing you can't cross him so just keep
[35:17] him before you he said
[35:18] so he said so it's going to happen to
[35:23] keep him before you that's right I like
[35:26] that
[35:26] you know Erie makes the statement about
[35:29] Abraham God to Abraham and 25 years
[35:31] later there wasn't even once time he was
[35:33] still believing he was patient with God
[35:35] now we are we all know the story of
[35:38] Abraham we know how he waited for 25
[35:41] years for a promised son
[35:43] let me just inject a little something
[35:46] here glory to God this was a different
[35:48] sermon but I'll just I'll put it in here
[35:50] you know it was so perfect what God did
[35:55] with Abraham when he gave him Isaac it
[36:00] was it was so perfect that after he gave
[36:02] I gave him Isaac there was a time in
[36:05] Abraham's life Genesis 24 where he tells
[36:07] Abraham
[36:08] now take your only son and bring him up
[36:13] a man to the mountain that I will show
[36:16] you and it was a three-day journey to
[36:19] get to this mountain a man say and now
[36:21] I'm going to show you the mountain and
[36:23] and and just recently I had the
[36:25] opportunity to go to Israel and while I
[36:28] was there in Israel we're coming into
[36:30] Jerusalem and and a tour guide that was
[36:33] with us he just made an announcement on
[36:35] the on the bus he said this it's not
[36:37] Moriah and I said I said sir do you you
[36:43] realize what you're saying he says yes
[36:45] this is Mount Moriah and I served you
[36:48] realize Abraham brought Isaac to Mariah
[36:52] Mount Moriah he said yes I know that
[36:54] said this is not right I said well how
[36:57] far is Calvary from here he said oh it's
[37:00] just on the other side I'm like well I I
[37:02] had never been to Israel before so I
[37:04] don't know what just on the other side
[37:05] meant praise the Lord
[37:08] so I just began to do some Google search
[37:11] amen and I start putting in some things
[37:13] about how far as Mount Moriah from this
[37:16] and how far is caliper from that and and
[37:19] when I when I when I when I came back
[37:22] with the search results it was telling
[37:24] me that that Calvary was a four minute
[37:26] walk from where Mariah was so you know
[37:30] what that told me the same
[37:32] mounted and brother branham told us
[37:33] these things the same mountain that God
[37:37] told Abraham to bring Isaac is the same
[37:41] mountain that Christ was offered on
[37:43] himself so when you go back and look at
[37:46] Genesis 24 and the Bible says the Lord
[37:48] shall provide himself a sacrifice not
[37:52] not the law provide for himself the law
[37:55] will provide him himself
[37:58] it meant exactly what it said the same
[38:03] mountain that Abraham offered Isaac on
[38:07] is the same mountain Christ himself died
[38:10] on I don't want to go down that path but
[38:14] it's some other things that happened on
[38:16] that in that same spot but my Abraham
[38:18] had Abraham had faith a man he had
[38:22] patience to wait on God no sign of
[38:25] anything for 25 years but yet he kept
[38:29] confessing what is faithful I want to
[38:32] tell you have to do the exact same thing
[38:33] you might be waiting waiting waiting
[38:35] done the wind gonna come through but you
[38:38] just keep keep patiently waiting on God
[38:40] he will come through hallelujah oh I
[38:44] believe that church I believe that I
[38:47] believe that we're the seed of Abraham
[38:49] we should have the same faith that
[38:50] Abraham had it should be manifested in
[38:53] our lives
[38:54] brother Branham used seven different
[38:57] people when he talked about patience
[39:00] with God the first one that he used was
[39:02] Abraham the second that he used was Noah
[39:05] the third he used was Moses and then he
[39:09] used the Hebrew boys that there were
[39:11] number four the fifth person he used was
[39:13] Daniel Amen the sixth person when he
[39:16] talked about having patience with God
[39:18] was Paul hallelujah and then the seventh
[39:21] was a group of people he called them the
[39:23] believers on the day of Pentecost how
[39:25] they waited patiently for God to
[39:27] manifest his word now I just want to
[39:30] read Amen a little bit about Noah
[39:32] because I thought this was very very
[39:34] good a man ever says Noah had patience
[39:38] yeah Noah had real godly patience God
[39:45] I'm going to destroy this world with
[39:47] rain and going back to the conversation
[39:50] that we had on the other day amen I'm
[39:53] gonna destroy that they're taking the
[39:55] rainbow from us a man but the rainbow
[39:58] was a promise of God hallelujah right
[40:02] they say you had known or had a real
[40:04] godly patience said God said I'm going
[40:06] to destroy this world with rain and Noah
[40:08] preached a hundred and twenty years yet
[40:10] plenty of patience not even do for Evan
[40:15] wasn't nothing just as dusty as it ever
[40:18] was
[40:18] four hundred and twenty years but he was
[40:21] patient and I want you to just imagine
[40:22] going to North's church I want you to
[40:25] imagine being a member in North Church
[40:28] and if you remember North's Church and
[40:31] Noah comes to the pulpit and he says I
[40:33] got a sermon from the Lord and he says I
[40:36] want to preach it I'm I'm inspired to
[40:38] say this I want to tell everybody it's
[40:41] gonna rain and he begins to preach it's
[40:44] gonna rain they say we never heard
[40:46] nothing like that at first when they
[40:48] first heard it it was new revelation but
[40:52] for 120 years Noah was stuck in a series
[40:57] his series was its color rain for a
[41:01] hundred and twenty years and I can
[41:03] imagine maybe in a hundred and
[41:05] nineteenth year maybe somebody say I'm
[41:07] just tired of going to church every time
[41:09] I go past the nor preach the same sermon
[41:12] I can tell you the quotes he gonna read
[41:15] I can tell you the scriptures I can tell
[41:17] you everything nor just say it's going
[41:19] to rain and maybe maybe the word get
[41:21] back to no say the people thing about
[41:23] leaving the church amen because I'll you
[41:25] preach to the same thing you've been
[41:26] preaching for a hundred and eighteen
[41:28] years we talk we need something fresh
[41:30] you say okay I got I got something fresh
[41:33] come to church on Sunday got something
[41:36] fresh and Noah steps up to the pulpit
[41:38] opens up his text and it says get in the
[41:43] boat not asked a little different from
[41:47] it's gonna rain get in the boat why
[41:49] because it's gonna rain and imagine some
[41:55] of the people that decided to leave
[41:57] North Church
[41:58] just before the rain did I just think
[42:03] about people that was going all that
[42:04] time and they left Church just before
[42:08] the rain I want to encourage you stay
[42:11] with this be patient with God it's going
[42:15] to be a rapture and the only way you're
[42:18] gonna be prepared for this rapture is by
[42:21] what you feed on through the books and
[42:24] the tapes hallelujah glory to God this
[42:28] message has wrapped in faith all inside
[42:30] of it and this is what's changing your
[42:33] body glory to God
[42:35] the word is changing your body you might
[42:37] say how can the word change my body do
[42:40] you realize it was the word the word
[42:42] that changed the conditions of the world
[42:44] all God used to change the condition
[42:47] world was let there be in that change
[42:50] that that had caused the light to come
[42:52] into the world it let there be could
[42:54] change the conditions of the world they
[42:57] let there be can change the conditions
[42:59] of my body praise God the power of the
[43:04] word of God is transforming power inside
[43:07] of it
[43:07] nor was patient know especially now I
[43:11] want you to notice a statement that
[43:13] brother Branham makes here about North
[43:14] it says then God tries your patience he
[43:20] said that's right God tries them think
[43:25] about that not not the devil trying it
[43:28] God trying it oh listen to this
[43:34] statement says God tries your patience
[43:36] that's right God tries them he says
[43:37] after he told Noah and I said no I want
[43:41] you to go ahead get in the art and I'm
[43:44] gonna run the animals in there I want
[43:46] you to get in now if you happen to be a
[43:48] no neighbor in Noah's day if you
[43:51] would've saw animals passing through
[43:52] your backyard wouldn't you know if
[43:55] something was going on if they're going
[43:58] to get into art maybe I should go get in
[44:00] the Ark right but here here you know he
[44:03] say say say he said I want you to get in
[44:05] climb way upstairs now so you can see a
[44:08] look out top window now I want you to
[44:10] get that and I want you to tell
[44:12] these people tomorrow what I've been
[44:15] preaching for a hundred and twenty years
[44:17] is going to take place now that's God
[44:20] try this pricks it's because God tell
[44:22] them tomorrow what I've been three peaks
[44:24] reaching for a hundred twenty years it's
[44:26] going to take place it says all right
[44:27] you go down there and tell them now how
[44:30] does now brother branham breaks in a
[44:32] little bit more here it says no awaited
[44:34] the fourth day pass no rain
[44:38] there's it's all right it's gonna happen
[44:41] he say now this is the way he tries his
[44:43] patience look at what he says says I can
[44:46] hear now I'm gonna be honest I'm gonna
[44:49] be honest with you if the Prophet tells
[44:52] me that he can hear I actually believe
[44:56] he was hearing it I actually believe he
[44:59] was here in the conversation and brother
[45:01] Branham can tell us what Eve look like
[45:04] right my vision he could tell us what
[45:07] Eve looked like that should not be
[45:08] shocking to you
[45:10] how could Moses write the first five
[45:12] books of the Bible and he was not even
[45:14] there how could Moses write about the
[45:17] Garden of Eden and not even be there
[45:19] because God allowed him to go back with
[45:22] prophetic vision and if our prophet
[45:25] today could go back with prophetic
[45:27] vision I believe he's telling us exactly
[45:30] what he sees exactly what he hears you
[45:36] say God will try your patience the
[45:38] highly tried he says I can hear miss
[45:42] Noah his trout came through his wife his
[45:48] trial came through his wife listen every
[45:58] time I preached this to get quiet right
[46:00] when I say that I don't know what it's
[46:03] just like a holy hush but I just want to
[46:09] speak truth to you tonight listen the
[46:11] Prophet said it says I can hear miss
[46:14] Noah come around and say dad are you Shh
[46:23] before brother branham to give the word
[46:24] sure out you say don't talk like that
[46:31] sometime don't have to be a man the
[46:34] physical wife that could bring the trial
[46:38] but in a church it could be the
[46:40] spiritual wife if the pastor has a
[46:42] spiritual wife that's the church and
[46:44] sometimes the church might talk certain
[46:46] things past are you brother branham say
[46:51] don't talk like that
[46:53] he said don't talk like that you said he
[46:56] had patience what brother man says don't
[46:58] don't question God even though even
[47:00] though
[47:01] Moses I mean Noah said it's gonna rain
[47:04] tomorrow and it hadn't rained yet I'm
[47:06] still sure God spoke to me and I'm gonna
[47:09] have patience we got and it's during
[47:11] those moments that God is actually
[47:13] trying Noah's faces I want y'all to get
[47:16] this let me just keep reading it says he
[47:20] had patience does he had faith yes sir
[47:22] he had virtue he had knowledge that God
[47:25] was right he had temperance he didn't
[47:27] fly loose and say well I don't know what
[47:30] it's all about
[47:31] I've lost all my popularity out there no
[47:34] no people don't care for me no more I
[47:36] don't go out there and start all over
[47:37] again no again no no no he had patience
[47:40] God promised God will do it God will do
[47:44] it because God said so another trial of
[47:49] his patience when God was trying
[47:50] spacious after mama stop talking then
[47:53] the kids came in and if dad are you sure
[47:57] dad are you sure God led you dad you
[48:00] should he say say look look all I know
[48:02] is God told me to get in the art and
[48:04] then he told me to preach this sermon
[48:05] that is gonna rain two more but daddy
[48:07] it's not raining are you sure now here's
[48:10] the thing that I was I was really
[48:11] awestruck about they are inside the Ark
[48:16] Noah's wife Noah's sons their door I
[48:21] mean they're wise all of them are in the
[48:23] ark with the ark door closed and now
[48:26] they're having this conversation with
[48:28] Noah my question is if you got sealed in
[48:31] how you gonna get out
[48:34] so there's no need to doubt now we come
[48:38] too far to start doubting now we might
[48:43] as well go all the way somebody it's too
[48:47] late to doubt not if you're gonna doubt
[48:49] you should have doubted last week but
[48:51] now that we're here we might as well
[48:54] keep pressing the battle have patience
[48:58] with dogs no matter how long it takes
[49:02] you just wait on the Lord it'll prove
[49:05] himself and the Thunder begin to roar
[49:08] lightning begin to strike the rain
[49:11] begins to fall everything nor scent has
[49:16] finally come to pass and I want to tell
[49:18] you something everything that you've
[49:19] spoken over the years there comes a day
[49:21] where there must be a manifestation to
[49:24] the things that have been a revelation
[49:26] in your heart oh hold on to a church the
[49:31] prophets say Moses demonstrated patience
[49:33] and they said you know Moses when he
[49:36] went out there
[49:37] amen to Pharaoh and Moses was there I
[49:40] love this let me I'll just read
[49:42] something says why he said the Moses
[49:46] that went down and he met God on the
[49:49] backside of the desert and and I love
[49:51] that I love that it that testimony that
[49:53] Moses had of meeting God on the backside
[49:56] of the desert is a testimony that he
[49:58] shared with Joshua it's a testimony to
[50:01] share with Joshua stay with me here
[50:03] tonight a man because we read it in
[50:06] Joshua but seeing Moses day it was a
[50:08] pillar of fire inside of a burning bush
[50:11] but in Joshua's day the pillar fire had
[50:14] become a man and how did they know is
[50:17] the same experience because they did the
[50:18] same thing take off your shoes your own
[50:21] holy ground hallelujah
[50:23] so in Moses day as a pillar of fire in a
[50:26] burning bush speaking out to Moses but
[50:28] now in Joshua's day it's a man saying
[50:30] I'm the captain of the Lord's house
[50:32] take off your shoes your holy ground
[50:34] amen
[50:35] I believe that the experience to get
[50:37] greater and this generation we ought to
[50:40] expect everything God hat plus glory the
[50:44] car amen
[50:46] but here Moses a man is
[50:48] is there and i can i can see poses god
[50:51] tell them say now moses take your stick
[50:54] and throw it down on the ground take
[50:56] that rod and throw down the ground and
[50:57] here he throws it in the ground and and
[50:59] moat the Bible says that Moses was
[51:01] afraid so
[51:02] so when it turning just think I could
[51:04] see Moses running he's trying to get out
[51:06] of there I would probably be the same
[51:08] way I'm being honest with you I don't
[51:10] know I don't like playing with snakes
[51:11] right if God telling me to throw it down
[51:13] it turns just thing I'm getting out of
[51:14] here as fast as I can but God said and I
[51:16] pick it up Lord you said you just saw me
[51:21] run and now you want me to pick it up
[51:24] God wanted him to overcome those fears
[51:26] he says now pick it up Moses picks it up
[51:29] and then it becomes a stick again oh my
[51:31] what is this you saying I take your hand
[51:33] and put it inside your bosom put it puts
[51:36] it down there and he pulls it up it's
[51:38] leprous now I can imagine I'm just I'm
[51:40] just using my imagination if God would
[51:43] have told me to do something like that
[51:44] the first time in my head would have
[51:46] come out white like leprosy I would have
[51:48] been wondering what is in there and then
[51:53] God challenges him put your hands back
[51:56] down there Lord the last time I did that
[52:01] it came out looking like this and God
[52:03] never told him that he was gonna kill
[52:05] him when he put it back down he just
[52:07] told him put your hand back down there
[52:09] by faith he does it puts his hand back
[52:12] in there puts it out it's healed
[52:14] he's wondering what is this never seen
[52:17] power like this ready to go down into
[52:20] Egypt with these mighty manifestations
[52:22] gets to Egypt and and it's Pharaoh let
[52:26] my people go
[52:27] you ain't gonna let him go Pharaoh okay
[52:30] I got something for you takes his stick
[52:32] throws it down turns into a snake and
[52:35] Pharaoh says cheap magician trick my
[52:45] question is what were they practicing in
[52:48] Egypt if that was a cheap magician trick
[52:52] what were they practicing in here you
[52:56] know Moses throws it down and and Moses
[52:58] had to have patience because he didn't
[53:00] know what was gonna happen
[53:01] Pharaoh cost
[53:02] Jamison Jamison may throw down mystics
[53:04] they turn into snakes well Moses with
[53:07] his patience with God's watch his snake
[53:11] eat up the other snakes priests caught
[53:15] God will never be outdone by the devil
[53:20] if you learn to just wait on God he'll
[53:23] do something great brother branham makes
[53:27] a statement here that I want to just
[53:29] read to you it says why he said that
[53:31] cheap magician's trick come here a
[53:34] minute come here Janice and jam you and
[53:36] jam breeze throw throw your sticks down
[53:38] they throw it down and they turned into
[53:40] a serpent say it now you cheap thing
[53:42] come down here to me and Egyptian a
[53:44] pharaoh Egypt and you come down here
[53:45] with some of your cheap magician tricks
[53:47] on your hoax
[53:48] you know mind-reading you know what I
[53:50] mean I hope you read about it mental
[53:52] telepathy or something you see ya come
[53:55] down here and with some of that said
[53:57] well we can do the same thing you do
[53:59] what was Moses he didn't say
[54:00] old mr. Pharaoh I'm sorry sir I'll be
[54:03] your slave that's not what Moses said if
[54:05] brother Graham said no sir he stood
[54:07] still and that's what the church needs
[54:10] to learn how to do stand still and see
[54:13] the salvation of the Lord
[54:14] he stood still a man stay right there
[54:18] God said just no doubt in his heart hold
[54:21] your peace I'll show you something and I
[54:24] love this statement that he makes when
[54:25] you're done exactly what he said do and
[54:30] it seemed like it went wrong stand still
[54:34] and be patient when you're done exactly
[54:41] what God told you to do but it seemed
[54:44] like it went wrong stand still and be
[54:47] patient because the devil girls make you
[54:50] said now you know this what you just did
[54:51] that that that God ain't working with
[54:53] that stand still
[54:54] be patient I want to skip down brother
[54:58] branham use the Hebrew boys he used
[55:01] Daniel in the lion's den both of them
[55:03] had patience to wait on God but he made
[55:06] one statement about Paul only one and
[55:09] he's using them as a character that
[55:11] demonstrated patience and he said he
[55:13] said Paul had patient
[55:16] certainly did look what Paul had to do
[55:18] talk about patient that's all brother
[55:20] branham said in statute of perfect man
[55:22] about Paul but he never went into any
[55:24] detail of how Paul had patients so I
[55:27] said well how I know what brother
[55:29] branham's quote book was anybody else
[55:32] know where this quote book was it's
[55:34] right here in the Bible is real Brenda's
[55:36] quote book so I went to brother
[55:38] Brennan's quote book and I began to
[55:40] study about Paul's life and I realized
[55:43] why brother Branham brought Paul in and
[55:45] said that he had patients now let's read
[55:48] one scripture acts 23 and 11 amen x-23
[55:53] an eleven glory to God thank you Lord
[55:59] Jesus
[56:02] Paul had patients and I just went back
[56:06] to the scripture and you know if you get
[56:08] a chance and just go and read this
[56:10] there's there's so much happening here
[56:11] in acts 23 Paul is in a position where
[56:15] people are trying to kill him right now
[56:18] in this particular chapter there's the
[56:20] men that have kind of gathered and said
[56:22] you know we're vowing that we are gonna
[56:25] kill Paul and and just so happen that
[56:27] Paul's nephew heard about the plan and
[56:29] he went and told some people and they
[56:30] were able to get Paul rescued and and
[56:32] sent on down to a certain place and
[56:34] everything before the people got there
[56:36] to kill him
[56:36] so so but but but one thing that
[56:39] happened here a man and verse 11 let's
[56:43] let's go to verse 10 says and when there
[56:45] Rose a great dissension the chief
[56:46] captain fear lest Paul should have been
[56:48] pulled in and pieces of them commanded
[56:51] the soldiers to go down and to take him
[56:53] by force from among them and bring him
[56:56] into the castle and the night following
[56:59] the Lord stood by him and said be of
[57:04] good cheer now I just love the way the
[57:06] scripture reads this man is about to
[57:09] lose his life and the angel or say be of
[57:11] good cheer God's thoughts are higher
[57:14] than our thoughts God's ways are not
[57:17] like our ways be of good cheer Paul for
[57:20] as thou has testified of me in Jerusalem
[57:24] so must I bear witness also at Rome now
[57:28] this is what the agent
[57:30] you sterling you a witness here in
[57:32] Jerusalem now you're gonna have to go to
[57:33] Rome and be a witness for me now I like
[57:35] I said this morning God tells us the end
[57:38] result but he never tells us what we're
[57:41] gonna have to go through to get to the
[57:43] end result hallelujah amen joseph has
[57:48] the end result through a dream but he
[57:50] didn't know you had to go to prison a
[57:52] man I think in order to get there
[57:54] he didn't know you had to go to Pilate
[57:55] Potiphar's house in order to get to that
[57:57] spot all the things he was going to have
[58:00] to suffer before he got to the end
[58:02] result
[58:04] brother Brandon said power had patience
[58:06] now we picked this up in acts 23 but I
[58:09] want to just I'm gonna skip and just
[58:11] kind of share with you and actually for
[58:15] Paul was taken to Felix to be judged by
[58:19] some of the things that he believed and
[58:20] this man Felix could find nothing wrong
[58:23] with Paul but yet he prolonged Paul's
[58:26] Amen judgment for two years kept him
[58:29] bound for two years even though he
[58:31] wasn't guilty of anything that people
[58:32] were saying about him now he prolonged
[58:34] the judgment trying to get money from
[58:37] Paul so Paul can pray for his freedom
[58:39] this is all during the time that God
[58:43] tells Paul you're gonna bear witness of
[58:45] me in Rome well before he goes to Rome
[58:47] he goes to prison for two years
[58:48] underneath Felix's reign now Felix I was
[58:52] governor at that time being at Phoenix
[58:54] Act the Bible says that Felix lost his
[58:56] position and then there's another rule
[58:58] and it comes in his famous Festus he
[59:00] comes in in acts 25 Paul is still in
[59:03] prison waiting for this manifestation of
[59:06] Acts
[59:07] 2311 waiting to actually get to Rome
[59:10] he's stuck in Jerusalem but God said you
[59:13] gonna bear witness of me in Rome stay
[59:17] with me here Paul had patience look at
[59:20] this actually fiery stood before Festus
[59:22] who replaced Felix and appeal to stand
[59:25] before and he told Festus I want to I
[59:27] want to stand before Caesar now why's
[59:30] Paul city wants to go to season because
[59:32] Caesar is actually in glory listen he
[59:36] says says now now I just I just love
[59:39] this I love this while he's standing
[59:41] there amen and Felix does
[59:43] want to pass judgment beers has some
[59:45] guests king agrippa hallelujah a man
[59:49] comes along and Paul has to stand before
[59:51] Agrippa and he begins to share his
[59:53] testimony as to how he got to where he
[59:55] got and I I just love this statement
[59:59] Agrippa makes a statement to Paul after
[1:00:02] Paul begins to share his testimony and I
[1:00:05] want you to catch this part for me Paul
[1:00:07] did not share mysteries with Agrippa
[1:00:15] Paul did not share the deeper things of
[1:00:18] God with Agrippa Paul only shared his
[1:00:21] personal testimony with Agrippa and
[1:00:24] through Paul's personal testimony a grim
[1:00:28] percent down almost persuaded me to
[1:00:31] become a Christian hallelujah
[1:00:35] I think often times we spend so much
[1:00:37] time trying to get people to blunt it to
[1:00:38] blow their mind all we need to share is
[1:00:41] our personal testimonies how the message
[1:00:44] changed us how old in the world change
[1:00:47] you share that you almost persuade
[1:00:51] somebody to become a Christian stay with
[1:00:54] me here tonight
[1:00:55] here Paul is standing before Agrippa and
[1:00:58] they still could not make any type of a
[1:01:02] they couldn't make any judgment he says
[1:01:04] I want to go I want to go stand before
[1:01:06] Caesar and they finally put Paul on a
[1:01:09] boat and say okay we're gonna send you
[1:01:11] to Caesar had you not had you not wanted
[1:01:13] to go before Caesar I probably wouldn't
[1:01:14] let you go you said no but I got I got a
[1:01:16] promise hanging over me then I'm
[1:01:18] supposed to go to Rome now I want you to
[1:01:20] understand in acts 27 this was acts 23
[1:01:23] that he got the promise I'm in acts 27
[1:01:25] now acts 27 Paul was on this boat and
[1:01:31] the Bible says why he's on the boat they
[1:01:35] run into a major storm and the name of
[1:01:38] the storm the storm had a name like like
[1:01:40] in in Florida we get major storms they
[1:01:44] get we get we get spaghetti when they
[1:01:46] come these hurricanes come we give them
[1:01:48] names how they Lou you that way we can
[1:01:51] remember them a man some of the damage
[1:01:54] that they do we want to remember I mean
[1:01:55] it was never
[1:01:57] like Andrew and never storm like this
[1:01:59] and never storm like that I mean we
[1:02:01] remember the name so so so here in the
[1:02:03] Bible the barbary course a tempestuous
[1:02:06] wind caused it by the name of euro Clyde
[1:02:09] I Paul have patience with God because
[1:02:15] Paul is on a boat in the midst of a
[1:02:19] storm
[1:02:20] Paul had told the seller say now don't
[1:02:22] sail in these conditions because I fear
[1:02:24] we show me and may lose their life
[1:02:27] Paul so y'all should sell but they
[1:02:29] convinced let's go in and sell Paul had
[1:02:31] patience with God and while Paul was at
[1:02:34] sea with this man the age of the Lord
[1:02:36] showed up in the midst of this
[1:02:38] tempestuous wind and say Paul nobody
[1:02:41] gonna be lost as long as they stay on
[1:02:44] the boat oh I like that in Noah's day
[1:02:48] you had to get in the boat if you wanted
[1:02:51] to be spared and and since Paul what's
[1:02:55] on the boat if you were with Paul you
[1:02:58] would be spared again anybody that
[1:03:01] stayed in the boat I don't care how much
[1:03:03] you thought you should get out the boat
[1:03:05] you better stay in the boat if you want
[1:03:09] to be spared and there's people today
[1:03:12] thinking about getting out the boat stay
[1:03:15] in the boat I don't care what kind of
[1:03:18] storm come against the boat if you stay
[1:03:21] in the boat you will be spared
[1:03:24] I gave everybody to you Paul every one
[1:03:29] of these souls are given to you as long
[1:03:32] as they stay in the boat they had
[1:03:34] lifeboats and everybody are thinking
[1:03:35] about jumping to get on a lifeboat say
[1:03:37] no no no no cut the lifeboats because if
[1:03:39] you get off the boat you're gonna die
[1:03:42] you stay in the boat you'll live it they
[1:03:46] look like they can live in conditions
[1:03:47] like that not only that here they get to
[1:03:49] a spot where the boat runs them to land
[1:03:52] some sand and it gets it gets stuck and
[1:03:55] the back end of the boat is just being
[1:03:57] torn to pieces torn to pieces
[1:03:59] stay with me there's been torn to pieces
[1:04:02] and they say say now we might as well
[1:04:04] kill all these uh all these already all
[1:04:07] these people that we got captives we
[1:04:09] ought to just kill them all
[1:04:10] these prisons we oughta kill him they
[1:04:12] say because Paul was with them you saw
[1:04:16] in the scripture because Paul was with
[1:04:18] them this interior say gnarley' ain't
[1:04:20] gonna kill nobody because I don't want
[1:04:22] to kill Paul other people were spared
[1:04:25] because Paul was with them I told him in
[1:04:28] Iowa City this morning
[1:04:30] your job is blessed because you work
[1:04:33] there the reason that they're making
[1:04:39] money is because God wants to sustain
[1:04:41] you there are so many things that amen I
[1:04:46] mean because Paul was involved that's
[1:04:48] why God blessed it and because you are
[1:04:51] involved as the Bride of Christ that's
[1:04:52] why God blesses it all say look nobody
[1:04:58] gonna lose their life but I tell you
[1:05:01] what I love this it says those that can
[1:05:04] swim just swimming up to the shore but
[1:05:08] those that can't swim just grab ahold of
[1:05:11] a broken piece of wood that you see
[1:05:13] floating in the water and I want to tell
[1:05:16] you something tonight
[1:05:17] if you can't swim to get to shore just
[1:05:20] grab a piece of the of the floating wood
[1:05:22] you want to know why because you can
[1:05:23] make it on broken pieces you can make it
[1:05:31] on broken pieces maybe your marriage
[1:05:32] feel like it's falling apart you can
[1:05:34] make it on broken pieces huh maybe your
[1:05:38] life feel like it's about to fall apart
[1:05:40] you can make it on broken pieces no I
[1:05:45] mean here Paul
[1:05:46] patience with God floats up to the shore
[1:05:49] but Paul's not in Rome yet why he gets
[1:05:55] to shore just made it through a
[1:05:57] shipwreck I'm cold all I want to do now
[1:06:02] is just warm by fire everybody else
[1:06:05] warming themselves why can't I warm
[1:06:07] myself puts his hand out and a snake
[1:06:11] bites him and this type of snake when it
[1:06:14] when it bites everybody knew it was
[1:06:17] immediate death immediate so they just
[1:06:21] looked at oh he made it through the
[1:06:22] storm they begin to cast judgment he
[1:06:24] humming finally God got him right now
[1:06:26] he's gonna die
[1:06:27] this man gonna die they look to Seaton
[1:06:29] Paul did not die not only Paul not back
[1:06:32] Paul Jess as believers isn't it time for
[1:06:42] you to rise up and just shake some
[1:06:46] things off
[1:06:47] stop complaining about it stop worrying
[1:06:49] about it but just shake it off hey hey
[1:06:53] hey like we said last night his purpose
[1:06:57] was his protection and he had not made
[1:07:01] it to Rome yet so there was nothing that
[1:07:04] could stop all from going to Rome all he
[1:07:09] did was shake it off everybody expected
[1:07:14] him to die before you know it Paul had a
[1:07:15] prayer line on the island and everybody
[1:07:19] else was getting healed but you know
[1:07:21] what his ministry was not totally as
[1:07:23] ministry was not going to stop at that
[1:07:25] Island he was supposed to go to Rome
[1:07:28] another ship comes in to the island
[1:07:31] guess what they get on the board get on
[1:07:32] board and they make their way to Rome
[1:07:35] acts 28 but all the things Paul went
[1:07:38] through from acts 23 to acts 28 that's
[1:07:41] why the Prophet could say Paul had
[1:07:44] patience he said Paul had patient my god
[1:07:50] he said certainly did look what Paul had
[1:07:52] to do talk about patient and I and I
[1:07:56] just love it I go right back to that
[1:07:57] statement even in the midst of Euro
[1:07:59] Clyde on I want to say this you could be
[1:08:02] going through a storm right now in your
[1:08:03] life you could be in a euro Clyde on
[1:08:06] experience everything is ripped I mean
[1:08:08] just ripped apart from your family's
[1:08:09] ripped apart your health is ripped apart
[1:08:11] everything is ripped apart you could be
[1:08:13] in the midst of that and still in the
[1:08:15] perfect will of God
[1:08:22] job went through a euro client on
[1:08:24] experience when he lost everything and
[1:08:26] he was in the perfect will of God
[1:08:28] nothing was going wrong in Jill's life
[1:08:31] as they were accusing him you can be in
[1:08:34] the midst of a storm and still in the
[1:08:36] perfect will of God have patience with
[1:08:41] God glory to God the Bible says this in
[1:08:45] Hebrews 10 verse 35 to 38 and I'm gonna
[1:08:48] make our transition here says cast not
[1:08:53] away therefore your confidence which has
[1:08:56] great recompense of reward for ye have
[1:09:00] need of patience that after you have
[1:09:03] done the will of God you might receive
[1:09:05] the promise it's always after you've
[1:09:09] done after you've done right go over to
[1:09:11] God after you've done the will of God
[1:09:12] you might receive the promise for yet a
[1:09:15] little while and he that he that shall
[1:09:17] come will come and will not tarry not
[1:09:21] now the just shall live by faith but if
[1:09:24] any man draw back my soul should I have
[1:09:27] no pleasure in him glory to God look at
[1:09:33] this statement a little testimony I want
[1:09:34] to read for you brother Branham talks
[1:09:36] about this talking about a sister that
[1:09:40] came a man to the prayer line she was
[1:09:42] encouraged by her experience she says
[1:09:44] recently she had sent one of those
[1:09:47] handkerchiefs to her sister for her look
[1:09:49] baby a man that had a clubfoot and she
[1:09:53] told the lady said you tied the
[1:09:55] handkerchief on his foot and the Lord is
[1:09:58] going to heal it he says so she let the
[1:10:03] handkerchief own about two weeks and it
[1:10:06] got so dirty as you say you can wash it
[1:10:09] and then put it back on and she's so she
[1:10:12] said so she did and the handkerchief
[1:10:14] getting kind of old and worn she said
[1:10:16] well there's no difference in the babies
[1:10:18] flip set I guess I might as well take it
[1:10:21] off she said oh don't you do that so if
[1:10:24] it comes to pieces you tie it with
[1:10:26] strings then tie it back on there she
[1:10:28] said because I know that it will get
[1:10:30] well she's seen so many things done in
[1:10:33] the meanings
[1:10:35] and the woman did that she just had a
[1:10:37] few streams of that handkerchief tied on
[1:10:38] the baby's foot and one morning she went
[1:10:40] to get the baby and the Lord had been
[1:10:43] there that night oh I love statements
[1:10:47] like that one that you're gonna walk to
[1:10:50] your situation you're gonna realize God
[1:10:51] has passed through the situation God has
[1:10:54] turned the thing around the Lord had
[1:10:57] been there because only the Lord can
[1:10:59] actually turn it around for you but the
[1:11:01] Lord had been there reminds brother
[1:11:04] branham talk about how to angel pass
[1:11:05] through the neighborhood the Lord had
[1:11:07] been there
[1:11:08] you got a neighborhood to that angel
[1:11:10] wants to pass through your neighborhood
[1:11:12] the Lord had been there because on the
[1:11:16] stateís since I says you only even since
[1:11:22] I oh my did you just throw the
[1:11:26] handkerchief way say well well no no no
[1:11:28] I let me go back up the Lord had been
[1:11:30] there that night and the baby's foot was
[1:11:32] straight and she brought the baby to the
[1:11:34] meeting to show and brought the strings
[1:11:36] that was left on the handkerchief and
[1:11:38] the and and the baby's picture before
[1:11:40] and where it was then however little
[1:11:42] baby's foot was clubbed in like that a
[1:11:45] little baby about eight or ten months
[1:11:47] old and there was the little baby's foot
[1:11:50] just as Norma's any other baby praise
[1:11:55] the Lord Amen it says now if what if she
[1:11:58] just throw the handkerchief away and say
[1:12:00] well that's where we missed the
[1:12:02] blessings if she just throw it away say
[1:12:06] that's where we missed the blessings we
[1:12:08] are free to wait on God just a little
[1:12:11] bit so you see you heard that's the only
[1:12:15] way again I can hear that whisper only
[1:12:17] wait it won't be very long even now the
[1:12:20] father's hand is pleading soon with
[1:12:22] Jesus we were seeing the victory song
[1:12:24] that's right
[1:12:25] just wait on God believe it confess it
[1:12:28] stay with it and God will bring it to
[1:12:32] pass for you can I say that it again
[1:12:34] believe it
[1:12:36] confess it stay with it and God will
[1:12:40] bear to pass for you glory to God
[1:12:45] I absolutely
[1:12:48] we believe that I love a man this little
[1:12:55] thought that the Lord has given because
[1:12:58] we go back now to some Old Testament
[1:13:01] scripture brother Branham used these
[1:13:04] seven characters that I read off Retta
[1:13:06] floor earlier knowing Moses and and Paul
[1:13:09] and Hebrew boys and you know and Daniel
[1:13:13] just so many Abraham that the children
[1:13:16] are children on the day of Pentecost
[1:13:18] amen are believers on that there's so
[1:13:20] many that that he talked about have
[1:13:21] patience but this this theme that the
[1:13:23] Lord's give me in war strategies I'd
[1:13:25] like to go back and look at different
[1:13:28] wars that happen in the Old Testament
[1:13:30] and how one of these strategies where
[1:13:32] one of these virtues was manifested as a
[1:13:35] strategy hallelujah and we talked about
[1:13:38] a man Joshua glory to God
[1:13:43] I mentioned to you earlier how Joshua
[1:13:46] had heard the testimonies from Moses of
[1:13:49] of how God had manifested himself in the
[1:13:52] burning bush but but with those
[1:13:54] testimonies I believe it anointed
[1:13:57] Joshua's expectations that when Joshua
[1:14:01] had his own experience Joshua was not
[1:14:04] trying to run off a Moses experience
[1:14:06] Joshua needed his own experience with
[1:14:09] dog but it was anointed by a man the
[1:14:12] testimony said he heard from Moses now
[1:14:14] when Joshua runs him to the captain of
[1:14:17] the hosts hallelujah when he runs into
[1:14:21] the captain of the hosts
[1:14:22] I want you to notice he has the same
[1:14:24] experiences of the same person that
[1:14:25] Moses ran into because he heard the same
[1:14:28] command off your shoes your holy ground
[1:14:32] but now josh was there talking to the
[1:14:35] captain of hosts Joshua made a statement
[1:14:37] that we read there in Joshua 5 he says
[1:14:39] what saith my lord unto his servant I
[1:14:45] believe it was at this moment that
[1:14:47] Joshua was receiving a strategy of war
[1:14:53] Joshua and the children of Israel were
[1:14:55] preparing themselves for a battle they
[1:14:58] needed to know how to overcome the walls
[1:15:01] of
[1:15:01] Eriko Oh hallelujah and God gave them a
[1:15:05] strategy as he talked to Joshua this
[1:15:08] captain of the hosts instill these
[1:15:10] things in Joshua and he told them what I
[1:15:12] want you to do is tell the people just
[1:15:15] to march around the walls for six days
[1:15:18] one time around the walls of Jericho and
[1:15:21] I can just imagine now now now here they
[1:15:23] are walking around the Western that on
[1:15:24] the seventh day I want them to march
[1:15:26] seven times around the wall now now the
[1:15:29] other thing in this strategy that they
[1:15:31] had that if you go back and read in
[1:15:34] Joshua chapter six they could not speak
[1:15:36] a word while they were marching can you
[1:15:41] imagine it so one of the strategies of
[1:15:44] war in order to overcome the enemy in
[1:15:47] Jericho was not to say a word hallelujah
[1:15:51] you know you might be able to overcome
[1:15:54] some things in your household if you
[1:15:58] learn to apply that same strategy don't
[1:16:00] say a word hallelujah Amen you might win
[1:16:08] the battle just by keeping your mouth
[1:16:10] closed you don't have to argue about
[1:16:15] everything you don't have to fuss and
[1:16:17] fight about everything but just by
[1:16:19] keeping your mouth closed you might
[1:16:21] overcome here they were told by Joshua
[1:16:25] don't say a word you can't shout until I
[1:16:29] bid you to shout
[1:16:31] you can't talk until I bid you the talk
[1:16:34] can you imagine six days of no words six
[1:16:41] days of saying nothing ctc I'm gonna
[1:16:44] tell you another thing here if you keep
[1:16:47] it quiet then the enemy will never hear
[1:16:49] it if you can keep it quiet than the
[1:16:54] enemy don't know what you when he
[1:16:55] battled against the brother prophet told
[1:16:58] us that right saysay you gotta keep
[1:17:01] things quiet cuz then you don't let the
[1:17:02] devil know anything I can imagine the
[1:17:05] people in Jericho trying to figure out
[1:17:06] what kind of strategy is this they won't
[1:17:09] talk they won't say nothing but they
[1:17:11] just keep marching around our walls
[1:17:15] six stakes that go by and I could
[1:17:17] imagine maybe on the sixth day somebody
[1:17:19] got a little discouraged so I'm walking
[1:17:22] no more and sometimes you they can't say
[1:17:26] anything you got to read it over their
[1:17:27] face their body language is saying it
[1:17:30] and when their body language saying that
[1:17:33] I ain't walking no more I'm not getting
[1:17:34] up there some kind of way you got to use
[1:17:36] your body language you're sick you get
[1:17:43] up we all gonna walk God made us a
[1:17:47] promise and its promise King thing
[1:17:50] hallelujah say let's get up say this the
[1:17:52] last day we got to go seven times you
[1:17:57] just sent in science to just give me
[1:17:59] seven more just give me seven more and
[1:18:03] here they go walking around the walls
[1:18:06] walking around walking around and they
[1:18:08] get around to the seventh time and all
[1:18:11] eyes are on Joshua
[1:18:13] now we done did exactly what God told us
[1:18:16] to do Joshua now what now what Joshua
[1:18:20] Joshua say okay now it's time we did
[1:18:23] exactly what God said dude and now it's
[1:18:25] time to have the priests coming some
[1:18:26] horns and we're gonna let out of each
[1:18:29] they say now y'all been holding this in
[1:18:30] for six four six six days now we on the
[1:18:34] seventh day and I'm pulling out the horn
[1:18:35] he said I want you to let out the
[1:18:37] greatest shout the largest shout that
[1:18:41] you could ever let out hallelujah and
[1:18:44] Joshua said now when we blowed off
[1:18:46] points after the horns blow everybody
[1:18:50] praise God
[1:18:52] they I don't want one person with a
[1:18:54] quiet mouth a voice not lifted up a man
[1:18:58] a hand not raised a I don't want one
[1:19:01] person Amen with with that refuses to
[1:19:04] praise God and notice this before the
[1:19:08] walls came down they live out the
[1:19:11] priests you gonna have to learn how to
[1:19:14] praise God before your trial changes you
[1:19:19] want it when you want to know what
[1:19:20] you're trying your your praises was
[1:19:22] changing your trial
[1:19:23] your praises was changing the outcome
[1:19:27] hallelujah we gotta learn how to worship
[1:19:30] God before we see anything happen I'm
[1:19:33] praising God before I see my child
[1:19:35] restore huh I'm praising God before the
[1:19:38] doctor pronounces my healing I'm
[1:19:40] praising God in advance you say I don't
[1:19:44] want nobody to be quiet it says we're
[1:19:48] not when we blow this horn when we blow
[1:19:51] this horn and so they had to have
[1:19:53] patience to walk around like that
[1:19:55] it took patience for these men just to
[1:19:58] believe that that they could walk around
[1:19:59] six days on the seventh day what march
[1:20:02] seven times it took patience to believe
[1:20:04] God will do what God say he gonna do

[1:20:10] holding it in your kids been holding it
[1:20:12] in nobody could say a word for us for
[1:20:15] seven days but now that we come to this

[1:21:32] watch God bring the walls down
[1:21:38] no devil can hold that everything on the
[1:21:43] wall came down except one place one
[1:21:48] place with a scarlet thread hanging out
[1:21:50] the window rehabs house and I just love
[1:21:55] the way God does it destroyed all the
[1:21:57] rehabs customers all her enemies and you
[1:22:03] realized when rehab got married they
[1:22:09] stood up and said is there anybody here
[1:22:11] they can find any just cause as to why
[1:22:14] rehab cannot marry this general every
[1:22:23] one of her accusers we're dead
[1:22:28] nobody could lay any charge on a rehab
[1:22:33] and if they couldn't lay a charge on
[1:22:35] rehab they can't lay a charge on you
[1:22:39] who's still they a charge against God's
[1:22:41] elect it is God that justifies

[1:22:47] somebody
[1:22:50] hallelujah Oh glory Oh glory they let
[1:22:57] out that shout and I tell you what God
[1:22:58] did some mighty mighty things a man for
[1:23:02] up for the children of Israel those
[1:23:05] walls came down they walked through
[1:23:07] Jericho's their first battle Amen there
[1:23:09] in the promised land and here they had a
[1:23:12] tremendous victory this war strategy of
[1:23:16] patience paid off for them this war
[1:23:19] strategy of patience
[1:23:20] I'm reminded just one other time in
[1:23:22] Scripture and will will read this glory
[1:23:25] to God if we can David had to apply this
[1:23:30] strategy a man this war strategy as well
[1:23:34] when he was fighting the Philistines and
[1:23:37] I want you to just watch this with me
[1:23:40] because God gave him two different
[1:23:43] strategies in two different battles with
[1:23:46] the same enemy let's look at it in
[1:23:49] second Samuel Chapter five all glory
[1:23:58] sometimes when you're in battle you have
[1:24:01] to apply your faith
[1:24:02] other times you're in battle you're
[1:24:05] gonna have to apply virtue sometimes you
[1:24:08] have to apply knowledge sometimes
[1:24:11] temperance tonight we're talking about
[1:24:15] patience there's in other battles you
[1:24:17] get you are facing out the flack
[1:24:19] godliness and then there's some battles
[1:24:22] you apply charity but no matter what
[1:24:24] strategy God gives you for the battle
[1:24:26] that you're facing each one of those
[1:24:28] virtues is something that's going to
[1:24:29] help you overcome here is 2nd Samuel
[1:24:33] chapter 5 verse 19 actually verse 18 the
[1:24:40] Philistines also came and spread
[1:24:42] themselves in the valley of Rephaim
[1:24:45] David inquired of the Lord saying shall
[1:24:49] I go up to the Philistines wilt thou
[1:24:51] deliver them into my hand and here's the
[1:24:54] thing he's praying and seeking God
[1:24:55] before he does anything shall I go up to
[1:24:58] the Philistines with I'll deliver them
[1:25:00] into my hand and the Lord said unto
[1:25:02] David go up for I will doubtless deliver
[1:25:05] the Philistines into time and David came
[1:25:09] to bow perazim and David smoked them
[1:25:13] there and said the Lord has broken forth
[1:25:15] upon my enemies before me as the breach
[1:25:18] of waters therefore he called the name
[1:25:20] of that place bow perazim I love the the
[1:25:25] fact that he named this place of victory
[1:25:27] and and I found out something a man
[1:25:30] because some of you all might be
[1:25:31] standing at bow perazim tonight
[1:25:34] and what bell piercing means is Lord of
[1:25:37] the bricks Lord of the briefs a man and
[1:25:42] what I find is that if you're standing
[1:25:43] at Barrett Barrett about bow perazim
[1:25:45] there's one of two breaks that could
[1:25:48] happen one is a break down another is a
[1:25:52] break through but he's the lord of the
[1:25:56] breakthroughs he doesn't get into Victor
[1:25:59] out of you breaking down a man but he
[1:26:01] gets victory when you break through and
[1:26:03] David got victory and he broke through
[1:26:06] on the Philistines at bow perazim but
[1:26:09] notice the next battle with the same
[1:26:12] group of enemies God gives a different
[1:26:14] strategy verse 21 says and there they
[1:26:18] left their images and David and his men
[1:26:21] burned them and the Philistines came up
[1:26:25] yet again that lets you know you can
[1:26:28] never expect that the devil's just gonna
[1:26:30] stop troubling you you know what you
[1:26:32] could have just overcome something now
[1:26:34] you get ready to go through something
[1:26:35] else
[1:26:36] amen it says says and the Philistines
[1:26:39] came up yet again and spread themselves
[1:26:41] in the valley of Rephaim and when David
[1:26:44] inquired of Lord so here he goes back
[1:26:46] and he prays again David enquired our
[1:26:49] lord he said thou shalt not go up but
[1:26:52] fetch a compass behind them and come
[1:26:55] upon them over against the mulberry
[1:26:57] trees it says it let it be when thou
[1:27:00] here is the sound of a goin in the tops
[1:27:02] of the mulberry trees that then thou
[1:27:04] shalt be stirred ourselves for then
[1:27:06] shall the Lord go out before thee to
[1:27:08] smite the host of the Philistines David
[1:27:10] had to sit there and be patient and wait
[1:27:13] on God to stir the mulberry trees can I
[1:27:17] tell you something don't move until you
[1:27:20] hear from God and David did so according
[1:27:23] to verse 25 David did so as the Lord had
[1:27:26] commanded him and smote the Philistines
[1:27:29] from giba
[1:27:30] until they'll come to gazer if you'll be
[1:27:34] patient and your wait on God
[1:27:37] you'll smite your enemy as well the
[1:27:41] prophet makes a statement here in the
[1:27:43] pergamene church eh those in the bride
[1:27:47] do only his will no one can make them do
[1:27:52] otherwise they have thus saith the Lord
[1:27:55] or they keep still they know that it has
[1:27:59] to be God in them doing the works
[1:28:01] fulfilling his own word he did not
[1:28:04] complete all his work while he while in
[1:28:06] his earthly ministry so now he works in
[1:28:08] and through the bright
[1:28:11] she knows that for it was not yet time
[1:28:14] for him to do certain things that he
[1:28:15] must now do but he will now fulfill
[1:28:18] through the bride that worked which he
[1:28:20] left for this specific time these words
[1:28:23] that I'm reading to you are in the
[1:28:25] section where brother Branham was told
[1:28:27] by the angel the Lord to pick up his pen
[1:28:29] and write the angel is writing this
[1:28:31] about you he said now let us stand like
[1:28:35] Joshua and Caitlin our promised land is
[1:28:38] coming in sight even as theirs did now
[1:28:41] Joshua means Jehovah Saviour and he
[1:28:43] represents the end time leader that will
[1:28:47] come to the church even as Paul came as
[1:28:49] the original leader that's what the
[1:28:52] angel sent hallelujah and it says Caleb
[1:28:56] represents those that stay true with
[1:28:59] Joshua glory
[1:29:01] remember God has started Israel as a
[1:29:03] virgin with this word but they wanted
[1:29:05] something different so did the last
[1:29:07] state Church notice how God did not move
[1:29:10] Israel or let her go into the promised
[1:29:12] land until it was his own appointed time
[1:29:15] now the people might have put pressure
[1:29:18] on Joshua the leaders said the land is
[1:29:20] ours let's go and take it
[1:29:22] Josh where you are all through you must
[1:29:24] have lost your commitment you don't have
[1:29:26] the power you used to have you used to
[1:29:29] hear from God and know the will of God
[1:29:31] and that quickly something is wrong with
[1:29:34] you says but Joshua was a god-sent
[1:29:37] prophet and he knew the promises of God
[1:29:39] so he waited for them he waited for a
[1:29:43] clear-cut decision from God and when the
[1:29:46] time came to move God placed the full
[1:29:49] leadership in Joshua's hands because he
[1:29:51] stayed with the word God could trust
[1:29:54] Joshua but not the others so I will
[1:29:57] repeat in this end day the same problem
[1:29:59] the same pressures
[1:30:01] when the enemy is bringing in all that
[1:30:03] pressure to try to get you to buckle on
[1:30:05] the Word of God I want to encourage you
[1:30:06] stand still stand still see the
[1:30:11] salvation of your Lord he will come
[1:30:14] through maybe not when you want him to
[1:30:15] come through but he's always on time
[1:30:18] be patient with God be patient with God
[1:30:22] the Lord richly bless you
[1:30:24] hallelujah let's pray father
[1:30:37] our hearts are challenged by your word
[1:30:40] the things that we all go through
[1:30:42] Lourdes it's reality it's life we have
[1:30:47] to be reminded God of how important it
[1:30:49] is to just stand and patiently wait on
[1:30:52] you you have never failed and if you
[1:30:58] have never failed this I just don't
[1:31:01] believe it's possible for you to start
[1:31:02] filling now because you are the same
[1:31:04] yesterday today and forever they'll help
[1:31:07] us apply these strategies to our own
[1:31:09] circumstances and situations
[1:31:12] we'll find a big tree in the midst of it
[1:31:15] who God if we can just hold on when we
[1:31:18] look at Paul and all that he went
[1:31:20] through God he applied a man this this
[1:31:22] business patience God no apply patience
[1:31:26] moses applied patience abraham applied
[1:31:29] patience
[1:31:30] oh god just so many in scripture that we
[1:31:33] can look back the hebrew boy is daniel
[1:31:35] and lions being everybody waiting on the
[1:31:37] boat waiting on the lord sometimes that
[1:31:39] seems to be the hardest thing that we do
[1:31:41] is wait over you god but that's the best
[1:31:44] thing that could happen to his father we
[1:31:46] can just wait we'll see you manifest
[1:31:47] yourself in ways that we never ever
[1:31:51] I pray God that you just continue to
[1:31:53] strengthen the group of believers here

[1:36:04] ratio thank God for the Word of God amen
[1:36:13] they always say behind we've enjoyed out
[1:36:20] so stearic as well we think God wanted
[1:36:24] them both coming in God has been so good
[1:36:27] to us I tell you we we we don't deserve
[1:36:30] his goodness
[1:36:31] God gave me a double blessing you have
[1:36:33] my friends come up in I trust they still
[1:36:36] love me
[1:36:37] I gave them a piece of cake you know God
[1:36:45] people don't understand sometimes when
[1:36:47] when when people come see you that's an
[1:36:52] act of love they don't have to do that
[1:36:56] that's the way I train my children I
[1:36:59] said if somebody just give you a nickel
[1:37:01] you never forget the nickel you never
[1:37:04] forget that somebody gave you that some
[1:37:07] people shake your hand they don't have
[1:37:10] to shake your head shaking your hand is
[1:37:13] an act of kindness I act of love but
[1:37:16] you'll find out that some people won't
[1:37:17] shake your hand but people willfully do
[1:37:21] it and when somebody willfully do
[1:37:23] something for you don't ever forget me
[1:37:25] you know I won't call it a name but just
[1:37:28] just a matter of fact that almost
[1:37:30] everything I wore this morning was given
[1:37:32] to me that was an act of love people
[1:37:37] don't have to do that for you and I'll
[1:37:39] never forget you know when people do
[1:37:41] something like you know even brother
[1:37:43] luminous in its church coming over you
[1:37:46] know that's an act of love they don't
[1:37:48] have to do it I didn't make them
[1:37:50] [Music]
[1:37:54] I think I've faked each and every one of
[1:37:56] you who have come out are to to help us
[1:37:59] worship and I always think one of these
[1:38:02] old days we're gonna have an eternity to
[1:38:04] fellowship here is that right and we
[1:38:09] must always understand that we are
[1:38:12] covered by the blood it is the blood
[1:38:15] that saves us keeps us safe before we we
[1:38:23] dismiss you know I don't know if he's
[1:38:26] got something on his heart I have eight
[1:38:33] children and when you have eight
[1:38:35] children you know they're all different
[1:38:38] no they're not cookie cut it but you
[1:38:42] know I wish that first one was like the
[1:38:43] second but it don't work that way so it
[1:38:46] is it with the children of God we cannot
[1:38:49] expect each and every one of us to be
[1:38:51] the same right the thing that matters
[1:38:55] the most is that we have the same blood
[1:38:57] we come from the same father same
[1:39:01] Creator is that right and you know I
[1:39:05] don't think they've been a hot they're
[1:39:07] one of the virtues I think he could have
[1:39:09] preached on anyone but that patience is
[1:39:12] what we not only with God but with each
[1:39:16] other that was wonderful
[1:39:18] that's a masterpiece as far as I'm
[1:39:20] concerned and I'll never forget it you
[1:39:22] love the Lord and then we're just
[1:39:24] singing a song or two before we
[1:39:26] dismissed words cannot express my
[1:39:30] gratitude I'm a man I love to tell
[1:39:33] people how I feel sometimes I make
[1:39:36] people feel uncomfortable but I hear my
[1:39:39] prophet say it too he's a man that
[1:39:42] expresses his heart and I'm the kind
[1:39:44] that expresses mind and that's just the
[1:39:47] way I am sometime I'll overload people
[1:39:49] but I don't mean to when I love you I
[1:39:52] love you I give people my heart and
[1:39:54] that's what I do
