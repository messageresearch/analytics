[43:38] and no different convention and meetings
[43:40] but the person who he truly is he's a
[43:43] real Christian and you don't find people
[43:46] like that these days
[43:47] and we want to thank him and his wife in
[43:49] the church
[43:50] and the different churches to coming
[43:52] together may God bless you you and your
[43:56] family your wife and your church
[43:58] I came you know to be a blessing but it
[44:02] seems like what I'm giving I'm getting
[44:05] twice as much as receiving just from him
[44:07] so it's truly a blessing um if you have
[44:10] your scriptures which the Bible we're
[44:15] going to go to a couple of scriptures
[44:22] and first I want to go to the book of
[44:27] Deuteronomy chapter third 30 verse 15 to
[44:32] 19 Deuteronomy chapter 30 15 through 19
[44:48] and the scripture reads of verse 9 from
[44:50] verse 15 it says see I have set before
[44:53] thee this day life and good and death
[44:58] and evil in that I come and heed this
[45:01] day to love the Lord thy God to walk in
[45:04] his ways to keep his Commandments and
[45:07] his statutes and his judgments that thou
[45:10] may us live and multiply and the LORD
[45:13] thy God shall bless thee in the land
[45:15] whither thou goest to possess it but if
[45:19] dying heart turn away so that thou will
[45:23] not hear but shall be drawn away and
[45:27] worship other gods and serve them I
[45:31] denounced unto you this day that ye
[45:33] shall surely perish and that ye shall
[45:37] not prolong your days upon the land
[45:39] whither thou passes over the Jordan to
[45:42] go possess it I call heaven and earth to
[45:46] record this day against you that I have
[45:49] set before you life and death blessing
[45:51] and cursing therefore choose life that
[45:54] both died in thy seed may live
[45:57] our next scripture that we have is
[46:01] Matthew chapter 6 verse 24
[46:10] Matthew chapter 6 verse 24
[46:16] the Bible reads it says no man can serve
[46:18] two masters for either he will hate the
[46:23] one and love the other or else he will
[46:27] hold to the one and despise the other
[46:29] you cannot serve God in man man he may
[46:35] have their seats may God bless the
[46:37] reading of this word
[46:43] I've been preaching for about several
[46:46] years I've been you know I started out
[46:48] kind of young preaching about wrong I
[46:50] want to say 21 22 and I usually don't
[46:55] get nervous I usually don't get nervous
[47:00] but we just trust God will have this way
[47:05] yesterday I was speaking to the young
[47:07] people and it's been an inspiration upon
[47:09] my heart that um that we need some real
[47:14] Christians to stand up into this day so
[47:18] my topic this morning my title the theme
[47:22] is are you all in are you all out are
[47:28] you all in are you all out
[47:37] um because I realized and everything
[47:41] that you do in life you got to be
[47:43] committed to do it you got to give your
[47:46] effort you got to be inspired you have
[47:50] the ambition to really serve God or
[47:55] whatever that you're doing you got to be
[47:57] the best at what you're doing if you're
[48:02] going to be the basketball player you
[48:04] want to be the best basketball player if
[48:06] you're going to college or you're going
[48:08] to school you want to be the best
[48:09] student so whatever that you're doing
[48:11] you got to be the best but to to be the
[48:13] best you got to put tons of effort and
[48:16] practice and hard work to be successful
[48:19] and when I look at certain athletes
[48:22] movie starting certain people I realized
[48:24] that whatever that they're doing they're
[48:26] fully committed in doing it when I look
[48:29] at just you know the celebrities of
[48:31] today would it be Nicki Minaj cardi B
[48:34] jay-z who Kanye West whoever Kim
[48:37] Kardashian or whatever that they're
[48:38] doing they give their best but I was
[48:41] like what about the people of God what
[48:45] about us as Christians how is it that we
[48:47] don't give our best to God because God
[48:51] gives us his best so that got me to
[48:56] thinking that for you to be the best
[48:58] first they got to be a decision got to
[49:01] be made to start off the Prophet said
[49:05] here in the time of decision paragraph
[49:09] 10 he says you know we've been forced to
[49:12] make decisions there is times when we
[49:16] have to come to a place where we got to
[49:18] say yes or no that's just human life
[49:20] there's a time where we cannot stand
[49:23] neutral and if God shopper me I don't
[49:27] believe that we'll be able to leave this
[49:29] church tonight or this morning in the
[49:31] same conditions that we did we came into
[49:34] if the Holy Spirit shall come and do his
[49:37] work among us then we are forced to say
[49:39] yes or no we cannot remain the same
[49:42] so to start off to begin with I want to
[49:47] establish a fundamental principle the
[49:52] first principle that God gave man was a
[49:55] choice every man that is born has a
[49:58] choice you have a choice to do good you
[50:02] got a choice to do evil but you got a
[50:03] choice and every choice has rewards and
[50:08] consequences but you have to make your
[50:12] own choice your own decision nobody
[50:16] can't force you he did you notice that
[50:18] in the Bible in Genesis chapter 3 but
[50:21] what started from chapter 2 that God
[50:23] told Adam that you can't eat from any
[50:25] tree any tree but he said this one tree
[50:29] don't eat of it well God simply cut a
[50:33] totem I command you and God could have
[50:37] forced them to not do it but he said you
[50:41] have a choice so when God made man he
[50:45] gave every man every color every race a
[50:48] choice that is the first fundamental
[50:54] principle about God he he gave man a
[50:57] choice
[50:58] I mean God doesn't force you to do
[51:00] anything you got the truth what do you
[51:02] want to serve God or not what do you
[51:03] want to do right or wrong it's a choice
[51:10] what I realized sometimes as human
[51:13] beings sometimes we don't like making
[51:18] choices choices some sources are hard to
[51:22] make sometimes you have to make a choice
[51:26] whether you're gonna leave a city to go
[51:28] to a different city or sometimes you
[51:30] have to decide already gonna leave this
[51:32] family and go to that family or or this
[51:34] job or that job or that school some
[51:37] choices are difficult to make
[51:41] the Prophet said here in 1955 Redeemer
[51:45] Redemption he said that's where every
[51:49] man has to come to point in life
[51:53] sometimes they have to make a decision
[51:55] he said you have to make a choice you
[51:59] had to make a choice whether you was
[52:02] going to have an education or not you
[52:05] had to make a choice who was going to be
[52:07] your wife there has to be decisions and
[52:11] choices made in life and this may be the
[52:16] night that you have your final call to
[52:18] make your choice whom you're going to
[52:21] serve maybe your final time laying here
[52:25] dad on the stretcher or your mother over
[52:27] there young lady
[52:28] it may be your final time to make a
[52:30] choice so everything that we do starts
[52:35] from choices
[52:40] making a choice
[52:46] the second principle that I have is when
[52:49] choices are made then commitment is
[52:53] essential so when you make a choice any
[52:57] choice in life whatever that you're
[52:58] doing that if you're going to school
[52:59] whatever that when you make a choice the
[53:02] commitment is essential Church i I never
[53:07] seen where as people want to be the best
[53:10] but they don't do nothing or put any
[53:12] effort and becoming the best
[53:14] I never heard somebody who was ugly
[53:18] beautiful
[53:19] I never somebody who was the evilly good
[53:25] he was wickedly smart it's either you're
[53:29] wicked or you're smart it's either
[53:31] you're good or you're not either you do
[53:34] right or you do wrong but everywhere
[53:36] every person has a choice principle
[53:42] number two you've got to make a choice
[53:45] when you make that choice your
[53:48] commitment is essential Church one of my
[53:52] favorite athletes was Kobe Bryant now I
[53:58] never liked the Lakers because I'm a
[53:59] Miami Heat fan from Florida but I just I
[54:02] when I watch Kobe Bryant there there was
[54:04] something about me he he had a pursuit
[54:06] of excellence and I'm like this man is
[54:10] playing a game
[54:11] he's just playing basketball but he was
[54:14] so committed and being the best
[54:16] basketball player because he believed
[54:18] that God ordained him to play basketball
[54:21] he believed that whatever that he did he
[54:25] had to perfect it and I'm like this is
[54:28] the mother who's playing basketball but
[54:30] what about us Christians today what
[54:33] about believers even when I'm going to
[54:37] school I realize sometimes I'm not the
[54:39] best but I have a in ambition or an
[54:43] inspiration to be the best
[54:47] what I realized watching through these
[54:50] different athletes and you know a lot of
[54:51] people like Michael Jordan and the
[54:53] reason that people want to be like
[54:54] Jordan because he was great because
[54:59] anybody he played against he beat them
[55:01] he was successful and we as human beings
[55:06] we love a story when we are successful
[55:08] when we are overcoming well we won't
[55:10] want me to one of us as on top and when
[55:15] I look at these people sometimes I get
[55:17] inspired I'm like these people are just
[55:19] playing a sport and in every sport
[55:24] there's a reward so that got me to
[55:26] thinking if man has a reward for a sport
[55:31] what about a reward for life God is the
[55:36] only person that I that I said it one
[55:39] time I mature I said God is the only
[55:40] person I can pay you per second once you
[55:45] make a choice to serve God he will pay
[55:47] you more than what you can ever expect
[55:50] he's the only person that will pay you
[55:52] overtime as long as you work a hundred
[55:54] percent you don't have to put in the
[56:00] twenty five year retirement as long as
[56:01] you serve god your retirement is forever
[56:04] but first you got to make a choice first
[56:09] you got to be committed you got to give
[56:12] your all your effort you got to put
[56:15] everything that you can and being the
[56:17] best person that God wants you to be so
[56:21] when I look at these people I'm inspired
[56:23] I'm like these people they they
[56:25] sometimes I even heard Kobe Bryant after
[56:28] a game that he lost he went back to the
[56:30] gym to go practice well how many times
[56:34] as a Christian we go in practice
[56:36] sometimes we don't like reading the word
[56:38] sometimes we're like reading the Bible
[56:40] we don't like praying you know we don't
[56:42] like making sacrifices for a god but yet
[56:45] we want God to give us this best
[56:48] but you know there's a even God has in
[56:52] him the supply and demand if you demand
[56:58] something you got to supply it with
[57:00] something first that means if you want
[57:03] to be the best student you gotta do
[57:05] homework you got to do extra time of
[57:08] studying you know you got a sometimes
[57:10] you got a skip certain meals just to
[57:13] prepare for this exam if we can do that
[57:16] naturally speaking if we can do that
[57:19] naturally in in our basic life what
[57:22] about in God what about being the best
[57:28] Christian that there is and it's not
[57:30] saying that you're gonna do it but God
[57:32] going to help you to do
[57:38] so my question is very simple as I told
[57:41] the young people last night whose team
[57:43] are you on and whose side are you on
[57:46] because sometimes in life we get stuck
[57:48] between whether we really want to serve
[57:50] God or we don't but I'm here to tell you
[57:54] you got to make a real choice you got to
[57:57] make a real stand you can't be in
[57:59] between you can't be neutral you can't
[58:01] be maybe there's no baby there's no
[58:02] neutral than God either you with God or
[58:05] you're not either you're gonna stay with
[58:08] the word or you're not either
[58:09] you are truly gonna serve Christ or
[58:11] you're not gonna serve Him but she got
[58:16] to make a choice
[58:17] I can't fortunately I made my choice and
[58:19] I'm glad that I made it but you got to
[58:23] be certain you got to be you got to be
[58:24] positive that you're making a choice and
[58:27] you're making the right choice but when
[58:31] you make your choice you got to give
[58:32] everything that you got into it when I
[58:37] look at these people they're giving
[58:39] everything that they got into it so if
[58:42] I'm going to serve Christ you best
[58:44] believe that I'm gonna give everything
[58:45] that I got into it I may not be the best
[58:49] singer but I'm gonna sing I'm gonna be
[58:52] that best musicians but I'm gonna play
[58:53] music oh I'm gonna do whatever I can to
[58:55] make sure that I'm serving him Church it
[59:00] like I told my turn back home I said you
[59:02] know what lazy workers don't get paid I
[59:05] said if you want to get paid for
[59:08] something you got to put in some work
[59:10] just like any job if you want something
[59:13] you got to put in some work you got to
[59:16] follow the rules but just like God if
[59:19] you want to be a Christian if you want
[59:21] if you want to see the promises of God
[59:23] in your life you got to put in some work
[59:25] if you want God to bless you with a
[59:28] million dollar house where you got to
[59:30] have enough faith to get a million
[59:31] dollar house if you want God they give
[59:34] you something you got to put everything
[59:36] that you got into it but first you've
[59:40] got to be
[59:43] and sometimes we struggle for commitment
[59:47] sometimes we tell God that you know God
[59:49] we're gonna serve you Lord if you do it
[59:51] is you know we're gonna do this for you
[59:52] we're gonna sing we're gonna we're gonna
[59:54] do whatever and then when God does it we
[59:58] don't hold up the end of our bargain but
[1:00:01] that's understandable because as human
[1:00:03] beings you know we have errors we make
[1:00:05] mistakes you know we're not perfect and
[1:00:08] God knows that we're not perfect but if
[1:00:10] we believe in him he will make us
[1:00:11] perfect but sometimes we struggle with
[1:00:16] these kind of things in our lives
[1:00:18] sometimes we start out really serving
[1:00:21] God and sometimes we know God when God
[1:00:23] is speaking to us even when we're not
[1:00:25] our church we know God is calling us to
[1:00:27] do something but instead of doing that
[1:00:30] we get relaxed we tend to do something
[1:00:32] else we try to keep our minds occupied
[1:00:34] because we don't want God to keep
[1:00:36] speaking to us
[1:00:41] Church there was a point of time where
[1:00:43] the children of Israel had to make a
[1:00:45] choice even when God saved them they
[1:00:50] still went back into Egypt and started
[1:00:52] doing foolish - sometimes God deliver us
[1:00:55] many years ago but later on we started
[1:00:57] doing things that we know God called us
[1:00:59] not to do sometimes we go places and do
[1:01:02] things that God knows that we're not
[1:01:04] supposed to do it and we do it anyways
[1:01:07] but you know what I love about God he's
[1:01:09] always gracious and merciful even when
[1:01:12] I'm wrong he will still help me to do
[1:01:14] right even when I'm not living the right
[1:01:18] way God will always help you to live the
[1:01:20] right way but you got to have the right
[1:01:23] heart you got to make a real choice
[1:01:24] decision
[1:01:29] a decision or choice got to be made
[1:01:34] so we need people to make a decision it
[1:01:38] is your decision nobody else can take it
[1:01:41] away from it but you got to make it you
[1:01:45] got to pick a side you got to pick a
[1:01:46] team and then let me tell you
[1:01:48] Christ is the best team because he is
[1:01:50] the winning team there is no other
[1:01:55] winner besides Christ because he's the
[1:01:58] only person that if I die he can
[1:02:00] guarantee that I'll raise up he's the
[1:02:04] only person that can guarantee that she
[1:02:05] might not even taste death there is no
[1:02:09] other religion there is no other power
[1:02:11] that is greater than God God is the only
[1:02:14] person that I can't change a sinner into
[1:02:15] a saint he can only he's the only person
[1:02:20] I can make you stop lying make you stop
[1:02:23] stealing make us stop lusting make us
[1:02:26] stop drinking stop smoking only only the
[1:02:29] power of God can do that but sometimes
[1:02:34] when God is wants to do something we
[1:02:37] refuse to do something else because our
[1:02:39] mind is not certain we're not committed
[1:02:45] isn't that crazy that God delivered the
[1:02:48] children of Israel through a river the
[1:02:53] children of Israel seen the Egyptians
[1:02:56] fall into the river sometimes in your
[1:02:58] life you know God's really safe there
[1:03:02] are sometimes you're in their car and
[1:03:03] you see a car accident that you know it
[1:03:05] only could be God to save your life you
[1:03:09] look at certain things and you realize
[1:03:12] he said thank you Jesus but I know that
[1:03:14] was you Lord I don't know that was you
[1:03:16] God I know that was you and instead of
[1:03:19] being committed and serving God we go
[1:03:22] right back doing the same thing
[1:03:23] foolishness all over again
[1:03:27] sometimes God delivered us from some for
[1:03:30] certain things and we go right back the
[1:03:31] next day and doing the same thing that
[1:03:33] he just delivered us from trust me I
[1:03:38] know I know what I'm talking about
[1:03:39] I've been there I know the struggle I
[1:03:42] know the conflict I was there but I had
[1:03:47] to make a decision and when he make a
[1:03:51] decision I like to say that you got to
[1:03:53] have some guts back home down south and
[1:03:59] in South Florida or in the south we get
[1:04:01] it we say that you got to have some
[1:04:03] balls that means you got to be firm I
[1:04:06] mean that means you got to be so
[1:04:07] inspired that whatever that you believe
[1:04:09] that you stay to it if I'm going to be a
[1:04:12] Christian I don't care what people say
[1:04:14] I'm gonna be a real Christian I'm gonna
[1:04:16] stand strong I don't care what the devil
[1:04:18] tells me he could say that I'm alive
[1:04:20] like yeah I was but Christ saved me
[1:04:22] anyways Church I work in the jail I seen
[1:04:30] people kill other people
[1:04:33] I don't see the criminals I don't see
[1:04:37] the most evilest of people on earth but
[1:04:41] you know when I go to work I always say
[1:04:43] God make sure that my life is reflecting
[1:04:46] you because I'm committed to excellence
[1:04:49] not in man not in a mate belief but I
[1:04:53] really want to see God and everything
[1:04:54] that I do and I try to be a honest
[1:04:57] person I try to be real I tell some of
[1:05:00] the inmates I like you know what I make
[1:05:02] mistakes I said I can easily go out and
[1:05:06] do the same thing that you did we can
[1:05:08] easily go out and kill people we can
[1:05:10] smoke we can drink but I said it's only
[1:05:12] the grace of God that keeps me but I
[1:05:15] said in my heart I want to make a real
[1:05:17] choice to never hurt my god Church it's
[1:05:24] not easy when you look once when you
[1:05:26] when you know that somebody is a
[1:05:27] murderer a killer and you still got to
[1:05:30] be kind of respectful
[1:05:33] let me tell you if you don't have a real
[1:05:35] God in you you're gonna have hatred to
[1:05:37] certain people but when I go to work I
[1:05:41] know God changed my life because I can
[1:05:43] treat everybody the same and then we
[1:05:47] even tell you that I told him when I go
[1:05:48] to work I said I treat everybody I don't
[1:05:50] have problems they're like what you
[1:05:52] don't have problem I know people who are
[1:05:54] twice my age twice my size I'm only 5
[1:05:57] foot 4 maybe 145 pounds but I got us
[1:06:01] some time I got a command people who are
[1:06:03] 6 5 6 7 300-plus pounds 50 60 70 years
[1:06:06] and I got to be their boss you see when
[1:06:11] you are firm when you are committed by
[1:06:13] something you are the boss and as
[1:06:17] believes that a Christian sometimes I
[1:06:19] felt like we allowed the devil too much
[1:06:21] opportunity I don't want to get a devil
[1:06:24] for any opportunity so I stayed firm I I
[1:06:28] make sure that that wherever I'm going
[1:06:30] that I said you know what if this if
[1:06:32] there's not a God in the area let the
[1:06:34] God in my life be the one
[1:06:40] but I'm telling you got to be committed
[1:06:42] because I'm telling you when you see
[1:06:44] purple on the news when you see serial
[1:06:46] killers and there you don't want that
[1:06:48] got to be exporting them but they don't
[1:06:50] kill 710 people chuckle did he kill him
[1:06:52] in a spot but I'm fearless
[1:06:55] every minute sometimes I get scared Oh
[1:06:58] sometimes trust me sometimes I am scared
[1:06:59] but there's something in me that's
[1:07:01] stronger than being scared there's
[1:07:06] something in me that that that is that
[1:07:08] is just not powerful is just not
[1:07:10] boastful it's not big but it is certain
[1:07:12] I know that I'm a child of God I don't
[1:07:14] gotta guess I don't got to be maybe I
[1:07:17] know I'm a child of God and I know if
[1:07:18] God put me somewhere he put me there for
[1:07:20] our purpose and I stick to it I stand my
[1:07:23] ground I don't I don't allow people to
[1:07:27] lead me other places that it's not
[1:07:28] Christian like I said if Christ if
[1:07:31] Christ can't go then I definitely cannot
[1:07:33] go
[1:07:34] if Christ can't do what we do then I'm
[1:07:37] definitely then I ain't doing what
[1:07:38] you're doing because I'm committed I
[1:07:42] made a commitment I had to put some
[1:07:46] confidence some good I had to make sure
[1:07:48] that if I'm gonna serve Christ serve him
[1:07:50] completely don't be no 5050 maybe one
[1:07:54] day you're in church wind a yacht one
[1:07:56] day you're praying the next day you're
[1:07:57] not praying one day you believe God and
[1:07:59] next thing you don't believe God know
[1:08:00] you gotta make a choice you got to pick
[1:08:03] a side you got to pick a team either
[1:08:08] you're really gonna serve God or you're
[1:08:09] not sometimes us older people sometimes
[1:08:14] we we think that just because we're a
[1:08:17] Christian and after many years we are
[1:08:19] right I you know what I hate being
[1:08:22] average
[1:08:22] I hate being all right I don't want to
[1:08:26] become normal I don't want to be just a
[1:08:29] regular person doesn't mean that I'm
[1:08:32] trying to boast and show myself but I
[1:08:34] know God called me to be something
[1:08:36] greater I'm so inspired that I when I go
[1:08:40] places I don't want people to fall down
[1:08:42] and worship the goddess in my heart
[1:08:44] could I know he's a true Living God
[1:08:47] I know God saved me listen I grew up in
[1:08:51] the church miss my dad was a pastor and
[1:08:53] I was still living wrong even though he
[1:08:58] did right I was still living wrong I was
[1:08:59] still living my life I was doing
[1:09:01] whatever I wanted to do but when I made
[1:09:03] a choice to really serve God listen
[1:09:07] there are some things that you try to do
[1:09:10] and you want to do but you can't do it
[1:09:14] sometimes I understand that sometimes
[1:09:17] people really want to be saved people
[1:09:20] really want to be changed people really
[1:09:22] want to excel in God but it's sometimes
[1:09:26] it's like something that's holding them
[1:09:28] back and sometimes the devil will put us
[1:09:32] in our slavery mental slavery spiritual
[1:09:36] slavery that you can't be the great
[1:09:40] person that God called you to be because
[1:09:42] they've done this because they've done
[1:09:44] that as I turn my church I said wasn't
[1:09:48] Abraham a man of faith wasn't Abraham
[1:09:52] called a man of faith right he's okay
[1:09:54] he's he's associative around the whole
[1:09:57] road as the father of faith right but
[1:10:01] he's the father favorite didn't Abraham
[1:10:03] tell a lie so how can a person who told
[1:10:07] a lie still be the father of faith only
[1:10:10] with God only God can make you perfect
[1:10:14] with every mistake and flaw in your life
[1:10:18] he's the only person that anything that
[1:10:21] you've done even her honor he has enough
[1:10:23] power to change you from evil to good
[1:10:27] and he does it for free
[1:10:32] but first abraham was committed
[1:10:38] he believed God that he was I believe
[1:10:40] also called a friend of God think about
[1:10:44] that
[1:10:44] he believed God so much that even God
[1:10:46] had to call him like God you know what a
[1:10:48] friend you know certainly a friend that
[1:10:50] you have to trust to have friends and if
[1:10:54] God can trust a liar think about it God
[1:10:57] trust a liar to be the father of faith
[1:10:59] what about us today we know different
[1:11:02] that's why I don't have to walk around
[1:11:04] with my head down and and finish sad if
[1:11:07] God could do that for Abraham and he
[1:11:08] still got today he still can do it for
[1:11:10] me what about David Davis one of my
[1:11:17] favorite characters you know about David
[1:11:19] David was a king Psalm is a worshiper
[1:11:25] but David was also disobedient he also
[1:11:30] killed another man's wife and yet God
[1:11:35] said in the book of Acts he said David
[1:11:38] is a man after my own heart
[1:11:40] how do you call a killer a man after my
[1:11:43] own heart
[1:11:47] but because david has something in his
[1:11:50] life that even he know when he was wrong
[1:11:52] he still can say Lord I'm wrong I'm
[1:11:53] sincere Lord I ain't live in the right
[1:11:55] way but only you can change me to make
[1:11:57] me live right in my life there's some
[1:12:03] things that I do I'd be like Lord how
[1:12:06] how do you still in love there's certain
[1:12:11] things that we do in our lives that we
[1:12:13] start the questioning God sometimes
[1:12:15] sometimes we we start drinking and
[1:12:18] smoking and doing all kind of you know
[1:12:20] simple other people wise and different
[1:12:21] stuff like that and and we just think
[1:12:23] about it like God how how is it that you
[1:12:25] still love me not even that call do you
[1:12:29] call us your children sometimes the
[1:12:35] devil will come and we'll plant certain
[1:12:37] things in your minds that if you come to
[1:12:40] church they go and talk evil about you
[1:12:42] they're gonna say that you're a
[1:12:43] hypocrite and you say that that's really
[1:12:45] anywhere I go I say hypocrites are
[1:12:47] everywhere they're in church and out of
[1:12:49] church sometimes we ourselves are the
[1:12:52] biggest hypocrites because we say things
[1:12:55] that we know but that we sometimes we
[1:12:56] even don't even do but I was like you
[1:13:00] know what God is another person that can
[1:13:02] change a hypocrite to a saint God isn't
[1:13:06] one person that can make a liar to be
[1:13:08] honest only God but first you gotta make
[1:13:12] a choice in your heart listen I
[1:13:17] understand that some of us we might have
[1:13:19] different kind of problems some
[1:13:22] spiritual some mental some physical
[1:13:27] but you got to make your own choice you
[1:13:31] got to make your own stand you got to be
[1:13:34] committed to whatever side that you're
[1:13:36] gonna pick on whatever that it is I'm
[1:13:40] not I'm not here to abash you or to a
[1:13:42] discouraged I'm here to encourage you
[1:13:44] because listen I don't made some bad
[1:13:46] mistakes
[1:13:47] I'm sure brother Brooks don't make some
[1:13:49] bad mistakes but we still believe we
[1:13:52] still have an inspiration that we are
[1:13:54] born to be great
[1:13:55] I know that I'm called to be great in
[1:14:02] God every child of call every child of
[1:14:07] God is called to be great but the only
[1:14:10] way that you can be great is if you have
[1:14:12] a real God in your life and they have a
[1:14:16] real God in your life you got to have
[1:14:17] the holy spirit that's the only thing
[1:14:21] that will make you great
[1:14:30] the Prophet said here in God's
[1:14:33] preparation 1954 he says stay right
[1:14:40] where you're at till God says it
[1:14:43] don't shake at everyone see stay right
[1:14:45] there you know that even if you're a
[1:14:48] little out of the way if you're really
[1:14:51] in your heart be sincere and stand firm
[1:14:54] in on what you believe God will respect
[1:14:58] even God got to respect your own choice
[1:15:04] that's why he said whatever you say to
[1:15:07] your mountain not what God says but
[1:15:11] whatever you say to your own whatever
[1:15:16] that you believe in your heart if you
[1:15:18] really believe it God would give it to
[1:15:19] you but sometimes we we say certain we
[1:15:25] sometimes we say things and right when
[1:15:28] we say it we don't know don't believe
[1:15:29] what even when we say I believe I heard
[1:15:33] a story that says that a lady had a
[1:15:35] mountain ice out of her window and she
[1:15:39] said Mountain be removed that maybe look
[1:15:44] out the window she said hmm just as I'd
[1:15:46] expected you're still here and sometimes
[1:15:52] we do that sometimes we say god I'm
[1:15:54] gonna do something devil get out my way
[1:15:56] and when we look you say hmm you know
[1:15:58] whatever just as expected you're still
[1:16:00] here
[1:16:03] sometimes there's certain things in our
[1:16:05] life that we know that I would to be
[1:16:06] overcoming and we don't and we say just
[1:16:10] as expected you're still here
[1:16:13] sickness you're still here I thought I
[1:16:16] cast you out but you know what as
[1:16:18] expected you're still here but when you
[1:16:22] believe something when you're inspired
[1:16:24] you believe that impossible can be
[1:16:27] possible
[1:16:30] there's not a person in this water that
[1:16:32] that does not like a comeback story we
[1:16:36] like being the underdogs we like when
[1:16:39] things are kind of low when we're
[1:16:43] against all odds and we're able to be
[1:16:46] successfully able to succeed well I
[1:16:50] don't know about your life but maybe you
[1:16:52] may be against all odds maybe maybe the
[1:16:55] underdog
[1:16:57] maybe you you you may be at the point of
[1:17:00] your life where you do not know what to
[1:17:02] do but let me tell me help you out here
[1:17:03] make a choice to serve God he's the only
[1:17:09] person that he can stand for you when
[1:17:11] everyone else will fail you he's the
[1:17:15] only person when that when the devil
[1:17:17] comes to accuse you of every sin that he
[1:17:19] can stand and say that this person never
[1:17:21] sinned in the first place but first you
[1:17:26] got to make first you got to make a
[1:17:28] choice to pick him as your lawyer as
[1:17:30] your advocate your attorney because
[1:17:35] every man has a choice to decide who
[1:17:37] would offend you who would not and let
[1:17:40] me tell you we're getting to a point in
[1:17:42] in a day in this life that the way that
[1:17:45] we live this world will be judged when
[1:17:48] you want to hear it or not this world
[1:17:49] would be judged every man will have to
[1:17:51] face God some day a lot about you but
[1:17:56] that scares me that every man will have
[1:17:58] to face God but the reason that I'm no
[1:18:00] longer scared because I've made a choice
[1:18:02] to serve God in the first place
[1:18:04] so if I stand for Christ he Christ got
[1:18:06] no choice but to stand for me if you
[1:18:10] choose Christ Christ has no choice but
[1:18:12] to stand for you but first you've got to
[1:18:14] stand for him and when you stand you got
[1:18:18] to stand strong
[1:18:21] many of us we hate weak people
[1:18:24] weak-minded people anything I was a week
[1:18:26] in the next one that's that looks solved
[1:18:29] we don't like it
[1:18:30] that's almost like a human nature we
[1:18:32] don't we don't like seeing things that
[1:18:34] are weak but let me tell you what out
[1:18:40] Christ you will be weak without the Holy
[1:18:44] Spirit you will be weak but even in our
[1:18:47] weakness God is still strong even in our
[1:18:51] flaws God is still strong but first you
[1:18:57] got to be like every man every man has a
[1:18:59] choice to make
[1:19:04] trust me when the devil comes on a day
[1:19:06] of judgment the devil and his demons
[1:19:08] will have every foul every recording
[1:19:12] every word every action of what you the
[1:19:16] way that she lived like that is wrong
[1:19:18] before God everything evil and died bad
[1:19:22] as she did in your life the devil will
[1:19:24] put it before God and even your own life
[1:19:28] can either was set you free or what not
[1:19:30] set you free well prove that you serve
[1:19:33] God or you did it the devil may have his
[1:19:37] Case Files he may have his witnesses he
[1:19:41] may have evidence but if you have the
[1:19:45] right attorney if you have the right
[1:19:49] lawyer if you have the right advocate
[1:19:52] things can change when your case may
[1:19:56] look impossible it can definitely be
[1:19:57] possible Christ is the only person that
[1:20:02] can look the devil in the eye and said
[1:20:03] that person never sinned in the first
[1:20:05] place
[1:20:09] Christ is the only person that can make
[1:20:11] every evidence of evil in your life
[1:20:13] disappear but first you got to make sure
[1:20:20] that Christ is your advocate you got to
[1:20:22] make sure he's a lawyer you gotta make
[1:20:25] sure that he's the person that you can
[1:20:27] only count on because man can't save you
[1:20:31] we're living in the day where
[1:20:33] everybody's scared of something but the
[1:20:35] biggest thing to be scared about is
[1:20:37] death but if you have Christ you won't
[1:20:40] be scared
[1:20:41] you can look death in the eye and say
[1:20:44] that you can't even touch me until God
[1:20:45] says so see when you have faith when you
[1:20:50] have confidence you're bold you're
[1:20:54] fearless
[1:20:55] you're confident you can't walk with
[1:20:58] your head up not because it's you but
[1:21:01] because there's a God in you
[1:21:04] but she got to make a choice you got to
[1:21:08] make a decision
[1:21:10] if you want to be the best you got to
[1:21:12] put in effort to be the best I think I
[1:21:16] encouraged my church I said if you want
[1:21:18] to be the best husband put in a word to
[1:21:19] be the best husband if you want to be to
[1:21:22] come to the best man be the best man
[1:21:24] that God had called you to be and not
[1:21:25] what you think you want to be if you
[1:21:28] want to be the best Christian make sure
[1:21:30] that you do everything that you can to
[1:21:31] be the best Christian don't settle for
[1:21:34] second place
[1:21:34] there's no first second second first
[1:21:37] either your first or your in second
[1:21:38] either you're the best or you're not
[1:21:42] anything that you do in your life be
[1:21:45] successful be great but most importantly
[1:21:48] when you're serving God be the best that
[1:21:50] you can be in God come to every service
[1:21:54] if you can pray whenever you can fast
[1:21:56] read your Bible sing songs testify
[1:21:59] witness make sure that when people look
[1:22:02] at your life that they can only see
[1:22:04] Christ but it starts with making a
[1:22:08] decision and this morning a decision
[1:22:13] lays before you either you're gonna be
[1:22:16] all into God or not
[1:22:20] as the Prophet said here in one of these
[1:22:22] messages I think total deliverance
[1:22:29] paragraph 49 he said if you are a
[1:22:33] Christian God don't make halfway
[1:22:36] Christians God makes complete Christians
[1:22:42] God don't make half way preachers but
[1:22:45] their preacher can be half way and God
[1:22:49] makes his children Christians but
[1:22:51] sometimes they're half way Christian but
[1:22:54] it's not God's intention for them to be
[1:22:58] that way think about it it's not God's
[1:23:00] intention for you to be average
[1:23:08] god don't want them to be halfway
[1:23:10] Christians or halfway preachers
[1:23:13] compromising on either side he wants
[1:23:16] them to completely stand in the briefs
[1:23:18] what is he trying to say he's trying to
[1:23:20] say that if whatever that you're doing
[1:23:22] be the best
[1:23:27] he even got to the point when he said if
[1:23:29] you're gonna be the thief be the best
[1:23:30] thief Wow
[1:23:33] he said God will respect that anyways
[1:23:36] God doesn't like hypocrites that's one
[1:23:38] thing that God hates he's a hypocrite
[1:23:41] somebody who's pretending and they're
[1:23:43] not well I don't want to be a pretender
[1:23:47] I don't want to be a maybe Christian or
[1:23:48] maybe so I think so he could be she
[1:23:51] could be now I'm gonna be the real thing
[1:23:54] whenever you have the real thing you
[1:23:57] know you're certain that is real but
[1:23:59] when he got the generic brand sometimes
[1:24:03] it don't gave you the full effect of the
[1:24:05] real brand well if you want to be a real
[1:24:09] Christian it takes a spirit of God in
[1:24:11] your heart in your soul to make you a
[1:24:13] real Christian and that's what God calls
[1:24:16] man to be just like him with an own way
[1:24:19] to be like him to be like rice no know
[1:24:23] what to be like questions to have his
[1:24:24] Spirit of Christ in your life because
[1:24:27] Christ will make you just like Christ as
[1:24:30] I'm getting ready to close in a few
[1:24:32] minutes think about this right a kitten
[1:24:38] is what
[1:24:42] think about this kitten is what a cat
[1:24:46] writing small version of a cat right
[1:24:49] what about a puppy
[1:24:54] puppies a dog right
[1:24:56] so if nature can testify of the word of
[1:24:59] God right so the children of God can
[1:25:02] only be would the children of God can
[1:25:06] only be what y'all sure y'all sure is
[1:25:10] that the word is that true so if you're
[1:25:13] a child of God that means you're what
[1:25:15] hmm
[1:25:19] not me but your own mouth you testify
[1:25:22] that's true of what you see of what you
[1:25:27] hear what you understand think about
[1:25:28] that's that's just simple so when the
[1:25:33] devil tells you otherwise why would he
[1:25:35] listen to him in the first place the
[1:25:39] devil wasn't created to be God so I'm
[1:25:41] gonna listen listen listen smarter who's
[1:25:42] not God I can only be what God wants me
[1:25:47] to be and I thought that's my child of
[1:25:50] God if I'm truly a child of God I can
[1:25:52] only be one thing but eight just like
[1:25:54] God but first you got to make a choice
[1:26:00] you got to be committed then when you
[1:26:04] committed you got to be all in you got
[1:26:07] to give everything that you got you got
[1:26:10] to be as a herd in the south you got to
[1:26:12] be a hundred percent you got to be 100
[1:26:14] you got to make sure that if you're
[1:26:17] serving God serve remove everything that
[1:26:18] you got if you're going to be the best
[1:26:21] child be the best toy that you're going
[1:26:23] to be the best student be the best
[1:26:24] student the best worker be the best
[1:26:26] worker whatever actually doing be the
[1:26:28] best because God doesn't require
[1:26:31] anything less but being the best but
[1:26:35] first you got to have a drive you got to
[1:26:36] have a motivation you got to have the
[1:26:38] inspiration as the musicians come you
[1:26:42] got to make a choice
[1:26:46] as God said in his word you cannot serve
[1:26:50] two masters Matthew 6 verse 24 either
[1:26:55] you're gonna serve God or you're not
[1:26:56] gonna serve God either you're gonna go
[1:26:58] all the way or you're not going all the
[1:27:00] way but there's no in-between there's no
[1:27:01] maybe there's no halfway there's no
[1:27:03] neutral so this morning what I'm trying
[1:27:07] to say I'm trying to say that you got to
[1:27:08] be fully committed into whatever that
[1:27:10] you're doing if you're going to be a
[1:27:13] thief please be the best thing that you
[1:27:15] can be but if you're going to be a
[1:27:17] Christian be the best Christian that you
[1:27:19] can be because every choice has rewards
[1:27:23] and consequences is it easy being a
[1:27:27] Christian of course not matter of fact
[1:27:29] God even told us you're gonna suffer
[1:27:31] persecutions people mean I like you they
[1:27:34] might talk evil about you they might
[1:27:37] even try to kill you and hurt you but he
[1:27:41] said that you will be blessed in this
[1:27:43] earth in this world and in the world to
[1:27:46] come things that man can't even dream
[1:27:51] about that God has in store for you but
[1:27:54] first you got to be committed
[1:27:57] every young person you got to be
[1:27:59] committed God says in his Bible he says
[1:28:04] children obey your parents if you want
[1:28:07] to be the best child Oh BAE your parent
[1:28:11] if you want to be the best student we
[1:28:14] respect the teacher be the best student
[1:28:16] you can be but I go above and beyond it
[1:28:19] if you want to be a Christian beep be
[1:28:22] sincere and be the best Christian that
[1:28:23] you can be because God has a reward that
[1:28:27] no man can even think of or what he's
[1:28:29] gonna reward you with but you got to be
[1:28:32] committed you got to give it everything
[1:28:35] that she got you got to be motivated you
[1:28:38] got to be inspired you got to be even if
[1:28:42] you don't only person on earth you would
[1:28:44] still a servant love God come on pastor
[1:28:50] Brooks
[1:28:51] [Music]
[1:28:53] that is my inspiration if I'm the only
[1:28:56] person on earth I still be a witness for
[1:28:59] God I don't care how many Devils that is
[1:29:02] or that is in this world
[1:29:04] I don't care on people who don't believe
[1:29:05] in God if God needs a witness he is it
[1:29:08] is me and people want to see God it is
[1:29:13] me because I am called to be great I was
[1:29:19] called and chosen to be like rice that
[1:29:23] is the motivation that is the goal of
[1:29:24] Christianity to be like Christ
[1:29:27] but a be like Christ it takes a decision
[1:29:30] it takes a choice is there anyone here
[1:29:34] this one I must make a choice if you do
[1:29:38] want prayer you can come for a parade on
[1:29:40] man but when you make your choice be
[1:29:45] real in your life be running your heart
[1:29:47] so if God you know sometimes I sometimes
[1:29:50] you know I really want to serve you Lord
[1:29:53] sometimes I know that your calling
[1:29:56] Lord I know your voice but sometimes I
[1:29:59] get caught up in myself but if you want
[1:30:03] to overcome and say lord help me to make
[1:30:07] the right choice okay this morning I
[1:30:10] want to make a choice to serve you
[1:30:12] forever serve you with all my heart
[1:30:15] serve you 100% and I told you God is the
[1:30:20] only person I can pay you a hundred
[1:30:22] percent of your wages full compensation
[1:30:28] full retirement and some Lord but first
[1:30:32] you got to give your whole heart to
[1:30:34] Jesus they don't matter if you're five
[1:30:38] ten fifteen fifty or seventy we can
[1:30:42] always give more to Jesus
[1:30:44] and that is the goal give God your best
[1:30:52] I'm getting ready to close give God your
[1:30:54] best don't be satisfied of being average
[1:31:00] average things are never really the best
[1:31:04] when we go to try to get our cars we try
[1:31:07] to get the best car when we get suits
[1:31:10] and clothes try to get the best clothing
[1:31:11] the best shoes the best food and we
[1:31:16] can't do that for the natural what about
[1:31:19] a spiritual God so if you truly want to
[1:31:24] be the best come serve God make a choice
[1:31:28] make a stand stay committed to it and do
[1:31:32] it for your heart as we all stand
[1:31:37] is there anyone this one.i wants to give
[1:31:39] their life to Christ Jesus anybody wants
[1:31:43] to make a real choice to serve God could
[1:31:45] I tell you
[1:31:46] there is no sweeter man than Jesus
[1:31:50] there's no person who can bless you like
[1:31:52] Jesus there's nobody who can take your
[1:31:55] troubles away like Jesus and nobody
[1:31:58] can't reward you like Jesus but first
[1:32:05] you got to make a choice in your heart
[1:32:09] if you want to make that choice
[1:32:12] if you made it stay strong stay firm
[1:32:18] don't let any devil any person any place
[1:32:22] anything they're spirits you from
[1:32:24] keeping your choice is there anybody
[1:32:30] here this one I wants to give their life
[1:32:31] to Christ you can raise your hand if you
[1:32:32] want
[1:32:36] may God bless you
[1:32:39] stick to your choice it might be hard it
[1:32:44] might be difficult it might be some pain
[1:32:50] but just like every race there's a
[1:32:52] reward at the end but you got to keep
[1:32:55] running you got to be persistent you got
[1:32:58] to stay strong every head bowed every
[1:33:04] eyes closed

[1:37:18] [Music]
[1:37:23] [Music]
[1:37:34] Oh
[1:37:34] [Music]
[1:37:47] I love with God speaks to me I don't
[1:38:11] have to try to figure it out it is what
[1:38:15] it is I don't know whether the Lord
[1:38:18] spoke to your heart this morning but I
[1:38:20] know the brothers preached last night
[1:38:23] and I said to myself I want to be the
[1:38:25] best Christian ever you know I read
[1:38:28] about Paul and James and John and all
[1:38:31] the rest of them that was their day this
[1:38:34] is our day and we have to decide you
[1:38:39] know by God's grace I didn't tell the
[1:38:41] man what to preach
[1:38:43] God told him what to preach and I know
[1:38:47] it spoke to my heart because I don't
[1:38:50] know I was telling somebody the other
[1:38:51] day I said one thing I know about the
[1:38:53] law of God you read what you saw and
[1:38:57] even when you do something that you
[1:38:59] don't need to do there's an action if
[1:39:04] the science is for every action there's
[1:39:06] an opposite and equal reaction to just
[1:39:10] get the science update we have to pay
[1:39:14] back whatever we put out right love that
[1:39:20] and when you thought the thought about
[1:39:22] supply and demand one thing I love about
[1:39:25] God how many y'all have never seen a
[1:39:28] movie necklace a raging you ever see the
[1:39:30] movie you know what ain't you living in
[1:39:34] but we know that movies are something
[1:39:38] that is recorded in time in this night
[1:39:41] vision you you're recorded right and
[1:39:46] some of us we didn't live in a time of
[1:39:48] Marilyn Monroe but we can pull a movie
[1:39:52] up and gas pot Marilyn Monroe Liz still
[1:39:57] acting the same way she did right we
[1:40:02] hear her voice we see her face we know
[1:40:05] her smile we know where she looks like
[1:40:06] we know how she acts and it's August
[1:40:10] recorded that's man's doing now how can
[1:40:15] we explain when God says he sees the all
[1:40:19] he's the all-seeing eye he sees
[1:40:21] everything every move you make every
[1:40:24] breath you take is being recorded so you
[1:40:29] won't be able to say lord I didn't do
[1:40:31] that
[1:40:32] God hit the button flash is on the scene
[1:40:39] everybody in the judgment will see your
[1:40:43] life the only way to escape that is to
[1:40:48] be washed in the blood of the leg
[1:40:51] hallelujah the only way that all of your
[1:40:56] sins could be done away with is through
[1:40:59] Christ hallelujah is that right he just
[1:41:04] don't did leave it but he casted in the
[1:41:07] sea of forgetfulness
[1:41:09] the plan of Jesus Christ but justify you
[1:41:12] as though you've never seen in the first
[1:41:15] place what a mighty God we serve that's
[1:41:21] why I serve Him
[1:41:23] you know God just don't erase it you
[1:41:26] know a lot of times a rage you remember
[1:41:28] till the way we used to do tell so in
[1:41:30] paper I think this now everything is
[1:41:32] computer now so back in the day we used
[1:41:34] to have up you know you're right with
[1:41:36] your pencil and you know your bet you
[1:41:39] have to make sure you got a good eraser
[1:41:43] sometimes that eraser doesn't it won't
[1:41:45] get it you won't erase everything
[1:41:47] because it leaves an imprint but God
[1:41:51] doesn't do that
[1:41:52] God doesn't be racing like that he
[1:41:54] doesn't leave an imprint there so some
[1:41:56] evidence that you used to do those
[1:41:58] things
[1:41:58] whoa he takes every bit of it away there
[1:42:05] is no evidence you understand me it's
[1:42:10] when God saves you he takes away
[1:42:12] everything everything you've ever done
[1:42:14] wrong he takes it away he puts it in a
[1:42:17] seal forget it that's why God calls us
[1:42:20] perfect
[1:42:22] you can never be perfect on your own but
[1:42:25] God says because of the blood of Jesus
[1:42:27] crime he has justified you sanctify you
[1:42:32] feel you and the Holy Ghost and when you
[1:42:35] get the Holy Ghost you do extra yeah
[1:42:39] I'll be something called weird but
[1:42:42] that's okay I can't help but to be Who I
[1:42:45] am you love the Lord I really enjoyed
[1:42:50] the Word of God
[1:42:51] I appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:42:56] all that he's doing you know brother
[1:42:59] lies as a preacher too but you know we
[1:43:07] get him another time
[1:43:09] Nords wheel and you know I just want to
[1:43:12] I want to say by God's grace thank you
[1:43:15] for just being here and pulling on the
[1:43:18] Word of God it really got comfortable in
[1:43:22] here but I think God because you here
[1:43:31] God sees you here even though you may
[1:43:35] not see God with your own eyes he see
[1:43:38] you
[1:43:38] he hears your thoughts he knows you he
[1:43:41] brought you here you said I made the
[1:43:44] decision but God gave you grace to make
[1:43:45] the decision and I thank God for that
[1:43:49] grace I remember the time I used to be
[1:43:52] afraid I was afraid to be a Christian
[1:43:56] because I thought I could never live it
[1:43:59] excuse me
[1:44:04] and what I do live
[1:44:12] [Music]
[1:44:15] see nobody knows where I come from I
[1:44:21] know God has changed me I could I could
[1:44:26] not have changed myself and he's still
[1:44:30] changing me that's why I'm excited about
[1:44:34] this gospel because people need to know
[1:44:36] they can be changed my mother was a
[1:44:40] Christian I thought I had to work on it
[1:44:42] you know to me I thought I had to you
[1:44:45] know it's like a boy followed in his
[1:44:46] daddy's footprints you know in that
[1:44:50] sense I thought I had to work I thought
[1:44:51] I had I thought I had to change me
[1:44:59] you chose
[1:45:08] [Music]
[1:45:13] there were things in my life I thought I
[1:45:15] couldn't overcome in my life they
[1:45:24] tormented me but when Jesus come Jesus
[1:45:31] can change you my mom lived that life
[1:45:36] and I didn't know about the Holy Ghost I
[1:45:38] didn't know about it like I said I'd see
[1:45:41] her get happy and do things that scared
[1:45:43] me you know because I didn't understand
[1:45:46] but I know I've seen people at ballgames
[1:45:49] and they get excited not people popcorn
[1:45:52] over jump and scream in your ear and
[1:45:55] your ear rings like oh my god is still
[1:45:57] there you know
[1:45:59] but they get caught up into that
[1:46:01] anointing and before you know it they in
[1:46:04] midair when they realize what they've
[1:46:05] done they just jumped the Holy Ghost is
[1:46:09] the same way but it's a greater joy we
[1:46:12] can't help it we can't help it
[1:46:14] it's like putting popcorn on fire I
[1:46:17] can't help but to pop
[1:46:20] that's how it is with the people of God
[1:46:22] don't be ashamed of your inheritance if
[1:46:27] the all the other churches grow dead and
[1:46:29] no excitement
[1:46:30] don't let your joy right it's not even
[1:46:34] if you lose your joy doesn't mean you'll
[1:46:35] not say you know is that right
[1:46:38] they said restore to me unto me the joy
[1:46:41] I don't know what what what being what
