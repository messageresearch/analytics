[34:25] pray amen amen
[34:28] you may be
[34:30] seated my subject
[34:33] tonight
[34:35] Jesus the name of the almighty
[34:41] God we know that the name
[34:45] Jesus also means Jehovah
[34:50] savior it is also the same name as
[34:56] Joshua some people say
[35:00] yesu but we must understand why it's
[35:05] important to understand the person of
[35:08] Jesus
[35:11] Christ because if we know the
[35:16] word we understand he is the alpha as
[35:19] well as the
[35:23] Omega Jesus stressed or God stressed
[35:31] to
[35:34] Israel and important
[35:38] fact he said know ye
[35:43] Israel the Lord he is
[35:46] God and he also said the Lord thy God is
[35:53] one it's very important in this day
[35:58] idolatry is
[36:02] flourishing people are worshiping
[36:06] everything even
[36:08] themselves but we must recognize that
[36:11] there is a place of
[36:18] hiding the psalmist said the name of the
[36:20] Lord is a strong
[36:24] towel and the righteous run in and they
[36:26] are safe
[36:27] [Music]
[36:30] but this same invisible
[36:33] God thought within himself to become
[36:37] man and this was a great
[36:41] event because we realized that
[36:43] throughout all of the
[36:47] ages God shadowed and typed
[36:54] himself and but they come that was to
[36:56] come a day
[37:00] that God was going to do a miraculous
[37:05] thing it in itself
[37:08] proves that God can do whatever he wants
[37:11] to
[37:12] do let's turn to Matthew
[37:16] 1 remember we're not talking about a
[37:19] second
[37:20] God we're not talking about the third
[37:22] one we're talking about the
[37:25] God the almighty God
[37:30] remember even after the resurrection of
[37:34] Jesus the Bible said all power in heaven
[37:38] and in
[37:41] Earth was given to him
[37:44] am hallelujah hallelujah and if all
[37:47] power in Heaven and
[37:49] Earth was given to
[37:52] him where does it leave the other gods
[38:01] the mystery of God is a
[38:04] revelation when you read the Bible
[38:06] sometimes you'll see
[38:09] two and sometimes you'll see
[38:12] three that's when you're looking in your
[38:15] natural
[38:16] eyes but in the
[38:19] spiritual if you fully understand the
[38:22] revelation of
[38:24] God you understand that he's one
[38:28] now you better you better listen to what
[38:30] I'm
[38:31] saying every
[38:33] Christian ought to be able to
[38:38] explain to the
[38:41] nonbeliever and the
[38:43] unbeliever and those who think they
[38:47] believe the position of Jesus
[38:52] Christ hallelujah hallelujah matthew2
[38:55] to2
[39:01] but while he thought on these
[39:03] things behold the angel of the Lord
[39:06] appeared unto him in a
[39:09] dream saying
[39:11] Joseph thou son of David fear not to
[39:15] take on the the Mary thy
[39:18] wife for that which is conceived in her
[39:21] is of the Holy
[39:24] Ghost and look how he says it
[39:27] and she shall bring forth a
[39:30] son and thou shall call him
[39:33] Jesus remember Jesus mean Jehovah
[39:37] Savior for he shall save his people from
[39:41] their
[39:43] sins now all of this was
[39:46] done that it might be fulfilled which
[39:49] was spoken of the Lord by the prophet
[39:52] saying Behold a virgin shall be with
[39:56] child
[39:59] and shall bring forth a
[40:01] son and they shall call his name
[40:05] Emmanuel which being
[40:08] interpreted God With
[40:11] Us hallelujah hallelujah this is very
[40:16] important because as I said if you don't
[40:18] see the Oneness of God you never see how
[40:22] you become one with
[40:25] God hallelujah
[40:28] God in
[40:30] flesh Luke 134
[40:37] through3 is
[40:43] important cuz you'll see and
[40:46] understand it wasn't a second man or
[40:48] second person that died for
[40:52] you it was God in human flesh
[40:58] God became the
[41:01] [Music]
[41:02] sacrifice then said Mary unto the
[41:06] angel how shall this thing
[41:09] be seeing I know not a
[41:14] man you and I I grew up believing that
[41:18] Jesus was part
[41:22] Jew believing that Mary had something to
[41:25] do with it
[41:28] [Music]
[41:29] but we understand if Mary had had had
[41:32] had anything to do with
[41:34] it the blood would have been
[41:39] contaminated it would not have been pure
[41:42] enough to
[41:44] save
[41:46] nobody not even
[41:48] me hallelujah hallelujah so God created
[41:52] the
[41:55] egg and the life jour
[41:58] everything that was in
[42:01] Mary it was
[42:03] God building a
[42:06] house building a body that he might
[42:10] occupy it live within it this was a
[42:14] great
[42:16] statement when when when Jesus was at
[42:19] the
[42:21] Jordan being baptized by
[42:24] John and the spirit of the Lord
[42:29] descended mind you everybody didn't see
[42:31] the
[42:33] spirit everybody didn't see the
[42:36] dove the only person who saw the dove
[42:38] was Jesus and
[42:40] John Hallelujah and the Bible said the
[42:43] Holy Spirit descended like a
[42:46] dove and sat upon him and then there was
[42:50] a voice saying this is my beloved
[42:54] Son in whom I'm well pleased Towell
[42:59] now it looks it looks like
[43:03] two the father or three to some people
[43:07] the do and the son Hallelujah but you
[43:11] got to
[43:13] realize the dove was there for John as a
[43:17] sign
[43:18] Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying
[43:22] and then the voice in
[43:24] itself was the same voice
[43:27] amen that said on mou
[43:30] Transfiguration
[43:32] Hallelujah Jesus only hear ye
[43:35] him so when you see these
[43:39] things you say how can it
[43:44] be God can do whatever he wants to
[43:48] do but I know people use that to say
[43:50] well it's
[43:53] Trinity or two or two some people
[43:56] believe two
[43:58] was in John St John
[44:02] 10:30 Jesus said my father and I we are
[44:07] one figure that one
[44:10] out the point
[44:12] is Jesus was the house of
[44:17] God but God was the one dwelling in the
[44:21] house hallelujah hallelujah yall
[44:24] understand me I live at 292 12 Southwest
[44:27] White birs
[44:29] Drive 21 12 Southwest White birs

[44:37] that's the house I live
[44:39] in but the house is not
[44:42] me hallelujah hallelujah I live in this
[44:47] house but this house is not me oh come
[44:51] on somebody all you got to do is close
[44:53] your eyes and you'll be able to see you

[45:00] spirit Hallelujah and you live within
[45:04] this
[45:05] house how many of y'all view viewed
[45:08] brother
[45:09] Keith you can see that he was not at

[45:16] his
[45:17] house to live in another
[45:20] house that we call
[45:23] Theon Hallelujah that's why Paul said if
[45:27] this Earthly Tabernacle be
[45:29] designed I have a building I've got
[45:32] another house that I'm going
[45:35] to Hallelujah Hallelujah like the
[45:38] prophet of God said you've never seen
[45:41] me Hallelujah you've seen my house but
[45:46] you never seen me Hallelujah I've never
[45:49] seen you but I've seen your house and I
[45:53] know who lives there Hallelujah glory to
[45:57] God is that all right this go should be
[46:01] he should be called The Son of God
[46:04] Isaiah
[46:06] 96 is
[46:07] important because we must know what
[46:10] we're
[46:12] becoming the Bible said we are new
[46:17] creation and that's exactly what it
[46:19] means it is a new
[46:22] [Applause]
[46:24] creation going where's the new creation
[46:29] in the inside of this damnable
[46:33] flesh y'all hear
[46:35] what what's happening on the inside of
[46:38] me has nothing to do with this
[46:41] thing you understand me because God has
[46:46] given me a
[46:49] rebirth the old
[46:51] man the world knew about
[46:54] him but the new man
[46:58] they know nothing
[46:59] about but the new man is born after the
[47:05] Creator flesh of his flesh bone of his
[47:09] bone y y'all hear what I'm
[47:11] saying I'm talk telling you now
[47:16] Jesus is the name of the almighty
[47:19] [Music]
[47:22] God Isaiah
[47:25] 96 For unto us

[47:41] Called
[47:42] wonderful counselor the Mighty God the
[47:46] Everlasting father the Prince of
[47:49] Peace hallelujah hallelujah but his name
[47:52] shall be
[47:54] called but his real his full name
[47:57] is there's a difference between being
[48:00] called
[48:02] something and actually the name
[48:07] is my children can call me
[48:11] Daddy but my name is Isaiah
[48:14] Brooks Hallelujah we call him
[48:17] wonderful but his name is Jesus
[48:20] Christ we call him our
[48:22] counselor but his name is Jesus Christ
[48:26] we call call him the Mighty God but his
[48:29] name is Jesus Christ hello we call him
[48:32] the Everlasting
[48:34] father but his name is Jesus Christ we
[48:38] call him the Prince of Peace but his
[48:41] name is Jesus Christ y'all hear what I'm
[48:44] saying so when he said go ye
[48:47] therefore into all nations and baptize
[48:51] him in the name of the father and of the
[48:54] son and of the Holy Ghost what's God's
[49:00] name don't be afraid to say
[49:02] it because I look every when they said
[49:06] name everybody thought that he was
[49:08] saying the name was father and the name
[49:11] was son and the name was Holy Ghost the
[49:16] name that represents the Father the Son
[49:20] and the Holy
[49:22] Ghost hallelujah hallelujah and that
[49:24] name is Lord is the father Jesus who is
[49:30] the son Holy
[49:32] Ghost who is the spirit in the name of
[49:35] the father Son and Holy
[49:39] Ghost well y'all getting
[49:41] quiet St John

[49:48] through3 I'm trying to get through this
[49:50] cuz I'm not even where I want to
[49:53] [Music]
[49:54] be 10th verse he was in the
[49:58] world and the world was made by
[50:01] him and the world knew him
[50:04] not when was God in the
[50:09] world
[50:11] Amen he's always been here but when was
[50:15] he fully
[50:18] recognized through Jesus
[50:20] Christ he came into his
[50:23] own his own received and not who this it
[50:28] was Jesus who went to the Jews and the
[50:31] Jews rejected him he came unto his
[50:34] own and his own received a not I thought
[50:38] God created the world the Bible said he
[50:42] was in the world and the world was made
[50:45] by him and the world knew him not so if
[50:48] Jesus Christ created the world then
[50:52] where is the other
[50:54] God hallelujah hallelujah but as
[50:57] many has received him to them gave he
[51:01] the power to become the sons of
[51:06] God Jesus said after which the Holy
[51:09] Ghost has come upon you you shall
[51:12] receive
[51:13] power and the prophet of God said that
[51:16] power is
[51:17] Authority Hallelujah he told Nicodemus
[51:21] you must be born again not of the water
[51:24] but of the spirit
[51:26] which is flesh is flesh and that which
[51:29] is spirit is Spirit hallelujah oh wait a
[51:33] minute you say what are you saying
[51:35] brother Brooks this is the part I
[51:38] like Hallelujah he said even to them
[51:41] that believe on his
[51:43] name which were born not of blood not of
[51:47] the will of the flesh nor of the will of
[51:50] man but of God hey what are you saying
[51:55] even as Jesus
[51:57] God's Will made it
[52:00] happen when you receive the Holy Ghost
[52:04] it's not because you pleaded all night
[52:07] or you begged him all night no no no no
[52:10] no because in his mind before the
[52:14] foundation of the world not only did he
[52:17] justifi you he Sanctified you he called
[52:21] you he knew your name and he knew at the
[52:24] very moment he was going to give you the
[52:27] Holy Ghost Hallelujah but think about it
[52:32] you would have never been able to
[52:34] receive the Holy Ghost if it had not
[52:38] been for
[52:39] Calvary Hallelujah and whether people
[52:42] want to believe it or not the Holy Ghost

[1:02:26] let the word of Christ dwell in you
[1:02:28] richly and all
[1:02:31] wisd teaching and admonishing one
[1:02:33] another in Psalms and
[1:02:39] hymns in spiritual songs singing with
[1:02:42] Grace in your hearts toward the lord
[1:02:45] toward the lord toward the
[1:02:49] lord and whatsoever you do in word or
[1:02:52] deed do all In The Name Of The Lord Lord
[1:02:57] Jesus giving thanks to God and the
[1:03:00] father by him what are you saying you
[1:03:04] recognize who he is he is the god he is
[1:03:08] the father but his name is the Lord
[1:03:11] Jesus Christ so when you recognize
[1:03:14] Father Son and Holy Ghost you're
[1:03:17] recognizing Jesus the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:20] how you want to say it but when you say
[1:03:23] the Lord let me tell you something
[1:03:25] that's why the devil don't mind if you
[1:03:26] say
[1:03:29] God Satan don't get upset when you say
[1:03:31] God is
[1:03:32] good but when you start calling on the
[1:03:35] name of Jesus when you mention that name
[1:03:40] it shake hell up Hallelujah you better
[1:03:43] hear what I'm saying at the name of
[1:03:46] Jesus Christ the Bible said that the
[1:03:49] demons
[1:03:51] tremble like like I heard that brother
[1:03:53] say the other day when you are
[1:03:56] sick and you don't know what else to do
[1:04:00] you need to give God a good praise call
[1:04:03] on the name of Jesus at the name of Jes
[1:04:07] you you just need a good worship service
[1:04:10] because the Holy Spirit God inhabits the
[1:04:15] praise of his people if you just give
[1:04:18] the devil trembles at the name he don't
[1:04:21] want you to worship God but when you
[1:04:24] worship God call on the name of
[1:04:27] Jesus
[1:04:29] Hallelujah something has to
[1:04:32] happen
[1:04:34] Hallelujah yes sir Philippians
[1:04:38] 2 9
[1:04:41] through1 glory to God wherefore
[1:04:45] God also have highly exalted
[1:04:49] [Music]
[1:04:51] him and giving him a name which is above
[1:04:53] every name
[1:04:56] that at the name of
[1:04:57] Jesus every knee shall
[1:05:00] bow of things in heaven of things in
[1:05:03] Earth and things on the earth Hallelujah
[1:05:08] and that every tongue should confess
[1:05:10] that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory
[1:05:14] of God the Father what are you talking
[1:05:17] about even the Devil
[1:05:19] Himself has to confess that Jesus is the
[1:05:24] Lord you say Pro that to me when Jesus
[1:05:28] was crossing over the
[1:05:30] river
[1:05:32] Hallelujah uh
[1:05:35] gathering over
[1:05:38] Gathering amen but anyhow the man who
[1:05:42] had a thousand
[1:05:45] demons
[1:05:47] Hallelujah he said what what did you why
[1:05:50] did you come here
[1:05:53] Jesus have you come to to torment us
[1:05:56] before our
[1:05:58] time the Lord hadn't even opened his
[1:06:02] mouth Hallelujah but one thing about

[1:06:46] when you got the Holy
[1:06:48] Ghost the devil got

[1:06:55] the Holy Ghost you better know what
[1:06:58] you're
[1:06:59] doing Hallelujah because those Devils

[1:08:30] verse fourth chapter excuse
[1:08:32] me and as they spake unto the
[1:08:38] people the priest and the captains of
[1:08:40] the
[1:08:41] temple and the Sadducees Came Upon
[1:08:45] them being grieved that they taught the
[1:08:49] people and preach through Jesus the
[1:08:51] resurrection from the
[1:08:54] dead did you hear he said here they were
[1:08:57] preaching
[1:08:59] Jesus teaching teaching the
[1:09:02] people and preach through
[1:09:06] Jesus you understand what was happening
[1:09:09] they were telling about Jesus
[1:09:13] resurrection Hallelujah and that through
[1:09:16] that
[1:09:18] Resurrection all hell was
[1:09:21] conquered Hallelujah and though you be
[1:09:24] dead
[1:09:26] yet shall you live see they didn't want
[1:09:29] to hear that the Pharisees wanted their
[1:09:32] laws and their rules and their
[1:09:34] regulations but here with these people
[1:09:37] preaching the resurrection let me tell
[1:09:39] you something you can't even preach the
[1:09:41] gospel without preaching the
[1:09:45] resurrection hallelujah hallelujah and
[1:09:47] brother brand said that's the greatest
[1:09:49] message you can preach is the gospel
[1:09:55] amen cuz until you born again you don't
[1:09:58] even understand what he's saying
[1:10:00] any Hallelujah
[1:10:03] surely the disciples remember I'm surely
[1:10:08] the disciples remember what Jesus
[1:10:10] preached at the tomb of
[1:10:13] Lazarus I am the
[1:10:15] resurrection and I am the life
[1:10:19] Hallelujah come on if he's the
[1:10:21] resurrection and the
[1:10:23] life how many lives is there there's
[1:10:26] only one life and that life is eternal
[1:10:29] life and that life is God's
[1:10:32] life hallelujah hallelujah and they laid
[1:10:35] hands on them and put them in hold until
[1:10:39] the next
[1:10:40] day for it was now even
[1:10:43] time how be it many of them which heard
[1:10:48] the word
[1:10:50] believed and the number of men was about
[1:10:54] 5,000
[1:10:57] and it came to pass on
[1:10:59] tomorrow that their rulers and elders
[1:11:01] and
[1:11:03] scribes and Anna the high
[1:11:06] priest and caias and
[1:11:08] John and
[1:11:11] Alexander as many as were of the Kindred
[1:11:13] of the high
[1:11:15] priest were gathered together at
[1:11:20] Jerusalem and when they had had set them
[1:11:23] in the midst
[1:11:26] they asked by what
[1:11:29] power or by what
[1:11:32] name have you done
[1:11:35] this Hallelujah and then Peter filled
[1:11:39] with the Holy Ghost said unto them ye
[1:11:43] rulers of the people and Elders of
[1:11:46] Israel if we this day be examon of the
[1:11:50] good deed done to the impotent man
[1:11:56] by what mean he is made
[1:12:02] whole be it known unto you
[1:12:05] all and to all the people of
[1:12:08] Israel that by the
[1:12:10] name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom
[1:12:14] you crucified who God raised from the
[1:12:17] dead even by him does this man stand
[1:12:22] here before you whole hallel
[1:12:26] no other
[1:12:27] way
[1:12:29] Hallelujah no other way this is the
[1:12:34] stone which was set at not of the
[1:12:40] builders which has become the head of
[1:12:42] the
[1:12:43] corner Hallelujah here it is neither is
[1:12:48] there salvation in any
[1:12:50] other oh hallelujah hallelujah for there
[1:12:53] is no other name
[1:12:56] under Heaven given among
[1:12:58] men whereby we must be saved Hallelujah
[1:13:03] is that all right now when they saw the
[1:13:06] boldness of Peter and
[1:13:08] John and perceived that they were
[1:13:11] unlearned and
[1:13:14] men they
[1:13:16] marveled and they took knowledge of them
[1:13:20] that they have been with who
[1:13:23] Jesus and beholding a
[1:13:27] man which was
[1:13:29] healed standing with
[1:13:32] them they they could say nothing against
[1:13:35] it now I'm saying all of this is because
[1:13:40] once the
[1:13:42] revelation of who the the Christians
[1:13:45] when they received their
[1:13:47] revelation of who they
[1:13:50] were they never backed
[1:13:53] up they never backed
[1:13:56] where the Christians fall
[1:13:59] today is because we remember what we
[1:14:02] used to
[1:14:04] be and every time you turn
[1:14:08] back looking at what you used to
[1:14:12] be you lost your
[1:14:15] Authority you lost your
[1:14:18] power hallelujah hallelujah and you need
[1:14:21] to be
[1:14:23] repenting and asking to restore back to
[1:14:27] you who you really are now I got a quote
[1:14:31] for it so I hold on cuz I'm
[1:14:34] coming and behold the
[1:14:37] man see I want to see
[1:14:41] God and we don't see him because we're
[1:14:43] still
[1:14:45] fighting with our
[1:14:50] identity hallelujah hallelujah if God is
[1:14:53] in you
[1:14:55] what you worried
[1:14:57] about it's not you that does do the
[1:15:01] works it's Christ in you that's doing
[1:15:03] the
[1:15:04] work but he needs you to remember who he
[1:15:08] is he's the almighty
[1:15:11] God hallelujah he's all
[1:15:15] powerful in you that's why he said ask
[1:15:19] anything in my name and believe
[1:15:22] it hallelujah hallelujah hear what I'm
[1:15:26] saying when we fail to realize who we
[1:15:30] are we forget our position in
[1:15:34] Christ Hallelujah when God has given us
[1:15:37] the
[1:15:39] authority but the devil is always there
[1:15:41] accusing you oh I got a word for you
[1:15:45] tonight he's always there accusing you
[1:15:49] but the devil is a
[1:15:51] liar you cannot be a sinner and a Sint
[1:15:55] at the same time you choose this
[1:15:59] day which you going to be are you going
[1:16:02] to be a sinner or you're going to be a
[1:16:05] saint and if you're going to be a saint
[1:16:08] you need to know what makes you a
[1:16:13] saint hallelujah hallelujah you need to
[1:16:16] know what makes you a
[1:16:17] saint it ain't your good
[1:16:20] works oh I didn't do wrong today that
[1:16:23] don't make you a samee
[1:16:27] Hallelujah Jesus Paid the
[1:16:30] price that's what makes you a
[1:16:32] saint That's What Makes You
[1:16:36] holy hallelujah hallelujah that's where
[1:16:38] the devil catches
[1:16:40] us we don't we don't deserve the

[1:17:21] invincible don't worry about the flesh
[1:17:24] the flesh is going to always be the
[1:17:27] flesh until God makes your
[1:17:30] change but God has promised you the

[1:17:36] to be let the inner man rule the outer
