[29:56] stand it goes with the message in Christ
[29:59] alone thank God for His grace thinking
[30:03] for His mercy
[30:05] amen
[30:09] what would we do without the Lord Jesus
[30:12] Christ as we turn to the scripture we're
[30:24] going to come from st. John 8 we're
[30:30] going to read 42 42 to 47 verses then
[30:37] we'll go to 1st John 2 ready to have our
[30:42] sister grace with us and then we'll have
[30:48] we'll go from Psalms to German we're
[30:50] gonna read a couple of scriptures so I
[30:52] hope you don't mind your standing a
[30:54] while we're getting at the 42nd verse
[30:57] jesus said unto them if God we're your
[31:00] father you would love me for I proceeded
[31:05] forth and came from God neither came I
[31:09] of myself but he sent me why do you not
[31:15] understand my speech because you cannot
[31:19] hear my word you're not of your for ye
[31:24] are of your father the devil and the
[31:27] lusts of your father ye will do he was a
[31:31] murderer from the beginning and abode
[31:34] not in the truth because there is no
[31:37] truth in him when he speaketh a lie he
[31:40] speaketh of his own for he is a liar and
[31:44] the father of it and because I tell you
[31:48] the truth he believe me not which of you
[31:51] convinced me of sin and if I say the
[31:55] truth why do you not believe me he that
[31:59] is of God heareth God's words
[32:01] yeah therefore hear them not because ye
[32:05] are not of God first John to
[32:14] my little children beginning at the
[32:17] first verse these things write I unto
[32:20] you that ye sin not and if any man sin
[32:26] we have an advocate with the father
[32:28] Jesus Christ the righteous
[32:32] two more scriptures Psalms 139 23 search
[32:44] me O God and know my heart try me and
[32:50] know my thoughts and see if there be any
[32:54] wicked way in me and lead me in the way
[32:59] of everlasting Jeremiah 29:13 and ye
[33:15] shall seek me and find me when you shall
[33:19] search for me with all your heart and I
[33:25] will be found of you saith the Lord
[33:29] let us pray father we thank you for your
[33:33] amazing great we thank you for being so
[33:37] good to us Lord you are better to us
[33:40] than we are to ourselves Lord I prayed
[33:44] that this morning you will touch the
[33:47] hearts of all that needs to be touched
[33:51] Lord just don't allow us to feel sorry
[33:54] for our transgressions but give us godly
[33:59] repentance that we will turn from our
[34:03] wicked ways help us now O God keep us in
[34:08] your name Jesus and father we'll be
[34:11] careful to give you the praise the glory
[34:14] and honor and your lovely name Jesus
[34:18] Christ we pray amen
[34:20] you may be seated I like to entitle this
[34:24] message in Christ alone
[34:30] it is important that we understand where
[34:34] we are in Christ we know that Satan is
[34:39] the god of this evil age this age above
[34:43] all ages are the most deceptive so we
[34:48] can't just take our salvation for
[34:50] granted when we look through the Word of
[34:54] God we realize Amen it's not enough to
[34:58] follow our individual but you must
[35:03] follow the individual that's following
[35:06] God as Paul said follow me as I follow
[35:10] Christ we have been commissioned in this
[35:15] last day when the Lamb of God who is
[35:17] Jesus Christ
[35:19] took the book out of him who sat on the
[35:23] throne and he was the only one that
[35:26] could take the book he was the only one
[35:29] worthy Adam wasn't worthy Moses wasn't
[35:33] worthy Joshua was with him worthy none
[35:36] of the Apostles or prophets were worthy
[35:40] to take the book that book according to
[35:43] brother Branham was the book of
[35:44] redemption Adam would have redeemed his
[35:49] wife if he could have the first Adam but
[35:52] because he became sin himself he had not
[35:56] the ability to redeem his wife but we
[36:01] find out by God's grace that second Adam
[36:04] who was Jesus Christ because he was
[36:07] perfect in all of his ways and he obeyed
[36:09] the full Word was able to redeem us not
[36:16] just all us but all that was lost in the
[36:21] fall he redeemed heaven he redeemed
[36:24] earth he redeemed every fallen soul he
[36:31] gave everybody privilege to be a part of
[36:35] this Redemption brother branham said it
[36:39] like this he said
[36:40] a party is not a party except it be
[36:44] received as a pardon you and I realize
[36:49] that there are two seeds we understand
[36:53] that there are the children of God and
[36:55] there are the children of the devil a
[37:00] child of the devil could never be a
[37:02] child of God except the seed of God
[37:07] being understand we all at one point in
[37:11] time were like the children of Wrath do
[37:13] y'all know what that means
[37:16] predestinated to be to experience the
[37:20] wrath of God as Jesus said unto the
[37:25] Pharisees what's going to cause you to
[37:28] repent in other words he understood
[37:32] there was nothing in them that could
[37:35] cause them to repent and you and I ought
[37:39] to be so grateful that we can truly
[37:44] repent you find out in the Bible
[37:48] no we're never son of the devil fully
[37:54] repented even when Jesus Judas betrayed
[37:58] Christ he felt sorry that was a
[38:01] repentance but he did not feel
[38:04] completely repented because the
[38:08] repentance that he had it going to God
[38:11] from God it was directed him to the
[38:14] right priests true repentance takes you
[38:18] to the person in which you have offended
[38:21] hello that's why the Bible said if you
[38:25] have an art against your brother of your
[38:26] brother finding you you go to your
[38:28] brother not to your neighbor so we
[38:31] realized by the grace of God amen those
[38:34] of us who have been born in this old
[38:37] flesh this old body cannot be be saved
[38:43] if I want to say it like that in the way
[38:47] that it is it has a day of redemption
[38:50] when God will change
[38:54] because of the way it is made it can
[38:57] never meet heaven standards but God has
[39:02] come along and he's quickened something
[39:04] on the inside of us
[39:05] you know everybody said well God is love
[39:08] you know the whole world says it and
[39:11] they fail to leave out the part that God
[39:14] is a consuming fire God is a judge God
[39:21] is jealous you and I ought to be so
[39:27] happy because the Bible tells us that
[39:30] Jesus Christ is our advocate that is
[39:36] someone who would speak on your behalf
[39:39] in favor of you it is a person who
[39:47] speaks or writes something in support of
[39:51] a defense that's why the Bible said when
[39:56] we don't know how to pray the Holy
[40:01] Spirit on the inside of us will pray for
[40:05] us now you and I must understand that
[40:10] Jesus Christ came to save all that was
[40:14] in him not outside in him there's only
[40:22] one way to be in Christ that is you must
[40:27] be born again brother Branham said well
[40:31] in what is the Holy Ghost
[40:32] he said don't care how long it takes in
[40:36] other words we'll stay until we eat up
[40:39] your heart Wow because you'll never pull
[40:43] it in an unclean heart see it doesn't
[40:46] matter if you shake and quake jump and
[40:48] shout cry all night long if your heart
[40:52] is filthy God could never fill you with
[40:57] this Holy Ghost God will not dwell in an
[41:01] unclean vessel hello
[41:03] it doesn't mean that you're not
[41:06] justified
[41:09] but justification will not meet the
[41:11] criteria of this day because God is not
[41:17] looking for Bane's he's looking for a
[41:20] full matured woman a church that's ready
[41:26] to be wedded a church that is willing
[41:30] and ready to be his bride you understand
[41:34] me
[41:34] no wonder David said search me O God and
[41:39] know my heart see you and I we don't
[41:42] know it but God knows it and the Bible
[41:45] said that heart is wicked is the sea for
[41:47] and only God knows how to be sea full it
[41:51] is and can't be your own heart will
[41:54] deceive you if God is not there to help
[41:59] and you must clean it up you cannot walk
[42:04] in a in a in a filthy way and expect for
[42:07] God and men to fill you why because you
[42:10] must be sanctified well I know the
[42:14] message well those who knew the message
[42:16] in Moses day went through justification
[42:19] and they were in the wilderness going
[42:20] through sanctification many of them
[42:22] didn't even make it why because they
[42:25] were much as long as you murmur your
[42:28] heart is not clean as clean as God wants
[42:32] but because you have been created to be
[42:35] the Amen to every word that's in the
[42:39] book is that all right I'm talking about
[42:43] bride I'm not talking about church
[42:45] that's the difference between us in the
[42:47] church the church is the cage of every
[42:49] unclean and hateful bird the bride is
[42:53] liberated she flies and she elevates
[42:57] she's elevated by the Word of God she is
[42:59] now sitting in heavenly places in Christ
[43:02] Jesus yet and still we have these
[43:05] difficult times in our French and
[43:08] because we do we have an advocate
[43:13] hallelujah
[43:15] you said Brotherhood's will I make it
[43:16] only those whose names are
[43:19] written in the Lamb's Book of Life oh
[43:22] brother books will not reach perfection
[43:24] those who are names are written in the
[43:27] Lamb's Book of Life because that's the
[43:33] age those who win justification age met
[43:38] their criteria those who are in the
[43:40] sanctification age met their criteria so
[43:43] how can we say we're in the bride age
[43:45] and we have not even come through
[43:47] sanctification hey somebody you and I
[43:51] have got to get more serious about this
[43:54] Bible in our lives hello
[43:58] then the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[44:01] brother Branham said that's just the
[44:02] beginning you're gonna be you're just
[44:09] starting and you and I must understand
[44:12] amen that there is a journey is this
[44:20] okay I'm gonna take my time the Bible
[44:24] tells us accordingly in Jeremiah if we
[44:27] seek the Lord with all our hearts we
[44:35] will be found of him and he will find us
[44:39] thank God for the God that has that
[44:43] quickening power that can go beyond your
[44:47] flesh that can go beyond your spirit
[44:49] that can go right into the soul and
[44:52] quicken that predestinated seed to you
[44:57] and I must understand that there was a
[44:59] quickening power that literally
[45:02] quickened the foolish virgins hello yeah
[45:06] they were alive but they never made it
[45:10] to maturity they made it to
[45:12] sanctification but they never made it to
[45:16] maturity i'ma say it again at least the
[45:20] foolish virgins were sanctified is that
[45:26] the truth
[45:27] it is and you have a quickened who were
[45:30] dead in trespasses wherein in time past
[45:33] we walked according to the course of
[45:35] this world we did it according to the
[45:37] Prince of the power of the air yes sir
[45:40] the spirit that now worketh in the
[45:42] children of disobedience aha come on
[45:46] somebody that this spirit this worldly
[45:49] spirit because I'm gonna tell you
[45:50] something you're gonna have one or the
[45:52] other you're gonna have one the spirit
[45:54] of the world or you will have this
[45:56] period on the Otherworld
[45:59] right you're gonna have the spirit of
[46:02] the underworld are you gonna have the
[46:04] spirit of the upper world you either
[46:08] came from Satan or you came from God
[46:11] hello is this serious or not how do you
[46:20] know what you're doing where are you
[46:22] because brother Branham said what are
[46:24] you whatever you're doing now here
[46:25] that's what you're doing there he just
[46:27] said there because there could be here
[46:29] or there among whom also we all had our
[46:36] conversation in time past where in the
[46:39] lusts of our flesh fulfilling the
[46:41] desires of the flesh and of the mind and
[46:44] we're by nature whoa by nature if you
[46:50] still fulfilling the lust of the flesh
[46:52] fulfilling the desires of your mind by
[46:55] nature the children of Wrath even as
[46:57] others hello that means you're not
[47:01] you're not you haven't gotten anywhere
[47:06] I'm trying to save folks this morning
[47:10] because we just believe because we
[47:12] haven't seen the message and we've heard
[47:14] the message amen in is we've made it but
[47:17] there is a process that you and I must
[47:21] go through to complete this journey
[47:24] that's why the Bible says they'd better
[47:27] before us cannot be complete without us
[47:30] we are the children of the capstone and
[47:35] you and I must come come through perfect
[47:38] love and this is what the Prophet God
[47:39] said this is
[47:40] one of the this is the third pool that
[47:43] cannot be mimicked you can't act like
[47:47] you got it it's got to be real mmm see
[47:54] it's not a not to to Paul said it I'm
[47:57] gonna say it like he said it you can
[47:59] understand all mysteries and have not
[48:02] charity which is a headstone capstone it
[48:05] profits you nothing
[48:07] what does he mean by that your worship
[48:09] is in vain your religious in vain is
[48:12] that right hallelujah Paul said we ought
[48:16] to run this race with patience we are
[48:20] encompassed about with a greater cloud
[48:22] of witness in other words we have a
[48:24] people that have gone before us and they
[48:27] can they can say to us it's possible it
[48:31] can be done you know I love what brother
[48:37] Hodges say well we sometimes make it so
[48:39] complicated and it's not complicated no
[48:42] more than a child being born or
[48:44] conceived as long as that egg or that
[48:48] seed is quickened life is gonna form the
[48:51] child but a lot of time we won't let
[48:55] that you know I'm saying we're not some
[48:58] of us may not be quickened yet though we
[49:01] know the truth though we know it's right
[49:03] but we haven't gotten to the place where
[49:06] we've had an intimate relationship with
[49:09] Jesus Christ hallelujah when you and I
[49:16] are birth into this thing and you and I
[49:19] must be birthed into the message or I
[49:21] came into the left you must be born in
[49:24] this message and I don't mean going in a
[49:27] family that's been in a message
[49:29] I mean born in the soul you said brother
[49:34] books what are you saying being a pastor
[49:36] I have seen a lot of things happen to
[49:39] people under the umbrella of the message
[49:43] and I have seen them jump I have seen
[49:47] them shout I have seen them in various
[49:50] ways and then they come around and aid
[49:53] doing some weekly thing there are
[49:56] certain things God will not allow you to
[49:58] do once you truly born again when you
[50:04] truly born again God is not gonna allow
[50:06] you to commit fornication he's not gonna
[50:08] allow you to commit adultery he's not
[50:10] gonna allow these things to happen to
[50:12] you oh he said grieve not for the Holy
[50:16] Spirit and he also said don't you try to
[50:18] break that seal you endanger your soul
[50:23] when you go that far because the sin
[50:25] that you do you know sinning not only
[50:28] against God but your sinning against
[50:30] your body whoo hallelujah anyhow yeah
[50:37] you're not gonna get no preaching like
[50:38] that but here cuz I'm concerned it ain't
[50:43] enough to jump in shop because God sent
[50:45] a prophet I'd do that to the people of
[50:48] God millions died knowing Moses was a
[50:50] prophet and I'm gonna keep reminding us
[50:54] you say well that's all he talks about
[50:56] until we see the power of God in his
[50:59] place where the brendham said whatever
[51:01] soul sees you so that's the harvest you
[51:04] gonna reap I'm trying to plant seeds so
[51:08] God can come in one day and quicken all
[51:10] of us amen and the fog are to come down
[51:12] in this place in the the fire department
[51:15] or come around this building thinking
[51:16] its own fire
[51:18] that's what I'm talking about you say it
[51:21] can't happen is happening in in
[51:23] California and I'm not talking about
[51:24] Azusa Street I'm talking about a company
[51:27] some years ago amen a group of people
[51:29] was praising God only it happened twice
[51:33] to be to be sure to make you assure of
[51:37] it and I've got some witnesses still
[51:39] living who was there when the fire
[51:41] department came thinking that the
[51:43] building was on fire
[51:46] young people that God Amen save to the
[51:51] uttermost people who were in gangs right
[51:55] some of the women still walk like men it
[52:02] tried you know what I mean you know God
[52:03] it takes time to get get all of that out
[52:06] of here
[52:07] yay but yeah and still they are witness
[52:11] out that Holy Ghost he's the same
[52:14] yesterday today and forever see we are
[52:17] born in this world amen natural beings
[52:20] created in the in the in the bad image
[52:23] in an image of a falsehood if I can say
[52:26] it like that don't we be you know a sons
[52:29] in God sons and daughters of God we were
[52:32] born children a raft we had the
[52:34] appearance you know we look like
[52:37] serpents we act like serpents we did
[52:39] everything the Serpent's did we lie we
[52:42] still we cheated we did everything
[52:43] serpents did a would do but only inside
[52:47] of you was a real seed gene of God
[52:51] that's all God is interested in right
[52:55] he's only interested in that seed in you
[52:58] that he can quicken and bring to life to
[53:02] be formed and shaped in his image is
[53:09] that right listen
[53:11] but remember Satan was what was the Holy
[53:14] Ghost given for he said but you got the
[53:16] nature of the place your form from
[53:19] you've got the nature of the place
[53:22] you're from that's what I'm trying to
[53:24] say a roman comes over here he scratches
[53:28] his head a german comes over here an
[53:30] american comes over there goes over
[53:32] there why you've got the spirit of them
[53:34] countries you come from that's what make
[53:38] us so different to the world you from
[53:40] above
[53:41] you are born you're a citizen of another
[53:45] kingdom you believe it that's what the
[53:48] Holy Ghost is is to make you a citizen
[53:51] of the kingdom of God if you are citizen
[53:55] of the kingdom of God how does it make
[53:57] you act like God does in his kingdom now
[54:02] what does God do in his kingdom
[54:04] it's holiness righteousness purity of
[54:07] thought purity of mind power love going
[54:13] to be the lost right going to the loss
[54:15] healing the sick performing miracles
[54:17] going doing great things they
[54:20] to the world you look crazy and they say
[54:22] them guys are off at their heads but you
[54:25] are a citizen of the kingdom that right
[54:29] one more scripture you want to write it
[54:32] down John 12:24 let me quote it if a
[54:35] corner we falls into the ground except
[54:37] it died it cannot break forth another
[54:40] life and that's what Jesus did he died
[54:44] so he can bring forth another life and
[54:47] you must die you must die in order to
[54:52] bring forth this life of Christ I'm not
[54:56] saying that safe but we're working with
[54:58] rapture material hallelujah we want to
[55:02] be changed and raptured amen when Christ
[55:05] come and thought people were not so far
[55:08] from that day
[55:10] that's why brother Barron said escape
[55:13] here the quickly that's back then how
[55:16] urgent it must be now since that timing
[55:23] right one thing for certain when it's
[55:32] all over you as individuals will have to
[55:36] face God face to face this message will
[55:41] either bless you this morning or condemn
[55:44] you this morning hallelujah but to us
[55:50] there is but one God the Father of whom
[55:54] are all things and we in him and one
[55:59] Lord Jesus Christ by whom are all things
[56:02] and we by him the Holy Spirit said
[56:05] that's that's what it is we hear the
[56:08] things that we have jet we're justified
[56:10] as though we've never seen it before and
[56:11] God didn't clear the record folks that's
[56:14] to the people who's got the Holy Ghost
[56:17] that doesn't apply you you're reading
[56:20] somebody else's letter that's to the
[56:23] person who has the Holy Ghost because at
[56:28] that point the Holy Ghost is justified
[56:30] you he sanctified you and he's brown
[56:32] match
[56:33] out of your life and now he's living in
[56:35] the place that he built you for there's
[56:41] one body and one spirit even as ye are
[56:43] called into one hope of your calling one
[56:46] Lord one faith one baptism is that right
[56:50] so the water doesn't save you
[56:52] it's a baptism you must do it because he
[56:56] commanded but that's not the thing that
[56:58] save you the thing that saves you is
[57:00] when you're born again of the Spirit up
[57:04] to the new potential by one spirit are
[57:09] we baptized in to his body the word is
[57:13] in in him in in that's the word
[57:17] we're baptized in to him right did not
[57:24] Christ come amen - to save and to gather
[57:28] all all together those in heaven those
[57:33] in earth in him no not those only
[57:36] outside in him those who are in him
[57:41] those who are a part of his body those
[57:44] who have been baptized and filled with
[57:47] the Holy Ghost those who are spiritual
[57:50] and spiritually minded one God and
[57:55] Father of all who is above all and
[57:57] through all and we're in you all in
[58:00] Christ alone
[58:03] right but into every one of us is given
[58:06] grace according to the measure of the
[58:08] gift of Christ because we're in him we
[58:12] still have measures of faith in him is
[58:14] that all right
[58:15] Ephesians 1 I'm a hurry-up 3 through 7
[58:18] blessed be the God and father of our
[58:20] Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us
[58:21] with spiritual blessings in heavenly
[58:23] places in Christ not out but in right
[58:28] according as he have chosen us in him
[58:31] before the foundation of the world that
[58:34] we should be holy and without blame
[58:37] before him in love hallelujah and how
[58:41] can you be blameless unless you have his
[58:45] love in you
[58:46] right his love makes you bearing this
[58:50] hallelujah we are accepted in the
[58:53] beloved in him and that's the Holy Ghost
[58:57] people hallelujah
[59:02] having predestinated us unto the
[59:05] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[59:08] himself according to the good pleasure
[59:10] of his will to the praise of the glory
[59:14] of His grace where he have made us
[59:16] accepted in the beloved in whom we have
[59:20] redemption through his blood the
[59:22] forgiveness of sins according to the
[59:25] riches of his glory grace you understand
[59:28] me so we realized by God's grace we we
[59:32] are in him is only in him that we'll
[59:35] take a flight like I said to the church
[59:39] down in IO city my God is like a magnet
[59:42] if that magnet piece is not only inside
[59:45] of you when he began to pull up you will
[59:48] not go anywhere even if you've got a
[59:51] piece of him in there if you bolt it
[59:53] down by some denomination or some
[59:55] organization or some ideology Amen it
[59:59] will not work because he that the Sun
[1:00:02] set free is free indeed then where the
[1:00:05] Spirit of the Lord is there's Liberty my
[1:00:09] thing is with too relaxed but too
[1:00:14] relaxed
[1:00:15] what will it relax it like a Bible says
[1:00:18] they're taking e is e is an ease over
[1:00:21] there in Zion that ease
[1:00:25] hallelujah hey man but you and I must
[1:00:29] understand if that spirit attack the
[1:00:32] early church if that spirit of tecna's
[1:00:34] Israel it will attack you oh you got it
[1:00:38] made
[1:00:39] oh we can rest only when we're baptized
[1:00:43] into him because this is the rest
[1:00:47] that's your Sabbath when you have
[1:00:49] finished the course
[1:00:51] amen coming to that place where you know
[1:00:54] that you know that you know that you
[1:00:55] know Amen that Christ is in you
[1:01:00] is that right and what is the whole
[1:01:02] purpose see we have seen these things
[1:01:04] we've seen God move in justification
[1:01:07] we've seen him move Luther and Westley
[1:01:09] we've seen a movement of God
[1:01:10] historically you know even even in the
[1:01:12] West Western are the Wesley's our
[1:01:16] revival they had miracles and science of
[1:01:19] miracles and sign is not something that
[1:01:21] just started in the church and it
[1:01:23] doesn't declare that you're saved you
[1:01:25] can prophesy still be lost right because
[1:01:29] I'm a preacher doesn't make I make me
[1:01:31] saved hallelujah you now understand we
[1:01:35] are saved by grace don't you understand
[1:01:37] my point is what we need to do is enjoy
[1:01:41] this grace by showing God how much we
[1:01:43] appreciate his grace by seeking his face
[1:01:49] seek my face while seek his faith face
[1:01:52] while he may be found
[1:01:55] is that right now the Spirit of God has
[1:01:59] worked under justification on the Luther
[1:02:01] sanctification on the Wesley baptism of
[1:02:03] the Holy Ghost on the Pentecost and
[1:02:05] where it it in the last day performing
[1:02:09] and doing the very same things that it
[1:02:11] did when he was it it was in Christ what
[1:02:13] is it the church and Christ has become
[1:02:16] one so what do you say is it used to be
[1:02:19] two but now God is making the two line
[1:02:22] y'all understand me in other words the
[1:02:25] fullness of Christ that's what the seals
[1:02:27] were all about to show us amen that God
[1:02:30] has poured all of himself into his bride
[1:02:33] there used to be some in the church but
[1:02:36] guess what happened they locked him out
[1:02:38] they kicked him out now the whole
[1:02:41] fullness of what was in them who they
[1:02:43] were the shock y'all understand that and
[1:02:45] then now the fullness of Christ is in
[1:02:47] his bride that's not some cliche it's
[1:02:50] not something that we're just saying it
[1:02:52] must be a reality as soon as they
[1:02:57] connect together that last link and
[1:03:00] that's what brother let him call us he
[1:03:02] called us the last link she'll go
[1:03:05] through the sky shouting up will come
[1:03:08] Wesley Luther and all the rest of them
[1:03:11] back in those days he that were first
[1:03:14] would be less and he that's last will be
[1:03:16] first and there will come the
[1:03:17] resurrection hallelujah we're at the end
[1:03:21] time listen that's what the Holy Ghost
[1:03:23] does the Holy Ghost by justification
[1:03:26] sees just a light shadow of it the Holy
[1:03:29] Ghost by sanctification a little deeper
[1:03:31] shadow of it the Holy Ghost by the
[1:03:33] baptism of it a deeper shadow now the
[1:03:36] Holy Ghost by the resurrection of it
[1:03:38] it's person being in him here forming
[1:03:43] signs and wellness like he did at the
[1:03:46] beginning
[1:03:48] glory going to call me a holy role in
[1:03:51] how you might as well get started now
[1:03:54] what was he saying see what we
[1:03:56] understand is that what Jesus what
[1:03:58] brother man was doing he was showing us
[1:04:00] that Jesus Christ that was once dead
[1:04:03] throughout the church ages you
[1:04:04] understand me
[1:04:05] had a resurrection the resurrection like
[1:04:07] Lazarus on the third the fourth day here
[1:04:10] a hero's right right the fourth age was
[1:04:14] what justification lad was come for
[1:04:17] right he comes up right but then Luther
[1:04:21] say Wesley said you must be sanctified
[1:04:24] take those grave clothes off harlot is
[1:04:32] that right all right it didn't stop
[1:04:34] there they took the grave clothes off
[1:04:35] all the Lazarus got his breath back and
[1:04:38] everything else but what was the next
[1:04:40] scene he was sitting at the supper table
[1:04:42] eating with Jesus
[1:04:46] and they want to kill him all over again
[1:04:50] so you look at this thing you see that
[1:04:52] this thing is a real a real event that
[1:04:58] is happening right now and it's a secret
[1:05:01] to the world everybody didn't know where
[1:05:06] Jesus was born
[1:05:07] they don't even know he was on the earth
[1:05:11] except those who were praying and
[1:05:14] believing that the Messiah was to come
[1:05:17] in that season right so we look at this
[1:05:20] response says listen in this day God has
[1:05:24] given you an I in Christ alone he has
[1:05:27] given you and
[1:05:28] either very mystery of God that was
[1:05:32] hidden before the foundation of the
[1:05:34] world we said God is in Christ but
[1:05:39] Christ was in God right now he says
[1:05:42] Ephesians 1 9 having made known unto us
[1:05:45] the mystery obvious what will according
[1:05:49] to his good pleasure with he have
[1:05:51] purposed in himself what was God's
[1:05:53] mystery what was the will of God
[1:05:55] I'll tell you if you take Genesis and
[1:05:58] you go back to Genesis and and you find
[1:06:00] out that God tells Adam the first thing
[1:06:03] he tells Adam when Adam becomes a a
[1:06:07] living being he says be fruitful and
[1:06:10] multiply it was right then God showed
[1:06:15] the purpose of his wheel not just Adam
[1:06:21] being multiplied but God was to multiply
[1:06:25] himself because on the day of Pentecost
[1:06:29] he brought forth his first children with
[1:06:32] first was 120 baby multiply three
[1:06:36] thousand daily multiply five thousand so
[1:06:41] it was God a creation of himself that's
[1:06:48] what we're supposed to be and the only
[1:06:51] way that ever happened we must have a
[1:06:53] spirit in us now the secondary holy goes
[1:06:57] that just give us emotional expression
[1:06:59] but a Holy Ghost that would change us
[1:07:02] from the inside out something amen that
[1:07:05] becomes so real to us that we forget our
[1:07:08] hadiya's we'll forget all of the things
[1:07:10] that we plan to do and we'll focus on
[1:07:12] what he wants us to do is that the Bible
[1:07:16] that's the Bible yes by great
[1:07:22] you saved and raised us up together and
[1:07:26] has made us to sit together in heavenly
[1:07:28] places in Christ Jesus that in the age
[1:07:31] to come he might show the exceeding
[1:07:34] riches of His grace in his kindness
[1:07:36] toward us through Christ Jesus well for
[1:07:40] by grace are you saved through faith and
[1:07:42] not of yourself it is a gift of God oh
[1:07:46] my goodness folks it's a gift
[1:07:49] [Music]
[1:07:56] oh-ho I got to do this and that's why we
[1:07:59] messin up cuz oh you gotta do it ain't
[1:08:05] ain't no fasting in reality it ain't
[1:08:08] house ha how loud you scream is in my
[1:08:13] heart that melody of Jeor divine yeah is
[1:08:18] in my heart
[1:08:20] for I am his and he is mine you ask me
[1:08:25] why I sing and shout is in my heart
[1:08:32] it's in my heart she has to be a
[1:08:38] creation of God the creation of God is
[1:08:40] not in your liver it's not in your mind
[1:08:43] it's in your heart for by grace you're
[1:08:55] saved through faith that not of yourself
[1:08:57] it is it is the gift of God not of not
[1:09:00] of works lest any man should boast
[1:09:02] anybody can boast in here I know this
[1:09:06] sounds let me tell y'all something I'm
[1:09:07] really serious about it I really am and
[1:09:11] I don't know you know my way of
[1:09:14] preaching is not so popular the way it
[1:09:16] used to be because I used to think about
[1:09:18] you know just diving in there for the
[1:09:22] deep things of God and bringing it to
[1:09:24] the people and oh you know I became an
[1:09:26] actor in the message that's what they
[1:09:30] become some
[1:09:33] entertainer but Jesus never entertained
[1:09:37] anybody he went straight for the heart
[1:09:40] is that right he laid it out and then he
[1:09:44] left it up to the people to do whatever
[1:09:46] they had to do with it because you know
[1:09:48] why Jesus knew that all wasn't here but
[1:09:51] he understood it I laid that word out my
[1:09:54] people will hear my voice and that's
[1:09:58] what we're working with it's not it's
[1:10:00] not how well I can say it and you know
[1:10:03] articulate
[1:10:04] that's nonsense if God wanted that he
[1:10:08] would have gave us a property that had a
[1:10:09] DDD ldd but he took a prophet who only
[1:10:12] had a sixth grade and whatever education
[1:10:15] seven you know what I'm saying my point
[1:10:18] is this is when the Bible is so simple
[1:10:21] brother what I'm trying to bring to you
[1:10:23] is not complicated you know I'm gonna
[1:10:24] tell you I'm gonna give you one word to
[1:10:27] total surrender that's it total
[1:10:32] surrender surrendering everything and
[1:10:35] one thing about that you can't lie to
[1:10:37] God you can lie to yourself but God
[1:10:40] knows what's happening in your heart
[1:10:42] when Ukraine hmm oh my but we are his
[1:10:49] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[1:10:51] good works which God hath ordained that
[1:10:54] we should walk in them right you know
[1:10:58] what all day mean it means you enact
[1:11:00] amen it means to establish by law or to
[1:11:03] decree or to give orders right or to do
[1:11:06] or to distant or predestined that means
[1:11:09] God predestinated a people you and I to
[1:11:13] walk it to live it it's not because you
[1:11:17] desire to do it he gave you the desire
[1:11:19] to do it why because he knew that he
[1:11:22] gives you the desire to do it you do it
[1:11:25] see that's what I'm saying it still
[1:11:27] Christ alone everything that we do is
[1:11:34] because Christ ordained it to be so it's
[1:11:40] okay o Lord Ephesians 2:12 and 15 I got
[1:11:45] a few more scriptures but let me
[1:11:47] just going I'm not gonna be too much
[1:11:48] longer give me a few more minutes and at
[1:11:50] the time we were without Christ being
[1:11:54] alienated from the Commonwealth of
[1:11:56] Israel and strangers from the covenants
[1:11:57] of promise having no hope without God in
[1:12:02] the world but now in Christ Jesus ye who
[1:12:06] sometimes were far off are made nigh by
[1:12:09] the blood of Christ for he is our peace
[1:12:16] he's mine I don't have to be afraid of
[1:12:19] going to hell hallelujah amen every
[1:12:23] disease that Satan put forth Amen at me
[1:12:27] or you God has given us a word and a
[1:12:32] blood that will conquer everything but
[1:12:38] you got to have faith
[1:12:40] you got a faith you got to put the faith
[1:12:43] there but it's there y'all believe that
[1:12:48] the Bible said all things are possible
[1:12:50] didn't that to them that believe all
[1:12:52] things
[1:12:53] what devil can hold me down except God's
[1:12:56] will be done there if God has put me to
[1:12:59] a test that's God's business I'll go
[1:13:02] through the test but at the end of the
[1:13:04] test gets up guess what you and I come
[1:13:06] out out as a winner
[1:13:09] hallelujah think about it if God is
[1:13:16] living in you every time you commit a
[1:13:18] bad Act you put in God through such a
[1:13:22] nasty thing he don't stay there that's
[1:13:24] why he moves off and watch you do
[1:13:27] whatever you're gonna do and if you
[1:13:30] don't have to repent he won't ever come
[1:13:32] back down I was there I must identify
[1:13:41] with him y'all believe that maybe I'm
[1:13:46] crazy you don't the people thought when
[1:13:47] brother Brandon was preaching that
[1:13:49] message that man then really lost his
[1:13:51] mind but the title of his message was
[1:13:54] the mighty God unveiled before us
[1:13:58] my and you think about yourself how
[1:14:00] would
[1:14:01] I don't fully understand it but I know
[1:14:03] wherever God is I am yo y'all choke
[1:14:08] though network but it's the truth
[1:14:10] because if your spirit is in me wherever
[1:14:14] he goes I go with him I may not see it I
[1:14:18] may not feel it but whatever God is
[1:14:20] doing in his holy spirit is in me I'm
[1:14:23] doing it with him uh y'all know how
[1:14:31] those mommy used to say you know that
[1:14:33] baby comes out and he's gonna either
[1:14:35] love pickles or he gonna hate him cuz
[1:14:38] when I was pregnant I just eat pickle
[1:14:40] pickle pickle pickle with some ice cream
[1:14:44] sometimes those baby come out they want
[1:14:46] some pickle and ice cream sometimes they
[1:14:49] don't want to have nothing to do with
[1:14:50] pickles and ice cream
[1:14:52] cuz momma over fed them pickles and ice
[1:14:54] cream you understand me it's what the
[1:14:57] mother whatever she does during her
[1:14:59] pregnancy will affect the baby ha
[1:15:03] because wherever she goes the baby goes
[1:15:07] my grandbabies most of them come out
[1:15:09] praising the Lord because of me now they
[1:15:13] come out prisoners because of their
[1:15:15] parents their prayers praise the Lord
[1:15:18] and I know Amen melody and she get all
[1:15:20] of that energy amen because I think she
[1:15:23] kind of might a shower with her morning
[1:15:25] if she shouted with any of the babies
[1:15:26] and she comes out with all that energy
[1:15:30] yeah I don't believe that but it's true
[1:15:33] whatever you do and they always told
[1:15:36] told my wife says whatever you do when
[1:15:38] you get pregnant don't you lay around do
[1:15:40] things because if you don't you lay
[1:15:42] around your baby will come out lazy
[1:15:44] that's true I'm telling you all of
[1:15:49] something here
[1:15:51] hallelujah you are energetic Amen
[1:15:55] a fellow was telling me the other day
[1:15:56] that during the time that he he was
[1:15:59] exercising a whole lot Amen and stuff
[1:16:02] like that anyway his wife became
[1:16:04] pregnant and said that baby is so
[1:16:06] energetic they can't holler do none with
[1:16:08] him but you got to understand those
[1:16:11] things do affect children
[1:16:15] whatever God is doing will affect us
[1:16:19] hallelujah Jesus even said father I have
[1:16:22] one request wherever I am I want them to
[1:16:25] be there too hallelujah amen so you and
[1:16:29] I must understand him and that we were
[1:16:31] there for the RAM said I was I was with
[1:16:34] John the Baptist and before them critics
[1:16:37] I've seen the Spirit of God descending I
[1:16:39] heard the voice of God say this is my
[1:16:42] beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to
[1:16:44] dwell in yes sir I sure was identify
[1:16:47] with him that's exactly I was identified
[1:16:50] there at the grave of Lazarus when he
[1:16:53] raised up Lazarus I was identified the
[1:16:55] woman at the well when he told her her
[1:16:57] sins yes sir what do you say I was there
[1:17:00] how come that's why I can say a man
[1:17:03] that's why I can agree with it that's
[1:17:05] why I could say yes it did happen
[1:17:08] hallelujah I was there with Noah come on
[1:17:11] somebody with Noah preached 120 years I
[1:17:14] was there I don't need scientific proof
[1:17:17] because I was there the Spirit of God
[1:17:19] tells me I was there you said well what
[1:17:22] do you mean because it's no longer Twain
[1:17:24] is one hallelujah and with one body
[1:17:27] honey we were baptized by one spirit
[1:17:29] hallelujah and wherever that spirit is
[1:17:32] that's where we are that's why the Word
[1:17:34] of God said where the Spirit of the Lord
[1:17:35] is there is Liberty because nothing can
[1:17:38] buy in God not to get hold of hallelujah
[1:17:41] nothing
[1:17:42] hey man can take his Liberty away
[1:17:44] because he is Liberty is that right he

[1:20:57] we believed it just the way it was we
[1:21:00] didn't have no idea what the thunders
[1:21:02] was we didn't even realize we were the
[1:21:03] thunders

[1:21:28] brother who had no eyes God gave him
[1:21:30] eyes you don't have to believe it it's
[1:21:33] true in him there's a sister who was
[1:21:35] born blind God gave her her eyesight her
[1:21:39] mama came back the next day because she
[1:21:41] wanted her eyes to be healed and God
[1:21:43] didn't give her her eyes her sight and
[1:21:46] then the mother got jealous of those
[1:21:48] sister and said well if you if you if
[1:21:50] you if I forgot how she said it but the
[1:21:53] point is she got jealous and told her
[1:21:55] I'm gonna report it to the bureau she
[1:21:58] blackmail her own daughter I saw that
[1:22:03] later on the television set one day amen
[1:22:06] I was just visiting you on the news and
[1:22:07] they were saying she's amazing being
[1:22:11] blind and yet she can do all these
[1:22:13] things that's because she could see she
[1:22:18] wanted her money you understand me
[1:22:21] she been both around all alive she's
[1:22:22] still one of the money to come in that's
[1:22:25] wicked though yeah it's wicked hehe but

[1:22:29] something to do with it may God and give
[1:22:31] it repentance you love the Lord he said
[1:22:34] listen I was a witness the mighty
[1:22:36] rushing wind coming I witness dad I felt
[1:22:39] the power of God as it shook I was with
[1:22:42] them that spoke in tongues have you ever
[1:22:44] seen a blind person ride a bicycle no
[1:22:48] that's for the one who was doubting it
[1:22:50] she was caught riding a bike
[1:22:56] and she was not bumping up into anything
[1:22:59] you sure what do you mean brother how
[1:23:01] you know she was by and she was blind it
[1:23:02] was a family of blind people anyway you
[1:23:07] can't convince people all I can truly
[1:23:08] say is I know this message is real hey
[1:23:13] no matter what people say I know it's
[1:23:15] real it works
[1:23:16] hallelujah mmm he said I was there amen
[1:23:21] when when Peter then was in jail and the
[1:23:24] building shook at the prayer meetings
[1:23:28] and the building shook where they were
[1:23:29] setting I was identified there with them
[1:23:32] you know what I'm saying you know a lot
[1:23:34] of time you know when brother Branham
[1:23:35] talked about hey if people people look
[1:23:38] at us and and that's why I came settle
[1:23:40] for a dead church I can't settle for
[1:23:43] this calmness
[1:23:45] that's not message I don't know what it
[1:23:48] is but it's not message because we
[1:23:51] supposed to be above Pentecost it's
[1:24:00] gotten so bad that people try to tell
[1:24:02] you how to worship we have a guideline
[1:24:07] the only guideline that we have is that
[1:24:11] we're not to do rock and roll when it
[1:24:15] comes to worship you understand me y'all
[1:24:19] love the Lord see you and I must
[1:24:22] understand I'm identified with a group
[1:24:24] that knows he's unveiled
[1:24:26] I love brother Berto that knows he's the
[1:24:29] same yesterday today and forever that
[1:24:31] knows that this is not a fanaticism it's
[1:24:34] Jesus Christ is saying yesterday today
[1:24:36] and forever
[1:24:37] I'm identified with that group here yes
[1:24:39] sir they're called a bunch of here
[1:24:42] heretics yet a bunch of fanaticism on
[1:24:44] the count of the word of God I want to
[1:24:47] see some fanaticism in this place the
[1:24:54] fanaticism you know what fanaticism when
[1:24:57] you get to the place where you don't you
[1:24:59] shatter so much you don't even know
[1:25:00] winner stop you don't scream so much you
[1:25:04] know it's just beyond it goes beyond
[1:25:06] extreme but that's
[1:25:08] bring it to the balance you come in here
[1:25:11] not to be taught I am NOT a teacher per
[1:25:13] se I do know how to teach but I love to
[1:25:15] preach it is the preaching of the gospel
[1:25:21] it is the atmosphere that brings amen
[1:25:26] the power of God down
[1:25:28] Paul said I did not come to you with
[1:25:30] excellent specie I'm glad I'm not a
[1:25:33] teacher per se now that the pastor must
[1:25:35] be apt to teach I know how to teach you
[1:25:37] you want me to teach you something tell
[1:25:39] me what it what you want me to teach and
[1:25:40] I can do that by God's grace but my
[1:25:43] point is it is the power of God I try to
[1:25:45] bring in this place
[1:25:46] amen so the anointing can destroy the
[1:25:49] yoke but if you and I I'm not pulling
[1:25:52] for the I'm not in there no you're gonna
[1:25:53] be broken you're gonna hear this word
[1:25:55] and leave out just as Drive should come
[1:25:57] in I'm talking to everybody from the
[1:26:00] pulpit all the way back to the door we
[1:26:02] need God in this place
[1:26:06] I'm not like these message churches what
[1:26:09] they doing they drying up they're
[1:26:11] talking about what they got and ain't
[1:26:12] showing nothing there's got to be a
[1:26:15] people that want to see God who want to
[1:26:18] see him like I've seen him when I was
[1:26:20] first illuminated I want to see him know
[1:26:28] is that when God healed me from cancer
[1:26:30] you know you think you know the church
[1:26:32] would have went up in an uproar over
[1:26:33] praise the Lord take what let cancer
[1:26:40] strike somebody in here I hope not but
[1:26:44] when God heal you from it it ain't gonna
[1:26:46] be praise the Lord
[1:26:48] [Music]
[1:26:59] every denomination available every sound
[1:27:01] barrier you know and it's true and I'm
[1:27:04] closing I'm closing we my point is
[1:27:08] everything got to be in him in him you
[1:27:15] know I think that's why God just didn't
[1:27:17] leave John on the earth he brought John
[1:27:18] up come up hither see because there was
[1:27:23] a certain plane John had to be on in
[1:27:25] order for God to reveal himself to him
[1:27:29] y'all won't Revelation y'all really want
[1:27:32] God to unveil things to us I'm closing I
[1:27:34] know I know I know God is more than able
[1:27:38] to do that but it is there how could I
[1:27:43] say it I could imagine what you're going
[1:27:47] through without joy because the joy of
[1:27:52] the Lord is our strength and if you
[1:27:55] don't have joy you have no strength
[1:28:00] physical strength is not gonna beat the
[1:28:03] devil you got to have some supernatural
[1:28:06] strength and you and I must understand
[1:28:10] Lord restore my joy I said a lot of
[1:28:15] things this morning only to quicken or
[1:28:18] to make you think I want you to do
[1:28:21] inventory on yourself I can't do
[1:28:23] inventory you must know where you are I
[1:28:26] can't do it
[1:28:28] I take tally of myself every day
[1:28:33] throughout the day the devil can't tell
[1:28:38] me nothing when it comes to myself
[1:28:40] because I know myself you understand me
[1:28:44] my portion is this is what I said to the
[1:28:47] Lord on my way down here I says Lord not
[1:28:52] only me for some way are we gonna have
[1:28:56] to have us a service a funeral service a
[1:29:00] funeral service where all of us die to
[1:29:04] ourselves and I want God I said Lord you
[1:29:09] the only one that can orchestrate this
[1:29:11] service
[1:29:13] you can bring this on the scene I can't
[1:29:15] touch the people hard I can't go in
[1:29:16] there and make them see how serious a
[1:29:18] time it is but you are day me God sent
[1:29:21] me here you said what brother was what
[1:29:22] listen people I know I've been sitting
[1:29:24] here for a purpose I'm not imagining
[1:29:28] nothing I've seen God walk me through
[1:29:31] this thing and I have been sent here for
[1:29:33] a purpose and that purpose shall and
[1:29:36] will be fulfilled there is something
[1:29:42] that God is going to do for this church
[1:29:44] just prior to the rapture I know that
[1:29:47] and I am here for that purpose and I'm
[1:29:50] gonna preach what he tells me to preach
[1:29:51] and then you may not like it because
[1:29:54] it's not sounding good to you all who I
[1:29:57] know that you don't know nothing until
[1:30:00] what you've got in your head is in your
[1:30:02] heart that's when you know it it ain't
[1:30:05] your head that God is working with
[1:30:07] that's what the devil got a lot of
[1:30:08] people could deceive by their hair
[1:30:11] knowledge of this message it's not there
[1:30:14] that's not where God converts you it's
[1:30:16] in your heart you know that's the thing
[1:30:20] that made me know I needed more because
[1:30:23] when I was in the Pentecostal church I
[1:30:24] could sing at the shower I could dance
[1:30:25] but there are areas in my life I had no
[1:30:28] control of I felt like a city without
[1:30:31] walls no defense when this message came
[1:30:35] to me hallelujah oh it changed me
[1:30:39] hallelujah and even in my carriers I was
[1:30:43] strong not because I did it he did it oh
[1:30:47] you said my brother burns have you ever
[1:30:49] had any trouble in your life absolutely
[1:30:51] I've been just like David sometimes
[1:30:54] feeling like I'm gonna fit all by myself
[1:30:56] but at the same time God David cried out
[1:30:59] Lord deliver me and every time I've
[1:31:03] cried out to my god for deliverance he
[1:31:05] has to live with me that's all you got
[1:31:09] to do he's just that real he will
[1:31:11] deliver you how can you go before God at
[1:31:14] the end of the dancer's Lord I just need
[1:31:16] to deliver us and he gonna ask you why
[1:31:18] didn't you ask for deliverance why
[1:31:21] didn't you get delivered when you saw me
[1:31:23] there you knew I was there and I was
[1:31:25] there to deliver
[1:31:26] you ain't nothing too hard for God last
[1:31:30] and there's nothing too hard for God I
[1:31:34] want to be in him totally in him if I
[1:31:37] got to lose my mind to make it that way
[1:31:39] so be it walk the streets like a bomb so
[1:31:43] be it doesn't matter what he needs me to
[1:31:46] do I want to do just that
[1:31:48] y'all don't want to that's fine but all
[1:31:51] I could say is pray for me pray for me
[1:31:55] please because I see things in this
[1:32:01] Bible that I thirst for and I want it
[1:32:08] everything that he has shown me I thirst
[1:32:12] for it and I want it and I believe he's
[1:32:16] gonna give it to me yes in its time but
[1:32:19] I'll never give up on God because God
[1:32:22] has never given up on me y'all mind if I
[1:32:26] sing that song he's the Lord you maybe
[1:32:31] see that then just let me sing this song

[1:32:38] me to sing it and the devil don't want
[1:32:45] me to in Christ alone we'll our glory
