[38:21] chapter 1 verse 6 speak a message called
[38:26] the introduction of the Messiah amen
[38:35] Jesus Christ came 2,000 years ago was
[38:39] one of the greatest events in all
[38:41] history amen st. John chapter 1 verse 6
[38:48] it says there was a man sent from God
[38:51] whose name was John
[38:53] the same came for a witness to bear
[38:56] witness of the light that all men
[38:59] through him might believe he was not
[39:02] that light but he was sent to bear
[39:03] witness of that light that was the true
[39:06] light which lighteth every man that
[39:08] cometh into the world he was in the
[39:10] world and the world was made by him and
[39:12] the world knew him not he came unto his
[39:15] own and his own received him not but as
[39:19] many as received him to them gave he
[39:21] power to become the sons of God is that
[39:26] isn't that precious Saints amen how many
[39:28] as received him tonight amen amen so as
[39:32] many as received him to them he gave
[39:34] power to become the sons of God even to
[39:37] them that believe on is
[39:39] which were born not of blood nor of the
[39:42] will of the flesh nor of the will of man
[39:44] but of God and the Word was made flesh
[39:47] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[39:50] glory the glory of the only begotten of
[39:52] the Father full of grace and truth
[39:55] John bear witness of him and cried
[39:57] saying this was he of whom I spake he
[40:00] that cometh after me is preferred before
[40:03] me for he was before me and of his
[40:07] fullness have we all received and grace
[40:09] for grace
[40:11] a male Issus power has in a word of
[40:13] Prayer Heavenly Father we just want to
[40:16] thank you Lord for this metaphor this
[40:17] morning father for showing up in the
[40:19] room Lord for for being here with us
[40:22] Lord we're we're relying Lord on your
[40:24] presence we're relying Lord on your
[40:26] atonement father for your mercy and your
[40:28] grace towards us Pilate and we just pray
[40:30] Lord do you take the three minutes this
[40:32] morning Lauren take the highest place
[40:34] may your spirit Lord settle down over
[40:37] the audience father and touch every
[40:38] heart Lord in a way that I cannot do by
[40:40] myself father Lord that you would bless
[40:42] the words that come out of my mouth
[40:44] father they not be my words Lord but
[40:46] your words for we have opened up your
[40:48] Holy Word father and Lord we seek to to
[40:51] know it Lord perfectly and we just thank
[40:53] your father for allowing us to be in
[40:55] this place in your presence and we thank
[40:57] you Lord for all things in the name of
[41:00] Jesus Christ we pray amen amen god bless
[41:04] you can be seated amen you know John the
[41:08] Baptist had quite a position Amen the
[41:12] Messiah was coming amen and he he had a
[41:16] he had a job that that the that the path
[41:20] needed to be made straight for the
[41:22] Messiah to come amen for this was one of
[41:25] the greatest right I say the greatest
[41:28] moment in all of history that God was
[41:32] going to come down and be amongst his
[41:35] creation amen the God that created the
[41:38] heavens and the earth was going to was
[41:40] going to leave glory and come down to
[41:44] live amongst men to eat with men to to
[41:48] sleep with men to to to to fellowship
[41:51] one with the other
[41:52] to break the bread with a life with them
[41:55] amen to preach the gospel to heal the
[41:57] sick to reveal his power to them amen
[42:01] and such an appearance by the Almighty
[42:03] God by the Almighty Creator demanded
[42:06] that there must be an introduction made
[42:09] amen
[42:10] so that's why when to preach this
[42:11] morning was the eighth reduction of the
[42:14] Messiah amen who received him someone
[42:17] had to receive him first to reveal him
[42:19] unto others amen so God hand-picked a
[42:22] man called John the Baptist amen and he
[42:25] and he revealed to him that Christ is
[42:28] coming soon amen the Messiah that we
[42:30] have all waited for is on his way he
[42:33] might be amongst us right now
[42:35] John said amen he's I don't know where
[42:38] he is right now but he says he's right
[42:39] here amongst us right now he's he's
[42:41] somewhere around us somewhere around us
[42:43] is some of this walking that is actually
[42:45] not flesh and just flesh and bone but is
[42:48] the Almighty God that created the
[42:50] heavens and the earth and he said but I
[42:52] do know that when I see him I will wit
[42:54] bear witness of him amen
[42:56] because the Lord told me when you see
[42:58] the Spirit of God descending like a dove
[43:00] that is the one I am talking about amen
[43:04] so as John the Baptist was preaching and
[43:07] preaching and he and he went out to the
[43:09] river Jordan and he looked at all those
[43:11] scribes and Pharisees and he said you
[43:13] called gonna come back and make us I
[43:15] know you say that your father's cross
[43:17] this river Jordan I know you say a cross
[43:20] on dry ground but you guys need to leave
[43:22] Jerusalem amen
[43:25] leave your denomination leave all your
[43:27] foolishness behind come back here and
[43:29] cross Jordan all over again a man and
[43:31] come back to where you came from and
[43:33] come be baptized in the Jordan repenting
[43:35] of your sins because the Messiah is
[43:38] coming amen and so the soil really is
[43:41] calling and men would come out just to
[43:43] watch a man they leave Jerusalem to go
[43:45] out there's just a scene just to watch
[43:47] and he call him out you snakes in the
[43:49] grass why did you come out here to see
[43:51] why did you come out here for you know
[43:53] and he and he said because they didn't
[43:55] come out there to repent they didn't
[43:57] come out there to be made clean they
[43:58] came out there just a view and to see
[44:00] what was going on
[44:02] amen so in so in Jesus Christ came up to
[44:05] be baptized
[44:07] and he realize this is the one my entire
[44:11] ministry is up to this moment
[44:13] anyway he begins to realize you know I
[44:15] Lord I you know you should be baptizing
[44:19] me not me baptizing you but Jesus home
[44:22] suffered to be so amen the sacrifice had
[44:25] to be washed because because because
[44:27] John the Baptist's you know at first he
[44:30] thought he be introducing the Lion of
[44:32] the tribe of Judah but then he he caught
[44:34] the revelation for the Lord that I am
[44:36] introducing the lamb amen because
[44:39] remember he growing up as a child he
[44:42] heard the promises and he heard all the
[44:44] things about how God was going to raise
[44:46] up a king to sit on David's throne and
[44:48] all that and be the Lion of the tribe of
[44:50] Judah but God had to take him out in the
[44:52] desert and remove all that thinking away
[44:54] from him amen and say no you are not
[44:57] going to be introducing the Lion of the
[44:59] tribe of Judah you're going to be
[45:01] introducing the sacrifice you are going
[45:05] to introduce the atonement the atonement
[45:09] the Lamb of God that will be slain for
[45:12] the sins of his people a man be because
[45:14] before they can receive their king they
[45:18] first had to receive their atonement
[45:21] Amen because all those sacrifices from
[45:24] age after age after age of all the blood
[45:27] of bulls and goats could not remove the
[45:29] sins that they have committed a man so
[45:32] before they could ever receive their
[45:33] king they first all sudden John caught
[45:35] the revelation of it that's the king is
[45:38] at first the atonement is first and God
[45:40] is sending the lamb a lamb which was
[45:43] Christ himself God himself he says when
[45:46] the Lamb of God shows up when the lamb
[45:47] gosh shows up I will identify him amen
[45:50] amen and then when he saw he said though
[45:54] I see this the the the dove coming down
[45:58] the Holy Spirit coming down and just
[45:59] singing like enough that is the lamb
[46:01] that will be take away the sins of the
[46:03] world amen and he introduced the Messiah
[46:07] amen the Messiah was introduced and he
[46:10] was introduced what as a lamb
[46:13] a man to take away their sins and as
[46:15] many as it would receive him receive
[46:18] their head their sins were taken away a
[46:20] man as many as received that atonement
[46:23] their sins were taking away as far as
[46:26] the East is from the West their sins
[46:28] were taken away if they received him
[46:30] amen and not only that but when the
[46:33] Messiah was introduced and when that
[46:35] once their eyes were pointed towards the
[46:37] Messiah then the Messiah start going out
[46:39] and do miracles and miracles and
[46:41] miracles start showing his power and
[46:43] John became less and the Messiah became
[46:46] greater amen and you began to see the
[46:48] power of this lamb and the power that
[46:50] was behind this meek man amen and what
[46:54] does he do when he died those were
[46:55] little tokens of his resurrection amen
[46:58] little tokens of his resurrection that
[47:00] he hadn't even accomplished yet but
[47:02] little tokens of his resurrection being
[47:03] shown out that he was had all the power
[47:06] and heaven earth as Jesus said himself
[47:08] said behold all power in heaven and
[47:10] earth has been given unto me a man
[47:11] what'd he do he gave that unto the
[47:14] church a man the greatest event the
[47:17] greatest story in all time of all
[47:19] history a man John the Baptist said and
[47:22] of his fullness have we all received and
[47:25] grace for grace amen have you received
[47:28] his fulness hey man are you sure you've
[47:31] received his fullness a man have you
[47:34] received everything that Christ died for
[47:36] amen everything that Christ paid the
[47:38] price for maybe he paid the price that
[47:41] we could go back and be sinless they
[47:42] meant that we could be redeemed from the
[47:44] things that we've done I mean he paid
[47:46] the price for the sickness of our body
[47:48] amen he paid the price for for all the
[47:51] foolish things that we've done in the
[47:52] Reez that we committed that all
[47:54] that can be swept away and we could be
[47:56] standing before him amen amen we receive
[47:59] him amen and from glory to glory and of
[48:02] his fullness have all we received and
[48:04] grace for grace amen and for the law was
[48:09] given by Moses but grace and truth came
[48:11] by Jesus Christ that's what the man
[48:14] introduced himself I was over to the
[48:21] Book of Amos chapter 3
[48:27] familiar Scripture brother branham
[48:35] mentioned the scripture frequently Amos
[48:41] threes and sixth verse it says shall a
[48:48] trumpet be blown in the city and the
[48:52] people not be afraid share that shall
[48:55] there be evil in a city and the LORD
[48:57] hath not done it
[48:58] surely the Lord will do nothing but he
[49:01] revealeth his secret unto his servants
[49:04] the prophets Amen he revealeth his
[49:08] secrets to his servants the prophets
[49:11] a man so if the Lord is going to do
[49:13] something amen he's going to reveal it
[49:15] to his prophets and his prophets are
[49:18] going to go out and make the
[49:19] introduction to what the Lord is
[49:21] presently doing
[49:22] amen so whenever you're in an age where
[49:26] God is getting ready to do something and
[49:28] there is going to be a prophet there to
[49:30] tell you what the Lord is getting ready
[49:32] to do a man so that the so the people
[49:35] that are called by the Most High God can
[49:37] turn that corner and keep following that
[49:40] pillar a fiery man just like the
[49:42] children of Israel followed the pillar
[49:44] of fire in the in the wilderness and
[49:46] everywhere that pillar fire went they
[49:48] went and they followed it and followed
[49:50] and followed it amen and so God still
[49:52] has pillars of fire amen he still has
[49:54] prophets to lead the way a man so that
[49:56] when the pillar of fire changes
[49:58] direction and goes this way that the the
[50:01] people that are called by his name amen
[50:03] they're sincere and love the Lord to
[50:05] have something down on the inside that
[50:07] God can work with amen
[50:09] that they will see that they'll catch it
[50:11] that little seed will spring to life I
[50:13] will say that is truth that is real I'm
[50:16] going to follow that he meant because
[50:18] they realized that God is speaking to
[50:20] him and God is revealing to him what
[50:22] actions he is getting ready to take
[50:24] place amen
[50:25] because there has to always every time
[50:28] that God always has to be an
[50:30] introduction to a guy is going to do
[50:32] amen because everything that God has
[50:34] done he's actually has done it by Jesus
[50:36] Christ
[50:38] meant as much as we can talk about oh
[50:41] the prophet Isaiah was a great prophet
[50:43] you know and Jeremiah was a great
[50:44] prophet and all these were great
[50:46] prophets they were being led by the Lord
[50:48] Jesus Christ they're being led by the
[50:50] Holy Ghost amen men moved of old by the
[50:54] Holy Ghost wrote the scriptures so as
[50:56] they everything that they said when they
[50:58] came out of their mouth that they were
[51:00] speaking prophecies of the Holy Ghost
[51:03] amen and what is the Holy Ghost it's God
[51:06] amen it's God it's the one that created
[51:09] that being that created the heavens in
[51:11] the world amen amen
[51:15] and so that that spirit that Holy Spirit
[51:18] brings an introduction and constantly
[51:21] reveals unto his children what he is
[51:23] doing in the age when he is doing it
[51:25] amen and so there has to be an
[51:28] introduction it's the introduction of
[51:30] what the Messiah is who he is and what
[51:32] he is doing in the age that he is doing
[51:34] a man's like Enoch couldn't take Noah's
[51:38] message amen Noah couldn't take Enochs
[51:42] message amen each had their own message
[51:44] amen amen amen
[51:49] so John the Baptist had a message he
[51:51] says I am here to make straight the path
[51:54] for the Lord amen so that when he comes
[51:56] he can go straight about and do his work
[51:59] that he is here to do and did it work
[52:02] then it worked amen
[52:05] then even the disciples they had all
[52:07] heard of John they knew his ministry
[52:09] they knew what he was doing but they
[52:10] took the Lord to say so that was what
[52:13] you read back in the book prophets that
[52:16] is this is what it was doing is exactly
[52:18] what John said he was doing amen
[52:21] he was introducing the Messiah a man so
[52:24] John made the path straight for the Lord
[52:26] then Jesus came down and touched the
[52:29] heart of men amen the heart that he had
[52:31] placed something down in there on the
[52:33] inside to receive him before the
[52:35] foundation of the world and he came down
[52:37] to receive that touch that and what to
[52:39] do is start growing something on the
[52:41] inside amen I trust we've all had the
[52:44] same experience amen
[52:47] hey man why did they why do they need an
[52:49] introduction because they are
[52:52] affecting a key amen there they were
[52:56] focused the wrong direction
[52:59] amen they needed an atonement
[53:02] they are looking for deliverance from
[53:05] the Romans but the thing they needed
[53:07] deliverance from most was their heart of
[53:09] sin amen and they were facing the wrong
[53:12] direction and so John the Baptist came
[53:15] down preaching repentance repentance
[53:17] repentance get your heart right get your
[53:20] heart right get your heart right why is
[53:22] he doing he was making straight the path
[53:24] the Lord he was making the high places
[53:26] and bringing them down low taking the
[53:28] low places and bringing them up amen
[53:30] what was he doing making a straight path
[53:32] it wasn't it wasn't just whoa well he's
[53:34] going to build some roads out there or
[53:36] whatever they thought of back he first I
[53:37] was first prophesy but no he literally
[53:39] made the hearts right so they could
[53:41] receive their Messiah
[53:43] amen amen why so the Messiah was gonna
[53:46] be introduced and the plan before the
[53:49] Messiah was to be introduced as the
[53:51] hearts have to be prepared why so they
[53:54] can receive their Messiah amen the
[53:57] introduction of the Messiah came two
[53:59] hearts that were already prepared amen
[54:02] and I was a Jose it was an atmosphere
[54:04] over the whole country
[54:06] amen amen an atmosphere was being
[54:09] created year in the years preceding the
[54:12] introduction of Christ an atmosphere
[54:14] being created an atmosphere of
[54:17] repentance people are going out there
[54:19] John bastards bow knees cry now repent
[54:21] repent repent the kingdom of heaven is
[54:24] coming repent the kingdom of heaven is
[54:25] coming and the kingdom of heaven came in
[54:27] the Lord Jesus Christ amen so I do it
[54:31] got there they got it identified him not
[54:33] just as the Lion of the tribe of Judah
[54:35] but as the Lamb that would take away
[54:37] their sins
[54:39] amen amen
[54:51] hey man it's just like John the
[54:53] Revelator had the same experience when
[54:55] he was you know I said come up hither
[54:58] you know and behold the Lion of the
[55:01] tribe of Judah and he he turns around
[55:03] and he looks and there was a lamb as
[55:05] though it been slain a man he had the
[55:07] same experience amen
[55:13] that's the lamb introduction amen so in
[55:18] so when Jesus Christ was revealed as he
[55:21] began to show forth the fruits of his
[55:23] resurrection and show forth his power as
[55:26] being God Almighty as the sick began to
[55:29] be healed the dead began to be raised
[55:31] and the power of the Spirit that was
[55:33] with him too to speak to the wind to
[55:36] calm the storms and to create bread to
[55:41] do all these things into man you feed
[55:45] the 5,000 all things that were done he
[55:47] was showing forth the power that was
[55:50] down on the inside making full evidence
[55:52] that there was a that was a real power
[55:55] and what he do that same spirit amen
[55:58] and when he said my God my God you know
[56:00] why is not forsaking me and he said I
[56:02] commit my hand my spirit into your hands
[56:04] and then what the Holy Spirit as the
[56:07] Holy Spirit leaves him they meant as the
[56:09] Holy Spirit leads where the horse Peter
[56:10] Duke comes back down later the same
[56:11] pillar of fire splits itself up on the
[56:14] day of Pentecost amen and comes down
[56:16] Acts chapter 2 and that same pillar
[56:19] fires now as tongues of flame sit upon
[56:22] those that have been filled with the
[56:24] Holy Ghost amen and that experience
[56:27] still happens today amen tongues of fire
[56:31] still rest upon those that are filled
[56:33] with the Holy Ghost it's the same color
[56:35] fire that led the children of Israel in
[56:37] the wilderness now leads sons and
[56:39] daughters of God as they receive power
[56:42] to have the children of God amen and
[56:44] they received the Holy Ghost amen the
[56:47] same pillar of fire a man a known and
[56:49] and so many people with critics eyes
[56:52] brother Branham for talking about the
[56:53] pillar of fire and saying oh well you
[56:55] know you just imagine that or you just
[56:59] think that you saw that you know but but
[57:01] why should a true Christian doubt that
[57:05] because we know that it's there amen
[57:08] we're still living in Bible days amen oh
[57:12] I have not seen the pillar of fire with
[57:13] my natural eyes I haven't seen it but I
[57:16] have felt this presence I have felt his
[57:20] presence I know that he's there's been
[57:24] times where like I said when I've been
[57:25] driving down the interstate and I look
[57:27] around at the cars around me I wonder
[57:29] can they tell what's going on in this
[57:30] car I mean it's like dude do they see do
[57:35] they know what is going on on the inside
[57:37] of this vehicle as as God comes into the
[57:40] vehicle and the atmosphere changes you
[57:41] know and you you know that your God is
[57:43] he's making his presence known
[57:46] amen it is that same pillar of fire amen
[57:49] amen it's like a ram said do you feel
[57:52] that sweet presence standing between me
[57:55] and you it's a there on the purlins
[57:57] he says that's that same angels that
[57:59] same pillar of fire amen or out over the
[58:02] audience he said did you feel that sweet
[58:04] presence that came over that pillar of
[58:05] fire standing right above you amen why
[58:09] because this is that same presence
[58:10] that's leading the children of Israel
[58:13] now as leading his bride amen
[58:17] he's been introduced Amen he's been
[58:21] identified a man we know and we have to
[58:25] know him
[58:26] amen amen so the and so the holy spirit
[58:31] was made manifest there on the during
[58:34] the feast of Pentecost amen during the
[58:37] feast of Pentecost the Holy Spirit came
[58:39] down and may revealed himself in the
[58:41] upper room a man who made himself known
[58:44] made himself known to the people made
[58:46] himself known that the power of the
[58:48] Resurrection was now given to them the
[58:53] power of the resurrection of the Messiah
[58:55] and all the power that was inside Christ
[58:59] when he died upon the cross that power
[59:02] was released to be distributed upon
[59:06] those that receive Christ in his name
[59:08] amen and when they gathered together in
[59:11] you know in the upper room and they were
[59:13] gather go and they're worshiping they're
[59:15] praying they were seeking his face and
[59:17] as they gathered up there there all
[59:18] sudden
[59:19] that the same power that was in Christ
[59:22] was suddenly released to the church amen
[59:25] and the power it came down into the room
[59:27] like the sound of a machine right Erwin
[59:29] and they were filled with the same power
[59:31] amen amen
[59:33] that's what our God does a man it was
[59:37] during the Feast of the pentecost that's
[59:38] when the that's when the wave sheaf was
[59:40] waved that's when the firstfruits of the
[59:42] the harvest our are shown out and there
[59:45] and as they're waved over the people
[59:47] amen and and during those fifty days of
[59:50] of harvesting there from there to the
[59:54] feast of atonement there's seven
[59:56] Sabbath's there between the feast of
[59:58] Pentecost to the feasts of the atonement
[1:00:00] seven Sabbath's amen and what and what
[1:00:04] is is the the firstfruits or who were
[1:00:06] revealed there on the day of Pentecost
[1:00:08] amen that the see that went down into
[1:00:11] the ground multiplied itself up or came
[1:00:14] up and was and was persecuted on the
[1:00:16] cross a man he was smitten rejected of
[1:00:19] men a men and then that first fruits
[1:00:22] were waved over the people over
[1:00:23] Pentecost and then what the same power
[1:00:26] was given unto them amen so at the same
[1:00:28] power that was in Christ now is upon the
[1:00:31] church amen and throughout these seven
[1:00:33] churches we have seen the same power
[1:00:36] revealed over and over and over again
[1:00:39] amen
[1:00:40] and what now after after this is coming
[1:00:44] from brother Bram's message the feast of
[1:00:47] the trumpets and after after you come to
[1:00:51] the the end of those seven church ages
[1:00:53] the seven Sabbath's you come to the
[1:00:55] feast of atonement amen as the Jews have
[1:00:58] been called as the trumpets had been
[1:01:01] mirror we've been called by our seals
[1:01:02] we've been called by our church age
[1:01:04] messengers amen and was we have been
[1:01:07] called out now the Jews are also going
[1:01:09] through their call Amen it hasn't
[1:01:12] necessarily been fully revealed to us
[1:01:14] because we haven't received their Elijah
[1:01:16] right but we can see glimpses of what
[1:01:19] they're going through because we can see
[1:01:21] that something has been happening to the
[1:01:23] Jews for the last hundred years
[1:01:24] something is going on a man they're
[1:01:27] being called by their trumpets a man
[1:01:29] because the trumpets call the gathering
[1:01:31] of Israel
[1:01:32] amen so even though we may not fully
[1:01:34] understand it we know it's happening a
[1:01:37] man one of these days there will be two
[1:01:39] witnesses that will show up in Jerusalem
[1:01:41] and they will reveal just like it was
[1:01:44] revealed to us was it was revealed to us
[1:01:47] in the seventh Church eh what all the
[1:01:49] previous ages were all about amen and
[1:01:52] our enter and the blindness was taken
[1:01:54] off us and we saw where we stood the
[1:01:57] same thing is going to happen to the
[1:01:58] Jews between the sixth to the seventh
[1:01:59] trumpet event a man as two witnesses
[1:02:02] come down and they begin to reveal it's
[1:02:04] Moses and Elijah and they're showing
[1:02:06] forth and revealing they're looking for
[1:02:09] their king but they have to receive
[1:02:11] their atonement first amen they're
[1:02:14] looking for someone to come back and
[1:02:15] rebuild the temple
[1:02:16] amen a step type of worship again but
[1:02:19] first they have to receive the atonement
[1:02:21] and they cannot get their eyes off of
[1:02:25] the temple to receive the atonement
[1:02:28] until the Prophet comes amen and that's
[1:02:32] what they are waiting for let's turn
[1:02:35] over in our Bibles to Luke chapter 9
[1:02:47] speaking about the two witnesses what
[1:02:51] were they witnesses up the book of
[1:02:54] Revelation said at chapter 11 says that
[1:02:56] there will be two witnesses sent if
[1:02:58] you're a witness you had you can know
[1:03:01] you cannot be well I so-and-so told me
[1:03:04] that so-and-so told me that this
[1:03:06] happened
[1:03:07] amen in order to be a witness she had to
[1:03:09] be saying I saw it and I know what it's
[1:03:13] all about and I am going to expound to
[1:03:16] you what I saw and heard and give you
[1:03:19] the testimony game it so Luke chapter 9
[1:03:23] 28th verse it says
[1:03:30] and it came to pass about eight days
[1:03:33] after these sayings that he took Peter
[1:03:36] and John and James and went up into a
[1:03:39] mountain to pray amen now eight days now
[1:03:43] fifty days is seven Sabbath's plus one
[1:03:46] amen and that's where we're from the
[1:03:49] feast of Pentecost - the feast of
[1:03:51] atonement seven Sabbath's for us and
[1:03:52] then the fiftieth day will be in the
[1:03:54] eighth seventh amen and it came past
[1:03:57] about eight days after these sayings he
[1:03:59] took Peter John and James and went up
[1:04:01] into a mountain to pray and as he prayed
[1:04:03] the fashion of his countenance was
[1:04:06] altered and his raiment was white and
[1:04:09] glistering what was happening he's being
[1:04:12] transfigured I meant he's being the
[1:04:15] glory of his position of who he is
[1:04:20] amen nope not not no longer just the
[1:04:23] lamb but the the what he is what what
[1:04:27] why is Christ dying on the cross what's
[1:04:29] he doing this so that he can take us
[1:04:31] with with him to go and reign as king
[1:04:34] amen
[1:04:34] he's being glorify he's being
[1:04:35] transfigured amen and as he prayed the
[1:04:39] fashion of his countenance was altered
[1:04:41] and his raiment was white and glistering
[1:04:43] and behold there talked with him two men
[1:04:46] which were Moses and Elijah who appeared
[1:04:50] in glory and spoke of his decease which
[1:04:54] he should accomplish at Jerusalem they
[1:05:00] came to talk to him now remember Jesus
[1:05:02] hasn't been crucified yet but the Moses
[1:05:05] Elijah come down before the crucifixion
[1:05:07] meet with Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is
[1:05:11] our I picked up three witnesses so the
[1:05:13] thing would be sure so they could see
[1:05:14] this amen and it is sit there and when
[1:05:16] they taught us our talking this Moses
[1:05:19] Elijah I just we just came down we just
[1:05:21] want to kind of talk to you about these
[1:05:24] things we know that we have to bear
[1:05:25] witness of this later in the future amen
[1:05:28] and we want to know about your death
[1:05:29] that you're getting ready to have on
[1:05:32] Calvary about how you're going to be the
[1:05:34] lamb slain but all the Lambs that we saw
[1:05:37] how I remember when you you had me write
[1:05:39] down all on them tablet I remember when
[1:05:41] you had me right there or write down all
[1:05:43] these things all these
[1:05:44] and everything and I'll write all this
[1:05:46] down that you gave me amen and now I get
[1:05:49] to see what it was all about amen I get
[1:05:51] to see it was all about you you're
[1:05:53] getting ready to be slain for the sins
[1:05:54] of the people amen and they became
[1:05:57] witnesses of his majesty
[1:06:00] they became witnesses of his glory but
[1:06:02] they also became witnesses of his death
[1:06:04] that he was going to accomplish on
[1:06:05] Calvary amen and one of those two
[1:06:07] witnesses in Revelation chapter 11 they
[1:06:09] come down and they testify for three and
[1:06:12] a half years talking about the trying to
[1:06:15] bring them back to the Feast of the
[1:06:16] atonement
[1:06:17] amen because they're sitting there
[1:06:19] they're waiting they've been called out
[1:06:21] of out of all of Europe and out of all
[1:06:23] the places of all the world they've been
[1:06:25] called by the trumpets that had called
[1:06:27] out called out come out of her my people
[1:06:28] amen come into this land that I have
[1:06:31] prepared for you and they've entered
[1:06:32] into it and now their hearts have to be
[1:06:34] changed because the blindness is still
[1:06:37] there I mean remember they were blinded
[1:06:39] for our sake amen and they were called
[1:06:43] while they're still blind amen because
[1:06:45] the their the blindness was not removed
[1:06:47] once they were called amen so they were
[1:06:50] called out of Nazi they were called out
[1:06:53] of Hitler they are called by all those
[1:06:54] things they were called to a train to
[1:06:56] Jerusalem to receive that what they
[1:06:58] thought they're gonna receive their King
[1:07:00] the mighty king but first they must
[1:07:02] receive the lamb their atonement
[1:07:04] amen and these two witnesses will reveal
[1:07:07] that atonement to them amen and so the
[1:07:10] meantime while the sixth trumpet is
[1:07:12] being revealed and while they're going
[1:07:15] through their sixth trumpet we're going
[1:07:16] through what are we doing we're trained
[1:07:18] we transition from the sixth seal or
[1:07:20] from the sixth church age to the seventh
[1:07:22] church age amen amen and we're as
[1:07:25] they're progressing so we progressing it
[1:07:27] all comes to a blending our Amen where
[1:07:32] the Holy Spirit is getting ready to
[1:07:34] transfer over to the Jews that take the
[1:07:37] blindness away from their eyes to seal
[1:07:40] away the work for the Gentiles amen amen
[1:07:42] because we have already received our
[1:07:44] life amen we already had the Messiah
[1:07:47] that was introduced to our fathers amen
[1:07:52] and we'll be introduced to the Jews as
[1:07:54] also in these last days been introduced
[1:07:57] use to us hey man now let's just I know
[1:08:02] I know
[1:08:03] most of us here know this but we're
[1:08:05] gonna go through the I have these four
[1:08:06] scriptures that when I go through a male
[1:08:08] s turn over to Isaiah chapter 61 isaiah
[1:08:22] 61:1 and to prof isaiah here speaking he
[1:08:31] says the Spirit of the Lord God is upon
[1:08:34] me because the LORD hath anointed me to
[1:08:37] preach good tidings unto the meek he has
[1:08:40] sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to
[1:08:43] proclaim Liberty to the captives the
[1:08:45] opening of the prison to them that are
[1:08:47] bound to proclaim the acceptable year of
[1:08:49] the Lord and the day of vengeance of our
[1:08:52] God to comfort all that mourn amen
[1:08:55] here's Jesus Christ is being sent to do
[1:08:58] all these things but when Jesus Christ
[1:09:00] stood up in the Book of Luke and he
[1:09:02] opened up the scroll amen
[1:09:04] he opens up the scroll he gets set he
[1:09:06] stands up in the tabernacle or in the
[1:09:08] synagogue and he opens and he stands up
[1:09:10] with a synagogue he's gonna preach Jesus
[1:09:12] Christ is gonna preach to the people and
[1:09:14] a scroll is handed to him it's a scroll
[1:09:17] of the Book of Isaiah he opens up the
[1:09:19] scroll he's rolls up to the state to the
[1:09:22] point Isaiah chapter 61 here and he
[1:09:25] starts reading these same scriptures and
[1:09:27] he reads them and he says the Spirit of
[1:09:29] the Lord is upon me because the Lord
[1:09:31] hath anointed me to preach good tidings
[1:09:32] of the meek to buy out the brokenhearted
[1:09:34] to proclaim Liberty to the captives and
[1:09:36] opened the prison to them in their bound
[1:09:37] and to proclaim the acceptable year of
[1:09:39] the Lord and he stops at that comma
[1:09:41] right there
[1:09:42] Amen he stops right there Jesus Christ
[1:09:45] when he was reading this verse two
[1:09:47] thousand years ago stopped at that comma
[1:09:49] and midway through verse two a mint and
[1:09:52] Jesus stopped there because the next
[1:09:55] part says and the day of vengeance of
[1:09:57] our God it wasn't the day of vengeance
[1:09:59] two thousand years ago so Jesus stopped
[1:10:01] right where he was at and he rolls up
[1:10:04] the scroll and he says this day this
[1:10:07] scripture is fulfilled in your ears
[1:10:12] this is the day at the scripture and he
[1:10:15] could not go any further because that
[1:10:18] scripture the rest of that verse too was
[1:10:20] not revealed in that day
[1:10:22] hey man so now brother branham gets up
[1:10:25] on this in our last day amen amen and he
[1:10:28] gets up on preaching the gospel there in
[1:10:30] Arizona amen and he and he gets up and
[1:10:33] he goes to read of Rita but read a verse
[1:10:37] and two of his pages were stuck together
[1:10:40] and he and he goes to read and he can't
[1:10:43] get to the page he wants to go to he
[1:10:44] doesn't realize they're stuck together
[1:10:45] amen and so what does he do and her
[1:10:49] priest stands up and a Catholic priest
[1:10:53] sands up he says here God we don't know
[1:10:57] eat rest easy now
[1:11:00] God is fixing to do something take my
[1:11:04] Bible and read from this and brother
[1:11:07] Bram took the priests Bible and open it
[1:11:10] up and read the verse a mint from Bishop
[1:11:13] Stanley's by that and then he said and
[1:11:16] then later that night the next night I
[1:11:17] think that night or the next day he
[1:11:19] started to be preached a message this
[1:11:21] day this scripture is revealed in your
[1:11:24] ears this is the day the hour the day of
[1:11:26] the vengeance of our God is coming
[1:11:28] amen amen we're now at the end of time
[1:11:31] that where Jesus had to pause at that
[1:11:33] comma there the pause is being removed
[1:11:37] the thing that stopped Jesus from going
[1:11:40] he further is being removed amen and a
[1:11:44] prophet came in our day to let us know
[1:11:47] we're turning the corner the day of the
[1:11:49] vengeance of our God is coming amen
[1:11:52] repent get your heart ready get your
[1:11:54] heart ready why because it was it the
[1:11:56] Messiah was being introduced again this
[1:11:59] time is being introduced to the Gentiles
[1:12:01] now when the when the Messiah was
[1:12:04] introduced to the Jews
[1:12:05] well they are they were expecting the
[1:12:07] mighty king to come and deliver them but
[1:12:10] they needed their hearts to be ready
[1:12:11] first they were expecting the king but
[1:12:15] they needed to receive the lamb the
[1:12:17] atonement a man so brother Branham came
[1:12:20] and he came to preached what what are we
[1:12:22] doing we're here to receive our
[1:12:24] atonement amen
[1:12:25] we have to receive our time we talk
[1:12:27] about the rapture we talk about the
[1:12:29] second coming to the Lord but he but
[1:12:30] Jesus but as John the Baptist's for one
[1:12:33] the first company to the Lord
[1:12:35] so is this man sent with the message
[1:12:36] therefore were on the second coming Lord
[1:12:38] and before we can receive these mighty
[1:12:40] revelations we first must receive the
[1:12:43] lamb the atonia amen because that's
[1:12:45] always the pattern every time that's the
[1:12:48] pattern you must receive the atonement
[1:12:50] before you receive the revelation and
[1:12:53] once you receive the atonement then you
[1:12:55] can go forth to the day of Pentecost
[1:12:57] then you can go and receive the power
[1:12:59] Amen know then you can Becan receive
[1:13:01] power to become sons of God amen after
[1:13:04] you've received the atonement but let me
[1:13:06] tell you Saints once you have received
[1:13:08] that told me oh my
[1:13:10] once you have received that then you
[1:13:12] have received the power to become sons
[1:13:14] of God and that power is the same pillar
[1:13:17] of fire and led the children of Israel
[1:13:19] now leads every true believer a man so
[1:13:23] you cannot do the things that you want
[1:13:25] to do amen because when you try to go
[1:13:27] this way also the hoist Bears let's no
[1:13:29] stop don't do that go over here and do
[1:13:32] this
[1:13:32] go no don't do that do this over here if
[1:13:34] you do something wrong he convicts you
[1:13:36] you're like oh I gotta make that right
[1:13:38] Oh Lord forgive me forgive me
[1:13:40] what's he doing it's the same pillar of
[1:13:43] fire is leading his bride he's leading
[1:13:46] us leading us he has not left us without
[1:13:49] a witness amen he is still here this
[1:13:51] he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:13:54] today and forever amen brother Branham
[1:13:58] preached that even clearer back in the
[1:14:00] 1930s brother Branham had an old Ford
[1:14:03] panel truck and he had written he had an
[1:14:07] artist paint all over the side of it
[1:14:09] geez Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same
[1:14:12] yesterday today and forever amen
[1:14:14] Clare back in the 1930s he was preaching
[1:14:16] Hebrews 13:8 he's the same he's the same
[1:14:19] amen and we are coming and we are here
[1:14:22] to be to be heirs of that scripture
[1:14:27] heirs of that scripture amen we
[1:14:30] inherited that scripture that's our food
[1:14:32] that's our bread I mean healing is the
[1:14:35] children's bread amen deliverance is the
[1:14:37] children's bread a
[1:14:38] and all these things that's for the
[1:14:40] children and we have received power to
[1:14:42] become the children of God amen why
[1:14:45] because we have received the atonement
[1:14:47] amen now we can go receive the power
[1:14:52] amen amen the trumpets were to call
[1:14:57] Israel
[1:14:57] amen and when we look and see that the
[1:14:59] trumpets are already sounding that's why
[1:15:05] they are where they are something called
[1:15:07] them something called them to Israel
[1:15:10] what was is the trumpets now we haven't
[1:15:14] had a prophet to reveal to us exactly
[1:15:16] what those trumpets were but that they
[1:15:18] will have prophets they will have Moses
[1:15:20] and Elijah they'll come and reveal to
[1:15:22] them and Moses is the same one that
[1:15:24] wrote what the trumpets were all about
[1:15:26] the first time in the Leviticus he'll
[1:15:28] come and reveal the meaning of it the
[1:15:29] second time amen amen and they will
[1:15:33] preach the three and a half years and
[1:15:35] make a full revelation of where the Jews
[1:15:38] stand amen 144,000 will receive it they
[1:15:41] meant mine where do we stand Saints day
[1:15:46] man so as soon as as soon as the
[1:15:48] temptation comes upon you and says well
[1:15:50] it's been 50 60 years now I can relax
[1:15:54] you know maybe maybe the message isn't
[1:15:57] all what it's supposed to have been or
[1:15:59] or maybe God has left us alone or or
[1:16:02] don't you don't you get that don't you
[1:16:05] let that slackness don't you let that
[1:16:07] lay it Laodicean laziness fall upon you
[1:16:10] amen amen because we realize that we are
[1:16:13] right on the on the border of the coming
[1:16:16] of the Lord amen we have received amen
[1:16:20] no I want to continue on we went to
[1:16:22] Isaiah and Luke where Jesus Christ
[1:16:24] stopped halfway now I want to go to the
[1:16:27] Elijah portion of those so let's go over
[1:16:30] to Malachi chapter 4
[1:16:43] amen we were preaching this in down a
[1:16:52] village in Guyana to the chief of the
[1:16:56] village he had gathered a couple of the
[1:16:59] denominational pastors of village and I
[1:17:02] wanted to know what we were doing there
[1:17:04] and now these are the scriptures we used
[1:17:06] Isaiah and Luke and then this and and
[1:17:09] then back to Luke again amen verse
[1:17:14] Isaiah or a mouse or Malachi Malachi 4
[1:17:18] verse 5 it says behold I will send you
[1:17:22] Elijah the Prophet before the coming of
[1:17:25] the Great and dreadful day of the Lord
[1:17:27] he shall turn the heart of the father's
[1:17:30] to the children and the heart of the
[1:17:32] children to their fathers lest I come
[1:17:35] and smite the earth of the curse
[1:17:37] now amen now the spirit Elijah came in
[1:17:39] John the Baptist amen he prepared the
[1:17:42] way before the Lord amen and what'd he
[1:17:44] do he turned the hearts of the he turned
[1:17:47] the hearts of the fathers of those old
[1:17:50] Pharisees and Sadducees of those fathers
[1:17:53] to the children that received amen he
[1:17:56] turned their hearts amen
[1:17:57] what'd he do he stopped right there
[1:17:59] right he stopped right there now I know
[1:18:03] to go now let's go over to John the
[1:18:04] Baptist there
[1:18:05] Luke's 117 says here in Luke
[1:18:14] John the Baptist fulfilled the first
[1:18:16] part of that verse just like Jesus
[1:18:18] fulfilled the first part of his verse
[1:18:26] Luke 1:16 talking about John the Baptist
[1:18:32] here and says and many of the children
[1:18:34] of Israel shall he turned to the Lord
[1:18:35] their God amen and he shall go before
[1:18:38] him in the spirit and the power of
[1:18:40] Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers
[1:18:43] to the children but he doesn't turn the
[1:18:47] hearts of the children back to the
[1:18:49] father's because he only fulfills the
[1:18:50] first half of that verse amen
[1:18:52] so then what there has to be an Elijah's
[1:18:54] spirit come amen they will turn the
[1:18:57] hearts in this day of the children back
[1:19:01] to our Pentecostal fathers amen so those
[1:19:05] that receive the atonement amen on the
[1:19:08] end they received the atonement of
[1:19:11] Christ who died on Calvary and they went
[1:19:13] into an upper room and they received and
[1:19:15] they received the same pillar of fire
[1:19:18] coming down upon them like tongues of
[1:19:20] fire amen
[1:19:21] those are our fathers amen and a spirit
[1:19:25] of Elijah came down on a man by the name
[1:19:27] William Branham he came to turn our
[1:19:29] hearts back to that a ment where all the
[1:19:33] Pharisees had to get off their high
[1:19:35] horse and turn their hearts to the
[1:19:37] disciples say man to the children we
[1:19:40] have to turn our hearts back to the same
[1:19:42] disciples they men who received that
[1:19:44] Pentecost amen amen and what and so we
[1:19:50] are led by the same pillar of fire
[1:19:52] that's why that's why the pillar fire
[1:19:54] was so prevalent in brother brands means
[1:19:55] because we have to be turned back to
[1:19:58] where the pillar of fire first came he
[1:20:00] meant that asked the token the pillar
[1:20:01] fire came on the day of Pentecost split
[1:20:04] itself up an opponent and what's he
[1:20:06] trying to do what'd he do he would the
[1:20:09] pillar fire would go and settle over
[1:20:10] someone and they'd be healed
[1:20:13] he'd go over here and his salesperson
[1:20:15] they'd be healed and he'd go over was
[1:20:17] the split fire is identifying people
[1:20:19] that have a need of the resurrected
[1:20:21] Messiah the pillar fire was identifying
[1:20:25] people that had an
[1:20:27] need of the resurrected Messiah a man
[1:20:30] and didn't you're a rogue Graham said no
[1:20:31] high spirits sisse don't don't get up
[1:20:33] don't move around the stay reverent stay
[1:20:36] reverent what's he doing he's a killer
[1:20:38] fire he doesn't want if the pillar fires
[1:20:39] identifying himself or people to have a
[1:20:42] need of the resurrection he meant and we
[1:20:45] all have a need to experience the power
[1:20:48] of his resurrection to experience he's
[1:20:50] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:20:51] amen and we have to experience the same
[1:20:54] pillar of fire to reveal unto us that
[1:20:58] Jesus Christ is still alive amen amen
[1:21:00] the pillar fire is still here to do that
[1:21:04] amen
[1:21:06] was that the Messiah is being introduced
[1:21:09] to us the Messiah has been introduced to
[1:21:13] us amen we're here to reveal though the
[1:21:17] whole has been revealed unto us amen
[1:21:23] just like in the book of Esther when
[1:21:26] Vashti rejected the summons of her King
[1:21:35] amen
[1:21:36] the King has earth set up a feast I
[1:21:41] don't I didn't look it up right before I
[1:21:44] got up here but I believe it was a
[1:21:45] hundred and eighty days or 150 days
[1:21:47] somewhere in that 180 day feast to to
[1:21:52] testify of all the glory of his kingdom
[1:21:54] and as he and as he and it throughout
[1:21:58] this feast he is showing the glory of
[1:22:00] his kingdom and we gather together all
[1:22:02] the Lord's and all the captains and all
[1:22:04] the chief men and he gathered again and
[1:22:06] he started revealing the glory of his
[1:22:08] kingdom the glory of his kingdom the
[1:22:09] glory of his kingdom and I got to II the
[1:22:11] last couple days of the feast he saved
[1:22:14] the best for last and he wanted to
[1:22:16] reveal his bride at the very end of the
[1:22:18] feast a manis he went to go reveal his
[1:22:21] bride to to the gathering to the church
[1:22:24] he went to go reveal his bride to the
[1:22:26] captains that that the bride refused to
[1:22:30] come and she and what'd she do she had
[1:22:34] her own feast going on with her own
[1:22:36] maidens up in her own chambers and she
[1:22:40] counted
[1:22:41] her feast more glorious and better to be
[1:22:45] attended to than the Feast of King
[1:22:48] Hauser's so she refused to come when
[1:22:51] king azeris bid amen and so is a ban in
[1:22:54] the last day God has shown his the glory
[1:22:57] after a glory 7 church ages he's been
[1:22:59] revealing the power of his resurrection
[1:23:01] he comes here in the last day to reveal
[1:23:05] the bride of Lord Jesus Christ and he
[1:23:07] calls the church to step up to that high
[1:23:10] calling to step up to that high honor
[1:23:12] but instead they're sinners they're
[1:23:14] gathered together in their own cloisters
[1:23:16] they're gathered together in their own
[1:23:18] denominations and they're and they're
[1:23:20] receiving affirmation one of the other
[1:23:22] instead of receiving affirmation from
[1:23:24] Christ amen and they're receiving and
[1:23:27] they're talking about how great they are
[1:23:29] and how great he is a man so when he
[1:23:32] calls the bride to be revealed they
[1:23:35] begin to reveal vast she reveals that
[1:23:37] she's not worthy to even be the bride
[1:23:40] amen so here we are at the last days
[1:23:43] when at the end of the feast the end of
[1:23:45] the Pentecostal feast the fifty days
[1:23:47] amen and it's time for the bride to be
[1:23:50] revealed right before the feast of
[1:23:52] atonement for the Jews and what is it
[1:23:54] and and the church has risen up and
[1:23:56] shown that they would rather have their
[1:23:58] programs their denominations they'd
[1:24:01] rather have their own doctrines and
[1:24:02] dogmas so and they bound the Holy Spirit
[1:24:05] of God so he can't work can't lead and
[1:24:07] they bound the pillar of fire so he
[1:24:10] can't move amongst them a man so at that
[1:24:13] moment they count themselves not worthy
[1:24:15] they get removed from from their
[1:24:18] position of honor and he says go and
[1:24:21] seek out a woman that will that will
[1:24:23] receive me a man they will that will and
[1:24:26] wasn't an ester fit why because she
[1:24:31] could receive the leading of the Holy
[1:24:33] Ghost
[1:24:34] she received the leading of the
[1:24:36] Chamberlain
[1:24:37] amen amen so now the same thing those
[1:24:41] that in this day they received the
[1:24:43] leadership of the Chamberlain the
[1:24:45] leadership of the Holy Ghost they
[1:24:47] receive the same pillar of fire they're
[1:24:49] our hearts is turned back to the
[1:24:51] Pentecostal fathers they received the
[1:24:53] same pillar of fire
[1:24:54] they came down on the day of pentecost
[1:24:56] amen amen and then what do they do they
[1:24:59] are counted worthy why because they're
[1:25:01] not looking forward to their own word to
[1:25:04] their own Dogma Amen brother Brian said
[1:25:08] that the very riot the right at the time
[1:25:10] of the sixth and seventh trumpet when
[1:25:12] when God is getting ready to reveal
[1:25:14] himself to the Jews the church rejects
[1:25:17] the word and the bride receives the word
[1:25:20] and goes up to glory amen amen right
[1:25:24] there by where do we stand that Messiah
[1:25:29] has been introduced to us introduced
[1:25:32] that he is the atonement a man but he's
[1:25:36] not just the atonement but he's the same
[1:25:37] pillar of fire that led the children of
[1:25:39] Israel in the wilderness the same pillar
[1:25:41] of fire that that came down on the day
[1:25:43] of Pentecost the same pillar of fire
[1:25:45] that was in brother man's meetings is
[1:25:47] all the same over and over the Messiah
[1:25:50] is being introduced to us and while the
[1:25:53] church has rejected the word we received
[1:25:55] the word and go up into glory with him
[1:25:59] that's where we stand
[1:26:01] Messiah has been introduced soon as they
[1:26:03] as they receive the gay agenda amen as
[1:26:07] they receive perversion as the church
[1:26:10] begins to have to make choices of
[1:26:12] whether they will have women preach the
[1:26:14] gospel as they have to make choices of
[1:26:17] whether they'll have married gay
[1:26:19] marriages right amen as the law is going
[1:26:23] to start cracking down on these
[1:26:24] ministers and say you have to you have
[1:26:27] to marry a homosexual or you or or or or
[1:26:31] you can't preach the gospel because they
[1:26:36] rejected the word back in the 60s the
[1:26:39] denomination is now they can't go back
[1:26:41] to the word the stance so they're like a
[1:26:43] waving ship that goes they don't know
[1:26:45] where they go there and where they stand
[1:26:46] and and and now the and now the
[1:26:49] grandchildren of those that rejected the
[1:26:51] word have been set for failure how can
[1:26:54] they receive the word unless they hear a
[1:26:57] cry come out of her my people
[1:26:59] let's see we made partaker of her since
[1:27:01] Amen because you're living in Babylon a
[1:27:04] cage of every unclean and hateful bird a
[1:27:07] man ZZZ unclean
[1:27:08] birds are being revealed and all the
[1:27:10] cages of denominations amen
[1:27:12] does God need people that have come out
[1:27:14] of her amen and and and and receive the
[1:27:18] atonement and we've been washed away of
[1:27:20] all their sins a man in the clean
[1:27:23] cleansing of the Lamb that comes upon
[1:27:25] them a man then they could receive their
[1:27:28] Messiah because then the Messiah can be
[1:27:30] revealed to them amen amen amen
[1:27:48] let's just stand let's turn in our
[1:27:51] Bibles as we stand over to revelations
[1:27:53] chin 7 at the very time that the Jews
[1:28:03] are being called by their trumpet the
[1:28:08] bride receives the word she hears the
[1:28:11] voice of the seventh angel messenger of
[1:28:14] Laodicea the mystery of God is finished
[1:28:16] is finished she receives it and she goes
[1:28:20] up in a rapture into glory amen
[1:28:22] revelations 10 seven says but in the
[1:28:25] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:28:27] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:28:30] of God should be finished as he has
[1:28:32] declared to his servants the prophets as
[1:28:35] we read in Amos 3 the Lord will do
[1:28:36] nothing except he declares it first to
[1:28:39] his servants the prophets and the same
[1:28:41] thing happened again in our day for the
[1:28:43] seventh angel the Laodicean angel amen
[1:28:46] revealed the mysteries of God you know
[1:28:48] laid open the revealed the word to us

[1:28:59] all the mysteries of marriage and
[1:29:00] divorce and and all these things are
[1:29:03] open to us amen so that we can follow
[1:29:05] lock in step with what God had intention
[1:29:09] from the beginning as Jesus said with
[1:29:11] marriage divorce you know but it wasn't
[1:29:13] so from the beginning well we had a
[1:29:15] prophet come and reveal that to us in
[1:29:17] this day amen amen that's why we that's
[1:29:20] why we stay with what the mess

[1:29:27] amen while the denomination rejects the
[1:29:30] word we received the revelation of the
[1:29:32] word to the seventh angel amen and our
[1:29:35] hearts are turned back to the
