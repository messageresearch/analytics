TRANSCRIPT
========================================
our brother Eve Mula um lost his brother that's his this is Brother Neville's uh dad he left lost his older brother day uh a couple of days ago so for those of you who might want to call him and encourage him whatever the Lord would lead you to do that would be surely appr appreciate it uh keep him in his prayer keep brother e in your prayer and uh by the grace of God is there anybody else that need prayer tonight amen okay let us pray our Heavenly Father God that we come before you Lord Jesus as hum as we know how we thank you for your goodness and your grace we thank you Father for being so good to us Lord we thank you for this opportunity to come before your people Lord once again with your holy word Lord if there be anything we have said or done that would displease you we pray that you cleanse us Lord and forgive us oh God for all that we may have said or done or even thought today that was not in in line with your word Lord keep us connected keep us uh in a place of reverence and respect and father we' be careful to give you the praise Glory and Honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen uh like I said we'll be coming from the book of Jude there's no way that we could U finish the whole chapter today so we're going to spend a few time a few services on this um the word Jude means praise Jude and Judah means praise and Jes Jesus Christ came from the CH tribe of Judah so it it is a it amazes me that Jude would tell us about some things that is about to that would happen um and he warns us but let's read here Jude the first uh the first chapter there's only one chapter to Jude but anyway let's read the beginning at the first ver verse Jude the servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James to them that are Sanctified by God the father and preserved in J Jesus Christ and called Mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered to the Saints let us pray once again father we thank you for the reading of your word we pray father God that you would Sanctified into our hearts bless us now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated in studying Jude I really have been having a um a way of Enlightenment or great um time in it um because Jude amen as I said in in the English way of saying it it means praise and um if you know that Jude is the 26th book of the New Testament right it was written by Jude Jude and James are the brothers of Jesus Christ himself um so we appreciate that knowing amen that uh they were all in the family now we want to say about the grace of God that um Jude is uh uh is right just before Revelation it is an important book it's a small one uh look like it's just as small as it is it may be looked upon as being insignificant but Jude in that little space and time within that letter uh basically tells a lot and of course we we know that when the Book of Revelation is open it is time for the Third Exodus and of course in the book of Jude you're going to find out that he deals with uh a few exoduses like Noah in the days of Noah you know and uh different Enoch and different things like that where God delivered his people I was listening to um the a message today the invasion of the United States because Jude is basically telling us even in seed form which going to take place and he basically went back into the Old Testament to show us the kind of spirits that we would have to deal with in our day um it took brother brandom it took God to send us a prophet to make us understand not only Jude but the Bible itself because we must understand that this is a Warfare everything is a Warfare um we know that the first war uh started in the heavens and of course it was brought down uh to Earth uh here in the Garden of Eden where mankind fell but going to the modern day we must realize amen that when God start something you know brother B said like this whenever God brings a Revival it always produces Twins and we must understand that even in I you start from this point in 190 six uh with the restoration of the gifts the Pentecostal move uh among the Pentecostals were born Twins and if you know in 1906 I believe it's when the Holy Ghost fell on auu street and of course 56 years from that would have been 1956 but this message invasion of the United States was given in um in 1954 which is 2 years prior to the Jubilee and for those of us who may not uh know and and understand in 1956 also uh in 5657 came the indictment of the United States so what brother Brandon was trying to tell them two years prior to their Jubilee that the Jubilee will will sound you can go free you can be really a true church if you if you leave the worldly things alone but we find out instead of accepting their uh Freedom they ended up having holes bored in their ears in other words they became slaves to the Demonic power that had now invaded them if we understand any type of things about the physical body when a germ enters into your body it's an invasion and of course in your in your natural body your natural body will fight you know to keep that germ from overtaking taking it but in the course of some situations like say for cancer when cancer invades your body you know cancer is a smart demon sometimes it can it can camouflage itself so much so for a long period of time before your body really reacts in the way of a fever or rejecting it but normally at that time when it shows itself it has not only um invaded you but it has possessed you and whenever a devil comes whether it be in the natural realm or the spiritual realm it doesn't just come to uh uh possess you it come uh to to invade you brother it comes to possess you it comes to take full control of your body and this is what Jude was trying to tell the people these Spirits are still alive as brother bandam said the people may die but the spirits do not and we're not we're we're we're now dealing with ancient demons amen demons from the anian world smart devils and uh so you must understand when when Satan comes in he has a slly way of doing it he's always a deceiver and he's and of course according to the uh a book of Revelation we know that he rides on a horse a white horse uh acting religiously but that's the way he always does he he looks like truth when he is a lie and that's what what we must come to understand that this so-called virus the thing that moved throughout the church Pentecost didn't see it but they had a prophet to tell them just what the word of God says okay you rich you increase with good you have need of nothing right and when you say I have need of nothing nothing we find out in Revelation 3rd Chapter they put Jesus Christ out of the church and this is the goal of every uh age have that we've come through it was Satan's duty to put the word out Amen to stop the word from growing and flourishing in the people uh because he knows that if he could stop the word he stop the process in which God or or the purpose for which God has has purposed the word to do so I say all of this thing is to say 1956 it was no longer an invasion in 1956 it was a possession because now they refused the Lord Jesus Christ amen remember the prophet of God said God in 1957 I believe it was he called Billy Graham or Roberts all of them to come back to America trying to produce a Revival well it didn't work they put him out and from that point on bringing it on into the 60s you find out that what happens America gets worse and worse and worse and worse there is no Revival other than the brides Revival amen and that Revival is the word coming into individuals bringing them to a repentance bringing them into the Holy Ghost and bringing them into Perfection I'm I mean I'm I'm telling you these things okay now we understand by the grace of God when when this nation rejected um the word uh women receive her their rights to vote and and from there she received worship and then from there she receive uh she she excelled in her beauty uh she become uh and and from there she uh the she became the god of the nation and I'm telling you these things so you understand when I read Jude when I finish reading the other part of Jude you understand what I'm saying because a spirit had been had has taken over our country and there is nothing you can do about it amen it's too far gone not only our country but because of us the American people we we Channel these demons that's right into the rest of the world and all of the world has patterned themselves after America because they received the Demons by way of TV by way of whatever we know that is a channel that's why they call it channeling turn the channel they channeled it in this smart scientific way they have conquered the demons that were in Germany I'm saying a lot of things that have come come to conquer have conquered and you saywell what do you mean now the only way uh to ex to um find yourself in a place of safety is to escape amen that's right to exit amen right cuz remember in the days of Noah it had gotten so bad that only eight Souls were saved that mean all of the rest of the world were serpent seed in Egypt y think about what I'm saying here so what are you saying the Bible said as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of lot what that's right serpent seed controls the world Amen and the righteous is scarcely saved right and all of this has been done by planning serpents planning and engulfing people and bringing them to a bondage and bringing them because because all of this is about worship you're going to e either worship God or you going to worship the devil amen so that you understand when Jude was talking he even CA came to say a lot of things but let me let me move on brother ROM said amen in a in a little message uh invasion of the United States paragraph 73 he says when they ought to have an oldfashioned God First crying out alter call down there where men and women don't come to glamorize or to run up and act like a clown but to get down to the Altar and realize that the death of Jesus Christ there that died for them that they're getting back sincere with God again and when have you seen that when the last you've seen that right because here in in in our Church we're not sincere enough amen we come here glamorized looking pretty and beautiful and that's not the gospel that's another influence amen and we fail to see it because the whole of the world is doing it so we figure it's okay for us don't you know when you get too pretty or get too glamorized you you you're not humble you can't get down on your knees in your pretty dress or your pretty suit and cry crying balling before the Lord yall understand what I'm saying it's it's real it's real this is what the devil has done not only to Pentecostals but has done the same thing to people who are in the message and we must realize amen that these demons that we're dealing with is here to make you cold or lukewarm amen that is what they come to do he said I wonder if we're not living in the kind of time when we take great evangelists like many that's crossing the land today of great known evangelists who study psychology and attract the people to the church woo tell me that's not happening they have special programs that's right to bring people to the church through psychology amen right but after you once get them in the church then what you're going to do to them what what are they going to happen after they get into the church they just join the church and go back with the same real something that's genuine and what happens is when a church lose it's like it's like a coold you you real strong until a flu hit you am right something has invaded your body to weaken you and that's exactly what has happened to the church or the bride I I hate to say bride but but I mean what we call bride many of the people are sick and brother random said that we the church is the sickest body ever right now think about it they had a chance they had a chance in 1956 to repent and it's amazing because that's the year I was born at least 56 55 one of the two but nevertheless we realize by the grace of God Amen that things have gotten worse I remember when I first came to the Lord even in the Pentecostal Church the power of God was there it wasn't we weren't I can said manipulated by the music we were the music amen and we didn't have the the best of singers and everything but what we had brought the spirit of God down but now people are too prideful they don't go that way and what is that that's what Jude was talking about I'm coming to it in a moment we have the M made the message uh a message of the Baptist influence if you just believe Malachi 4 Revelation 10 we don't want the form we want the real deal but that's what happens and then we get into the Pentecostals I can Shout I can dance I can speak in tongues and I I got a little gift with me that ain't it either being prideful you've got to be humble you got to be meek you got to break down and allow God to to to take your take take away all this this just the word God put them there Moses had them there amen right and those Rebels they just don't attack the the the the congregation but they attack the preacher and the whole purpose of attacking the preacher is to get this the preacher to do what Moses did Smite The Rock Amen that's right but this is not a time to Smite the rock this is a time to speak you see what I'm saying we can't afford to allow the church to get us angry frustrated upset to we we we we voice our own opinion about things it must all become all come from God Amen right we're not here as ministers to uh glorify ourselves I'm coming I'm coming he said I'm afraid paragraph 75 I'm afraid we're made it too easy I think Joy certainly I believe that all joy lays in Jesus Christ that's right I believe it's joyful and happy but remember brother it's the the way of Agony and suffering and the cross you must realize that too and when you got a church that knows nothing about Agony they know nothing about suffering and most of all they know nothing about the cross they are now Antichrist amen that's right you do with the blood do away with the blood you of the devil am y'all hear what I'm saying because every Church must realize if you take out Calvary from your church you've got nothing we know that when Jesus Christ took took the book that was a great event amen but that event could never have happened if Calvary would not have happened right see the foundational truth we're saved by grace not by works right but we find out that we have H how can I say we go to seed on certain things and we think that salvation and that is not salvation he that begun the good work in you is faithful to complete it he is the master builder right no man can anybody in here add a Cuba to your statue no so what it is we must allow ourselves to Humble ourselves to get in contact with the master builder that's why we fall short all the time cuz we're trying to do it ourselves but why go the heart away right remember I read that scripture out of Deuteronomy the other day about Jesus Christ leading them into the Wilderness to do what try their hearts amen this is what you're going through now that's right God is trying your heart so that you can see what's in you God already knows but he wants you to see what's in you right let's go back to Jude it's a common salvation that's why I brought Calvary back in it's a common salvation right so if you talk about the unic when he was reading there in Isaiah he said who is he talking about amen that's right is that right then Philip expounded to him what the gospel and then when they came to the water he said what what him you for being baptized you can't preach the gospel without preaching baptism too amen it comes together but how long have you heard baptism we've got people in this church that still need to be saved baptized as well but people think they can be saved without being baptized only if you don't know the truth right God only holds us responsible for what we have heard is that right Jude three uh third verse beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you the common salvation it it's not anything puffed up it's messy it's bloody amen right it's not pretty and whenever your church gets so pretty something's wrong y'all looking at me like I'm preaching my own word y'all better listen to y tapes you'll know I'm preaching the truth it was needful for me to write unto you and exalt you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto you earnestly do what earnestly fight in other words you fight the right way not with your fist amen it's a word the word staying with the word and and and refuting anything that is against the word word amen if the devil say Jesus Christ is not the same yesterday you say uh-uh you're wrong amen if the devil say God Is Not A Healer you're wrong if the devil says amen you know I mean the devil the devil is wrong who I'm speaking of and whoever voices those kind of things oh we don't need a prophet what are you talking about the Bible said in the last day we shall have a prophet we've had a Prophet come on somebody you can't back down off that whether they believe it or see it or not you have to stand on the truth right right for it is here here I looked it up he said that earnestly fight for it is also a military combat term picturing hand toand combat that like a Roman soldier engaged with an enemy it becomes intensified amen you don't run you stand like there like a a a soldier now you say well brother books why are you bringing this to me cuz the pressure is coming amen you you and I we're being attacked by the devil in so many ways but now the devil is getting ready to attack what you believe see the World Council of churches and all of those churches they got everybody but us amen and they coming after us amen that's right now what would you say right he said brother books you on the air but it is what it is they already know my name my number and where I live right they know all of that so my point is this my day is coming and so your day is coming too contend for the faith amen right the mark of the beast is what in the head forehead and in the hand right you either Believe it or you're going to serve it amen right so we understand that we got to Be watchful the thoughts we entertain when it comes to these things and when the squeeze come in and they say this that and the other you say well I'm going to hide not in this day you can't hide because if you just say I know I don't believe it but you put your hand to it you just receive the mark amen H but understand this that this message even in this church Church everybody are not everybody is not a Believer and I don't know who everybody is but I do know one thing everybody in this church don't love Jesus you understand me there are those who are anointed with bad spirits and they don't even know that they are resisting Christ Jesus you said what do you mean Jew said for there are certain men crept in unawares who were both or were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ what are you talking about brother Brooks Jude must have been here my my point is he understood that these Spirits was going to time wasn't wasn't an element to uh imprison these Spirits they were going to be in the last days amen these are the spirits that were there among Moses amen you understand me same Spirits amen were there in Noah's day even though the Bible doesn't talking about it but you know that Noah amen became a laughing stock amen he preached the word and yet they were those who disagreed with him made fun of him made mockery of him right all the way down to only eight Souls were saved amen think about it you can't go with the majority and the thing about it even in this church I have to say this church because it's not just this church it's every one of them amen you got three kinds of Believers you just better know who you are amen and what you representing and you cannot allow other people whatever they're doing let them do it but you make sure you keep yourself holy amen you contend for the faith and sometimes it's going against the brother in your church or the sister in your church any questions what is lasciviousness unbridled sensu sensuality excess what are you talking about this is why we preach against the way people dress amen that's right because you are presenting something whether it's Holiness or unholiness godliness or ungodliness you're presenting something right and if I don't fight to keep that spirit because I'm not against the person I'm against the spirits that anointing the person you don't even know that you being anointed by a devil to dress or to look the way you're looking put it this way whatever you doing can it be done in heaven that's right Hallelujah and if it can't be done in heaven it shouldn't be done on Earth amen men and women right for the fleshly lust is against the Spirit In other words your flesh is going to fight the spiritual things that he knows that's right they fight each other your flesh want to look pretty your flesh want to look good so you wear those sexual sexual Central type of clothing that means your flesh won amen let me ask you a question there's a cuz I I want you to understand there's a many Hollywood stars in Hell amen and there are many so-called Christians in Hell amen you say well why because they allowed their flesh to rule that's right their flesh became their God is that right that's what the Bible said lovers of themselves and when you love yourself more than you love God you have made yourself an idol and your idol is you amen and the spirit against it wrestle all of us wrestle right all and I I'm not saying you know especially women women want to look good but you don't have to look sexy because when you allow yourself to look sexy you're out of the will of God your clothing is for a covering not to show off your figure Brethren too y'all understand what I'm saying I'm wrestling against flesh not flesh and blood but spiritual wickedness and listen it it's it's amazing that that I'm sure uh Noah had more than Sons and Daughters he had cousins that's right he had uncles amen and only his children and his wife came into the ark amen y' understand me all your loved ones ain't going to make it that's right because they're going to look at this gospel as being foolishness we don't have to do all of that that's right well that's what they say but I tell you what I'd rather find myself overdoing it than underdoing it Hallelujah so anyway these are the contrary the one to the other right the spirit and the flesh they fight all the time that you can you cannot do the things that you would that's what Paul said the good that I would I don't find myself doing it why I'm fighting all the time sometime the flesh win sometime the spirit wins right but that's why Paul said you must kill yourself every day you must die daily if you don't die daily the old man going to raise up and you going to deal with him all day that's right that's just the way it works but if you let be led of the spirit you are not under the law now the works of the flesh are manifested which are these adultery fornication and uncleanliness and lasciviousness what are you talking about when it comes to the enjoyment expressions or pursuit of physical or especially sexual pleasure now I'm saying this all of this is in Juds so you understand I'm just breaking down some of the words that's why you've always heard me say there's no such thing as sex sexual sexy Holiness that's right you understand me and the saddest thing is is that women who are put it this way is what God looks at because they are made differently Satan fashioned her amen you understand he's still fashioning her right with the big eyelashes all the colors of the hair the you know the implants and all that kind of stuff and when we find ourselves running after that we're not under the influence of the Holy Spirit come on somebody that's right there's nothing wrong with looking pretty but understand there is a balance to everything right so when you look at yourself and you see that you your way of dressing is going to cause somebody to lust that is not God and to any man that is Holy he is going to turn his head amen if he's got the Holy Ghost and if he don't he going to eat of Those Grapes that's all I can tell you he's going to do it right go to Galatians 5:1 13-18 we got to understand this is Jezebel religion the influence of Jezebel amen H the influence of Jezebel and Jezebel was a what a prostitute so the inspiration over the whole world is the spirit of Jezebel amen Jezebel versus Holiness that's right two different worlds Hallelujah and if you know the message Ahab and Jezebel came on the scene with with President Kennedy and his wife right it would have turned the tables but he was actually born in a in in the wrong season right so that's why he had to die but now that we see what we see now we understand right cuz brother bam done already told us what she going to look like let me tell y'all something I tell people I said what we got up there is a hyena that's right cuz a hyena always laughing that's right now hyena always laughing just just before it want to eat you that's right and it's right there to eat you alive and then laugh about it is that all right if God could call Herod a fox I can call that one a hyena that's right y'all know what I'm talking about woo let me stop before they start the flashing lights hanging out at my house Galatians 5 please this is a serious matter it really is y'all pray for me I'm praying for you all please pray for me I I I and the reason why I say that is because I see this thing and I don't want to come short either I don't want to be fooled by any Spirit that's not of God and all of us see let me tell you something you said well I left Egypt but don't you understand those Spirits didn't leave you uh those Spirits followed you amen you can be saved all you want to but those same old Spirits you entertainers came back and anointed the children of Israel and they got to dancing and party animal we're talking about the church and the whole time they were worshiping the what bull amen that's right now the bull is being worshiped again amen that's right for Brethren you have been called unto Liberty only use not your Liberty for the occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another and we do it we we we by Grace that's your Liberty but don't turn the grace of God into a disgrace oh yes God is going to forgive you but don't grieve the Holy Spirit God Has Feelings Hallelujah right but serve one another for all the laws is fulfilled in one word even in this thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself amen that's a big one amen how can you love yourself and not love your neighbor you got to love your neighbor right but if ye bite and devour one another take heed that you be not consumed one of another that's what the scripture says for example if I'm at war with you you send your bomb I'm going to send my bomb you send your bomb I'm going to send my bomb and all of a sudden one of one or the other is going to send the atomic amen blow you completely away amen because the war is here to steal the war is here to steal kill and to destroy am understand that I can't I cannot allow myself you know to to pacify anything young adults in Sodom you name it old people amen adults in Sodom you name it old people amen everything was in Sodom and everything was destroyed only because they did not hear the gospel that's right that was preached to them so God don't excuse us like that he told Timothy who was a young man flee useful lust useful lust amen right and don't let nobody talk down to you because of your gift because you young no no no no being young and gifted is a beautiful thing amen wisdom like I said doesn't come with age wisdom comes with the Holy ghost I'm too young I'm too young I can't do that I'm too young I'm sure a lot of people who died young and unsaved wish they were young and saved now y'all looking at me I'm preaching seriously amen for the flesh lusts against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these are contrary the one to the other I can't save nobody only Jesus can save you I'm here to preach to you but if I Don't Preach you truth God going to judge me I ain't going to go I rather you hate me I rather you not like me I rather you re oh we don't preach like that in the message that's why we got what we got and I know Spirits do that you you you can you can go to a camp meeting and I know Spirits do that you you can you can go to a camp meeting and all all the girls are all the guys that are bad going somehow find all the guys that are bad and all the bad girls going to find all the girls that are bad when I say bad I mean rebellious amen y'all looking at me like I'm crazy I've watched it they don't even know each other but they connect like mag magnets that's right watch what you are doing how you yoke yourself up with unbelievers keep yourself clean especially in the day that we're living amen Oh my he said believe I believe church and without a shadow of doubt this is a a is is burned on my heart that's the reason I'm looking for these five nights soon to Once uh to once more before it happens give the church are thorough combing through the Bible we're living in the shadow of the time it could happen anytime when we see the times comes for things to take place the very wickedness of the enemy the very Powers we look at these snowstorms and everything happening all these pestilence and all these different things that's all listen what he says that's all caused by these interruptions of Fire firing these bombs and things amen that's right look at the wars now they everywhere and they Shak in the world tornadoes hurricanes bigger now than ever because we've never had so many wars going on at one time with bombs and that you better listen is that right and listen the Bible talk about man who is foreordained oh to this condemnation that means you got people in your church that will never be saved amen they are foreordained to be Devils they're Devils who are they I don't know but that's the word that's what Jews say many of them are preachers did y'all understand me you know why it's so important that I stay with the word and stay with the true vision of God did y'all understand me you know why it's so important that I stay with the word and stay with the true vision of God why it's important cuz if a blind leader leavs the blind than the ditch if I don't keep my eyes open with to see things that are happening and come warn the church then what I'm doing is blinding you if I just PR you know politics or talk about everything else but Jesus Christ in this last day message how to escape is that right it's it this what we're trying we're talking about how to escape Nothing Else Matters this is going to go up in Fire and Flame but if you don't come to a place where you know how to how you can't run to the Rocks they go they can't hide you and you know I got a quote here today where brother R say they building dens our American government is building dens trying to hide from Egypt afterwards destroyed them that believe not so coming to this message is a wonderful thing but you got to continue believing we got people say oh brother BR was wrong here brother B was wrong there who give you the authority to correct him H who's in here greater as far as Ministry anybody not me I want to hide my my myself you know mean my between my legs my head because really I I can't stand not even next to him y'all understand what I'm saying and how I'm going to miss it if I'm following him or the leadership of him you know which is Jesus Christ how can I miss it when he made it amen that's right if your preacher makes it you make it amen that's why brother I'm said your preacher your pastor would lead you through but we looking at him are looking at your pastor like he doesn't even matter and we judge him I'm I'm coming to something here we judge him we look at him you see you you see his faults listen I don't think many of you would have believed brother brandham because he had faults too as a man now I ain't talking about the word now but as a man the Bible said Elijah was a man of Life passion that means he made mistakes too but God wasn't looking at the mistakes like he's not looking at yours he's looking at the commission what's in your heart like that old commercial say what's in your wallet the sword Cuts but it also heals y'all understand me Christians who fail to follow God chosen leader him whom God has sent amen now I'm no great man or God but I believe God sent me amen hallelujah and that's what's wrong with the people listen if you can't get the people in your church to believe that you're a true man of God sent by God you are wasting your time because they're not going to believe the word you're preaching even though it's not yours faith Faith oh if I could just touch the himym of His Garment y you understand me Paul Shadow was able to heal don't tell me that I don't have faith to heal because I've seen faith faith heal many people but if a person don't believe like they didn't believe in brother brandom they didn't believe in Jesus Jesus and in comparion I can't do many works here because they don't have faith that's the way it works you disrespect your your pastor there's no way you're going to have faith that he can do anything and I'm nobody but I know God ordained me amen that's right either I'm of God or I'm of the devil you make your choice let's turn to let's turn to uh num 16 I want you to understand the greatest deception among every church are the renowned men those who are educated those who can quote brother bradam like machine gun those who have intellectual abilities to to to to put things together where it seems so right but then they I'm going to tell you something we've got plenty of them here and look like the harder I preach the more the people rebel and you know when you Rebel you become a rebel right I'mma do this anyway I'm grown okay there many grown people in here I'm just telling you I'm going love love you anyway I love the rebels I have to love the rebels really I do I I'm not I'm just I realize now they have their portion of their part to play I've got my part they have their part at the end of the day we'll make make our journey they go what way and I go the other it is you got to love your enemy come on somebody brother brandham you know that's what I think Billy Paul testimony was you couldn't even tell brother brandom's enemy he knew who they were but he loved them so well it was the same with Jesus they didn't know who betrayed Jesus until Jesus told him told John he loved Judas just just as much and knew Judas was a devil from the point he he he chose him you can't you can't you know have favor are not those who are not you got to love everybody this is family as I keep saying this is family this is the way the family of God work the son of Levi Dayan and abam the son of elab and on the son of up before Moses with certain of the children of Israel 250 princes of the assembly famous in the congregation men of renown and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron and said unto them ye take too much upon you seeing all the congregations Are Holy every one of them and the Lord is among them therefore wherefore then lift up then lift ye up yourself above the congregation of the Lord and when Moses heard it he fell upon his face what they're attacking the servant of God not knowing they attacking God Amen and everybody that that attack Malachi for don't realize they're attacking God that's he's a servant of the Lord and so let me say it like this everybody that attack you is attacking God Amen is that right when Peter uh when Paul met Jesus on the road to Damascus Damascus he said who art thou Lord he said I'm Jesus amen and what what was pa uh Paul doing or Saul at that time he was persecuting Jesus Christ and when you persecute the body of Jesus Christ you are persecuting Jesus Christ right that's why when people offend you you must pray for them not in this term Lord avenge me of my adversary no to come near unto him even unto him whom he had chosen to come near unto him even unto him whom he had chosen will he cause to come near unto him now I want you to understand he's setting him up he's setting the Kora and all of the gang up and basically saying let's have a church service putting it in in in short form and while they was having a short form God comes down and guess what he did he opened the Earth up that's right he told he told those and basically said those of you who are on the on the Lord's Side come up y'all seen the Ten Commandment and and what happened amen they got swallowed up now everything on that movie is not correct scripturally but y'all know what I'm saying but anyway it it it it's it's it's something to understand that everybody and we better realize this those of them who fail to follow this message will be swallowed up by the California earthquake the Earth is going to open up once again and you know what brother random said he said right down at the bottom is Hell molten lava that's where they fall down into and who is Holy he called this generation Canon father why would he say that Canon father that means the bomb is going to get you that's the truth and what that's the truth and what people don't understand is that what what Grieves me what's really been troubling me me and all of them have been preserved because when they rejected the the call to the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it proved who they were now think about this all of those preachers afterwards became Mega preachers that's right and all that follow them except God allowed some to escape when they go to heav H they to go to hell with him just so you'll know this ain't no this ain't no game it's real let me use this last quote then I'll let you go we'll we'll work on it next time coming from the message the greatest battle ever fought paragraph 52 he says now do you know we've had Wars after wars and rumors of wars and if the Earth stands we have plenty more Wars but do you realize that there is really only two powers in all the universe of all our differences between nations and differences between each other and everything it's all Mount up to two Powers there's only two powers and there's only two kingdoms two Powers two kingdoms all the rest the little minor things are connected with either the one of those Powers uh one of those powers and those Powers is God's powers and Satan's Powers that's what every war every disorder everything that comes along is either controlled by God's power It came it changed his ministry and that Ministry began to kill the saints of God then it came into a power of black a black horse and that black horse begin to do what cause famine let me ask you a question what is it doing now amen that's right it's causing famine amen destroying the Farms destroying the pigs destroying the cows whatever the thing not only that but destroying your food by highb breeding it amen that's right and all of that is doing what destroying the people Hy breing it and all of that is doing what destroying the people oh he's about Soul destroying Souls amen the souls that are in prison now that's right there are people that are in prison now because they refus to Humble themselves amen right so you got to understand this is why you see uh uh the the the the uh uh what they call it the slavery and the child what they call it um selling children trafficking all they're trying to do do is stop the Royal seed when Jesus was was in in Bethlehem he started from the three years old in Dunder that's right right amen when Herod you know y'all y'all remember uh even even God knows them that are his only God right now let me move on and Satan only his powers he's got is the perverted power of God it isn't no real power it's a pervert I of God's power everything that Satan has death is only a perverted life a lie is only the truth M took told rather see adultery is an act misused righteousness are act misused see everything that Satan has got is something that has that was perverted but it's a power and we are today sitting here one of or or one or the other powers is going to control us listen to what he says so let us let's cast out the devil one let's take our pos position like the stars of Heaven the Bible speaks of wandering Stars over the book of Jude right forming out of their own shame and we don't want to be wandering Stars wondering if this is right wondering if that is right wondering if we if it would happen wondering see how it could be don't wonder stay with those stars of the heaven as real soldiers at its post of Duty stand there believing y y'all understand me so I I say this by the grace of God we find people trying to hide from God I'm going read this and I'll let you go find people trying to hide from God I'm going to read this and I'll let you go coming from the message of greater than Solomon's is here paragraph 178 I hope you you see what I'm doing here I'm trying to paint up people are digging holes down in the States they're going down government in the caves making government offices well that atomic bomb the one they got now that will burst the earth I believe it's three or 400 ft deep for 150 M Square where well if you was 10,000 ft under the Earth Plumb down into the lava it would break every bone in your body you can't dig away from it but we've got a bomb shelter it's not made of steel it's made of feathers under his wings amen he lifted up that's right for the bombs drop for that bomb's drop we're be in glory for that bomb's drop we're be in glory what's the matter now and then they'll say we're crazy oh if I'm crazy leave me like I am I feel better this way Hallelujah so just I I like to stay this way amen that's right if I'm crazy let me be crazy but like I said nobody will be able to say brother Brooks didn't tell you the truth and I I I don't have a family for that very reason have I been perfect Within Myself absolutely not but I know truth and I just hate to see people moving on with religion and haven't had a real birth that's scary to me that that that frightens me because you know I'm always checking myself to make sure I got the real deal always because I don't want to be religious I want to be life other down somebody trying to get up on the top and we pull them down that's not God one it's all about Divine love the Bible said love covers a multitude of sin we don't backbite each

everything and I try not to but I can't help it it's just part of what I do but I see people they act like they scared to shake each other's hand all kinds of stuff and I'm like where's the love of God Holy Ghost to let that woman wash his feet right to let that woman wash his feet right he wasn't worried about lust because he had a force he was fortified Holy Ghost filled you understand me lust comes when your mind is perverted but to the pure all things are pure that's it but when your mind is perverted you always thinking that way that somebody is after you ain't nobody after you but the devil and y'all must realize amen that's the wall of the the devil to think evil of somebody without a cause even if you feel like you have a cause you have no right to think evil you see your brother your sister overtaken in the fault you do what not humble us but cause us to Humble ourselves because we don't want you to Humble us Lord that's a rough way but if we give give us the grace to Humble ourselves it becomes much easier bless this congregation it's not many of us here tonight which is the norm but I pray those who do come that you would give them a double portion of your spirit that you would give them a greater Zeal to serve you help us dear Jesus because this is a battle Beyond battles this is the greatest of all battles throughout the ages we have come in the worst time ever
