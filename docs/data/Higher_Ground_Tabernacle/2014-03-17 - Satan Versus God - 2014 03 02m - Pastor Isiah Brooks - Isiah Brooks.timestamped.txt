[19:38] just started on power of
[19:42] Satan's and uh we showed you uh by the
[19:46] grace of God how that this illusion is
[19:51] is so
[19:53] powerful has become the delusion of the
[19:56] whole
[19:57] world uh
[20:00] only because the Bible said they had not
[20:02] a
[20:04] love because they didn't have a love the
[20:07] truth God gave them over to a
[20:09] strong that they might be liive I had a
[20:13] brother I talked with last
[20:16] night
[20:19] uh from Diana South America coming end
[20:23] of
[20:25] ail part
[20:27] of uh
[20:29] he called and said a good friend of here
[20:33] called and said no longer believe this
[20:37] m and
[20:41] basically you know even need the Holy
[20:44] Ghost
[20:45] that's the Bible said if you got the
[20:47] Holy Ghost guide you
[20:50] all you know it all depends on what
[20:53] you a lot of people saw
[20:57] Moses but only a few people saw God
[21:00] behind and that was Joshua and C come on
[21:03] anybody know anybody knows a perfect man
[21:07] there's only one as Jesus Christ it
[21:10] won't be any other outside of Jesus
[21:12] Christ that's going to be perfect I
[21:14] don't care how you try your best he's
[21:17] the only
[21:19] one and our Perfection is in him is that
[21:22] all right amen so we're going to uh come
[21:26] by the grace of God to uh we're going to
[21:28] read a scripture this morning we second
[21:31] part of this message but we want to call
[21:33] it God versus Satan or Satan versus God
[21:37] uh but we're going to start reading uh
[21:40] the scripture according to Isaiah
[21:44] 664 Isaiah 66 and4
[21:58] this is a pressing time hard
[22:02] pressing yes and so you've got to know
[22:05] what you believing in you got to know
[22:07] what you got on the inside of you and
[22:10] I'm so grateful this morning to know him
[22:14] to know of him to know who he is and to
[22:17] know that he's living on the inside of
[22:19] me amen the same one that created heaven
[22:22] and earth the same one that created all
[22:25] things is living in me he's not not only
[22:28] my Creator but he's my God and he is my
[22:34] husband that might sound a little weird
[22:36] but it's true
[22:38] anyhow amen so let us turn to Isaiah 66
[22:43] and4 amen glad to see everybody here
[22:46] this
[22:48] morning it reads I will choose their
[22:52] delusions and will bring their fears
[22:55] upon them because when I call none did
[22:59] answer when I spake they did not hear
[23:03] but they did evil before mine eyes and
[23:07] chose in which I delighted not hear the
[23:12] word of the Lord ye that tremble at his
[23:14] word your brethren that hateth you that
[23:18] cast you out for my name's
[23:20] sake says let the Lord be glorified but
[23:24] he shall appear to your joy and they
[23:27] shall be ashamed
[23:29] name Hallelujah is that all right surely
[23:33] will let let us just pray father God we
[23:35] come before you Lord as humbl we know
[23:37] how we thank you for your grace and your
[23:39] mercy Lord we pray father that you would
[23:42] break the bread of life this morning we
[23:44] pray that you would have preeminence
[23:46] Lord bless those who desire to come this
[23:49] morning and could not make it I pray for
[23:51] those oh God our Father who's being
[23:54] distracted Lord away from the promises
[23:56] of God help us right now Lord God in
[23:59] your name Jesus that we'll be mainly
[24:01] focused on you Lord granted in the name
[24:04] of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen
[24:07] you may be seated we like to uh just uh
[24:12] uh thank God for his goodness um as we
[24:16] said we we're living in a time where
[24:18] it's becoming more difficult uh for
[24:21] people to see and to understand uh the
[24:24] times that we're living in I I don't
[24:27] know how come but you know uh why some
[24:30] can and some can't other than election
[24:34] you know that's the only thing I can
[24:35] rest upon uh because I haven't been such
[24:38] a great man of God that I feel like I
[24:42] can Merit his goodness all I know is
[24:45] that it's been the grace of God is why
[24:48] I'm standing here and I just want to
[24:51] basically brag on him this morning a
[24:53] little bit uh because he is all that he
[24:57] said he is and he's far much more than
[25:01] that I kind of really like that message
[25:03] brother uh digs BR uh he's a god of
[25:06] adjectives I can't get that out of my
[25:08] head because every time I need a as a
[25:11] problem arise I say he's a god of
[25:13] adjectives amen I can put Almighty up
[25:16] there I can put Jehovah Tyra whatever I
[25:18] want to put in front of his name he is
[25:20] all of that
[25:22] amen so the Bible tells us that he's a
[25:25] present help in time of need now we said
[25:28] last week that Illusions is something
[25:30] that deceives by producing a false or or
[25:35] or a
[25:36] misleading impression of reality
[25:40] something that you think it's right when
[25:42] it's wrong and we wanted to say by the
[25:45] grace of God that we understand what's
[25:47] happening nowadays the greater Falling
[25:50] Away we saw uh the move of Kenny copelin
[25:53] last week did we not amen how that he
[25:57] received this powerful
[25:59] message powerful message from the pope
[26:02] and then you know he thought it was one
[26:03] of the greatest things that ever
[26:05] happened oh he said about how many years
[26:08] 20 30 40 years ago this would not have
[26:10] been possible but what he didn't
[26:13] understand is that Spirit was working on
[26:14] it from that point on But the saddest
[26:17] thing is is that they are given over to
[26:19] a strong delusion no doubt these men who
[26:23] are now prosperous they seem to be great
[26:26] men of God speaking in tongues and all
[26:28] of these crazy things that they call the
[26:32] evidence not that speaking in tongues is
[26:35] crazy but what they call the
[26:38] evidence uh uh you know the prophet of
[26:40] God said this morning I heard him he
[26:42] says why on Earth did the Pentecostal
[26:44] ever do that make the evidence of the
[26:47] Holy Ghost speaking in tongue and what
[26:49] did they do they open up the doorway of
[26:52] devils y'all hear what I'm saying amen
[26:55] because I can remember even in the
[26:57] church that I went to there were people
[26:58] who spoke in tongues amen and would
[27:01] carry pistol to
[27:02] church yeah oh curse you out and
[27:06] everything else they would do but they
[27:08] could speak in tongu they could shout
[27:10] they could run down the aisle they could
[27:11] do all of those things that we call the
[27:14] Holy
[27:15] Ghost hello somebody and I'm not saying
[27:18] the Holy Ghost don't do those things but
[27:21] it is the Life of
[27:22] Christ whether you speak in tongues
[27:25] whether you shout whether you dance
[27:27] whether you run up and down the aisle as
[27:29] long as you know you've been changed you
[27:31] say Brothers how I know I've Been
[27:33] Changed cuz I'm not what I ought to be
[27:35] I'm not what I used to be hello amen you
[27:40] know but and you know you've gone from
[27:42] Death unto life something has happened
[27:45] on the inside of you and you're no
[27:47] longer the same person that you used to
[27:49] be that's beautiful amen it is a growing
[27:53] process amen you don't come to
[27:55] Perfection overnight even though the
[27:58] perfectors inside amen it is you who
[28:01] need to be perfected not
[28:03] him so he's working on the inside of us
[28:07] amen bringing us Amen to a place of
[28:09] perfection and let me say it like this
[28:11] you're gold and I keep saying that
[28:13] Revelations 3 gold tried in the fire why
[28:17] do we feel like we're going to come to a
[28:19] time and a place of picnics and holidays
[28:21] and oh all of those things when God said
[28:24] this age is a age of fire a age where
[28:27] you going to be tried all the time
[28:30] tested all the
[28:32] time hello somebody and you said amen
[28:36] I'm coming Lord I want to be that gold
[28:39] tried in the fire amen so the Bible said
[28:42] think it not strange when you fall into
[28:44] diverse Temptation knowing that the tri
[28:46] of your faith is what more precious than
[28:49] gold gold fine gold however you want to
[28:52] say it amen because realize amen what we
[28:55] are now developing or grow going into is
[29:00] eternal I can't explain it I just know
[29:04] that it
[29:05] is now we're going to read uh by the
[29:08] grace of God let us turn to Isaiah
[29:11] 14 Isaiah 14 I'm going to show you
[29:14] something uh hopefully the Lord will
[29:16] it's nothing uh so deep but I when I was
[29:19] reading this the holy spirit says
[29:22] something to me and I'm going to say it
[29:23] to you what the way he said it to me
[29:26] amen so I I I'm looking Isaiah the 14th
[29:29] chapter and the 12th verse we're
[29:30] speaking of Lucifer I actually don't
[29:33] like calling him that but because the
[29:35] Bible says Lucifer I read it that way
[29:38] he's a
[29:39] devil Lucifer sound like you know a
[29:42] prince you know what I mean amen how art
[29:45] thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son
[29:49] of the morning how art thou cut down to
[29:52] the ground which did weaken the Nations
[29:55] for thou H has said in thine heart I
[29:58] will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my
[30:00] throne above the stars of God I will set
[30:03] also upon the Mount of the congregation
[30:05] in the sides of the north brother bradam
[30:07] said he did it he is the God of this
[30:10] evil age he is now setting above the
[30:14] stars of God fallen
[30:17] stars I will Ascend above the heights of
[30:20] the
[30:21] cloud I will be like the most high yet
[30:26] thou shall be brought down to hell to
[30:29] the size of the pit now I want you to
[30:31] understand what this is what's happening
[30:33] you know the holy spirit said locked in
[30:37] there Lucifer Satan is locked in this
[30:43] scripture he can't get out of it he's in
[30:46] prison where the scripture sets us free
[30:50] the scripture places him behind
[30:53] bars he's literally locked into the
[30:56] scripture that there is no
[31:01] remixing
[31:03] revising this is
[31:06] it I will Ascend above the heights of
[31:08] the clouds I will be like the most high
[31:12] yet thou shall be brought down to Hell
[31:14] to the sze of the pit they that see thee
[31:18] shall narrowly look upon thee and
[31:21] consider the saying is this the man that
[31:25] made the Earth to tremble that did shape
[31:28] kingdoms one of the most humiliating
[31:31] things I've ever seen amen even in
[31:34] Hollywood is when someone sets a trap
[31:37] for someone else and they end up falling
[31:40] into the Trap themselves and that's how
[31:43] it is with Lucifer that's how it is with
[31:45] the Devil the Trap he set for us has
[31:48] become his own trap the ditch he dug for
[31:50] us has become his own ditch so you and I
[31:54] must realize amen if this scripture how
[31:57] many of y'all believe this scripture is
[31:58] right he can't go beyond it the this
[32:02] scripture it is his boundaries he cannot
[32:05] PR Prosper he can't go no further than
[32:08] the word has declared he can go now
[32:11] let's move on they that see him see thee
[32:15] shall narrowly look upon thee and
[32:16] consider you saying is this the man that
[32:18] made the Earth to tremble that did Shake
[32:20] kingdoms I wish people could read that
[32:22] word man and they can understand the
[32:24] serpen SE a little bit that made the
[32:27] world as the Wilderness and destroyed
[32:29] the cities thereof that open not the
[32:31] house of his
[32:33] prisoners thank God for Christ if the
[32:36] Lord Jesus had not conquered death and
[32:38] hell and the grave we would still be in
[32:41] prison even those who died in the anian
[32:44] day because Lucifer devil will not open
[32:48] his prison door it took the
[32:50] Messiah it took Christ himself to go
[32:53] open the prison door took the keys of
[32:55] death hell and the grave and loosed see
[32:58] so therefore no man can say God there
[33:01] was no way made for
[33:03] me all the kings of the Nations even all
[33:06] of them lie in glory everyone in his own
[33:10] house but Thou Art cast out of thy grave
[33:14] like an abominable branch and as a
[33:16] remnant of those that are slain thrust
[33:19] through with the sword that go down to
[33:22] the stones of the pit as a carcass trod
[33:25] under feet thou shall not be joined with
[33:27] them burial because thou has destroyed
[33:30] thy land and slain thy people the seed
[33:33] of the evildoers shall never be renowned
[33:36] I don't care how great it looks this
[33:38] world look like they're on top of
[33:40] everything they will never be renowned
[33:44] with God prepare listen all of this all
[33:48] that you see all of this what we call
[33:50] Prosperity all of this thing we call
[33:52] Glamour all of this thing that we call
[33:55] uh wealth will be destroyed
[33:58] everything will go down with
[34:01] Lucifer and and you you got to
[34:04] understand now why people in the new age
[34:07] and why people in this luciferian
[34:10] worship why they think he is God because
[34:15] what they do they twist the scripture
[34:18] they make him the winner they make Cain
[34:21] the real seed they they they twist
[34:24] everything and makes it a lie so they
[34:27] really
[34:28] believe by way they see things Lucifer
[34:32] really is
[34:33] God because in this day and age evil
[34:38] prevails according to the Natural Eye
[34:41] y'all hear what I'm saying so how can
[34:42] you say look where's Christianity on the
[34:45] bottom of the totem pole you see what
[34:47] I'm saying and look where all of the
[34:49] wickedness is evil has become
[34:51] good right and it's just it's his his
[34:54] way of deceiving but thank God we have a
[34:57] prophet that described and told us what
[35:01] this age was he said this was Satan's
[35:05] Eden this is Satan's Paradise now if
[35:09] this
[35:10] is if this is the best he can
[35:13] do God have mercy on those who follow
[35:17] him the Bible says amen if a man have
[35:21] hope only in this world he is most of
[35:25] all most men miserable of all me most
[35:28] miserable is that right so we realize
[35:30] amen if all your trust all your hope all
[35:34] is in this world you're
[35:36] miserable that's why the Bible says set
[35:38] your affection on things above I'm
[35:41] telling you people that's the only thing
[35:43] that's going to keep you with joy is
[35:45] when you began to focus on Calvary focus
[35:48] on the coming of the Lord focus on the
[35:50] kingdom that is here and is to come
[35:53] that's what keeps you in Joy with God
[35:56] enjoying with God is that right but look
[36:00] what he says now at the 20th verse says
[36:03] Thou sht not be joined with them in bual
[36:06] because thou has destroyed the land and
[36:09] slain thy people the seed of the
[36:12] evildoer shall never be renowned I don't
[36:15] care how many time they call them
[36:18] Divas those Divas are
[36:21] devils and I don't care how much glim
[36:24] glitter and Glamour and diamonds and all
[36:27] all of these things they're all going up
[36:29] in fire y'all hear what I'm saying he
[36:32] said it won't be water it's going to be
[36:36] fire so what what are we what are we
[36:38] looking for that's why the Bible said if
[36:40] you seek first the kingdom of God and is
[36:43] righteousness all things all things will
[36:46] be added why because it's yours
[36:50] anyhow it really is it's ours now my my
[36:54] thing is is that I find out that so many
[36:57] people
[36:58] we're coming in this last day I'm going
[36:59] to tell you something the storm that's
[37:01] coming folks you better believe you got
[37:05] to have
[37:06] something this storm that's coming Ain't
[37:08] No No Light Whirlwind come on somebody
[37:12] it is going to be a real tough time if
[37:14] you think it's hard now give it if the
[37:16] Lord car give it a few more
[37:18] years I hope not but that's just my
[37:21] personal thing because I believe no one
[37:25] there's not one one person added
[37:28] all that can be saved will be saved not
[37:31] one person is added to this bride not
[37:35] one it's not my will but his will and
[37:38] all that the father has given will come
[37:43] that that's just it now I'm working with
[37:45] something because I want you to
[37:47] understand Satan has always defied God
[37:51] and the Lord knew he would but now the
[37:54] thing about it is in our age s has come
[37:58] in a more subtle way he's not taking us
[38:01] to the
[38:02] guillotine burning us at the stake or
[38:04] anything like that he's giving us
[38:08] science and science takes away your
[38:12] faith it has been science it has been
[38:15] the reasoning you know it is like people
[38:18] wants to update God's
[38:21] word there's no such thing God's word
[38:25] has it just doesn't need need updating
[38:29] it is God you can't revise it he's the
[38:33] same yesterday today and forever
[38:36] Hallelujah and the thing is you and I
[38:38] must learn to truly trust in him I said
[38:42] that about Lucifer I said that about his
[38:44] seed because you understand his seed is
[38:47] locked into the same scripture he's in
[38:49] like God's seed is locked into the same
[38:52] scripture God is in everything that
[38:55] applies to Jesus Christ applied to the
[38:57] SE need of God everything what He Is We
[39:01] are in this present world is that the
[39:03] word and what the devil's children are
[39:06] is what they are saints of God they
[39:09] can't
[39:11] change you know a corn can't turn into a
[39:14] weak it is what it
[39:16] is but thank God that God has given you
[39:20] ears to hear you know we have we have we
[39:24] have we have we have come to a place and
[39:26] and we work with this uh we work with
[39:28] denominational people all the time and
[39:31] you know we don't want to dechristianize
[39:33] them but I want you to understand what
[39:35] the prophet of God said he said that
[39:37] they are truly worshiping the devil not
[39:39] knowing
[39:41] it and if they're worshiping the devil
[39:44] and not know it you're the light of the
[39:46] world excuse me don't mean the point
[39:47] you're the light of the world and you're
[39:49] the only one that can show them the
[39:52] difference hello somebody it cuz we got
[39:56] to look Beyond Rel ReliOn and seek for
[39:59] election y'all hear what I'm saying it
[40:02] is the election that brought you out it
[40:04] is the election that gave you ears to
[40:06] hear it is the election that opened your
[40:08] eyes it wasn't your intellect or
[40:10] anything it was
[40:13] election it's not what we do for him
[40:15] it's what he's done for us we are under
[40:18] the abrahamic Covenant don't ever forget
[40:21] that because I'm going to tell you
[40:23] something that is the
[40:24] illusion remember I told you we showed
[40:27] you how the pope kept calling uh Kenny
[40:29] copel and brotherr and you know Brethren
[40:32] and you know who's the blame you know we
[40:34] all come short and Jesus Christ is the
[40:37] flattery and I showed you in Daniel the
[40:40] 12th chapter the word of God said he
[40:42] would come in with flatteries but the
[40:45] Bible call him vile you go out there and
[40:48] tell somebody that the pope that's in
[40:50] office right now is vile they'll think
[40:52] you
[40:54] crazy but the Bible said he'll be vile
[40:58] amen
[41:00] unclean and he's got a wicked intent
[41:03] behind
[41:06] him oh but you see the cathic can speak
[41:08] in tongues now
[41:10] too right right this is something uh uh
[41:15] uh uh we we know to be true and yet
[41:19] we're looking at this
[41:22] thing we looking at this thing and we're
[41:24] almost like I don't know whether the
[41:26] people are just trying to close eyes to
[41:27] it or what but why I'm preaching on this
[41:30] is because that's what's happening
[41:32] prophecy is being made clear through the
[41:35] events that we are now
[41:37] undertaking you know I had a pastor
[41:39] brother tell me he says oh brother I'm
[41:40] so glad you sent me that article he said
[41:42] because he said I know what knew it was
[41:44] happening but it made me feel so good to
[41:46] see now it really is happening we're in
[41:50] a uniting and it's so amazing because
[41:52] God inspired me to preach that message
[41:54] on Unity not knowing what was going on
[41:58] behind the scen now my point is if they
[42:01] are uniting you and I must unite not by
[42:05] church membership but by the Holy
[42:09] Ghost I was listening to choosing of a
[42:12] bride brother BR called those people
[42:13] down he said cry out to God as if you're
[42:17] dying that's what he said
[42:20] quote cry out to God as if you are dying
[42:24] as if this is your last time
[42:28] come on he somebody now if that was what
[42:31] he instructed them to do what about
[42:34] us we're too starch we too stiff we too
[42:38] proud We too a little bit of everything
[42:40] we got too much of us living
[42:44] still hey somebody you don't have to do
[42:47] that here go home somewhere get in your
[42:49] car ride down the road find you some
[42:52] bushes whatever but you need to break
[42:55] through that's the most important thing
[42:57] he said listen he said they will do it
[42:59] when the squeeze come he said they'll do
[43:01] it but it'll be too
[43:03] late you can't wait till the squeeze
[43:05] come to cry out he said that's exactly
[43:09] what what uh uh uh Esau did sold his
[43:12] Birthright he cried and he couldn't
[43:14] break through at the
[43:17] time see now is the time well I got to
[43:21] find you cannot the devil is not going
[43:23] to give you time to
[43:25] find he's taking taking your time you
[43:28] got to take your time you see what I'm
[43:31] saying you got to make it you got to
[43:32] drop it you got to you got to cease
[43:34] whatever and this is what you must
[43:37] do all
[43:41] right God didn't send the children of
[43:43] Israel into battle till after the day of
[43:47] Pentecost Holy Ghost and Fire you're
[43:50] going to have power after which the Holy
[43:52] Ghost he didn't send them into battle
[43:54] and God can't move until you the bride
[43:57] until we all sealed away and I believe
[44:00] that's the hindrance it ain't the preach
[44:03] it ain't the Deacon it ain't the Usher
[44:04] it's you and I we've got to be
[44:07] completely sealed away he can't move we
[44:11] got his hands tied we locked in the
[44:14] scripture y'all hear what I'm saying
[44:16] we're
[44:18] locked and until that is made manifest
[44:21] Amen in every true bride of seed life we
[44:25] ain't going nowhere amen
[44:30] am I making
[44:32] sense oh it is an illusion and that's
[44:35] what he's done he's made he's given us a
[44:37] lot of
[44:38] religion to make us think we're all
[44:42] right oh people the grace of God Reigns
[44:45] on the just and the unjust you can't say
[44:47] oh well I ain't doing so bad come on

[45:05] ashamed to say I need more of

[45:20] deceived serving diverse lust and
[45:23] Pleasures living in Malice and and EAS
[45:27] uh uh

[45:34] H malice and envy yes hateful and hating
[45:38] one
[45:41] another hey were we not it's not what we
[45:44] supposed to be now the Bible said we
[45:47] once were we there was some time we did
[45:50] it all all of us did
[45:52] it but we got to be careful in this age
[45:56] Galatians 37 says be not
[45:59] deceived God is Not mocked but
[46:02] whatsoever a man
[46:04] Seth that shall he also read That's the
[46:10] Law that is absolutely law you cannot s
[46:13] something and expect not an in turn a
[46:16] incoming it's you're going to reap
[46:21] it oh I'm a preacher that don't make no
[46:23] difference I'm a deacon that don't make
[46:25] no difference I'm a bishop that don't
[46:26] make no difference we all will have to
[46:30] give account for the Deeds Done in our
[46:34] bodies hello somebody it's true
[46:38] anyhow Now understand what's going to
[46:40] happen if we don't seek
[46:43] repentance if we you me I don't care you
[46:47] know what Satan started off in church
[46:49] too don't you ever think amen well you
[46:52] know oh that brother fell away oh so did
[46:54] Lucifer
[46:57] huh he was he was the he was the choir
[46:59] director whatever he was amen he was the
[47:02] head of music and everything else so he
[47:04] fell away were they surprised maybe some
[47:07] of the Angels were God
[47:10] wasn't and if Lucifer can follow away
[47:13] what what Paul said let me be careful
[47:16] lest I myself find myself a gast away I
[47:20] got to be careful Paul said the angel to
[47:23] the Ephesus Church a had to be careful
[47:26] he had to Works walk
[47:30] circumspectly now we're in a place we
[47:32] must redeem the time we done lost so
[47:35] much time playing with God playing come
[47:38] on somebody oh we done lost so much time
[47:42] think about God's grace now we don't
[47:44] lost so much time amen just just doing
[47:47] whatever not the will of God but our own
[47:53] will well I'm going tell you if we don't
[47:55] repent what's going to happen to you 2
[47:57] Timothy uh 3:13 but evil men and
[48:01] seducers shall wax worse and worse
[48:05] deceiving and being deceived in other
[48:08] words there's no listen if you don't
[48:11] repent you and I of whatever it may be
[48:14] guess what you don't get better you're
[48:16] going to get worse
[48:20] amen huh repentance keeps you from
[48:23] getting worse it cleanses you
[48:29] of the spirit that makes you
[48:33] evil a Meek man is one who does the will
[48:36] of
[48:37] God that's why Moses was so Meek he was
[48:40] the meekest of all men because he did
[48:42] the will of God Jesus was me because he
[48:45] did the will of God blessed are the
[48:50] meat oh my God help us Lord cuz I want
[48:53] you to understand you're doing this or
[48:56] the other you're either serving God or
[48:58] you're serving the devil I was telling
[49:00] the brother the other day I saids Lord
[49:01] help me I said in everything my music my
[49:04] everything that I listen to Everything I
[49:06] Do I said because I want you to
[49:08] understand there's only one way of
[49:09] worshiping God and that's in spirit and
[49:11] in
[49:13] truth it might be spiritual oh I feel
[49:16] the anointing but is it
[49:18] true see it it's things that God has
[49:21] been waking me up to amen the reality of
[49:24] what Satan is doing is an illusion he
[49:27] makes it look spiritual when it's not
[49:30] think about the bride and and versus the
[49:32] lean Church age group they literally
[49:36] they thought they were actually
[49:37] worshiping
[49:39] God they were brother said it was
[49:42] Christian
[49:44] lyrics to Rock and
[49:47] Roll it's true anyhow we got to repent
[49:53] Hallelujah and and you know that it's
[49:55] just amazing because they thought they
[49:57] were going to go up but it was though
[50:00] the spirit was right the truth the word
[50:04] was wrong so it took him down instead of
[50:12] up am I making sense see listen your joy
[50:17] doesn't come by way of Music your joy
[50:19] comes by way of the Holy Ghost music
[50:22] might have stimulated but it's supposed
[50:24] to be something that you should supposed
[50:25] to have supposed to have
[50:27] anyhow hey somebody come on I was
[50:30] telling I think it was Brother Rich I
[50:32] said when I came out here God stripped
[50:33] me from everything cuz he knew how much
[50:35] I love music he knew how much I love to
[50:37] sing he knew and he stripped me of
[50:40] everything no music no nothing ain't no
[50:43] fine choir
[50:46] here H we barely making the Joyful
[50:51] Noise y'all hear what I'm saying and God
[50:55] come I told him I said but see God knows
[50:58] I love him more than
[51:00] anything Hallelujah hey I can worship
[51:03] him even without all of that I love him
[51:08] anyhow he took it cuz he wanted to see
[51:11] how much I loved him do you love me more
[51:14] than what you can do see because
[51:15] sometime we think amen because we can do
[51:18] things you know we got a feather
[51:20] somewhere God done put no no there were
[51:23] Angels way before you and me people
[51:25] could saying five better than you and I
[51:28] amen and where are they in
[51:33] hell but take that man or that woman who
[51:35] can't hardly hold a tomb but it's coming
[51:38] from the
[51:39] heart that's spirit and that's
[51:44] trueu y'all hear what I'm saying when
[51:46] it's all said and done we're not in
[51:49] caves do you think they had a a grand
[51:52] organ in in a cave and a piano all of
[51:55] these things they didn't have the big
[51:56] tamarine in the cave they trying to keep
[52:00] quiet and even when they couldn't sing
[52:04] they had
[52:06] Joy hey somebody that's joy unspeakable
[52:11] joy so much so they were willing to run
[52:13] to the
[52:14] Lions W come on somebody oh people if we
[52:18] can see the delusion Satan got our minds
[52:21] in the wrong places and then we come to
[52:24] show and declare that Jesus Christ is is
[52:26] God not by the emotional sin but by the
[52:30] word and the life that he's want to live
[52:32] through
[52:35] US anybody can jump and
[52:40] Shout is that
[52:42] okay Luke 2218 says and he said take
[52:46] heed that you be not deceived for many
[52:50] shall come in my name saying I am Christ
[52:54] and the time draweth near here go ye not
[52:58] therefore after them all right so he
[53:01] said there many going to come saying
[53:03] that I am Christ you know I honestly
[53:05] honestly I there were so many great old
[53:09] singers I I I liked and um I'm trying to
[53:12] think of the one that I really liked and
[53:15] I I've sang some of her songs then I
[53:18] began to watch her and God moving on
[53:21] YouTube and she moved from the plain
[53:24] face to makeup and then from makeup to
[53:27] cutting the hair and yet now she's
[53:29] singing a little bit of jazz I sung a
[53:32] song in Africa and I was wondering why
[53:34] the people weren't playing for me and
[53:36] afterwards they said no brother that's
[53:38] Jazz now I didn't know
[53:40] it I honestly didn't know
[53:43] it but that's what they told me and when
[53:47] I when they told me I I hadn't sang it
[53:52] since they could know by what I was
[53:55] doing it was was Jazz but listen I
[53:57] didn't know that was
[53:59] Jazz but I was
[54:02] edicated and I'm glad that God gave it
[54:04] to me right amen he could have left me
[54:07] going on listen and I've sang that song
[54:09] many times and the anointing would
[54:14] fall might have been Spirit but it
[54:16] wasn't
[54:18] truth oh y'all getting quiet on me now
[54:21] cuz I'm telling you the
[54:24] truth brother bam listen a lot of people
[54:27] said well why a fing that Prophet no
[54:29] more I never followed him he was going
[54:32] off the scene I followed Jesus it was
[54:36] the Jesus Christ he preached I
[54:38] followed yeah I making sense how can you
[54:41] follow brother brand he ain't
[54:45] here it was the Lord Jesus the message
[54:48] the word that I
[54:52] followed wo but let's look at what he
[54:55] says in this quote some somebody sent me
[54:57] a precious brother he said but I want to
[54:59] bring another thing into your uh into
[55:03] your
[55:04] remembrance if God sent the messenger
[55:07] and Vindicated it by the signs that he
[55:11] was the messenger sent from God then
[55:15] it's up to them to obey this message
[55:19] exactly they must obey the
[55:24] messenger and have
[55:27] they must obey the messenger and have
[55:29] respect to the
[55:31] messenger see look at Joshua and Caleb
[55:34] they stayed right by his side yes sir
[55:38] whatever Moses was in they was in it too
[55:43] whether Moses was right or wrong they
[55:46] stayed right with him anyhow see because
[55:50] they know that that was God's messenger
[55:58] well brother B was off here brother B
[56:00] was off here but was he God's messenger
[56:03] see I I'm not looking at perfection in
[56:05] the man I'm looking at the perfection in
[56:07] the word y'all hear what I'm saying my
[56:10] point is this do you know anybody who
[56:13] had the Messiah sign outside of William
[56:21] Brandon was anybody able he and all of
[56:24] the rest of them anybody able to go down
[56:27] into the hearts of your life years when
[56:31] you were a child and said listen when
[56:33] you were a child your nervous condition
[56:34] is because you was a you you got
[56:36] startled and you know a dog made
[56:38] you
[56:40] anybody anybody today doing that he said
[56:44] it'll never be another gift like that
[56:47] and from since he went on to be in glory
[56:49] there's never been another gift that way
[56:52] what is it it wasn't the man it was
[56:55] Jesus Christ back behind the man and
[56:58] listen I'm not smart enough to know
[57:01] where he was in
[57:05] air well let me put it this way God told
[57:09] Elijah he said you go tell the tell tell
[57:12] the those who follow ba you scream and
[57:15] holler and and and why don't you
[57:18] just now he was teaching them a false
[57:23] worship he was teaching them a false
[57:25] worship well you go beat yourself and do
[57:28] all this and that he said go do that
[57:30] let's see if he answer the whole time
[57:33] he's keeping his cool building his altar
[57:35] putting the water on it and everything
[57:37] else see because he realized the word
[57:40] was being restored and it was the
[57:43] restored word that brings God down that
[57:46] brings the fire down
[57:49] [Music]
[57:54] Hallelujah and look at him now you know
[57:56] it's true you know you look at it and
[57:58] there's a balance in everything but you
[58:00] look at how people are now beating
[58:02] themselves and carrying on you know and
[58:04] doing all they can people of God uh it
[58:07] was in 1973 74 I had a music music
[58:11] teacher that told me one of these old
[58:13] days they'll be dancing
[58:15] choreographically in the
[58:17] churches and they're doing
[58:21] it and they think that's
[58:24] God what a deception
[58:27] women with leotard and all that kind of
[58:29] stuff on y'all hear what I'm saying and
[58:31] they really think that's
[58:33] [Applause]
[58:35] God what an
[58:37] apostasy and nowadays if you don't have
[58:40] a a praise team or a worship team you
[58:43] ain't in it you ain't with it come on up
[58:47] that ain't up that's
[58:49] down amen but they think that's God all
[58:53] that is the effect of Hollywood and
[58:56] Satan Satan's
[58:59] illusion
[59:01] listen I'm going on now he says listen
[59:04] you got to love your
[59:07] pastor you got to know that he's a human
[59:10] being but God has made him his Pastor
[59:14] God made him his Pastor the Holy Ghost
[59:18] has made him overseer then you've got to
[59:21] respect him in that manner and no matter
[59:25] what the past is done if you respect him
[59:29] in your
[59:30] heart as God's servant God will respect
[59:34] you for doing it message respect
[59:38] Jeffersonville
[59:41] 1061 you know you know because a lot of
[59:44] time it's true folks y'all know this is
[59:46] true in the message churches pastors get
[59:49] the least
[59:50] respect he's a brother and we leave him
[59:53] there that's why a lot of time people
[59:55] have Brothers have said okay don't
[59:57] address me as brother no more address me
[59:59] as Pastor I I'm not asking for that but
[1:00:02] my point is sometime people get
[1:00:05] confused and they forget the office that
[1:00:08] the man of God holds and they fail to
[1:00:10] see that he's the angel to the
[1:00:15] church he is the Angel to the church I
[1:00:18] didn't make me this no Pastor makes
[1:00:21] himself most Pastor want to
[1:00:24] run God knows is knows this the truth
[1:00:27] I'm standing in the Holy pit of God I
[1:00:29] would have quit long time ago if I
[1:00:30] didn't fear
[1:00:32] God I'm scared many times I thought but
[1:00:36] I don't want no
[1:00:38] whooping I'm being with you amen not
[1:00:42] because of the people because of me
[1:00:43] often times pastors feel oh how unworthy
[1:00:46] we feel cuz we battle
[1:00:49] too we come short
[1:00:52] too and yet God has chosen us to preach
[1:00:55] to speak
[1:00:59] may God have mercy on us amen but listen
[1:01:02] what we must realize and I hope it's
[1:01:04] okay this morning we're looking at Satan
[1:01:07] God versus Satan or Satan versus God and
[1:01:10] I said earlier the whole thing is the
[1:01:13] word versus science right because I want
[1:01:17] you to realize what makes us so lazy
[1:01:20] here in America versus those somewhere
[1:01:22] overseas who don't have much science
[1:01:27] right we can go I go in I go in the uh
[1:01:31] supermarkets thing sometime and I think
[1:01:33] I know people ain't buying all this
[1:01:39] food you you know God they can't be
[1:01:43] eating up all that food but they
[1:01:45] throwing probably two-thirds of it away
[1:01:47] and rather giving it to you they throw
[1:01:49] it away and mark the prices up to cover
[1:01:51] the
[1:01:54] loss now you think God God ain't going
[1:01:56] to judge us for
[1:01:57] that y'all hear what I'm saying but it
[1:02:00] makes us feel rich it makes us feel puts
[1:02:04] us in a place amen where we don't have
[1:02:06] to say Lord give us this day our daily
[1:02:14] bread some people won't even eat the
[1:02:16] back of the
[1:02:17] bread you know how the back and some
[1:02:20] people won't eat that I remember the
[1:02:23] time you know we were so hungry we fight
[1:02:25] for it I can remember the time amen mold
[1:02:28] would be on the bread you think we threw
[1:02:31] the bread away we picked that piece of
[1:02:33] mold off my mama said that mold ain't up
[1:02:35] fill us in go on boy eat that
[1:02:37] bread it might have not had the best of
[1:02:39] taste but we ate it we put it down y'all
[1:02:42] hear what I'm saying those were times
[1:02:44] when people needed
[1:02:45] God and L see a science as as literally
[1:02:49] made us lazy it's true you've heard me
[1:02:52] preach on it but I want you to know
[1:02:54] that's his deception
[1:02:57] that's where Satan deceives us because
[1:02:59] we naturally get along we feel like we
[1:03:02] okay with God that's not
[1:03:04] true y'all hear what I'm saying there
[1:03:07] are millions of people who are naturally
[1:03:08] getting along and if they should die
[1:03:10] right now they go straight to
[1:03:17] hell I I I was
[1:03:19] thinking what shall wash away my sin
[1:03:23] nothing but the blood of Jesus
[1:03:26] what can make me whole again nothing but
[1:03:29] the blood of
[1:03:30] Jesus Hallelujah is that all right
[1:03:33] nothing but the blood of Jesus nothing
[1:03:35] but this bleeding bloody word that can
[1:03:37] make us whole and let me say it like
[1:03:40] this folks this is not time and I know
[1:03:42] all of us are going through
[1:03:45] things the other the other night when I
[1:03:47] was so sick I I I I don't know whether I
[1:03:49] told my wife this or not I was talking
[1:03:51] to somebody on the phone I said man I
[1:03:53] said I thought I was getting ready to
[1:03:54] change dimension
[1:03:58] seriously I thought I was getting ready
[1:04:00] to change di mention I was seeing things
[1:04:02] with my eyes open and
[1:04:04] closed still don't understand what I was
[1:04:07] looking at so I'm telling you when you
[1:04:11] you you you laying on your bed that's
[1:04:13] just how quick it can happen you don't
[1:04:15] need this this drama to
[1:04:20] die you know so when you look at this
[1:04:22] thing you think oh God this is where I'm
[1:04:25] going we cannot
[1:04:27] allow
[1:04:32] ourselves to go with modern
[1:04:36] Theory it must stay with the word I
[1:04:40] don't care what the modern modern uh
[1:04:43] people are doing you and I must stay
[1:04:46] with the work give me that oldtime
[1:04:48] religion amen you hear what I'm saying
[1:04:51] because look at what the church did 1963
[1:04:55] like you we said and we've seen many
[1:04:57] times women as they were all look
[1:05:01] holy just a little
[1:05:03] leing Le's a whole lump now I heard
[1:05:06] today that some football team got a
[1:05:09] female something on it I was thinking to
[1:05:12] myself they ought to hit her hard and
[1:05:14] low if she going to be on the field she
[1:05:17] need to get
[1:05:19] it come on don't make her do 10 push-ups
[1:05:23] and I got to do 20 no oh she female so
[1:05:27] she's out here in the mail make her do
[1:05:31] 20 is she tough come on break it on
[1:05:34] Bring it on but you see what I'm saying
[1:05:37] what they doing they sissifying every
[1:05:39] sport I don't mean no harm sisters but
[1:05:41] y'all know what I'm
[1:05:43] saying you can't even open the door for
[1:05:45] a woman right now without her getting
[1:05:47] offended almost no you go
[1:05:49] first like thank
[1:05:52] you I with you you know and it's that is
[1:05:57] it's just such a deception that's going
[1:06:00] on in this world that it's it's just
[1:06:03] hard if you don't have this word this
[1:06:06] message you will not catch
[1:06:08] it this is the
[1:06:10] light this is the
[1:06:12] light modern Theory well because
[1:06:15] somebody else do it don't mean we're
[1:06:17] going to do
[1:06:19] it right oh y'all are so strict over
[1:06:22] there y'all don't do nothing so what if
[1:06:24] y'all want to be on the borderline be on
[1:06:26] the borderline but I'm going to hug I'm
[1:06:28] going to hug where the mountain is I'm
[1:06:30] going hug the curve there I'm not going
[1:06:31] to go to the edge of the thing so if
[1:06:33] something come by to blow me
[1:06:36] off if I'm overdoing it at least I know
[1:06:39] I'm in the safety
[1:06:40] zone Hallelujah and it's best to overdo
[1:06:43] it than to undo
[1:06:46] it
[1:06:48] Hallelujah yeah all that ain't necessary
[1:06:50] but what people don't understand you
[1:06:51] cannot it's true folks it is so hard for
[1:06:55] people to see that the Trinity did not
[1:06:57] come by Jesus Christ the doctrine of
[1:07:01] that thing is truly devilish and one of
[1:07:04] these old days we'll lose our lives for
[1:07:06] standing on acts
[1:07:10] 238 oh folks it's true it's true it's
[1:07:13] true because you got to recognize they

[1:09:39] when I saw where it was taking place
[1:09:41] that's what shook me see I'm going tell
[1:09:43] you something we God didn't put this
[1:09:44] little church here for knock there's
[1:09:46] going to be a Mount Zion Showdown
[1:09:49] whether you want to believe it or not
[1:09:50] here in this area there going to be a
[1:09:53] mount Z Showdown
[1:09:56] because you see Janice and jamers
[1:09:58] raising
[1:10:02] up the Reverend Daniel Fleming of St Pas
[1:10:06] the 10th Catholic
[1:10:08] Church in Urbandale is one of the 50 US
[1:10:13] priests recently chosen to train in the
[1:10:16] right of
[1:10:18] exorcism Fleming was named the official
[1:10:22] Exorcist of the dicese of Deon
[1:10:26] the official
[1:10:28] Exorcist my
[1:10:31] god oh
[1:10:33] [Music]
[1:10:36] nonsense devil going to whoop him up
[1:10:41] too huh like the sons of ska come on
[1:10:44] somebody it is what it is and I don't
[1:10:48] even understand here it is you know the
[1:10:50] Bible said that same spirit and I'm
[1:10:52] going tell you something you can't play
[1:10:53] with this Spirit listen brother bam said
[1:10:55] it like this he said if you he said the
[1:10:57] mark of the uh the beast in the head
[1:11:00] amen is to receive the doctrine and with
[1:11:02] the hand is to is to do the
[1:11:05] will huh that's the spiritual aspect of
[1:11:08] it whether they GNA put a mark in your
[1:11:09] head or not only God knows because I'll
[1:11:11] be
[1:11:12] gone y'all hear what I'm saying but my
[1:11:15] point is amen they said oh everybody
[1:11:18] that was in kenth Copeland assembly that
[1:11:20] agreed with that you think the people
[1:11:23] would have walked out they stood there
[1:11:25] you could see some was
[1:11:27] confused but the for the majority all it
[1:11:29] took was one man to appla and all the
[1:11:32] other ones went after it they received
[1:11:34] the mark of the beast and didn't even
[1:11:36] know
[1:11:37] it did not even know it because here
[1:11:40] they saw the pope on tap calling him
[1:11:44] Brethren wanting to receive him and
[1:11:45] everything else and he in return sends
[1:11:48] the pope of message by video himself
[1:11:51] what nonsense
[1:11:56] they had a
[1:11:57] voice in the land that told us about
[1:12:01] Jezebel and her
[1:12:03] religion and right now like I said this
[1:12:06] this Pope right now he's the he's the
[1:12:08] greatest of all popes he's more lik than
[1:12:11] any Pope in
[1:12:13] history whether he is the final or not I
[1:12:16] don't know but I sure enough know he's
[1:12:18] setting up a pretty good
[1:12:20] stage right now we look at this thing
[1:12:23] and here the word of God listen is
[1:12:25] choosing wrong over right what is it it
[1:12:28] started off with a little
[1:12:31] deed deed of the nickan little deed has
[1:12:35] brought this church into this great
[1:12:37] grandor right she's a wh sitting on
[1:12:40] Seven Hills amen with a face painted
[1:12:43] like Jezebel come on nobody can outdo
[1:12:47] those churches when it come to Beauty
[1:12:49] naturally it's a little spooky to me but
[1:12:52] it's Beauty to the eye gold here and
[1:12:55] painted stained glass windows and choirs
[1:12:57] and all this stuff and you know and and
[1:13:01] you say well brother are you insane I
[1:13:02] said I put it this way right now this
[1:13:05] what I'm saying may not affect you but
[1:13:07] it's it
[1:13:08] will it's coming and my point is are you
[1:13:12] making yourself
[1:13:14] ready Hallelujah come on somebody listen
[1:13:18] Daniel said now listen what he said he
[1:13:20] said now the scripture says when the
[1:13:22] enemy comes in like a flood the spirit
[1:13:24] of God will lift up a standard is that
[1:13:26] right but Daniel says in
[1:13:28] 11:22 and with the arms of a
[1:13:32] flood shall they be overflown from
[1:13:35] before him and and and it said it in
[1:13:39] that term it means forced or swept away
[1:13:44] like a
[1:13:48] tsunami y'all hear what I'm saying like
[1:13:50] a tsunami how are you listen people I
[1:13:53] know I got it I withand that the Bible
[1:13:56] said to me that the devil went to Jo to
[1:13:58] went to God says let me touch it God
[1:14:00] said you can cuz the devil say skin for
[1:14:03] skin what will a man give for his own
[1:14:06] life hello come on somebody what will
[1:14:09] you give for your own life when the pain
[1:14:11] is there racking your
[1:14:16] body come on somebody what's going to
[1:14:19] happen amen if if if they take one of
[1:14:21] your little ones or whatever the case
[1:14:22] may be what are you going to do
[1:14:25] what are you going to we don't know how
[1:14:27] far this is going to go we have no idea
[1:14:29] but my point is are we ready for it we
[1:14:32] can't be getting ready the bride has
[1:14:35] made herself ready already ready that's
[1:14:39] all I'm saying that's all I'm saying it
[1:14:41] ain't the multitude of people in here
[1:14:43] it's what we got we need to make best of
[1:14:46] it and the only way we're going to
[1:14:48] achieve that people of God is that all
[1:14:51] of us make sure we're filled with the

[1:17:01] friend we contact but anyway he lost his
[1:17:04] wife at a young age she was really young
[1:17:06] they had two sons and I just read this
[1:17:09] last night not knowing she had two other
[1:17:12] sisters and they all died of cancer one
[1:17:17] behind now I knew about his wife and I
[1:17:20] just read that last night about the
[1:17:23] other two sisters and they all had
[1:17:26] cancer and here's the father broken when
[1:17:31] his last daughter died and they trying
[1:17:33] to beat this cancer beat this cancer in
[1:17:34] every way and the cancer was just
[1:17:36] steadily increasing just like just just
[1:17:38] going at her and finally she died from
[1:17:42] pneumonia his last
[1:17:47] daughter but he said it was during that
[1:17:50] time he recognized who he really was and
[1:17:53] that God was the king
[1:17:57] y'all hear what I'm saying he prospered
[1:18:00] from that
[1:18:02] trial it brought him to a spiritual
[1:18:05] level he probably would have never come
[1:18:07] to had not those trials came come had
[1:18:11] not they come upon him you understand me
[1:18:14] he come and he says I wish I could put
[1:18:16] it in his words but but it just and
[1:18:18] that's what that whole little view was
[1:18:21] it was showing people who had like uh
[1:18:23] tragical things in their lives and how
[1:18:25] those things made them better Christians
[1:18:29] that's what the Trials come from make
[1:18:31] you a better Christian make you closer
[1:18:34] to God hallelujah that's what they come
[1:18:37] to do now come on somebody if anybody
[1:18:41] would have known exactly what he what Jo
[1:18:43] not exactly but Clos to what job felt he
[1:18:46] did job lost all of them one
[1:18:51] shot hey come on somebody and we think
[1:18:54] our trials are so difficult and job
[1:18:56] didn't have what we
[1:18:58] got at least that's the way we
[1:19:00] understand it y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:19:03] all he had was a
[1:19:04] [Laughter]
[1:19:07] sacrifice and that's what he had
[1:19:09] confidence in I know my redeemer
[1:19:13] liveth hey somebody and though the skin
[1:19:15] worms eat up my flesh yet in my flesh I
[1:19:19] Ser
[1:19:20] him this life means nothing folks don't
[1:19:22] make the devil think you got eternal
[1:19:24] life in this
[1:19:27] fles y'all hear what I'm saying no
[1:19:33] sir yes I even had a dream about a
[1:19:37] precious sister of mine this morning and
[1:19:39] I I don't know what the
[1:19:40] dream what it really meant but we were
[1:19:44] somehow I I can't remember whether she
[1:19:46] was thrown overboard fell overboard but
[1:19:48] she was down in the water and she had
[1:19:50] been there a long while and I died down
[1:19:53] and saw her there I I I began to push
[1:19:55] her up to the top and the whole time I'm
[1:19:57] thinking Lord she's been down here so
[1:19:59] long I don't know how to revive her how
[1:20:03] can I get
[1:20:04] her living again and then I woke
[1:20:09] up you know I I believe God was saying
[1:20:12] pray
[1:20:13] for a lot of time people we don't
[1:20:15] realize amen when we are in situation
[1:20:18] and we're so low down it takes
[1:20:20] somebody's
[1:20:21] prayer hello it takes prayer
[1:20:25] when somebody else's prayer when you
[1:20:27] can't pray y'all know what I'm talking
[1:20:28] about you ever been in a place you can't
[1:20:30] pray I have I
[1:20:35] have I've been there I mean you get on
[1:20:37] your knees and
[1:20:38] nothing right not even words come to you
[1:20:42] feel like you've been deserted huh those
[1:20:45] are times you thinking Lord what have I
[1:20:46] done where am I what's going on and
[1:20:49] sometime he put you there just to see
[1:20:51] how you're going to respond
[1:20:56] every time you get on it it's true but
[1:20:58] it's God training you to not rest upon
[1:21:02] your
[1:21:04] feelings it ain't the way oh I feel good
[1:21:06] cuz I had I felt so good in prayer that
[1:21:08] ain't prayer you can go through prayer
[1:21:11] reminiscing about all the wicked things
[1:21:12] you ever done and God done forgave you
[1:21:14] for all of that and you give it off your
[1:21:15] knees say oh I feel good why all you did
[1:21:18] was try to remind God of all of the
[1:21:20] things that's supposed to be under the
[1:21:22] blood Hallelujah prayer is talking to
[1:21:26] God on a daily
[1:21:27] basis oh my God and and and expressing
[1:21:31] to him how you love him how you care for
[1:21:33] him how you worship Him and how you're
[1:21:35] going to love him
[1:21:36] unconditionally see but uh but we look
[1:21:39] at this thing and I'm almost
[1:21:42] done but the Bible tells us that the
[1:21:44] host of Heaven all of them will be
[1:21:46] destroyed and you know when the word of
[1:21:48] God works about the host of Heaven he's
[1:21:50] working with Satan in his cre because
[1:21:52] remember there in that's what Israel
[1:21:54] worship the host of Heaven the Queen of
[1:21:57] Heaven and that Queen of Heaven is who
[1:22:00] uh Nimrod
[1:22:03] and and all of his crew right so we
[1:22:07] realize by the grace of God now but the
[1:22:10] B if you want to look that scripture up
[1:22:11] and I'm going to go there it's 34 Isaiah
[1:22:13] 34
[1:22:14] 1-4 he said the the whole thing will be
[1:22:16] rolled back like a
[1:22:18] scroll this this world is getting ready
[1:22:20] to be destroyed
[1:22:22] folks I mean the scientists know know it
[1:22:24] the animals know it they're fleeing but
[1:22:27] there is no place to run no place to
[1:22:30] hide and we who are human we who are
[1:22:33] supposed to be in the image of God we
[1:22:35] looking at this thing and now as we said
[1:22:37] last week I mean the whole world they
[1:22:39] did a they did a survey and now is a 50%
[1:22:42] of America think that the same-sex
[1:22:44] marriage is okay come on folks I mean a
[1:22:47] blind man can see right now my point is
[1:22:51] let let me move on we looking at the
[1:22:53] thing I want you to understand I'm not
[1:22:54] done with the subject because I want you
[1:22:56] to understand how subtle this thing is
[1:22:58] this thing is moving in such a subtle
[1:23:00] way it's like television if it like they
[1:23:03] said if if they can get you to laugh at
[1:23:05] it they know they got
[1:23:07] you if they can get you to laugh at sin
[1:23:10] they know they got you come on it's true
[1:23:13] oh it's true you know I I and that's
[1:23:15] true I had to ask God to deliver me from
[1:23:16] I Love Lucy because she was my favorite
[1:23:19] comedian I mean my mama's favorite
[1:23:21] comedian and the whole time she was just
[1:23:23] a rebellious woman
[1:23:26] right come on somebody I mean she was
[1:23:28] the prettiest redhead I ever seen I
[1:23:30] don't know whe that was natural or not
[1:23:32] but but I'm just telling you that's the
[1:23:35] truth he got the devil took a beautiful
[1:23:38] woman right put her up there and Mark
[1:23:42] God word from time one a from A to
[1:23:47] Z she made the man look stupid right she
[1:23:51] was the woman of authority she was
[1:23:53] always correcting him y'all hear what
[1:23:55] I'm saying she never was obedient and
[1:23:58] guess what all of America patter
[1:24:02] now that's all it takes I guarantee you
[1:24:05] if they put me on the television or the
[1:24:08] radio and I can come up with something
[1:24:12] stupid if I could just develop a crazy
[1:24:15] laugh I guarantee you the whole world
[1:24:17] will
[1:24:21] started it's true
[1:24:24] they they they all I got to do is be a
[1:24:26] renounced actor and I can just go just
[1:24:29] after somebody say something and I
[1:24:31] guarantee you it'll it'll become a fat
[1:24:34] or whatever everybody will start
[1:24:35] laughing why it's
[1:24:37] spiritual because all those stars are
[1:24:39] ministering
[1:24:41] spirits come on somebody it's true and
[1:24:45] if you ever listen to a gospel song and
[1:24:48] you don't get up spiritual you thinking
[1:24:51] crazy thoughts now you just picked up
[1:24:53] the spirits of those who were just
[1:24:57] singing see what we don't see the
[1:25:00] spirits that's being ministered we just
[1:25:02] hear the
[1:25:03] sound come on or the words not all of us
[1:25:07] but y'all know what I'm saying my point
[1:25:09] is this you and I are living in a day
[1:25:12] where people are becoming more blind if
[1:25:15] there's such a thing people are be
[1:25:17] they're just blind and the Bible I said
[1:25:20] last week you are the light of the world
[1:25:22] if you lose the Bible said if you lose
[1:25:25] if the salt lose it sa what good is it
[1:25:27] you might as well be tried under fooot
[1:25:30] that's why the the foolish version get
[1:25:32] that because they lose it they lose
[1:25:34] their Direction they lose their purpose
[1:25:38] for what they come in this age to
[1:25:41] be and we can't lose
[1:25:44] that it doesn't matter death don't mean
[1:25:47] no thing I was born and didn't ask to be
[1:25:50] born so when it's time for me to die I
[1:25:53] have nothing to say about
[1:25:57] it none of us do but when that time come
[1:26:01] it's going to come whether you like it
[1:26:03] or not you better be
[1:26:05] ready my point is this are you sealed
[1:26:08] with the Holy Ghost and if if if if if
[1:26:11] you don't feel and believe that you are
[1:26:13] you need to get somewhere to God answers
[1:26:16] brother Brandon said his
[1:26:18] daughter-in-law prayed and fasted for
[1:26:20] seven
[1:26:21] days before God filled her
[1:26:27] Billy Paul's wife prayed and fasted for
[1:26:30] seven days and God f with my question is
[1:26:35] was that worth
[1:26:37] it somebody was
[1:26:40] desperate cuz it's hard nowadays to fast
[1:26:42] a
[1:26:46] day somebody was desperate and when
[1:26:49] you're desperate you'll do some of the
[1:26:51] most unusual things you don't care
[1:26:55] care you don't
[1:26:57] care but my point is whatever it takes
[1:27:00] and I'm not telling y'all to go fast
[1:27:01] seven days I'm telling you that whatever
[1:27:04] makes your clock tick you need to do it
[1:27:07] whatever whatever you need to do you
[1:27:09] need to do it and Satan is not going to
[1:27:12] make it convenient for you just forget
[1:27:15] it he's not going to make it convenient
[1:27:17] he didn't make it convenient for the
[1:27:18] Lord Jesus did he God Jesus said listen
[1:27:21] the hour of Temptation is coming and
[1:27:23] that's all I'm saying the hour of
[1:27:25] Temptation is coming you can't fight
[1:27:27] with a natural sword you got to have a
[1:27:30] spiritual sword come on somebody you got
[1:27:32] to have something on the inside of your
[1:27:34] heart amen that's the only way you can't
[1:27:38] listen people of God how on Earth are
[1:27:40] you going to know the will of God if
[1:27:42] you're not fing on the word you got to
[1:27:44] read your Bible you got to pray you got
[1:27:46] to listen to the messages you can't well
[1:27:49] I know I'm I'm just reading my Bible you
[1:27:51] got to listen to the message what do you
[1:27:52] think he brought it for
[1:27:57] that's a
[1:27:58] must you say how can that be a must
[1:28:01] because the Bible said take this little
[1:28:03] book and
[1:28:04] eat and that little book represented the
[1:28:07] revelation of the word for our
[1:28:10] day eat it all up he
[1:28:13] said not just the Bible we've always had
[1:28:17] it but there's a revelation of every age
[1:28:20] in this Bible and the only way you'll
[1:28:22] ever see it is that God revealed the
[1:28:25] messenger to
[1:28:28] you huh you see the messenger before you
[1:28:31] see the message come on
[1:28:34] somebody
[1:28:37] right all reveal was the
[1:28:40] messenger but the messenger was British
[1:28:43] is
[1:28:45] coming warning right prepare yourself
[1:28:48] for
[1:28:50] war and that's where it
[1:28:52] is that's what
[1:28:54] prepare yourself for war and I'm telling
[1:28:57] you people of God what scares me about a
[1:29:00] lot of people because we are out of sin
[1:29:03] and it's everywhere but I'm just en
[1:29:05] encouraging you this morning whatever it
[1:29:08] takes I don't care if you got a little
[1:29:10] bit of muscle left you pull yourself up
[1:29:12] from wherever you are and get back to
[1:29:14] where God want you to be in God in
[1:29:19] God in closing I know it's a prep I know
[1:29:24] what I'm saying is not easy I know these
[1:29:26] demons that are now out there they're
[1:29:28] out and they Loos on you and every one
[1:29:30] of us in this church right now are
[1:29:32] feeling the effects y'all hear what I'm
[1:29:34] saying how many of us in our heart
[1:29:36] perfectly want to serve God and how many
[1:29:39] of in our actions we can
[1:29:42] see you see what I'm saying but it ain't
[1:29:44] you it ain't you see that's the point
[1:29:47] I'm trying to it's not you that you're
[1:29:49] fighting with it ain't flesh and
[1:29:52] blood it's spirit spiritual wickedness
[1:29:54] in high places and the devil is making
[1:29:56] you think it's you it's not you you're
[1:29:59] the bride and that's what he's come to
[1:30:02] do to stop you the real you from
[1:30:05] progressing but you locked in the
[1:30:09] scripture I I I I got to read this last
[1:30:11] one and then I'll let you go forgive me
[1:30:13] I almost forgot it but we know the
[1:30:15] scripture turn with me to Romans
[1:30:22] now I'm not trying to beat anybody up
[1:30:25] I'm just trying to encourage you we all
[1:30:28] are in this particular thing together
[1:30:30] we're in this together right and we know
[1:30:34] the only way we're going to get out of
[1:30:35] this way is by grace of God the grace of
[1:30:38] God Amen who shall lay anything to
[1:30:41] anything to the charge of God's elect it
[1:30:44] is God that
[1:30:49] justify okay let me read it this way who
[1:30:52] shall lay anything to to the charge of
[1:30:56] uh
[1:30:56] God's elected
[1:31:00] Isaiah it is God that justify
[1:31:04] e continually justify
[1:31:09] you who is he that condemneth it is
[1:31:12] Christ that died y rather that is risen
[1:31:14] again who is even at the right hand of
[1:31:16] God who also make intercession for us
[1:31:19] who shall separate us from the love of
[1:31:21] Christ shall tribulation or distress or
[1:31:24] persecution or famine or nakedness of
[1:31:26] pearl or sword huh I'm locked in
[1:31:30] there that's my scripture that's your
[1:31:33] scripture it ain't about your
[1:31:37] feelings it's what God is chosen you to
[1:31:40] do oh my every time I think about
[1:31:42] doubting Thomas it give me a great
[1:31:45] hope it does he doubt
[1:31:48] it and he was like that that was just
[1:31:51] part of what he was but after the day of
[1:31:54] because you never heard no more about
[1:31:55] that did
[1:31:57] you something changed he metant the
[1:32:00] Living God and that's all we need meet
[1:32:03] the Living God Amen and God will do
[1:32:06] something for us but every time I see
[1:32:08] him it give me such a
[1:32:11] hope I was teaching this I was just
[1:32:14] reading this morning you know yeah on
[1:32:18] how how the the early church chose
[1:32:21] Mattias to be uh the next apostle
[1:32:24] there's not a chair up there for
[1:32:27] Mias there's only 12 and I mean know how
[1:32:30] Paul took his
[1:32:32] seat because it's who God chose choose
[1:32:35] to
[1:32:36] do and listen they were under the
[1:32:39] inspiration of the
[1:32:41] church Matias got a
[1:32:43] place but he wasn't one of the Apostles
[1:32:46] that God had told brother brandham says
[1:32:49] that so you you look at us and we say oh
[1:32:52] brother Brooks listen I'mma tell you
[1:32:54] something I don't care what God does for
[1:32:55] me with be right now I don't I mean when
[1:32:59] when I say that as long as it's it to
[1:33:00] his glory now I know there are things in
[1:33:03] me that need God needs to work with and
[1:33:06] whatever they are I want them
[1:33:08] out lot time we don't even know things
[1:33:10] are in us until Trials come and then we
[1:33:13] see these things but who's going to lay
[1:33:16] it a charge to
[1:33:17] your who going to accuse you ain't
[1:33:20] nobody accuse none of us can accuse one
[1:33:22] another in here if we the ne of God
[1:33:24] your accusation is going not going to
[1:33:25] stand anyhow God is the judge of
[1:33:29] it am I making
[1:33:32] sense amen who should separate as it is
[1:33:35] written for for for thy sake we are
[1:33:37] killed all the day long we are accounter
[1:33:39] as sheep for the slaughter n and all
[1:33:41] these things we are more than conquerors
[1:33:43] to him that love us I am
[1:33:47] persuaded you know what I'm saying more
[1:33:50] than conquers through him that love us
[1:33:51] he conquers for us
[1:33:55] let me get a
[1:33:56] witness he conquers for us you know for
[1:34:00] I am persuaded that neither death nor
[1:34:02] life nor Angel nor principality nor
[1:34:05] power nor things present nor things to
[1:34:07] come nor height nor death nor any other
[1:34:09] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:34:12] from the love of God I'm so glad he
[1:34:14] didn't say separate me he said separate
[1:34:17] us from the love of God which is in
[1:34:20] Christ Jesus our
[1:34:22] lord oh
[1:34:24] there's going to be a lot of people in
[1:34:27] heaven I guess we thought wasn't going
[1:34:29] to make it you know why would they would
[1:34:31] make it because they were
[1:34:32] elected and God going to make sure they
[1:34:34] make it is that right he causes us to
[1:34:38] Triumph Hallelujah every time I think
[1:34:41] about that Thief people said if that
[1:34:42] don't apply to us that was the alpha why
[1:34:44] wouldn't it be the
[1:34:47] Omega that Thief said Lord you know have
[1:34:50] mercy on me recognize his day in his
[1:34:55] message amen and Jesus said this day
[1:34:58] you'll be with me in
[1:35:01] Paradise it ought to put put something
[1:35:03] in fire put a fire on you because that
[1:35:06] was the beginning of that Grace right
[1:35:07] there right there right there right
[1:35:09] there right there right there the man
[1:35:11] didn't do nothing but confess Jesus
[1:35:12] Christ as his Lord and Savior and he was
[1:35:14] in Paradise in a moment's time so I'm
[1:35:18] I'm going to say it like this people of
[1:35:19] God if you are in the Lamb's Book cuz I
[1:35:21] hadn't got there the Bible said all all
[1:35:24] word you see names not written in the L
[1:35:28] of
[1:35:30] my are you
[1:35:33] deceived and if you're not deceived that
[1:35:41] means as simple as
[1:35:46] ABC how would you to really meditate on
[1:35:49] that cuz the devil want to say well
[1:35:51] you're not going to make it in there's
[1:35:52] no way are you you
[1:35:55] deceive do you know who your sacrifice
[1:35:58] is do you know who die do you know how
[1:36:00] you get into heaven oh Brothers I did
[1:36:02] this I did that ain't that ain't a lot
[1:36:04] of people did that and that that won't
[1:36:06] make it Lord had I cast out devils in
[1:36:08] your D didn't I do no they did a lot of
[1:36:10] things that didn't make
[1:36:13] it who God
[1:36:18] Justified see what I'm saying is because
[1:36:21] deception if you ever think
[1:36:24] that your works is the thing that saves
[1:36:26] you you are
[1:36:28] L I'm just saying like this it doesn't
[1:36:31] mean that because you saved you don't do
[1:36:33] Works your Works come because you are
[1:36:36] saved you think saving no you might be
[1:36:39] building up a treasure you might get a
[1:36:41] little extra because you've done a lot
[1:36:43] of work salvation only comes by the
[1:36:45] grace of
[1:36:50] God the word amens himself and now let
[1:36:54] me put it this way it doesn't I don't
[1:36:56] say that for you to get doitory and lazy
[1:36:59] but my point is this if you think that
[1:37:01] you going to make heaven without the
[1:37:04] sacrificial
[1:37:06] L you are
[1:37:09] totally
[1:37:12] blind it ain't work always been Grace
[1:37:16] will
[1:37:16] be hello somebody and that's where the
[1:37:19] problem is with us that's why a lot of
[1:37:21] us can't live Christian life because we
[1:37:22] trying to work our way and every time we
[1:37:25] make mistakes we always beating
[1:37:26] ourselves up and putting oursel in
[1:37:28] jail forgetting is the grace of
[1:37:31] God forgetting amen that these these
[1:37:34] things God knew you couldn't do it in
[1:37:35] the beginning that's why he sent his son
[1:37:38] Jesus is an unconditional Covenant amen
[1:37:41] that you're supposed to love him and
[1:37:43] keep his commandment not because you
[1:37:45] fear him you love him he said if you
[1:37:48] love me you stand
[1:37:55] I believe that a man supposed to
[1:37:57] approach the throne of God not just once
[1:37:59] a day but as often as he can I believe a
[1:38:02] man also should always walk in worthy
[1:38:05] being worthy of the of the Lamb put it
[1:38:08] this way if you got a a germ killer put
[1:38:11] it in the bottle everywhere you go you
[1:38:13] ought to take that germ killer with
[1:38:16] you that's what this world is full of
[1:38:18] Journey right and every opportunity you
[1:38:21] get a chance to spray your bottle keep
[1:38:23] you from being infected that's your
[1:38:26] prayer y'all hear what I'm saying you
[1:38:27] spray in your bottle Lord keep this germ
[1:38:30] away from me don't let me get sick right
[1:38:33] and that's what you and I must recognize
[1:38:35] the blood of Jesus Christ like brother
[1:38:37] say doesn't save you it keeps you saved
[1:38:41] election
[1:38:43] chosen right from the foundation of the
[1:38:46] world you were saved before the
[1:38:47] foundation of the
[1:38:50] world hello and you were sealed before
[1:38:54] the foundation of the
[1:38:57] world before you even got here did any
[1:38:59] kind of sin God had already done that
[1:39:01] for you and that's
[1:39:04] it it won't be one
[1:39:07] extra the only thing is that a lot of us
[1:39:10] are lacking is the revelation of who we
[1:39:12] really
[1:39:14] are because once you realize who you
[1:39:16] really are you'll begin to act and
[1:39:18] behave that way the life in you will
[1:39:21] begin to live its way through you and
[1:39:23] and there's no way you can stop it once
[1:39:25] that Revelation comes
[1:39:27] in love God let's pray father God we
[1:39:30] come before you Lord as how you know how
[1:39:32] we thank you for this time and
[1:39:34] opportunity to worship you and to praise

[1:39:47] anoint the words into the people's heart
[1:39:49] that they could hear not with their head
[1:39:51] but with their hearts Lord this is a
[1:39:53] time a serious time a
[1:39:56] Time Lord a deadly time so many Fallen
[1:40:00] away so many people losing their Vision
[1:40:03] so many CAU into the illusion and the
[1:40:05] delusion of Satan help us right now that
[1:40:07] we're walk in the light you said that we
[1:40:09] walk in the light as he is in the light
[1:40:11] we have fellowship with one another and
