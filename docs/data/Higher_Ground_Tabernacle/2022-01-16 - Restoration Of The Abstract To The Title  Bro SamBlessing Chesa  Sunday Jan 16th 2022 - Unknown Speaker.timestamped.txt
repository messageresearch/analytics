[53:13] [Music]
[53:32] [Music]
[53:53] the house of the lord
[53:54] [Music]
[54:01] genesis chapter 1 and verse 26.
[54:19] genesis chapter 1 and verse 26 genesis
[54:28] and god said let us make man in our
[54:31] image
[54:32] after our kindness after our likeness
[54:35] and let them have dominion over the fish
[54:37] of the sea and over the fowl of the air
[54:39] and over the cattle
[54:41] and over all the earth and over every
[54:43] creeping thing that creeped upon the
[54:45] earth
[54:57] so god created man in his own image in
[55:00] the image of god created he him male and
[55:03] female he created he
[55:11] and god blessed them and god said unto
[55:13] them be fruitful and multiply and
[55:16] replenish the earth and subdue it and
[55:19] have dominion over this fish of the sea
[55:22] and over the fall of the air and over
[55:24] every living thing that moved upon the
[55:26] earth
[55:27] [Music]
[55:38] amen want to focus on the part that says
[55:40] and have dominion over the fish of the
[55:43] sea and over the fall of the air in
[55:45] every living thing that move it upon the
[55:58] i want to speak on this subject uh
[56:00] restoration of the abstract to the title
[56:06] amen this will sound more like part two
[56:08] of the sermon that i praised someone
[56:11] some time ago
[56:15] when we're reading in the book of
[56:16] genesis
[56:18] we realize god created man
[56:22] and he said let us make man in our image
[56:27] after our likeness you know amen
[56:30] the image that he was talking about it
[56:32] is not this flesh
[56:35] because the prophet of god tells us that
[56:37] this flesh is just an animal
[56:41] but the image that you god created you
[56:43] in
[56:44] the image that god created you and me
[56:49] he was talking about the spirit man
[56:52] the spirit man that is within you
[56:56] that's what god make like unto himself
[57:00] so we don't rely on this flesh
[57:04] because this flesh is not the real us
[57:08] but the spirit within us that's the real
[57:24] actual you is the spirit within you
[57:28] that god made after his own image did
[57:31] you have increased
[57:33] and after he created adam and give put
[57:35] the he he breathed the spirit man into
[57:38] the body
[57:53] and he was he was giving adam the
[57:55] authority over everything he had created
[58:02] when god finished creation he left a
[58:04] little bit for adam
[58:16] because he was in the same image as god
[58:19] was
[58:34] when adam say you are an elephant
[58:37] god said amen and that's what it was
[58:41] adam had authority over over nature
[58:46] he had authority over the atmosphere
[58:54] because that was the authority that was
[58:55] handed to him by god
[58:59] that's the dominion he was given
[59:01] domination
[59:15] it's a record
[59:17] of any property that you have that shows
[59:20] all the people that were handed to it
[59:22] throughout all the ages
[59:32] it says it contains all the historical
[59:34] transfers that ever happened in a
[59:36] property
[59:42] it shows the property's ownership as far
[59:45] as back then as it goes
[59:53] and the abstract gives you the authority
[59:55] to the title deeds
[1:00:00] gives you authority to exercise all the
[1:00:03] rights the title deed has
[1:00:10] and this dominion and authority that
[1:00:12] adam was given that was the abstract to
[1:00:14] the title
[1:00:20] amen but as we know in the book of
[1:00:22] genesis adam and eve sinned
[1:00:26] i don't ever be pushy and when adam and
[1:00:28] eve sinned we know adam will uh sinned
[1:00:31] willingly
[1:00:34] and when they sinned he lost the
[1:00:36] abstract to the title
[1:00:42] wanted to get a hold of it but god took
[1:00:44] it back into his hands
[1:00:48] and he was waiting for the right time to
[1:00:50] give it back into the hands of man
[1:00:54] because that's what it was created for
[1:00:57] you that was that's what it was meant
[1:00:59] for
[1:01:00] for the sons of god to use it
[1:01:05] so he was god was holding it back until
[1:01:08] man had
[1:01:21] it would only take another atom
[1:01:25] to come and claim it back
[1:01:28] and put back the authority in the hands
[1:01:29] of the actual people who needs it
[1:01:34] amen that's why when adam sinned what up
[1:01:36] god god gave a prophecy and said they
[1:01:39] shall be the seed of the woman
[1:01:43] that shall bruise the head of the
[1:01:44] serpent
[1:01:47] and there was none other than jesus
[1:01:48] christ
[1:01:51] amen and he said i'll put enmity between
[1:01:54] the serpent and the woman
[1:01:59] and the seed of the woman
[1:02:02] god beforehand he was already creating a
[1:02:04] way back for the title deed to get back
[1:02:07] into the hands of the sons of god
[1:02:13] [Music]
[1:02:16] the prophet of god in the british
[1:02:17] between the seven chage ages and the
[1:02:19] seven seals
[1:02:24] he says now oh my now the forfeited
[1:02:27] title deed is now in the hands of the
[1:02:29] original owner
[1:02:47] then satan's dirty hands could not take
[1:02:49] it
[1:02:52] so it went back right to its original
[1:02:54] honor
[1:02:57] amen god himself
[1:02:59] sitting on the throne with the title
[1:03:01] deed in his hands
[1:03:04] adam forfeited it for wisdom
[1:03:09] instead of faith
[1:03:12] so after adam lost the title did the
[1:03:14] abstract to
[1:03:24] he had no dominion over the things that
[1:03:26] god had given him to control
[1:03:36] he could not tell the the river to flow
[1:03:38] in a different direction
[1:03:54] because they had lost the title deed
[1:03:56] absolutely
[1:04:00] and that's when they started uh thorns
[1:04:02] and tissues started growing up
[1:04:06] i saw a grandiose and we
[1:04:08] snow started coming down what we're
[1:04:10] still struggling with today
[1:04:15] that was because of the fall because
[1:04:16] adam forfeited the title dead
[1:04:23] amen men were being ravaged by satan
[1:04:27] and god kicked adam and eve out of the
[1:04:29] garden of eden did you ever see adoring
[1:04:32] them amen and the earth was cursed
[1:04:34] nature was cursed because of men's
[1:04:36] disobedience
[1:04:40] because he was given rulership over
[1:04:42] everything that god had created
[1:04:48] amen so this sin
[1:04:50] accumulated a debt over this title deed
[1:04:54] accumulate
[1:04:58] debt in debt
[1:05:00] so for the title d to be returned back
[1:05:02] to the original owner a debt has to be
[1:05:04] paid
[1:05:18] a man who was worthy to come and pay
[1:05:20] this debt
[1:05:24] so that the title did could go back to
[1:05:26] the original owner
[1:05:31] for the title to come back into the
[1:05:33] hands of the sons of god
[1:06:07] it shows everything that was ever
[1:06:09] against the piece of ground has been
[1:06:11] stricken off
[1:06:29] so there was to be found a man who was
[1:06:31] worthy to pay that debt off so that the
[1:06:33] book could be handed back into the hands
[1:06:35] of man
[1:06:41] for all the 4 000 years of men's
[1:06:43] existence there was no prophet or no
[1:06:46] man who was worthy to pay this debt
[1:06:54] we have all the great prophets elijah
[1:06:56] moses isaiah jeremiah and all of them
[1:07:01] [Music]
[1:07:03] but no one was found worthy to come and
[1:07:05] pay that debt
[1:07:08] amen amen but god created a way back
[1:07:12] and
[1:07:25] his own son and called him jesus
[1:07:29] and he himself stepped into him
[1:07:33] and his son jesus had to come and pay
[1:07:35] that debt
[1:07:38] amen so he created him so he could come
[1:07:41] and redeem it back
[1:07:44] pay the debt off the the abstract to the
[1:07:47] title
[1:07:50] and place it back in the hands of man
[1:07:55] amen
[1:07:56] and we are told the prophet of god tells
[1:07:58] us that jesus was a hundred percent god
[1:08:00] and a hundred percent man
[1:08:05] he was not fifty he was not a fifty
[1:08:07] percent man and fifty percent god did
[1:08:09] the person comfortable
[1:08:11] but he was all god and he was all man
[1:08:15] he was all men so he could feel whatever
[1:08:18] you go through
[1:08:21] hey man he was old man so he could feel
[1:08:23] all the sicknesses you go through
[1:08:28] he was all men so he could understand
[1:08:30] the depression that you go through
[1:08:34] but he was god enough to deliver you out
[1:08:37] of them all
[1:08:40] amen there is nothing that god jesus
[1:08:43] could not relate to
[1:08:49] he even feels how he knows how it feels
[1:08:51] to feel to to feel rejected
[1:08:57] he was rejected by the very same people
[1:08:59] he came to save
[1:09:03] his purpose his mission was to come and
[1:09:05] redeem humanity
[1:09:10] but those same people he came to redeem
[1:09:12] they they decided to go for for a
[1:09:14] murderer and and they'd say kill him
[1:09:17] remember
[1:09:28] and he also knows how it feels to be
[1:09:31] rejected by god
[1:09:35] because when he was going to the cross
[1:09:36] when he was at the cross god left him
[1:09:41] that's why he said my father why hast
[1:09:44] thou forsaken me
[1:10:13] when he was in the garden of gethsemane
[1:10:16] he was crying lord
[1:10:18] if it was possible i would let this cup
[1:10:21] pass
[1:10:24] but because on his mind he saw you
[1:10:28] he saw that you needed to be saved
[1:10:31] if there was no cross you and me would
[1:10:33] have been in hell
[1:10:36] but because he had you on his mind
[1:10:40] he said nevertheless i will do it
[1:10:57] he was paying off the debt that was on
[1:10:59] the abstract to the title
[1:11:02] hey man
[1:11:03] when he was hanging on the cross and he
[1:11:05] cried it is finished
[1:11:09] he was saying father i've accomplished
[1:11:12] the assignment
[1:11:14] i have to pay the debt
[1:11:17] and now i can go and put it back in the
[1:11:19] hands of man
[1:11:22] amen so because he paid the debt
[1:11:26] you and me don't have to live under our
[1:11:29] own privileges
[1:11:32] we gotta walk into all the full promises
[1:11:34] of god
[1:11:38] we gotta walk into our full potential
[1:11:42] because you said it is finished
[1:11:45] and the devil the accuser cannot put it
[1:11:47] on you
[1:11:50] because you say you never done it in the
[1:11:52] first place
[1:11:54] so whatever he has on you is accused
[1:11:57] back to the devil
[1:12:05] and he came when he came to take that
[1:12:06] book and shed his blood
[1:12:10] he forgave the sins of all the sages
[1:12:16] when they were sacrificing bulls and
[1:12:18] gods
[1:12:20] the
[1:12:47] he forgave the sins of abraham
[1:12:50] that's why paul said abraham was perfect
[1:12:54] people gave the sin of david
[1:12:58] although we know what david did he
[1:13:00] mentioned
[1:13:01] but god comes and says he's a man after
[1:13:03] my own heart
[1:13:05] why because he wiped away all his sins
[1:13:10] away the sins of the thief on the cross
[1:13:14] the prophet of god says that men never
[1:13:16] went to church any one day
[1:13:21] he probably
[1:13:33] hello
[1:13:58] bye
[1:14:08] the sins of the old testament saints
[1:14:10] [Music]
[1:14:12] but he forgave
[1:14:24] that's why he was willing to pay the
[1:14:26] price
[1:14:28] so he paid for the sins
[1:14:30] that you were going to commit before you
[1:14:32] were even born
[1:14:37] so he cleaned them all out
[1:14:40] and he paid for the sins that you're
[1:14:42] going to do from today on onwards
[1:14:49] because you are a son of god there is no
[1:14:51] sin that can be imputed to you
[1:14:54] you accomplish
[1:15:25] amen
[1:15:26] so do not allow anyone to go with a long
[1:15:28] fish pole to try and fish it from the
[1:15:30] sea forgetfulness
[1:15:38] if god cannot do it
[1:15:40] what is men who is men that has the
[1:15:42] right to go and fish it out
[1:15:48] amen so long you are right with god
[1:15:50] hello
[1:15:52] just like you know that you are
[1:15:54] blameless
[1:15:55] you are sinless visitor
[1:15:58] because he chose you before the
[1:15:59] foundation of the world
[1:16:02] amen that's what he did when he came to
[1:16:04] pay for that debt
[1:16:06] [Music]
[1:16:08] so he took back that book
[1:16:11] he took the abstract to the title
[1:16:15] and he handed it back to man
[1:16:18] the first time we saw it in
[1:16:19] demonstration was at the day of
[1:16:21] pentecost
[1:16:23] where the holy spirit came down and
[1:16:25] filled all of the disciples
[1:16:29] and they left from their performing
[1:16:31] miracles
[1:16:44] it was given back to peter and all the
[1:16:46] disciples
[1:16:50] amen so it had to take that second adam
[1:16:57] a man who was not born was not was not
[1:17:00] born of many
[1:17:03] because we know
[1:17:05] that
[1:17:07] jesus was placed
[1:17:09] into the warm of mary
[1:17:14] he was
[1:17:19] if
[1:17:22] brother branham stayed if god used the
[1:17:24] egg of mary and the gene to to fuse the
[1:17:27] two to
[1:17:28] to make
[1:17:40] but he said mary had
[1:17:43] nothing contributed to it
[1:17:48] god pleased god pleased everything after
[1:17:51] it was already done into the worm of
[1:17:53] mary
[1:17:58] that's why jesus was neither jew nor
[1:17:59] gentile
[1:18:02] but we still have people arguing today
[1:18:04] saying some say jesus was was jewish
[1:18:10] something
[1:18:23] he was the son of god made by god
[1:18:25] himself
[1:18:27] amen
[1:18:30] so he came and he took back the abstract
[1:18:32] to the title
[1:18:36] and placed it back into the hands of man
[1:18:38] who
[1:18:40] no one else was worthy to do it but
[1:18:42] jesus himself
[1:18:46] we see in the book of revelations
[1:18:49] the prophet of god tells us that
[1:18:50] revelations is a book of symbols
[1:18:53] and we see everything already playing
[1:18:55] out there in the book of revelations
[1:19:01] and revelations chapter five verse one
[1:19:03] it says appreciate people
[1:19:06] and i saw in the right hand of him that
[1:19:07] said on the throne a book written within
[1:19:10] and on the backside filled with seven
[1:19:12] seals
[1:19:19] and i saw a strong angel proclaiming
[1:19:21] with a loud voice who is worthy to open
[1:19:23] the book and to loose the seals thereof
[1:19:30] and no man in heaven or in earth neither
[1:19:32] under the earth was able to open the
[1:19:34] book neither to look thereon
[1:19:41] and one of the elders said unto me weep
[1:19:43] not behold the lion of the tribal judah
[1:19:46] the root of david had prevailed to open
[1:19:48] the book and to lose the seals seven
[1:19:50] seals thereof
[1:19:59] amen no one else was worthy
[1:20:02] but jesus christ himself it's just she's
[1:20:04] a christian amen so i was looking at
[1:20:07] this verse and says one of the elders
[1:20:08] said unto me
[1:20:11] and i realized those
[1:20:13] john represents the bride
[1:20:18] and those 24 elders john john was one of
[1:20:22] those 24 elders
[1:20:26] so he was seeing his theory
[1:20:30] when he was looking and seeing those 24
[1:20:32] elders
[1:20:34] he was seeing himself
[1:20:37] he had a representation already in
[1:20:39] heaven
[1:20:41] before the foundation of the world
[1:20:44] he
[1:21:25] when he created the seraphim's cherubims
[1:21:27] and angels
[1:21:30] you were already there
[1:21:32] when he said let there be light
[1:21:35] you were already there with him
[1:21:38] when he created the whole universe
[1:21:42] you were there on the back part of his
[1:21:43] mind
[1:21:45] you're an attribute of god
[1:21:48] you just cannot remember because when
[1:21:50] you were born and came on this earth you
[1:21:51] had amnesia
[1:22:01] amen
[1:22:02] and if you're a bride you have the your
[1:22:04] name in the lamp section of the book of
[1:22:06] life
[1:22:11] [Music]
[1:22:28] for each and every one of us
[1:22:31] and when he died he went down to hell
[1:22:35] and he came and he overcame satan
[1:22:39] in his own kingdom
[1:22:43] amen and when he rose up
[1:22:46] he rose up triumphantly and he emptied
[1:22:48] paradise
[1:22:53] all abraham and david and all the saints
[1:22:56] of old were in paradise locked in there
[1:23:01] they couldn't come out
[1:23:04] but after he shed his blood
[1:23:07] after he
[1:23:08] acclaimed back the book
[1:23:12] he took them out
[1:23:14] they were all raptured and put them into
[1:23:15] the sixth dimension
[1:23:23] amen that's why the power of taking back
[1:23:26] the abstract and putting it back into
[1:23:27] the hands of men dead
[1:23:44] you say what does abstract mean
[1:23:53] amen and he was talking about sin and he
[1:23:55] said it's just like that drop of ink
[1:23:58] when you strike the bleach
[1:24:00] it's a common
[1:24:10] and when sin has been confessed and
[1:24:12] fallen into the blood of jesus christ
[1:24:29] you did not become a son of god
[1:24:32] but you only came to a realization that
[1:24:34] you were a son of god
[1:24:38] its redemption means all legal
[1:24:40] possessions to all that was lost by adam
[1:24:43] and eve
[1:24:49] amen all the legal possessions means you
[1:24:52] possess everything that adam and eve
[1:24:54] lost
[1:25:07] so adam lost that
[1:25:10] abstract to the title
[1:25:14] men could not get back the authority the
[1:25:16] dominion that they had
[1:25:20] then jesus came and paid the debt to the
[1:25:23] abstract of the title oh jesus
[1:26:05] that redemption allowed authority to
[1:26:07] come back into you
[1:26:11] amen and we thank god for the prophet
[1:26:14] william branham
[1:26:16] amen he made us understand the contents
[1:26:19] of this book
[1:26:31] and he was of all the prophets he was
[1:26:34] the tallest of them all
[1:26:37] and his eyes could trace it all the way
[1:26:40] back from whence it originated
[1:26:46] so he's the one who came and told us
[1:26:48] about the abstract
[1:27:15] paul just had a snapshot of it
[1:27:20] and he said we were chosen before the
[1:27:22] foundation of the world
[1:27:25] but when william branham came on the
[1:27:27] scene
[1:27:29] with the full revelation of the world
[1:27:44] he saw the creation of the sun and the
[1:27:46] universe
[1:27:49] amen
[1:27:51] how before angels were even created we
[1:27:53] were there
[1:27:56] so because of that we know where we came
[1:27:58] from
[1:28:11] we walk around knowing
[1:28:27] amen
[1:28:28] and we thank jesus christ
[1:28:31] because he was the only one who was able
[1:28:33] to do it for us
[1:28:36] amen so it doesn't matter how you were
[1:28:38] born on this earth because when you were
[1:28:40] born in this earth you were born with
[1:28:41] amnesia
[1:28:44] you cannot remember what happened before
[1:28:46] the foundation of the world
[1:28:49] [Music]
[1:28:50] it doesn't matter where you were born
[1:28:53] where you were born doesn't determine
[1:28:55] your destiny
[1:28:59] it doesn't matter what your background
[1:29:00] is
[1:29:02] so long your name is in the book
[1:29:06] that you have already made
[1:29:20] when you become a christian and accept
[1:29:22] christ
[1:29:34] it shows that no matter what your father
[1:29:36] did your mother
[1:30:21] how much a human body is worth
[1:30:27] so the 16 elements that make up the
[1:30:29] human body in their quantities they
[1:30:32] amount to 600 dollars
[1:30:40] yes the flesh that you try to take care
[1:30:41] of so much it's only worth 600 dollars
[1:30:46] all the trying that you do and
[1:30:47] everything you do it's just six hundred
[1:30:49] dollars
[1:30:52] i'm not saying you should stop taking
[1:30:54] care of it now
[1:30:57] amen but god took those elements that
[1:30:59] are worth six hundred dollars
[1:31:03] and he created you
[1:31:06] and they say if
[1:31:07] we try to sell a human body
[1:31:12] and i believe no one is going to do this
[1:31:15] if you sell a human body it's worth
[1:31:18] half of a million dollars
[1:31:23] so god was able to appreciate that six
[1:31:26] hundred dollars to five hundred thousand
[1:31:28] dollars
[1:31:34] amen that's how much this flesh is worth
[1:31:40] but your flesh is worth more than that
[1:31:45] although it is made of this of this dust
[1:31:47] of the earth and the 16 elements
[1:31:52] paul told us that we are a temple of the
[1:31:54] almighty god
[1:32:10] you know you not that you are a temple
[1:32:13] of the almighty god
[1:32:16] god wants to use your hands
[1:32:18] god wants to use your lips
[1:32:21] he wants to use your feet
[1:32:24] amen so when you walk you gotta walk
[1:32:26] cognizant knowing that
[1:32:29] i'm a housing deity
[1:32:32] but much more than that is your soul
[1:32:35] worth
[1:32:38] i believe in conference brother branham
[1:32:40] said your soul is worth more than a
[1:32:41] tenth out more than ten thousand words
[1:32:46] that's why satan is trying to that's why
[1:32:48] satan is trying to distract you and get
[1:32:50] you for himself
[1:32:54] because you know he knows how much
[1:32:55] you're worth
[1:32:57] amen but never sell yourself short
[1:33:03] you gotta walk around knowing that i'm
[1:33:05] worth more than ten thousand words
[1:33:09] that's why jesus paid his blood for you
[1:33:14] because you are worth that much to him
[1:33:17] amen you are worth much more than the
[1:33:19] universe
[1:33:26] so don't let anyone else try to lower
[1:33:29] you down or walk down trodden
[1:33:33] amen
[1:33:34] but we thank god that our souls
[1:33:39] he saw them worthy to have that abstract
[1:33:43] it's not because we are smart or we are
[1:33:45] good in any way
[1:33:47] but it's because of amazing grace
[1:33:50] amen that he saw that you were worthy
[1:33:54] amen and it is our duty that we take
[1:33:56] that abstract
[1:34:00] and we use it in the way that god wants
[1:34:02] us to
[1:34:05] because we have a mandate with that book
[1:34:08] we are not just going to keep it and
[1:34:10] walk around with it
[1:34:13] we gotta use it because it was placed in
[1:34:15] your hands for you and me to use
[1:34:31] go and take that little book which is
[1:34:33] open in the hand of the angel which
[1:34:35] stand it upon the sea and upon the earth
[1:34:40] amen
[1:34:42] this was john
[1:34:44] he was being told go take that book
[1:34:48] from the hands of the angel
[1:34:50] just don't leave it dormant there
[1:34:53] but you got to take it for yourself
[1:34:56] and he was told to take it and eat it
[1:34:57] upon
[1:35:10] amen and by eating it we gotta leave
[1:35:12] what the word says
[1:35:16] for that abstract of the title
[1:35:18] to be in effect
[1:35:22] hey man that book was not meant for god
[1:35:25] to keep
[1:35:28] it was meant for you and me to use
[1:35:32] amen when he opened up the seals he gave
[1:35:34] it to john representing the bride
[1:35:40] which was you and me amen and through
[1:35:42] the hearing of the message
[1:35:46] through the hearing of the word
[1:35:49] you saw your name in that book
[1:35:52] you heard your name being called when
[1:35:54] you listened to this message
[1:35:58] it is not meant for everyone
[1:36:02] but those that god chose before the
[1:36:03] foundation of the world
[1:36:06] in each and every age there are people
[1:36:08] who hear the message of the hour
[1:36:11] yeah
[1:36:14] other people cannot comprehend what that
[1:36:15] is
[1:36:17] to them it's noise
[1:36:20] do you remember the days of paul when
[1:36:22] god spoke to paul
[1:36:25] the other people just had thunder
[1:36:28] but paul had a voice
[1:36:30] because he was meant for him
[1:36:34] so other people may not understand this
[1:36:36] message and it's just a lot of confusing
[1:36:38] things
[1:36:41] because it's not meant for them to
[1:36:43] understand
[1:36:45] but you and me we aim in each and every
[1:36:47] word of god
[1:36:50] because
[1:37:18] you just came to the realization by the
[1:37:20] listening of this word
[1:37:24] and you believed it amen
[1:37:27] jeremiah says
[1:37:28] god told jeremiah that i knew you before
[1:37:30] you were in your mother's womb
[1:37:34] so he was already in existence in god's
[1:37:37] mind before he was born
[1:37:41] amen
[1:37:42] and the world is waiting in earnest
[1:37:45] expectation for the manifestations of
[1:37:48] the sons of god
[1:37:53] nature knows that we have a rulership
[1:37:55] over us
[1:37:58] and romans 8 19 tells us that
[1:38:06] creature wait for the manifestation of
[1:38:08] the sons of god
[1:38:14] amen nature means having men talking to
[1:38:17] it
[1:38:21] because that was god's original plan
[1:38:25] amen and we know the title comes in with
[1:38:27] the deadpool ministries
[1:38:38] it was a sign that as you have seen him
[1:38:40] doing this
[1:38:56] giving back life to that little fish
[1:39:00] because the authority had been brought
[1:39:01] back into the sons of god
[1:39:05] so you and me we have the same power too
[1:39:10] to speak to nature to speak to our
[1:39:12] circumstances
[1:39:15] because we have the abstract to the
[1:39:16] title back in our hands
[1:39:21] so we don't have to work
[1:39:24] not knowing who we are
[1:39:27] so we have that inheritance that was our
[1:39:29] inheritance
[1:39:31] placed back into our hands
[1:39:35] amen the prophet of god talks about this
[1:39:37] analogy
[1:39:40] he says
[1:39:41] now our kinsman is handed the seven
[1:39:43] sealed book of redemption from the
[1:39:44] original honor
[1:39:48] um
[1:39:51] it is
[1:40:30] is the title deed of redemption that's
[1:40:32] our title deeds
[1:40:36] he breaks the seals reveals and gives us
[1:40:39] the inheritance to his people
[1:40:44] he gives the inheritance that he
[1:40:46] inherited becoming the king's redeemer
[1:41:02] your
[1:41:15] if you have if your family had land
[1:41:18] for me
[1:41:20] and you happen to be in exile for for a
[1:41:22] certain reason
[1:41:26] and someone comes in and to stay on that
[1:41:31] they land their property and put things
[1:41:33] over there
[1:41:37] it doesn't matter how much
[1:41:39] appreciation they did to the land or how
[1:41:40] long they stayed there
[1:41:44] if you come with an abstract to the
[1:41:46] title
[1:41:48] that's written your name on it
[1:41:51] you have the right to tell those people
[1:41:52] to walk out of your land
[1:41:56] you have to you have the right to get
[1:41:58] the land restored back to you
[1:42:02] because your name is on the title deed
[1:42:07] amen the prophet is telling us that
[1:42:09] everything that god owned it's for us to
[1:42:11] use
[1:42:17] so you have the right to walk up to
[1:42:19] satan and say satan get out of here this
[1:42:21] is my land
[1:42:25] good health is yours
[1:42:28] about you got a right to walk to satan
[1:42:30] and say satan get away from my health
[1:42:32] this is my inheritance
[1:42:39] if you have a lost loved one
[1:42:42] that you want to claim
[1:42:44] the salvation
[1:42:47] you have the right to walk to satan and
[1:42:49] say satan let go
[1:42:54] because you have your god-given rights
[1:42:58] the holy spirit will enforce it
[1:43:01] because it is your name is written on
[1:43:04] the deed
[1:43:07] amen so no weapon formed against you
[1:43:10] shall prosper
[1:43:14] the bible says that's an inheritance
[1:43:17] so you're able to go claim it and say
[1:43:19] nothing that the devil said against me
[1:43:22] will ever prosper
[1:43:33] let us stand up on our feet
[1:43:38] [Applause]
[1:43:42] we thank god for the opening of the
[1:43:44] seals
[1:43:46] we thank god for the cross
[1:43:50] we thank god for protesting our
[1:43:51] salvation
[1:43:54] amen because we would have been lost
[1:43:58] but because he decided to come down
[1:44:02] and he was willing to shed his blood
[1:44:07] we are more than conquerors
[1:44:10] and we have the title deed back in our
[1:44:12] hand
[1:44:16] we can walk in back and tell satan to
[1:44:18] get off our property
[1:44:24] you can tell satan to walk away from
[1:44:25] your family
[1:44:28] because that is your inheritance
[1:44:31] you can tell satan to walk away
[1:44:44] amen we are thankful for the blood
