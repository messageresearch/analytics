to be here again and to stand to stand before you one more time amen without uh taking too much time let's go straight to the word director amen we will open our bibles in the book of john saint john chapter 1 amen we read this verse uh on sunday when we preached with demons amen will try to continue with the same thought john construct amen and we'll start from here saint john chapter one we read the verse 1 and the verse 14. of the same chapter amen the bible says that in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god. now verse 14 the bible says again and the word and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld this glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth in glory zombies says young version first timothy chapter three verse 16. amen the bible says and with that controversy great is the mystery of godliness god was manifest in the flesh justifying the spirit sin of angels preached unto the gentiles believed believed on in the world received up into glory or to say thank you for the mercy lord thank you for everything that you have done for us lord we pray father god that the same spirit o father lord that god with us so father god during the song service lord be with us lord again but we pray father god that you have the preeminence of the service of god lord and you'll be exalted above all lord i pray father god that you help me lord man lord to be so sensitive to the holy spirit lord so that i can say whatever you want me to say lord lord i pray for the hearts that will hear the word don't let this word just be a knowledge or something that will help us understanding only okay the lord let us father god change our hearts this evening uh we have a little subject a little subject that we wanted to talk about i intelligent he became son when he became son amen still going with the same uh thought that we had last sunday when we praised continue amen as a review uh of what we preached on sunday amen before everything was created amen before even time began when god was a thought dreading amen and then that thought expressed itself he said and from that time that's when time began it is likely amen that's when john wrote here in john chapter one verse one that in the beginning was the word amen that was when god spoke the word that's when time began amen and then that same god is remembered amen who was a thought amen who became the word has now become flesh and then has lived with us amen will try to go by the grace of god with that word with that uh idea it's a long constructivity amen of god being the eternal god who was mercury amen because the bible says that men cancer they had no beginning of time and no end of days amen so it was impossible for mercury to feel what we were feeling it was impossible for him to be sick and it was impossible for him to be hungry became flesh as john is telling us here in chapter 1 verse 14. feel meant to be tempted as we are tempted to be tried as we are trying to be hungry as we get hungry it meant to be sick as we are sick sinless and him and he didn't have a house so that we can have a house he didn't have a family or nobody received him he was rejected of his own brothers women to accept he has his bride that's the reason why he had to become son that's the reason why he had to become a flesh for us foreign that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold first our profession [Music] which cannot be attached with the feelings of our infirmities but was in no points tempted like as we are yet without sin so now let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need with the feelings of our infirmities amen whatever whenever you hurt hello chuck of him and jesus is church whenever you're sick visit my life amen he is touched he knows exactly what you're going through he takes like the most he knows exactly amen what sickness you're dealing with exactly he knows exactly what is going on with your life he takes like the most sick man so we just have to come as the bible said boldly to that throne of grace whatever that belongs to us remember we have to come boldly blame our rights that means that your forgiveness was fulfilled that means that your healing was fulfilled so when you find yourself sick you just have to go back to that calvary you're just gonna have to go back to that tree that belongs to you and he became he became man he came by the woman he lived but he wasn't of the woman even he came by the woman he wasn't shall be with a child [Music] is god god with us jesus was god with us jesus that word that john said when he became flesh amen and dwelt among own feasts i mean he had to become a son of peace amen so that's why that's what we have that's why the trinitarians are confused people who believe in trinity they're all confused some of them will say well we only believe in one god but the father is different from the son and the son different from the spirit yes he says that in the message the water baptism uh paragraph 146 to 147. he says now in this the father son and the holy ghost amen and the prophet said that the largest is that pillar of fire the prophet even so now the prophet he says that after he dwelt in that pill of fire then came down and made himself a body a man brought himself down to a tent down a ton of human flesh and dwelt in it without controversy paul speaking paul paula great is the mystery of godliness for god was made before god was manifest in the flesh see the creator became savior couldn't even get around where where he was at me then he became son appreciated that we could touch him and he was because the scene of the human race because of the scene of the human race amen great great is the mystery of godliness amen let's read it again i think it's in first timothy chapter um chapter 3 without controversy it's uncontrolled great is the mystery of godliness let me self-defeat go amen you see here the bible says that god was manifest in flesh manifesting amen god was manifest jew city manifested in he's not the bible is not talking about another being or another person that there is three persons in korean god seen of angels he defeated his own women the same god remember women was preached unto the gentiles the same god amen we believed on his word we will believe done in the world amen so now god coming then now god had to come under three sons name amen so we see that the son of man his first coming woman he had to come as the son of man amen talking about jesus jesus the son of man is a prophet amen it's found in ezekiel chapter 12 verse 1 to 6. amen you see here that ezekiel was called the son of man and every prophet is shocked prophet he's considered as the son of man he considered amen that's why you will see that when god visited abraham well because the prophet says that that was god that was the theophany that was the word the prophet the word going to a son of man who was abraham because abraham was a prophet amen the word goes to the prophet says the same type that has to go throughout 38 ages and the bible says that the word of the lord also came unto me saying that which have eyes to see and see not they have ears to hear and hear or not for they are a rebellious house constitution therefore thou son of man prepare thee still for removing and remove by day in their side and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their side of ezekiel was called the son of man amen as a prophet amen he had to calm down as the son of man confessed to lamb amen because the bible says amen moses says that he will uh uh uh uh uh uh and there shall be a prophet like unto layla you shall raise up a prophet that come to me amen talking about jesus who was supposed to come under jesus you see that jesus was the son of man jesus was the son of man man he was different than all the son of man amen because those sons of men amen they have they had to wait for a certain revelation amen but jesus himself was the word jesus he knew everything so now the bible says here i mean you see that when jesus came into the coast of caesarea he lost which is real if you don't don't do you understand that if you read the entire bible or when jesus was still alive you'll see that jesus never called himself as the son of god feasts jesus never called himself as the son of god he called himself as the son of man now you asked but what's the difference between son of man and son of god if there's demons unconfessed amen the son of man confused when you see jesus jesus flesh and blood amen a human being walking through amen but when he came down velocity did this andrea man he wasn't the son of god he was the son of man because for him to be the become a son of god so he couldn't come as the son of god as being in the human flesh so that's why when he came down as the holy ghost he came as the son of god being in the spirit as god is in the spirit he don't don't don't only speak i'm jewish so that's the reason why you will never find jesus referring himself as a son of god because the word of god is perfect because there is of the heart amen revealing this the ministry of the son of man to the jews amen but there is no way in the bible or nowhere in the bible that jesus shows that same ministry to the gentiles because when he first came to blackpool he didn't come for the gentiles he came for his brothers he promised it's found it's found it's found in luke chapter 1 chapter 21 verse 24. the bible says that that and there shall fall by the age of the sword and it shall be led away captive into all nations and jesus shall be thrown down by the gentiles amen if you go to matthew chapter 24 verse 36 to 34 uh 37. but of that day an hour no worth amen that's why you will see what i because amen the same things that jesus did remember it again amen i'm looking for that quote um amen you'll see that jesus jesus as the son of man that's as the son of man amen he tell that woman from secret of her heart amen in john chapter 4 verse 15 to 19 we're not going to read it jesus that was jesus doing the ministry of the son of man see this is a complication so the same gift the same son of man gift brother amen also a woman amen who excuse me sister excuse me sir i have to relax my mind once in a while relax now i see that you're strictly a stranger to me meaning that he doesn't know her and he doesn't know anything about her concerns now he started saying that you from you from you from away from here emma you've come from another city you've got a lot of trouble on your heart i see a black sheep keep following you like that oh it's a lie somebody stole the light on you and that was a man professing divine healing you got a whole story in your church you gotta you got a holster in your church or something isn't that right your pastor is sick right now he's got polio is that right she said yes sir that's with me sister don't pay no attention to what them people tell you they are lying in mountains and the only things wrong with your heart elasticized nervous condition condition you got your heart worked up and god bless you to be nice you're all right god bless you very much amen i feel like reading the the this verse that i told that i said that we're not going to read it amen and and then that woman amen that woman replied and then she said that how is it that thou being a jew drink of me with the montreal in which the jews and samaria you know something was going wrong between them amen then jesus answered and said unto her if that knew was the gift of god and who is that saith who who it is that saith to thee give me to drink that would have acts of me and he would uh and he would have given the living water amen so verse 14. but whosoever drinketh of the water [Music] that that i shall give him shall never thirst by the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into the everlasting life so now the woman says unto him sir give me this water don't waste now jesus here he's now uh uh discerning her heart even the woman answered and said i have no husband the family foundation jesus said unto her jesus that was well said i have no husbands for thou has now has had five amen it was that ministry that jesus has to revere of being a prophet and prophet even of being the son of man amen you'll find it again in john chapter 1 verse 48 amen what he was doing previously what he was doing before coming to him and you will see that the prophet did the same thing by by the grace of god that gifted the same thing in the prophets in the message the deep call it to the deep the message i mean if you read the paragraph 51 and 52. amen you will see that the prophet did the same thing telling telling telling the uh uh uh telling that person what it was doing before in the previous time you know the name of of his name and his father's his father's name you know when he first met him when he first met him jesus didn't know to the deep civilization the prophet says that i know there is a dark spirit the prophet is seeing hanging hanging hanging at you yet it's something very serious i see your name is eva and your last name is york you don't know and you live in this city and your house number is 613 6th street that he will do the same thing when the son of man change he changed their body so the same thing had to happen when the son of man will be revealed amen he will tell he will give he will have the gift of the discernment because it was it's the same thing they've actually mentioned women you'll see that god sent the prophet william with a message of restoration with the message of revelation and with the message of the rapture you know with the message of restoration amen i'm not really going to go in deep about this i'm just going to give you scriptures and you can go and read it for your own there the bible says that jesus must remain in heaven until the restoration of all things to restore all things chapter 4 verse 5 to 6. the spirit of elijah will be on a prophet amen whose ministry shall turn their heart of the son to their father amen it's found in luke chapter 17 24-30 and that's daniel chapter 12 for this for the night amen that refers to the the hearts of that loving that such the seed of the serpent and and the original seeds the evidence of the baptism on the holy ghost the video amended three words of grace and and salvation amen talking about justification sanctification and and the baptism of the holy spirit is justification even he came and he told us that there is no women angels feminine and there is no women preachers amen there there is a difference between eternal hell and everlasting hell eternal eternal and every i don't know if in french you can really make that difference because it's all the same like every lasting hell thank you you know saying that there is no eternal hell because the hell has an end i mean but it's an everlasting one messi the message of revelation amen the message of revelation amen amen amen amen bringing up uh we've been prophet revealed 12 bible mysteries the prophet which is found in matthew chapter 13 verse 3 to 50. ephesians 4 chapter ephesians chapter 4 verse 11 to 16. the mysteries of iniquity second thessalonians the second testation of chapter 2 verse 7. amen the mystery of god and christ or the godhead the mystery of the godhead divinity amen colossians chapter 2 chapter 2 verse 2 of 9. israel blindness and to to the messiah during the church of the the church age of gentiles of the dispensation of the gentiles in roman chapter 11 verse 25. luke 21 and 24. the mystery of translation of the living sense with resurrected sense of or all the rapture the sound or the rapture first is first establishing uh chapter four verse 14 of 17. we kind of talked about that last sunday the new testament church composed of both jews and gentiles amen is found in ephesians chapter 2 verse 11 to 22. ephesians to seven the action peter says man he had to reveal about the seven stars amen that's found in revelation chapter one verse 16 to 20. the mystery of babylon so his message has to come is so messaged even to reveal all of this and many more amen the same god who was a thought in the beginning he became a word amen it's something great to know that jesus is praying for himself amen you see that jesus is still praying for him that's why you man you will find yourself being in church you won't even know how am i here but i said last time i'm not coming anymore but because there is somebody who is praying for you amen there is somebody who's praying for you he told peter in in luke chapter 22 verse 30 21 to 32 this is the last scripture and the lord said simon simon simon behold for them that thy faith fell not i thank you for the fire and when they were converted to strengthen thy brethren amen simon i have prayed for you even i know hard i know that all these things are coming you can keep the faith and when you become when you're converted in a meaning that when you receive the holy spirit women will go and strengthen your brethren because being converted it doesn't mean that you you a penguin pentecost or you were in the catholic church and you joined the message that's not being converted being converted doesn't mean that you were in atheism where you you didn't believe uh you you weren't going to church and now you start going to church that's not being converted amen because if that was being converted i mean you will say that judas was converted jesus said that father if you read in john chapter 17 i pray amen that you keep those that i belong you gave me to be one to god amen because i haven't lost any of them it means that you receive the holy spirit because of the holy spirit god dwells inside of you and as we said it last sunday you received the holy spirit amen you are born again then that body starts from the from being rich inside [Applause] so he said that be converted when you come forward strengthen your breath because that's the only way you can do that if you're converted because that won't be you living by god living inside of you amen you have first to be converted amen i have prayed for you but even though i have prayed for you mmm foreign the son of god coming the feast of juveniles amen as the holy spirit until something meant to dwell inside of you that we can become the tabernacle of god in ezekiel amen amen well i need to find a place to stop amen we'll continue the same thing on sunday amen about that change uh who became son he did all of that to save you and he had to go through all these things to save you i don't take it lightly amen because the prophet says that jesus is not the eternal son of god any forgiveness of sin anymore hey so when there is still time they may run into the ark because the destruction is coming the only way to be saved will thank you this song amazing grace
