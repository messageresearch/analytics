[30:03] enemies triumph over you that's the song
[30:07] you sing because we are accepted in the
[30:13] beloved hallelujah is not by works lest
[30:19] any man should boast but is by the grace
[30:24] of God I am so grateful cuz none of us
[30:30] would make it if we had to produce that
[30:33] kind of work but thank God that he
[30:36] worked for us and all we have to do is
[30:39] believe in trust in what he has done for
[30:41] us and then God will do the rest
[30:44] amen gillich Florida brother Troy such a
[30:50] nice man a wonderful message I don't
[30:52] like to use the word nice it was more
[30:54] than that it was powerful because of him
[30:57] Preston on my heart and it gave me some
[31:02] wonderful thoughts and so I I just went
[31:06] home and then I just let God work with
[31:10] me on on some more I hope it's a
[31:14] blessing you trust that it will be one
[31:16] but as we stand let us turn to Matthew
[31:19] the sixth out of the third chapter Matt
[31:22] through three and we're going to read
[31:25] the 16th through the splinting verse
[31:28] amen so glad to have our brother Samuel
[31:32] bad I like to hear that corner talk to
[31:37] me
[31:38] even we appreciate him and thank God for
[31:43] His goodness brother I've been so busy
[31:44] my apology I didn't forget about you I
[31:47] should have called you though but you
[31:49] know God has been so good to us and I
[31:52] want you to understand by God's grace
[31:55] faith is not something that you put off
[31:58] that's hope I'm hoping God faith is now
[32:03] now faith is not anything is not now is
[32:09] hope I even I even text a friend of mine
[32:14] and sent him a little thought and I
[32:17] talked because he's a he needs healing
[32:19] and I show that you've been hoping well
[32:23] I know God is going to do it it says is
[32:27] done it is the now thing and what people
[32:32] don't understand is that faith is
[32:34] something God gives you
[32:36] you can't mentally believe this it is
[32:39] something that God must drop in your
[32:42] heart otherwise you're gonna be
[32:44] struggling with stuff that you you're
[32:47] not going to accomplish anything
[32:48] you're hoping and the Bible doesn't say
[32:52] then hope please God the Bible says
[32:55] faith so if you don't have to faith who
[32:57] you ask you ask God for it it is a gift
[33:02] from God
[33:03] Matthew the 3rd chapter I so loved the
[33:07] Lord this is a time when Satan is trying
[33:12] to distract the true believers of God
[33:15] and he's doing whatever he can do to
[33:19] upset you or to make you feel if art is
[33:23] forgotten about you now you can believe
[33:26] Goliath preaching if you like but as
[33:31] Goliath preached to David David returned
[33:34] preach to Goliath and God like I said
[33:38] I'm gonna kill you and then you must be
[33:41] mistaken this day I have the victory
[33:46] and he began to preach back to Goliath
[33:50] but amplifying it in other words I'm the
[33:55] one that's gonna kill you
[33:56] and I'm the one that's gonna take your
[33:59] head off and I don't even have a sword
[34:03] to do it but I'm gonna take your sword
[34:10] and take your head off right the very
[34:13] words you have spoken to me I'm gonna
[34:16] speak them back to you but the word in
[34:19] which I speak won't come back boy that's
[34:25] how you had to preach to the devil
[34:26] you're a preacher reach back to him
[34:30] Matthew 3:16 through 17 and Jesus when
[34:35] he was baptized went up straightway out
[34:39] of the water and lo the heavens were
[34:44] opened unto him and he saw the Spirit of
[34:47] God descending like a dove and
[34:51] lightening on him and lo a voice from
[34:56] heaven saying this is my beloved Son in
[35:00] whom I am well pleased
[35:06] let us pray father we come before your
[35:08] Lord and we thank you for your grace
[35:10] your mercy we thank you for being so
[35:13] good to us Lord your heart fixed on a
[35:17] mine regulator and we thank you in Jesus
[35:20] Christ's name for your love and grace
[35:22] and mercy that you bestow upon us each
[35:26] and every day thank you dear Jesus let
[35:29] your glory be seen in this place tonight
[35:31] reveal your word to our hearts and may
[35:35] it follow God on good ground that it may
[35:38] bring forth a hundredfold in Jesus
[35:41] Christ's name we pray amen
[35:43] you may be seated
[35:50] trusting the Lord to deliver this as
[35:56] always may he give us grace to move
[36:01] completely out of his way I thought
[36:07] about the nature of God and when I and
[36:12] as I thought about the nature of God I
[36:15] thought about God how he symbolizes his
[36:19] nature with certain animals and certain
[36:24] characteristics it's kind of like what
[36:26] our brother Troy was bringing how God
[36:30] liken himself as a dove and a lamb and
[36:34] we know that I would have entitled it
[36:37] the nature of God is like unto a dove
[36:41] now but I'm going to hit other
[36:43] characteristics too but I want to reuse
[36:45] the Dove because that's the nature we
[36:48] must have if we're going to make a
[36:52] rapture we must have the same anointing
[36:56] that anointed Jesus even though he was a
[37:02] lion in me and a brother was talking
[37:04] about that the other day can you imagine
[37:07] if the priest had to catch a lion and
[37:14] sacrifice a lion and can you imagine the
[37:18] struggles they would have had if they
[37:21] had to make sure that there was no spot
[37:23] or blemish hey I thought that was pretty
[37:33] good but God needed something with no
[37:39] resistance whoo I love it
[37:42] and he knew
[37:45] that he could not send no one else
[37:50] outside of himself because really in his
[37:54] creation there should have been no
[37:56] resistance but we find out that when he
[38:00] created Lucifer Lucifer was the first to
[38:05] resist and according to the message Amen
[38:09] we understand that Lucifer was like
[38:10] God's right hand he was a a covering
[38:15] cherub beautiful the most beautiful
[38:19] angel in heaven that's why we know that
[38:22] that's where evil lies in beauty when we
[38:28] think about goddess as a dove and we
[38:33] know he is the word David said he's my
[38:36] battle axe he he he's mine and we think
[38:43] about how the god in this last day
[38:47] completed the message with a dove he
[38:52] started it with the dumb because when
[38:55] Jesus were baptized unto the Jordan
[38:59] right he was identified by John because
[39:04] of the light that came down like a dove
[39:10] and when the prophet of God came to a
[39:14] place where the was complete he was
[39:19] visited by a snow-white girl he calls it
[39:24] the seventh dove and we realize by God's
[39:29] grace in order for us to make a rapture
[39:32] we must bear the same spirit and God
[39:38] must say to us I'm we're pleased to
[39:43] dwell within you when we think about a
[39:48] dog we think about the innocence because
[39:54] a dove is innocent I used to eat them
[39:58] years ago but I didn't know any better
[40:00] but I do know why I believe the Lord
[40:02] allowed me to eat them because they were
[40:04] sweet and I want to say it like this the
[40:10] reason why it was so sweet because
[40:11] that's the way I look at Jesus and in
[40:14] order to understand what I'm saying that
[40:17] same dog must be eaten it wasn't just a
[40:24] sacrifice but that sacrifice was eaten
[40:28] and dog meat is sweet it's innocent
[40:35] because he doesn't have gall
[40:38] there's nothing bitter about it you know
[40:42] how some meats you can eat in it you got
[40:44] to be careful cuz there's a part that
[40:45] just doesn't taste as good but the dog
[40:49] has no goal is like our liver we have a
[40:52] liver that literally cleanses our blood
[40:55] gall battling all of that working
[40:57] together to keep it clean but you see
[40:59] that's because we eat unclean things but
[41:03] a dog eats no unclean thing he doesn't
[41:07] need a gall he doesn't need inside
[41:10] anything to purify himself because he is
[41:13] pure and clean inside matter of fact
[41:16] he's so clean inside he it washes the
[41:20] outside now when it comes to a job you
[41:24] always think about gentleness you think
[41:27] about kinder Ness we take a piece and we
[41:32] can see that in a dog but you got to
[41:34] understand if the Dove is in us we must
[41:37] see that in us when we talk about a dove
[41:42] like I said we talk about gentle an
[41:45] innocent person or a tender person
[41:50] that's what the Bobbie said about Jesus
[41:54] God the great
[41:56] this man on earth came down and likened
[42:02] himself to a dog understand a man when
[42:10] it came to the dog when he was offered
[42:11] up as a sin offering
[42:13] it wasn't sliced or cut in two because
[42:19] the Holy Ghost is not divided the same
[42:23] Holy Ghost they had in the Old Testament
[42:26] it's the same Holy Ghost they have in
[42:29] the new he is the same yesterday today
[42:32] and forever and you and I ought to be a
[42:38] reflection of this dog and the
[42:44] reflection is an image or a
[42:46] representation or a counterpart in the
[42:50] physic realm
[42:51] it is the very the return of light or
[42:54] heat or sound y'all know them so about
[42:57] have you ever had a are a piece of metal
[43:01] and you take that metal and you let the
[43:03] Sun hit it and the heat of that metal
[43:07] will reflect from the metal to you or
[43:10] let's put it this way have you ever had
[43:12] what we call a spyglass one of those
[43:14] speaking what they call them now they
[43:17] take that thing and you let that spirit
[43:20] that that that heat from the Sun focused
[43:23] amen and all of a sudden you can you can
[43:25] set something on fire
[43:26] hallelujah maybe that's what we need
[43:29] tonight we need a glass amen they can
[43:33] take that Sun and let it begin down you
[43:36] know gets our souls of fire when Jesus
[43:42] when they saw Jesus and you know they
[43:46] didn't know who he was but John did and
[43:49] John Dean said behold the tub of God he
[43:54] said behold the lamb of God that takes
[43:57] away the sins of the world but you got
[44:01] to understand there was a dog leading
[44:04] the lake
[44:07] hallelujah and when that dog came down
[44:10] the lujah and feel that body called
[44:13] Jesus he was led into the wilderness
[44:16] forty days and there he conquered the
[44:19] devil
[44:20] hallelujah so what I'm trying to tell
[44:23] you in that when the Holy Ghost comes
[44:25] you becomes a conqueror that duh you
[44:32] conquer by the dog dumb Oh somebody I
[44:38] innocent down a little bird that that
[44:42] has no fight in it and that's how you
[44:46] conquer you understand what I'm saying
[44:51] I'm working with something so you can
[44:52] understand Amen that we don't conquer
[44:55] and then by physical means we don't even
[45:00] conquer by feeling like we're great
[45:04] hallelujah yeah so did you understand
[45:10] when we look at these things and you see
[45:13] well what about this lamb what about
[45:15] this done because they had nature's that
[45:17] were compatible as brother Troy brought
[45:21] up amen when you when you're working
[45:23] with that that dog that nature of a lamb
[45:26] Amen that devil come down and light in
[45:28] on you hallelujah but when you try that
[45:32] lamb into a goat but I believe the word
[45:38] of God but I believe it meant God is
[45:41] gonna answer prayer but see that little
[45:45] that dog takes his flight because your
[45:49] nature has changed you can't object to
[45:54] anything God says it must be amen
[45:59] either you like it or not remember amen
[46:05] in the fifth chapter of Revelation when
[46:08] the lamb John wept and began to cry and
[46:14] he didn't know what to do because he saw
[46:16] always good was lost
[46:19] and John knew he wasn't worthy to open
[46:22] the book he wasn't really worthy to
[46:25] loose the seals there are but the Bible
[46:28] says it meant that there was a mighty
[46:30] angel a strong angel said we'd not for
[46:35] the Lion of the tribe of Judah now watch
[46:38] this
[46:38] he was once a lamb on earth but now he's
[46:42] a lion in heaven but how was the
[46:45] transformation how was that lion changed
[46:48] into a I mean i'd like that let that
[46:51] lamb change into a lion or the lion turn
[46:57] into a lamb however you want to look at
[47:00] it but it was God amen displaying his
[47:03] attributes through animals because the
[47:06] lamb was the weakest of all creatures
[47:09] but the lion he's the king of all
[47:12] creatures hallelujah he was transformed
[47:15] from a lion to a lamb from a lamb to a
[47:18] lion is that right Wow you see what
[47:22] brother was what are you saying you are
[47:23] Lions but God had right this point in
[47:27] time wants you to be a leg priests and
[47:33] kings hallelujah
[47:40] weep not for the Lion of the tribe of
[47:43] Judah the root of David he has prevailed
[47:47] I understand what he's saying the root
[47:51] of David
[47:52] that means two strengths of David not
[47:54] beginning of David whatever David was
[47:57] came from the root and that root came
[48:01] from the seed hallelujah understand by
[48:04] God's grace he said listen the root of
[48:07] David he had prevailed a man conquered
[48:10] in other words he's worthy to take the
[48:13] book and Garson let that Holy Ghost be
[48:17] in you as it was in Christ Jesus if that
[48:22] same spirit being you as it quickened
[48:25] his body it will also quicken yours
[48:28] hallelujah and the Bible tells us those
[48:32] who overcome this age will sit in my
[48:36] throne even as I've said in my father's
[48:40] throne
[48:40] that means as God gave him rulership he
[48:44] then gives you rulership it's worth
[48:48] fighting for it's worth dying out to
[48:53] don't let this moment pass you by
[49:01] people looking at me because of the
[49:04] things that's happening with my children

[49:29] man can take it from you
[49:31] I don't know what all they got to go
[49:34] through but they're mine and that's
[49:37] Moses said I'll not leave one hook
[49:39] behind don't look at me like I'm
[49:42] supposed to be crying hallelujah
[49:44] but I'm shouting the victory already it
[49:48] ain't if now faith what I'm trying to
[49:55] say Amen there times when you have to
[49:58] start you know fighting you are lamb but

[50:13] there God's throne he was only inside of
[50:16] his sanctuary listen and he hadn't seen
[50:19] him to this time so John was expecting
[50:23] to see a limb a lion come forth but he
[50:28] saw a lamb come on somebody

[50:46] over this by my power by my might but
[50:49] let me give you me read something to you
[50:53] but this lion didn't fight that way and
[50:58] she said there you are brothers through
[51:00] meekness through sweetness through the
[51:04] holy spirit that we conquer not some
[51:08] great mighty intellectual giant but he
[51:11] that can humble himself is the man who
[51:13] conquers the man who can can be kicked
[51:17] around and still be a servant of Christ
[51:20] that's the Conqueror did they all know
[51:25] I'm taking this and oh well you give it

[54:36] 12 it says now therefore perform the
[54:40] doing of it that as there was a
[54:42] readiness of will so there may be a
[54:45] performer's also out of that which you
[54:47] have but if there be a will first a
[54:50] willing mind it is accepted according to
[54:53] that a man have and not according to
[54:56] that he hath not hallelujah I have a
[55:00] willing mind I have a desire to be
[55:03] perfect
[55:03] hallelujah sure
[55:05] like my lord and he it is up to the Holy
[55:09] Spirit to bring me to that perfection
[55:11] it's already accepted if I die now I go
[55:16] to heaven if I die now I'll be included
[55:20] in the bride ah because my desire is to
[55:24] be perfect just like yeah before I hit
[55:30] the floor brother rich my perfection
[55:33] will be right there he said it if you
[55:39] got a Willie mine it's already counted
[55:43] as being done whoo thank God for the
[55:45] willing life not him that Willie or he
[55:49] that run it all run it but God this
[55:52] shows mercy but see you can't have a
[55:54] will mine until God gives it to you I'm
[55:56] not talking a human willing to my God's
[55:58] will
[55:59] mm the nature's of God how can it be a
[56:05] lion and also a lamb hmm you got to go
[56:11] back to Isaiah ain't got to realize Amen
[56:14] that Isaiah he said the lion and the
[56:17] lamb laid down together they was
[56:20] fighting not one of them wanted to eat
[56:23] each other that was before the fall so
[56:27] he's got to bring your nature back
[56:29] before the fall till you have the kind
[56:32] of nature that had in the beginning
[56:37] that's why the Bible said you gotta love
[56:39] your enemy love your brother
[56:44] hey somebody why because that nature
[56:47] that God gives you you I've never seen a
[56:51] door fight have you ever seen a dog
[56:53] fight and we ever seen a lamb Lambs you
[56:58] I don't know about them but have you
[57:00] seen him fight now I mean you get around
[57:03] nine another round come yeah they don't
[57:07] get you I kind of like those RAM but you
[57:10] gotta watch him
[57:12] those Rams will RAM you they did not
[57:14] call around for nothing right and you
[57:18] think about the lion a man is the king
[57:21] of the jungle
[57:25] that means he's king over all the
[57:27] animals even the crickets hush when he
[57:31] roars he is a shadow and a type of God
[57:39] the Lord is in his holy temple what
[57:44] you're supposed to do keep silent that
[57:48] all the earth keep silent what that
[57:51] means when he's in his temple you don't
[57:53] have one word you don't have a say so
[57:57] he's in his temple he's the one that
[58:00] speak you listen you obey Oh somebody
[58:06] help me limbs like I said it's a Mekas
[58:10] of all I'm getting back to the Dove in
[58:11] just a moment it has no real defense
[58:15] system no sense of leadership he is a
[58:20] follower by nature it's considered a
[58:24] dumb animal see a lot of us that's
[58:26] what's wrong with a lot of people in the
[58:27] message I thought my god I said we need
[58:31] to just establish an institution amen so
[58:33] that you know everybody can get a higher
[58:36] and a deeper understanding of the
[58:38] message see that's what the
[58:39] denominations did that's exactly what
[58:43] they did instead of getting the people
[58:45] to the Holy Ghost they wanted to get
[58:47] them to a greater intellectual of it why
[58:50] God isn't gonna do us if we have not
[58:53] been born again is that right
[58:56] God came right on down to a man who was
[59:00] so smart by the name of Nicodemus a
[59:03] Pharisee who had it all intellectually
[59:06] wrapped up in his own little scroll
[59:09] Nicodemus you must be born again and he
[59:16] just says something real simple to the
[59:18] Pharisees and all the same except you
[59:20] believe that I am he you should likewise
[59:22] dying your sin if you don't believe
[59:25] Holy Ghost is God you're going to die in
[59:28] your sins and you need to know that the
[59:30] Holy Ghost meet built you for one
[59:33] purpose that he may occupy your body
[59:39] didn't bill you amen your body for
[59:42] nothing else but his holiness y'all
[59:46] believe that now you know I know that if
[59:49] a lamb have a lamb and a limb have a
[59:51] baby it's going to be a lamb you've
[59:54] never seen a sheep have a goat but now
[59:57] the way they're doing things now I don't
[59:58] know what might happen down the road but
[1:00:00] in his natural order every seed bring
[1:00:04] forth of his kind I love the scripture
[1:00:07] says for in him we live and move and
[1:00:12] have our being in him you can't even get
[1:00:18] out of him is that right that's what
[1:00:23] that's what the psalmist said he's David
[1:00:25] said if I if I take the weeds of a dull
[1:00:27] and fried to the uttermost part of the
[1:00:30] earth now are they if I make my bed in
[1:00:35] hell thou art there so if he's in hell
[1:00:38] he's on earth though you can't get away
[1:00:41] he is you're the very breath that you
[1:00:44] have is operated by him and as soon as
[1:00:47] he twists to flip the switch and said
[1:00:50] that's enough I don't care it's over
[1:00:52] just give me five more years yeah hmm
[1:00:59] and you and I must understand does this
[1:01:02] devil got it like I told you I preached
[1:01:04] last week or life right I preached on
[1:01:07] showed you there's another life I'm
[1:01:09] living to live huh how do you wanna say
[1:01:15] it
[1:01:16] oh I'm dying to live he's away I'm doing
[1:01:19] it to live and there's a better life
[1:01:23] than this one this life was was cloaked
[1:01:26] by SLUSA for the devil in the beginning
[1:01:29] and told Eve you gonna have a better
[1:01:31] life if you do what I do you're gonna
[1:01:34] know good and even it's gonna be better
[1:01:36] than what you got better
[1:01:39] look what we're dealing with now and the
[1:01:42] devil does the same thing to you let me
[1:01:44] tell you something
[1:01:45] nothing's gonna make you happy I don't
[1:01:48] can't listen that's what the truth
[1:01:50] sometimes people get excited
[1:01:52] oh that cheeping man I haven't ceased
[1:01:54] I'm like the woman in the world and the
[1:01:56] way of five or six
[1:01:57] what was she thirsting for Jesus met her
[1:02:02] at the well because he knew what she was
[1:02:05] thirsting for and then she thought I
[1:02:08] could find this thing in a minute I
[1:02:10] don't care you can sleep a million times
[1:02:12] with him you'll never find peace back it
[1:02:15] ain't there women is a woman either it
[1:02:19] ain't all in the money or the show y'all
[1:02:22] know what I'm saying there's only one
[1:02:24] person who can feel that whole feel that
[1:02:27] dog's body in your life and that's Jesus
[1:02:29] Christ alone nobody can feel that no
[1:02:35] alcohol no drugs no reefer no cocaine
[1:02:39] crack heroin whatever you still lack
[1:02:43] there's only one piece that piece that
[1:02:47] that God is is the only one can fit that
[1:02:50] spot happiness don't come in this world
[1:02:55] not the kind God gives you and everybody
[1:02:58] want to be happy right
[1:02:59] remember Amen those people up there in
[1:03:02] in Canada and here they were up there
[1:03:06] having a good time and probably God
[1:03:08] comes off the elevator here's to women
[1:03:10] halfway dress both of them embarrassed
[1:03:12] oh this is life shoulda never said that
[1:03:17] he grabbed both on now remember brother

[1:03:24] fella isn't he grab both of them no this
[1:03:28] ain't life that's death that you try to
[1:03:31] do that this day you'd be in trouble but
[1:03:34] being led by the Holy Spirit he was
[1:03:36] letting them know and they supposed to
[1:03:38] be Christians Sunday School teachers
[1:03:45] with wedding rings husband home
[1:03:50] babysitting but that was life to do he
[1:03:55] said that's not life that's dead outside
[1:03:58] of Christ there is no life and you can
[1:04:02] be in this message 30 40 years like the
[1:04:05] brother and believe it's true but if
[1:04:08] you're not born again if you don't get
[1:04:11] the dumb life on the inside if the Holy
[1:04:14] Ghost don't come down into your heart
[1:04:17] you lost that can't be oh yes it is
[1:04:22] Israeli men followed and it was with
[1:04:25] there in the wilderness how many years
[1:04:27] 40 and they all died out there
[1:04:30] they never crossed over into the
[1:04:31] Promised Land they never got into Canaan
[1:04:34] and Canaan will represents the Holy
[1:04:36] Ghost oh I got the Holy Ghost in this
[1:04:39] peace and joy forever more that's when
[1:04:41] you fight you haven't even felt good
[1:04:44] until you get the Holy Ghost it's just
[1:04:49] okay
[1:04:50] David was a mighty mighty warrior God
[1:04:53] reflecting the Holy Spirit and David in
[1:04:56] the Psalms 23 says the Lord is my
[1:04:58] shepherd that we don't need we take that
[1:05:00] and we like that that point you know the
[1:05:02] Lord is my shepherd I shall not want you
[1:05:04] know know how he said he maketh me to
[1:05:06] lie down in green pastures and we don't
[1:05:08] even realize sometime what we say when
[1:05:10] the Lord is your Shepherd this is deep
[1:05:13] this is really deep that means I don't
[1:05:17] leave myself I follow I am a sheep right
[1:05:22] cuz Shepherds herd sheep and I am a
[1:05:25] follower of the Lord that right he
[1:05:27] maketh me he doesn't even ask me he
[1:05:32] maketh me to lie down in green pastures
[1:05:34] he leadeth me beside the still waters is
[1:05:37] that right you want to be deep that's
[1:05:40] how deep God take you right there by the
[1:05:42] steel waters because the steel waters
[1:05:44] run deep hallelujah
[1:05:47] he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in
[1:05:49] the paths of righteousness for his
[1:05:51] name's sake he's not taking me to the
[1:05:53] club or to the jute dog or some wicked
[1:05:56] place he's leaving me in the right path
[1:05:59] of righteousness any kind of leadership
[1:06:01] does not
[1:06:02] righteousness is of the devil doesn't
[1:06:05] matter who well yes I walk through the
[1:06:12] valley in the shadow of death I will
[1:06:14] fear no evil ain't no use and you fear
[1:06:18] and evil in this world this is the
[1:06:21] shadow of death
[1:06:22] hallelujah ain't no use of fear and evil
[1:06:25] for what you more than a conquerer
[1:06:27] that's what Paul said I believe it ha
[1:06:31] because I got the Conqueror inside he
[1:06:35] will keep me humble when I need to be
[1:06:37] humble he'll keep me meek when I need to
[1:06:39] be meeting ah
[1:06:43] Amen anyhow so you're not look around
[1:06:47] with your old lord you see a lot of time
[1:06:51] when we get messed up is because we try
[1:06:53] to lead the Shepherd but she can lead
[1:06:56] the Shepherd you know what she follows
[1:06:58] sheep and that's what people don't
[1:07:00] understand what I didn't influence that
[1:07:02] person to do that I didn't yes you did
[1:07:05] when you came here dressed like that
[1:07:06] some sheep saw you and they said well if
[1:07:09] they can dress like that so can i oh if
[1:07:11] they see you in the street somewhere and
[1:07:13] you're doing something got no hey
[1:07:15] she follows sheep in one sheep jump off
[1:07:18] a cliff if the Shepherd ain't there all
[1:07:20] them will jump one out the other commits
[1:07:24] suicide and that's what a lot of
[1:07:28] Christians do they commit suicide by
[1:07:31] following somebody else outside of the
[1:07:33] shepherd mmm
[1:07:37] I'll prepare the table before me in the
[1:07:39] presence of my enemies now I'm known as
[1:07:41] my hair with oil my cup runneth over
[1:07:43] surely oh it's true how way I'm going
[1:07:46] overseas and you know and we go on
[1:07:48] swimming
[1:07:49] amen and we try to find a nice place to
[1:07:51] go swimming and they look at me be
[1:07:53] called believe us they look at me
[1:07:56] because I got on the full armor I don't
[1:08:01] care what I ain't putting on your socks
[1:08:03] long washed heart ain't doing it ain't
[1:08:07] gone without a shirt forget it I don't
[1:08:12] care
[1:08:15] people think I am a sheep hello
[1:08:24] really because you know what keeps me
[1:08:26] it's not following other people in the
[1:08:28] message what keeps me is following the
[1:08:31] Shepherd My Lord Jesus Christ somebody
[1:08:38] helped me see you and I must understand
[1:08:40] David when he was writing this thing
[1:08:42] about the Lord is my shepherd
[1:08:44] he understood because he was a shepherd
[1:08:46] is that right first semi or 17 34
[1:08:50] through 7 and he said David said in the
[1:08:52] saw thy servant kept his father's sheep
[1:08:54] and there came a lion and a bear and I
[1:08:58] took a lamb out of the flood and took a
[1:09:01] lamb out of the flock and I went after
[1:09:03] him and smoked him and delivered him out
[1:09:06] of the his mouth and when he rose a rose
[1:09:10] against me I called him by the beard and
[1:09:12] smoked him and slew him here was a
[1:09:18] shepherd following a shepherd but the
[1:09:25] Shepherd was allowed I need some tissue
[1:09:34] so you look at these things they were
[1:09:36] proud approach what are you saying
[1:09:41] though he be a lamb he's also a lion so
[1:09:47] there is no fear
[1:09:49] hello of the adversary it's ok there is
[1:09:54] no fear the nature of God's nature when
[1:09:57] he's time for you to be a lamb you are

[1:11:14] have faith in God the word will protect
[1:11:17] you it is your defense the greatest
[1:11:22] offense God could give you was his word
[1:11:24] hallelujah when that devil took gzip up
[1:11:28] on the mountain and up on the pinnacle

[1:11:53] with authority God will make it come to

[1:15:30] doing with the church and with the bride
[1:15:33] if I could put it this way she's become
[1:15:35] powerless because of the lack of faith
[1:15:38] hallelujah
[1:15:39] I so thank God that the church the bride
[1:15:41] of Jesus Christ is not a group the bride
[1:15:45] of Jesus Christ are individuals

[1:15:51] at individuals power houses those who's
[1:15:56] got the Holy Ghost and know the goddess

[1:16:18] that the whole Testament and the new
[1:16:20] battling taking the devil's head off us

[1:16:27] Christians and don't know Matthew 28:19
[1:16:31] or less acts 2:38 about John 3:16 you

[1:16:41] they love God they say they want to go
[1:16:43] to heaven they say they want and don't
[1:16:45] give God that much time of their day

[1:21:23] will do it and that dub was a sign ooh
[1:21:29] Oh help us Lord that wasn't the end of
[1:21:34] it he said it was right up in the
[1:21:36] mountain there and the Holy Spirit told
[1:21:38] him y'all know what I'm talking about
[1:21:40] you know the story when he had the
[1:21:41] little squirrels in his stomach
[1:21:42] you know that was giving him that eating

[1:22:01] seventh meaning was complete and that
[1:22:03] seventh little little squirrel with the
[1:22:05] little beady eyes jumped at him right
[1:22:07] now watch this here's a prophet who
[1:22:10] prayed for everybody and yet he was sick
[1:22:12] himself is that anything different from
[1:22:15] what Paul said Paul said I pray for
[1:22:17] people and I had a thorn in my flesh and
[1:22:19] I consider the Lord three times hmm and
[1:22:24] that little squirrel tried to jump at
[1:22:26] him in his mouth again and it missed him
[1:22:28] and jumped into the cactus bush

[1:23:57] nature can't get there without the
[1:24:03] nature that's why the Bible said who
[1:24:05] shall believe I reported to whom the arm
[1:24:07] of the Lord shall be revealed it must be
[1:24:10] a revelation to you hallelujah
[1:24:13] it was a tender plant it wasn't

[1:24:19] thing now they're on the youtube about
[1:24:20] this lady I forgot Yvette is her name of
[1:24:22] Evelyn or something trying to explain
[1:24:24] the ministry of William Branham talked
[1:24:26] to a great congregation supposedly and
[1:24:28] and and talking about how he prophesied
[1:24:31] about our ministry that's going to come
[1:24:35] and how God is going to anoint that
[1:24:40] portion of people who believe this
[1:24:41] ministry those who were rejected those
[1:24:47] who were not accepted just prior to the
[1:24:49] rapture God is going to pour out the
[1:24:52] spirit and he said y'all know that's too
[1:24:53] true brother bands are there three of us

[1:25:21] aliens would be growing back I do this
[1:25:25] is because you're the seed of it
[1:25:27] you're the harvest of his preaching just
[1:25:30] like all robbers and Billy Graham they
[1:25:32] have a harvest and he said listen even
[1:25:35] the Prophet God said with that anointing
[1:25:37] fall and then he says listen which it
[1:25:40] will God will have a final outpouring
[1:25:43] and that outpouring he said during that
[1:25:45] the Gentile door will be shot there him
[1:25:50] that is pure righteous holy filthy
[1:25:52] whatever you are boom there you are
[1:25:58] people ain't looking for nothing but I'm
[1:26:00] looking for something those Rockets
[1:26:04] didn't stop they kept going up boom boom
[1:26:08] that's what I said that was the
[1:26:10] unveiling of the word and this message
[1:26:13] is rapturing faith Wow it ain't cutting
[1:26:17] you down it's trying to bill you up it's
[1:26:23] trying to bring you to a place where
[1:26:24] you'll know who you are and stop looking
[1:26:26] at your flesh no flesh it's car seat
[1:26:29] oh I'm gonna have to jump but even even
[1:26:35] in Salomon it was like it was like the
[1:26:39] love of two doves he goes on and says

[1:27:06] my mate mate he is my lover of my soul
[1:27:13] and whatever he says is that right one
[1:27:20] thing about a dog a dog likes to come
[1:27:22] back home that's why they could use them
[1:27:23] those pigeons would find their way cuz
[1:27:27] Peter is the type of dog find their way
[1:27:29] home to take a message go to God you
[1:27:34] didn't get it but that's alright a man
[1:27:37] he finds his way you see them attain
[1:27:40] something you might have a backslider
[1:27:41] somewhere they might be taken out
[1:27:43] somewhere but if there really are dogs
[1:27:46] if they are elected they will find their
[1:27:50] way home hallelujah no matter how much
[1:27:56] they shot at y'all just Oh

[1:28:21] follow him because he fathered Christ
[1:28:24] the message wasn't message william
[1:28:27] branham the message was Christ
[1:28:29] I thank God for His faithfulness and I
[1:28:34] can't hardly wait to see it a real
[1:28:38] born-again Christian is different from
[1:28:41] I'm almost done
[1:28:42] it's 839 on my how what time is it
[1:28:46] on yours just give me a few more minutes
[1:28:49] but the dog can eat wheat listen now
[1:28:53] I've always talked about the dog being
[1:28:55] the symbol of God and the crow being the
[1:28:59] symbol of the hypocrite a crow can set
[1:29:02] out on an old dead carcass and eat all
[1:29:05] day long and fly right out in the field
[1:29:09] and eat wheat with the duh and that's
[1:29:13] just what we do mmm we message people we
[1:29:17] go over here and all I'm going over
[1:29:19] there ain't nothin I'm you know a then
[1:29:21] you just eatin off that denominational
[1:29:23] stuff then you come running back over
[1:29:24] here something wrong with your
[1:29:25] experience you cannot eat off to the dog
[1:29:29] that slop that slop okay how good it is
[1:29:32] slop good to a pig cuz this nature
[1:29:35] haven't been changed but when you eat up
[1:29:38] this word if you're really born again
[1:29:40] let me tell you if you really got the
[1:29:42] Holy Ghost you cannot stand it I can't
[1:29:46] cut my radio on and listen to that stuff
[1:29:48] oh god that just slop you said brother
[1:29:55] but be careful no I don't have to be
[1:29:56] because it's the same word and that day
[1:29:59] it was powerful hallelujah when God gave
[1:30:02] them the manner he said whatever you do
[1:30:05] don't keep it over and what happened
[1:30:07] they tried to keep that manner over and
[1:30:09] became maggot filled maggots
[1:30:11] and that's what happens to it that same
[1:30:13] manner that used to work in that day
[1:30:15] it's just maggot feel right now ain't
[1:30:18] bringing no life cuz death done set in a
[1:30:23] coca set out on the old dead caucus and
[1:30:26] eat all day long the fry right out in
[1:30:29] the field and eat wheat with the dog but
[1:30:32] the dog can't eat wheat all night the
[1:30:34] dog but the dub can eat wheat all right
[1:30:38] but it can't eat the dead carcass he
[1:30:42] just can't do it he can't stomach it and
[1:30:45] I wonder why we couldn't do it they're
[1:30:48] both files fouls but birds but why it's
[1:30:53] the structure of them that's the way it
[1:30:55] end with a genuine Christian just a
[1:30:58] nominal national Christian can just take
[1:31:00] anything but a genuine born-again
[1:31:03] Christian cannot take the things other
[1:31:05] where he's constructed differently
[1:31:09] hallelujah I found out and that's what
[1:31:12] it is the dub don't have God we can't

[1:31:28] a woman that lives in prison she's dead
[1:31:30] already
[1:31:35] I'm almost done partakers of his divine
[1:31:39] nature that's the door right there let
[1:31:43] me tell you something divine love

[1:31:52] this here you got the yield and yield
[1:31:55] and yield right when the seed is dying
[1:31:58] it shrinks it blows up then BOOM right
[1:32:03] knowledge and temperance and patient in
[1:32:05] God in the old yes a godliness brotherly
[1:32:09] kindness y'all know what I'm saying all
[1:32:12] that gotta be and you can't get damn
[1:32:14] being a wolf when I ain't gonna let them
[1:32:19] talk to me like that
[1:32:20] you better if you following it up you
[1:32:25] get a
[1:32:25] of nature or goat nature on you he's
[1:32:27] moving you be left right there by
[1:32:29] yourself oh yes ma'am yes sir
[1:32:34] and then you be wondering why I feel
[1:32:36] like I feel you just ran the dove off
[1:32:40] have you ever had a job on your porch
[1:32:43] soon as you get there he just catch a
[1:32:45] glimpse right so you gotta understand
[1:32:52] they're very sensitive and very
[1:32:53] sensitive to you now y'all understand me
[1:32:57] the Bob said make your calling and
[1:32:59] election sure is that right grace so you
[1:33:05] got to understand you've got to have
[1:33:07] that and this is people are you insane
[1:33:10] what do you believe brother would I
[1:33:11] believe like brother branham talk when I
[1:33:14] first got born again now understand my
[1:33:19] conception started with faith but that
[1:33:24] was my conception it was not my birth
[1:33:27] and that faith was given to me now who
[1:33:32] love cuz faith in love or twins even
[1:33:37] though you don't see faith down there
[1:33:39] love had to be there God so loved the
[1:33:42] world that He gave His only begotten Son
[1:33:45] that's the gospel when you can see that
[1:33:48] God loves you
[1:33:50] faith is then applied or given to you by
[1:33:53] who God alone not your faith his faith
[1:33:57] because the Bible said the just shall
[1:33:59] live by his faith but if you don't take
[1:34:03] people to Calvary which a lot of people
[1:34:05] in the message never ever say come to
[1:34:07] the altar or stand in your seat and ask
[1:34:10] the Lord Jesus Christ into your heart
[1:34:12] people don't believe oh I believe the
[1:34:14] message and you never went to Calvary
[1:34:15] you never get there you got to go by the
[1:34:20] way of the blood that's the Old
[1:34:22] Testament hallelujah
[1:34:25] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[1:34:27] you believe then what was you preach
[1:34:29] what preached what was preached to you
[1:34:31] hallelujah
[1:34:32] you gotta go by the depth Berrien
[1:34:34] resurrection in order to rise
[1:34:39] ain't never confess the Lord Jesus so
[1:34:43] many um and that's why they in the
[1:34:45] conditioning in the devil don't care if
[1:34:49] you can believe in quote brother branham
[1:34:51] verbatim if you ain't got no light you
[1:34:53] still got pride and arrogance and all
[1:34:55] that stuff mix up in there amen yeah you
[1:34:58] need to be wrong again I'm cutting in I
[1:35:03] must stop here but let me tell you
[1:35:06] something listen when it comes to God
[1:35:12] what was the book what was the bride
[1:35:16] book I'm gonna go back to that it was
[1:35:20] the lamb book of life lambs so in that
[1:35:25] book was all lambs and in that book was
[1:35:29] given life to all lambs no goats was in
[1:35:32] that book that's another page that's
[1:35:34] another story that's another book that's
[1:35:36] the book of life when you got the goats
[1:35:38] and the Lambs hallelujah but in the
[1:35:41] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:35:43] only those who come up to the place of
[1:35:45] being a lamb will make a rapture I
[1:35:47] didn't say he wasn't saved but I said
[1:35:51] that's the only one that's gonna make a
[1:35:52] rapture that God will come up here and
[1:35:54] listen he said that's the victory in the
[1:35:58] love divine hmm but what let's say it
[1:36:02] like this because that was said in
[1:36:04] French where they put the adjectives or
[1:36:06] the hat birds before the verb look so
[1:36:09] let's say like this this is the victory
[1:36:10] in divine love you know how they do it
[1:36:17] English wise you know like
[1:36:24] children said I ate the fish I ate the
[1:36:27] food all the grandkids say I ate the
[1:36:30] food all and we said we hate all the
[1:36:34] food we ate the food we ate the food all
[1:36:37] I like it when they say it but but we
[1:36:41] say all of the food so you look at this
[1:36:45] thing you soar what do you mean it's
[1:36:47] divine love that gives you the victory
[1:36:51] His divine love divine love been proven
[1:36:54] over and over again the bull the bees
[1:36:58] you know time brother bear took off his
[1:37:02] shoes to see whether his brother could
[1:37:04] fit him hmm took off his coat to see
[1:37:09] whether the coat fit what was it he
[1:37:13] didn't care well I bought this man its
[1:37:14] name-brand I don't care it wasn't
[1:37:19] hunting like that he was sold under the
[1:37:22] inspiration of the Holy Spirit he never
[1:37:24] thought about himself and as long as you
[1:37:27] just think about yourself you ain't got
[1:37:30] a jack cuz love thinks about others
[1:37:36] that's that's your Bible it's not puffed
[1:37:40] up it seeketh not her own it's always
[1:37:43] thinking about somebody else's that's
[1:37:46] Stan you know we see how
[1:38:00] God deals with us even though
[1:38:13] chastisement is not pleasant at the time
[1:38:18] but if we take blessed iseman tasks as
[1:38:22] sons and daughters it will yield Jesus
[1:38:26] Christ in our lives I want to be chasing
[1:38:33] now some people say well if I don't make
[1:38:39] it as the vod's version i'ma make it as
[1:38:41] food version don't you know foolish
[1:38:42] versions are cast into outer darkness
[1:38:45] whatever that is it ain't heaven it
[1:38:51] sounds like the same place that the lost
[1:38:53] ghosts the foolish virgins goals as well
[1:38:56] you said what do you mean well let me
[1:38:59] say like this the Bible said that the
[1:39:00] white throne judgment that's where Jesus
[1:39:03] separates the goats and the sheep on the
[1:39:06] seat from the goal so wherever they were
[1:39:08] they were mixed they mingled together
[1:39:11] right there's a lot of people who in
[1:39:14] jail who are innocent but they in there
[1:39:18] and my point is there is no way I would
[1:39:23] even allow that to be considered in my
[1:39:26] mind or in my soul I don't want or have
[1:39:31] a desire to miss the rapture I have no
[1:39:35] desire to be considered foolish virgins
[1:39:37] all I know is that I have a whole high
[1:39:41] calling in Christ I'm pressing toward
[1:39:44] that mark no matter what Oh brothers do
[1:39:48] you make mistakes I have made tons but
[1:39:51] thank God for the blood of Jesus I don't
[1:39:54] have a quit in me I do not have quitting
[1:39:59] in me and he gave me that I was
[1:40:06] thinking about that earlier coming
[1:40:08] football players if you're gonna make a
[1:40:09] good football player you must learn how
[1:40:12] to take the pain in any sport if you're
[1:40:19] gonna be good at it you got to learn how
[1:40:21] to take the pain cuz you're gonna get
[1:40:25] some but if you push through the pain it
[1:40:30] makes you a better sportsman and if you
[1:40:34] push through Christianity the pain that
[1:40:36] brings Christian that comes with
[1:40:38] Christianity it makes you a better
[1:40:39] Christian it puts some muscles of faith
[1:40:42] on your hallelujah
[1:40:44] it does something on the inside I can't
[1:40:47] even explain what I'm trying to say but
[1:40:52] God don't use cowards soldiers and he
[1:40:57] says in that day if you ashamed of me he
[1:40:59] said I'll be ashamed of you
[1:41:00] I don't want God to be ashamed of me
[1:41:05] this ain't no a system like the brother
[1:41:09] said you know you being it up the mark
[1:41:11] of the beast just trusting oh I believe
[1:41:13] the message that's what they that's what
[1:41:15] happened a lot of them in in Moses day
[1:41:17] but they wouldn't move right in to what
[1:41:19] Moses creech t' only two of them Joshua
[1:41:22] and Caleb
[1:41:23] how come Joshua and Caleb got a new
[1:41:26] spirit a different spirit from the
[1:41:28] restaurant because they were obedient
[1:41:33] and my point is this a menu and I must
[1:41:36] come to a place it meant that we must
[1:41:38] settle within ourselves you're gonna
[1:41:40] either be saved and make a rapture or
[1:41:42] you just gonna sit back and be lost or
[1:41:44] I'm just going well I don't know exactly
[1:41:46] what I'm gonna be I don't I don't know
[1:41:47] what his choosing is I'm gonna tell you
[1:41:49] something if there is such a thing I'm
[1:41:52] sure gonna make it hard for him to turn
[1:41:54] me down fine you just lay back and well
[1:42:01] I'll just die wet case around whatever
[1:42:03] will be no no no no it hit me I don't
[1:42:09] push through too many things family jobs
[1:42:12] you name it friends I've come through
[1:42:16] too much
[1:42:18] take my head off whatever you need to do
[1:42:21] you know y'all see all y'all don't know
[1:42:24] what I'm going through in this message
[1:42:25] all these people and he preaches and
[1:42:27] everything else and you know how I
[1:42:28] always said to myself I Know Who I am
[1:42:31] I Know Who I am thought you know I Know
[1:42:35] Who I am you got to know who you are
[1:42:39] I don't care who's what Susie and John
[1:42:43] and all the rest of them doing out there
[1:42:46] God has never left himself without a
[1:42:49] witness and if I've got to be the only
[1:42:51] one which I know I'm not but I believe
[1:42:54] this church folks y'all got something
[1:42:57] good going on and you don't even know it
[1:42:59] but God has visited this church many a
[1:43:01] times we should never be in a
[1:43:05] backslidden condition that we're in ever
[1:43:08] with all of the word that's come cost
[1:43:11] this pulpit then we run amen from one
[1:43:15] building to the next building to the
[1:43:16] next but why you follow it then you know
[1:43:19] because there's something on the inside
[1:43:21] of you that makes you know it's right
[1:43:23] but instead of just taking the time and
[1:43:25] says God have mercy on me see you can't
[1:43:29] lie to God you can't fake it till you
[1:43:30] make it not in this one you've got to be
[1:43:33] real with God and all you got to do is
[1:43:36] ask in sincerity and don't try to old
[1:43:39] Lord hold something behind your back you
[1:43:42] got to give it all your greatest
[1:43:45] victories this right here Lord are you
[1:43:50] Lord out even I don't even know how to
[1:43:53] you but you can show Oh help me Lord
[1:43:55] Lord I yield I surrender aw and when you
[1:44:02] come to a place and you surrender all
[1:44:04] all of a sudden you see things in your
[1:44:06] mind that you need to give up and you
[1:44:09] got to say I give that up long I give
[1:44:12] that up Lord help me give that up y'all
[1:44:15] hear what I'm saying that's how you go
[1:44:17] with God when you see things in your
[1:44:19] life you can't give up that's when you
[1:44:21] say lord help me take it out from me
[1:44:23] it's your will for it to be going Lord
[1:44:26] I'm submitting to your will not my will
[1:44:29] but thine be done
[1:44:31] that's when God comes on the scene but
[1:44:36] you know all you can get it before him
[1:44:38] and like I said holler and scream all
[1:44:39] you won't - he ain't moving - you
