me alive for Jesus keeping me alive well at least we know we know it's not ourselves for sure our just a short message tonight you return with me to Psalms 34 Psalms 59 I had to see a brother martial brother Stanford told me he wasn't coming is I thought well I won't see brother Marsha tonight glad to see you my brother always glad to see you amen God is so good to us I'm so proud of the Kamala's family and I appreciate y'all when y'all come it blesses me it really blesses me we're living in the last days and when I see that pool on you it makes me happy that you desire to come this is this is a great thing and that's the way I see it Psalms 34 we're gonna read the eighth verse o taste and see that the Lord is good blessed is the man that trusted in him and that wonderful let us go to I'm sorry let's read on I'm sorry Oh fear the Lord ye is saints but there is no want to them that fear him the Young Lions do lack and suffer hunger but they that see the Lord shall not want for any good thing understand that they that seek the Lord shall not want for any good thing Psalms 59 it is a battle it is times are hard but you know what God never for circles he never will forsake us whether you feel him or not he sees everything the Bible says that he even knows the hairs that's on your head I appreciate the Lord Jesus amen in the midst of my trial and in the midst of my test I can still praise the Lord Psalms 59 16 through 17 but I was seeing of the power of that power yeah I was sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning but thou has been my defense and refuge in the day of my trouble unto thee O my strength will I sing for God is my Rhett my defence and the God of my mercy that was pretty father God we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us you have been better to us and we are into ourselves and Lord there are no words to express our gratitude we thank you for the victory or God in my brother's sean's it was life the Lord we thank you for how you had him sitting up eating and breathing and different exercises they gave him Lord and what a good report father just we pray we know that you've answered our prayer and father we do see the sweet victories we pray tonight that you continue to strengthen his family and bless Lord God our brother Conley sister Lord strengthen her body and lord I pray that you would quicken something in her soul that she would desire salvation how mercy upon us Lord we are a needy people and father we pray that your mercy and grace be upon us in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I really feel that often time we don't get the victory that we would get from the Lord because of our attitude God cannot operate and worry he only operates by faith and the Bible says without faith it's impossible to please God as I was stuttering studying today I ran across the scripture also in Psalm 71 and 7 it says I am as a wonder unto many but thou art my strong refuge Allah I like that people may understand not understand my my disposition and and they may wonder how I can go on and I'm not perfect in that way I'm just saying many don't understand the smiles and the joy that I have especially unsaved people but they fail to see that they there is a refuge it's not that the storms are not raging is that I have found that hiding place and that is trusting God it says let my mouth be filled with I praise and with I honor all the day as I was thinking about the time and error that we're living in this is the finale this is it there's not coming something greater than that fact we are in the place of God's judgement when time will be no more we're at the end of it and to know that God has given us grace to even consider our plans ever coming to pass it's okay we supposed to work we supposed to continue but in the midst of all that we plan to do we must realize that this may not happen Christ may come before it's all over and we with that attitude God can further our progression in whatever field of life we may be in because we are aware that everything else is temporal there are two forces at work and these forces are have been battling from before time we call it good we call it evil you and I must understand that there are two kingdoms there's a Satan's Kingdom and there's God's kingdom and these two kingdoms have thought before time but you know you and I must understand that these there's one of the one of these kingdoms cannot continue one kingdom is eternal and the other one a man has been everlasting but it comes to an end it has range Satan has has deceived mankind for thousands of years he was put it this way even Eve was no match for the devil it was had you understand that now had he gone amen to Adam it would have been a masculine part of him it would have been a different story but but Eve because of her makeup was basically the weaker vessel now you said why are you saying this because amen we understand that Satan at this point in time appears to have dominion Satan has no dominion now not to the belief but to the world he dominates everything the governments are in Satan's control y'all know that right even at the time when Jesus was being tempted in the wilderness Satan offered Jesus the world if you bow down to me I will give you the whole of the kingdoms and of course Jesus Christ who is the son of God who is God who was the fullness of God amen understood that he was not here to accept some handout but the the world at large the universe everything that had fallen had to come by way of this battle and this battle had to be fought and the victory was sure to be won you understand me so we know that Jesus Christ knew that that at some point in time Satan was going to lose everything he thought he had and everything that he thought he had would be returned back to Jesus and Jesus Christ would reign forever there is a kingdom and the Bible tells us that the kingdom of God cannot be moved you have heard me say at times that because of the fall we understand the fall the battle started in heaven and we understand by God's grace that the battle was brought from heaven down to earth and Eve and Adam open the door and I took that battle and when that battle began to rage it raised in the mind of men the greatest battle ever fought is in the mind of the man why because he has to make a choice between two he must choose faith or reasoning and this is why you can see why Satan's science has become God because this is Satan's Eden he actually introduced science to Eve because you must understand that the the reproduction of mankind was not supposed to come by way of sex it was to come by the spoken word of God which would have been by faith God would have told Adam and Eve what he wanted and they would have produced what they wanted what he wanted you understand me but he taught Adam and Eve science by way of sex if you do this you plant the seed here and you'll bring forth the crop right so I'm saying all of that to say that since that fall science science watch it from Genesis all the way up to now when the serpent seed began to multiply they'd get deep they built buildings they had the music they had all of these great things and Here Come Nimrod and then he what did he he was a reflection I was Satan was trying to do build his kingdom on the earth right and then what God did he comes down and he confuses them rod and then he also what separates the whole entire world for the purpose of his gospel you understand me because as long as they were united man could do anything that he imagined to do that's the word his imagination became a reality he was just that smart he was just fallen he meant from amen a perfect state so he had a good mind he had good imagination and Satan was gonna make sure and then this this thing that's Lucifer amen was trying to develop and and and and bring about what happened so I'm coming to this in just a minute so you must understand from that point on Satan had the keys of death hell and the grave and he conquered by that people fear death right they filled here filled his fear feared hell and and so he ruled I fear and you can see that that's what he did look at Nimrod Nimrod was a forcing system it was a system Amen that went out to conquer right it's the same thing in the church ages the white horse came out it looked like an angel it looked like God it looked like Christ and the whole time it was the Antichrist going about to conquer what was it what was it over here the conquering in the conquest was in the natural but now Satan over on the other side began to conquer in the spirit the understanding and he was bringing this thing to a place where he would be crowned king Oh somebody help me here see and what well you and I must understand Amen that God allows Satan do a lot of things only for his own glory he said why why didn't you know the brother Adam he brings it out he said before God could be a healer there had to be somebody sick before God can be a deliverer there had to be somebody that needed deliverance so we realized Amen all of these things that Lucifer would do by way of men is that right he is the god of this world he is the one a man that that chooses his leadership's his leaders gotta raise him up but Lucifer chooses them and you must understand a man that that his whole plan is to do what he said in his equal I believe he said you know I would have sin and I say I will my throne above the stars of God as Isaiah but nevertheless brother Brown said he did just what he said he was going to do he conquered man and now we are living in an age where Satan is being worship hello how do you know you worshipping the devil when you off his word I'm saying again Satan how do you know when you're worshiping the devil is when you off the word as long as Eve stayed with the word she was worshiping God but the moment she added aloud the devil to take away it was no longer a worship of God it was a worship of the devil came by reasoning is this right now I will say this by God's grace amen coming from the adoption for where the RAM said now this may just choke you to death but did you know that men that our sons of God are a mature God's how many ever know that how many know that Jesus says so the Bible said did you did not your laws say itself that ye are gods and if you call them gods which God said in Genesis 2 that they were gods because they were had full dominion over the Dominion of the world he give him dominion over all things and he lost his God ship he lost his sonship he lost his domain and Satan took over but brother we are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God who will come back and take it over again waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets up to the top when the full sons of God will be manifested and when God when the power of God will walk out hallelujah and will take every power that Satan's got away from him yes sir it belongs to him and understand that his domain only it's powerful in this dimension since Calvary there's a time before Calvary he kept us in captivity but the Bible said that when Jesus a man rose from the dead he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto me hallelujah he freed all of those who his blood had purchased somebody help me here she because what the devil didn't understand is that no matter how much he put us in the grave he could not stop the kingdom of God he could not stop the Empire in which God was building Oh help me here because you must realize Amen that god we don't know what it was like we can't remember but before the fall there was an empire that God had oh yeah he was king of kings he was a Lord of lords hallelujah and Lucifer was his right hand man but the Bible and the Bible tells us that Lucifer wanted a greater Kingdom than Micah the Word of God says it made and what happened so if Lucifer one of the greater kingdom that means Micah had a kingdom hallelujah and we know that Mike is who Christ perhaps that's his that was his name during the time because as God unfolds himself he changes his names hallelujah that's why the foolish virgin won't be able to get in because when God changes his name they won't know what it is hello brother BAM said a knock on the door Jesus Jesus Jesus and he said they won't get nothing hmm.you they all L know him L know him L know him but that's not the name is gone by neither is there salvation under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved in that that name Amen is under heaven but what God is finished redemption that name will change now we don't know what it is yet but the bride will know whoo [Music] hallelujah now the Jews will have to know that name because that's the Redemption day but when redemption is for the bride she receives a new name hello somebody you see we must understand that no matter what we go through why are you saying it like that brother Brooks remember so you can understand there was an empire and it still is an empire there's still little great Kingdom and there still you know warfare is that right hit men went Daniel prayed God said I sent my co down there and he fought for you 21 days war was going on in the unseen when Saul Samuel died Amen in the Witch of Endor called him up called her up what was Samuel he was a prophet hello so all of that he's feeling prophet she's nothing not even death hell and the grave can stop God's Word from coming to pass hallelujah you said we're brothers what are you saying don't you understand we do not go through the white throne judgment we don't be judge you know what we have a we have a ceremony listen to the six healed we have at least 60 or 50 whichever was he said listen he said it's not a judgement when I found myself climbing up those those are ivory steps he said it was not like a judgment it was a ceremonial of for rewards that's what we go through we go before him to receive our rewards you're in heaven already he's not gonna kick you out Oh somebody help me oh my listen so you must understand no matter what you go through Christ has already delivered you somebody help me sir true if your name was written in the book before the lamb that in the blimp of the life before the world began if you were saying before then if he was sealed before then you were delivered before the end you was healed before this y'all understand me everything was done before you got here that's what makes it so real because I was perfect back there therefore I'm perfect now in the eyes of God I'm perfect no matter what it looks like no matter what the devil calls you no matter what you look like that's not the way God said you are blood wash bride justified as though you never sinned in the first place now if we can live like that we'll put the devil on the run our problem is that we always let the guilt consciousness and God says listen the Holy Ghost and supposed to take away the guilt consciousness what you feeling guilty about the Word of God said you were tricked into it you didn't mean to do it in the first place I received that now you got to receive it so when the devil comes you accuse me so that I can't get victory he is a liar you got to take the word of today and give it to him that's the key sword come on somebody the King sword is just not this even though this is the word it's a revelation of it and that came to Malachi so when you realize the revelation of the Lord that is the King sword upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it and no use in being sad you got the victory when God has challenged our chosen you for battery you might as well shout and have a good time now it's easier said than done but you can get in that channel may be said I encouraged myself in the law whoo yeah hallelujah coming from the power of anything we know as a message called the power of the devil but there's a message 1955 he said he he's called in the Bible Jehovah Jireh y'all know that name Jehovah Jireh means the Lord provide him n he said I'm so glad tonight to know that he still jehovah-jireh no matter what the circumstances is God will make a way he makes a way of escape he says say to me pin you in a corner with the cancer God will make a way of escape Satan they pin you down under a car God will make a way of escape say to me take your family away from you but God will make a way of escape God has away so it doesn't matter what it looks like how the victory look like Satan's got the vintage Satan has no victory because at Calvary he stripped him of every victory right the Bible says him he won't run a race you gotta run it lawfully Satan is sneaky he's a thief he's a murderer he doesn't ever play fair so God stripped him everything he thought he wrote what God took him back you didn't do it right how can he do it right he's a deceiver now a lot of times people think that we've got to have these great great big mountainous faith when Jesus said that if you have the faith of a mustard seed that must have seen as I as thoroughly as pure can't be hybrid it's it can't be mixed with any other kind of seed that's what he says it's one of the smallest of all the seeds that's all God needs you to have just a little bit just a little bit that cannot be changed just a little bit I like saying that just a little bit that's up that's right see God takes a little speck of faith and if you hold on to it he'll bring you out that's what he said ministry explained that's what he said if you got just the little grain of faith that's genuine mustard seed faith that won't move stay with it he'll bring you out he says that it shall be even as I was with told Moses is that fair enough that's what I say in the name of the Lord Jesus not as I claim to be anything myself I'm the least among you and I do not say that to be humble I say it from my heart that's brother been saying that but you see what made him great because he saw himself as the least and he says well I'm not saying this and then just trying to be humble but it is true and so when I read that I said that is so true if God can get a man or woman who can see themselves as the least of all he can be used by God it's those who are puffed up those who think they're great that's why God can't use you the way he wants to but he looking for somebody who's with you you know I'm nothing Lord like a preacher when the man the public in the end and then and they are sinner was out there the sinner excuse me there a Pharisee said you whatever he was he would say all God having that done this and having I've done this and having I've done this and here was another man of public of the sinner smoke his breath rest and say lord have mercy on me and Jesus said which one left out justify the man who knew he needed mercy mmm no help me in Jesus amen listen sweet victories I love this remember I'm not going to quote it all but let me let me just quote this part a marvelous thing that I've ever seen in my life it's the greatest hour of my life is when I get against a wall that I can't get over it under it or around it that's right and then I trust God and he opens the way and I go through the thing God takes you through it then when you can when you come out of the other side it's like Samson when you kill the lion y'all remember that Samson killed this lion and then later on he comes back by the lion and the lion has a honeybee hide in it hallelujah and he rolls in and gets the honey y'all know the story and he tells his wife about what took place and how she betrayed him and all that but here I thought that's it when this enemy comes in like a flood the Lord will always lift up a standard against him and he will make your greatest battle think about it here was Samson a young boy a young man you know not big in stature with huge muscles and my brother seems like a right a little small fella amen that's what made him so what made him a Wanda how does a little fella a man can lift up the gates of Gaza how he can kill a lion hallelujah with his bare hand it rips his mouth open how was it it wasn't Samson it was the anointing that drop on him and that's what brother Byrne said he's in there with that anointing come upon you you ought to be able to recognize you have the ability to defeat your enemy you've got the ability to defeat your enemies when they kill the lion and he got the sweetness honey he ever eat out of that old carcass of that lion I thought that's right every victory should end up in sweetness real sweet stuff when you know that you got that victory only because of God's anointing and God helped you out of it hallelujah how could we keep our mouth shut how could we not praise God when we see that God has given us everything we ever had when the Spirit of the Lord shows up hallelujah huh whoa watch out devil you're in for a big battle now is that right and that's what David rested upon he read he said is that right now I noticed my hair with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me not sometimes but all the days of my life and when when Goliath came back he understood just another sweet victory yeah is that right he was dis anointing I'm talking about will not allow you be afraid it won't let you get nervous it won't make it there's no fear when you are in the presence of the Lord you understand me in the presence of the Lord the Bible said there's fullness of joy hallelujah there's a strength in it hallelujah David wrote about it tell me all of the great men of God knew about the anointing of the Lord hallelujah is that right and David respected that even though saw wasn't the right kind of king he said all my god what have I done have cut the the garment of the anointing of the Lord he knew God wasn't known had I known that that man at time hallelujah and you have to be careful is that all right listen think about it what I'm talking about when I when I'm talking about for sweet victories we're in the heat of the battle you got to learn how to start praising God in the meat this of it if you can't praise him you go and pray you understand me don't let the devil enjoy sadness in your life oh I just can't harlot make it and oh this is overwhelming and oh you are glorifying the devil you're letting the devil you a son of God you don't know me shake the devil of you know he can't understand when he see he can't get next you when you see your joy lever dropping you drop to your knees and pray keep him out of your life keep that devil out of your life you're here to worship God and not him you ought to tell her that when you're not getting no praise today y'all understand me you're not getting no praising and I'ma show you you're not gonna get any mmm yes sir there Moses think about it taking the rock this is what I love about it for a long time you always saw Moses Amen and he's he speaks to the rock and there's a time he smoked the rock you know and my mind never went to this forum this place you know always saw them people like alright move over let me drink some it wasn't like it was a Gaza it was a river there were millions of people that was sad one time water at one time they drank till they couldn't drink no more that's what we need in this church we need a Gaza hallelujah a Holy Ghost gosh Amen that'll come in and put a party first in here hallelujah well when the Spirit of the Lord shows up that's what I'm talking about hey man it's not it you could sing but when the Spirit of the Lord shows up there's a difference you can preach but when the Spirit of Lord shows up hallelujah there's a different story when the spirit of Lord shows up hallelujah david says listen you didn't talk all that noise but I want you to understand that Goliath represented the devil he was the king if you want to say of the Philistines he was a big man they may have had a king but he was just a figurehead you understand me and when the devil comes you gotta go you got to go after him he said brother you don't challenge know when God anoints you you you don't you don't challenge him on your own you get before God let God anoint you that's when you start speaking because then it's no longer you it's God speaking through you we're no match for the devil but oh we got a big brother that is Moses taking that rod and judge his judgment stick going forth to the rock and then Stuart God on the rock and he smoked the rock and when he did the waters gushed forth not a little bit stream like you see the artist draw the picture I could drink y'all understand me he said I could drink that drink dry if I was thirsty but look enough water came out of it water two million people plus camels and animals that they had come forth with gushers hallelujah he's at a beautiful type of them when jesus said in the wilderness that he was a rock that was in the wilderness I never I said think about here Jesus preaching and he's preaching to the people there in Jerusalem and where he says Nicky I am that rock humanly said it I am that bread he just did you stayed in my mind just there I am that rock and that brand listen but now these people may have meditated only brother Adam said he said all of a sudden when they saw Jesus they ran a hose out of the Hosanna blessed is he that comes they knew he was that rock and they understood that rock brought forth water he meant to feed millions oh that's what I'm talking about and we had like Jesus can't hand our problems shame on us hallelujah what is your problem - what they had huh come on somebody amen rebellious people and he still gave him water rebellious people and he still fed him bread rebellious people and he still kept their clothing rebellious people and they still never had to change shoes 40 years yeah somebody help me here 40 years and if God did that for the rebels what will he do for those who will obey oh what is the rock huh that rock has been washed by the same waters or waters by the word they have to cry out says if they hold their peace the rock will immediately cry out and let me tell you something it may look like a rock don't have life but if you don't cry out gotta put life there hallelujah somebody help me here oh not later oh when they needed some water only thing they had to do was go was to speak to the rock one day they were hungry and they went and hunted and they found in the cleft Oh Lord he said don't you understand what the clefts of the rock he is he said that cleft of the rock represents the side the club in the side of Jesus hallelujah that was a real Club hard Lord in the craft of the Rock hallelujah is that alright y'all you what I'm saying I'm trying to encourage artists tonight this this is a battleground we win war and y'all if you don't know now we're at a closing time and everything is ending up time is no more everything that started in Genesis is ending up right now coming to the last anything of Education ending a Hollywood ending of everything is ending right like I said we started off amen horse and buggy from horse and buggy we ran into the car from the car we went into the airplane from the airplane we went into the astronaut age now what we're looking at hey man from from up from a born error to a a gun and from a gun to a tank and from a tank to you understand me I hadn't but now we got a hydrogen bomb and of it and you and I we didn't know how it was gonna be her brother em tells us it's gonna swing us right on into it hmm and we're right at the end this is Satan's Kingdom and say - no it's almost over and the Bible said because he knows it is almost over he's doing everything he can to send people to hell look at these Christians and the reason why so many of falling and coming shot him in his own because you're not staying with the word and because they're not praying up help us Lord you see the enemy when Jesus knew he was coming into Calvary he knew it was his hour in his day what did he do he went to pray and he said come pray with me come pray with me an hour hallelujah if you don't know how to pray ask God how to teach you to pray teach me Lord how to pray never give up on prayer I don't care if you don't feel it never give up on it hallelujah if you got to keep saying it hallelujah is that right brother Branham didn't even know how to pray but he ABCD efg and he knew God understood whatever that meant I'm saying that's all I'm saying don't you ever give up on prayer talk to him if you don't even hear from him cuz he hears you before you get there hallelujah Oh people act like God got ears he does in the man as a man but as spirit he knows all things don't be like the Pentecostals oh I gotta feel it yeah gotta feel him when I talk to people I don't feel it I'm talking well there's some angry or happy but just talking to people you don't you don't get you know you're just talking sometimes that's how it is with God God sometime tests us to see whether you really believe what you say and sometime here to stay so quiet he even take that unknown thing that you so used to and you love that feeling don't y'all love it when it comes to the prayer and you're just wonderful and sometimes he or not he won't do nothing he just let you sit right there and you almost feel stupid but don't be so stupid to think that he doesn't hear you God always hears you God hearing you is that based upon how you feel in the oh lord help me Jesus Oh Yahoo it's the trick of the devil finally brethren be strong in the Lord and the power of your mic no here's my what is his mic the Holy Ghost why did we need it the Holy Ghost is our deliverer he could have left his disciples go home without it but he couldn't cuz they could they wouldn't the early church they would not have been able to defeat the Holy Ghost the devil without the Holy Ghost and you know what that's why the devil would he start eating off the tree he started eating off brotherly kindness he started eating off those things that he knew that God could not continue on moving that Holy Ghost like he normally would because that was darkness and not light you lose brotherly kindness that's darkness hello put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil what is that the word put it all for we're astronauts not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day huh if you don't put on the whole armour you don't withstand hmm you got to talk back to the devil we're in the age of speaking you want to do something speak it that's what we are we're all come on somebody win the age of the voice that for them said when the seals were open it put us back into the Garden of Eden before the fall and how Adam high did Adam work back then it was by his voice how do Christian work by voice how do Christian fights by voice the Bible said when Jesus Christ comes a sword comes out of his mouth his voice his words is to what this is the thing that destroys and slayed the enemy now you can't be carnal all day and think you're gonna speak something you gotta be in the spirit so that God can speak it through you hallelujah stand therefore having your loins gird about with the truth having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked who cares if they don't like you the truth of the matter is when they speak good of you well of you'd about say take heed to yourself your Lighting's shining whoo he's a good Christian hallelujah you ought to be like a Micah he gets on my nerve time I look around he prophesized something like something negative no Michael wasn't he was telling the truth you understand me but Haho taking the shield of faith wherewith you just be able to be quick you know the Bible said you blessed when you when you suffer for the name of Jesus don't ever don't you know those aside but they were really happy when they got thrown in jail because of Jesus take the helmet of salvation and sword of the Spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there for until with oh you know this is what I want to church it understand this church is a powerhouse I didn't say brother Brooks is I said the church every one of us in here has the ability to change things if God is in you you don't need me it's him you need if you won't see miracles it's the God in you bring miracles signs and wonders come by way of your faith prevent say he couldn't do nothing it takes your faith even though Jesus is here you've got to believe you love the Lord I've come down to the end of my message but you know the thing that I'm trying to get us to see is that we need to hold out here lift up your head don't let the devil have you looking like they're all worried worried is not virtue and God is trying to get us to have virtue this is why this is not a mistake your life right now the way is playing it's not some mistake it's God I know it's hard to believe but God knows what's best for us you want to be just like him but he need you to prove to him that you trust him you know you think about it as a man Jesus understood Calvary he understood the pain that he was going to go through and he instilled you know what he did when he said Lordan father not my will but thine be done he gave his full life he put such a everything he had he trusted in the word he trusted the word because the worse and I will not leave your soul in hell he trusted the word and he knew that he was gonna live again because he trusted the word he knew he had to die but he trusted the word and in spite of all the pain he went through he never lost trust in the word my fact even when the word did God didn't respond to him my God my God why has thou forsaken me he still trusted him and his last words were it is finished Oh hallelujah you understand me pain and suffering is a part of this whole program he's loading as he's making us he's changing us from glory to glory don't refuse the makers hands what we need to learn how to do its praise God in the midst of our troubles that's what David said I'm gonna praise him I'm gonna saying I'm gonna sing praises I'm gonna dance I'm gonna do whatever is necessary because I want you to know I trust you and when you come to a place and you trust God he comes to the rest of you right Oh Lord don't you see what's goin down down there in Babylon God said I've been watching it all the time oh is that right wormwood says Lord send me and I'll turn the world upside down yeah no no a man differently just came in says no this is my job I'm going myself hallelujah in there is that right brother God said God got caught for the boat hallelujah jumped on it well it rolled on down down the hallelujah think about it sometimes he wants to come in personally to vindicate his life to you don't don't don't get messed up like I said if Satan has come and pin you on the car taking your family whatever he's doing I I know this this word is powerful uh-huh hello I heard a brother talk about this too the other day which is so true think about how confused Mary and Martha men would have been must have been when Jesus told them that this sickness that Lazarus had is not unto death and then he dies Hey and then he dies and then he didn't come when they wanted him to come sometimes God just don't come because you wanted to God don't have no brats he has obedient children t-those and they didn't take no they didn't have no bad attitude either married um what is that master that no matter what you've done already you steal my master my brother been dead for days in the grave but you steal my master hallelujah no matter what I go through how much does how much pain how much heartache family and everything else brain he's still my master Alleluia and because of that attitude I still wonder I don't know God hadn't revealed that to me but I want to know how did Mary and Martha roll that stone away it doesn't say but it said they rolled a stone away it takes faith I've been there I've seen how at the door and I seen how big the stone would would have been and I'ma tell you something you have had to have some muscles on you to rock left going in would have taken more than two and it took more than two people to roll it up there you understand me so whatever action God calls for you to do it's gonna always take your faith to move it it's already there for you the victory is yours but what if David would have shot you don't looked at the size of the lies like oh my goodness how in the world I'm gonna defeat this guy no he cared nothing about his size or the size of his weapon huh he went after him let me tell you something there's more of us and there are them open their eyes Lord let them see this army let them see this this Empire let them see this host of angels that that has been ordained to fight for the bride of Jesus Christ may we see a man we're never alone we never will be alone hallelujah it doesn't matter listen to me tell y'all the way system is going most of us go be kicked out of our houses and everything else will he still be your master when they if if I know the six heel is not something we will experience but we come right up to this thing and we don't know how much but brother branham calls it a squeeze right but the great great stuff that's carrying on with with the world whippin it whippin the demons and devils and breaking them and splitting them apart now we're not a part of that but my point is how far do we go up but the man who said even some of us might even be martyrs I heard that the other day I'm like what well the truth of the matter is there are those overseas that are that believe this message that have had to die for it but my question might look I look at this thing and I said oh my god what on earth are we thinking personally I don't want to be a martyr I want to live it and if I have to be glory be to God you understand me I'm still in the bride I'm still gonna praise him I'll come on somebody you saw all problems I mean I ain't got enough money to pay my bill and all the colors so why you ain't the only one the devil didn't isolate your problem I've been there I've had to live for a week a week you know people think I'm rich today I ain't rich not like that I do have a million dollar check but it's written in Jesus name Amen and only to make a heaven could cash it so one day I'm cashing it in but y'all must understand Amen these trials that we're going through don't they God picking on you you ask God you said Lord I want to be just like you and that's what it takes because all of us we messed up this world has messed us up we born in sin we got so much darkness and things around us we don't even know it's there until the Holy Ghost bring trials and then we see things that comes out haha like I don't even know you with it am I the only one I had a chest and i'ma tell you i'ma close I had a test years ago I can tell you what it was I don't even have a gun but I was thinking about by Yellow Sea this is reality reality things will come to your mind you know it right and I thought well oh man if I do something like that it's gonna really hit the fan and the whole world gonna know maybe I need to find me a hit man [Laughter] you know desperation I'll make you think in crazy ways carlopa right Oh y'all don't have no idea you have no idea I was telling somebody the other day I said one time because of one of my daughter's I went to a Walmart and the guy worked there and I got all up in his face and brother Keith I'm sorry I wasn't acting like a saint I wasn't no profanity but I was doing everything I could do to make him hit me because I knew if he hit me I had a right to hit y'all don't they see that the old man see that's a hole you see what I'm saying you said what brother boots that's not right with brother Brown and God told brother branham's if you don't move west you gonna beat this man up and brother Brown had the Holy Ghost but he told him if you don't move west this is what you're gonna do you gonna be hitting this man kicking him down the heel knocking him back down again you gonna beat him like you're in the boxing arena yeah and he had only go so don't say I didn't have it I was being tested oh but this is the thing after I've gotten in this man face and then I screamed I was all in his face trying to get him to hit me and he wouldn't and I left I left Walmart frustrated guess what God says you know you got to go back and apologize you know you was wrong yes Lord like the world's row you got to go apologize oh yes Lord I got and I did I went back and I apologized I said listen I'm not only just a Christian but I'm a minister of Pastor I had no business acting like this now you talk about humility shame fella was a little nice he said okay that's all right I understand whether he did or not the Holy Ghost ain't gonna let you get away with that kind of stuff and not make it right you understand me but that's not the kind of warfare I want we don't need that we need God to fight for us the scripture saith the Lord I didn't quote that but it's there I had in my nose the Lord is our battle ax the Lord will fight that's what he told told David he said the Lord will fight for you he told Moses that the Lord will fight for you People of God if you pray the Lord will fight for you I don't care you don't have to be there the Lord will fight for you is that right brother man say Satan come to possess and the Holy Ghost comes to kick him out that's right only goes come let's there the Holy Ghost comes to kick him out what a
