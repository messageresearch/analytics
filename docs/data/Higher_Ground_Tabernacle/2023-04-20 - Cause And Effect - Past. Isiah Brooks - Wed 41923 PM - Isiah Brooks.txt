night that only a few people show up so it's okay you know because I know there are those who do watch Us online maybe not so many but we we understand the influence of the hour yes um Bobby said scarcely will a righteous man be saved and where were the ungodly and The Sinner appear we know we're living in a time where only a few will make a rapture and uh you know I thank God for those who who comes amen by the grace of God to church is very important it really shows what's really in you and I really appreciate you and I'm sure the Lord is the one who moving you to come amen because this is no fancy place you don't have this great preacher you know I mean it's just simple everything is and uh we just thank God for the word that God gives us and we're grateful Genesis the third chapter Genesis the third chapter will read the first through the fifth verse of that that chapter he loved the Lord amen amen you should always bring your Bible to church it's very important so um when we read something you'll you know where it's coming from and you won't forget it Genesis the third chapter beginning at the first verse it says now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yea hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the trees which is in the midst of the garden God hath said ye shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest ye die and the servant said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for God doth know that in the day that you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and Evil let us pray father God we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us Lord you have been better to us than we've been to ourselves we constantly say that because it's so true when we think about how you bring us throughout the day and how your mercy is forever with us and your grace Lord how your blood covers Us and how you shelter us from all hurt harm and danger Lord there is no way to describe our gratitude forgive the human element of us Lord that we can sometimes fail to praise you and sometimes fail to thank you and sometimes fail to be aware of who you are what you are and and your being Among Us and around us and in US Lord we we ask that you keep us guide us and strengthen us make us more aware of you Lord every day may we see you may we see your glory may we see your life in US Lord in your name Jesus Christ we pray that you bless the word the reading of the word and bless the hearers as well in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated you know we've been dealing we took a little kind of like a slash a little break in the word and to to to bring uh the last a week message on the influence of the word knowing the power of the word uh you know Paul talks about it that God is Not only in us he's uh above us with us and you know he goes on to tell us that we are even The Offspring of God um I'm I'm dealing with something uh today because uh tonight I want to make us fully aware of the actions that we we take throughout throughout the day um one of the things that we must learn how to do if we're not doing it and that is pray without ceasing um because when we pray without ceasing that one scripture that comes into play or into mind is to um acknowledge the Lord in all your ways and he shall direct your path I'm dealing with a subject tonight calls and effect cause and effects because there's always a Cause that's why I read Genesis you know we we understand what Adam and Eve did and now we're suffering because of what they did uh God told them not to eat of the tree and they did do it and now we are experiencing what we call death literally we were born into this world by the tree of death and we came out dying not living even though we came out as a baby and we looked all cute and most of us did perhaps I don't know but you know we thought oh what a precious angel but wrapped up into that human flesh wasn't so much of an Angel it was the nature of the Fallen man and that nature lies that nature steals that nature is conniving it's it's just everything that the flesh is that little bundle of joy that you call an angel is that nature is within that child because Adam and Eve fail God they transgressed God now the definition of cause and effect is the relationship between two things when one thing makes something else happens and to give you an example which is something that we clearly can see if we eat too much food and do not exercise we gain weight now that's just one sentence or one thing that I think most of us understand uh but see but the calls uh uh uh uh of this uh for example the calls in itself is is the uh eating too much food and not exercising but the effect of that is the gain the weight gain so it's a real simple thing when something uh in relationship to one another something happens there's always a cause and effect I mean even in science we know that to be true uh we may know it as Newton Law emotion for every action there's an opposite but yet an equal reaction and um in that law of motion it relates to objects uh motions to the forces acting on it for an example if when you clap your hands that's two forces coming together and it produces something it re it has a reaction even though we don't see it we it is a reaction going out as it came in and so we must understand that we are people who how can I say it we're we're composed of vibrations without these vibrations our flesh would just go everywhere but everything we call it gravity whatever you call it but everything is vibrating and this is why our bodies don't fall apart because they're vibrational forces that are keeping everything together and you and I must understand that even when we move like this or move like that that the opposite way there are vibrations there are movements that are taking place in the Unseen that we don't even see and brother Branham explained it to us he said it never dies even your voice which is a vibration it never dies and they said that even scientists can you know pick up the voice of Jesus because your voice Never Dies your action Never Dies and that's why in the Judgment nobody will be able to lie because everything is recorded oh no on the video of God and this I had somebody to say this to me today we are living Epistles written and read of all men and they said on that day what will people read when they read your scripture your book that has been written by you there is an influence and this influences the influences that we are are dealing with is good and evil that's right because that's what the serpent said basically you know the God don't want you to eat of this tree because the day that you do you will become as he is knowing good from evil and that is true now we are in a in in a in a a dimension that that includes Good and Evil but the dimension in which Adam and Eve was in their influence was only good and that good was God right and then Satan brought in and broke something he destroyed something with with his deception and when they when they broke the word of God uh it began to move them away in other words that became a breach we call it a chasm and and so Mankind and God was once one but now they're separated by a Chasm and the only thing that combined that breach is the blood of the Lamb this is why brother Brandon preached before he preached the seals he preached the breach and showed how Jesus Christ the lamb was able to bring fellowship and communion back to man and God but it took something just like this uh uh thing that Adam and Eve did cause death we needed a tree of life to bring life back to the human race and in order for the Tree of Life to do that he had to die and when he died he died in our Stead that's the cause and the effects like brother random said nobody goes to hell because they are a sinner he said they go to hell because they failed to accept the atonement they go to hell because they fail to accept what Jesus Christ has done for them so you and I must understand by God's grace that uh everything we we we we do it I had like a sub-topic and you've heard me sing that song everything's moving by the power of God because sometimes I think people think that God is a god that's way up into heaven and he's paying us no attention but that's not what the Bible said God said the word of God says that the Lord is not only nigh us but he's in us he's even in our mouths and everything we do whether we understand it or not is being influenced like I said by the word of God we ought to be so grateful to the Lord that God put a seed his seed in US had not his seed be planted had been planted in us we would be just like the world but it's because his Gene is in us and it influences us and has always influenced us even before we became what we call a Christian even when we were Sinners God watched over his inheritance Hallelujah and you and I must understand that those things that we went through during that during the uh uh time of ignorance it still was God protecting us as you heard me say and may have heard me say those dark times were when God Was preparing the ground had not you gone through the the horrific times in your life where your heart was broken where people betrayed you and all kinds of things happened to you you would not have been ready for the gospel because you had to come and God had to bring you to a place in your life where you knew you had needed salvation right I think when Mary was out there doing what she was doing uh there was somehow sometime in her life something woke her up and and what what I believe awakened her is when she heard that there was a man by the name of Jesus Christ that could not only save her but change her see we don't come to church just as you say I'm saved there's a lot of people saying but not changed the Bride of Jesus Christ we come to be changed from glory to glory to glory we move forward and the only way we can move forward in him is to allow his influence the word influence you know um the message um uh uh uh meet and do season brother random talks about that I think in 1965 uh he talks about how that the message is the secret place of God nobody knows that we read it and we thought where's the secret place of God he says it's in the message this is why the message came to hide the bride in a secret place and he said what do you mean because Elijah was in a secret place of God and during the time of the famine he was being fed by a raven you see what I'm saying when everybody else was starving and he says this is the day there's a famine in the land and God Amen is now he's got his bride in a secret place and she's being fed living bread living bread and she's she's living while everybody else is dying see but you see that that without the the the how can I say it had not God sent us Elijah we would have been like all the rest but Elijah found out something himself in reading the word he found out that everybody that worked how can I say it everybody want idolatus there were seven thousand who had not bowed down to bail they were not idolaters you hear what I'm saying now my my I'm going on with this because I'm bringing you to a place of sowing and reaping whatever you sow you shall reap that is the law of God whether it be good or whether it be evil all right and I'm coming and I've said that about the seed the ground that you're planted and this ground this heart which is your ground right listen if it's good ground it repents it gets rid of the Stony stones it gets rid of the the the the uh the the stickers all of everything that that that literally describe a land of death it gets rid of it and all of that is uh is done on your knees God preparing the ground which is your heart and so when that heart is prepared and brought to a place where God says it's good ground it brings forth a hundredfold because remember there was nothing wrong with the seed it was the heart that the seed was planted into is that right listen the word of God tells us according to secretary Corinthians 9 and 6 he would show it sparingly shall read also sparingly and he that saw it bountifully shall read also bountifully let me let me put it this way if you read your Bible a little bit that's all you're going to get is a little bit right because you're you're literally so when you when you're reading your Bible you're sowing seed the word into your heart if you don't so so the word you don't get nothing however little watch people when they don't read their Bible the influence of the word is not there they allow silly things to uh distract them is that right the Bible said those who were who who fell on thorny grounds allowed the the cares of the world to choke it right right so how do you know that the heart is Stony is when they allow the I mean you know thorny is when they allowed the cares of the world to choke them and we've got people all over the message all over the world you know just just oh I Gotta Have This I Gotta Have This I Gotta Have that and you have no idea that your love for God is drifting away it's the truth you find people oh I gotta have this can't come to church I got to work I gotta work I gotta work when one time hopefully I think one time God was The Sinner he was he was your attraction it was it's oh I'm going to church and not going to stop me from going to church I don't know but I was that way I'm still that way even though I'm the preacher I'm still that way but my point is is that because the love of God is waxing coal but it's not God who's doing it it's the influence you got good and you got evil and the influence of evil is working on the people because they're lacking to feed the heart see the Holy Ghost is fed by the word the more word you got and you want the Holy Ghost to really manifest himself read your Bible meditate on your Bible read and listen to the message and the more you do have you ever noticed that when you Slack in these areas is when the Devil comes and trips you how are you going to love God and you don't read his word and his Bible said the word is God the Bible says according to Galatians 6 7-9 be not deceived I'm coming God is Not mocked for whatsoever man soweth that shall he also reap for he that sowed to the what flesh shall of the flesh read corruption now did I put that in there or did that did the word say that but he that saw it to the spirit shall of the spirit read life Everlasting Hallelujah you know it's amazing that people have what they call a buddy plan if my buddy goes to church I go to church if my buddy don't go to church I don't go to church right you know so your buddy plan is going to take you and your body to hell that's the way it works and what people don't understand amen that that is an individual thing but there's so many people who are closer to their friends than they are to God he that sword to the flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption he that sword to the spirit shell of the spirit what reap life Everlasting let us not be weary in well-doing and now I'm gonna tell y'all something oftentimes we don't realize we get there but we get there we get tired spiritually and naturally we get weary in what not evil well doing it's important for us to come to church it's important for us to sing and worship God it's important for us to help people and to do nice and do you know what we do but sometimes we feel overwhelmed am I wrong but the Bible said don't be weary for in due season we shall reap if we think not listen when I get to heaven I want some kind of record that so much so that God could say Well done and you know and I know well done comes because he influenced us that word drove us that word caused us to Triumph y'all hear what I'm saying that's what the Bible said he causes us to Triumph we are the effect of his his Triumph he causes us to Triumph huh think about it and how often time you know we ourselves fall into the inspiration of evil one of the things that uh that always comes to my heart is that the Bible says only the pure and hard shall see God that that's always in my mind always in my heart and you know so when I do wrong I try to make all things right you know um you know I I brought this story up and you know I call it acts of ananias and Sapphira that's what I call the buddy system they were husband and wife but they thought that they would cover themselves their sins together and they thought if they agreed on whatever they were doing that God would uh uh it would be you know Peter them wouldn't see it but they don't understand it wasn't we're not even now dealing with men we're dealing with the Holy Spirit see and you got to guard your heart against evil you know sometimes you know even when I paid my tithing you know the the enemy says you know you want me to calculate it down to the penny I don't do that and whatever that inspiration comes I give more amen that's what I do I fight that devil right because if he's going to have you calculating into the penny after a while he's going to have you subtracting okay right so anyway I fight that spirit because I know listen the Bible said God he he he loves a cheerful giver and we're not supposed to give Grudge grudgefully right but acts 5 1 through let me just read the I'm not going to be long tonight because we we're expecting a storm it may not even show up we've asked God to do that but well you know when he says stop or quit we're going to stop okay but a certain man named ananias and zafara his wife sold a possession and kept back part of of the price his wife also being privy to it and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles feet let me tell you something you know what it was it's basically almost depressing me and and you know because I think to myself how people think that they're actually getting over on the preacher they're so carnal in their thoughts to they can't even see God and that's the Bible you know without the Holy Ghost you can't see God you need there got to be a quickening of the holy spirit is that right I would look at Jesus the very God standing there and those people who's ordained to see him saw him as the Messiah and those who were well educated had money even the Rich Young Ruler had everything laid out just right and could not see him think about it and they fail to see it was the condition of the they weren't worried about the money it was the condition of their heart that God was more concerned about because even though uh Safara had a moment of repentance she failed to repent instead of saying yes me and my husband we conspired to do this which they didn't have to do it like I try to tell people you don't have to do nothing for God everything must be a free will offering if you really you you you basically count counseling out the very act that you're doing everything must be done in joy you can't like oh my God see no it's a lack of Revelation when people do that trust the Lord with all your heart and lean not to your own understanding acknowledge the Lord in all your ways and he shall direct your path and that's where people fall they don't see it they don't they don't see us God that gives him strength oh they get sick and they want to call on God Lord Jesus help me but why should he help you when you wouldn't do what you're supposed to do you re many people are reaping things that they've sown and they look and said why is God allowing this to happen to me because you broke the order and whenever you break order there are consequences right listen that's what people in this message don't understand oh I'm Justified as though I've never seen in the birthplace don't misplace it don't misplace that because whatsoever man so he shall reap you say well what do you mean God told Brother Benham not I think it was he was supposed to go to to Africa and he went to India or whichever way it went and he disobeyed God he called amoeba and almost died why he broke God order did God blessed it when he went to preach yes and because God bless you even in your wrong doing doesn't mean you've gotten away with your sin a lot of times people think ah my mom said this God will slow walk you while you running as hard as you can it doesn't take God but a few steps to catch up and don't you think your sin won't find you out huh Peter said ananias why have Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost and to keep back part of the price of the land and see that's what they understand you know people sit right here you preach on giving and tithing and you know you talk about things like that and I know I talk about that all the time and the reason being I have a revelation of it and I know that if you don't you're cursed so I think to myself you making my preaching to you in vain you're not going to get anything and you're going to walk out here not hearing a word that's coming from the pulpit because of your disobedience is that right oh come on the Bible said that Elijah amen had the Hazel and Hazel was afraid that the Syrian Army was uh surrounded them right and Elijah says Lord open this man's eyes and then he saw a horses cherish a fire all around him because Elijah said they're more of us than them do you understand we're living in the Days of Elijah and as it was then it is now there are more Angels around us than devils thank you it is what it is Hallelujah it's the truth you want God to do a miracle you want God to do something and yet you can't keep listening one of the things Israel had to do was get all the leveling out of the house that's right you want God to bless you you got to get all the leavening out of your house that's just the way it goes and when when when when when Aiken thought he gonna hide his little stuff he calls his whole family to die even his animals wow he broke the order he broke the word the word and has free range in your life when there's a breach like a germ you cut yourself without any anesthesia or anything Satan that germ has a free range into your body to bring an infection that's just the way it goes that's the way life is and yet we see we don't think it we don't think it and I that's what's been really on my heart and mind for a while and and you know just just knowing that everything I do there's going to be a response to it whether it be good or evil and oftentimes it comes when you least expect it and I'm gonna I'm not going to read everything I'm just going to go here because of the time but you remember David said I'm gonna hide this nobody will never know what I did and he thought he going to hide his action that he had with Bathsheba and he went to hiding it so he thought he hid it so well until he actually had Uriah killed and he thought nobody nobody can see nobody's listen let me tell you something God don't need uh what they call it some listening device in your house like like the god Sarah or whatever y'all call her God don't need that God knows your thoughts are far off he sees every move you make and here we find out what are you saying Brothers I am just trying to say to the people that's here including me let us be conscious of everything we do doesn't mean we're going to make mistakes but as soon as we do let's make it right you call that repentance that's all I'm saying we're going to make mistakes but David thought he covered his and God says Nathan I got something to tell you I got something I need for you to do David just did this and David listen a man at the God's Own Heart did it stop God for loving him no because God loved him he corrected him that's what God will do because he loves us he corrects us God is not in the business of just punishing you no he wants to correct you first and as long as you receive his correction don't you know your punishment is less right I can just say it like this and all my children are grown now you know but when I beat one of them yeah I used to whip them when I was with one of my the most stubborn kids the stubborn kids got more licks yeah more love why because you wanted to break that spirit I had a son he just ball up like this and he was all muscle anyway Bob Bobby he would never move sometimes he'll grunt he's still The Fighter I never could break it just showing you amen if you don't break it then they're gonna grow up with it it becomes a problem after a while but my point is God wants to bring us to a repentance so that he can help us how many of you here in here that you know you don't need no help raise your hand you better not raise money we all need we need this Mercy we need his grace but understand everything we do is removed by the power of God and God wants us to have an ear to hear his voice not the devil's voice and David David got in trouble and because of David David did a lot of things you remember David even count the people the number of the people God told him not to do it he did it and he got in trouble and then God put him in a position said which one you'd rather have to punish me you were me or these people and David says no Lord I'd rather you punish me I don't want to fall into the hands of man y'all hear what I'm saying well we don't have mercy on each other yeah yeah we're we're crucify each other we'll have sin in our lives and yet judge somebody else it's true it's true you say that's not true yes it is they wanted to crucify that woman called an adultery like a lot of people around here would do and Jesus wrote down in the sand oh I just want to know what he wrote but whatever he wrote down in the sand it back those people up and he said let me say it like this he that is without sin let him cast the first stone that's what I can't get my I don't understand it people call fall they come short and we ready to Stone them and we got problems in our own lives but our righteousness you want everybody to think you're righteous but Jesus is the one that's judging us see that's what people don't understand God is the one that's judging us let me tell y'all something if I had a problem and somebody put say oh no no you got to get out you can't come to my church do you think I'll stop serving God absolutely not man doesn't control that and because you put me out doesn't mean I'm put out it's all about God and you every it's amazing how churches feel like they can do that and they and their judgments are not even true I don't know how come I'm on this this group because that's not my note but here I am my point is this for every action there's an opposite reaction right look at the men who who literally judge that woman and they end up lost because I guarantee you because they didn't recognize the word then they didn't recognize him later and more than likely they were among the crowd they cried crucified people say oh brother random said let me tell you something if brother Brandon was here it'd be a different story most of these people wouldn't even come to this church because he'll call them out right it's best if they don't want to repent and that's the thing people are you know it's amazing how people say I love the Lord and God Is My All In All but no yeah let's get real with the thing you can't say that God is your all in all and you willfully out there doing wicked things y'all understand what I'm saying I don't even know why I'm saying this maybe somebody just listening you know listen the Bible says because they don't have a love for the truth God gives them over to a strong delusion to believe a lie you believe that Hallelujah God is grateful give me a few more minutes and I'm Gonna Let You Go listen am I listen what program said he said so sin must be dealt and God always deals with sin by judgment that's why our Lord died the death that he did on Calvary is because that sin was such a horrible thing that Judgment of sin was placed on him that those who desire might go free through Believing on him and accepting him as their sin barrier not how good we could be listen to that not how good we could be but how we believe and accept him and when we accept him he comes into our heart and that's where the good part is it's not only what we could do it's on it's on what he has done and what he has done for us that's why people Christians need to go back to the principles and understand what Grace is and understand what forgiveness is and understand that we're all peace in the same pot we all need the mercy and grace of God so we always that's why the Bible said do unto others as you would have them do unto you right remember the man amen who all the debt and his death his debtor forget gave forgave him then he had somebody that owed him and he wouldn't forgive and matter of fact he put him in jail and then the news got back and what happened everything he was forgiven of was placed back on his account y'all hear what I'm saying that's how forgiveness works that's the law that's the order even God said if you don't forgive your brothers or your sisters God can't forgive you that's just the way the word works so all your religious acts and everything else that you do is of no value it has no weight if you can't forgive and the truth of the matter is sometimes you know it's hard to do so but once we remember we remember that God has forgiven us and why why he forgave us because he wanted to you don't Merit forgiveness it's the grace of God and that's what people need to understand well they need to make it right you know how many things you ain't made right yet you know um it's not on what we do can do it's it's on what he has done and what he has done for us there is where there is where see he was wounded for our transgression and Bruce wild iniquity and the chastising on our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed most Christians cannot grow because they don't know how to forgive that's the thorny ground you can't bring forth a hundredfold y'all hear what I'm saying you said why would you say that because Jesus is the first last thing he said before he died father forgive them for they know not what they do he had to do that Stephen before he died father forgive them hold these things not to their charge we all have to do it if you want to make heaven and it can't be something that you just do with your lips it's got to be done with your heart now I haven't seen what brother random said this but somebody told me the other day that brother Reynolds said if you pray for your enemy and you don't love him or her it'll never work it's of no value because you don't love your enemy so in order for it to uh you have victory in that area you got to go before God In Love for their souls you may never like what they do but you got to look at the soul of that person and ask God to give you love for that Soul because listen there is not one person I want to see go to hell we as Christian believes all the word regardless of circumstances we as Christians are able to stand within the book now I'm just laying something down because I'm not finished with this subject because I want to bring something in on order and how we can break order and because we break order it brings a breach before God hello it brings breaches in the family brother Randall said it like this he says if I'm a Christian I have to be identified with every character of the Bible I had to stand with no one and preach with him in the in their days and warn the people that's right I had to stand on Mount Carmel alone with Elijah I had to stand in Calvary and be crucified to myself and my own Thoughts with him but then again I raised with him on Easter triumph over all things all the carnal of the carnality of the world raised above it in him notice it doesn't reflect the word then no it doesn't vindicate it now but if you believe on the word God will vindicate it himself as he did here in Jesus the word bread are always mean to be fed on and Men shall not live by bread like this bread alone but every word so that the word bread keep that in mind is this bread that the church through every age has fed on has been the hidden matter just for the Overcomer only and this matter that we're preaching this word that the prophet of God preached God used especially after the seals we must understand that's the secret place and how you gonna be hidden into that place into that place if you don't study it you don't read it you don't listen to it it's not affecting you your mind is not on a Rapture your mind is not on change your mind is on the world if you're not in the secret place but if you're in a secret place you're not worried about the the president you're not worried about the Democrats you're not worried about the Republicans you're not worried about this perverted world like I was telling somebody today I'm not I'm not where lot was it vexed Lots spirit why should I worry about that or be part of that that's an influence a negative influence we don't need negative influences right now everything must come positive and if we're going to be positive we must stay in the fellowship of Elohim and that's where Abraham was he was fellowshipping with the angel having communion and that's where we need to be the world is going to take care of itself can I ask you a question what about the days of Hitler do you really think somebody could have changed that that was God's plan moving by God's plan hallelujah amen those Jews had the reap what they sowed because on the day they crucified Jesus they said let his blood be on us and our children and God never forgot what they said raised up a Hitler and a stalling and all that but look at the twofold God not only chastened them for doing what they did and saying what they said but he also provided eagles wings so they could go back to their Homeland it's not like he stopped loving them he always loved them but they had to be punished for and there's an action there's a reaction right they had to be punished now if God punished Those whom he loved then what about now the time we're living in is compared like I said to Elijah today and in Elijah's day there's a lot of things going on but that one thing we knew there was a famine in the land is that right and no matter how it looked there was still this one woman a man that needed some food and we're the one the denominational husband is dead and all we've got had was just a little meal and all left and Elijah said if you fix me first see that's what people don't understand we worry about our finances don't you worry about your finances you give to Elijah what he's supposed to get and God is going to multiply you you know I'm guilt he said the meal in the oil that was substance that was life and as long as you give to God your life he will give you his life that's the way it works because I think to myself I said is that not right I mean in the days of the Exodus amen God saw that it was going to happen he knew how it was going to happen he wasn't shocked that you know Pharaoh uh heart was hardened by the fact the Bible said that God hardened Pharaoh's heart God did it no matter how hard those the children of Israel they they cried out they cried out and God made it harder and harder and harder and you know what he was trying to get them to do basically repent and come back to him it only lasts for a moment the god in the wilderness and they all they could think about is how good it was in Egypt see that's what happens to the people in the message you know we come into the religious part of it but it doesn't last it doesn't last in following Moses it doesn't last if you don't see the god that Moses following Moses is leading us but there's a God leading Moses and that's who that's that's how come Joshua and Caleb they saw the God who was leading Moses that's why they had a different Spirit that's why they knew they couldn't be defeated but those who all they saw was Moses I'm trying to get to a quote now Hallelujah you love the Lord I'm almost done Lord forgive me I've gone longer than I intended to forgive me uh we're not finished but let me see if this the one that we want here by the grace of God oh here it is yeah yeah yeah this is coming from the the the church Facebook but consider this also and this is my last quote the prophet Messenger will be in his nature now I'm talking about Elijah and the manner as were Elijah and John the people of this prophet's Messengers day will be as they were in ahab's day and in John's now y'all pay attention to what's being said and since it is only the children whose Hearts will be turned did y'all hear that only the children whose Hearts will be turned because everybody under Elijah Ministry wasn't turned only the children were turned whose heart will be turned it is only the children who will listen in the days of Aid have only seven thousand true see Israelites uh were found in the days of John there were also a few very few the masses in both Ages were in the fornication of idolatry so he's saying idolatry is another form of fornication y'all hear me he's saying it not me I want to make one more comparison between the Legacy and uh prophet's messenger and John the prophet messenger who perceived Jesus first coming the people in John's day mistook him for the Messiah John 1 19 20 and this is the record of John where the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him who ought thou and he confessed and deny and denied not but confess I am not the Christ now this last day Prophet Messenger will have such power before the Lord that there will be those who will mistake him for the Lord Jesus there will be a spirit in the world at the end time that will seduce some and make them believe this Matthew 24-26 for there shall arise false Christ false prophets and shall show Great Signs and Oneness in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect behold I have told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he's in the secret chamber believe it not but don't you believe it he is not Jesus Christ he is not the Son of God he is one of the Brethren a prophet a messenger a servant of God listen what he says he needs no greater honor bestowed upon him then that which John received when he will when he was the voice that cried I am not he but he is coming after me hello somebody guilty everywhere guilty but you think they're going to repent no you know why it's a spirit it's an influence upon the people and they don't even understand that they're moving in the spirit of fornication in idolatry is what it is but listen what happened if you're not filled with the Holy Spirit you're then filled with what spirit they fail to love the truth those don't believe that the whole word is of god scoffs that is coming the message is not all what it says is supposed to be the Bible said love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of God is not in him for all that's in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and and the world passes away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abide in Forever Hallelujah going back to Romans because they didn't have the love of God in them the love of the truth they're saying he said Paul says being filled the 29th verse of Romans 1 being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of Envy murder debate deceit malignity Whisperers backbiters haters of God despiteful proud bolster inventions of things disobedient to Parents Without understanding Covenant Breakers without rule natural affection implacable unmerciful now you say oh what Pauline talking about the world Paul is talking about condition of the church so-called Church people who don't love the truth and we have some who come here they don't love it if they did then be faithful to it they don't even know that the word that we preach is the bleeding bloody word of Christ they don't understand this is not a message from Brother Brooks this is a message from God they don't understand they look and they see a natural man and they're doing the same thing they they did in Jesus they they looked at the outward couldn't see the inward even so his disciples says Lord show us the Father and Jesus said have I been so long with you you don't know who I am when you see me you see the father now I'm not talking about me I'm just saying they don't recognize who he is listen the Bible says who's knowing the Judgment of God that they would commit such things are worthy of what death not only do they do the same but have pleasure in them that do them yeah listen people they drink they smoke they do all kind of stuff that they do around you know what I mean and and nobody tell it ain't me but I ain't gonna tell on them and the Bible said you don't have you're supposed to go to them try to correct them do what you got to do to make it right but I might if I do that nobody would love me hello they're not supposed to love you but we're not here to be loved like that thank you this is a this is a Warfare this is a Warfare no so if they don't love you no I'm not going to hell on a buddy system it ain't happening I I you know it's just the way it really is right so let's let's I'm closing on this okay Luke 8 14-16 we're trusting the Lord will keep us and that which fell upon the Thorns are they which when they had heard go forth and I choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to perfection and I keep wondering to myself with all the people that we have here when are these people or some of these people going to say brother books how can I help what can I do to help the church we need ushers we need deacons we need all kinds of administrations but nobody wants to live right to do that they know we need it but nobody wants to qualify for they can't as long as they're just out there you know lukewarm and loving the world we can't use that God can't use that but we need people that's going to repentance as God I want to do right I want to live right I want to do and I want to help the church but when while people is out there doing they doing no it's just dead weight I hope they hear it because that's what it is dead weight you know it's the truth why do you come to church why do people come to church if they're not going to help out be a part of it why do they do it so they can say I go to church brother Brooks is my pastor whoa brother said [Laughter] but y'all understand me we need life in this place yes and the people who doing the best they can do folks criticize them come on that makes no sense to me but you know what I have to resolve this by saying brother Branham said in every Church there are three kinds of believers and I have to that's the way I solve it and that's the way I get peace and I said for those who are true seed of God they will awaken at some point in time now but that on the good ground but they but that on the good ground a day which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience right no man when he had lighted a candle covered it with the vessel or put it under the bed but setting it on a Candlestick that they which enter in may see the light cause and effect right and in order for us to see have a church a really powerful church and I say this you pray for me I'll pray for you but ever since I've heard brother random talk about that super anointing and I'm not talking about jumping and shouting I'm talking about the person of Jesus Christ being in me and you and living in me and you I believe this message and I believe that's our portion and I'm gonna tell you I want to encourage everybody here tonight whatever you do you keep pressing forward it doesn't mean you're not going to make mistakes but acknowledge your mistakes keep moving forward just don't let Satan you know have a stronghold over your life keep pushing keep pressing because if we do that God sees that and as long as you're pushing forward in your heart in your heart you want will of God that is the holy so bring that Perfection to you if you just have the patience to wait till he comes that's the problem is we sometimes don't know how to wait but God knows if you just continue to press on and pray and whatever is necessary for you to do God's going to meet you let's stand lord said take no thought for tomorrow most people most Christians don't know what that means when you say take no thought for tomorrow they say yeah but the Bible says consider the ant [Music] he stores up and he does this and that but I believe that sometimes I believe that God when he when he speaks of those things you know people always worry yeah tomorrow is not promised when you when the day comes you thank God for the day and you keep moving you know dig your potatoes however brother Brandon says it do it but you put no trust in those things your trust come from God your trust is in the Lord and just think about how far God has brought you listen people I know what it is to have a problem with people and don't know how to forgive I was there it took me three years Lord I forgive Lord I forgive oh I do forgive Lord and every time I would hear that person's name that funny feeling would come on me then I would get mad with people because they would fellowship with it my friends fellowshipping with him then when they knew what he did to me you see what I'm saying it's it's a division it's a devil but my wife and I we just continue to pray and I can't tell you when God delivered me but what he did he did and right now God is my witness if that brother needed help I would do any and everything I could do to help him without even thinking about it I hate the fact that we can't we remember those things but I promise you because I remember it does not affect my decision to help and to love on him the way I would if I could and that's the way it's supposed to be we can't forget what people do but we can love them what about our natural relatives think about how many things they've done to us church people I'm gonna tell you they're the ones that brings the real wounds you know because we expect so much out of them but we forget that we're all in the same part we all faulty without the blood of Jesus the covering of the Lamb you know none of us would make it it is reality and I I I desire your prayers I covet your prayers never forget to pray for me my my the enemy attacks me on a daily basis sometimes all day in my mind I really go through some great battles but but God helps me through each and every one of them and so I do I do I know who I am that's what makes the difference you know I know who God is uh chosen me to be and I appreciate everything he's done for me and my honest desires to be a servant or receive that well done at the end of my destiny at the end of this thing I want to have a well done you love the Lord thank you for your presence thank you for all that you uh that's done for us let's just follow the word of Prayer father God we come before you Lord we thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord we have heard the word we received the word and I pray Lord God that you forgive us all of our sins and our shortcomings Lord we will realize that everything that all of our actions have not been pleasing in our sight and Lord I pray that when we move in the wrong direction and influenced by the wrong spirit that you would correct us immediately Lord that we may make these things right before you oh God if there be anybody that I've offended anybody that I've said things are done wrong I pray that you give us the grace to correct it Lord and make things right Lord I want to be in in in your order I want to be in in the line of your thinking I want to be right where you want me to be I don't want to be like David that that would hide my sins or you know I don't want to be like ananas and the Fire Lord that that that stealing life from you Lord I I want to have a pure heart because you said only the pure and hard shall see God and Lord that's what I desire I believe that's the heart desire of everybody here tonight I pray that you just look beyond our thoughts and see our needs Lord grant us victory in all the areas that we fall short in Lord I believe in the power of your blood I believe in the power of the Holy Spirit I believe that Lord you are the Creator that you create all things and everything that is moving is moving by your power and we pray Lord God As you move Lord move in our lives bring us to that place of perfection in you and father we will eternally be grateful we forever Praise You Hallelujah we will always thank you Father for the goodness and the grace that you've shown to us because in reality Lord we know without you lord we deserve Hell and Hell it would be our portion but because of your sacrifice because of the atonement of your dear Sons Lord we we we we stand free free indeed bless each and every one as we go to our Destinies Lord as our brother
