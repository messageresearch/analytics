[32:25] let us open our Bibles
[32:28] uh to the book of
[32:31] Esther chapter 4 verse of verse 14.
[32:40] verse 13 and 14.
[32:42] the fourth chapter of the Book of Esther
[32:47] because
[32:50] then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther
[32:53] think not with thyself that thou shalt
[32:56] escape the King's house more than all
[32:58] the Jews
[33:00] is
[33:06] or for if thou all together hold this
[33:09] thy peace at this time then shall they
[33:11] shall they enlargement and deliverance
[33:14] arise to the Jews from another place
[33:26] but thou in thy father's house shall be
[33:28] destroyed
[33:29] Detroit
[33:31] and who knoweth where the Thou Art come
[33:34] to the kingdom for such a time as this
[33:36] is
[33:42] let us open our books to the Bibles to
[33:45] the Book of Matthew chapter 7 verse 24.
[33:53] therefore whosoever Hearth these things
[33:56] of mine and do with them I will liken
[33:59] him unto a wise man which builted his
[34:01] house upon Iraq
[34:10] and the rain descended and the floods
[34:12] came and the winds blew and the and beat
[34:16] upon that house and it fell not for it
[34:18] was founded upon a
[34:20] rocks
[34:29] and everyone that here at this sayings
[34:32] of mine and do what them not shall be
[34:34] likened unto a foolish man which built
[34:37] his house upon descent
[34:42] practice
[34:47] and the rain descended and the floods
[34:50] came and the winds blew and bit upon
[34:52] that house and it fell and grade was the
[34:55] fall of it
[35:01] is
[35:03] May the Lord add blessings to the
[35:05] reading of his words
[35:11] tonight I'll I don't want you to speak
[35:13] for too long I want to speak on a
[35:15] subject for such a time like this
[35:21] amen it behooves us for us to know where
[35:25] we are at is
[35:30] I think most of us or all of us we ought
[35:34] to take this quarantine as a time to
[35:36] consecrate ourselves and have some
[35:40] self-reflections
[35:44] because many times you know the devil
[35:46] get us so caught up in a lot of things
[35:49] and we don't realize what's happening
[35:56] is scheduled to just to go to work every
[35:59] time you wake up go to work you're back
[36:01] to sleep and time is just going you
[36:03] don't know what's going on
[36:11] school that's all your life that's
[36:13] what's going on
[36:17] but it is important that once in a while
[36:19] we sit down just have a quiet time with
[36:22] God reflect on your life and see where
[36:25] you are at this is
[36:27] [Music]
[36:34] because sometimes you know as you travel
[36:36] along this journey you might find Cocoa
[36:38] bars sticking to your sticking to you
[36:40] around you
[36:42] know
[36:46] and you don't know where you got them so
[36:48] it's good you know sometimes to sit down
[36:50] and remove all those exes things that
[36:53] are stuck onto you
[36:57] I've done it a few times I sit down then
[37:00] I I look I look at myself I'm like do I
[37:02] really know myself is this me
[37:08] during that whole time you'll be going
[37:10] under a lot of change you don't even see
[37:11] it
[37:14] amen I hope all of us we take this time
[37:17] just to consider it I always and give
[37:19] ourselves unto God
[37:23] check our relationship with God
[37:27] clear up all those clogged up channels
[37:32] so to make sure that we are in a
[37:34] connection amen
[37:36] because we are living in such in such a
[37:39] difficult time
[37:42] the prime ages of all the ages
[37:46] of all the generations still since Adam
[37:50] this is the best one one could leave the
[37:52] two places
[37:56] you see Satan knows that this is the
[37:59] only chance he has for him to do his
[38:01] work
[38:14] accumulation of all of all Temptations
[38:17] trials and everything of all variants we
[38:21] are leaving in that time right now
[38:26] but we're glad to know that the greater
[38:28] the struggle the sweeter the Victory
[38:35] and the greater the testimony too
[38:40] amen I can just imagine after the
[38:43] victory is won and we are done here on
[38:45] Earth
[38:48] I just get excited every time I just
[38:51] start to think about it
[38:55] you know all the saints of the all this
[38:58] and all the stages of old
[39:00] could do all the saints of old
[39:04] they wanted to even this age
[39:06] so when we are going to go over there
[39:09] they're gonna come and crowd around us
[39:12] tell us how did you make it come on we
[39:17] wanted to live in that very age but God
[39:19] said no this is not for you
[39:25] who are supposed to live in it amen
[39:29] and we have no reason to not overcome
[39:33] because in every section God has placed
[39:37] the witness
[39:39] in a workplace environment A salesperson
[39:44] in school wherever God has a witness
[39:49] of somebody who is going to make it
[39:54] and we are going to judge the world
[39:57] so we have no reason to not overcome
[40:02] because God has given us the word amen
[40:06] amen so we're just gonna be we have to
[40:09] make sure that our victories are worth
[40:12] telling alone
[40:16] amen because they're going to look at
[40:18] you and say wow that's really the reason
[40:20] why you went to laodisia
[40:27] amen and we thank God for the word he
[40:29] gave unto us
[40:31] because every time God brings the word
[40:34] because
[40:35] it has a dual effect
[40:39] mercy and judgment
[40:43] Mercy to those who accept it
[40:45] and judgment to those who refuse it
[40:49] and he is a just God
[40:52] he never destroys without sending a
[40:54] warning
[40:57] we have seen him done it before with um
[41:00] with in the days of Noah
[41:04] a lot in Sodom and Gomorrah foreign
[41:19] [Music]
[42:16] amen but God is going to judge people
[42:19] according to that
[42:22] that each and everyone has gotten a
[42:25] chance to receive the word
[42:30] amen every time he brings a message of
[42:33] Mercy is
[42:36] it was going to rain get in the ark
[42:39] noise
[42:41] and it came down to Moses he brought the
[42:45] message of the token
[42:47] if you accepted it your life was going
[42:51] to be saved
[42:53] rejecting the message of the token
[42:55] you were going to be doomeda
[43:22] and we can never overemphasize the
[43:25] importance of having the holy ghosts
[43:32] like you have the Holy Ghost
[44:32] because we know in the end time where
[44:35] there's uh there's a lot of plagues that
[44:37] are going to be cast on upon the Earth
[44:42] this Corona virus is just the beginning
[44:48] of all of them
[44:52] the prophet of God talks about uh
[44:54] diseases where people's flesh just
[44:56] starts falling whilst they're walking
[44:57] the prophetically
[45:02] we ain't seen that yet
[45:05] so whilst there is still time
[45:08] come on in and get the inoculation
[45:11] come and get the Holy Ghost
[45:14] amen I'll read um a message from the
[45:18] oncoming storm paragraph 107.
[45:23] the prophet God says I'm told in the
[45:25] Bible that there will be a Time come on
[45:31] for those who are not in this wonderful
[45:34] sunlight
[45:39] that the followers of the air will eat
[45:41] their flesh of them
[45:47] that disease is on its road
[45:51] that the doctors will never be able to
[45:54] stop it
[45:56] it's the plagues of God
[45:59] the Egyptians doctors that was Far
[46:02] smarter than ours today limited Egyptian
[46:05] it is
[46:14] of their impersonators
[46:19] the power of God
[46:23] to hold his people under the blood of
[46:25] the Lambs
[46:28] amen the holy spirit is that door today
[46:31] the sentence
[46:32] the holy spirit is that safety today the
[46:35] sentence
[46:37] amen so you need that Holy Ghost because
[46:41] without it
[46:43] the doctors are not gonna find the key
[46:53] [Music]
[47:12] they just have to get the temple
[47:15] and we know God never received the
[47:18] worship of the Jews and the Gentiles at
[47:19] the same time
[47:23] [Music]
[47:25] when the Holy Ghost is going to be taken
[47:27] out from the Gentiles
[47:30] and time shall be no more
[47:33] amen if you don't get it right now it
[47:35] will be gone
[47:38] Hallelujah so you have to get the door
[47:41] this is the only door
[47:45] yellow and we are privileged to live in
[47:48] such a time
[47:50] for the whole 6 000 years
[47:54] they've been looking to the promise of
[47:56] the Raptors
[48:00] and the revelation of the Rapture
[48:04] all of the saints were waiting for it
[48:07] but God allowed them to go through the
[48:10] way of death
[48:11] but it is now come unto you and me
[48:16] Hallelujah we are the generation who's
[48:19] going to see the change of our bodies
[48:26] amen it is because for such a time like
[48:29] this
[48:31] Hallelujah we look at Esther is there
[48:35] when she was born she was born in a
[48:37] Strange Land Los Angeles
[48:40] and God allowed her to become the queen
[48:43] and
[48:45] now when she was in the palace
[48:49] it don't mean nothing that you're in the
[48:51] palace
[48:53] it decree that Hammond is sending he's
[48:56] gonna extinguish all of us
[49:04] amen and she was in that spot
[49:10] she was the only one who could do it
[49:12] and she saw that she was predestinated
[49:15] to be in that spot at that time
[49:19] and here we saw Hammond telling her it
[49:22] made me for such a time like this were
[49:24] you born among you are the potatoes
[49:29] Hallelujah so she had to come and fast
[49:32] and pray
[49:34] like never before because he had come to
[49:38] a time where it was a do or die
[49:43] and it was not the responsibility had
[49:47] landed squarely upon her responsibility
[49:50] and they call them for a fast for
[49:52] everybody
[49:54] and they prayed because they knew that
[49:58] our God answers prayers
[50:00] he said I will hear and I will heal your
[50:03] land
[50:05] so not only does he hear about it
[50:26] [Music]
[51:05] so whatever it is just get up and go
[51:08] into the king
[52:08] I have a special
[52:53] they've never seen people trusting God
[52:55] like never before
[52:57] because we know without God
[53:02] people overcoming uh people overcoming
[53:05] Temptations like never before
[53:16] they also wanted to do that
[53:20] David wanted also to live in such an age
[53:22] where he would overcome last David
[53:24] Julius
[53:26] amen but God said no this is not your
[53:29] time
[53:30] especially somebody who's supposed to
[53:32] leadership
[53:34] you want to see people overcome fear if
[53:37] you leave one of his own veins despite
[53:39] whatever comes in there would steps
[53:41] [Music]
[53:47] there is no such a their way we seen
[53:49] many strange doctrines coming in our way
[53:55] even in our own ranks in the message
[53:59] doctrines
[54:01] but there is only a special kind of
[54:04] people yeah on purpose who can withstand
[54:07] that
[54:09] Hallelujah it is because for such a time
[54:11] like this where you and I born
[54:15] trust God like never before
[54:19] I do not want Daniel to say God
[54:23] look over there I told you you should
[54:27] have let me go
[54:29] I don't want to be responsible for that
[54:32] response
[54:33] I want him to say for sure he had to be
[54:36] there
[54:38] because we have been given overcoming
[54:40] Powers Hallelujah
[54:47] we live in a parallel universe
[54:51] whilst everyone is in the laodicean age
[55:05] whilst the whole world is in laodice
[55:09] Hallelujah the eagle Age We Live above
[55:12] all the reproaches of the world
[55:17] the devil he poured the whole hell on
[55:19] Earth
[55:21] but God did not just fold his hand and
[55:24] wait like that
[55:26] he said when the Devil comes in like a
[55:29] flood I'll raise the standard against it
[55:33] when the devil opened the lead of hell
[55:35] and he poured it onto the Earth
[55:44] so you and I despise what's going on
[55:49] we can walk in Heavenly places
[55:54] and have a full taste of what it will be
[55:57] in glory yeah foreign
[56:23] [Music]
[56:47] Hallelujah
[57:03] amen because we know as the bride under
[57:06] the messenger
[57:09] we are going to be the final voice in
[57:11] this final age
[57:14] how will we the final voice of the final
[57:17] age
[57:18] you and I we are the voice of God to the
[57:21] people right now
[57:23] amen so we have to live like it
[57:28] just like we are Elisha from the Elijah
[57:33] the Holy Ghost operating in you and me
[57:37] it must be Elisha Ministry
[57:40] Elijah had the revelation of who Elijah
[57:43] was
[57:44] Revelation
[57:46] he know that although Elijah was gone
[57:49] the God was what the eligible
[57:52] [Music]
[57:53] that's why when he was walking back
[57:56] after he was with Elijah
[57:59] and he was left with the largest quote
[58:03] to Delhi and we know we're also left
[58:05] with the largest course
[58:07] amen when he was walking back to the
[58:10] river
[58:11] he had the Revelation he did not say
[58:15] where is Elijah
[58:17] he said where is the god of your life
[58:20] because you know it was the man it was
[58:22] the god not the man
[58:25] Hallelujah so we have the word in our
[58:28] hands
[58:30] and we are bound to overcome
[58:33] [Music]
[58:34] we are bound to part all those rivers of
[58:38] things that try to come in our way
[58:40] [Music]
[58:42] we use that very same word
[58:45] which is the revealed word of God
[58:48] nothing can stand before
[58:51] and Elijah did the same Miracles that
[58:54] Elijah did Elizabeth because he was
[58:57] using the same words
[59:02] because we got to amen
[59:21] is already written that we are supposed
[59:23] to win
[59:25] before the before the war is over before
[59:28] the battle is over we already know we
[59:30] have already won I've won offender
[59:32] so Satan cannot do nothing
[59:36] he was able to deceive the first Eve
[59:41] he ain't gonna do that to the second
[59:43] year
[59:44] because we have already made it before
[59:48] the foundations
[59:51] no matter what mistake you make you
[59:54] already made
[59:56] because it was as though you never done
[59:59] it in the first place
[1:00:02] to God In Prayer you throw it in the sea
[1:00:04] of forgetfulness
[1:00:07] amen and he will say you never did it
[1:00:10] when the devil the accuser comes to say
[1:00:13] he did it
[1:00:19] and God will say
[1:00:22] [Music]
[1:00:24] that's why it is impossible for us to
[1:00:26] fail foreign
[1:01:10] more than no one knows
[1:01:14] the Theology of the word to say like
[1:01:19] personally
[1:01:21] yeah you can quote it back to back
[1:01:27] he already knows his future and
[1:01:30] Revelations
[1:01:37] I just don't know
[1:01:40] imagine if Christians if we would have
[1:01:42] so much resilience
[1:01:46] no matter what it is we keep on going
[1:01:49] because we know we're gonna make it
[1:01:51] the difference between the devil and us
[1:01:53] is that we already know we're gonna make
[1:01:55] it
[1:01:57] but he know he ain't gonna make it but
[1:01:59] he keeps on doing it
[1:02:02] oh my God
[1:02:04] I just wish God gives us the grace
[1:02:08] [Music]
[1:02:10] and the ability to keep on going is amen
[1:02:16] like early on we read in the scripture
[1:02:18] in Matthew
[1:02:20] I was talking about the wise the wise
[1:02:23] men and the foolish man
[1:02:26] who built their houses one on a rock and
[1:02:28] one on on Sunday
[1:02:34] and when the when the when the storm
[1:02:36] came
[1:02:39] the wise man's house stood because his
[1:02:42] house was his house was built on a rock
[1:02:45] is
[1:02:49] the foolish man's house was was blown
[1:02:52] away by the storm because he didn't have
[1:02:54] foundations
[1:02:57] and he was called foolish
[1:03:01] because he did a foolish dead
[1:03:04] you know when a storm is coming you get
[1:03:06] ready for it
[1:03:09] when you know that there's a tornado
[1:03:11] coming you you go and run in the
[1:03:13] basement
[1:03:14] you don't go walking on the street
[1:03:26] you know
[1:03:28] amen
[1:03:41] so this parallels the the parable of the
[1:03:45] the the the ten virgins to see if if
[1:03:53] we're wise and five four five
[1:03:58] and the foolish ones
[1:04:02] so they were all virgins
[1:04:07] all ten of them
[1:04:10] let's read what the prophet of God says
[1:04:13] in the in the message the uniting time
[1:04:15] and sign the message
[1:04:18] paragraph 134
[1:04:20] it says that's right let us get ready
[1:04:23] for this Midnight Cry
[1:04:27] it's coming in an hour when you think
[1:04:29] not
[1:04:30] alone
[1:04:32] there will be a cry
[1:04:34] not amongst the unbelieving world
[1:04:39] it'll be a secret
[1:04:41] foreign
[1:05:43] so and we know that the signs of the end
[1:05:46] signified a Midnight Cry
[1:05:51] that's going to come to to you and me
[1:05:56] and we're going to be ready for it
[1:05:59] so now the story of the the parable of
[1:06:01] this uh ten virgins
[1:06:11] I'll read here is how many of you all
[1:06:14] perhaps have heard have read of the
[1:06:16] virgins
[1:06:21] somewhere wise and some were foolish
[1:06:24] certain it is
[1:06:27] Virgin means Purity
[1:06:30] they were all good people
[1:06:33] every one of them virgin Sanctified
[1:06:35] vessels of God
[1:06:41] these versions were not random people
[1:06:43] [Music]
[1:06:47] identified vessels of God
[1:06:50] but those who had oil in their lamps
[1:06:53] went in and the others were left out
[1:06:58] they were all virgins everyone is
[1:07:08] the movie they everyone believed in the
[1:07:11] coming of the Lord
[1:07:14] they were ready to go meet him
[1:07:17] but some of them let their oil go out
[1:07:21] don't let that be okay
[1:07:28] the Holy Spirit
[1:07:32] never let it drain from you let's
[1:07:35] passion when you feel your love dying
[1:07:38] away
[1:07:41] charity to Christ and to the course
[1:07:45] quickly go to him who has the Fountain
[1:07:48] of oil
[1:07:50] don't buy for yourself
[1:07:55] when you see your stock going down
[1:07:58] don't wait for it to get finished
[1:08:01] you might come when you don't have it
[1:08:04] you see how close this is
[1:08:08] the foolish virgins they were actually
[1:08:11] waiting for the Midnight Cry
[1:08:15] and they were Sanctified
[1:08:17] the only difference with the wise ones
[1:08:20] is they didn't have the oil the
[1:08:21] difference
[1:08:24] which is the Holy Ghost
[1:08:26] so they were Believers in everything the
[1:08:29] difference was the Holy
[1:08:30] ghosts
[1:08:32] so it's actually closer than we think
[1:08:36] right in our own ranks
[1:08:39] because we are told is coming as a
[1:08:43] secret not to the unbelieving world but
[1:08:44] to the believing world
[1:08:49] the foolish virgin was also waiting for
[1:08:52] the coming of Christ
[1:08:54] the foolish virgin was also waiting for
[1:08:57] the Rapture
[1:08:59] but they made one mistake
[1:09:02] they did not keep checking their oil
[1:09:07] and you see they actually had it at some
[1:09:10] point in time
[1:09:13] that's scary
[1:09:15] they had the oil sometime before
[1:09:18] but it happened that when the bridegroom
[1:09:21] came they did not have it
[1:09:25] so do you see how important it is to
[1:09:28] have the Holy ghosts
[1:09:30] and the prophet God tells us we are
[1:09:32] supposed to have a refilling every day
[1:09:38] it don't matter how long you've been in
[1:09:40] the message or a believer
[1:09:59] you see
[1:10:01] one other thing I heard the prophet of
[1:10:03] God saying the prophet you can have the
[1:10:06] Holy Ghost and go to hell
[1:10:09] I was like whoa
[1:10:12] you can have the Holy Ghost and go to
[1:10:14] hell
[1:10:16] it's because you would have allowed it
[1:10:18] to anoint your body and your spirit
[1:10:21] you don't allow it to get to the soul
[1:10:24] yeah
[1:10:27] you see now the devil doesn't care about
[1:10:30] that
[1:10:32] you don't mind even if you get it on
[1:10:34] your body or your spirit
[1:10:39] that's not gonna change your life
[1:10:41] you come in church songs are being sung
[1:10:45] the spirit comes down you feel it
[1:10:48] feel it on your body
[1:10:54] and you think you got it
[1:10:57] but when you get out the license
[1:11:02] if you see that happening
[1:11:05] that's a very big red flag
[1:11:08] come back and say God I want you to come
[1:11:10] with within the inner Court
[1:11:18] this foolish virgins
[1:11:21] because they just did not have the Holy
[1:11:23] Ghost
[1:11:50] can understand that okay this is no
[1:11:52] longer comfortable we gotta we gotta
[1:11:53] know how to fly now
[1:11:59] get ready
[1:12:01] to put our houses in order
[1:12:04] to check your lamp trim your lamb
[1:12:07] examine
[1:12:09] if you don't have the Holy Ghost go look
[1:12:12] for it whilst it's still there
[1:12:15] come in time when you're gonna try and
[1:12:18] find it and you don't see it because
[1:12:19] she's gone to the juice
[1:12:24] this reefer the doors of the churches
[1:12:26] will be now closed foreign
[1:12:51] he doesn't really get worried for you
[1:12:53] coming to church
[1:12:55] you don't mind you dancing and shouting
[1:12:58] in the spirit
[1:13:00] so long there is nothing in the soul he
[1:13:02] knows he's got you
[1:13:05] he can he comes to you to church he
[1:13:08] comes with you to church
[1:13:10] waits for you at the door he knows by
[1:13:13] the time he comes we're together
[1:13:19] that's the only thing that can scare the
[1:13:21] devil away
[1:13:23] so in is very important that we get the
[1:13:26] holy ghosts
[1:13:29] amen see people receive the Holy Ghost
[1:13:32] differently
[1:13:35] some without Sensations
[1:13:42] the results are still the same
[1:13:46] that somebody has received the Holy
[1:13:48] ghosts
[1:13:58] amen when you no longer do what you used
[1:14:00] to be amen
[1:14:05] you get in trouble if you tell somebody
[1:14:06] they don't have the Holy ghosts
[1:14:11] they'll get mad at you
[1:14:14] they'll ask you well so I do you have
[1:14:17] the spirit measure
[1:14:19] you know how to measure the Holy Spirit
[1:14:22] how do you know that come on you situ
[1:14:25] amen amen they gonna get mad
[1:14:30] I mean if they don't have it amen
[1:14:34] we are not here to judge people some
[1:14:37] participation but we know the word is
[1:14:40] the one that judges us
[1:14:42] and the Bible says but they are fruits
[1:14:44] you shall know that people are deeply
[1:14:46] your life screams out louder than what
[1:14:49] you say or what you professor
[1:14:51] [Music]
[1:14:53] and it's your life that's required
[1:14:56] when you when you want to get into your
[1:14:58] Heaven it's your life that's required
[1:15:35] yeah you just gonna snap like that yeah
[1:15:41] amen
[1:15:45] I understand we all make mistakes
[1:15:48] we are striving to get to that
[1:15:51] Perfection
[1:15:53] and we all make mistakes because
[1:15:57] amen but the more you have if you have
[1:16:00] the Holy Ghost you're going to strive to
[1:16:01] look to look more like Christ because
[1:16:06] we know nothing short of perfect love is
[1:16:09] going to make it
[1:16:13] you cannot keep a graduate your brother
[1:16:15] and expect you to be in the same Heaven
[1:16:22] how does that work
[1:16:24] you already you're already practicing
[1:16:27] social distancing before they even say
[1:16:29] you do it it's a constitution to
[1:16:32] particular distances because you can't
[1:16:35] see eye to eye with your brothers
[1:16:38] you tell me which kind of Heaven is that
[1:16:41] that you are going to go to and can talk
[1:16:42] to each other
[1:17:06] amen because that's what the Holy Ghost
[1:17:08] Jesus said by this shall all men know
[1:17:11] that you are my disciples by if you have
[1:17:13] love for one another
[1:17:21] so in such a time like this
[1:17:25] we are born to have we are born to have
[1:17:28] Divine love for one another some nipples
[1:17:33] you can only come with the Holy Ghost

[1:17:39] afraid of uh covet 19.
[1:17:42] they give it a name a nice scientific
[1:17:45] name but we just know is the devil is
[1:17:48] notifications amen we have dominion over
[1:17:51] it
[1:17:53] because we are told he has made us Kings
[1:17:56] and Priests
[1:18:03] what he says is low
[1:18:05] when you command demons they go those
[1:18:10] because you're a king you have
[1:18:12] authorities
[1:18:14] and we are priests
[1:18:16] because he's the chief priest
[1:18:20] if he is the chief priest who are the
[1:18:22] priests
[1:18:25] amen we say we're going to Crown Him
[1:18:28] Kings of King of Kings
[1:18:30] but then all the kingdoms of Earth will
[1:18:33] be gone yeah
[1:18:36] so which kings are these
[1:18:39] it's you and me he is the king he he is
[1:18:43] the king of us Kings
[1:18:45] so when we are now living in Heavenly
[1:18:48] places we might as well start practicing
[1:18:50] and using our Authority
[1:18:56] when Corona virus comes your way
[1:19:02] you are a priest when when a fellow
[1:19:05] brother gets in a gets in a situation
[1:19:07] you intercede for them
[1:19:12] that's the job of priests
[1:19:15] amen the power that was given to Adam
[1:19:18] when he lost it in Genesis God says he
[1:19:22] gave adam dominion over all things
[1:19:25] Dungeness
[1:19:28] he lost it after the fall
[1:19:31] but God took it before
[1:19:35] after he has given it to you
[1:19:40] so it is to our disposal to use it
[1:19:45] amazing because we got to know we are
[1:19:47] Kings and Priests
[1:19:50] we do not want that power to lay dormant
[1:19:52] in US amen but we gotta use it
[1:19:55] so don't lose focus
[1:20:00] let's keep on looking to Christ continue
[1:20:03] yeah
[1:20:07] the devil is putting so many things
[1:20:10] around us
[1:20:11] so we get distracted but we gotta stay
[1:20:15] focused on Christ
[1:20:17] we should get those blinders and just
[1:20:20] look towards him
[1:20:23] um
[1:20:25] as we are getting closer
[1:20:29] distractions
[1:20:34] we have to come all the way we gotta
[1:20:36] reach our final destination
[1:21:02] [Music]
[1:21:08] [Music]
[1:21:11] amen the devil is thrown out in front of
[1:21:15] us nice houses nice cars
[1:21:21] and you lose your focus of God
[1:21:25] a young person you know you want to
[1:21:28] focus on your career
[1:21:31] and that's all you have in your side
[1:21:35] there's nothing wrong in all of that
[1:21:38] it's good we all want it yeah
[1:21:41] but don't forget the main thing is
[1:21:45] and focus towards Jesus Christ
[1:21:48] turn your eyes towards Jesus
[1:21:51] he is the only main thing
[1:21:56] amen such a time like this
[1:22:01] the only way we have victories if we
[1:22:04] look towards Jesus
[1:22:07] it's from him that our help comes from
[1:22:12] you remember when Peter was walking on
[1:22:14] the water
[1:22:16] when he started he was looking towards
[1:22:18] Christ
[1:22:20] but he started seeing distractions all
[1:22:23] around here
[1:22:25] and he started looking around when he
[1:22:29] started looking around
[1:22:33] don't look around no matter what's
[1:22:37] around you keep it realize
[1:22:39] keep walking Focus On Christ
[1:22:42] we need the blinders of the word
[1:22:47] to keep Christ in our sights
[1:23:44] amen depression is starting to amount
[1:23:47] around you don't look at that level
[1:24:18] thank you
[1:24:34] it's not too late
[1:24:36] just cry out to him and say Lord help me
[1:24:41] the Bible tells us when Peter cried Lord
[1:24:43] help me
[1:24:47] immediately we don't know how far Peter
[1:24:50] was
[1:24:53] but we know God's hand was wrong enough
[1:24:55] to get a hold of him
[1:25:20] If my people who are called by my name
[1:25:22] if they humble themselves and
[1:25:25] prayers
[1:25:26] [Music]
[1:25:35] there is no situation that's too big
[1:25:37] foreign
[1:25:59] amen
[1:26:00] because for such a time like this was
[1:26:04] you and I born
[1:26:08] she had she had the whole nation of of
[1:26:11] Israel going around in circles
[1:26:17] for 40 years
[1:26:19] and we know God was weeding out all the
[1:26:22] memories
[1:26:26] that was that was his plan
[1:26:29] but there was also another plan
[1:26:34] Rahab was supposed to be there
[1:26:37] she had to be in the lineage of Christ
[1:26:41] the story of Christ wouldn't have been
[1:26:43] complete without
[1:26:44] rahaba complete song the children of
[1:26:47] Israel could have taken a three days
[1:26:48] journey to the promised land This is
[1:26:52] 40 years because
[1:27:01] amen so for that time that's what that's
[1:27:04] the reason why she was born
[1:27:07] the way God was waiting for her to come
[1:27:09] to maturity so she could come into the
[1:27:11] into the tribe of Israel
[1:27:15] maturity is
[1:27:21] but God could not do it because he was
[1:27:25] waiting for you
[1:27:27] for you today
[1:27:32] because he says the word says
[1:27:44] you are the final runner in this race
[1:27:50] you know you know you know how they do
[1:27:52] it in the relay race
[1:28:18] is the fastest person
