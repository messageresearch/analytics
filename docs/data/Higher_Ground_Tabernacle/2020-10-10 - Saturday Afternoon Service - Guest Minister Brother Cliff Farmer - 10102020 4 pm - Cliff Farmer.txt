evening let's just turn over to uh ephesians chapter 2 verse 1. i started preaching out of the book of ephesians about almost three years ago and i'm still in it and brother keith they back home they tell me they say we know if cliff's preaching we're going to be in ephesians but i said you know what brother branham said you could look at a at a club piece of clover and you could just preach for years on that right there i believe he said you preached the rest of his life on it i thought man what about a whole a whole book of the bible so but we're not going to preach the whole bible we're just going to take a little piece tonight ephesians chapter 2 verse 1 and you hath thee quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience you can be seated i want to continue reading but i just want to take my time with this now you understand that he's talking about we were dead in sins and we walked according to the course of the world now we see that the way that the course of the world's going we see where they're at and so what we begin to find is that you know i can't be lifted up brother frank in the fact that i serve god but the only thing i can do is say thank god that i'm not like those out there thank god that i'm not of this world but he says you were he said among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh so we were all sinners we all took a part in the lust of the flesh and of the mind and we're by children we're by nature the children of wrath even as others the scripture says but god and i like this the word but there means it's a conjunction it's we're changing what we're talking about it you know it's talking about any time you use but or and it's look this is what we were talking about but now this is what we are talking about and he tells me about a group of people that are walking after the course of the world and he's telling me how i used to be and he's telling me the way i used to think but then he puts a conjunction in here he says but god rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace ye are saved and i just want to take a little simple thought tonight on god rich in mercy i looked up this word rich and it says wealthy abounding in materials and in resources and i i thought about how god is he's not just just rich in in in you know money but he's got all kinds of resources you know sometimes you're praying and you you know god's got resources of animals there was a brother in our church one time praying and he said lord you know if you want this certain thing to happen and he asked something to do with a squirrel and it happened and another brother one time was telling me he was praying you know lord let let a deer walk out here and you know how many points he wanted on the horns and all this and it happened he's a god of resources and and i'm going to tell you he he's a god that can give you a house and he's a god that can give you a job and he's the god that can heal your body we're you know i think sometimes we're guilty of limiting god we're guilty of putting the you know a box around god and we go i know you can go to here and i know you can go to there but i'm telling you he's a limitless god he's a god that you know i think about this he's a god beyond exaggeration you think about that brother frank we can exaggerate anything that we know about is that right brother i can exaggerate how bad a person is i can exaggerate how good a person is i can exaggerate the size of the united states i could exaggerate the size of the earth in total i could exaggerate anything that i wanted to exaggerate until it comes to god and there is nothing that you could say that is so great that you can exaggerate how great god is but he's rich he's abounding in mercy and i looked up this word mercy in the lexicon and it says kindness and good will toward the miserable and the afflicted and that's who i was i was the miserable and i was the i was the sinner i was the one that didn't love god i was the one that didn't serve god but i was the one with the keith that he chose to have mercy on i was the one that he chose to come and get he's sending kindness and good will toward the miserable and afflicted joined with a desire to help them when i read that i thought oh my it's not just that he will help me but it's actually his desire to help me it's not just that he can help me but it's that his very being is i want to help them you know there's a church of christ a church in our town and you know our town is almost overran by church of christ you know sometimes you go to their catholic towns and there's baptist towns but in our town there's church of christ and so i used to work for a man that was church of christ and and we began to talk about miracles and of course he said we don't believe in miracles i said well what about healing and he said well we believe god could heal you if he wanted to we're not saying that he couldn't we just it's just that it's it's not really something that he does anymore but i'm thankful that i found a god that it's not if he decides he wants to it's that he always wants to it's not a god that could but it's a god that can it's not a god that used to but it's a god that does god's desire is to help me now as i begin to look in the scripture i saw some things that i just wanted to point out because god's help doesn't always seem like mercy brother frank god's mercy doesn't always seem merciful second samuel 7 and 14 says i will be his father oh aren't you thankful for that and he shall be my son if he if he commit iniquity i will chasten him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the children of men i looked at that and i thought oh my we love to talk about the god that wants to be our father but now he's saying listen if you're my son i'm going to whip you i'm going to whip you when you need it you know i've been looking lately at what the heart of a real shepherd is the heart of a real shepherd and christ is the good shepherd but i begin to look you know brother branham tells us that a pastor is a shepherd and you understand that a shepherd has a staff and that staff helps him walk and that staff is the word of god that staff in his hand is what helps him take those sheep to green pastures but that is the same staff brother keith that he will break those sheep's legs with whenever they get out of line you understand that the word is not always just oh it's a good word and it's a god is a god of blessing but sometimes the word has to come and it has to strike us it has to take our knees out from under us why sometimes we stray a little bit but i was reading today and the prophet of god said listen he said sometimes the sheep will stray he said but the shepherd will stray with him and i begin to think that even at my lowest valley i have a shepherd that is willing to go into the lowest valley with me when i would stray off a cliff i have a shepherd who is willing to stray off the cliff with me and he said the shepherd will stray to bring the seat back he said i'll chase in him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the children of men but my mercy shall not depart away from him as i took it from saul whom i put away before thee you see chastisement is mercy you know i thank god when he whips me you know sometimes i i'm driving down the road brother keith i'm listening to a tape and i just start realizing man i i ain't been living like i ought to and i hadn't been praying like i ought to haven't been as sincere as i ought to be and i feel like god is just kind of whipping me and he's saying cliff you've you've been straying you've been getting out of line but what i'm thankful for is that the same god that whips me he pulls me back into explosive when i say god forgive me i'm sorry for failing you he pulls me back in my legs may be broke but then he heals me it's the god i serve he's rich in mercy chastisement it's mercy brother branham in questions and answers in 62 he says god bless you be rich in mercy to you make his face shine upon you and keep you and bless you in all heavenly blessings oh that sounds great he says now i say this not cruel but of love i pray that you that don't know him that your pillow will be so hard that you'll not be able to sleep no more he said your food will be so foul till you can't eat no more until you slip out by the side somewhere and say lord be merciful to me he said that's not wishing anything wrong to you that's for your good brother and sister i i'm going to tell you i find that sometimes we don't pray the right way sometimes we're not willing to say god whatever it takes and and if it takes the food not tasting good and if it takes sleepless nights but we've got to come to a point where we realize no matter how rough it may seem no matter what kind of a trial it may look like it puts someone through praying for god's mercy is is the only option and god's mercy is great but sometimes it hurts the mercy of god i'm going to tell you sometimes you might be going the wrong direction and the mercy of god will make your truck motor go out on you it's god's mercy and you think why did this happen but it's the mercy of god i'll share with you a testimony there was a a young man who used to go to church with us and he he came up to our pastor's house one day and he said brother david he said my transmission is out on my truck he said i can't get it to drive hardly at all and he said it i barely got here and brother david walked outside and he said do you believe the lord would heal your vehicle he said i do and they laid hands and they prayed over that vehicle and he drove it for two years never done anything else to it but that young man got out of church he got on drugs and one day was driving past our pastor's house and he saw that he wasn't home and he was he done some tree work and he pulled up into our pastor's drive and he stole a chainsaw and when he went to back out of his driveway that transmission went out again what was god doing brother keith now we think why did god let that happen i'll tell you why he was showing him that young man's testimony was he said when that happened he said i knew right then this is a real god he said a god that can hold a broken transmission together until i went wrong he said that's a real god i had an uncle one time he was raised in the message he served the lord as a young man but he went astray and we began to pray for him i i heard my dad tell the testimony as just a young boy he was out in sin and they began to pray and they said god don't let him sleep no more until he gets everything right with you don't let him sleep lord make him miserable until he turns himself around and one night my uncle called my dad and he said forrest i gotta get right with god he said listen he said my food don't taste good no more he said i can't sleep no more he said my truck broke down everything's wrong at my job he said my life is falling apart what was it it was god's mercy uh our pastor back home when he was a young man he was raised up in church but he went astray and he was in a motorcycle gang and he was a pretty rough pretty rough fella not serving the lord he told me that one day he took a i hope this is all right to tell but he he he actually took a contract he was going to kill a man and the man was living in a mobile home and brother david tells us the story he said i went and he said i opened up the door on that mobile home and what he didn't know there was a gas leak in there and it blew up burn him burn him from head to toe and he was put in the hospital and they had to scrub him and scrub the skin off of him his family tells the story they said you could hear him screaming anywhere on that floor of that hospital he was in so much pain but he tells the testimony he said through that he said god got a hold of me god didn't let me take that man's life and god began to to restore him through through all of that pain and through all that term on you saying how in the world could it be a good thing i'll tell you how because 50 years later he's serving god 35 years as a sitting pastor in this message what was it it looked like turmoil and it looked like destruction but it was god rich in mercy when i was a young man coming up our pastor used to tell me as a teenager i was you know i was just like any other teenager i done bad things i sinned you know i i dealt with lust i dealt with those problems and i would go over and over and over and i'd go back to the altar and and i one time i told brother david i said i don't know why i just feel so terrible and he said that's good he said brother cliff i want you to always remember this he said condemnation is your best friend and what i didn't realize when i would mess up brother keith and when i would fail god i'd always the same thing would happen i'd get sick to my stomach i'd start bobbing at it you know what to me it was just pain and it was sickness but it was god's rich mercy he was whipping me back into line and you know what as many times as i failed i found out i could go back to an altar i found it and it didn't have to be an altar at church but i could go back to an altar in my heart and i remember one time i was out hunting and i just got so miserable with myself i just stopped my truck out on a gravel road i got out and i knelt down on an old muddy gravel road and i said god you gotta fix me god i'm tired of living this way you gotta fix this problem what was it god rich in mercy david said in psalms 5 and 7 he said but as for me i will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy and in thy fear will i worship toward thy holy temple you know when i looked at this brother frank i thought david david said god had a multitude of mercy well isaac david needed mercy david was a guy that we could pick his life apart we could talk about david and we could say he was a failure and that'd be right we could say that david was an adulterer and we'd be right we could say that david was a liar we'd be right we could say that david was a murderer because he had a man murdered and you know what we'd be writing all those things we said but i'll tell you something else we could say about david that he had a repentant heart and every time he messed up he went back to god and through the adultery and through the lies and through the murder and through all of the mess-ups that we know about david he would go back to god and because he had a heart that he wanted to be right it would later be recorded that david is a man after god's own heart david needed a lot of mercy you might feel like david here tonight and you say man i mess up all the time that's good i said that's good i'm not saying it's good to sin but i'm telling you sometimes i think we need to mess up just enough to remember that we're nothing and to remember brother keith that if he ain't holding our hand i can't walk out that door if he's not holding my hand i told a brother the other day i said listen i said the reason you know people are leaving the message because they were taught as kids that brother branham couldn't make a mistake and then they found out that he did make mistakes and i said you know what i have to realize to realize he was a prophet i have to understand that that prophetic gift was perfect and that prophetic gift never failed but that prophetic gift dwelled inside of a human being that was born by a sex birth that came the wrong way who had the ability to lie and have the ability to sin and i said you know why i have to give brother branham that much grace because i gotta have that much grace i realize that to ever stand behind a pulpit brother frank i know i'm not worthy brother samuel i know i'm not worthy to stand here but i know that there's a perfect gift laying on the inside of me there is a perfect seed gene down on the inside but it's inside of just an old failure piece of flesh david needed a lot of mercy and through all that david went through he said in psalms chapter 23 he said surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever i'm going to tell you mercy is following you me and my wife we were on the road here a while back excuse me i said we just need to pull over on this exit and i'm going to tell you i still don't know brother keith why i stopped before i could get in the turn lane for the exit i saw that the gas station was out of business and for some reason i went ahead and pulled over and i remember thinking i said i don't know why i even looked at my wife and i said i don't know why we pulled over and i just got right back on the exit and when i did about a quarter of a mile up the road right in front of me there was a car that i we had been right along in the same area and i got back up behind this car and it ran right up underneath a semi truck semi had locked up his brakes in this car went up underneath there and i said my god if we wouldn't have pulled over i'm going to tell you sometimes god speaks and and sometimes he leads you to do something and you're going it doesn't seem like that great of a thing but it's god rich in mercy sometimes you don't understand the things that he's keeping you out of but it's god rich in mercy david tells us about a god you know i like to talk about this i i'm a radical believer you know what radical is you know they talk about muslims and they say well there's muslims and then there's radical muslims i want to tell you i'm a radical believer i'm radical i i i just believe that god's got enough power to do whatever he wants to do i i believe that there is nothing beyond his reach and i i believe that he's so merciful that to the what let me tell you how merciful god is i want to ask you a question now and i'm asking you to talk back to me what's the one sin that cannot be forgiven what is it blasphemy but paul said i blasphemed so even when you go so far that you could even find scripture to prove there's no coming back god still has enough mercy david described a radical mercy romans 4 and 6 says even as david also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom god imputeth righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin he won't impute it not that he didn't not that he just said i won't this timer i'm going to let you slide by today but he said i'm not going to i will not do it i i god cannot impute sin to you why because of the shed blood of calvary when the blood is upon you and you claim the blood god sees the blood of jesus christ and for god to impute sin to you he'd have to be imputing it to his own blood you might think well i use a lot of mercy have you ever felt that way i need a lot of mercy maybe you feel like you've used up his mercy it's okay lamentations 3 22 said it is the lord's mercies that we're not consumed because his compassions fail not they are new every morning great is thy faithfulness i when i read that scripture i thought oh my if for some reason i could fail him so much brother frank that i could run out of mercy today i can lay my head on a pillow knowing that when i wake up in the morning that his mercies are new again i confess he said he said for us to forgive 70 times 7 490 times if by chance brother keith you fail him 491 times remember this his mercy is new every morning you say but i failed him so bad but when you wake up in the morning he says i don't even remember what you did yesterday that's the god i serve i serve a god that when it got down to the last minute i tell you sometimes we talk about abraham's ram but that wasn't really abraham's ring come on now if abraham would have killed isaac he might could have had another son but if isaac got killed it was over for isaac and isaac was laying there in need and god provided a ram for isaac and i'm going to tell you i i know about a god that can provide when you're down to your last hope when you're down to where there's nothing left whether it's in prayer for a family member and you've given your last bit of strength and you're down to your last bit of hope or maybe it's for the church that you go to or maybe it's for your job or it's your whatever it is it doesn't matter i'm talking about a god who's rich in mercy i begin to think about hezekiah i want to talk to you about hezekiah second kings verse chapter 20 and verse one it's a little bit of reading but i want you to catch something in this in those days was hezekiah sick unto death and the prophet isaiah and the son of amos came to him and said unto him thus saith the lord now when thus saith the lord comes forth there's no change in that set thine house in order for thou shalt die and not live then he turned his face to the wall brother keith i'm going to tell you what i think we lack we turned our face to the wall enough and he prayed unto the lord saying i beseech thee oh lord remember now how i walk before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and hezekiah wept sore hezekiah turned his face to the wall he began to weep on the inside and that man's prayer and that man's faith touched the heart of god and it came to pass before isaiah was going out in the middle court that the word of the lord came to him saying turn again and tell hezekiah the captain of my people thus saith the lord god of david thy father i have heard thy prayer i have seen thy tears behold i will heal thee on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the lord i looked at this i thought now brother keith how could god send a man with thus saith the lord and turn him back around and change what he said verse 6 says and i will add unto thy days 15 years and i will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of assyria and i will defend this city for my own sake and for my servant david's sake and isaiah said take a lump of figs and he took it and laid it upon the bowl and he recovered and hezekiah said unto isaiah what shall be the sign that the lord will heal me and that i shall go up into the house of the lord the third day and isaiah said the sign shall thou s this sign shout thou have of the lord that the lord will do the thing that he has spoken shall the shadow go forward 10 degrees or go back 10 degrees and hezekiah answered it's a light thing for the shadow to go down 10 degrees i begin to think about this if if for some reason if for some reason the shadow suddenly move forward you could say well maybe maybe it was supposed to have been there maybe you know you there would be all these questions in your mind he said it's a light thing that he'd go forward if we was looking at a clock on the wall i don't see one here we go i won't preach too long if i looked at my clock and all of a sudden it moved forward brother keith you know what i could say i could say well maybe the battery was just catching up but if it went backwards it'd be something real significant and he said or go back 10 degrees and hezekiah said it's a light thing for the shatter to go down 10 degrees nay but let the shadow return backward 10 degrees and isaiah the prophet cried unto the lord and he brought the shadow 10 degrees backward now look at this he walks in as a prophet of god and he says get your house in order you're going to die it's thus saith the lord and he walks out the door and before he can get out of the middle court let me put it in today's terms before he can get out of his front yard god says go back and ten minutes later here he is back in his living room or his bedroom again and he says listen you're not gonna die let me talk about how great god is the shadow going backward 10 degrees i looked this up brother keith it was a 15 minute gap the prophet of god told us that god cannot change his mind about his word but i'll tell you what god is able to do he's able to take time back to before he said that he came with thus saith the lord but god turned the time back so that when he came back he said no you're gonna live i'm talking about a god rich in mercy maybe maybe the could have said wait a minute at 6 15 you said he was going to die and isaiah could say it's not 6 15 yet oh i'm talking about a god rich in mercy he can turn back time for you i'll tell you that's what happens when you go to a doctor and he tells you you got cancer but you go back and he says there's no cancer there what is it god takes you back to a new body he takes you back to the healing i want to go further than that i remember one time brother branham said he was praying for a little woman that was in an insane asylum he said he was sitting talking with her and she said i gave my my mind has been given to the devil i gave my body over to him and the prophet of god said little sister i know a god that can take you back to when you were a virgin i'm talking about god rich in mercy brother branham says and god almighty jehovah reconsidered that man's case i'll tell you maybe tonight you got something you need god to reconsider maybe you failed him so bad you just need you need him to come back to you maybe you've grieved him away and you want to go back to the time when he wasn't out there on a limb but he was with you the time when oh let me brother keith i was thinking sitting in the back there when you was praying for service i'm going to tell you sometimes they're just things that stand out to you i remember you remember when we met at the restaurant a few years ago i tell you we met we had all been praying we were all on fire before we knew it we didn't really care about the food on the table we were shouting we were saying glory to god in the middle of a restaurant people were looking at us like they've lost their mind and we had we had lost our mind but we had been we had stepped into a place where the mind of christ had come in and it didn't matter that we weren't in church it didn't matter that we wasn't in a prayer room somewhere we had turned a denny's restaurant into a meeting house of god i tell you sometimes we we just get to the point where it ain't like that you know what i mean brother keith we just get cold on him but i'm telling you you can't ever get so cold that you can't go back you can't go back i'm talking about a god that no matter how cold you're getting how far you run and how many bad things you do that you can go right back and say lord i'm sorry i was telling a man that i worked with the other day he said he said i don't know about a death bed repentance i said i do that's the kind of god i serve i told excuse me i told him that there's people that don't know about him he told me he said well what if what if a man took his own life could he be saved i said listen all i know is that i serve a god that's rich in mercy i said god don't judge those who are out of their mind and i don't believe you could take your own life and be in your right mind so i don't know if god judges them or not but what i what i'm trying to tell you is that i serve a rich a rich god it's rich in mercy he said god almighty jehovah reconsidered that man's case because he prayed think of that almighty god that had pronounced death upon the man reconsidered his case the prophet of god said my that's too much for me the great jehovah to immortal to one of the earth would reconsider his word that he had said to him a god so rich in mercy brother that you could go to him in prayer with tears turn your face to the wall and brother frank he would reconsider what he told you that's a rich god i began to think about paul one time before he was paul when he was still the old man he was stoning stephen stephen looked up he said i see jesus at the father's right side this is how much mercy god had if we could put it in today's terms a message preacher of the day and saul was standing there killing him but god would not allow stephen to pronounce judgment on him because there was a predestinated seed down on the inside of saul and all that saul needed for that predestinated seed to come forth was just one walk down the road to damascus and because god knew there was a seed there and because god knew that damascus was coming he would not allow stephen to pronounce judgment on him and stephen said oh father lay not this sin to his targets oh if stephen would have laid the sin there paul would have never been apostle paul but because god is rich in mercy he took the blasphemy from paul and put it under the blood i began to think about when gross darkness begin to cover the earth i'm going to tell you you can you can listen to the radio you can get on facebook you can watch the news it's dark it's gross darkness i feel brother keith that it's about like it was in egypt where the scripture said it was a darkness so dark you could feel it but i was out in sabino canyon a few years ago a dear friend of mine and he took me up there and i don't know if any of you ever been to sabino canyon it's precious so you may know this but i'm gonna tell you again we walked up and sabino canyon you know comes down like this and then there's just this one little mound that kind of sticks up and we were standing there and the brother told me he said brother cliff he said you're standing where the prophet of god was standing when the sword came in his hand and i looked up and out of sabino canyon there's this little dip and the brother told me he said brother cliff he said that time of year when brother branham was up there he said the whole canyon would be dark he said but where the sun comes up it comes up right over that little dip and he said because this little mound stands up he said the rest of the canyon would be in black darkness he said but there was light right there and i began to think that the message of the hour came the sword came into the hand of a strong hand of faith and though the rest of the world was in darkness and in gross darkness the scripture isaiah 60 and 1 says but arise and shine for thy light has come it wasn't a light for all of the canyon it was a light for those who had been caught up and brother branham tells us that we're not in a laodicean church age he said we've been called up he said god pull the bride out of the church what was it light shined on the bride it was god rich in mercy darkness upon the earth but god sent a message to call you out brother branham says in the seal of christ he said it's god's mercy first before judgment he said and i'm sure that's what america is hearing now god's mercy presented to the people before judgment what was the message of the hour his mercy you know people are walking away from this this message brother keith and i don't understand it you know when i heal hear jezebel religion you know what i hear i hear mercy people hear it and they go well he was just fussing about makeup and he was fussing about television i don't hear that i hear mercy when the prophet of god tells about his vision and he said they were starting to get out of step and he said i was screaming get back in step brother keith i hear mercy i don't hear it as a judgment cry i hear mercy in it let me try to i'm going to try to i say i'm going to try to close i'm going to try to start closing it takes me a while to close but i'm going to tell you about something that happened down about 30 minutes from my house brother branham was he was in jonesboro arkansas and there was a little girl there she was blind she came to the meeting and she was wanting to want to receive her sight brother branham said that i could see she was blind and she was calling out for her daddy he said i just moved around and i got in front of her and he said i got to where she had to bump into me i'm just going to read a little bit of this story brother brandon begins to talk to this little girl and she said if you'll just help me to wear that man's at that's praying for the sick i'll be able to find my daddy after that brother branham said that was too much for me he said i thought i'd been a hypocrite long enough i said now lady hold your peace do you believe that guy's the healer she said i believe jesus is the healer i said that's right i said but i'm brother branham she said is you the healer and i said no brother branham said she grabbed me by the lapels of the coat and said is you the healer and i said no you said jesus was the healer she said yes sir but you're the parson branham and i said yes ma'am she said oh have mercy on me parson random she said lord how did this ever happen i'm going to tell you sometimes i see god so great in mercy i think how in the world how did this happen he said see he said how did this ever be he said god knows how to do it and i said well if you'll turn loose of my coat he said and i couldn't pull it no sir she wasn't going to turn me loose she was holding right on tight she said no sir i might lose you well frank i thought my if we would get a hold of our promises that way the prophet of god said if you've got lost loved ones he said you claim the blood over them and i'm going to tell you what we ought to do brother keith we ought to grab ahold of that quote and just not turn it loose i'm going to tell you he said there was going to be a bride in this last day that'd be victorious and we ought to grab ahold of that quote and just not turn it loose brother branham told us there's going to be a bride that's going to rapture out of this chaos and i'm going to tell you i'm holding on to that quote i'm not turning it loose why it's the mercy for me he said i might lose you and i said no i'll pray for you and i said let me have your hand just a minute i want to hold your hand while i pray for you he said now after brother branham prayed he said i said now open your eyes you've received your sight in the name of jesus christ she opened her eyes she said light is that lights said what is this see it wasn't too thin yet she couldn't tell daylight from dark but it shrunk you see when the life went out of the cataract she said what is them spots is that people going i said that's right she said oh lord i who was blind now sees and she gave a big scream and jumped out like that and i began to thank for the keith about when i came in contact with the prophet oh no i never touched his flesh no i never touched the lapel brother frank but i came in contact with a word that opened my blinded eyes i was blinded by lust i was blinded in sin i was blinded by a by just an old natural sex birth but i came in contact with a new birth i came in contact with a message of the hour and it took the blinders from my eyes that i could see what was it god rich in mercy you probably know the testimony but my dad you know he came here and preached here not too long ago and he's supposed to be crippled i don't know if you all know that testimony do you know about brother keith i'm going to tell you you know about it brother all right well you're going to hear it again he was supposed to be crippled but he came in contact with a prophet and that prophet called his name called the name of my grandfather out and he said you're praying about your son with his feet he said he's healed in the name of jesus i'm going to tell you something i like the way the prophet said it he said his feet are healed he didn't say that they'll be straight he said they're healed my dad was no longer a but about five years ago my dad had a motorcycle wreck and his foot was broken my mother she sent a text to all of us kids and she said just pray for your daddy's foot brother keith i found that quote and i sent it back and i said i don't have to pray i've got a quote right here that said my dad's feet are healed and i'm here to tell you my dad went back to the doctor and without surgery my dad's foot was healed again what is it god rich in mercy i'm telling you that quote it wasn't just good for a five-year-old boy or a ten-year-old boy but when he was 55 when he was 60 when he needed the quote again it was still fresh why because my mercies are new every morning i'm here to tell you you're healed if you need it i hope you don't think this is too far out there but i was driving down the road one day i'd just been really nervous and i i turned on a tape i was listening to it about that time i just reached up and i went like this right here and brother branham said what about you young man scratching your nose he said do you believe god will take that nervous condition from you come on it's god rich in mercy hear about i guess it's been about a year ago i was supposed to minister in our home church on a sunday night and sunday afternoon i came down real sick to my stomach and i thought well i'm not going to let the devil win you know sometimes we just lay down and let the devil win we got to quit letting the devil win the devil can only win if you allow him to win i told my wife i said i'm going to go out to the car and just sit for a minute and i went out and i was sitting in the car and i was listening this taping all of a sudden brother keith i just felt a presence moving to that car and that presence got so strong i'm gonna tell you i thought man i don't i don't want to leave this and about that time i heard the prophet of god say he said do you feel that presence now you might think i'm crazy but i said yes i do he said that pillar of fire is hanging right over your head and brother keith when i heard him say that i went to shouting and i went to crying and i went to praise it and you know what i didn't hear nothing else that he said so i rewound the tape and this is how it went he said that pillar of fire is right over your head he said that stomach trouble just left you i'm telling you it's fresh it's not a 60 year old gospel it's a fresh gospel why as i said the message is the mercy of god and the message the mercy is new every morning what are you going to do when you can't get a word from the lord what are you going to do whenever you can't get a hold of your pastor and you need a word from the lord i'm telling you his mercy's new there was a brother in our church and i'm closing i promise i i don't want to keep you too long there was a brother in our church back about two years ago he was sitting back here about where brother samuel's at and our church is kind of over on the right side like that and my dad was preaching and the brother fell out and you know i like the way god works out things the brother fell he falls out he he slumped over in the pew and we had one man there that was a first responder registered cpr or excuse me uh certifying cpr we had another man there that was a paramedic and both of them went over to him they said he's dead there's no pulse left in him our pastor told the church he said just just don't get work don't get shook up about it and i was gone but they tell me my dad just kept right on preaching i'm gonna tell you can't stop preaching just because the devil gets in the mix of something you cannot stop if god's told you to do something don't stop just because of the commotion there may be a lot of commotion going around just keep doing what god told you to do and they went down there and they prayed over him now i'm here to tell you that dead man raised back up and set up on the pew and he looked around for the keith and he said he saw them people standing around him and they said he said what's going on it's god rich in mercy he can still raise the dead about six or eight months ago i don't know some of y'all may have heard about it there was a tornado that came through our area just demolished demolished one of the larger towns thereby there's a sister in our church that goes there that lives there in that town and she said that they walked outside and they saw the tornado coming from their house and they went into their closet brother keith the closet she went into she testified later she said that's the closet i go pray in and they went in there and they just they just kind of huddled up in the closet and they began to pray and they said lord will keep us safe from this tornado and they begin to hear the storm taking their house and when they walked out of the closet they said they had to push the door open because debris was in front of it brother frank the whole house was gone but the only wall left standing was the closet where they were there praying i showed the picture to the church back home and i may have it if some of y'all want to see it the whole house was gone i said i'll tell you why the house was gone but the closet was standing i said an angel came and stood between the storm and i'm telling you you may be in a storm right now but i know a god that can send his angels to have charge over thee that when the storm would take you out they'll just cover you one year ago it's about this this same month our pastor found out he was a diabetic he had a sore on his foot it wouldn't heal up he finally went to the doctor with it and he was having some headaches and they said sir you're in bad shape they said you've had two heart attacks and multiple strokes there he was i watched him brother keith he's my best friend i watched him lay in that bed and i thought oh god he's he's going to take him and i was laying by or sitting by his bedside there one evening he turned over to me and he just so weak he couldn't hardly even function he said brother cliff he said the lord told me everything's gonna be all right and i told my wife when i walked out of there i said i don't know how he means everything's gonna be all right because if he goes home it's all right i said i don't know how he meant it but i just had to hold on we had to believe the doctor come in and they said you're a diabetic you got heart trouble you got this stroke trouble and they began to put him on medications and they put him under two different heart surgeries within a matter of a month and we just believed he wasn't gonna make it but i'm a witness today that the first weekend of february he stepped back out to the pulpit and he preached to us and i'm a witness of something else he went back to the doctor a few weeks ago and they said your heart is fine don't come back they said your blood pressure is fine don't come back they said your blood sugar seems to be okay and he gave witness he said brother cliff he said i have not took insulin in three months and my blood sugar is regulating itself what is it god rich in mercy i just want to close with this right here you may know this story but there's a very famous painting that hangs in the louvre in paris it's called checkmate and this painting portrays a young man playing chess with the devil of course you know that checkmate means the game is over but i was reading a story and they said that there was a chess master that was standing looking at this painting and they said he stood there for a very long time just looking and looking and then they said finally he began to scream and they said what's wrong he said i'm a chess master and he said i've been looking at this board and he said it's not checkmate he said the king has one more move and he said let's set up the chessboard again and let me play and i begin to think oh my god that sometimes we get down to the point where the devil comes to you and it might be your family or it might be your church or it might be your job or maybe it's just you've lost your joy and he comes to you and he says i've got you in checkmate now it's over boy but i got news for you tonight no matter what situation you're in the king has another move would you stand to your feet with me one more move tonight maybe you need the king to move just one more time for you it's a god rich in mercy do you need
