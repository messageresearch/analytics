[22:55] [Music]
[23:04] [Music]
[23:23] [Music]
[23:58] [Music]
[24:08] Hey what an appropriate song in a probe
[24:18] in appropriate hour
[24:25] second Corinthians 5:17 we thank God for
[24:32] his amazing grace
[24:36] appreciate the Lord for being so
[24:40] gracious and so good to us like they say
[24:46] he has been better to me than I've been
[24:49] to myself yes he's taking really good
[24:53] care of me
[24:54] can I get a witness
[24:57] I love that second Corinthians 5:17 amen
[25:07] OOP mercy therefore if any man be in
[25:14] Christ he is a new creature old things
[25:19] are passed away behold all things are
[25:24] become new
[25:26] let us pray father we thank you for your
[25:29] amazing grace you've been so good to us
[25:34] you open your word to us when we don't
[25:37] even deserve it
[25:39] but Lord and all that you do show us it
[25:43] means nothing unless divine love abides
[25:46] in our souls because you said if a man
[25:50] could have faith to move mountains Lord
[25:54] he can give his body to be sacrificed
[25:57] he can give food to the poor but all
[26:01] these things avail nothing Lord if if we
[26:05] don't have that charity which is your
[26:07] divine love father we didn't come law
[26:10] tonight to be religious those things
[26:14] come nowadays a dime a dozen but father
[26:18] there are those whom you left here on
[26:21] earth to be a witness in this wicked
[26:25] world you have left us O God as a
[26:28] standard and father we want to be that
[26:32] standard but we understand also Lord the
[26:36] principles of your laws that no man can
[26:39] add one cubit to a statue
[26:41] we understand Lord it's not him that
[26:44] will it nor he that runneth but Lord you
[26:47] that shows mercy and father God we come
[26:50] before your Lord and we're saying be
[26:52] merciful
[26:53] let your grace reign in our lives and
[26:57] father we are depending on you to bring
[27:03] us to perfection we give you our will we
[27:07] give you our desires
[27:09] and I will in our desires Lord is to be
[27:12] just like you so Lord we pray tonight
[27:16] have your perfect way in our lives do
[27:20] what is necessary lujah that you might
[27:24] be glorified in this wicked generation
[27:27] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[27:31] you may be seated I told you not long
[27:36] ago that have been working on a thought
[27:38] and that thought is a new bloodline and
[27:44] I I thought about many of the things
[27:49] that I dread concerning blood and you
[27:56] know a lot of times you can't get away
[27:58] from blood except you be born again we
[28:05] know that blood is the life system it is
[28:10] the the thing that runs through your
[28:12] body that keeps you alive without blood
[28:15] you're just dead and you and I must
[28:19] understand that blood is is it's
[28:23] precious in the eyes of God because we
[28:28] realized that it was the shedding of
[28:29] blood that actually got us in this
[28:31] situation that we're in now we've
[28:35] realized a man that Adam's blood was
[28:40] made and created in the beginning by God
[28:43] and there was no contaminants in it
[28:46] there was nothing that could stop him
[28:50] from from living forever except breaking
[28:56] in the word and when he mixed himself
[29:00] the way he did we could say the germ of
[29:04] death entered into Adam and Eve and from
[29:08] that day along we have taken a shape in
[29:11] form of a dead man because the Bible
[29:15] says you know you did why are you living
[29:18] when you live in pleasure and from that
[29:22] time
[29:22] all men began to live in pleasure and
[29:24] they began to love pleasure more than
[29:26] they love God the Bible tells us that
[29:30] death reigned from Adam all the way up
[29:33] to Moses and all the way up into Jesus
[29:35] Christ it was Jesus Christ who broke the
[29:39] chain he was the one that made the
[29:42] difference
[29:43] that's why that his blood could not be
[29:46] part human his blood could not be part
[29:51] of Mary's or Joseph gene the gene genes
[29:56] we realized a man that God himself had
[30:00] to create a blood and the Bible said
[30:03] that blood was the blood of God and
[30:07] because it said it was the blood of God
[30:08] it was being in that God hid himself in
[30:12] those elements that we can see that we
[30:16] call blood there was no power in the
[30:20] color of it but there was a life that
[30:23] was in it
[30:24] they gave the blood of Jesus the power
[30:27] that it is and has now when we know we
[30:32] know by God's grace that Adam made us
[30:35] sinners Bobby said it is appointed for
[30:39] man to die once and after the death
[30:44] judgment but thank God that God made an
[30:49] escape Jesus Christ blood was proven
[30:56] according to brother Branham he got sick
[31:00] and certain things happened to him like
[31:02] it would any ordinary man but you better
[31:06] believe that every time the devil would
[31:08] strike him with something
[31:10] his blood repelled it kicked it out
[31:16] kicked it off there was not one thing
[31:20] that Satan could put on Jesus body that
[31:23] could hold no disease he wasn't afraid
[31:27] of disease he wasn't afraid of leprosy
[31:29] he wasn't afraid of any kind of disease
[31:33] you know epilepsy and all of
[31:35] these things he faced those Devils never
[31:39] one time will you find a devil trying to
[31:44] enter Jesus because he was God that
[31:51] devil knew that he had no place in him
[31:53] is that right because Jesus says I have
[31:57] no darkness in me I love that that
[32:00] thrills me now we must realize by God's
[32:04] grace that according to Revelation that
[32:07] Jesus Christ was the beginning of God's
[32:11] creation or the creation of God that
[32:17] means that means that God found himself
[32:20] a body or created himself about it and
[32:25] this body was not as I said earlier made
[32:29] of part Joseph and part Mary or not even
[32:33] part Mary everything about that body was
[32:36] created by God and what God did he used
[32:41] Mary as the first incubator amen she was
[32:48] ordained as the incubator as a as an
[32:51] instrument to feed that natural body of
[32:56] God but none of Jesus blood had met not
[33:03] one ounce of Mary's blood in it not one
[33:07] ounce of Joseph's blood Oh was God the
[33:16] blood of Jesus a lot of people don't eat
[33:20] retorted enough because somehow they
[33:23] think that the blood has lost its power
[33:27] but here tonight I'm saying the blood
[33:30] could never lose his power we many times
[33:37] thought that blood was like an ointment
[33:44] something they could rub on you and you
[33:47] healed or it would bring healing but
[33:51] that wasn't what the blood was about
[33:54] Jesus came to do what to bring a new
[33:58] kingdom and to bring a new Kingdom
[34:04] people this kingdom people would be a
[34:09] holy people a righteous people a
[34:13] sanctified people this this kingdom
[34:15] would be a people that God Himself would
[34:19] recreate that's what we fail to see we
[34:28] we understand that there is no chemical
[34:31] blood now that we can gather up from
[34:33] from that Jesus dropped on oak every
[34:37] there's nothing and if we had it what
[34:40] good would he do you it would be just
[34:43] like a relic because it wasn't the
[34:46] chemistry that was so important it was
[34:50] the life that was in that chemistry
[34:55] because remember Jesus was a man he
[34:58] could feel he could cry he could hurt he
[35:01] could get tired he had to sleep but the
[35:05] Bible said in him dwelt the fullness of
[35:08] the Godhead bodily he came to deliver
[35:13] something to us you know hear me he came
[35:18] to deliver something to us the world
[35:20] don't know what it's all about
[35:22] you all know that's the truth we always
[35:25] think oh I'm washed in the blood but God
[35:28] just didn't come to wash you washing is
[35:32] part of the process
[35:34] but that's not the finished work we
[35:38] understand that if a person is justified
[35:40] as the example our prophet gave us it's
[35:43] a man walking down the street and he
[35:45] sees a dirty glass he picks up that
[35:46] glass the glass doesn't deserve to be
[35:49] picked up his dirty is filthy but he
[35:52] somehow at Mars and glass oh he likes
[35:54] the glass he picks it up and think oh I
[35:56] can use this well the man doesn't just
[35:59] automatically drinks out of the grass he
[36:03] goes home and he washes the glass that's
[36:08] that's that's just what that's the
[36:09] second stage of his grace his first
[36:11] grace first part of his grace he picked
[36:13] the grant glance up and he justified it
[36:16] the second portion of that is that he
[36:18] sanctified it hallelujah but you know he
[36:21] didn't just bring that glass to his
[36:23] house to decorate his cabinet no he
[36:27] picked it up he admired it he brought it
[36:30] home he washed it and one day he's going
[36:33] to feel it but whatever he wants to feel
[36:38] it with that's the beauty of the glass
[36:39] and every time he could always think
[36:41] about where he found that glass and that
[36:43] glass is so valuable to him and now that
[36:45] he's drinking out of it he's having
[36:47] pleasure and you must understand that
[36:51] God didn't just pick you up out of the
[36:52] muck Amari that's not all to it he
[36:56] didn't just say defy you that's not all
[36:58] to it but there's another thing that God
[37:00] is trying to get to us as believers we
[37:03] don't continue
[37:06] we must not continue our lives living
[37:09] according to our natural birth why
[37:15] because the blood that we had now is no
[37:19] longer a natural blood your hymning and
[37:24] this thing must come by faith because
[37:27] amen I want you to understand in order
[37:29] for us to be like Jesus we must have his
[37:33] blood every Apple
[37:38] whatever it may be uh you know whatever
[37:40] kind of Apple it may be it may be a
[37:42] Grammy or whatever they call him it may
[37:44] be a honey Chris but you know each life
[37:46] in that Apple has different
[37:49] characteristics about it and the blood
[37:52] of Jesus Christ has characteristics the
[37:58] blood of Jesus Christ can can't do
[38:00] anything that life in that blood was not
[38:04] the second or third person that life in
[38:07] the blood was God himself tell me what
[38:12] I'm saying oh my
[38:16] Galatians says in the sixth chapter for
[38:19] in Christ Jesus neither circumcision
[38:20] availeth anything nor uncircumcision but
[38:24] a new creature right oh oh I'm
[38:28] circumcised I'm part of the Jew you know
[38:30] because I'm circumcised on the eighth
[38:32] day that natural stuff don't mean
[38:34] nothing I've been born in a Levitical
[38:36] priesthood that don't mean a thing not
[38:40] today the question is the thing that
[38:44] makes the difference is what he's Jesus
[38:47] said to Nicodemus you must be born again
[38:52] because this birth I'm talking about is
[38:55] far above this natural birth one bird
[39:01] that he said you said he said he said a
[39:04] born of the water and the spirit
[39:06] understand the bird that you have now
[39:09] you came into this world he said that's
[39:11] a fleshly birth but you must have a
[39:14] spiritual birth hallelujah you've heard
[39:20] me say this at times you know when you
[39:23] see somebody you know they they drunk or
[39:26] whatever the case may be it's because
[39:28] they they they're they have become
[39:30] intoxicated with with whether were wine
[39:32] or alcohol whatever they got in them and
[39:34] whatever spirit that skin that chemistry
[39:37] makes you act like it you're no longer
[39:44] yourself you what you're drinking that
[39:46] spirit in and you drank that spirit in
[39:52] and you and that spirit becomes one when
[39:55] people see you drunk they don't see all
[39:57] that old drunken spirit they say he's
[39:59] drunk he's a drunkard you take the name
[40:02] of that spirit who who and you and I
[40:09] must understand that the blood of Jesus
[40:12] Christ is a new line of blood it is a
[40:16] perfect blood that brings a perfect life
[40:19] it is a blood that brings holiness you
[40:23] know here what I'm saying it's like you
[40:26] hear people say well I know I've been
[40:28] changed and the things I used to do I
[40:30] don't do no more the places I used to go
[40:33] I don't go no more the songs are used to
[40:36] sing I don't sing them no more why
[40:38] because the blood transforms you as many
[40:45] as walk according to this rule peace be
[40:47] on to them and mercy upon the Israel of
[40:51] God who and Israel as a prince we're due
[40:57] to the Prince of God when you'll you and
[41:00] I see that brother Brantley said when
[41:03] you come to God really come to God God
[41:05] gives you a blood transfusion I love
[41:09] that and and I looked up blood
[41:11] transfusion it means to the injection of
[41:14] a blood from one person or animal into a
[41:18] bloodstream of another so God inoculates
[41:23] you by placing his blood in you
[41:32] hallelujah
[41:33] as we say I'm a child of the king
[41:38] his royal blood now flows through my
[41:43] veins oh yes oh yes I want the devil to
[41:49] hear this oh yes oh yes I'm a child of
[41:54] the king but because he gave me birth
[42:02] hallelujah Jude says that's what I love
[42:06] this dude under student he had to
[42:09] understand something because he says now
[42:12] unto him that is able to keep you from
[42:14] what falling and to present you
[42:17] faultless before the presence of his
[42:19] glory with exceeding joy you know I
[42:23] preach this myself you know many times I
[42:27] thought well you know you got a really a
[42:28] good knife before God you got a bad God
[42:31] you got a plead with God brother Branham
[42:33] said in the interval you don't have to
[42:35] beg and you don't have to please you
[42:37] don't have to fast you know God requires
[42:40] from you st. everybody back might know
[42:45] how to plea everybody may not know how
[42:47] to beg everybody may not know how to
[42:49] fast but one thing for sure God gives
[42:52] you the faith y'all understand me and I
[42:58] thought to myself I'm gonna correct that
[43:00] thing because I saw something that I've
[43:02] been using ever since I listened to that
[43:04] message I've been just drinking and
[43:06] drinking and drinking and drinking and I
[43:08] over drink so I can push out and when
[43:14] you all the drink and you over drink and
[43:16] you eat that word and take that word in
[43:18] you don't have to worry about it it will
[43:21] work it will do the job for you it is
[43:25] when you don't eat the word is when you
[43:27] don't drink it's what makes you all
[43:30] fruit your understanding it's like a
[43:32] flower that needs water you don't water
[43:36] that flower like it ought to be that
[43:38] flower is going to wither up bro my if
[43:42] you give that flower the proper amount
[43:45] of water it looks healthy and fat
[43:48] greening and nothing you know
[43:52] is the water that made it that way
[43:55] understand it's the water of the world
[43:58] that makes you fat in green but you got
[44:02] to apply this word to your life that's
[44:05] what the prophet of God means laying in
[44:07] the presence of the Sun not s you in s
[44:11] all in lay there eat it every day all
[44:16] day if you can keep it in your ear keep
[44:19] it in your mind as much as possible feed
[44:22] on this bloody word of the Son of Man
[44:25] and guarantee you in a bring new life is
[44:29] that right because the Bible said Jesus
[44:31] said it he said if any man eat a
[44:33] vineyard spread he shall never die
[44:37] hallelujah see that's what it's all
[44:39] about it was faith in the beginning he's
[44:42] got to come back his faith understand
[44:45] that the gift of the Holy Ghost is a
[44:46] gift it's already given to you but the
[44:51] only way you can have it is you've got
[44:52] to accept it just take it by faith and
[44:56] rest on it that's what brings the joy
[44:59] y'all know that it's when you rest on
[45:02] the promises of God that's where the joy
[45:05] comes in oh you made a mistake but I'm
[45:08] resting those promises see what I'm
[45:11] saying God said so hallelujah and that's
[45:15] what you and I must understand this new
[45:17] bloodline literally change your way of
[45:20] thinking hallelujah y'all remember the
[45:25] thought the probably God brought about
[45:29] this old man for bomb that got hit by a
[45:31] car
[45:32] and the ambulance people were talking
[45:34] and they said well we'll just work or do
[45:36] something over here he you know in other
[45:38] words he ain't no good and the old man
[45:41] said I am Jesus blood washed basically
[45:47] hearing of no value I am valuable I
[45:50] don't care I'm a poor fella in a ditch
[45:53] somewhere I am valuable because the
[45:57] blood of Jesus Christ purchased me
[46:02] hallelujah you think about you think
[46:05] about
[46:06] uh-uh Lazarus I think about him I loved
[46:08] Lazarus the one who was at time the rich
[46:10] man table I want to talk to him I really
[46:13] do I just have a desire to talk to him
[46:16] to see how it was and you know what made
[46:18] him keep the faith when he didn't have
[46:21] nothing he kept the faith you know what
[46:22] it was it was the blood he said well the
[46:28] blood of Jesus Christ had not been
[46:29] shared yeah yes it was the blood was
[46:32] shared before the foundation of the
[46:34] world that's why I either everybody when
[46:36] they got grace God was pulling from the
[46:39] beginning a name written on the Lamb's
[46:46] Book of Life is that right think about a
[46:48] Jude God is able so he says now to him
[46:51] that is able to keep you from falling in
[46:54] to present you faultless before the
[46:56] presence of his glory with exceedingly
[46:59] jaw how can God present you faultless
[47:04] it's not your work you and I can't we
[47:07] don't even know what perfection is we
[47:09] were born so faulty in this world
[47:11] everything we do we fall we fall short
[47:16] but the blood of Jesus that's how he
[47:20] present you faultless but placing his
[47:23] life in you and the Bible said we are
[47:27] accepted in the beloved because he
[47:32] injected his blood in you and when we
[47:38] think about his blood we're not talking
[47:40] about that element of red stuff we're
[47:42] talking about life because that's what
[47:46] the Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost is God
[47:50] hallelujah
[47:51] that's why Jesus even said how he raised
[47:54] from the dead he said but ye shall
[47:56] receive power after which the Holy Ghost
[47:59] is come upon you when I was a little boy
[48:03] one of those little cartoons i used to
[48:04] love popeye and need you to have popeye
[48:08] with that can of spinach it would get
[48:09] all beat up and what Brutus or whoever
[48:12] was his name I just call him Pluto but
[48:14] Brit
[48:15] Brutus used to beat him up and throw him
[48:17] down and slap him all around
[48:19] throw a little bit into the wall and
[48:20] somehow his armies distress
[48:23] wherever that can of of spinach was
[48:27] somehow that they find a way of getting
[48:30] to that spinach and cutting that can
[48:32] opening it all my watch out Brutus after
[48:35] he ate that spinach he became super
[48:38] strong hallelujah I think they got that
[48:42] from somewhere hallelujah
[48:44] Oh glory to God but Peter said no today
[48:47] I'm gonna go after which the Holy Ghost
[48:49] is come upon you you shall receive power
[48:52] understand when God gives you the Holy
[48:54] Ghost he's giving you himself
[48:57] God is not a weak God is not weak
[49:01] that's why he said when you say I am
[49:04] weak or when you are weak say that I am
[49:07] strong right why because God is in you
[49:12] hallelujah have you feeling a little
[49:14] beat up you need to go get you some
[49:16] spinach hallelujah peel it all up I
[49:20] guarantee you by the time you finish
[49:22] reading the word many times I didn't
[49:24] even know what to read
[49:25] I said Lord give me a scripture I need
[49:28] something you know I tell him I need
[49:29] some encouragement and he'll lead me
[49:32] right to the world that's gonna
[49:35] encourage me hallelujah is that Alright
[49:38] Oh my cheek what the devil don't he's
[49:43] exposed what the Bible doesn't say is
[49:53] that on the day of Pentecost when those
[49:57] 12 120 received the Holy Ghost it scared
[50:03] the devil to death hallelujah
[50:08] he understood he saw something that he
[50:10] had never through all history seen a
[50:15] hundred and twenty people acting like
[50:18] Jesus of Nazareth doing the same size
[50:21] the same wonders they have the same
[50:23] boldness they had the same fearless and
[50:29] now his kingdom is really through
[50:35] hmm and you and I must understand by
[50:38] God's grace that if you can see the
[50:41] blood of Jesus in you uh uh you know
[50:48] this thought came to me long time ago I
[50:50] believe Keith was telling me something
[50:52] how he got sick and how he rested on the
[50:54] blood of Jesus and you know and I it
[50:56] just in depth it just stuck
[50:58] it's just laid there just that thought
[51:02] but I couldn't I couldn't do nothing
[51:05] with it at the time until now and when
[51:08] you see by God's grace I don't like
[51:10] calling people out but sometimes it's it
[51:12] encourages people you know just like we
[51:15] was out at the Starbucks and God gave me
[51:19] that thought on Resurrection just by the
[51:20] brothers talking several brothers
[51:23] Richard all all y'all I love talking
[51:26] about the word because I get inspired I
[51:30] get inspired thoughts come to me while
[51:33] we're talking about that whew that's
[51:34] sounds good I'm gonna use that one but
[51:43] the devil is exposed if you can really
[51:46] believe that the blood of Jesus Christ
[51:48] is in you you will become a powerhouse
[51:51] it will take away the fear oh I got some
[51:54] days I'm finna read in just a moment in
[52:00] the message prayer line or a prayer line
[52:02] brother brother said you're exposed he's
[52:04] talking to the devil you can't stay here
[52:07] any longer
[52:08] with faith why faith moves everything
[52:13] right you can't stay here any longer why
[52:16] because faith moves everything come out
[52:20] of them in the name of Jesus Christ lead
[52:23] these people they come to carry by faith
[52:27] for a blood transfusion come out in the
[52:33] name of Jesus Christ I pronounced him
[52:36] well now how could he do that that
[52:39] wasn't a man that was God in the man but
[52:42] that wasn't just for brother battle
[52:44] these signs shall follow
[52:47] they should cast out Devils in my name
[52:50] if the blood of Jesus that the Holy
[52:54] Ghost is in you like it was enlarger and
[52:56] it's supposed to be and we are supposed
[52:59] to have a double portion it's not by
[53:05] emotions folks is by faith it's all
[53:09] right to have emotions I love it but
[53:12] with a win-win when you can't muster up
[53:14] any emotions you got to be steadfast in
[53:17] your soul right
[53:20] look what Deuteronomy says thou shalt be
[53:23] perfect with the LORD thy God
[53:27] Deuteronomy 18 13 - I'll be perfect with
[53:33] the LORD thy God hello if Jesus could
[53:37] give birth which he does if he is a
[53:40] perfect man the only thing he could ever
[53:43] produce a perfect child ha because he
[53:48] doesn't mate with anything that's not
[53:53] perfect you say what are you saying
[53:56] that's why he gave you a speed in the
[54:00] beginning and that seed he gave you in
[54:02] your soul is perfect
[54:04] is that right because the Bible said as
[54:07] long as that seer amazing you you cannot
[54:10] sin don't you know that's the only way
[54:15] that a devil can hold to you if you're
[54:18] sick or got an affliction or whether the
[54:20] case maybe if you haven't seen Satan has
[54:23] no right oh we don't care about
[54:27] hereditary Devils hereditary Devils
[54:30] don't mean nothing wants the blood of
[54:31] Jesus come ah because you've got to die
[54:34] before you can get his blood you died to
[54:39] that old generic thing genealogy is what
[54:43] I mean you died to that at least we
[54:46] supposed to look what he says you are
[54:51] standing completely justified as though
[54:55] you never did it in the beginning this
[54:58] is my message to the church
[55:00] I love that you don't read it before but
[55:05] I'm a reader of the game as we go off
[55:07] the air just a minute a minute

[55:12] God's Word and with God's Word every
[55:15] Amen every jot every tittle where you're
[55:19] standing I'm trying to tell you pull
[55:22] away from them shucks and get out here
[55:25] in the wheat where you can get right

[55:32] coming of the combine and you're
[55:33] spending complete justified like you
[55:36] never did it in the first place talking
[55:39] about a Thanksgiving I feel real good
[55:41] I'm more thankful for that they anything
[55:45] I know he goes on to say can y'all
[55:48] believe this now I believe it you see
[55:51] what brother books I make mistake I
[55:52] believe just what he said you pure
[55:57] virtuous sinless bride of the son of the
[56:01] Living God every man and woman that's
[56:05] born of the Spirit of God and washed in
[56:07] the blood of Jesus Christ and believe
[56:10] every word of God stands as though
[56:12] you've never seen at the first plane you
[56:16] are perfect that's the blood of Jesus
[56:23] Christ see we didn't realize what the
[56:25] Holy Ghost we thought the Holy Ghost
[56:28] hey just shouting and dancing I love it
[56:31] all oh God but it came to transform us
[56:34] it came to change us it came to create a
[56:38] new life in us it must do that if it's a
[56:44] genuine Holy Ghost now let me tell you
[56:47] something it will take his time to do
[56:50] what he wants to do a tree don't grow in
[56:53] a day another that neither does a flower
[56:57] come up and bloom in a day y'all hear
[56:58] what I'm saying God uses time he uses
[57:03] storms
[57:04] he used the elements of this world to
[57:07] fashion you guess when he calls it fire
[57:12] oh it is okay it is okay
[57:17] don't y'all realize this thing James
[57:20] said this life is like a vapor it comes
[57:23] out it goes hallelujah
[57:24] is that Alright give me my hard times
[57:28] now that I might live with him eternally
[57:34] the Word of God said the suffering of
[57:36] this world cannot be compared to the
[57:40] things that God has in store for us just
[57:44] you ought to be grateful that God chose
[57:47] you to give his life - sometimes we wear
[57:52] ourselves out serving each other but
[57:55] that's alright brother well said divine
[57:57] life or perfect love a menace is what
[58:00] living living for others it's okay hmm
[58:07] hello it's okay oh hey the probably God
[58:16] said don't you want a blood transfusion
[58:17] for both souls and both body tonight
[58:20] young man I hope y'all don't mind me
[58:25] using this but I mother Connelly hope
[58:28] you don't he I make him a comforter I'm
[58:30] sure I do when I call anybody's name but
[58:33] our soul I went on that day when Joel
[58:37] got sick and he went on the battlefield
[58:39] he just went there and started doing
[58:40] things nobody asked him for the colony
[58:43] he just went there and I'm right I
[58:45] thought about it almost all night I said
[58:48] here was that old man never a senior man
[58:50] he said he never thought about it he
[58:53] just got about his chair and just
[58:55] started working I watched him I didn't
[59:00] have to say what is there somebody in
[59:01] here that would help clean no he
[59:05] immediately why he was ordained
[59:16] a little hard for me and then I'm y'all
[59:25] know how that night was but my point is
[59:28] everybody has a place and everybody
[59:36] knows that each and every one of us can
[59:38] do things that others can't do hmm
[59:44] and you know you look at Sisters Chapel
[59:49] she's a nurse ER I don't know sister
[59:53] whatever she is I couldn't do that
[59:57] honestly I could have the brain to do it
[1:00:00] I could learn it but to do it when I go
[1:00:05] into a hospital I feel something strange
[1:00:07] I do if I see somebody tied down I feel
[1:00:12] like I'm dying something happened to me
[1:00:15] that's why you know just I know I can't
[1:00:17] do it but my son can do it understand me
[1:00:22] now I'm saying this to say all of this
[1:00:25] the Holy Ghost in you and the Holy Ghost
[1:00:29] in me are going to be will perform
[1:00:31] certain things different things right
[1:00:36] some of us may have faith just to speak
[1:00:39] it and it happens some of us have
[1:00:42] certain faith amen say Holy Ghost but
[1:00:45] God just gave you a certain measure you
[1:00:47] just need somebody to lay hands huh it's
[1:00:52] the same Holy Ghost it doesn't mean that
[1:00:54] one is stronger than the other it just
[1:00:56] means one has law a greater portion and
[1:00:59] I don't get jealous of it you understand
[1:01:02] me
[1:01:03] if you gonna run the ball I'm gonna
[1:01:05] block for you but the blood of Jesus
[1:01:10] Christ supposed to make us one family
[1:01:14] one family hallelujah is that Alright
[1:01:19] brother battle tried to explain that he
[1:01:22] said one of his brothers they had blond
[1:01:23] hair one had black hair and one but they
[1:01:25] had all the same hair same blood mmm
[1:01:29] very
[1:01:30] one daddy y'all understand me and the
[1:01:35] blood of Jesus Christ will make you love
[1:01:38] one another that's what John said John
[1:01:41] said I shouldn't have to teach you how
[1:01:42] to love but because God is love how can
[1:01:46] the love of God be on our hearts that
[1:01:49] God was telling my wife today I think I
[1:01:50] was talking to her I think I love gifts
[1:01:53] but that's just a small portion ask a
[1:02:01] child you know what they would probably
[1:02:03] want time fellowship come on hello
[1:02:09] that's what expresses love when you
[1:02:12] finish it when there is time given I was
[1:02:17] telling the brother here I said you know
[1:02:19] people nowadays and don't like making
[1:02:22] sacrifices hello
[1:02:26] we were so in this little thing and we
[1:02:29] supposed to have so much love but where
[1:02:31] is the sacrifice to fellowship with one
[1:02:34] another
[1:02:36] no come on somebody I'm talking about
[1:02:40] the bloodline that was one thing that
[1:02:42] Jesus was allowed to do and that was the
[1:02:44] fellowship with his disciples wherever
[1:02:47] he went they went there were time he had
[1:02:49] to get away but he loved that fellowship
[1:02:52] he was that right is that what brother
[1:02:57] Branham said he said even at the
[1:02:58] resurrection God will allow the saints
[1:03:01] of God to raise 30 to 40 days so that we
[1:03:04] can fellowship with one another before
[1:03:06] the resurrection before they're sent you
[1:03:10] hmm hello somebody
[1:03:16] you know how fellowship with some of
[1:03:18] y'all but I'm gonna tell you something I
[1:03:19] would grade this church close to an F
[1:03:21] when it comes to fellowship if I had to
[1:03:24] grade the whole church you're gonna love
[1:03:28] me in because we don't do enough of it
[1:03:33] ah I didn't mean to go there but I'm
[1:03:37] there I'm there that's what the blood
[1:03:39] makes you do right that's what the blood
[1:03:43] you do hallelujah you accept him as your
[1:03:48] Savior right now I believe you're
[1:03:49] standing in in his presence he said
[1:03:52] first of all don't you want a blood
[1:03:53] transfusion
[1:03:55] for both your soul and body tonight I'm
[1:04:01] free to come to something here because
[1:04:03] if you understand the blood that runs
[1:04:06] through your vein right now is
[1:04:08] invincible I don't care what the what
[1:04:13] the doctors give you like for existence
[1:04:19] they run something but you got a cancer
[1:04:21] what you talking about if the blood of
[1:04:23] Jesus is running through me that cancer
[1:04:26] has to go I'm gonna be some in just a
[1:04:30] minute
[1:04:30] you know I don't want any of the others
[1:04:32] think that I was an appreciative of all
[1:04:34] the gifts that y'all gave me the money
[1:04:35] and all that I thank God and that's not
[1:04:37] what I was talking about because most of
[1:04:40] you who gave me things we fellowship but
[1:04:43] I think this fellowship with the pastor
[1:04:45] is with others and you know and I say
[1:04:50] that I don't know what hold those got me
[1:04:52] going back to that but my point is we
[1:04:54] are one body and the scripture says that
[1:04:57] they will know you are Christians
[1:05:02] because of the love that you have one
[1:05:05] for the other
[1:05:12] Judah oh he goes on as he says listen
[1:05:17] you accept him and testified to those
[1:05:20] people that you now accept Christ as
[1:05:22] your Savior taking asking for mercy
[1:05:24] raise your hand and turn to the people
[1:05:26] come here
[1:05:27] dawn Jesus would give him a very
[1:05:29] transparent rent a trespass every sin
[1:05:32] god I pray that you heal the boy and
[1:05:35] make may he go out here and live a
[1:05:38] normal life be perfectly well forgive
[1:05:40] every sin and take him into the king of
[1:05:43] tonight in G it was so simple you know
[1:05:48] there was no dramatics behind it it was
[1:05:50] simple it wasn't all of the Hollywoods
[1:05:53] stuff that comes with it just simple
[1:05:57] that's how God works then alright
[1:06:00] psalms v 169 says behold desired to
[1:06:05] Theni in the parts and in the hidden
[1:06:07] part thou shalt make me to know wisdom
[1:06:11] purge me with hyssop and I shall be
[1:06:16] clean wash me and I shall be whiter than
[1:06:20] snow make me to hear joy and gladness
[1:06:23] that the bones which thou has broken may
[1:06:27] rejoice hard I faced high I faced from
[1:06:32] Steve and blot out all my iniquities
[1:06:36] created me a clean heart O God and renew
[1:06:40] a right spirit within me
[1:06:42] is that right the Prophet said listen to
[1:06:45] quip look how that God comes along and
[1:06:49] he gives you a new spirit and people
[1:06:51] think they got the Holy Spirit that new
[1:06:54] spirit is to give you enough grace to
[1:06:56] deal with your own self and to be able
[1:06:59] to hear the word hallelujah but that new
[1:07:01] spirit is just there so barking for his
[1:07:04] news his spirit in your new spirit must
[1:07:09] bring a change his Spirit will bring the
[1:07:12] pain
[1:07:12] a major she's not just an outward change
[1:07:14] or whatever and you'll know you know you
[1:07:17] know I know and you know that we are the
[1:07:20] elected and chosen by God so why don't
[1:07:23] we just move forward let's move forward
[1:07:27] I told you you don't have to beg him
[1:07:30] just ask him believe it when you ask him
[1:07:33] and move forward you don't have to feel
[1:07:36] the cheers you don't have to be on the
[1:07:38] wind no sir
[1:07:39] you just take his word by faith and move
[1:07:42] on don't look at the outside you may be
[1:07:45] faulty until Jesus come but one thing he
[1:07:48] said I will complete that which I have
[1:07:52] begun in you the blood will bring you to
[1:07:55] perfection you say what do you mean I'm
[1:07:58] telling you the Old Testament Saints die
[1:08:00] with the Holy Ghost only a bones
[1:08:03] hallelula and only they had law yet
[1:08:08] because of the grace of God without rest
[1:08:17] that's all I want
[1:08:19] if I should die go my gravelord sleep
[1:08:21] with me that makes sense
[1:08:24] rest on my bones those would be the
[1:08:29] happiest bones there in the grave I'm
[1:08:30] telling you that now whoo cast me not
[1:08:36] away from that present take not the Holy
[1:08:39] Spirit from me restore unto me the joy
[1:08:43] of that salvation and uphold me with thy
[1:08:46] free spirit
[1:08:47] whoo clean hot hallelujah
[1:08:52] not just clean me long but feel me I
[1:08:57] really out side of her neck
[1:09:01] you know God don't really want you know
[1:09:03] how can I say but I want to be I don't
[1:09:05] care people call me a fanatics but I
[1:09:07] need I need I need an ester jaw that
[1:09:12] where I am I'm gonna talk about Jesus I
[1:09:14] mean just not I'm not talking about that
[1:09:18] you know we do know I'm um just
[1:09:22] sometimes you you know we talking about
[1:09:23] the Lord you go you know we said oh did
[1:09:26] you see so and so on so don't let's say
[1:09:28] that like that seem like the volume drop
[1:09:33] you ever paid any attention to that you
[1:09:36] know what that is that's the spirit of
[1:09:37] shame or fear cuz we can talk about the
[1:09:42] Catholic Church all we want to hear loud
[1:09:45] and when we get to the restaurant you
[1:09:47] know those you know why because they
[1:09:51] fear the some Catholics will beat you
[1:09:54] some Baptists in some Pentecostals it's
[1:09:58] a message people will to y'all say why
[1:10:03] y'all pick on the Catholic Church and I
[1:10:05] don't pick just on the Catholic Church
[1:10:06] I've pickled her daughters too and you
[1:10:09] could be sitting right up in here and be
[1:10:10] a part of that steel because that's a
[1:10:14] system it's a spirit
[1:10:15] oh come on somebody
[1:10:21] because you go to a message church don't
[1:10:23] make you message honestly I sometimes
[1:10:27] hate using that term message Church
[1:10:29] because it almost sound denominational
[1:10:33] but we are the body of Christ and I'm
[1:10:39] telling you if you've been ordained to
[1:10:41] be a lickle you'll never be a dollar
[1:10:47] you'll never be a 50-cent you are nickel

[1:10:59] don't believe we've got nickels and
[1:11:01] dimes in here I don't believe it I'm
[1:11:04] just everybody the dollar it's okay with
[1:11:13] this just give me a few more minutes and
[1:11:15] I'll give them one heart hello
[1:11:21] that's a Zeki 11 and I would give them
[1:11:25] one heart them one heart you understand
[1:11:32] in other words you don't have a place
[1:11:34] your heart I don't have a place for my
[1:11:38] heart my heart was corrupt evil evil
[1:11:42] imaginations always flew would flow
[1:11:45] through my heart
[1:11:46] wicked I don't need my heart I need here
[1:11:49] I need a new one and if you put his
[1:11:53] spirit in your heart yoga heart becomes
[1:11:55] his heart he sets on the throne of your
[1:12:00] heart he rules he was not only your
[1:12:03] heart but you're here too now that's the
[1:12:05] power of the blood a lot of time the
[1:12:09] people think well the power the blood is
[1:12:11] here bar they just come to hear you
[1:12:13] counseling in and all that God came to
[1:12:17] give your Holy Ghost his life in you as
[1:12:20] I said a brain about a new generation oh
[1:12:24] come on somebody I said here eg he came
[1:12:31] to give himself a new generation
[1:12:35] hello his generation was he began what
[1:12:39] was it he was the beginning of the
[1:12:41] creation of God the beginning of the ph
[1:12:46] Staubach so where God is creating now
[1:12:49] this top in ooh yummy Oh father I would
[1:13:01] they said in my throne and I've said in
[1:13:05] your throne do you think there's a chair
[1:13:07] up there for all of us the steam it is a
[1:13:09] position it is the place only God and
[1:13:14] God's children in that throne hello
[1:13:21] God has given him a name which is above
[1:13:23] every name that at the name of Jesus
[1:13:26] Christ every Egypt bow and every tongue
[1:13:31] hallelujah and the same position God
[1:13:34] exalted him to God is exposing us to
[1:13:39] Paulina because he's giving it to us we
[1:13:43] don't deserve it we don't we didn't
[1:13:45] honored it was gone the chicken his life
[1:13:48] into us you don't believe that huh I'll
[1:13:55] tell you what when it comes down to the
[1:13:57] dust who'll be there the king and queen
[1:14:01] we will judge the whole world and Isaiah
[1:14:06] said even be nowhere forget you shall
[1:14:10] prosper I don't care if the devil comes
[1:14:13] with a list that long time he finishes
[1:14:16] unrolling it with fine blunt paper why
[1:14:20] because the blood of Jesus Christ is
[1:14:23] gonna wash every bit of it away no
[1:14:26] charge he said they do not know that he
[1:14:31] became the jury he became the judge he
[1:14:34] became the attorney and they found your
[1:14:36] case dismissed
[1:14:37] there was no charge against you being
[1:14:42] attached to you
[1:14:51] that they walk among statute and artists
[1:14:55] and do them and they shall be my people
[1:14:58] and I will be their God but as far as
[1:15:02] you see what was happening right
[1:15:05] you see the changing of the time you see
[1:15:06] the change in the position now it down
[1:15:09] Satan was the ruler of this world he's
[1:15:11] ruling everybody except God's people
[1:15:16] even now but we leave the only place bad
[1:15:21] will be will be in the Jews he would be
[1:15:26] when Satan is ruling this earth God will
[1:15:30] be here too but he'd be ruling the Jews
[1:15:33] there'll be the holy people because the
[1:15:36] Gentiles have turned it down
[1:15:38] [Music]
[1:15:42] God will never let Satan rule Israel and
[1:15:46] God will never let C rule you absolutely
[1:15:53] not
[1:15:54] but as whose heart walking at the heart
[1:15:58] of the detestable things and their
[1:16:00] abomination our way I can pinch their
[1:16:02] way upon their own hands said the Lord
[1:16:04] God let me taste them the only way you
[1:16:06] can live what I'm preaching is that you
[1:16:08] get the Holy Ghost
[1:16:09] you get guarding you and keep eating huh
[1:16:13] I have struggles I have problems but I
[1:16:16] see God moving moving them how to okay
[1:16:20] why because I'm keep I'm not I'm not
[1:16:22] trying them oh I'm just gonna eat let
[1:16:28] him bring the chain let him transform me
[1:16:31] and he devoted people I'm telling you he
[1:16:34] is doing it you said brothers everything
[1:16:38] I know I the God of the apartment nobody
[1:16:45] can take what he's giving away from me
[1:16:46] like they say came about if you live by
[1:16:49] Jesus don't that make you feel good
[1:16:54] you don't made all kind of
[1:17:04] you
[1:18:24] Israel he's ugly oh I'm gonna read this
[1:18:28] again so you get excited I then will I
[1:18:33] sprinkle clean water upon you and ye
[1:18:36] shall be clean from all your filthiness
[1:18:39] from all your idols will I cleanse you
[1:18:43] the water represents the spirit it is
[1:18:46] the Holy Spirit it is the anointing that
[1:18:49] destroyed the Oaks hallelujah not by my
[1:18:54] power not by might but by my spirit said
[1:18:57] Lord
[1:18:58] that's always a stop doing
[1:19:04] something
[1:19:05] there's the power that other than my
[1:19:08] love but when God does it he kills it he
[1:19:13] goes right to the root of it chop it
[1:19:15] down so it won't ever come back up again
[1:19:19] is that right when God got rid of Peters
[1:19:23] temper you never saw a spring up again
[1:19:28] he was the one right now buzz answer
[1:19:31] your faith virtue who he knew what it
[1:19:34] meant that could become in the statue in
[1:19:37] the image of God he knew he's so simple
[1:19:41] it's hard really it's really hard for us
[1:19:44] to comprehend it sometime but when you
[1:19:47] take a tree that tree just stands there
[1:19:49] y'all heard me say everything that that
[1:19:51] tree is supposed to be will be brought
[1:19:54] to a flirtation or manifestation by the
[1:19:56] weather and everything it goes through
[1:19:59] it needs to lightning because sometime
[1:20:02] the limbs get too big and the lightening
[1:20:04] need to come down and prune a little bit
[1:20:05] right
[1:20:07] it needs the wind the air it needs all
[1:20:10] of those things and that's why God said
[1:20:12] from now on you're gonna have four
[1:20:13] seasons I wish we could understand that
[1:20:15] a lot of time we think well we got four
[1:20:17] seasons I'm telling you what after you
[1:20:19] realize amen that you got the Holy Ghost
[1:20:21] as your warmth and your comforter you
[1:20:23] can be warm in the winter time you don't
[1:20:28] have to be cold in the wintertime if
[1:20:31] that tree finds a way to stay warm in
[1:20:34] the wintertime
[1:20:38] hallelujah what does that tree do go
[1:20:40] back to his roots
[1:20:41] hey somebody and once if you and I can
[1:20:44] go back to our roots I came from God I'd
[1:20:47] go back to God hallelujah I am
[1:20:49] invincible
[1:20:53] nothing could stop the mighty salvation
[1:20:56] of God hmm you think about it yeah you
[1:21:02] know you look at this thing look at all
[1:21:04] the prophecies God said men would be
[1:21:07] running to and fro increase with
[1:21:10] knowledge all these things you know what
[1:21:12] I'm saying and you think about how how
[1:21:16] powerful God is that he actually allowed
[1:21:18] men of science to develop certain things
[1:21:21] that would create the very atmosphere in
[1:21:23] the very scene the butchy but he saw the
[1:21:26] scene before the scene got here he saw
[1:21:31] every man he saw Big Ben Franklin and
[1:21:33] Ford and all of those who created all
[1:21:35] this stuff and he saw that they were all
[1:21:38] day to it if we could only understand I
[1:21:46] wish I look around to see all the faces
[1:21:47] that we got in it and all a different
[1:21:49] characteristic death characteristically
[1:21:52] enough faces it you know and
[1:21:55] just died but compared to the billions
[1:21:58] of people in this world and God hears
[1:22:00] every voice y'all I'm telling you this
[1:22:07] is the problem a lot of people think
[1:22:10] they have already mated potentially we
[1:22:17] have and we will but we need acknowledge
[1:22:22] I don't think God appreciate us being
[1:22:26] dilatory and just laying back well he's
[1:22:29] gonna do it Oh No Oh hallelujah
[1:22:33] you gonna do something better than said
[1:22:36] garden gonna just pull you through no
[1:22:38] home
[1:22:38] that doesn't make salvation fun but
[1:22:43] makes our babies in front if I say fun I
[1:22:45] don't know whether that's the right word
[1:22:46] or not durable enjoyable thing God tells
[1:22:51] you to do something you do it and you
[1:22:53] get this big result
[1:22:58] that's what's so mighty to me do things
[1:23:01] you don't even know what you get ready
[1:23:03] to get into hallelujah but once she
[1:23:06] bring you in are you - oh my God look at
[1:23:09] all this is all right he said do you
[1:23:14] believe now I'm jumping let me go she
[1:23:17] caught ya understand you can't have a
[1:23:21] full berth with just water you have to
[1:23:26] have water blood and spirit that
[1:23:28] constitutes a true birth that right
[1:23:31] justification sanctification baptism it
[1:23:33] only goes and you see what I will know I
[1:23:37] got it because your desires will change
[1:23:40] that's how you know I said your desires
[1:23:43] will change and your desires will always
[1:23:51] be to desire what God wants you to
[1:23:53] desire it doesn't mean the devil ain't
[1:23:58] gonna fight you with bad thoughts but if
[1:24:00] you've got a nice our new creature while

[1:30:32] bad as we call ourselves to bride for
[1:30:35] the uniting time of the bride the church
[1:30:38] is so coming together is to create just
[1:30:42] love among us that we
[1:30:48] could hardly be away from one another oh
[1:30:54] that's right
[1:30:56] when you just you don't have to beg
[1:30:58] people to pray you don't have to beg
[1:31:02] them to worship God you don't have to

[1:31:09] there's nothing else
[1:31:17] mmm there's something so you understand
[1:31:23] and I'm gonna close on those thoughts if

[1:31:34] nearer to it well this is how you get
[1:31:37] nearer he eats only you easy

[1:31:46] I'm gonna be so near to you I'll be in
[1:31:48] you you can't get closer than that where
[1:31:54] you and the Holy Ghost has become one
[1:31:57] having the same power and most of all
[1:32:01] people you know we must understand this
[1:32:04] thing because Paul said everything gonna
[1:32:06] fail
[1:32:07] tongues and prophecies you know
[1:32:10] questions just showing you how it how
[1:32:12] does the thing break down at the end and
[1:32:14] the only thing that will survive the
[1:32:17] test is divine love
[1:32:23] so no matter what you think no matter
[1:32:26] what you look at I was I was uh that's
[1:32:30] my wife about a friend of mine you're
[1:32:31] talking on some things it time you guys
[1:32:34] you just got a little deserving and
[1:32:36] people who are Cana they don't
[1:32:37] understand your statements you know and
[1:32:39] so when you think he's right he raises
[1:32:42] his voice woo
[1:32:44] you're right so I told my wife I said
[1:32:49] the next time raise what his boss he
[1:32:51] gonna be surprised you know because one
[1:32:55] thing for certain how can I
[1:33:00] you tried to woo people you tried to
[1:33:03] help people and I can't open your ears
[1:33:06] neither can I open your heart I wish
[1:33:10] everybody saw to use hospital you see
[1:33:12] you now I wish everybody in here saw it
[1:33:15] in the same light but we don't and you
[1:33:19] know the thing about it is I can't do
[1:33:22] anything about it the only thing I can
[1:33:24] do is preach the word to you it goes
[1:33:28] back to your will and why people are
[1:33:34] afraid they could see it right in the
[1:33:36] word I don't understand it and they
[1:33:38] still do whatever they want to do when
[1:33:42] we have an advocate when we have
[1:33:44] somebody who we can call on the Bible
[1:33:47] said we have not high priests that
[1:33:48] cannot be touched by the feeling about
[1:33:52] Jesus they never suffer this you know
[1:33:55] what he suffered many things he had to
[1:33:57] go through that are not written there in
[1:33:59] the book but I guarantee you nothing
[1:34:01] that you're going through he's not aware
[1:34:03] of and cannot confort you is that right
[1:34:07] because the Bible said he's a comforter
[1:34:09] it's a car you he can he can count
[1:34:12] leaking he could bring you into a place
[1:34:14] he can hold you he can do whatever you
[1:34:16] need him to do but you gotta talk to him
[1:34:18] it's like people people assume pain I'm
[1:34:23] like I'm a reed nobody mine talk to me
[1:34:28] right you got to talk that God can read
[1:34:32] your mind if you want to look at it that
[1:34:34] way but God loves for you to talk talk
[1:34:38] to me tell me he said you have not
[1:34:40] because you ask not and when the blood
[1:34:44] of Jesus Christ runs through your veins
[1:34:46] you are a new creature I don't care what
[1:34:48] you work you could have been blind
[1:34:50] thirty is not you see when you see you
[1:34:53] don't say you're blind no more because
[1:34:56] you can see and when you healed and
[1:34:58] delivered it meant from the season all
[1:35:00] the effects of seeing you must realize
[1:35:03] I'm free and when you free the box it's
[1:35:06] free free indeed I like that word indeed
[1:35:11] best an
[1:35:14] that bloodline is a new bloodline is
[1:35:19] adding Alan's burlock
[1:35:21] it's Jesus crisis bloodline you think
[1:35:27] about all those royal families over
[1:35:29] there and they've done all they can do
[1:35:32] throughout the years to keep the
[1:35:34] bloodline pure and all that time they
[1:35:46] spinning trying to keep the bloodline
[1:35:48] pure they all dying it's still people
[1:35:53] yet they still dying
[1:35:54] they still growing old you know the
[1:35:57] Malayan what is it about their blood
[1:35:58] that's different from anybody else some
[1:36:03] hierarchy somebody's made up but it's
[1:36:08] it's a shadow type of the real thing
[1:36:11] there is draw your blood there is a
[1:36:15] royal people and God injects us with His
[1:36:20] Holy Spirit
[1:36:21] it gives us his blood and therefore
[1:36:23] there's no failure in God but you gotta
[1:36:27] believe it this way is a way of faith
[1:36:29] feel as though I didn't feel God yes
[1:36:33] when you land on your back and you in
[1:36:36] pain
[1:36:36] you don't feel God but that word still
[1:36:43] don't feel him if you call on him right
[1:36:47] out the brother was telling me how his
[1:36:50] brother inside his son had that bad flu
[1:36:54] couldn't even hardly get out of the be
[1:36:56] said well I'm gonna go and preach anyhow
[1:36:58] all of a sudden something happens and I
[1:37:01] put miraculously in to preach the preach
[1:37:04] it brief had a good time but when he
[1:37:07] came out of that pool see but if he had
[1:37:17] only known the blood he could have held
[1:37:21] see I didn't know it lobbie see
[1:37:24] many times coming in here and also God
[1:37:25] just do something to me and then when I
[1:37:27] leave out here I'm like Oh see but that
[1:37:30] same anointing that made me feel good
[1:37:32] temporarily was there to stay if I
[1:37:35] wanted it to if I only understood it was
[1:37:39] that life in me that made me feel that
[1:37:41] way not life outside than like inside oh
[1:37:51] yeah oh yeah I'm a child of the king
[1:38:00] he's raw now flow through my be now can
[1:38:16] sing praise God praise God I'm a child
[1:38:23] of the king
[1:38:26] oh yes oh yes I'm a child of the king
[1:38:35] he's royal blood
[1:38:39] now flow through and
[1:38:49] Oh God
