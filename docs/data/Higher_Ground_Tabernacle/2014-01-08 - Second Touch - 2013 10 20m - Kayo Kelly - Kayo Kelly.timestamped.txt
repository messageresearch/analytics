[33:25] you he says uh David he said he said as
[33:28] the deer God bless you brother and you
[33:31] said you know brother bradam spoke about
[33:33] it many times of a deer is an animal
[33:35] that once is wounded he said if he can
[33:38] only find a little bit of water if he
[33:40] can only find something he says to just
[33:42] cure The Thirst and you see this morning
[33:45] if you came here this morning he says oh
[33:48] I see he said oh it must be the brother
[33:50] he said from Congo he said we I used to
[33:52] be in Atlanta church we had Ghana
[33:53] Nigeria Congo but I believe when the
[33:55] spirit Falls there's only one body it's
[33:58] only one rejoicing and he say when a
[34:00] deer is thirsty the deer rejoices
[34:03] because it knows that his life is
[34:05] dependent upon the Water so I just ask
[34:07] you tonight have you come this morning
[34:09] have you come to a place that you're so
[34:11] thirsty this morning that he says you
[34:14] said that you came to see God he said
[34:16] maybe your neighbor didn't come to see
[34:18] God but you came in Great Expectations
[34:21] sister Angie because you know that your
[34:23] life depends on if you can get a drink
[34:26] brother Lord I ask you before we get
[34:28] into the word I ask you brother you say
[34:31] if water your body is made up of more
[34:33] water than anything it's more ele any
[34:35] element of the world is water amen and
[34:37] you know when you look at how water is
[34:39] split out it's the most explosive thing
[34:42] oxygen and hydrogen on the face of the
[34:43] earth now when the spirit of God moves
[34:47] over the seed that he put in you before
[34:49] the foundation of the world you might
[34:51] clap your hands you might say thank you
[34:55] God you might you right but I tell you
[34:58] as a seed of God I tell you you will
[35:02] because you know that the refreshing is
[35:03] only coming from him amen so I I I I
[35:06] just before we get into the word this
[35:09] morning I just want to tell you what did
[35:11] you come to expect to see this morning
[35:14] what's your expectation this morning and
[35:16] you see your expectation means
[35:18] everything to God right think about that
[35:22] depending on where you're sitting right
[35:24] now you're either in Heavenly places or
[35:26] you're not amen
[35:28] so you got to think that means you have
[35:29] a spiritual mind or a carnal mind but he
[35:33] says now God says he hates that mind
[35:35] that's caral this morning right and
[35:37] it'll bring death to your body right but
[35:40] if we could just step up a little higher
[35:41] this morning hallah and you can just
[35:44] tell but it's a little higher then now
[35:46] you can see he said the glory of God and
[35:49] you see that's why David when he spoke
[35:51] he said in Psalm let the redeem 136 he
[35:53] said let them say so amen so it had to
[35:57] be a people on the earth that knew that
[35:59] they were Redeemed by God and they
[36:02] weren't waiting to get to heaven because
[36:04] if you see if you don't praise God you
[36:06] see we ain't started service yet but you
[36:08] see if you don't praise God now you
[36:11] won't even Praise Him in the grave if
[36:13] you don't praise God now you won't
[36:15] Praise Him in heaven because the Bible
[36:17] says around the throne the 24 Elders he
[36:20] said they were worshiping God and they
[36:22] said they took off their throne and they
[36:24] said they came down and said amen amen
[36:26] they said blessed and glory and then he
[36:29] says why give honor Thanksgiving he's
[36:31] worthy this morning so in order to get
[36:34] in Heavenly places you have to know by
[36:36] the word where you're standing right now
[36:38] this morning and that's why I ask you
[36:40] this morning you see I can tell you see
[36:42] there's still a cloud over here and you
[36:44] see see the cloud we go oh Lord God
[36:47] thank you Jesus and you see when the
[36:49] cloud is there the cloud has to be
[36:51] removed in order for you get your
[36:54] blessing oh help me Lord God but you see
[36:57] here but you see remember you see
[36:59] brother Brandon was speaking and he say
[37:01] he says we have to break through all the
[37:03] sound barriers of what unbelief so that
[37:06] means in order for us to come together
[37:08] and see God we must come in unity he
[37:12] said we got to come to a place that
[37:13] every heart and mind is in one place
[37:16] this morning now let me just read this
[37:18] scripture to you let me the Lord help me
[37:20] let me read this scripture to you and
[37:21] you see before we get into the word you
[37:24] say God will come and and he know he
[37:26] knows what you need amen so let me just
[37:29] read this to you uh um turn with me 1
[37:33] Peter
[37:34] 5 and sometime you know the lord always
[37:37] take you different ways but I just want
[37:39] to just read just maybe two or three
[37:41] scriptures before we get into the word
[37:43] and I want you to look at First Peter 5
[37:46] before we
[37:47] pray now look at this scripture he says
[37:50] in verse 6 humble yourselves therefore
[37:54] under the mighty hand of God so this
[37:58] morning we have to first recognize who
[38:00] hand we're under amen we have to
[38:03] recognize now remember the Bible says
[38:04] heaven and is strong strong and he said
[38:06] Earth Is His foottoo so we have to know
[38:09] where we're at we're under God's feet
[38:11] this morning now you say all everything
[38:13] being above us here he come brother
[38:15] Keith and now he tells us just humble
[38:18] ourselves am amen now humble ourselves
[38:21] mean first take off all your thoughts
[38:24] all your ideas and start thinking about
[38:27] him amen he said now this is humility
[38:29] now and then he says he says that he may
[38:33] exalt your
[38:35] neighbor he said that he may exalt the
[38:38] pastor that he may exalt you Brother
[38:40] Richard he said no no he said that he
[38:42] may exalt you brother keth that means me
[38:46] the individual amen so now this morning
[38:49] God wants to exalt you but let us first
[38:51] come humbly before his Stone now what do
[38:54] I what you mean Brother Kyle I mean when
[38:56] you came those doors do you know who is
[38:59] keeping your heart

[39:14] to give you money to put gas in the
[39:16] Tank come on somebody and then he
[39:19] allowed you to come here and then walk
[39:21] all the way through the doors and that's
[39:23] what the brother said he said you enter
[39:24] into his courts with Thanksgiving amen
[39:27] amen so now remember we're still talking
[39:29] about being in Heavenly places in Christ
[39:31] this morning so now let's keep reading
[39:34] now he says in verse S he says if you
[39:36] don't get nothing else today he says
[39:39] casting all your care upon Him amen for
[39:43] why for he car for you the individual
[39:47] this morning now I got to read this to

[46:49] you in Jesus Christ name we pray Lord we
[46:52] say amen amen won't make make you stand
[46:56] as you just take your seats this morning
[46:58] I was saying it's an honor to be back in
[47:01] the house of the Lord here in the
[47:03] beautiful state of Iowa amen and uh I
[47:06] say you know brother bramy speak so many
[47:08] times how it's a big thing I tell about
[47:10] Brooks said for a pastor to give up his
[47:12] pull pit and I say to stand here I said
[47:15] uh I said I'm I feel like I'm definitely
[47:17] the least of many of you so I'm just
[47:20] here by his
[47:22] grace I want to read something to you
[47:24] before we get started and uh my arm in
[47:27] this and said I want to read something
[47:28] to you before we get started and I want
[47:30] you to look at this and I say man like
[47:34] Lord maybe this is why he puts things
[47:38] together way he does he said it is I Be
[47:41] not
[47:42] Afraid let me read something to
[47:44] you right this night while we're sitting
[47:49] here if he said and this is this say
[47:51] same thing this morning if this right
[47:54] atmosphere would take place this entire
[47:57] group would be refilled with the Holy
[48:00] Ghost amen he said every sick person
[48:03] would be made
[48:04] well it's the atmosphere that does
[48:07] [Laughter]
[48:10] it now now look at let me just keep
[48:12] reading let help me you can take a hen a
[48:15] hen egg and put it in an incubator and
[48:18] keep the atmosphere just right and it'll
[48:20] hatch out a chicken not an incubator C
[48:25] because it's the ACT atmosphere that
[48:28] counts put a chicken egg under a dog
[48:32] it'll hatch a chicken it's the
[48:36] atmosphere and that's what it takes in
[48:38] the church today amen it it not so much
[48:42] starchy Creed and theology it says but
[48:45] the spirit of the Living God pouring
[48:48] down upon his people to bring a
[48:51] spiritual atmosphere amen not one saying
[48:55] I believe it's this
[48:57] and another one I believe is that it's
[49:01] hard for the Holy Spirit to work now
[49:03] look at that now he says and do you know
[49:06] when the Holy Spirit first came it was
[49:08] on the day of Pentecost and when they
[49:10] were all in one place and one Accord And
[49:13] Then There came from Heaven a sound like
[49:15] a rushing Mighty Wind and they had to
[49:17] get the atmosphere right amen now turn
[49:21] with me to Revelations 3 I want y'all to
[49:23] look at it this
[49:24] morning many people are going through
[49:27] the motions when it comes to going to
[49:29] church they're coming to church because
[49:31] it's a ritual they come to church
[49:34] because it's a good thing to do they
[49:36] come to church because you know maybe
[49:38] I'll go to heaven if I come to church
[49:41] but when you come into the presence of
[49:44] God hallelujah you have to realize that
[49:46] God wants to touch
[49:48] you and you see in this hour as we're
[49:50] going to read there's many people that
[49:52] have not been touched by the Lord so
[49:55] that's why you see many churches I go to
[49:57] the jail I tell you I matter fact I tell
[49:59] you a little bit about it you see people
[50:01] that they say they love God but they're
[50:04] not rejoicing in what they say they have
[50:06] amen now I ask you this morning if you
[50:09] say you love God Amen then where is your
[50:12] rejoicing where is it that you know what
[50:15] God did for you he didn't have to do
[50:18] amen where is it that now from you from
[50:20] the bottom of your heart if you can tell
[50:22] me that God did something for you then
[50:25] why can't you give him anything back am
[50:27] now I'm going ask you this now because
[50:29] you see God is no like there's no one
[50:31] like him and the only thing that you get
[50:34] so coose is just to be in his presence
[50:37] is when now that Holy Spirit drops into
[50:39] an individual and when he drops into an
[50:41] individual is God trying to pull you to
[50:44] a place to show you how perfect he sees
[50:47] you now I'm speaking now to that person
[50:49] that says they love God yeah but I ask
[50:52] you sometime why does it seem like it's
[50:54] so hard for people in this house
[50:57] he say what is the spirit on the land
[50:59] that's now is hovering over the people
[51:01] yeah and people are more concerned about
[51:04] money yes they're more concerned about
[51:06] their job they're more you as a person
[51:09] you say well you know Brother Kyle you
[51:11] know hey I tell you what we got church
[51:13] on Wednesday night I don't know if I can
[51:15] beat it I need to
[51:17] overtime but you had a choice to work on
[51:20] THS yeah well you know what I tell you
[51:23] well I just go ahead and miss church CU
[51:24] you know everything will be all right
[51:26] yeah
[51:27] and you ask but it shows that you don't
[51:29] believe your presence is
[51:31] important now think about this now yes
[51:34] sir this room is at a certain
[51:36] temperature right now because of all the
[51:38] bodies in here and everybody in here is
[51:41] putting out about 98 Degrees of heat so
[51:44] it'll get a little hot in here but it
[51:47] may get cold if you won't get into the
[51:50] service you see I was telling somebody I
[51:52] was telling the church in Atlanta and
[51:54] this is a church I was telling you we
[51:55] had a lot of Africans I tell the brother
[51:57] said we go to church I said you know
[51:59] I've seen the people we get dancing in
[52:01] the a we get to having a good time oh
[52:05] there's no one There's No One Like Jesus
[52:09] there's no one and I as I said but why
[52:12] is it so hard to say when everybody
[52:13] comes over here that nobody gets into
[52:15] the service because you get that
[52:17] American Spirit oh Lord I don't know why
[52:20] this ain't my P and this American Spirit
[52:22] ain't no good it's not the Holy Spirit
[52:26] and I want to tell you about this
[52:27] morning is the Holy Spirit and you see
[52:30] when he comes he gives you a reason to
[52:32] Rejoice he gives you a reason now to say
[52:34] thank you God because you see I know
[52:36] brothers and some of you brothers and
[52:38] sisters may know that are here and they
[52:40] they trying so hard they don't have a
[52:41] Visa and they're trying to get that
[52:43] green card and we come at night and we
[52:46] pray and we pray and we pray and now
[52:48] here come the husband here come the wife
[52:52] but you see we had to get into the
[52:54] service glory to God we had to get into
[52:58] something and you see if you go to a
[53:00] ball game and you man you know you say
[53:03] they'll call you lame right you going to
[53:04] sit there the whole time and you just
[53:07] watching the game I went to a football
[53:10] game it was I I went when I went to
[53:12] school right I never been to a football

[55:27] this scripture let's read Revelations 3
[55:29] I just want you to see the condition of
[55:30] the age you see because we're in the
[55:33] last you see those that not have not
[55:35] come out of lay the seal he said it's
[55:38] those that have not taken the word for
[55:40] their day and the word for the day God
[55:44] diagnoses the the church in this hour
[55:47] God did his own diagnosis and he came
[55:50] and he said let me tell you what the
[55:52] last in the last days what the spirit
[55:55] will be on the church yeah yeah and let
[55:57] me tell you how people will act and now
[55:59] look at this he says I just read in
[56:02] verse 15 to make it sure I Know Thy
[56:05] works and that thou are neither cold or
[56:08] hot I would you be cold or hot so God is
[56:11] saying that the people in this last day
[56:14] he said that they're not on fire for
[56:17] God Amen he's saying they're in between
[56:20] yeah he said they come to church oh
[56:22] praise the
[56:23] Lord but he said I rather you sit home
[56:27] yeah or you come to church and have
[56:28] church now think about this now this
[56:31] what God now this is see this ain't this
[56:33] building this is God saying that you'll
[56:35] be in or out of his mouth so God is
[56:38] putting you in a place this morning amen
[56:40] so I ask you this morning how hot are
[56:42] you or How cold are you now I want you
[56:46] to think when you sitting next to
[56:48] somebody and they say they a little
[56:50] bigger see my brother right here
[56:52] overall see he's a little bit bigger he
[56:54] might prob a little more heat than me
[56:57] but let's just say as we sitting here
[56:59] now he's going to be putting out
[57:02] something now if the room is hot he's
[57:05] going to get hot but the room is cold
[57:07] he's going to get colder but he should
[57:10] always be hotter than me because of how
[57:12] big he is right now you ain't that big
[57:15] but you just have big you so let's just
[57:17] say this now I'm asking you this morning
[57:19] God says if we sit in the same place if
[57:22] I'm in between and he says if he's hot
[57:26] he said he'll take him he says if he was
[57:29] even cold if he didn't want to be here
[57:32] this morning God said he can still deal
[57:34] with him but he says if I halfway get
[57:37] into the service he said if I'm halfway
[57:40] thinking oh well you know I tell you
[57:42] what brother man wish she just wish she
[57:45] just come on okay praise the Lord yeah I
[57:47] do believe that yeah you know wish she
[57:50] keep talking about them ties I tell you
[57:52] that boy I tell you them ties he boy he
[57:54] in my wallet now ain't he brother he
[57:56] keep keep hitting on them ties every
[57:58] week Glory now think about this now
[58:00] praise the
[58:01] Lord now you in between now God can say
[58:06] I'd rather deal with him and he could be
[58:08] stinking half drunk God said I'd rather
[58:10] deal with him than deal with you K
[58:13] because you so far in between now look
[58:16] this is how he diagnosed how people
[58:18] would be in the church in the last day
[58:20] oh Lord I hope you see this and he said
[58:23] now and so then because you lukewarm you
[58:25] need to C hot he said I'll spew you out
[58:27] of my mouth so now God's not dealing
[58:30] with you that's oh Lord God he said I'm
[58:32] not dealing with that Lord God I'm
[58:36] either dealing with those that believe
[58:38] or those that
[58:39] sin oh I hope you see this now because
[58:43] he wants to touch you oh let me see this
[58:45] so because thou sayest but I'm rich now
[58:48] because you say you got loot because you
[58:50] say you got money he say and
[58:51] everything's going well you increase
[58:53] with goods and you don't need nothing he
[58:55] said you don't know yeah that you are
[58:58] wretched you're miserable and poor and
[59:02] blind and
[59:03] naked so these are people that are going
[59:06] to church and he's saying you don't know
[59:10] the sad State you're in and it's hard to
[59:13] tell somebody that is blind that don't
[59:15] see nothing and say well I want to help
[59:17] you out but they say I ain't blind they
[59:20] just bumping into everything they say I
[59:23] ain't blind ain't nothing wrong with me
[59:26] now that looks crazy doesn't it but you
[59:28] see this is how God diagnosed the people
[59:31] so he's saying there's people that go
[59:33] into church that act like they don't
[59:35] need God yeah and he said I want to help
[59:38] you but he says will you let me now let
[59:41] me keep reading I counsel thee to buy me
[59:45] gold Tri and the fire that thou mayest
[59:47] be rich and white Ren and thou mayest be
[59:49] clothed and thou and that the shame of
[59:52] thy nakedness do not appear and I want
[59:54] you to look around in verse 18 wish we
[59:56] could take time to break it all down but
[59:58] I just want you to look at this part and
[59:59] anoint thy eyes with eyes s that thou
[1:00:01] may see so God doesn't want any one of
[1:00:05] us in this age to be blind that's right
[1:00:08] amen right and you got to think now if
[1:00:10] God is telling you to anoint your eyes
[1:00:12] then the eyes s he's speaking of brother
[1:00:15] Keith it has to be here on the
[1:00:17] earth so now look at he's pointing to
[1:00:20] eyes now eyes Val is something you put
[1:00:23] on your eyes eyes Val is something that
[1:00:26] you can apply but you see here he's
[1:00:29] telling you that you have to do it
[1:00:31] because I've already provided it now
[1:00:33] he's saying is going to take away your
[1:00:36] spiritual
[1:00:37] blindness so when your eyes become open
[1:00:41] how can you not worship God when your
[1:00:43] eyes become open that you see the grace
[1:00:46] of God on your life then now you say why
[1:00:49] are you not rejoicing knowing that in
[1:00:51] this hour that he's not dealing with
[1:00:53] some people now in John 17 Jesus said I
[1:00:56] pray for my own not the world so God if
[1:00:59] God don't pray for you how you going to
[1:01:01] make it amen if God don't give you this
[1:01:04] isself how you going to make it amen if
[1:01:06] he don't tell you now how do you use
[1:01:08] this eyes he says
[1:01:11] repent now he says in this hour be very
[1:01:15] zous he said be very zealous why because
[1:01:19] he saw that Spirit coming over the
[1:01:21] church and remember he said in this hour
[1:01:23] he said it was almost total darkness
[1:01:26] amen almost total darkness that comes
[1:01:28] over the church so people hear the word
[1:01:32] but now for some reason they're
[1:01:34] resisting letting it take root in their
[1:01:36] life amen now let's think about this now
[1:01:38] let's turn I want you to go over with me
[1:01:41] to uh go with me to um um Mark
[1:01:45] Mark I can't yeah let me just let's go
[1:01:49] over here to Mark and I want you to
[1:01:53] see if God Mark 8 if God
[1:01:57] comes and he's telling you that the
[1:02:00] people need this it's because he's
[1:02:04] speaking to a condition that's suddenly
[1:02:06] coming to church and it's a warning for
[1:02:09] those that want to overcome in the last
[1:02:12] time in last hours amen now let me read
[1:02:14] this quote to you as we turn to Mark 8 I
[1:02:16] just want to read something to
[1:02:18] you
[1:02:20] now Lord let me let me see make try to
[1:02:23] make this little short um let let me
[1:02:26] just read
[1:02:27] this this is the resurrection he said
[1:02:31] basically what we could use he said is a
[1:02:33] good old fashion Holy Ghost sent
[1:02:36] Revival men back to believing the word
[1:02:40] of God that God will take care of us and
[1:02:45] he says like he did in the old
[1:02:48] days he will take care of us he says
[1:02:52] today amen now do you believe that God
[1:02:56] will take care of us what we need today
[1:02:59] he said is another
[1:03:03] refilling he says another like the
[1:03:06] disciples Hallelujah now remember what
[1:03:09] he referring to remember that Peter and
[1:03:12] you said John they were preaching and
[1:03:15] you said they went by the gate called
[1:03:16] beautiful and they healed the man
[1:03:18] remember they had just he gave acts 238
[1:03:20] he told him repent be baptized name of
[1:03:21] Jesus Christ and then I got to pause let
[1:03:24] me just drop this in Lord God let me
[1:03:26] pause he says acts 230 I think it's
[1:03:28] verse uh
[1:03:30] 42 I just read it to you and it says
[1:03:33] remember they went through certain
[1:03:35] afflictions and then when they were
[1:03:37] actually having to go before the council
[1:03:38] the council wanted to persecute them and
[1:03:40] then it says to the Believers this is
[1:03:43] what happened after the Holy Ghost fell
[1:03:46] down it says in verse four I just read
[1:03:49] 40 and with many other words he did
[1:03:51] testify and exhort saying save
[1:03:53] yourselves from this unto gener
[1:03:56] generation and he says then they that
[1:03:58] gladly received his word it says what
[1:04:02] they were
[1:04:03] baptized now come on now so you see
[1:04:06] we're talking about going past believing
[1:04:08] this morning amen but I'm asking you if
[1:04:10] you enter in going on to being baptized
[1:04:13] this morning now you say just in the
[1:04:15] water Brother Kyle no I'm talking about
[1:04:17] in his Spirit now look at here now now
[1:04:20] look at if we wanted to see the same
[1:04:22] thing the same Holy Ghost move he says
[1:04:24] in 41 and the same day there were added
[1:04:28] unto them about 3,000 souls and it says
[1:04:31] and they continued steadfastly in the
[1:04:34] apostles Doctrine they didn't change the
[1:04:36] word and he say and what
[1:04:39] Fellowship Lord God let St you see God
[1:04:44] wants
[1:04:45] fellowship and you see we come this
[1:04:47] morning to Fellowship around his word so
[1:04:51] well I want you to keep reading with me
[1:04:52] now and it says and in the breaking of
[1:04:55] bread so that means there was some
[1:04:57] eating going on naturally and
[1:04:59] spiritually when Believers get together
[1:05:03] Lord God help me you say he's bringing
[1:05:05] us together to show us a just a glimpse
[1:05:08] of what brother Randy heaven is like so
[1:05:10] you said there's Fellowship there's
[1:05:12] breaking of bread there's the word and
[1:05:14] then he says and In Praise amen so you
[1:05:17] can't do any of this without the spirit
[1:05:20] of God that's right now remember this is
[1:05:22] 42 this is after after he gave them the
[1:05:25] prescription Dr Peter yeah so now
[1:05:28] there's Fellowship going on there's one
[1:05:30] body everybody's together happy in
[1:05:33] Christ there's no big eyes there's no
[1:05:35] little you he said the spirit of God is
[1:05:38] moving now let me let me go let me let's
[1:05:40] turn back over now let's look at uh Mark
[1:05:43] 8 and we'll come back to this he says uh
[1:05:47] verse
[1:05:50] 22 and he cometh to be be besida and and
[1:05:55] they bring him a blind man unto him and
[1:05:59] besought him to touch
[1:06:02] him now let me keep reading this Paul
[1:06:06] stay with me for a
[1:06:07] second now think about it this man need
[1:06:10] a
[1:06:11] touch some of you trying to test an
[1:06:15] experience or trust it that they had 10
[1:06:18] years ago that's all right but what
[1:06:23] about today amen now
[1:06:26] you need one
[1:06:28] today today is the day sure of
[1:06:33] feeling the disciples about three or 4
[1:06:36] days after they received the Holy Ghost
[1:06:39] went back and got in one Accord amen
[1:06:43] look now and began to pray again with
[1:06:45] one Accord until the Holy Ghost shook
[1:06:48] the building where they were sitting am
[1:06:51] amen what we
[1:06:54] need God so now I got to pause for Mark
[1:06:57] for a second if you go back over to acts
[1:07:00] you'll see that now remember they have
[1:07:03] been threaten right remember they were
[1:07:05] doing Miracles they were they were doing
[1:07:06] the will of the Lord and the Pharisees
[1:07:09] Sadducees wanted to persecute them and
[1:07:11] when they wanted to persecute them they
[1:07:13] would now had to come before the C and
[1:07:14] they had to give account of what how do
[1:07:17] you do the things you do yeah and he
[1:07:19] says in what power and they say we do it
[1:07:21] all in a man that was approved of God
[1:07:23] yeah and he said his name was Jesus
[1:07:26] Christ now he says but now you neglected
[1:07:28] him you didn't want to hear the word for
[1:07:30] your day he said you wanted something
[1:07:32] different you didn't want to enter into
[1:07:35] the spirit of what God was doing in the
[1:07:38] hour so you see here now Lord help me he
[1:07:41] says now so they go and they they're
[1:07:43] questioned right they're threatened and
[1:07:45] they tell them don't you ever go and do
[1:07:47] this no more don't go and preach this
[1:07:50] gospel in the name of Jesus Christ we
[1:07:51] don't want to hear this and then the
[1:07:53] disciples go out and they go and tell
[1:07:55] those other people that want to hear the
[1:07:57] word am and when they go tell them they
[1:07:59] says
[1:08:00] now let me just I want to read you this
[1:08:03] one part of it let me read this one part
[1:08:05] and I'm going jump back to Mark Lord God
[1:08:08] I think it's acts five but it says when
[1:08:11] they were let go it says reported all
[1:08:13] that the chief and priest had told the
[1:08:14] elders now they told these people they
[1:08:16] said look they said this is everything
[1:08:18] they did to us this man that was whole
[1:08:21] that it said the Bible say he was older
[1:08:22] than 40 years old it said this
[1:08:24] particular man he says they knew that
[1:08:26] God did it yeah they knew God did it
[1:08:29] they knew these men were ignorant and
[1:08:30] unlearned they heard the way they talk
[1:08:33] but they knew that they had been with
[1:08:35] Jesus they took note that they had been
[1:08:38] with the Lord now look at this with me
[1:08:40] now now when they lifted up their voice
[1:08:42] the people lifted up their voice the
[1:08:45] people now heard the report and they got
[1:08:48] excited now it wasn't the preachers it
[1:08:51] was the
[1:08:52] people now I'm still going to ask you
[1:08:55] are you
[1:08:57] excited let me keep reading he say now
[1:09:00] look at verse 25 the question that comes
[1:09:02] up that touches me they said as David
[1:09:04] the servant of God said why did the
[1:09:07] Heathen rage and he said the people
[1:09:09] imagine vain things why were the
[1:09:13] people's thoughts on so many carnal
[1:09:15] things other than the things of God Amen
[1:09:17] why were people always thinking about
[1:09:19] you know how I can get over yeah how I
[1:09:21] can now make a next Buck he say what
[1:09:24] what else about what's going to change
[1:09:25] in my family they think about all these
[1:09:28] vain things that will pass away but why
[1:09:31] are they not thinking of God and the
[1:09:33] Bible said these people were heathens
[1:09:36] now think about this now we're all
[1:09:38] Gentiles but now by Sav by the grace of
[1:09:41] God if you take this word The Same
[1:09:44] Spirit then now God has to look at you
[1:09:47] differently that's right and what he
[1:09:49] said in the scriptures you cannot think
[1:09:52] vain thoughts and now be that saved Gent
[1:09:56] coming out of this hour you cannot be
[1:09:58] this person you have to be something
[1:10:00] different now let me read this now if
[1:10:02] you drop down this go all the way they
[1:10:05] praised God they were giving glory to
[1:10:07] God but in verse 31 after they prayed it
[1:10:10] says the place was shaken where they
[1:10:13] were assembled and were all filled with
[1:10:16] the Holy Ghost and they spoke the word
[1:10:19] with
[1:10:20] boldness now look at this now if God did
[1:10:23] it then God still does the same thing
[1:10:26] now yes sir and I want you to think
[1:10:29] about this morning the prophet God what
[1:10:31] he's speaking of is that people in this
[1:10:33] hour the church the whole body he says
[1:10:36] to bream Tabernacle to wherever you are
[1:10:38] in the world he says we all need a
[1:10:41] refilling now I want you to think
[1:10:43] there's a feeling and then there's a
[1:10:46] refilling now a refilling means that now
[1:10:50] if you had the holy spirit before God
[1:10:53] wants to give you a little bit more amen
[1:10:55] now I want you to think about this this
[1:10:57] morning now because in Mark 8 this is
[1:11:00] the story it's a man that he was blind
[1:11:05] and this blind man it says he was in the
[1:11:07] city of Bethesda and Bethesda you see
[1:11:11] this city was called the house of
[1:11:13] fishing and this is the place where
[1:11:15] Peter was from Andrew was from and being
[1:11:18] from this place it wasn't really a great
[1:11:20] place to be from like brother was
[1:11:22] telling about Lima he said the streets
[1:11:24] of Li it maybe not the best best place
[1:11:25] to be from but you see but God brought
[1:11:29] him out am now come on somebody God
[1:11:32] brought him out and you see it's nothing
[1:11:35] like good friends amen you can have
[1:11:37] friends but there good friends you see
[1:11:40] now remember when the man he was
[1:11:43] impotent and Jesus Christ was in the
[1:11:45] house and as he was sitting in the house
[1:11:48] the Bible says that it was a man that
[1:11:51] had some good friends yeah and the
[1:11:53] friends saw the condition of their
[1:11:55] friend amen and they didn't leave them
[1:11:58] outside the church but their friend
[1:12:00] tried to take them to church they tried
[1:12:03] to now get them in the presence of God
[1:12:08] now the man couldn't get there so let me
[1:12:10] tell you what they did they went and
[1:12:13] they got this man up and they said man
[1:12:15] lay him out bro lay him out and they got
[1:12:17] him up and they put him somehow on top
[1:12:20] of this man house and They Carried this
[1:12:23] man all over the roof
[1:12:25] y'all a hear me and you see they were
[1:12:28] real friends now real friends and I
[1:12:31] think they might have been filled
[1:12:33] once glory to God and you see now
[1:12:36] something was pulling in them that deep
[1:12:39] calling to the Deep to pull this man up
[1:12:42] to get to Jesus now all I'm supposed to
[1:12:45] do this morning is let you get a little
[1:12:46] closer to Jesus if you can get in his
[1:12:49] presence you get a little closer to him
[1:12:51] you will never ever be the same this
[1:12:52] morning but have you cast it on your
[1:12:54] cars yet amen now when they pull him up
[1:12:57] on the roof as they're pulling him it's
[1:13:00] about four of them and as they're
[1:13:02] pulling him up they get all the way to
[1:13:03] the top and there's a problem yeah let's
[1:13:06] say this house got a a metal sheet ring
[1:13:09] a sheet tin and it and it and that they
[1:13:11] wonder how in the world we going to get
[1:13:12] them in
[1:13:14] Jesus I believe maybe one of them
[1:13:16] brothers they said you know what man we
[1:13:18] need a change so we need a change so and
[1:13:23] they looked at the roof and the Bible
[1:13:25] said that they started busting up the
[1:13:27] man
[1:13:29] roof now you see some of y'all may not
[1:13:31] like that but you see if I was hurting I
[1:13:35] want somebody to te the roof off I want
[1:13:38] somebody to get me to Jesus amen now you
[1:13:41] see when they went and they started
[1:13:42] cutting the hole now the Bible said they
[1:13:45] cut a hole in this man's roof and they
[1:13:47] started to lower this man down now he
[1:13:50] might not have been they might have been
[1:13:51] EMTs brother Adam but it might have been
[1:13:53] jerking everywhere but it didn't matter
[1:13:55] how hurt he was because at the time he
[1:13:58] got to Jesus Jesus he touched
[1:14:02] him he didn't need no scalpel he didn't
[1:14:05] need no syringe he didn't need no
[1:14:08] medicine all he needed was a touch Lord
[1:14:12] God oh I hope you see it this morning
[1:14:14] and a touch is all you need this morning
[1:14:16] if you come into His presence Just a
[1:14:19] Touch Hallelujah and I want you to see
[1:14:21] this morning we look at this story this
[1:14:23] man that was blind you see he saw the
[1:14:26] condition of that City yes he saw where
[1:14:28] he came from he knew that it was a bad
[1:14:31] spot he knew that not everybody makes it
[1:14:33] out of there and gets their sight but
[1:14:36] this blind man he says you know what I
[1:14:39] got some good friends yeah and the Bible
[1:14:41] says they went and they brought him to
[1:14:44] Jesus Jesus had just maybe did what he
[1:14:47] just fed the 5,000 just fed the 4,000
[1:14:50] and that's not including women and
[1:14:52] children and now he was they were
[1:14:53] supposed to go over to Beth societet the
[1:14:56] first time but they got caught into a
[1:14:58] little traffic yeah and he walked on the
[1:15:00] water saying to the disciples they
[1:15:01] didn't know all this but he had to get
[1:15:04] to this blind man because you see Jesus
[1:15:06] told him to go over to besida yeah but
[1:15:09] the wind came up against him and they
[1:15:11] ended up going to another place before
[1:15:13] they got here yeah but I believe as the
[1:15:15] Bible tells us it has to be for this
[1:15:17] blind man yeah amen this blind man his
[1:15:20] friends bring him to Jesus and he comes
[1:15:23] to Jesus and they said if we can just
[1:15:26] get Jesus Christ to touch him yeah if we
[1:15:29] can get Jesus to touch his
[1:15:33] situation it wasn't he wasn't just
[1:15:36] coming to church he said just to come to
[1:15:38] church brother I he had a certain
[1:15:41] situation amen see he wasn't coming
[1:15:45] because he couldn't walk think about
[1:15:47] this now he wasn't coming because he had
[1:15:49] money problems yeah he wasn't coming see
[1:15:52] his need was he was blind and I tell you
[1:15:55] this morning your individual need means
[1:15:58] more to Jesus than the problem amen
[1:16:01] that's what he see let me keep reading
[1:16:04] this he was coming to get delivered from
[1:16:07] a situation that nobody else could
[1:16:10] change I want you to think about this
[1:16:12] now and when you have one of those
[1:16:15] problems it'll make you fall on your
[1:16:17] knees I was telling the guy on the
[1:16:19] airplane I've never had this happen had

[1:17:11] he had Faith yeah yeah yeah and he was
[1:17:13] like you know you know I just don't see
[1:17:15] many people pick up the Bible and read

[1:17:20] moved down here in this small town of
[1:17:22] tcoa Georgia and he said I'm kind of by
[1:17:24] myself and I just kind of feeling like I

[1:17:41] but started popping and I'm like oh
[1:17:43] horse and I was sitting there the whole
[1:17:45] time and I'm like I couldn't stop
[1:17:47] talking about him and I was saying I
[1:17:50] pray I'm not too loud and I'm just
[1:17:51] talking about I said well you know he
[1:17:53] was telling about even bap AP ISM he
[1:17:55] saying well you know I going to church
[1:17:57] and why you think how the baptism go you
[1:18:00] read acts 238 amen you know now I can
[1:18:02] show you now look now I'm going tell you
[1:18:04] it's a difference see when I go to the
[1:18:06] prison I was telling the guys I say now
[1:18:09] some of you you locked up here and I
[1:18:11] said I can tell by your spirit that you
[1:18:14] still want to remain the same I said now
[1:18:17] this a Bible class and I said you don't
[1:18:19] want to bring your Bible and you sitting
[1:18:22] up there with shades on I tell I think I
[1:18:24] tell brother a guy sitting there with
[1:18:25] shades on I tell you just imagine a guy
[1:18:28] sitting there like you in church and he
[1:18:30] got shades on I'm thinking well Lord
[1:18:31] maybe something going on with his eyes I
[1:18:32] don't
[1:18:33] know but when it came time to sign a
[1:18:36] little roster he picked the shades up
[1:18:38] and he
[1:18:41] like now I'm like now this man maybe
[1:18:44] almost 50 in the 50s now and I'm saying
[1:18:47] you sitting there like you the coolest
[1:18:49] thing in here and I tell him plainly I
[1:18:51] said now this a Bible class so what you
[1:18:53] doing showing up with no Bible

[1:18:57] if you want life if you want a program
[1:18:59] then you need to go sign up for another
[1:19:01] class yeah but if you want Christ then
[1:19:03] that's why we came here now I say that
[1:19:06] to you because this man as I'm telling

[1:19:38] brother brand with the cloud over and I
[1:19:40] said now want you think about this now I
[1:19:42] said now this man is a man of God Amen
[1:19:44] and I said let me tell you he said when
[1:19:47] God start dealing with me I read a
[1:19:49] message that he preached called
[1:19:51] persevering and I said it was about this
[1:19:53] Mexican lady down in there and what
[1:19:55] touching by the end of it he was talking
[1:19:57] about how this woman came up she had a
[1:19:59] dead baby baby had been dead that
[1:20:01] morning prayed over the baby and the
[1:20:02] baby came back to life yeah and I was
[1:20:05] sitting there like but the thing was
[1:20:06] they said it been raining that day and
[1:20:08] he said he started early that morning
[1:20:10] that they had been sitting out there
[1:20:12] waiting for the service late that night
[1:20:14] and I was sitting there like you know
[1:20:16] many people say they love God yeah but
[1:20:18] have you ever been that persevering for
[1:20:20] anything in your life for God anything I
[1:20:24] want you think about that anything and
[1:20:26] that's said I told myself said I
[1:20:27] remember reading what this man was
[1:20:29] saying and I was on my couch and I broke
[1:20:31] down in Te broke me down and I've had
[1:20:34] many guys that I've seen come and go ran
[1:20:37] the streets with I can tell you so much
[1:20:40] but I want to speak something to you
[1:20:42] when that heard that word it was
[1:20:44] something that broke me down and say you
[1:20:46] ain't persevering enough for God you say
[1:20:49] you love God you say you love him but
[1:20:51] you really ain't really try yeah oh Lord
[1:20:54] now now brother BR that message he says
[1:20:56] anything you ever got from God you
[1:20:58] really tried you persevered in order to
[1:21:02] get it any of y'all went to school any
[1:21:05] of y'all play sports he said now tell me
[1:21:07] you ain't put no effort into it think
[1:21:09] about think I me the books you had to
[1:21:11] read see how many nights you had to stay
[1:21:13] up but then when it come to God I'm just
[1:21:14] going to show up to church let the
[1:21:16] preacher bless me man let the preacher
[1:21:19] put me in heaven cuz I'm here let me put
[1:21:21] Let me let me dig deep today get my
[1:21:24] dollar out boy look at look what I did
[1:21:25] for the Lord think about it
[1:21:28] now so I want you to see spiritually now
[1:21:32] where we're at is that it's no different
[1:21:35] for I just talking to this young man
[1:21:36] it's no different to see there's people
[1:21:38] that are getting hotter and there's
[1:21:40] people that are getting so cold amen and
[1:21:42] I I only want you to see this little
[1:21:44] story to see where you're at yeah amen
[1:21:49] when this man came he came and his
[1:21:53] friends brought him and they brought him
[1:21:55] for the reason to have Jesus touch his
[1:21:59] situation amen and when they ask Jesus
[1:22:02] to touch him I want you to see the Bible
[1:22:04] says he took the man in his same
[1:22:07] condition yeah and he was blind amen so
[1:22:11] God if he can heal a blind man then he
[1:22:13] can still H help and save the Blind Men
[1:22:17] now but the question is is do you know
[1:22:19] you're blind you see some of our eyes
[1:22:22] have been open maybe some haven't but
[1:22:25] you have to know your condition this
[1:22:27] morning and you got to look at it now
[1:22:29] remember God is not coming to save those
[1:22:31] that's already saved that's right he's
[1:22:33] coming to speak to you whatever sit you
[1:22:35] what you were in basically to what give
[1:22:38] you life amen and so now you have to
[1:22:41] recognize what condition you are in this
[1:22:44] morning so that God can touch you now
[1:22:47] look at what he says when they come back
[1:22:49] the he took the blind man by the hand
[1:22:52] and the Bible says now it's Jesus and
[1:22:55] this man that's blind and they walk all
[1:22:58] the way out the
[1:23:00] city sometimes you got to get away from
[1:23:02] all
[1:23:03] unbelief sometimes you got to get away
[1:23:04] from old friends you say Old Situation
[1:23:08] and now God has to take you by the hand
[1:23:10] to take you from the fishing house to
[1:23:12] take you a little bit outside of that
[1:23:15] and now show you he says what I can do
[1:23:17] for you now think about it what if this
[1:23:20] man along the way when he started his
[1:23:22] journey and he said he loved the Lord
[1:23:24] what what if he took his hand
[1:23:26] back and think how many people start on
[1:23:29] the journey and they pull their hand
[1:23:30] back amen but your hand has to stay in
[1:23:34] the hand of the maker amen now remember
[1:23:37] as they're walking hand in hand it's him
[1:23:40] and Jesus yeah maybe he asked them where
[1:23:42] you from he said you know how'd you get
[1:23:45] in this situation how long you been
[1:23:46] blind were you born this way maybe he's
[1:23:49] talking now he knows all things but
[1:23:51] maybe he's just talking to him and as
[1:23:53] they're talking
[1:23:55] they get to a place that they have to
[1:23:58] stop now I want you to see this because
[1:24:01] remember what he wanted was a
[1:24:03] touch he stops and he says when he led
[1:24:07] him out of the town and when he has Spit
[1:24:10] on His Eyes he put his hands
[1:24:13] on now I want you to see when you want
[1:24:17] to judge the nature of Christ you got to
[1:24:19] look back at the word of God and when
[1:24:22] you see the nature of God it's not going
[1:24:24] to be like what everybody thinks right
[1:24:27] when you look at John the Baptist with a
[1:24:30] with a wiry beard a leather girdle and
[1:24:32] you say eating wild Locus and honey may
[1:24:35] be got honey all over being you say uh
[1:24:37] Are you ashamed to say that's your
[1:24:38] pastor Lord think about it now you know
[1:24:42] he got the word of the Lord ah you

[1:24:47] Grass y' y'all church a little different
[1:24:49] brother you know y'all Church you know I

[1:24:54] it now he said but look you had to go
[1:24:56] out to go see John John his dad was a
[1:25:00] priest but you see John God did a
[1:25:02] special work with John amen it's no
[1:25:04] different than this man he's out and he
[1:25:07] has a man that he's never seen before
[1:25:10] and the man he comes to him Brother
[1:25:12] Richard and he looks and he says me look

[1:25:18] situation I
[1:25:20] hope that's right brother amen amen I'm
[1:25:23] blind

[1:25:37] blind that he like I know I'm blind but
[1:25:39] I ain't crazy but he had a bad situation
[1:25:43] I hope you see this and now he couldn't
[1:25:46] run while God got some spit together
[1:25:49] glory to God he couldn't go nowhere but
[1:25:52] he had to stay right there yeah and he
[1:25:54] stays there brother brother Brook he
[1:25:56] stays there and he says okay well he led
[1:26:00] me this far GL to God he let me this far
[1:26:04] amen and I can't see amen and it's
[1:26:07] something about his voice it's something
[1:26:10] about him he said I I'm blind and I know
[1:26:14] I had good friends that bought me here
[1:26:16] and I know he wants to change my
[1:26:18] situation amen I'm just going to sit
[1:26:21] here for a minute yes sir so Jesus
[1:26:25] and he spits in both eyes and the man is
[1:26:29] still standing there and as he's
[1:26:31] standing there now maybe he has spit
[1:26:34] hanging off both our
[1:26:35] legs and it's hanging down just like
[1:26:38] this
[1:26:39] amen now you see when it comes to God
[1:26:44] things get ugly a little time he said
[1:26:46] every birth is a
[1:26:48] mess and you sometimes you see the fear
[1:26:51] of people they just not willing to let
[1:26:54] go yeah amen and they're scared if they
[1:26:56] get into the service that somebody's
[1:26:58] going to look at them they scared that
[1:27:00] maybe if they let Jesus touch their
[1:27:03] situation that now they everybody's
[1:27:05] going to talk about praise the Lord but
[1:27:07] I'm asking you what about your
[1:27:11] condition amen is your condition big
[1:27:14] enough to you say I really don't care

[1:27:30] something for me amen now and tell you
[1:27:32] i' see it in the prison you ask the God
[1:27:34] and say how you really going to be a
[1:27:36] real man and you're looking at 5 to 10
[1:27:39] and he says you come here and you tell
[1:27:41] me you look you love God and you still
[1:27:43] won't get into the service it was a guy
[1:27:45] one time we preaching he said Brother
[1:27:47] Kyle he said he sto service he said I do
[1:27:49] not have the Holy Ghost and I said how
[1:27:52] many times you've been in a church and
[1:27:53] now you see people that you know they
[1:27:55] don't have the Holy Spirit and they in
[1:27:57] and out of the church they up and down
[1:27:59] and you can watch their spirit and know
[1:28:01] that something's not right but yet they
[1:28:04] saying when I get things together and I
[1:28:07] ask you God is not looking for you to
[1:28:09] get nothing together all he wants you to
[1:28:12] do is stand that will spit on your eyes
[1:28:15] cuz see he said humble yourself first
[1:28:17] and you see see before God could deal
[1:28:19] with Moses he had to first take off his
[1:28:22] shoes God didn't speak speak to him
[1:28:24] until first he turned aside to see what
[1:28:27] God had done so he had to Humble himself
[1:28:30] from the wisdom of Egypt to see a
[1:28:31] burning bush amen and the burning bush
[1:28:33] maybe was this big and I want you to
[1:28:36] think about it God when he saw that now
[1:28:39] he turned aside to see the bush amen
[1:28:42] then he started deal amen now think
[1:28:45] about this brother R this man he's
[1:28:48] having his burning bush experience and
[1:28:50] he's standing in front of the Alpha and
[1:28:53] Omega yeah and he's speaking directly to
[1:28:56] him and he tells him he says huh I'mma
[1:29:00] put my hands on I put my hands on you I
[1:29:03] want to pray and as he laid his hands on
[1:29:07] him he takes them off and he ask the man
[1:29:10] he says do you see
[1:29:13] anything and the man he start he opens
[1:29:16] his eyes and for the first time he sees
[1:29:20] something out of his
[1:29:22] pupil now think about this now
[1:29:24] yes but it was still spit hanging there
[1:29:28] it was still dust on his cloth he still
[1:29:30] walked a good journey but when his eyes
[1:29:32] was open Jesus comes he says what do you
[1:29:36] see and he said I see men walking like
[1:29:40] trees now think about this now Jesus Is
[1:29:44] God manifested In the
[1:29:46] Flesh he laid his hand on him he spinned
[1:29:51] his eyes he had done everything for the
[1:29:54] situation but yet the man saw men like
[1:30:00] trees sometimes your first experience
[1:30:02] you didn't go all the way with God yeah
[1:30:04] yeah yeah yeah yeah and you see this
[1:30:06] particular man he said even though he
[1:30:09] had been touched the situation had not
[1:30:11] yet been
[1:30:12] rectified I hope you see this this
[1:30:14] morning and so now I want you to look
[1:30:17] now think about anything you have on
[1:30:19] your heart anything that you want to
[1:30:21] bring before God this morning amen amen
[1:30:23] now this morning let God lay his hands
[1:30:27] on amen amen let God spit in your eyes
[1:30:30] Hallelujah let God spit on the situation
[1:30:33] he didn't spit on his leg he didn't spit
[1:30:35] on his head he didn't spit on the ear he
[1:30:36] spit on the situation so God something
[1:30:39] had to come out of God's mouth amen and
[1:30:42] what he spew was something that was hot
[1:30:45] oh Lord I hope you see this this morning
[1:30:47] amen and what came out went directly to
[1:30:50] the individual this morning this is not
[1:30:53] a group of fair you say I can see you
[1:30:56] can come and you see well these people
[1:30:58] were praising the Lord this side wasn't
[1:31:00] these people you see it's an individual
[1:31:02] that's right now I want you to see this
[1:31:04] now my brother my sister if God could
[1:31:09] have Way start moving on your
[1:31:12] situation would you praise
[1:31:14] him if God if God could just come by
[1:31:17] your door yeah and he can look down in
[1:31:19] your bank account amen and he can look
[1:31:21] and see that you have a monetary issue
[1:31:24] I'm saying would it hurt to let God put
[1:31:27] $5 in there even though you need 10 now
[1:31:30] think about this now would you let God
[1:31:32] put five in and if he put five would you
[1:31:35] give God praise for five come come on
[1:31:38] somebody come on now you see but you see
[1:31:43] God don't halfway do
[1:31:45] nothing and you see I want you to see
[1:31:48] this morning that some of you need a
[1:31:50] second touch and what God was doing to
[1:31:53] this man he would not let him leave with
[1:31:55] a halfway touch God would not let his
[1:31:59] bride not be perfect he said I'm coming
[1:32:02] for a bride without spot without blemish
[1:32:05] and won't have one wrinkle so the word
[1:32:08] that God gives us is so perfect that now
[1:32:10] it comes and it changes you from the
[1:32:13] inside out but will you give God praise
[1:32:16] for
[1:32:17] it let them put five in your biger
[1:32:20] account I want you to think about
[1:32:22] something it ain't a man that won't come
[1:32:24] to my house and you say I'm going to put
[1:32:26] something on it you ain't going to say
[1:32:27] thank you amen but you see here you may
[1:32:30] not be letting God take the second touch
[1:32:33] amen so what happens he's standing here
[1:32:35] he knows he's not seeing everything
[1:32:37] clearly so God wants all of us to see
[1:32:40] things clearly amen so this man is still
[1:32:44] sitting here and he speaks to him
[1:32:46] brother kid and he ask him what do you
[1:32:48] see now it's based on your testimony
[1:32:50] this morning amen how do you see the
[1:32:52] word where are you standing today you
[1:32:55] say what do you need from God what
[1:32:58] what's bothering you I want you to think
[1:33:00] about this now you say let him spit and
[1:33:03] touch it and he's going to ask you has
[1:33:05] the situation
[1:33:07] changed when he asked this man he said I
[1:33:09] see men like trees everything wasn't
[1:33:13] clear now Jesus don't leave the man
[1:33:17] don't leave so you see it's a faith
[1:33:21] there it's something moving like a
[1:33:23] magnet
[1:33:24] and it's pulling everything there now
[1:33:27] brother we sing this song the power of
[1:33:30] God is moving just like a magnet and he
[1:33:33] say I say man he say it's moving there
[1:33:35] it's moving here it's moving everywhere
[1:33:38] oh the power of God is moving just like
[1:33:41] a magnet amen I want you to see here
[1:33:43] it's a magnet it has to be a attraction
[1:33:46] on your Mountain this morning it has to
[1:33:48] be something to pull you to the presence
[1:33:50] of God to Mount Si this morning this is
[1:33:54] what he's going to do he says hold on
[1:33:56] for a second let me read to you what he
[1:33:59] does and he looked up he said I see me
[1:34:01] like trees walking and after he put his
[1:34:04] hands again upon his
[1:34:06] eyes he never had to spit again but all
[1:34:10] he had to do is put his hands on the
[1:34:15] situation see he was speaking of the
[1:34:19] holy spirit amen and the Holy Spirit you
[1:34:23] have to let God handle your
[1:34:26] situation the Bible said the battle let
[1:34:28] me told Jehosaphat the battle is not
[1:34:29] yours it's the law but he said but you
[1:34:32] must be willing and ready to
[1:34:35] fight I hope you see this now so you see
[1:34:39] being ready for battle means you have to
[1:34:41] be willing to stand when everything's
[1:34:43] not shaping up you would think that

[1:41:53] I'm asking you you say if you love the
[1:41:56] Lord don't you see as time is winding up
[1:41:59] he said that now there will be those
[1:42:01] that will be bundled in and bundled out

[1:42:09] week and I want you to see that you see
[1:42:11] all these different spirits and you ask
[1:42:13] now when we come to the house of God you
[1:42:16] say is right now is everybody in One
[1:42:20] Accord is everybody seeing what God
[1:42:24] wants you to see in his word does
[1:42:26] everybody want God to remove any
[1:42:28] condition so that they can walk before
[1:42:30] him holy blameless without spot now look
[1:42:34] at this I'm keep
[1:42:35] reading after he put his hands again
[1:42:37] upon him his eyes and made him look up
[1:42:40] and he was restored and then he saw
[1:42:44] every man clearly amen so the second
[1:42:48] time all he did was he had to put his
[1:42:50] hand on Amen now I'm asking you this is
[1:42:53] it took a second touch now I asked you
[1:42:56] this morning could anybody use a second

[1:43:03] see oh I hope you see it this morning
[1:43:06] y'all I'm talking about he said a second
[1:43:08] touch now the touch can only be done by
[1:43:10] Jesus a man can't touch you but I'm
[1:43:13] asking you if Jesus you let Jesus touch
[1:43:15] you if you let Jesus come down and touch
[1:43:18] your eyes he said touch whatever
[1:43:20] situation because he said let me touch
[1:43:22] it again
[1:43:24] if God can move the if he did the first
[1:43:27] time then now he only wants to bring it
[1:43:29] so it can be perfect now I only ask you
[1:43:32] this in the end time now all the promise

[1:43:53] come up and down why because you say
[1:43:55] we're grieving God and you see The
[1:43:58] Grieving of God is because we don't give
[1:44:00] him everything when you give God
[1:44:02] everything all he can do if he said you
