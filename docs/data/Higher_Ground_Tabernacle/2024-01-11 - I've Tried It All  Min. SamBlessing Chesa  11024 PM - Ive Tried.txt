reporting for Duty and waiting on you and you alone in Jesus Christ name the church shall say amen amen amen whilst we standing let us open our Bibles with the Book of Mark in chapter 5 25 amen Mark chapter 5 verse 25 if you have gotten theirs just say amen amen if you still need a little more time say help me Lord amen and a certain woman which had an issue of blood 12 years let's start from verse 24 and Jesus went with him and much people followed him and thronged him and a certain woman which had which had an issue of blood for 12 years and had suffered many things of many Physicians and had spent all that she had and was nothing bettered but rather grew worse we'll continue reading as we take our seats I want to speak on this uh title I've tried it all amen I don't believe I'll take too much of your time amen amen and when she heard of Jesus came in the press behind and touched His Garment amen we all know the story of the woman with the issue of blood as we call her she had suffered for so long and the Bible in verse 26 tells us that she had spent all that she had she had sold all her possession amen so that she could get healed I believe she went to find the doctors that her money could afford she tried all of them but none of them could give her a solution none of them could heal her but she hadn't encountered one doctor Jesus amen amen and the Bible say she has spent all that she had not just her money but emotionally she had spent all she was drained and she had tried all that she could but instead of getting better she got worse amen amen but one particular day I believe she heard of Jesus and the good news that was happening in in her in her City and she said let me go and find out for myself amen she said if Jesus could heal all of them Open the Eyes of the blind what about me amen amen and everyone was around Jesus the Bible says everyone was thronging against him and this woman she was frail she was F she was weak amen but she had to press her way through she was pressing her way through men people who were strong at all cost I'm reaching to Jesus when when she heard of Jesus came in the pr behind and touched His Garment for she said I may touch but his cloth shall be another in Luke it says h of His Garment that was Faith she was believing that I I don't need to talk to him I don't need him to lay his hands on I can just read Reach Out And Touch the my 12 year long situation 12 Long disease this will be the end of it amen amen and verse 29 says and straight away the Fountain of her blood was dried up she felt in her body that she was healed of that the moment she reached out that ever flowing blood stopped why because their faith had reached out and touched the master all what the doctors had failed to do the master was able to do it so it is her faith that made her whole hallelujah hallelujah we know every time Jesus healed a person you would say your faith so everything it lies within your faith amen what are you believing on have faith faith is not an imagination faith is not in I think so is I know so amen amen who do you have your faith in whatever you have your faith in some people have faith in medicine there nothing wrong with medicine you know what's healing you not that medicine it's the faith that you have in that have you ever had a situation or a problem and you know that if I just go talk to my friend I know I'll be fine your friend doesn't need to give you an answer but you just talking you feel that heavy burden leave what is that that was your faith amen amen some people place their faith in medicine some put Faith in their friends but I put my faith in Jesus amen because he is the one who has never ever failed he says cast your cares upon me and he will take it away from you and he can set you free it doesn't matter how much you have tried you can say I've tried it all I've tried all the solutions I can think but I got a question for you this have you tried Jesus if you try him you won't come back empty and the prophet of God tells us that faith is a revelation so God has to reveal to you to believe in him and when you have that Revelation God's revelation never fa amen amen so faith is a revelation and faith comes by hearing hearing the word of God the more you listen to the word of God the more faith you have and the more you use your faith the bigger it grows and the Revelation you get cannot be taught only given by God can find that Revelation in biology T you cannot find it from anyone else but you can only find it in the word of God when you place your faith in the word of God God is obligated to make his word come to pass because he not a man that he should lie a son of man that he should repent and he has a reputation of never failing so if you call him at his word this is what your word says I believe it he will come through for you I've tried it before he has done it for me amen amen verse 30 says and Jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him turned him about in the press and said who touched my clothes and his disciple said unto him thou see the thronging thee and say thou who touched me why did he lose virtue because it that woman who was operating the gift the prophet of God tells us that when Jesus was using his gift he would not get weary but when someone else was drawing from it that gift he was growing weary why was that drawing her life was drawing healing from him and he felt The Virtue leave him he is asking who touched me the disciples looked around looked at him crazy of people here pushing against you and you're asking who touched he said no it's a different kind of touch this felt different it was a touch of Faith amen so a touch of faith is different from a regular touch so how are you reaching to Jesus that special tou of faith and your situation will never be amen verse 34 and he said unto her daughter thy faith had made go in peace and be hold of thy amen amen she didn't say I have made you whole the faith that you have that's what has healed you so whatever you want whatever you're praying for the faith that you have within you is what's going to reach out and bring it to you amen amen because faith is that six sense that quietens down everything that goes against the word of God Amen so the faith that you have is what you need for whatever you have desire amen if Jesus did that for the woman we are reading about what about the Jesus who's in you this evening able to do what he said he will [Music] do amen God allowed her to stay in there for 12 years she didn't she didn't leave her to stay in for one year if she stayed for one year it was just going to be a minor sickness it was going to be a minor inconvenience but God waited for it to stay long enough prove that he is God what man cannot do God can do what other doctors cannot do why someone wrote a song and say reach out and as he passes by amen he is never too busy for you and me why because the Bible tells us he is the high priest feeling of our amen amen he was touched by the infirmity of the sick woman spent all that she had and she was trying her last option he says I'm going to the master let me Reach Out And Touch him that's what we do all of us amen many times we try everything else and then you want to go to God last why don't you try to flip it around first before you try everything cuz he's the only one with guarantee am sometimes he puts you in a situation he can take you out and prove that he is God cuz sometimes if he lets you to get too comfortable you forget that he is God no longer need have the need of him you have all the money that you need you have all the health that you need and you're going to tell yourself what do I need God that's why Jesus said it's hard for a rich man to get through the eye of a needle because you have the comfort of your riches you have everything at arms length but if you are son of God if you a daughter of God once in a while it Ruffles you up a little bit he removes that Comfort a bit so you have to know and realize things goes left God is trying to tell you something closer to him he is more than willing take you out amen amen don't let anyone stop you from reaching to Jesus this evening you did not let the snow stop you you went through those roads you say I'm getting I'm going to get into his presence it just does not have to be in this building even when you at home just reach out to him don't let anything stop you don't let your cell phone stop you don't let your friends stop you don't let your wife your husband stop you because how does God speak to us he speaks to us through his word that's why Satan gives us so many distraction because he's stopping you from reaching out to him because he knows the moment you listen to that word your faith is activated you feel something and you cannot stand before you so that's why he gives you that distraction you can realize that it's Satan who's trying to stop you go ahead anyways she she crawled in in between their feet said nothing is going to stop me and she went and she grabbed it and the Bible says immedi her problem was solved she was healed she had to get to that Fountain of Life David talks about as the Deep panted for the water it says when the deer has been Hound by those wild dogs and it's bleeding that deer knows it's going to die unless it finds water so it will try at all cost to reach to that River of water as soon as it gets into the water bleeding will stop will know it can leave again amen you and me we can recognize this evening whatever you are going through whatever you are struggling [Music] with run to the Fountain of Life Run To That River of Life and he will stop your issues he will stop your problem amen amen what men call impossible God calls possible that's why the theme of The Prophet Ministry was only believe all things are possible not some up to you all means but as far as the dictionary tells me all means everything so if you just believe all things are possible amen amen believing creates an atmosphere atere where Faith Can Works amen amen so if you believe you are creating that atmosphere where God can make everything possible in your life it's just like an egg if you just put it out there nothing happens but if you put it in a special specific kind of heat something will start happening within it and it's able to hatch because it's in the right temperature it's in the right kind of atmosphere so if you believe and you come in the presence of God that's the atmosphere where all things are possible the atmosphere all his promises can come to pass amen amen you can say I don't have faith but you do have faith when you came to sit how many people before you said you chat to see if your chair wasn't going to fall you did not you had faith in your that is Faith you believe those four legs were not going to back so if you can believe in a chair why can't you believe in God in Blasphemous names the prophet of God says it says patience and so forth 142 there's a mockery of it a pretending to be he says that's a nature given Faith nature given virt Temperance all these things are nature given so the faith that you used to see at your chair where you seated that's nature given faith it say and the biggest part of our faith is mental Faith by hearing the word it brings us to a mental recognition of God but if this coming from above 144 he says if it ever strikes this there is a Godly spiritual Faith so when the word of God is applied to your nature given faith that becomes a Godly spiritual faith then what does that Faith do that Faith recognizes only the word no matter what anything else says recognizes the word amen amen in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the word cannot be shaken app apply the word of God to your mental faith that nature given Faith that's Godly spiritual Faith so you do not need much only believe all things are possible amen amen and faith will make you do crazy things I believe when people were looking at this woman they were wondering what are you doing why are you crawling in this crowd only she knew what she was doing the Revelation was given to her so when God tells you to do something doesn't matter what anyone else say or how you would look to people around you as he say cuz when he gives you that Revelation it has an expected end amen amen it makes you do things that people consider AB normal and when you take your faith and you put your faith in God's word God is going to come through for you in God's covenant with Abra in the prophet of God says he says and he said it's it's also written and he took the father's word and defeated Satan right on his ground he took the father's word and defe what did he do he was proving to the weakest of Christians that you can defeat Satan anywhere any time on the plain word of God just take it and say th says the Lord it is written amen amen Jesus despite him being the word despite all the power that he had you overcame Satan by saying it is written have you ever noticed sometimes when you're going through a mind battle God drops a scripture into your heart do you think that is that is your Victory say it back to the devil say it is written amen shall not live by bread alone it is written by his stries I am healed amen it is written that I am not the tail but I am the head it is written that I'm more than a conqueror say it back to the devil and the word says the word of God that word that you are repeating out can defeat Satan anywhere at any time any place does not matter where you are speak that word that says the Lord and things are going to change because when God's word goes out the Bible says it does not go back to him until after it has accomplished that which he has set it out you take God at his word he has no option but to come through amen amen in hear his voice the prophet of God says 154 nothing is going to bother you don't be scared to take God at his word says just relax have faith and believe he's watching over you or I like this part you'll disintegrate anything that tries to bother you or it might attack you but it cannot harm you hallelujah hallelujah he'll disintegrate anything disintegrate that tries to bother you have you ever gone to a car junkyard you see all the different parts of cars in different places they so mixed up you cannot tell which one disintegrating so the word says you'll disintegrate anything exactly that's what he will do Isaiah he said no weapon formed against me shall prosper it might try to work but it's not going to succeed why because he will disintegrate it amen amen it will not harm you it might attack you but it's not going to prosper he says for all things he permits it amen amen it says all things work together for them that love the Lord can come to you unless God allows it you remember job Satan had to go ask for permission say can I go touch J and God said go but don't touch his life he the first time Satan came to God he says do you think God is that job is going to stop because you have a hedge around him this was not God saying that this was Satan saying how did Satan know that there was a around because initially he tried to go without permission and he could not get through and when he failed when he turned around and went back and says there's a hedge around I cannot touch him then God permitted him so nothing can touch you unless God permits it no trial can come to you unless God permits it no sickness no disease unless God permits and by the time he permits it he already know that you're going to overcome he knew that job was not going to curse him that's why he allowed Satan he says go ahead do whatever you want and job stood firm if God knew that job was going to curse him you are going nowhere but because he knew Job was going to Fai in my so whatever you come across sneak away past God God has allowed it to come to you you already know you're going to overcome it so whenever you are in a trial you are in a depression anxiety God has allowed you to pass through that you do the right thing turn around to God I know you are the one who allowed God does not send it he allows it come your you say Lord I know youve allowed this to come my way for my victory now because I know it's certain you have faith in the word of God because he says for every trial way out open door for every disease there's a door called healing for you amen amen so call on the right person just Reach Out and you will be made whole amen amen have faith in that word in question and answers on the Holy Ghost Prophet says that's the death stroke to Satan when a man takes God at his word he says brother that will kill Satan every time it says that's the hardest heating that Satan can get when a man will take God at his word very simple you are not doing too much amen that's a dead stroke taking God at his word he say that will kill Satan not sometimes each and every time so you know when you get to the worded Victory and Satan cannot stand before you hallelujah hallelujah so each and every promise in the book each and every promise in the Bible is for you to possess you take it and apply it to your life amen amen if God tells you to do something you go ahead and do that lay hands on the sick and they so if you find a sick person lay hands on them pray for them it is not your job or your duty to heal them your job is just to do what the word say take him at his word and he'll take care of the rest do the same thing with Noah he told Noah build an ark with the last kind of wood you would expect to build an ark that was the most ridiculous idea people had [Music] heard building an with a of w according to people just going to get in the water suck in the water and Dr but God is a master strategist did not try to reason out with God word I'm doing that started laughing at him science cannot even prove what you were doing but he knew the voice that he had heard that's why you were not supposed to listen to people God tells you to do something you do it it doesn't matter what your thoughts even say what anyone else say because he knows how he's going to take care of so he only needs you take God in his word do what he says you do and then you will have successful results the same people you are criticizing when you prosper they're going to come around and they'll start cheering you how many have ever how many have ever when you are starting out everyone is mocking you that doesn't make sense that's ridiculous but after some time when you prosper they turn around we knew this boy had it knew you could make it and they'll start cheering your that's why you're not supposed to listen to people listen to What God Says after Noah buil the Ark people were laughing at are the ones who ended up coming on the door knocking and they wanted to get in that AR that they were saying will but Noah stood firm stood on what the word of God was saying so God only needs you you and you alone whatever he tells you go ahead and do that in perseverance it says I don't know what he can do by a denomination he says I know what he can do with one man that will surrender himself completely to all he needs one person that's you then he is perseverant nothing is going to stop him amen amen God only needs you and when he tells you what to do go ahead and do it in the Bible many people did ridiculous things God brought Victory Moses went for a onean Invasion with a Crooked [Music] Stick and he overcame a superow taking God at his word amen amen Gideon the Mighty Man of Valor they had Victory they won with only 300 people over an army amen amen by sounding horns something that never happen because they to God at his word god came came through for them so that's all you need to do brother s take God his word it doesn't matter what you're going through it doesn't matter what you have tried or what you have question for you this evening have you tried God cuz if you try him I can guarantee he will never fa amen amen in the Bible read of Elisha [Music] the people had seen elishah walking with Elijah and he was wearing Elijah's coat they knew this man can do the same miracle that El and one of the men was chopping wood and the head of the ex came off and fell into the water into the well and the head of an ex is iron and you know that's the one of the heaviest material there is while chopping the wood the the head of the ex came out and went sned into the well I do not know what were thinking but they went to Elijah and said we want our eggs they went to him I don't know if they wanted him to dive in or what all they knew is if we tell him he's going to give us bake our A Hallelujah they have faith in him because they knew he had the word of God and El took a small stick put it in the water and the eggs came out floating hallelujah hallelujah he was doing Greater Works elij Miracle amen amen and you and me we are the elishah of today after the prophet of God moved off the scene he did not take his holy spirit away that was in the prophet you and me and he wants to do the exact same work that he did in you and me God was using him as an example in as much as I have used used this one I to use you amen so do not go and start crying and say I wish I lived in 1963 I wish I was able to shake his hand well I do I wish I could don't let your problem think that the prophet is gone God is no longer there there the Holy Ghost is still able to do the exact same work opening the eyes of the blind raising the dead why the same way God operated in he wants to operate the same in El so know that nothing can stand before you when you take God at his word and do what he tells you to go ahead and do it that revelation God gives you no matter how ridiculous it sounds do it after you've tried all you can go ahead and touch the ham of His Garment when you touch [Music] your issues will stop he did it for that woman he can do the same thing stand Reach Out And Touch the Lord as he passes by you will find he's
