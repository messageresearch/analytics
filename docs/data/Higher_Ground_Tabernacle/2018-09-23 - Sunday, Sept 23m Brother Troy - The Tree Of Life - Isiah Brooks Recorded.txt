income fire is great love in chattering ah hey man hallelujah are you living by faith this morning hey man does he may fill me alarm amen let's just as we stand we'll get into the word of the Lord let's turn our Bibles to the book of Genesis chapter 1 I want to speak a message this morning called The Tree of Life amen amen the Tree of Life who is Christ what is the anointing and why did he come amen Genesis chapter 1 will read the second verse and it says and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters amen from there we'll go to proverbs chapter 8 verbs chapter 8 we'll start with the 22nd verse it's a long read all the way to the end of the chapter it says the Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old I was set up from everlasting from the beginning or ever the earth was when there was no depths I was brought forth when there was no Fountains abounding with water before the mountains were settled before the hills was I brought forth while as yet he had not made the earth nor the fields nor the highest part of the dust of the world when he prepared the heavens I was there when he said a compass upon the face of the depth when he established the clouds above well he strengthened the Fountains of the deep when he gave to the sea his decree that the waters should not pass his commandment when he appointed the foundations of the earth then I was by him as one brought up with him I was daily his delight rejoicing always before him rejoicing in a habitable part of the earth my delights were with the sons of men now therefore hearken unto me o ye children for blessed are they that keep my ways hear instruction and be wise and refused or not blessed is the man that heareth me watching daily at my gates and waiting at the posts of my doors for whoso findeth me find if life and shall obtain favor of the Lord but he that sinneth against me wrong with his own soul and all they that hate me love death a may well one more scripture let's turn over to Matthew chapter 28 a man that same spirit is still brooding the sentence today this mornin isn't he and Matthew 28 will go read the eighteenth verse on down says and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I am with you always even unto the end of the world maybe let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we just approach unto you reverently this morning Lord knowing that you have ordained us to have a service this morning father and you even ordained it 2,000 years ago saying that where two or three are gathered in your name Lord that you will be right there in the midst of the Father so we just want to thank you for coming into this room this morning father we give you the highest place and all reverence do into your name Lord Lord we just surrender our lives before you Lord and confess all of our sins Lord and asking for your forgiveness of all of our foolish ways Lord and praying father those we have gathered Lord that you would touch us and refresh us again this morning Lord that we might find our peace with you face-to-face with you and Lord as you still are brooding over the darkness father if there be any darkness in our lives father Lord that you would cause it to pass away with a in peace father Lord and forgiveness of our sins Lord we would find peace with you this morning Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you can be seated Amen I want to speak this morning on the Tree of Life you know if you remember that when God created the heavens and the earth that he created a garden called Eden Eden amen and in this garden he placed a treat he called this tree The Tree of Life amen and known when when when God first began creation he there's two things that he did before the creation I know I spoke of several times before he created the heavens and the earth there was a couple things that he did beforehand amen and before he created the heavens and the earth he he he wrote a book called life amen and he put names on on that book amen and when he created that book of life he took a lamb and he's slaying its LeWitt before the foundation of the world for those names Amen so that before time ever began before one second of time ever began before there was ever one sunrise amen before before one tree ever sprouted amen God made sure that there were that those names that were upon that book called life would have would be sure a man that there be a sacrifice for them that nothing could happen to those names a man it was decreed before the foundation of the world that those names would have the Lambs life amen and then all the the pathway was made sure that those names would get the life of the Lamb amen so when God began to create the heavens and the earth amen that the dearths had become dark and void amen and it was empty and it was flooded over with waters and there was no light and there was no land amen there was nowhere that anybody could have rest a man there's nowhere on the life that anybody can have peace amen it was full of darkness and waters had covered over the face of the whole earth hey man there was nowhere to put your feet they meant there is nowhere that anybody could find rest there was no light that you could take comfort in there is no warmth there amen no light no warmth no rest amen it was just there there was no place it was dark his form without form it was void there was no rest there and and and the Spirit of God began brooding over the face of the waters hey man you know God he he had a great desire down on the inside of them he had something that he had seen in his mind amen and as he was brood over the face of the waters there was nowhere that he could leave a mint there was this spirit was there he had desires down on the inside of him a mint he had something that he wanted to do but yet with all that Christ all that that Great Spirit wanted to do as he brooded over the face of the waters there was nowhere that his feet touch ground there is nowhere that he could take his rest there is nowhere that he could live and move and have his bean right amen there is just no where there was nowhere for him there was no light there there was no comfort there a man so is he brooded over the face of the earth he kept brooding he kept brooding and the desires they were on the inside of his mind he began to speak them out amen amen and God by his spoken word began to create a place that he could take comfort him Amen a place that he could enjoy a manatee and he began to separate the the land from the waters amen and he called the the dry land he called it Earth a man and he called the waters seas and he began to to to give the oceans their names and began to gave the land its name earth so now there's oceans and their seas than oh there's dry land and when God began to kept brooding and brooding and he said let there be light over all this same it as God he he as he saw the great darkness first he spoke he said let there be light I like the way God works amen you know there was a time that I was in darkness Amen I was you know I didn't know where I was going and God spoke and brought a light upon my path they said let there be and there was let there be and there was let there be and there was a man so as he kept brooding and brooding remember God what God when he created headon didn't just say let there be animals he spoke to the earth he said let the earth bring forth animals amen and when God when he wanted to create the fish he didn't just say let there be fish he spoke to the waters he said let the waters bring forth the fish Amen but when he wanted to create man he spoke he didn't speak to the earth Amen he didn't speak to the waters but he spoke to himself he said let us bring forth man in our own man image a man a windy and went man when he and his okay so the I saw as the fish began swimming in the sea a mint as he spoke to the earth let the earth bring forth all the plants a man and let the earth bring forth all the all the animals that are creeping on am a man and as he began created as they began going about there he says the Indies are the generations of the heavens and these are the generations of the earth these are all the things that the earth brought forth a man this is the gene that the God placed his word into the waters God placed his word into the dirt amen and the waters and the dirt began bringing forth that which what the Word of God was down on the inside bringing forth a mesh so that the DNA of God's Word starts sprouting up out of the waters amen and they eat in the waters bore forth the fishes and the whales and things are in the seas amen when God's DNA of his own word was there aught down on the inside of the earth it began spreaking forth that portion of the word that was allotted to it amen and those trees have their seed down on the inside of them and there are faithfully generating generation after generation after generation after generation and so are the fish to have their seed down on the inside of them are bearing fruit another generation after them and another generation after them and then continuing on with that DNA of God's own word that was placed down on the inside another generation and another generation but when God spoke to his own self he said let us generate let spring forth man after our own image that God's own DNA was placed into an image that was likened unto God amen and God at this time was still a spirit brooding over the waters a man he was still a spirit that was brooding over the earth still trying to find a place that he could take a home inside of amen God was still a spirit he remember he had brooded over the waters there was no rest there there is nowhere that got me but it could take their rest there was no comfort there there was no light there but as God began brooding it became greater and greater and greater a man when God said let there be a image liken unto me now I remember that image was really just an empty shell it was an image like unto God but it was and then he took that image and he made it into his own likeness and he made his own place his own spirit on the inside of that amen and then when he took that he breathed the indeed form took some of the dirt of the ground and he brutally put it into a little pile and formed it into exactly what he wanted to look like and then he took him Oh his own self and placed it there a man became a living soul amen and God has says I now have a son he wrote down in the annals of God's own word this man called Adam is the son of God amen the the earth bore generations these are the generations of the earth these are the generations of the heavens but here's Adam the generation of God amen the man after God's own image God now has a place where he can take rest a place where he can commune a man a place where when when God took his son Adam I'm he brought forth all the animals before Adam to see he said the Bible says so that God could see what he would name the animals and when now Adam began speaking out just like his father spoke out and you know what God was not surprised at anything Adam said when God created the Garden of Eden over in the east and he placed his son there to keep the garden God was not surprised at anything - Adam did a man God said let them have dominion over the earth let them have dominion over the fish let them have dominion over the cattle and he took any place - Adam there in the Garden of Eden and he says you want you to live here and when he can when God says but now I am placing trees and the midst of the garden and when he placed the Tree of Life there in the midst of the garden I placed the tree the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you know when when God spoke to Adam he said don't you take the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil but he never said anything about take not taking the fruit of the tree of life he never said anything against taking the fruit of the tree of life because Adam and the tree of life were to be one a man there were to be united together they are to be flesh of the flesh what they are to be united together but he did not he wanted a separation between that which was generated of the earth that which was generated of the water and that which was generated of God there had to be a separation there and God the one commandment he said not all had been you know peace and butterflies as we say up until that point but now God lays down the law he says let there be a separation Amen between you and what was generated of God and what was generated of man or what was generated of the earth now this this this generation let this tree here I'm placing in the midst of the garden don't partake in the fruit of this a man God placed the separation amen and go Adam as the Son of God was dwelling there and missed the garden he had access to the Tree of Life access full access to the Tree of Life about it full access though the very spirit that was brooding over the face of the waters that create all this there is no separation there was no heart there was no enmity between God and man there's there is there's there's God and His creation were one amen God had a place where he could dwell God had a place where he could come and visit God had a place where he could come and commune amen God and man had a commune together amen God had a son a man and his son had dominion over the earth amen now that tree there we read there in Proverbs was called the Tree of Life or what is life what's God God is the only thing that's life you know long life came from God when when knowing when when God wrote the book of life what was he doing he was placing his own ability his own portion there and allowing us to be partakers of that life amen he was creating for us to be part of that life Amen so so when you come to proverbs chapter 8 he says he says when he gave to the sea his decree that the water should not pass his commandment when he appointed the foundation of the earth then I was by him as one brought up with him Iowa's daily his delight rejoicing always before him rejoicing the habitable part of the earth why did God rejoice in the habitable part of the earth he says and my delights were with the sons of men a man God had a desire to be one with the sons of men God was it was expressing himself in the sons of men so it there would be another expression and then they had their seed within themselves so there would be another generation and another generation another son of God another son of God another son expressing God's own word expressing the attributes of God and then there'd be another generation expressing but what happened sin cut it off amen but God the but the the plan from the beginning was a God he says I was by him as one brought up with him I was daily as delight rejoice and always rejoicing the habitable parts of the earth my delights were with the sons of men but what caused the separation amen when sin came in amen a man broke the dividing line man crossed over to the particle to where we were not supposed to go amen but what happened to the tree of life now where did he go amen now this tree was a eternal life tree a man it was a is a tree that bore was a source of eternal life amen giggling God when God took them out of the Garden of Eden he put the the swords there he says the flames of fire flashing before the gates of Eden he drove man out and they could not come back in he says I'm driving them out so they don't partake of the tree of life and live forever amen you're always if they would have in their own sinful self if they could have partaken of the tree of life than what would man be eternally sinful a man think about it Amen you know think about it would man be eternally simple how could God and sin be United it cannot be how can man once he is united himself with sin partake of the tree of life and live forever a mess so so man hos now separated from eternal life the tree of eternal life now this tree was a source of eternal life a man and remember there is only one source of eternal life amen if man and God said in Genesis that unless man would eat of this tree of life and live forever so that tree was a source of eternal life well well where is it it's got to be around here somewhere a man do you realize that the same spirit that brooded over the waters in the beginning that spirit was eternal life amen that spirit was he turned of life and as they kept brooding it kept broody it became personified there in that tree a man he was placed in the midst of the garden so that man could have access to eternal life but when man was all sudden kicked out of the Garden of Eden he was separated from what eternal life and that eternal life is God amen so God was the Tree of Life a man so but now even though man was separated from that tree he couldn't get back to that tree but if you notice that throughout history that there were visitations throughout history where angel beings would speak to people and they say I am come from the throne of God to speak to you or angel and tiny white would come and speak to them you know like an angel came to Jacob has said I am the God that you worship there at Bethel a man or an angel will come and speak to him you who are looking for a child and I am going to give you that child there's thirst thirst when a man found himself stricken with death like a woman who had a Barren womb was and couldn't have children all sudden their being angel at visitation and that which was dead we're all sudden spring to life amen and a generation would come out of them they meant why because all sudden that tree of life that they that man was stricken away from came and visited them all the mercies of God amen think about yeah I would think about Abraham when he was worshiping the heathen idols and they're down there in the earth child ease it all sudden he had a visitation and God the tree of life came to him and started speaking to him amen now he was part of he had been part of that curse but yet there was a part of him that was beyond the curse because his name was written upon the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world so even though he was there in the ur of Col deze he's worshiping heathen idols there is a part of him that was still Oh still back over beyond fellowshiping with the Tree of Life and that could not be taken away from him think about it oh my I think about the the why did God visit Abraham as I said I was talking to someone once in the airport there there there say they were talking to me about salvation and they are theirs they're telling me oh you're thinking you're thinking that you're that there's more than just the blood the earth preaching the blood plus this and the blood plus that I mean they all we got to do is believe and speak the name of Jesus and we're safe you know and that's all we know psyche was I say you you have it all you're twisting my words I so I asked him I said when was Abraham saved when did Abraham inherit salvation because if you are a child of Abraham you have to be saved the same way Abraham was so as Abraham was he saved well he meant milk hesitate no he was saved before that a man was he saved when when when when God gave him the promise of you shall have a son no he was saved before that amen what was he saved when he crossed over the border into the Promised Land when his foot crossed the border into the Promised Land was he safe here and unsaved back here no no no no he was saved what before that no I don't know when when he was an Arab Chaldees and God told him separate yourself from your kindred and remove yourself is that when he was safe no he was safe before that well now so when was he saved he was saved when God and his eternal thinking took a book and started writing the name Abraham on a book of life and Abraham was forever linked with eternal life how beautiful is that so when when God when God's Word found itself placed upon in the earth of Abraham and Abraham came springing up out of the ground amen life eternal life was there but yet that that Earthborn creature that he was dwelling inside was separated from the tree of life by the Kurtz a man he had a journal life but he has separated from eternal life but yet the eternal wife kept visiting him kept visiting him kept busy in him why is it it's that same spirit that same Holy Spirit that brooded over the darkness was now brooding over Abraham oh isn't that glorious the same spirit that brooded over the creation when the earth was created now had found another another body that was in darkness another body that was separated from the promise of what it could be another body that was separated from his full potential and as the Spirit of God was brooding over Abraham it brought it was bringing Abraham back to what was written of him before the foundation of the world amen and I think right now where is Abraham today now as Abraham did he you know he died his body was placed inside of a cave somewhere and a stone was roll across the cave now maybe if we were to go over to Israel and look for that cave and we went in there what would we find nothing because there was a there was a man by the name of Christ Jesus that died upon the cross and went and now that now who was this man Christ Jesus now now let's go to John chapter 10 now when was Abraham saved before amen before Abraham was saved before hey man but yeah he was separated from eternal life but eternal life kept visiting him visiting him visiting him this entire life was a testimony of the visitation of eternal life amen so no no no now the body of Abraham grew old amen now God change him back to a young man again but then what happened he grew old and died and they took that body he placed it inside of a cave in a very specific location that God told him to be placed and he says go and purchase this field you know and all that and then he'd be buried right here and put the put the stone over the cave and let your body just sit there and wait why because there's a promise there's a promise now there's something happened to Abraham's body it died now why did it die because he was separated from eternal life eternal life says you will never die eternal life says you will never die but he was separated from eternal life so his body even though eternal life kept visiting him but it still his body grew old and then died and had to be placed inside of a cave amen but when but when but when bowing Christ died something happened now let's go to John chapter 10 verse 10 who was Christ you eternal life he was the source of eternal life amen that same tree has now visit us again in the midst of time amen John 10 verse 10 says the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy but I am come who to who is I that's Christ the only source of eternal life amen I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly amen now he's not just talking about the natural life that we live here amen that grows old as our body weakens down but he's talking about that same source of eternal life that same spirit that brooded over the darkness in the beginning now is standing here in the midst of the creation in the midst of time saying I'm here amen now there's a thief that has come kill and destroy he's come to drag your body down into the dust he's come to drag your body down into this but I am come that you might have life and that you might have him more abundantly what was happening The Tree of Life appear to you oh my now think about now they had been separated from this tree back over in the Garden of Eden God told him and said put the flaming swords of fire there at the gate of the Garden of Eden and told man you can't go back in there you've been separated from that tree that you used to enjoy that tree you said and now you're gonna grow old that day you eat thereof that day you shall die and Adam grew older and older and older and finally died amen and he and his body waited there what was he waiting for that there might be a way back to the tree of life amen and when the tree of life came back here in John 10:10 he walked upon the earth for what 33 years that same spirit that brooded over the darkness in the beginning now has brooded together another body a body has so prepared for me amen and in what just like back in the beginning he brooded another body amen he formed a body inside the Virgin Mary amen he spoke his word to her right he spoke his word to her and he placed his word he called out to Mary and placed his word inside of her and that word began to bring forth and bring forth and what was born out of her was the Word of God Jesus Christ the word of God and the word became flesh and dwelt among us amen and that word was the Tree of Life it was the same tree that we were separated from the same tree that we were cursed away from was now back here on the earth again the only source of eternal life was back amongst Mint's that man again and whosoever believes on him will have eternal life amen don't you see what Christ is doing he's making our restoration he's making things alive again amen that which was brooded that remember the whole plan of God from the foundation was that he is brooding over an earth that was in darkness but he couldn't have a place to land he didn't have a place to rest he didn't have a place he could be comfortable amen but now when he when the tree of life was there in the garden a man but man got separated from it and they no longer had access to the Tree of Life but now we see here 2000 years ago that the Tree of Life reappears again a man in a place called Jerusalem as walking amongst men amen and then he gates that tree of life gave was named the Lord Jesus Christ amen and that tree gave forth certain promises amen to us he says that if anybody would believe on my name he says go into all the worlds and be he said behold in Matthew 28 behold all power in heaven and earth is given unto me all power in heaven and earth is given unto me the tree of life amen go into all the world and baptize them into my name the tree of life a man could they'll confess their sins repent of their sins repent of the separation right amen and then they'll be reunited by baptism back into the tree of life amen and it doesn't matter what happens to their body it doesn't matter what happens to him from that day forward but if they go down into the waters baptized I will place my life on the inside of them amen and they will have eternal life again now let's go back to Abraham where is Abraham where did he go where did he go that he died at age 150 160 somewhere in there they placed him in a cave and then they and he stayed in that cave as his body began to decompose there and he stayed in that cave for about 2,000 years and all of a sudden when the tree of life reappeared on earth again and that tree of life was nailed to a Roman tree and when the tree of life was new the Roman tree Danny when he died the the there was a great darkness and the earth became dark and there was a great earthquake and the tombs were opened and and all of a sudden the body of Abraham sprung back up to life again and I want to put up in the glory why he met the tree he had been separated from the tree all those years oh and the tree of life reappeared he was taken up into glory just think about every 2,000 years something happens on this earth every 2,000 years something happens when God created the heavens and the earth the earth began to degenerate again all the way to the time of Noah and about 2,000 years after earth was created you come to the time of Noah and Abraham a man there was just a few hundred years separating Noah and Abraham and when and when the earth was sinned he see he took the whole the earth he flooded with the waters they meant and the earth was all son form and void again and waters covered the whole face of the earth a man but he had one man that was in he had a group of people that were inside an ark floating on the face of the waters and the earth again was in a Suz form without shape it was round without shape a water had covered the face and what was it out of this little Ark all sudden flies a dove and it's looking it's lookie it's looking for a place to land and this Dove could not find any place for it to land and she went back to the Ark and she was tired and weary she was looking for a place to land looking looking looking and as in all sudden he goes out a couple more time and anyone othertimes she and what she brings forth a leaf from an olive tree and comes back to Noah I know it says God peace between God and man has restored the brooding over the waters as fish and then when the ark set about on the Mount Ararat and God opened the door he goes forth it was it was like another Garden of Eden man was restored back he told he told Noah be fruitful and multiply and gave them the same word that he gave to Adam amen what life was restored to the earth again a man they had the Dove there amen and peace with God again amen they built an altar amen and worship God now another 2,000 years went forth and what happened Christ was nailed to the cross and what happened the earth was bathed in darkness again and there was a great earthquake and the tombs were open and those that trust in the Tree of Life and the lamb wrote went up to glory with him a man but where do we stand that we stand the Gentiles were in gross darkness amen we're without form and void but the Spirit is still brooding and looking for our people the tree of life is still here he's still brooding he's still looking for people every two thousand years something happened say men and the promise of God is broken forth upon other people a man now we're at the end of what this third period of 2,000 years yeah 2,000 years from the creation to Noah and Abraham you had 2,000 years from Noah under Christ now you've had two thousand years from Christ unto today and where do we stand we have been separated from the tree of life amen now if we took a time machine and went back 2,000 years we could see that tree nailed to a cross now if we could take a time machine and go back in time we could have fellowship with that tree how many would like to do that wouldn't that be great to go back and watch him preach the Sermon on the Mount wouldn't it be great to go back and and be in the boat with the disciples as the waves were crashing and the boat was and here Jesus was asleep in the bottom of the boat wouldn't it be great would that be great to be on the road to emmaus listening to the disciples talk with the risen Savior think about when Christ died and rose again or died and rose again and spent 40 days appearing unto men if we could have a time machine and enter in that day and go back Oh wouldn't that be great to go back but the tree of life left he was taken up in the glory and the book of Acts as you read there in Acts chapter 1 about how Jesus was staying and they're talking to him and all of a sudden that he is talking to him and all of a sudden he starts ascending up and as they watch him he started ascending up he's the tree of life the Tree of Life is being separated from them once again now they did they spent three-and-a-half years with this tree of life and now the tree of life is ascending ascending ascending and they're getting he's getting further away and further away and further away they're being separating once more from the tree of life and they're standing there and all of a sudden the book of Acts says that a cloud obscured him so they could see him no more and they're standing there looking up like this and just looking up in the sky and looking up in the sky and God had to do something to change their focus because remember when Christ started ascending the Bible says in acts 8 a cloud obscured and they said they're staring like this God had to do something to change their focus think about how how empty they would feel think about how the very tree that God had given him back to him the tree of eternal life and now it's separate away from them and gave you further and further for the way how would you feel but an angel came and read directed their attention and it says why do you stand here staring like that why are you standing there looking up in the heavens he will return in the same way that he left he says but go back and listen to everything and do everything that he told you to do and their mind focus back to the Word of God he said wait here into Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high what is that power from on high it's the same spirit that brooded over the dark world back in the beginning was promised to reappear unto them the tree of life and so they went into the upper room and they waited and they waited and they waited and did you know that same tree visited them again amen a visit a you know visitations throughout the Old Testament happened over and over and over again you know in Daniels in the lion's den he says an angel the Lord came and shut the lion's mouth a man now he is separated from the tree of life he was in danger of his life and what what the eternal life came and protected his life amen how many women in the Old Testament were barren and all sudden angel said it came and said you have a child and you will bring forth life again well it wasn't the tree of life was visiting them again but now here in the Upper Room this is now this is different this is not just the visitation of eternal life something that will come and then will go but this is a permanent indwelling of eternal life the same the same dove that brooded over the earth in the beginning that had no place to land found a place to land and gave a certain promise that whosoever is baptized in my name can have this promise that I the source of all eternal life I who have been brooding over this earth these four thousand years I have been brooding over the darkness looking live is separated from my creation that I was meant to do and now I have found like like the Dove going back to the ark I have found a place where I can rest my feet and and the Holy Spirit came down like a tongues of fire was resting upon their head I Nelson they didn't see the fire any more now they saw the fire above their head but then it was gone where did they go it went down eternal life anchored down into the soul and he says I will be with you lo always even to the end of the world the tree of life has returned unto men [Music] death oh where is your sting grave where is your victory that which we were separated from back in the beginning all the atom lasts has now been restored back to the children of men it's the Tree of Life wait or has been restored back to the children the seals have been lifted off the book we now see who we are we are the sons and daughters of God Christ has returned to the earth and he has given power all power has given given in heaven earth has been given unto me and now I give that unto you all that was poured into Christ was poured into the church all that was poured into the church amen he is giving it unto us eternal life has been given unto you you see who we are this is who we are we are sons and daughters of God now I remember where is Abraham he has never died he ascended up in a rapture 2,000 years ago after being resurrected at the death of Christ amen and he is still alive amen now where are we we are in heavenly places in Christ Jesus hey man we are not we are in this world but we are not of this world when Jesus Christ was here he could walk through walls he could speak to the leopard they be healed if he was hungry he could create bread right a meant anything that he had need of he could speak the word and it would happen that's what eternal life does that's the power of eternal life why why is that the power why was Christ able to do that because that say in him was that same spirit that brooded over the darkness in the beginning that said let the water separate from the land and he called the dry land earth and he called the water seas now that same spirit was in Christ reconciling the world to himself amen now that same spirit is in you now Christ was able to do all those things because he was the tree of eternal life amen now we were separated from that tree but a man but remember even though we are separate from that tree there has been visitations visitations visitations a man I think every Christian has testimonies about how even before you were saved there was a hand those upon your life and God was guiding you even when you were separated from him amen amen why is it because even though you were lost you still had your name on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world a man so even though you were disconnected from the Tree of Life because your name was back over there there was visitations visitation what's he trying to do he's trying to get back on the inside of you why because it's the dove brooding over the darkness once again amen what trying to restore you back to the son or daughter of God that you're supposed to be from before the foundation of the world a man wants you repent of your sins your repent of the separation your opinion of everything to separate you from Christ then the tree of life comes as restored to you I on the inside you are baptized into his name and you come up out of the water rejecting the things the past your alive under Christ in the future amen and the Tree of Life is now living down on the inside and you are now alive a living son and daughter of God life inside of you Amen so now the same power that was a Christ is now inside of you doing the same things at Christ's day when he was here on earth Amen if you have hungry you can create bread if you're sick you can pray to the Father and he'll heal you if you're if you're in bondage you can cry out for deliverance and the tree of life you'll have to cry out toward the seas over there you don't have to cry up to the heavens you have to speak to the tree of life that is down on the inside of you and he will heal you you speak to the Tree of Life that is on the site he will deliver you why because you are not meant to be separated from him why he brooded over the darkness that was over your life and he found the entrance and now he is on the inside of you Amen why would you want to be separated from him again amen but you through the word you speak the word and you create the atmosphere in your life just like he did it back in the beginning amen he because of the spirit when he when the spirit found itself brooding over a dark formless void he began speaking amen and same thing you when you and your life find yourself dark formless and void and you don't look anything like what you were created to be then you start speaking the words of eternal life over the situations in your life and was eternal life makes things happen once more and now the same way you give permission to the Holy Spirit on the inside to recreate what the DNA of God said would be in the beginning think about it the oak tree out there is bearing testimony to the DNA of God God put spoke his word into the earth said let the earth bring forth an oak tree and down throughout all the generations every oak tree generation after generation after generation God spoke down into the waters and said let there be fish and his word went into the water and a fish was formed and in that inside that fish as the DNA of God's Word and it's generating exactly what his word said over and over again but when God spoke to himself he said let let us bring forth and when he spoke to himself and he placed his word into a form of the earth man was brought up out of the earth and man became a living soul I saw him was given the the he was not he was not listen Adam was never told don't eat from the tree of life Adam was never done until he left the garden he was never prevented from eating from the tree of eternal life and let me tell you since the restoration you are not prevented from eating from the source you eternal life now what is eternal life when Christ can't did Christ ever go to a funeral no he raised a bit Amen one time one time they were carrying a body or they're carrying the casket the pallbearers were walking by carrying the casket and Jesus walked up and the man got up out of the casket and walked off why the Tree of Life that poor man had died was put in the casket he was being carried on the little platform a however they did it back then and all of a sudden it just so happened there's a funeral procession went down Main Street turned onto 7th Street and then walked right by the Tree of Life well what about you you get up out of bed you you kneel down at your chair and you you walk through the doorway you go and you kneel your chair and all sudden you're face to face with eternal life what can happen when a people realize who they are and what they've been called the be what they have been called to do that you have been called to be a repository linked with eternal life and not just that it's not just that God gave you permission to be part of eternal life but God wrote it before the foundation of the world your name upon the lands book of life they will be linked with the eternal life of the Lamb through our history and then he slew the Lamb before the foundation of the world for those named amen where do we stand we live below our privileges we have been given permission remember the angel had to come down let's go to let's go to the book Acts chapter 1 I just want to read that Acts chapter 1 verse 7 Jesus speaking and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you no no sir he just spoke up about power twice right there the first power he said the father has the power over the times and the seasons but you won't know them but the power those within you will amen may ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you should be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria until the uttermost part of the earth now witnesses unto me now who was he he was the tree of eternal life how do you bear witness of the tree of eternal life do you do you give a Sunday School lesson and you break out the books and have the children draw with crayons on the is that the witness of eternal life nothing wrong with that bearing witness of the tree of eternal life is having something down on the inside of you that creates life something that broods over the darkness and when darkness is when you see darkness and something is form and void and when you begin speaking in your prayers and say Lord change the situation and all sudden you are bearing witness and now eternal life is on the inside of you why because life is now being transmitted out of your mouth just like life was transmitted out of the father's back in the beginning you are bearing witnesses to the uttermost part of the earth of eternal life why whenever you see darkness we speak to the darkness isn't that what we were called to do we were called to the speak to the darkness Jesus Christ stir up there one day and read from the scroll he says this the Lord God is upon me because he has anointed me to to bring them out of bondage he is anointed me to bring them captives out of the prisons he is anointing me to the set of brought Loveline to seen a man as a set the captives free he's anointed me what was he anointed with eternal life what are we anointed with all the power of eternal life so what do we do we do the same things Christ did when we see darkness we do the same thing we do the same thing here he saw darkness and he spoke to it and changed the atmosphere we see darkness in someone's life and we cry out against it we speak to it let it be changed by the eternal life that's down on the inside you don't speak off over into the heavens you don't speak off to those side of the seat you speak to the eternal life that is inside of you and then it bears witness on the outs out of you that you are filled with eternal life but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye shall be my witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth and then when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and while they looked steadfastly toward the heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also said Ye men of Galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven they were looking for him to return amen they're looking to see maybe he would show up over here or show up over there or show up in this revival or show up over there but then God had to redirect their attention that God is not going to come back by you gazing into the heavens God isn't going to return back maybe by you going over to this church or to this church or over this revival or over this over here you don't don't seek him this just listen to what he told you he brooded over you he spoke the word unto you take his words and be obedient what he said hey man you don't get it by gazing up into the heavens but you get it by being obedient to his word amen so the angel had to redirect their attention from the heavens over to the Word of God amen which also verse 11 which also said Ye men of Galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven this same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as he was seen him go into heaven and then return they unto Jerusalem unto the mount called Olivet which is a Sabbath's a journey and then we're searching and when they were come in they went into an upper room and they waited upon the word of the Lord amen the word of the Lord that came unto Peter ten days after that said repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be filled with the Holy Ghost and the same spirit that brooded over the darkness in the beginning will come into your life and make the same great transformation the same spirit that brooded over the darkness in the beginning will now come into you after you repent and you're baptized in the name Lord Jesus Christ and it will make the same exact same great transformation on the inside of you you have to be transformed don't you see it's a it's we have to be transformed we can't fail to be transformed if there is darkness in your life you got to be born dove is broody he's looking for a place to land and if there is darkness in your life then the tree of life is no longer separated from you and he will come into you and sup with you and you with him Jesus the tree of life came and said I have come that you might have life I have a more abundantly have you experienced this abundant life don't fail this abundant life it's not just not just that oh well someday Christ will return and then maybe all we deliver from life I'm in but no right now you know I think about the stages of life a lot you know when you're you know you know when you're a child your life changes every three years every three years your life is completely different tell you about 21 years old and from then on your life changes about every seven years and every seven years your life is completely changed from seven years previously and you know and and and the phases of life you know as you grow up you're learning you own every child you know he has he wants to go out and play he wants to go out and do this he own he has desires he wants to go and play and do this and you have to kind of redirect him to do his chores and redirect him to do this you know but as he grows up to be a teenager you know it all of a sudden those great desires of life start going in of what you know is you get to be you know 12 13 14 15 16 years old and the desires of life come upon you and you want to go off over here and be independent want to go off over here and do this and you want to go find a mate for life for a girl or a boy or something like that you want to go get a job you want to be your own person the only ones get to be 18 19 21 years old you know you want to be you know go get your own house and you have all these grand desires you know but when a person no matter what stages of life they're in you know when you get to be in your 20s you know you you're just trying to find a decent good-paying job you know you're trying to get started in life by time you're in your thirties you're getting established by your 40s you've probably marked your career path out by time in your 50s you're starting to look and look forward in the future and wondering when you can retire and buy time of your 60s your body is declaring the death is upon it you know and and yes it's looking forward to retirement and where you can live at ease and in the 70s and you're just enjoying life you know and but you know every phase of life comes with its own desires its own once its own something it wants to accomplish but no matter where you are at what stage of life you're in when the Holy Ghost comes it doesn't necessarily do away with those desires it comes and redirects those desires according to the purpose of eternal life so that you don't have to go and and like if you're a teenager or go and find a worldly go for it you go and find a godly go for amen you don't go and find you and find your direction of life you'll go off in an ungodly direction you go off in a godly direction the only when you're in your 20s you know and you want to go get a good job you know you think well yeah you know a truck driver for a beer company or something but all of a sudden the Holy Ghost comes and it changes your direction and now you are doing the things that God asks for you you know and you know each stage of life whatever stage of life you're in the Holy Ghost comes and provides you Direction leadership why because the Holy Ghost is here the same tree is here to lead you and to eternal life and no matter where you are if darkness tries to overcome you whatever phase you're in eternal life is here it's the same visitation Oh over and over again wherever you are the holy spirit eternal life is here and he's here to brood you and over you and build you into you what he had in his mind before the foundation of the world you know and any man can go and look at the the calendars that they have for sale out there or the the pictures you know of you know you know you know sunsets and you know and some remote island out there with a palm tree over it or or the great mountains of the snow-capped mountains and we say oh my ass beautiful why is that beautiful because it was a created by eternal life those things we look at them and they're pleasing to our eyes because they're beautiful because they were created by eternal life that same eternal life is here to brood over you and whatever he has seen in his mind for your life is just as beautiful as what you see in those pictures and more and he is now brooding over you to create on the inside of you something as even more beautiful than what you see there if you would just submit to it a man when God put his word into the waters whatever came out of it was beautiful when God put his word into the earth whatever it was was beautiful when God spoke to the land and let's said let the dry land appear look we just see all the dry land appeared but look what it appeared into the mountains and the islands and all the creation and it's beautiful whatever God does is beautiful but now God is here speaking to you and yet we stand off from him think about it just like God separated Adam from the tree of eternal life but then when the Tree of Life comes to us we put up our own barriers and separate ourselves from the Tree of Life and now it's no longer God separating us from eternal life it's us separating our own selves and it's no longer that the the darkness is just there but it's we allow the darkness but the Tree of Life is still here and the visitation is still here the Tree of Life is still visiting and he's visiting you this morning if you would submit to him why did the Tree of Life say repent be baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I the Tree of Life will come into you I will lead you I will never leave you nor forsake you and I will lead you into eternal life Abraham didn't die he is still walking in the same city where he met Mike hesitating amen he met the mayor of Jerusalem and that mayor took him up into glory you know Jesus said I go and prepare a place for you you know Abraham is there Abraham knows what it looks like why because he followed eternal life and he said I go to prepare a place for you and if I go I will come again so that I can receive you to myself amen but when they stood there they stood staring up into the sky the angels God had sent angels to redirect their attention to go follow the leadership of eternal life amen and so does God need to redirect your attention from time to time because when our direction when our focus gets off eternal life we go into darkness but the visitation comes again to focus you on eternal life and let me tell you it'll be beautiful no matter what phase of life you're in right now no matter what the deep desires are of your heart no matter what it is that you want to do with your life where it is where you want to go what do you want to be or what do you want to come or or what you're looking forward to whether you're young or whether you're old the visitation is still right here eternal life has visited us this morning eternal life came through that curtain this morning and he is walking up and down this Isles he said wherever two or three are gathered in my name ie eternal life will be right there in the midst of you and I'll be waiting I'll be knocking on your door waiting trying to get in won't you let him in amen you might think that you know what's best for your life but the one that brooded in the beginning is the one that knows how to create something beautiful and he wants to create something beautiful in you no matter what desires is you have or where you want to be eternal life is here brooding right now brooding over you inviting you once you let them in amen brother Isaac if you Gary to come let's just stand
