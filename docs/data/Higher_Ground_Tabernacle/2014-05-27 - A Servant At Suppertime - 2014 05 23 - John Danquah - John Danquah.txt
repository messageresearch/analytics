Thanksgiving amen amen amen tonight I just want to take uh uh two scriptures here for us to read uh Revelations chapter 19 thank you my precious brother from vers uh 7 to9 and then we'll take uh Luke chapter 14 and then try and those two scriptures tonight and uh seek the mind of God for us let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints amen and he says unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he says unto me these are the true sayings of God Amen let me read vers 10 and I fell at his feet to worship Him He said unto me see thou do it not I am thy fellow servant and of the Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of of Prophecy praise the name of the Lord amen Luke chapter 14 from vers 14 s 15 and when one of them sat at meat with him heard these things he said unto him blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God Amen then said he unto him a certain man made a great supper and bade many and sent his servant singular at supper time to say to them that were biding come for all things are now ready hallelujah amen and they all with one consent began to make excuse the first said unto him I have bought a piece of ground and I must need go and see it I pray thee have me excuse if he's praying it he was religious another said I have bought five yolk of oxen and I go to prove them I pray the have me excused another religious one another said I have married a wife therefore I cannot come so that servant singular came and showed his Lord these things then the master of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly into the streets and Lanes of the city and bringing he the poor and the m and the Hal and the Blind and the Sant singular said Lord it is done as thou Hast commanded and yet the room and the Lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and hges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled amen verse 24 for I say unto you that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper be see the Saints be seated please blessed be the name of the Lord how many love the Lord Jesus Christ yes and for just a short scripture I would just read John chapter 6 and 26 uh from verse 27 lior not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which endureth on everlasting life where the son of man shall give unto you for him has God the Father sealed then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of God listen to questions it is what shall we do that we might work the works of God Jesus answered unto him this is the work of God that you believe on him whom he has sent so if you want to do the work of God believe on the one that God has sent that's the work of God but see that answer is too simple we are looking to build hospitals and uh and schools and uh and and pride in our merits yeah yeah yeah once you fail to recognize the one that God sent how can you truly do the work yeah so I will start with just a quote here and I want to preach on the the servant at supper time yeah amen but Bram in talking the message in his presence uh says here that uh this is the time to shake people this is the time that God said that there will come a time he shook Mount one time but there will come a shaking again yeah that he wouldn't only Shake Mount but he will shake everything amen that could be moved but did you not the rest of the scripture but we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved everything that can be sh shook will be shaken the heavens will shake the Earth will shake heaven and will pass away but that word shall never pass away for upon this I will build my church and the Gates of Hell will prevail against everything that can be shook will be shaken amen but we receive Kingdom which is the word of God himself amen and God is his word he don't shake himself but we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved it's unshakable Hallelujah yes Lord such a person and such a time we have also ourselves we have seen the glory of God like those men did we've seen it we've seen the glory of God like Abraham saw it we saw the glory of God like Moses saw it same Pillar of Fire same power amen the same Christ revealing himself showing himself keeping his word in the last days how can we come by then and walk and treat it so lightly how can we walk around and hold to our cre denominations and not take the word of God what will it be for us in that day how will happen to us when we have seen the glory of God hallelujah some people will stand off and they'll make fun of it yeah some will laugh at it some will call it fanatism some will call it mental telepathy some will call it B some will call it one thing or another as the old prop is fools will walk with hot nail shoes Where Angels Fear to tr the fool has said in his heart there's no God when he sees God manifested so perfectly by his own word not by Creed but by his word amen and then what right over it and make fun of it he's a fool but that is uh CU what God that God is the word and God himself plainly uh uh God himself plain to them and he's a fool who will it be for him when he has to stand in that place it will be terrible for that man in that day the ungodly I said this just to say that uh we are going home now amen amen and and and and before any Revival ever produced the the the real of the crop that follows it they got to be a shaking am you know the Shar got to be separated from the wheat am and so it it's all part of God's plan and program yes sir you know we've not come this far for somebody come and tell me some intellectual come and tell me that try to reason the word of God the rest of God the word of God was not made to be reason it was made to be believ you need to have faith because see without faith you can't please God am it is impossible for anybody to truly worship God outside of Faith amen and and was talking about the faith we talking about here it's not even the emotion to believe yes sir yes sir we talking about the Revelation that God gives to you that nothing can move you out of it so we are here thinking right now that we are about to go home in the Rapture yeah but the Bible the word rapture is not in the scripture but when B Bram came and Jesus came the Book of Revelation uses the word supper yes Jesus calls it the great supper amen therefore the Rapture is not a morning message no sir Hallelujah that was for baby Luther yeah afternoon message was for Wesley but if it's a supper time am there is an evening time setting and if it's an evening time setting we have to watch closely the scriptures as God and Jesus Christ begin to bring the event that should bring it yes people are trying to do the works of God all these men who are on the internet trying to do the work of God yeah trying to prove the message wrong yeah you know people are specializing to make sure that the message is wrong yeah a man spent his whole life finding mistakes of the message yeah thank god brother brandham said if you come to church and you want to find mistake you find a lot amen amen you know so because they set to find mistakes they are finding all kinds of mistakes but there's no mistake in God because all things work for good yes yes yes even when Abraham told lie it became a blessing amen yes sir when Jacob crossed his hands it was a blessing I I see a lot of things in the Bible but I believe it yes that the Bible is the word of God that the scriptures is inspired am and yet still the Bible is the life story of men amen come on it's Adam yeah it's eve yeah it's a serpent yeah that mess up yeah our mother amen do we throw her away God came back and had Redemption Hall it's about Abraham yeah he made mistakes yes sir yeah yeah yeah he listened to his wife yeah he took hagga uhhuh P ishma mistakes I will show you a lot amen and yesterday the Bible say Abraham staggered not amen at the promise of God unbel so I want to know how they came to the message so here Jesus is saying here that come on brother a certain man made a great supper now this supper is the rapture yeah yeah because we are going to sit at his feet amen could you imagine that table we're going to S Isaiah you right over the KE the corner yeah amen hallelujah the corner over there and we look at one another and wonder oh say Lord Jesus thank you for making it possible for us see it said but this supper that the man made he actually invited and beat many yeah yeah yeah many came were had invitation to come to this supper a which means that God was going to do something to give almost everybody a chance everybody an opport to come to this supper that he's about to make amen but the scripture says that all of them with one consent began to make excuses now there's nothing wrong in owning a business there's nothing wrong in having a car ran there's nothing wrong in buying a land or field as nothing wrong in my yeah I'll be performing the marriage very soon when I get home yeah but you see when those things Hallelujah become your obsession yes and then those things overtake you when you cannot seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness before you add any other thing to it it becomes a curse so the first man comes in and tell and I think this is a setting of lodia yeah lisia because when Jesus came they are going to reject him amen why they same rich I have need of nothing I I I I I don't need no healing power from God I got good doctors who will take care of me I don't need anything to ask God for material blessing because I got too much yeah and the excuses that they were given was going to exclude them from the supper amen the invitation was for them to come to the King's Supper am who will want to miss the supper of the king but they allow their businesses they allow their jobs they allow their private and personal life maybe family life to hinder them sometime people say brother did not spend time with his family so what are you the one that call him yeah this is a media complaint she the one who married a man has no problem and you are worried about so so if we if you take your ideology he should be boxed up in Jeffersonville and don't travel nowhere amen when at midnight people are calling him my father is dying my mom is dying and the prophet is sacrificing his life to save people who are snoring and having fun with your wife and come and accuse the prophet now this supper of the king it was the king supper yes but the King has uh designated the invitation in the hand of a servant hallelujah hallelujah if you miss the servant you miss the [Music] invitation the servant holds the revelation of the invite amen hallelujah therefore if you want to come you need to meet the servant and it is not two servants it's not a plurality of servants it is a servant at supper time it is one person am it's a one man Ministry at the end time to bring the people to the serer Hallelujah the king could have come himself but he chose the servant and the servant is the leoan or the the person standing between the public and God Amen God talk to the servant you talk to the servant the servant talk to [Applause] God Amen Revelations 1 just want to identify a few things here Revelations 1 and one Hallelujah the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servant things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signify it by his Angel unto his servant John now listen to be carefully church we are dealing with the revelation of Jesus Christ that God has given to him the Revelation that Jesus Christ has that God gave Christ that Revelation is supposed to be given to John but but John is not getting the Revelation direct amen it is coming through the medium yeah of a servant of an angel in other words if you miss this angel you canot have a true revelation of Jesus Christ that's right Hallelujah listen church that I saw Jesus and when you saw somebody said I saw him he on a white horse another person come come and tell you that oh Jesus Christ is a light yeah anybody can tell you what they want but when the prophet begin to reveal Christ and you cut the revelation of that is different so Jesus in The Book of Revelation chapter one wants his Revelation to come but the Revelation is to be signified by an Angel yes but the brother said John is the type of the Bride amenu let me even bring it closer at the writing of the Book of Revelation 9596 almost all the apostles were dead yes sir yes sir Peter was gone Paul was finished yeah the kill of them yeah the only one remaining was John the revelat yes sir in other words there is a book that you are reading that Peter never read yeah Paul never read are you Church the apostles never read this because this Revelation is for end time people [Music] Glory Hallelujah it is this same servant who began to bring the Revelation so clear that in Revelation 19 and: 9 watch this carefully that John when he brought the revelation of the supper showing John the Revelation don't fell at his feet to worship Him He says see thou do it not amen I am thy fellow servant yes of thy Brethren yes but brother if if you love me call me brother yes I have a testimony of Jesus yes worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy how can people deny the prophetic word and claim to have the testimony of Jesus you cannot do it until God open your eye to the spirit of Prophecy prophesy over the end time for us to get into it amen so this Angel is a servant this Angel is a brother this Angel is one with the testimony of Jesus so he is not an Old Testament prophet he is one of AIA but he one of the New Testament after the blood of Jesus Amen Hallelujah Revelation 22: n and I John saw these things and when I heard them when I had heard and seen I fell down to worship before the feet of the Angel which showed me these things then say he unto me see thou do it not for I am thy fellow servant and of the Brethren the prophets and of them which keep the says of this book worship God Amen now I I'm still going to make a statement here Church come on in other words this angel that is to reveal the word to us will have the ability to break the word so much that John the Revelator in essence the man who saw Jesus and fell at his feet as though dead the men that walk with Jesus upon the face of the Earth seeing this Angel he attempted three times to worship it worship that's right come on it was the angel that told him don't do it amen hallelujah what I'm saying is that because of this the has if the scripture is saying that John fell at his feet and the angel said don't do it we have to see the same manifestation so there has to be a spirit that should come in the end time making an attempt to worship the angel but the angel said don't do it he said if you do it you remove me from the bracket of a brother and you make me an antichrist therefore the angel corrected it he is not the Lord Jesus Christ he's a servant of the Lord Jesus Christ but the angel hold the revelation of who Jesus is hallelujah if you want to do the works of God believe on the one that God has sent amen praise the Lord Brother Hallelujah are you the church so when they rejected the first pool which is L this year they turn it down they said they've rejected it he said go to the highways go to the byways when the Full Gospel businessmen and all those people saw the hand of God opportunity for them to come they were making churches with money in their mind yeah yeah and they got no time Bram the way he don't pull for money they don't like stuff like that the were the people that will come in and bring the cash they wor about their businesses their land and their stuff they got no time for God is said go to the highways go to the byways go to the city and bring me the lame the heart am let me say this new church who of the Ministers of the 20th century are at the 10 of the 20th century about the time of the evening time had the capacity and the capability of the ministry to go around countries yes yes to go to Bombay City to go to Dev South Africa Houston all the Pres in in America to draw the crowd to heal the sick than the ministry of William brandham right that's right that's right that's right nobody had ability nobody he was a servant amen are you the church he went everywhere taking a Healing Ministry to bring in the lame to bring in the house to bring all of them in King King George of Great Britain he was healed yes for his 19 granddaughter she was healed Congressman upsh he was healed these were nothing that in a secret sir these were notable Miracles and the Church of the Living God God still believe in the Supernatural our God is real [Applause] church when he brought them in through the healing campaign that's what the angel told him I'm commissioning you to take a gift of Divine Healing to the people of the world if they refuse the first sign don't see the second one Hallelujah and by Signs by Miracles Untold miracles documented miracles some we don't even know many came and the servant came back and said it's done and then he went he says and yet there is room brother I like that room I like the little room I like the little room hey in the little room there were AR that came in he said I saw them they come in like crippes and they walk out healed amen it's a temp anointing it's a supernatural power amen that heals us our soul spiritually and when the word is open and revealed to a Believer when the word anchor in The Believer Soul the word is your healer and that's what it's supposed to do in your life that's right so what I'm saying to you tonight is that a rejection of the messenger message is a rejection of the king's invitation amen so the people that are on the internet rejecting the messenger of the hour they are rejecting their own Rapture am that's right because in the word they rejected it yes that's it that's it are you are with the church amen and you know the king in scripture uh somebody even said brother brandham did not fulfill Revelation 10:7 see they lack Revelation yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah because let me say something to you uh Revelation 10:7 see the number 17 Place B's Ministry 17 you said brother John what are you talking about let me show a few things 10 + 7 is 17 yeah when he was baptized in the 17 person The Voice open yeah as John the Baptist was sent to forun the first coming of Christ your message will forun amen the second coming of Christ whether you believe it or not I believe it am I don't have to be there because I have accepted whom God has sent his testimony is good for me on the 17th person did you realize that Noah went into the Ark on the 17 Hallelujah yes sir amen yes sir believe Genesis 711 he said hold on let's read that I know he said brother John what is the significant because Noah there has repeated come on brother in the 600 year of noest Life 600 years the year of man number number six in the second month the 17th day of the month the same day where all the fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of Heaven were open the race was upon the Earth 40 days and 40 nights in the S same day entered Noah Shem ham and jaff the sons of Noah and Noah's wife and three wives of his sons into the Ark on the 17th of May that's right they went into the ark why because Luke 17 is a repeat of Noah's anointing back upon the face of the Year yes everything they doing Noah's day has repeated itself in our time not only that but so also has added so we got a double anointing that's why we need both the latter Reign and the former Reign blessed be the name of the Lord church and I just in closing in taking a type uh God in the Book of Esther was showing a type of how this thing is done in Esther chapter 1 we find out that uh verses when you get time just read them all but verse 7 of chapter one said they gave them drinks in vesses of gold I want you to know that those the wine or the drink given was in the vessels of gold and gold is a type of deity yes sir amen amen the vessels being diverse one from another now every time that God reveals himself the Revelation that God gives us is given to us in measure amen that's we can never know more than a messenger amen that's right and you can't no more than your pastor hallelujah amen and Royal Wine Not some cheap wine Royal Wine in abundance according to the state of the king and the drinking was according to law he de compel we don't force anybody to believe this message sir Believers of the message come in by revelation we don't force it we don't pass it on your throat if you love God you worship Him in SP and in truth these people that rejected God God he said your time is coming you don't want to Ser me now go and do your business but I have my day for uh for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house that they should do according to Every Man's pleasure how much you want God in your life is how much you get amen amen hallelujah how much you spend time in studying Amen in praying in fasting Amen in Waiting upon God is how much more you get amen the less time you spend on the word your life life is gone in shambles yeah many Believers today don't have time for the word of God anymore they don't read a prophet anymore and when somebody says something they easy to catch it yeah yeah where are where are the bans where are the bans to compare Every Man's Revelation that's right you know what let me give you a test when you go home tonight read Acts chapter n uh and then Acts chapter 22 and acts says pause testimony about the light and tell me tomorrow if the testimony are the same you find that Paul is giving a testimony that look like he doesn't know what he's talking about yeah yeah amen amen but Paul is a messenger amen do we have to throw the word Away Paul said if an angel come and tell you something I didn't tell you C him and he's giving us a a revelation of a first conversion and things don't yeah yeah yeah the problem is they trying to anine the supernatural yes sir how can I explain the supernatural I cannot explain it I just have to believe it amen so the servant now oh Hallelujah in in in in in in verse 10 of Esther chapter 1 on the seventh day when the heart of the King was married with wine Hallelujah on the seventh day amen on the last day his heart was Marry with wine but on this seventh day the thing that should TR the believer is the revelation of Jesus Christ amen because the revelation of Jesus Christ the importance of Revelation to a Believer can never be overemphasized Revelation means more to you than you think Hallelujah and then hallelujah he tried to get his uh he called mean bigsta habon these seven chamberlains to bring vasty the queen she was beautiful to look upon with a Royal Crown to show the people verse 12 but vas refused to come at the king's commandment see her rejection of the king's commandment by the chamberlains the king did not speak to vity directly he sent his Chamberlain amen and the Chamberlain is a messenger who take the message from the King and brings it to the wife and the wife talked to the Chamberlain he said a message back to God you want to do the works of God believe on whom he has [Applause] sent maybe V just thought well what does it it doesn't matter I would just do my best and you know hey if I don't go who cares her disrespect and rejection of the king is going to cause vity to lose what she is enjoying amen many brothers have enjoyed a privilege to be known they've been authorized song leaders preachers they've done great great great things but now they are turning back and rejecting the very message that has built them who they are amen that has given them the fame amen and what you are rejecting is going to cause you yeah yeah what the people are rejecting is going to cause them the supper amen but VES reject is going to cause her her because why she's now involved with other women she want to be like a denomination yes so she have no time for the message and when the king had that thing it hurt him and the King now was troubled yes and somebody said what's the matter with you King you worried about your wife he said could you imagine the hour of and look at it right now it looked like everybody is troubled and because we don't what why should this brother go here why should and everybody is I I believe that God maybe having his knowing everything going on we sit down and we wonder why should happen that way then they said King rest take other people yeah who are better off than her and let them go through a process that the woman that will please the king the woman that will have a revelation to serve the bride that has a revelation amen of the message of the Chamberlain let her be the wife and church that's what we need we need to have a revelation of this message your father cannot give it to you your mother cannot give it to you they can raise you up but God has to reveal the message to you God now Hallelujah chapter 2 thank you Jesus says that vers two then said the king servants that ministered unto him let there be fair young virgins sought for the king and let the king appoint officers in all provinces of his kingdom that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto shisham the palace to the house of the women on to the custody of Hagi the king's Chamberlain Keeper of the women and let their thief of purification be given them Hagi will going to be in charge of the virgins it's a woman ministry again ha guy the problem with these people is that they cannot accept the fact that God has to use one man in this age to bring for the word amen and they're saying that how can the the voice of a one man be more than the Bible but never said that no he said that come into the word yeah he brought us to the word but you know church right now it is becoming more clearer how Noah preached the gospel and only Noah and his family were saved am now it's becoming clearer that after 120 years of a prophet preaching the word of God nobody came I said nobody came yeah yeah except the man's wife yeah and children amen what do you think happened in no wday they found too many mistakes with his message it has never rained and you say it's going to rain you bring a boat in the forest somewhere where the dry dock yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah amen all kind of questions amen amen vers uh vers three and let the M with please please said the king be Queen instead of Vy and the thing please the king hi his soul amen vers seven he brought up hadassa that is Esther his uncle's daughter for she had neither father nor mother and the M was fair and beautiful for mod when her father and mother were there dead took for his own daughter so it came to pass when the king's commandment and his decree Was Heard and when the mares were gathered together unto sushan the palace to the custody of hagaya that Esther was brought also onto the King's house to the custody of hagaya Keeper of the women now you see the Church of the Living God a woman TI the church yeah God must entrust his church to a prophet a servant that he God can trust with the word amen that's right amen and let me say this the reason why the Kings trust this chamberling because these chamberling are castrated males yeah that's right that's right that's right they Uno yes sir they are men who their life as far as progenation is concerned cannot reproduce themselves that's right which means that they are dead to their own seed amen amen and God need a man like William Bram yes who be dead to his own ideas in fact the only man that we know that if he does a mistake is more than able to come and tell us what the mind of God is and forget about his ideology that's right you love him all right's continue a second vers n and the Maiden pleased him and she obtained kindness of him he speedily gave her things for purification which certain as belonger to her and seven Mar which were me to be given her out of the King's house and he preferred her and her M onto the best place of the House of the women see hagaya had other matings but Esther pleased her from the beginning amen and put her in the best place of the palace Amen brother we brother pre the gospel to the Full Gospel assembl of God everybody else but the of Jesus Christ we have the best hallelujah thank you Lord we have the best message Hallelujah God kept the best for the last Hallelujah vers 11 Mah walked every day before the court of the women's house to know how Esther did and what should be come of her Not only was ha guy but Esa had of all the chamberlains that came she also had a pastor yeah yeah yeah yeah outside the messenger she had a pastor amen called amen who was watching over the Affairs of her life amen how she is doing and God play by the Isaiah over here Amen brother one over here these are pastors that God has raised them up to watch over your soul therefore you cannot stay on a tap Ministry alone you need to sit on a live Ministry I swear to the word yes yes yes modah vers uh 11 is it no uh vers 13 then uh uh sorry sorry 12 12 and when every M 10 was come to go into the king a his us after that she had been 12 months according to the manner of the women for so were the days of their purification accomplished to witness six months with oil of M and six month with sweet odors and with other things for the purifying of the women don't you know that when we take the word it becomes sweet and bitter Hallelujah sweet in our mouth bitter in the B Glory this message cleans you out thank you Lord amen it's it's so sweet that you don't even feel the effect of the sourness Hallelujah because you need to take it and let the some bitter HS are good for you we don't like it but it is good amen true Hallelujah and and it's a process of purification but you don't stop at purification you have have to move on to see the king amen amen yes Judas but says that was justified he said Judas was Sanctified said but Judas could not go to Pentecost he sto short of sanctification could not move on oh blessed be the name of the Lord yes yes so vers 14 or 13 then does every men of to the king whatever she desired was giving her to go with her out of the house of the women onto the King's house now after the Chamberlain has given you everything the day you have to be the king whatever you desire is giving you God has a way of forcing all of us to be content Yeah Yeah by asking for extra things tells you that what the Chamberlain gave you is not sufficient enough vers 14 in the evening she went and on the tomorrow she returned into the second house of the women to the custody of shazar the king Chamberlain which kep the concubines she came unto the king no more except the king delighted in her and that she were called by name now when the 10 of Esa the daughter of Abel the uncle of modah were taking her for his daughter was come to go in onto the king she required nothing nothing Hallelujah but what her gu the king Chamberlain The Keeper of the women appointed amen and Esther obtained favor in the sight of all of them that look upon her you see the difference everybody was taking something with them and whatever you added to the word was rejected yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's good you see in the end time the revelation of the word is so true but people want to add and tell you that Jesus Christ is not God and now they believe in two Lords yeah that's right added Revelation yeah yeah when put two Natures in the soul they call it two Soul added Revelation amen are you with me Church yeah when he say the Revelation that contain in the Seven Seals in seven Thunders they come back and take their virtues yeah I Revelation that's right polygamy added Revelation amen return Ministry add revelation and God purpos it like that take whatever you want yeah but Esther Hallelujah stay with her gu Revelation she stayed with water baptism in Jesus name she stayed with the Revelation that Jesus Christ is God she stay with the Revelation amen are you with the church the true interpretation of M and divorce he broke it down on the grounds of fornication that's it amen am he left the word for us if we stay with what ha gu brought with what a prophet brought we will please the [Music] king the reason is because the secret of the king is with the chamberling and the secret is a seven seat am the seven seal is the secret it is with the prophet the Revelation is a three-fold mystery praise the name of the Lord if we stay with that we're going to be fine hallu so Esther 16 was taken unto the king of hisus into his house Royal in the 10th month which is montith in the seventh year of his Reign so Esther came in at Revelation 10:7 yes that's right on the 10th month of the seventh 10th day is it yeah 10th month of the seventh day amen seventh year it's like ration 10:7 don't you see that and then verse 17 Again watch it and the King loved Esther above all the women and she obtained grace and favor yes in his sight more than all the virgins amen so that he set the Royal Crown upon her head and made a queen in of vity you see on verse 17 here Esther received Grace more than all the other women yes buts we have received the grace of God in this age more than any other Church age amen hallelujah brother because where sin abounds that's where Grace abounds most now this is a corruptible age it's a age where if God did not even intervene in our time no flesh will be [Music] saved received such a special Grace and uh and so here you realize that church the difference between her and the rest is that she learned obedience in the house of modah amen we have to learn our church order how to conduct ourselves now I see brothers who have defected on the message and telling brother the brandham that he preached and the women did not feel good about themselves now they are wearing pants and they feel good they were in short and they feeling good now now they feel good where Jesus Christ when he told you that if a man should last after you you committed adultery do you know what you're doing yeah the prophet gave you the key to protect yourself amen but there is no message that really tells a man how to love his wife than this [Applause] message that's right and there is no messy upon the face of the Earth that tells a woman how to make a husband happy than this message amen you can't throw this away this is life so Esther had one man ha guy Jesus had one man a servant the servant that was revealing the word to John is a prophet is a servant is singular is God's order for the age the supper oh glory be to God Amen and then the king just made this statement all those who refuse the invitation will not make it to my supper to turn down the invitation of this end time is a refusal of your own Rapture you can tear it down but it's a price to pay but brand P the foolish virgins this way he said there are people who rejected the message you see even that they rejected it in what sense it said they were blinded by false prophets and they never heard the message but after you have heard the truth sir and you now claim that the cloud is some Aeroplane jet that went somewhere I'm closing now let me close now continue tomorrow you said what is the confusion but J Smith is testified it's on YouTube now so there there's no shame in this he was being inter you can Google you know when you see Jeff Jenkins resignation you're going to see J Smith somewhere there in the red shirt and he said but brandham was not on Sunset Mountain on the 28th of February he brought his timeline that on the 1st of March the game for javalina uh hunting began that year on the 1 of March the prophet got a call to go to Texas and uh seek for pardon for the for a young man who have been accused of you know trying to kill somebody else Soul so he left came back on the 6th of March and about the 8th of mar the Angels came down and everything went so he was not there on the 28 when they heard that because everybody know but ABR always connected the cloud with the angels but you see before God does anything on Earth he first have to show the signs in the heavens so he doesn't have to be there on the 28th for God to show the sign but it was taken in Flag Staff the very place where the angel coming later so as a prophet he is connecting what the listen he preached the seals in March not knowing about the cloud he never said nothing about the cloud in March in April May 17th it appeared in the magazine he first spoke about it in June and God began to deal with him tell to the right side the face of Jesus is there this is revelation 1 and 17 this is supreme deity he began to connect that to the word why the signs are declared in the heavens before God D upon the earth when John the Baptist said that the Messiah is here amen I don't know him but the one I see the spirit will come I will identify him how did you know the spirit is coming then when Jesus came for the manifestation Behold the Lamb of God that taken away the s i see the heavens open and the spirit of God be sent like a dove was it a dove or like a dove was it a cloud who knows are you with the church so what I'm trying to say is this we don't he doesn't have to be on the 28th because God has to declare the SS in the heavens first amen and then he preached the SE without that the cloud is only a confirmation of the message that is be the truth and once we can get that fixed but we cannot see nothing because I cannot explain the supernatural but because he a prophet I believe it am that's right amen hallelujah amen I believe it because the word is like he said that's your lord out there I believe that that's right amen how can you explain how Moses parted somebody who doesn't understand it the Sea of read what read something that part why don't you go and do it now God parted mer we cannot explain but God did it yes so there are so many things that the almighty God in his own good will will do we are believers because we believe in God all who come to God must fa believe that God is and he is a rewarder of those who diligently seek after him you got to believe First only believe all things will possible so in this supper that we are going mhm it is crucial not to leave the servant out amen because to reject the servant is to reject the message to reject the message is to reject the message from God Amen and if you turn God down where will you go amen amen you know there have been so many overwhelming things that God has done in this age but you see Church people thought over the years that the message is all about God sent a prophet and you come to church and you have long dress and long hair and and they said that's the message see and they never had a life inside of them you know to to to to be dramatized to to to to follow the word you know so butam say that man can have the Holy Ghost on the flesh yes he can have on the spirit and preach good good preachers like Apollo very fantastic preachers prophesy speaking tongues but they don't have a birth are you the church it's when Paul stood and watch Apollo's preach that gospel have you got the Holy Ghost since you believe he said what is that I've never heard of it he said unto what were you baptized he said John's baptism I see your problem John baptized you onto repentance to believe on the one to come they have never come into Christ who is Christ Christ is the word revealed in the hour you are living in how can you question your husband I mean how can a wife a woman that truly love a man huh yes question amen the man's Lord For You amen when you know he's there for you amen amen amen I love him too much too K him now too much to Break My Vow but I promise the Lord that I will make it somehow yes I love him too much let's all stand to him now yes I love him too much to fear Him oh too much to Break My Vow but I promise yes the Lord that I will make it some yes I I love him too much to [Music] fear and you know Church the reason why we come in his presence is because brother Bram says that none of us could have gone to heaven because Jesus is the one that made the way for us he made a way for us to come in don't let us criticize one another and and you know the spirit of God is a spirit of forgiveness that's right is the spirit that can be because bitterness is not good malice is not good we got to come to that fountain that Fountain of love where you be able to express the true genuine love of Jesus Christ look at the prophet pretty and divorce and come back to the seene and said if the truth is preached it will destroy every home amen it's said Lord said he couldn't preach it until first God had to give a pardon [Music] first and brother we have come in some have come in we've still made some mistakes but the blood of Jesus Christ I said tonight is more powerful to clean us from every unrighteousness amen amen hallelujah see let let me just share before I pray when our brother Billy Paul the prophet would not marry him because they had to Anor his first relationship and when he brought sister Lo home she was not a Believer I hope you understand what I'm trying to say amen and I'm not justifying anything but I want to show the grace of God in our lives the prophet did not marry them but after the marriage he prayed for them then he came back and says that's my daughter-in-law she is seeking the Holy Spirit and then he came back and say she got the Holy Ghost now once he got a holy ghost you got to go back to the past leave it because God even though it look awful the Holy Ghost corrects every error that's why by says that the new birth corrects every error he said you may be born a bastor you may not know your father you may not know who gave bir to you but you have the Holy Ghost it corrects all the errors because your your identity is no longer with your Earthly father your identity is with your heavenly father and once he gives you his own Spirit he brings you into the court amen amen amen hallelujah amen precious Lord we thank you for your grace for the wedding supper that you have given invitation to come we thank you for the servant that you use in this age that we have accepted we thank you for the Revelation help us to remain faithful and stay with the truth because it's the only thing that will please you amen the Revelation you gave him was your Revelation is the revelation of Jesus Christ signified by an Angel unto John and John is a type of the Bride am we have received your Revelation by the hand of your prophet to remain faithful help us to remain strong help us to remain obedient help us to take the word help us our to stand upon you we thank you in Jesus name amen come on Pastor God bless you Hallelujah [Applause] amall love [Music] him I I love because [Music] he
