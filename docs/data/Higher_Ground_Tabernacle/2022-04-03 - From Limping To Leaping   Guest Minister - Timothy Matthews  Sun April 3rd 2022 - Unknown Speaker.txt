give honor to our lord and savior jesus christ we thank god for everybody all of you who've come out this morning we trust that god will bless you in a special way we had wonderful services yesterday the young people did drink it all you i hope they left you something we had uh our brother jimmy matthew we did have a [Music] i want you to release god will always take care of things [Music] we and you know he's got a better voice than me and i just thank god his way of worship in his way and the preaching i want him to let go amen are you happy to be in the house of the lord just uh i once again want to just thank brother isaiah for uh having the confidence to ask me to come and to speak i have confused brother isaiah more than once this trip comes my wife is from arizona and she moved down to new mexico they're with me new mexico and uh but i so appreciate her and i'm so glad to have her with me and also my little boy elisha is also there so um just happy now i have another little boy we left at home joshua brother isaiah wasn't the one confused i was the one confused anyhow all right well whatever what little voice the young people left me with i'm going to go ahead and we're going to read verses 1 through 10. i'll read the i'll read the the scripture in english and then we'll have our brother read it in french amen normally i preach in in mexico and this is about the time i say i wish i would have learned spanish now peter and john went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer being the ninth hour and a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful to ask alms of them that entered into the temple who seeing peter and john about to go into the temple asked and alms and peter fastening his eyes upon him with john said look on us and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of them then peter said silver and gold have i none but such as i have give iv in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up then immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength and he leaping up stood and walked and entered with them into the temple walking and leaping and praising god and all the people saw him walking and praising god and they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the beautiful gate of the temple and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him complexity um amen thank you for your patience and the reading of the word you may be seen yesterday i spoke to the young people concerning the new birth a subject i believe has been greatly neglected by most churches and uh without the new birth son of the renaissance you just your service to god will be in vain brothers without the new birth you just have a bunch of church members that have learned to follow a system and they're just playing church and i believe a lot of young people yesterday received uh of the holy ghost and we just thank the lord for that because only the lord truly can give somebody the spirit and so anyways this morning i'd like to preach to you on a little subject that i've entitled from limping to leaping uh i'm just going to take off my jacket because i guess that's just what i do can you say praise the lord all right uh we can imagine now peter and and james and john and the rest of them how they came out of the upper room [Music] and courageous and they came out all stimulated under the power of the holy ghost and so uh as they're coming up to this man they're not coming up uh in the flesh but rather they're coming up to the gate in the spirit i'm going to read some uh quote here now from the message the children of israel 1947. brother adam said don't never come in a prayer line unless you're expecting to serve god the rest of your days we don't just come haphazardly or or just for the sake of coming see i don't know about you but i came to church on purpose with a purpose i came on purpose with a purpose see don't ever come into a prayer line unless you're expecting to serve god the rest of your days always don't never live a sinful life because you'll be worse after that you've been healed or you come up in a prayer line and you you you just uh go about the rest of your life like nothing ever happened uh you'll end up worse brother sisters brother adam said that healing and forgiveness of sin was synonymous with each other they go together if sin brought on a sickness and you're healed from that sickness that means your sin has also been forgiven oh glory god has promised that you will be worse off than you was at the first time don't never try to come home especially this afternoon to you who shall come into this miracle line don't dare come lest you promise god with all your heart [Music] that peter heald goes through this church day after service after service after service uh it's not just man doing men men manly things and and natural human things whether that's what he'd been laying there for many years brother no doubt this man long before this when jesus was still walking on earth had believed for his healing no doubt that while jesus was on earth this man still believed he could receive his healing but but at some point he just accepted his condition brother like many of us see we we hear about the miracles during brother branham's time but then after a time where god seems to not do anything about or help us with our condition slowly we begin to give up hope slowly our faith begins to drift brother this is the problem today with many people as they have accepted their condition and they not only have accepted but have tried to justify why they are in the condition oh my [Music] [Music] responsibility that we have put ourselves in but realizing that our condition can change and it will change by the word of god by applying the token in our lives we can change our conditions the bible says we are changed at some point he just accepted his condition now we notice in the scriptures that is was only the entrance to go into the temple this man didn't even have a privilege and a right and a in a good enough condition to go into the temple not only that this man relied on his parents every day to take him just to the gate because brother sister your parents can only take you so far yourself who had to be carried every day to the gates and they could only carry him as far as the gate heals not to show his power he only heals those not on the merits of your christianity you say i've been a devoted christian for 50 years and conditions for your healing brother madam said i've seen prostitutes come in the line and get healed [Music] because you're a christian but when he does heal you me he wants you to be a christian from that time but he doesn't heal because you made you'd be made well [Music] i'll go up there i'll be healed because i'm a christian brother says no god heals on your face but many people are like the man from the gadarenes you can't tell by the smile they got on their face but they got legion they're so bound up inside they don't know where chain goes what direction anymore [Music] [Music] first of all he had more that devil had more about him than most people that claimed christianity because when he saw jesus christ he fell down and began to worship him that devil knew more about who jesus was than most people who say they're christians they did more about jesus coming than most christians [Music] and jesus asked that man a question what you talk about the bride of christ they don't even realize that you're talking about them they're so bounded up they don't even know who they are i'm defeat just you think i'm discouraged i'm depression i'm anxiety but people are likely they're they're they're just like that man at the gatekeeper of god being sang [Music] and all they can do is sit at the gate and wish they could go into the presence of god now this was the mag the gate called beautiful was actually this was the main gate going into the outer court of the temple it was made of corinthian brass if we remember and we recall that the corinthian church ended up being a very immature church paul continually had to tell the corinthians to you know all the basics all over again and get them to stop competing with each other and people now we find out of course later that this man when he's healed not only was he able to go past the gate that he was stuck at for so long but he was able to go into the temple the sanctuary during the time of jesus only the priest could go in right behind the veils i just want to tell you this morning brother did not stay in heaven he did not stay in jesus christ mother of the day of pentecost part out himself remember not just any spirit passage the same deity is you have enough power [Music] glory to god and we sit around i wish i could get past this trial oh hope brother so and so doesn't be mean to me again brother we give a testimony so terrible sometimes people come around they want to have a good conversation about the word of god and all you god is this woe is me attitude you call people sometimes brothers you know on the phone hey brother how's it going i'm barely making it brother but not just not just once in a while they say every time you call them they say that chuck up you almost feel like i'll talk to you later brother if something comes so you spend half your energy trying to get them encouraged and get them up and go in a little bit some people have a testimony that's so negative by the time they're done telling you all their bad things that are happening to them you how many likes to get around people some of you all got quiet like you said no that's me [Music] all the miracles good done by them and and that's people that were close to him on us we're preaching the same thing our prophet [Music] he's only preaching the message that was brought for our days [Music] that's what they're saying today oh put brother branham back in the pulpit never left authority don't focus on something that happened 30 years ago brother you you talk to people they're still hung up on something that happened 15 years ago i would worship god but brother so and so still in church and he does and you're going to heaven that means you'll be in one corner and brother so-and-so is going to be another brother death don't change one thing about you but your dwelling place if you're mean and arrogant and prideful [Music] that's why this body needs egg you ain't going to get no physical body change until your spiritual body has been changed um you know that's the truth look on when the preacher is preaching you shouldn't be talking to your neighbor i've seen people have their own service while the service is going away i've seen people open their bibles start reading their bible while the preacher is preaching you don't need to be here what did brother banham say how do we prepare for a service come an hour late you know how about 15 minutes late it just even come to the altar and worship god by yourself i don't believe the bride is on life supporting the shower brother sister i don't believe [Music] we claim to have the holy ghost but we limp our whole life around to his parents that brought him to church look around to see what everyone was doing look around and see what everyone was thinking about him he looked to who [Music] [Music] in the name of jesus christ of nazareth stand up and walk left by marshall what and the man was an aged man is said i've seen men that were old men with whiskers on their faces he said let the spirit of god come into the meeting he said they'll shout and jump and dance just like a young man oh i'm too old to worship god you know i recall a man that brother adam spoke about an older man with just a little white rim of hair around his head that walked up there with a cane but he didn't stay up there with a cane whether he didn't stay [Applause] he said you ain't got enough room up here for me that's how i feel about it you ain't got enough room for me to praise god was performed on activity don't matter how old you are how long you've been waiting for the moment your faith moves the moment your faith whichever gift is being used that's where all the attention and focus should be the angel told brother adam if you can get the people to folk to to believe brother branham said if you have a god-filled pastor realizing you're going to be lost you respect brother isaiah and you put your shoulder to the will with him as hard as you can you know he needs help with this say brother i can help you with this brother ships like a presidency a pastor being a pastor is like being a president it'll aid you quickly no let us not justify ourselves a certain amount of respect brother sister before respect sir you respect your pastor the right way respectively you can to live the word of god you'll be happy to see you you ready you're like one of the most wealthiest people probably spiritually yes now i know where you're going with that brother i said don't you put your hand down ah spiritually absolutely spiritual we're gazillionaires we all know everything our father owns that belongs to us but brother peter and john didn't have a lot of money they weren't coming through with loads of money to give this man because money fades your health will fade at some point these things fade but the power of jesus name never fails amen here's what proves they were pentecostal here's what proves they were pentecostals silver and gold have oh brother take your silver and your gold and give me that whenever all the names take all your seminary theology and give me that for it's only that that'll take you up up brother this this this tabernacle is called higher grounds fall but in this day he didn't give us the spirit of an officer we don't have to bear the burdens that we bear all the time god has given us a spirit soon as i do nearly [Music] because if god can't take care of it then i know i definitely can't take it so then what's the need of me worrying about oh give me that oh don't muscular in adoption number four preached in 1960 brother bradham said that when the church comes into her position and he finds her place [Music] we people have tried to make the message just like the baptist presbyterian or anything else there is so much power in this world but we sit around and wish wish brother branham was back on the scene from that brother sister i'm talking about a people that's coming into position not a people still dragging from day to day [Music] brother when john recognized that he was there john's looking in the book of revelation revelation they were my they were my buddies and he starts going through him and all of a sudden john saw himself remember whether he had more of a jubilee then than he did on the day of pentecost oh no we're more mature now we don't know [Music] you thought you were going on to perfection but instead all you did was drift back to your old catholic tendencies brother adam said satan took the people that used to shout the victory [Music] oh brother then we wonder why we don't speak and things happen we wonder why we don't speak any flashes like lightning you are going to get without first recognizing who you are i'm living however i want but i want to be able to speak whenever i want things happening one of the shows about the shows yes you ain't going to deal with malice and strife in your life you ain't going to do it amen [Music] when the church finally realizes who it is the farmer will know who you are oh i seen this one and that one that claimed to be part of the church this one's got something i heard her praying the other night [Music] [Music] my crops are burning up back here but i know that god hears you could you maybe ask him for some rain [Music] and that brother brought up [Music] there was only one man and there's only one bride on this earth that can slow down brother adam said he said when you fully obey the word and heaven stored some treasures for me more he says god is waiting god is wanting to place his church problem the sons and daughters of god god let me live to see it see y'all let's just use my blood so close till i can just feel it with my hands almost well i'm not talking about a god you just feel inside of something [Music] something's moving through me right now so close till i can just feel it with my hands that's what i've longed to see just screw my throat listen that's they'll stop cancer concerns he didn't leave church like this comes you see he didn't go to the car throw the bible in the back he didn't walk outside after a good spiritual service and look at his brother and said well you know work tomorrow we're going to do this and uh where do you want to eat bro i was talking to i was talking to brother uh i was talking to my dad my dad was telling me a story about your brother he said brother bob walked out of service one day his shoes had changed color from all the sweat it was tired how much would you charge for spraying my house but you're welcome to call me tomorrow what business do we have thinking about anything else besides god when we walk out those doors why would you want to leave that present why are people you make a dismissal seem like people almost crawl over one another trying to get out the door what's so important that you had to leave the inner vale what's so important you had to leave the presence of god to go do something that has no eternal value the bathrooms it better be more important than jesus whatever you're doing better be more important than jesus because that's what's going on here jesus is going on here he took the man by the hand and raised him there's somebody suffering with a sickness that immediately you can be healed right now there's somebody needing failing with the holy ghost immediately you can get filled right now there's somebody that needs chains broken this morning i say immediately they can be broken this morning why because jesus is yes sir he took the man by the hand raised him and immediately his feet and ankle bones received and then he walked in a church very quietly in class worked at a church very quietly and classy and said wasn't that a wonderful meeting that's how they did on the day of pentecost too right the holy ghost came into them [Applause] began to walk very close very calmly out the front door down the stairs they walked up they said hello do you know we're drunk hey i just want to tell you you know we was up in the upper room and we did a couple prayers a couple songs all peter preached again and uh we're drunk now in some evil brother they didn't have to tell anybody that they was dreaming let people know you're a christian not because you go around saying oh i'm a christian i'm brother i do this in the church this man didn't walk out calmly and quietly he walked out like god had done something for him i want to leave like something happened to me he began walking and leaping and running and jumping and praising god do you remember brother branham in that one meeting he said that couple was carrying on there was a couple that was messing around in the service i've heard different testimonies of people that were there this couple was kissing on one another and hugging one another the search brother you might not find much of that going on but you find people doing just as bad of things the holy spirit the holy spirit is very sensitive one face insult figure one fate one huff and puff interfere one bad thought one wrong attitude throw the holy spirit off said one person out of line could cause someone to miss their healing so how much of a sacred charge do we have coming through those doors check our problems at the door we ought to have a trash can we just throw all our problems because you decided to keep your wrong attitude and come in out of brother adam said when you're prayed for no matter if things are different right away or not solution he said just keep pushing did he continue he said if you were crippled in your arm or something like that [Music] just keep pushing and praising continue until you can move your finger then just keep till it's back to normal that's how we ought to leave church to come circle he began walking leaping running and jumping praising god brother adam said when you believe god for your healing he said don't ever act like you're sick or crippled anymore i believe i'm healed but i'll keep favoring my hurt i believe i'm healed but i'm going to keep going and getting my chemo treatment otherwise you just bow into the enemy how many people have squandered away their day of visitation people are so tired during church sometimes i ask what in the world are you doing saturday night something something brother said start your service on saturday night i'll tell you we was visiting with brother isaiah and sister ruby i felt like i started my service on saturday night and you know what i went to bed it was the most peaceful sleep i'd ever had in my mind [Music] and all the people begin to come together and screaming and carrying on you see it right you see someone get blessed in the meeting everyone else just turn around and watch someone received their healing you receive your healing that means the age of the lord is coming around your past remember brother i have talked about those two ladies that were prayed for during brother adam's meetings he said the one who had a stomach trouble the other one had a growth on her neck but they kept believing she's a real strange feeling came over so she ate a little something and it didn't come back up you see that she ate some cornbread it didn't come back she ate house the one that had the growth on herself she got close to the door the neighbor was having a jubilee and they had a jubilee together ensemble and she said what happened she said well this morning she said i had a real strange feeling come over to me and i began to eat and it didn't bother my stomach the lord had healed me [Applause] musicians come play something but i feel a spirit of faith in this building this morning glory to god you can have a beautiful gate conference this morning you can have a conference with god this morning you can leave delivered from your spiritual your physical limping condition god said you can have it whatsoever you don't got to live a life that crawls on the floor laying down taking the devil's punches you can rise up from that line how many times have we missed the blessing we were supposed to receive but i know when i feel the spirit of god i may not be able to see the pillar of fire over here but you know the preacher under the anointing has a certain amount of discernment is [Music] [Music] job said he knoweth the way that i take jobs and when he has tried me i will come through his goal you're dealing with the [Music] i want to read this in closing [Music] every in fact jesus christ has already put every enemy under his feet and every enemy that's under his feet a shack enemy is under the believer's feet the bride actually has authority to put satan in his position with his thumb over your life it's not with his thumb over your life it's not with him in your mind [Music] that's a reality he's like he's like attack you know one of those little patches step on just enough to let it let you know it's there sometimes the cat's scratching at the door and we think oh no i never got rid of it it's just the cat scratching at the door trying to scare you into letting it back in oh hallelujah the bible says that all the people saw him walking and praising god and they knew it was the one that was crippled they used to beg for alms at the gates people can think whatever they want of you but i believe more about what god's word says about it than what somebody else could know to be true [Music] you don't know like i know what the lord has done for us my past your past sin and mistakes they may have crippled [Music] and your fears and your doubts if you feel that way this morning i want you to say i'm not layman let the week say i am strong let the week say i am strong i'm not lame anymore i don't have to limp around anymore we've been given power to walk that feels crippled [Music] rise up in his presence to just take your children to church every sunday but encourage them to have an experience avoiding experience with god with the pillar of fire oh i feel faith rising all over this building this morning i feel like there's some hatty rights in here just don't come see cause that's right you see i feel like there's some hatty right there some come second because that's you right that are not willing to see their children suffer crippled at a gate what i just wonder is there any hattie rights in here this morning because that's right you are favored and it will be given to you is [Music] you want victory sick of battling the same devil over and over again ask what you will speak in the name of jesus said those snickering boys didn't want nothing to do with god problem that you right they were laughing they were laughing at the story that had been told but when hattie wright said the greatest thing she could ever say milos right at mandela money would be good for my mother be great but the greatest desire of my heart is for the salvation of my two daughters brother i said i give you your voice [Music] amen [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] the waters are stirred brother sister this is if you need something from the lord glory to god [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right [Music] sister in the blue dress don't think that [Music] you haven't gone too far amen [Music] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh bless his name
