praise God [Music] [Music] is [Music] he had a victory Amen in the blood of Christ on the song The Crystal we have the victory as we stand we're going to ask that you turn with us to First Peter amen the first chapter the 15th verse through the 19th well and brother kill do you have any cards with you okay okay everybody there but as he which have called you is Holy so be holy in all manner of conversation amen amen because it is written be holy for I am Holy spirit is and if you call on the father who without respect a person judge according to Every Man's work past the time of your sojourning here in fear for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptable things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by Traditions from your fathers is but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spots on dash uh Acts 2 actorship I'm beginning at the 36th verse therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God had made that same Jesus whom you have crucified both the Lord and Christ is but when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostle men and Brethren and what shall we do is then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy ghosts free for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call foreign [Music] [Music] we have been ministering by the grace of God on Consecration and sincerity showing that that has been one of the great downfalls of most Christians because Christians fail to see uh what they have been called to Christians we have been called to a higher calling so much so uh the Bible said that God transforms us amen into the kingdom of God the Bible tells us that we should always let the mind of Christ through those [Music] we're not a denomination we're not an organization how of any kind do you know uh we are just simply Christians that God who has chosen uh before the foundation of the world to be Christians because to be a Christian this is really not by your choice people say I chose God but in reality that's not true God chose you and the Bible says according to what Jesus has said all that the father has given me will come and he said my sheep hearing my voice and a stranger they will not follow when you heard the call of this message it was a summons sitting on the Bible said that God is not willing that any should perish but that all would come to repentance on this morning I like to so preach a subject the beauty of Holiness when you talk about Holiness uh people get scared afraid uh because we realize how faulty we are we know that God Holiness really cannot be explained it's beyond our comprehension but God does give us a touch of it amen so much that we would be accepted by him when I was thinking this morning on my way to church the Holy Spirit spoke to me and he said to me this is your season of Revival throughout the message the time we have come uh so far but we forgot the main ingredients and that is Holy Ghost living I know what the world has done people have brought in reproach to the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost is the spirit of God they mock god with their powerless tongue speaking with no proper interpretation it has become a show it's an entrepreneur all of the Dynamics where is the life the Holy Ghost is the Life of Christ in you Hallelujah making the rejoicing of God oh is [Music] amen thank you Lord let it be Lord we have received a vision by Malachi 4 and 5.6 and the vision in which he gave us by way of the Holy Spirit was a vision of perfection Hallelujah and we are to achievement in a higher regards a Perfection greater than what Ephesus arrived to Blue going to sell the feza Ephesus had everything they had all the things they had a profit they had the Holy Spirit everything was working in Ephesus this is why the prophet of God said Ephesus parallel Joshua Hallelujah because it wasn't dropped in ephesus's lap Ephesians they had to press Amen in that position into that position Hallelujah wherein they are noted to be the mature Church Hallelujah the Christians I mean excuse me the Corinthians were Christians Hallelujah they compare it themselves Hallelujah everybody wanted to be something everybody want to speak in town I didn't want to prophesy Hallelujah they were not dead to themselves Hallelujah but Ephesus the Ephesians Church Ephesians was the church that Paul it is pretty much pastored because of who he was the reflection of his ministries we say we follow the teachings of William Brown we are no longer followers we don't want to be Pretenders performing the same duties and things because Jesus Christ yesterday today and forever he's a God that changes and we all ought to be tired the hypocrisy amen amen that we see within ourselves you thought I was going to say others didn't you know within ourselves Hallelujah the vision is to achieve his Holiness how are you going to get there needs to be as perfect as God is to declare his truth that he alone is God this is not Christian Science all people of God you got to understand this Bible is Right Hallelujah and in order to be called children of God you must be from the born of God hallelujah and you can't be born of God without your Holy Ghost amen I remember witnessing to somebody I got the Holy Spirit I said I got the Holy Spirit and she said she got the Holy Ghost and I'm like the scientist please am I dumb to something here people will denominate themselves and the other one said holy spirit there is no difference holy Hallelujah one say tomato yeah tomato and the others say tomato a lot of the tomato it's a tomato tomato strange you know it it bear witness that we're already different in so many ways listen first Peter 15 115 says let because it is written let's say 16th because it is written be holy for I am Holy hallelujah amen now we must understand I'm gonna say it really in a simple way there is no such thing as a holy man the holy God
