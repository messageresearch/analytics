[16:39] [Music]
[16:45] it was such a supernatural trip for me
[16:52] [Music]
[17:07] because it just seemed like the lord had
[17:10] just came and just gave me a piece
[17:12] now i say that just to say that but
[17:15] getting ready and everything usually
[17:17] when i have to go with brother brooks
[17:19] the day before or a couple days before i
[17:22] can't eat a drink
[17:24] because i don't want to go to the
[17:24] restaurant but it's like my whole body
[17:27] on the inside just
[17:28] runs and i be real nervous and so but
[17:31] this time
[17:32] i had no nervousness and it just seemed
[17:35] as though god was just leading me and
[17:36] just taking me through this
[17:38] and um and i appreciate all your prayers
[17:41] because i know this was what's helping
[17:42] me as well
[17:43] and so anyway so we got ready we went
[17:47] to the airport and everything and as we
[17:50] got on the plane and stuff we got there
[17:51] and i'm like
[17:52] okay lord i was just praying and the
[17:54] lord it was so
[17:56] amazing because even we got there uh
[18:03] [Music]
[18:12] my supernatural book just started
[18:14] reading and the lord blessed me through
[18:16] that
[18:16] and then so but it was a little rough
[18:18] ride and then the thing was
[18:20] i went to the doctor to get some
[18:22] medicine to kind of calm me down
[18:24] but the lord said do not take it so i
[18:27] didn't take the medicine
[18:28] and he took me all the way through from
[18:31] chicago
[18:32] to uh i mean from chicago like i said it
[18:34] was a little bumpy but the lord took me
[18:36] through so then we got to
[18:38] uh jacksonville
[18:43] [Music]
[18:51] you know the enemy still trying to fight
[18:52] and i'm like why are you doing this you
[18:54] know it's not kind of like
[18:56] so i kept reading my book and everything
[18:58] and i came to a spot in one of my books
[19:01] um where i was reading where uh brother
[19:04] brown was going to his breakfast and
[19:06] uh these men the lord had told him that
[19:08] the
[19:09] [Music]
[19:17] [Music]
[19:23] again and it's just like it just went
[19:24] and then i had no worries
[19:27] even though we had the bump bumps or
[19:28] whatever it was it didn't
[19:30] like oh whatever but i was holding
[19:31] brother brooke's hand and i did squeeze
[19:34] every now and then he said it's okay
[19:35] it's okay okay then i just
[19:38] prayed but god took me through and it's
[19:40] just a supernatural trip that
[19:42] this has happened and i just praise god
[19:45] and thank god for all his goodness and
[19:47] all his love toward me

[35:12] right on into the word of the lord
[35:14] thank you musicians thank you all
[35:17] god is good to us
[35:22] um
[35:25] appreciate everybody's patience with me
[35:29] love the lord amen we had a
[35:34] wonderful time there in st augustine and
[35:37] i guess i'm wearing st augustine with me
[35:40] because i brought some
[35:41] some food back with me but it's not on
[35:45] the plate it's on me
[35:46] [Laughter]
[35:48] but we thank god for his goodness thank
[35:50] the lord for my wife called with us
[35:53] it was just a lovely time in jesus and
[35:57] uh satan fought the whole entire time
[36:01] but god got the victory uh many people
[36:04] were
[36:06] really really blessed and revived the
[36:08] church in itself had been going through
[36:10] some tremendous battles
[36:13] and of course god intervened
[36:17] by word of the past and his
[36:20] wife and a young lady who we prayed for
[36:24] which was the pastor's daughter the lord
[36:26] really touched her and just various
[36:29] things different things did happen
[36:32] in spite of all the things satan tried
[36:34] to do
[36:35] i mean he tried to mess with the mics i
[36:38] mean
[36:39] everything was just but god came through
[36:42] i really thank you for your prayers
[36:47] amen as we turn stand let us turn to
[36:50] revelations 22
[36:52] revelations 22 i apologize for
[36:56] coming in late i was in my mind i'm
[36:58] thinking that service started at 7
[37:00] 30. and then when i heard brother frank
[37:04] speaking i was singing i'm like wait a
[37:06] minute and i still had to
[37:08] think on it before it really clicked
[37:12] but uh we appreciate the lord jesus
[37:15] amen revelations
[37:18] 22 and from there we're going to go to
[37:20] genesis the second
[37:22] chapter and the eighth verse
[37:25] um i think i think the thing that we
[37:27] must realize tonight is that
[37:31] identity means a lot you know who
[37:34] are you know where you come from
[37:38] it's it's never it has been about
[37:42] uh us or we
[37:48] in the gentile selection it has always
[37:50] been individuals
[37:52] and so tonight we we all must come to
[37:55] see who
[37:57] we really are one of the scriptures that
[38:00] really
[38:01] really uh unfolded to me the other day
[38:04] was
[38:05] who shall lay any charge to god's elect
[38:09] it is god who justified i have seen a
[38:12] lot of scriptures i've seen a lot of
[38:13] things but that seemed to
[38:16] was magnified in my spirit by
[38:20] by the holy ghost revelations 22
[38:25] and two in the midst
[38:28] of the streets of it and on either side
[38:33] of the river was there the tree
[38:37] of life which bear 12 manners of fruit
[38:42] watch this and yielded
[38:46] her fruit every
[38:50] month the alpha becomes the omega
[38:56] and remember everything must be
[38:59] fulfilled nothing shall come back
[39:02] void and
[39:06] what eve did not do god chose the bride
[39:10] of this day
[39:12] to fulfill even as it was was the with
[39:15] the first adam
[39:17] he did not do what god intended him to
[39:20] do is to
[39:22] and that was to replenish the earth with
[39:25] sons of god
[39:27] not with sons of adam so let's go to
[39:30] genesis
[39:30] 2 and 8.
[39:41] when we come to see that we are trees
[39:43] how many all know we we're trees
[39:46] i think it was psalms the first chapter
[39:48] where
[39:49] david says i'll be like a tree planted
[39:52] by the rivers of water
[39:54] by the river one water amen
[39:58] and i'm glad to know that we
[40:02] uh as the people of god uh
[40:05] really has nothing to do with it
[40:08] sometimes we we feel like we ought to
[40:11] have something
[40:12] to do with it but i believe that if we
[40:14] take hands off
[40:16] and let go and let god we'll grow and
[40:18] mature at a faster rate
[40:22] genesis 2 and 8
[40:28] and the lord god planted a garden east
[40:31] within eden
[40:32] and there he put the man
[40:40] whom he had formed
[40:43] and out of the ground made the lord god
[40:46] to grow
[40:46] every tree that is pleasant to the sight
[40:49] and good for food the tree of life
[40:53] also in the midst of the garden
[40:56] in the tree of knowledge of good and
[40:59] evil
[41:00] let us pray heavenly father we thank you
[41:03] for your grace we thank you for your
[41:05] mercy
[41:06] we thank you for being so good to us we
[41:08] thank you for
[41:10] uh being our all in all and lord tonight
[41:13] we realize that
[41:14] there's nothing within our powers
[41:17] nothing that we can do of ourselves
[41:19] but we are definitely depending on you
[41:21] to break the word of life to us lord
[41:24] bless us now forgive us of our sins
[41:27] cleanse us from all unrighteousness lord
[41:30] we realize tonight the devil is a liar
[41:32] and
[41:33] how he tried to influence our minds with
[41:36] his thoughts and his ideas
[41:38] and lord i reject those thoughts i
[41:40] refuse those thoughts
[41:42] and i say tonight lord by your grace and
[41:44] your mercy
[41:45] let your mind be in me the mind that was
[41:49] in christ jesus
[41:50] lord we receive it in jesus christ's
[41:53] name we pray
[41:54] amen you may be see that
[41:59] i know that uh we've been just kind of
[42:02] preaching on a lot of things but
[42:03] uh one of the things that i well not
[42:06] just one of the things the things that
[42:07] i'm really trying to get everybody to
[42:09] really see
[42:10] especially among the bride people is to
[42:12] see who you really are
[42:14] you know you know because if you can't
[42:17] see who you
[42:17] are um it's like a blind man
[42:21] he doesn't know which direction to go in
[42:25] and so we just trust by the grace of god
[42:27] that the bible in itself
[42:29] become amen your absolute
[42:32] the word of god that is meant to be
[42:35] lived not to be preached or
[42:39] or quoted but to live
[42:43] because remember satan can do a little
[42:45] quoting himself
[42:46] uh so we realize that the power of life
[42:50] is not in quoting god
[42:52] the power of of the scripture is living
[42:55] can i say it like living god yeah
[42:59] not a living god but living god
[43:03] amen letting god live through us
[43:06] and you know brother branham talks about
[43:09] threefold purpose a threefold purpose
[43:11] that god had
[43:13] uh in in his thoughts when he were
[43:17] to create all things and and this this
[43:20] could be
[43:21] uh found in christ the mystery of god
[43:23] revealed he said
[43:24] his this his threefold purpose
[43:27] was to express himself identify himself
[43:31] with human beings
[43:33] and to reveal himself in christ
[43:36] and in in when in reading that it may
[43:38] seems like it's not much
[43:41] but what good is it to profess christ
[43:44] if you don't know him and to understand
[43:48] this is that
[43:49] he his is one of his purposes one of the
[43:52] purpose
[43:53] of his purposes is to identify
[43:56] himself and you know even throughout the
[43:59] word he
[44:00] he constantly uh said even to israel i
[44:04] the lord thy god is one i'm a god that
[44:07] changes
[44:08] not and in another place he said if
[44:10] there is another god
[44:12] i don't know him and then you know i
[44:15] could see how israel in the intellect
[44:17] would be confused
[44:19] about that especially if they knew those
[44:21] scriptures and jesus
[44:23] there in saint john 10 30 says i and the
[44:26] father are one
[44:28] i can see how they would get really
[44:30] upset and think he is a blasphemer
[44:34] but one of the things that jesus told us
[44:36] is that
[44:37] the the the understanding of god does
[44:39] not come
[44:40] uh by intellect it comes by way of
[44:43] revelation
[44:45] you know you could have two three four
[44:47] five six whatever
[44:48] so many people in the service and you a
[44:51] man could be preaching in the bible the
[44:53] word could be coming
[44:54] with such a power and authority and and
[44:57] one man or two men or
[44:59] however would go out saying oh man
[45:01] wasn't nothing to that but then
[45:03] there's another little group of people
[45:04] that could hear it and could understand
[45:06] it and would
[45:07] leave out rejoicing praise god god met
[45:10] us in a mighty way
[45:12] that's how it is with the message
[45:16] even though it's laid out on tapes he's
[45:18] laid out in on
[45:19] books and you know laid out in the bible
[45:21] there's still those
[45:22] people who have so-called walked with
[45:24] him and have not yet known him
[45:29] the purpose of this bible and the
[45:31] purpose of god creating things
[45:33] is for his creation to come to know him
[45:37] it is a beautiful thing that god so
[45:39] loved us
[45:40] as the scripture said that he sent his
[45:42] only begotten son
[45:44] and in that scripture it was christ
[45:46] coming to
[45:47] to into the in the form of a human being
[45:51] to reveal himself and you know that's
[45:54] why jesus being the
[45:56] body of christ never sought to take
[45:59] credit
[46:00] for anything and he says i can't do
[46:02] nothing
[46:03] except the father showed me in other
[46:05] words he says it's not i
[46:06] that do the works but my father that is
[46:09] within me or
[46:10] he you know he is the one he's doing
[46:14] the work and that's how it is with the
[46:16] true christian
[46:17] brother of adam said as i think in
[46:19] christ's mystery god revealed again he
[46:20] says
[46:21] a true uh uh a mountain transfiguration
[46:25] experience
[46:26] will always glorify god
[46:30] or jesus christ well always he said it
[46:33] won't
[46:34] glorify moses he will not glorify elijah
[46:38] he will only glorify jesus christ
[46:42] now when you quote that particular quote
[46:45] you find out that
[46:46] people get really upset and uptight
[46:49] about that
[46:51] because often time the name of jesus
[46:54] christ become
[46:55] secondary to the name of elijah
[47:00] in the name moses but you and i must
[47:03] understand that
[47:04] the name of jesus christ in order to
[47:07] fulfill the purpose of god
[47:09] that name must be exalted
[47:12] because the bible says neither is there
[47:14] salvation in any other
[47:16] there is no other name given to my man
[47:18] under heaven above heaven around heaven
[47:21] no no no no no there is no other name
[47:24] given among men
[47:25] under heaven whereby we must be saved
[47:28] but the name of jesus christ
[47:31] see that's god's purpose his purpose
[47:35] as father supreme was to be one
[47:39] with his family i like that because
[47:42] there's nothing more beautiful
[47:44] than to see a beautiful family
[47:47] where the children are in order and the
[47:50] daddy and the mother and everybody
[47:52] is just in in such a beautiful order now
[47:54] you
[47:55] know it's a rarity it's a scarce
[47:59] thing but i've seen it with my own eyes
[48:03] and you know it's what we all crave for
[48:06] as christians
[48:07] fathers and mothers you know we all
[48:10] crave children we all crave
[48:12] that desire for all of us to be on one
[48:14] accord and to be a family
[48:16] because we know that when that is is on
[48:19] display
[48:20] it is a reflection of god's thoughts his
[48:23] will
[48:24] think about it had not adam and eve sin
[48:28] how beautiful it would have been we
[48:31] don't know how many of children
[48:34] they would have had but it would have
[48:37] been
[48:37] this i would say like this inexhaustible
[48:40] of the number
[48:41] you know like like john says i i there
[48:44] was a number that no man could
[48:46] could count beyond counting
[48:49] innumerable as the scripture calls it
[48:52] and that still that still
[48:56] stands it may not have come
[48:59] through the first adam and eve but
[49:02] definitely
[49:03] it comes through the second see that
[49:06] purpose was to
[49:07] to his family or earthly family adam and
[49:10] even
[49:10] and the only way they could be one with
[49:14] the family
[49:14] or with god because god
[49:17] nurtured excuse nature was in them so
[49:21] um understand it's every time i think
[49:24] about
[49:25] the garden of eden and the tree of life
[49:27] i think about it in a different way now
[49:30] because you got to realize that
[49:31] everything was male and female
[49:34] the animals the insects the bees you
[49:37] know
[49:37] uh the trees everything
[49:41] male and female and you know many people
[49:44] still don't know that trees comes in
[49:47] male
[49:48] and female and of course this is where
[49:50] you get pollination bees
[49:52] coming from one tree to the next amen to
[49:55] pollenize them and you look at these
[49:58] things and you think to yourself
[50:03] what a horrible thing that eve allowed
[50:06] to happen to her she was of a different
[50:10] tree
[50:11] she was not of the same tree of the
[50:13] serpent
[50:15] and i could see how the the hibernation
[50:19] came
[50:19] in and i can see what happened to adam
[50:23] being that he was the one who who
[50:24] carried the life
[50:28] we have no idea how god suffered that to
[50:31] happen but
[50:32] no doubt the pain
[50:36] of disappointment that it brought with
[50:41] that action but in the midst of it all
[50:45] god still had mercy
[50:49] because in god's mind he knew that was
[50:51] the only way
[50:52] that he could reproduce himself in the
[50:55] way that he wanted to
[50:57] even though it looked faulty it was
[50:59] really the perfect way
[51:01] because you don't know what perfection
[51:03] he is until you see
[51:04] imperfection and we have had over 6
[51:08] 000 years of imperfection and i think
[51:10] there's a group of people around here
[51:11] that wants to really see
[51:12] perfection so we want to be the family
[51:16] of god and we can't even imagine
[51:18] within our minds what that's going to be
[51:20] like
[51:21] but understand your purpose for being a
[51:24] christian
[51:24] is not to express yourself it is to
[51:28] express
[51:29] him it is to let go and let god express
[51:32] himself
[51:33] through you right
[51:36] and we must understand that is the
[51:38] identity
[51:40] the identity of a christian is not the
[51:43] brand of religion
[51:45] it's not the baptist methodist
[51:46] presbyterian pentecostal or even
[51:49] that's not christianity christianity is
[51:52] when the life of christ
[51:54] is living through that individual so
[51:57] much so that it can be
[51:59] identified is that right they knew
[52:03] that they were they were christians at
[52:05] antioch
[52:06] they even called them christians why
[52:09] because the life of christ
[52:11] was identified in them even though jesus
[52:15] christ in the natural
[52:16] had already gone off the earth his
[52:19] life was now being exemplified through
[52:22] them
[52:23] and when those people saw them they
[52:25] didn't have to put a sign
[52:27] or cross or anything on their backs
[52:29] around their necks
[52:30] it was the very life the very character
[52:34] of christ living through them
[52:38] and so they felt they were fulfilling
[52:40] they were fulfilling the word of god
[52:42] that was allotted for them think about
[52:45] it
[52:47] amen right
[52:50] and so we see that was god's family
[52:53] because his nature was in them you don't
[52:56] have to worry about
[52:57] a lamb being a goat because the nature
[53:00] is not there
[53:01] as long as that nature of the lamb is in
[53:03] the lamb that's all it can be
[53:05] it can't be no more and it can't be no
[53:08] less
[53:08] it'll never bark it'll never meow like a
[53:11] cat
[53:12] because that is not the nature of a lamb
[53:14] it will be submissive
[53:17] it will be a follower instead of a
[53:19] leader
[53:20] needs a shepherd and it's amazing how
[53:22] sometimes people feel like they don't
[53:24] need one
[53:25] but then that lamb needs a shepherd
[53:27] because he's not smart enough to lead
[53:30] himself
[53:30] and a true christian needs to shepherd
[53:33] the lord jesus christ
[53:35] because we're not smart enough to lead
[53:37] ourselves
[53:38] amen so we know that god made them with
[53:42] god's nature in them then with each
[53:45] other
[53:46] and god they become all one
[53:49] isn't that a beautiful picture god
[53:53] in his family father over also
[53:56] right supreme think about it and that
[53:58] day is coming
[53:59] when we'll see no death no sorrow
[54:02] no heartaches no nothing just joy
[54:05] unspeakable
[54:07] never to be sick never to have hearty
[54:10] headaches
[54:11] just one with god think about it
[54:14] we cannot even fathom it but i'm gonna
[54:16] tell you something
[54:18] the suffering of this world cannot even
[54:21] be compared
[54:22] to the glory for which god is in store
[54:24] for us
[54:26] only a foolish man would choose this
[54:30] over what god has offered hallelujah
[54:34] you know it makes no sense to me but
[54:37] when we
[54:37] think about us and this is what we must
[54:40] oh i heard somebody say something today
[54:42] uh by way of a tape which was so so so
[54:45] so so so good he said you always should
[54:48] remind yourself
[54:50] of the scripture you should always
[54:54] your scripture like ye are the temple of
[54:56] god that that should always be before
[54:59] you
[54:59] he said because the moment you forget
[55:01] that a lying demon
[55:04] is going to come anoint you and torment
[55:07] you
[55:08] it's the truth we must always try to
[55:10] keep this is why the bible told
[55:12] israel said put it on your forehead
[55:14] around your anchors around you
[55:16] you know whatever do write it everywhere
[55:19] don't forget it
[55:20] and see that's where we come short
[55:23] because
[55:23] most i won't say all of us most of us we
[55:26] don't read or study and we don't
[55:28] meditate or even
[55:29] try to learn the scriptures as they
[55:31] should be learned
[55:32] right but remember in the old in the
[55:35] time of the old testament
[55:36] they had to learn that scripture and
[55:38] they couldn't deviate from it not one
[55:40] eye order
[55:42] right right and so you've got to
[55:44] understand those
[55:46] pharisees that we as we call them in
[55:48] that day i mean they could just
[55:50] almost be uh a man could actually take a
[55:53] pen or whatever
[55:54] and stick it in the stroll and they
[55:55] could tell that person exactly
[55:57] what was written there without even
[56:00] opening up the scroll now that's
[56:02] real teaching that's real learning but
[56:05] let's go on by the grace of god
[56:07] the bible says know ye not that you are
[56:09] the temple of god
[56:12] hmm and the spirit of god dwelleth in
[56:16] you
[56:17] how many of us forget that at times come
[56:20] on
[56:21] now we realize by god's grace we do
[56:23] because
[56:24] our action proves we do right
[56:27] so saint john amen 17 21 says and the
[56:30] glory which thou
[56:32] gaveth me i have given them that they
[56:36] may be one even as we are
[56:39] one now you think about it the same
[56:42] glory
[56:44] the father gave christ what was that
[56:46] himself
[56:47] there is no greater glory than christ
[56:50] hallelujah the greatest thing that god
[56:53] could ever give you
[56:54] is himself hallelujah
[56:58] and that's what he did listen to the
[57:01] elementary file the temple of god
[57:03] him shall god destroy for the temple of
[57:05] god is holy
[57:07] which ye are the temple now
[57:10] we we were talking about this today
[57:13] how that sometimes we do things and we
[57:15] do things amen
[57:17] called iniquity you know it wrong and
[57:20] you do it any way
[57:22] and thank god for his grace and the
[57:24] blood of jesus christ
[57:26] that that that that was his blood was
[57:28] shed
[57:29] for all iniquity now let me tell you
[57:32] something
[57:32] no man no woman can love you like that
[57:37] we can love each other but no man and no
[57:40] woman can love you like that
[57:44] hallelujah think about it and
[57:48] that's why i was saying you know we we
[57:50] didn't know what god was doing and
[57:52] israel didn't know what god was doing
[57:54] but you know what israel when they were
[57:56] protecting the word and they were
[57:58] the levites and they were carrying that
[58:00] ark
[58:01] on their hearts above their hearts and
[58:03] you know in the in that holy place and
[58:06] the ark of the covenant and they you
[58:07] know you think about that and you think
[58:09] you know this is this is what i what i
[58:12] saw because i thought lord
[58:14] i've seen this done so many times in
[58:16] those old movies these ancient movies
[58:18] where you got the egyptians or
[58:20] you got these royal people and and they
[58:22] always have somebody carrying them
[58:25] they didn't have wheels they had human
[58:28] beings
[58:29] and those people who were the barriers
[58:32] always carried above their hearts or
[58:34] on the left side where the heart is
[58:38] and i thought listen the whole time we
[58:40] had no
[58:41] idea what was behind that curtain we
[58:44] didn't know
[58:45] but it was a hidden thing it was a
[58:47] mystery and the whole of israel didn't
[58:49] even know what
[58:50] it was and you think about it that even
[58:52] the priests
[58:53] even the high priest they didn't have an
[58:55] idea
[58:56] of what it was all they knew it was holy
[58:58] and it represented god
[59:02] hallelujah but it was a powerful
[59:05] revelation behind that
[59:07] it was more than what they were seeing
[59:08] on the outer court
[59:10] there they were slaying the animals and
[59:12] and and
[59:13] washing the animals and and you know
[59:15] people were confessing their sins but
[59:17] in that hole he's a holiest that was the
[59:21] finished work
[59:23] that was a very sim it was a symbolic of
[59:26] the real blood of christ
[59:28] it was it was the symbolism of jesus
[59:31] himself
[59:32] and understand if you want to put it
[59:34] this way god being a morphing
[59:37] it's the same thing it was a tree of
[59:40] life
[59:42] in a different form it was god in a
[59:46] different form
[59:46] hello listen i don't care what shadow
[59:49] type it is
[59:50] it still must come back to god
[59:53] it can't be nothing else
[59:58] hallelujah and then you got this moses
[1:00:02] and elijah
[1:00:04] look at the scripture there stood there
[1:00:06] amen i think it was uh
[1:00:07] ezekiel or zechariah moses and elijah
[1:00:11] standing there those two
[1:00:13] those two angels and there was a tree
[1:00:16] in the midst of them and you think about
[1:00:18] what in the world is going on
[1:00:20] here god was covering
[1:00:23] and protecting his bride
[1:00:28] you didn't know what it was and neither
[1:00:29] did i
[1:00:31] but you said well how can you say such a
[1:00:33] thing as that brother brooks
[1:00:34] well let me ask you a question when the
[1:00:37] veil
[1:00:38] was rent what was behind there
[1:00:42] nothing
[1:00:45] not even the ark it was gone
[1:00:48] where was it jesus it had switched
[1:00:52] positions
[1:00:54] it was no longer uh where uh you know
[1:00:57] upon the furniture that moses built
[1:01:00] under the inspiration of god
[1:01:02] but now god had chosen a different
[1:01:05] tabernacle
[1:01:08] it was no longer with that with the
[1:01:10] sheepskin and the ghost skin
[1:01:11] and all of that stuff no this was now a
[1:01:14] living tabernacle
[1:01:18] the bible said in christ was the
[1:01:20] fullness in jesus was the fullness of
[1:01:22] the godhead bodily
[1:01:24] hallelujah the very god that once sit on
[1:01:27] that mercy seat
[1:01:28] is now sitting on a different mercy seat
[1:01:30] which we call
[1:01:31] jesus right and so we realized by god's
[1:01:35] grace
[1:01:35] amen when that was done away with we saw
[1:01:38] the real
[1:01:39] image of what that represented
[1:01:42] [Laughter]
[1:01:44] body soul body spirit and soul however
[1:01:48] we want to say it
[1:01:50] but there was jesus christ the very god
[1:01:53] that that was in the wilderness
[1:01:56] hallelujah
[1:01:57] the rock that moses smote and spoke to
[1:02:00] that was him hallelujah the bread that
[1:02:04] came down from heaven
[1:02:05] that was him he's god in murphy he can
[1:02:08] change
[1:02:09] into whatever he wants to change into
[1:02:12] and even though he changes his character
[1:02:14] never changes
[1:02:16] hallelujah i used to wonder about that
[1:02:19] tree in the garden
[1:02:21] and that tree in revelation because here
[1:02:23] the tree in the garden
[1:02:24] doesn't say nothing about bringing forth
[1:02:26] fruit but
[1:02:28] in the tree according to revelation the
[1:02:30] same tree of life
[1:02:31] is described as a her a she
[1:02:36] the bride she brings forth fruit
[1:02:40] hallelujah it has to be her she's the
[1:02:43] only one that's compatible
[1:02:48] god again i tell you what it's powerful
[1:02:51] because when jesus was the tree of life
[1:02:53] you know there had to be another one
[1:02:55] and to be honest with you adam and eve
[1:02:57] represented that
[1:02:59] until he fell and adam fell
[1:03:04] and then brother brandon said she no
[1:03:05] longer represented the tree of life
[1:03:07] she represented the tree of death
[1:03:10] that's it by because you know
[1:03:13] from point from that point on we came
[1:03:16] into the world being born of that tree
[1:03:20] hallelujah amen and and
[1:03:23] and the bible says a man born of a woman
[1:03:27] it's a few days and full of trouble
[1:03:30] we came in with death we know we're
[1:03:33] opponent to die
[1:03:34] that's the bible says born of a woman
[1:03:36] and appointed to die
[1:03:38] hallelujah why because of eve but there
[1:03:41] must be another tree
[1:03:43] there must be a woman who can bring
[1:03:45] forth life
[1:03:50] that's why god bypassed all those people
[1:03:53] and the bible said that the woman
[1:03:55] according to things isaiah would surpass
[1:03:58] the woman a woman would surpass a man
[1:04:00] and you know women preachers uses that
[1:04:02] scripture like
[1:04:03] you know they're going to be they're
[1:04:04] going to be a greater preacher than the
[1:04:05] man that ain't what it means
[1:04:07] that means that god was going to use a
[1:04:09] virgin
[1:04:10] surpass the man god was going to use a
[1:04:13] woman and not the man
[1:04:15] to bring forth life and that's what he
[1:04:17] did
[1:04:18] hallelujah and so now you say well if
[1:04:21] that god
[1:04:22] used mary to bring forth life it was a
[1:04:24] spoken word in her womb
[1:04:26] hallelujah what is it with the bride it
[1:04:29] is the spoken word
[1:04:31] in her womb she brings forth life
[1:04:35] all she got to do it says be it unto me
[1:04:38] according to that word
[1:04:42] excuse me isaiah 53
[1:04:45] 8-10 said he was taken from prison and
[1:04:48] judgment
[1:04:48] you see that's why brother brown said he
[1:04:50] could have been married
[1:04:51] he could have had children he could have
[1:04:54] done a lot of things
[1:04:56] but the bible tells us that he
[1:04:57] sanctified himself
[1:05:00] right so that we can be sanctified
[1:05:03] so he chose not those things because his
[1:05:06] kingdom was not of this
[1:05:08] world is that what he said he said
[1:05:11] my kingdom is not of this world he was
[1:05:13] still living
[1:05:14] when he said that so if he was to be a
[1:05:17] king
[1:05:18] of a different world he must bring up
[1:05:20] forth a people
[1:05:21] of a different world that's why he's in
[1:05:23] being
[1:05:25] we are in the world but not of the world
[1:05:27] we come from a different world
[1:05:29] if there be any aliens we're the aliens
[1:05:34] he was taken i love the scripture from
[1:05:37] prison and judgment
[1:05:38] what did they say i find no fault and
[1:05:41] who shall
[1:05:42] declare his generation i've read this
[1:05:45] before
[1:05:46] but now if jesus was cut off
[1:05:49] like abel was cut off there was no
[1:05:53] genealogy of abel because he didn't have
[1:05:56] any children
[1:05:58] and so the devil thought if i can cut
[1:06:00] jesus off
[1:06:02] it'll be like cutting off another able
[1:06:05] he won't have
[1:06:06] no way to reproduce himself
[1:06:09] but what he did not know is that this
[1:06:12] second atom
[1:06:13] was different from the first the first
[1:06:16] atom was earthly but this adam was
[1:06:18] heavenly he said the bible says not only
[1:06:20] that
[1:06:21] he was a quickening spirit and he was
[1:06:23] lord of heaven and
[1:06:24] her he the bible said if the princes of
[1:06:27] this world
[1:06:28] would have known who he was they would
[1:06:30] not have crucified
[1:06:32] him hallelujah god was getting ready to
[1:06:35] do a great thing
[1:06:36] hiding it from him right
[1:06:40] so you see by god's grace god comes
[1:06:42] along and
[1:06:44] and even i said say he's going to be cut
[1:06:46] off
[1:06:47] that's what he said for he was cut off
[1:06:51] out of the land of the living for the
[1:06:53] transgression of my people was he
[1:06:55] stricken
[1:06:57] and he made his grave with the wicked
[1:06:59] and with the rich
[1:07:00] in his death because he had done no
[1:07:03] violence
[1:07:04] neither was any deceit in his mouth
[1:07:08] that represented us he paid the price
[1:07:12] don't you understand if you are accepted
[1:07:14] in the beloved
[1:07:16] this scripture applies to you because
[1:07:19] you were in him
[1:07:20] when he did it yet it pleased the lord
[1:07:24] to bruise him he have put him to grief
[1:07:29] when thou shalt make his soul an
[1:07:32] offering for sin he
[1:07:36] shall see his seed
[1:07:39] hallelujah and we didn't know
[1:07:42] but the bible tells us that even in the
[1:07:44] beginning before the foundation of the
[1:07:45] world
[1:07:46] there was a good sower and a bad sower
[1:07:49] god sold his seed before the foundation
[1:07:51] of the world
[1:07:52] hallelujah and because he saw the seed
[1:07:56] we are now living today hallelujah
[1:08:00] but see what people don't understand is
[1:08:02] that it goes back to the original way
[1:08:04] god intended
[1:08:06] because we're not given birth by a woman
[1:08:08] we're giving birth by
[1:08:10] a he we are born of jesus
[1:08:13] christ the way it was supposed to be
[1:08:18] by the adam the man adam yes
[1:08:21] before eve ever came into play before we
[1:08:24] ever knew she existed
[1:08:26] adam was given the order be fruitful
[1:08:30] and multiply is that all right
[1:08:34] so we come in this place you say well
[1:08:35] brothers what are you trying to say
[1:08:37] i i know one thing
[1:08:40] that in order to be compatible to the
[1:08:42] tree of life
[1:08:43] you must be the tree of life
[1:08:47] and there's only one tree and that tree
[1:08:49] is male and female it really is
[1:08:53] the bible declares it is because the man
[1:08:56] there is no man can bring forth fruit
[1:08:59] only christ can bring forth fruit
[1:09:03] and the woman amen it's the part of her
[1:09:06] and this is why brother branham said it
[1:09:07] like this
[1:09:08] he said she became him
[1:09:13] now it doesn't mean that she changed her
[1:09:15] her makeup
[1:09:18] her anatomy those things remain
[1:09:21] but the christ in her really has no
[1:09:25] gender
[1:09:28] there is no gender when christ that's
[1:09:32] why it says there's neither male nor
[1:09:33] female
[1:09:34] [Laughter]
[1:09:36] when you are in christ but understand
[1:09:39] the woman
[1:09:40] because she is the church she's labeled
[1:09:43] as a woman
[1:09:45] and she gets his nature right
[1:09:48] now he wanted to reveal himself
[1:09:52] he wanted to contact them to know let
[1:09:54] them know who he
[1:09:55] he was i'm a man but yet he's still i'm
[1:09:59] god
[1:10:00] he wanted them to know how he loved them
[1:10:03] for god so loved the world that he gave
[1:10:05] his only begotten son
[1:10:06] he wanted them to know that but most of
[1:10:09] all he wanted to reveal himself
[1:10:11] in christ now that's saying a lot of
[1:10:14] things
[1:10:15] you say well what do you mean brother
[1:10:16] brooks when brother branham was talking
[1:10:18] about
[1:10:19] how those squirrels were created and
[1:10:22] things like that
[1:10:23] and hattie wright says that ain't
[1:10:25] nothing but the truth brother branham
[1:10:28] he was revealing himself now she knew
[1:10:30] him as a prophet
[1:10:31] but now she's going to know him as
[1:10:33] christ the anointing
[1:10:36] and he said and now naughty said to
[1:10:37] brother branham
[1:10:39] whatever she asked for give it to her
[1:10:44] you understand me he wants you to know
[1:10:47] him as christ
[1:10:48] he wants you to know him as the
[1:10:49] invisible god
[1:10:51] but when there's honor given to his to
[1:10:54] him
[1:10:55] you must give that honor to the name of
[1:10:56] jesus christ
[1:11:01] that's what people don't understand i
[1:11:03] think sometimes people are afraid of the
[1:11:05] anointing but it is the anointing that
[1:11:07] destroys the yokes
[1:11:09] it is the devil that torments us or try
[1:11:11] to torment
[1:11:12] us every day in our mind y'all know it's
[1:11:14] the truth
[1:11:15] every day he tries to tell me that's
[1:11:18] what the devil means a tormentor
[1:11:22] and that's what he come for to make you
[1:11:25] think
[1:11:26] lesser of the word the word is god
[1:11:30] but he'll come against the word in his
[1:11:33] own little
[1:11:34] demonic way to make you think less
[1:11:39] is that the word the bible says with his
[1:11:41] stripes we are healed
[1:11:43] not going to be we are healed
[1:11:46] but he'll take his little his little uh
[1:11:50] i call it witchcraft he'll take his
[1:11:52] little witchcraft stuff
[1:11:54] and make you feel smell taste
[1:11:58] whatever stuff that has nothing to do
[1:12:00] with the word
[1:12:02] i was telling somebody that over the
[1:12:04] phone from florida today i said you know
[1:12:06] what
[1:12:07] people have a problem with just
[1:12:08] believing the word we do too much
[1:12:11] thinking
[1:12:12] we do too much reasoning god didn't ask
[1:12:14] us to do anything like that
[1:12:15] he just asked us to take the word
[1:12:17] believe it and run with it
[1:12:19] you don't have to figure it out it's
[1:12:20] none of your business
[1:12:22] once you believe it it's god's business
[1:12:26] but we got to see this happen the
[1:12:27] temperature has to go down or
[1:12:29] something gotta you know swelling got to
[1:12:31] go down and that's nonsense
[1:12:34] that's not even the dimension we're
[1:12:35] supposed to work in
[1:12:38] huh our dimension is not the third
[1:12:41] fourth or
[1:12:41] fifth dimension our dimension is the
[1:12:43] sixth dimension
[1:12:45] under the altar where the power of god
[1:12:48] is
[1:12:48] sitting in heavenly places in christ
[1:12:51] jesus
[1:12:52] there's no failure in god but we'll do
[1:12:55] that
[1:12:56] to him that overcometh will i grant to
[1:12:58] sit with me
[1:12:59] in my throne even as i also overcame
[1:13:02] and have set down with my father in his
[1:13:05] throne
[1:13:06] now jesus said he overcame and he's
[1:13:08] sitting in the throne with the
[1:13:09] with the father and this is what i try
[1:13:11] to tell people
[1:13:12] the throne must also be
[1:13:16] a place not necessarily a chair
[1:13:20] because let me ask you a question
[1:13:24] so y'all gonna think i'm crazy how many
[1:13:27] you think could sit in that chair
[1:13:31] but in our minds because we say throne
[1:13:34] when did when let me ask you a question
[1:13:38] we did not know in my father's house
[1:13:40] there are many mentions
[1:13:42] and if it wasn't so i wouldn't have told
[1:13:43] you brother banham said
[1:13:46] they had that wrong
[1:13:49] see what we we must understand it takes
[1:13:52] a revelation of the word
[1:13:54] to bring to us what it really is
[1:13:58] you know we said oh jesus is sitting on
[1:14:00] the right hand of god
[1:14:02] he said there is no right hand
[1:14:05] it's authority but he has to give it to
[1:14:09] us
[1:14:09] so that we can understand what he's
[1:14:12] saying we talk about the throne room
[1:14:15] that's where the bride is but it gives
[1:14:18] us something a picture of something
[1:14:20] so that we can see what it's like and
[1:14:22] what it is
[1:14:28] yes
[1:14:32] the bible said he said in this story as
[1:14:34] he was in his throne so when god was in
[1:14:36] christ
[1:14:36] he was the bible said the fullness of
[1:14:38] god was in him
[1:14:40] and what was god what was jesus at that
[1:14:42] time he was the very throne room of god
[1:14:46] that's what he was we said oh we want
[1:14:48] the throne
[1:14:49] where the throne room is your heart
[1:14:53] royalty deity that's why the holies of
[1:14:56] holies
[1:14:56] had to be deity it was gold everything
[1:14:59] was gold
[1:15:01] that was the throne room your heart is
[1:15:04] where god
[1:15:05] wants to sit it is where he wants to
[1:15:08] rule
[1:15:08] i'm not saying there's not a place in
[1:15:10] heaven but that's not what he's
[1:15:12] constantly he's trying to get you to see
[1:15:15] let thy will be done in earth as it is
[1:15:17] in heaven
[1:15:19] let the throne room be here not there
[1:15:24] hallelujah
[1:15:31] think about it
[1:15:38] even according to revelation chapter 4 2
[1:15:40] in jeffersonville 61 he says now
[1:15:42] the first throne was in heaven and that
[1:15:45] was the judgment seat
[1:15:47] the second throne was in in in in uh
[1:15:50] in christ the third throne is
[1:15:53] is a is in a man that's what he said
[1:15:58] the third throne you're the throne
[1:16:01] god in you hallelujah
[1:16:04] amen we don't need the levites to carry
[1:16:06] us around now we're the walking epistle
[1:16:09] we're the walking word amen
[1:16:13] now i'm not saying they're not they're
[1:16:15] not dimensions amen when you have chairs
[1:16:17] because brother branham saw his chair
[1:16:19] brother saw his dog brother horse
[1:16:22] brother
[1:16:22] and saw a house i'm not saying those
[1:16:24] things don't exist
[1:16:25] but what i'm trying to say is when it
[1:16:28] comes to the word of god
[1:16:29] he's trying to show you that the the the
[1:16:32] the thing that
[1:16:33] moses uh designed or saw in heaven
[1:16:37] was not just that it was you
[1:16:41] the makeup of a man the outer core
[1:16:45] the inner court and the holies of holies
[1:16:48] showed us
[1:16:48] that through all of this how we come
[1:16:51] to god because we're filthy
[1:16:55] hallelujah and we needed a priest
[1:16:58] hallelujah not only just to slay the
[1:17:00] sacrifice and
[1:17:02] and all his shade of blood and you had
[1:17:04] to laugh with that
[1:17:05] excuse me the washing and all of those
[1:17:08] things
[1:17:09] but all of that was law
[1:17:13] all of that was just something to give
[1:17:15] us an idea and israel never caught it
[1:17:18] even though they performed those acts
[1:17:19] for hundreds of years
[1:17:21] they never had the revelation of what it
[1:17:23] was
[1:17:24] and even when jesus christ came as god
[1:17:27] himself
[1:17:28] walking in flesh they still did not
[1:17:32] see the word they didn't have a
[1:17:34] revelation
[1:17:35] now if they didn't have the revelation
[1:17:36] of the man how can they have a
[1:17:37] revelation
[1:17:38] of the things that he said in order he
[1:17:41] told them he said now if you
[1:17:43] love abraham you'll love me because
[1:17:46] before abraham was
[1:17:47] i am not like that would have just did
[1:17:50] something to them but
[1:17:51] it was the natural veil that hid him
[1:17:53] from them
[1:17:55] like it is now is this veil
[1:17:59] this thing that looks so faulty it's
[1:18:01] this veil
[1:18:03] it means that hide god from the people
[1:18:05] today
[1:18:06] always will you think about the mighty
[1:18:09] things that william branham you know god
[1:18:11] did through him
[1:18:12] and the people's eyes were still blind
[1:18:16] why because god had already placed it in
[1:18:18] the word
[1:18:19] that she would be blind and naked
[1:18:23] and don't even know it people of god
[1:18:26] we're more than just
[1:18:27] animals we're more than just human
[1:18:30] beings
[1:18:32] god has placed us into a position to
[1:18:34] become just like him
[1:18:36] in the very image and likeness of god
[1:18:38] hallelujah
[1:18:40] we're not elohim per se but we were with
[1:18:42] him
[1:18:44] we were his attributes hallelujah yes
[1:18:47] sir
[1:18:48] think about it oh if we could just see
[1:18:51] this great plan of god
[1:18:53] the way it really is and where god has
[1:18:55] taken us
[1:18:56] mighty revelation says to him that
[1:19:00] overcometh
[1:19:01] will i grant to sit with me in my throne
[1:19:03] even as i have also came overcame
[1:19:06] and sat down with my father in his
[1:19:08] throne
[1:19:10] hallelujah now i don't know how it's all
[1:19:13] designed
[1:19:14] but i want to say it like this when you
[1:19:16] talk my brother brown said like this he
[1:19:18] said when it's all over
[1:19:19] you'll have the pillow fire above jesus
[1:19:22] then below jesus you'll have the bride
[1:19:27] that same pill of fire will be over the
[1:19:30] head of our lord jesus christ
[1:19:34] hallelujah and the bible says we won't
[1:19:37] even have
[1:19:38] no need for the sun because the lamb is
[1:19:42] the light
[1:19:45] or illuminated they're going to do more
[1:19:47] than just shine brother
[1:19:49] all i know is can you imagine there's
[1:19:52] nothing
[1:19:52] as bright as white as when that light is
[1:19:55] hitting
[1:19:58] my god
[1:20:01] isaiah saw it
[1:20:05] at the end of the day you know what you
[1:20:06] got husband and wife
[1:20:09] all over husband and wife
[1:20:13] husband and wife and their offspring
[1:20:18] blood related you understand me when god
[1:20:22] showed me the real reason
[1:20:23] why cain could not be accepted i'm like
[1:20:26] that's right
[1:20:27] blood related blood was the issue in the
[1:20:32] beginning
[1:20:33] blood and no matter how the serpents
[1:20:36] want to be
[1:20:39] that's the word
[1:20:42] that's what jesus says jesus said you
[1:20:45] don't even have a place of repentance
[1:20:48] i can appreciate you all day and
[1:20:50] there'll still be no repent no no place
[1:20:52] for repentance
[1:20:53] it's not in your dna to do so but you
[1:20:56] get a real
[1:20:57] saint a man or sister god whoever
[1:21:01] amen listen they repent
[1:21:05] god knows how to make them even when
[1:21:07] they feel like they want to be a little
[1:21:08] if bashful is shy or stubborn god knows
[1:21:11] how to put it
[1:21:14] right and so that's how god is one thing
[1:21:16] about a true seed of god
[1:21:18] they know how to repent and they know
[1:21:20] how to confess
[1:21:23] they're not like cain and i ain't
[1:21:27] they're not even like the way adam did
[1:21:28] it they passed the book
[1:21:31] um but when you come to a place and says
[1:21:33] lord it's me as me
[1:21:35] standing in the kneel of prayer let's
[1:21:38] move on
[1:21:39] he says now the third throne is in the
[1:21:42] man
[1:21:44] one two three
[1:21:48] y'all believe that oh ye are the temple
[1:21:51] of god
[1:21:53] that's that's it and we must come to
[1:21:56] recognize that listen people of god i
[1:21:58] don't understand
[1:21:59] i really do not understand but god knows
[1:22:02] you look how god protected brother
[1:22:04] branham from so many things and
[1:22:05] yet instead we're the bride and he let
[1:22:07] us do all kind
[1:22:09] you know so many things happening so
[1:22:11] many things were done this way
[1:22:12] it you know because you know what it's
[1:22:14] just amazing
[1:22:16] it amazes me how god in his
[1:22:20] in his way of doing things take a people
[1:22:22] of no value
[1:22:24] and make some valuable i don't
[1:22:27] understand it
[1:22:28] but he does i'm not going to be too much
[1:22:31] longer
[1:22:32] now he says aj 54 says for thy maker is
[1:22:35] dying husband
[1:22:37] i love that scripture the lord of hosts
[1:22:40] is his name and thy redeemer
[1:22:43] the holy one of israel now that's
[1:22:46] exactly who boaz was
[1:22:48] boaz wasn't ruth's husband he was also
[1:22:52] her redeemer now he wasn't a maker
[1:22:55] but he was a shadow in the title of
[1:22:57] christ
[1:22:59] jesus christ and think about this woman
[1:23:02] i think about
[1:23:03] i think about ruth sometime and it never
[1:23:05] gives a description of
[1:23:07] her life while she was in moab but we
[1:23:09] know the
[1:23:10] more about his people were not a good
[1:23:11] people
[1:23:14] and yet this woman become famous
[1:23:18] she literally is placed into the the
[1:23:21] hall of fame of god
[1:23:24] think about a woman
[1:23:28] i say that respect with respect because
[1:23:30] ruth and esther is the only one that has
[1:23:32] books
[1:23:34] you had great women of god throughout
[1:23:35] the whole bible
[1:23:37] but ruth and esther because the whole
[1:23:40] revelation of redemption
[1:23:42] is centered around those two
[1:23:45] everything the jews ever preached has to
[1:23:48] do with esther
[1:23:49] from the law all the way up to
[1:23:51] redemption
[1:23:53] and then you get ruth you know you look
[1:23:55] at her and she's like
[1:23:56] what god wrote about the gentile world
[1:24:01] one is jewish the other was gentile and
[1:24:04] god shows how a gentile bride becomes
[1:24:06] queen
[1:24:08] royalty hallelujah
[1:24:13] for the lord have called thee as a woman
[1:24:15] forsaken and
[1:24:16] grieved in spirit and a wife of youth
[1:24:20] when thou was refused said the lord for
[1:24:22] a small moment have i
[1:24:24] forsaken thee but with great mercies
[1:24:27] will i gather thee talking about amazing
[1:24:31] grace
[1:24:33] i was saying the other day you and i
[1:24:35] must understand
[1:24:36] we were born fighters
[1:24:42] yes god said to israel i have given you
[1:24:45] this land this is your land
[1:24:48] this is your land you got to fight for
[1:24:51] it
[1:24:52] even though i've given you the victory
[1:24:53] over everything this flesh can bring to
[1:24:56] you
[1:24:57] you still got to fight for it but the
[1:24:59] bible said
[1:25:00] every inch for every inch you got to
[1:25:03] fight for it
[1:25:04] do you really think that this old flesh
[1:25:06] is going to just lay down to you
[1:25:09] you got to fight and paul said i kill it
[1:25:12] every day
[1:25:13] i make sure he's dead every day because
[1:25:16] just as soon as i'm resurrected
[1:25:18] he's resurrected when i wake up he wakes
[1:25:21] up
[1:25:23] oh you got to fight people you know you
[1:25:26] got all of those
[1:25:28] ice in the in the in the um in in in the
[1:25:31] land
[1:25:31] and you got to destroy them all
[1:25:35] you can't just be buddy with them
[1:25:38] because uh
[1:25:39] the bible said have no fellowship with
[1:25:40] darkness
[1:25:42] and understand there are spirits amen
[1:25:44] that's going to anoint this flesh
[1:25:46] and anoint your mind somebody i think oh
[1:25:49] my god who it was
[1:25:50] we were talking the other day and we
[1:25:52] were talking about the greatest battle
[1:25:53] to ever fall into your mind in your mind
[1:25:55] i'm like that's it it started with the
[1:25:58] mind
[1:25:59] it must end with the mind you you
[1:26:03] we lost the battle first in the mind now
[1:26:06] we must win
[1:26:07] the battle in the mind
[1:26:10] it's when you come to know that you know
[1:26:13] good and evil
[1:26:13] and i'm gonna close with this this uh
[1:26:16] this
[1:26:17] particular scripture the bible says
[1:26:20] either make the tree good or make it
[1:26:24] evil
[1:26:26] god ain't taking a tree that's mixed
[1:26:31] you understand me make it good or make
[1:26:34] it evil bitter water can't come and
[1:26:37] sweet water can't come out of the same
[1:26:39] fountain
[1:26:41] it's got to be either good or evil and
[1:26:43] that applies to all of us tonight
[1:26:46] all of us and the truth of the matter is
[1:26:48] you say well lord
[1:26:50] how can i make it good let me tell you
[1:26:52] something
[1:26:56] hagar was not even a part of the
[1:26:58] original promise
[1:27:00] hagar came in because abraham messed up
[1:27:04] and when you think about it god told
[1:27:06] abraham to obey
[1:27:08] to do what sarah says right
[1:27:11] it wasn't the original plan it wasn't
[1:27:13] what god uh uh uh
[1:27:16] you know his promise wasn't going to
[1:27:17] come through hagar
[1:27:20] but that was sarah's thing and that's
[1:27:22] exactly what we do
[1:27:26] that's why you can't have two husbands
[1:27:30] one got to be dead and that's
[1:27:33] that's that's what what did god do he
[1:27:35] allowed
[1:27:36] the hagar ishmael to come in to show you
[1:27:39] that throughout your entire life
[1:27:42] ishmael and isaac are going to be
[1:27:44] fighting
[1:27:45] they're fighting right now even in the
[1:27:48] natural
[1:27:49] and as long as you in this house and
[1:27:52] ishmael is living
[1:27:54] y'all know your flesh is israel right
[1:27:56] he's wild
[1:27:59] he's untapable so you got to kill him
[1:28:01] right
[1:28:02] and and there's no compromising with him
[1:28:05] you the ruler you're the promised son
[1:28:09] but look what god did to hey god when
[1:28:11] hagar
[1:28:12] cried out to god god answered
[1:28:18] but it's so amazing because god god
[1:28:20] didn't didn't
[1:28:21] didn't say okay hey god because you're
[1:28:22] such an honorable woman you know what he
[1:28:24] was concerned about
[1:28:25] her seed
[1:28:29] hersey and though you know she
[1:28:32] she was just a bonds woman
[1:28:35] it was sarah who caused them to do that
[1:28:38] but yet and still god kept his promises
[1:28:42] he did and ishmael to this day
[1:28:45] is the wealthiest perhaps of all nations
[1:28:48] they got all the oil and all of that
[1:28:52] that's bishop god kept his promise
[1:28:56] and if god kept his promise to that seed
[1:28:59] what about the original what about the
[1:29:02] real seed of god
[1:29:04] he kept his promise and i believe i'm so
[1:29:07] excited
[1:29:08] i'm excited tonight because i don't know
[1:29:10] when god is going to move
[1:29:12] i know he's moving he's already moving
[1:29:15] but god's getting ready to take us
[1:29:16] somewhere
[1:29:18] oh yes his promise is sure
[1:29:22] and his seed i'm not talking about
[1:29:24] pentecost
[1:29:25] it's gonna be i'm talking about bride
[1:29:27] seed the out the omega seed
[1:29:30] must be it has to declare
[1:29:33] the original everybody else has
[1:29:36] something
[1:29:37] added to it but this bride will be pure
[1:29:40] word
[1:29:41] can you imagine it pure word
[1:29:46] god himself and flesh all over again
[1:29:51] it's amazing people say the son of man
[1:29:52] but brother baby said the bride is the
[1:29:54] son of man
[1:29:55] there's a quote now not as directly as i
[1:29:58] said it but it's there
[1:30:00] well how can the bride be the son of man
[1:30:02] because she became him
[1:30:04] he is the son of man it doesn't mean
[1:30:08] that god is god
[1:30:08] god got us amen in a in a way of
[1:30:11] prophetic uh
[1:30:12] ministry like brother brethren that
[1:30:13] ain't what he stopped because when
[1:30:15] people hear that that's all they think
[1:30:18] about
[1:30:20] but understand thou must prophesy again
[1:30:26] that's all i'm trying to tell you thomas
[1:30:29] prophesied
[1:30:30] again eat the book because thou must
[1:30:33] prophesy again
[1:30:36] and when it comes to those things that
[1:30:38] means god is going to speak things
[1:30:40] through you sometimes he does it anyway
[1:30:44] and you don't even know it but the point
[1:30:46] of the the point i'm trying to blame
[1:30:48] break is that if we don't go up higher
[1:30:50] which
[1:30:51] you got to ask lord deliver me
[1:30:54] israel would have never been delivered
[1:30:55] if they didn't cry out for it
[1:30:58] you got to cry out for it people lord i
[1:31:00] want to be in your image i want to be in
[1:31:02] your likeness
[1:31:03] god i feel the pull i feel the pull i
[1:31:06] believe the word of god we're the sons
[1:31:07] of god hallelujah
[1:31:09] i believe i'm the throne of god i
[1:31:10] believe i'm not a housing of god i want
[1:31:13] to see you manifest
[1:31:15] make yourself known through me by way of
[1:31:16] your word by way of your anointing
[1:31:19] you know by way of your people however
[1:31:22] here i am lord
[1:31:24] and so that we'll understand in closing
[1:31:26] it doesn't mean that we're going to all
[1:31:28] be
[1:31:29] heroes you know what i mean by that it
[1:31:32] doesn't mean that you're going this is
[1:31:33] not a one-man show
[1:31:36] and when you think about the the new
[1:31:38] testament church
[1:31:40] you know when they really got a lot of
[1:31:41] things done is when they join together
[1:31:43] as one
[1:31:45] that's when the supernatural showed up
[1:31:48] you love the lord thank god for his
[1:31:51] grace
[1:31:53] let's stand and have a word of prayer
[1:31:56] that's our song need to prepare to come
[1:31:58] father we so thank you for your grace
[1:32:00] and your mercy
[1:32:01] i know the message was short but i pray
[1:32:04] lord that something was said that
[1:32:06] would give the people inside of who we
[1:32:08] are
[1:32:09] sometimes they scare people when you
[1:32:12] word things that
[1:32:13] seem to be different but you're saying
[1:32:15] the same thing
[1:32:17] you're keeping the revelation right
[1:32:20] within the word of god
[1:32:22] and lord i know that whether it be the
[1:32:25] tree of life
[1:32:27] whether it be the burning bush whether
[1:32:30] it be a donkey that
[1:32:32] you had to speak through to to correct
[1:32:35] baylor
[1:32:37] you change yourself you manifest
[1:32:40] yourself in ways
[1:32:42] how the scripture says we've seen him in
[1:32:45] the world
[1:32:46] we've seen him in the light we've seen
[1:32:49] him in the thunder
[1:32:50] but now we're seeing him lord in that
[1:32:52] small still voice
[1:32:55] oh god i pray lord god that to be
[1:32:57] merciful to us
[1:32:58] that we'll be able to see that this
[1:33:00] whole book
[1:33:02] testify of you if there is a character
[1:33:05] it is the character of this bible and
[1:33:07] the bible's character is you
[1:33:10] and lord you told us to eat the book
[1:33:13] because we'll prophesy again that means
[1:33:15] we'll preach we'll be
[1:33:16] those who becomes the living word
[1:33:20] not of noah's day not of luther or
[1:33:22] wesley day not a pentecostal day
[1:33:25] but this day with a bride coming
[1:33:28] to her full adoption when we come to
[1:33:31] that place lord jesus that
[1:33:33] you will speak and anoint us whatsoever
[1:33:37] we say
[1:33:38] it shall be done even as you did it
[1:33:40] through
[1:33:41] malachi 4 i believe god that it is here
[1:33:44] for the bride
[1:33:45] no it'll never be an open show but we
[1:33:49] know lord jesus that the
[1:33:51] master of the house has come and i pray
[1:33:54] lord god tonight that you
[1:33:56] take those little things that we said
[1:33:59] inspired by you that the people will
[1:34:02] begin to see and put these things
[1:34:04] together to see that
[1:34:06] all of the things that we we know
[1:34:11] whether it be symbolic or not
[1:34:14] we know that everything represents you
[1:34:18] and your bride help us see our place
[1:34:22] help us to see the position that we're
[1:34:25] to be in
[1:34:26] there's so many dimensions of you
[1:34:29] sometimes you pull a little something
[1:34:30] from here
[1:34:31] and pull a little something from there
[1:34:34] we do have a reality lord that there is
[1:34:36] a true city
[1:34:37] we know these things but when it comes
[1:34:40] to
[1:34:40] the art of god when it comes to
[1:34:44] the throne of god is no longer
[1:34:48] hidden behind the veil carried by the
[1:34:51] levites
[1:34:53] it's now in the human heart and i pray
[1:34:56] father god that the
[1:34:58] revelation of this will grow
[1:35:01] to us such a magnitude that we will
[1:35:04] become one even as you pray that we will
[1:35:06] be one
[1:35:07] according to saint john 17. bless us
