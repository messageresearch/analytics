thank you lord for the rest that you provide us that we rest in you and not forsake your voice to be drawn to where you want us to be cleansed of the inward parts of our heart we thank you lord for the faith the spirit of god mixed with your word and without it the word is the word killeth he said the grafted word killeth but the spirit gives life and we thank you for your spirit for being mindful of our need to be drawn to you to be cleansed and refilled with your holy ghost oil and extra oil we thank you lord for this place that you've prepared tonight this assembly we thank you lord for the words of life that you have in store for us as our brother lifted up to you the names we're not certain over the progress but he said that we just apply your word to their need and we know that your scripture shows that the prayer of faith shall heal a second lord we had that opportunity this morning before we went on our way that that your faith be deposited in our hearts that's your very nature your divine nature be deposited by you lord in our hearts and so we know that that faith the prayer of faith will heal those we think of sister angela who the lord had a need for her hemoglobin count was so low at six and today it's nine and we just thank you for the healing that you've put in her mortal body your scripture says that as our soul prospereth so are we in health and

hallelujah i woke up this morning with my mind [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen [Applause] hallelujah we're living in a day that we got to keep our minds on the lord times are hard things are changing amen jumping and shouting with my mind [Applause] [Music] i'm jumping and shouting with my [Music] hello [Music] amen thank you brother i forgot that portion nobody could sing it like our late sister johnson she's going on to be with the lord ah what a friend she was a true friend as we stand we're glad to have everybody here tonight amen everybody look like you're expecting something amen well i came expecting to [Laughter] by the grace of god as we stand we're going to ask that you turn with us by the grace of god to scripture here genesis the sixth chapter it's kind of like a series but it's kind of like a tie-in to what i've been preaching lately uh the the reason why i keep striking this uh i hope by god's grace he'll give it your understanding because um i believe that we're living in the last days and we keep saying that but it was a time when the prophet lived it was three minutes to midnight and so you can imagine where we are now uh having our second president who is now catholic uh visiting the pope and we know uh by god's grace to prophecy was that they would make a union and of course uh this one could make a union with our president he probably wouldn't even realize it but nevertheless he's there and we know that that is a true sign of where we are uh we know by god's grace that uh uh things gonna turn um in the negative for israel and uh we we can see the handwriting on the wall and that's another sign uh because when they turn that means uh those two prophets that they are to receive uh will be there by god's grace now i i saw in a quote where brother branham said that they were transported so that's amazing if that's what's going to happen and we know that's possible because we know that john was transported and enoch was translated and philip was transported ezekiel was translated and transported and whatever more he had happened to him we we know that uh science is not the author of this thing uh we've been doing this for hundreds of years now thousands if you want to say it but we do know by god's grace however it happened the world will know nothing about it uh when jesus came they really thought he was just a man they didn't see that he was more than a man and even to this day there are those who never who believed that he never rose again but we are witnesses that he he lives and uh so we want to read this uh scripture in genesis and trust by god's grace it'll be a blessing to you i remember when everything started happening uh the lord jesus took me to the scripture uh and uh and he said this is what he told me this is where we are so i believe with all my heart that we are at a time of destruction genesis the sixth chapter and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they choose and the lord said my spirit and the lord said that my spirit i'm sorry shall not always strive with man excuse me for that he also is flesh yet his days shall be 120 years there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of god came unto the daughters of men and they bear the children to them the same became mighty men which were of old men of renown and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and repented the lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart and the lord said i will destroy men whom i have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and the creeping things and the fowls of the air for it repented me that i have made man but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord let us pray heavenly father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for your goodness lord we appreciate you and we love you lord dearly uh when from our hearts is our desire to be one of those perfect ones that you chose before the foundation of the world father we believe that we are and that's why we're pressing and this is why we're in a position in our hearts and our minds uh to go on with you lord no matter what in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated uh this is not a message that's going to try to provoke fear in you but it's something that i believe god wants us to understand and really the word of god blesses us in so many ways because the bible in itself tells our story sometimes it's things piece by piece by peace but once you put them all together you'll find that the people that lived in this bible are no different than you and some of the things that they had to encounter you and i encountered uh we realized we don't know i mean we've been talking about the coming of the lord for the longest we really don't know how much longer we do have but we do know that we don't have that much more time and one of the reasons why i'm bringing this is because when we're all saved every one of us who have made jesus christ our savior the bible says once we confess with our mouth and believe within our hearts that he's our savior he becomes our savior and the bible says that we pass from death unto life but we are a different group we're not just saved but we have been chosen we have been elected we are the true seed of god that god hid even from lucifer from the devil he had no idea what god was going to do i believe in in genesis 3 16 when he talked about uh the woman bruising the head of the serpent then the head of the serpent bruising the heel he still didn't have an understanding because he's a counter-minded creature and only those who have the holy ghost can understand what god is talking about so he he himself thought that he he was going to destroy god by killing the natural seed of god and he had no idea by killing the natural seed of god really made provisions for god to bring the spiritual seed amen and you know he killed cain and he thought came uh excuse me cain killed abel and thought he was killing god seed and and this is what i said the other night this is why satan still believed he can overthrow god because he overthrew adam but he didn't really overthrow adam he overthrew eve and adam willfully sin the bible says amen so but still through that act satan became god of this world amen and a lot of times people say well why god would do this and why god would do that but they don't understand what took place satan became god of this world when he took the throne if i could say right the power of the throne away from adam now we must understand that in this day and time there's a preparation time and you and i must know who we are see if you got to know who you are right it doesn't matter how poor and wretched you used to be but once you come into god you must come to the to the to the knowledge of who you are or what he has made you now my subject tonight is the the two natures in the church and if i was to have a sub-topic it would be preparing to meet him one thing for certain all of us will have to meet him one way or another it would make you think men who science who who who really people who really believe in science you know they they're always looking for a way of eternal life something to extend the life you know they they will go to the extreme uh ways of doing things to to prolong their lives and what they don't understand is their life can't really be prolonged uh god has a date and a time for you to die as he did for you to be born and so no matter how many creams and how many pills and how many scientific inventions they come up with you can lay yourself in a in a glass tube thinking that someday science is going to come up with a way to resurrect you but it's impossible because life is god and once you can define god amen you become equal with god now so we understand by god's grace you know uh let me let me say uh you use this one quote brother branham uh speaks of really really uh that really helped me he said may i stop right here just a minute and say i believe that the people are in the preparation of the last great destruction this world will ever know i believe we're at the end you may speak to people and you can put a billigram in every city in the united states they'll drink whiskey and smoke cigarettes and laugh at you and everything else just the same they are in the spirit of the last days and god uh cannot excuse me um sin destruction before the people are in the spirit of destruction god never did destroy anything man always destroys himself so we must say okay then what is the spirit of destruction it's what you see everything everything they're destroying your food by high breeding that's destruction uh they're destroying the air by way of pollution they're destroying you right and and a lot of times we we we look at the things i put away i'm not against vaccines but not all vaccines are good things to do uh uh uh uh uh penicillin still i'm not pronouncing that word right but you know what i'm saying you can work it so long till it literally becomes your enemy right in other words it won't work for you out the while so we look at these things and we see that science always backfire it never it'll never take you any higher and and you know let me say like this scientists believe in evolving and i think to myself you know if we are involved evolving into what i'm looking at now stop [Laughter] take me no further because i do not want to evolve into what i'm looking at now are these hideous creatures that are now calling themselves human now i'm saying these things because you got to realize that all of these things are influencing you in one way or another if you don't resist it hallelujah you will become it let me say it again if you don't resist it you will become it now we know brother branham said that when those demons that was loose uh from the river euphrates and those same demons that literally influenced hitler and and and and and in the world war two and all that he said when when when they left they actually went to hollywood now we know that we didn't we can look back now and we can see the influence of what hollywood had on the world hollywood my son is not he might be but anyway you know because everything that came out of that wasn't so evil but you can see the liberal spirit that came out of that and it destroyed the churches because they didn't resist it they took part they became partakers of it and now the church in itself has become the world you understand what i'm saying see there's no difference because when you see the characteristics of what the world is doing and you compare the characteristic to what the church is doing it is the same right so what i'm trying to say and that's what i was trying to say last week the mark of the beast begins with character the changing of your character right i mean the mark doesn't come till after your character has changed is that the truth it is because the bible said uh if a man looketh upon a woman to lust after her she's already committed adultery see so the adultery part comes into a man before he commits the and that's the way the mark of the beast is because what happens is you begin to reason with the word and you allow the word to be interpreted to you differently than what god said it would be is that what happened and and when eve did that allow the devil to interpret that word then the very inspiration that he interpret the word to her with gave birth and that birth that child was named cain and cain began to express the characteristics of what his father he became a murderer of the word he resisted the word is that right and and understand in resisting the word god put him out and marked him right now we're talking about seeds now that seed was marked and one thing that that seed bought the seed was it could never repent and humble itself to the word even though it may know what the word says it will never humble itself to the word and it will allow his father the serpent to always interpret the word to him to mean something different than what god intended is that the truth i mean we seen that amen even even when it came to judas judas was a disciple of christ chosen by christ but jesus said i i've chosen 12 and one is a devil what was it the characteristics he knew when pressure come how that seed would react now watch judas because if you look at judas judas had the right intent he thought he was pressuring god or pushing god in a position to to become that kind of messiah he thought he would be but when he saw that jesus himself didn't react in the way he wanted him to act because he didn't understand jesus didn't come as the conqueror that he thought he was going to come see most of them had their interpretation that jesus himself was going to ride in on a white horse he was going to overthrow rome and this is what was in the mind of judas he truly never listened to what jesus was trying to tell him because jesus told him that he would be crucified hallelujah but he wanted to alter the word he wanted to push the you can't alter the word you can't push the word in the corner hallelujah the word is the word and god is only going to do what his mind his mind thought produced that's right hallelujah right now think about it you you know i don't want to get off on this thought but just think about your thoughts how many times you think oh i just thought a thought no your thoughts come so quickly it makes your body move you couldn't you couldn't keep up with thoughts you don't even know where they come from they're so fast right i mean your thoughts blink your eye your thoughts make you speak hallelujah but god was so such a god he could catch every thought hallelujah speaking into existence and you the thought that he thought about lord never miss the beat but you see those thoughts in itself amen was what became genes of god amen hallelujah see because jesus declared there is no darkness in me i love that jesus says there is he told his disciples his devil and everybody there is no darkness in me hallelujah there is no unrighteousness there's not a filthy thing in me everything i do i do according to the word so do you know what that means to be in him it means that if you in him you can't be darkness hallelujah see now this is the thing we told you by god's grace think about it now in the days of noah it had gotten so bad and you know scientists you know they you know they're good for what they you know it's sometimes they're right and i don't mean to be so hard but i know we're living in a time where people worship science and science is not god something created that right it's like you go a scientist is a man that goes into a laboratory that's already been made and you go in there trying to figure out all the things that's in that laboratory and sometimes you'll catch it and then you say oh i got it now well you didn't do that you just figured it out right so you look at this thing it's the truth if scientists are so great tell them how to produce life without life right don't tell me he made you greater than god oh i can make a i can make this and i'll make it that like somebody said well if you can make a something great use your own saying right because you've got to use what's been already created in order to let me get back to where i'm supposed to i'm supposed to be so what i'm trying to say is this god in the time of noah we know it was violence gang violence is that right i mean everything was going on in noah's day like it is now otherwise we're living in a different day right but you got to understand as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in this day right so but you've got to understand when i say this is i'm coming back from cain and abel right and we know that cain killed abel trying to uh uproot the royal seed of god then god amen comes along and he produces seth right and then sept was a shadow and a type of the resurrection because the the bible said when sept was then brought forth then men began to worship their lord again so you gotta understand there was a period of time where there was no true worship amen but god restored the reworship by producing a new seed his seed which was called self this is why i can't figure out those of us who claim to be messaged we don't know how to worship hallelujah but you must understand that the worship is in the sea it's in the gene you don't have to put it on it's a come on it's something that happens even when you can't you can't even control it that's when the gene has been how can they say charge of the gene itself that's the word activated amen hallelujah is that right because you know when brother bob came he told about the pill of fire and how the pill of fire danced and that was god dancing and worshiping now that same light supposed to be in you right see that's the life of the seed every seed like i said like the other night every seed that is planted do not come up because it lacks the the seed or the life of the seed right but when that sun strikes that seed amen that has life in it that seed must give way to the life it must rot it must die amen in order for that life to come up hallelujah you see what i'm saying there are stages in which that seed has to go through in order to produce the life amen hallelujah we can see by god's grace that in that time of noah noah built an ark and when the ark had gone through the great tribulation y'all know how it is noah gave it a test the new world gave it a test and see let me tell you something everybody that claimed to be christians you're going to be tested hallelujah now that ark represented christ jesus christ one door you heard me say that the other day and noah was preaching in the door showing that the only way you can get in the doors you had to come by noah but that door represented jesus christ y'all understand me so there was one window and when it came to testing after the 40 days and nights you know how it was the ship settled down on mount erak and noah tested the grounds i'm talking about nature's now and he took those two birds he sent that crow out and of course the first time the water was still not abated but that second time he the last time he took that that crew out he never did return but the dub did because the dove could not eat that dead caucus of destruction i love to word it that way the dove could not eat the dead carcass of destruction but the crow boy he had a jubilee he had a feast he probably died eating he has so much to feast off and you got to understand when you have when you're working with the dove that's i'm working with nature now as long as you can eat the dead caucus of destruction of this world you have not yet been born again amen that's what i'm working with and we find out that there are people in this church in this message because somebody has taught you because i believe the message i am bride that is a lie the devil believes the message you must be born again that is what it is you can't bypass it it is what is needed you love that we can't allow ourselves to uh allow the world to uh filter through us or come through us if i could say like that uh the words i'm looking for is not there but nevertheless we can't eat of the world and expect to go to heaven you can't do it i mean you can do it but you your trip will be canceled you won't be able to make it because no unclean thing understand this world we're going through there will never be a memory left of this thank god hallelujah when jesus said i will wipe the tears away from your eyes he's literally saying i'm gonna wipe your memory from everything that ever happened to you you will never understand it you'll never see it you won't miss the uncle the brother the daddy the father whoever didn't make it it will be wiped away thank god for his grace because heaven will never be heaven if you can remember your old loved ones think about it the conditions lawlessness that's why people don't understand well what you mean defunding the pray for the defunding the police it must be because in that day it was lawlessness it has to come to this it's not going to stop it's going to continue to progress in the way of destruction wars and rumors of wars pestilence and all of these things and we understand now that the pestilence just didn't happen they were developed as it was in the days of noah and those those scientists were far more smarter than what we are and now they're telling us that they have found germs and viruses underneath the ice that's now melting and they wouldn't even know what to do with them hallelujah you say oh brother don't you see it that great tribulation period where men will be walking with rotted flesh they make mockery and they put out these things about zombies and all that but what they don't understand is that they're projecting an image of a future they won't be dead but they will be in a place that they would wish they were dead that missed the rapture will have to face this kind of condition hallelujah it won't be the the arab countries in all of these other countries that's going to be bombing everything look what's happening now they're moving in on us why because as america we rejected the gospel and because we have rejected the gospel god has rejected us oh they might not want to hear it but it's the truth it's the truth not just america the whole world nobody wants to know the true jesus christ they don't mind religion but they don't want to see the real thing everybody wants to be free let me move on so that you know that but that god how can we say god didn't want us because even in the days of noah noah was the prophet noah warned the people and the more he warned the people the more evil they became see because when you reject truth you become evil you literally give satan rule over your body from that point on it's the truth look what judas did when he rejected jesus he became the murderer of god if i could say it like that he murdered jesus oh you say he didn't he did and he would be judged as a murderer you said all he did was betray him that's what he did but because of his betrayal they were able to identify him and because they could identify him they crucified him so you go back to the root of it and it has to tie back in with with uh with uh uh kane but kane because cain killed abel at the altar and judas killed jesus at the altar is god good to us no wonder when god reveals these things to you something takes place on the inside hallelujah this gospel seeing something it seems insane you mean to tell me y'all gonna be raptured absolutely these these aliens you're looking for they're here already hallelujah what this is the true christian who's the alien we came from god and we'll go back to god amen hallelujah and think about it we'll be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye hallelujah we won't have to say we're beaming up scotty it will happen before we think about it hallelujah and our prophet said we'll travel like a thought glory to god we won't need automobiles we won't need planes we won't need any of these man-made contraptions because everything they make is good and evil biting off of the tree of knowledge of good and evil hallelujah but god is good to us god is good to us when it comes to the truth we stagger not he said lord i i i listen let me say it like this none of us rule god god is god amen god determines what he's going to do and whether we understand it or not he does now explain to me why god told abraham sarah is right go into hagar and hagar gets pregnant and have a wild man what god wanted the two to keep moving side by side because he had a purpose for it happening is that right god needed can i say it like this god needed the devil [Laughter] hallelujah because if there was never no darkness you'll never know what light is he needed the devil to do ju he didn't make him do it but he knew he would do it hallelujah and he became the great enemy of god but you got to understand the devil still works for god is that right because the devil can't do nothing he said what do you mean when it came to job the devil was walking to and fro and the lord said what up what you doing he's at all i'm just walking to and fro basically saying i'm trying to find somebody i can devour and god said have you considered my servant job [Laughter] i think joe if he could have just saw that he was like hold up lord hold up but you see cause none of us want to go through trials none of us want to go through the hardships of things like that but we must understand that's the way god produces the good stuff amen right it takes lightning and thundering and rain to produce those beautiful flowers you understand me it take a rugged jagged sky amen to produce the beautiful things of the earth and so it takes those because of the fall now because of the fall god even uses the negative to produce the positives so anyway but when god has done something for you and i'm gonna be jumping back and forth because you got to understand these two seeds these two these two is like the dove and the crow now the dove he can't he has no gall so he can't eat the worldly things of god of the devil he can't he can't do it he'll get sick he'll die if you try to do it you're going to get sick and you're going to die unless you repent you see what i'm saying so what i'm trying to say is this so when you see those two natures you had cain and you had abel you had jacob and you had esau and sometimes it looked like the guy who is a god he looks like a devil right when we we before we got converted we all looked like devils we acted like devils we did devilish things and the prophet god said what it was and because of the hybriding you looked like a cockapoo but on the inside you had the wheat germ so when the holy spirit struck you it wasn't the the cockapoo that came alive it was the wheat germ inside of you that transforms us i love it but there's one man who who's uh uh literally grew up among pagans and heathens and you name it and you know they were just uh known for uh idol worshipping and y'all know who i'm talking i'm talking about abram whose name later was changing to abraham but when he met god think about it how did he know the voice of god how do you know it it's something in you that was put in you before the foundation of the world you didn't have to figure it out you say hey this sounds right right it draws you you can't even stop it amen because it keeps pulling on you because you know in your soul it's right you can't figure that out you maybe can you maybe maybe not can you can't explain it but it's just something that grabs you and that's the way it was with abram and evidently he lived up in in some kind of wealth because he packed it up trying to bring it with him lot and everybody else amen didn't even know where he was going now look how crazy that looks or seems amen you're going somewhere and you don't even have a destiny where are you going i don't know but i'm getting out of here but that's the way i felt about the domination that i was in i didn't know where i was going but i was getting out of that and so it pulls on you it draws you amen into a place amen you don't even know but then after a while that voice began to communicate with you in a way that you don't even you can't even understand it how well how i can hear him and nobody else can hear it see that's how it is you can hear his voice and somebody could be standing right next to you and won't hear a thing but because of who you are that's why you were able to hear it and that's why jesus says my sheep will hear he they hear my voice you might look like a goat right now but it's just that you need a name to change hallelujah he said my sheep hears my voice because in your soul you are sheep and the bible's uh brother i'm saying like this you're either serpent or you are dove hallelujah but let's move on the bible says he staggered not talking about abraham at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god unbelief is sin that's the root of all sin now oh god of my bride what you mean am i bride where if comes in that when the word calls you it identifies you when you respond it re it identifies who you are hallelujah you never see a cow responding to a horse cows respond to cows horses or horses sheep the sheep and goat to go and when god called you he gave you a sheep call a shepherd's call and you responded to him that's who you are but the problem is we all need to clean up we all need to clean up it ain't even oh i'm right no we need to sanctify ourselves consecrate ourselves so we can see the move of god in this place the devil has no right coming in here no right amen like i said a few a week or so ago that spirit that was in here we could net we'll never let that happen again stagger not at the promise of god hallelujah but we're strong in faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform not halfway fully fully persuaded right fully persuaded that god was able amen to perform come on somebody see that's what makes things work for you you can't come to god with a make-believe faith some mental thing you got in your mind and as soon as something happened your mind breaks no this faith must come from the throne i don't know how i know but i know and that revelation can only be given to you by god don't let the devil take it from you you can't because once you fully persuade it there's no room for no room for unbelief that's like filling the cup there's no room for nothing else right and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness wait a minute y'all understand me you understand the word when it was fully persuaded he was full so god imputed it you understand that means no matter how many times he fell and how many times he came short because he believed god was more than able to bring him to that place god gave it to him amen it takes the weight off of your shoulder and it puts it back on jesus is that right that's what the bible said he was a he he had the he was the counselor the almighty god the prince of peace he if the government was upon his shoulder hallelujah you understand me he he's he's the head of it all y'all keep it up and i'm gonna become shouting john up here but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up jesus our lord from the dead uh you know what i'm gonna tell you something he raised him from the dead i'm gonna say it again he raised him from the dead so we've got no business being in here dead that's right he raised him from the dead we have no business being dead in here we should if anybody should be making noise it's supposed to be us the prophet god was just talking on one of those tapes today he said the pentecostal church has gotten so bad now you can't even see him on the streets witnessing no more and you don't sometimes you'll see people witness on the on on the corners and things and you think well he don't go to my church that's nonsense a brother is a brother and if he's preaching jesus you ought to say amen when we was out there to the park we had some people come join us and sing with us you know the thing and problem is we have a denominational mind even though we say we're not denominational hallelujah by one spirit are we baptized into christ and one day we'll come to know that because brother adam said when that squeeze comes your doctrine won't mean a thing you're going to see somebody standing for jesus and you're going to jump you're going to shout you're going to be glad you see oh my god god bless you brother you're not going to say what church you belong to no no no no it won't be like that at all see this is the kind of thing is once you denominate yourself you'll never be able to love others that's right it's a devil's trick to keep you from loving somebody who's different from you and you got to love all even your enemy hallelujah i'll never de-christianize a man because you know what i know where i used to be and you can't tell me when i was back there i wasn't a christian i may not have understood everything i know now but when jesus when jesus touched me he touched me then hallelujah that's one of those things nobody can take from me i don't care what oh you didn't get it until you came into the message well what was the message the message have always been jesus christ and you trying to tell me i think i couldn't get jesus christ until let me ask you a question when did brother branham get it huh did he get the holy ghost in 63 when did he get it he got it when he was a baptist [Music] not even the trinitarian doctrine stopped him from getting the holy ghost but because he got the holy ghost and led him into the truth somebody help me here see people you know we got to wash our mind from all this nonsense we've got to be an example of divine love and how can you win anybody amen thinking you're better than somebody some pharisee of some sort that's not god remember i told you that ferris that that that uh seed that that bad seed always look for preeminence going to be something greater mr truth that's what the pharisees they wanted to be preeminent and then john came and identified him said you generation of vipers right you're looking like you're all holy but inside you're dead men's bones and let me say it like this i don't care how long people have preached this message if the character of christ is not in them they're still dead they may have potential we all have potential but god is not resting on potential we've got to get there i'm finna i'm going to come it's the truth that's why you got people saying and doing all kinds of things and you know lord noble people and all kinds of stuff people are doing in the name of the message and people got the message and they let them do it uh-uh no hallelujah splitting churches and everything and the bible said when a man spent a church he seemed to have the holy ghost jews said he don't even have it amen lord help us second timothy through 20 says nevertheless i love this the foundation of god stands ashore having this seal the lord knoweth them that are his so you understand the rapture means a few yeah brother said to be a few a few that means that a lot of people in this message gonna miss it why because they the devil has duped them the devil has twisted the idea of what life is and life is not prosperity and that's what a lot of people say oh i'm prospering oh look how big my church is now i got thousands of people let me ask you how many of them are converted we get them to we get them to the message but how many truly are converted that's all i'm saying the emphasis is conversion you must be born again you've got to have the life of christ in you that all damnable nature must die it must rot from the pulpit all the way to the back of the door it cannot remain alive and ex and and and then you make a rapture jesus brother baby said however the tree fall that's how it laid how it laid you know however it falls that's how it lays excuse me nevertheless having this foundation of god standing ashore having this seal the lord knoweth them that are his and i'm gonna come to my real subject in a moment and let everyone that name the name of christ depart from iniquity flee also use for lust but follow righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the lord out of what a pure heart and remember only the pure and hard shall see god hallelujah glory to god look what the prophet god says in the signs of his time 1963 he says under luther it was the same holy spirit justification then sanctification on the wesley the message then the baptism of the holy ghost making three three not three steps of grace but three stations there's a difference when you're at a station you're at a place of change you've got to change it's not enough to be justified but you got to be sanctified and you stay right there in that station until you are sanctified then when you're sanctified then god will come down and seal you like you ought to be but we'll scream god grace grace don't you understand god's word is your grace it is the thing that god gives you to keep you from the judgment he tells you his thoughts and what he desired for you to be and because he gives it to you that is your grace you say well what do you mean the grace of god to know what's to show know how to prepare an ark hallelujah the grace of god to us is show us how to enter into it who is christ jesus pray for me and i pray for you nor was the baptism baptism baptized eight souls out of the whole world think about it then god comes along and he sanctifies the world through the blood of jesus christ and when you're when the blood of jesus dropped on the earth it's sanctified see that's why i try to tell people every man that want to be saved you can be saved right you can because god saved you brother adam said people are not saved because they reject their atonement they reject it it's already done for you but when you reject it what god can do he can't do nothing because you rejected it is that right then john says listen i baptize you with water but then there's one coming after me he's going to baptize you with the holy ghost and fire amen god have mercy where is it in this message where is the holy ghost and fire huh amen oh that's two pentecostals but see brother branham said that's the only kind this message can produce are you going to argue with that we got too much control we control the holy ghost are you serious the problem is we don't know how to yield to him and we're too prideful pride is the key we're too prideful god want to dance in you and you don't want to dance one day he's going to stop asking you to dance and then you're going to wish you could you love the lord i'm not trying to be rough i'm just trying to be straight is that okay now brother brandon said it like this in preparation he says brother it's got to take the holy spirit a new a new birth a regeneration a new creature not a passed up job see as long as you're sanctified you're going to feel patched up but when god comes and change the full nature of you that's the whole thing you understand me we we you know we still deal with too much self traveling through this in this station but but but we didn't have no problem with justification i think i think not right but you know there's a lot of people who's never been to calvary they don't know what justification is they don't see the suffering of their lord for them they don't understand we quoted oh he became our sin that we might become his righteousness but there is more to that it's excruciating what he did for you it you've got to understand the shame he went through for you and you must enter into that like like the prophet god said when you want somebody to heal you got to enter into their suffering you need to enter into the suffering of christ to underst it will cause you to reverence him it will cause you to love him hallelujah you think about the most pain you have ever endured and you still haven't touched what he had to go through at calvary and he did it for you and me amen you know bring us to a shame because you got to understand he was naked so that we can be clothed now i know what they do on those pictures and they put a little wrap little thing around his garment he looks his way but listen he had nothing he was totally exposed for who god on earth god the holy holies of all holies was put to shame for you and me and that's what isaiah said we we looked on him like it was us huh we don't know what his grief and sorrows was but he did it just for you you said well what do you mean just think about it think about the time when god was getting ready to destroy sodom and gomorrah and then god at the same time was dealing with abraham and then abraham couldn't have a seed right and then god says i'm going to visit you according to the time of life who did he come to who did he come to he came to miss abraham amen he came to his wife he impregnated her oh god oh my god do you really think brother brandon was trying to tell you something when he said never have there been in the time of history a man named with the last name or last part of his name ham what was he trying to tell he was trying to tell you the same day abraham was living in now we're living in and god is now impregnating a woman with who his seed bringing her to a place where she can have his image and his likeness she failed but now she's being resurrected hallelujah she'll not fall like the eve before no sir she's been ordained to stand on the word and produce that word and though we be few in number it'll not come back forward this is not about a group or sect or cult or click or whatever you might want to call it this is an individual affair thank god for william branham amen you love the lord now you got to understand what i'm going where i'm going with this and i'm almost done i know it's a wednesday night so i tried my best not to be too long and i probably have been too long already but just give me a few more minutes okay the problem is we underestimate the devil we take him for granted we we don't even we try you know we almost don't pay him no attention the whole time he's working on you yeah you better watch out the bible said watch and pray your adversary the devil has a roaring lion what he goes seeking son to do what to to devour you think you're not one of them oh you are but let us not be foolish i have a sherry without the holy ghost gotta eons of time on us he knows all about you he knows your grandpa your grandma you oh you take it all the way back he knows him he knows all the weaknesses that's in your flesh don't you ever take him for granted you better put on the whole arm of god that's the only way you'll be able to stand against the wiles of the devil take them for granted if you want to hallelujah you know what i'm going to tell you something i don't have all of my teeth because i took them for granted you don't wash them and keep them clean guess what they gonna rot there's always a penalty for it neglect you understand what i'm trying to say you neglect to stay you can't this is your salvation this is this is your hope this is your faith this is what you live for this is what we live for there's no you know what i'm trying to say we all have that period of time where we neglect but a wake up out of your sleep now it's hard time to wake out of the sleep amen let's go on i got a couple of quotes and then i'll be done here in the message israel in the church and he says watch it it's moving right out today in a terrible force y'all heard that terrible force oh it behooves you my brother sister to consider what you're listening at and don't you never underestimate satan's power for deceiving don't you never underestimate him he's smooth as can be and the antichrist spirit isn't communism no the antichrist spirit is so close like the real thing it'll deceive the very elect if possible jesus says so matthew 24 it's a religious spirit oh why cain and abel were brothers the crow and the doves said on the same roof esau and jacob were brothers judas and jesus was in the same church and that's what i'm talking about don't get discouraged when you see people acting unchristian like when they act unchristian like it is a spirit that makes them do that and i'm not trying to say that they're the crow but it is not when it's not the holy you'll know it hallelujah the holy ghost does not behave itself unseemly and on the preacher on the preacher and the other one the treasure one excuse me one was the preacher and the other one was the treasure see there's always just deceiving the lie that came see now y'all preachers and and and trustees don't get nervous you know who you are that satan told eve see was 90 truth 90 truth and the lie that you can tell he says how i've heard men bypass pieces in the scripture just to keep from see it'll hurt their theology see but if this part's right that part is right too let's put it together and make it fit through the whole bible see what i'm trying to say is that even in this message and this is the truth maybe i'm misunderstanding something but we cut pieces out of it to fit our theology you know people have gotten so lazy they don't want to pray people through the holy ghost now if you go to to the message brother branham speaks about praying with the people oh we're beyond that we got the holy ghost without sensation so that's okay if you got it without sensation where is the life of christ i want to see that don't give me part of the word and not give me the whole thing amen hallelujah i believe that when i see jesus working through you right and we know what the pentecostals did they did make it a a a sensation but folks we've got to go beyond that hallelujah into that holy places where god must come but people have gotten so much now i remember when i first came to the message folks people were shouting and dancing and speaking in tongues and running around and you know and living the life they were living it you know what i mean now you find people it's done got so quiet and still you think it's methodist in the message they ain't doing nothing nobody'll come in here and think you drunk enough wine but that was the original church it's originally supposed to be the same maybe i got it mixed up but what people have done they've cut that part out two two two so they can magnify their intellectual conception of the message and it doesn't paul said you can understand all mysteries and have not charity and you know they don't have charity because they fight among each other yet we follow that and we got a message because we hate to be different but brother brannon was different he didn't go with the flow and if it wasn't the word he didn't stand with it i'm not against anybody but i'm i'm i will give an account before god for you and what i preached to you amen and i can remember when brother brandon went behind the curtain of time i mean when he saw his wife up there right remember she said brother bill the very message you preach is the message of the holy ghost and he said what she said whatever you do don't stop preaching the holy ghost huh listen we know the prophet kept warning us he said those people out there in hollywood made this thing a social gospel and look what we got now that thing has so infiltrated the denominational churches now all they are is a social gospel you come to church we're gonna we're gonna entertain you we're gonna play you this music we're gonna have you feeling good and i know a church now amen there go and have bible study with a big cup of wine or cup of beer don't look crazy people in the message drink yeah they do they get they whine and they drink they whine oh don't tell that brother brooks yeah i'm telling it because the truth is the truth where's the holy ghost in that i had a brother called me to uh yesterday he called me yesterday oh brother from down south don't even believe in the message no more and i don't know why he told me this but he did he said you know what he said before my wife died she used to get on me all the time she said because they he said i would drink me a glass of wine every night again i preach i i just got quiet he said she said he he told she told me he said i know the bible said if you keep doing that it's going to make mockery and i'm thinking right now it's making mockery right now but you know people do it and they don't see i can't do that because i was raised up around alcoholics you know and i was delivered from alcohol so i can't do all of that but i know what it is and i know the pool and i know how to be delivered but you get people and they just they don't understand the devil is smarter than what you think because you never know the day that things say i got you now that's what happened to me i didn't know the day but until i got saved i found out he had me came from a line of alcoholic drug addicts and everything else you name it i'm not a i i i i tell the truth like the prophet of god say i'm ashamed of it but i tell you the truth you love the lord let's move on y'all love the lord i don't know what time it is but if you need to go that's okay see one was the preacher the other one was the church dc and they're all just deceiving the lie that came that satan told eve was 99 90 truth all right right but listen we must stand for the whole bible even if you put it back in the ark in the destruction of the world there was the crow and the dove sitting on the same roost one was just as much a a bird as the other one was is that right but what was it one was a crow nature and the other one was a dub by nature one could fly just like the other one won and that's why people are having so many troubles in their lives because their nature haven't been changed brother said a lot of times people confuse that new new spirit with the holy ghost he said that new spirit is given to you just you can cope with the word but that ain't the holy ghost the whole it is a portion of the holy ghost but the holy ghost come to change you your nature like the word of god says you know i'm a new creature in christ all things are passed away behold all come new right in the new world you won't see one thing that will remind you of this one everything in the new world will be totally different brother brown said that is the kind of baptism of the holy ghost and fire that you and i as a believer supposed to have hey and if we're not there yet it's time to wake up amen all of us amen need more god but we need to press toward the mark of a high calling paul said the life that i now live showing that there was a time that he once lived a life that was acceptable according to the law but it wasn't acceptable to god matter of fact he said i was blameless but now paul said i die daily huh and if you're going to live you've got to die daily you got to examine yourself every day you got to die somebody says well how do you die where you know what your will is you refuse to do it that's how you die amen because most of your will is just built upon habits anyway they said take about seven days to break a habit i don't know but listen if you want to resist the devil that's how you do it you say it ain't possible let me tell you it is i had a man get in my face he wanted to fight me and i'm almost done he had a man who wanted to fight me taller than i was six five or so all in my faith and you know what he even winning and um said he was going to get his gun well i had some well-respected people with me at that time so i took them home and i came back and knocked on his door and he came to the door and i had to look up to see his face you know what i told him i said i want you to know i'm not afraid of you he said i know that you're not now come on somebody there was nobody around now but i was not afraid of him i knew who i know who i am so i said i want you to know i'm not afraid of you he said i know that you're not i said listen let me tell you something i said before the lord changed me he changed me i said because there was a time you wouldn't have gotten away with what you just did come on somebody it don't make no giants fall they fall just like short folks and i have been taught when somebody's taller than you go for the knees just not trying to tell you how to do things but but my point is you don't you know it doesn't matter and i learned because i came up pretty much in the if you say in the hood the more people they say oh he ain't doing nothing people do all that talking they scared anyway if you gonna fight you don't waste words you just go for it but nevertheless i i told him that and from that day i pretty much got respected you know but my point is i witnessed to him and i told him i said listen the lord jesus changed me and just like he changed me he can change you and then i walked off the porch if you're gonna have a confrontation don't leave jesus out don't let don't walk away and let the devil get the victory right you somehow even if you acted ugly for the moment repent and make it right because you don't want listen you don't know when you're going to die or when that person is gonna die see satan whenever he calls his things as the prophet god said is somehow he's benefiting from it so you don't want him to benefit from nothing you shut him down hallelujah the prophet god said the church is perfected through justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost there you go you're not even perfect until then amen he said then you're sealed until the day of your redemption and he's that once purged by the blood of jesus christ has no more desire of sin you pass from death unto life paul said i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me see the the you know we can't allow the mess of the word just to be poetic it's gotta live and i'm done for tonight but listen how do you know you know what the dove is clean peaceful just study the dove you know the oil inside cleans it cleanses it and but this this uh crow can hang on the same roost and he could eat all that stuff of the world and say hallelujah praise the lord glory to god because remember the crow was on the boat the crow was in the boat jacob and esau was of the same family and did you know that judas and jesus came from the same tribe of judah all in the family and i'm telling you this is just the beginning folks what i'm trying to say is we've got a lot of pressing into we've got a lot of surrendering to do i'm not just preaching on you i'm talking about myself i have a i have a goal and i told the lord this morning and i told him but i mean just talking with him i'm gonna make it no matter what the cost you've got to lose everything i'm going to make it i've got to go by myself i'm going to make it i love people i hate to be rejected but i'm going to make it you understand me my lord was rejected and so if he could take it i can too amen i tell you like this people you can't go with the flow the majority of the people because this message church is doing this and them listen this is time to focus on you not on everything else on you making sure you got the good you know we don't ever want to come up and say lord have not we done these things in your name no that's not us we are the one we are the ones where he says enter into the joys of my love of the lord well done my good and faithful servant i came here to see a revival among the bride i've seen something happen in lime ohio don't tell me it can't happen i've seen the dead rays i've seen numerous people being healed i know it by this word by this word and young people believe in it but it was hard it was hard trying to get people into the spirit of god for them to see and i can't give you that revelation only god can give it to you but you need to pray and ask god said lord what is brother brooks trying to tell us what is is he telling us the truth and if he is show us what he's saying so we may enter into this thing because i tell you what if we could all uh really get on one accord we'll see god move in a mighty way but we can't compare ourselves to some others churches hello i'm telling you when even in the pentecostal realm when we would go to those churches that was like half the size of this room here a little shack you know the flow you know when you shout on it the whole thing rocked with you but we had a glorious time yeah so i can see it now i can feel it now oh i never shouted so much in my life but that's all we had but it was good then god brought us to this place and and supposed to be jumping by now i've seen it and i know it can be and i'm trusting that it will i promise the lord if nobody else in the church is going to do it i will if i become a spectacle don't don't don't look at me like i'm stupid because i'm going to entertain my lord and i'm going to give him what he deserves you love the lord let's stand oh my there be shouting [Music] [Music] every over there [Music] you my soul [Music] enjoy [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we're gonna enjoy [Music] [Music] over there and then to my soul [Music] [Applause] amen amen [Music] amen amen glory to god and as i pray for him i want those brothers who know how to pray also says i don't care i want you i'ma anoint myself here i want you guys to pray for me i believe what i'm preaching [Music] brother branham talk about a short quick message i believe there's a time there's something coming and everybody think they know all about it but they don't everybody don't know they talk about that secret catching away everybody won't know about that even those around us who think they know because it's a secret it's going to be given to individuals and i trust that by god's grace that he would count me worthy father god as we come before you lord and we pray oh god for my brother keith lord that you would purge and clean hallelujah him lord tonight oh god make him fit lord make him a vessel of honor lord god that you were just oh god continue to give him what he standing lord and even as your virgin [Music] likewise until there is no darkness that your holy spirit would have prayed hallelujah in me in such a way i'll be a walk in jesus bless us now blessed in jesus christ amen [Music] you're making too much out of it no i'm not i'm not making enough of it i listen i listen to that message brother and who says why am i a holy roller [Music] may god be merciful father we pray right now for my precious brother isaac lord that you be merciful to us we pray father that your holy spirit would purge and cleanse him lord from all iniquity any every unbelief lord that he'll come to that perfect stature of christ lord god and that you will seal him in such a way father that people will know that there has been a major change [Music] in jesus christ [Music] so you'll understand what i'm saying when it comes to the ephesian church they had all the gifts they heard the character of christ they were the seed but they were not those who would be translated at the time because the the alpha the maker had not come this is the uh the the same seed as i preached the other night more of it and so what we must see is what they saw in the days of ephesus or even if you want to say in the days of william branno you know we must see more and people say it won't be an open show we know that it's not been one but then even among ourselves we should have testimonies right of what god is doing and what god can do and what what what he's doing for us like i said by god's grace he allowed me to be able to see the dead raised twice and and i thank god for that i didn't deserve it you know i don't deserve it i still don't but it ain't me it's him and when you see those things and you know what god can do you know what god can do this is not a uh some mystic thing this is reality and we see that and that's what we're trying to bring to people here in this church but you know when you see people hardly ever coming to church then when they come to church on sundays they come all late there's a revelation something's lacking their understanding we're talking about coming to meet god people don't understand they it's just too much carnality he said brother you shouldn't look at it yes it's the truth but you know what jesus always keeps his appointments he's never late he's always on time right most of the time he's waiting on us i just want to see people love the lord like he deserved to be loved that's all may god have mercy on all of us and may he continue to bless us and strengthen us because we need him [Music] we need it i need [Music] i wanted somebody to pray for me as well i know can you guys brothers come
