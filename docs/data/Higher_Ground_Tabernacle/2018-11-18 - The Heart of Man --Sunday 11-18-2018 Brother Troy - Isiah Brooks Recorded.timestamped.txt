[29:39] amen amen let's just open it our Bibles
[29:43] to Matthew chapter 13 read the Matthew
[29:53] 13 and we'll read the 15th through the
[29:57] 19th verse
[30:09] speak a message this morning called the
[30:13] heart of man amen and verse verse 15 it
[30:20] says for this people's heart is waxed
[30:24] gross their ears are dull of hearing
[30:28] their eyes they have closed lest at any
[30:33] time they should see with their eyes and
[30:35] hear with their ears and should
[30:38] understand with their heart and should
[30:41] be converted and I should heal them
[30:45] but blessed are your eyes for they see
[30:48] and your ears for they hear for verily I
[30:53] say unto you that many prophets and
[30:56] righteous men have desired to see those
[30:59] things which ye see and hear that have
[31:02] not seen them and hear those things
[31:05] which he hear and have not heard them
[31:07] hear ye therefore the parable of the
[31:09] sower when any one heareth the word of
[31:13] the kingdom and understandeth it not
[31:15] then cometh the wicked one and catcheth
[31:18] away that which was sown in his heart
[31:23] this is he which received the seed by
[31:27] the wayside hey man let's just our
[31:30] hasn't reward prayer one more time
[31:31] Heavenly Father we just asked Lord that
[31:35] right now in the name of the Lord Jesus
[31:37] Christ Lord in your precious name father
[31:40] that this word that Lord that you spoke
[31:43] Lord 2,000 years ago father as we read
[31:47] it again father that we will be
[31:49] transported back in time father and
[31:52] receive it the same Lord to receive it
[31:55] by your Holy Spirit father that this
[31:57] word would not just fall upon deaf ears
[32:00] this morning Lord but Lord that your
[32:02] word would go down into the heart of man
[32:05] Lord and Lord it would not be a hardened
[32:07] heart father but I'd be a heart that is
[32:10] alive to receive your word and I'm
[32:12] asking that Lord on behalf of this
[32:15] people that their hearts will be
[32:17] softened Lord by your word that
[32:19] my hear see and understand and be
[32:22] converted Lord to be to be exactly what
[32:25] you desired them to be on this world
[32:27] Laura for the very purpose that you died
[32:30] on the cross the we would fulfill that
[32:32] purpose in our heart and the name of
[32:34] Jesus Christ we pray amen amen god bless
[32:38] you you could be seated amen you know
[32:43] when I was when you grow up as a as a
[32:46] young man is a Christian you begin going
[32:50] to church you know and and you know you
[32:55] always hear that Jesus wants to come
[32:57] into your heart you know and it's one of
[32:59] the popular things in sunday schools and
[33:04] in different places and every church you
[33:06] know is is that you know have you asked
[33:10] Jesus into your heart you know I think
[33:13] just about everybody here could say that
[33:14] they've heard that phrase you know have
[33:17] you asked Jesus into your heart you know
[33:20] and when I was a child you know that was
[33:22] such a simple thing you know and you
[33:24] know even my wife has told me you know
[33:25] that when she was a child that she would
[33:28] actually imagine you know that that you
[33:30] know being able that there was a little
[33:32] Jesus walking around inside of her heart
[33:34] you know and and because of that she
[33:37] just believed that what she was told
[33:39] that Jesus would come into your heart
[33:41] amen you know and then and you know when
[33:44] you think about the simplicity of the
[33:46] gospel that's what we're looking for is
[33:51] that the almighty Lord Jesus Christ
[33:53] would come into our heart you know and
[33:57] we heard that in Sunday school it was
[33:58] such a such a simple saying but yet is
[34:01] so powerful and so true we want Jesus to
[34:04] come into our heart don't we say it's
[34:05] amen amen and you know and you when you
[34:09] come into this message and you see the
[34:11] mysteries begin to open up unto you and
[34:13] you go down to the deepness of the
[34:15] gospel and you and this Bible becomes in
[34:17] a whole new book to you and and you go
[34:19] through all of the mysteries of the
[34:21] seals and and the wonderful things are
[34:23] brought out to us and you come
[34:25] full-circle right back around to Jesus
[34:29] Christ coming back into your heart and
[34:31] it's like now
[34:33] now I understand now I see now my eyes
[34:40] have been opened Jesus Christ is in my
[34:43] heart
[34:43] amen and you know and after going
[34:46] through the deepness of the gospel and
[34:47] all the mysteries I come right back
[34:49] around to that thing that I heard in
[34:51] under school in Sunday school but now I
[34:53] understand now I see now my eyes have
[34:56] been open the understanding of my heart
[34:57] has been open now Jesus Christ is in my
[35:00] heart you know and Jesus when Jesus came
[35:03] to to this world and he began to draw
[35:07] him in unto himself the first thing that
[35:10] he had to do was to begin working on
[35:13] their hearts why because their hearts
[35:19] had been darkened their hearts had been
[35:22] hardened and the very first thing that
[35:25] Jesus had to do is he had to begin
[35:27] working on their hearts amen so what'd
[35:30] he do he went around and he began to
[35:32] show who he was by the mighty power that
[35:36] he had and you know there'll be miracles
[35:38] there would be signs and well he didn't
[35:41] have to show off about it amen he just
[35:43] had to walk and change things and be and
[35:46] do things according to his kingdom amen
[35:49] if he saw somebody who is sick he would
[35:51] look and he'd say you know in my kingdom
[35:53] that man shouldn't be sick like that
[35:56] Amen so what'd he do he just simply
[35:59] changed the man's position to be like
[36:02] what he was supposed to be that man is
[36:04] supposed to be healed and when his
[36:07] disciples began to see those things also
[36:10] it drew their attention what their eyes
[36:12] were open to see something and in that
[36:15] moment at a time as their eyes were
[36:17] opened and they began to consider who is
[36:21] this and as he spoke those words they
[36:26] would enter into his ears and they would
[36:27] fall upon their heart and their heart
[36:29] was being softened to receive the word
[36:33] their heart was being changed now not
[36:36] everybody had received that experience
[36:38] many understood many of you many heard
[36:42] the exact same words they saw the exact
[36:45] same miracles
[36:46] and those words of the Lord Jesus would
[36:49] actually go down into their ears and
[36:51] actually hit their heart but their heart
[36:55] had been so hardened that no matter what
[36:58] the creator did for them they would not
[37:02] receive it amen now as we were reading
[37:08] there in Matthew chapter 13 verse 10 it
[37:17] says now the disciples came and said
[37:20] unto Him why speakest thou unto them in
[37:23] parables Jesus answer he say answer and
[37:27] said to them because it is given unto
[37:29] you that to know the mysteries of the
[37:31] kingdom of heaven but to them it is not
[37:33] given for whosoever hath Tim shall be
[37:37] given and he shall have more abundance
[37:40] but whosoever hath not from hid from him
[37:42] shall be taken away even that he hath
[37:45] therefore speak I to them in parables
[37:48] because they seeing see not and they
[37:52] hearing hear not neither do they
[37:54] understand Amen now when when Jesus
[37:58] called some of the disciples he said you
[38:01] know you know I saw you off when you
[38:04] were praying under the tree I saw you
[38:08] now how did you see me how did you know
[38:11] I was praying he's like well my eyes I
[38:13] saw you while you were praying now you
[38:15] weren't standing in there or an awesome
[38:19] the understanding he began to understand
[38:22] that that which was being done could not
[38:25] be done by mortal man his understanding
[38:31] began to be opened now when his
[38:33] understanding began to be open what I do
[38:35] it created a soft spot in his heart to
[38:39] where the Word of God could start coming
[38:42] down inside of his heart and changing
[38:45] him transforming him from the person
[38:47] that he was into a new creation and to a
[38:52] new creature because that's what Christ
[38:53] came to do you know Christ he didn't
[38:56] come for us to have hardened hearts they
[38:59] men BS some people the more he preached
[39:02] the harder their hearts got you know
[39:05] then that's then this way it is with all
[39:07] the gospel every time the gospel is
[39:09] preached some people's hearts gets
[39:10] softer some people's hearts gets harder
[39:14] amen so seeing that they might see and
[39:18] understand but some will never never
[39:21] understand some don't want to understand
[39:24] and even though they might think you
[39:28] know I saw something that could not be
[39:31] done by mortal man and no reason in
[39:34] their minds man cannot do that but yet
[39:37] it comes into a conflict in their own
[39:39] mind that if I go down that path and
[39:43] believe that thing then I would have to
[39:47] submit to it and give myself up to it
[39:50] and so they shut it right down right
[39:52] there and the heart becomes hard and
[39:55] because they do not do not want to give
[39:58] up to that thing amen so how can Christ
[40:01] ever get to him no their hearts been
[40:04] hardened they can't do it
[40:06] so what Jesus said when he was given
[40:10] this parable out when he get down to
[40:14] verse 18 there he says here he therefore
[40:17] the parable of the sower when any one
[40:19] heareth the word of the kingdom and
[40:22] understandeth it not then cometh the
[40:25] wicked one and catcheth away that which
[40:29] was sown in his heart this is he which
[40:32] received the seed by the wayside
[40:35] I think about her so the man though the
[40:37] word went into his ears went down to his
[40:41] heart but he didn't understand it and
[40:46] what so Satan is right there and he
[40:48] couldn't he's right there now what he
[40:50] has an entrance into that man and what
[40:51] does he do he catches away the word you
[40:54] know I've seen people like that and I've
[40:56] seen people like that I've seen people
[40:58] listen to the word memorize the word
[41:01] think about it talk about it able to
[41:04] discuss it Amen even able to go down and
[41:07] go through the pages and have the word
[41:10] and all this and there
[41:11] they're able to bring an eloquent
[41:13] response to the word and they're able to
[41:15] sympathize with the word but because
[41:17] they don't actually fully accept the
[41:19] word that they all suddenly begin to
[41:21] fall away and when you look at that man
[41:24] years down the road and you go up and
[41:27] you talk to him now you cannot find any
[41:29] speck of that word that they used to
[41:32] know that the understanding that they
[41:35] seem to have back then now that
[41:37] understanding is is completely gone I
[41:40] know if you've ever if you ever
[41:42] experience that one time it'll amaze you
[41:44] because you like now wait a second I
[41:46] talked to you years ago we fell a shift
[41:49] over the word we talked we discussed the
[41:52] word we fellowship with it we're having
[41:54] communion with the word and now I can't
[41:57] even find that word that you used to
[42:00] have why because the Bible says that
[42:03] when you do not understand that which
[42:05] you seamless to have that which it looks
[42:08] like you have even that which you do
[42:10] have will be taken away why because they
[42:15] didn't let it grow in their hearts amen
[42:18] so not only do you have to have the word
[42:20] come down into your ears not only does
[42:23] it have to get on the field of your
[42:24] heart your fart your heart your heart
[42:26] has to be in a certain condition so that
[42:31] the word can grow and if your heart is
[42:33] not in that condition then you are going
[42:38] to lose that which you've been hurt now
[42:42] think about it we enjoy we enjoy how the
[42:46] spirit shows up in these services we've
[42:48] all had our ears tickled by wonderful
[42:51] messages amen and things that come down
[42:53] from the glory of heaven you know and
[42:56] how Elkin a man can go through the pages
[42:58] of the gospel and bring out a message
[43:00] and we are just in awe listen to it what
[43:02] is it doing that
[43:03] that word is coming down into our minds
[43:06] and it's and it's an amazing thing to
[43:08] see and it's filtering down and down to
[43:10] our heart and it hits that field of our
[43:11] heart and we can rejoice over it we can
[43:14] enjoy it we can they be glad over we can
[43:16] accept it but if our heart is in the
[43:19] wrong condition we can lose every single
[43:22] speck of that which we are so happy
[43:25] receive because of the condition that
[43:28] our heart is in they say oh no I'm gonna
[43:31] I'm gonna hold on to that I'm gonna hold
[43:33] on to this so closely yeah this is mine
[43:35] I'm gonna let me tell you I don't care
[43:37] how much you try to hold on to it if
[43:39] your heart is not in the right condition
[43:42] you will lose everything that you think
[43:45] you have why because it has to do with
[43:49] the condition that your heart is in amen
[43:55] think about Jesus you know how how did
[43:58] he love his disciples you know and he
[44:01] and he said you know when he had the
[44:04] celebrated the last Passover
[44:06] and he was taking the community breathe
[44:08] in deep he said you know with desire I
[44:11] have desire to eat this with you on the
[44:14] earth with desire I have I have longed
[44:17] with a heartfelt desire I have longed to
[44:20] fellowship with you over the blood of
[44:23] the lamb over the over the Passover lamb
[44:25] I was that lamb back in Moses day I am
[44:29] that same lamb today and now here on my
[44:32] on the Passover I am here to to have
[44:35] this right on the eve of my crucifixion
[44:38] I am here to celebrate the Passover with
[44:40] you I am going to shed my blood for your
[44:43] sins I am going to wash you white like
[44:45] snow I am going to fill you with the
[44:47] Holy Ghost I'm going to change you from
[44:49] the creatures of man to be in a son or a
[44:52] daughter of God with desire I've had
[44:53] this desire to have fellowship with you
[44:56] and yet when when as they are having
[44:59] that meal Satan enters into Judas's
[45:03] heart the Bible says and Satan enters
[45:08] into Judas's heart and his heart is
[45:11] sealed away from the Lord Jesus Christ
[45:14] now God came Jesus came to to operate on
[45:19] Judas's heart amen the whole time the
[45:21] Judas was working with them I was
[45:24] working as a disciple of Christ those
[45:26] words Jesus came to operate in that
[45:28] heart but that heart was hardened it
[45:29] could not receive the word amen
[45:32] so what so now when Satan there was no
[45:35] there was a position where Satan could
[45:37] enter into that heart
[45:39] and what what happened as soon as Satan
[45:41] entered into the heart of Judas he was
[45:45] sealed away they meant sohere Christ
[45:49] with desire a desire to fellowship with
[45:52] me but Judas would not couldn't do it
[45:54] amen and so is there with anybody
[45:56] they'll come to church day in day out
[45:58] their ears can be tickled with the
[46:00] wonderful messages amen they'll rejoice
[46:02] but that which they seem us to have no
[46:06] matter how much they can no matter how
[46:08] much they can quote the word with you
[46:10] they can fellowship or the word they can
[46:11] bring some great thoughts but if they
[46:14] they can lose every single bit of that
[46:16] word if they do not receive Christ in
[46:18] their heart amen their heart because the
[46:22] heart has to be in a certain condition
[46:25] for that word to grow if your heart does
[46:29] not get into that condition I don't care
[46:31] how much you hear it I don't care how
[46:32] much you sympathize it I don't care how
[46:34] much you believe it if your heart does
[46:36] not get into that condition to receive
[46:39] the word then you can lose every single
[46:43] bit of it you think oh no no no no I'm
[46:45] gonna hold on to this III you in your
[46:49] own power you can't do it you cannot
[46:51] hold on to it that what you seemeth to
[46:54] have will be taken away from you
[46:56] amen
[47:07] verse 22 it says he also that received
[47:11] seed among the thorns is he that heareth
[47:15] the word and the carrot now where are
[47:18] these thorns at there in the heart
[47:23] there's thrown thorns and this is all
[47:25] relating to the heart of man there's
[47:27] thorns growing in this man's heart
[47:33] he's also that received seed among the
[47:36] thorns is he that heareth the word and
[47:39] the care of this world and the
[47:42] deceitfulness of riches choke the word
[47:45] he becometh unfruitful but he the
[47:48] received seed into the good ground now
[47:51] where is this good ground at that's the
[47:53] heart of man amen
[47:54] neither receiveth seed into the good
[47:57] ground is he that heareth the word and
[47:59] understandeth it which also beareth
[48:02] fruit and bringeth forth some one
[48:04] hundredfold some sixty and some thirty
[48:06] now think about as Jesus Christ was
[48:08] choosing his disciples amen he was the
[48:12] whole time that he was working with them
[48:14] he was trying to change their heart so
[48:17] that they could completely receive his
[48:20] word now you think all the the moment
[48:24] that they the very moment that they
[48:26] rejects sold all that they had and
[48:29] receive Christ's are following them
[48:30] their heart was prepared no it wasn't
[48:33] ready yet Jesus was working on their
[48:36] hearts that entire three and a half year
[48:38] times this was a process their heart
[48:41] they were not ready to receive the full
[48:45] word on day one or on year one not even
[48:49] on year two or on year three they were
[48:51] still not in a condition to where they
[48:54] could receive the full word of God amen
[48:58] well now remember what what was Jesus
[49:00] trying to do he was trying to redeem
[49:02] them and trying to enter into their
[49:05] heart that Jesus Christ might fill them
[49:07] with the Holy Ghost amen amen now
[49:13] it's uh now inverse fit now what look at
[49:17] that verse 15 he said there he said for
[49:20] this people's heart is waxed gross it's
[49:23] become thick it's it's become so a point
[49:26] where it can't receive the word their
[49:28] ears are dull fearing their eyes they
[49:30] have closed us any time they should see
[49:32] with their eyes and hear theirs and they
[49:34] should understand with heart and should
[49:36] be converted and I should heal them
[49:38] that's the last part Jesus was there to
[49:42] heal them amen by an order for them to
[49:44] be healed to become the people that they
[49:46] ought to be their heart had to be
[49:48] changed amen you know it takes a total
[49:51] surrender for your heart to be changed
[49:53] like that amen
[49:57] you know in Matthew 5 when he first
[50:01] started preaching to his disciples we
[50:02] you know he had the Sermon on the Mount
[50:04] and he says blessed are the pure in
[50:06] heart for they shall see God
[50:08] you know they shall see God if you're a
[50:11] car's not pure you won't see him Amen
[50:16] let's turn it over to mark chapter 8
[50:29] yeah I remember as a child you know we
[50:32] we door-to-door witness Enon and I
[50:37] remember that I didn't have a testimony
[50:41] at that time you know I I'd prayed the
[50:44] sinner's prayer but uh you know but when
[50:48] we went door-to-door and I tried to you
[50:51] know they told they taught us the day
[50:53] before what we should say when we
[50:55] knocked on their door and and all that
[50:57] and and be you knowing the door and the
[51:00] door was answer and the person opened
[51:02] the door all I could say was that which
[51:05] I had in my memory I couldn't express to
[51:09] the person salvation you know and I
[51:12] always bothered me because I wanted to
[51:14] be a witness I knew you ought to be a
[51:15] witness but yet when the person answered
[51:18] the door I didn't have anything to say
[51:22] you know and and the same thing why
[51:25] because they hadn't entered into my
[51:26] heart yet Jesus was calling me he was
[51:29] drawing me he is pulling me but yeah I
[51:31] hadn't received Christ inside my heart
[51:33] yet
[51:35] amen mark chapter 8 verse 15 it says and
[51:41] he charged him beware take heed beware
[51:46] of the leaven of the Pharisees and of
[51:48] the leaven of Herod and they reasoned
[51:50] among themselves saying it is because we
[51:53] have no bread and when Jesus knew it he
[51:56] said unto them why reason ye because he
[51:59] have no bread / CV not neither
[52:02] understand have ye your heart yet
[52:04] hardened having eyes see you know having
[52:08] ears hear you not and do you not
[52:09] remember when I break the five loaves
[52:12] among five thousand how many baskets
[52:14] full of fragments took he up and they
[52:17] said an to him twelve and when the seven
[52:20] thousand when the seven among the four
[52:23] thousand how many baskets full fragments
[52:26] took he up and I said seven and he said
[52:29] to him how is it the Iduna understand so
[52:33] here he is he's been out walking with
[52:35] them how many years now he's been
[52:37] preaching the word to him he's been
[52:39] preaching the gospel to him they've
[52:41] they're walking with or with Jesus
[52:44] Christ the word itself the same one that
[52:47] created the heavens and the earth and
[52:49] they're not even understanding that he
[52:52] is the one that no how did how did this
[52:54] bread feed 5,000 tell me tell me how did
[52:58] this fish feed 5,000 how did this loaf
[53:01] of bread feed 5,000 how is it that you
[53:03] do not understand why is your heart
[53:06] still hardened you know they just
[53:09] thought those miracles were kind of neat
[53:11] and I think that's where a lot of people
[53:14] are they think this message is kind of
[53:16] neat they think this is kind of cool you
[53:18] know they think this is something that
[53:20] your place is kind of a nice thing to be
[53:23] able to I'm smarter than all the other
[53:25] Christians out there I I know something
[53:27] a little bit better that they don't know
[53:28] or or maybe I'm a little bit better of a
[53:31] doctrine than the church next door and I
[53:33] just think this is kind of neat that's
[53:36] the condition that they are in but
[53:39] Christ here he's walking with his
[53:41] disciples and he's still trying to get
[53:43] them to understand that the creator of
[53:46] the heavens and earth has come down to
[53:48] earth and he is drawing men unto himself
[53:51] trying to get them to become sons and
[53:54] daughters of God and they cannot I
[53:56] understand that he is the very one that
[53:58] created the heavens and the earth and
[53:59] said they're just wow that's like kind
[54:01] of like a little magician's trick isn't
[54:03] it you know and and you know we and we
[54:06] take no you say oh no I I don't do that
[54:09] but don't you realize that when you come
[54:11] to this message and you don't submit
[54:13] your heart 100% under the Lord Jesus
[54:16] Christ you are doing the same thing
[54:19] every single person that comes to this
[54:21] message that comes to the Lord Jesus
[54:23] Christ and does not get down on their
[54:26] knees and say Oh Lord God have mercy
[54:28] upon me I am a center lor forgive me
[54:31] Lord I got to be changed any person that
[54:34] it does not give up their lives for
[54:37] Christ is the same in the same boat do
[54:42] you not understand how is it that your
[54:45] heart is still hardened why are you
[54:47] allowing the cares of this world the
[54:50] riches of this world to harden your
[54:52] heart why are you choking the words with
[54:54] the throne
[54:55] they're girly with the thorns are
[54:57] growing up in your heart why have you
[54:58] not prepared your heart to receive the
[55:01] gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ because
[55:02] we're in the same boat they were amen
[55:05] Christ is still here amen the Creator is
[55:08] still here
[55:09] amen he's still doing things trying to
[55:11] get us a see and understand that he's
[55:13] the same yesterday today and forever
[55:15] amen that he's still alive that he still
[55:17] reigns that he's still got a man he
[55:20] ought to be served that he ought to be
[55:22] loved
[55:23] amen though his is that this message is
[55:25] worth giving our lives unto the Lord
[55:27] Jesus Christ 100% but when you come here
[55:31] and you give up a half-hearted heart or
[55:35] you come halfway to the Lord Jesus
[55:36] Christ you're doing the same things
[55:38] you've harden your heart and that which
[55:40] you seem to have the enemy can come take
[55:45] it away why because that was not sealed
[55:48] down within you amen you say oh no I'm
[55:55] gonna hold on to this
[55:56] but if let me tell you if you come only
[55:59] halfway in Christ you will lose
[56:00] everything you have because that what
[56:03] you seem to have will be taken away from
[56:06] you and so many times you know you look
[56:10] at someone who you think all that person
[56:12] used to be a Christian how did they fall
[56:14] so far you think I would never do that
[56:20] every single person that does not submit
[56:23] themselves 100% of the Lord Jesus Christ
[56:25] will find themselves in the same boat
[56:27] because Jesus has come for the entire
[56:29] heart of man amen and now heart has to
[56:32] be in a certain condition to receive him
[56:34] and if that heart never gets to that
[56:36] condition you will not receive the Lord
[56:39] Jesus Christ in your heart okay man
[56:42] think about it that word and those the
[56:45] one that received the the word by the
[56:47] way sight the one that received the word
[56:49] amongst the thorns you know the one that
[56:52] had the birds come and take the seed
[56:53] away word that seed land it came in
[56:56] their ears and weighed down and landed
[56:58] on the surface of their heart but their
[56:59] heart was in the wrong condition or see
[57:01] the word so it comes down to what is the
[57:05] condition of your heart amen
[57:10] only the pure in heart shall see God
[57:22] how is it that you do not understand
[57:25] that I am he let's turn over to Luke
[57:34] chapter 24
[57:44] this scripture amazes me because now
[57:46] we're now we're three and a half years
[57:48] down the road they have been walking
[57:53] with the Lord Jesus Christ for three and
[57:55] a half years that's a long time three
[57:58] and a half years they slept with him
[58:00] they ate with him they travel with him
[58:02] they walk down the road they everywhere
[58:04] they went they've been walking with
[58:06] three-and-a-half years and their heart
[58:08] was still not in the condition to
[58:11] completely receive him he still has to
[58:15] work on their heart think about it he's
[58:17] still at this point has to work on their
[58:19] heart sometimes we think we're we were
[58:24] so far off the road
[58:25] Luke chapter 24 verse 25 this is the
[58:30] road to Emmaus he said unto them o fools
[58:36] and slow of heart to believe all that
[58:39] the prophets have spoken ought not
[58:41] Christ to have suffered these things and
[58:43] to enter into his glory and beginning at
[58:46] Moses and all the prophets he expounded
[58:49] unto them in all the Scriptures the
[58:50] things concerning himself amen now let's
[58:58] go down to Lois's keep reading and they
[59:02] and they drew nigh unto the village
[59:04] whither they went and he made as though
[59:06] he would have gone further but they
[59:08] constrained him saying abide with us for
[59:10] this toward evening and the day is far
[59:12] spent and he went in to tarry with them
[59:15] and it came to pass as he sat at meet
[59:18] with them he took bread and blessed it
[59:20] and brake and gave to them
[59:22] and their eyes were opened and heated
[59:24] and they knew him and he vanished out of
[59:27] their sight now I think about he's
[59:30] already died he's risen again amen and
[59:34] then any and he still what's he's trying
[59:37] to do he's still going around trying to
[59:39] finish up the work of the last three and
[59:41] a half years trying to get their heart
[59:44] in the condition for Pentecost amen
[59:48] after three and a half years
[59:50] amen he's already done his job on the
[59:52] earth amen he's already redeemed them of
[59:54] their sins
[59:55] he's already been the slain lamb the
[59:58] sacrifice and he has to come back and he
[1:00:00] appears to him over here
[1:00:01] he appears unto them over there he
[1:00:03] disappears here he disappears over there
[1:00:06] because he's going around still he's
[1:00:08] still working on their heart just trying
[1:00:10] to get them in a condition to go to
[1:00:12] Pentecost after three and a half years
[1:00:16] their heart still wasn't ready for
[1:00:18] Pentecost you know we come to these
[1:00:23] church we come to services and we think
[1:00:25] we know so much of the word we can talk
[1:00:27] about the things that Christ has done we
[1:00:28] can talk about the miracles have been
[1:00:30] done in our midst we can talk about the
[1:00:32] testimonies of others have had something
[1:00:35] done or we even we ourselves God come
[1:00:38] down and heal us you can deliver us you
[1:00:40] can set us free we can understand the
[1:00:42] seals and the mysteries and all these
[1:00:43] things but yet God still is trying to
[1:00:46] get our heart in a condition that will
[1:00:48] give ourselves under the Lord Jesus
[1:00:50] Christ so we can go to Pentecost why and
[1:00:55] we think that we have so much and we
[1:00:57] don't have the first thing the first
[1:00:59] basis amen
[1:01:01] think about how much they knew about
[1:01:03] Jesus Christ after three and a half
[1:01:04] years think about how many sermons they
[1:01:06] had heard but yet their understanding
[1:01:09] was darkened and they still didn't
[1:01:11] understand this is the creator they
[1:01:14] could voice it with their mouth but dick
[1:01:16] but they weren't ready for Pentecost
[1:01:18] amen so he comes and he shows up he
[1:01:22] appears unto Him trying to so why he
[1:01:24] disappeared because their eyes were
[1:01:28] understanding were opened and they knew
[1:01:31] that was him my job here is done
[1:01:35] they're ready for Pentecost amen
[1:01:38] they know that I am he amen
[1:01:42] you know there's times that you can you
[1:01:44] can think that you know something I can
[1:01:47] tell you something but all sudden when
[1:01:49] it strikes your heart and your heart is
[1:01:51] ready to receive it this is the Lord
[1:01:53] Jesus Christ
[1:01:55] this is him this war in this world
[1:01:59] begins to melt away and the things of
[1:02:03] this world and all the riches and our
[1:02:05] careers and our and all those things all
[1:02:07] sudden start to become foolishness and
[1:02:10] we begin to realize he is the Christ he
[1:02:16] is the Messiah because no now look why
[1:02:20] are we here because Christ has been
[1:02:22] drawing us amen why why do we even go to
[1:02:27] church why do we give up our Sundays you
[1:02:30] know why don't we just go out there and
[1:02:32] you know go enjoy the sports and do
[1:02:34] other things like that but something
[1:02:36] about us says Christ has drawn us to
[1:02:39] himself amen was he trying to do he's
[1:02:42] trying to get us in a condition that we
[1:02:44] submit to him so that we can become the
[1:02:46] bride of Lord Jesus Christ amen and when
[1:02:49] our eyes of our understanding could be
[1:02:52] open to realize that which has been laid
[1:02:55] before us and that is worth submit
[1:02:59] giving our lives up to it is worth
[1:03:01] submitting ourselves to it is worth
[1:03:03] giving giving 80 years of existence on
[1:03:05] this earth up for then our eyes of our
[1:03:10] understanding be k opened amen and
[1:03:12] that's what Christ is trying to do
[1:03:14] trying to get us to receive him trying
[1:03:17] to open up the soften our heart why so
[1:03:20] that we don't just sit here in church
[1:03:21] week in week out with hardened hearts
[1:03:24] able to debate the word but not able to
[1:03:27] receive the word amen
[1:03:32] and what happened as soon as as soon as
[1:03:34] he disappeared what they say didn't our
[1:03:37] hearts burn within us why what was he
[1:03:43] doing he has heart surgery he is going
[1:03:45] in there is our how their hearts were
[1:03:47] burning why because he was
[1:03:49] there's ruling away the rocks and the
[1:03:51] soil his heart he is creating a place
[1:03:53] what the word could go in there so I can
[1:03:55] start that so it could be like a seed he
[1:03:57] could start start growing and growing
[1:03:59] and growing didn't our hearts burn
[1:04:02] within us as he walked with us along the
[1:04:04] way well he was heart surgery amen he
[1:04:08] was trying doing he's doing little bit
[1:04:09] of heart surgery so they could be ready
[1:04:11] for Pentecost what happened on Pentecost
[1:04:14] that which their heart was the work was
[1:04:16] done ready to be sealed they had
[1:04:19] received the Lord Jesus Christ as their
[1:04:22] Savior they knew who he was
[1:04:25] hey man we can talk about receive him as
[1:04:27] our Savior we can think about it you
[1:04:29] know and you know sometimes you hear
[1:04:33] testimonies of a so so-and-so oh I got
[1:04:37] thank Jesus you know he healed me or he
[1:04:40] delivered me and you hear all these all
[1:04:42] these testimonies and there's just
[1:04:44] something about it they're not a lot to
[1:04:46] get their lives are not submitted unto
[1:04:48] the Lord Jesus Christ here we come to
[1:04:50] Thanksgiving and everybody's and we sit
[1:04:52] around the table thanking God for all
[1:04:54] the blessings that he has given I'm not
[1:04:56] realizing that if they don't get Jesus
[1:04:58] Christ down the inside of their heart
[1:05:00] it'll all be taken away in a moment in a
[1:05:06] twinkling of an eye many will be cast
[1:05:10] out into outer darkness weeping and
[1:05:13] wailing and gnashing of teeth why
[1:05:15] because they never received Christ in
[1:05:18] their heart they could talk about the
[1:05:21] word they could debate the word they can
[1:05:22] think about the word but until Christ
[1:05:25] has given the preeminence in your life
[1:05:29] and you got a long ways to go
[1:05:36] amen let's turn over to Romans chapter
[1:05:39] 10
[1:06:08] Romans 10 verse verse 8
[1:06:21] but what saith it the word is nigh thee
[1:06:23] even in thy mouth and in thy heart that
[1:06:26] is the Word of Faith which we preach
[1:06:28] with which we preach that if thou shalt
[1:06:32] confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus
[1:06:35] and shalt believe in thine heart that
[1:06:37] God has raised him from the dead thou
[1:06:40] shalt be saved
[1:06:42] you know I've heard that verse as I was
[1:06:44] as a child you know really until you
[1:06:48] know what is submitting yourself to the
[1:06:51] Lord Jesus Christ how does one you know
[1:06:55] how does one believe in your heart that
[1:07:00] Jesus has raised from the dead how do
[1:07:02] you do it because as much as you think
[1:07:05] about the gospel your heart when your
[1:07:11] heart your heart will testify against
[1:07:15] the very thing that you're speaking
[1:07:16] remember when Jesus when they when the
[1:07:20] disciples were not washed in their hands
[1:07:22] before they eat and the and the
[1:07:24] Pharisees were saying you know why don't
[1:07:26] you guys wash your hands you know and
[1:07:28] all that and and he says that which you
[1:07:30] goes into your belly doesn't defile the
[1:07:33] man however remember the scripture but
[1:07:37] the things that come out of your heart
[1:07:38] that's what defiles the man and when a
[1:07:42] man is defiled how can he go to heaven
[1:07:44] how can be be sealed with the Holy Ghost
[1:07:47] amen for out of the heart comes Lies
[1:07:50] murders adulteries well how did they get
[1:07:53] in there a man they got in there by the
[1:07:56] fall and you didn't allow the Lord Jesus
[1:07:58] to come deliver you and heal you
[1:08:00] remember he said I'm standing there to
[1:08:02] heal them but because they don't have
[1:08:04] ears to hear they don't have eyes to see
[1:08:06] and they do not understand that I am he
[1:08:09] they do I understand who I am therefore
[1:08:11] I am standing here to heal them but they
[1:08:14] will never be healed even Christ is here
[1:08:16] to heal our hearts amen to deliver them
[1:08:18] but but if you won't if you won't submit
[1:08:21] yourself to them remember this this
[1:08:23] isn't you can't go halfway with this
[1:08:26] amen you know we've we've all or we're
[1:08:28] all in the hot seat now we've all we're
[1:08:31] all standing here now we all have our
[1:08:32] decision to make what we're going to do
[1:08:34] is
[1:08:34] Our Lives we have the promise of an
[1:08:37] everlasting kingdom that the creator of
[1:08:40] the heavens and the earth said I am go
[1:08:42] to prepare a place for you and if I
[1:08:44] prepare a place for you I will come
[1:08:45] again and I'll receive you unto myself
[1:08:47] but what is it tank he says go so it's
[1:08:50] you have give to the poor then you'll
[1:08:53] have treasure in heaven then come and
[1:08:55] follow me oh yeah we won't follow him
[1:08:58] amen Zechariah says behold the half that
[1:09:01] I have I give to the poor and and you
[1:09:04] know if I have robbed anybody I will
[1:09:06] restore back fourfold and Jesus said
[1:09:09] Behold salvation has come to this house
[1:09:11] sustained why because Zacharias heart
[1:09:14] have been turned over to the Lord Jesus
[1:09:16] Christ amen but when you turn your heart
[1:09:21] to the Lord Jesus Christ then you begin
[1:09:22] to love the things that he loves a mint
[1:09:25] you begin to hate the things that he
[1:09:27] hates amen it's not a burden for you to
[1:09:31] follow the scriptures if you find
[1:09:33] something in your heart that is contrary
[1:09:35] to the scriptures you go to your the
[1:09:38] throne room and you ask your Savior to
[1:09:40] heal you of that and he will deliver you
[1:09:42] but if your heart is hardened you go
[1:09:46] year after year after year knowing that
[1:09:50] without what you're doing is contrary to
[1:09:52] the word but not taking care of the
[1:09:55] problem you sir your heart is hardened
[1:09:58] how can you be saved when your heart is
[1:10:04] contrary to the scriptures and you and
[1:10:06] you're walking in that living in that
[1:10:08] how can you be saved the very word that
[1:10:11] you say you say oh I believe within my
[1:10:14] heart the word Christ that Jesus Christ
[1:10:17] was the son of God how no no this we say
[1:10:21] this verse here in Romans chapter 9 is a
[1:10:23] very very simple verse Romans chapter 10
[1:10:26] let's read that again
[1:10:27] it says Romans chapter 10 verse 9 that
[1:10:30] if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the
[1:10:32] Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine
[1:10:37] heart that God has raised him from the
[1:10:39] dead thou shalt be saved I think we all
[1:10:42] want to be saved don't we amen but if
[1:10:44] you in your heart are rejecting part of
[1:10:48] the
[1:10:48] word how can you out of the same heart
[1:10:50] say I have received the word and you and
[1:10:56] you and we think we can pick and choose
[1:10:58] all I'm going to obey this scripture but
[1:11:00] I'm not going to obey this one I don't
[1:11:02] want to do this I don't want to do that
[1:11:03] and you're saying that you are a
[1:11:08] Christian you say that you are believing
[1:11:12] with all of your heart that Jesus Christ
[1:11:15] is the son of God so that you can be
[1:11:17] saved your own heart is testifying
[1:11:20] against you because from your heart
[1:11:22] you're not obeying the gospel I don't
[1:11:26] care how much you can debate the word
[1:11:28] how much you can talk about it how much
[1:11:30] you can think you might be smarter than
[1:11:32] everybody in this room you might be able
[1:11:34] to put down anybody in this room by the
[1:11:36] your intelligence even Judas was able to
[1:11:40] preach the gospel and heal the sick but
[1:11:43] Satan was able to enter into his heart
[1:11:46] now look he had three and a half years
[1:11:49] to allow Christ into his heart he
[1:11:51] wouldn't do it after three and a half
[1:11:53] years he would not let Christ into his
[1:11:55] heart but then Satan came and Satan just
[1:11:57] enters right in and Satan entered into
[1:12:00] his heart to betray the Lord Jesus amen
[1:12:05] and you look at people you think how
[1:12:07] could they do this how could they do
[1:12:09] that because even though they said
[1:12:11] they'd given their heart to the Lord
[1:12:12] Jesus their own testimony
[1:12:15] the end bears out what was from the
[1:12:18] beginning
[1:12:23] and shalt believe in thine heart that
[1:12:27] God hath raised him from the dead thou
[1:12:29] shalt be saved
[1:12:32] because if you really believe that God
[1:12:34] raised the Lord Jesus Christ from the
[1:12:36] dead it'll change the way you live it'll
[1:12:41] change the way you think it'll create a
[1:12:44] little crevasse and that stony plate of
[1:12:46] your heart where that word can finally
[1:12:49] get in there amen and as your heart
[1:12:51] burns within you he'll begin to removing
[1:12:53] those stones and do the heart surgery
[1:12:55] that needs to happen and you'll come
[1:12:58] down and by yourself before the word of
[1:13:00] God
[1:13:12] and you were James said purify your
[1:13:15] hearts you double-minded amen
[1:13:17] why because they were double minded they
[1:13:20] thought they could do this over here
[1:13:21] while still receiving the gospel over
[1:13:23] here they needed to procure off' i their
[1:13:26] hearts
[1:13:32] hey man i want to go back to you know
[1:13:39] let's go let's go back over to Genesis
[1:13:47] this is chapter 3
[1:14:02] brother Brennan said at one point he
[1:14:05] says now if you are sitting here and
[1:14:06] you're saying you believe but you don't
[1:14:10] really believe you need to you need to
[1:14:11] stop it you know if you if you are
[1:14:14] thinking one thing and saying another
[1:14:17] you're not right you know why because
[1:14:21] that what you're saying doesn't mean
[1:14:23] anything but if your heart wherever your
[1:14:24] heart is that's where the problem lies
[1:14:29] amen
[1:14:30] Genesis chapter 3 verse 4 as the serpent
[1:14:38] said unto the woman ye shall not surely
[1:14:40] die for God doth know that in the day ye
[1:14:44] eat thereof then your eyes shall be
[1:14:46] opened and ye shall be as God's knowing
[1:14:48] good and evil and when the woman saw
[1:14:50] that the tree was good for food and as
[1:14:53] pleasant to the eyes a tree to be
[1:14:56] desired to make one wise she took of the
[1:14:58] fruit thereof and did eat and gave also
[1:15:00] unto her husband with her and he did he
[1:15:02] and eyes of them both were opened and
[1:15:05] they knew that they were naked amen
[1:15:08] Satan found a way to enter in through
[1:15:12] their eyes and through their ears but
[1:15:14] God is saying if you'll hear me if
[1:15:16] you're a I see if you're a if your eyes
[1:15:19] are closed your heart is dull of hearing
[1:15:21] you cannot receive then you will receive
[1:15:25] the if you reject Christ you will
[1:15:29] receive the other amen amen and you know
[1:15:35] it's a danger I'm just saying this to
[1:15:38] illustrate how dangerous it is to come
[1:15:40] to church and to sit on the fence amen
[1:15:44] when you if you do not soften your heart
[1:15:48] Christ cannot get into you amen and
[1:15:51] order to soften your heart you have to
[1:15:55] you have to do it on your knees that's
[1:15:58] the only way around it you know we you
[1:16:00] can go to church day in day out day in
[1:16:02] day out and you know I've gone and I've
[1:16:04] talked to people that used to come to
[1:16:05] this church I talked to him years later
[1:16:08] and and and they've rejected everything
[1:16:11] that they they used to know you know
[1:16:13] they used to know and be able to talk
[1:16:16] about
[1:16:16] these things that we talked about to be
[1:16:18] able to talk about the Scriptures
[1:16:19] they'll talk about the message amen now
[1:16:21] you go talk to them they don't remember
[1:16:23] a single thing about it and it always
[1:16:27] amazes me because they'll go and they'll
[1:16:29] say something in exposes that every
[1:16:32] single thing they heard for the years
[1:16:34] and years and years that they sent here
[1:16:36] and this room has now been taken away
[1:16:39] from them why because it didn't enter
[1:16:42] into their heart their into their memory
[1:16:45] amen
[1:16:46] they might have clung to it with their
[1:16:48] things but when the riches and the cares
[1:16:51] of this life amen they choked the word
[1:16:54] out they never bear fruit of it amen and
[1:16:57] then what the end of that man is worse
[1:16:59] than the beginning hey man that's why we
[1:17:02] have to have a soft heart you know as I
[1:17:06] said we all heard in Sunday school
[1:17:08] if you receive Christ into your heart
[1:17:10] you'll be saved amen the way to be saved
[1:17:12] is to receive Christ into your heart but
[1:17:14] don't you realize that true that caught
[1:17:16] the only way to do that is through a
[1:17:18] full surrender if you do not have a full
[1:17:21] surrender Christ will never come into
[1:17:23] your heart it just won't happen amen
[1:17:26] how can you say that we're living in
[1:17:28] Bible days how can you say believe you
[1:17:30] believe that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:17:32] yesterday today and forever how can you
[1:17:34] say that you believe this message when
[1:17:36] you're more interested in the things of
[1:17:39] the world and you are the things of
[1:17:40] Christ let me tell you your heart is
[1:17:42] hardened if you can come and sit in this
[1:17:44] church and not give up your life for
[1:17:47] Christ your heart has been hardened you
[1:17:50] do not know where you are standing
[1:17:51] Amen you might think beware when you
[1:17:54] think that you stand lest you fall
[1:17:56] because if you do fall how can you ever
[1:17:58] get back up again amen first Corinthians
[1:18:07] 4:5 says therefore
[1:18:11] judged nothing before the time until the
[1:18:14] Lord comes who will both bring to light
[1:18:17] the hidden things of darkness I will
[1:18:19] make manifest the counsels of the hearts
[1:18:22] and then every man shall have praise
[1:18:24] with God because every man in his heart
[1:18:27] is testifying one thing no matter what
[1:18:29] his word says he says well you know I I
[1:18:32] don't mind going to church I don't mind
[1:18:34] being active in the church I don't mind
[1:18:36] I don't mind singing the songs but I
[1:18:39] really don't want to give my life over
[1:18:41] to Christ Christ is coming and he's
[1:18:45] going to show off that very thought that
[1:18:47] you had in your heart hey man I know
[1:18:49] what's going to happen when that thought
[1:18:51] of your heart is exposed
[1:18:52] that's Judgment Day amen what you
[1:18:56] wouldn't let Christ into your heart
[1:18:57] why because you would not give up for
[1:18:59] your entire life for Christ amen we have
[1:19:04] to forsake all if we really want the
[1:19:08] inheritance we have to forsake all amen
[1:19:15] this this this ninety nine and a half
[1:19:19] one do this life calls for forsaking all
[1:19:23] a men
[1:19:33] I mean you only think about Jesus Christ
[1:19:37] three and a half years he walked with
[1:19:39] his disciples he dies he rises again and
[1:19:44] he still has to go up to those disciples
[1:19:47] and says o fools and slow of heart to
[1:19:49] believe all your understanding is still
[1:19:54] darkened you don't yet realize Who I am
[1:19:57] you don't yet realize that the very god
[1:20:01] this preached you day-in day-out is me I
[1:20:05] am that God you didn't realize that when
[1:20:07] you walk through that curtain into the
[1:20:09] service that God was gonna be speaking
[1:20:11] to you you didn't realize that when you
[1:20:12] were talking to your brother or your
[1:20:13] sister that you were talking to the
[1:20:15] redeemed with the Lord Jesus Christ you
[1:20:17] didn't realize you were talking to the
[1:20:19] body of the Lord Jesus Christ you didn't
[1:20:21] when you when you decided in your heart
[1:20:23] that I am NOT going to obey the gospel
[1:20:25] that you're giving away your salvation
[1:20:29] the same way Esau gave away his
[1:20:30] birthright and you think oh how could I
[1:20:34] so I don't think about that remember
[1:20:35] Esau had the birthright amen he was the
[1:20:38] firstborn he gave up his birthright for
[1:20:42] something of this world he gave up his
[1:20:45] inheritance and the Bible says that even
[1:20:48] though he sought after it with tears of
[1:20:50] repentance he could not get that back
[1:20:52] why because he gave up his birthright
[1:20:55] for just a just some food because he was
[1:20:58] hungry a man and people this day will
[1:21:01] give up give up salvation will not say
[1:21:04] well you know I'm just gonna give up now
[1:21:05] there's this one little thing over here
[1:21:07] I just don't want to give that up and
[1:21:09] they'll sit there and they think that
[1:21:11] they can sit on the fence and still
[1:21:13] receive any blessing for Christ let me
[1:21:15] tell you you can't I'll do it your heart
[1:21:17] is not right before God amen amen
[1:21:22] let's let's see let's turn over to Acts
[1:21:23] I want to show you an example of that
[1:21:27] it's a lot of scriptures but Acts
[1:21:32] chapter 8
[1:21:48] verse 12 says but when they believed
[1:21:56] Philip preaching the things concerning
[1:21:58] the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus
[1:22:00] Christ they were baptized both men and
[1:22:03] women then Simon himself believed also
[1:22:07] and when he was baptized he continued
[1:22:10] with Philip and wondered beholding the
[1:22:13] miracles and signs which were done amen
[1:22:16] so right now at this point Simon is a
[1:22:18] believer he is going to church he is
[1:22:21] following if he's following Philip
[1:22:23] everywhere he goes he's watching the
[1:22:26] signs of miracles being done amen and he
[1:22:29] says he enjoys it he loves it he and
[1:22:31] there's a space of time here where he is
[1:22:34] following the gospel amen verse 14 now
[1:22:37] in the disciples which went now in the
[1:22:43] disciples which were at Jerusalem heard
[1:22:45] that Samaria had received the Word of
[1:22:47] God they sent unto them Peter and John
[1:22:49] who when they were come down prayed for
[1:22:52] them that they might receive the Holy
[1:22:54] Ghost oh now we're coming to Pentecost
[1:22:56] for as yet he was fallen upon none of
[1:22:59] them only they were baptized in the name
[1:23:02] of the Lord Jesus then they laid their
[1:23:05] hands on them and they received the Holy
[1:23:07] Ghost Pentecost has arrived on the seat
[1:23:11] amen and what way Pentecost do it was
[1:23:14] the baptism of the Holy Ghost was coming
[1:23:17] upon hearts that had been prepared and
[1:23:19] ready to receive Christ and now son
[1:23:22] Christ was inside their hearts he was
[1:23:25] sealed and they became a part of the
[1:23:27] body of Christ amen now Christ was
[1:23:30] walking on the earth again in this body
[1:23:33] of believers in Samaria and now it's not
[1:23:35] just the sign does wonders that are
[1:23:37] being done by Philip but now there's an
[1:23:39] entire body of believers Jesus Christ
[1:23:42] has returned to the earth again amen
[1:23:45] they've been filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:23:46] they why because their hearts were ready
[1:23:49] and prepared but poor Simon here and
[1:23:54] when Simon saw what he did he saw it
[1:23:59] why'd he see it you
[1:24:01] on the outside looking in now think
[1:24:05] about it
[1:24:05] all of a sudden he was on the outside
[1:24:07] looking in all this time he thought he
[1:24:12] was in with the church but now a sudden
[1:24:16] the Holy Ghost has fallen and now
[1:24:19] suddenly finds himself on the outside
[1:24:22] looking in the Holy Spirit came by came
[1:24:26] sweeping through the town and filled
[1:24:28] those that were ready so he wasn't and
[1:24:34] he finds himself on the outside looking
[1:24:36] in and when Simon saw that through the
[1:24:43] laying on of the Apostles hands the Holy
[1:24:46] Ghost was given he offered them money
[1:24:48] saying give me also this power that on
[1:24:52] whomsoever I lay hands he may receive
[1:24:55] the Holy Ghost now remember this man has
[1:24:57] been baptized he said he was a believer
[1:24:59] he took upon himself the name of Lord
[1:25:01] Jesus Christ but his heart was hard as a
[1:25:03] stone he had all of this in his memory
[1:25:06] but he wouldn't submit himself to the
[1:25:08] Lord Jesus Christ and when the Holy
[1:25:10] Ghost came through the town the Holy
[1:25:13] Ghost couldn't see him and then Peters
[1:25:17] but Peter said unto Him thy money perish
[1:25:19] with thee because thou has thought where
[1:25:22] do you think it in his heart that the
[1:25:25] gift of God may be purchased with money
[1:25:27] thou hast neither part nor a lot in this
[1:25:30] matter for thy heart is not right in the
[1:25:35] sight of God repent therefore of this
[1:25:37] thy wickedness and pray God if perhaps
[1:25:40] the thought of thine heart might be
[1:25:45] forgiven thee before I proceed that thou
[1:25:48] are in the gall of bitterness and in the
[1:25:51] bond of iniquity now wait a second he
[1:25:56] was baptized he been going to church he
[1:26:01] was in the revival but because he was
[1:26:05] holding these things in his heart when
[1:26:07] the Holy Spirit came through the town
[1:26:09] don't you realize that every time a body
[1:26:11] of believers gets together and every
[1:26:13] time a body believers had
[1:26:15] that road to emmaus experience Amen
[1:26:17] where we have the powerful messages
[1:26:19] where the God is coming down your ears
[1:26:22] are being tickled the word is going down
[1:26:24] to your heart you feel your heart
[1:26:25] burning within you don't you realize
[1:26:27] what is he doing he's preparing that
[1:26:29] that body of believers he's preparing
[1:26:32] them for an upcoming print cost because
[1:26:38] every church has to have a refreshing
[1:26:40] now and again every church has to have a
[1:26:44] pentecostal once in a while every church
[1:26:47] has to have another baptism of the Holy
[1:26:49] Ghost another sweep of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:51] another or a Bible why because otherwise
[1:26:54] the church will melt away in Diamont but
[1:26:56] the church has to have another time of a
[1:26:58] refreshing amen so what does God do
[1:27:00] knowing that time of refreshing is
[1:27:02] coming amen he comes and he prepares the
[1:27:05] hearts in advance he gives them warnings
[1:27:07] to get their heart clean to get their
[1:27:10] heart ready submit yourself to the Lord
[1:27:12] Jesus Christ give up this foolishness
[1:27:14] get yourself make yourself clean and get
[1:27:17] ready because the gospel is coming get
[1:27:19] ready because Christ is coming and when
[1:27:21] and when God has done enough when he's
[1:27:23] preach the gospel when he's tickled the
[1:27:25] ears
[1:27:25] well he's prepared the hearts and people
[1:27:28] have repented and they've repented of
[1:27:30] the foolish that they allowed in their
[1:27:31] hearts then all of a sudden the Holy
[1:27:32] Spirit comes sweeping through the church
[1:27:38] for a refilling of the Holy Ghost and
[1:27:43] some will be sealed on the inside but
[1:27:47] others will find themselves on the
[1:27:48] outside looking in now why do they find
[1:27:51] because just like Simon here they
[1:27:54] allowed some wickedness to stay within
[1:27:58] their heart though they were baptized so
[1:28:01] they follow the message so all that but
[1:28:03] because of that which they left in their
[1:28:06] heart that little thing that the holy
[1:28:08] spirit could not penetrate and then I
[1:28:11] remember the Holy Spirit doesn't bring
[1:28:12] the revival every day amen
[1:28:16] not in a church wide experience but if
[1:28:21] you need a revival get your heart ready
[1:28:24] amen if you're not where you ought to be
[1:28:26] in Christ get your heart ready why
[1:28:28] because the Holy Spirit is coming
[1:28:30] amen and he will he will revive those
[1:28:34] that can be revived but if your heart is
[1:28:37] not ready then how can you be revived
[1:28:47] but Peter said unto Him thy money perish
[1:28:50] with thee because thou has thought that
[1:28:54] the gift of God may be purchased as
[1:28:55] money thou has neither part nor lot in
[1:28:58] this manner for thy heart is not right
[1:29:00] in the sight of God repent therefore of
[1:29:03] this thy wickedness and pray God if
[1:29:05] perhaps maybe the thought of thine heart
[1:29:08] may be forgiven thee for I perceive that
[1:29:12] thou are in the gall of bitterness and
[1:29:14] in the bond of iniquity think about the
[1:29:17] time when the when the woman had the
[1:29:19] alabaster box and she realized that
[1:29:22] Jesus was sitting there with unwashed
[1:29:24] feet and so she went and she gave up
[1:29:28] everything she had to go and purchase
[1:29:32] that alabaster box
[1:29:34] she gave up all and she went in and she
[1:29:39] she gave up her pride she gave up her
[1:29:41] money she gave up everything to go in to
[1:29:44] Jesus into Simon's house tu-tu-tu-tu-tu
[1:29:48] with the alabaster box to worship before
[1:29:51] Jesus and she went there and she
[1:29:53] realized he hadn't been anointed with
[1:29:55] oil
[1:29:56] he hadn't been washed with his feet amen
[1:29:58] heal well he wasn't being taken care of
[1:30:00] amen and so what'd she do she goes in
[1:30:03] there and she begins to brew she breaks
[1:30:05] the seal open amen and and when that and
[1:30:08] when when she begins to worship Lord
[1:30:11] Jesus Christ there was all sudden two
[1:30:13] people in that room they were in the
[1:30:15] midst of a worship service
[1:30:18] now everybody was in the midst of the
[1:30:20] worship service but two are on the
[1:30:22] inside and the rest were sealed out why
[1:30:26] were they sealed out because they had
[1:30:29] not prepared beforehand to give up
[1:30:31] everything that they had to worship
[1:30:34] Christ there was only one person in that
[1:30:37] room
[1:30:38] was gonna give up everything to worship
[1:30:41] Christ the way he deserved be worshipped
[1:30:43] and she was the one that's on the inside
[1:30:46] of the worship service amen
[1:30:48] everybody else was sit that they could
[1:30:50] look at it with your eyes but they
[1:30:52] couldn't experience it in their heart
[1:30:55] amen and so is the same thing happen
[1:30:58] every Sunday every Wednesday every every
[1:31:02] morning we have a chance an opportunity
[1:31:04] to worship the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:31:07] Jesus himself said only the pure in
[1:31:09] heart shall see God amen or else where
[1:31:13] will they see they'll see judgment amen
[1:31:16] but the pure at heart will see God amen
[1:31:18] and they will worship Him amen
[1:31:24] we're almost closing here let's just
[1:31:26] turn over to well turn to 2nd
[1:31:33] Corinthians and we'll go to Hebrews 3
[1:31:35] 2nd corinthians 3 3
[1:31:54] second Corinthians 3:3 says for as much
[1:32:00] as your manifestly declared to be the
[1:32:03] Epistle of Christ ministered by US
[1:32:06] written not with ink but with the spirit
[1:32:10] of the Living God not in tables of stone
[1:32:13] but in fleshy tables of heart amen if
[1:32:17] Christ is ever gonna get his word into
[1:32:19] you he's gonna get his word into a
[1:32:22] fleshly heart they meant he's not if
[1:32:25] your heart is a heart of stone he is not
[1:32:26] gonna place his word into you
[1:32:28] amen now the word is that's what's
[1:32:29] coming again to save us but you're if
[1:32:32] you're if the word if your heart is not
[1:32:34] prepared you the word cannot come now
[1:32:36] let's go to Hebrews three so the Holy
[1:32:40] Spirit is here to what to write his word
[1:32:42] in our hearts and if the heart is not
[1:32:45] ready it cannot come to pass
[1:32:51] Hebrews 3 verse 8 verse 7 wherefore as
[1:32:57] the Holy Ghost saith today if you will
[1:33:01] hear his voice harden not your hearts as
[1:33:05] in the provocation and the temptation in
[1:33:08] the day of the wilderness when your
[1:33:11] hearts tempted me and proved me they saw
[1:33:14] my works 40 years wherefore I was
[1:33:17] grieved with that generation and and
[1:33:19] said they do always err in their heart
[1:33:23] and they have not known my ways
[1:33:25] so I swore in my wrath they shall not
[1:33:28] enter into my rest why because they're
[1:33:30] always erring in their heart a mint may
[1:33:33] they say one thing but in their heart
[1:33:35] they believe something else amen
[1:33:38] their own heart is testifying against
[1:33:41] them
[1:33:41] Amen because as Jesus said it's not the
[1:33:44] things that come out they go into a man
[1:33:46] that defile man but it's the things that
[1:33:48] come out of your heart for with your
[1:33:50] heart your soul is speaking amen and
[1:33:54] just as in closing here you know he came
[1:33:57] to heal our hearts but if we won't be
[1:33:59] healed the week this this this walk this
[1:34:03] gospel the
[1:34:04] man's a complete surrender a man if you
[1:34:08] have something that you are holding back
[1:34:10] you're in grave danger of having a
[1:34:16] hardened heart that can never be
[1:34:17] softened again why because when Christ
[1:34:20] came you pulled yourself back and you
[1:34:25] harden your heart and he said I will not
[1:34:27] listen to what the word said the word
[1:34:29] came you wouldn't listen to it
[1:34:32] how can you expect that the Holy Ghost
[1:34:36] will ever come across your path again
[1:34:39] sometimes we think that a little these
[1:34:42] little sins and things are so innocent
[1:34:44] and you don't realize that the devil was
[1:34:46] going about as a roaring lion seeking
[1:34:48] whom he may devour
[1:34:50] amen and he will enter into the hearts
[1:34:54] that are not sealed by the Holy Ghost
[1:34:56] you can be baptized you can rejoice you
[1:34:59] can do all those things oh and you're
[1:35:01] holding things back from and not giving
[1:35:03] Christ the hon 100% and you're holding
[1:35:07] things back in your life and to not
[1:35:09] submit yourself to the gospel to not
[1:35:12] submit yourself to the word that's being
[1:35:13] preached how can you say that you have
[1:35:16] an inheritance in heaven when the very
[1:35:19] word that came to bring you to heaven
[1:35:21] you reject it amen let's just an amen
[1:35:34] let's just bow our heads a word of
[1:35:35] Prayer heavenly father we just pray unto
[1:35:39] you lord or a sobering message father
[1:35:42] lord I even pray for my own self father
[1:35:46] if my heart is hardened in any way Lord
[1:35:49] if anybody here in this room is hard in
[1:35:52] their heart through the deceitfulness of
[1:35:54] iniquity lord I pray you would give a
[1:35:57] space Lord to repent father to forgive
[1:36:01] us Lord Lord sometimes we do things and
[1:36:04] we don't realize how serious the thing
[1:36:07] is that we're doing when we allow sin to
[1:36:09] reign in our hearts father Lord forgive
[1:36:12] us Lord for if we have rejected your
[1:36:15] word Lord or for you brought
[1:36:18] your word unto this tabernacle father
[1:36:19] Lord you you laid out the table for us
[1:36:23] where the saints of God are fed you say
[1:36:26] come and eat where your hearts can be
[1:36:31] fed but Lord if we refuse Oh Lord
[1:36:35] forgive us father for surely lor if
[1:36:38] we've hardened our hearts Lord forgive
[1:36:41] us Lord if we could find space to repent
[1:36:45] Lord forgive us Lord
[1:36:47] fluor we we in so many ways Lord we
[1:36:50] offend in so many ways it's so easy in
[1:36:52] this Laodicean age to begin to have the
[1:36:55] cares of this world to enter in but Lord
[1:36:57] we want to keep the fervency of the
[1:37:00] gospel within our hearts Lord to not let
[1:37:03] these little foxes that spoil the vine
[1:37:05] the little things that that we we're
[1:37:08] hearing the thread of the devil and not
[1:37:10] rebuking it Lord or to be letting our
[1:37:13] eyes look upon the things that the devil
[1:37:15] brings to us Lord and and and not
[1:37:18] rejecting it Lord forgive us
[1:37:20] or when we allow thoughts to rise in our
[1:37:24] hearts so we know are not right and yet
[1:37:26] we don't take care of it Lord forgive us
[1:37:29] father when we hear the word that says
[1:37:32] we ought to do this and then we just
[1:37:34] never seem to get around to doing that
[1:37:38] Lord forgive us father Lord you brought
[1:37:42] your word we want to say yes and amen to
[1:37:44] it or we know that you're coming too
[1:37:46] soon father we don't know how many times
[1:37:48] your Holy Spirit will bring the
[1:37:50] refreshing below when you're refreshing
[1:37:53] does come Lord we want our heart to be
[1:37:55] ready so we don't find ourselves on the
[1:37:58] outside looking in like Simon Lord or
[1:38:00] like Judas floor please father forgive
[1:38:03] us Lord of all of our foolishness and
[1:38:06] our iniquity the gall of bitterness and
[1:38:09] the deceitfulness of riches and iniquity
[1:38:14] Lord forgive us father we want to give
[1:38:16] up a hundred percent Lord you though we
[1:38:18] might be real Christians in the name of
[1:38:21] the Lord Jesus Christ we pray have mercy
[1:38:23] upon us Lord and forgive us of our sins
[1:38:27] and all of our iniquities in the name of
[1:38:29] Jesus Christ we pray let it be done
[1:38:32] amen brother Isaac if you come a manaphy
[1:38:37] my desires prayer amen you know and God
[1:38:41] when God brings a message he always lays
[1:38:48] out a path for that message to be
[1:38:50] received Amen if God ever speaks
[1:38:55] anything from behind this pulpit he has
[1:38:58] a way for you to receive that they meant
[1:39:02] and if God has spoken to your heart in
[1:39:05] any least a little bit if your heart has
[1:39:07] been hardened and by God has somehow
[1:39:09] gotten through your eyes and your ears
[1:39:12] and has that word is landed upon your
[1:39:15] heart and you've been given an
[1:39:16] opportunity right now to either soften
[1:39:19] your heart or harden your heart and that
[1:39:24] choice lays before every single one of
[1:39:26] us amen
[1:39:28] now if we have things in our lives that
[1:39:30] we know are not right we know that those
[1:39:33] things are contrary to the gospel that
[1:39:37] has been preached then we know that
[1:39:41] right now God is laying a path a door is
[1:39:44] open right before us to repent what an
[1:39:51] opportunity what a chance what an
[1:39:56] opportunity that we could repent of our
[1:39:58] sins and be forgiven of our sins what a
[1:40:02] blessing we had Simon hardened his heart
[1:40:08] and found himself on the outside looking
[1:40:11] in and Philip had to tell him go seek
[1:40:14] repentance find out if maybe after
[1:40:17] you've you've heard the gospel preached
[1:40:19] week after week after week after week
[1:40:21] you've been following this revival and
[1:40:23] you still haven't repented of your sins
[1:40:26] I'm looking down into your heart God has
[1:40:28] given me a vision to peer down inside
[1:40:31] your heart and I perceive the gall of
[1:40:33] bitterness and the bonds of iniquity are
[1:40:37] still there after every service still
[1:40:42] there after every altar call it's still
[1:40:45] there
[1:40:46] and the word has come and you didn't
[1:40:49] repent and the word is coming you didn't
[1:40:51] repent and now the holy ghost has come
[1:40:53] the revival is here now people are
[1:40:57] rejoicing and you cannot enter in
[1:40:59] because your heart has been so hardened
[1:41:04] Wow Lord God have mercy on us and yet
[1:41:11] every message God gives an opportunity
[1:41:14] to accept that message a chance an
[1:41:19] opportunity that we can soften our
[1:41:21] hearts that somehow maybe just maybe we
[1:41:26] could find a way to get back to
[1:41:28] repentance because only the pure in
[1:41:32] heart can see God I say oh I want to see
[1:41:35] him you can't do it when you have your
[1:41:37] heart so hardened by holding back these
[1:41:41] sins and iniquities and not allowing
[1:41:45] Christ to massage that heart of yours
[1:41:49] again and to remove all those stony
[1:41:51] parties three and a half years Lord
[1:41:54] worked with them and he still had to
[1:41:56] come back and do another work just to
[1:41:58] get them to understand I'm here to eat
[1:42:01] the Passover with you with desire I've
[1:42:04] desired to gather you together so that
[1:42:06] you might receive the lamb for your
[1:42:08] atonement but you would not your heart
[1:42:10] still hardened yet amen oh we come into
[1:42:13] this church and we do not give up these
[1:42:15] little sins and these little things not
[1:42:17] realizing that every week our heart is
[1:42:20] getting harder and harder and harder so
[1:42:23] when the Holy Ghost comes how can we
[1:42:26] receive the revival how can we receive
[1:42:30] the rapture how can we receive these
[1:42:32] things well we won't let God do the
[1:42:35] things that he's trying to do amen if
[1:42:38] God is working on your heart this
[1:42:39] morning I challenge you to come up here
[1:42:42] they meant make a sign of repentance for
[1:42:46] God with every message gives an open
[1:42:48] door to receive that sign amen amen if
[1:42:52] God is working on your heart then come
[1:42:55] on the ark the altar is open God has a
[1:42:58] table spread with
[1:43:00] of God or faith amen and applo away an
[1:43:03] opportunity for your hardened heart who
[1:43:07] has been taking these sins to church
[1:43:10] day-in day-out
