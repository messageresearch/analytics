[47:09] me
[47:30] [Music]
[47:37] some new ones and
[47:39] uh you know we're just grateful for the
[47:41] opportunity to be here this evening by
[47:42] god's grace the lord just kind of worked
[47:44] it out that
[47:46] we had been wanting to be able to come
[47:47] out and brother brooks
[47:50] had a desire to have us come and
[47:52] minister but it didn't seem like things
[47:53] were going to work out but the lord you
[47:55] know the lord makes a way where there
[47:56] seems to be no way
[47:58] so we're just grateful to be here by
[48:00] god's grace
[48:02] and
[48:03] it's a little bit
[48:04] time spent a little bit already so maybe
[48:06] we'll just get right into the word here
[48:09] it's just good to be back at
[48:11] my second home in iowa
[48:14] you know i
[48:15] grew up in ohio and came out here for a
[48:18] number of years and
[48:20] this still feels like home number two to
[48:22] me you know when i go back to ohio it
[48:24] still feels like home that's where i
[48:25] spent most of my time and even though
[48:26] i've been down in texas now for
[48:29] going on seven years this still feels
[48:31] like my second home amen
[48:34] and uh no matter where you go where the
[48:35] spirit of the lord is it is home so
[48:38] right so we're so thankful for that
[48:41] uh
[48:42] just really uh grateful by the grace of
[48:44] god to be here so
[48:45] you just pray for me and
[48:48] you know no matter what you do you know
[48:51] if even if you don't feel like it that's
[48:53] why it's called a sacrifice of praise
[48:56] you know
[48:57] you know your flesh never feels like
[48:58] serving the lord but you know what we do
[49:00] is we sacrifice it every single day by
[49:02] putting it down putting that old man
[49:04] down
[49:04] dying to the flesh
[49:06] and living living for the the if we
[49:09] could say this way the inside man the
[49:11] the spirit man on the inside so let's
[49:13] just turn to a couple passages of
[49:15] scripture this evening
[49:17] galatians chapter 3
[49:20] verses 1 through 10
[49:22] would start at verse 1. i don't know how
[49:23] far we'll go reading down here and then
[49:26] from there we're going to go
[49:28] to second timothy chapter three
[49:33] and then from there we're gonna go to
[49:34] matthew chapter eight
[49:36] and uh
[49:38] i was telling brother brooks there when
[49:39] i got a chance to greet him here before
[49:41] service you know my heart my heart's
[49:42] full you see brother brother keith and
[49:45] brother troy and his family and just
[49:47] different ones that we haven't seen in a
[49:49] long time and it's just you know it's so
[49:51] encouraging to see soldiers still
[49:53] standing on the front lines
[49:55] you know especially in the hour that
[49:57] we're living in
[49:58] so we thank the lord for that and
[50:01] we'll start in galatians chapter 3.
[50:04] it says
[50:05] starting in verse 1 o foolish galatians
[50:09] who hath bewitched you that ye should
[50:11] not obey the truth but for whose eyes
[50:14] jesus christ hath been evidently set
[50:16] forth crucified among you
[50:19] this only what i learn of you received
[50:21] ye the spirit by the works of the law or
[50:24] by the hearing of faith are ye so
[50:26] foolish having begun in the spirit are
[50:29] you now made perfect by the flesh
[50:31] have ye suffered so many things in vain
[50:34] if it be yet in vain
[50:36] he therefore that ministereth to you the
[50:38] spirit and worketh miracles among you
[50:40] doeth he by it doeth he it by the works
[50:42] of the law or by the hearing of faith
[50:45] even as abraham believed god and it was
[50:47] accounted to him for righteousness
[50:49] know ye therefore that they which are of
[50:51] faith the same are the children of
[50:54] abraham
[50:55] and the scripture for seeing that god
[50:57] would justify the heathen through faith
[50:59] preached before the gospel unto abraham
[51:01] saying in thee shall all nations be
[51:04] blessed so then they which are of be of
[51:06] faith are blessed with faithful abraham
[51:10] amen and then we're going to go to
[51:12] second timothy chapter three
[51:15] maybe just kind of a
[51:17] disparate seeming group of scriptures
[51:19] here but
[51:20] we're just trusting that the lord will
[51:22] lead us in where we're supposed to go
[51:27] start to second timothy chapter three
[51:29] we'll read verses one through five
[51:32] this know also that in the last days
[51:34] perilous times shall come for men shall
[51:36] be lovers of their own selves covetous
[51:38] boasters proud blasphemers disobedient
[51:41] to parents unthankful unholy without
[51:44] natural affection truth breakers false
[51:46] accusers incontinent fierce despisers of
[51:49] those that are good
[51:51] traitors heady high-minded lovers of
[51:54] pleasures more than lovers of god having
[51:56] a form of godliness but denying the
[51:58] power thereof from such turn away
[52:01] and then we're going to go over to
[52:02] matthew chapter eight
[52:06] and uh this evening
[52:09] we'll just see where the lord would go i
[52:11] i have a uh you know how the lord puts
[52:13] sometimes
[52:15] seems like your heart's just kind of
[52:16] bursting with
[52:17] thoughts that he
[52:18] maybe the lord might desire to express
[52:20] but we're just trusting that he'll go
[52:21] exactly where
[52:23] he wants us to go
[52:25] matthew chapter 8 verses 5-10
[52:29] and when jesus was entered into
[52:30] capernaum there came unto him a
[52:32] centurion beseeching him and saying lord
[52:35] my servant lieth at home sick of the
[52:37] palsy grievously tormented
[52:40] and jesus saith unto him i will come and
[52:42] heal him the centurion answered and said
[52:44] lord i am not worthy that thou should
[52:46] has come under my roof
[52:48] but speak the word only and my servant
[52:50] shall be healed
[52:51] for my for i am a man under authority
[52:54] having soldiers under me and i say to
[52:56] this man go and he goeth and to another
[52:58] come and he cometh and to my servant do
[53:01] this and he doeth it when jesus heard it
[53:03] he marveled and said to them that
[53:06] followed verily i say unto you i have
[53:09] not found so great faith no
[53:11] not in israel
[53:13] amen
[53:14] remember what the prophet the prophet
[53:16] told us he said that that
[53:18] that's a gentile faith right there
[53:21] that's a gentile faith amen that's the
[53:23] faith whether you believe it or not
[53:25] maybe maybe you haven't been persuaded
[53:26] yet but that's the faith that you
[53:28] possess
[53:29] right there amen let's just power heads
[53:31] in the word of prayer heavenly father
[53:33] lord as we've just come
[53:35] lord that once again has fallen our lot
[53:36] lord to to minister the word of life oh
[53:38] god but we know
[53:40] lord no man can truly minister the word
[53:42] but lord you just given a gift to get
[53:44] out of the way lord but we're desiring
[53:46] father that you would speak to your
[53:47] children this evening
[53:48] father we could certainly rejoice over
[53:50] the scriptures in an intellectual
[53:52] fashion and see lord the many wonderful
[53:54] christ you yourself doesn't come and
[53:56] break the word of life to the hearts of
[53:58] the believer it would profit us nothing
[54:00] oh god
[54:01] lord you said we could know all
[54:02] mysteries but if we didn't have charity
[54:04] it availeth nothing and we know charity
[54:06] is you lord in the person of the holy
[54:08] ghost
[54:09] lord we're asking right now oh god that
[54:10] you would walk up now the isles of the
[54:12] hearts of your children this evening
[54:14] lord have your perfect will and way done
[54:16] oh god we're not here to hear from a man
[54:18] lord but to hear from you bless the
[54:20] speaker lord myself i don't ask a
[54:22] blessing just for myself lord in any
[54:24] carnal sense but oh god that i would get
[54:26] out of the way lord that you would be
[54:28] glorified get glory unto yourself lord
[54:30] and bless the hearers lord that they may
[54:32] also get out of the way lord if there be
[54:34] anything that would be binding them lord
[54:35] anything that would be trying to hinder
[54:37] the work of god lord you gave your
[54:39] children authority father we come in the
[54:41] authority in the name of jesus christ to
[54:42] bind that spirit lord whatever it might
[54:45] be and we cast it down to the head of
[54:46] hell from once it came lord may you have
[54:48] your perfect will and way this evening
[54:50] lord in the name of jesus christ we pray
[54:52] amen amen you may have your seats
[54:55] by god's grace we just if we give a
[54:57] title
[54:58] uh
[54:59] i just maybe speak on
[55:01] the power of obedience
[55:03] and as a
[55:04] subtitle we want to speak of
[55:08] authority under headship
[55:11] and
[55:13] i guess it's just been impressed upon me
[55:15] lately what the lord's really put on my
[55:17] heart so much lately
[55:20] is uh in the world that we're living in
[55:22] in such a gross darkness we understand
[55:24] that
[55:25] it would be a it would be a darkness
[55:26] among the people gross darkness so much
[55:28] that could be felt
[55:29] and i believe each one of us can feel
[55:31] that darkness you know pressing every
[55:33] single day that we live you know
[55:35] we see if you pay any attention to the
[55:37] things that are going on in the world
[55:38] you understand it's absolute insanity
[55:41] there's no doubt that uh the only the
[55:44] only sane
[55:45] the only sane person is a christian in
[55:47] this
[55:48] in this world
[55:49] but
[55:51] you know i'm impressed
[55:53] more and more
[55:55] you know as we've come into so much
[55:56] knowledge
[55:57] and revelation that we've received to
[55:59] the hearing of the word in this hour
[56:03] if i could say the thing that's come to
[56:05] my mind more and more is that when this
[56:07] is all said and done it's nothing but
[56:08] grace
[56:10] that's right
[56:11] because i feel and i've noticed if i
[56:13] could just maybe point the finger at
[56:15] myself a little bit i've noticed that as
[56:17] you come more and more into a knowledge
[56:19] of the saving grace of the lord through
[56:21] the message that we've received amen
[56:23] there is such a tendency of man because
[56:26] man always wants to see something they
[56:28] can put their hands to that's true but
[56:30] we understand if we go all the way back
[56:32] the lord even foreshadowed this all the
[56:33] way back in the old testament in the
[56:35] very beginning
[56:36] when he said i believe it was in
[56:37] deuteronomy the lord said if you would
[56:38] make an altar unto me he said make it of
[56:41] pile the stones one upon another and he
[56:43] said don't even lift your tool upon
[56:44] these stuff
[56:46] he said because if you lift your tool
[56:47] upon the stones he said you polluted my
[56:50] altar
[56:51] and what happens is so many times this
[56:53] man desires to do a service for god
[56:55] because they know that there is
[56:57] something disconnecting them from the
[56:58] lord that's right and and we've
[57:00] understood since the very beginning when
[57:02] man fell in the garden of eden that they
[57:05] had a they had a grace that they didn't
[57:06] even know they had i believe our uh uh
[57:09] brother branham called it he called it
[57:11] it was it was a holy veil
[57:13] that was upon the eyes of his children
[57:15] on adam and eve in the garden so much so
[57:18] that they were covered with so much
[57:20] holiness
[57:21] that they didn't even know they were
[57:22] naked and there was no shame
[57:25] and a person on the outside that would
[57:26] look what maybe in our minds would look
[57:29] upon it and say well that's a crazy
[57:30] thing
[57:31] but because there was so much holiness
[57:33] that was there
[57:34] that they couldn't even see that
[57:36] supposed shame there wasn't even shame
[57:38] to be had amen because they were so
[57:40] underneath the veil of holiness amen
[57:43] and that wasn't a veil of anything that
[57:45] they had done
[57:46] there was a freely given veil simply by
[57:49] being underneath the covenant that they
[57:52] had received amen a holiness covenant
[57:55] underneath the word of god amen provided
[57:57] a veil of holiness in so much that there
[57:59] wasn't even anything to be ashamed of
[58:02] and how the devil tries to steal
[58:04] that veil of holiness from his people in
[58:06] this hour
[58:08] and that's why we read in galatians
[58:10] paul says to them he says oh foolish
[58:12] galatians who hath bewitched you
[58:15] that sounds
[58:16] really similar to what we found in the
[58:18] garden of eden
[58:20] how the serpent beguiled eve amen even
[58:22] paul would tell tell the to tell the
[58:25] people later on in another epistle he
[58:27] said i fear
[58:28] lest as the serpent beguile thee
[58:31] by his septility you would be beguiled
[58:34] away from the truth of god the what he
[58:36] called the simplicity
[58:39] in christ
[58:41] because we come to so much knowledge of
[58:43] this world amen so many wonderful
[58:45] revelations and i
[58:47] glory in the revelation i thank the lord
[58:50] for the right it gives me well even paul
[58:52] said he said i'll sing with the
[58:53] understanding he said i'll preach with
[58:55] the understanding i want to have the
[58:57] understanding but if we're not careful
[59:00] we'll come too far into the other side
[59:02] of it and find out that knowledge
[59:03] puffeth up amen
[59:05] and we've received a great treasure of
[59:07] knowledge in this hour amen but brothers
[59:10] and sisters i want to have the mind of
[59:12] our apostle paul he said i desire to
[59:14] know nothing among you save christ and
[59:17] him crucify amen that's what i want to
[59:19] have amen i i want to i i've i've had
[59:22] such impressed upon me lately because if
[59:25] it's if it's not going to be grace to
[59:27] get us out of here what else is it going
[59:28] to be amen
[59:31] were you made did you receive this
[59:33] message
[59:35] by your works and denomination
[59:38] did you receive
[59:39] this word of the hour
[59:41] by your works out there in the world
[59:42] when you didn't even care about god
[59:44] that's right no but you received it by
[59:47] the hearing of faith
[59:49] through the grace of the lord jesus
[59:50] christ
[59:52] did you receive the holy ghost
[59:54] because you went and did this great work
[59:56] or did this great thing but by simply
[59:59] pause that it was because you've obeyed
[1:00:01] from the heart
[1:00:03] that form of doctrine that was delivered
[1:00:05] unto you amen amen didn't even obey it
[1:00:08] necessarily all in the flesh he said you
[1:00:10] obeyed it in the heart amen because when
[1:00:12] you heard the word of god there was
[1:00:14] something inside of you that cried out
[1:00:17] that be so amen amen you didn't even
[1:00:20] know what it was you couldn't understand
[1:00:22] it to this day you probably still don't
[1:00:24] understand it to some extent yeah when
[1:00:26] when you're at it feels like you're at
[1:00:28] the end of your frazzled rope yeah and
[1:00:30] you want to throw your hands up and you
[1:00:32] just want to lay down and die
[1:00:34] but there's something holding on to you
[1:00:36] on the inside of the inside that you
[1:00:39] even if you wanted to give up yes sir
[1:00:42] amen i confess to you in my flesh my
[1:00:45] wife wouldn't even tell you there's been
[1:00:46] times i said i just want to give up yeah
[1:00:49] i'm tired of it i can't do it
[1:00:52] but then there's something then when
[1:00:54] that moment comes and there's that flesh
[1:00:56] that feels it's just warring and warmth
[1:00:58] there's something on the inside that
[1:01:00] stands up amen
[1:01:02] it says though he slay me yet i trust
[1:01:05] him
[1:01:06] that turns back to the word
[1:01:08] and then the devil tries to whisper in
[1:01:10] your ear and say you can't do it
[1:01:13] and there's something in the word that
[1:01:14] says that's right
[1:01:16] you can't do it you never could do it
[1:01:19] you still can't do it
[1:01:22] but there is a god there is a blood
[1:01:25] there is a holy ghost that can do it for
[1:01:28] you that's already done it for you amen
[1:01:31] amen that's right have we frustrated the
[1:01:34] grace of god
[1:01:35] by trying to perfect ourselves by by
[1:01:38] carnal works yes sir
[1:01:41] brothers and sisters i believe in works
[1:01:43] i think we honestly don't have enough of
[1:01:44] them sometimes because the devil's
[1:01:46] hamstrung us to the point where we feel
[1:01:49] like if the lord puts something in our
[1:01:51] heart to do
[1:01:52] he's right there to say well you're just
[1:01:53] trying to work for your own salvation no
[1:01:55] it's because i'm saved
[1:01:57] it's because his holy ghost is in me
[1:02:00] that i desire to do something for it
[1:02:02] [Applause]
[1:02:03] but i know
[1:02:04] that nothing that i do
[1:02:06] that's not what grants me salvation that
[1:02:08] doesn't give me standing with god but
[1:02:10] it's because he's changed my life it's
[1:02:13] because he changed my desires it's
[1:02:15] because he's completely turned me around
[1:02:18] that i desire to do those things
[1:02:22] but it's so simple it'll pass right over
[1:02:24] us
[1:02:26] that's the don't we do we live in an age
[1:02:28] of complexity yes sir
[1:02:30] infinite complexity everywhere you go
[1:02:33] the computer's getting smaller and
[1:02:35] smaller and more complex
[1:02:37] your job tasks they seem simpler because
[1:02:39] you just point and click yeah right but
[1:02:42] then they pile on 500 million more of
[1:02:44] them than you ever had before
[1:02:46] how is it when we have computing power
[1:02:49] to do millions of things a day
[1:02:52] we have less time than we ever did
[1:02:54] because it's a deception from the devil
[1:02:57] that's real knowledge of good and evil
[1:02:59] sucking the life from the people
[1:03:02] we've got to become simpler
[1:03:04] we've got to become more humble yeah
[1:03:06] we've got to get out of our own ideas of
[1:03:09] what this what this life is in jesus
[1:03:11] christ amen
[1:03:15] we've
[1:03:17] we've we've come i believe i feel
[1:03:20] that we've come to expect the wrong
[1:03:22] things
[1:03:23] what exactly are we expecting in this
[1:03:25] hour
[1:03:27] what are we expecting because you get
[1:03:29] what you expect
[1:03:31] you get what you expect
[1:03:33] but if what you expect isn't according
[1:03:35] to the word
[1:03:37] then you're going to be looking for
[1:03:38] something that ain't ever going to come
[1:03:40] amen
[1:03:42] yes sir
[1:03:43] this is totally different from what i
[1:03:44] was going to preach but i'm just going
[1:03:45] to go this way anyway because that's why
[1:03:46] i feel led to go
[1:03:48] amen
[1:03:49] you think about what the devil has got
[1:03:50] the people see right now the the lie
[1:03:53] that the devil is selling to the people
[1:03:56] is that we have so much knowledge in
[1:03:57] this message that we've got it all
[1:03:59] figured out that's right brother that we
[1:04:01] can nail it down to a t exactly when
[1:04:03] where what how why it's gonna happen yes
[1:04:05] sir but it's it's not that way because
[1:04:08] if it was that way it couldn't be a
[1:04:10] faith
[1:04:11] it could not be of faith if you knew it
[1:04:14] if you knew it up here
[1:04:16] it cannot be faith
[1:04:19] it can't be
[1:04:20] because it once it goes into the
[1:04:22] intellectual thing see when i turn my
[1:04:25] car i don't know enough about a car to
[1:04:26] know how every part works so i live by
[1:04:28] faith
[1:04:29] i believe that when i turn the ignition
[1:04:32] i know some basics but i don't know all
[1:04:33] the the
[1:04:34] the crank ratios and the gear ratios and
[1:04:37] all that stuff but i don't need to know
[1:04:39] i know by experience that it works when
[1:04:42] i turn the key
[1:04:43] same thing with this word i don't need
[1:04:45] to know exactly how it's going to do it
[1:04:48] but i know that when that key has been
[1:04:50] entered into the right throw that holy
[1:04:52] ghost is entered into my heart
[1:04:54] and god turns that key and ain't you
[1:04:56] turning the key but when god turns that
[1:04:58] key
[1:05:00] it's gonna fire why because it's it's
[1:05:02] the faith that he's placed in his people
[1:05:05] amen
[1:05:07] we make it so complicated well if i do
[1:05:10] this and if i do this and if i do this
[1:05:13] god will do this
[1:05:15] no he promised it because you can't do
[1:05:18] it yourself amen
[1:05:20] and so many times we frustrate ourselves
[1:05:23] by beating our head against the wall
[1:05:26] but what are you expecting from god see
[1:05:28] abraham see sarah when god promised
[1:05:30] abraham a son by sarah
[1:05:33] sarah who's the type of the bride
[1:05:35] thought she'd get an idea she thought
[1:05:37] well i can figure out how god's gonna do
[1:05:39] it abraham who represented the word
[1:05:42] because the prophet represents the word
[1:05:44] he said you go and go with this this
[1:05:46] bond woman yeah see god allowed it
[1:05:51] just like he'll allow you
[1:05:52] to sow to the wind and reap a whirlwind
[1:05:54] sometimes
[1:05:56] he'll allow it and say all right you're
[1:05:58] going to suffer but i'll let you do it
[1:06:00] just to prove to you that my word is the
[1:06:02] ultimate and there's no way around it
[1:06:05] sarah you're gonna have it yeah right
[1:06:07] amen i'm here to tell you tonight you're
[1:06:10] going to have it dude
[1:06:11] i don't care how many times you've tried
[1:06:13] to mingle this word with your own ideas
[1:06:16] it'll bring forth the wild man every
[1:06:18] time
[1:06:19] but she had a certain expectation of how
[1:06:21] it might come because her patients
[1:06:24] couldn't quite take it yet
[1:06:25] right she knew there was a promise there
[1:06:28] she's heard it from abraham yeah but she
[1:06:30] just couldn't quite accept it for
[1:06:32] herself amen amen you know the scripture
[1:06:35] says that that she that sarah received
[1:06:38] strength to conceive seed
[1:06:41] it said having been persuaded
[1:06:43] you know what god's trying to do to you
[1:06:44] right now he's trying to persuade you
[1:06:47] he's trying to persuade you right now of
[1:06:50] one simple fact
[1:06:52] that what god has promised that he is
[1:06:55] able to perform
[1:06:56] that's what he let god persuade you
[1:06:58] tonight let him persuade you that when
[1:07:02] he says something about you that is thus
[1:07:04] saith the lord and it has to come to
[1:07:06] pass
[1:07:07] you can stand on that rock you can stand
[1:07:10] on that revelation when he gives you
[1:07:12] that revelation that i am christ i am
[1:07:15] god and i change not i have the same
[1:07:17] yesterday today and forever if you come
[1:07:19] to me on the same basis that they came
[1:07:22] to me back there i will perform exactly
[1:07:24] the same way that i performed back there
[1:07:28] the problem is though it doesn't always
[1:07:30] come in the way that you're meant to
[1:07:32] your carnal mind expects it to come
[1:07:36] this rapture is going to be so humble
[1:07:40] it's going to be so simple
[1:07:42] and they're going to miss it a million
[1:07:44] miles
[1:07:45] because they're looking for some great
[1:07:46] thing to happen
[1:07:48] they don't know
[1:07:49] that a little church of maybe 30 people
[1:07:53] yeah in des moines iowa on a wednesday
[1:07:56] night
[1:07:57] pretty soon 30 people gone they wouldn't
[1:07:58] know nothing about it
[1:08:00] i'm believing everybody in here one of
[1:08:01] these days it's just gone not even gonna
[1:08:04] know what happened he'd say but i
[1:08:06] thought yeah
[1:08:07] i thought that we're gonna run through a
[1:08:10] troop
[1:08:11] i thought we were gonna leap over a wall
[1:08:13] yeah what are you expecting
[1:08:15] that's right here's my quest that's my
[1:08:17] question what do you expect that's right
[1:08:19] because i tell you what the word told me
[1:08:20] yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:08:22] the word said that when that one came
[1:08:24] crying voice crying in the wilderness
[1:08:26] makes straight the path of the lord it
[1:08:28] said the hills the mountains would melt
[1:08:30] like wax
[1:08:31] they said the hills would leap like
[1:08:32] little rams they said the high places
[1:08:34] would be made low the crooked place is
[1:08:36] made straight the rough place is made
[1:08:38] plain amen amen but i tell you what when
[1:08:40] he fulfilled that word it was one man
[1:08:45] one crazy looking man down by the river
[1:08:48] yet repent
[1:08:50] for the kingdom of heaven is at hand
[1:08:52] that is the great god said that was the
[1:08:56] greatest man born of a woman up to that
[1:08:58] point and he said but the least in the
[1:09:00] kingdom of heaven is greater than him
[1:09:02] yes that's you
[1:09:04] okay i'll say that's me i'm the least in
[1:09:05] the kingdom yes i'll say i won't just
[1:09:07] say it for you you may be greater that's
[1:09:08] fine but for me i may be the least i'm
[1:09:10] the least but i'm greater than that
[1:09:13] but if he fulfilled it that way that
[1:09:15] time
[1:09:16] what will it be this time
[1:09:18] oh we hear about tent visions we hear
[1:09:20] about third poles we hear about missing
[1:09:23] limbs being restored i believe all of
[1:09:24] that amen i believe why because i'm
[1:09:26] waiting for some of it myself
[1:09:28] and it's already coming that hands my
[1:09:31] head you know about my hand being almost
[1:09:32] cut off it's coming brother
[1:09:35] you know what and it won't be an open
[1:09:37] show and that's fine but i believe
[1:09:39] you'll see it because you got a chance
[1:09:41] to witness the beginning of it you'll
[1:09:43] see the ending of it i believe it 100
[1:09:45] by the grace of god i don't know how
[1:09:47] he's going to do it i don't know where
[1:09:48] he's going to do it i don't know whether
[1:09:49] he's going to do it i don't care who
[1:09:50] knows about it
[1:09:51] but i know one thing i don't know about
[1:09:53] it and then when i do you'll know about
[1:09:55] it it may not get plastered over the
[1:09:56] newspapers for all i know we could be
[1:09:58] underground in house churches by then i
[1:10:00] don't know but one thing i know he that
[1:10:03] begun a good work he is faithful to
[1:10:05] performance
[1:10:07] and i have been persuaded right
[1:10:10] i have been persuaded
[1:10:13] that what he promised he's able to
[1:10:15] perform that's right
[1:10:16] you know how i know because i've tried
[1:10:18] to run hallelujah i've tried to fail
[1:10:22] i've tried to beat my head
[1:10:24] i've tried
[1:10:25] he care you won't let me go amen
[1:10:29] praise the lord jesus that i'm a
[1:10:31] prisoner
[1:10:33] praise the lord amen
[1:10:35] i didn't do it
[1:10:36] i didn't ask for it yes sir he did it to
[1:10:39] me
[1:10:40] and i can't help but love him because of
[1:10:42] it
[1:10:43] although he slayed me yet i'll trust him
[1:10:45] oh i've made my complaints known
[1:10:48] i've spent i've spilled many an idol
[1:10:50] word but you know what i'm not relying
[1:10:51] on my power i'm relying upon the grace
[1:10:54] of god i am relying on his grace to see
[1:10:58] me through
[1:11:01] he promised it he will finish it how i
[1:11:05] don't know all i know is we've got these
[1:11:07] big carnal ideas of what's about to
[1:11:10] happen when this rapture comes but i
[1:11:12] know one thing enoch was the type of the
[1:11:15] bride and there's only about five
[1:11:17] scriptures in the whole bible written
[1:11:19] about it
[1:11:22] what do you think we're gonna be
[1:11:26] why because
[1:11:27] the lord jesus god loves
[1:11:30] to hide a thing he said he said it's the
[1:11:32] glory of the lord to conceal a man
[1:11:36] i love it it's his glory to conceal it
[1:11:39] he said but the hidden things belong to
[1:11:41] us
[1:11:42] glory to god those hidden things they
[1:11:45] belong to me
[1:11:46] that's why i can say i know i'm there
[1:11:48] you know what
[1:11:49] you say brother oh i thought we're gonna
[1:11:51] leap over a wall you run through a troop
[1:11:53] you don't if you could see the troop of
[1:11:55] demons you had to run through to come to
[1:11:57] this service today amen you're running
[1:11:59] 200 million that's 200 million demons
[1:12:01] lose from the river euphrates that's
[1:12:03] right you ran through a troop to get
[1:12:05] here you didn't even know it
[1:12:07] you know me you owe me stronghold walls
[1:12:10] you leap over every single day
[1:12:12] just to try just that for god to give
[1:12:14] you a heart to serve him in this hour
[1:12:18] and not only to serve him but to serve
[1:12:20] him according to the revealed worthy
[1:12:21] hour
[1:12:23] see the pharisees were convinced
[1:12:26] that they had it all
[1:12:27] oh we know how he's going to come we've
[1:12:29] got all this we've got all that a bunch
[1:12:31] of pharisees and sadducees had their
[1:12:34] minds so made up they had their
[1:12:35] expectations set
[1:12:38] so when he came
[1:12:39] in a manger
[1:12:41] in a stable
[1:12:42] in the form of a baby
[1:12:45] they couldn't receive it
[1:12:47] so how will it be now
[1:12:50] how will be now
[1:12:52] i can't claim to say that i know exactly
[1:12:54] what it's going to look like according
[1:12:55] to the according what we're going to see
[1:12:57] on the outside but i know the life that
[1:12:59] it lives by the word
[1:13:00] i know the nature that it has by the
[1:13:02] word because if there's one thing we've
[1:13:04] learned
[1:13:05] through the holy ghost and the revealing
[1:13:07] of the word it's that it's his nature
[1:13:09] that doesn't change
[1:13:11] his nature doesn't change
[1:13:13] so we think oh my we get all these
[1:13:15] carnal things and the devil beat you
[1:13:17] down because oh you're not doing this
[1:13:18] great thing and you're not doing that
[1:13:20] great thing and you're not it's never
[1:13:21] been about you anyway so get yourself
[1:13:23] out of the equation
[1:13:24] but what is he doing through you
[1:13:26] what is he doing for you
[1:13:28] do you have a desire to serve god
[1:13:31] praise the lord
[1:13:32] do you have a desire deep down in your
[1:13:34] heart to live this message
[1:13:36] so close
[1:13:38] that there's no separation between you
[1:13:40] and your savior
[1:13:41] that's god
[1:13:43] that is that is such a treasure that you
[1:13:45] don't even know you hold yeah
[1:13:47] if you could cling to that
[1:13:49] just cling to that
[1:13:51] and hold on to it and stop it say lord
[1:13:54] get my expectation out of the way
[1:13:56] amen
[1:13:57] let your expectation be made known to me
[1:14:01] it's the grace of god that's gonna do it
[1:14:03] in romans chapter four
[1:14:05] let's turn there and read the scripture
[1:14:07] here
[1:14:09] i'm just you know i get excited because
[1:14:11] the more and more i see it brothers and
[1:14:12] sisters the more and more i realize it's
[1:14:14] such a fixed game
[1:14:15] it's such a rigged situation
[1:14:19] he wants someone to believe him to the
[1:14:22] end amen
[1:14:24] he wants a mesh a shadrach meshach and
[1:14:26] abednego yes he wants someone that ain't
[1:14:29] going to bow the knee
[1:14:31] even if it looks like all hope is lost
[1:14:34] he wants someone that like daniel
[1:14:37] that even when the the career is made he
[1:14:40] just keeps serving the lord now i don't
[1:14:42] know what they're going to do but i'm
[1:14:43] going to serve by god
[1:14:45] doesn't matter what it looks like romans
[1:14:46] chapter 4
[1:14:48] verses 14 to 16 it said for if they
[1:14:51] which are of the law be heirs then faith
[1:14:54] is made void
[1:14:55] and the promise made of none effect
[1:14:59] because the law worketh wrath for where
[1:15:01] no law is there is no transgression
[1:15:04] now i want you to listen to this next
[1:15:06] scripture
[1:15:07] therefore it is of faith
[1:15:10] that it might be by grace
[1:15:13] so it's not of it's not of your works we
[1:15:15] already know that these are simple
[1:15:16] things brothers and sisters but i
[1:15:17] believe that as the hour gets late you
[1:15:20] see you you start to realize that the
[1:15:22] close you get to the lord jesus
[1:15:24] and i believe he's been drawing this
[1:15:26] closer and closer you may not feel it
[1:15:28] but he's doing it
[1:15:30] because the only the only way you can
[1:15:32] stand in this hour
[1:15:34] is to cling more closely to him
[1:15:35] it's the only way that you can stand i
[1:15:38] don't stand here by my own ability
[1:15:41] i i know and none of you do either i'm
[1:15:44] sorry to burst your bubble if you
[1:15:45] thought you did so well
[1:15:47] but only one
[1:15:48] ran the race in one amen only one one
[1:15:53] and by the grace of god i was in him
[1:15:56] but i want therefore it is of faith that
[1:15:59] it might be by grace
[1:16:02] i love this to the end that means for
[1:16:04] the purpose this is the reason why he
[1:16:06] made it this way that the promise might
[1:16:09] be sure to all the seeds
[1:16:12] so he made it so simple
[1:16:14] you believe
[1:16:16] that with that faith that's inside
[1:16:19] and because of that he made the promise
[1:16:21] completely sure to you
[1:16:24] that sure means it's solid it's
[1:16:26] steadfast
[1:16:28] you know the scripture says that when
[1:16:30] god made the promise to abraham he said
[1:16:32] he because there was no greater he swore
[1:16:33] by himself that's right he said because
[1:16:35] there's a couple of immutable things he
[1:16:37] said in which it is impossible for god
[1:16:39] to lie
[1:16:40] amen see and the devil has been trying
[1:16:43] in this hour now to steal away
[1:16:47] the promise that you've received
[1:16:50] when you heard this message
[1:16:52] when the holy ghost came and revealed
[1:16:54] himself to you and filled you and sealed
[1:16:56] you away
[1:16:57] god gave you a promise
[1:16:59] he said you are sealed until the day of
[1:17:01] your redemption
[1:17:02] he said he said when i come will i find
[1:17:05] faith in the earth that's what he's
[1:17:07] looking for right now amen he said he
[1:17:09] didn't say will i find these great works
[1:17:11] will i find these mighty people doing
[1:17:13] these crazy things that that are just
[1:17:15] gonna like shock everybody and ever no
[1:17:17] he said when he comes will he find faith
[1:17:20] in the earth amen is there someone that
[1:17:21] will stand on the word of god
[1:17:23] no matter what it looks like
[1:17:25] no matter if they have to stand alone
[1:17:27] doesn't matter what church you belong to
[1:17:29] it doesn't matter who your supposed
[1:17:31] friends are or whatever it might be
[1:17:32] wherever you are because this is an
[1:17:34] individual affair
[1:17:35] this is an hour right now brothers and
[1:17:38] sisters we've never been more connected
[1:17:41] right with the internet and all these
[1:17:42] different things and yet we've never
[1:17:43] been so alone
[1:17:44] in a lot of ways
[1:17:46] because the devil's got us running to
[1:17:48] and fro here and there everywhere but
[1:17:50] the one thing is i'm telling you is that
[1:17:52] it is coming down it's an individual
[1:17:54] affair between you and god
[1:17:56] you and jesus christ have to meet in
[1:17:58] that in that bedroom
[1:18:00] you have to meet in the spiritual
[1:18:02] bedroom and become one that's right
[1:18:04] because you coming to
[1:18:05] higher ground tabernacle ain't enough
[1:18:08] that's right it ain't enough it's a good
[1:18:10] start
[1:18:11] it's a good start you're fulfilling the
[1:18:12] word of god by being here that's right
[1:18:15] yes sir but it's time this is uniting
[1:18:17] time
[1:18:18] this is where christ and his bride are
[1:18:21] meeting in that closet amen and and by
[1:18:23] bride i'm not talking about the
[1:18:25] collective here
[1:18:26] this comes down to individuals
[1:18:28] you and god
[1:18:30] every from littlest to oldest from
[1:18:32] youngest oldest it doesn't matter it's
[1:18:34] between you and
[1:18:38] god and it's all by grace you know i was
[1:18:44] i was we were driving down the road
[1:18:46] this was uh probably like a month month
[1:18:48] and a half ago
[1:18:49] and i had a lot of things on my mind at
[1:18:51] the time
[1:18:52] and we were driving back from a
[1:18:53] chiropractor appointment and we were
[1:18:55] sitting at a stoplight
[1:18:56] and i looked and i saw
[1:18:58] one of those big road signs that have
[1:19:00] like the orange letters you know that
[1:19:02] have the the lights the orange lights
[1:19:04] that make the letters and they put like
[1:19:05] the road traffic conditions and stuff on
[1:19:07] there
[1:19:08] and i looked up and i just been really
[1:19:09] praying like lord i really i really you
[1:19:11] know i just you know need more of the
[1:19:14] lord me more of the holy ghost just more
[1:19:16] him
[1:19:17] and
[1:19:18] just had some different things on my on
[1:19:19] my heart
[1:19:20] and i looked up and i saw it and it had
[1:19:23] uh it just said test test
[1:19:26] and just something struck me when i saw
[1:19:28] that
[1:19:29] and and surely you know maybe there's a
[1:19:31] guy that was doing a test on the board i
[1:19:32] don't know but there was something that
[1:19:33] i knew that was for me
[1:19:35] and i thought oh my
[1:19:37] i was going through a modern mind
[1:19:38] battles at the time about some certain
[1:19:40] things and said oh dear here we go
[1:19:42] oh my god
[1:19:44] and i it didn't i wouldn't it didn't
[1:19:46] discourage me but it certainly made me
[1:19:48] wary you know you start oh my here we go
[1:19:50] looking around every corner where's the
[1:19:52] test test
[1:19:53] and i kind of was meditating on that and
[1:19:55] i was i was just rejoicing because i
[1:19:57] said lord i know you showed that to me
[1:19:58] for a purpose
[1:19:59] so i'm i'm believing you know for
[1:20:01] everybody and i don't know if that's
[1:20:02] already happened or if it's to come it
[1:20:04] doesn't matter because the scripture
[1:20:05] says you know when the enemy comes in
[1:20:07] like a flood the spirit of god will
[1:20:08] raise up the state
[1:20:10] so i don't i don't fear those things but
[1:20:12] the lord really blessed me in it because
[1:20:13] i started meditating i said lord test
[1:20:15] test that's you know i thought i started
[1:20:17] thinking about daniel yeah yeah and
[1:20:18] daniel said man they may take a little
[1:20:20] farce and he said because it said many
[1:20:21] twice he said the thing is so sure that
[1:20:23] it's gonna happen i said oh my this me
[1:20:25] that test is coming
[1:20:26] and i and but something spoke to me
[1:20:28] later i think it was later the day or
[1:20:30] the next day and all of a sudden i
[1:20:31] started i was just kind of thinking and
[1:20:33] and the lord brought it to my heart and
[1:20:35] said but the capstone came down crying
[1:20:37] grace great
[1:20:38] i said praise the lord i said there's
[1:20:40] grace grace
[1:20:41] for the test test
[1:20:43] he always covers it for me by the grace
[1:20:45] of god
[1:20:46] but i joined thinking about those things
[1:20:48] and brothers and sisters there isn't
[1:20:50] you know jesus had to tell peter he said
[1:20:53] satan has desired to sift you like wheat
[1:20:56] he said but i prayed for you amen amen i
[1:20:59] prayed for you
[1:21:01] he prayed for me
[1:21:03] he prayed for you
[1:21:04] and i say thank the lord i was there
[1:21:06] when he prayed for peter i was in it
[1:21:08] when i was in him he was praying for me
[1:21:11] because right now is that shifting time
[1:21:13] if we haven't seen a sifting time like
[1:21:15] anything we've ever seen i mean there's
[1:21:17] there's the spiritual bats there's the
[1:21:20] natural bats there's your covet stuff
[1:21:22] there's your government stuff there's
[1:21:23] your family stuff there's your every
[1:21:26] other thing you can imagine is just
[1:21:28] piling on
[1:21:31] but it's got to be grace
[1:21:34] you can't do it no
[1:21:36] you can't do it
[1:21:38] and i believe at least for me i know for
[1:21:41] me i i won't speak for anybody else
[1:21:42] because it's an individual affair but i
[1:21:44] know what the lord tell speaks to me
[1:21:46] is
[1:21:47] the failures that you're going through
[1:21:49] right now
[1:21:50] the battles that you're fighting right
[1:21:51] now that sometimes you seem to come up
[1:21:52] short are all to prove to you that it's
[1:21:54] not about your ability
[1:21:56] it was never about your ability
[1:21:59] because because sarah remember sarah
[1:22:01] being a type of that bride
[1:22:04] she was promised to receive seed
[1:22:07] she she was she was given a promise
[1:22:09] through abraham now remember she didn't
[1:22:12] receive the promise directly she
[1:22:13] received it through her husband
[1:22:15] i received the promise through jesus
[1:22:16] christ
[1:22:18] but it wasn't remember brother branham
[1:22:20] said that when sarah laughed at the
[1:22:22] promise
[1:22:24] i can tell you right now there's been
[1:22:25] times i've laughed at the promise
[1:22:27] i've looked at myself in the mirror
[1:22:29] and i'm talk i'm not talking about the
[1:22:30] natural meaning i'm talking about the
[1:22:31] mirror of god's word and sometimes you
[1:22:33] see your own reflection instead of
[1:22:34] seeing his
[1:22:35] and when you see your own reflection you
[1:22:37] kind of hold lord there is sometimes and
[1:22:39] i i this doesn't sound sacrilegious but
[1:22:41] i'm just being honest
[1:22:42] sometimes you you could you what is it
[1:22:44] that devil tries to get you in that
[1:22:45] carnal mindset
[1:22:47] get you out of the grace of god
[1:22:49] and into like what into what you can
[1:22:51] accomplish you say lord there is no way
[1:22:55] you laughed at the promise of god
[1:22:57] i have i don't know about you i have
[1:23:00] but the but the grace of god
[1:23:02] he would have slayed us a long time ago
[1:23:05] he would have slayed me a long time ago
[1:23:07] but the promise was never dependent upon
[1:23:09] my ability that's right that's true
[1:23:11] because
[1:23:12] when he made you the promise
[1:23:14] if he turned his back on you now
[1:23:18] i'll tell you what your prophet said
[1:23:20] he wouldn't be god that's right because
[1:23:22] he can't change his mind about his word
[1:23:24] and remain god
[1:23:26] so when he gave me the promise
[1:23:29] i say lord
[1:23:31] all i can cling to is you can't lie
[1:23:34] you promised amen that's what i'm
[1:23:37] relying upon
[1:23:38] i know it sounds so simple
[1:23:40] but right now
[1:23:42] all i know for me is my flaws have been
[1:23:45] magnified lately
[1:23:46] everywhere you go it's a it's a it's pr
[1:23:48] remember it's that letting off the
[1:23:50] pressure time
[1:23:51] the pressure the pressure the pressure
[1:23:52] you know we talk about the squeeze to
[1:23:54] squeeze the squeeze the squeeze is
[1:23:56] happening right now
[1:23:57] if you don't feel the spiritual pressure
[1:24:00] then you probably haven't crossed over
[1:24:01] jordan yet and entered the back
[1:24:03] because you don't fight until you cross
[1:24:05] doors that's right and i tell you right
[1:24:07] now that spiritual pressure is building
[1:24:10] that spiritual pressure is on all sides
[1:24:15] forgive me i probably shouldn't even say
[1:24:16] but i just think i was thinking uh
[1:24:18] sister kim had me had us bring our
[1:24:20] instant pot it just made me think of
[1:24:21] pressure cookers we've never thought
[1:24:22] about pressure cookers for years
[1:24:23] pressure cookers are back in style now
[1:24:25] you know why because we're in a pressure
[1:24:27] cooker it's that we're this is the time
[1:24:30] where god is letting that devil put that
[1:24:32] pressure on you because you know what it
[1:24:34] takes to mold something it takes
[1:24:37] pressure
[1:24:39] that sandpaper is rubbing
[1:24:42] that iron is sharpening eye
[1:24:45] the the the hammer the master's hammer
[1:24:48] is hammering away at you by the word
[1:24:50] knocking off the big piece
[1:24:52] and then when he's got the big pieces
[1:24:53] knocked off then the you thought that
[1:24:55] was bad
[1:24:57] he laughed off a piece here he locked
[1:24:59] off a piece there but you know where it
[1:25:01] really gets down to the nitty-gritty
[1:25:03] when he pulls out that 300 grit
[1:25:05] sandpaper and starts to rub it why
[1:25:07] because that's where it lasts a long
[1:25:10] time the pain lasts a while
[1:25:12] the pain and it doesn't seem like the
[1:25:14] gains seem to be that much
[1:25:17] it doesn't seem like great things are
[1:25:19] happening but that's where the master is
[1:25:22] taking all those fine details that he
[1:25:24] wants to see in your life and he's going
[1:25:26] to manifest those details
[1:25:27] he's taken the grit of this world and
[1:25:30] he's putting that sandpaper the word on
[1:25:32] you and he's molding you he's revving it
[1:25:35] but what does it do sometimes it takes a
[1:25:36] little grit
[1:25:37] it takes some water
[1:25:39] you ever seen him do those things with
[1:25:40] stones remember you're a lively stone
[1:25:43] that he's forming into his image amen
[1:25:45] they've had when they when they polish
[1:25:47] those stones
[1:25:48] they take that real fine grit sandpaper
[1:25:50] and then what do they do they put it
[1:25:51] under the water
[1:25:53] they put it under the water of that word
[1:25:55] and he tries to rub it oh my it hurts
[1:25:58] he's rubbing that that sandpaper on you
[1:26:01] that word but what is he doing he's
[1:26:03] getting all those burrs off he's getting
[1:26:05] all those little pristine prices away
[1:26:07] from you he's getting all those little
[1:26:09] five details
[1:26:11] see once you thought no you know what
[1:26:13] years ago oh yeah they're smoking and
[1:26:14] drinking and all those things it's
[1:26:16] pretty obvious now you stayed away from
[1:26:18] that but then maybe something you
[1:26:20] thought was okay to let go for a while
[1:26:23] now all of a sudden the lord shines a
[1:26:24] spotlight on
[1:26:26] he puts the sandpaper down and starts
[1:26:27] rubbing and all of a sudden you kind of
[1:26:30] oh there's something inside you that
[1:26:32] i used to kind of like that i thought it
[1:26:33] was
[1:26:34] acceptable but now it just doesn't seem
[1:26:37] like it's edifying to the lord anymore i
[1:26:38] gotta get rid of it
[1:26:40] and you start to think why
[1:26:42] why why can't i just kind of take it
[1:26:44] easy and go about my life everybody else
[1:26:47] seems so free
[1:26:48] but i'm a prisoner of christ
[1:26:50] there's something in me that that wants
[1:26:53] in every little detail to please my
[1:26:55] husband
[1:26:57] amen
[1:27:00] he wants he's looking for a bride
[1:27:02] that is completely submissive to the
[1:27:05] husband
[1:27:07] he is not going to have
[1:27:10] a bride
[1:27:13] that's contentious
[1:27:15] he's not going to have a bride
[1:27:17] that gets her own way
[1:27:19] he's not going to have a bride that
[1:27:20] argues with him about what he wants done
[1:27:22] he is going to have
[1:27:24] a bride that is humble and submissive
[1:27:28] and his very least desire is our
[1:27:30] greatest desire
[1:27:32] oh see paul said he said speaking about
[1:27:35] husbands and wives he said this is a
[1:27:37] great mystery
[1:27:38] he said but i speak concerning christ in
[1:27:39] the church see we take all of those
[1:27:42] natural things and we sometimes laser
[1:27:44] focus in the natural oh husbands love
[1:27:46] your wives as christ will let the church
[1:27:48] wives submit yourself to your husbands
[1:27:50] and everything that it's pleasing unto
[1:27:52] the lord and those things are true even
[1:27:54] in the natural but let's take it deeper
[1:27:56] than that you you are the bride of
[1:27:58] christ if you be the bride of christ
[1:28:01] then wives
[1:28:03] submit yourselves to your husband amen
[1:28:06] in all things
[1:28:08] and one thing about that husband and you
[1:28:10] can assure he'll never tell you to do
[1:28:12] something against the word
[1:28:15] i may mess up and do something wrong and
[1:28:17] my wife would have have a right to say
[1:28:19] i'm not doing that it's against the word
[1:28:21] but i this husband my husband jesus
[1:28:23] christ he is the word he'll never ask
[1:28:26] you to do something outside that word
[1:28:28] and he'll never ask me to do something
[1:28:30] that he didn't already do himself
[1:28:32] and they'll never ask me to do something
[1:28:34] that he didn't already do for me
[1:28:40] oh we got to do these works and we got
[1:28:42] to do this and i've got to i've got to
[1:28:44] do this and that everything that you've
[1:28:46] done
[1:28:47] he did for you
[1:28:49] he just blesses you with the grace to be
[1:28:51] there when it happened
[1:28:54] he blessed you to be a vessel that he
[1:28:56] could work through
[1:28:58] but paul said he said what did you have
[1:29:01] what do you have
[1:29:02] that you did not receive
[1:29:05] what do you have that you didn't receive
[1:29:08] where could we get any boasting from
[1:29:11] people want to even even thinking about
[1:29:13] oh i want to do these works i want to
[1:29:14] have these rewards i'm going to lay it
[1:29:16] all down to his feet anyway
[1:29:18] because he did it for me
[1:29:20] oh you maybe you could go in the message
[1:29:22] and find quotes where he talks about
[1:29:23] this and that and this and that oh
[1:29:25] that's fine i don't care if that's to me
[1:29:27] that's even still carnal yeah because i
[1:29:29] i just want to see him hey
[1:29:31] you know what my reward is going to be
[1:29:32] seeing him
[1:29:34] being with him being out of this old
[1:29:36] flash this pest house being reunited
[1:29:38] with the loved ones that went before
[1:29:40] being able to rejoice without fear or
[1:29:43] thoughts of any anything no devil ever
[1:29:45] hindering you ever again
[1:29:49] but we get so caught up in ourselves
[1:29:53] but he's looking for a bride that's
[1:29:54] going to be so surrendered to him
[1:29:57] you know in the book i think i was
[1:29:58] sharing this with brother brooks maybe a
[1:30:00] few weeks ago
[1:30:02] and the lord just really revealed this
[1:30:04] in a special way to me we know in the
[1:30:06] book of proverbs
[1:30:07] solomon talks about that contentious
[1:30:09] wife
[1:30:10] he said it's better to dwell on the
[1:30:11] corner of the
[1:30:12] corner of the rooftop
[1:30:13] than than to be with a brawling woman
[1:30:16] you know he's not just talking about the
[1:30:18] natural wife and husband relationship
[1:30:21] if you were wondering why the lord seems
[1:30:23] distant from you well maybe you should
[1:30:25] check your nature are you a brawling
[1:30:27] wife to to the lord
[1:30:29] if he doesn't seem so close to you
[1:30:31] what's been your attitude towards him
[1:30:33] have we been softened the way we ought
[1:30:35] to because this world is doing
[1:30:36] everything it can to harden
[1:30:40] it is doing everything it can to
[1:30:41] desensitize you
[1:30:43] everywhere you look is evil
[1:30:47] you need to almost be a hermit
[1:30:50] to get away from it
[1:30:52] and i'm trying to be more of that
[1:30:55] by his grace oh you say well that's
[1:30:57] crazy brother you know i want to please
[1:30:59] him
[1:30:59] [Applause]
[1:31:01] i want what enters my eyes to please him
[1:31:03] i want one enters my ears to please it i
[1:31:06] want what what i'm what i'm surrounded
[1:31:08] by to please him
[1:31:09] because enoch had this testimony that he
[1:31:12] walked with god he pleased god amen it's
[1:31:15] that simple
[1:31:17] well i'm going to do this and i'm going
[1:31:19] to do that it may be so i i believe
[1:31:22] that the lord can you know the lord will
[1:31:23] work miracles through every one of us i
[1:31:25] pray that it be the case
[1:31:27] but the only miracle i'll tell you what
[1:31:29] the only miracle i'm living for is that
[1:31:30] body change
[1:31:32] that's the only miracle i'm living for
[1:31:35] everybody else can build what they want
[1:31:36] to build
[1:31:38] everybody else can do what they want to
[1:31:39] do
[1:31:40] as long as he vindicates that word by
[1:31:42] bringing it to pass in me i'll be all
[1:31:44] right
[1:31:45] because i don't i don't care about
[1:31:46] myself i'm a useless individual if it
[1:31:49] wasn't for him i'd be nothing but a dung
[1:31:51] hill
[1:31:53] we get so pumped up by the talk of being
[1:31:55] bride
[1:31:58] there's a message he preached of
[1:31:59] choosing of a bride
[1:32:01] you did not choose me
[1:32:03] but i have chosen you
[1:32:06] praise me to the living god
[1:32:08] for his choosing
[1:32:10] why because when you can look at me and
[1:32:11] say
[1:32:12] god was crazy to choose you i could say
[1:32:14] that may be true but he did it anyhow
[1:32:16] and you can't change it
[1:32:18] and i won't change it amen
[1:32:21] i ain't gonna try to change his mind
[1:32:23] about me
[1:32:24] i feel like sometimes i'm trying
[1:32:28] moses tried to do it
[1:32:30] tried to change god's mind about himself
[1:32:33] so but i can't speak i can't do this i
[1:32:35] can't do that that's all right he's
[1:32:37] going to get you there anyhow
[1:32:38] he's looking for a bride see the problem
[1:32:42] is
[1:32:43] we've got this idea of well we've
[1:32:44] received the word so we've got this we
[1:32:46] have this and i see it different places
[1:32:49] where people just have this
[1:32:50] this kind of mentality of well we're
[1:32:53] going to go out and do this great thing
[1:32:55] and to my mind it's kind of it's a
[1:32:56] denominational mentality
[1:32:58] because what it is is trying to force
[1:33:00] the word of god into this box that he
[1:33:02] didn't create
[1:33:05] but what he wants is complete submission
[1:33:08] to the word
[1:33:09] because it's only that full obedience to
[1:33:11] the word and so
[1:33:13] maybe just we'll go real quickly here we
[1:33:15] don't want to it's probably late already
[1:33:17] lord have mercy but we'll just go a
[1:33:19] little bit farther matthew
[1:33:20] 8 and we'll read verse 3 verse 5 through
[1:33:23] 10 again we talk about that centurion
[1:33:26] he said he goes into capernaum and we
[1:33:28] understand the story the centurion says
[1:33:30] my servant is sick and tormented he said
[1:33:33] i'll come and heal him he said i'm not
[1:33:34] even worthy that thou should have come
[1:33:36] under my roof but speak the word only my
[1:33:38] servant shall be healed he said for i am
[1:33:40] a man under authority having soldiers
[1:33:42] unto me now i want you to catch this
[1:33:45] he did what did he say he said he said
[1:33:47] i'm a man of authority no he did not say
[1:33:49] i'm a man of authority
[1:33:50] he said i'm a man under authority
[1:33:54] i'm a man under authority
[1:33:57] there is a revelation that this
[1:33:58] centurion had
[1:34:01] that put him in a place where he could
[1:34:02] have such a faith
[1:34:04] in the grace of god that he didn't even
[1:34:07] need
[1:34:08] the what we would call the presence of
[1:34:10] god to be there because he knew
[1:34:12] what authority was
[1:34:14] he said i'm a man under authority he
[1:34:17] didn't say i'm a man of authority
[1:34:20] i'm a man under authority so there's
[1:34:22] something that happens this centurion
[1:34:24] understood that there is something that
[1:34:27] happens when a person comes under
[1:34:30] authority
[1:34:33] there is something that happens to the
[1:34:36] bride when she comes underneath the
[1:34:38] headship of her husband
[1:34:39] when she comes fully under the headship
[1:34:41] of her
[1:34:43] because you see as long as you're
[1:34:44] outside of that
[1:34:46] there's nothing that can be done for you
[1:34:48] because you've eliminated the authority
[1:34:51] over you
[1:34:53] because it's only the authority over you
[1:34:56] that gives you authority under
[1:34:58] you hallelujah that centurion understood
[1:35:01] why because the centurion he said i'm a
[1:35:04] man under authority whose authority was
[1:35:05] he under
[1:35:06] caesar
[1:35:07] and he understood because caesar had
[1:35:11] appointed him to this position
[1:35:14] he could tell this servant you go over
[1:35:15] here and he'll do it
[1:35:17] because he was under caesar he could say
[1:35:20] you go do this and he would do it
[1:35:23] and so because he had that revelation he
[1:35:26] could say because
[1:35:27] thou jesus the son of god
[1:35:30] are under the authority of god
[1:35:32] right right the son of god under the
[1:35:34] authority of god
[1:35:36] i don't even need you to do anything but
[1:35:37] say the word amen he said because i know
[1:35:40] that all of heaven backs you amen
[1:35:43] if i
[1:35:44] a man under caesar
[1:35:47] can have authority simply by being under
[1:35:50] the authority of caesar
[1:35:51] how much more
[1:35:53] would christ have authority being under
[1:35:55] the headship of god because remember the
[1:35:57] scripture said every the head of the
[1:35:59] woman is man and the head of the man is
[1:36:02] christ and the head of christ is god
[1:36:03] amen
[1:36:04] so if he's underneath the headship
[1:36:07] what if it was that much of authority to
[1:36:10] be had there
[1:36:12] then what is it for the bride
[1:36:14] if you could come under authority of
[1:36:16] this word in this house if you could
[1:36:18] come under the authority it's not about
[1:36:21] i will do this i'm gonna go do this
[1:36:23] because i've received the word so i've
[1:36:24] got power i can do this and i can do
[1:36:26] that i've got faith to move mountains i
[1:36:27] have this and i have that
[1:36:29] you do have it
[1:36:31] but if it's not used if it's not
[1:36:33] according to his will
[1:36:34] it profits nothing amen amen if it's
[1:36:37] outside of his world prophets nothing
[1:36:38] what would it have done david to say i
[1:36:40] desire to build a house for god
[1:36:43] and he had the ability to do it he was
[1:36:45] the king
[1:36:46] if when that prophet nathan came and
[1:36:48] said you're not going to build the house
[1:36:50] but your son
[1:36:52] and then david said but i'm the king i
[1:36:53] can do what i want because lord you gave
[1:36:55] me this authority as being the king but
[1:36:57] see david also understood being under a
[1:36:58] thorn
[1:37:00] he said lord i wouldn't have would have
[1:37:01] won for you anyway
[1:37:04] i'll follow you wherever i go
[1:37:07] so how much for us
[1:37:08] see it brings me back in mind brother
[1:37:10] brings me back to esther every time
[1:37:13] because there's something about esther
[1:37:15] when you start to see the character of
[1:37:17] esther
[1:37:18] and what she represented and how she
[1:37:20] represented this bride and how she could
[1:37:22] come to a place of being under that
[1:37:24] authority
[1:37:26] see vashtai's problem was she was not a
[1:37:29] wife under authority to her husband
[1:37:31] because when her husband called
[1:37:34] just for something simple
[1:37:36] i just want you to come
[1:37:38] and come into the the throne room so
[1:37:40] people could see how beautiful it was it
[1:37:41] was a beauty pageant for the queen could
[1:37:43] you imagine
[1:37:45] you th the king sister and said you are
[1:37:47] the most beautiful woman in the kingdom
[1:37:49] i want to show you to everybody because
[1:37:51] i'm proud to call you my wife
[1:37:54] and she just
[1:37:55] goes and has a dinner with her her girls
[1:37:58] said no i don't think so king
[1:38:00] i'll do whatever i want to do and what
[1:38:02] did this what did the servant say he
[1:38:04] said if this is noise abroad then all
[1:38:06] the women would despise their husbands
[1:38:08] in their eyes
[1:38:10] because you let it be so
[1:38:12] and so how could it be any other way in
[1:38:14] the
[1:38:14] spiritual if if we cannot come under the
[1:38:17] headship of christ
[1:38:19] see when jesus came
[1:38:21] in the flesh
[1:38:22] he was under authority
[1:38:25] he didn't come to live out moses message
[1:38:27] that's right
[1:38:29] he didn't come to live out noah's
[1:38:30] message he didn't come to live out
[1:38:32] elijah's message he didn't come to live
[1:38:34] out anything else he came only to live
[1:38:36] out what was spoken of him for his life
[1:38:40] he said i do
[1:38:42] nothing nothing
[1:38:45] but what the father showed me
[1:38:48] i do nothing
[1:38:50] is that the character of christ or is it
[1:38:52] not the character of christ
[1:38:54] if it be the character of christ
[1:38:56] is it to be our character or no yes sir
[1:38:59] amen amen i do nothing but what the
[1:39:02] father showeth me
[1:39:04] because that what the son saith the
[1:39:06] father do that do it the son likewise
[1:39:09] so if that's the character that he's
[1:39:11] bringing us to
[1:39:13] are we getting too much of a vast shy
[1:39:15] spirit
[1:39:16] when the king calls you to something
[1:39:18] simple
[1:39:20] pray for someone
[1:39:23] witness to somebody
[1:39:26] go here go there just even something
[1:39:28] simple
[1:39:31] or do we do we cast him to the side
[1:39:34] because i'll say lord you know i don't i
[1:39:36] don't think this or that or or or
[1:39:39] the best excuse because this is what the
[1:39:40] devil does to the believers
[1:39:43] well i've had a really rough day i'm
[1:39:45] just not good enough to do that
[1:39:47] you were never enough good enough to do
[1:39:48] it no matter what you did anyway
[1:39:50] it didn't matter how you could have
[1:39:52] spent five hours in prayer that morning
[1:39:54] before the lord told you to go witness
[1:39:56] to that person you still wouldn't have
[1:39:57] been good enough
[1:39:58] because it's not about you
[1:40:01] again that does see the devil will take
[1:40:03] you so far one way or the
[1:40:05] well then i don't have to pray i don't
[1:40:06] have to do nothing but the life of
[1:40:08] christ will bring those things into your
[1:40:09] eyes
[1:40:10] there's no doubt about it because the
[1:40:11] life of christ brings a character
[1:40:13] but if you're relying upon your works
[1:40:17] see that's what that's what the lord
[1:40:19] will do the lord will allow you to fall
[1:40:20] flat on your face to prove to you
[1:40:24] that your works didn't get you any
[1:40:26] closer to him
[1:40:29] i'm just i'm just telling you what it is
[1:40:31] because it's not about you it's not
[1:40:33] about your ability
[1:40:35] it's not
[1:40:36] if it was the lord wouldn't have chose a
[1:40:38] hillbilly kentuckian
[1:40:40] to bring a message for this hour
[1:40:42] if it was about ability he would have
[1:40:44] chosen a scholar he would have chosen
[1:40:46] someone who could do this or do that
[1:40:48] but he didn't
[1:40:49] he chose someone who was flawed
[1:40:52] he chose someone whether people want to
[1:40:54] believe it or not someone actually like
[1:40:56] you
[1:40:58] we've gotten to a place of of
[1:41:00] bringing
[1:41:01] people up to places where they're not
[1:41:02] supposed to be and i don't mean to say
[1:41:05] that
[1:41:06] we re we we glory
[1:41:09] before the lord for the the fact that he
[1:41:11] brought a prophet
[1:41:14] but he was a man of like passions like
[1:41:16] me
[1:41:17] and you know what encourages me is
[1:41:19] knowing that even though he could fall
[1:41:21] probably flat on his face and he's told
[1:41:23] us he he told us that in the message
[1:41:24] many times of how he would fail god
[1:41:27] and yet because his faith wasn't
[1:41:30] anchored in himself he could still
[1:41:33] get behind that pulpit and say i take
[1:41:34] every spirit under in here under my
[1:41:36] control for the glory of god why because
[1:41:38] god promised him to do that
[1:41:40] and he had enough faith in the grace of
[1:41:42] god to perform it no matter what the
[1:41:43] circumstance
[1:41:45] if it be so then without faith it's
[1:41:48] impossible to please god i know these
[1:41:49] things are really simple
[1:41:52] i've just it's so pressing on my heart
[1:41:54] brothers and sisters that we've got to
[1:41:56] come to such a place to realize that
[1:41:58] it's all about jesus christ
[1:42:02] it's all about jesus christ
[1:42:04] it's not going to be about you
[1:42:06] it never was about you
[1:42:10] it's about him
[1:42:11] and i praise the lord that he he he
[1:42:14] chose me before the foundation of the
[1:42:15] world amen
[1:42:17] that he he
[1:42:19] bestowed his grace upon me
[1:42:21] that he gave me a promise
[1:42:23] that he he brought me to a place where i
[1:42:25] could recognize that amen oh praise the
[1:42:28] lord
[1:42:30] so if we could just understand
[1:42:33] what that authority is
[1:42:35] you know brother branham told the story
[1:42:38] about that little policeman
[1:42:40] that would get out in the intersection
[1:42:41] there remember he and and
[1:42:43] you know he made it uh he made it a
[1:42:44] point
[1:42:45] to specifically talk about how this guy
[1:42:47] was a scrawny little weakling
[1:42:50] he even said in one place how his hat
[1:42:51] was kind of pulled way over down pushing
[1:42:53] his ears down because maybe his hat was
[1:42:54] too big and he was a scrawny little
[1:42:56] fella and his clothes might have been
[1:42:58] baggy
[1:42:59] what to show that it wasn't about him
[1:43:01] anyway because when he stood in that
[1:43:03] intersection and blew that whistle with
[1:43:05] that uniform
[1:43:07] he i think he said in one place he said
[1:43:09] he said that little guy might not have
[1:43:11] had enough power to stop a bicycle
[1:43:15] how many of you felt like that sometimes
[1:43:17] oh i don't feel like i could stop a
[1:43:18] bicycle
[1:43:20] but it wasn't about what his abilities
[1:43:22] were
[1:43:23] it's about who he represented
[1:43:27] and when you can know that you're in him
[1:43:30] and you know that all of heaven stands
[1:43:33] behind you if you be in this world when
[1:43:35] you come under that authority to the
[1:43:36] word
[1:43:37] there's not a devil in hell
[1:43:40] because all of heaven backs you amen
[1:43:43] that's why we could hear that when the
[1:43:45] weakest of christians gets on their
[1:43:46] knees
[1:43:47] the devil trembles
[1:43:49] why because it's not you think he
[1:43:51] trembles at the person
[1:43:52] no he trembles at what that person that
[1:43:55] christian represents
[1:43:57] because you're a representative of
[1:43:58] christ
[1:43:59] if the life of christ be in you you
[1:44:02] represent him on the earth
[1:44:05] and when the holy ghost dwells in you
[1:44:07] when that lies that very life of god
[1:44:10] that's why they could say it antioch
[1:44:12] these are christians
[1:44:13] because they represented christ there
[1:44:15] was an authority that they were under
[1:44:18] they were so much under the authority
[1:44:20] of christ
[1:44:22] to where they recognized it without even
[1:44:24] being told
[1:44:25] and they called them christians
[1:44:27] that's what i want my life to be i want
[1:44:30] my life to be so like his
[1:44:32] i want my life to be so
[1:44:34] bright if i can see it with this way so
[1:44:37] much bride of christ so much christ that
[1:44:40] i don't have to call myself pride
[1:44:44] that they'll call me brock
[1:44:47] they say why are you acting the way
[1:44:48] you're acting
[1:44:50] you're acting like you got a home that's
[1:44:51] not in this world
[1:44:53] you're acting like there's a life that's
[1:44:55] above all this other stuff
[1:44:58] because it's not about you it's not
[1:45:00] about the glory you can receive it's
[1:45:02] about the life of christ in you
[1:45:06] he wants us to come underneath that
[1:45:08] authority though you can't
[1:45:10] you cannot see power without character
[1:45:12] is satanic right
[1:45:14] that's why you see so many go off
[1:45:16] and just well i have faith to do this
[1:45:18] and they may get results
[1:45:21] they'll get results
[1:45:24] but it's satanic
[1:45:26] and they don't even know it
[1:45:27] it's a denominational spirit it's a
[1:45:29] nicolaitan spirit
[1:45:31] trying to bend
[1:45:33] the the word of god to their will
[1:45:38] you know the word obedience
[1:45:40] you look at it in the in the dictionary
[1:45:42] it says compliance with an order a
[1:45:44] request or law
[1:45:46] but i love the last part of it here it
[1:45:48] says or
[1:45:50] submission to another's authority
[1:45:53] see
[1:45:54] it's one thing
[1:45:56] to obey
[1:45:59] in one thing here and there
[1:46:02] you say well i'll just go do this and
[1:46:03] i'll just go do that
[1:46:05] the lord the lord jesus said in in the
[1:46:07] parable he said there were two he said
[1:46:08] what thank you he said there were there
[1:46:10] was a man who had two sons and the one
[1:46:12] he said go go do this and the one says
[1:46:14] i'm not gonna go
[1:46:16] and then his heart smoted him and he
[1:46:17] went and did it and then the other one
[1:46:19] said oh i'll go do it and he didn't do
[1:46:20] it he said which one did the will of the
[1:46:22] father
[1:46:25] so which one are we
[1:46:27] you know i'll be honest i'm the first
[1:46:28] one i know i'm the first one because
[1:46:30] i've done that many times the lord says
[1:46:31] go do this i said lord i can't do it
[1:46:35] and then i start to realize lord it's
[1:46:36] not about me anyway and i go i humble
[1:46:39] myself and i go do it anyhow
[1:46:41] why because it's because you start to
[1:46:43] react the devil is always putting the
[1:46:44] magnifying glass on your flesh
[1:46:48] come to a realization now brothers and
[1:46:50] sisters your flesh ain't coming with you
[1:47:00] to manifest the life of god
[1:47:03] through the flesh
[1:47:05] it's not it's not coming with you
[1:47:07] it's not coming with you so much so that
[1:47:08] the lord has to completely just get rid
[1:47:10] of it so he can give you a new body amen
[1:47:12] amen
[1:47:14] this body is death
[1:47:15] paul said who shall deliver me from the
[1:47:17] body of his death
[1:47:19] the body of this dead
[1:47:22] if paul could say the good that i would
[1:47:23] i do not
[1:47:25] but that what i don't want to do that's
[1:47:26] what i do
[1:47:28] oh wretched man that i am
[1:47:30] how many of you felt like that
[1:47:33] oh my and then when you come to a
[1:47:35] knowledge of this truth
[1:47:37] and you see
[1:47:38] you start to realize truly see when
[1:47:40] you're in denomination maybe
[1:47:43] i'll speak for at least myself
[1:47:45] you had no concept of holiness
[1:47:47] and i'm not just talking about dressing
[1:47:49] a certain way and and the carnal things
[1:47:50] that we do to manifest the holiness of
[1:47:52] god those are just carnal things anybody
[1:47:54] could any any woman could put a skirt on
[1:47:57] any per any woman could grow her hair
[1:47:58] out any man could dress in in a modest
[1:48:01] way
[1:48:03] but when you came to a revelation
[1:48:06] of the holiness of god
[1:48:08] when you understand that the angels are
[1:48:11] filthy in his sight
[1:48:13] and you start to realize as you get
[1:48:15] closer to god you remember the the story
[1:48:17] brother branham told about about the man
[1:48:19] who died
[1:48:20] and starts going towards that light he
[1:48:22] goes to the he goes to the the the gates
[1:48:25] he said we can't find your name here he
[1:48:27] said oh my
[1:48:28] gosh he said well you the only thing you
[1:48:29] do is appeal to the white throne so
[1:48:32] remember what happened he starts getting
[1:48:33] up to that light that light and as he
[1:48:35] got closer all the things that he
[1:48:37] thought were okay started to get darker
[1:48:40] all the things that thought were okay
[1:48:42] see that's what is happening to you
[1:48:44] right now that's why you feel so filthy
[1:48:47] sometimes because the lord is starting
[1:48:49] the the bar is getting high while the
[1:48:51] world is drawing that bar lower and
[1:48:52] lower and lower
[1:48:54] this bar that we're going to brothers
[1:48:55] and sisters he's bringing us higher he's
[1:48:57] bringing us higher he's it's a higher
[1:48:59] ground tabernacle i love it because he's
[1:49:02] bringing us
[1:49:04] higher than we've ever been
[1:49:06] he's bringing us farther than we've ever
[1:49:08] gone
[1:49:10] and and you don't feel like it brothers
[1:49:12] and sisters you don't but there's a
[1:49:13] reason why you despise yourselves
[1:49:16] it's because you're starting to realize
[1:49:18] that this flesh is complete abomination
[1:49:22] to god
[1:49:23] his flesh is useless
[1:49:26] without him a man without the holy ghost
[1:49:28] is a brute beast
[1:49:32] it's a truth
[1:49:34] it's only the grace of god you know what
[1:49:35] the you know what the amazing thing
[1:49:37] about the holy ghost is though
[1:49:39] is that the holy ghost
[1:49:41] and the grace of god in the blood of
[1:49:43] jesus christ can so
[1:49:45] cover you
[1:49:47] until even this filthy nasty disgusting
[1:49:50] wicked flesh
[1:49:52] is so out of the sight of god that he
[1:49:54] can manifest his life in you
[1:49:58] talk about america
[1:50:00] talk about
[1:50:01] running through a troop
[1:50:03] talk about leaping over a wall
[1:50:06] that is a miracle
[1:50:08] when you have a desire to live for god
[1:50:10] and god's god the very life of christ is
[1:50:13] being expressed in your life
[1:50:16] when the divine love
[1:50:18] expresses itself when you can't help but
[1:50:20] feel a pull to pray for one another
[1:50:22] when you can't help but feel compassion
[1:50:25] on the lost souls that are out there
[1:50:27] because you you can't help with the life
[1:50:29] of the the flesh would have none of that
[1:50:32] you see what the world is going to now
[1:50:34] and how wicked and and abominable it is
[1:50:39] and the miracle that you sit here right
[1:50:42] now to listen to to uh not me but to
[1:50:45] listen to this vessel i'm nothing
[1:50:47] i'm weird to look at i got a fuzzy face
[1:50:50] i shout i scream i spit sometimes
[1:50:54] but it's not about the flesh
[1:50:58] and to think that god
[1:51:00] in this hour
[1:51:02] while satan's making his eating
[1:51:04] the lord is preparing a very eden in
[1:51:07] your heart
[1:51:09] that holy ghost brooding over you
[1:51:11] bringing you into perfection on the
[1:51:13] inner man
[1:51:14] to where we could be so dead so
[1:51:17] underneath the authority and the
[1:51:19] headship of our husband
[1:51:22] to where
[1:51:23] they become one again
[1:51:25] see in the garden of eden
[1:51:27] we saw
[1:51:29] the split
[1:51:31] but both of of the natural when god
[1:51:34] separated man male and female and then
[1:51:37] in the spiritual when man separated
[1:51:38] himself from god
[1:51:40] but in this hour is he uniting amen all
[1:51:43] the the things that had been come
[1:51:45] between christ and his bride have been
[1:51:48] cast aside
[1:51:50] if we can receive it
[1:51:51] if we could come under full
[1:51:54] headship
[1:51:55] of this word
[1:51:57] and and that's christ because christ is
[1:51:59] the word
[1:52:00] i'm not talking about just a carnal
[1:52:01] reading
[1:52:02] of the word
[1:52:04] those things are great we want to do
[1:52:05] exactly what's written in here but i'm
[1:52:07] talking about your everyday life
[1:52:09] when he calls you to prayer you pray
[1:52:11] when he calls you to sin you sing when
[1:52:13] he calls you to fast you fast people
[1:52:15] don't even think about fasting anymore
[1:52:17] people just cast it out when people
[1:52:18] don't even think about those things
[1:52:21] but god is calling us to a higher place
[1:52:24] he's calling us to a place of perfection
[1:52:27] on the inner man completely separate
[1:52:29] from yourself
[1:52:31] you can rest are you looking to yourself
[1:52:33] to your sacrifice
[1:52:38] let's all stand
[1:52:39] i won't hold you any longer i know it's
[1:52:40] already late
[1:52:44] i know it's
[1:52:46] i feel you know
[1:52:48] the lord
[1:52:51] you know it's one of those things i you
[1:52:52] know with the you know we get so busy
[1:52:54] and we don't always get a chance to come
[1:52:55] and visit as we ought to and lord
[1:52:57] willing you know if the lord allows we'd
[1:52:58] certainly love to be able to visit you
[1:53:00] more and all those things but i think
[1:53:02] you know
[1:53:05] sometimes your heart's just full and you
[1:53:06] want to spill so many things out and i
[1:53:08] feel like i've preached about 10
[1:53:09] messages in one so i apologize if it
[1:53:11] feels jumbled up but
[1:53:13] if i could say just the the the crux of
[1:53:15] all of it is
[1:53:16] the the grace of god is sufficient
[1:53:21] when paul sought the lord for that thorn
[1:53:23] in his flesh he said my grace is
[1:53:25] sufficient for thee he said my strength
[1:53:27] is made perfect
[1:53:28] [Music]
[1:53:31] this flesh is
[1:53:32] in a lot of ways getting weak in all
[1:53:34] ways really it's getting weaker and
[1:53:36] weaker
[1:53:37] we even heard it even in the natural
[1:53:39] things our food is hybrid
[1:53:41] the air we breathe is hybrid
[1:53:43] everything we intake even your water is
[1:53:45] hybrid now you don't know where your
[1:53:47] water is coming from
[1:53:49] you get a you know we know tap water is
[1:53:51] who knows what's in the tap water so you
[1:53:53] say oh i'll get bottled
[1:53:55] who knows where the bottled water is
[1:53:56] coming from
[1:53:57] and they say well they put a label on it
[1:53:59] they have to tell us what's in there
[1:54:00] come on like everybody actually tells
[1:54:02] you what's in their stuff i mean let's
[1:54:03] just be honest
[1:54:05] man the love of money is the root of all
[1:54:07] evil
[1:54:08] and there that almighty dollar is
[1:54:10] calling to them they're going to tell
[1:54:12] you it's reverse osmosis blessed by the
[1:54:15] the mountain filters of of the granite
[1:54:17] and filtered through 500 layers of soil
[1:54:20] and it's got the himalayan salts and
[1:54:22] it's got a perfectly ph balanced and or
[1:54:25] it's or it's gonna do this over here
[1:54:27] it's i know they got the smart water now
[1:54:28] it's gonna the smart one
[1:54:31] the only reason i say there's nothing
[1:54:32] wrong with those things you drink all
[1:54:34] the smart what do you want to or
[1:54:35] whatever you want you there's nothing
[1:54:36] wrong with those things but the point is
[1:54:39] the flesh is dying
[1:54:41] it's hybrid
[1:54:43] it doesn't matter what you do
[1:54:45] it doesn't matter the scripture says
[1:54:47] they'll get weaker but wiser so your
[1:54:50] flesh is getting weaker all the time
[1:54:52] every day it's getting weak
[1:54:56] but his strength is made perfect
[1:54:59] because when you can come to a perfect
[1:55:01] realization of your weakness
[1:55:03] then you can come to a perfect
[1:55:04] realization of how he is strong
[1:55:07] when i'm weak
[1:55:11] i want to live in the the grace of god
[1:55:15] lord give me your grace lord jesus give
[1:55:17] me your grace
[1:55:19] i don't want your law
[1:55:21] i don't want to make this message of law
[1:55:23] i don't want to make this word a law i
[1:55:25] don't want to make anything that we've
[1:55:26] heard any of those things i want to do
[1:55:28] everything that he's told me to do
[1:55:30] don't get me wrong we don't turn grace
[1:55:33] into disgrace all those things
[1:55:36] but there there is a path right down the
[1:55:38] middle
[1:55:39] that we have been called to take
[1:55:42] and i'm looking to the grace of god
[1:55:44] to see me through
[1:55:46] because i know i can't do it
[1:55:48] but i know he promised me that he that
[1:55:50] begun a good work in me is faithful to
[1:55:52] complete it
[1:55:56] this is power has some prayer
[1:55:59] heavenly father lord lord jesus
[1:56:03] lord certainly
[1:56:05] in the natural feel like a jumbled up
[1:56:07] sermon lord but
[1:56:09] lord i feel as though i've just
[1:56:10] delivered the burden that was on my
[1:56:12] heart for the people
[1:56:14] [Music]
[1:56:16] lord i know
[1:56:17] [Music]
[1:56:19] that in my life in the life of everyone
[1:56:21] here father
[1:56:23] that it's only by your grace that we
[1:56:24] stand
[1:56:26] it's only by the blood
[1:56:28] of the lord jesus christ
[1:56:32] by the power of the holy ghost lord that
[1:56:34] gives us grace
[1:56:35] that we're standing here this evening
[1:56:39] lord i know i can't do anything
[1:56:44] lord no doubt i've tried many many times
[1:56:47] to do different things and
[1:56:49] see the shipwrecks that it brings oh god
[1:56:51] when you try to put your hand to it
[1:56:54] you end up messing everything up father
[1:56:56] but if we could just get ourselves
[1:56:57] [Music]
[1:57:00] lord let you do the leading
[1:57:02] come under your authority your headship
[1:57:04] father your head the headship of this
[1:57:06] bird

[1:57:09] or that you could we know that you could
[1:57:11] speak to us every single day
[1:57:14] lord that lord we expect the great
[1:57:16] things lord i believe
[1:57:18] lord in missing limbs being restored
[1:57:21] lord i believe
[1:57:23] in speaking in tongues and the gifts of
[1:57:24] the holy spirit in the church
[1:57:27] lord i want to see all that i want to
[1:57:28] see it in my life will come
[1:57:31] but lord i also want to see i don't want
[1:57:33] to despise the day of small things
[1:57:36] lord and i can rejoice that lord forgive
[1:57:39] me
[1:57:40] and be here this evening that you've
[1:57:42] given your sons and your daughters grace
[1:57:44] to come lord in a cold rainy night
[1:57:47] in a november in iowa when it's 40
[1:57:49] degrees and
[1:57:50] rainy and cold
[1:57:52] know that but they would press
[1:57:53] themselves out to the house of god
[1:57:56] lord to hear your word
[1:58:00] lord i know that you reward them father
[1:58:02] i know that lord god you're drawing us
[1:58:04] closer to you father that we've heard
[1:58:06] your word lord that we're receiving it
[1:58:08] with willing hearts of god
[1:58:10] lord may you just
[1:58:12] manifest yourself through us lord to to
[1:58:15] the world oh god
[1:58:17] lord may we just look to the simplicity
[1:58:20] of the gospel in our lives
[1:58:24] lord help us to be just simple
[1:58:27] child-like faith believers of god
[1:58:31] lord that you would
[1:58:32] give us revelation oh god but let us
[1:58:34] just be humble and simple
[1:58:38] lord i just want to be humble lord i
[1:58:39] just want to be simple i just want to be
[1:58:41] meek and lowly before you lord jesus
[1:58:44] lord because you said
[1:58:46] he that exalts himself would be a base
[1:58:48] lord but if you've humbled himself
[1:58:50] you'll be exalted in due time
[1:58:52] lord and i'm not even looking
[1:58:53] necessarily to be exalted oh god and i
[1:58:55] don't believe your people are either but
[1:58:56] oh god it would be just enough oh god
[1:58:59] just
[1:58:59] on that day to see your face oh god to
[1:59:02] be
[1:59:03] one with you once again oh god to be in
[1:59:05] your presence lord of the weddings
[1:59:06] [Music]
[1:59:09] lord i just pray right now that you
[1:59:11] bless your people
[1:59:13] lord may your angels just in camp about
[1:59:15] that may just put a hedge of protection
[1:59:17] about the lord as we each go our
[1:59:18] separate ways lord to fight the battles
[1:59:21] that we have to fight lord wherever we
[1:59:23] may go god but knowing that you also
[1:59:25] gave us a promise that we would possess
[1:59:27] the gates of our enemies
[1:59:30] lord we're standing upon your promise
[1:59:32] lord we're trusting in you we're
[1:59:34] trusting oh god
[1:59:35] in your word
[1:59:37] lord and i just think about how europe
[1:59:39] even your apostle paul lord
[1:59:42] even said lord that the life that he
[1:59:44] lived he didn't even live by his own
[1:59:45] faith but he lived by the faith of the
[1:59:47] son of god
[1:59:48] lord we're not even relying on my own
[1:59:50] faith oh god i'm relying on you
[1:59:53] lord we just commit all this into your
[1:59:54] hands lord may you just bless your
[1:59:56] people bless the pastor lord brother
[1:59:58] brooks the precious friend and all the
[2:00:00] different ones that are here oh god we
[2:00:02] just pray that you'd bless them in a
[2:00:03] special way oh god
[2:00:05] we just commit them now into your hands
[2:00:07] lord in the name of the lord
[2:00:09] [Music]
[2:00:16] if you desire prayer we'll pray with you
[2:00:20] you know the lord said
[2:00:21] that if you lay hands on the sick they
[2:00:23] shall recover said the prayer of faith
[2:00:25] shall save the sick and god shall raise
[2:00:26] him up
[2:00:27] and i love it because the lord seems
[2:00:29] that he he loves to give even compound
[2:00:31] promises he said he said and even if
[2:00:33] they forgive if they've committed sin
[2:00:34] they'll be forgiven
[2:00:36] oh i thank the lord for his promises
[2:00:38] if
