[45:38] i'm sorry today if you will hear his
[45:41] voice
[45:43] harden on your heart as in the
[45:47] provocation
[45:48] and as in the day of temptation in the
[45:51] wilderness
[45:56] amen may be seated this morning we will
[46:00] uh speak about the subject that
[46:03] we entitled god's certain sounds
[46:15] because if you read throughout the
[46:17] entire bible
[46:20] you will see that every time that god
[46:22] said something
[46:24] you know that thing came to
[46:27] you know every time a promise came out
[46:29] of the god's mouth
[46:32] you know that promise had to come to
[46:34] pass
[46:35] and we see here in the world we do have
[46:37] many sounds we have different sounds
[46:41] you know we have sounds that make people
[46:43] crazy
[46:46] you know we have sounds that make people
[46:48] sing
[46:49] you know we makes we have sounds that
[46:51] make people worship the devil
[46:55] you know we have sound that makes us you
[46:57] know feel like praying
[46:58] yeah there's something you know we have
[47:01] sounds you know that that that gives us
[47:03] faith yeah these songs are called the
[47:05] fourth you know it's like in the time of
[47:06] uh of
[47:07] the three hebrews children you know the
[47:10] king told them
[47:11] at the you know when they will hear the
[47:13] sound of the trumpet
[47:14] of all when did we hear the sound of all
[47:16] instruments
[47:19] you know they have to go bow down and
[47:21] and and worship
[47:23] the statue
[47:26] you know it was under a certain sound
[47:28] that there was you know that would lead
[47:30] that was about to lead them to
[47:32] worship and if this morning
[47:37] you know if this morning we will be able
[47:39] to listen to the sound of god
[47:43] you know to listen to the certain sound
[47:45] of god
[47:46] you know i believe that you know mighty
[47:48] things will happen
[47:51] you know i believe that we'll find a
[47:52] solution to all our problems
[47:55] you know because we say in the bible you
[47:58] know when jesus was on earth
[48:00] you know people didn't know who it was
[48:02] you know people
[48:03] saw him how he was born you know he they
[48:06] saw him in
[48:07] mary's house in joseph you know people
[48:10] didn't believe that jesus was actually
[48:13] god
[48:14] you know people didn't believe that
[48:15] jesus was the son of god
[48:18] you know they saw him walking and you
[48:20] know dealing with
[48:21] woods and and playing his other children
[48:24] you know
[48:24] they they they saw him as a normal
[48:26] person
[48:28] you know about one day john the baptist
[48:31] was able to turn into a child and to
[48:34] tune into a channel
[48:36] you know and then he heard the sound
[48:40] you know from heaven saying that this is
[48:42] the son this is my son
[48:44] you know this is my beloved son and hear
[48:48] him you know he heard the sound that was
[48:51] different from the other sounds
[48:53] you know he heard a sound that other
[48:55] people didn't hear
[48:58] you know why because you know god gave
[49:00] him a grace to turn into tune into that
[49:02] channel
[49:05] you know we have so many sounds today
[49:08] you know we see the example of abraham
[49:11] you know abraham heard the sound of
[49:13] faith
[49:14] you know he heard the sound he heard the
[49:16] sound of a promise
[49:18] you know god told him at this time i
[49:20] will come and visit you
[49:22] you know i will give you a son you know
[49:24] abraham was marketed you know people
[49:26] didn't believe him you know people
[49:29] thought abraham probably
[49:30] you probably were dreaming you heard
[49:33] somebody talking to you about why it's
[49:35] it was nobody talking
[49:37] about abraham knew the type of sound
[49:40] that he listened
[49:42] that he was listening to me you know
[49:44] abraham knew
[49:45] who said who promised who promised him
[49:49] you know abraham was able to look you
[49:51] know mighty long way
[49:52] how the lord brought him out of his
[49:54] father's his father's house
[50:10] and he believed that that sound was a
[50:12] certain sound
[50:13] you know he didn't have any doubt saying
[50:15] that you know he might be the lord or
[50:17] not
[50:18] you know he believed in him that that
[50:20] sound was a certain sound
[50:22] you know we see joe joe had you know you
[50:25] read the bible
[50:26] i mean you knew the word of god
[50:29] you knew that god was always meeting
[50:31] people under the blood
[50:34] and when his children you know went out
[50:36] in the scene
[50:38] you know he went and he gave a sacrifice
[50:41] and when you know then when the devil
[50:44] comes he was now attacking him
[50:47] you know people was treating job as a
[50:49] secret sinner
[50:51] you know people were saying that job
[51:00] your daughters or your sons you know
[51:02] went somewhere and they did something
[51:03] that is wrong
[51:05] you know that is why the lord is cursing
[51:06] you you know job
[51:08] knew job knew you know where he was
[51:11] standing
[51:12] you know job knew that that he heard the
[51:15] sound of god
[51:17] of the the the almighty god who meets
[51:19] people under the blood
[51:22] and he knew that he was offering he was
[51:24] giving the sacrifice every night
[51:29] you know that it was that was not unfair
[51:31] in vain
[51:33] you know that god one day will remember
[51:35] it you know that's why you know joe
[51:37] could have could stood well you know
[51:38] with boldness who stands with boldness
[51:41] you know saying that you know even
[51:43] though the warmth you know ate this body
[51:46] you know i know that my redeemer lives
[51:52] you know one day all the things that i'm
[51:54] seeing right now
[51:55] you know i won't be able to see them
[51:57] because i i was able to hear that
[52:00] certain sound
[52:02] you know i was i was able to hear that
[52:04] certain sound that was
[52:05] clear and i believe in it you know job
[52:08] didn't say that you know
[52:09] maybe the lord will you know maybe the
[52:12] lord will leave or
[52:13] maybe my redeemer leave again
[52:19] you know when somebody say i know that
[52:20] means he has faith
[52:23] you know he has experienced it
[52:26] you know that's why he can stand up and
[52:28] before people in front of people and say
[52:29] that i know that one day the lord will
[52:31] rise up again
[52:35] and we see that at the end at the end of
[52:37] the day the lord the lord came to his
[52:39] rescue
[52:40] you know we see the children of israel

[54:30] you know they didn't have any tools to
[54:32] break through that'd be pointless but
[54:34] what the hell
[54:35] you know they had the trust and they
[54:37] they only trust god
[54:40] you know they trusted god you know they
[54:42] saw that god has brought them a long way
[54:46] you know they saw how god has delivered
[54:48] them from the children
[54:49] from the the egyptians
[55:05] you know joshua heard the same sound
[55:07] that moses was here
[55:09] you know that i will be with you
[55:12] that i will be with you and i will never
[55:15] leave you
[55:16] and when that obstacle came before you
[55:19] know he remembered the voice of god
[55:21] you know he remembered the word of god
[55:24] you know that promised him joshua that i
[55:26] will always be with you
[55:27] and i will never forsake you and today
[55:30] you know if
[55:31] before us there's the wall of jericho
[55:34] you know you don't know where to go
[55:36] you don't know how to break through you
[55:38] know you just have to remember that void
[55:40] that that word you know you just have to
[55:42] remember that word that said i will
[55:44] always be with you
[55:46] and i will you know you have you have
[55:48] always to have that in your mind
[55:51] because that word is a certain sound you
[55:53] know it's a sound from the lord
[55:56] you know the prophet says that god never
[55:58] gives a sound that is uncertain
[56:22] you know always you know when you
[56:23] promise that thing will always come to
[56:25] pass
[56:29] you know what was the sound of joshua
[56:32] you know
[56:32] they heard the sound of faith the sound
[56:34] of victory
[56:36] you know the sound of your faith the
[56:38] sound of victory
[56:39] you know that was able to break that
[56:41] wall
[56:48] you know when they they're going through
[56:49] hard times and and trials
[56:53] you know instead of instead of singing
[56:55] you know and praising
[56:57] you know we see people singing the blues
[57:01] you know they sing the blues you know
[57:03] they they start to complain
[57:06] you know they start to complain and ask
[57:08] questions you know why
[57:10] why you know why why this is only why
[57:13] this is only coming to me
[57:15] you know what have i done to you know to
[57:16] have this
[57:18] you know but you have to sing your blues
[57:20] away
[57:24] you know you have to sing it away you
[57:26] know you have to stop praising god
[57:29] and remember that everything is for a
[57:31] purpose
[57:32] you know that god you know everything
[57:34] that he is bringing you through right
[57:36] now has a purpose
[57:51] you know it seems like nothing is going
[57:53] on or nothing is working
[57:55] you know you know you have to stop so
[57:57] you don't have to sing the blues
[58:02] you know you don't have to start
[58:04] complaining
[58:05] you know you just have faith in god no
[58:08] you just believe in his word
[58:11] and he will see you through
[58:15] you know the bible says in first
[58:17] corinthians chapter 14 verse 8.
[58:22] first corinthians chapter 14 verse 8 the
[58:24] bible says
[58:39] uh first corinthians chapter 14 verse 8.
[58:44] the bible says that for if the trumpet
[58:47] given uncertain sound
[58:54] you know if the sound that the trumpet
[58:56] is given is not certain
[58:58] it's not clear
[59:03] how are you going to get yourself ready
[59:05] for the battle
[59:07] you know because we have to remember
[59:08] that back in the days you know where it
[59:10] uh been in the days of old
[59:12] don le jour you know and when people
[59:16] the soldiers were going to war
[59:19] you know they were led under the sound
[59:21] of the trumpet
[59:24] and and and and those sound of the
[59:26] trumpet was like a words or
[59:28] or a signs for them to do to do
[59:31] specific things
[59:35] you know if the trumpet sounded like
[59:37] this and you know
[59:38] in this specific way
[59:43] you know it means that you have to go
[59:45] and fight
[59:47] you know if it sounds you know the other
[59:49] way
[59:51] you know it meant that you know you have
[59:53] to go you you have to uh to run
[59:56] or you have to hide you know but for
[59:58] them to understand
[1:00:00] that sound comprehension you know they
[1:00:02] had to be trained
[1:00:04] for me you know they had to go through a
[1:00:06] training
[1:00:08] for me and then to be able to understand
[1:00:10] you know every
[1:00:11] specific you know those different sounds
[1:00:18] you know and this is the same thing with
[1:00:19] us you know as
[1:00:21] christian the prophet says that when
[1:00:22] we're born again
[1:00:25] you know we are in the bottom
[1:00:34] you know we have a master you know who
[1:00:37] gives us
[1:00:37] sounds you know who gives us the sound
[1:00:40] of the trumpet
[1:00:48] you know you have to be trained in a
[1:00:50] certain way for you to be able to
[1:00:52] understand
[1:00:53] each different sounds that it gives you
[1:00:58] you know you have to be trained in a
[1:01:00] certain way to know that you know if
[1:01:02] if i'm going through these trials and
[1:01:05] and god says that he will never leave me
[1:01:07] and he will be with me and you say amen
[1:01:23] a trumpet gives an uncertain sound
[1:01:26] paragraph 102. it's it says that now
[1:01:30] paul said in the scriptures
[1:01:34] like training a soldier come for me
[1:01:50] if he doesn't know uh uh uh he doesn't
[1:01:53] know
[1:01:54] if the trumpet go or blows
[1:02:01] you know he will not know you know where
[1:02:03] whether to charge
[1:02:04] or to retreat
[1:02:08] [Music]
[1:02:10] you know if he doesn't know the
[1:02:11] difference
[1:02:13] you know what kind of a mixed up army
[1:02:16] would you have
[1:02:17] john darmian the enemy was certainly
[1:02:21] triumph over
[1:02:22] a bunch of soldiers that were no better
[1:02:25] terrain
[1:02:26] than that
[1:02:31] for me that's that's what's the mother
[1:02:34] uh
[1:02:34] the the mother with the church with the
[1:02:36] churches today
[1:02:38] with our churches today we train them
[1:02:42] we train them on creeds for me
[1:02:50] [Music]
[1:03:00] you know then which is which is uh then
[1:03:02] which is the trumpet
[1:03:04] they say the gospel trumpet it is
[1:03:08] that's it the word of the living god is
[1:03:10] the trumpet
[1:03:12] don't mix nothing with it no no
[1:03:15] you know don't have somebody play with
[1:03:17] with a friend with a french uh don't
[1:03:19] don't have somebody play a french harp
[1:03:25] and the other and the other when the
[1:03:26] other one blow a boot
[1:03:28] embargo
[1:03:39] you know the prophet here is saying that
[1:03:40] the church has to be trained
[1:03:42] you know into that specific sound of the
[1:03:44] truth
[1:03:48] you know to be able to listen to what
[1:03:50] god says
[1:03:52] you know to forget about the creeds you
[1:03:55] know to forget about what other people
[1:03:57] are saying
[1:03:59] you know to forget about what they know
[1:04:02] but to focus on what god is saying
[1:04:06] you know to focus on what god is saying
[1:04:09] on the sound of the trumpet from
[1:04:24] christian soldier
[1:04:52] heavens
[1:05:08] that's the sound i want to hear oh you
[1:05:11] say
[1:05:11] how do i know jesus said my sheep know
[1:05:15] my voice you know my ship hear my sound
[1:05:19] they know my trumpet
[1:05:35] and if a man says well hebrews
[1:05:39] hebrews 13 8 says
[1:05:43] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[1:05:45] and forever
[1:05:48] oh they say
[1:06:03] and and that didn't sound right
[1:06:07] that must have been a french horn
[1:06:11] that wasn't a trump trump because the
[1:06:14] bible gives no
[1:06:15] uncertain sounds now the question is
[1:06:18] that how are you going to know that this
[1:06:20] is
[1:06:20] an uncertain sound and so this is the
[1:06:22] sound from god
[1:06:25] you know it takes some training for
[1:06:27] information
[1:06:28] you know you have to go through the
[1:06:30] training
[1:06:34] you know that training will perf well
[1:06:36] perfect you're here
[1:06:39] and when you hear the word of god
[1:06:42] you know you will be able to unders to
[1:06:45] see that this is god
[1:06:49] and and then that thing that helps us to
[1:06:50] know the word of god
[1:06:53] there's the holy spirit you know because
[1:06:55] the prophet i was reading i think
[1:06:57] yesterday or the day
[1:06:58] before yesterday you know the prophet
[1:07:02] was saying that you know
[1:07:03] people usually people nowadays you know
[1:07:05] they're basically
[1:07:07] they base their their faith on the
[1:07:08] fruits of the spirit
[1:07:10] that's done for them if we do this you
[1:07:12] know it's good to have the food of the
[1:07:13] spirit i mean
[1:07:14] i mean it's the fruit of the spirits are
[1:07:16] good
[1:07:17] only but we don't have to base we but we
[1:07:20] don't have to be based on that to say
[1:07:22] that we don't have the holy spirit
[1:07:26] you know he gave the example of the
[1:07:27] priest and jesus
[1:07:30] you know the priest showed all the fruit
[1:07:32] of the spirit
[1:07:36] you know when people were sick the
[1:07:37] priest went to them we went to visit
[1:07:39] them
[1:07:41] you know when when the people were
[1:07:43] hungry the priests give gave them
[1:07:45] food you know white white people
[1:07:48] needed people somebody to comfort them
[1:07:50] the priests
[1:07:51] were there
[1:07:55] you know when they needed money to
[1:07:56] preach the priest led them to to go
[1:07:58] and sell things to church in church
[1:08:02] but here it comes in jesus name
[1:08:06] you know he saw people selling a
[1:08:08] trillion you know been in the temple
[1:08:10] you know he kicked them out you know he
[1:08:13] was treated as a weak
[1:08:14] as wicked you know he
[1:08:18] he saw the fig tree he cursed it
[1:08:22] you know and it did everything that was
[1:08:24] contrary you know from where
[1:08:26] from what the priest was to what we're
[1:08:28] doing
[1:08:31] so now if if just by the you know if the
[1:08:34] priest
[1:08:35] if people base their their faith on the
[1:08:37] priest on the fruits of the spirit
[1:08:39] you know saying that they have the holy
[1:08:41] spirit because of that
[1:08:51] the if the foreign had the fruit of the
[1:08:52] spirit
[1:08:54] you know but they denied the word of god
[1:08:57] they denied the manifestation that the
[1:09:00] word of god manifested in their time
[1:09:03] you know and the prophet goes and says
[1:09:06] and he said that the evidence of the
[1:09:07] holy spirit
[1:09:10] is some ways to believe in your in the
[1:09:12] word of god
[1:09:13] you know to your heart to believe in a
[1:09:15] hundred percent of this word
[1:09:17] and when you have the holy spirit inside
[1:09:19] of you you know that holy spirit will
[1:09:22] help you she sent this people you know
[1:09:24] to know that this is the sound from god
[1:09:26] and this is a certain sound and this is
[1:09:28] not a certain sound
[1:09:30] because remember the bible says
[1:09:33] you know that in the in the end time
[1:09:36] you know there will come people but you
[1:09:38] know the spirit of antichrist will be so
[1:09:40] close to the spirit of the truth
[1:09:43] only the elected one will will not we
[1:09:46] will not follow it
[1:09:50] you know how wide the elected one will
[1:09:52] be able to recognize the sound of the of
[1:09:55] the of the antichrist
[1:09:59] [Music]
[1:10:01] because inside of them they do have the
[1:10:03] holy spirit
[1:10:05] because inside of them they do have the
[1:10:07] word of god
[1:10:09] and when the word of god meets the word
[1:10:11] of god
[1:10:13] you know it says amen to it and if the
[1:10:16] word of god doesn't mean and he says
[1:10:18] that
[1:10:18] this is something there's something
[1:10:19] wrong with this
[1:10:23] you know that we said that this sound is
[1:10:24] uncertain it's not a certain sound
[1:10:28] you know god's promise never failed the
[1:10:29] promises
[1:10:31] you know he promised that he would
[1:10:32] deliver the children of israel
[1:10:35] you know after after 40 years
[1:10:40] you know that promise came to pass you
[1:10:42] know he promised his son to abraham
[1:10:47] you know and abraham finally got a song
[1:10:51] you know he swore that he would raise up
[1:10:54] he raised up david
[1:11:06] you know he promised that he would send
[1:11:08] john the baptist
[1:11:10] you know before the coming of jesus
[1:11:12] christ you know that promise
[1:11:14] that promise came to pass you know he
[1:11:17] promised that he would send us messiah
[1:11:22] you know he promised the world will get
[1:11:24] into the great group of organizations
[1:11:31] and make a system a formula system you
[1:11:34] know and no
[1:11:35] and and no the system or a power no as
[1:11:38] the
[1:11:38] the
[1:11:42] and we'll be up there setting us uh
[1:11:45] setting on seven hills
[1:11:49] and he did it just like that you know
[1:11:51] how the church will be pers
[1:11:53] he promised how the church will be
[1:11:54] persecuting
[1:11:56] how the church will be persecuting them
[1:12:05] you know he did exactly that you know
[1:12:08] how they come to how they came
[1:12:10] how they they come out in the
[1:12:12] reformation
[1:12:15] and they did exactly that you know any
[1:12:18] promise for this age
[1:12:20] and
[1:12:34] is fulfilled you know death is swallowed
[1:12:38] up in victory
[1:12:43] and the last one is vindicated
[1:12:47] then there will come an eternal peace
[1:12:50] upon the earth
[1:12:55] and eternal shalom peace will rest upon
[1:12:58] the earth
[1:13:00] you know when jesus came
[1:13:14] you know he is fulfilling the word today
[1:13:18] but when all of this word what about but
[1:13:21] when
[1:13:22] all of his promised word
[1:13:26] you know which was the thought of god
[1:13:29] thought means expressed
[1:13:33] you know god's thinking he's thinking
[1:13:39] you know and expressed it through his
[1:13:41] prophets
[1:13:43] and now he has to be fulfilled
[1:13:47] you know now he promised he promised to
[1:13:49] send christ
[1:13:50] the second time
[1:13:54] and whenever and whenever he does
[1:13:59] when christ comes the second time
[1:14:02] there will be an eternal shalom you know
[1:14:05] god's promise never never
[1:14:06] never god's promise never failed you
[1:14:09] know throughout the entire
[1:14:10] bible you know god promised us that you
[1:14:14] know god promised the people god
[1:14:15] promised his people good things
[1:14:18] you know but those things came to pass
[1:14:20] it shows
[1:14:22] you know it's he promised the children
[1:14:23] of israel that he will always be with
[1:14:25] him
[1:14:33] it was impossible for them to overcome
[1:14:36] you know they just remembered about the
[1:14:38] word of god
[1:14:40] you know they remembering everything
[1:14:41] that moses says told them
[1:14:45] and then they they you know their faith
[1:14:47] was built up
[1:14:50] and god came to their rescue and god has
[1:14:53] many promises for us
[1:14:56] you know the bible has many promises for
[1:14:57] us you know if we read in psalms chapter
[1:15:00] 55
[1:15:01] you know verse 22 we'll see some
[1:15:02] promises of god
[1:15:08] you know psalms chapter 55 verse 22.
[1:15:13] you know when you're in doubt you know
[1:15:16] when you think that you know
[1:15:17] i can't i can't you know i i can't carry
[1:15:20] this weight
[1:15:22] you know here is god's promise cast thy
[1:15:26] burden upon the lord
[1:15:31] it shall never suffer that the rock just
[1:15:33] to be moved
[1:15:36] you know when you feel down and
[1:15:37] condemned
[1:15:40] you know there's a promise of god for
[1:15:41] you you know in romans chapter 8 verse 3
[1:15:45] verse 3 31 to 39.
[1:15:48] you know when you feel so condemned you
[1:15:51] know you think that your sin is so
[1:15:53] big that god can never forgive you
[1:15:57] you know you think that you have done
[1:15:59] something that you know that cannot be
[1:16:01] you know forgiven you know here is the
[1:16:04] promise of god foreign
[1:16:06] what shall we then say to these things
[1:16:09] if god be for us who can be against us
[1:16:18] but deliberately
[1:16:21] how shall he not with him also freely
[1:16:24] give
[1:16:24] us things
[1:16:29] you know verse 30 verse 33 said who
[1:16:31] shall lay anything
[1:16:33] to the charge of god's elect
[1:16:36] it is god that justifies you who is he
[1:16:40] that condemned
[1:16:42] it is christ that died yeah
[1:16:45] rather jumpers there
[1:17:11] you know as it is written for the sake
[1:17:19] but we are accounting as sheep for the
[1:17:22] slaughter
[1:17:23] we are accounted as cheap for slaughter
[1:17:27] in all these things we are more than
[1:17:31] conquerors
[1:17:32] through him that loved us for i am
[1:17:35] persuaded
[1:17:36] that neither death nor life
[1:17:40] no angels no principalities no
[1:17:51] you know when you feel so condemned you
[1:17:54] know god has a promise for you
[1:17:56] you know he says that he takes care of
[1:17:58] you you know when you feel so condemned
[1:18:00] then
[1:18:01] your sin is so big you know god is
[1:18:03] inviting us
[1:18:05] you know to come to that meeting you
[1:18:07] know when you feel that god is so
[1:18:09] too far you know
[1:18:24] you know god's promise for you you know
[1:18:27] you take those promises
[1:18:29] and if you believe in those promises you
[1:18:31] know you will see a change in your life
[1:18:34] you know you will see that you know your
[1:18:35] life will change
[1:18:37] you know because god's promise never
[1:18:39] fails you know the prophet says that
[1:18:41] but when he gets in the right swing of
[1:18:44] it
[1:18:46] and the right spirit of it
[1:18:50] how are you going to do it until the
[1:18:52] spirit comes down
[1:18:56] you know the spirit of the composer
[1:18:59] compositor
[1:19:00] then when you say the days of miracles
[1:19:02] it never passed
[1:19:03] yeah the symphony cries out amen
[1:19:13] when we hit
[1:19:16] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:19:18] and forever
[1:19:25] you shall receive power after the holy
[1:19:27] spirit after the holy ghost is is come
[1:19:29] up
[1:19:30] upon you the symphony cries out christ
[1:19:34] amen
[1:19:48] oh it's magnificent similar for you
[1:19:51] the director and the composer
[1:19:55] must be in the same spirit and so must
[1:19:58] the musician

[1:34:37] doing the dead walk
[1:34:40] you know walking you know around the
[1:34:42] same thing
[1:34:45] but he just needed to hear a sound
[1:34:50] you know a voice of god you know
[1:34:53] that could have told him to trust in him
[1:34:56] you know to trust him you know to
[1:34:59] forsake all of his
[1:35:00] knowledge and to put his trust in him

[1:35:48] there is all kinds of sounds
[1:35:50] but god also do have a sound and this
[1:35:53] sound is the only sound that is certain
[1:35:58] and the sound is is that he will not
[1:36:01] rest
[1:36:02] until he finishes the plane of
[1:36:05] redemption
[1:36:06] you know his sound is you know he
[1:36:37] you know like the prodigal son you know
[1:36:40] he had
[1:36:40] sounds coming up he had sounds you know
[1:36:43] playing in his head
[1:36:45] saying that he will be rejected by his
[1:36:46] father
[1:36:48] you know if he's saying that his father
[1:36:50] will never we never welcome him back
[1:36:53] and now he was getting ready to take the
[1:36:55] place of a servant
[1:36:58] but his father had a different sound
[1:37:02] you know his father had a different
[1:37:04] sound and when he heard that sound
[1:37:08] you know that sound made him feel like
[1:37:09] it made him feel like a son

[1:37:18] you know god has a different sound for
[1:37:19] you you know god has a specific sound
[1:37:22] for you
[1:37:23] you know and if you can only trust in
[1:37:25] him you know in closing the prophet says
[1:37:29] don't break the rhythm
[1:37:32] if
[1:37:46] why did this happen because you see our
[1:37:48] evil i tried it brother
[1:37:50] and when they turned me out but uh
[1:37:53] and and went and when they turned me out
[1:37:58] you know that i was down i
[1:38:16] and what junction it's got to make
[1:38:20] it yes sir
[1:38:23] before it's written he knows all about
[1:38:25] it
[1:38:27] he knows the rhythm
[1:38:36] [Music]
[1:38:42] in
[1:39:10] in the
[1:39:24] write on
[1:39:49] you know god has said the rhythm before
[1:39:51] the foundation of the world
[1:40:05] you know they try to change the rhythm
[1:40:07] by bringing creeds and
[1:40:09] and and all kinds of beliefs
[1:40:13] you know they they try to present it to
[1:40:15] people in different
[1:40:17] ways you know with different
[1:40:20] notes
[1:40:31] you know the same god of genesis is the
[1:40:33] same god of revelations
[1:40:36] you know what it did in genesis is the
[1:40:38] same thing that he's doing
[1:40:42] if you can only if you can only keep
[1:40:44] that rhythm
[1:40:47] you will see the same result you know if
[1:40:50] you can only keep the rhythm as
[1:40:52] as abraham kept tears
[1:40:58] you will see the same result you know if
[1:41:02] you keep the rhythm as noah kept the
[1:41:03] rhythm
[1:41:06] god god gave him a sound a message
[1:41:10] of the earth that was going to be
[1:41:12] destroyed
[1:41:14] by him he will be saved only if he
[1:41:17] builds the ark
[1:41:20] and noah followed that rhythm
[1:41:24] and him and his family was saved you
[1:41:27] know god gave the rhythm to the children
[1:41:28] of israel
[1:41:30] why did
[1:41:45] passed by them you know the defense did
[1:41:48] not care
[1:41:49] [Music]
[1:41:51] and here is the same thing that same
[1:41:54] death angel is passing
[1:41:57] you know it might not be it might not be
[1:41:58] it's
[1:42:04] you know it's passing killing people
[1:42:08] but the rhythm is still the same
[1:42:11] if you apply the blood
[1:42:23] you know god promised you things you
[1:42:25] know you go
[1:42:26] you go and you go walk and and believe
[1:42:29] it
[1:42:32] you know you do as the children of
[1:42:33] israel did effect
[1:42:35] you know they believed they trusted what
[1:42:37] joshua had told them
[1:42:40] you know
[1:43:08] you know he gave his word to the prophet
[1:43:11] and the prophet now gave the word to us
[1:43:13] you know he transmitted god's word to us
[1:43:18] and that word is true and if we can only
[1:43:22] keep the wisdom you know we'll see the
[1:43:24] same result
[1:43:26] as all the saints have seen come to this
[1:43:29] you know we'll see the same results
[1:43:31] and what the result that you want to
[1:43:33] hear
[1:43:35] you know you want to hear one day that
[1:43:36] jesus tells you that he tells you
[1:43:40] you know you know a true and faithful
[1:43:43] servant
[1:43:45] because you did exactly what what i've
[1:43:47] told you
[1:43:49] you know the reason that you want to
[1:43:50] hear you know it's that one day that
[1:43:53] jesus tells you something well done
[1:43:57] you know that that's that's that's
[1:43:58] that's the result that you want to hear
[1:44:01] the result of god you know if you keep
[1:44:04] that rhythm
[1:44:05] you know there is a lot of promises you
[1:44:08] know you just keep the rhythm of god
[1:44:11] you know you just believe you know it
[1:44:13] gets hard sometimes as the prophet says
[1:44:17] you know for sure trouble will come
[1:44:20] you know sometimes you know you will
[1:44:21] think that you can't overcome it
[1:44:26] it's something true that you can never
[1:44:27] overcome it by yourself
[1:44:32] you know that's why that's why the
[1:44:33] prophet says that we don't need power
[1:44:37] no because god already overcome overcome
[1:44:40] it
[1:44:40] for us you know you just need the
