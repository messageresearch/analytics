[0:00] blood now flows through my veins and I
[0:08] who was wretched and fine now can see
[0:16] praise God praise God I'm a child of the
[0:25] king amen
[0:28] how many believe that this morning that
[0:31] we are children of the Most High God
[0:33] hallelujah how many are happy to be in
[0:35] the house of the Lord this morning amen
[0:38] you know whether Eagles are gathered
[0:42] that's where the carcass is a man the
[0:44] fresh Word of God each and every day
[0:46] hallelujah
[0:47] it never gets old fresh manna each and
[0:49] every day a man whilst we are standing
[0:52] let us open our Bibles to Ephesians
[0:55] chapter 1 verse 4
[1:18] according as he had chosen us in him
[1:21] before the foundation of the world that
[1:24] we should be holy and without blame
[1:27] before him in love having predestinated
[1:31] us unto the adoption of children by
[1:34] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[1:38] good pleasure of his will
[1:39] amen he predestinated us before he even
[1:44] formed the world the prophet of God
[1:46] tells us that we were in his bad part of
[1:49] his mind and we were just made manifest
[1:52] in this day a man
[1:54] let us open to Jeremiah 1 and verse
[1:58] Jeremiah chapter 1 verse 4
[2:11] then the word of the Lord came unto me
[2:14] saying before I formed thee in the belly
[2:17] I knew thee and before thou camest forth
[2:20] out of the womb I sanctified thee and I
[2:23] ordained thee a prophet unto the nations
[2:26] amen but the Lord had blessing to the
[2:29] reading of his hair worried we might
[2:30] take our seats I want to speak on the
[2:38] subject realization of our true identity
[2:43] a man here when we were reading in
[2:47] Ephesians the fourth the first the first
[2:51] chapter he says having predestinated us
[2:54] unto the adoption of children by Jesus
[2:56] Christ to himself according to the good
[3:00] pleasure of his will and the previous
[3:03] verse a is according as he had chosen us
[3:06] in him before the foundation of the
[3:09] world so we were predestinated and the
[3:13] word predestinated means determined
[3:16] beforehand before anything happened you
[3:20] knew you know the answer already
[3:22] hallelujah and when we read in Jeremiah
[3:25] God was telling Jeremiah that before you
[3:28] were formed in your mother's womb I knew
[3:31] thee so before Jeremiah was even born
[3:34] before he was conceived in his mother's
[3:37] womb God already knew him hallelujah it
[3:41] gives us so great a joy to know that
[3:44] before we even came to this earth God
[3:46] had already thought of us he knew we
[3:49] were coming to this earth so whatever we
[3:52] need for this life we know he has
[3:54] provided for us whatever we need for
[3:57] this Christian journey we know he has
[3:59] given it unto us a man because he has
[4:02] predestinated us so it doesn't matter
[4:05] where you think you come from or your
[4:07] background or anything you just have to
[4:10] look at what God says about you amen
[4:13] what he's thought about you are because
[4:16] that's where we came from hallelujah I
[4:18] want to read another scripture in judges
[4:21] chapter 6 from Vesey 11 to 12
[4:32] it reads and Israel was greatly
[4:36] impoverished because of the media night
[4:38] and the children of Israel cried unto
[4:41] the Lord and it came to pass when the
[4:44] children of Israel cried unto the Lord
[4:46] that the Lord of that the Lord sent a
[4:52] prophet unto the children of Israel we
[4:54] said unto them that say the Lord of
[4:57] that's a the Lord God of Israel I
[5:00] brought you up from Egypt and brought
[5:02] you forth out of the house of bondage
[5:06] I go to verse 11 and there came an angel
[5:11] of the Lord and set under an oak which
[5:14] was in offer that pertain unto Jewish
[5:17] they ibiza right and his son Gideon
[5:21] thrashed wheat by the winepress to hide
[5:24] it from the Midianites we see here that
[5:27] the children of Israel were under
[5:29] bondage from the Midianites they will
[5:33] farm their produce but soon after the
[5:36] harvest the median eyes will just come
[5:38] and get it from them and then take all
[5:41] there they are hard labor and the
[5:44] children of Israel ended up suffering
[5:46] and they were in hunger because they
[5:48] were being troubled by the children of
[5:51] Israel the children of the the
[5:53] Midianites but now God knew he saw that
[5:57] it was high time that that should stop
[5:59] and we go to verse 12 he says and the
[6:03] angel of the Lord appeared unto him this
[6:06] was Gideon in the previous verse and
[6:08] said unto Him the Lord is with thee thou
[6:11] mighty man of Valor hallelujah so we see
[6:15] Gideon thought he was a farmer he was
[6:19] there in the winepress
[6:20] he had never we don't hear of any
[6:24] history of him going to war we don't
[6:27] have any history of him being a soldier
[6:29] or in the army but here God comes to him
[6:32] and says thou art mighty man of Valor
[6:35] God was revealing to him his true
[6:38] identity
[6:39] his real identity that you are not
[6:41] supposed to be there
[6:42] wailing giddy on you're not supposed to
[6:44] be there hiding away from the Midianites
[6:47] you are supposed to go up and go fight
[6:49] because I made you a mighty man of Valor
[6:51] hallelujah
[6:52] so when Gideon realized his true
[6:55] identity he came he led the children of
[6:59] Israel and he delivered them hallelujah
[7:01] we all know the story he delivered the
[7:03] children of Israel with 300 men only and
[7:06] the Midianites were defeated and God
[7:09] brought victory to the children of
[7:11] Israel through Gideon because it is a
[7:14] man who had realized his true identity
[7:16] hallelujah so he does not matter your
[7:20] past does not determine your identity
[7:23] your past does not determine your
[7:26] destiny hallelujah whatever God says you
[7:29] are that's what you are
[7:30] hallelujah that's what you are supposed
[7:33] to take as your identity not what you
[7:36] think about yourself not what the people
[7:38] around you your environment or
[7:41] circumstances say about you but what God
[7:43] says about you that's your true identity
[7:46] hallelujah
[7:47] so we pray to God this morning that he
[7:50] reveals to us what our identity is we
[7:54] look at David David was was the least in
[7:59] his family we know when the when when
[8:02] the prophet Samuel went to anoint when
[8:05] he was told that he was supposed to
[8:06] anoint the King in the from the house of
[8:09] Jesse he asked the the he asked David's
[8:12] father
[8:13] for for his sons to come to you and all
[8:17] the seven sons came to and Jesse said
[8:21] well then probably he is not there he
[8:24] wasn't even thinking of David so his own
[8:28] father was looking down upon him but God
[8:31] before the foundation of the world he
[8:34] knew that David was supposed to be king
[8:36] he was a shepherd boy he never even went
[8:39] to training we know old David's brothers
[8:43] where were soldiers they were trained in
[8:46] the army and they were in insults army
[8:49] they're fighting the Philistines but
[8:51] David wasn't even there he was
[8:53] even considered he was in the backside
[8:55] of the desert with sheep taking care of
[9:00] sheep and we know there was there was a
[9:02] low job in those days that's what was
[9:05] given to him they said no you you are
[9:06] the youngest useless boy you know you go
[9:10] do that then
[9:11] the man went to war but God didn't see
[9:15] it like that God had ordained him before
[9:20] the foundation of the world that he was
[9:22] supposed to be king hallelujah because
[9:24] he himself he knew his son was going to
[9:26] come and he was going to be the son of
[9:28] David hallelujah amen
[9:31] so we realized that David when he was in
[9:34] the backside of the desert he was just
[9:37] doing his job he didn't know why he was
[9:39] doing but God was preparing him for what
[9:42] he was coming up to you he was preparing
[9:45] him and his eye for his identity for
[9:47] here he really was and we see at first
[9:51] he killed a bear when he tried to come
[9:53] for his arm for some of the sheep and
[9:56] then he thought he was just doing his
[9:59] job
[9:59] but God was preparing him for you for a
[10:03] greater task next comes a lion that
[10:06] comes to try and divor one of his uh
[10:08] sheep the lamps and then he slayed it
[10:12] with a sling he thought he was just
[10:14] protecting the Sheep he thought he was
[10:17] just doing his job but he was building
[10:21] his credentials as a beastslayer
[10:24] because we know the beasts of the fields
[10:26] he had killed a bear a beast of the
[10:29] field next he killed a lion a beast of
[10:32] the field so he was building his
[10:34] credentials after that he knew he knew
[10:37] he was a beast Slayer he slayed all the
[10:40] beasts that would try to come and divor
[10:41] his lambs amen and now when it was high
[10:44] time he was sent by his father to go
[10:47] with food to his brothers in the army
[10:50] then he went with the with the food
[10:53] after he was done when he was heading
[10:55] out he had a voice in the valley and he
[10:59] said what who is defying the name of the
[11:02] Living God and they started telling him
[11:05] the story about this
[11:07] beast called Goliath that's what we use
[11:10] in the modern in the modern terms right
[11:12] somebody who's huge and big and we're
[11:14] told he was a giant so David said we
[11:18] cannot let a man defy the name of the
[11:21] Living God and he remembered that while
[11:25] she was in the backside of the desert
[11:27] he was slaying beasts and this was no
[11:30] different because God had pulled him
[11:32] through it he knew he could pull him
[11:34] through this one amen
[11:36] so it wasn't you it was when he saw
[11:39] Goliath it was just another Beast amen
[11:42] if we read your Bible carefully says he
[11:45] ran towards Goliath he didn't walk
[11:48] because he knew it was a show of victory
[11:51] he realized his true identity his
[11:55] identity was a beasts lair so he went in
[11:58] and he slayed Goliath he had no doubt he
[12:02] was going to get that victory amen
[12:04] because he knew of his credentials he
[12:07] knew of his identity a beasts lair amen
[12:10] so there is no reason why we cannot
[12:13] overcome trials in our lives when you
[12:16] see one trial come your way God has
[12:19] given us the power to go through it God
[12:21] has given us the power to overcome it
[12:24] because it will be preparing you for the
[12:26] next bigger trial that is coming
[12:28] hallelujah we will be building our own
[12:31] credentials to be overcomers hallelujah
[12:35] because every time you come across that
[12:37] temptation you come across a trial maybe
[12:41] a disease you have a headache you pray
[12:44] God heals you you have a stomach ache
[12:47] you pray God heals it you have cancer
[12:50] next time you have cancer you're going
[12:52] to know that my identity is that when I
[12:55] pray for things God will deliver me you
[12:58] know when I pray for diseases God will
[13:01] will make them go away and you to make
[13:04] you realize who you really are
[13:06] amen so every time you come across a
[13:10] trial a temptation know that God has
[13:12] ordained it for you to to overcome it
[13:15] because in first Corinthians we know
[13:18] Paul tells us that
[13:20] whatever trial that comes our way God
[13:23] has already opened a way for us to go to
[13:25] overcome amen
[13:26] he or he has already opened a channel
[13:28] for us to to have victory because he
[13:31] trusts us He is God you know he trusts
[13:34] us that whenever a trial comes away
[13:37] we'll overcome it because he
[13:38] predestinated us before the foundation
[13:41] of the world that we are overcomers
[13:44] so when whatever comes your way know you
[13:47] are over Korean overcome and you can go
[13:49] through it hallelujah we can also read
[13:53] about Shamgar we know he was also in the
[13:56] book of Judges he was also in the same
[14:00] situation as as Gideon and the Prophet
[14:05] talks about Shanga he he dramatizes it
[14:10] they were also in the same situation
[14:13] they would farm their produce wheat and
[14:17] after they harvest this Midianites would
[14:21] come in and then they come and take
[14:22] everything away and then sham go one day
[14:26] he was standing in there in the house he
[14:29] looked at his poor wife she was now thin
[14:32] because they were starving they were
[14:35] living under their privileges he looked
[14:38] at his son he was there starving skinny
[14:42] and probably suffering from kwashiorkor
[14:45] o because the media nights were
[14:48] troubling them whenever they would get
[14:52] their harvest the media nights would
[14:54] just come and take they were doing no
[14:56] work one day he was looking outside the
[14:59] window then he looked at his family he
[15:02] saw this was not a good situation then
[15:05] he saw the media's coming through but
[15:07] then he realized who he was he realized
[15:11] the promise that was given to his
[15:13] forefather Abraham hallelujah that they
[15:17] were a chosen generation they were a
[15:19] chosen people then he realized who he
[15:22] was he just came out he took whatever
[15:25] the closest thing there was an ox god
[15:28] which is not even a weapon and we have
[15:30] no history Derek Shamgar was a was in
[15:34] the military or that he had any military
[15:36] training he took that ox good and he
[15:38] slew all the Midianites because he
[15:43] realized who he really was so you see
[15:45] the devil many times he comes to us and
[15:48] he tries to make us forget our identity
[15:51] because so long we don't realize who we
[15:54] are he will make us to leave under our
[15:57] privileges
[15:58] he will get things trials to trouble us
[16:03] because we just don't know who we are
[16:06] that's why he keeps you from from
[16:09] knowing who you really are
[16:10] Amen if we look at our read in Joshua
[16:17] chapter 2 and this is about when the
[16:20] when the spies were sent to Jericho
[16:24] before they before they encompass did
[16:28] Joshua chapter 2:9 says this is a Rahab
[16:31] and she said unto the man I know that
[16:35] the Lord has given you the land and that
[16:38] your terror is falling upon us and that
[16:40] all the inhabitants of the land fainted
[16:43] because of you for we have heard how the
[16:47] Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea
[16:49] for you when you come out of Egypt and
[16:52] what she did unto the two kings of the
[16:54] amorite that way on the other side of
[16:56] Jordan Sehun and ark whom he utterly
[17:00] destroyed God had given the children of
[17:04] Israel this promise he said whatever
[17:06] ever you have the soul of your food
[17:08] treads that land I give to you but the
[17:11] children of Israel were scared they were
[17:13] scared to go into fight but the enemy
[17:16] was already scared of them so you see
[17:19] the devil is already more scared of you
[17:21] because the devil knows who you are
[17:23] that's why he tries to make you not know
[17:27] who you are so that he can take
[17:29] advantage of you so do not worry just
[17:35] know your true identity you keep the
[17:38] devil on his feet you keep him running
[17:40] because he is more scared of you than
[17:42] you are amen hallelujah I'll read a
[17:46] quota for the prophet of God
[17:48] say in an exposition of the seven Church
[17:50] ages says now remember this Christ is
[17:54] Christ in the true church is a
[17:57] continuation of the book of heads but
[18:02] the book of Revelation shows how that
[18:05] the Antichrist spirit will come into the
[18:07] church and defile it making it lukewarm
[18:11] former and powerless it exposes Satan
[18:15] revealing his works attempted
[18:18] destruction of God's people and the
[18:20] discrediting of God's Word right down to
[18:23] the time he is cast into the lake of
[18:25] fire
[18:26] he fights that because you see the devil
[18:30] knows his future that's why he tries to
[18:33] make you forget and not know who you are
[18:36] he finds that he cannot stand it he
[18:40] knows that if the people get the true
[18:42] revelation of the true church and what
[18:45] she is and what she stands for and that
[18:49] she can do the greater works she will be
[18:52] an invincible army hallelujah so you and
[18:55] I we have a promise we know we are
[18:58] supposed to be an invincible army but
[19:01] the devil comes to us and whispers that
[19:03] we cannot make it it tries to come and
[19:06] shows you this mistake and he says look
[19:09] at what you have done he shows you your
[19:11] past you know the devil one of the
[19:14] devil's greatest weapons is memory he
[19:17] makes you remember what you did before
[19:21] before you were saved but you see God
[19:24] does not remember seen God does not
[19:27] remember confessed sins the moment you
[19:30] confess it to God he cast it in the sea
[19:32] of forgetfulness hallelujah there are
[19:35] two things that God cannot do he cannot
[19:38] remember your sin and he cannot fail
[19:40] those are the only two gods in abilities
[19:43] amen but he see now the devil now since
[19:48] we're you man we got a memory we can
[19:50] remember our own sins and that's why the
[19:54] devil points to you when you were there
[19:57] when you are so victorious and you are
[19:59] fighting so hard you're having a good
[20:01] time
[20:01] the devil just comes to you like hey you
[20:04] remember five years ago you shouldn't be
[20:08] happy you're not a saint that's why the
[20:10] devil does to us and then you day you
[20:13] remember bleh yeah for sure I'm probably
[20:17] not gonna make it but don't listen to
[20:20] that hallelujah when he tries to show
[20:22] you when the devil tries to show you
[20:24] your past you show him his future amen
[20:27] remain remind him of his future
[20:29] hallelujah that is going to burn in the
[20:31] lake of fire so don't listen to him
[20:35] whenever he comes to you because he
[20:37] knows we're an invincible army so that's
[20:40] why he comes and tries to tell us we
[20:41] will not make it we will not make the
[20:44] rapture but it is not about our own
[20:46] ability it is because God has
[20:49] predestinated us before the foundation
[20:52] of the world so we cannot fail
[20:54] hallelujah it is already done and sealed
[20:58] God will never lose those that eye he's
[21:01] a man so you just know for sure that
[21:04] you're going to make it we are humans we
[21:06] make mistakes like Paul said I die daily
[21:09] but we know a righteous man is one when
[21:12] they fall they get up god says that he
[21:17] says that David was a man after my own
[21:19] heart but we know that David committed a
[21:22] lot of sins then how could he be a man
[21:25] after God's own heart because every time
[21:28] he fell he rose up and he kept on going
[21:31] hallelujah so don't don't despair when
[21:35] you fall down don't remain on the ground
[21:37] get up and keep on going for we are
[21:40] righteous people that's what it means
[21:43] righteous does not mean that you are
[21:45] holier than thou you don't sin we make
[21:48] mistakes but don't let those mistakes
[21:50] draw you back made those mistakes help
[21:54] you next time you think you know that
[21:57] this was I failed this last time around
[21:59] but God please give me strength so that
[22:02] next time I will go through it so that I
[22:04] will not fall into the same trap because
[22:07] we were meant to be overcome as
[22:09] hallelujah we can you can lose a war but
[22:12] you cannot you can lose a battle but you
[22:15] can
[22:15] not lose the war because the war was
[22:17] already won before Amen God already gave
[22:20] us the victory he made us overcome as
[22:23] before we were born he predestinated the
[22:26] war to be won for us so if you lose one
[22:30] war if you lose one battle don't display
[22:33] keep on going you will win the next one
[22:36] because of early we've already made it
[22:38] amen so the devil tries to keep on
[22:42] making us forget who we are he tries to
[22:46] you know to just to take us down and not
[22:49] make us remember who we are because we
[22:52] he knows that we are in trouble to him
[22:55] he knows that the moment we know who we
[22:58] are we will be at destruction to his
[23:01] kingdom amen so we gotta know who we are
[23:04] you know the woman had the world she
[23:07] thought she was a prostitute
[23:08] that's what she thought and that's what
[23:10] she was doing but before the foundation
[23:13] of the world God knew that she was a
[23:16] daughter of God after she met Jesus that
[23:20] day on the at the well and after that
[23:23] light strike on unto the seed that was
[23:26] planted before the foundation of the
[23:28] world
[23:28] and it was and it was ignited that's
[23:32] when she realized her true identity that
[23:35] she was a child of God she was a
[23:37] daughter of God and she ran off into the
[23:40] city and told everyone what she has sin
[23:42] and then her life changed it was no
[23:45] longer the same because she realized
[23:47] that she was not a prostitute but she
[23:50] was a true daughter of God a man look at
[23:53] Mary the one who had seven demons she
[23:57] came to Jesus and started um she she and
[24:01] she washed Jesus filled with her tears
[24:03] and with their hair and anointed them
[24:06] and then Jesus said your sins are
[24:08] forgiven woman all the Pharisees they
[24:11] tried to condemn Jesus for doing that
[24:13] but it was because and they wanted to
[24:16] they were pointing how evil this woman
[24:18] was and all the bad she had done but
[24:21] Jesus he is the only one who can take
[24:23] away our sins amen and he said go sin no
[24:27] more he
[24:29] made the woman realize it through
[24:31] identity and she was a faithful disciple
[24:33] you know she's one of the Mary's who
[24:35] went to to try and go to anoint the body
[24:38] of Jesus after he was buried because she
[24:41] had changed her life was changed after
[24:43] she realized her true identity amen
[24:47] we look the Prophet tells us of the
[24:50] story of aunty Jemima the the woman that
[24:58] was in a Memphis Tennessee she was there
[25:01] and she had a she had a son who had gone
[25:05] in the wrong direction and he was now
[25:08] sick and he was on the bed dying she
[25:11] couldn't she had nothing to do you know
[25:15] and she was praying to God for God to
[25:17] heal his son then she looked into the
[25:20] Bible and she saw the Shunammite woman
[25:24] and then when she looked at the Bible
[25:26] she saw herself she saw her identity she
[25:30] said that is me and she said God I see
[25:34] myself
[25:34] the picture has to be complete but way
[25:37] is the Elijah and she prayed for God to
[25:41] heal her son now that she had realized
[25:44] had true identity
[25:46] this woman she went she prayed and her
[25:50] prayer and have faith with a love for
[25:53] his boy for her son that prayer called a
[25:57] whole aeroplane that was full of people
[26:00] people we had important business
[26:03] meetings probably that we going wherever
[26:05] they were going but God prioritized this
[26:08] woman's prayer because she had realized
[26:11] the identity she looked into the Bible
[26:13] and it was like a mirror she saw herself
[26:15] she said Lord I'm the shunammite woman
[26:17] Lord way is the Elijah and her prayer
[26:21] started looking for Elijah it went
[26:24] around looking for Elijah and Elijah was
[26:26] in the plane and God said somebody has
[26:30] realized their true identity do
[26:33] something the plane has to be grounded
[26:35] the plane was grounded and the Prophet
[26:39] started walking God was talking to the
[26:41] Prophet you know say you go that
[26:42] direction
[26:43] now turn right now turn left it was the
[26:47] prayer of this woman just just a woman
[26:50] not somebody great or whoever but it was
[26:54] just as simple somebody who realized
[26:56] their true identity when they looked
[26:59] into the Bible this pray oh it was like
[27:01] it was like a radar that was directing
[27:04] the Prophet GPS it was telling now you
[27:06] got that way you got that way it was the
[27:09] faith of a woman who realize that true
[27:11] identity and the Prophet says he didn't
[27:14] even pray for the Sun he just saw the
[27:16] faith of the woman and he said you pray
[27:18] and he was just struck but the quality
[27:22] of the fate of this woman amen
[27:23] so when you realize your true identity
[27:27] God will prioritize your prayer amen
[27:30] because he says the the prayer of the
[27:33] righteous man availeth much so it is
[27:37] first class it is first preference when
[27:40] you kneel down to pray and you know who
[27:42] you are
[27:43] God will prioritize a prayer and he will
[27:46] here and not only here but he will hear
[27:48] and answer your prayer amen so we got to
[27:52] know who we are because the devil tries
[27:55] to make us forget and not to know who we
[27:58] are we look at Esther in the Bible she
[28:01] was a queen in the Jewish year King
[28:04] Ahasuerus squid and there in the kingdom
[28:07] and all had people including herself
[28:09] they were at their their lives was at
[28:13] stake
[28:14] so if this decree that Haman was trying
[28:17] to get passed was going to be passed
[28:19] that every Jew should be killed
[28:21] Esther was going to die because she was
[28:24] also a Jew but then she knew she
[28:27] realized her true identity and she said
[28:30] I am a queen I am a queen of this of
[28:33] this country and we know that in those
[28:36] days that King Ahasuerus had had
[28:39] captivated a lot of a lot of different
[28:42] nations and she realized who she was and
[28:45] she got to a point where she said it's a
[28:48] do or die if I don't go I'm going to die
[28:51] anyway but let me try to go I might die
[28:55] but I might not so
[28:57] it was a do-or-die situation and then
[28:59] she went into the king there
[29:01] surprisingly the king was so open to her
[29:05] and he said whatever you want I'll give
[29:07] unto you even half of my kingdom it is
[29:10] because she realized a true identity if
[29:12] she would have just remained timid back
[29:15] there probably in the palace she would
[29:18] have been killed but now because she
[29:21] realized her true identity she ended up
[29:23] destroying her enemy ended up destroying
[29:25] himself because somebody realized their
[29:29] true identity you see now we the devil
[29:34] makes us forget who we are it was
[29:38] because by the way we were born the way
[29:41] we were born and seen and shaped in
[29:43] iniquity the Prophet calls us the
[29:50] prophet of God calls it amnesia the way
[29:54] we're born made us forget where we came
[29:56] from we cannot remember with just with
[29:59] this human mind but before the
[30:02] foundation of the world we were already
[30:04] there on the back part of God's mind now
[30:07] that we are here born and born in sin
[30:10] and shaped in iniquity the devil makes
[30:14] us forget who we really are just like
[30:16] the prodigal son when he left home and
[30:19] he said I want I want my inheritance he
[30:22] took all of it
[30:24] and then he ran oh he ran off after he
[30:27] had spent all of it he was not his mouse
[30:30] he now started eating a pig food that's
[30:34] where he was you know and then he was
[30:37] suffering then after some time he said
[30:40] they and he thought but the servant said
[30:43] my father's house the eating way better
[30:45] than I am and he was they just self
[30:49] reject he had self-rejection and was
[30:51] looking down upon himself but then he
[30:54] remembered that he was a son that he had
[30:57] a father although he had done wrong he
[31:00] was still a son doing run doing wrong
[31:04] doesn't change somebody being a son or
[31:06] the status of being a son you parents
[31:09] you know that
[31:10] when your child does wrong that's not
[31:13] gonna make them you you're not going to
[31:14] disown him because they made wrong amen
[31:18] so their son he said and he remembered
[31:20] and he said but I'm my the servants if
[31:23] at my father's house the eating way
[31:24] better than I am
[31:26] they have better clothing there they're
[31:28] living better and then he said he made
[31:30] up his mind and he said I'm going back
[31:32] to my father's house and when he goes
[31:35] back the Bible says the father saw him
[31:38] from afar so the father was already
[31:41] standing he knew that his son was going
[31:43] to come back someday
[31:45] he knew the son was going to return
[31:47] after he realized who he was that he was
[31:50] a son of his father so he was standing
[31:54] there and he saw from afar he saw the
[31:56] step he said that looks like my son and
[31:59] he knew he was going to come back this
[32:02] is what God done for us when we were
[32:04] born here on this earth
[32:06] we forgot who we are but when we
[32:09] realized who we really were that we
[32:12] we're sons of God when we realized our
[32:14] true identity we started walking and
[32:17] with by the revealing of the word we
[32:20] started coming back to God and God knew
[32:23] that we were going to come back to him
[32:25] whatever we had done that didn't matter
[32:29] because when he died on the cross of
[32:31] Calvary he paid for all of our sins so
[32:34] he paid for the sins that that we did
[32:37] and the ones that we are going to do so
[32:40] he already blotted them out hallelujah
[32:42] and he knew he knew that somehow one day
[32:47] because God never loses any better his
[32:49] so he knew that someday when the word of
[32:53] God was going to be revealed to you you
[32:54] are going to walk back to him and you
[32:56] always welcomes you back with a wide
[32:59] open arms amen we know we all know about
[33:03] the the momma Eagle story amen
[33:09] we told that she had and she had an egg
[33:12] that she couldn't find this farmer
[33:15] picked an egg and egos egg and he put it
[33:19] under a hand amongst the other chicken
[33:22] eggs
[33:24] then this chicken hashed the eggs and
[33:26] then there was one eaglet and the rest
[33:30] were chicken I'm pretty sure when the
[33:33] Eagle was growing up he looked different
[33:35] and they were all making fun of this
[33:38] eaglet they say look at your beak it was
[33:42] crooked crooked like this he couldn't
[33:44] eat properly and they you know he
[33:47] couldn't walk like a chicken and they
[33:49] are telling you but he would the the
[33:51] eaglet was constantly told that you are
[33:54] a chicken but he was always wondering
[33:56] why you know he looked different
[33:59] I believe he thought he had a speech
[34:01] impediment because he was trying to
[34:03] speak like a chicken but he was not
[34:05] designed to speak like that a man
[34:08] because he was built his genes it was
[34:11] genes always eager it gene spelled eager
[34:15] its feathers was eager it had nothing to
[34:19] do with a chicken but all is during all
[34:22] this time it was growing up it was just
[34:25] being told my my chicken was telling it
[34:27] you are a chicken
[34:28] you are a chicken when you see this when
[34:32] you see their birds that are that devar
[34:35] when you see those we run away because
[34:38] we are chickens those birds they pray
[34:40] after us and then this ego I believe he
[34:45] was just wondering why he was different
[34:46] from the rest of them you know he tries
[34:49] to eat they scratch for for worms in the
[34:51] dirt he just just couldn't
[34:54] wondered why his appetite was different
[34:56] it could not then one day mama Eagle
[35:00] knew that she had left an egg and she
[35:03] started going around trying to find it
[35:06] it's its egg that it had laid then she
[35:10] saw something that looked like an eagle
[35:13] and she said that's my son that's what I
[35:18] left and she came looking for the ego
[35:21] and when she came by mama ego tells mama
[35:26] chicken tells its children including the
[35:28] Eagle he says when you see an eagle you
[35:31] run away that's danger because it's
[35:34] coming to kill you so whenever you see
[35:36] an eagle
[35:37] cream or whenever you see an eagle take
[35:39] cover
[35:40] it's bad news for you Amen so this bird
[35:44] carried along its new whenever she
[35:46] whenever this little Eagle head would
[35:49] see Eagles or birds flying it'll you
[35:51] know
[35:52] take cover run away because the life was
[35:54] at stake that's what he had been taught
[35:56] by um by my mama chicken but now this
[36:00] time it was a bit different when Mama
[36:04] Eagles screamed he he heard something it
[36:07] sounded familiar but he had never heard
[36:09] it before because he had grown amongst
[36:12] the chickens he never heard the Eagle
[36:14] scream before but it sounded familiar it
[36:17] was a resounding - what was it with then
[36:19] at a man he looked looked like it looked
[36:22] it looked like itself this ignorant look
[36:25] then mama chicken says everybody take
[36:28] over all the chickens they run away
[36:30] trying to hide then this eaglet I
[36:34] believe he tried to he tried also to run
[36:37] away but something was pulling it you
[36:39] know I felt you know the depot was
[36:41] calling back to the deep a man when this
[36:45] ego will scream you say come up you know
[36:48] it's it was a different language but it
[36:50] could understand it because that's what
[36:53] it was born to be an eager not to be a
[36:55] chicken a man and is trying to run is
[36:59] trying to go take cover but if you know
[37:01] it's just filling this attraction issues
[37:04] just wants to go in here more it's like
[37:06] you know this sounds really good I want
[37:08] to hear more of this then he stopped
[37:10] then it looks up he says no I look like
[37:13] that mama chicken say run hide but then
[37:17] he said no let me hear some more mama
[37:19] ego said come up come up hither but then
[37:23] this Eagles say I've never flown before
[37:25] I don't know how to fly mama eagle said
[37:28] that was it was born within you just
[37:31] open up your wings flap them a little
[37:34] mama this eaglet said okay let me do it
[37:37] opens up his wings flap them up you see
[37:41] ever since in his whole life
[37:42] it had never flown it just knew how to
[37:45] jump probably never more than three feet
[37:47] up that's what you and it was told that
[37:51] what he thought he was but then you know
[37:53] he flapped his little wings then he saw
[37:55] himself rising up mama chicken said come
[37:58] back that's danger you're going to be
[38:00] eaten
[38:00] he thought he says no I'm getting out of
[38:02] here and he kept on going he kept on
[38:05] rising up hallelujah because the depot
[38:09] was calling to the deep he saw that this
[38:11] is what I am he realized his identity he
[38:15] says no I'm not a chicken I am an ego
[38:18] then he kept on going mama he goes say
[38:21] keep on flying and he saw yourself
[38:22] getting up and he says I'm out of here
[38:25] you see me no more I'm not a chicken I
[38:27] am an eagle hallelujah because it
[38:29] realized his true identity that's what
[38:33] we were when we were in the world we
[38:36] don't know why you don't understand why
[38:39] your appetite was different probably
[38:41] your friends you know called you to go
[38:42] smoke to go drink maybe go clubbing you
[38:46] probably did it but he just didn't you
[38:50] just didn't like it
[38:51] he just didn't feel it you know it's
[38:54] like no let's do this you probably did
[38:56] it but he just didn't he just didn't
[38:59] feel right why because before the
[39:02] foundation of the world God chose you to
[39:05] be his children God chose you to be a
[39:07] son God chose you to be a daughter so
[39:11] before you had not realised who you were
[39:13] when you were doing that but when you
[39:16] had the word when the word was revealed
[39:19] to you a man that you had the deep
[39:21] calling to you and you felt like this
[39:24] was it and this is the true ego food
[39:27] hallelujah we don't eat we don't eat
[39:30] worms that we scratch in the dirt
[39:32] now we don't we eat fresh food
[39:34] hallelujah a fresh kill every day
[39:37] hallelujah of the Word of God is all
[39:39] right hey man so when you heard the word
[39:43] however God opened it to you then you
[39:46] see you saw it and you say this is me
[39:48] that's my true identity you didn't you
[39:52] didn't refuse the call the call from God
[39:54] because that's what you really were you
[39:57] thought you always found yourself
[39:59] looking different you know amongst the
[40:01] people you know sometime I used to ask
[40:04] myself why am
[40:04] different but it was because I was an
[40:08] eager I was not a chicken a man so when
[40:12] you realize who you really are you know
[40:15] you want to get that fit you just want
[40:17] to get closer to God because you feel
[40:19] that deep calling to you amen so this
[40:24] dis chuck ins they were trying to put
[40:26] all those Creed's dogmas and habits to
[40:30] this ego but it just it was doing but it
[40:33] just couldn't you know he just couldn't
[40:35] feel it but when the word came that's
[40:39] when it flew back and it went what it
[40:42] was really a man there was an eager amen
[40:46] so that's who really we really are we
[40:50] are Eagles we are not chickens and we
[40:53] are told that the prophet of God says
[40:55] and all that was in God was put into
[40:58] Christ oh that was in Christ was brought
[41:01] into the church so we realized a church
[41:04] is not a building or a gathering of
[41:07] people church is the people can you
[41:11] shake your neighbors hand and say God
[41:12] bless you Church the person who's right
[41:20] next to you that's the church and here
[41:23] we're told that all that was in God was
[41:25] poured into Christ and all that was in
[41:28] Christ was poured into the church which
[41:32] is the person sitting right next to you
[41:34] the person who received the word for
[41:36] their day that is the church hallelujah
[41:38] the Bride of Christ and it's the people
[41:42] amen and also all the creative power
[41:45] that was in God he gave to Christ and
[41:48] that same power he gave it to the church
[41:51] you see so you look at this if you take
[41:55] sea water
[41:56] however trillions and quadrillions of
[42:00] gallons of sea water it's still the same
[42:03] it's still the same water if you take a
[42:05] small spoon of of that sea water and
[42:08] take it home you see that same water has
[42:11] the exact same properties as those
[42:14] trillions of gallons of water has but
[42:17] it's just in a smaller Kwan
[42:19] but it is still the same if you if you
[42:22] ask what's that are you gonna say it's
[42:25] water any teaspoon no it's sea water is
[42:28] it in the sea no it's in a teaspoon but
[42:31] it is the same water that was in the in
[42:33] the in the sea it has the exact same
[42:36] properties if you take chemistry you
[42:39] whatever whatever test you do that you
[42:43] get the exact same result because it is
[42:47] the same it is the same water that's
[42:49] what it is all the power that was in God
[42:52] he poured it into Christ and all the
[42:54] that same power Christ poured it into
[42:57] the church hallelujah
[42:59] because you remember Christ aid may I be
[43:01] one with them as I am one with you
[43:03] because so all the same power the
[43:06] creative power that God said when he
[43:08] said let there be when he created the
[43:11] world that same power lies within you
[43:14] this morning because he poured it into
[43:17] you hallelujah so that's that's who we
[43:21] really are but now with our human minds
[43:24] we fail to comprehend that because we
[43:27] cannot imagine having the same power as
[43:29] God has but now because we are limited
[43:32] in these three dimensions which it's
[43:35] like that same water in the teaspoon
[43:37] because we are in this in this small
[43:40] dimension so we can only exercise it
[43:43] where we where only we are you know
[43:46] where we can reach in these three
[43:47] dimensions so the same amount of water
[43:51] with the same properties in the teaspoon
[43:54] and now the same power that is in God
[43:58] that was that was in God when he poured
[44:00] it into Christ then he interned pour it
[44:03] into the church it is the same power
[44:05] with the same properties just in a
[44:08] diminished quantity because we are
[44:10] humans but that does not mean that power
[44:13] is not creative because we know Christ
[44:16] said if you got faith like as little as
[44:19] a mustard seed you can you can move a
[44:21] mountain and send it into the water why
[44:23] because you have that power because when
[44:26] you realize you a son of God you have
[44:28] that faith and that power is invested in
[44:31] you so you can do it
[44:32] same creative power he had is right in
[44:35] you amen
[44:36] I'll adjust in a smaller quantity so we
[44:39] realized that whatever God had we have
[44:43] it that's why the Bible says we are a
[44:45] mature God's because that same power we
[44:48] have it this morning
[44:50] so do not be scared to exercise that
[44:52] power when you come across situations
[44:54] use that power because you are an
[44:57] amateur god amen revelations 1 and verse
[45:01] 6 it says Jesus is we know that Jesus is
[45:04] the king of kings hallelujah Jesus is
[45:08] the king of kings and he is the high
[45:11] priest of our confession so if he is the
[45:15] king of kings
[45:16] tell me who are the kings because he is
[45:20] the king of kings who are the Kings
[45:23] somebody tell me I'm looking at the
[45:26] Kings right now amen and what do Kings
[45:29] have Kings have authority Kings have
[45:32] power but we know our the power that we
[45:35] have as kings was it was spelled out in
[45:39] acts in Acts chapter 1 when he said you
[45:42] shall receive power the Greek
[45:44] translation calls it authority so you
[45:47] shall raise after you receive the Holy
[45:49] Ghost you will shall have authority that
[45:52] is the power that's being spelled out
[45:54] for our kingdom our our jurisdiction as
[45:58] the Kings hallelujah we have authority
[46:01] we know the prophet of God tells us that
[46:04] when the weakest Christian goes to their
[46:06] knees to pray they're able to shake hell
[46:09] hallelujah why because they have
[46:12] authority because they are a king amen
[46:15] so we are kings and we know that Jesus
[46:18] Christ is our king hallelujah and he is
[46:22] the high priest that will be the high
[46:24] priest of our confession so if he is a
[46:27] high priest it means that they are also
[46:28] priests and revelations once it tells us
[46:31] that we are kings and priests
[46:33] what do priests do priests stand in for
[46:37] one another that's what we ought to do
[46:39] for one another when our when your
[46:43] fellow friend brother sister is in
[46:45] trouble we are
[46:46] supposed to intercede for one another
[46:47] because we are told that we oppressed
[46:50] but we know that Christ is our high
[46:52] priest amen when one of us is in trouble
[46:55] we ought to go on our knees and pray and
[46:57] intercede for our fellow brother for our
[47:00] fellow sister our fellow friend when
[47:03] they are in trouble because that as that
[47:06] is our mandate that is that that is our
[47:10] identity it is spelled out in the Bible
[47:12] we are kings and priests so we have
[47:14] authority what what do we have authority
[47:17] over we have every authority over
[47:20] everything that God created amen because
[47:24] we realize God gave the power to Adam
[47:27] over everything he said men have
[47:29] dominion over everything so adam was
[47:32] king over everything that God had
[47:34] created but he lost that after the fall
[47:37] but we know when Christ went back to the
[47:40] cross of Calvary and He shed his blood
[47:42] he came back as the second Adam and he
[47:45] redeemed that title deed that Adam had
[47:47] lost and he plays it back into the hands
[47:50] of the church amen so you and I we had
[47:53] now have that same power that Adam had
[47:56] but lost so anything that comes in our
[47:59] way we have authority over it any
[48:01] disease that comes our way we have
[48:03] authority over it any trial that comes
[48:06] our way we have authority over it any
[48:09] fear that comes away we have authority
[48:12] over it amen because we are kings we are
[48:15] priests we have that authority that
[48:17] spelled out in Acts chapter 1 verse 8
[48:20] amen hallelujah so that's who we are we
[48:24] are kings we are priests amen
[48:29] we all heard I believe we all know the
[48:33] story about the the boy little boy who
[48:36] saw himself in the mirror after he you
[48:39] know he visited his relatives I won't
[48:41] dwell much upon it but after he went in
[48:44] front of the mirror he had never seen a
[48:46] mirror before but then he just looked
[48:50] and he said that can't be anyone else
[48:52] that's definitely me anyway he went up
[48:56] and he said I've seen myself that is me
[48:59] but he had never seen himself before why
[49:02] because you see a mirror shows you your
[49:05] true identity a mirror doesn't lie
[49:09] whatever whatever you are that's what
[49:12] you are when you look into a mirror when
[49:14] you see a smudge probably on your cheek
[49:16] but did you say well now maybe I think
[49:19] it's lying I don't have it
[49:20] you remove it why because you know is
[49:22] there a mirror shows you what you are
[49:24] what's really there that's just like
[49:27] what the word of God is to us the word
[49:30] of God when we look into it it's like a
[49:32] mirror we see ourselves you see the Word
[49:36] of God doesn't change somebody if if you
[49:40] are not predestinated that does not
[49:43] change if you are a son of God that does
[49:47] not change and if you are a Cena and was
[49:51] meant to be a sinner that does not
[49:53] change either when you look into use
[49:56] that's white not everybody received the
[49:57] word when you look into it although you
[50:00] were doing wrong you remember you know
[50:02] that I'm a son of God and you strive to
[50:04] get closer to God because you have known
[50:07] who you are when as sinner
[50:09] somebody who is not predestinated to be
[50:11] saved when they look at the word they
[50:14] move further away from God because
[50:16] that's who they are remember somebody
[50:19] was giving him a book of the message and
[50:23] then he read it and then he brought back
[50:25] to the person who read who gave the book
[50:28] and he said my friend the book that you
[50:30] gave me called me a buzzard and he said
[50:33] really but the same book called me an
[50:35] eagle though so that same book the Word
[50:38] of God told somebody else that they were
[50:41] a buzzard and they realized their
[50:43] identity they said oh yeah I'm a buzzard
[50:45] because that's what the book called me
[50:47] but this other person who had received
[50:49] the word when they saw it they saw
[50:52] themselves as an eager everybody looking
[50:54] in the same book looking in the same
[50:56] mirror if they were shown their true
[50:59] identity who they really are so the
[51:01] Bible the Word of God shows you this
[51:04] morning who you really are
[51:06] whenever you have a question whenever
[51:09] you have a problem try and go find in
[51:11] the Bible you will see
[51:12] yourself in there and you will make it
[51:14] manifested amen hallelujah so because we
[51:19] were predestinated to be sons that one
[51:21] change we see in proverbs 23 verse 7
[51:26] says as a man thinketh in his heart so
[51:31] is he
[51:32] and then later on in the New Testament
[51:35] comes and tells us that let the mind
[51:38] ours in Christ be in you and Christ who
[51:41] Christ who was God who became man so you
[51:45] see Christ was God was trying to be man
[51:50] but now so proverbs tells us that as a
[51:53] man thinketh in his heart so is he
[51:56] and we are told that the mind of Christ
[51:59] that was in Christ should be in us so if
[52:02] we start thinking like Christ like how
[52:06] Christ thought and that same way however
[52:10] way we're gonna think that's what we are
[52:12] gonna be Christ was God and if you start
[52:15] thinking like Christ then what do you
[52:17] become can somebody answer me
[52:21] what do you become if you start thinking
[52:23] like Christ amen
[52:25] hallelujah that's what we are supposed
[52:27] to be we are supposed to be a reflection
[52:29] of Jesus Christ when we start thinking
[52:32] like God amen
[52:33] you see we're not when you start
[52:35] thinking like God when you see a problem
[52:37] you don't see it as a trouble you see it
[52:39] as an opportunity to exercise your power
[52:42] when you see a sickness you don't cry
[52:44] you see you start rejoicing you see it
[52:47] as a potential testimony when you see a
[52:50] trial you start looking at it as a
[52:52] potential victory because you are
[52:54] looking at it differently you're not
[52:56] looking at it like somebody who's who's
[52:58] timid you are looking at it like an
[53:00] overcomer because Jesus Christ wasn't
[53:02] overcoming amen hallelujah so you speak
[53:07] however way you think that's how you're
[53:09] gonna speak because Luke 6:45 says out
[53:12] of the abundance of the heart the mouth
[53:14] speaketh amen so you should whatever you
[53:17] think of yourself that's how you're
[53:19] gonna be so start thinking like God and
[53:22] you're gonna start seeing your life
[53:24] changing amen
[53:26] every potential problem you will see it
[53:29] as an opportunity to exercise your power
[53:31] and not as a trouble amen so the Bible
[53:35] will see our own reflection it shows us
[53:38] who we really are a man when the Bible
[53:41] says you will you shall be their head
[53:43] and not the tail we look and we say yes
[53:46] amen
[53:46] that is me when the Bible says above and
[53:50] not beneath you look at it you say Amen
[53:53] that is me amen when you are sick and
[53:55] you look at the Bible when it says by my
[53:58] stripes you were healed you look at it
[54:00] and you say that is me Amen hallelujah
[54:02] when I really say they shall drink
[54:05] poisonous stuff and it will not harm
[54:06] them you look at it and you say Amen
[54:09] that is me hallelujah we know that our
[54:12] PO when he was on when they had that
[54:15] shipwreck and they had gone to this
[54:17] island he was here he was bit by a snake
[54:20] but he realized who he was here he
[54:24] remembered he remembered the scripture
[54:26] that said that if if this they shall not
[54:29] be harmed so it just beat him then he
[54:32] remembered it then he said that is me
[54:34] then he shook it off into the fire
[54:36] because he knew who you was hallelujah
[54:39] whenever you have sinned and the devil
[54:42] tries to pull you down you look into the
[54:44] word you say and you and it says that
[54:47] you are forgiven you look at it and you
[54:49] say that is Who I am
[54:51] I know I'm blameless because my accuser
[54:54] the devil has nothing to say God put his
[54:57] right back to him because we know we are
[54:59] justified justified means life you have
[55:02] not even done it in the first place if I
[55:06] see if you come to me and you say
[55:08] apologize for slapping me oh no because
[55:11] I didn't slap you that's what it is I'm
[55:15] not going to accept because I never did
[55:17] it in the first place so that's what God
[55:20] says of all your sins that you have
[55:22] confessed you put it in the sea of
[55:24] forgetfulness and he says that never
[55:26] happened when the devil comes to try and
[55:29] come and accuse and he said he did this
[55:31] this and that God says he never done it
[55:34] in the first place not guilty it is on
[55:37] you devil a man
[55:39] hallelujah when the Bible says we shall
[55:42] perform exploits we look into where and
[55:44] you say that is us amen
[55:46] he says signs and wonders shall follow
[55:48] them that believe we look and we claim
[55:50] it because we look at it into it and we
[55:52] say that is us Amen hallelujah
[55:55] we know we are Gentiles we have that
[55:58] Gentile faith you know the Romans sent
[56:00] Centurion he said he had so much faith
[56:03] he said Jesus you don't have to lay
[56:05] hands just say the word I know when you
[56:07] say it it can be done when we look at
[56:10] into it we know we are Gentiles we say
[56:13] that is us hallelujah we just want the
[56:15] words spoken and we know it can be done
[56:18] when the Bible says many are the
[56:20] afflictions of the righteous but God
[56:22] delivers out of them all which look at
[56:24] it and we say Amen that is us amen and
[56:27] if we when the Bible says we are
[56:29] citizens of the heavenly kingdom we just
[56:32] look and we say Amen because we know
[56:35] that is who we are you see now when
[56:40] Peter Peter knew who he was but before
[56:44] he did he was running away he was hiding
[56:48] and he was rejecting Christ they said we
[56:50] saw you with Christ before and you said
[56:52] I don't know what you're talking about I
[56:54] don't know this man but after Calvary
[56:58] and after he had met God he realized who
[57:02] he was he was now bald and he was now he
[57:05] had realized his true identity and he
[57:08] was healing people he was out there
[57:10] healing people saying silver and gold
[57:13] have I none but what I have I give to
[57:15] you who says that because you realized
[57:18] the authority that he was given by God
[57:20] he realized his true identity amen
[57:24] you see I want to read when the Bible
[57:29] say we are citizens of the heavenly
[57:32] kingdom that makes us so we what that
[57:35] does make us we are not citizens of the
[57:38] earth you see we are ambassadors I read
[57:42] what the prophet of God said it says um
[57:48] why
[57:49] why they have everything that happened
[57:51] owns behind them ah stuff from the top
[57:53] and when and when every talk of fear is
[57:56] vanished and the Holy Spirit is
[57:58] completely in control of the church then
[58:01] all fears are gone and that church has
[58:04] the power why they have everything that
[58:06] have been owned behind them their
[58:08] ambassadors of the throne absolutely an
[58:12] ambassador of Christ has the authority
[58:14] and everything that Christ owns belongs
[58:17] to that ambassador and he said go ye
[58:20] into all the world you are my witnesses
[58:23] after the Holy Ghost is come upon you so
[58:26] you can only become an ambassador after
[58:29] you have received the Holy Ghost because
[58:31] that's when you can become a true
[58:32] witness of Christ amen so an ambassador
[58:37] if I am an ambassador from Congo if I
[58:41] commit a crime here the US government
[58:45] can touch me they are not allowed to I
[58:48] have diplomatic immunity if I commit a
[58:51] crime if I run a red light and they want
[58:55] to and they want to prosecute me they
[58:57] have to call the government in Congo and
[59:00] you say your man here did something can
[59:02] you do something about it and then they
[59:04] have to fly me back to Congo that's
[59:06] where they can prosecute me they can't
[59:08] touch me they are not allowed amen
[59:10] because I have diplomatic immunity amen
[59:14] I remember some time ago the devil was
[59:17] working on the earth and he sold job he
[59:20] wanted to afflict him but he didn't have
[59:23] the power so he had to go to God and ask
[59:26] for permission because he couldn't do it
[59:29] hallelujah because job was an ambassador
[59:32] he was representing Christ hallelujah he
[59:35] was representing he was of the
[59:38] heavenlies he was a heavenly citizen
[59:40] that's what we are this morning amen we
[59:43] are ambassadors of heaven we are
[59:46] citizens of the heavenly kingdom so the
[59:48] devil has no right to touch us and he
[59:52] cannot unless God allows it but we know
[59:55] that God only allows it when he he only
[59:58] allows it because he knows we are going
[1:00:00] to overcome it
[1:00:01] amen so when you see some
[1:00:03] come your way you know that God has
[1:00:05] allowed it because the devil by himself
[1:00:07] he is not allowed to touch you
[1:00:09] we are untouchable we are the Bride of
[1:00:11] Christ amen
[1:00:12] so when it whatever comes your way you
[1:00:15] know God has allowed it and has given
[1:00:17] you he has given you beforehand the
[1:00:20] power and ability to go through that
[1:00:23] trial because we are ambassadors of the
[1:00:25] heavenly kingdom an ambassador
[1:00:28] represents the whole country when I'm
[1:00:31] back an ambassador's saved some
[1:00:33] ambassadors you see they have to be
[1:00:35] careful what they speak they have to be
[1:00:37] careful what their words are because you
[1:00:39] would be quoted whatever word you say
[1:00:42] that's what your country has said so we
[1:00:46] ought to be careful of what we are what
[1:00:48] we are saying because whatever we are
[1:00:50] saying we are representing the whole
[1:00:52] heavenly kingdom because we are
[1:00:54] ambassadors of God amen we should really
[1:00:57] know who we are
[1:00:58] amen you know PO for when he went to
[1:01:03] Paul had the power when he prayed for
[1:01:06] the sick they were getting healed and
[1:01:08] people were getting healed when he would
[1:01:10] walk by they would lay them so that his
[1:01:12] shadow would just would just heal the
[1:01:14] people it's because he knew who he was
[1:01:16] he was not a god but he was the son of
[1:01:19] God a man he realized his true identity
[1:01:22] you see when then the sons of Skeever
[1:01:25] they wanted to pray for somebody else
[1:01:27] they prayed and they said in the name of
[1:01:29] Jesus Christ whom Paul preaches this
[1:01:32] demon say Paul we know Jesus we know but
[1:01:36] who are you they didn't recognize them
[1:01:40] they didn't know them so you see when
[1:01:42] you know your your your identity the
[1:01:44] whole of Hell they know you they are
[1:01:48] afraid of you they know that they is so
[1:01:50] and so because you have realized your
[1:01:52] true identity and you are representing
[1:01:55] heaven so they say that these demons
[1:01:58] refused to get out they say we don't
[1:02:00] know you everybody you talked about we
[1:02:03] know about them but we don't know you
[1:02:04] and they couldn't go so if you don't
[1:02:06] know who you are then demons also don't
[1:02:09] know who you are they they won't listen
[1:02:12] to you but when you realize your true
[1:02:14] identity you have that power too
[1:02:17] walk sir comes back you know you can
[1:02:19] walk and chase every demon that comes in
[1:02:22] your way every trial that tries to come
[1:02:24] and stop you you can walk through it
[1:02:26] because you know who you are
[1:02:28] amen you see the prophet of God said we
[1:02:32] are a representation of another world
[1:02:34] here where we are right now we are
[1:02:37] representing heaven that's where we
[1:02:40] really are when he went beyond the
[1:02:42] curtain of time he came back and he said
[1:02:43] I saw you there how could he see the
[1:02:47] people who were seated in the Branham
[1:02:49] Tabernacle how could he see them there
[1:02:53] because he saw their body he saw that
[1:02:57] the open is over there that he said I
[1:02:59] saw you there so he says we are a
[1:03:01] representation of another world that's
[1:03:05] where we really are so here we are being
[1:03:08] influenced by our theophanies we are not
[1:03:10] of this world we have a connection with
[1:03:13] another dimension hallelujah so we are
[1:03:16] not affected by this
[1:03:18] we are not affected by environments
[1:03:20] everything that happens at this earth
[1:03:21] because that's where we are not really
[1:03:24] here we are in another place amen the
[1:03:27] prophet of god tells us the story of
[1:03:29] this slave was at a slave plantation and
[1:03:34] when this slave trader I tried to come
[1:03:36] and buy him the slave owners say he's
[1:03:40] not for sale says why not
[1:03:42] is he like like a supervisor or some you
[1:03:46] say no you say why does it work
[1:03:49] different then the slave owner said I
[1:03:51] found out later that he is a son of a
[1:03:55] king from where he comes from so
[1:03:58] although he was shipped to a whole
[1:04:01] different continent altogether whatever
[1:04:05] his external environments didn't change
[1:04:08] what was really within him he kept he
[1:04:11] still kept walking with his chest out
[1:04:13] because he know I'm a son of the King he
[1:04:16] knew who you really was where he was
[1:04:18] determined it'd not determine his
[1:04:21] identity so that's that's work that's
[1:04:24] the same situation we are in we are in a
[1:04:27] whole different environment altogether
[1:04:30] or
[1:04:30] all different world but our situations
[1:04:34] around us does not determine who we are
[1:04:36] we should walk with our chest out
[1:04:39] knowing that we are sons and daughters
[1:04:40] of God that we come from another Kingdom
[1:04:44] amen
[1:04:44] that's what we are portraying from where
[1:04:47] we come from and when we walk we know
[1:04:51] for sure that we are sons and daughters
[1:04:52] of the Almighty God and there is nothing
[1:04:55] that can stop us amen
[1:04:56] the prophet of God says then if he
[1:04:59] raised from the dead he is no more in a
[1:05:01] copper of body but he is in our body and
[1:05:04] all that was in God he poured into
[1:05:07] Christ and all that was in Christ he
[1:05:09] poured into the church so it's a
[1:05:11] continuation that day you'll know that
[1:05:13] I'm I'm in the father and the father in
[1:05:16] me and I am you all together the Holy
[1:05:19] Spirit working in the church amen
[1:05:21] we were made to be a mature God's
[1:05:24] hallelujah to create because that same
[1:05:27] power lies within us
[1:05:29] amen so there is nothing that can stop
[1:05:32] us so the moment the bride realizes who
[1:05:35] we are then we become an invincible army
[1:05:37] if we lay hands on the sick they will
[1:05:40] recover amen
[1:05:41] and we have the revelation that we come
[1:05:45] from God and we are going back to God
[1:05:48] that's why we shouldn't be too much
[1:05:50] concerned about cares of this world
[1:05:52] because we are not of this world we are
[1:05:55] citizens of the heavenly kingdom at
[1:05:57] different place altogether hallelujah
[1:05:59] you see that's why Daniel he wanted to
[1:06:01] live in this day God gave him the
[1:06:04] timeline of the God gave him the
[1:06:07] timeline of the life on Earth and he
[1:06:10] said Lord I want to live in that day God
[1:06:12] says no Daniel you go your way
[1:06:15] I have a special people that have to
[1:06:17] live in this day all the slots are
[1:06:19] already taken those people cause you see
[1:06:22] he had predestinated us before the
[1:06:24] foundation of the world amen you see in
[1:06:27] as much as you envy Daniels testimony of
[1:06:30] being in the Lions Den and not being
[1:06:32] eaten by lions
[1:06:33] he really wanted to be seated where you
[1:06:36] are because he saw the power that the
[1:06:38] church will be having amen so in as much
[1:06:42] as you envied him he envied you
[1:06:44] you said lord please put me in that
[1:06:46] dispensation that's where I want to
[1:06:48] leave God said no Daniel you go your way
[1:06:51] I have said this time for a particular
[1:06:54] special people who are supposed to run
[1:06:56] and be relays in this final race amen
[1:06:59] I believe most of you you have seen a
[1:07:01] relay race where you have four runners
[1:07:04] so usually when you have with the coach
[1:07:07] whoever is in charge of the team they
[1:07:10] usually put the fastest person at the at
[1:07:12] the beginning but then the fastest of
[1:07:15] them all
[1:07:15] he puts at the last as the fourth person
[1:07:18] so the first person is supposed to be
[1:07:21] fast enough to open the gap and give so
[1:07:24] that really the other two don't have to
[1:07:26] be really fast they just have to
[1:07:28] maintain then perhaps there was
[1:07:31] something that didn't go really well
[1:07:34] during the middle two exchanges that's
[1:07:38] why they put the fastest person because
[1:07:40] they'll be able if there was anything
[1:07:42] that happened wrong you'll be able to
[1:07:44] correct it to correct that that leg that
[1:07:48] happened and be faster and overtake and
[1:07:51] be first so that's what it is in the
[1:07:54] whole timeline God saw it fit that you
[1:07:57] and I be in this last day amen because
[1:08:01] he knew where the power that he invested
[1:08:02] in you and me we had the fastest people
[1:08:05] in this race a man with a full revealed
[1:08:07] word in our day we had the fastest
[1:08:10] people that's why Daniel was envying
[1:08:12] your spot he wanted to perform exploits
[1:08:15] like you are he wanted to heal cancer
[1:08:17] like it has been in our day because then
[1:08:20] cancer didn't exist and a disease that
[1:08:24] don't even exist in the three dimensions
[1:08:26] but that don't matter
[1:08:27] we have the power that God invested in
[1:08:30] us amen that's why you wanted to take a
[1:08:32] spot because he that we will be
[1:08:35] performing exploits amen
[1:08:37] so it is our duty and our mandate
[1:08:39] because we know we are the fastest
[1:08:41] people with everything opened old up
[1:08:44] with the whole Bible and all examples we
[1:08:47] can see ourselves in it we can do
[1:08:49] miracles amen we can do exploits
[1:08:52] hallelujah there is nothing that can
[1:08:54] stop us because in this relay race I
[1:08:57] tell you
[1:08:58] you are the fastest one amen because we
[1:09:01] know who we are we have realized our
[1:09:03] true identity in this last days amen and
[1:09:06] we have been given the power to speak we
[1:09:08] can speak and create you see back in the
[1:09:11] day Joshua one of the greatest miracles

[1:09:17] full 24 hours and there was a great
[1:09:20] miracle that was recorded in the Bible
[1:09:22] but in that's the last days it is a
[1:09:24] different situation all together we talk
[1:09:27] about creation of squirrels amen we talk
[1:09:30] about creation of healings amen
