[0:59] Glory to God God
[1:01] Amen we're going to read by the grace of
[1:03] God Exodus
[1:05] 23 uh beginning at the 20th
[1:08] verse behold I sent an angel before thee
[1:12] to keep thee in the
[1:14] way and to bring thee into the place
[1:18] which I have
[1:20] prepared beware of him and obey his
[1:24] voice provoke him not for he will not
[1:28] pardon your trans transgressions for my
[1:31] name is in him but if Thou shalt indeed
[1:36] obey his voice and do all that I speak
[1:40] then I will be an enemy unto thine enemy
[1:42] and an adversary unto thy
[1:45] adversary but my angel shall go before
[1:48] thee and bring thee into the amorites
[1:50] and the Hittites and the perizzites and
[1:53] the Canaanites hivites and jebusites and
[1:57] I will cut them off
[2:00] thou shallal not bow to their gods nor
[2:04] serve them nor do after their works but
[2:08] thou shal utterly overthrow them and
[2:11] quite break down their images and ye
[2:14] shall serve the Lord your God and he
[2:16] shall bless thy bread and thy water and
[2:20] I will take sickness away from the midst
[2:22] of thee there shall nothing cast their
[2:26] young nor be Barren in the land the
[2:30] number of the days will I fulfill and I
[2:33] will send my fear before thee and will
[2:35] destroy all the people to whom Thou
[2:38] shallal come and I will make all thine
[2:41] enemies turn their backs unto thee and I
[2:44] will send Hornets before thee which
[2:47] shall drive out the hivites the
[2:49] Canaanites and the Hittites from before
[2:51] Thee I will not drive them out from
[2:54] before thee in one
[2:56] year lest the land become desolate and
[2:59] and the Beast of the field multiply
[3:01] against thee by little and little will I
[3:05] drive them out before thee until thou be
[3:08] increased and inherit the
[3:11] land Hallelujah let us pray father God
[3:15] we thank you right now for your grace
[3:17] and your mercy we thank you for being so
[3:19] good to us and Lord God we appreciate
[3:22] you father for everything that you are
[3:25] doing for us right now there is a mighty
[3:28] revival going on on in our souls Lord oh
[3:32] God and we thank you for it father
[3:35] because it is something that we
[3:36] ourselves could not have done but we
[3:39] thank you for your mercy and your grace
[3:41] we thank you for the love that you have
[3:43] shown to us and father there are no
[3:46] words that can express our gratitude
[3:48] toward you but Hallelujah We Want To
[3:52] Praise Your Name give you glory we pray
[3:55] that you have preeminence here this
[3:56] evening in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[3:59] amen amen you may be
[4:03] seated but first of all we realize amen
[4:06] that we're not
[4:09] alone I heard a song say how can you
[4:11] ever be lonely when you're never
[4:15] alone ain't that
[4:17] amazing how we can say we're lonely yet
[4:20] God says I'm with you am but
[4:23] nevertheless we realize amen that we're
[4:25] living in a trying
[4:26] time brother brandham tells us that this
[4:30] bride in which Jesus Christ has
[4:32] ordained is
[4:35] Invincible she cannot be defeated no
[4:39] more than God can be
[4:41] defeated and we look at this thing and I
[4:43] want you to see what God has done for us
[4:47] he has put us in a place where he we can
[4:51] see his promises uh being
[4:54] fulfilled he tells us that we're in an
[4:57] age of
[4:58] restoration and he goes on and he tells
[5:01] us that all that the Locust the Palmer
[5:03] worm caterpillar all of those four those
[5:05] four stages of worm have eaten he said I
[5:08] shall restore remember brother bradam
[5:11] said that worm ate that tree down to the
[5:14] root but one thing about it it could not
[5:17] die amen why because it was the brid
[5:21] tree amen amen and she was made after
[5:25] the bridegroom
[5:27] tree so you and I must realized by the
[5:30] grace of God that God had all of this in
[5:35] his mind and now we're seeing it unfold
[5:37] before us and it ought to give
[5:40] us how can I said overwhelming joy to
[5:44] see that God's grace is upon us remember
[5:47] brother brandham talks about it and he
[5:49] goes on to tell us about how God shall
[5:52] restore and he takes the king of Egypt
[5:55] and how he saw Sarah and said oh my
[5:58] isn't she's a beautiful old woman
[6:01] now if he had only known her age he
[6:03] might have not have been interested amen
[6:06] but by the grace of God God had changed
[6:08] her back into a young woman amen right
[6:10] he never took away the age he took away
[6:13] the effect of the age and we find out by
[6:16] the grace of God because I'm going tell
[6:18] you something if there was an age called
[6:20] eternity we've been old for a long time
[6:22] but we realize by the grace of God there
[6:24] is no time in eternity and we realize
[6:27] amen that here this King was getting
[6:29] ready to take uh uh uh Sarah for wife
[6:34] and God visited
[6:36] it doesn't tell us what Abraham prayed
[6:40] it doesn't even tell us that Abraham did
[6:43] pray but the point is God was a restorer
[6:48] see he's not only a deliverer he's a
[6:51] restorer and David understood that
[6:54] because David said oh Lord restore unto
[6:57] me the joy of my salvation
[7:00] so if we can see God as a restorer we
[7:03] can then understand that if there's
[7:05] anything that we have lost God is I oh
[7:09] my God he's more than able to restore it
[7:13] back aund fold because understand it is
[7:18] Satan who has taken these things from us
[7:21] not
[7:23] Goden my God would work it in in toward
[7:26] your good because the Bible said that
[7:29] all things work together for the good of
[7:31] them that love God is able Amen to work
[7:34] it toward your good because remember
[7:36] though Abraham amen told Sarah to lie
[7:39] look what he left
[7:41] with when he left Egypt amen and he left
[7:45] the king you got to realize he had far
[7:48] more stuff with him donkeys horses cows
[7:52] whatever you call it amen his
[7:53] inheritance was greater now amen because
[7:57] the devil not only had to restore his
[7:59] wife life but he had to uh pay
[8:03] interest on what he took from God or
[8:06] what he took from Abraham he had to pay
[8:09] an interest he had to give an offering
[8:12] Amen to Abraham and Abraham was the one
[8:16] who
[8:17] lied now that's in restoring so I want
[8:20] you to see how blessed you are amen that
[8:22] that no matter what and and we're not
[8:25] telling you to go out here to lie but I
[8:26] want you to understand amen that God
[8:29] will work everything toward your
[8:33] good and his
[8:35] purpose right now we look at this thing
[8:38] and you say Okay I I I I can see that
[8:41] and you understand Satan had to give it
[8:45] back as I say brother bam talks about a
[8:49] a law enforcement just bear with me he
[8:52] talks about how that if if something's
[8:55] gone wrong you can call the police when
[8:58] you can't get it straight now
[9:00] that law would come and
[9:02] enforce that person who's violated your
[9:07] your property or whatever to give it
[9:09] back and he goes on to say Amen that the
[9:13] Holy Ghost is an
[9:15] enforcer and see what it is we think oh
[9:19] when we say Satan take your hands off of
[9:21] her what you fail to see is that your
[9:24] words has now caused God to come on the
[9:27] scene why because he said whatsoever you
[9:31] say believing that you would receive it
[9:34] it's yours now you can't do it but the
[9:37] words you
[9:39] speak bring God on the scene who is the
[9:43] enforcer and he goes to Satan and says
[9:45] my son my daughter just spoke it give it
[9:48] amen hallelujah and he comes and he
[9:51] brings it back to you come on somebody
[9:53] amen now you got to realize amen that
[9:56] God is the enforcer let me explain it
[10:00] brother brandham goes on to say it like
[10:02] this he said the sun forces the life out
[10:09] of the
[10:11] seed the sun which is a type of the s o
[10:15] n the Su N is a type of the s o n
[10:21] everything that can
[10:23] live it is the s n that forces it to
[10:28] happen even even though you don't see it
[10:30] it doesn't matter brother said the pp
[10:32] could be done ran out of the seed it
[10:34] could look dead as all get out but if
[10:36] there's a German of Life there that son
[10:40] will find it and pull it up and cause it
[10:44] to
[10:45] live hallelujah oh Lord have mercy come
[10:49] on somebody I'm not talking about just
[10:51] the seed I'm talking about you I'm
[10:53] talking about you and me amen that's
[10:56] exactly what God has done in your life
[10:59] amen he's found life in you you could
[11:02] have been on the bar in the bar you
[11:04] could have been on the street you could
[11:06] have been all kinds of who Among Us or
[11:08] whatever the case may be but God saw a
[11:10] germ of life in
[11:13] you and that s o and is drawing it right
[11:16] on up right on up you might have looked
[11:19] like a mess amen but that life in you
[11:22] cannot die amen oh Lord have mercy now
[11:28] we look at this thing and we see how God
[11:31] even in nature proves
[11:35] himself look around you people see what
[11:39] God has
[11:40] done and I heard somebody say he's a
[11:44] mastermind right he's a mastermind let's
[11:48] move on now we read that scripture and I
[11:51] wanted to bring those little thoughts
[11:52] out because I want you to understand how
[11:55] and what we're coming
[11:57] into I love this I'm so glad that God
[12:00] didn't shakee me into a Baptist or shape
[12:02] me into a a Holiness or or whatever I'm
[12:05] so glad he didn't shakee me into that
[12:08] amen there was something about me that
[12:10] couldn't be
[12:12] shaped I went along with the program but
[12:15] I couldn't be part of it I couldn't be
[12:17] all they wanted me to be y'all
[12:19] understand what I'm saying because I am
[12:22] the
[12:23] word and that is the only reason why you
[12:26] couldn't do it because you are the word
[12:29] that's what brother an that's what he
[12:30] said he said we are not like Mary who
[12:32] was a carrier of the word he said we the
[12:35] bride we are the word now what do we are
[12:40] we are Jesus Christ in Bride form amen
[12:45] is that right we've said it over and
[12:48] over and over again but I don't
[12:50] understand why people think that Jesus
[12:52] Christ that Miss Jesus Christ will be
[12:54] weaker than
[12:57] Jesus because you got to understand
[12:59] saying it's the same life the same life
[13:03] is now in her is that all right now the
[13:08] prophet of God goes on to tell
[13:10] us the reason why I wanted to say these
[13:13] things because the message is true we
[13:17] should know that because it's now
[13:19] beginning to give us identity it's
[13:21] showing us who we are where we come from
[13:24] where we going and what we shall be
[13:26] really is that right all right now when
[13:29] Paul wrote it he said when he shall
[13:30] appear we'll be just like him but we
[13:32] don't know uh and we'll be like him
[13:35] right but it's not said on what we be
[13:37] what it's going to really be like but
[13:38] the prophet of God because remember
[13:40] brother the word of God said when the
[13:42] Holy Spirit Come the truth he'll not
[13:44] only show us things present but he'll
[13:46] show us things to come how can he show
[13:48] us things to come he has to have a
[13:50] prophet amen the prophet is the one that
[13:53] bring brings the message and shows us
[13:56] things to come amen so now is telling us
[13:59] in this future home I'm just saying
[14:01] because I've listened to a lot of things
[14:03] but he's not only telling us who we are
[14:05] where we fit in the picture where are we
[14:07] going to be how it's going to be come on
[14:10] somebody listen it is a deep message but
[14:13] the thing about it it is fulfilling the
[14:15] scripture amen that he'll show us things
[14:18] to come am and he gives us an identity
[14:22] to let us see that we are just like
[14:26] Jesus Christ amen is that all right
[14:29] he brings out to us that we are
[14:31] completely Justified as though we have
[14:34] never sinned in the first place you know
[14:37] people don't believe that there are so
[14:39] many people who says amen but don't
[14:41] believe it you know why because they
[14:44] still in the seventh Church
[14:46] age Hallelujah but when you in the
[14:49] eighth age or you come to that Holy
[14:52] convocation something has taken a hold
[14:54] of you and you're no longer Earthbound
[14:57] amen right you're sailing with the
[15:00] astronauts
[15:02] now right now listen what brother said
[15:05] here in the restoration of the Bride
[15:07] tree he said all the bugs that hell can
[15:10] turn loose on her will never stop her
[15:14] amen no communism no Catholicism no
[15:17] nothing else will stop it I will restore
[15:20] said the Lord all the man-made Roman
[15:23] trees will never hang in there all the
[15:25] graves will never keep it in there all
[15:28] the big denom ation Stones laying at the
[15:30] door will never keep it in there I will
[15:33] restore say the Lord is that right
[15:36] that's the whole point about these
[15:39] stones of unbelief that that that are
[15:42] now sealing churches in what it is he he
[15:45] want the body to stay there he don't
[15:47] want the stone to be roll away but I got
[15:50] news for him our Stone was rolled away
[15:52] 200000 years ago he said there will be
[15:55] an Easter and I'll bring forth that same
[15:58] church in it same power I'll bring that
[16:00] bride out just like she was back there
[16:03] with the same signs the same fruits the
[16:06] same thing that they did I'll bring her
[16:08] back again I will restore say the Lord
[16:12] what restore all that the denominations
[16:15] eat off restore all that the go uh the
[16:17] organization eat off I will restore
[16:20] sayeth the Lord now basically he's
[16:23] telling us we're
[16:25] Invincible we cannot
[16:27] die hello now he said there is no such a
[16:31] thing as a spiritual death now to a
[16:34] baptized saint of God though he were yet
[16:37] dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth
[16:41] and believeth in me shall never die all
[16:44] scripture it must be fulfilled see you
[16:47] can't die you've got eternal life only
[16:51] thing the Redeemer has made you
[16:53] recognize it and you were always that
[16:56] and that's the reason you see here it is
[16:59] is the day you're living in can you see
[17:02] the day you're living in he said that's
[17:03] the reason you see it because God Amen
[17:07] has has come and you are redeemable amen
[17:11] not just save
[17:13] redeemable right how many see it yes sir
[17:18] he said raise your hand thank you see
[17:20] the day we're living in you recognized
[17:22] it oh you recognized it how you
[17:25] recognized
[17:26] it understand every messenger comes at
[17:30] the end of every
[17:32] age hello now if there was such thing
[17:36] the end of a bride age we'll know that
[17:38] Jesus will be coming
[17:40] soon but the seven Church age brother
[17:43] brandham comes at the end of it and at
[17:46] the end of what we call let's say trior
[17:50] prior to the translation who
[17:52] comes
[17:54] Jesus right because he is The Headstone
[17:57] he is the capping off of of this age not
[18:00] this just age but the whole body
[18:04] amen I love this the first should be
[18:07] last and the last should be first amen
[18:12] it goes on and I'm going to read a few
[18:13] little things if that's okay he said but
[18:15] the birth the new birth that come by
[18:17] Christ cannot
[18:19] die see that's why the devil don't want
[18:21] you to get it he knows if you don't you
[18:23] he said like I said I read that quote
[18:25] last week he don't care if you come to
[18:26] church he don't care if you pay your ti
[18:28] he don't care if you be nice he don't
[18:30] care if you be sweet he doesn't care
[18:32] amen if you do all these nice Pious
[18:35] thing he doesn't care you can be a sweet
[18:37] as a Catholic
[18:40] priest he doesn't care he'll let you be
[18:43] all of that so that you'll miss
[18:47] Heaven the only way you'll make it to
[18:50] Heaven is to be born again am that's
[18:53] what he told Nicodemus that was one of
[18:55] his first doctrines every man woman boy
[18:59] or whatever it may be must be born again
[19:03] child that one tree and the other
[19:07] tree see and this tree though it been
[19:11] persecuted oh I love this made fun of
[19:15] since the very beginning of the Garden
[19:16] of Eden it cannot die amen it's
[19:20] predestinated it's been cloved and beat
[19:23] and my everything done to it and what
[19:25] happened it cannot die am he his he will
[19:30] not die he can't because he's holding in
[19:33] him the predestinated word of God it has
[19:36] to come forth for his fruit is in his
[19:39] own season
[19:42] predestinated season hello so let me put
[19:45] it this way each and every one of us be
[19:47] part of the Bride each every one of us
[19:50] are a tree and each and every one of us
[19:52] have seasons to bring forth his fruit
[19:57] amen y'all hear what I'm saying we don't
[19:59] all bring it forth in the same season
[20:02] some trees ripen before the others oh
[20:05] come on
[20:06] somebody you see it's like this you know
[20:09] the devil can't kill you how many times
[20:11] you thought you was
[20:14] dead and God resurrected you come on
[20:16] somebody amen some of us we may not have
[20:19] been backsliding or going back amen so
[20:22] people can physically see it but I don't
[20:25] know a man who's never
[20:27] backsliding
[20:29] even your Prophet said he
[20:31] did he said we backslide every day oh
[20:35] come on somebody it's a true but why
[20:38] didn't you stay that way something on
[20:40] the inside of you by because that seed
[20:42] in you cannot die
[20:46] amen God word must come to pass even in
[20:51] your life
[20:53] amen he thought he killed Abel and up
[20:57] comes Seth
[21:00] Hallelujah I can see the war folks I can
[21:02] see the war amen I can see it he thought
[21:04] oh I'm a winner now and he s say no it
[21:07] ain't ain't over yet amen and when Seth
[21:10] went off the scene he thought it was all
[21:12] over and then here come he not
[21:15] hallelujah amen and then he walked you
[21:18] see what I'm saying every time the devil
[21:20] thought he had the church here come God
[21:23] up
[21:24] again right he thought he had
[21:27] Samson But Here Comes Samson all over
[21:30] again see that's how it is what it is he
[21:33] failed to see it we can take some good
[21:35] knockout punches we can take a few
[21:37] beatings but we cannot
[21:42] die there's something in us which is God
[21:45] himself that will not let us die
[21:48] hallelujah oh God how many times I don't
[21:50] know I mean it's been a long time years
[21:53] now since I've laid across the bed and
[21:54] wish I could give up the
[21:56] ghost maybe y'all have never been that
[21:58] down before but I I've been there years
[22:01] and years ago but I was there she laying
[22:04] there Lord take it Lord take up the
[22:08] ghost it just don't happen that amen why
[22:13] because when God got a purpose for you
[22:16] you might as well face it you're not
[22:18] going anywhere is that right until he's
[22:22] finished with you now let me move on he
[22:24] said now remember this Christ in the
[22:27] true church is a continuation of the
[22:29] book of Acts we've heard that so many
[22:31] times but the Book of Revelation shows
[22:34] how that the Antichrist Spirit would
[22:36] come into the church and defile it
[22:39] making it lukewarm I want you to listen
[22:42] to this folks so that you can realize
[22:44] what's fighting us it's not people in
[22:46] the flesh it's
[22:51] Spirits right listen what how he describ
[22:54] this Antichrist Spirit he says now the
[22:57] Book of Revelation shows us shows how
[23:00] that the Antichrist Spirit would come
[23:02] into the church and defile it making it
[23:05] lukewarm formal and
[23:11] Powerless and if he can't do it uh
[23:13] collectively he does it
[23:16] individually right he does he finds US
[23:19] lukewarm when you get lukewarm you get
[23:21] formal when you get former you're
[23:24] powerless what it exposes Satan
[23:28] revealing his works and how does that
[23:31] happen when you
[23:33] disbelieve somewhere disbelief is in
[23:35] your life and so when you disbelieve
[23:39] amen God can't work with you amen he
[23:41] can't he just can't do it
[23:45] right it exposes Satan revealing his
[23:48] Works attempted destruction of God's
[23:51] people and the discrediting of God's
[23:53] word see what I'm saying right down to
[23:56] the time he is cast into the Lake of
[23:58] Fire he fights that he cannot stand it
[24:02] he knows that if the people gets the F
[24:05] true revelation of the true church and
[24:08] what she is and what she stands for and
[24:11] that she can do the Greater Works she
[24:14] will be an invincible Army if they get a
[24:18] true revelation of the two Spirits
[24:20] within the framework of the Christian
[24:22] church and by God's spirit discern
[24:25] listen and withstand the Antichrist
[24:29] Spirit Satan will be powerless before
[24:33] her and that's the point that's where we
[24:36] are here amen you know it got to take
[24:39] more than a a preacher or a pastor to
[24:42] discern that there's a spirit that comes
[24:45] in working with us every service
[24:49] amen every service it's not enough to to
[24:52] discern it you got to withstand it amen
[24:56] that means if the devil trying to make
[24:58] formal and cold and quiet in church you
[25:01] need to do something withstand
[25:04] it
[25:06] hallu it's not putting on it's it's it's
[25:09] turning on amen that's right it's
[25:13] turning on that energy that power that's
[25:15] on the inside of you and say I will not
[25:18] settle for this it's got to be more than
[25:21] just one man come on somebody everybody
[25:23] in here got to look at this thing and
[25:25] say hey something's wrong don't feel
[25:27] like no fire up in
[25:30] here y'all know what I'm saying and you
[25:33] and I must look at this thing and charge
[25:36] at it oh you feel ridiculous because the
[25:39] devil will be right there to make sure
[25:40] you feel ridiculous but press through
[25:45] that you have to press through it Satan
[25:48] will be powerless before her he will be
[25:51] as definitely toward today as when
[25:53] Christ witho every effort to gain power
[25:56] over him in the desert yes Satan hates
[26:00] Revelation but we love it amen with true
[26:03] Revelation in our lives the Gates of
[26:05] Hell cannot Prevail against us but we
[26:08] will prevail over them how when you
[26:10] recognize who you are and the power that
[26:13] God has given you the invested I cannot
[26:16] die so when sat I don't care if there's
[26:18] a thousand demon in in an individual and
[26:21] you're one man you are more powerful
[26:24] than the Thousand demons Jesus has
[26:26] already proved it amen
[26:29] he faced Legion and don't you think
[26:32] Legion wasn't a set up of the devil but
[26:35] when that devil understood the
[26:38] opposition he went to screaming
[26:40] Hallelujah Lucifer you didn't tell me it
[26:42] was him who I was going to have to deal
[26:43] with amen and I'm going tell you
[26:46] something he started screaming oh my
[26:48] have you come to torment us before our
[26:51] time so the devil knows they going to be
[26:56] tormented and don't don't you know amen
[26:59] if Jesus was able to torment the devil's
[27:01] then we can torment him now I like that
[27:03] yesterday amen because we're so used to
[27:05] the devil tormenting us we need to start
[27:07] tormenting him oh I thought about it I
[27:10] thought about that might have got a
[27:11] little fanatical cuz I thought to myself
[27:13] I need to go up in a restaurant and say
[27:14] praise the
[27:16] Lord torment a few of them Devils
[27:20] amen amen cuz they don't care coming in
[27:23] messing up our our services or whatever
[27:25] amen let's
[27:27] move
[27:29] I'll never forget it when I was in Al
[27:31] Ohio and that man come in that
[27:32] restaurant he's screaming to the top of
[27:34] his voice now they would have put me out
[27:36] if IID went in there praising the Lord
[27:37] and shouting dancing amen they put me
[27:39] out but he kept running and getting into
[27:41] people are you a
[27:43] bucker are you a buck are you and I'm
[27:47] thinking they have put me
[27:50] out but this was a this was a fanen for
[27:53] Ohio State and nobody said anything but
[27:56] just cheered on with it
[28:01] but if I would have in there and said
[28:03] are you a Christian are you a oh my old
[28:07] devil you better not give me no
[28:10] ideas hallelujah amen because really we
[28:13] ought to be at a place right now amen
[28:16] that we ought to be looking for that
[28:18] last seed here in Iowa and the only way
[28:21] you can do that is search the highways
[28:23] the byways the bushes everywhere and
[28:25] maybe we need to ask that question are
[28:27] you a Christan
[28:29] Christian you will recall that I
[28:31] mentioned at the beginning of this
[28:32] message that this book were we are
[28:34] studying is the actual revelation of
[28:36] Jesus
[28:38] Christ exposition of the Christ is what
[28:40] it is he said uh uh himself in the
[28:45] church and his work in the future ages
[28:47] then I mentioned that it takes the Holy
[28:49] Spirit to give us Revelation or will we
[28:51] fail to get
[28:53] it that's why so many people can walk
[28:55] out here and not even understand and
[28:56] they think they do I say so many but
[29:00] nevertheless bringing these two thoughts
[29:02] together you will see that it won't take
[29:04] just ordinary study and thinking to make
[29:07] this book real it is going to take the
[29:11] operation of the Holy Ghost amen that
[29:14] means this book can't be revealed to
[29:16] anyone but a special class of
[29:19] people elect lady is a special class of
[29:24] people it would take one with prophetic
[29:27] insight it will require the ability to
[29:30] hear from God it will require
[29:33] Supernatural instructions not just a
[29:36] student comparing verses with verses
[29:38] though that is good but a mystery
[29:41] requires the teaching of the whole of
[29:43] the spirit or it'll never become clear
[29:46] how we need to hear from God Amen see it
[29:51] doesn't matter see and and lay ourselves
[29:53] he said how we need to hear from God and
[29:55] lay ourselves open and become yielded to
[29:59] the spirit to hear and to know amen see
[30:04] I hey the denomination that that they
[30:07] compare scripture and it's pretty good
[30:08] they can do pretty good with it but it
[30:10] ain't that it's Revelation it's God
[30:13] revealing to you by the word through the
[30:16] word so that you can have instructions
[30:19] in your life see what I'm saying now we
[30:22] went by the grace of God and we taught
[30:24] talked about how uh the statue of obey a
[30:28] Christ in
[30:30] you and and my point
[30:33] is how many people you
[30:36] know not only talk about it but are
[30:39] pressing into
[30:44] it the devil don't care how how many M
[30:46] Mysteries you know Paul said you can
[30:49] understand all Mysteries and you miss it
[30:52] so the devil don't care about
[30:54] that he looking if he can hinder you
[30:58] comeing The Life of Christ he got
[31:01] you see that's the important that's the
[31:03] emphasis because remember that's what
[31:05] Adam lost amen that's why Jesus died to
[31:09] return his life back to us
[31:14] amen if you don't want that you're
[31:16] wasting your
[31:17] time that should be your goal God give
[31:20] me your life I want to see see because
[31:23] that is the token it ain't blood it
[31:25] ain't chemistry it ain't nothing like
[31:27] that it is the life of the blood which
[31:30] is the Life of Christ which is God am in
[31:33] you and
[31:36] I and it's something that you can't
[31:39] fake yes sir it's got to be real the
[31:43] only way that you can ever get that is
[31:45] to have a real birth I know it you
[31:48] listen to uh
[31:51] uh the either future home or choosing of
[31:54] a bride brother brand say the only kind
[31:56] the word can bring forth is those acts
[31:57] to 38 screaming holling babies now
[32:00] that's all he
[32:04] said he says it in so many places in so
[32:07] many ways but you know people don't want
[32:10] that but let me put it this way as I got
[32:13] it in my notes and I'm going to be long
[32:14] I'm going try not to be the Rapture is
[32:16] only for the
[32:18] bride that's
[32:20] it it's only for the bride right now
[32:24] brother bam goes on and says listen it's
[32:26] always at the third at the end of the
[32:28] third day that God makes himself
[32:31] manifest or visible right he said early
[32:34] in the morning when Jesus was RA risen
[32:36] from the dead he said when he rose from
[32:38] the dead his raising from the dead
[32:41] became a
[32:42] rumor but at the end of that third day
[32:46] he had gathered all of his disciples
[32:49] together and made himself
[32:51] visible plain to them oh come on
[32:55] somebody amen so you got to realize by
[32:58] the grace of God where we are with this
[33:00] thing not only did God make himself
[33:03] visible through a prophet amen but God's
[33:06] getting ready to make himself visible
[33:08] through a bride at the end of this thing
[33:11] and it's approaching rapidly
[33:15] amen it's approaching rapidly right now
[33:17] it's just a
[33:20] rumor amen but God going to do some
[33:23] mighty things in US
[33:26] amen the Rapture that we're talking
[33:29] about is only for the bride remember and
[33:33] the rest of the Dead live not for a
[33:35] thousand years this great Rapture if
[33:39] there's not a Rapture friends where are
[33:42] we at what are we doing what are we
[33:45] going to do what are what age are we
[33:48] living in what promise do we have there
[33:51] is going to be a Rapture the Bible says
[33:54] there will be and it'll be the only for
[33:57] the
[33:59] elected the elected lady the bride in
[34:02] this day that pulls out the
[34:06] church the very word means call out of
[34:10] as Moses called a nation out of a Nation
[34:12] the holy spirit is calling a bride out
[34:14] of a church a church out of a church
[34:17] members members from every denomination
[34:19] making up a bride bride tree is that
[34:22] right in the tape the bride tree a bride
[34:25] coming out called and that's the one
[34:27] that that the bride tree is the bride
[34:29] rather is the one that is going to be in
[34:32] the Rapture that alone nothing but the
[34:35] bride the elected ones for known by God
[34:38] from the beginning the father spiritual
[34:42] genes wo listen the father spiritual
[34:56] genes this message is so
[34:59] great it wasn't done in a
[35:02] corner I remember talking with brother
[35:05] Tom Brown and sister Marilyn they were
[35:07] there when brother Brandon was teaching
[35:09] the seven Church
[35:12] ages and uh when he had drawn out the
[35:17] seven
[35:19] stages they were there when the pill of
[35:21] fire see nobody can't take it from a lot
[35:24] of people's heart because they was there
[35:25] how you going to tell them right they
[35:28] saw the PFI come and draw it out on the
[35:30] wall I can't imagine what that would
[35:33] have done to
[35:35] me I can't imagine what that would have
[35:38] done to me to see that happen amen and
[35:42] not only that remember it wasn't just on
[35:44] the wall God displayed it in the heavens
[35:46] as
[35:47] well right science caught the same
[35:53] stages come on
[35:55] somebody and these people trying to to
[35:57] say oh let me not even go there my point
[36:00] is it's it's only for selected people
[36:02] people and my point is when you see
[36:05] yourself standing you ought to be
[36:06] jumping about now somewhere just to
[36:09] think that you're one of
[36:13] them how many of us here tonight can say
[36:16] I merited
[36:17] that none of
[36:21] us it's unmar
[36:24] Grace brother brandom said it was so
[36:26] unmar that God slipped a wedding band a
[36:30] marriage band on you before the
[36:31] foundation of the world the wedding band
[36:34] I came into this world wearing
[36:36] [Laughter]
[36:39] one come on somebody he call it
[36:43] predestination huh we're blessed people
[36:47] yes and once we get to a place to
[36:50] realize amen that all of us are
[36:52] different but yet the
[36:54] same right God ain't got no cookie
[36:57] cutters
[36:58] amen oh come on somebody and some of us
[37:01] going to be doing different acting
[37:02] different whatever the case may be but
[37:04] that ain't it the point is is the life
[37:08] there that's what I'm saying is the life
[37:11] of Jesus Christ in there and if it's so
[37:14] listen it may not be to a mature state
[37:16] but you can see it growing you can see
[37:18] it moving Hallelujah and Lord God you
[37:21] know in your on your knees you know how
[37:22] to cry for it right that's exactly right
[37:26] that's one thing I I I've noticed I've
[37:28] learned about my grandbabies when they
[37:29] want something they know how to scream
[37:31] for
[37:33] it right now looking coming from amen
[37:37] the message Shalom I hope y'all don't
[37:39] mind this Darkness this L to see in
[37:42] church age now when Jesus which is the
[37:44] word in the lery and church age was on
[37:46] the outside of the church knocking at
[37:48] the door trying to get in darkness grows
[37:51] Darkness upon the people now he here
[37:54] brother brandom is taking his experience
[37:58] of what was happening to him with the
[38:01] Pentecostals remember he said now when
[38:03] he went out to Arizona he said I've been
[38:05] out here three years three and a half
[38:07] years he said and none of my brothers
[38:09] invited me what house you build me
[38:12] speaking about that he said none of my
[38:14] brothers out here invited me to come
[38:16] preach for him but here is perig
[38:18] green God has anointed him to build a
[38:22] tabernacle brother said I didn't tell
[38:24] him to do it this was God's doing right
[38:28] God wanted me to preach or have me to
[38:30] preach somewhere and what was God doing
[38:33] since they would not open to them they
[38:36] were now experiencing
[38:41] vasty the Judgment of
[38:44] vasty versus the Judgment of Queen
[38:49] Esther see because what we failed to see
[38:52] that whole that whole that whole thing
[38:55] about uh es that that that that was
[38:58] prophecy end time prophecy of what would
[39:01] happen even to the bride here we find
[39:04] out that that the denomination T dasty
[39:07] and she rejected the prophet of that her
[39:09] day and here's some
[39:11] nobodies Hallelujah brother BR talks
[39:14] about Billy grab and or Roberts and how
[39:16] their class of people were so up the
[39:18] up part of the who's who's all of that
[39:22] he said and then you turn around and see
[39:24] my group when they group went out he
[39:25] come mine and crutches and wheelchairs
[39:27] and everything else pulling themselves
[39:29] into the
[39:31] auditorium that's just like Jesus amen
[39:35] Ain it like him I know y'all don't know
[39:36] what I'm talking about but anyway we
[39:38] look at this thing and you say well
[39:39] brother Brooks look at us
[39:46] now ain't got no piano
[39:49] play Ain't Got No getar player come on
[39:52] somebody we ain't got no stained
[39:55] Windows Hallelujah let me preach man let
[39:58] me preach and take my
[40:00] thunder so the thing about it is we got
[40:04] God on the inside we got the greatest
[40:08] thing
[40:13] ever oh Lord have
[40:16] mercy he goes on to say the Perfection
[40:19] of the scriptures Glory of his great
[40:22] name the pope visit us was assigned to
[40:24] the church blackening out the man uh
[40:26] blackening out the manifestation light
[40:28] of the world was the Bible Jesus said he
[40:31] was the light of the world the Bible
[40:32] said he is the word and the
[40:34] manifestation or the Vindication
[40:36] scripture is the light now you'll not be
[40:39] permitted to do when it when it takes a
[40:41] hole and we're seen it for shadow now
[40:44] what is he saying and and
[40:46] we I can I say it I'm saying this so
[40:49] that you and I can understand by the
[40:51] grace of God is that God comes
[40:55] alone and he Paces you in a gross
[40:58] Darkness I preach this let there be
[41:00] light right so that you could understand
[41:02] amen that right now there's Darkness if
[41:04] it was gross darkness in 60s where do
[41:06] you think it is
[41:08] now because you got to understand
[41:10] there's still some light in the world
[41:12] and Satan hates it so this Darkness amen
[41:16] is now aiming itself to put out all the
[41:20] light y'all hear what I'm saying it's
[41:23] now focusing is the word I meant
[41:25] focusing on the light which is you and
[41:29] me and everybody that believe this
[41:31] message and he's going to do any and
[41:33] everything he can do to put out the
[41:36] light but guess what it's
[41:42] impossible it's impossible it's like a
[41:45] boy taking a slingshot looking up in the
[41:48] sky and said I'm gonna put one of those
[41:50] Starlights
[41:52] out how
[41:54] ridiculous but that's basically what
[41:56] Satan thinks that he can literally take
[41:59] this thing and put the light out in your
[42:03] life but brother brandom said it like
[42:05] this if God started the fire in you
[42:08] it'll never go
[42:15] out now I'm I'm I'm trying to hurry
[42:17] because I I can see you're tired he says
[42:22] now now notice where we where where
[42:25] whether we're in the last days a last
[42:27] age or not now we find out if we turn
[42:30] back to Genesis about oh about the fifth
[42:32] chapter you can turn also to Luke and
[42:34] find out Enoch was the seventh from Noah
[42:37] right the catches is the serpent seed
[42:40] there catches the serpent seed for if
[42:42] Cain was Abel's son then he would have
[42:44] been the eighth but nowhere in the Bible
[42:46] it said that Cain was Abel's son Cain
[42:49] was the Adam's son because that's uh
[42:53] Cain was not uh he working was was not
[42:55] Adam's son because the Bible said he was
[42:58] of the evil one Adam wasn't the evil one
[43:02] see it was the evil one now we find out
[43:05] that Enoch was a seven from from Noah
[43:08] which was the type of the church ages
[43:10] now all of the rest of the six men
[43:12] before him died but Enoch was translated
[43:16] Enoch was raptured the seventh is that
[43:19] right showing that it's the seven Church
[43:21] a that taks the Rapture amen hallelujah
[43:25] so if we can see that it's the seven
[43:27] Church AE that makes the Rapture Where
[43:29] Do We Stand
[43:32] now we're in a place where God is
[43:35] getting ready to take a abide out of
[43:37] here and you and I must be Rapture Ready
[43:42] amen is that all right oh come on
[43:45] somebody I heard another voice like
[43:47] Revelation 18 says come out of her my
[43:50] people and be not partakers of what her
[43:53] sin that you be not partakers of her sin
[43:57] and that you receive not her
[44:00] plag is that right so you and I must
[44:03] recognize that we're in a position amen
[44:07] that God is calling and this is
[44:09] happening University universally amen
[44:12] people everywhere to a word to a message
[44:15] and this message is get ready amen
[44:19] because the fire is getting ready to
[44:22] fall you say oh brother books there's so
[44:25] many people here I I've got people who
[44:26] say don't even want to hear hear that
[44:29] this thing going to go down because they
[44:30] believe that it's going to last forever
[44:33] if I could talk to somebody in capernium
[44:35] I'm sure they would say the same thing
[44:36] if I could have an interview with him I
[44:38] believe they' say well you know we
[44:39] thought capernium was going to last for
[44:41] if what if I could talk to somebody who
[44:43] was in Pompei when it went down come on
[44:45] somebody amen you know the people in
[44:46] Sodom they thought the same
[44:49] thing the world of old thought the same
[44:52] thing and Noah tried to prove it to him
[44:54] but they would not listen because they
[44:56] couldn't see it with there are
[44:57] naturalized I can't see what he talking
[45:00] about right it ain't there it is
[45:03] spiritually discerned come on somebody
[45:05] if the birds know when to
[45:08] move
[45:11] Hall you take a old Gander all he's got
[45:14] to do is honk his horn Hallelujah and
[45:16] all those geese will start Gathering why
[45:18] they know of the voice of a
[45:23] leader oh Lord y'all hear what I'm
[45:26] saying
[45:28] that's why Jesus said my sheep will hear
[45:31] my voice and a stranger they will not
[45:37] follow this is not the age of where it
[45:40] is because Jesus said in the Book of
[45:42] Revelation the third chapter Le the SE
[45:44] will be rich increase with good and have
[45:46] need of nothing and look at look what's
[45:48] happening to the churches it's a
[45:50] Prosperity Gospel not even getting them
[45:52] ready they they they teaching them how
[45:53] to live here on Earth why it's going to
[45:55] pass you going to die someday we need to
[45:59] be taught how to live
[46:02] Hereafter and Jesus said you must be
[46:04] born again come on somebody it's the
[46:06] truth you've heard me say this so many
[46:10] times you didn't come here by some alien
[46:12] plane or some boat or some kind of trip
[46:14] thing they saying in Hollywood you came
[46:17] here by God's creation Let There Be am
[46:20] right you were born into this world and
[46:23] how do you get into the other world you
[46:26] got to be born
[46:27] born you will not be
[46:31] transplanted right you've got to be born
[46:33] again right because the Bible said when
[46:36] Jesus met Nicodemus and Nicodemus Mar
[46:39] not you must be born again that which is
[46:41] his flesh is flesh and that which is
[46:43] spirit Spirit that's why people hate the
[46:46] Holy Ghost that's why the devil want to
[46:48] say it ain't real there's nothing to it
[46:50] you can shout dance speak in tongues and
[46:52] all of that and they say oh you got that
[46:54] ain't it it is the true life of God
[46:57] cuz Satan can mimic all of that I'm not
[47:00] saying the Holy Ghost don't do that I'm
[47:02] saying Satan can mimic that and deceive
[47:05] many come on somebody they can do all of
[47:08] that and live like a devil and say they
[47:09] got
[47:10] it let me move on ghost dogness blinding
[47:13] of Israel was the lightning of the
[47:15] Gentiles that's right now the blinding
[47:17] of the Gentiles is the lightning of the
[47:19] Israel it's just like the day and night
[47:22] one side has got darkness and the other
[47:25] side has got light and look what's
[47:27] happening the gospel has come all the
[47:29] way to the West when Isuzu Street
[47:32] started amen what was that that was that
[47:35] gospel that was the beginning of this
[47:36] thing starting but after that West it
[47:38] goes back to the East look at America
[47:41] now we're
[47:44] dark come on somebody darkness is upon
[47:47] us look at the people they're groping
[47:50] people they're groping they don't even
[47:51] know who they are what they are they're
[47:53] groping feeling their way they've gotten
[47:56] to a place they don't don't even want to
[47:57] hear God in their knowledge that's the
[48:00] scripture but look over on the east side
[48:03] they have a Revival God is even
[48:06] appearing Amen to the Palestinians and
[48:08] everything proving himself to be Jesus
[48:11] Christ the same yesterday to day and
[48:12] forever why cuz we're getting ready for
[48:14] a Rapture we're getting ready for a
[48:17] change of body come on somebody amen
[48:20] they laugh at it they scoff at it but
[48:22] we're Witnesses am he's the same
[48:25] yesterday today and forever
[48:28] Oh Glory to God is that all right now
[48:32] look Gentile Church age is finished and
[48:36] we we don't see it you know what's
[48:39] happening now it's only the bride the
[48:41] foolish virgins amen they they roaming
[48:44] out there and they they don't have
[48:45] enough oil they know it but they don't
[48:47] know where to go they believe in God but
[48:51] they don't have the strength they don't
[48:53] have the power they don't have the light
[48:55] Hallelujah but there was five wives amen
[48:58] who had oil and extra oil she knew who
[49:02] she was and she knew where the door was
[49:05] right because without the light you
[49:07] can't find the door somehow they found
[49:10] the door but when they found the door
[49:12] the Bible said they
[49:13] came right and the door was shut who was
[49:17] the door the Lord Jesus Christ he said I
[49:19] am the door right they came to a
[49:22] revelation that Jesus Christ is not
[49:24] Methodist he's not Baptist he's not
[49:27] Catholic he's not Presbyterian he's not
[49:29] Pentecostal he's the word amen that's
[49:32] who Jesus Christ is in the beginning was
[49:35] the word the word was with God and the
[49:37] Word was God he did not have such a
[49:39] brand on
[49:41] him he wouldn't even associate with the
[49:43] Pharisees and the Sadducees of his day
[49:46] he was the
[49:49] word and because you put him in a
[49:51] category doesn't mean that's the same
[49:54] Jesus talked here because we know that
[49:56] every organization in denomination
[49:58] strips
[50:01] him it don't mean that today not like
[50:05] today you understand me I I don't mean
[50:08] to be rough I'm just trying my best to
[50:10] to to to to to Anchor the word into the
[50:13] seed of the heart of of the believer is
[50:16] that all
[50:17] right the church is making itself ready
[50:21] being being making herself ready for a
[50:23] time is a time for the rapture for
[50:26] darkness is fading upon the Gentiles and
[50:29] Dawn will soon break upon the Jews y'all
[50:31] believe that amen I do why is everybody
[50:35] accusing the Jews do you really believe
[50:37] that's the truth come on that same
[50:40] spirit amen accused Jesus and called him
[50:43] the as
[50:44] above right you can't believe like I
[50:47] told you remember I think it was my wife
[50:49] and I we were in England I know I was
[50:51] there for sure I was in England and I
[50:53] saw Obama and and the pope
[50:55] together a year a whole year before they
[51:00] put that news clipping on our
[51:03] Channel same thing so what I'm saying is
[51:07] America believe it or not you're behind
[51:09] time when it comes to the
[51:13] news my point is amen it ain't that we
[51:16] got to listen to that to believe we know
[51:19] the sign and the season that we're
[51:21] living in y'all hear what I'm saying now
[51:24] let's move on by the grace of God
[51:26] because you got to realize why is this
[51:28] attack now I want you to I want you to
[51:30] think about this because Israel is our
[51:32] time piece we can see because what
[51:35] happened is when God is done with the
[51:38] Gentiles he goes back to the Jews
[51:39] they're looking for Moses and Elijah
[51:41] right the two prophets but we realize
[51:43] amen the anointing of God the power of
[51:46] God Is
[51:48] Lifting lifting off of the earth y'all
[51:51] remember I I don't know how long some of
[51:54] y'all been a Christian but I could
[51:55] remember you know when we would come to
[51:56] church the power of God would be all on
[51:58] the on the on the on the um outside of
[52:01] the church you could hardly wait to get
[52:02] in you was no such thing as being
[52:05] laid you couldn't be laid in that day
[52:07] you wouldn't have a seed look at it now
[52:10] people just dragging in I got to go back
[52:11] to church again H you see what I'm
[52:13] saying it the the anointing is no longer
[52:16] there the word hasn't
[52:18] changed but the hearts of the people had
[52:22] they've left their first love worldism
[52:25] has come in it got so many many other
[52:27] things to to to pledge give them
[52:29] pleasure one time it was all God that
[52:31] gave us pleasure we love church so much
[52:33] we could hardly
[52:35] standing you see what I'm saying and now
[52:38] amen God is now secondary of whatever it
[52:41] a it won't work that
[52:44] way it's I hope that's okay now let's
[52:48] move on and this is what has happened
[52:50] because we find out by the grace of God
[52:52] remember Mo uh uh Mary and Joseph Mary
[52:56] and Joseph at the
[52:59] feast and they leave and then they find
[53:02] out that Jesus is not with
[53:04] them right so you got to realize amen
[53:08] there's a lot of Christians who was at
[53:10] the feast and they left thinking Jesus
[53:13] was with them and they get down the road
[53:16] and they find out Jesus is not with
[53:19] them they turn back around and they find
[53:22] Jesus among the elders
[53:24] teaching and Mary who had a supernatural
[53:27] visitation from God comes along and said
[53:30] Jesus don't you know my your father and
[53:33] I oh hold
[53:35] up Jesus said my I'm about my father's
[53:39] business how can Mary call Joseph Jesus
[53:42] father she did it at that moment she
[53:45] literally denounced the supernatural
[53:48] visitation that she had from the angel
[53:52] Gabriel and him being the word corrected
[53:55] her and said woman he didn't even say
[53:58] mother he said woman know ye not that
[54:01] I'm about my father's
[54:03] business and she never said another word
[54:07] cu the word will always correct the
[54:12] error and what has happened is a lot of
[54:16] people have gone
[54:17] off
[54:19] assuming that Jesus is still with
[54:23] them we're living in a time that God
[54:26] comes along we call it the Third Exodus
[54:28] right the first Exodus was Noah's day
[54:31] Exodus from 2 Exodus was in Moses day
[54:35] amen and the Third Exodus is now come
[54:39] out of her my people be not partakers of
[54:41] her sin come on somebody now you got to
[54:44] recognize that this church world the way
[54:47] it looks now amen you think they going
[54:49] into heaven doing all of
[54:51] that and must I explain come on somebody
[54:54] the truth is the truth some of the moves
[54:57] they're doing I used to do when I was in
[54:58] the
[54:59] club now you can't dance for Jesus and
[55:01] God doing the same
[55:06] stuff I don't care if you say Jesus to
[55:09] it it doesn't mean it's
[55:12] Jesus am I making sense see this way is
[55:17] straight and narrow the Bible said only
[55:19] a few be that find
[55:21] it you got to want
[55:23] it you got to be chosen
[55:26] not by me but by God is that all right
[55:29] now Joseph amen what was a type of
[55:36] Christ is that
[55:38] right you got to realize by the grace of
[55:41] God how he was uh father gave him a
[55:45] coat of many
[55:48] colors and uh I don't even know whether
[55:51] this daddy understood what those colors
[55:53] was all about but it was a
[55:55] covenant maybe he was thinking about the
[55:57] Covenant that that God gave Noah when he
[56:01] put it in the
[56:04] rainbow but understand every color has
[56:06] virtue oh Jesus Peter call him Peter
[56:10] caught it and he put it in order after
[56:13] your faith cuz blue means strength right
[56:17] he goes all the way up to the ladder
[56:19] Faith virtue knowledge temples all the
[56:21] way up he caught the virtues of that
[56:23] rainbow and says listen this is the
[56:25] divine nature of God you say Hey brother
[56:28] Brook is that true you find out in
[56:30] Revelation the Bible said he sat there
[56:33] Jesus himself with a rainbow above his
[56:35] head what was it the same character The
[56:38] Same Spirit the Holy Ghost the same
[56:41] power and strength of the Holy Ghost
[56:43] will always be with us throughout
[56:45] eternity
[56:46] amen so Joseph comes down and we
[56:49] understand he's a perfect type of Christ
[56:52] I'm saying all these things so you can
[56:53] understand where we're standing he comes
[56:55] along and he's a perfect type of Christ
[56:58] he's betrayed by his brother he's hated
[57:00] of his brother he's thrown into the
[57:01] ditch like Jesus was thrown into the
[57:03] grave he raised up amen he's now thrown
[57:05] into prison amen there in Egypt part of
[57:08] a wife tried to take him amen and strip
[57:10] him of his virtue huh come on somebody
[57:13] and that's what denominationalism will
[57:15] do for you will strip you of your
[57:17] virtue you know the word of God don't
[57:19] mean all of that and you don't have to
[57:22] do that no more I mean that was for
[57:25] yesterday and Jesus Christ said he's the
[57:27] same yesterday today and forever he's a
[57:29] God that changes not so we come to a
[57:32] place and we find out amen he comes
[57:34] along and God is doing this great thing
[57:37] and now he's in in prison and he's
[57:39] interpreting the dreams of the but and
[57:42] the
[57:42] vaker the two thieves on the cross one
[57:45] die and the other one is free Hallelujah
[57:48] come on and then shortly after that
[57:50] Jesus is raised to what the right hand
[57:53] and this is where Joseph comes he's now
[57:55] at pharaoh right now watch this in the
[57:58] time that Joseph is in in power who is
[58:01] Jesus Christ himself he's in power now
[58:05] and now there it switches from Egypt to
[58:12] Israel right now it switches from Egypt
[58:16] before it was all about Joseph what he
[58:17] was going through how he had to do this
[58:19] how he did this what happened to him now
[58:22] when Joseph comes into Power who what
[58:25] happened it switches to Israel the
[58:27] concerns his daddy gets is old Benjamin
[58:32] has grown
[58:33] up famine in the land now they need help
[58:39] so now they got to go down to Egypt Lord
[58:43] for help and who do they find not
[58:46] immediately but Joseph recognizes his
[58:48] brothers y'all know the story
[58:52] now we realize this is exactly what's
[58:55] happening now this was prophecy this is
[58:58] what's happening now am amen when you
[59:00] saw those Jews out there and when they
[59:03] when they when they screamed out when
[59:05] they were persecuting uhhhh HH Jesus and
[59:09] he was being crucified and they said let
[59:11] his blood be on us and our children
[59:13] they've
[59:14] suffered they've suffered but God still
[59:18] with the tender hand of Jehovah drove
[59:20] them back amen oh come on somebody to
[59:23] the promised land and what is it is in
[59:26] shadowing type Benjamin has come to
[59:28] maturity oh Lord amen and that was
[59:32] Joseph interest he wasn't interest in
[59:34] Ruben and all the others when he said is
[59:37] your father living and how is Benjamin
[59:40] amen right because listen and then when
[59:43] he catches up with them and they're in
[59:46] Egypt he takes them and he lays them oh
[59:49] God have mercy this is
[59:51] true because that's what the Millennium
[59:53] will do amen he'll set them all in
[59:56] order woo every tribe will be in order
[1:00:00] like Joseph set him at the table put
[1:00:02] them all in order but what did he do he
[1:00:05] gave a double portion to Benjamin and
[1:00:08] that word of God tells us amen I believe
[1:00:11] it says amen they'll be born in one day
[1:00:13] Hallelujah come on somebody and they'll
[1:00:16] ask where did we get where when they see
[1:00:18] the Messiah they're going to say where
[1:00:20] did we get where did you get those scars
[1:00:22] he said in the house of my friends and
[1:00:24] they're going to realize they're the
[1:00:25] ones that crucified him Hallelujah the
[1:00:28] Gentile day is over then there's no more
[1:00:30] salvation for the Gentiles y'all y y
[1:00:35] amen but the truth of the matter is what
[1:00:38] did he do just prior to himself
[1:00:41] revealing
[1:00:43] himself to his Brethren the word of God
[1:00:46] tells us he dismissed his Gentile
[1:00:50] wife and that was a shadow and type of
[1:00:52] the
[1:00:54] Rapture so if you here and you on you
[1:00:57] hear CNN talking about Moses and
[1:00:59] Elijah you've missed it amen you've
[1:01:02] missed the
[1:01:07] Rapture you missed
[1:01:10] it because amen before he reveals
[1:01:13] himself to them as the Messiah and you
[1:01:16] better believe it it's so close now
[1:01:18] because that old Rabbi said that he had
[1:01:20] visions and he seen who Jesus Christ was
[1:01:24] and he said he was yes surea
[1:01:26] amen I hope I'm pronouncing it right
[1:01:28] amen they don't want to believe it but
[1:01:30] the truth of the M the truth of the
[1:01:32] matter is there are more Jews now coming
[1:01:35] into the reality that Jesus Christ is
[1:01:38] and was the
[1:01:42] Messiah what's happening now this little
[1:01:45] bride amen that looked like the scum of
[1:01:47] the earth is getting ready to take a
[1:01:49] Rapture Hallelujah you might not look
[1:01:53] like much but God is getting ready to
[1:01:54] translate us
[1:01:56] you're going to always look like
[1:02:02] nuts you're going to always look like
[1:02:04] nuts but that's what the man said if you
[1:02:06] don't have nuts in the machine it's
[1:02:08] ain't nothing but a whole bunch of
[1:02:12] yunk I couldn't help
[1:02:15] it that's true every machine got to have
[1:02:18] nuts once the world lose us it ain't
[1:02:21] going to be nothing but a whole bunch of
[1:02:23] junk hey nothing hold it together is
[1:02:26] that right that's the word it is the
[1:02:28] salt that holds it together Hallelujah
[1:02:30] and once this world loses its salt it's
[1:02:34] finish Oh Glory to God it's just
[1:02:37] okay amen I'm going have to quit I
[1:02:40] thought I was going to be able to finish
[1:02:41] it but
[1:02:46] uh if the seven Church AG is over which
[1:02:48] it
[1:02:52] is we've got to recognize we are in
[1:02:55] eternity
[1:02:56] see now you think you're time creatures
[1:02:58] but really you're not the truth of the
[1:03:01] matter is even when you go to sleep and
[1:03:04] you have a dream you
[1:03:08] travel you could call it Soul travail
[1:03:11] whatever you want to call it but you
[1:03:12] travel and then down the road you find
[1:03:15] yourself oh my goodness I've been here
[1:03:18] before they call it Deja
[1:03:21] Vu this is just a house for you
[1:03:25] Hallelujah come on somebody this is just
[1:03:28] a
[1:03:29] house and when you see that that's why
[1:03:31] the Bible said that God orders your
[1:03:33] steps through
[1:03:37] dreams and somehow when you wake up you
[1:03:40] know which way to go with it I don't
[1:03:43] understand it all but that's the
[1:03:48] word is that okay now the you're in an
[1:03:52] eternal
[1:03:54] age that means
[1:03:56] the Holy Ghost in
[1:03:58] you can't die it can't die you can't die
[1:04:02] you can't
[1:04:03] die amen once you you've died already to
[1:04:07] what yourself so you can't die and when
[1:04:10] the word of God was open the Seven Seals
[1:04:12] and all were open amen you know what it
[1:04:14] did it put you back into the place like
[1:04:16] I said this morning amen before Adam and
[1:04:20] Eve sin now that's where you are amen a
[1:04:26] you see cuz God's word cannot come back
[1:04:29] void God told Adam said whatever you do
[1:04:31] I want you to sedo everything what is
[1:04:33] your commission to sedo everything put
[1:04:36] everything under your feet pull down
[1:04:39] every stronghold Hallelujah you're right
[1:04:42] back in that place if you got the
[1:04:45] original Holy Ghost because there's a
[1:04:47] lot of fake ones out
[1:04:49] there but if you got the original it
[1:04:52] will bring forth the same Supernatural
[1:04:55] signs amen and wonders and most of all
[1:04:57] the same
[1:05:00] life some of you people that really
[1:05:03] believe this to be the truth that's
[1:05:05] we're entering in another age we're
[1:05:07] entering the Rapture age you know the
[1:05:09] church can't do it in this condition and
[1:05:12] it can't get any better it must get
[1:05:14] worse how many knows that that's right
[1:05:18] it it's not going to get better it's
[1:05:20] going to get worse so if this world is
[1:05:22] going to get worse what's going to
[1:05:23] happen to you
[1:05:26] see without that
[1:05:29] life you'll get worse evil seducers wax
[1:05:33] worse and worse oh come on that's the
[1:05:35] word but if the life of Jesus Christ in
[1:05:38] in you you get better amen the world
[1:05:41] gets worse and you get better the world

[1:05:47] that's how it's supposed to
[1:05:49] be the darker the night the brighter the
[1:05:53] Stars right and that's the way way it's
[1:05:55] supposed to be just prior to the coming
[1:05:58] of the
[1:05:59] Lord let me say this one more thought
[1:06:03] cuz I'll just have to finish it
[1:06:06] later when God gives you the Holy
[1:06:10] Ghost that's
[1:06:14] omnipotence that's all
[1:06:16] power he says all power in Heaven and
[1:06:19] Earth is given unto me but you shall
[1:06:21] receive power amen after which the Holy
[1:06:25] Ghost is coming upon you same power if
[1:06:28] that same Spirit be in you that was also
[1:06:30] in Christ Jesus as it Quicken his body
[1:06:32] it quickens what your moral body so he
[1:06:35] the same power because it's the same God
[1:06:39] in you doing the same Works
[1:06:44] amen oh come on people so my point is if
[1:06:49] God is omnipotent and in he's in you
[1:06:52] then what does it make you and when two
[1:06:54] omnipotents be something must
[1:06:58] happen right an

[1:09:37] finished with this message but because
[1:09:39] we've got communion I didn't want to
[1:09:40] take too much more time let me say it
[1:09:42] like this people the voice of God is
[1:09:45] being heard people are rejecting and
[1:09:49] that's where it's supposed to be when
[1:09:51] Jesus Christ came on the scene they
[1:09:54] called him beab
[1:09:56] most of the religion people called him
[1:09:59] beel and Jesus said I didn't even come
[1:10:01] to declare myself I came to declare the
[1:10:06] father he said the works that I do is
[1:10:08] not of my own he said I can't do nothing
[1:10:11] except the father show me
[1:10:14] Hello they said well well you're a devil
[1:10:16] you make it yourself you being a man
[1:10:18] make it yourself God oh what they fail
[1:10:21] to see was God making himself a
[1:10:24] man they had a Twist in and Jesus
[1:10:28] saidwell I tell you what he said' if you
[1:10:30] don't believe what I say look at the
[1:10:32] works can anybody charge me with
[1:10:36] unbelief is there any record around here
[1:10:39] that that I said anything would happen
[1:10:41] and it didn't happen no there's not one
[1:10:44] place you can say I called a man up from
[1:10:48] from being sick and it didn't happen
[1:10:50] everything I ever done happened just
[1:10:52] like I said can anybody charge me for
[1:10:55] unbelief but what if I I can tell you
[1:10:57] where you un you
[1:10:59] disbelieve see so we're at a day right
[1:11:01] now amen that you and I must recognize
[1:11:04] this and like for whatever reason God
[1:11:06] knows I say like this we're coming into
[1:11:09] a place that you and I must recognize
[1:11:12] amen that we're now in what we call a
[1:11:14] holy convocation those of us who are
[1:11:17] moving into the perfect statue of Christ
[1:11:19] amen we are now amen in this age that
[1:11:22] the world knows nothing about
[1:11:26] amen hello this is what you call the
[1:11:29] bride age where God is calling people
[1:11:31] out of all of these places that won't
[1:11:34] take the word for what it
[1:11:36] says now you look at this thing if Eve
[1:11:39] messed up by redefining one word and got
[1:11:42] us into this mess how in the world we
[1:11:43] going to get out of it then everybody
[1:11:46] has their own interpretation y'all hear
[1:11:48] what I'm saying but the Bible said there
[1:11:50] there's no no no no no no private
[1:11:53] interpretation to this so if there's no
[1:11:55] no private interpretation to this word
[1:11:57] how are we going to know Amos said
[1:12:02] 3:7 the Lord will do nothing except it
[1:12:04] reveal his secrets to his servant the
[1:12:08] prophet he did it in Noah's day he did
[1:12:10] it in Jesus day he did it in Moses day
[1:12:13] he did it in Paul's day he did it in our
[1:12:15] he has done it in our day and that's
[1:12:19] it now we're following a Jesus Christ
[1:12:22] that cannot
[1:12:24] change his word cannot change he said it
[1:12:29] just like he meant it and I don't mean
[1:12:31] no harm I don't need a revised version
[1:12:34] to understand my
[1:12:38] Lord come on somebody it's almost like
[1:12:41] saying to a cow you got to change your
[1:12:43] language because your calf is not
[1:12:49] understanding y'all understand what I'm
[1:12:51] saying right amen that's that's what
[1:12:54] they saying
[1:12:56] horse you got to change your language
[1:12:58] cuz your calf is not understand your
[1:13:00] your your Little Pony is not
[1:13:02] understanding what you're saying you
[1:13:03] speak in horse language but for some
[1:13:05] reason this horse can't understand you
[1:13:08] that's
[1:13:12] nonsense one thing I know about a baby a
[1:13:15] little child can understand what you say
[1:13:18] before he can speak
[1:13:21] it yeah is that true now he may not be
[1:13:24] able to speak speak it but he can
[1:13:26] understand it that's how it is with a
[1:13:28] child of God when they're
[1:13:30] born they may not be able to speak it
[1:13:32] just right but they understand it
[1:13:34] Hallelujah and all they got to do is
[1:13:35] keep listening Hallelujah keep reading
[1:13:37] it all of a sudden they begin to come
[1:13:40] become the word they'll speak it just
[1:13:42] like it is it becomes their life their
[1:13:46] language
[1:13:50] everything you love God
[1:13:53] Amen Les's stand we're going to prepare
[1:13:56] for
[1:13:57] our
[1:14:04] communion
