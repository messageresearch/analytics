[47:10] it's about the story of the two
[47:12] disciples
[47:20] after the resurrection of jesus
[47:26] and behold two of them went the same
[47:30] and behold two of them went that same
[47:32] day to a village called amirs
[47:35] which was from jerusalem
[47:54] together and reason together jesus
[47:57] himself drew near and went with him
[48:03] but there
[48:04] are you should not know him
[48:09] and he said
[48:10] what money of communications are these
[48:13] that you have one to another as
[48:16] the walk uh and or said you know
[48:23] and the one of them whose name was
[48:26] cleopas uh answered and saved unto him
[48:29] are dealt only as friends in jerusalem
[48:32] and has not known this the things which
[48:35] are coming to us
[48:45] and he said unto them what things and
[48:48] they said unto him concerning jesus of
[48:50] nazareth which was a prophet my mind
[48:53] indeed and word before god
[49:01] [Music]
[49:07] and how the chief priests and the rulers
[49:10] delivered him to be condemned to death
[49:13] and have crucified himself
[49:17] [Music]
[49:28] and beside all this today is the third
[49:31] day since these things were done
[49:42] in
[49:43] [Music]
[49:56] and when they found out his body they
[49:59] came saying that they had they also seen
[50:01] a vision of injuries which said that he
[50:04] was alive
[50:08] [Music]
[50:40] [Music]
[50:47] these things
[50:48] and to enter into his glory the
[50:50] palliative background
[50:55] and beginning at moses and all the
[50:56] prophets he expounded unto them in all
[50:59] the scriptures the things concerning
[51:01] themselves
[51:21] the blood was
[51:22] before it is toward evening and the day
[51:25] his far spent
[51:26] and he went and he went in to tear it
[51:31] off
[52:03] and they said unto one and they say one
[52:05] to another did not our heart burn within
[52:08] us while he talked with us by the way
[52:11] and while he opened
[52:13] up
[52:43] and how it was
[52:56] um
[53:09] [Music]
[53:27] to be that you need to provide your
[53:28] father
[53:30] we have questions father god that are
[53:32] not answered
[53:35] by prayer father god that you give us
[53:36] answers
[53:38] amen
[53:38] lord we pray your father lord that you
[53:40] pray
[53:51] lord that you take me out of the way
[54:20] like those two disciples and our heart
[54:21] was brilliant
[54:26] [Music]
[54:53] [Music]
[55:12] um
[56:36] don't you cry little bride he's not dead
[56:39] he's alive
[56:44] amen you'll see that those two disciples
[56:46] where they were going
[56:50] they were talking about with the event
[56:52] that took place before that took place
[56:54] three days before
[57:11] when jesus who uh rose people from the
[57:14] dead
[57:16] amen who called lazarus and lazarus
[57:18] started walking
[57:21] and this jesus this man who came you
[57:23] know giving them hope of deliverance see
[57:26] don't just give your daughter in this be
[57:27] home amen giving them hope of oh hope of
[57:30] of of redemption
[57:33] amen so now this jesus is dead
[57:37] amen and it's been three days since it's
[57:39] been dead
[57:41] and those disciples were devastated
[57:45] amen those disciples amen that they were
[57:47] confused
[57:49] amen all our hopes we put on this on
[57:51] this man
[57:52] is
[58:04] that jesus told them when he was alive
[58:09] they forget amen how jesus told them to
[58:11] destroy this temple and rebuild it in
[58:13] three days
[58:18] amen they forget how jesus tell them
[58:20] that amen amen as jillian's when it was
[58:23] spent three days in the belly of the
[58:24] well amen
[58:26] i will also spend three days
[58:34] forget how david says that he will never
[58:37] leave his yeah he's his begotten one to
[58:39] seek corruption
[58:45] amen they had all those verses inside of
[58:48] them
[58:50] but the event that took place was so
[58:53] also uh uh strange that they couldn't
[58:55] even they couldn't control their
[58:57] emotions
[59:02] so
[59:51] so now here we'll see that there is a
[59:52] difference between knowing the word and
[59:55] and the word being revealed to him
[59:57] here
[1:00:20] amen you can't forget what you claim to
[1:00:22] believe amen
[1:00:25] amen because that word that you know is
[1:00:27] not really uh anchored in you
[1:00:32] amen but once that word has been
[1:00:34] revealed to you
[1:00:37] amen now you are in an unshakeable
[1:00:39] kingdom
[1:00:49] it doesn't matter how strong the
[1:00:50] situation is or how hard and impossible
[1:00:53] it is
[1:01:22] they fellowship with jesus
[1:01:26] communion with jesus
[1:01:29] broke the bread
[1:01:30] amen the bread which is the word
[1:01:34] and their eyes were open
[1:01:36] and that word
[1:01:39] and then they went and they told the
[1:01:41] rest of the disciples
[1:01:44] the good news that just happened
[1:01:46] amen that they saw jesus
[1:01:49] amen that they walked with jesus amen
[1:01:52] that they fellowship with jesus
[1:01:55] they had a one-on-one conversation with
[1:01:57] him
[1:01:59] amen that jesus was alive and well amen
[1:02:03] amen that jesus wasn't dead
[1:02:06] that everything that jesus told them
[1:02:09] amen came to pass
[1:02:11] amen amen and then you'll see that you
[1:02:13] mean after the man later on you see mary
[1:02:16] yeah
[1:02:17] amen after the news came to them that
[1:02:19] morning
[1:02:21] it meant that the the body of jesus
[1:02:23] couldn't be found
[1:02:26] amen all of them ran and then they went
[1:02:28] to the tomb
[1:02:30] am i trying to find who took the body of
[1:02:32] jesus
[1:02:34] amen the same thing happened again
[1:02:37] amen they forget everything that jesus
[1:02:39] tells them
[1:02:41] they started to cry they started to look
[1:02:43] for the body of jesus
[1:02:46] amen mary probably thought that the
[1:02:48] romans in men took the body of jesus
[1:02:53] or do something with it
[1:02:55] she was so scared and she was crying
[1:02:59] amen and then she heard someone
[1:03:02] women calling her a woman what is going
[1:03:04] on
[1:03:05] amen he said mary don't you
[1:03:08] marry the blood
[1:03:09] mary don't cry amen amen because that
[1:03:12] meant it
[1:03:13] meant i'm alive and well
[1:03:40] recognizing your day and its message
[1:04:10] what have they done
[1:04:13] they have not recognized the awakening
[1:04:15] of the bride
[1:04:19] by being a christian
[1:04:23] they feel the pull of the hour
[1:04:37] they know something is supposed to
[1:04:38] happen
[1:04:40] but see but they're looking for they're
[1:04:43] looking for it
[1:04:44] they're looking for it way off in the
[1:04:46] future before you
[1:04:48] you don't
[1:04:49] don't only future you may way off in the
[1:04:50] future to come
[1:04:52] when
[1:05:07] they believe that there will be a
[1:05:09] forerunner if around to come
[1:05:13] but it was right on them
[1:05:16] amen and they didn't know it
[1:05:18] they didn't recognize it
[1:05:34] the messiah
[1:05:37] amen because because it was prophesied
[1:05:39] that they would be blinded as uh
[1:05:42] hosea said so
[1:05:44] amen
[1:05:47] amen the word was before them and the
[1:05:50] fulfillment of the word was before them
[1:05:54] but they were looking for something in
[1:05:55] the future
[1:05:58] amen they were looking for something in
[1:05:59] the future the thing that was being
[1:06:01] happened that the thing that happened
[1:06:02] right in front of them
[1:06:06] amen that's the same thing with the
[1:06:08] chief phrase
[1:06:10] they knew all the prophecies
[1:06:13] amen
[1:06:15] amen the virgin shall concede
[1:06:25] amen but that prophecy happened before
[1:06:27] their eyes
[1:06:29] amen your virgin conceived
[1:06:44] that
[1:06:52] amen because they were looking for
[1:06:54] something in the future
[1:06:57] that was happening before in
[1:07:10] amen sometimes the answer is right in
[1:07:12] front of us
[1:07:34] amen amen are you trying to look for
[1:07:36] your forgiveness
[1:07:38] amen amen jesus shared his blood on
[1:07:40] calvary
[1:07:47] amen so why are you still looking for
[1:07:49] your forgiveness in the future
[1:07:52] amen you can't go to him
[1:07:54] even
[1:08:22] is
[1:08:37] that the man that the men can feel
[1:08:41] amen every temptation any man ever stood
[1:08:44] uh
[1:08:46] amen it doesn't matter what temptation
[1:08:48] is
[1:08:49] that temptation
[1:09:32] to be an overcomer
[1:09:35] [Music]
[1:09:59] that's where we have to go
[1:10:03] and every sons and daughters of christ
[1:10:05] of god
[1:10:07] has to go to calvary
[1:10:09] amen recovery is the main thing for us
[1:10:12] christians

[1:10:19] calvary that's right

[1:10:24] calvary
[1:10:26] jesus christ i've had to go through it
[1:10:28] it's just
[1:10:30] that means that every christian has to
[1:10:32] go through it
[1:10:34] amen amen the prophet says that calvary
[1:10:37] there is not a day but that was there is
[1:10:39] not a day that can't be that can be
[1:10:40] compared to calvary the day on calvary
[1:10:54] amen that's when our victory were given
[1:11:09] that's when we can go and say that we
[1:11:11] are now christ-like
[1:11:16] amen because it's no longer us living
[1:11:19] amen trying to work out to obey the law
[1:11:24] living inside

[1:12:19] bringing us to remember amen
[1:12:21] amen everything that jesus told us
[1:12:24] him and the word of christ amen
[1:12:27] amen one day the prophet and when he
[1:12:29] went to pray for his sister
[1:12:31] uh her name was sister lewis the prophet
[1:12:49] amen but before the prophet prayed they
[1:12:51] uh she had the priest and all those
[1:12:53] catholic people coming and and doing
[1:12:55] their prayers and stuff
[1:13:01] and she called all those catholic people
[1:13:03] and they did themselves and the prophet
[1:13:04] went now because he didn't want to be a
[1:13:06] part of it
[1:13:10] so after that the prophet came back in
[1:13:12] to pray for her
[1:13:15] because the prophet was believing in
[1:13:17] faith of healing
[1:13:20] the prophet believed that god was able
[1:13:22] to heal her amen
[1:13:26] the prophet believed that whatever she
[1:13:27] was going through god was able to to to
[1:13:30] help her to get out of that situation
[1:13:37] and then the prophet prayed for her in
[1:13:39] the prophetic people she received their
[1:13:41] healing
[1:13:42] amen and she gave her life to
[1:13:44] jesus amen she said the prophet amen

[1:14:20] and he went to the prophet said that
[1:14:22] brother branham i have to find my
[1:14:23] opponents

[1:15:08] believe that you can pray for me and i
[1:15:10] will find it amen
[1:15:12] amen and the prophet was called in the
[1:15:14] spirit
[1:15:16] amen and he gave a prophecy
[1:15:19] amen telling him that you will go find
[1:15:21] those ponies on the mount on top of the
[1:15:22] mountains
[1:15:27] it was so difficult and impossible that
[1:15:29] those points will still be alive
[1:15:35] they were all covered in snow
[1:15:50] the word came from the prophet of god
[1:15:53] him and god gave him his promise
[1:15:56] that you will find your opponents
[1:15:59] that you will find your joy
[1:16:02] amen and he believed to that promise
[1:16:06] amen that's why god said that you may
[1:16:08] ask everything in jesus christ's name
[1:16:11] [Music]
[1:16:12] amen
[1:16:13] that your joy be perfect
[1:16:17] it doesn't matter how complicated is the
[1:16:19] thing

[1:16:25] amen that was god hiding behind the skin
[1:16:28] of man
