[29:36] how many can say that the Lord has made
[29:38] us that he made so don't have any
[29:42] special words introduced by the Troy but
[29:45] uh I want to share testimony really real
[29:48] quick what happened yesterday before
[29:51] yesterday so today before I preach I
[29:54] called the brother because I was
[29:56] wondering why the brother was not coming
[29:58] to church anymore
[29:59] on Fridays when I called the brother he
[30:02] told me you know why I just don't feel
[30:05] like coming to church on Fridays you
[30:06] know for personal reasons well when he
[30:10] said that I thought that you know maybe
[30:12] because of me cuz I'm the one who
[30:13] pressures on Friday every Friday
[30:15] probably my you know my preaching is not
[30:18] benefit to any man you know I was a
[30:20] little bit weary without you know before
[30:22] it going to preach then I had that
[30:24] thought in my mind you know all the time
[30:26] the entire you know the entire afternoon
[30:29] I was wondering Lord what can I do so
[30:33] then when I went to prayer I wanted to
[30:36] mention that in my prayer but I felt
[30:38] like you know don't mission and then I
[30:41] kept on reading my Bible study and then
[30:44] I saw a text on my phone a sister which
[30:49] I don't know who she was I don't know
[30:51] where she lives
[30:52] she just texted me saying that brother
[30:54] I'm really impressed by your sermon the
[30:56] Lord has been blessing me when I hear
[30:58] you so that was like a comfort to me
[31:00] saying that you know God hears us and
[31:03] you know why I give this to someone
[31:06] decide you might be going through a try
[31:08] or you might be going through something
[31:10] but you wander yourself he's got real do
[31:13] you want real so you wonder you know is
[31:15] this possible does people love me or
[31:18] it's got real it's got even it's got to
[31:21] think it does God think about me you
[31:24] know I just want to tell you that God
[31:25] does you know the question that you have
[31:28] in your heart you know the thing that
[31:30] you you know your thinking about God you
[31:32] know God does here and God does answer
[31:35] so this morning and this noon
[31:38] you know when the brother will come you
[31:41] know you just have faith in God say that
[31:44] you know Lord this is my day I've been
[31:46] having this question I've been having
[31:48] this though for a long time that this is
[31:50] that they were I need my answer this is
[31:53] the day where I need to I need you know
[31:55] I need you to provide to my question I

[33:30] hey man it's good to see everyone here
[33:33] in the hospital it's morning coming out
[33:35] of the Saturday definitely appreciate
[33:37] all of you attending I don't believe
[33:41] I've actually ministered on any of the
[33:43] youth Saturdays we've done so far so
[33:46] it's it's nice to be here amen and I
[33:49] just wanted to just wanted to give
[33:51] thanks to all
[33:53] it's you that makes the service you know
[33:57] I've thought a lot or the recent months
[34:00] about how different each one of us are
[34:03] we all have our own different childhoods
[34:06] our own different experiences we're all
[34:10] created a little bit different you know
[34:14] all of us have our own little unique
[34:16] traits in our own unique ways that we
[34:19] think the things that we do it the
[34:20] reasons why we do such things when we
[34:23] come together all that uniqueness just
[34:25] kind of lives together in each one of us
[34:27] has something to add as our brother was
[34:30] saying you know it's so easy for us to
[34:33] get into certain mindsets of wondering
[34:37] you know well did I do this right or did
[34:40] I do that right or you know am I really
[34:42] a part of the group work am I really
[34:45] accepted here or am I really accepted
[34:47] there what does this person think me or
[34:49] that person think probably and the
[34:51] reality God is the one who made this
[34:53] choice a man and he chose us amen we
[34:57] live and move and have faith necklace
[35:00] Amen because no matter what the world
[35:02] thinks of us or what our position in
[35:05] this world ends up being we have a God
[35:07] in heaven amen he created this world as
[35:11] a temporary place but he has an eternal
[35:14] mindset a man so everything we see
[35:18] around us is gonna pass away one of
[35:19] these days
[35:20] amen all of our thoughts and our
[35:23] all things that concern us all the
[35:26] things that worry us all the we wonder
[35:29] well how is this gonna be or how is that
[35:31] going to be here or what about this
[35:33] relationship or that relationship with
[35:35] this person or my parents or my friends
[35:38] my brother all those things we wonder
[35:40] about our temporary a mint because God
[35:44] has an eternal relationship for
[35:47] everything that we think here on earth
[35:48] is temporary there is an eternal someone
[35:51] a manner that's what we're here to
[35:53] express on to tonight this morning is to
[35:56] express unto you the eternal a man so
[35:59] that you can put your thoughts your
[36:01] hopes your faith your dreams your
[36:03] beliefs on the eternal things amen and
[36:07] on the things down here on this earth
[36:08] because that's what gets that's what
[36:11] keeps us going that's what gives us
[36:13] faith to keep on moving to go through
[36:15] each every stage of our lives amen amen
[36:18] so let's just stand as we get into the
[36:20] word of the Lord I want to preach a
[36:23] message this morning called make your
[36:26] choice or entering into faith Amen so
[36:32] we'll go from Galatians chapter 3 every
[36:37] single one of us comes to a place in our
[36:39] lives where we we just we just have to
[36:41] make our choice amen and it comes to
[36:45] everybody at different times in their
[36:46] lives but but every single one of us if
[36:49] we are called to be Christians there we
[36:52] are come to that place reach one of us
[36:53] answers that call Amen you know and
[36:57] growing up in church is so much
[36:58] different than growing up in out in the
[37:01] world or out in a home of a non-believer
[37:04] because every single one of us we grow
[37:07] up hearing the gospel and we hear it
[37:10] from the day were born practically
[37:13] growing up to the church but there's got
[37:15] to come that timed where it's not your
[37:18] parents faith or they that where you
[37:20] make your choice where it is revealed
[37:22] unto you amen
[37:24] so let's read Galatians chapter 3 verse
[37:27] 6 and it says even as even as abraham
[37:32] believed God and it was accounted to him
[37:37] righteousness no ye therefore that they
[37:40] which are of faith the same are the
[37:45] children of Abraham and the scripture
[37:47] foreseeing that God would justify the
[37:49] heathen through faith preached before
[37:52] the gospel unto Abraham saying in thee
[37:55] Abraham shall all nations be blessed so
[37:59] then they which be of faith are blessed
[38:03] with faithful Abraham Amen now let's uh
[38:07] let's just stop right there and Bauer
[38:11] has a word prayer Heavenly Father we
[38:13] just approach unto you this morning a
[38:15] slore that as you said Lord where two or
[38:17] three are gathered in my name I'll come
[38:20] down and I'll be right there in the
[38:22] midst Laura thus more we came here in
[38:24] your name Lord to glorify your name to
[38:27] give you the preeminence father to
[38:29] minister to the people father to have
[38:31] respects unto the Lord Jesus Christ Lord
[38:33] we came in your name father
[38:35] so we asked Lord that you would answer
[38:37] your Gospel order and even though as
[38:39] brother Bram said that that you keep
[38:42] every appointment that you even leave
[38:44] glory a little bit early to get here on
[38:47] time and Lord I just want to thank you
[38:49] for being here Lord Laura we surrender
[38:51] our lives unto you and we ask father
[38:53] that you are the one that searches the
[38:55] hearts may you reveal yourself unto
[38:57] every single one of us right now in the
[39:00] name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen
[39:04] I love the story of Abraham because
[39:12] Abraham was a man who didn't start off
[39:17] with a relationship with God amen he
[39:20] they he as he as God first began to
[39:24] reveal himself unto him that his
[39:26] relationship started right there amen
[39:29] and as God began to really introduce
[39:33] himself to Abraham Abraham just accepted
[39:36] it
[39:37] Amen he just began to accept it you know
[39:40] and every single one of us has that same
[39:42] just can I tell you a testimony about my
[39:45] own childhood and how I got started on
[39:47] this walk I grew up going to church amen
[39:51] grew up going to church every Sunday
[39:53] every Wednesday you know and and and it
[39:57] caused that that wondering is when do
[40:01] you become a Christian you know at what
[40:04] point do you actually become a Christian
[40:07] and and you know as you I remember my
[40:12] mom set me down on the couch my six or
[40:14] seven years old and she prayed a little
[40:17] prayer with me and went through the
[40:19] scriptures and at that point she called
[40:21] me a Christian a man because I had
[40:24] prayed this prayer with her you know and
[40:25] and six seven years old and and and
[40:29] that's that's how it got started
[40:30] you know but never really knowing
[40:33] exactly at what point I had no faith in
[40:38] that that prayer didn't cause faith to
[40:42] rise up inside of me yone later on in
[40:46] life I was going to little little
[40:49] children's meetings that we had and
[40:51] different things that we had and then
[40:52] when I was about thirteen my sister who
[40:56] was couple years older than I was got
[40:58] invited to into the the youth group they
[41:00] had four teenagers at our church and I
[41:03] was like 12 or 13 and the youth pastor
[41:06] kind of went up to my sister and he says
[41:09] oh I'd like you to join our youth group
[41:11] I'd like you to start coming to the
[41:13] services he looked over me he says you
[41:15] can come too you know there wasn't
[41:17] really a direct invitation to me he was
[41:19] inviting my sister you know and I didn't
[41:22] really have that faith that I was
[41:25] invited I was involved you know that I
[41:27] belong there and so I start attending
[41:32] the youth services there and and I end
[41:34] up going to a youth camp and listening
[41:37] to the preaching I have some reason I
[41:39] was standing in the very back at this
[41:41] youth camp they had some type of revival
[41:43] service there and probably three
[41:47] probably four or five hundred children
[41:48] there in the service and and I've some
[41:51] reasons I stand in the way in the back
[41:53] behind all all the the pews and
[41:55] everything and and huge auditorium lots
[41:58] of children and teenagers and and the
[42:01] man was preaching and what he was
[42:02] preaching really struck me and I
[42:05] probably 13 14 years old and and he gave
[42:09] an altar call for people to come up and
[42:11] give their hearts to Christ and as I
[42:16] listened to the altar call I was too
[42:19] scared to go up there I didn't want to
[42:21] go up in front of all those people and
[42:22] so I was just standing back there and
[42:26] and I just started praying right there
[42:28] where I was standing and I felt God
[42:30] changed come into my life I don't know I
[42:32] don't know how to express it other than
[42:34] that was really the beginning of what I
[42:36] could say I felt God
[42:38] I felt God's presence I knew who is
[42:41] there I knew who he was I that was the
[42:43] beginning of my recognizing of God's
[42:46] presence in my life I didn't receive
[42:48] that when I was 6 years old I didn't
[42:51] have that six seven eight nine I didn't
[42:53] have that when I was sleeping under the
[42:54] pews at 11 years old you know I didn't
[42:57] have that when I had listened to the
[42:58] sermons you know as a young ten eleven
[43:01] years old but for some reason when when
[43:04] I had that experience at 13 it changed
[43:07] who I was a man I went from a little boy
[43:10] that was riding his bike up and down the
[43:12] alleys and and playing in the yard to a
[43:16] boy that was reading his Bible and pray
[43:18] amen to to a boy they began to look to
[43:21] the scriptures trying to figure out who
[43:23] I was a man and then is that at that
[43:26] point that I began to listen to what the
[43:27] pastor was preaching a man that when I
[43:30] finally I started when the pastor start
[43:32] preaching I started actually paying
[43:33] attention to what he said and that's
[43:35] when my experience with Jesus Christ
[43:38] began amen as it moved on on I'd be
[43:42] getting my relationship with the Lord
[43:44] begin to change a man that's why what
[43:47] they I like about Abraham is how do you
[43:50] put your finger on Abraham's life to say
[43:52] this is the point that Abraham was saved
[43:55] where do you put your finger on
[43:57] Abraham's life to say this is the moment
[44:00] that Abraham became a Christian the
[44:02] Abraham became a follower of Jehovah the
[44:05] Abraham became one with God where where
[44:08] do you put your finger in Abraham's life
[44:10] a man you and I every single one of us
[44:12] you know growing up in church we all
[44:14] have to come to that place or Who am I
[44:16] in Christ who
[44:19] where do I where do I belong as my
[44:20] brother was testifying you know is just
[44:23] for I can't up here he's talking about
[44:25] how he was to preach on a winds door on
[44:27] a Friday night you know and and he just
[44:30] and and the brother wasn't sure that he
[44:33] wanted to come and listen so the brother
[44:35] automatically begins to think well maybe
[44:37] he does and he puts the blame on himself
[44:40] you know you listen to that testimony he
[44:42] starts to put the blame on himself and
[44:44] think well maybe the brother it maybe
[44:47] someone else was preaching it that
[44:48] brother would come you know and it's
[44:50] easy for us always to put the blame on
[44:52] ourselves in those situations but yet my
[44:55] brother was called to preach the gospel
[44:57] you know and everybody that is called to
[45:00] preach the gospel they enter into an
[45:02] anointing amen and when they Adrian
[45:05] behind the pulpit and God gives them
[45:06] even if they can they can walk out of
[45:09] the pulpit feeling like they're a
[45:10] complete failure but yeah God will have
[45:13] those words enter into somebody's heart
[45:16] because it's the preaching of the gospel
[45:17] amen but that same calling that calls a
[45:21] man to preach the gospel that same
[45:24] calling goes unto the children that are
[45:27] growing up in the church
[45:28] a man is God has a time put for you
[45:33] growing as a child here in this church
[45:35] God has a time for you to grow up in the
[45:39] gospel but as my as I testify you know
[45:41] my mom she set me down on the couch at 6
[45:43] or 7 years old but God didn't meet me
[45:46] when I was 6 or 7 years old I had no
[45:48] experience with him my relationship with
[45:50] God didn't begin there Amen but but
[45:53] there was a day appointed for my
[45:56] relationship with the Lord to begin
[45:58] there was a day appointed when the
[46:01] revelation of Jesus Christ came to me to
[46:03] where all the sudden it wasn't just me
[46:06] listening to the pastor preach or me
[46:08] listening to my mom pray with me but all
[46:10] son knew is me and my Bible and God it
[46:13] was me praying to God I knew who I was
[46:16] praying to at that time now my faith
[46:20] wasn't really there at that time you
[46:24] know I was just stepping out into I had
[46:26] received you know I had received the 10
[46:29] commandments I knew what all the lessons
[46:32] idler
[46:33] in Sunday school I knew I knew the thing
[46:36] that says don't do this you know you
[46:38] shouldn't lie you shouldn't do that I
[46:41] knew I knew about you know being spanked
[46:44] as a child I knew about correction
[46:47] I knew about don't do this or don't do
[46:48] that but now I had to leave that behind
[46:52] and enter into a relationship with God
[46:56] by faith there's a scripture I want to
[46:59] read here in Galatians chapter 3 just a
[47:02] little bit further down from where we
[47:03] read it's verse 23 and it says but
[47:10] before faith came we were kept under the
[47:14] law shut up unto the faith which should
[47:17] afterwards be revealed so before on
[47:22] we're gonna go on to the next verse here
[47:23] in just a second but before faith came
[47:26] those that were they were kept under the
[47:29] law but they were only kept to a point
[47:32] to what faith would come into their life
[47:33] amen and faith is very simple it's
[47:36] believing in God amen you know that's
[47:40] one thing I love to do when I'm
[47:41] preaching is I like to take something
[47:43] that so many that has become just a how
[47:49] do you say a cliche or just you know you
[47:53] talk about faith so many times your mind
[47:56] doesn't quite graphs is exactly what it
[47:58] is
[47:58] amen but let me tell you if faith is
[48:00] just believing in God to the point that
[48:03] you believe in God more than you believe
[48:06] in the chair that you're sitting in amen
[48:08] that is the in goal of faith amen but
[48:11] that but it doesn't start off there amen
[48:14] it starts at this first revelation of
[48:17] Jesus Christ in your life amen the first
[48:20] moment that God starts tugging at your
[48:22] heart door wherever it may be you know I
[48:25] don't know it will be different for each
[48:26] one of you it'll be some day during a
[48:29] church service when we're all but when
[48:30] the Gospels being preached or we'll be
[48:32] at home one year when you're you're
[48:34] reading your Bible and all sudden the
[48:36] Scriptures start ministering to you
[48:40] there every single one of us has a
[48:41] different experience but there's got to
[48:43] be a one point in time where all of a
[48:46] sudden you're Lee
[48:46] the do's and don'ts behind and you're
[48:49] entering into the faith of the gospel
[48:51] yay God is beginning to reveal himself
[48:54] unto you a man that's no longer just
[48:57] your parents saying well you know don't
[48:58] do this because the Bible says so or
[49:00] don't do that because the Bible says so
[49:03] but now the God of the Bible himself is
[49:06] revealing himself to you a man that's a
[49:09] transition when children grow up in the
[49:11] church that's a transition that they
[49:13] have to make your there's a lot of
[49:15] children that never make that transition
[49:17] amen and they grow up and they still
[49:20] live underneath the law and then when
[49:22] they get older they just leave the
[49:24] church behind or they stay stuck there
[49:27] trying just obey the law without God
[49:30] you're on it so really it's a sad
[49:32] experience because it's not supposed to
[49:34] be that way
[49:35] amen the whole point of this is that you
[49:38] yourself would come to a point to where
[49:40] God is yours a man you have ownership of
[49:43] him he has ownership of you you two have
[49:46] been joined together amen amen so that
[49:49] when the trials of life come he's the
[49:53] one that you go to anyway you're right
[49:55] now you're growing up in your household
[49:56] you know and you're you know your
[49:57] parents they gave you your clothes they
[49:59] give you your food or you're going in
[50:01] college you and you're just starting off
[50:02] but there comes times when the deep
[50:05] desires of life or the deep trials of
[50:08] life start coming past you across your
[50:11] life you know it's where you know like
[50:13] right now and all your needs are being
[50:15] taken care of you knowing you and you
[50:18] know but you think but you have like the
[50:19] emotions of a teenager start coming into
[50:22] your life well here is the resource take
[50:25] them to God in prayer you know in the
[50:27] deep desires of oh I I'd like to have a
[50:30] relationship with someone you know or
[50:32] I'm thinking about a men or women you
[50:35] know or girlfriends and boyfriends and
[50:37] all those things and leaving and
[50:39] entering into the relationship years you
[50:42] know what God is your resource to take
[50:44] those in prayer if you have faith amen
[50:47] but God's relationship with you doesn't
[50:49] just stop there hey is he going to into
[50:52] the college years even like when all
[50:54] sudden now it's no longer your parents
[50:56] directing your life choices but now our
[50:59] life choices all
[51:00] to you you're the one deciding what am I
[51:03] going to do with my life and you're the
[51:05] one who now has to decide am I gonna
[51:08] follow the Lord Jesus Christ or am I
[51:11] gonna do my own thing amen
[51:14] making your choice entering into your
[51:17] fate entering into faith and then every
[51:20] single one of us has to come to a place
[51:21] where we make a decision are we going to
[51:24] enter into this relationship with God
[51:27] that will never end or are we gonna
[51:30] leave it behind there comes a dividing
[51:33] point every child that grows up in
[51:35] church comes to a dividing point where
[51:37] he must make his choice amen and I don't
[51:41] know what day in your life that will
[51:42] come but at some point God has to touch
[51:46] your hearts door to a point to where you
[51:48] leave your father and your mother behind
[51:50] and you enter into this relationship
[51:52] with the Lord Jesus Christ amen where
[51:54] you make your choice for the Lord and
[51:57] all of a sudden God becomes your
[51:58] provider amen he becomes the one that
[52:01] directs you into college he becomes the
[52:03] one that directs you into and to choose
[52:05] animate a man choosing a husband or wife
[52:07] and then you know and then later on in
[52:10] life you know when your friends are
[52:11] going through cancer you know when
[52:13] you're when you're when you need when
[52:14] you're need a good job you know when
[52:17] you're when you get sick and you're
[52:18] dying or you're or a depression comes
[52:20] across your life and God be the one that
[52:23] you chose back there becomes your
[52:24] resource to save you your weak to your
[52:27] resource to deliver you he becomes the
[52:29] one that you lean on the one that comes
[52:32] your healing power a man he becomes the
[52:34] one that cures your depression a man he
[52:36] becomes the one that that guides you
[52:38] through your choices in life so it's
[52:40] you're not alone when you have to make a
[52:42] choice he's the one that provides you
[52:43] with the spouse he's the one that
[52:45] provides you with a job he's the one
[52:47] that provides you with all you have need
[52:48] of upon life's journey amen and that's
[52:51] what caught us the benefits of making
[52:54] this choice for the Lord Jesus Christ
[52:55] amen so in Abraham was given this choice
[52:59] leave everything behind I have a I want
[53:03] you to follow my leadership and go to
[53:06] another land 500 miles away and I will
[53:09] show you every step of the way
[53:11] a man so Abraham came to a point where
[53:14] he had to make his choice amen he
[53:17] decided that the choice that short he
[53:21] decided that the the the promise that
[53:24] was offered to him was better than the
[53:28] things that he was leaving behind amen
[53:31] and every single one of us at some point
[53:33] is gonna have to make our choice are we
[53:35] gonna be constrained by the laws of the
[53:37] gospel are we gonna leave our own
[53:40] thoughts behind and enter into the
[53:43] relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ
[53:45] how are we going to follow his ways are
[53:47] we going to follow our ways but let me
[53:49] tell you when we if we make the wrong
[53:51] choice and decide to follow our own ways
[53:55] and follow our own paths we have nothing
[53:59] to lean on amen you're entering out into
[54:03] a world with no resources from eternity
[54:07] hey man but let me tell you when you
[54:09] fall when you when you follow the choice
[54:12] of the Lord Jesus Christ let me tell you
[54:14] God is the god of infinite resources
[54:16] amen he owns all the cattle on a
[54:20] Thousand Hills Amen he owns every tree
[54:22] in the forest amen he owns every
[54:24] building that was ever built a man he is
[54:26] the one that controls he can make Kings
[54:29] move in his direction a man he can he
[54:32] can move an entire business to operate
[54:35] according to his will
[54:36] amen he can he can move cancer out of a
[54:39] body he can he can a can provide you
[54:42] with a job he can do whatever if a man
[54:45] that is there has given his his life
[54:48] over to the Lord Jesus Christ has
[54:51] infinite resources amen amen the God
[54:54] that created the heavens and the earth
[54:55] has prepared a place for you in eternity
[54:59] a man right now you have the you know
[55:01] you think you have the next 40 50 60 70
[55:03] years ahead of you amen but but all of
[55:06] us must grow old and die or go in the
[55:09] rapture at some point every single one
[55:12] of us and say when that time comes your
[55:16] choice is gonna pay off amen
[55:20] though the things that we suffer here in
[55:23] this life journey do not compare to the
[55:25] things he is laid up for us and
[55:27] or a man the same God that created the
[55:30] mountains that created the force that
[55:32] created the the pleasures that we have
[55:34] on this life amen
[55:36] is the same God that created a place for
[55:38] us to live throughout all eternity amen
[55:41] and the pleasure that he has created for
[55:44] us is the world cannot compare to me
[55:47] amen amen so as Abraham first made his
[55:54] choice he was he started a relationship
[55:58] with Jehovah amen he started a
[56:01] relationship with God they would go down
[56:03] throughout all history amen hey man let
[56:08] me tell you Abraham is still alive this
[56:09] day remember in the Bible a one time
[56:14] Jesus was going there he says Abraham
[56:17] saw my day he was glad and he rejoiced
[56:21] him
[56:22] amen amen
[56:28] if you remember the story that brother
[56:31] Branham told of blind Bartimaeus in the
[56:35] Bible he or I went through a few years
[56:38] ago and I listened to every single
[56:39] sermon brother Branham preached on blind
[56:41] Bartimaeus one after another and and it
[56:45] was really a blessing to me but the
[56:47] story of blind Bartimaeus goes kind of
[56:50] like this he grew up in the near the
[56:54] River Jordan in town Jericho and on the
[56:58] hills near Jericho and as he grew up as
[57:02] a boy he wasn't born blind but he could
[57:05] see when he was a child
[57:07] amen and so is he explored he saw the
[57:10] River Jordan he and he saw the fields
[57:13] and he knew and his mom would tell him
[57:15] these Bible stories amen and so and so
[57:19] his blind bartimaeus was growing up his
[57:21] mom would tell him you know you know
[57:23] that River Jordan when when your
[57:25] ancestors came over over here God parted
[57:29] the river in two and the people walked
[57:32] across on dry ground a man that God
[57:35] Himself spoke to the river and they
[57:38] walked her and also in the river just
[57:40] parted ways and
[57:41] and you know when the our people were
[57:43] able to walk across on dry ground a man
[57:46] that same God is still here today a man
[57:49] it is Joshua crossed over the river
[57:51] Jordan there after that that he met the
[57:53] angel to cut the the captain of the
[57:56] hosts of the Lord a man and that son is
[57:59] the one that led him and had him conquer
[58:01] thousands and thousands of the enemy
[58:03] amen and and as gently as Joshua came up
[58:06] to Jericho that they marched around and
[58:09] the walls were so thick they could ride
[58:11] a chariot upon it a man but as they
[58:13] marched around the walls for seven days
[58:15] God told them what to do and when they
[58:18] did it all of a sudden God spoke to the
[58:20] walls and the and they shouted in the
[58:22] walls came tumbling down and that same
[58:24] God is here today and blind Bartimaeus
[58:27] had all these Bible stories stored up in
[58:30] his mind from when his but his mother
[58:32] used to tell him and she used to tell
[58:34] him you know that that road that's going
[58:35] up right across Jericho there she says
[58:38] that's the same road that the prophets
[58:40] Elijah and Elijah marched down when they
[58:43] went back down to the Jordan and God
[58:45] parted the Red Sea for him again amen
[58:47] and as now blind bartimaeus ended up
[58:51] having a really sad childhood as he lost
[58:54] his sight amen then he lost his parents
[58:57] amen and he became just a beggar in the
[59:00] land amen in order for him to get his
[59:02] days food day by day you know he had to
[59:05] beg for a coin at the gates of Jericho
[59:08] there every morning a man he just had a
[59:10] sad life story to where it seemed like
[59:14] everything was going wrong you know and
[59:17] the very and the very God of Jehovah
[59:21] seems to have abandoned him you know in
[59:23] all the hopes and dreams he had as a
[59:25] child were now dashed now he can no
[59:28] longer see he has to have his parents
[59:30] there to guide him through life amen and
[59:32] he you know he gets married and he has a
[59:34] daughter and his daughter gets sick you
[59:36] know and Justin and his wife gets sick
[59:39] you know it just seems like everything
[59:41] is falling apart but he has a
[59:42] relationship with Jehovah where he
[59:45] trusts in the Lord and the Lord heals
[59:47] his daughter he trusts in the Lord and
[59:50] and the Lord heals his wife amen and as
[59:53] brother Ram told the story about how
[59:56] when his daughter got sick that he had
[1:00:00] these two little turtle doves they would
[1:00:02] do little tricks there at the at the
[1:00:04] gate so he had sit there begging and and
[1:00:06] he they sit there on a rock by the gate
[1:00:08] and as he sat there begging that these
[1:00:10] two little turtle doves would do tricks
[1:00:13] amen and and and and and and then people
[1:00:17] would stop they'd watch the turtle doves
[1:00:19] doing a trick and they'd enjoy it and
[1:00:21] they'd give him a little coin and those
[1:00:23] turtle doves helped him get money sing
[1:00:25] by his food day by day amen and and one
[1:00:28] day when his daughter got sick he said
[1:00:30] Lord you got down in his prayer and he
[1:00:32] is afraid that that his daughter would
[1:00:34] die and he said Lord if you will heal my
[1:00:37] daughter I will sacrifice my turtle
[1:00:40] doves to you a man then about two days
[1:00:44] later also and his daughter gets better
[1:00:46] a man they thought she was going to die
[1:00:48] but sudden she gets better and so he
[1:00:50] takes his two little turtle doves and he
[1:00:52] and he takes them up to the priest he
[1:00:54] sacrifices them as a sacrifice to Lord
[1:00:57] an offering to God amen the high priest
[1:01:00] would take them and and and and and they
[1:01:03] said and he says I'm and a little bit
[1:01:08] later his wife gets sick and so he and
[1:01:12] brother bran we tell the story about how
[1:01:14] he had this little lamb there would lead
[1:01:17] them kind of like a seeing-eye dog would
[1:01:19] lead would lead a blind person he had
[1:01:21] this lamb that would lead him through
[1:01:22] the city amen and keep him from
[1:01:25] stumbling and going to take him to the
[1:01:27] right place amen and that lamb was like
[1:01:29] a set of eyes to him a man is but when
[1:01:32] his wife got sick he went got down and
[1:01:35] he prayed to the Lord and he said Lord
[1:01:37] if you will heal my wife then I will
[1:01:40] sacrifice this lamb T to you and in
[1:01:43] honor of you healing my wife and sure
[1:01:45] enough the next day his wife began to
[1:01:47] get better
[1:01:48] a man is so he goes down to the to the
[1:01:51] temple door into the high priest and he
[1:01:53] I was offering up the that his his
[1:01:56] little lamb is a offering to the Lord
[1:01:59] and the priest says bartimaeus you
[1:02:02] cannot give up that lamb that lamb is
[1:02:05] your eyes and as the story goes on
[1:02:09] the hot Barmes said to him no I promised
[1:02:14] God that if God would heal my wife that
[1:02:17] I would give sacrifice this lamb unto
[1:02:20] Jehovah and the high priest said but but
[1:02:22] that lamb is your eyes you tell you what
[1:02:25] I will buy you a lamb and just so that
[1:02:27] you can sacrifice that lamb unto me
[1:02:30] amen and but and bartimaeus said but I
[1:02:33] never promised God just any land I
[1:02:35] promised god this lamb a man that lamb
[1:02:38] was the most important one of the most
[1:02:39] important things he had in his life well
[1:02:42] his most valuable possessions and he
[1:02:44] sacrificed it too it was the high priest
[1:02:46] said you cannot do this this is you know
[1:02:49] this is your everything this is about
[1:02:52] all you that you own and he says well
[1:02:54] and he says Oh high priest if I will
[1:02:58] give up my land God is able to provide
[1:03:01] me a lamb you know well as the priest
[1:03:04] says but that lamb is your eyes that
[1:03:07] lane was your eyesight that's the thing
[1:03:08] that guides you the thing that leads you
[1:03:10] but by tomorrow mayor said but oh I if I
[1:03:13] sacrifice this lamb God is able to
[1:03:16] provide a lamb for my eyes God is able
[1:03:19] to provide a lamb to give me leadership
[1:03:21] to lead me through the city to show me
[1:03:23] where I ought to go I promised God this
[1:03:25] lamb and so he sacrifices that lamb and
[1:03:28] all sudden his wife the woman that he

[1:15:19] relationship let me tell you by the time
[1:15:21] Abraham was an old man he got to the
[1:15:24] place where he believed in God so much
[1:15:27] that God could tell him anything
[1:15:30] and he just believed he just believed
[1:15:35] that's just that's just what yet okay
[1:15:37] God I believe okay God yes Lord I
[1:15:41] believe yes Lord I believe let me tell
[1:15:44] you that faith paid off Amen that faith
[1:15:48] paid off Amen God made him the father of
[1:15:53] Nations you know I was just reading the
[1:15:55] other day I think they said there are
[1:15:57] over of all the religions of the world
[1:15:59] there's multiple religions that point
[1:16:02] back to Abraham as their founder of all
[1:16:06] those religions the people that follow
[1:16:09] that religions they say it's about 60%
[1:16:10] of the people on the earth belong to a
[1:16:14] religion that point back to Abraham
[1:16:18] Abraham's faith paid off he became the
[1:16:21] father of Nations amen amen and so that
[1:16:26] relationship changed over and over and
[1:16:29] over and over again amen and so will it
[1:16:32] with you when you first make your choice
[1:16:34] and you trust in the Lord in all your
[1:16:37] ways and he will show you your past
[1:16:41] let's turn it of Psalms 25 I just here
[1:16:45] in closing
[1:17:07] when I was a young teenager probably
[1:17:12] 1415 years old I found Psalms 25 and I
[1:17:16] would pray these first five verses
[1:17:20] constantly I was always praying these
[1:17:23] first five verses to the Lord and this
[1:17:26] was my prayer I would psalms 25 1 it
[1:17:31] says unto thee O Lord do I lift up my
[1:17:34] soul o my god I trust in thee let me not
[1:17:38] be ashamed let my not mine enemies
[1:17:41] triumph over me yay let none that wait
[1:17:43] on thee be ashamed let them be ashamed
[1:17:46] which which transgress without cause and
[1:17:49] this this was these next two were my two
[1:17:52] key verses in my life at that age show
[1:17:55] me thy ways o Lord teach me thy paths
[1:17:58] lead me and I truth and teach me for
[1:18:01] thou art the God of my salvation on thee
[1:18:04] do I wait all the day and those two
[1:18:08] scriptures that verse 4 in that verse 5
[1:18:10] those were the scriptures of my teenage
[1:18:12] years those were the ones that I rested
[1:18:15] on those are the ones that I believed in
[1:18:17] when I prayed when I when I kneeled down
[1:18:19] in prayer or wherever I was in my
[1:18:21] bedroom I was always laying in bed at
[1:18:24] night with my flashlight even sometimes
[1:18:26] I'd be praying those two verses to God
[1:18:29] that God would teach me his ways and
[1:18:31] show me his past he guided me in truth
[1:18:34] and teach me
[1:18:35] amen and a few if you know my testimony
[1:18:39] you know I I don't have anything more
[1:18:42] than probably a 5th grade education I
[1:18:44] didn't go to I quit school and I was
[1:18:46] about 11 years old a man and growing up
[1:18:48] you know always having that a complex of
[1:18:53] thinking other people were smarter than
[1:18:55] me you know I was watching my friends in
[1:18:57] high school and I never went to high
[1:18:59] school you know and I never went to
[1:19:01] middle school and watching my friends
[1:19:03] grow up I always felt that everybody
[1:19:05] else was smarter than I was you know and
[1:19:07] always thinking the air base was better
[1:19:09] than you and I always had a complex in
[1:19:10] my life you know and I always wanted to
[1:19:13] make sure that is never in a position
[1:19:15] that my ignorance would show you know
[1:19:19] that I always want to make sure that I
[1:19:20] had
[1:19:21] a way to prove myself that I was smarter
[1:19:23] than everybody else
[1:19:24] you know I'd read books and read that
[1:19:27] and always trying to figure out what I
[1:19:29] was missing out on that everybody else
[1:19:30] knew but me yelling and and and all of
[1:19:33] that and all that all those complexes
[1:19:36] and different things I had growing up
[1:19:38] amen and I constantly prayed Lord teach
[1:19:41] me all our ways and show me your pass
[1:19:43] and now I can look back and I look back
[1:19:47] where all my friends ended up and my
[1:19:52] friends they ended up in divorce Minh
[1:19:54] and an abuse and in this and in that and
[1:19:59] and different things that they ended up
[1:20:01] in and I can look back some of them gone
[1:20:05] into witchcraft and and vampire type
[1:20:08] stuff and just all the wickedness of
[1:20:10] this earth that you can imagine and
[1:20:13] homosexuality and I perverseness and
[1:20:17] pornography and I and I see where all my
[1:20:19] friends that scattered to the four winds
[1:20:21] I grew up in church with and yet here am
[1:20:24] I
[1:20:25] he taught me his ways he showed me his
[1:20:29] paths he guided me in truth and
[1:20:31] righteousness for his namesake and now I
[1:20:35] can say I trust in the Lord all the day
[1:20:37] long he kept me my prayers paid off let
[1:20:41] me tell you now I am the Abraham Amen I
[1:20:45] am the Abraham I am the one that entered
[1:20:47] into faith I am the one that turn into
[1:20:49] belief I am the one that God has not
[1:20:52] withheld anything from me as soap that
[1:20:56] can be your testimony as well that you
[1:20:58] trust in the Lord and never no I'm not
[1:21:00] saying that your life will be easy I'm
[1:21:03] not saying that you won't go through
[1:21:04] hard times I went through some rough
[1:21:06] times I got a five year period of my
[1:21:08] life that I was the most depressed
[1:21:10] person in the city pretty much but God
[1:21:13] brought me out but God saw me through a
[1:21:16] man God delivered me and brought me up
[1:21:19] out of that thing Amen my god he has
[1:21:22] been my God he's been my companion I
[1:21:24] have a relationship with him that no man
[1:21:27] can take away a man that's my testimony

[1:26:12] the days of our life
[1:26:14] let it be into us supportive they were
[1:26:16] lonely ass
[1:26:16] [Music]
[1:26:21] they were
[1:26:25] I believe as possible you believe as
[1:26:28] possible to choose Jesus Christ you
[1:26:30] believe it's possible that he'll guide
[1:26:32] you throughout all your life and when
[1:26:34] you make this choice do you look back
[1:26:36] throughout the route when the book of
[1:26:40] your life is written then you look back
[1:26:41] at your time you look back and see oh my
[1:26:44] god let me make that choice God or gain
[1:26:48] that choice for me God ordained this
[1:26:50] choice week Hey look back you say I'm
[1:26:52] glad that God or game-breaker
[1:26:55] when your testimony will be that the
[1:26:58] Lord Jesus Christ is with every step of
[1:27:01] the way he is with me all the days of my
[1:27:03] life in every chart test in every trial
[1:27:06] God was there holding my hand God was
[1:27:09] there revealing himself to me
[1:27:14] [Music]
[1:27:19] close out the service amen I hope you're
[1:27:23] a blessed hope you're entering in the
[1:27:26] face they meant it's possible just like
[1:27:29] blind Bartimaeus was wondering if the
[1:27:32] guy of Jehovah with still reveal himself
[1:27:34] in his day so he found out not only that
[1:27:38] he was passing by right that moment so
[1:27:42] is it true this day that the God of
[1:27:44] heaven is here to reveal itself in 2020
[1:27:53] [Music]
[1:28:16] the prophet of God says
[1:28:24] so you are a product
[1:28:27] and five years for coming all the choice
[1:28:32] you're gonna make today getting to Bryce
[1:28:41] get it brother branham towles is that
[1:28:47] the age of accountability is just seven
[1:28:49] years old that's what you start knowing
[1:28:51] derived from the wrong so we don't
[1:28:54] really matter how old you are if you are
[1:28:57] just seven years old but when Jesus
[1:29:01] Christ was you know the disciples of
[1:29:04] Jesus Christ they were trying to stop
[1:29:05] the allottee the little kids to come pay
[1:29:07] him and he says don't stop them because
[1:29:11] the kingdom of God is theirs
[1:29:12] so we just need that simplicity color
[1:29:16] choice you are going to make you're
[1:29:18] going to be judged by that choice so
[1:29:20] many times you feel like God is talking
[1:29:23] your heart but the devil is always
[1:29:25] telling you to postpone oh maybe next
[1:29:28] service
[1:29:29] maybe next Sunday I like when he was
[1:29:32] talking about the story of blind but to
[1:29:33] be his the people were trying to hush
[1:29:36] him he would say Jesus Christ son of God
[1:29:39] have mercy on me he was trusted no
[1:29:44] matter how old you are no matter how
[1:29:46] what situation you are
[1:29:49] if you up if you feel something trying
[1:29:51] to rush you that's the devil he doesn't
[1:29:53] want you to get closer to God so just
[1:29:56] ignore that if you come to God you
[1:30:05] [Music]
[1:30:13] [Music]
[1:30:22] [Music]
[1:30:25] it's okay just probably sing the song
[1:30:28] then each and every one kneel down
[1:30:31] pray whatever you don't have to pretend
[1:30:36] to God you know we can all pretend
[1:30:39] trying to hide our pasta you know you
[1:30:42] don't want to show it to your friends or
[1:30:44] your people around you but you know God
[1:30:46] draws your heart
[1:30:47] so everyone just in your own way pray to
[1:30:51] God just pour out your heart to him you
[1:30:54] know what you need you know what you
[1:30:56] want God to help you with probably you
[1:30:58] in school you probably have a habit in
[1:31:01] addiction or whatever it is God is there
