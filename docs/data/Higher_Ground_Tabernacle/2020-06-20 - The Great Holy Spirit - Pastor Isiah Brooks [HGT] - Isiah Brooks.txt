Pentacles Amen we want that same power [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] and we've got no things are going we know that the earth is at a position where it is just preparing itself for fire baptism there is no hiding place how you want to say it but we are looking for a translation and the only way that we're going to see that is that we God's Way of provision I have a friend father God we come before your Lord and thank you for your amazing grace he thank you for being so good to us you have been better to us we have been to ourselves we thank you for being so good to us we come in contact with this virus that what ever they must go through I pray that we're praying right now for total deliverance and healing people that you have purchased with your blood we pray that you would give them complete victory Lord in your name we pray that you would bless the family the church family their Lord that you would rid them of this devil you sent Lord in your word no evil shall come nigh our dwelling place and father we believe that Satan tempt us but it can't overcome you are the overcome a Lord and we pray father God that you would touch everybody each and every one of them that have come in contact with this spirit and that you will appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ as we stand I appreciate that song amen Oh Lord I remember when I first came into the message the stomping of the feet and the clapping of their hands we would have such a great Jubilee I'll try my best not to be long I've got my grandson Nehemiah with me surprise he came to play the guitar but I told him that was gonna but anyway I said that just so I won't forget god is good to us and as we stand let us turn to acts 1 in 8 we're going to be ministering tonight on the Great Holy Spirit sometimes I think people think that the Holy Spirit showed up at the time but we want everybody to know that the Holy Spirit has been here when no one else was the Holy Spirit is not a second person or third person he is the person he is Elohim itself existing one and so I'm bringing these things out tonight so that we can see the battle that we have in front of us that we must face I can recall in a point in time when Paulo said that he would be in bondage to no man and you and I must know that we must have that Constitution as well that we were in bondage acts 1 in 8 reads but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth can we go also to acts 2:17 beginning aired at the 17th verse at the 2nd chapter in the book of Acts and Akane and it shall come to pass in the last days I like that ya see God I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy and I will show wonders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire vapor of smoke the Sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before that great and notable day of the Lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall say let us pray father God we come before your Lord as humble as we know how we thank you for being good to us you say this all the time because father Lord tonight they made a sacrifice and I pray father that you know in your book like Oh God we pray tonight we come to lift you up big where ever the name Jesus has spoken we we get happy and glad Lord because we realize tonight there is no other name given under heaven whereby we must be saved there is no substitute or any type of generic brand that of you that we could fall to there is only one true and living God and his name and your name is the Lord Jesus Christ thank you Father for allowing us to be here we pray that you would bless the word and North the word and launch a service service but give us for any and everything that we have done that have not been according to your word Lord we are the dust of the earth we are word that the Scriptures saying we are we are creatures you may be seated there are so many people today and I'm just going to kind of go in this kind of capacity but we believe that you receive the Holy Ghost by an experience now a lot of people say you don't have to experience anything but according to the message of the baptism of the Holy Ghost nineteen fifty eight nine and twenty eight the prophet of God said we believe that includes himself that we must have an experience not by their mystical intellectual conception of the scripture but by an experience that you you alone know now if you want to know whether it was the Holy Ghost watch how your life patterns after that it'll tell what kind of a spirit come into you I think that's the greatest way of looking at it if you are Christian and you say you got the Holy Ghost what is the reflection of your life after the experience that is the thing that tells you what's on the inside now a lot of time when people get the Holy Ghost they they make excuses and we all have done it many times we say well you know we're saved by grace that's absolutely the truth but we also know that Jesus says if you love me you'll keep my Commandments there's a law that's greater than all laws and that is the law of love and we know that when it comes to God and God's people in this last day the people lack love and love for God I must say that again the people are lacking the love of and the love for God and we know that the love of the truth about that you must love truth and we understand that God is true he is the only truth everything else is a lie all right and because they asked Pilate I believe I asked him what is true when he already knew the answer because he went out to the audience that was about to crucify him and he said Pilate said I find no fault in him and that that is how truth is expressed you can't find any Fault in the truth now we realize that we are preparing for a world to come this is what it's all about according to st. John 14 I believe Jesus said let not your heart be troubled if you believe in God believe also in me and he goes on to say that he in his father's house there are many mentioned and if it wasn't so he would not have told you he goes on to say I'm going to prepare a place for you that where I am there ye may be also so we realized that the Holy Goals did not come to the world just to make you feel good and it's not a feel-good thing it's all about the character of Christ and this is where we we seem to fall short churches all over the world they figure if you could shout if you could dance if you can speak in tongues if you can run up and down the aisle you know pay your tithes whatever feel away with the wind fear the fire see the fire you know all of those things are great and all of those things are good but you can do all those things and have the experience of all those things and still yet not have the Holy Ghost the Bible says make your calling and election sure and I know one thing one real real true way of receiving the real Holy Ghost it is according to acts 2 and 38 where the Bible says repent to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is a transformer it comes to change you not only that it comes can I say it like this it literally comes to kill you it is here to burn all of the old world out of you said also that all of the new world can come into you the Bible calls us a chosen generation according to first Peter 2 and 9 through 10 it says but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and I want to bring that back down to a chosen generation because you must understand that when this was written I wasn't there but in that phrase generation or in that word phrase chosen generation it means that God's generation is not according to time but it's according to eternity and when God chooses you he told you not in the time that you was born or in the time that you decided to be a Christian but the Bible tells us that he chose us before the foundation of the world he chose us amen and put our names in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world in the beginning so you say well brother what are you saying we come to recognize our salvation but we who are chosen of God must understand that we have a covenant which is unconditional which is something that God did himself it's not what you do for him is what he does for you and we must understand that the Holy Ghost is a seal of promise you understand me that means before the foundation of the world God promised you and me you and I he promised us that he would give us only ghost with the seal it would be your seal hallelujah and if God promised it nothing can stop him from doing so I believe this is why Paul said who can separate me from the love of God nothing no trials no tribulations no failures hello because the probably God displaying to us he says you and I were failures to begin with but God makes us victorious by giving us his holy spirit hallelujah I love it I love it a royal priest you're not just a chosen generation but we are a royalty we are a holy nation a peculiar people that we should show forth the praises of him who have called you out of darkness and I trust you've been called out of darkness you can't stand in darkness and light at the same time you either got to be in darkness or in light is that right the Bible said make your eye single because of your eye or double the Bible says you're still in darkness in other words you're still double minded Alleluia that means a lot to me when I think about making my eyes single is that right because Jesus told that woman at the well I'm gonna give you water where you're never third again and a true Christian with the true experience never thirst for the things of the world doesn't mean it doesn't temptation doesn't come but you don't thirst for oh no no hallelujah Satan will come here tempt you here try you because of this flesh but it is the inner meaning that locks the outer man down is that right it's the inner man it's that Holy Ghost feel in a man a man that pushed his flesh in his place hallelujah oh my the piper tells us there was a time when we weren't people but we we became people because of God's election because of God's foreknowledge and and we know that by God's grace he called us we didn't choose him he chose us and because of this you we could you quit I don't know how else to say it but we can roll our shoulders back in confidence that he that begun the good work in you is completely its faithful nothing he's not slack about it he's faithful to complete it hallelujah I just wanna read something here because you and I have heard of the story of Samuel and Saul and this comes the portion I'm going to read will be coming from First Samuel 11th chapter 2 through 4 y'all remember when the people of God Israel wanted a king and they had Samuel the Prophet but they wanted a king and that's just the way it is people are like that all over the world they like that in churches they're like that like the probably God said if the preacher's wife wear a certain kind of hat next Sunday you're going to find other people with the same kind of hat because people will not they want to imitate they love to look like somebody else or they like to be in the uppity up but a real Christian could care less and you and I must understand by God's grace this is where you come in we're not followers of the crowd every man must stand for himself most of the time the majority is wrong but the Bible tells us that God has never left himself without a witness now you know the story it really broke samia's hard because samuel was a faithful prophet he he literally loved the people of Israel he never took their money he never abused him he never had a bad report he was a real reflection of God and matter of fact where the Benham said that Sam you in this story is likened unto the Holy Spirit and we find out that what had happened is that the people wanted a king they looked around they saw the Baptist the Methodist Presbyterian the Pentecostals and message people and they wanted a king when they already had one the King wasn't samuel but the king was living in samuel it was God a man manifested in flesh right before them but they weren't satisfied they wanted a salt and if you read first samuel 11 you'll find out that right at the time that they were choosing saw there was a king by the name of me hash he was an Emma Knight and the Bible said he came up and encamped about just the Gilead and all the being of judgment said unto me hash make a covenant with us and we will serve you now somehow they had lost a vision already had they understood that Shammi was a dead that mean God wasn't dead either now be all fainting in some way they want a king but now they're confronted they've got something that that that not that now is going to confront them and look how look how weak they are they they're ready to submit until they Emma nice now let me read on and they hatch they emanate answered them on this condition will I make a covenant with you that I made thrust out all your right eyes and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel see is that they were moving away from the inspiration of the holy spirit being led by God and wanted to become a system Saul is a type of the system Saul is a type of the denomination in organization hallelujah they big they seem to be above everybody else great Baptist Methodist Catholic Presbyterian you name it but there's always a small little group that will always stay with the leadership of the Holy Spirit but what was it can you imagine you're in a war or somebody coming to take over your country or your city or your church how it may be and they said but I make a covenant in other words I'll let you live but I want to take out your right eye now you must understand that the right eye is the spiritual eye you know when they chose Saul God was showing them right at the moment you haven't lost your right eye and I'm gonna read something for you in just a moment and the elders of jabish said unto him give us seven days respite that we may send messengers and to all of the coast of Israel and then if there be no man to save us we will come out to be chief they forgotten about God they have forgotten about the Holy Spirit right and they forgot that samuel was there hallelujah now you say what brother was what he just just bear with me for a moment then came the messages to Gilead of Saul and told the tidings in the ears of the people and all the people lifted their voices and wept hey there was afraid and that's the way it usually is when you leave God when you leave the leadership of the Holy Spirit fear accompany come be you is that right I heard the prophet of God said he said Samuel represented the holy spirit it's all represented the system and the people chose saw over the holy spirit and remember when Saul did what he did God gave him an evil spirit and when you reject the Holy Ghost God will give you an evil spirit that's why you see people fussing and fighting and nagging nationally each other and supposed to be Christians because somewhere they have missed the Holy Ghost and God has given them an evil spirit and they don't even know it coming from the message reject the king I told you I was gonna take my time after all the warnings had been given then finally they wanted the king anyhow so Saul was anointed king the first thing taking place the enemy slipped in on one side and put the right eye out of a lot of the people of God you know the story is found here in Samuel he goes on to say 8 9 10 but it was found in 11 but there but there right I put that right out can you imagine that that's just what the enemy wants to do that's what the enemy is trying to do tonight is put the right eye of God people out come on that's happening right now everywhere you go the enemy is trying to put the right out out people the system is the spirit like Laodicea is experienced hallelujah but the Bible says they that are led by the sons of led by the Spirit they are the sons of God hallelujah right that's what the enemy is trying to do tonight put the right eye of God's people out you notice that it was the right eye the one that spiritual if he can put spiritual sight out of your eye where you see the natural things and not the spiritual things he's got you whipped right there right and that's what happens to Israel happen many times it happened when Pharaoh came upon them they lost it right I think they became carnal Lord did you call us out here to die hallelujah it took God to give them sight again hallelujah David is the only one that I know at at the time of war you know he did not lose his eyesight when it came to Goliath he knew what God had done with the lion the bear and he knew that his his eyesight was clear I'm not the one that's doing the work he's doing the work and I'm gonna follow him no matter how foolishly it may appear to all the others I'm gonna be led by the Holy Ghost you say well what about the whole church all of Israel backed up in a corner Wow because they will come they lost the right eye the lie is Bluffs Goliath threats made them forget who their God was hallelujah but when a with a real true son and daughter of God when they are spiritual nothing can put their outside out they don't have to see God they don't have to feel him because they know he's dead I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you that's what's happening to a lot of Christians right now first of all when the devil put your right eye out the first thing you must know is that you don't love God the way you used to love huh that's what happened it's real they lost it first love why would you wanna King when God has given you everything his protection was already there hallelujah and you and I must understand why would I need you know I'm your pastor but I'm not your head I can make pulses follow me as I follow Christ but the moment I stopped following Christ you don't have to follow me cuz you're not following me anyhow you're following Christ hallelujah brother branham said it like this he said like it's so confused uh he said that's what happens sometimes he said I got something in my mind in my heart to do and I'm just I could tell you where to find it but he said didn't I have somebody say well brother Bentham the Lord told me that tell you that you should go here and then another person says the Lord told me to tell you that you should go he said that's what makes me so nervous because people want me to do what they want me to do he said from now I'm gonna do what God tells me to do see and you have to learn to be able to hear the voice of God the leadership of God is an individual thing you must be able to have another only goes to know when God is talking to you hallelujah I hope you're being blessed tonight I'm just taking my time anyway let's move on he goes on to say you noticed it was the right eye the one that spiritual if he could put that the spiritual right future sight out of your eyes where you were you see the natural things and not the spiritual things he's got you whipped right there and that's here it is that the Lord is soon to come we bout ready typical translation and everybody is trying to save their life I'm not talking about in the spiritual I mean in a natural I need a big I need a bigger car I need a bigger house I need this I need that I need this and the Bible said the cares of the world is going to choke the love of God out of their heart and that's what's happening people are more concerned about the way that's okay the Titanic is going down and I've got my jewels on the basement floor I got to run down to the basement floor to get my jewels and you treasure your jewels or possessions more than you do your life your life is the greatest thing you can possess it's the gift of God if I had been there I would have been looking for the first lifeboat a way of escape you understand me forget all of that if I live long I can get that and more but right now my life is a state and that's what's wrong and that's what's happening now our focus is being on everything but loving God but loving God oh I love God but I'm not willing to sacrifice don't you know that love is sacrificial you can't love somebody in those sacrifice Christ Jesus was the greatest sacrifice that God could ever give his whole life was toward others not himself fastest foxes have holes and birds have nests but the Son of man has no place to lay his oh my think about it he said brother listen what we mean today is an old time backward sing killing revival the Bible wholly goes back into the church a gain in the power God over the audience and the people filled with the Holy Ghost that's what we need today and if that would take place every wall of denomination differences would be broke down the oneness to Tunis to three mr. Church of God the pilgrim hole of this necromancy reason all of them together would be shouting and eating off the same Apple now I think about our group because we systemized it and you know we have come to a place where here ain't nobody else is going but us and none of us know that because a lot of us ain't going but message people don't want to hear that cause we're in the message that ain't got nothing to do with it look at the millions of Jews that was in the message billions and only two out of that generation cave and crossed over and you think God has just something with you know history repeats itself the only people that's going to cross over are those who are chosen elected of God to cross over whoever they may be because your religion is not what God is looking for God never looked for religion if he was looking for religion he wouldn't talk Adam and Eve that's okay what you did is okay no-ho-ho God is looking for life that comes from the blood that's what God is looking for when I see the Blood I pass over you that's the Holy Ghost in a mature way in our day hallelujah what emphasis or what of some of the other church agents were able to get get away with by God's grace you and I won't be right because remember even in the church age book when God began to bring Luther and Wesley and all of them out he told him you got a name you don't have my name but we won't his name this is what the message came to do give us his name and the only way we can have his name is through a marriage ceremony right that's gotta be an experience don't tell me oh I'm married but I never had an experience of it no that's a great celebration even in the natural when someone comes together to be married right and those God just don't you know we got those who said we're just gonna go to a judge and so I mean a real marriage with a real preacher you always have witnesses somebody to witness that you got married in the spiritual you have always somebody to witness what you've got listen he says listen why they would would would be so brotherly and sisterly there wouldn't be not even one thought of it but you see we will do pattern after something of the world and that's the thing everybody is this one gets me I don't care what they doing over in these different states in the different churches and what they do that's what they do we to be concerned about what we do what God is leading us to do we're not here to pattern after somebody else's church to become big and great like somebody else let us be us let us do what God has planted us to do here we are otherwise we become mimics of something else right like somebody else got a little preacher then we go get a little preacher looking for God is looking for originality he's looking for people who had contacted him and they are able to perform the Word of God wherever they may be wherever they live hallelujah and because other churches is doing certain things certain way does that make it message no what makes this message is the word all these other stuff is extra right you don't even have to sing to be in the message you don't have to be a preacher or nobody being what you do have to be is a child of God that's been born again of the Holy Ghost and what both know what people don't see is that sickness off in all this beauty and all this pomp he's there right but let's remember in choosing of the bride when that little girl who was a dishwasher wasn't popping about her wasn't nothing beautiful that we know of it was the character that man fell in love with this is what God falls in love with when it comes us character it must be his character let me hurry up a man she the same things got into our nation our nation used to be governed by real true politics Christians who go together and pray and come out or norwich and try to govern our nation's now it's just a honeycomb as it can be with everything cricket they tell me that the common is all over the country free thinkers and all them kinds of stuff of organization rising up and it's just in such a state there's there's not no stop to it and in it's only shows one thing that the true king the son of God is coming to take over and reign just as certain as we're in this convention tonight so you and I you said well what is this all of this is the coronaviruses for the bride trying to wake her up trying to shake her stir her up so that we can see the power of God that in just one Lumis time God shut the whole world out right not one nation could resist what God had allowed to be released and here we are looking right at it trade of it and unite in this time should be rejoicing because the Bible said look up when you see all of these things knowing that your Redemption draws nigh this is not a time to fear this is a time to - if I could say cheer and herald the coming of the Lord and see that's what happened to Samuel I saw excuse me Saul followed the Lord Jesus or could I say like this saw followed the Holy Spirit and whatever Samuel would tell him to do he did it but you remember the time that Sammy told him not to wait here till I get back I'll make up the offering the sacrifice unto the Lord and install God in himself because God had blessed and see that's what a lot of time happens to the people in the message they get really blessed and all of a sudden they figure they can say no no no no no because god bless you does it give thank you thank you so special that you can cross the line into sinning no we must always keep the Word of God first all the time and when God told Saul I saw sambito saw way here he had allowed the people to rush it Sammy is too late he's not he's not coming back you know and but we can't do what we need to do until the offering is made so what I'm saying to you that's that's a lot of a lot of preachers fall into that but pastor I just think we need to do this and pastor I think we need to do that and they don't never say well you know the Lord show room it's always I think I think anything about I think I can't even do what I think right we need to we need to really seek God at this power I believe with all my heart and maybe I'm crazy if I'm crazy I'm crazy but my point is I really believe that God want us to do a gonna have a revival in this city I believe that with all of my heart I just can't get through it I can't get over it it's just something that has been stamped in my heart even though I know people don't believe it's gonna happen but I believe that even with this little group if we get a lot of card and seek the Lord for his will it has to happen I believe that because all of you are expecting something you're looking for something something on the inside got you with an expectation that you can't even explain that's the Holy Spirit he puts the expansion expectation there so when it comes you'll recognize it and jump on there you know that little fellow down in and I own a Zulu Street see more he never experienced the power but he knew it was something there it's almost like Christopher Columbus I I know there's land there I've never seen it but I know it's there you know and you and I this is the way I feel I know this is revival usually the revival is over well maybe for the whole world I'm talking about this little group right here we need a revival I need one you know I need God to remove every bit of trash out of my life Oh tell me y'all must not have any but all I know is I need I need the extra power I need the extra strength to press through this darkness that we're living in oh my god but Samuel whenever you get to the place II just saw he says and that's how they do it they always use the profit to to make them look good now everybody in this message every preaching this message would have never been anything without the messenger it was his gospel it was God's gospel through him that gave us understanding of this word but we must always lean more to the spirit than we do to the arm of the flesh he even says it how he waited on God many times and there were times he did not wait on God because of the pressure of the people I think that was Africa when he had caught that niba because they wanted the preachers wanted him to go one way in the angel the Lord told him to go the other see it's so easy to do people it's so easy to be confused by people and people always mess you up nothing wrong with opinions but when you pressure a person to do something then that's not quite right but anyway let's move on you see because that's what Samuel Samuel if he had only waited for me excuse me I keep saying Sammy but I mean Saul if Saul could have only waited for the return of Samuel he would have been ok but it was the people all come on we didn't made this great conquer and you know uh uh in order to please God we got to give him the best the best of the chief or the best of the goat invest of this no but the Word of God say slay it all kill every animal kill the King of Thieves children killed everything but because of the pressure the people they didn't so let me say it like it brother I'm saying if you don't destroy the demon the demon will destroy and so Sam you knew that you got to kill the king where did the King demon is he's got to die right and when he came back Samuel came back to Saul says oh you said you've done all you supposed to do but what is the bleeding what is all the sound I hear in the back right so I want you to understand it doesn't matter how much you say I'm sanctified I'm clean I filled with the Holy Ghost if there's demons in your life it will produce a noise people don't recognize that there's something that's going on and I'm hearing it or I'm seeing it it's not dead yet that's the message the message is a it's the sword of God to kill everything to conquer all of the land the chemical every demon this is what the message is for that's why God gave the Prophet the King's sword and where did the Kings sword go is now in the hands or in the mouths of the bride we have it there's no reason why we cannot conquer this flesh and all of the things that the flesh produced we are here to conquer it and God is expecting us to conquer it hallelujah every preacher many preachers have made themselves filthy rich over this message but they're allowing the enemy to come into camp sisters are not dressing the way they should you say dress don't make it a different yes it does the Holy Ghost will make you dress right right brothers doing what they doing worldly things I wonder right now what people are doing now there's more importance in church somehow it seems like the right eyes don't people don't feel God they don't love him we preach this gospel so sweet and we left out the bitter and remember when John ate the scroll it was bitter antsy and that bitter pot is you got to do right you got to live right you got to stop dressing like the world acting like the world hanging with the world a true Christian want to be around Christian people they want to be around Christians amen who's got a life and not alive we build this you find preachers who want to make her name and you know that's what Lucy was there in the time of Babel it wasn't in the beginning because that's what I wanted to make and it's amazing how God can change it around and he said to Abraham see it's God who makes you great not you who makes yourself great amen is God who lifts you up or God who brings you down but when God does it and he'll do it he says seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all of these other things will be added but we're not here to be Canaan we're not here to make our said that's not the holy state I'm telling you there brother in New Testament you reach something I can't pronounce this day right now but what the Bible said that he loved when you come in and all of a sudden you gotta you gotta know want people know any focus on is us I love that that's why I love about Jesus it's us having preeminence or what hallelujah you understand me they no right to disbelief Sam you because Samuel was always prophesied the truth to them he told them what was truth but he said now if you just just lets all and all of you follow the leading of this spirit it's that the truth why do you tell them Sam you say listen not only will they make you yo yo yo yo yo your sons are warriors and everything but he couldn't make yo yo your daughter's hair meetings in and what they call it and and they gonna make your your your soldiers armor bearer I love the head because of that not what you see in the message you see the preacher walking and he got his armor-bearer carrying his Bibles and everything that's the modern-day armor bearer so if there's an armor bearer that must be a king somebody help me that's the Bible what is it's a system that people are falling into the bomb said he whom the Sun is set free is free indeed and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty when man began to lead the church it becomes religion versus salvation God has many religions many religions but God God is looking for those who have salvation listen he said and when you die it is and that's what Pedro is that oh I'm in the message because I look like I'm all right but the Pharisees dress right they did you couldn't put a thing on their lives nothing about them was sexy everything look holy but the Bible tells me that the Pharisees were dead inside and that's what happens you see that all over Christians but they're dead inside no joy no peace but full of lust his only change is listen and a lot of time people will have I died the message when you die in the message meaning that you've got and you've been sealed with the Holy Ghost that's how you die in the message you don't die in the message she went to a message Church hallelujah you're not even to believe it because you go to a message Church hallelujah because a pig stop eating slop doesn't stop him from being a pig the only thing that changes a pig has changed in nature be and when you die remember it doesn't change your spirit it only changes your dwelling place and whatever type of spirit you got in you that's the place it will in other words it's the place where you will go sin could never into heaven so you said oh brother looks it just says knowing the message remembering the message knowing who the messenger is you know and all of those things will that put me in heaven know the people followed Moses they know Moses law and everything else they talked with Moses can I say like this they even listen to a snake but it did not give them the holy go and you find out that when it comes to people they have a system I see it everywhere I hate it it just gets next to me when I see people when we so program with certain songs and but you know there's no jubilance in it there's no joy there's no satisfaction I say well the choir even when I was in school and enjoyed it but that's not what we we gotta connect with heaven somehow and I mean everybody from the pulpit to the back of the door we must and it is needful that we find a way to connect with heaven so that we can hear him speak to us clearly that's what we need that's what the best is provided I just believe that brother Branham was telling us all these stories about talking to God so that we can see that we can talk to win is it that right if we have been the seals have been opened right and breslin's that it places us back into the place of Eid before the phone did not Adam and Eve talked to God they talked to him they knew him he wasn't some mystical thing he was a person he spoke back with them and that's the relationship we must have I don't know what people want to give it all to the Prophet when he was just the first wave of what was supposed to come I don't know what you're thirsting for but I thirst for that kind of relationship with God not every now and again every day I'm a come on stop in just a minute the Holy Ghost is the leader in the rejected King but never said but then when Saul wouldn't wait on the Lord no more Sam you turn right away from him remember is that right when you know wait on God's Holy Spirit turn you said not in our day again see time remember when brother Branham got a head of the Holy Spirit and it came to that young boy baby boy are being healed and they had had to be in the way the mother-in-law had to come in and just one had to come in and everything but he got ahead of them and said I pronounce healing and when he did the boy got sicker huh and then he said oh so bad I realized things were it was in the vision and I had to say Oh God forgive me don't let this child die I didn't mean to do it Lord I didn't mean to do it then God allowed him to learn is the teaching him right wait I don't care for take an hour for that hat to move wait everything must be according to the vision way hallelujah and then when everything got according to the vision he went to the husband and wife oh oh I'm so sorry this is what happened this is what happened but now everything's in place and he talks about dust at the Lord three days you know y'all know what I'm trying to say I don't have any my notice inspired but I want you to understand that you and I were the same way God must teach us how so here is voice to listen and to win that's really not to your own understanding and knowledge him in all your ways and he shall direct your path that's it Amen I'm almost done folks with this portion but the first time this all took upon himself to take over the service of the Lord Sam your turn is back on him and walked away from him and the first time that the church let their leaders take over to lead the people the Holy Spirit gets a right away from them and the very first time that you go being led by man instead of God the Holy Spirit would get away from you to let the Holy Spirit lead that's what we need is leadership and God gave us a leader and we don't hear is that Alright in there same as that you gotta go listen to it they just I just can't believe some of the things I was listening to I went looking for nothing I just Lord led me to it and when he led me to it oh my god I think I told some of the brothers how this it's just you know because I've seen a system a long time now it's the thing that I I always hated and I'm saying yeah we're in the message but you know I've gone places and you know you have to sit some time like Methodist you came out when you're gonna shout you know I've gone to places you know it you know they hate I had a brother approached me about my tambourine I'm like no I don't care what you say about but every the vision I saw I said I was even in heaven playing the tambourine so you're not taking about you don't like my beats I play under the inspiration of God that's what I do so you love the Lord see let me go and close on this I say that let me give me give me at least two more minutes there is many fine churches in the world today but there is one miss Jesus that's bringing forth the real truth born again create creators creatures of God you know what I mean you don't don't you her name is not Methodist her name is not Baptist her name is Jesus miss Jesus sure she is she is bringing forth people not members of the Methodist Church she's not bringing forth a Baptist Church a Presbyterian or Catholic she is bringing forth then born and rooted and grounded in Christ Jesus there she is that's her I'm so glad that I'm with her she's a mystical Church she don't have any denomination she carries none of these great big fancy names and big buildings she meets whosoever the members of the body gathered together they worship in spirit and in truth they were predestinated before the foundation the law in other words I'm trying to say this if you are Miss Jesus you can't help but to act like your predestinated you can't stop the joy that God that comes with your predestination you can't stop the peace you can't stop the love you can't stop all these great things that come with you being elected and chosen of God you can and don't let nobody else stop you no don't let them stop you people God is expecting us to hold the standard right you will one out of a million right and I just believe that there is something that God wants us to do here and I keep praying god help me no matter what if there's something I'm doing wrong whatever it may be deliver me give me strength place me in that place I'm not trying to be nothing but other than what I'm called to be and that's a part of the bride that's all I can't help I'm different I feel like it all the time I feel you know like I'm just I'm just different from everybody you know I I'm so glad this tone of ours I hate that people are dining it sick but it's giving me space to see his face to thinking faces you know reminisce and go through all that I've gone through it I've been saved and how many gears are Christian how many years and I've seen the supernatural seen all of that people but there's something that's not quite I'm not I know the best is happy I'm not looking for another message I know what I have is perfection but I want to see the perfection also changing living in that's what I want I know it's there Ryan you gotta search you gotta look together it's got to be quick and gooey because now it doesn't this is that internet it's God's doing it and I think if God it's like it's like a you know the three wise men they they knew something was behind that stop and they had to travel can you imagine how long and how far they traveled to get there from the time of that appearing of the star I think it took two and a half three years almost to get there how many of us was in constant like that in prayer just in prayer I'm going to stay there till I get to see the Messiah of this stop okay it's so much I want to say but anyway there brother madam goes on to say you know people who refuses the Holy Ghost they don't want to be judged and I don't know whether you noticed it but you can preach all these great mysteries and the people of shower when we start getting into their life and all the filth and things that they're doing they don't like and they don't they don't they'll call you second pool they call you you know not deep enough and they don't even know us the whole ego trying to dig and then cut into him amen to call some attention so you know conviction and instead they go out with that critical spirit and they don't even realize that that that critical spirit has been given to him because they have rejected the Holy Spirit when Saul rejected the Word of God the evil spirit if you reject the Samuel when he whipped Samuel Hahnemann and you said the kingdom that he wasn't lost but God gave him the bad spirit and then you look all over the messages you can go with bad you know may God help we need the full manifestation I'm not gonna stop until I see visibly see the work of God in me like that Pilate said I know because I believe that the bride is supposed to be a woman he is so tied up and tangling up into the Word of God there'll be no spot amen you love Lord that's tan pictures and photographs the reason Tori's of every debt and there's a there must be some [Music] Oh to be [Music] to be pure
