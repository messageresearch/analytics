[0:00] Hallelujah I'm
[0:02] leaning on the Everlasting
[0:06] Arms so glad to be in the number
[0:09] [Music]
[0:10] amen as we
[0:13] stand let us turn
[0:15] to the
[0:18] scripture according to Ephesians
[0:22] please we're going to ask that you turn
[0:24] there and then we ask that you turn with
[0:26] us to
[0:27] Genesis Ephesians 3 and9
[0:31] you love
[0:33] God I just want to take my time this
[0:37] uh uh
[0:39] morning and uh I don't know why it feels
[0:43] a little chilly to me but if if you guys
[0:45] are okay then I'm all right Ephesians
[0:48] 3:9 I don't know I guess I'm from South
[0:52] Carolina amen hallelujah Ephesians 3:9
[0:58] and to make all men see
[1:00] what is the Fellowship of the mystery
[1:03] which from the beginning of the world
[1:06] have been hid in God who created All
[1:10] Things by Jesus Christ let us turn to
[1:15] Genesis two
[1:25] please coming from the 21st to the 25th
[1:29] verse of Genesis
[1:32] 2 you love the
[1:39] Lord and the Lord God caused a deep
[1:42] sleep to fall upon Adam and he
[1:45] slept and he took one of his ribs and
[1:48] closed up the flesh instead
[1:51] thereof and the rib which the Lord God
[1:54] had taken from man made a woman and
[1:58] brought her unto the man
[2:01] Adam said this is now bone of my bones
[2:05] and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be
[2:08] called woman because she was taken out
[2:12] of man therefore shall a man leave his
[2:15] father and his mother and shall cleave
[2:18] unto his wife and they shall be one
[2:22] flesh and they were both naked the man
[2:26] and his wife and were not ashamed
[2:31] let us pray father God we come before
[2:34] you
[2:34] as humbly as we know how we thank you
[2:38] for your goodness we thank you for your
[2:40] grace father God we just pray Lord God
[2:43] that this morning you would bless us in
[2:46] a special way give your servants
[2:49] utterance Lord that we may speak Lord
[2:52] the Oracles of god father forgive us
[2:55] Lord if we have said done or thought
[2:58] anything that wasn't pleasing in your
[3:00] sight father you are the one who can
[3:03] find iniquity if there be any iniquity
[3:06] in my life forgive me of my sin cleanse
[3:09] me from all unrighteousness Lord that
[3:12] your people may be able to hear from you
[3:15] Lord let your perfect will be done here
[3:16] this morning in Jesus Christ's name we
[3:19] pray amen you may be seated
[3:30] there are so many things that are
[3:31] happening in the
[3:34] world and uh you know but I I've really
[3:36] been just thinking about the Bride of
[3:38] Jesus Christ trying to concentrate on
[3:41] where God would have us to be and the
[3:44] inspiration that I should be
[3:45] under at this present time and I realize
[3:50] that we have had church for a long time
[3:52] I've been here what 7 years going on
[3:54] eight years and of course you all have
[3:56] assembled before I came uh but if those
[4:00] of you for those of you who were here
[4:01] Wednesday you know the message in which
[4:03] I preach on Wednesday night and I'm
[4:06] really serious about uh where God is
[4:09] taking us and where we are to uh uh go
[4:13] uh my message in this morning is return
[4:16] to where we belong and I want you to
[4:19] personalize it return to where you
[4:23] belong because amen this uh mystery that
[4:27] God has uh revealed to us in this last
[4:29] day before uh Malachi 4 we had no idea
[4:33] who we were what we were where we were
[4:35] going uh we actually were just church
[4:38] members and we thought that was good
[4:41] enough and then God sent us a Prophet by
[4:45] the name of William brandom and I thank
[4:46] God for him amen because I tell you what
[4:49] I think about him sometime and I wonder
[4:52] my God there's no way a man could have
[4:54] achieved all that he had achieved
[4:57] outside of the grace of God
[5:00] now we're in a day where you and I must
[5:03] understand that the world Amen is
[5:06] falling apart it really is uh the
[5:09] government the religious uh uh uh sect
[5:12] uh nobody knows what to do how to pull
[5:14] this thing together you know it's almost
[5:17] like you know they started it but they
[5:19] don't know how to finish it you know uh
[5:22] because man has prompt a lot of things
[5:25] uh uh changes in the world when the rich
[5:27] want to do something different they know
[5:29] how to do it and of course they fail to
[5:33] see the outcome sometime it it's like um
[5:37] uh you know how drilling for all but you
[5:41] you're not understanding that where you
[5:44] drilling is not a real safe place and
[5:47] all of a sudden what you thought was
[5:48] going to be a good product ends up
[5:51] spoiling the economy and the environment
[5:53] and all of these things so we're looking
[5:56] at a thing in where man has now doing it
[5:58] all over again like in the days of Noah
[6:00] brother brandham said they were the ones
[6:02] that were experimenting amen with the uh
[6:05] oxygen and the uh uh you know the H2O
[6:08] and all of these things that they were
[6:09] doing and it pretty much backfired and
[6:13] that's what he said he said we're living
[6:14] in an age where the intellig
[6:16] intelligence of man has now come to a
[6:19] place where it is backfiring on them and
[6:23] now they're trying to find a place of
[6:25] safety but we find out amen there's only
[6:28] one place of safety
[6:30] and that is in Jesus Christ uh when we
[6:33] look at the mystery what is this mystery
[6:36] because it's something that was hidden
[6:38] since the fall when Adam and Eve was on
[6:41] Earth they understood who they were they
[6:43] knew they were made out the image and
[6:45] likeness of God Amen they understood who
[6:47] their father was they knew where they
[6:49] came from and where they were going to
[6:53] amen so we want to dwell with that
[6:55] mystery a little bit we want to work
[6:57] with that uh so that you can plainly
[6:59] understand understand that you are a
[7:00] different people I was thinking uh this
[7:03] morning how that when Joshua uh uh came
[7:07] back with those uh other spies there
[7:09] were 10 fake spies and uh uh two that
[7:12] was really right and that was Joshua and
[7:14] Caleb and I said God I said we are
[7:16] determined to be a church of a good
[7:19] report amen we will not by the grace of
[7:22] God be like those 10 who says there is
[7:27] no way that we can do it hello somebody
[7:31] there will come a bride out of this
[7:33] church and she will be spotless she will
[7:36] be blameless she will be fully covered
[7:39] Amen in her royal garments I believe
[7:42] that amen by the grace of God so we find
[7:46] out amen that when we realize brother
[7:48] bam said that when Eve and Adam and I'm
[7:52] I'm going to go this way and I'll be
[7:53] going back and forth he said when they
[7:56] were on Earth before the fall they were
[7:58] veiled
[8:00] by a holy Veil now I don't know no other
[8:03] holy Veil outside of God it wasn't a
[8:06] piece of material or
[8:09] cloth it was God himself hello somebody
[8:13] you see well how can that be let me
[8:15] explaining how God can do something to
[8:17] you he can actually be right there and
[8:19] you won't see him on the road to
[8:22] EMAs right they talked with the Risen
[8:25] Savior they knew him they spent three
[8:27] and a half years with him and the Bible
[8:28] said Their Eyes Were Holden in other
[8:31] words Their Eyes Were veiled they
[8:33] couldn't see the very Messiah Hallelujah
[8:36] so even as God did it then uh uh God can
[8:40] do it now is that right he can Veil you
[8:42] from this world he said father I pray
[8:44] that there be in the world but not of
[8:47] the world we're not of this world even
[8:50] though we're in it now we we read that
[8:53] scripture uh by the grace of God because
[8:56] we wanted you to see uh as we explain uh
[8:59] a few Services ago how that when God
[9:02] took the rib out of uh
[9:06] Adam Adam he he didn't go find some
[9:09] other clay or some other dirt he he
[9:12] didn't look for something outside of
[9:13] Adam he literally took the rib of Adam
[9:16] and brother Adam said he took the very
[9:18] dirt that Adam was made out of and
[9:20] formed Eve in other words God was saying
[9:24] even in their natural they shall not be
[9:26] separated
[9:30] that's why God is redeeming your body
[9:32] because your body is still part of him
[9:35] now we look at the thing you and I must
[9:38] understand that when he looked and he as
[9:40] I said this morning or the other other
[9:42] week I love this because the Bible tells
[9:45] us that God breathed into Adam and and
[9:48] and and you find out when God let let me
[9:51] back up we realize amen that God first
[9:54] of all created Adam Spirit man y'all
[9:57] believe that according to Genesis 1:27
[10:00] God first created Adam in his very image
[10:04] and likeness and God Amen the image and
[10:08] likeness is not your
[10:10] flesh I'm going explain that to you amen
[10:13] just the way brother Bram explained it
[10:15] he said because that's not the image of
[10:17] God the spirit part The Soul Man was in
[10:21] the image of God he said basically
[10:23] because you got hands like a monkey and
[10:26] feet like a bear he said God gave that
[10:29] to Adam so that he could rule the
[10:31] natural world now be part of his kingdom
[10:35] but we find out that we fail to see that
[10:37] what God did he took a man and here the
[10:41] man is in a a spiritual being he's a
[10:43] spiritual being but he's leading his his
[10:46] animals like the Holy Spirit lead you
[10:49] you don't see him but he's there amen
[10:52] glory to God and so that's what Adam did
[10:55] for the first part of whatever time he
[10:57] had he led the animals and everything
[10:59] even though they didn't see
[11:01] him but God wanted to bring in a closer
[11:04] relationship so God formed Man Out of
[11:07] the Dust of the ground brother Bram said
[11:10] we are a tree right all of us believe
[11:12] that if you don't look at your feet it's
[11:14] that's where the the roots used to be
[11:16] come on somebody that's why you got toes
[11:20] amen it's right where the god cut the
[11:22] roots amen so we realize by the grace of
[11:25] God Amen that what God did he took man
[11:28] and remember to be fallen is to lay down
[11:31] God never sleeps nor
[11:33] Slumber Adam at that time didn't need
[11:37] rest y'all understand me he stood so God
[11:40] formed and I was thinking about this
[11:43] this morning I said when I was a young
[11:45] child we in art we would take balloons
[11:48] and we we make y'all know what a pinata
[11:50] is I love those things I sometime get
[11:52] inspiration to make one now but anyway
[11:55] you know I you know and you take those
[11:57] and you know you take we used to take
[12:00] balloons and we design or fashion the
[12:02] balloons like little animals or whatever
[12:05] else you want your P Piata to look like
[12:07] then we take uh uh some uh paste we made
[12:11] the paste out of flour and water and we
[12:14] take the newspapers and then we'd wrap
[12:16] those balloons up in newspaper connect
[12:18] them and everything else you know I had
[12:20] me a little donkey you know amen so
[12:23] anyway you do all of that and then you
[12:25] give that time and space for that pinata
[12:28] to to to to to dry out the the the paper
[12:32] and the and the page to dry out now the
[12:35] paper and and just only took the form of
[12:39] the
[12:40] balloons right in other words amen so
[12:43] therefore we find out that when God
[12:45] wrapped man and the Bible said formed It
[12:47] Out of the Dust of the earth it wasn't
[12:49] that God just made it he wrapped that
[12:51] spirit that soul that theop
[12:55] up y'all hear what I'm saying so we
[12:58] realize he formed Man Out of the Dust of
[13:00] the earth and the Bible said he
[13:05] breathed the breath of
[13:08] life and so what happened Adam stepped
[13:12] into right into the Natural Body if you
[13:15] want to say it that way or God breathe
[13:16] the the the the the the life in him and
[13:19] the thing that really gets me is because
[13:22] when God formed Eve he never had to
[13:27] breathe in into her
[13:30] nostril why because when he breathed
[13:33] into Adam's Hallelujah I'm trying to go
[13:36] slow here this morning but he breathed
[13:38] amen into Eve because remember amen
[13:42] their names were Adam but Adam and Eve
[13:45] made one man amen that's right one man
[13:50] Hallelujah they had the same mind they
[13:52] had the same spirit amen so much so when
[13:55] God called for Adam they both turn and
[13:57] say yes Lord see they were one and this
[14:01] is Shadow and type it's almost like a
[14:03] prophecy that God was revealing Amen to
[14:06] his people he was listen the Angels
[14:08] never understood what God was all about
[14:10] so God was trying to show
[14:13] them what he was all about and I showed
[14:16] you amen how that God Amen made a
[14:20] womb made a womb in Adam Adam had no
[14:23] womb God did an operation he put him in
[14:26] a coma right and he made womb and he
[14:29] birth Eve God slowed him back up oh come
[14:33] on showing that the woman comes from
[14:36] Adam and went back to Adam oh Lord help
[14:39] me Jesus showing by the grace of God
[14:42] what he was doing in his creation what
[14:44] he's going to do with the bride Adam had
[14:46] no other charge there was no other
[14:48] mate for Adam even after Eve
[14:51] fell there was no other the serpent he
[14:55] had done named all the animals amen so
[14:57] therefore nothing was compatible
[14:59] amen oh come on somebody it ought to
[15:02] make somebody happy here you say well
[15:04] I'm bride because I'm trying to get you
[15:06] to see that if you are bride you are
[15:09] redeemed redeemable amen you came from
[15:13] God
[15:14] Amen hallu listen the first body the
[15:18] Bible said the first Adam was Earthly
[15:21] right and the second Adam was a
[15:23] quickening spirit in St John and I'm
[15:26] jumping a little bit so I can just give
[15:28] you the thought this morning St John
[15:30] 3:23 Jesus telling the Pharisees and all
[15:33] these others who were critical he said
[15:35] ye are from beneath now I thought wait a
[15:39] minute ye are from beneath because you
[15:42] got to remember amen something took
[15:45] place God there was another world even
[15:48] though God created this world there was
[15:50] another world that God created and we
[15:53] call it
[15:55] hell and the Bible said that hell was
[15:57] created for the devil and his
[16:00] angels right but now he's telling these
[16:03] Pharisees and these Sadducees you are
[16:05] from beneath the Bible also tells us
[16:08] that hell has enlarged
[16:11] itself y'all hear what I'm saying so you
[16:14] got a first world you got a world that
[16:15] God created you got a second world which
[16:17] is called the world from beneath but
[16:19] there's another world coming cuz God
[16:22] works in
[16:24] threes Hallelujah so we're now living
[16:27] Amen in the world and right now we're
[16:29] living in a cross Zone if I can say it
[16:33] like that where God has said that heaven
[16:36] I mean Earth and hell is
[16:38] blending right you got a dimensional
[16:41] thing that's happening here and and what
[16:43] is it what is it doing it's making the
[16:45] True Believer
[16:46] uncomfortable it's making the Bri
[16:49] Hallelujah because the bride realized
[16:51] she's not created from for
[16:54] hell let me put it this way Jesus said I
[16:57] am from above
[16:59] and I got some good quotes here y'all
[17:00] just hold on he said I got he said I am
[17:03] I am from above I am not from beneath
[17:06] and I'll read the quote in the moment
[17:07] but I'm going to tell you what brother
[17:08] Brown said he said every
[17:10] Christian is born from
[17:13] above he said you came from God and you
[17:17] go back to God wherever Adam Jesus
[17:20] Christ was and is that's where we are
[17:23] now now let me move on because I want
[17:27] you to realize amen and the the serpent
[17:29] was a real smart little intelligent
[17:32] little
[17:33] fell and we find out that after Adam and
[17:37] and in Eve uh uh is separated and God
[17:41] has told them to be fruitful and to
[17:43] multiply and the reason why I took the
[17:45] 24th verse there where it says therefore
[17:47] shall y shall a man leave his father and
[17:49] his mother and and shall cleave unto his
[17:52] wife was showing the
[17:54] connection the connection amen even
[17:57] though God is is the Creator and and
[18:00] like I said you know all of us marry our
[18:04] sister if you don't marry your sister
[18:06] you in
[18:09] trouble right right come on somebody it
[18:11] was important amen for Abraham to find
[18:17] Isaac a sister to
[18:20] Mary you said it can't be it was because
[18:22] it was
[18:24] bloodline it was bloodline it came from
[18:26] the same father and mother amen come on
[18:29] somebody so my point is whenever you
[18:31] would marry and that's why God said
[18:33] don't marry among these and among those
[18:35] and the Canaanites and this that he was
[18:37] working with bloodline and those who
[18:39] would who came from
[18:43] Adam right and therefore we don't marry
[18:46] anybody that doesn't come from the
[18:49] second
[18:50] Adam if you do that you are marrying
[18:53] into the can
[18:56] lineage anybody know what I'm talking
[18:58] about
[18:59] so let me let me just back it up and
[19:00] slow down a little bit we look at this
[19:03] thing and I want you to understand that
[19:05] this natural adom was as brother R said
[19:08] he was God he was God over his world
[19:12] that was God's reflection that was God
[19:14] what God intent was to be to make Adam
[19:17] god of the Earth right now he was more
[19:20] than that because understand he had the
[19:22] power to change the
[19:25] atmosphere right so that's why
[19:29] amen that when Jesus came he just didn't
[19:31] do Miracles like Healing The Sick and
[19:34] just the natural things he also worked
[19:37] in the realm of the atmosphere he also
[19:40] worked in the realm of creation come on
[19:44] because he was here to declare what the
[19:46] first Adam was supposed to be
[19:48] like right I'm going to bring it up to
[19:50] our in just a moment because you've got
[19:52] to realize God didn't call you to be
[19:55] church members this stuff and and you
[19:58] know I was just listening uh by the
[20:00] grace of God to Jesus with dirty feet
[20:02] and you know what one statement brother
[20:03] brand said he said they were having too
[20:05] much fun to pay attention to
[20:09] Jesus and I thought to myself is that
[20:12] not like the worldly church today is
[20:15] that not like we we're having so much
[20:17] fun we don't have enough time for
[20:20] Jesus have mercy on us Lord have mercy
[20:24] but anyway we find out that the devil
[20:26] intent was to bring forth his lineage
[20:29] through uh in a position where he could
[20:33] continue the battle remember in the
[20:34] greatest battle ever fought brother said
[20:36] it started in heaven now it's where it
[20:38] was in Eden now it's no longer in Eden
[20:40] it's in your mind so we find out amen
[20:43] Satan amen wanted to be able to to
[20:46] battle and and bring this his dream or
[20:48] his vision to pass but understand what
[20:51] God did and you better thank him when
[20:54] you get to heaven for it
[20:59] thank you brother thank you brother no
[21:01] I'm going to thank him nowall right amen
[21:04] so you could realize amen that that what
[21:06] he did to secure
[21:09] you he basically signed the marriage
[21:14] certificate you can call it the Lamb's
[21:17] Book of Life whatever you want to but he
[21:19] placed your name in the Lamb's Book of
[21:21] Life and understand before all of this
[21:24] took place God he's so far ahead of the
[21:27] devil is the devil is know what he's
[21:29] doing but my point is God slew the lamb
[21:32] he put your name on the Lamb's Book of
[21:35] Life he protected you that's why the
[21:38] devil could not destroy you even when
[21:40] you was in the world Amen because God
[21:43] had protected You by
[21:47] signing your name in the book before the
[21:51] foundation of the world y'all hear what
[21:53] I'm saying now in the message who is God
[21:56] because I want you to realize who he is
[21:57] because before you can understand who
[21:59] you are you got to recognize who he is
[22:02] who is
[22:03] God in that message 5815 he says who is
[22:07] God the one that stood there and mowed
[22:10] the Stars off of his hands and roll
[22:12] worlds out of his hands and made the
[22:15] thing which do not appear appear deity
[22:19] and deity himself lives in
[22:22] man the Creator that made Heaven and
[22:26] Earth lives
[22:30] in mankind amen you know because I'm so
[22:32] tired of people taking the Holy Ghost as
[22:34] a thing I got to get this thing it is
[22:36] not a
[22:38] thingu it is a person it is God himself
[22:43] it is not a toy like a tamarine I got to
[22:46] have a tamarine amen no sir it is God
[22:49] living in
[22:54] you that message Kidman redeeming he
[22:57] said we're living in America that's true
[23:00] and that's the body part but the soul
[23:03] that conducts us our character is from
[23:07] above amen we live from above because
[23:10] we're born from above oh oh wait a
[23:13] minute you mean to tell me I'm living
[23:15] from above my my if I could say it like
[23:18] this my umbilical cord is still
[23:20] connected to
[23:23] heaven now I I'm trying to tell us
[23:26] something because once you realize who
[23:28] you are brother said we become of an
[23:30] invincible Army and I look around and I
[23:32] find out that is the thing that we're
[23:35] not dwelling on bringing the people into
[23:39] mind on who they are amen come on
[23:42] somebody amen amen you may have been
[23:43] stricken with amnesia but God is trying
[23:46] to say wake up oh Zion dust yourself
[23:49] from the earth Shake Yourself amen this
[23:52] is not a coincidence this is what God is
[23:54] doing for us and right now the devil is
[23:56] shaking in his shoes am because he knows
[23:59] once the Bride come to recognize who she
[24:01] is he's in big trouble he'll be so glad
[24:05] when we get out of his Eden he won't
[24:07] know what to
[24:10] do but what he don't understand I'll be
[24:13] glad
[24:14] too when I get out of his
[24:17] Eden his Eden anyway let's move on amen
[24:22] he said all Christians come from above
[24:26] Jesus said I'm not from below I'm from
[24:30] above if I was from below my subject
[24:33] would fight for me but my kingdom is of
[24:37] above and I thought that's why he said
[24:38] put it up
[24:40] Peter put it up put the sword up I'm not
[24:43] of this world this is not the way I
[24:47] fight but my kingdom is of above and so
[24:52] every man that's born of the kingdom of
[24:54] God he's from above amen
[24:59] that's more than words people if you
[25:02] don't understand and say God give it to
[25:04] me give me a revelation of what this
[25:07] really mean when it comes to
[25:13] me now we realize amen that when Adam
[25:17] and Eve were naked they were in that
[25:21] dispensation of what man call innocence
[25:23] you know he was unfallen uh you know
[25:27] didn't know wickedness didn't no evil
[25:29] and these kind of things but you see in
[25:31] order to be
[25:34] God as God is you must know good and
[25:40] evil you see we know that God knew good
[25:45] and evil it wasn't that when Adam then
[25:48] fa God said oh my goodness that's what
[25:51] evil is
[25:52] about God knew exactly what evil was and
[25:57] in order for ad to be just like God he
[26:01] had to come this
[26:04] way he had to come this way it wasn't
[26:07] that God was going to make
[26:11] him but he had to make a
[26:14] choice and God put that choice right
[26:18] there with someone he loved the
[26:22] most right if I don't go that way I lose
[26:25] her then I will always be lonely
[26:30] so therefore I must go this way and you
[26:33] know that's why I said the other night
[26:34] that's why when Adam said Lord this
[26:36] woman you gave
[26:38] me in other words Adam was you know
[26:40] people thought he was being sassy but no
[26:42] Adam was saying I know you
[26:45] know you know the whole thing amen it
[26:48] was this woman because up until then
[26:50] everything was perfect amen so for
[26:53] whatever reason you put her there to
[26:55] bring me here Lord amen
[27:01] right he had no other
[27:04] choice you you understand what I'm
[27:07] saying there was a choice but her the
[27:10] way she was
[27:11] designed she was going to go that
[27:15] way y'all understand what I'm saying it
[27:17] wasn't like oh my goodness I don't know
[27:19] what eveve is going to do y'all want to
[27:20] bet on it no it was nothing like that he
[27:24] knew exactly what was going to happen
[27:29] God wasn't
[27:31] ignorant God doesn't roll dice and play
[27:34] play those kind of tricks God knows he
[27:37] knows the end from the
[27:39] beginning is that all right with y'all
[27:42] so I look at this thing and I say here
[27:43] he was he was first created in the image
[27:46] of God is that right and God is a spirit
[27:49] so God created Adam that way right in
[27:51] such a such a way of himself and as I
[27:53] said he formed him from the dust of the
[27:55] earth and one of the things that I
[27:57] really like was
[27:59] he took the dust he breathed into Atom
[28:02] Man became a living Soul
[28:05] now I want you to understand
[28:08] this and you've heard me quote this
[28:11] before but why want you to realize when
[28:13] you
[28:15] receive the Holy Ghost now watch what
[28:17] brother bam said he says okay you break
[28:19] justification sanctification baptism of
[28:21] the Holy Ghost he said that baptism of
[28:23] the Holy Ghost is just a renovation
[28:25] basically what it is is there to burn
[28:26] out all of the drought and the the dirt
[28:28] and the dust and everything else out of
[28:29] you the Holy Ghost is just setting up a
[28:32] throne room the a proper room setting it
[28:35] up for him the person
[28:37] himself right so you got to realize all
[28:40] right okay now I that's why Paul and I'm
[28:45] jumping a little bit Paul I'm trying to
[28:47] take my time because I really want you
[28:49] to see what I'm trying to get over this
[28:52] thing that we have heard and thought and
[28:55] many times embraced that the Holy Ghost
[28:59] was some
[29:00] sensation and don't get me wrong I love
[29:02] my shouting I love my dancing I love my
[29:05] worship but that is not the Holy
[29:08] Ghost even though the Holy Ghost when it
[29:12] comes right because you heard me say
[29:14] this so many times when the Holy Ghost
[29:17] really comes into your soul there is a
[29:19] faith Revelation there's not a feeling
[29:22] but there's a revelation of it and when
[29:24] that Revelation strike you it's like a
[29:27] well coming out
[29:28] [Music]
[29:31] right amen it brings up a re it brings
[29:34] up a sensation because it passes through
[29:37] your spirit where your emotions are
[29:39] you're going to either cry you're going
[29:41] to do something Amen to thank God
[29:43] because now you know you got it right oh
[29:47] you know you got it now and when that
[29:50] happens amen oh there's no way to
[29:53] explain it so so what happens is brother
[29:57] Bram comes along now I told you this I
[29:59] told you this before Pentecostal could
[30:01] not take you there none of the ages
[30:04] could take you where this message is
[30:06] taking us amen hello somebody this
[30:09] message could this Luther could take you
[30:11] to justification Wesley Amen to
[30:13] sanctification and and and and realize
[30:16] sanctification still holds amen amen and
[30:19] the Pentecostals amen could give you the
[30:21] baptism uh the Holy Ghost of with the
[30:23] gifts but they could not bring the
[30:25] person why because they could could not
[30:28] recognize the person when the person
[30:31] knocked on the L to see an age they shut
[30:33] him out they thought it was William
[30:35] Brandon but they failed to see God IM
[30:38] morphe God veiling himself in human
[30:42] flesh and when he knocked on their doors
[30:45] trying to get in they were out there
[30:47] like vasty having their own revivals and
[30:50] they did not want to come to appear
[30:52] before the King right so what God did he
[30:56] put them away
[30:58] right and now he sought a non nameer
[31:03] amen he sought a bride amen that didn't
[31:07] have no
[31:08] reputation she wasn't a Baptist she
[31:10] wasn't a Methodist she wasn't a
[31:11] Pentecostal she wasn't none of
[31:15] that she comes along and she finds
[31:21] the the man who knows more about the
[31:25] king than anybody else in the past
[31:30] D and she says I want to know what he
[31:33] likes see the bride she want to do what
[31:36] he wants her to do you know she she's
[31:38] not refuting anything that he said she's
[31:40] literally saying I want to do everything
[31:43] he wants me to do
[31:45] amen sanctify myself whatever it takes
[31:49] is what I want because that's what I
[31:51] want to do is please the king you know
[31:54] what I heard there in in in in um Jesus
[31:56] with dirty feet brother Bon was
[31:59] basically saying if you don't kiss the
[32:01] son he would be angry you know that's a
[32:03] scripture he said how do you kiss the
[32:05] son he talks about kissing the son he
[32:07] said by
[32:09] worshiping that's how you kiss the son
[32:11] by worshiping he said because if you
[32:14] don't worship him he'll get
[32:19] angry come on somebody it's the truth
[32:22] it's the truth he even took it to a
[32:24] place he said that man who told that
[32:26] listen Simon want you at his house he
[32:29] said here was this this slave or worker
[32:31] that came right up to Jesus he was so
[32:34] excited about doing what Simon wanted
[32:37] him to do he failed to worship Jesus he
[32:40] said the worst mistake he ever made in
[32:42] his life he said and that same incident
[32:45] would judge him he came right in the
[32:48] face of Jesus and he said that's what
[32:50] people do they come right in the face of
[32:52] Jesus they come right in the church
[32:54] services knowing it's God here amen and
[32:57] they fail to worship Him He said God
[33:01] will judge you for
[33:07] that is that all
[33:10] right the thing that I love about it is
[33:12] that when one man was when Adam if I
[33:15] could say it was
[33:16] plural he was male and
[33:19] female right but God called him
[33:22] one is that right so we realize by the
[33:25] grace of God the mystery is this
[33:28] you came from God this is a this got to
[33:32] be a revelation otherwise you'll miss
[33:34] the whole
[33:35] thing you came from God and you go back
[33:39] to him
[33:41] amen right now I want you to understand
[33:44] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the world
[33:46] knows nothing about it they think they
[33:48] know it they think they got it and you
[33:51] don't have it unless the word brings it
[33:53] to
[33:54] you Hallelujah you'll never be able to
[33:57] get it unless you came from God Amen not
[34:01] in this sense right because Adam and Eve
[34:05] if you could say it like this were
[34:09] soulmates huh yeah they were soulmates
[34:13] and this is the way uh uh uh let's put
[34:17] it this way and and you know a lot of
[34:19] time people don't understand this but
[34:21] brother Bram said it in so many simple
[34:22] ways he said if you had a a laundry
[34:25] ticket and he said you took your clothes
[34:27] close to the laundry and I'm not going
[34:28] to tear this sheep cuz I need it but he
[34:30] said you know you he said what happened
[34:32] he said that laundry man he tears that
[34:35] ticket in
[34:38] hand the problem of God was trying to
[34:40] tell you something folk that God told
[34:43] Adam in
[34:45] half that's the only way you can be join
[34:49] airs hallelujah amen equal parts come on
[34:52] somebody amen so what God comes along
[34:55] through a prophet and he uses a simple
[34:58] thing to show you that it have to be the
[35:00] other half of
[35:06] godu somebody I know you feel like
[35:08] shouting but I'm just trying to tell you
[35:11] amen the prophet did it in such a simple
[35:13] way he said he said and then therefore
[35:15] he said when you came to reclaim you
[35:17] claim to claim your laundry he said the
[35:19] ticket had to
[35:22] match right oh Lord and see what he was
[35:26] saying there was nobody outside side of
[35:28] Eve that could match Adam even in her
[35:30] Fallen
[35:35] state so here it is a part that I didn't
[35:38] preach but we find
[35:41] out I'mma read your quote you like this
[35:45] from Israel and the church number one
[35:48] 533 25 I don't do that but I want you to
[35:51] remember that one now here he comes torn
[35:56] Riven tore to to Pieces his soul went to
[36:00] God God blessed him and then his soul
[36:04] returned back in the form of the baptism
[36:07] of the Holy
[36:08] ghosten Hallelujah Glory I know I read
[36:13] it but I'm going read it again his soul
[36:17] returned back in the form of the baptism
[36:20] of the holy
[36:22] ghost that comes into every believer to
[36:26] sanctify clean up mind clean up the
[36:29] heart leave a portion of the Holy Ghost
[36:32] in there here and there and where the
[36:34] Holy Ghost is given out that same holy
[36:38] spirit that brought the body of Jesus
[36:40] out of the Grave will Rapture
[36:43] amen the Covenant has to dovetail there
[36:46] it is as he uh uh tore there and gave
[36:51] the body went back to God and the Spirit
[36:53] came back to the earth when your spirit
[36:56] have to be the same kind of
[37:01] spirit now I'm just holding my feet they
[37:03] want to they really want to dance
[37:05] hallelujah amen because your spirit and
[37:08] a lot of us don't realize it brother
[37:10] brandom said it he said the
[37:13] nature right the nature of your spirit
[37:16] is the
[37:17] soul or the nature of your soul is your
[37:19] spirit oh Lord how you want to put it so
[37:22] you realize why is important to
[37:26] die God doesn't live in a
[37:30] duplex and the only way that he can
[37:33] ever fully manifest himself you must die
[37:39] brother said not just die but Rock in
[37:42] other words there must never be another
[37:43] a possibility you of ever res res that
[37:46] part of you ever resurrecting
[37:49] Hallelujah because he said when when you
[37:51] die God then comes
[37:54] in and lives the life now now how are
[37:58] you going to die if you're not willing
[38:00] to
[38:01] surrender one of the things that death
[38:04] requires and that is that you give up
[38:07] the
[38:08] ghost
[38:10] amen You' got to surrender before death
[38:14] can fully take control y'all hear what
[38:16] I'm saying and so many times I I've not
[38:18] seen uh that people take that last
[38:21] breath but usually they
[38:24] go as if they're breathing it out
[38:27] see when you get the Holy Ghost is
[38:29] breathe
[38:30] in but as if they breathing it out they
[38:33] solely giving it up and this is where
[38:36] God is saying and I'm telling you how
[38:38] you do it I'm trying to tell you how you
[38:39] do it okay so what happen is you come to
[38:43] a place and I'm going tell you whether
[38:44] it's in your home in your car in your
[38:46] closet in the room wherever you may be
[38:48] you've got to come and I'm telling you
[38:51] just is the way it's done name it name
[38:54] it you've got to let the Holy Ghost take
[38:56] you down every every memory length
[38:58] whatever and you got to say Lord I
[39:00] Surrender and when God
[39:04] hallelujah when God points out to you
[39:07] things that you got to correct you have
[39:09] to say amen I make it right and he don't
[39:12] know whether you're telling the truth or
[39:13] a lie you've got to give it all up and
[39:17] when it comes to the part that you can't
[39:19] give up you say now God help
[39:23] me huh I want to die and I'm not going
[39:26] to leave this position position until
[39:28] everything is clean surrendered and
[39:30] given to you and why because I believe
[39:34] I'm bride amen hallelujah amen that's
[39:37] how you have to approach him I believe
[39:39] I'm bride everything you say in this
[39:41] word is pertaining to me and so
[39:44] therefore I'm here for you to clean me
[39:47] up Hallelujah I'm here for you to fix it
[39:51] because by faith I've kneeled here by
[39:53] faith I've come here by faith and I'm
[39:55] not leaving until I can see Faith made
[39:59] plain amen see what I'm saying and I
[40:02] can't tell you all I can tell you is
[40:04] that if you don't not desperate God can
[40:06] give you that if you ask for
[40:09] it my point is this amen nothing comes
[40:12] easy and when you come before God it's
[40:15] going to be a
[40:17] sacrifice hello somebody now I'm going
[40:19] to tell you something that you may never
[40:21] thought about it do you believe you
[40:23] really think Simon Serene was waiting
[40:25] there said oh my God I got an opport
[40:27] opportunity to help
[40:29] him he didn't even know that in the mind
[40:32] of God that was his
[40:35] role but I guarantee you once he saw the
[40:38] face of Jesus something changed all of a
[40:42] sudden he recognized that's my position
[40:44] and this is what I'm supposed to do
[40:46] Hallelujah I don't think he went went
[40:49] away complaining oh no I believe
[40:51] salvation was given to Simon Serene
[40:53] right there Hallelujah sometime God has
[40:56] to force the issue you force you to get
[40:58] you in the position that you're supposed
[41:00] to be in but once you there you
[41:03] recognize this is where I
[41:11] belong I'm just trying to get us to we
[41:13] we can have life and no more struggle
[41:15] struggling to live struggling to live
[41:18] it's good that you got struggle cuz that
[41:20] means you got some life but understand
[41:22] God when God gives you like brother say
[41:24] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is just
[41:26] the beginning of this thing
[41:29] amen I'm coming folks just the beginning
[41:33] right because understand according to
[41:35] Revelation Jesus Christ I think 3:14 he
[41:38] is the beginning of God's creation and
[41:41] if God didn't spare him how he going to
[41:43] spare
[41:44] you you were there so it's not that I
[41:47] can't do it I can do it because in him I
[41:51] did
[41:52] it I can't pray all night he prayed all
[41:55] night
[41:58] I don't know how to pray in desperation
[41:59] he prayed in desperation why because he
[42:02] recognized the
[42:04] hour he recognized the hour and the more
[42:06] he thought about the hour coming the
[42:08] more he thought about I got to get I got
[42:10] to get this I got to get this dead just
[42:12] got to die right I I got to die to this
[42:15] because there's a part of him saying
[42:17] Lord I don't want to do this I know it's
[42:18] written in the word but I don't want to
[42:20] I don't want to do this did y'all know
[42:23] that there was a human element in Christ
[42:26] that he did not want take
[42:28] Calvary father I would that this cup
[42:30] passed from me why cuz this man saw the
[42:33] pain he knew the agony and no doubt when
[42:35] he walked around Jerusalem and all of
[42:37] these other places he seen people on the
[42:41] cross that wasn't a beautiful
[42:45] situation but one thing for sure I love
[42:48] it he didn't run but he knew he needed
[42:52] help you don't run from this you don't
[42:55] say Lord I can't do this message can't
[42:57] live you don't run from it you face it
[43:00] and you go to you go to your your your
[43:02] Garden of Gethsemane you cry there until
[43:04] God come down if he's got to dispatch
[43:06] your angel he'll do it amen but you stay
[43:09] there until you can come up and say I'm
[43:11] ready I'm fully surrendered to God and
[43:14] I'm ready to do whatever he wants me to
[43:16] do let's go back to where we come from
[43:19] amen I'm tired of this world aren't you
[43:21] and the only reason why this world still
[43:23] rolling around the Sun like it is is
[43:25] because the bride has not completely
[43:27] made herself ready amen made herself
[43:33] ready right he says the Covenant has the
[43:36] dub Tail as the tore as as he tore tore
[43:39] there and gave the body and gave the
[43:42] body went back to God and the Spirit
[43:44] came back to the Earth then your spirit

[43:49] it'll miss that place going
[43:52] there if you don't listen listen please
[43:56] people of God listen if you don't have
[43:59] these virtues in you if they're not
[44:02] there brother Bram is now saying you
[44:05] going to miss
[44:06] it yes sir not because of your make
[44:10] yourself but because something the love
[44:13] of God has swept into your soul and tore
[44:17] every Earthly Idol

[44:27] Holy Ghost working in you

[44:36] are the Workman turn with me to
[44:37] Ephesians 2:10 and I hope this is okay I
[44:40] want you to realize people of God we
[44:42] will not give that bad report I don't
[44:45] care if it's just it wasn't just but two
[44:47] of them I don't care if it's two or
[44:48] three or four of us we will not give the
[44:51] bad they're going to come a bride out of
[44:53] here that's going to make a translation
[44:57] I refuse I don't care about the Giants
[45:00] in the land I don't care if we don't
[45:01] have music go if there ever never come a
[45:04] musician or anything else listen my goal
[45:07] my goal right now is to be what God Amen
[45:12] Hallelujah on Earth on Earth on Earth
[45:16] bearing the same signs the same wonder
[45:19] the same character the same every let
[45:22] everything perish around me nothing
[45:25] should matter to you more than anything
[45:27] thing more there shouldn't be anything
[45:30] in your way outside of the goal amen
[45:33] Paul said I press toward that Mark the
[45:36] goal whatever suffering i' have to have
[45:38] I'm still looking
[45:43] straight you can't accomplish it
[45:45] yourself but yourself but you know who
[45:47] the man
[45:48] is right look what he says in he turn
[45:51] stated at Ephesians 2:10 but he says in
[45:54] in this question and answer he said Adam
[45:57] was lonesome and God to show that they
[45:59] could not be separated remember I said
[46:01] that now I'm going to get back into the
[46:03] same thing just a second look he never
[46:05] went and got a dirt and made a Eve but
[46:09] he made from the original dirt Adam he
[46:11] took a rib from his side and made him a
[46:14] helpmate and that was Eve so she was
[46:18] made for the man and part of the man she
[46:21] was part of him in the beginning in the
[46:24] creation in what the the
[46:28] she was part of him down here in this
[46:31] creation she could not be divided in
[46:34] another creation she had to be made in
[46:36] the same
[46:38] creation see cuz if she he had done it
[46:41] from another creation we would have
[46:43] never known she really came from Adam
[46:45] and we would have never known the bride
[46:47] really came from God Amen y'all hear
[46:49] what I'm saying so she had he had to
[46:52] divide put them together then separate
[46:54] them and brought them back together amen
[47:02] amen ain't God good listen Ephesians
[47:06] 2:10 says for we are his workmanship
[47:09] created in Christ Jesus unto good works

[48:48] hey that's what Paul said who can resist
[48:51] this counseling hey who can say to the
[48:53] part why did you form me to be this or

[49:00] thing I want you to understand that
[49:01] there are people who have been born from
[49:06] beneath y'all y'all better recognize
[49:08] this they are demons and not more so now
[49:12] that are being birthed on the
[49:15] earth y'all must not know what I'm
[49:17] talking about but brother vom said
[49:19] because of the Fall God allowed a
[49:21] worldly Spirit to come into us and
[49:24] whether you realize it or not the the
[49:26] only thing that protected you from that
[49:28] worldly spirit is the thing that was in
[49:30] your
[49:31] soul hello somebody cuz all of us was
[49:34] born with
[49:36] demons we did not have no desire to
[49:39] serve God you mean that little cute
[49:42] little in thing
[49:46] yep yep that little thing amen because
[49:49] if it was that kind of spirit in heaven
[49:52] God wouldn't have to give you according
[49:53] to Ezekiel a new spirit
[49:58] so whether you believe it or not as cute
[49:59] as they may be they little demons in

[50:13] change all of
[50:16] that yes

[50:20] truth and whether you believe it or not
[50:23] Judas was born a demon
[50:26] and the the the the right now you better
[50:29] believe it there are more demons being
[50:31] born if you want to say it like that

[50:34] the world calling their little babies
[50:36] little demons you ever heard them man
[50:38] they little demons come on here little
[50:39] demons I heard them I've heard it
[50:42] calling their babies demons they're not
[50:44] out of the
[50:49] scripture born from beneath that's why
[50:52] they love the things of hell oh come on
[50:56] Amen that's why you love the things of
[50:58] God CU you're from above and they love
[51:01] the things of hell because of where they
[51:02] come from oh come on
[51:05] somebody y'all I tell you what it it is
[51:08] what it
[51:09] is now turn with me to Second Peter

[51:15] Lord oh people of God we've got to
[51:18] return and and and I'm getting ready to
[51:20] get there in just a minute cuz I want to

[51:24] laying before us and laying before us
[51:25] and we've preached on it and preached on
[51:27] it and we preached on it and and um
[51:30] we've got to recognize by the grace of
[51:32] God that God is trying to tell us
[51:34] something if you don't have
[51:38] this you're going to miss
[51:42] it I had to tie my
[51:48] shoe amen so second Peter 1 right second
[51:54] Peter 1 there's no way I can go through
[51:56] all of this but I'm going to go through
[51:58] it as much as possible I want you to go
[51:59] and study it out and says God you should
[52:02] well your best way of studying it is go
[52:03] home and listen to the Statue of a
[52:05] perfect man now it can't get no planer
[52:08] the world doesn't have this message on
[52:11] the Statue of a perfect
[52:13] man you say I want to be perfect here it
[52:18] is before you can really see the move of
[52:22] adoption in your
[52:25] life here it is is everybody teach it in
[52:28] a different way I'm just going to tell
[52:30] you right now if you haven't gotten to
[52:31] the place where Jesus have said hear ye
[52:34] him you still got some more
[52:39] climbing second Peter
[52:42] 1
[52:44] 2-10 Grace and peace be multiplied unto
[52:47] you through the knowledge of our God and
[52:51] of Jesus our lord now
[52:54] remember the nature of the spirit is the
[52:57] soul or the soul or nature of the soul
[52:59] is the spirit however however you want
[53:00] to put it but it has a
[53:02] nature and here God is saying this is
[53:06] what's in my
[53:10] soul shouting John I'm telling you he
[53:13] said I'm going to lay it there in the
[53:14] scriptures and I the bride will catch it
[53:16] now everybody else will look over and
[53:19] they think this is why brother B said it
[53:21] he said Scientology can do this he said
[53:24] those the people you can you can produce
[53:27] these things without the Holy Ghost one
[53:30] thing you can't mimic is divine n love
[53:32] divine love you can't you can't but all
[53:34] these other things he said you can do it
[53:36] mind over matter longsuffering and all
[53:39] of these things mind over matter he said
[53:41] but when it's real when it's a genuine
[53:44] liying Satan can't go
[53:48] there right he said Grace and peace be
[53:51] what multiplied unto you multiplied
[53:53] multiplied unto you through the
[53:55] knowledge of our God and of Jesus our
[53:57] lord according as his divine power has
[54:01] given unto us all things
[54:04] all he didn't leave nothing away from
[54:07] his bride he gave her everything
[54:09] pertaining to himself H so that she
[54:12] might know the path she's
[54:16] taking that pertaining unto life and
[54:19] godliness through the knowledge of him
[54:22] that have called us to glory and virtue
[54:25] and let me hold up let me stand it right
[54:27] here cuz you know if you read and you
[54:29] listen to the statute of a perfect man
[54:31] brother bam talks about the baptism of
[54:32] the Holy Ghost he said that's the
[54:33] beginning he said and then you add on to
[54:35] this and add on to this and add on to
[54:36] this you've got to listen to that tape
[54:38] really well thoroughly because I used to
[54:40] listen to that thing in
[54:42] faint faint in my spirit cuz every time
[54:45] I get to a certain level I would
[54:48] fall why because it was human
[54:51] effort I was trying to do it I was
[54:55] trying to make this thing happen and God
[54:58] show me that's not the nature of a
[55:00] seed
[55:03] Hallelujah the nature of the seed is
[55:06] that if you water it you give it
[55:10] sunlight it will produce itself yes and
[55:14] once the baptism has quickened that seed
[55:17] by the grace of God all you got to do
[55:19] like brother randam said is lay in the
[55:20] presence of the son you stay there in
[55:23] the word you stay there in the word you
[55:26] come to church how do you water the
[55:28] camel you shout oh y'all don't know what
[55:30] I'm talking about brother brand you
[55:32] worship God that's what he said he said
[55:35] the same two half camel that brought re
[55:38] took took the gifts to Rebecca was the
[55:40] same two half camel she wrote taking her
[55:42] back to Isaac he said that was worship
[55:45] amen you got to water the camel he said
[55:48] watering the camel is
[55:50] worship right in other words you water
[55:52] the word you worship what the word amen
[55:56] that's what people don't understand when
[55:58] the word of God is coming and you say
[56:00] Amen praise God you worshiping the word
[56:04] and at that sign at same time as you
[56:05] saying amen and you worshiping that seed
[56:08] is growing woo you might not see it but
[56:12] it's forming itself into the very image
[56:15] of
[56:15] God Amen and when you don't worship he
[56:19] said he get angry with you kiss the
[56:24] son now we're not talking about music
[56:27] now we're talking about the
[56:29] word when you worship the word
[56:34] amen it's powerful because that ain't
[56:37] all it either I want you to understand
[56:39] worshipping is part of it I want you to
[56:41] understand when Jesus was going into the
[56:43] the city they were worshiping him man
[56:45] hosana hosana blessed is he that cometh
[56:48] in the name of the Lord but when the
[56:50] word started bring forth the bitter when
[56:53] the word start amen bringing it I'm
[56:55] whipping you today because you up in my
[56:57] temple when that came they backed off
[57:00] you hear what I'm saying the the make
[57:02] Believers the people who thought they
[57:04] believ because they did not have that
[57:07] life in them they didn't have a root
[57:10] when they came down to the real thing
[57:12] they backed up like who are this and
[57:14] those some of those same people
[57:15] screaming out
[57:20] crucifying so when the bitter comes you
[57:22] got to take it bitter and sweet you got
[57:25] to eat G and all of that nothing should
[57:28] be left and that's the point it always
[57:30] go against your
[57:33] grain God designed it that
[57:38] way
[57:41] Hallelujah if you ever ran track or
[57:44] anything like that you get tired and
[57:46] then the coach says one more
[57:49] lap and you think to yourself can't you
[57:51] see I'm almost dead one more lap I'm
[57:54] going to die and it's going to be your
[57:57] but you know what people but somehow you
[58:00] muster up enough strength and take
[58:02] another lap then you realize the coach
[58:05] was right you could do it see what I'm
[58:07] saying and my point is when it comes to
[58:09] God he's saying you might feel like you
[58:11] on the edge of it all and you might not
[58:13] take another move he said but I'm
[58:15] requiring one more move
[58:17] amen where we are today is that the
[58:20] world has got us all messed up if we we
[58:23] look at you know it's like Peter walking
[58:25] on the water come on somebody when you
[58:27] start looking at everything you
[58:30] can't yeah so when you can't focus what
[58:33] happen you begin to sing this is a time
[58:35] to
[58:37] focus you got to focus now refocus and
[58:41] don't leave out of here saying Lord
[58:43] Focus me put me in a position where I
[58:46] can look at this thing if I got to read
[58:48] these scriptures every day and pray over
[58:50] this every day for all of this to be me
[58:53] that's what I
[58:54] want because this is
[58:59] me listen whereby are given unto us
[59:02] exceedingly great and I won't have to
[59:03] worry about clicks and clicks and clicks
[59:05] and all that kind of stuff all of that
[59:07] will dissipate everything will move out
[59:08] of the way amen because once this love
[59:10] divine get in your heart you'll start
[59:12] caring about
[59:14] everybody right the reason why we don't
[59:16] see it because it ain't there hello it
[59:20] is that's the truth of it but when God
[59:23] began to move move you got to have a
[59:25] prayer too don't think you go all of
[59:27] this going to come without prayer you
[59:30] have not because you ask
[59:32] not huh come on
[59:34] somebody that's why the Bible said we
[59:36] can't even take the word of God and
[59:37] strive because that's a man-made thing
[59:39] you're trying to tie somebody up in
[59:42] knots you can't do that you got to be
[59:45] meek with
[59:46] everything right so listen amen un life
[59:50] godliness and uh let's let's just
[59:53] according as his what divine power has
[59:56] has given unto us all things pertaining
[59:58] unto life godliness through the
[1:00:01] knowledge of him that have called us to
[1:00:04] glory and
[1:00:07] virtue H think about it that's why
[1:00:11] brother B said when God comes in you
[1:00:13] it's God in you God in you the hope of
[1:00:17] glory Paul says not I that live the
[1:00:20] Christ that lives in me whereby are
[1:00:23] given unto us exceedingly and great and
[1:00:27] precious that by these you might be what
[1:00:30] partaker of what the
[1:00:33] Divine can I put it this way the Divine
[1:00:39] Soul cuz that's what it
[1:00:42] is I just read where he took the soul of
[1:00:45] God ripped it out of him placed it and
[1:00:47] sent it back as a baptism of the Holy
[1:00:49] Ghost so he pleases his
[1:00:54] soul you don't think that's true that's
[1:00:56] why the Bible said if that seed remain
[1:00:58] in you you cannot sin why because the
[1:01:00] Bible said the soul that sinth shall
[1:01:04] die so he has to put something in you
[1:01:07] that will never doubt his word and the
[1:01:09] only thing that he can put in you that
[1:01:11] will never doubt his word is
[1:01:17] himself I feel
[1:01:19] like hey Lord have mercy amen having
[1:01:25] having having escaped the corruption
[1:01:28] that is in the world through what
[1:01:31] lust blessed is a man who overcometh the
[1:01:35] world what world the world that's
[1:01:39] beneath lust of the flesh lust of the
[1:01:42] eye pride of life they are not from
[1:01:46] above they are from beneath overcome
[1:01:49] this Hallelujah this is what I love I
[1:01:52] was teaching the young children on Moses
[1:01:53] and we've been having a good time but
[1:01:55] one thing I love about this and I said
[1:01:57] this other night with Moses one of the
[1:02:00] things that when when they came to the
[1:02:01] Red Sea you know uh and and and and
[1:02:05] Moses waited God God see I like this
[1:02:07] because because
[1:02:10] uh uh uh Pharaoh had a scepter and his
[1:02:14] scepter looked better than Moses scepter
[1:02:17] Moses scepter was a rod a little piece
[1:02:19] of stick amen I like Jonathan I always
[1:02:22] said told him I said he said the rod was
[1:02:25] St you know taller than Moses and I
[1:02:26] believe that because God is taller than
[1:02:28] all of us amen so what happened is he
[1:02:32] had a a scepter you know those they have
[1:02:34] a little septer I wish I had a little
[1:02:35] something to represent they little
[1:02:36] septer a little something like that you
[1:02:38] know and all it had to do is either said
[1:02:40] it like this or whatever it meant that's
[1:02:42] where if he put it a certain way that
[1:02:44] means kill
[1:02:45] him amen that little septer had power to
[1:02:48] ro man but God took a rod a almond tree
[1:02:54] woo a a dead alond
[1:02:57] tree my God and he took that dead alond
[1:03:01] tree a limb off of it I love it because
[1:03:03] to me it represented a rib of some sort
[1:03:06] you know anyway he took that thing now
[1:03:08] I'm telling you watch I don't God is
[1:03:11] it's good to me but my point is he takes
[1:03:14] this thing he looks like he's a king you
[1:03:17] got two kings two kingdoms against them
[1:03:20] each other the kingdom of pharaoh
[1:03:22] against the kingdom of God the Kingdom
[1:03:24] from beneath versus the kingdom that is
[1:03:27] from above amen and the Bible said that
[1:03:30] Moses refused to be called the pharaoh's
[1:03:34] daughter even though he had the
[1:03:35] pleasures of the world he had gold he
[1:03:38] had silver he had education he had
[1:03:40] everything else if he wanted grapes all
[1:03:43] he had to say
[1:03:44] grapes and open his mouth they just
[1:03:46] dropped them in
[1:03:50] there he had all of that he had a
[1:03:53] Jacuzzi y'all know he did and amen he
[1:03:56] had all of that and he had rather be a
[1:03:59] bomb on the
[1:04:00] street than to be Pharaoh's
[1:04:04] daughter he looked at that stuff and
[1:04:06] saids that is not of me that's not my
[1:04:10] that doesn't make me happy that's that's
[1:04:12] not I've met the almighty
[1:04:15] God and I have a purpose now watch this
[1:04:18] he I said like this because he had not
[1:04:20] met I backtracked that he had not met
[1:04:22] the almighty God yet but that was only
[1:04:25] on his teaching his mama was telling him
[1:04:27] you're a proper child you're the
[1:04:28] deliverer you're special this what
[1:04:30] happened to you at your birth God
[1:04:32] promised you he believed it so he
[1:04:35] recognized I'm not an Egyptian like you
[1:04:38] supposed to recognize I'm not a sinner
[1:04:40] amen I am not of this world I don't care
[1:04:43] how messed up I am I don't care how much
[1:04:45] sin I've done what kind of situation
[1:04:47] I've been in that's not me something
[1:04:50] need to deliver this right I'm not that
[1:04:54] it's not what I want to do I feel like a
[1:04:56] man
[1:04:57] trapped I need release Lord I need
[1:05:00] Deliverance come on somebody but the
[1:05:02] part that I like the love part of our
[1:05:04] life is that when Moses got all upset
[1:05:09] because of the people got him all upset
[1:05:10] and everything else and God says listen
[1:05:11] the power is within
[1:05:13] you right like he done met God and all
[1:05:16] this he's come back and God is saying

[1:05:22] why a lot of us don't get nothing cu the
[1:05:24] power is within you and God is waiting
[1:05:26] for you to do something instead of
[1:05:28] crying out to him speak the word and go
[1:05:31] forth he said and he takes that little
[1:05:33] stick amen he holds it out like that or
[1:05:36] however he did it the waterers backed up
[1:05:38] and listen this is what I love about it
[1:05:39] God so perfect man I tell you what I
[1:05:42] couldn't have been there because I
[1:05:43] probably would have never got cross

[1:05:56] and no muds no nothing I said he built a
[1:05:59] highway right through the Red
[1:06:01] Sea right and then he waits and he all
[1:06:06] of his people get across and I'm off my
[1:06:08] but I'm bringing it on he said he get
[1:06:10] what he gets across and then Moses

[1:06:14] him the same God that opened it up what
[1:06:17] God the God that was in there amen he
[1:06:20] caught the thought of God he performed
[1:06:23] it and at the moment that God wanted him
[1:06:25] to shut up he shuts it up all of
[1:06:27] Pharaoh's Army is drowned and what is he
