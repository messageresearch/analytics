TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen we're just going to get right into the word of God appreciate everybody who's here this evening amen it's the first time I've ever come here amen and only one sister is here we thank God for sister Aaron pressing it on sister well I'm glad we got them back from Alaska they act like they wanted to stay up there so amen amen you love the Lord amen let us turn by the grace of God to uh Psalms 40 and then acts 7 Psalm 40 and acts 7 we're just going to read Psalm 40 And1 and two I waited patiently for the Lord and He inclined unto me and heard My Cry he brought me up also out of a horrible pit out of the myy clay and set my feet upon a rock and establish my goings am let's go to the third verse that's real good all of it is good and he had put a new song in my mouth amen even praise unto our God many shall see it and fear and shall trust in the Lord amen you love the Lord amen let us go to acts s please tonight we're just going to work in a uh subject on prayer uh uh this is the hour that we're living in and I believe this year is going to require more prayer than ever I believe with all my heart that's what will cause a people to be translated the communication that they will have with God In Prayer is when they will receive secrets from God that no one else will receive you know it's amazing because a lot of time people don't know that that's where God reveals himself in the secret closet amen it is a thing that I know that is required and I really believe that is why so many people fail and come short but the Bride of Jesus Christ feel the urgency she knows amen she's got to talk with him more now than ever amen de love the Lord acts 7 and 34 acts 734 we'll read I have seen I have seen the Affliction of my people which is in Egypt and I have heard their groaning and have come down to deliver them and now come I will send uh thee into Egypt and this Moses whom they refused saying who is made thee a ruler and a judge the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the Angel which appeared to him in the bush he brought them out after that he had showed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt and in the Red Sea and in the wilderness 40 years this is that Moses which said unto the children of Israel a prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you or of your brethren like unto me here uh excuse me him shall ye hear amen let us pray father God we come before you Lord Jesus as humbly as we know how we thank you for your goodness we thank you for your grace surely Lord you've been better to us than we've been to ourselves and we pray this evening that you would break and destroy the yolks of the enemy I pray father that you would give us a heart to hear and to receive Lord not the heart and I that not the heart in our head but the heart in our hearts Lord oh God I pray right now that you would just have that perfect will here tonight though be a few Lord we know that you are here because you promised that you would be cleanse us from all unrighteousness every thought idea whatever it may be Lord wash us clean our father let there be nothing hindering us in our spirit or in our flesh Lord and we'll be careful to give you the praise Glory and Honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen you may be seated amen as I said by the grace of God I believe with all of my heart amen that this is the year of prayer if you would turn with me amen also to Psalm 27:14 amen Psalm 27:14 we we we really see the world falling apart people don't know what to do uh but the bride amen you know all of this confusion that's going on yet in the midst of it all God has a bride that is being revived a amen I believe with all of my heart amen she is coming to a place where she is totally dependent upon Jesus Christ she have denied herself and she's trusting in the almighty God who promised that he would bring her to a Perfection amen that's where I'm at that's where I am today I realize by the grace of God there's nothing that I can do I've tried tried so many times to live it Hallelujah I've tried so many times to make it happen amen but I realize amen that I can't do it the only way that it can ever happen is that I have the God who made it happen on the inside of me and he is the lifegiving source amen now here we find out in Psalm 27 which I always love this chapter because it is the rapture chapter amen amen here the the 14th verse it says wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait I say on the Lord now watch what it says in the 13th verse I had fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living and I'm going tell you what amen I could truly say last year 13 perhaps that was my my what I was had I not known and had had not seen I would have fainted now maybe y'all don't know what I'm talking about but by the grace of God Amen we all come to that point God has to give us something Amen to keep us moving by the grace of God and I don't know how difficult 203 was for you but it was very difficult for me but by the grace of God God gave me something if I had been going by my own strength I would have fainted Hallelujah come on somebody it was just that tough but God brought us through is that all right amen I tell you what I don't know why people aren out here tonight I know some can't come because of the roads and all but my the first year the first service on the first the first my goodness I thought this is pretty good but by the grace of God I want to end it the same way but y'all know what I'm saying and everybody couldn't make it don't get me wrong but it is a blessing to be in the house of the Lord amen so when you come and you look at these things and you say to yourself amen by the grace of God I am so blessed now I said this once before and I think I said this be prior to my leaving you know when uh when Jesus was feeding the disciples uh uh and he said unto them except you eat my flesh and drink my blood amen you have no life in you amen you know many times throughout the years amen the world the church World attacked this message in so many ways but now is attacking the Flesh of the message the bloody bleeding word is that right but the prophet of God said it was during that time that God slowed up the Miracles amen so that he could teach them yes amen see in other words what is happening now has been such a blessing for the True Believer because it anchored them it literally made them grip the solid rock y'all hear what I'm saying because then Jesus turned to him during the time he was teaching them eat the Flesh and drink the blood right and he said except you eat the Flesh and drink this Blood you will have no part of me is that right and then he turned to Peter after 70 turn he says will you go too Peter said no sir how can I turn amen how could I leave this amen when your words are the words to eternal life your words only you only have the words to eternal life and so that grips that bride and anchors her in and say where can I go I can't go on the B Because amen he produced chickens forgive me Lord amen amen I can't go under no other what other Ministry you know that can feed you like this one and promise you eternal life bringing you to a transformation it's not some figment of our imagination we see ourselves growing and moving from glory to glory it might be moving slowly but it's moving amen hallelujah now when we talk about an exodus and and we're working with somewhat Exodus because you've got not only to come out of Le the seia but you must go into Christ is that right so it's a spiritual spiritual thing Amen in the beginning the first Exodus was a natural to a natural then a spiritual to the Holy Ghost and from the Holy Ghost to the Eternal land is that all right so this is the Third Exodus that we're now experiencing but you must receive the Holy Ghost in order to go Eternal amen it is the only way of escape this is the only generation that have truly been promised a Rapture is that right we have been promised a translation even as Enoch Hallelujah of all ages we are the only age that can truly walk with God outside of Enoch Hallelujah because we' got the whole body the whole word amen and now we're walking with Christ little by little little by little and whether you understand it or not as you walk you are ascending amen hallelujah now look at this thing because amen he says here God is making ready to fulfill his Divine promise remember with Moses he was now making ready to fulfill his Divine promised word that he had give to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob now years amen hundreds of years had passed come on somebody 400 years had passed and yet you still had Believers looking for The Exodus is that right amen but yet God never amen forgot his promise in the season the due time God always make his promise right amen see we don't have to worry about it cuz we we didn't promise he did amen is that right but it is a time where you and I must oh I realized today amen or yesterday or whenever it was amen I thought Lord I've got to get put some more time into prayer amen you know I'm praying but I got to put more time into it amen because realize amen that that's where God is talking I was I was laying on my bed taking a nap today and this is God gave me this particular message so I hope and trust well I know those of you who are here you'll be blessed by it amen listen therefore you can rest assured that God has promised in this Bible he's going to do it just no need of trying to think anything else and say well the prophet was and maybe was wrong or that couldn't happen in this day look almost impossible then more impossible than it does now but God did it anyhow because he promised he would do it now is that right it look more listen oh I think about it we can read it we can look at the Ten Commandments and yet and still we don't know how difficult it really was can you imagine a man in Exile coming back risking his life of being immediately thrown in jail but you know what they were so powerful they said this man is insane Hallelujah they had to and Moses come with the orders of God Amen right now wh watch this because God had to take 40 years to prepare him amen 40 years to beat out all that Egypt put in him amen think about it most of us haven't even been 40 years in this message that's why amen he's got to double it up on us he's got to Beat It All Out Of Us in order for us to PR to prepare us for this Exodus one thing I love about it is because uh where I read I think I read uh acts didn't I read acts amen and he says uh God comes along he says but you see I've come down because I've heard their groanings you know what groanings mean to utter something you know when you uttering your groanings you are in pain and grief you know you're not at the at the at the uh uh kneeling in prayer and just rejoicing this is a different kind of prayer it's like giving birth to something you know you're groaning you're Mourning you you're in pain because you realize amen there's something that you need God to do oh I've got something good if y'all don't mind me reading a little bit because I'll be doing a lot of reading and you've heard me say many times that this is a time that we've got to prepare for war in time of peace I wish that was my original quote but it's not but nevertheless by the God by the grace of God you've got to prepare this is your time this is your opportunity you know the enemy is coming because we have a prophecy amen I was telling the church uh over there in Ohio I said let me tell you something if you listen to commercials and the news and things like that God will speak to you right I forgot what phone company that is talking about bundling right and you knock on the door and and and and they trying to introduce this bundling to you and you say but we don't bundle right and what happened they turned their backs on you and said well you're not welcome in this community that's what they're saying right and that's exactly what time we're living in when you tell somebody I'm not an organization denomination they turn their backs on you no we don't bundle Hallelujah come on somebody you look at this thing and brother here it was amen uh we we missed the inspiration here and I don't mean no har there's a lot of things about the president I don't like what he doing amen but he's ordained to do it that's right come on somebody he can't do no more than what he's doing even seduces must wax worse and worse Hallelujah but one thing he was inspired to say we're bringing a change Hallelujah and if you can realize that God is speaking whenever the devil says something if you listen you revert you take it back into a spiritual realm and you'll catch what he's saying amen amen right because he's averal he says the truth he tells a lie but it's the truth turned around amen so anyway a change and we realize amen okay we recognize the change the change is that we're coming fully now into a one world order Pro prophet of God called it a a dictatorship he said way back then America had come into a military dictatorship Hallelujah and we are now at the Harvest of this dictatorship right we were talking with some of the people there in Alaska they got the they got the places built already for those who will refuse to Mark already ready here in America they got ovens over there in Ohio folks the spirit of Hitler is on America and people don't see it Hallelujah but it was those wise Jews that escaped the Holocaust they saw it coming they got out of the places but those people who thought they could mingle with everything else and saved everything and of course there were some who weren't weren't monetarily able to move but those who could they did y'all hear what I'm saying but in this change you and I must recognize you can't save your life buying gold and buying this and buying that the Bible say if you don't take the mark you will not be able to buy or sell they don't care if you got gold they don't care if you got silver they don't care what you have the point is if you don't humble to the system you will be exiled from the system Hallelujah y hear what I'm saying oh come on somebody so you got to know what you know that you know that you know am amen I heard him say on the Third Exodus today he said everybody that Mr Rapture will take the mark now I don't know how that works out when it comes to the to the white Throne judgment but he said everybody that don't take the mark of God will take the mark of the beast woo Jesus have mercy Lord listen he says now I am come down to deliver them out of the land of Egypt and to bring them up out of that land into a good land see so he took them out of Egypt to bring them into a good land now why did it take 40 years for them to get there hey that's right unbelief amen and murmuring and complaining about the leadership oh Lord hey glory to God hallelujah come on somebody that's what they did and they failed to see it was God who was doing the leading it wasn't Moses that caused the the the land to dry up God LED them that way Hallelujah is that okay amen and God sent down a little bit of Mana for him amen amen and then they weren't happy with that the message is just too simple we need some deep stuff we need some meat and God gave him the meat and what did it do make him sick oh Lord have mercy did it save them no sir they ate all that meat and still died in the wilderness look at them now look at them now people don't even know how to pray no more listen he says I'm going to be with you certainly and I'll be with you my my never never failing presence will be with you wherever you go don't be afraid I'm coming down to deliver I'm sure the spiritual mind catches that so if he told them in Exodus I'm come down to deliver what do you think the mighty Angel did on in Revelations 10 amen what do you think that Mighty Angel come down to do what he put one land uh foot on the land one on the sea he come right down to do what deliver his people amen no matter where they were amen no matter where you are God come to deliver you say oh brother he come to yes he's come to deliver you and me am it doesn't matter God promised that he said he would oh my but he does it in such a simple way amen hallelujah he does it in such a simple way the people don't even recognize what is he doing now he had done all those Miracles all those exploits there in Egypt but there was one thing the Egyptian missed if they could have stopped the people from putting the blood on the door Post in the little they would have wck Israel they would have gotten it Hallelujah they would have all died if they had understood the importance of the blood W glory to God but they couldn't see the importance of that Lamb's blood but Israel knew the importance of the Lamb's blood the bride know the importance of the Lamb's blood and she will place it on the doorpost of her heart she doesn't care because she realized that the Death Angel is coming see they think they got it but you see you got to have a lamb without sprinkling we got to have a lamb without spot and you look at the denominations come on somebody the organization look at the lamb oh help us Lord help us Lord help us Lord that was the victory that was the overcoming right amen the death angel cannot stop you if you have the blood on on your heart which is the life of God now it ain't just a chemical it is the life Hallelujah right there on the altar of your heart no matter how many times you fall short the death angel got to pass over you he cannot destroy you he cannot kill you and though you might be worthy the only thing that was different between the Egyptians and the and the children of is Israel was the blood that stood between the two amen they were just as bad as they had ever been behind that blood hello come on somebody amen but it was the Lamb's blood that God was looking at right now it's still the Lamb's blood but it's the true Lamb of God Amen that's protecting us by the grace of God groaning coming to a place and my subject was they were praying you see because they had been there a long time and there was those old saintly people amen who are now praying still Lord send us the deliverer where is the deliverer Lord send us deliverer and see why they were still praying they failed to see that the deliverer was already on the scene Hallelujah and a lot of people says oh my God I want to see the Rapture and what they fail to see the Rapture been moving for a long time now and almost at the end of this thing amen it's been changing us from glory to glory hallelujah hallelujah come on somebody amen I like this he been slowly cooking us amen hallelujah oh my slow process amen but yet and still the fire is still there amen you love the Lord oh listen he talks about it amen in the third exod again and I hope you don't mind he goes on and say he God give us Pentecost he did and he give us a book of Acts he give us the Holy Spirit to lead us and guide us he give us a land and why are we out of it well why is the church out of it why is it the great Christian Church today living again like the book of Acts bringing forth the same thing there's some reasons for it we know that we broke up and we're in a terrible condition and the most terrible condition that the Christianity has ever lived in is today and we're on right on the brink or on the brink of a great terrific judgment laying for the church and before his judgment can happen God's calling an exodus just like he did then the amorites sins were heaped up so he's calling a SP spiritual Exodus now is that all right amen and let me tell you something it's heaped up it's heaped up amen you got to realize by the grace of God Amen you think to yourself can this country or can this nation ever go any further yes and it will by the grace of God but oh my the full Judgment of God will strike them amen when they come after his bride you don't trust you don't touch my people now is that right you don't touch my people amen amen and that's what the world don't understand they hate us now and that thing is Mo the momentum of that thing is really going stronger and stronger and stronger and I'm going tell you something even organizations and denominationalism they hate a True Believer you know what they say you don't have to do all that that ain't all necessary that's the that's for the Old Testament when God called you to dress a certain way or act a certain way God don't require for us to do that now but that's what they told me and I believed him for a season Hallelujah but something on the inside wouldn't let me rest I knew amen that somehow God was uh calling me to a higher calling so are you sometime we don't even know what to pray for is that right amen but Jesus said in Luke 21:36 watch ye therefore and pray always that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all things that shall come come to pass and to stand before the son of man pray he didn't say said it for jur pray amen is that right pray God give me Grace God be merciful to me amen account me worthy Lord to escape these things come on cuz I'm going tell you something it'll never be your human effort it will all be it'll all be God's judgment according to what's on your heart amen oh help me Jesus help me Lord Romans 8:26 says likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered have you ever been there that's when you know you're praying hallelujah amen all of a sudden the spirit of God just takes over and just groan you think Lord what's go he just groaning he's making words that you don't know nothing about he's telling God things amen that he don't want nobody else to hear hallelujah hallelujah I'm telling you you talking about a good prayer when you can all you can do is say oh grown just grown just grown amen is that all right what am I saying brother Brooks I'm people of God I'm saying this God ain't looking for light prayer you know we we say say so many light prayers and we think we prayed many times we've just amen uttered words and there was no there was no death to it there was no real feeling or you know when you're talking with somebody God God is a god of feeling right he he wants some depth to it amen and when you can get into the Holy Spirit listen let me tell you something when Jesus Christ went to the Garden of Gethsemane he didn't say a like prayer he knew his judgment his trials was coming this this thing that was going to come upon him and he knew it wasn't going to like prayer wasn't going to do it amen hello you hear what I'm saying he prayed amen he come back three times can can't can't you pray with me one hour the Bible said he prayed the himly that mean he was boiling red heart amen excruciating uh prayer prayer that brought in pain and sweat the Bible said it was so it was so of the drops of sweat was like drops of blood amen so you got to realize amen it wasn't it wasn't no like it was a prayer of desperation that he himself had to move his will out of the way and let me tell you something something isn't that like us often time we get down to pray and we get back up and our will is still living it's when you got to get back down until something comes and touch you the Bible said an angel came and strengthened him but you got to have something something got to come forth amen listen that's why the Bible said in 1 Thessalonians 5:17 pray without ceasing that means no intermission Hallelujah the more I can think about prayer the more I'm going to pray second Thessalonians says wherefore we pray always for you that I Our God will count you worthy of the calling and fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodness and the work of Faith with power so now we we're working this thing we going to pray that each and every one of us that God will lead us and direct us into his will amen and so therefore amen that we can be assured of our calling and not only that our calling will be packed with power see that's what he's that's what we ought to be praying for each other that God will just assure us of our ministry assure us of our calling assure us of our walk amen and the only way that we can come be assured is by prayer God is the only one can tell you amen preacher can't tell you he can only preach what God Said preach amen but you need a personal re Revelation and that's when God comes to you and directly amen deliver the mail is that all right amen listen let's move on Amen The Hours come he said all right all night long I've been watching them brother his eyes and you know what's happening here talking about the three Hebrew boys but I've got to read this the he three Hebrew boys I know he's watching me he's always watching you he's seeing how much Faith you got how much you got how much you've got he wants to see what kind of a stand that you'll take the Hours come now what are you going to do he said I'm watching them all night long I heard every prayer they prayed you angels has been good Angels but I can't let you go for I'm going myself amen I can

thunder thunder head out Y where it at I can see him roll up into the Strone step over up there and oh my reach up and get a hold of a zigzag lightning pass by the tree of life and pack off a pine what's the matter I'm going to Babylon this morning my children have took a stand I'm taking a stand too amen see that's the kind of that's the kind of God you take a stand God Will Take A Stand oh but I'm so AF afraid this is going to happen and you know this person going to hate me and oh if I do this this is going to leave me oh my God the Bible said you got to love me more and you love anything anybody anywhere amen you love the Lord went down into the fire furnace taking their faith final stand for the Lord and about the time they got into the fire there was a fourth person like the son of man standing there fing away the breeze down there oh amen we don't care about the battles as long as he's in the battle with us oh my you got to pray a prayer not say a prayer is that right oh we so accustomed to pray saying a prayer but God ain't interested in saying a prayer he wants you to pray a prayer amen is that right oh my my can I read this talking about an old prostitute

happened to G uh America brother said it was the same thing that the children uh those disciples did now I'm just going to paraphrase it so I won't be so long but he went on to say by the grace of God he said you know what happened America experienced the Great Revival of all history and we did or Roberts Billy Graham Tommy osbor all them great Ministers of God Amen they flooded America to try to get her to repent God had more Mercy on America than he ever had on any nation in the world you reading the history amen different countries got one Prophet come on somebody but we got prophets and preachers and teachers and evangelist we got the whole fivefold Ministry going on in America and what did she do she turned her back on God what did she do she talked about Revival now oh y'all remember when y'all remember when but when the storm came amen the storm's coming too y'all hear what I'm saying but she's now a sinking ship y'all hear what I'm saying but at the time amen that the S the boat began to sink that was the time Jesus came walking on the wateren Hallelujah he was looking a far off and he saw amen that somewhere in this this this this drama they're going to call on me and I want to be there when they call Hallelujah come on somebody what happened America got so rich amen she thought she could go on without God why didn't they call on the Lord Jesus when the storm first started right they didn't do it and that's how it is now they want they see the storm they see the battle but how can you call on him when you don't know him Hallelujah they experienc Divine Healing they experienced the raising from the dead they experienced all of the great things amen but listen now look what's happening amen but there's a little group of peopleall that won't there not afraid of the anointing amen you see what I'm saying because they've been taught the American churches have been taught you know we don't need all this we've got this we've got that we don't have to do all of these things anymore you see they base their their their feelings their experience by feelings God never expect us to do that it's got to be by faith never by feelings feelings are good but your feelings will lie to you you love that he said don't be a scared scared it's the Lord Jesus who saved the sick and Afflicted is the only hope of Salvation in day when our Nations and world are in a turmoil and when our nation are breaking everywhere and when our churches are former and different and when the power of God has failed to be preached in the pulit Jesus come walking down on the troubled wall order don't be afraid of him accept him for he's the same yesterday today and forever saying the things that I did shall you also don't be afraid and see that's what people don't they don't want it but let me say it like this only those who are in a prayerful state will be able to see and catch this Rapture yeah you've got to pray people you got to pray you talk about Anna them in the in the in in in in Jesus day here they was of the old Saints and they were in the in the Bible say they were in the synagogue praying wanting to see the coming of the Lord they were praying go through the scriptures every time God sent someone somebody was praying amen amen Hannah was praying and God sent Samuel amen y'all hear what I'm saying so you got to know there's always prayer involved you want to see Jesus you got to pray and believe God that God is going to bring him to to you oh Lord Hebrews 10 please I'm not going to be long I can't I I wish I could preach it like I see it Hebrews 10:22 let us draw near with a True Heart in full Assurance of Faith having our hearts sprinkle from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water you know when I when I when I when I think about full Assurance I think about woman who had the issue of blood I I love that story because you know a lot of time for all years and years I thought oh she was walking them straight and then she just bent down but understand this lady was in excruciating pain when she pressed through that crowd God don't ever make it easy for you and she was an excruciating pain she had been bleeding for 12 years she should have been dead and you know she was weak and thin right had to have been you you you you see and and here she was going through mipos whatever it was but she had tried every kind of physan there was and there was nothing that could satisfy her and she presses through the crowd press now you got to realize what a crowd is like right if you can imagine amen what what it would be on a night you know like you have these big uh big uh concerts and people get stomped and trampled and all that kind of stuff and it was a crowd amen that would perhaps difficult to press through but God allowed her the strength to press through to Touch the Hem of His Garment how she didn't get knocked over steel I don't know because she had to be down in order to touch the him right now here she touches his him and he looks around and says who touched me his disciples think he's crazy because everybody's throwning him impressing him but he said virtue right and this lady amen must she had to been praying she had believed she had a full Assurance without one word of scripture if I could just touch the Hy of His Garment I know I'll be made whole Hallelujah that she didn't have no protocol there was nothing amen that was telling her if you you you know you know you scripturally right she just had a revelation something struck her and she moved she was caught by the thought of God Amen she moved amen and she touched to him and was made whole let me tell you something she didn't need somebody to tell her that some a faith dropped in her and she believed it and God gave it to her is that all right full Assurance of Faith amen having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without waving for he is faithful that promise don't waver now this is not a time am I bride or am I not will I get it or will I not oh this and that no sir you got to stand strong and say no sir I'm going all the way did somebody tell me this he told me this amen Hebrews 4:16 please this is a time of prayer prayer prayer prayer brother BRS what you doing now praying amen I'll spend more time praying this year than I ever have and I know God has given me the great Victory to do it amen amen you know it's wonderful prayer is really wonderful it's not like you talking to yourself you speaking to God and you know what if you listen he'll talk back to you how many times God has talk oh I was looking for a scripture people I was looking for a scripture and God been talking to me talking to me today and I'm I'm I'm looking in the scripture today in my back office for something else and I looked over to the left hand side and there was my answer right in the scripture right in the scripture here God directed me amen I thought I was looking for one thing he knew exactly where it's in me I love that I love that amen Hebrews 4:16 let us therefore come boldly into the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in time of need see so if we don't go and seek God for this help it's our own thought anybody need from God here hallelujah I do I need more of him I want to be just like him I I want to die completely to my thoughts my ways my actions my everything come on somebody I I know I'm not the only person well amen if if God had not laid something in you and I we would quit long time ago that's why people backslab because they God haven't haven't anchored them in there amen but when God anchor you amen nothing can turn you around because you can see the Finish Line amen I've been Ching myself I'm sorry I'm not sorry I'm enjoying myself Hebrews 11:6 amen but without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a reward of them that don't seek him now we got to understand he is God and he is a rewarder if you seek Him He will reward you that's what he's saying but your faith contacting God brings the results your faith contacting God brings the results in other words Lord if you don't if you don't come on the scene I'll die right here I ain't going nowhere until somehow we bring this thing together right that's when you really get something from God Amen you got to really really believe that he was wounded for your transgressions you got to believe that he was bruised for your iniquity you got to believe he come to deliver you if he saved you that means he come to deliver you amen cuz that's all part of the Salvation plan save Deliverance heal all of that is in the atonement every bit of it and if he can save you which is more difficult than healing you amen healing is the easy part come on that's just in your flesh uh uh but saving is in your soul he got to go to the third Court to get that Hallelujah and if God can save you he can heal you he can deliver you amen he's done it amen he's already done it and that's the thing we got to recognize he's already done it talking about sincere prayer and I'm going to move on but sincere prayer you talk about 2 Kings 20 and5 where he Hezekiah set his face to the wall and says Lord save me I don't want to die you know what I mean you think Hezekiah was up there doing some rosaries or something he was sincerely praying and I believe he really prayed right he prayed and he prayed and he prayed till he touched God and God dispatched the prophet said go on tell H I'm gonna give him 15 more years and he's different from me when I'm ready I want him to take it right on don't wait no not even a second longer come on somebody I I what what about all your family I'll meet them on the other side that's all I say I ain't jeopardizing nothing hezeki got 15 more years and 15 more years he got in trouble right I don't want to jeopardize God knows the perfect time to take me at his timing is when I want to go amen amen now here we go because I'm going tell you A True Believer by the grace of God I'm almost done people Psalms 3513 uh which is a a real good scripture cuz we're not here praying just for ourselves if you can't pray for your enemy you need the Holy Ghost amen Psalms 35:13 but as for me when they were sick my clothing was sackcloth I humbled my soul with fasting and my prayers return into my own bosom I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother I bowed down heavily as one that moured for his mother now that's deep but but in my adversities they rejoice and gather themselves together yay the objects gather the objects gathered themselves together against me and I knew it not they did tear me and ceased not but he understood they were his enemy and he still prayed with them regardless to how they treated him now that's a real real Christian is that all right but I'm going to show you what Collective prayer do will do if we really come together you know sometimes we come to together prayer even on Thursday but you know I don't know how much prayer we're praying and how much we praying prayer you understand what I'm saying how sincere really is because when I see what they did on in the book of Acts the Bible said and uh when they prayed at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sang Praises unto God and the prisoners heard them heard them now heard them right and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundation the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were open and every one bands were loose now now they prayed they they weren't praying they prayed and they sang and they worship and they prayed and they sang and they worship so much so it touched heaven and Heaven come down and shook the place now that's real prayer amen what about that prayer when Peter and was in jail they came together and they prayed all of a sudden the whole Angel dispatched himself and there Peter out the door the gate swung open without a right that's prayer same God Amen same God same God but somehow those people knew how to enter into a place that just seemed like we're just not doing it we ritual ritualistic say things but God is looking for somebody to get Ri down in there till if they their heart explode they going to get there see a real real down in that prayer we somehow we missing it folks we're missing it you see what you know I'm talking about collectively now cuz you talk about that woman and here she was a Pentecostal woman she says Lord where is that Elijah she said I prayed all night huh Lord don't let my son die like this I don't care if he die but save him Hallelujah I'm That Kind of a woman I'm a shite amen amen and I promised I dedicated him though he went wward yeah amen see a lot of time you dedicate them they still go but God say he'll bring them back I believe that with all my heart amen and they prayed they prayed they prayed they prayed or she prayed and then God broke a vision see I believe that I believe that same thing is now now now now amen that if you really want an answer from God and you set your heart to pray like you ought to don't worry about no time you get in there I don't care if you're not your eyes swell up until till they close amen I believe as you set your heart to pray like that confessing your sins and making things right before God and then seeking his petition or seeking him to answer your prayer he have to he can't refuse you right I mean come on look in the book of Acts this is my last scripture he will hear your prayer amen you so what you mean God don't care who you belong to and where you belong when sincere prayer God hears it it he said what do you mean he was Kus he was just a proelite huh Kus a proelite a gentile well what was the Jews doing there's not one record where the Jews God said I've heard your prayer this proelite believed God more so than the so-call original and he sought his face and God said your prayers has come up as a memorial meaning that he prayed more than once amen he constantly pray he built something in the spiritual realm that built from one level to the next level to the next level to the next level that God had to say listen look at this guy here he stands as a memorial here Jesus was told don't go to the Gentiles Paul didn't were supped I mean the the uh disciples weren't even supposed to go to the Gentiles God had to raise up amen then Jesus breaks it he go to Samaria said I have need to go to Samaria and now God comes in and why did happen why why why Gentile because the Jews had rejected and Paul was coming on the scene and God was turning the AIDS right then and there shutting the Jews out and opening the doors for the Gentiles amen and here was this man a proelite Amen in the Jewish faith but he prayed so much to his prayer went up as a memorial and guess what God comes along and he and he works with Peter and and and all of the rest of them and says but they said well no no and no unclean thing has ever come in my mouth but God said you know what I call clean don't you refuse it amen hallelujah now you say well brother what you saying I'm saying we've got to go deeper brother bandam talk about prayer and he says it's a traveling he said you call it Soul travail but in reality is soul travel we need to get deeper and I believe by the grace of God that's where God is calling us for this year to go into a place where God can take us places anybody know what I'm talking about you want you want God to just take you places how many time you dream I mean how many you prayer and somehow you think you slipped off into the dream and then you see things because you like wow you know it's amazing it's amazing I mean even today I mean this morning when I when God showed me something about one of my children and I'm like wow I mean it wasn't good but still he showed it to me gave me Grace to know how to pray I mean come on when you wake up from a dream you you know so real you wake up you go back to bed and then finish yourself start where you left finish again you wake up you go back three times has happened to me this morning who could have done that for God why did he show me not to criticize cuz anybody without the Holy Ghost a do do anything amen huh but God gives us why because we High we're priests amen right not high priest but we're priests amen Kings and Priests handling the blood of Jesus Amen doing like job amen I'm I'm okay I know my children out there sinning perhaps they'll be doing things out I can't keep up with them but I'm a I'm I'm a sacrifice the lamb amen that's what we here for amen we are amen the blood of Jesus Christ by the spirit Hallelujah the Holy Ghost in US amen makes us preach and that's why we can cry out amen the spirit and the bride say come we got to stand in the Gap amen got to stand in the Gap because Satan will devour he'll consume but right now if the salt loses savior remember amen destruction will not come until the bride is in such a fewer number God say destroy it you see what do you mean that's how it was in in the days of Sodom fat 50 40 30 hello it's got to be so few in number like God did in Sodom before the fire falls think about it everything else had gone worldly those who once believ don't believe no more Hallelujah come on and as it was in that day before the fire can fall that's why the prophet God said it'll be a handful that'll make a rapture not that they there wasn't any before died all but at the time of the translation It'll be such a few compared that God will be just to destroy it he'll take us up out of there you love the Lord let's let I wish I could have a one 2 three show you how it's all done but everybody's different all I got to tell is you got to just get on your knees and say God I heard your word I believe what brother Brooks preached was true take me there show me reveal it to me drive me deliver me or lead me you're the master you know and and and we know we've got to follow those bloody Footprints you see what I'm saying and that Bloody footprint those Footprints take you to Calvary folks it takes you to that place where you got to die out to yourself and I know with all of my heart I wish the whole church would have been here to hear this because prayer is the key to the Rapture I'm telling you it is the key to the Rapture that's where God will say things to you that a preacher can't tell you you love the Lord let's just B A word of prayer father God we come before you Lord Lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for being so good to us Lord you've been better to us than we've been to ourselves we pray father that you bless those who did not come this evening for whatever reason father I know many couldn't come because of the weather condition but perhaps there are those who are sick I know
