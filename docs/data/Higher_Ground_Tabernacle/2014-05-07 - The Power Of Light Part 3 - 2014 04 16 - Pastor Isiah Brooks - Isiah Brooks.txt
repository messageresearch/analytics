TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen amen we're not going to prolong the time we're just going to get right into the word of God surely God is good to us and uh we just thank him for being who he is we we owe so much to him anden we could never repay him amen for all that he has done for us and uh I I am so grateful we are approaching uh the celebration of his resurrection even though we celebrate him every day amen but uh I I thank God because God has given us a understanding of what the resurrection is all about and so so we really appreciate the Lord Jesus for being so good to us amen as we turn to the scripture according to First John we would we've been dealing with let there be light and the power of light of course this subject is eternal uh we could we could uh spend forever preaching on it starting from Genesis all the way to Revelation because God is life light am and uh whichever way you would take it uh there's always a scripture for it uh because he's above all through all and in you all amen there is no way of getting around God first John the first chapter we're going to begin with the first verse that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life these are not like Words these are this is to me is powerful it's such a powerful Revelation that John is is it's speaking of it's really really deep it don't just take it surface value it's it's deeper than that for the life was manifested we have seen iten and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us amen can't you feel this appreciation that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye Also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ amen these things write we unto you that your joy may be full amen this then is the message which we have heard of him and declared unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all amen if we say we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin in I read that seventh verse again but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin is that all right amen Philippians 2 please Philippians to beginning at the 13th verse for it is God who worketh in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure do all things without murmuring and disputing that you may be blameless and harmless the sons of God without reuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation among whom you shine as lights in the world let us pray Heavenly Father God we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for your love divine and everything that you have done for us we pray here this evening that you would be be merciful to us and Lord we know you will because your mercy endureth forever and they are renewed every morning great is thy faithfulness Lord we pray that you would just move and continue to move in our lives as we give you honor and praise in Jesus Christ name we pray amen you may be seated as we have said many times that God is uh he's light Prophet God tells us how that when it comes to uh God he is known uh in light and in fire but I want to kind of bring something to you this evening because I read Philippians 2 15 basically because it brings out the kind of a Nation we're dealing with when we talk about people who are unconverted we realize the scripture calls them crooked and perverse I don't care who it is there is no way that a man who is not born again there is no possible possible way for him to walk completely straight because the nature that is within him can never be straight amen the only way that we can walk in this last day properly before God is to have his Spirit within us we have looked at ourselves and we have found ourselves unworthy now I want you to know that that is a good thing to be able to judge yourself and throw your hands up in surrender and say Lord God I am guilty because when you can acknowledge that you're guilty that's when the Great judge can come on the scene and pardon you now brother bam teaches us that God always take these things that seems like nothing and makes something out of it and that's what he said in the little message why little Bethlehem he said God is so great till he takes the unidentified things of the earth to identify himself by it and I don't know about you but until Jesus Christ came into my life I was unidentified amen insignificant one of those things that will pass through and pass by and be forgotten amen but those are the kind of a people that God always uses he goes on to say God taking the things of the world I believe the scripture says by the foolishness of preaching it pleased God to take the UN identify things what we make great God call foolish what we put so much glory to God says is no good amen and what we think is no good God glorifies it we we we we must understand that everything of this world is just plain vanity am and we must learn by the grace of God at some point in time that only the things that we do for Christ will last we have heard that a many times but often times we are distracted by the things that are of the Dark World he goes on to say God took the Simple Man Without education not one day in school and met and yet said he was the greatest among all the prophets that ever lived because God identified himself in unidentifiable things how often you know you think about us we're not great men most people don't even know who we are we're not like President Kennedy or Abraham Lincoln or some great man of God not understand this that even Hitler has more Fame than you and me you and I but you see it is those little people that God can use those people like Gideon who who thought he was worthless he was unidentified he was hiding and that God had to shine the light in his life see I'm working with the power of of this light because the prophet of God brought to us that this power of light is able to transform amen hallelujah not only it's able to transform but it's able to renew your mind amen I have been reading a book dealing with food and it's it's really good to me and I was telling my wife about it the name of the book is called it starts with food so I went to the uh uh bookstore there a noble and I said I'm looking for a book and and she said do you know the title I said yeah it's starg with food then she asked me again can't you give me more than that I said it is it start with food she said give me more than one word food I said no the title is it stars with food she says oh she was able to look it up now you might think it's strange and I really believe that that you got to understand the only food that Adam and Eve had was food that would give them life nothing that would be contrary to their health spiritually and naturally but Satan introduced a hybrid food and because of that hybrid food it brought death come on he made and like he's doing now he made his food more appealing remember the Bible said it was good for the eyes and he made it more appealing he made it so good to it seems it made God's food God's word Bland and you better believe that science has worked this food situation in such a way to everything that is healthy for us just doesn't taste good but you got to realize amen before candy came into being because they know you like sweets your body like the taste of sweet your body like the taste of salt and your your body like the sour so they took those those things from the food and enhanced it by science they literally tried to reprogram in which they did but it's faulty because your body amen you taking foods that science has given you it brings death and your body can't recognize it as being food so therefore it it cannot process what we call food but the original food that kind that God made we call it organic now but is the original stuff that your body can identify with you know in that book it tells us that how come how we continue to gain weight because the body is so designed it pulls the nutrients out of the real food it ca for it and it knows that a Apple supposed to have this a orange supposed to have this certain meat supposed to have this but because it's all been hybrid and it doesn't have the substance in it that your body needs hello it constantly calls for it we look in the mirror and we can see the scale going up and we're thinking that we're over over uh how can I say uh uh we we we we we got more than enough but what we fail to see is your body is looking from the brain and is telling you that you're starving and you got to continue to eat to survive y'all hear what I'm saying but it's a it's a mechanism it's a thing that's in your brain if you can reset it Hallelujah then it will be able to identify the foods that you're now eating as poison oh come on somebody and that's what we've been doing they've been poisoning us hello somebody they know it they understand it and we've been blind to it and God's natural foods have literally become tasteless only because of Satan's enhancement he took God's creation and perverted I was telling my wife I said let me ask you something it which one would you rather have if you like bananas would you rather a a a piece of candy that tastes like banana or would you rather have a banana now I'm just saying from today's perspective we'll eat all of all of the candy that taste like banana why because the taste is enhanced you don't know what you going to get in a banana now the smell tastes better than the taste and I'm saying all of this is because s Satan has been doing this all along since the time of Eden amen oh come on somebody but the light now why because we're now it's amazing how people who are naturally uh you know now they want to go back to the original way of eating Hallelujah hello as the original word has returned in the spiritual people people are now wanting the real organic stuff because they realize what they've been eating is killing them amen right so is it with the the true children of God God is shining the light on the word and you don't want no hybrid stuff you want the original word because you realize that's where the life is now we look at at a time where you and I must come to a place to recognize what day and hour we're living in as we said by the grace of God that evening light came and then that evening light became uh a a day star I was thinking about that star that hung there by that moon for whatever reason the moon may have turned into blood but that star was just as bright as ever that star was a Watchman even over the moon come on somebody now I look at these things and I says Lord I say here we are in these last days and you and I have been chosen by God to be the light of the world Amen now I'm going tell you something in this book they say if you get 30 days of eating properly the things that they have in this book it will reset your whole body's program and you'll basically not want to have anything to do with this other stuff now y'all might look at me crazy but that's my plan that's what I plan to do Lord amen you know and I thought about that because I said now Lord look at this thing I said God re resets us he resets us because there's a time we thought denomination of food was okay Hallelujah but when we heard the eagle Scream the real dietician that told us that we were not an eagle and we're not supposed to be eating that slot we changed our diet and this diet that we're now eating off of is bringing us where to eternal life amen you said well brother I I don't know about that but anyway it's true anyhow we're living in a time where in investigating Angels now I'm moving on we're living in a time where investigating angels have been seen since the time when brother brandham walked the Earth how much longer do you think God is going to tolerate this world in the condition that is in hello y'all getting quiet on me now my point is this if they came to investigate and this is one of the things that I really love because I've never seen it like this before brother bam said when they came to investigate what was going on down in Sodom and Gomorrah that he said one Angel stay stay with Abraham now you got to realize Billy Graham or Roberts never talk about angels but here was William brandham saying this Angel comes to me in a light he steps out of the light and he's come from the presence of God this Angel not only teaches me but he shows me scripture everything he said the angel ever said he said he went back to the Bible to see whether or not it was so so you said well what do you mean brother Brooks now you got to realize that the angel never left brother random or put it this way the angel never left Abraham until the time was right for the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah now I'm going bring the angel down because I'm talking now about the mighty Angel we have now in our presence in our midst the mighty angel of Revelation 10 hallelujah hallelujah still here he hasn't left the moment he goes up we go with him hallu glory is that right come on somebody had not God sent us an angel where would we be he talks about the investigating angels He said you know he said the world calls them UFOs he said let them call them whatever they want to he said but we know they're in investigating Angels so we realize by the grace of God not only has God uh H H shared with us amen the revelation of all these things the world is seeing we ought to be excited oh they seen UFOs here they seen UFOs here they seen UFOs here oh my goodness I I wonder how many of y'all realize what God was doing when he he stoned Russia when he stoned did y'all know that when that astroid came or whatever it was Comet whatever you call it amen when it hit and it blew up like that amen what was it we were looking in the in in the in the in the uh you uh the uh uh sky for one thing and here God comes around and hit him again what was he doing he was basically sharing and showing at a time you think not and you better recognize this stoning is the portion that's right Jezebel will be Stone you so what do you mean the explosions and everything else that goes on will cause such a catastrophic event to carry on the Bible said the hell will be 100 pound each can you imagine the destruction of a hell that's 100 pound there is no head if that hit you there is no you regardless of where it hits you there you're done so it shows that the god that we serve and brother bam said it like this he said you know he said what will be the Judgment of this Gentile Nation Gentile world who had so much truth now look at this out don't there has been no other age since the beginning of time that God showed grace and mercy to like this one amen there have never been a Revival in the history of time like there was in this day God took a or Roberts God took a Billy Graham and all of the others Tommy osbor and all these great evangelist shaking this United States and the world and they turn their backs right thank God it was purposely done and orchestrated by God he had already written that will be blind and naked and not know it and I read to you the quote last week he did it so that he can get a bride Hallelujah just like God blinded the Jews to get a gentile bride in Paul's de God blinded Le the sheia that he might have a bride and guess who she is the unidentified Hallelujah you so unidentified they don't even know what you are you're not denomination you're not organization amen you don't have a board of Bishop or some kind of headship you Iden unidentified you don't belong in this but you are the ones that God has decided to show his glory through amen you got a lot of problems but God knew you would have amen find me somebody in the Bible who didn't have problems find me somebody Amen in the word who was great uh great and and never had a problem or fail or failed God there are aren't any the Bible said we all have come short of the glory of God woo glory to God now brother brandom said in that message as I was with Moses he said Moses had a lot of failures but God never looked at his failures amen than he looked at the commission Hallelujah come on somebody and if God would withdraw the blood from the bride she would be as filthy as anybody else amen oh I'm going be preaching on the blood this coming Sunday if you don't get it you if you can't be S if you ain't saved yet you'll be saved then he because you got to realize by the grace of God if it wasn't for the blood of Jesus and nobody don't want to speak about the blood anymore hallelujah amen but if it wasn't for his blood where would we be there would be no world because you know we we thought that the blood was just covering us brother brandom through the message brought that the blood was a cumference around the whole earth that's why Sinners can still stand because of his blood even though they don't appreciate it it is his blood amen that's literally stopping the wrath of God Amen we are enforcers I I like that because amen God is a enforcer he doesn't ask for you to move he moves you am is that all right he's an enforcer and you and I must recognize amen that we're part of him amen look what he says in Ephesians 58 said for ye were sometime Darkness but now are ye light in the Lord walk as children of the light I am not of the darkness therefore I will not behave like the darkness I will not act like the darkness I'll not go where Darkness go I am in the light I thought about it and I said Lord it is not true the absence of light brings Darkness it is light that penetrates the darkness would be here if the light wasn't on Amen but the light brings it disperses every ounce of Darkness till it becomes invisible to the Natural Eye you can't even see it because in light there is no Darkness amen and when you began to see who you are that's why brother brandom said the Bride of Jesus Christ have been so Justified as though she never did it in the first place Hallelujah you said well how can that be he said God refused or would not take the bride out of Jesus Christ until the work was finished Lord hallelujah so she climbed calvary's heel with him amen she suffered the pain that he suffered amen she suffered the humiliation he suffered he she was in him and because she was in him now he's in her hallelujah oh my God he held it together he won the battle for the first Adam couldn't do it even though he walked out with Eve he couldn't redeem her Hallelujah but the second Adam amen who is the light of God Amen he is that quickening Spirit Hallelujah did y'all know that did you know and and brother Keith brought this my I knew the scripture I had the scripture and I thought why didn't I use the scripture he I hope he didn't mind me saying that but the Bible tells us that in James 11:17 for every good gift and every perfect gift is from above amen now I don't know how you tie that into the message but brother bandam said that the Bride of Jesus Christ is a love gift to Christ from God W hallelujah amen so what are you saying brother BRS whether you like it or not the light of this message is I'm perfect amen amen if I came from God I am a perfect gift and if I came from above I am oh my you are perfect gift I am a perfect gift and no matter what Satan can tries to do he can't change amen glory hey come on somebody how do you know woo Lord have mercy I'm I'm trying my best not to carry on but how do you know amen that you your father is light because you saw the light you see the light you understand the light is that right the Bible said that Darkness cannot comprehend the light and because you can comprehend it that is determined that you can't oh well brother Brook I'm faulty I am not faulty my flesh is hallelujah when you're born of God you're born perfect that's the only way that's the only way God don't bring forth deformed children he bring forth perfect children thank you Lord the blood is perfect how can his blood produce something thing outside of perfection Hallelujah and what you don't recognize perhaps is that seed that he planted in you before the foundation of the world was perfect perfect Hallelujah so when the preaching of the Cross came to you the blood struck that seed amen hallelujah and brought forth his life in youen that's the only way amen isn't it true according to 1 Corinthians 15 he says oh fool don't you know in order for a seed to to live it must it must die first before it can be quickened before it could be brought to life it had to die you see what brother I'm not where I supposed to be you work with your flesh but the seed in you in order for it to be quick and in order for you to see this thing it had to die amen something your will your desire has to die Hallelujah in order for Christ to live is he living amen and you got to recognize oh well I ain't doing like so and so well maybe your faith is not where his faith is the God God said he gave Every Man a Measure of Faith my measure may not be as great as somebody else's Hallelujah but when we put those Faith together we can move mountains Hallelujah come on somebody the Bible said where two or three are gathered in my name there I am in the midst I'm telling you something you'll never make it out of this world until you trust the work of God's salvation amen you got to trust it you don't have no other choice your church can't save you your pastor can't save it your Bishop Elder nobody can save you outside of Jesus Christ who is a savioru even William Bram can't save you and that's not being disrespectful he said I can't even heal I love him I can't hardly wait to meet him Hallelujah I'm just saying Lord I I I just just know I just know uh by the word of God the Bible says amen fear that angel don't don't don't don't disrupt him now you fear Him and do what he says do because amen he has a right to Pardon you is that all right for every every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of who lights with whom is no varable there ain't no changing in him he's not like water that's going to change into gas and and then the next day it's it's it's it's ice he's unchangeable neither is there in the shadow of turning Hallelujah we come to a place Hallelujah there is you can look all around Hallelujah there is no past there is no Shadow am hello somebody why because your past is in the SE of forgetfulness God can't even see it Hallelujah That Old Devil I tell you what he's always trying to make us feel guilty is that all right amen and that Ephesians 5:14 14 says amen wherefore he said awake thou that sleepeth and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee what light Hallelujah wake up rise from the dead Hallelujah that's what it is the problem is we're too ashamed Amen to say I'm guilty Lord I'm guilty I'm worthy of death Hallelujah but I need your grace and your mercy Hallelujah and you promised it to us Lord I'm not trying to defend myself I I don't have a judge I don't have a jury I don't have no defendant I am my own and I'm pleading for your mercy and your grace Hallelujah and he says okay I'm not just going to give you Grace I'm GNA give you Grace Grace Hallelujah I'm going to cause you to Triumph you might not be worthy of it but I'm going to make it happen for my name's sake amen hallelujah thank God for the light of God let me tell you something I may not be what I want to be but I know God exists I know he's real but I can because I can see where he brought me from now I don't know about you I was in a cage Hallelujah I was in prison Hallelujah to my own flesh my own desires amen Devils ruled my life but he whom the son is set free he's free indeed and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty there is Liberty I know you might look let me tell you something the Bible said all things are lawful but not all things are expedient Hallelujah in other words amen who going to lay in the charge that God's elect Hallelujah is that all right I heard brother Brandon preaching this this evening and he began to talk about about that uh remember the cow and you know those stary eyes and you know the choosing of the Bride he said oh boy he said don't you don't you choose that kind with the wild eyes and then he say Lord forgive me you know he knew at that point in time but but God let him say it Hallelujah but who's going to condemn him y'all hear what I'm saying amen when you see by the grace of God how God through his Prophet worked with such an amazing grace he has such a friendship you know what I'm talking about all of us allow our friends to get away with things that you wouldn't let somebody else get away with come on somebody it's true but we're conquerors we are conquerors and God want us to listen I'm telling you the only reason why you don't see yourself as a conqueror is because you're eating Satan's diet huh Satan got you eating some kind of harest making you think that this conquering is of your own your yourself but this conquering is Christ in you he is the mighty conqueror so if he's a conqueror and he's in me that means I'm a conqueror if he's a conqueror and he's in you that makes you a conqueror then Paul goes on to say we're more than a conqueror why because they did not expect light to come down into hell Hallelujah that was the day the son descended all the way into hell Hallelujah and he found Satan knocked on his door Hallelujah and he conquered death hell in the grave now you say I wasn't there yes you are you were there with his flesh and you were there in his Spirit Hallelujah I'm going prove that to you because when he rose on the Easter morning brother bandam said that was the first time two sons arose at the same time hallelujah amen the natural son which ties out one of these old days my natural body arise Hallelujah and the spiritual son which was Jesus Christ show that he conquered amen the elements of this realm and the elements of the Heavenly realm put those two together and they roseo that's the light of the word think about it this death Hell In The Grave why should I be afraid hey we enforcers amen hallelujah David said I just didn't let my enemy go I stumped on him I he said I brought him down to the dust Hallelujah and that's exactly what this bride is going to do she might look like a weaking but God is forcing her he's pushing her into that place she'll cry out oh Lord once more and we'll leave out of here with our feet on the devil's neck Hallelujah why because we God can't move until his Enemy enemy becomes his foot stol and you the Bride of Jesus Christ amen as that brother said the other day you're the feet of God is that right Joshua wherever you go this is the light of your message wherever you plant your feet is yours Hallelujah and that commission has been given to the Bride of Jesus Christ wherever you plant your feet it's yours that's the truth amen y'all heard my story y'all heard last Sunday oh when Wednesday was it yeah amen Sunday yeah Sunday amen we lost our our debit card I told my wife like it was all God I said we've been PL we've been preaching on Amen the power of of light and I knew that was darkness that talked to me on the phone because he was trying to get me upset yeah I mean just just telling me all the negative stuff and what could be done I say sir I said I've never heard such a thing where I can't even come look for my my uh my my uh debit card in the trash he said well I don't want nobody coming by the business and seeing you looking in the trash that go that'll be bad for the business the holy spirit said that's a challenge Hallelujah I said Lord y'all remember I said I don't know how he going to have me going I didn't know whether he would have me as a lamb or lion but I was going Hallelujah you got to realize now now it is the Lamb that leads the lion oh come on come on it's the lamb that leaves the lion huh that's right he was a king but it was the lamb nature that let him come on somebody so when we look at this thing you say Lord what were you anyway when I got there I was I had such peace and he had me so humbled and here the ladies I said listen I'm not causing to I didn't come to bring no trouble I said but I just come to um you know see can I go look for my Debbie car I said we were here my wife and I were here around 12:31 whatever time it was I said and the and the manager who they say uh uh J I said yeah I said well Jason told me that I couldn't even look in the trash they said why they all three of them dropped their mouth in humiliation and embarrassment they said we the very thing I said we've never heard of such a thing they said you can go look at it go look for a trash right now they said what time I said I told him the time they said the trash hadn't even gone out yet he could have easily gone out there and look in that trash they said you know what they told me you need to report him they gave me his name and all of that stuff and I've been waiting on God to see what he wants me to do but my point is I went to that garbage can that track and nobody could have seen me it had a what you call it um huh bar yeah I mean I went in and closed the door nobody could see me and I said Lord you got to show me where it is people of God with all those bags in there God led me through the first bag the first bag the first bag hallu had my debit card in it now now if that ain't God the light conquered the darkness amen prise hallelujah the light conquered the darkness and I tell you what the lady there was a lady at the at the at the uh drrive through she was looking to see whether I found it or not and when I came up waving it she just worshiped God she there she threw her hands up you know why because I'm going to tell you something when you follow the leadership of the Lord it might seem full but you got to recognize who you are and I'm going tell you something preaching that kind of message I could not back down I saw what the devil was doing Hallelujah and God conquered the devil that day conquer the devil that day is that all right amen Malachi 4 2 through3 says but unto you that fear this is what I love you said well brother what do you mean I do you fear the name he said but unto you that fear my name do you fear the name of the Lord he said if you fear this name he said he said he said uh uh fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with yielding in his wings didn't is that not right amen did not Jesus Christ rise with healing in his wings Hallelujah when he rose from the dead that not you know what he healed us from death hell grave every sickness he healed us amen amen I didn't say he was going to heal us he healed us and when we realize that we are truly healed we take a take a translation amen hallelujah healed with healing in his wings he said and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the star and ye shall tread down the wicked I like that you should trade down the wicked Hallelujah for they shall be as Ash Under The Souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this said the Lord not tomorrow this day amen when he prophesied Malachi was prophesying in this day amen oh come on somebody because we must still subdue is that all right 1 Thessalonians 5:5 say ye are the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of darkness is that all right let us turn to First John 2 please oh my I I don't know whether I'm getting it over but I surely hope I am by the grace of God I hope God is bringing something where you can you can your faith will increase amen because I don't care I'm going care every sickness in your body is Darkness hello somebody well I was born with it you it's still darkness and if God redeem you you have the power and the authority to override that to destroy it Hallelujah now you mean to tell me that your faith can move a mountain and it can't move a demon hello come on somebody amen you just got to say Lord I don't care what it feels like I don't care what it tastes like I don't care what it looks like Hallelujah you got to confess this with your mouth brother brandom is that right he said if you confess it with your mouth God will dispatch I'm use that word myself dispatch but he said God would give an angel to you that would literally make that thing obey your confession huh that's right you got an angel watching and waiting but he must see the faith in you you said that's not true it is true brother brownon talks about that little Hill really amen those two women that got got healed and their husband was criticizing them said well you this ain't this and this ain't that and I know but she said honey no man could have told me that that had to be God she held on to his faith and the brother said one day the angel of the Lord walked through the city Hallelujah glory to God Amen the lady woke up and the Big G or whatever was gone and and the and the cancer the also whatever was in her stomach was gone one was eating he said they the though the uh the uh what what they call it the atheist guy amen he said he said I thought somebody had died up

70 something years old done live a sinful life all these years amen the Infidel brother ad call and you find out by the grace of God Amen God's grace and mercy Hallelujah he looked like a devil but he was seed Hallelujah he just needed the right time he needed light to strike the seed is that right amen that Prophet talked to him in such a way amen and said now let me tell you something I put that water up on that pole and tell me amen will that water come down out of that bucket into that pole he said if you can give me that answer he said I'll tell you who told me he said tell told you he said yes I'm I'm William he said what's his name William I said that's me he led that old man you know him God was mindful God took took that prophet of God a couple of years back to the same place come up to that woman she's bitter now she used to be old Methodist amen amen what you doing on my property well I've got permission you don't have no permission at all you know she carries on like that and then he began to say yes I some years ago me and we here and y'all know the story and she said you're brother brand what was it he kept it in such a way am me he didn't scream back at her but he was loving her he he was able to see what was going on in her heart he was loving her and all of a sudden it broke the sun broke through Hallelujah I'm talking about the s o n Jesus Christ himself broke through that darkness and guess what God through that man brought Redemption back to that woman God didn't leave let the husband die without a wife he came back and picked her up Hallelujah so what are you saying brother Brooks see we are light and when you can Shine Your Light I'm telling you in the most adverse times people can't help but to know it now the Bible tells us now right in wisdom you don't if somebody raising at you you don't raise back it's said a soft answer y y'all hear what I'm saying fire begets fire y'all hear what I'm saying it is what it is so if we could learn by the grace of God the Lord help me cuz that's what I said I did not know how I was going to respond to that man especially if he had been there I didn't know who Jason was but you know I was ready for Jason y'all got y'all know what I'm talking about you got the devil on one end and God on the other huh but I was praying God I want to let this light of yours shine through me and God did it he had it all staging right [Music] Hallelujah first John 2 amen is that all right people of God I don't care where you are on your job can't nobody defeat you you know sometime God has stir things up so that you can get down on your knees like Daniel Daniel had to pay three times a day Hallelujah and sometime that's what you got to do amen he stir you up amen he got a reason for it amen it ain't no coincident God has a reason and the reason is that you to conquer and subdue you don't run from the enemy you conquer the enemy we're more than conquerors Hallelujah man we we know the devil he ain't got no teeth that's all he got a fake Roar he ain't got no teeth come on somebody we got to recognize that 1 John 2:9 And1 he that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother is in darkness even until now hello amen and your brother is not just your Christian brother y'all hear what I'm saying because if that was the case why would God even say anything to Cain see what I'm saying amen so that's why brother Brandon he tried his best Amen to you know to be kind to all all men communicate with all men we we become as they are not sinful but I'm saying you know our problem is that we exalt ourselves as Christians when we should obey humble ourselves anybody guilty Hallelujah so you know and it's true now let's move on he that loveth his brother abideth in the light and there is none occasion of stumbling in him why when you can learn to love your enemy you really got the goods then you got the goods you got the goods and one thing about your enemy he don't like it cuz you love him huh and he know you love him and the more he know you love him the more he becomes your enemy he hates it why he can't comprehend you he can't understand how you can love him when they've done he done you so wrong how could he love me right and yet he's dying for love but he don't want your kind yeah but he that hateth his brother is in darkness and walketh in darkness and knoweth not whether he goeth because that Darkness has blinded his eyes and how often we've allowed sin and darkness to cover our eyes to the reality that every man is born in the in the image of God don't you think God he God is God we can't even call a man a fool God say don't even call him a raiker come on somebody Les you be in danger of hair fire Hallelujah come on somebody it's true that's how sensitive the holy spirit is now you got to realize the Bible said God would that none perish and don't you know there be those who are not of his seed that God will give eternal life think about it like the brother brought out I forgot who who it was he said think about it he said here it is you looking for your son and all of a sudden you find your son and he has a friend and you can afford to adopt or bring his friend in as an adoption that's why he said all that love you and all that you love hello somebody come on How Sweet It Is amen so you must realize amen that God ain't going to tell you to do something that he himself won't Doo did y'all know that brother bam had a neighbor who would do good to to them brother bam said they'll be there a neighbor so I get excited when somebody likes me amen because I realize it's ordained by God they may never come to know this message but for sure they're kind and gentle to you cuz I'm going to tell you something if they had a real devil in there you would know it you you would know it is that all right oh my my my ye are the children of the light and the children of the day and we are not of the night uh but uh uh excuse me we are not of the night nor of darkness is that right we're going to love our brothers I don't care what it takes Lord if I if I'm not there give it to me Lord amen hallelujah our duty is to enforce the laws of light and you got to realize out of all that persecution out of all that cursing out of all that spitting in the face Jesus still said father forgive them for they know not what they do now don't tell me that's perfect love when you can recognize the spirit behind of a person and yet love them because they don't know what they doing a lot of us we look at these things oh it's so bad it's happening like this and and God said but you ask me for character I'm trying to get you to love this am I'm trying to get you to overcome this and when you can begin to to look at the individuals and pity them and love them those demons will stop because light has one amen light has oneall demons can't work in except with in darkness and they have to plunge You Into Darkness to work to have some kind of effect they got to put you into darkness come on come on come on it's true anyhow amen I would do this to enforce the laws of light and every time I think about it I said here it is not even the grave could hold light God went he went all the way into the grave no tomb no nothing could hold that light there that light came up you got to realize Jesus wasn't clothed in dark clothes when he went to hell he was light am all hell knew he was there amen Hallelujah and all hell know you here am you say oh no they don't yes they do let me tell you something the Catholic church and all of those people are working to put this light out but they can't put it out because they didn't start it Hallelujah they tied for thousand of years Amen to imprison him that's what brother B said he said that's what the devil tried to do he tried to keep the light in tuned Hallelujah but he couldn't do it why because that light was powerful Hallelujah come on somebody it's the truth amen the Bible said amen that day that light shook the Earth amen and and however whatever Dimension hell was it had to let him go and not only did he let him go he went by the grave site and and the stone was rolled away I love this Resurrection hallelujah amen because the Bible said when he was resurrected the angel stood by his grave hallelujah hallelujah when they thought Hal that's what God did didn't he he ran the Roman soldiers off Hallelujah the angel says now we on duty Hallelujah and that's how it is with your tomb when you go to the Grave Hallelujah you got Angels right there why you're royalty the power of God is still resting on your bones hey it's true anyhow you don't go to the Grave alone even your bones is important to God cuz he know he's got to bring him up again ain't God good to us hallelujah in Genesis 1:3 I'm almost done in Genesis 1:3 when God said let there be light there was light I thought about it you know I heard him on on uh uh the message uh it is the rising of the Sun brother bom said that was God speaking light into existence you know you can't do no work in the dark that's what he said he said work while it's day because when night come no man can do no work so God that's not even that's not even sunlight he working with right there he's just bringing light to everything that he can work Hallelujah and so when you see that by the grace of God listen to it brother show share that on on that message there so when we look at it here God brings light and that's what he did to are our lives even though Darkness still exists he brought light into our eyes light of the eye makes the whole body light Hallelujah so he brought light to our eyes that we can distinguish the light from the darkness come on somebody is that all right and because of that we can separate the light and the Darkness and therefore we can walk in the light and not in the darkness hallelujah amen Jesus said unto him saying yet a little while is the light with you walk while ye have the light huh lest Darkness come upon you but he that walketh in darkness knoweth not hither he goeth whether he goeth while you have light believe in the light while you have light believe in the light while you have light believe in the light that you may be Children of the light these things spake Jesus and departed and did hide himself even from then hallelujah is that right he brought a message Hallelujah and he said walk in the light and then when that message was brought amen he went off to scene you where you couldn't see his physical body anymore but he warned us walk in the light because Darkness coming the Lord that's what a Psalm says the Lord is my light and my salvation the Lord is the strength of my life Whom Shall I be afraid Easter morning was a great day you got to realize there was no other the greatest light ever Sha Sha on the day of Easter when Jesus Christ Rose I can tell you what I I I I don't know what the flowers were singing but they had to be singing something the trees had to be humming and doing something everybody every listen you said how can that be well if when he was dying they were dying with him if he if he rose they had to rise with him Hallelujah they was rejoicing when he were dying they were crying amen he said I think the moon or the sun gave a nervous prostration Hallelujah break down had a break oh my god oh I don't know I tell you what I don't know how God going to do it but I would love for him to when we get up there to do do a rewind so I could just see how they Carri it on Hallelujah woo yeah especially those ones he brought out of paradise hallelujah oh my God I just wish you by the grace of God i' like to see that amen think about it the pure light the power of light the power of God came did you know brother B said when Jesus Christ died it reshaped the whole Earth that earthquake reshaped the whole Earth what you think going to happen when this bride is resurrected H glory to God what's going to happen when these un un un unidentified people leave Hallelujah they ain't on no no church book roster or anything they ain't no great people most of them illiterate yes Hallelujah you got to be crazy to work to worship like this listen no matter where the seed you know brother R said if a seed was planted be underneath the pavement he said that son strike it it will penetrate I preached a message years ago PR penetration hallelujah how that seed penetrated amen even through the concrete Hallelujah and so is the bride no matter where you are most of us was locked down in Hell somewhere we were our souls were lost Hallelujah but when that light struck Hallelujah we work through that Darkness Hallelujah you don't come up all of a sudden amen but you move move move and that's what's happening right now you're growing you're growing you're growing in the midst of this Darkness even though they the world can't understand it they can't see it Hallelujah but I'm going to tell you something that light in you one of these days is going to Quicken that body it's going to change hallelujah amen you'll become a supernova hallelujah hallelujah explosion of some sort amen you'll be a light Hallelujah is that true now you got to realize amen that the light that we're going we're coming into amen I'm going tell you something there ain't there ain't no carton that can shine like that the Bible says amen that when Jesus went on the mount Transfiguration it glowed we get the same he get amen hallelujah we're not just going to get something that that's been washed it will glisten it will glow Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying the Bible said there will be no need for the light in the city because the lamb is the light Hallelujah and you got to recognize Hallelujah when these Stones Get Together Hallelujah they'll be shouting Hallelujah there'll be dancing over there you got to realize amen that you'll be such a light amen you said brother books I don't know about that well the first thing that brother brandham saw when he came to that angel he said it was a light Hallelujah and you got to realize amen those investigating angels we see them at the up in the in the atmosphere they're lights hallelujah amen and I really believe that when when when when we were born amen the heavens shouted because they've been waiting for you and me for a long time Hallelujah the only problem with us right now now we have not fully come to recognize who we are Hallelujah but you keep eating the right food you keep eating the right food it re it will reset your thinking it will reset your appetite it will reset everything in you and you'll say I'm fed up with this world I don't want it no more Lord let your will be done in my life the purpose for which I come Hallelujah I can't hardly wait you know after a while those scientists are say oh what's happening up there look like a city coming our way Hallelujah he said it he said I go and I prepare a place for you it'll be a city did you know that and the Bible said that same city will descend Hallelujah out of the heaven so you never know what God may allow them to see before he finally break it up amen they might thinking oh it's a comet oh it's another planet but they won't they don't they don't understand the bride to be riding with it Hallelujah glory to God they might think it's another star coming to to interrupt with our star our son but I tell you what what they fail to see man is that when the Lord Jesus come the whole Heavens will light up huh yes sir nothing can hide the light no no seed can hide from the light the light will find you you love the Lord amen let's let's turn to one more scripture I'm going let you go Psalms 11937 please Psalms 11937 you love the Lord oh people if we could just read you know God has to give it to us a little bit at a time because if we didn't like that lady said I'll bust I just bust yes sir it says turn away my eyes from beholding vanity and Quicken thou me in thy way establish thy words unto thy servant who is devoted to thy fear turn away my reproach which I fear but thy judgments are good behold I have longed after thy precept Quicken me in thy righteousness that's all I want nothing else matter I want you know a lot of time we we look at these things and they have such a hold on us and we know that the whole it shouldn't be in other words things we be too concerned about natural things and those things are the things that Satan holds us man the cares of this world we we it hinders us it takes it distracts us I can see why God told those disciples don't take nothing don't even take an extra coat with you just go because I don't want nothing hindering you I don't want the cares of this world hindering you I'll open the door for you and if the door don't open that means that's a door I don't want you to walk in and I just believe with all my heart that somehow and I know what's going to happen he's forcing us into it you know that squeeze is for our benefit you may stand it is for our benefit when we recognize that God is going to push us into that place but you know what really gives us Grace what really the beauty of it is because we won't be of what he's doing we won't be ignorant of what he's doing he takes those insignificant people like Mary and look what he did with her nobody knew her now the whole world knows is that right and you know what here's her journey a lot of time we think because we're bride the journey got to be easy it won't be easy it never will be God don't give us to take us the easy way because he's training us he making us like himself building a perfect faith in a perfect love and a perfect trust in him not in ourselves in him and when you begin to see that perfect love and that perfect Faith you know it makes the journey so much easier you love God Amen let's just have a moment of prayer Heavenly Father God we thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord we thank you for the light Lord pray that this message has been an encouragement to the people even as it's been to me oh God our Father we are the lights of the world and we must constantly remind ourselves we're not of this world L help us Jesus Deliver Us Lord God from every Temptation Deliver Us from every snare Deliver Us father from every cage and every downfall Deliver Us and place us into that light give us Grace father God that we will dwell in that light God dwellers of light you are our father and you're the father of Lights help us right now father God our

defeated and I thank you Father for that I thank you Father for that I thank you for the light that you've given unto us and I pray father that you continue to open our hearts and our eyes to your
