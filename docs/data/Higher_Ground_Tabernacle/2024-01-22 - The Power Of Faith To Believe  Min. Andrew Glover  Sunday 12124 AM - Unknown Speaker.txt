the glory in Jesus name we pray and all the Believers says amen amen and amen amen if you have your Bibles this morning we will invite you in your scriptures to the Book of Romans the 10th chapter we do want to say God bless you this morning we thank the Lord for the opportunity to be here once again see see a few familiar faces and some new faces this morning we do want to thank our brother Brooks for the invitation to be here we pray something was said last night in the meeting to bless you and to encourage [Music] you and we're just asking the Lord to come by and speak this morning in the Book of Romans the 10th chapter and the 17th verse Paul here writing says so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God now brother brandham tells us that hearing by the word of God he says or by the word word made [Music] manifest now in the Book of Luke the first [Music] chapter Paul says that Faith cometh by hearing if you're hearing that means something is being said in Luke the first chapter and the 26th verse I have quite a lengthy reading here but I want to rehearse to you the conversation between Mary and the angel and in the 6 26th verse and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth Nazar to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should [Music] be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with [Music] God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of go the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seen I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God and behold thy cousin Elizabeth shall also conceive a son in her old age and this is the six month with her who was called Baron for with God nothing shall be impossible now the angel has said all these things unto Mary and in the 38th verse and Mary said behold the handmade of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her now one other place I want to look is the book of Acts the 27th chapter just one verse there in Acts 27 and verse 25 we love the Lord this morning acts 27 and verse 25 now Paul has been given a heavenly vision he's going to stand before Caesar in a certain destination and he's going to go through a shipwreck and all kinds of troubles but in in the 25th verse wherefore sir be of good cheer for I believe God that it shall be even as it was told me may God add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can be seated I want to this morning to talk to you for just a few moment on the power of Faith to believe power of Faith to believe and if I could pull something out of that I want to take for a subtitle it shall be even as it was told me uh reading Romans 10:17 from the Amplified Bible that faith comes from hearing what is told faith comes from hearing what is told and what is heard comes by the preaching of the message concerning Christ acts 2725 from the Amplified Bible says keep up your courage men for I believe God how many can say I believe God and have complete confidence in him that it will turn out exactly as I have been told so in other words what was told in the vision will be exactly what will be in the manifestation says oh don't you just love that it will be as it was told me if the angel truly comes from God is from God it is bound to be it is a direct message from Glory again in Jehovah Miracles she looked at this great Angel and his name is Gabriel now there is angels of the Lord there are many of them and they come to Earth to bring messages Gabriel when he comes something major is going to happen he was the one who announced the first coming of Christ he will announce the second coming of Christ and he told Mary that thou has found favor with God what a message to bring her th H has found favor with God so the angel was not bringing Mary an idea but the angel was bringing Mary a message and the message was a vision concerning her life in 1947 says I have no power within myself to do anything I am just a man I'm uneducated I am sure that my testimony is right and that truly a supernatural being came and made these statements and I have not been disobedient to the heavenly [Music] vision there was an angel that came to Mary and told Mary what would happen there was an angel that came to Paul and told Paul what would happen and in this generation been an angel returned to the church with a direct message from Glory announcing to the church that there is a vision concerning your life whatever is in the vision will be in the manifestation amen I don't know brother if you can put more of the of the microphone in my ear would be great 1954 brother preaches Faith cometh by hearing what he doing is he's showing us that the source of faith is the word and the foundation of faith is the word and what we preach is the word of faith so we're not preaching our own ideas we're not preaching a denominational idea we are preaching the Vindicated Word of Faith now do you know that God has a provided way to get Faith he has Prov Ed a way to get Faith he has never changed his provided way is his provided way he said is believing God's word now Abraham received faith and the same way that Abraham received Faith the same way that we receive Faith the prophet said if we are God's children by heir HS of the Kingdom we are Heirs of Abraham then we should walk as our Father Abraham walked and we will call things that are not as though they were if God said they were so you're not just calling things you've heard somebody say that those things can be called Lord through the Vindicated message of the hour if God said so then we don't know how it's going to be but God said so so we just believe it we move forward walking by faith see now if you're going to move forward you've got to believe the word you got to receive the word and you got to trust the one who revealed the word to you has the ability to bring it to pass now if a farmer goes out in the field and he sew some wheat in the field he he doesn't he he doesn't go and dig it up every day when he sews it he puts it in the ground and he lets it alone see it's up to God to bring it forth it's up to God to send the rain said it's up to you to accept God on his word and it's to God to bring his word to pass I say this in a challenge of faith that every promise of God will be brought to pass if you take the right midle attitude I don't know if I can get some out of this monitor amen now watch a Vindicated Prophet teaches us he teaches us what faith is and teaches us what Faith's power is in Hebrews 11:1 we know that faith is the substance of things for it's the evidence of Things Not Seen Now by faith the elders obtained a good report and through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God the things which are seen not made of things which do appear now says what is Faith he says is God by the spirit revealing to you something that is going to do his promise faith is God by the spirit revealing to you something he's going to do or he's promised to do he said then you see you hear the word god reveals it to you that it is the truth and by Spirit revealed truth he confirms your faith to God that's the church that's the church that God built upon the rock of come on now that's the church God built upon the rock and the gates of hell can canot Prevail against it Faith's power brings to pass God's revealed Revelation other words the vision God and faith is the Revelation to bring to pass the vision that God had in other words what is in the vision will be in the manifestation exactly what was in the vision will be exactly what is in the manifestation if there was victory in the vision there will be victory in the manifestation if there was Deliverance in the there will be Deliverance in the manifestation if there was healing in the there will be healing in the manifestation if there was if there was power in the v there will be power in the manifestation it shall be even as it was told me now you all know what faith is the prophet said that faith is a revelation from God fath is a revelation from God faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be in other words before there's a manifestation there's a vision oh my and whatever is in the vision will be in the manifestation another place he said it's a revelation he has revealed it to you by his grace it's nothing you did you did not work yourself up in the faith you ever have faith it's given to you by the grace of God and God reveals it to you faith is a revelation Hallelujah faith is a revelation said in an audience of people when you call a prayer line he all good people see there's some of them that's trying hard to believe they're trying to work themselves into it some just can't do it at all see and then there's others just by Grace it's just given to them now there is the difference oh I could preach that for a while we're not here this morning trying to work our way in this message we're not trying to work our way into this Rapture we're not trying to work our way into this Revelation I'm preaching we're trying to not trying to work our way into the power of God but by Grace by Grace we have been brought in to the ration of the word of God the age we're living in it's not rapturing works Grace I tell you this morning you will not work your way in this Rapture you will not pray your way in this Rapture you not your way in this Rapture you will not study your way in this Rapture you will not learn your way in this Rapture if you go in this Rapture you will only by the grace of through the Fai of his word hallelujah bringing to pass the revelation of the will of God in the you're living in we're not defeated people we're not a conquered people in we are Overcomers we are Messiah re of God taken the preeminence in the Liv of Believers we overcome we'll overcome bad days we over bad days trials we're not working our way we heard the vision suceed in our hearts believe the vision and we renounced Satan's Li we renounced Satan's Li and we give our lives to the vision of the word of God the Rapture is a revelation the Rapture is a revelation see it's revealed to her now Faith is something that's been revealed to you like it was to Abraham then the absolute of your life is the revelation of the word of God in the age you're living in now come on church I don't have time to get into it but I'll say it like this if you don't move with a revelation you have to put Martin Luther out come on now Martin Luther according to the Bible he would be smok a but the revelation of the word of God in the age he was living here's what put him in but when sanctification come along you can no longer get by with smoking the p with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you could no longer get by with just sanctification and in the even time even time sh be light there shall be a revelation will St this bride she will rise on the wings of the eagle of the word of God and she will fly above every oh I'm talking about Revelation you know denominations do not believe in spiritual Revelation you know what he said the True Church the true church the universal body of Jesus Christ is buil upon the spiritual Revelation glory to God the true church is built upon the spiritual Revelation now you all know Matthew 16 the Bible said that Jesus came into the coast of cesaria Philippi he walked among his disciples and he said who do men say that I the son of man am now some of them said you're John the Baptist and some said you're Elias and some said Jeremiah one of the prophets but he saith unto them who do you say that I am now there were many disciples out of all the disciples that could have spoke up out of all the disciples that could have spoke up guess who spoke up [Music] there was disciples there that had never done the things Peter had done they had never they had never walked the path that Peter walked but yet when it come time to reveal who he was he chose the disciple that had the most mistakes now come on Church Peter denied go Peter took his sword out and cut man's ear Peter was a cursing preacher but when it come time to announce who this is Peter spoke up and said you're the Christ you are the son of the Living God can I drop something to you can I drop something to you Peter had all kinds of mistakes I can say this on the authority of the word Peter's Revelation was greater than his [Music] mistakes Peter's Revelation was greater than his mistakes some of us are sitting here today and we made a lot of mistakes but you know why we're still here it's because greater is your Revelation greater is your Revelation than your mistakes can I say this you didn't come in by your mistakes so you can't go out by your mistakes your mistakes didn't put you in can't take you out you in Hallelujah the Revelation put you in and the Revelation is going to take you out L and put you in the Rapture what is this rock it's the spiritual revealed Revelation now the prophet of God said it very beautiful he said a Baptist Minister come to me the other day and he said he wanted to straighten me out on the godhead y remember the testimony and he said well when you got time I'll straighten you out said now is a good time as any he said he said now listen he said Mr brandom you're teaching on the godhead is contrary said what do you mean he said well he said now look he said there's three Gods he said now watch there's one God in three persons said now let me ask you this he said what school did you go to he told him a Bible College said I could believe that he said now watch you cannot be a person without being a personality and if you're a personality you are one personality to yourself a separate individual being he said well the theologians can't even explain that and brother Bram said it's by Revelation and he said brother brandom I cannot accept Revelation and I said then there's no way for God to ever get to you because it's hear from the eyes of the wise and prudent but is revealed to babies saying it's revealed Revelation reveal to babies such as we learn such as we accept it now in other words if you close yourself off to Revelation there is no way for God to get to you see the whole Bible is the revelation of God the whole church is built upon the revelation of God there is no other way to know God by Revelation to whom the son will reveal him in the days of the voice of the seventh angel his ministry will be directly connected to Luke 17:30 in the days when the son of man is not learned is not taught is revealed the son of man is the revealing of the almighty God in the present dispensation we're living in now brother says it very beautiful he says Revelation everything is a revelation now not to accept Revelation then you're just a cold Theologian and there's no hope for you God Amen if you cannot accept Revelation you are a cold Theologian and there's no hope for you so brother Brooks you know what that tells me is revelation brings hope Revelation brings hope if you're hopeless if you can accept Revelation revelation

religion you are a part building Jesus Christ in this generation you are a part of the Bride building Jesus Christ can I say this and Satan hates you brother he hates brother Brooks he hates you Satan hates you you know why he hates you because this is not a weak Revelation this is not a man's Revelation this is a prevailing Revelation Hallelujah this is a prevailing a prevailing Revelation the gates of hell not against denomination they're not against the government the gates of hell has already possessed them don't get mad at me the gates of hell it's not against the local church down the

are not in the future it's not coming in the Millennium Christ is here now he's the same yesterday today and forever and Satan hates Revelation because he cannot I said he cannot he cannot Prevail against this Revelation can I say this he will prevail against your feelings he will prevail against your emotions he will prevail against Sensations he will prevail against man's ideas this is a revelation this is a revelation that the devil cannot Prevail over and Satan hates this Revelation oh God we love it Satan hates it we love it true Revelation in our lives we will prevail over the gates of H glory to God I'm not a crazy man I got a revelation and I heard a prophet say when she gets the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for she can she can she can do the Greater Works she oh God will be an invincible Army I don't have time to stay here but I got to go here can I break in that word in what Invincible means too powerful to be de too powerful to be defeated too powerful to be defeated so there will be an Army in the last days that will have a true Revelation and by that true Revelation she will be too powerful to be in other words everything you've been through you're still standing every situation you're still standing every Tri standing problem because there is a revelation in your soul that has moved you it has moved you from being a church member to being an invincible AR can I say this can I say this the devil don't know what to do with the devil cannot stop us the devil cannot defeat us because the Revelation has moved us into a place of invincibility more than anything more than anything May you ask God deposit in your soul a revelation a revelation because what is the Holy Ghost Say When the Holy Ghost comes and reveals the word and makes it just exact then it's a revelation to you you see it it's unfolded it's promised for the hour this Revelation has power to release now the angel came to Mary he was sent directly from God to Mary with a direct message prophet of God said whatever that angel said was bound to be whatever that angel said when Mary believed it when Mary received it when she gave her faith to it when she give her faith to the work of what the angel said then there was a power of infallibility come on Church there was a power of infallibility that was transferred into Mary can I say this it came from God into Mary into her womb and it moved into the fruit of the womb of the product of what she was carrying oh Church Liv God in the last days there will be a return of Oneness to the church and the church age book says that the spirit and the prophet and the bride will all be same same thing the spirit will say it the prophet will say it and the will say it not change it she will not add to it she will not take away from it she will just say it oh God I feel like preaching right now she will just say it and your Prophet said upon the infallibility of the word there's got to come one major voice into this generation and he says it like this I deny upon the scriptures two Major Prophets with a collective Revelation that will together the bride he said there will be one voice it will be the voice of Revelation 10 say this he said then who will have the power ofil who will have the power of infallibility and brother he directly connects that to the messenger of Revelation 10 I'm about to shout up here he directly connects that to the messenger of Revelation 107 and he says these words he says what he says God will back up what he says God will back up he says God will not up can I say this because it wasn't coming from him was coming from God he just needed somebody on the earth to believe what he was saying so there was a seventh angel who was underneath a pillar of fire the pillar of fire was was saying what's coming out what he was saying what's coming out of the pillar of fire I'm not using this I'm using it for example sir so in other words if you're using a microphone the microphone is not here you don't use the microphone here you don't use the microphone here you don't use it here you use it here yes you use it here so here was the voice and there was the [Applause] M but I refuse I refuse to just stop there but what was up there and what was there here it's here it's in you power ability in him into the prophet into you let us rejoice this morning let us rejoice this morning the power inability return to the church we're not speaking our mind we're not speaking our thoughts we're saying exactly has already been and because I believe God because you believe God we have complete confidence I'm about to shout we've got complete confidence that whatever he said is what he huah and here it is today in flesh don't you get mad at me is open the seventh seal is the third the yes sir [Applause] believe is not in a gra Jeffersonville it's in this building right here this morning and in the name Jesus Christ I challenge every I challenge every your hands God Satan there is AEL it's a Prevail is defeated is defeated is defeated Hallelujah somebody some this day day is fed in your [Applause] ears I I believe God I believe and I challenge that devil now in the name of Jesus Christ can I preach who else will have the power of infallibility the power of infallibility we'll have the power [Applause] to call to call his name Jesus can I say this that's an infallible name that's a perfect name that's a name of authority that's a name of power that's a name of the miraculous can I tell you the reason why Satan does not want me to come under that voice and say that name because the same power that moved before when that name was spoken is here in this building and when I say the name every knee has to Bow every conf can I say this there's power in that name to release you from The Binding clo The Binding clo the bonding close that you've been [Applause] wearing there's power in that name now you want me to prove it to you the prophet of God said here not long ago he said I went into I went into a insane institution he said there was a hideous thing he said I went in there to meet that demon he said and I knew this one thing that Christ died to free that man from that demon said that is his word in the message hear his voice he says the word is a Vision so here the prophet of God is walking into an in insane institution yes sir and he says I know the angel of the Lord came to me that night and spoke to me and told me that nothing would stand before my prayer if I would be sincere and get the people to believe he said that stood there and the man was in a straight jacket I'm speaking to you he was in a straight jacket you know what a straight jacket does it binds you up you can't worship God you can't praise God let me say this you have worn the straight jacket your last day you have Warra Jack can I tell you this straight jackets come in many different forms they come in the form of complexes they come in the form of generational curses they come in the form of cycles and it was in this generation hand it down to this generation hand it down to that generation hand it down to that generation and then hand it to your generation but you know what I say it's got to stop somewhere it's got to stop somewhere I said it's got to stop somewh I said it's got to stop can I say this right here right now curse stop and it's destroyed I'm preaching to you now well brother Andrew my father had it my grandfather had it my great-grandfather had it but today by the power of infallibility through the revelation of Christ in you I am giving you a door of hope that you can step you can take a step and you can go beyond curse it's got to stop somewhere I said it's got to stop somewhere can I say here today it stops now here's a man now I know what you're waiting for you're waiting for some powerful point to break it but what if I told you it's already broken by his Str it's already broken yes sir brother said there was that man in the straight jacket he said there was an angel came to Mary he said Mary you will call his name Jesus and she said be it unto me Lord and when John was in his mother's womb she went to she went to Elizabeth and she said I'm going to have a son I'm going to call his name Jesus before he was even born power of infallibility was already accompanying that name and when she said Jesus there was a dead WB there was a dead baby mother's W when the words of the infallible name stru the life of that child and she said Jesus Heap Jo in his mother's wom what are you saying preacher what are you saying I'm saying the name of Jesus brought life to a lifeless baby in a mother's womb brother said the same angel that Mary call his name Jesus the Same Angel me in a cave and said if you get the people to believe in the name of Jesus Christ he'll be free can I say this to you Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus somebody said you shouldn't say that Jesus you say but Andrew why are you holling the name of Jesus because under my messenger I will be the final voice you will be the final Lord to the final age are you hearing me can I say this to you there's a final age there's a final voice there's a final messenger there is got to be a final generation I tell you what the prophet said he said it like this he said they're out there hard in the name Jesus and they're not getting anything you do realize brother said under the opening of those Seven Seals he said the Lord received a new name now come on Church said what was that name he said the name of God he said the word of God interpreted is the manifestation of the name of God then who are you you are the word interpreted so that's making you the direct manifestation of the name of [Music] God can I say this to you can I try to close on this point that God by the revelation has claimed your body God by the Revelation Brooks has claimed your body for its fulfillment in other words you didn't claim this message this message claim claim brother B said there's going to be a Rapture there's going to be a resurrection there's going to be a future home going to be a millennium there's going to be a new Heaven there's going to be a new Earth can I tell you what he said proven his word 64 said only the righteous will be there y right [Applause] amen only the righteous will be there can I say this to you brother Bram interprets that he breaks that down and says the righteous are the ones who are a part of this word in other words you are not just a product Earth father and Earth Mother but you have come from this word into manifestation I'm running out of time but I got to I got to I I got to say this brother BR preaches the seventh seal the revelation of the seventh seal can I say this there's never been a church split the first six seals there's never been an issue over the first six se but there's been more contention around the seven there's been more confusion there been more divisions and more man-made interpretations but let's come back to the voice let's come back to the word and let's say what he said let's say what he said he said the seventh seal will reveal Christ brother BRS the seventh seal will bring Christ back on the earth this is not my interpretation this is not my idea but I challenge you can I can I break the Devil's Backbone challenge you go listen to the message theeven seal in the first six seals the prophet will say he will say here is my Revelation and he will begin to say the white horse rider was the Antichrist the pale horse rider was The Descent the souls on the altar was those but he comes to the seventh SE I'm preaching to you now and says here's my revelation of it and starts talking about his own Ministry so if you're in the syphony if you're in the symphony brother random says the only people who will understand the symphony is those who are interested in it to the rest of them it's just a bunch of noise but to those who are elected to those who are elected they will stop they will stop and they will get in the spirit of the composer Hallelujah they will get the spirit of the composure can I say this said and the director has got to get in the spirit of the composer it's in here and the musicians will get in the spirit of the composer and the director in other words the composer and the director and the musician will be playing the same thing [Applause] the spirit the prophet and the bride will be [Applause] sa can I show you something you didn't claim this message reation of this message claim je brother said the seven seal will be revealed in a threefold manner okay the seventh seal will be revealed in a threefold manner let's leave March of 63 and go to J 63 he Christ is the mystery of God revealed right and he says the first fault is he reveals himself by the revelation of himself he takes the preeminence in a body and by the revelation of yourself having preeminence in the body he will lead that body back to a garden of Le SE is coming the Revelation taking preeminence in the bride and leading her into the Rapture the seven seal the is the rapture it's the coming of the Lord can I say this to you y Arizona 196 the Rapture is a revelation and it starts in first Thessalonians 4 the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a that's a message and the voice of the resurrection and the trumpet the trumpet the threefold revelation of the rapture Hallelujah now yes sir I'm closing on this point when the Revelation strikes your heart that you did not make yourself part of this message you were claimed to be a part of this message when that Revelation strikes your heart you will see that you're just like Mary now can I say this Mary Mary Mary Mary was just a young virgin married to Joseph going about her daily life and one day they come home from church they sit on the front porch to discuss the service says that was a good sermon until until the preacher said he's not still the Jehovah of Miracles brother said she stopped and she said now if he ever was the god of [Music] Miracles he's always the god of Miracles so brother she walks to the whale and brother said I wish I had about an hour on that whale you know why because good things happen at Wales elaser found Rebecca said I wish had an hour on that he said but Mary was just walking and he said the the path she took put her in a specific position when appeared to her and the angel stopped her and the angel said Mary you're highly favored of God can I can I close on this point the Angel's message was a hard message to believe but when that message was spoke that message claimed Mary's womb claimed Mary's wom for it fulfillment can I can I finish on this point the devil is a liar again the devil a li the Devil is a false interpreter of the will of God concerning your life the devil tells you that God is against you the devil tells you that God is hard on you I tell you what the message says God has borrowed come on come on come on your womb for his fulfillment in other words when he came in the earth he came through a borrowed wound he left the a borrowed grave now if somebody ask to borrow something because they don't have it that's right that's right right I want to say this if I ask to B your your iPhone and you look at my iPhone every iPhone I've had cracked broken speakers don't work you're going to be very you're going to be very hesitant to loan me your iPhone but when you know the character of the one who is asking to borrow you will freely give it to them can I can I give you the definition of the word borrow it means to take in you something that belongs to someone else with the intention of returning but also taking in consideration the condition of it when it's returned there will be an agreement [Music] made to repay for the borrowed use in other words God claimed Mary when the message claim Mary changed the whole natural course of her life she went from just a young girl in the town persed ridic hear me but when God got done with Mary he did not throw her away he carried her to the upper room right he carried her room and filled her with the very life of the one she was carry Church of the Living God you have been claimed car this message claim this Revelation you have been claimed this anointing when God gets done with you done with you he's not going to throw you away you're going to [Music] stand you're going to stand in the very fulfillment of what you have carried let us stand our feet this morning you are going to stand Amen to God in the very fulfillment now listen I slow down to say this God is not against you God has borrowed your womb brother B said that he might declare that he's the same yesterday today and [Music] forever this Revelation it is claimed your life the power of infallibility has claimed your life the opening of the word has claimed your body your life for its fulfillment can I I say it to you like this the prophet of God makes it very beautiful he says Mary received the Angel's message and when the angel got done speaking all she could say was these words be it unto [Music] Meen do you realize when Mary said be to me she brought her entire life into submission to the heavenly [Music] vision now can I say this the world will borrow you and the world will use you are you hearing me the world will borrow you the world will use you and when you can offer them nothing else they throw you away young girls give their bodies to the god of Hollywood to the god of fashion and they use them and use them and use them and when they can get nothing else out of them move on to somebody else now don't get mad at me young men but the god of sported men young men's bodies used them broke their backs broke their bones in horrible conditions and when the god of sports gets done with them and move on to somebody [Music] else can I bring it closer the god of false Doctrine the devil has borrowed preachers bodies hardened their Spirits took the love of God out of their lives and made them cold bitter figh theologians no love and used and used and used and used and come down to the end of their life and they've give their life to this false Doctrine and the god of that false Doctrine walks off and goes to another [Music] Hing my God but this Revelation has been spoken over your life can I say this when God borrows something he pays good [Music] interest brother Brooks when God borrows something listen I just F the room so I'm will say it when God borrows a man's body for Ministry the ministry wears the body down sister Ruby it wears the spirit down the Devil comes in and says you give your life and preached and preached and PR and built and and now you're in the lows of lows amen but can I say this brother Brooks your repayment will be when you see all those [Music] Souls God's not going to say to the men of God that's preached the Revelation this word they're going to stand in the very presence of the one that borrowed their life sir church of living God is there a mar among us today is there a Mary can say be it unto me I can prove it to you I can prove to you Jesus PID good interest one time he was trying to go preach the gospel but he didn't have a boat and Peter was a fisherman and Peter had a couple boats there and Jesus said Peter can I borrow your boat yes Lord Peter had to bring his own flesh in submission he needed to be fish catching fish he needed to be fishing catching fish Peter needed to be fishing but when he gave his boat to Jesus Jesus went out and preached the gospel and he looked back at Peter and said Peter let down your net oh my God before Jesus borrowed the boat they were [Music] empty after Jesus borrowed the boat there was not enough room for all the fish Jesus has borrowed your boat can I say this and there ain't room enough for all the blessings am let's bow our hearts together
