TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you know I don't necessarily need the Thunder and the lightning but I do like the rain and you know de Mo need rain amen and I'm looking at this rain and I'm trusting we get our portion this year we've been in a drought for about three years I think it's been and you know and uh kind of like it was in the time of Elijah but when it began to rain it poured amen amen and Revival was on so we just thank God for his grace let us turn to Matthew the 13th chapter and uh I was a boy I played in the rain I walked in the rain I just uh and I'm trusting by the grace of God that the supernatural rain will rain in this place this morning we have been uh there's no way that I can complete this message on this morning but by the grace of God we'll do as the Lord would have us Matthew the 13th chapter I don't know why I flip through my Bible when I know where it's at I'll just go from one page to the next Matthew 13 we're going to begin the 11th verse I'm so glad everybody is really happy and excited this morning amen because one thing for certain we're living I think about this all the time I I look at uh people and almost they're afraid to say I'm blessed but I'm saying to every man you're blessed as long as you living on this Earth and not in Hell amen hello amen you're living on Earth and not in hell because we realize amen things can be a lot worse than what they are amen but I thank God oh Lord every day I really appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ for his mercy and his grace amen I don't deserve it people of God I just you know sometimes I stand in this pull pit Feeling So Unworthy uh to be I mean anything for God uh more or less a leader and I don't say that uh uh lightly I I really mean that from the depths of my heart I'm just a man uh saved by the grace of God whom God in his mind thought it to be so and I appreciate the Lord Jesus uh for that and uh I just want to uh live so God can use it Matthew 131 through the 13th verse please and the disciples came I'm sorry and he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given for whosoever ha have to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he ha therefore speak I to them in Parables because seeing they see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand will would like to entitle our message the power of light or let there be light however you want to uh see it this morning but let us pray Heavenly Father God we come before you right now as humbly as we know how and we thank you for being so good to us we thank you for being better to us than we have been to ourselves and father we realize this morning that that you are the ultimate of all things and before there were anything made that was made Lord you were here and Lord we thank you right now for this understanding that you have given unto us we appreciate you father there are no words that can express our gratitude and Lord we just thank you here this morning bless each and every heart Enlighten our hearts and our souls and father father we will be grateful to you Lord and we'll praise you oh God because you're worthy of all praise in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated we want to read this scripture because the scripture whether you realize it or not is actually dealing with light light is something even though we see it we say I saw the light you are actually a seeing the effect of light because no man can truly see light you see the effects of light and that's why even God said no man have seen me at any time you see except the son he knows me because he knows who he is God even as brother brandham said has always veiled himself and there's a reason why I mean we see what we call the pill of Fire or the pillar of light but we must understand that that is the clothing of God it is in the inside of that light which is is God so we're looking at the scripture here and we find out that um Jesus disciples had asked them why he speaking Parables and uh he said because it's not given to everybody to see or understand now you can look at something with your natural eye and yet not comprehend what it is or even understand it so he's not talking about seeing with your natural eyes he's working with the spiritual and we find out by the grace of God one thing that really struck and stunned me when God opened the scripture to me that he said those who have will be given more abundantly now he's working with seed he's working with seed and those who have seed those who have that in them they will have and they will have more abundant amen now he comes along and he said but those that have not you see because really when you realize and recognize the seed a serpent uh H uh they have gifts and and they're able to do things by faith and and God is saying uh listen but they have not and even those who have not I'm going to take away from them what they've got because what they have is not really theirs and he goes on to say because I have ordained them in a way that they see but see not hearing hear not in other words I've ordained them to be in the position that they're in they cannot comprehend me but it is given to you than you Lord to understand to comprehend who I am now we realize our god let's turn to let's just turn to Jude and I don't want to go too far with this but I want to kind of touch cuz we're going to be dealing with there's a natural light there's a cosmic light and there's Eternal Light hello and uh now Jude when I when I was reading this I thought Lord but but but uh you know the fire that destroy uh those the Lake of Fire is is not it's not Eternal it's Everlasting as brother brandom said and and and here in Jude the 7th verse it says even as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities about them in like manner giving themselves over to fornication and going after the strange flesh or set forth for an example suffering the Vengeance of Eternal fire now you know I was thinking many times when I read the scripture suffering the Vengeance of Eternal fire as if it was something separate from God but you see God is the Eternal fire amen basically he could have said suffering the Vengeance of God or suffering the Vengeance of the Lord Jesus Christ right and and when I began to see that I thought well Lord is that right yes because the Bible according to Hebrews 12:29 said God my God or God is a consuming fire they don't burn amen eternally but they they do they are destroyed Amen in an ET Everlasting fire or time period rather so when God began to uh give me understanding and and listen to this now I want you to understand that God is identified with fire and light amen right because wherever there is a fire there's light and wherever there's light there's a fire so we realize by the grace of God Amen that light and fire goes together now we sing that song I Saw The Light No More darkness no more night that's a beautiful song but you see there are so many people amen who sing that song who have never seen the light spiritual light is something that opens the mind to seeing spiritual things that are not visible to the Natural Eye we might call it faith faith is something that as the scripture calls it Abraham called those things that be not as though they were spiritual amen sight God promised me I believe the promise so it is a reality to me even though you don't see it with your natural eye you know it's yours Heaven belongs to me amen hello amen amen I've never seen it as with my natural eye but Heaven is re reality to me because I see it spiritually in other in other words I understand it now we realize by the grace of God even in the Bible according to St John 1 it says basically it talks about4 about Jesus Christ Not only was he the life but he was the light of men amen and in that word word work when light is working understanding as youve heard me say he is the understanding of what a man is supposed to be a God man Jesus was 100% plus right he was God man as brother bam said he left a a being he was all space and time and whatever you want to say however you want but you got to realize nothing only exists in time and space people say well God made something out of nothing only because you couldn't see it but something always existed and that was God Amen yes sir see so nothing is something that we're working with only in this feel taste smell see sound whatever you know I mean the natural senses so when we realize a man that we are living in a spiritual world Amen now there those that are born again must be spiritual now God and I'm almost jumping in a way but let me I I'll say it again that's why in the beginning when there was Darkness and Light amen uh basically mingling together God separated it the Bible said he divided light from the darkness and I'm going to give back to that in just a moment usually we don't see light we see we see with it right if there was the absence of light here you couldn't see even though you got eyes it is the light that causes you to see right y y'all hear what I'm saying and I want you to understand that we are creatures of light oh I love this and I'm almost ready to shout already because we came from I'm working with this eternal light we were light in the beginning oh God creatures of light and if he is light and give birth he must give birth to what light amen one of the first thing he said let there be lighten because he was showing by the grace of God is that light was always amen not this natural stuff a light that is Supernatural even in science I said it said light is used for everything from laser to eye surgery now that's the manipulation of light to telephone technology the potential military application of light are straight out of the science fiction and y'all know that's the truth even science recognize the power of light come on somebody I know some of y'all have seen uh Star Trek and when they say Be Me Up Scotty what comes down light and that light amen transformed that individual what what happens that individual becomes part of that light and he travels with that light and then they able to operate that life so much so to that that individual can come back to the natural form oh sound like a Rapture to me now we look at this thing and we must understand this is why it's so important that you and I separate ourselves from all Darkness amen if you are children of light you are the Conqueror amen of all Darkness amen y'all hear me now and within a decade light listen I love this when I when I read this it said within a decade light may be the preferred weapon for zapping hostile missiles out of the sky come on somebody light has always been the weapon they science just catching up with it but it was light amen that destroyed Lucifer come on I want you to understand let me back it up here because I want you to realize Amen in the beginning there was only one thought and that thought consisted of many thoughts and many thoughts the many thoughts from that thought was only thought by God am Lucifer was the first of all God's creation that thought differently from God y'all hear what I'm saying that's why when it comes to this message we don't have a thought coming our thoughts must lined up with his thought oh come on somebody otherwise we find ourselves thinking outside of God's thoughts which got Lucifer in trouble this is what science says light can even become the preeminent power source for long distance space travel I'm excited cuz light is the power for space travel the spaceship will have an ultra thin sail to catch the wind of light being from an etern earth based laser in theory such a craft could accelerate into a sizable fraction of the speed of light without carrying fuel oh my God come on somebody you said what do you mean what does that have to do with me this is what's happening God was so change us amen hallu that we'll change we'll travel faster than light why because we are light amen light is the only thing that can travel through that wall without interfering with the wall That's why Jesus was able to walk through the oh wall my amen oh my look at the more you look at the topic the more you realize that our lives are built around light without light we could not even exist take away the Sun and we're dead hello not just us all botney life must animal life everything that you say lives must have light without the light amen there is no photosynthesis now come on somebody light and I I've I've discovered this myself by just reading and I find out amen that our whole system this whole world system actually have a a a a system that protects this world in other words it when something from space or wherever comes in that's not supposed to come amen storm clouds come a battle come a fight come Amen to destroy amen every and everything that would literally pervert this world Amen and try to balance it back out just like your body what happens amen when some germ comes into your body that's not supposed to go what happened your body turns up the temperature the fire burns hotter and the purpose for that is to kill off the germ come on somebody I mean god is perfect in all things and if you get an eternal fire this eternal fire is able to kill death itself hallelujah amen I'm trying to slow it down because I want you to realize amen that this thing goes into a place as I said scripturally we are I could have said we are just we're light and actually you know uh this light is to illuminate let's work with the spiritual now this light is to illuminate our minds it is to Enlighten our minds it is it is our guidance it is our inspiration they that are led by the spirit of God truly they are the sons of God now we realize amen that when God said in in the in Genesis he said let there be light first of all let me let me let me put it this way the Bible tells us that Jesus Christ is the beginning of God's creation Now I want you to understand what he did Brother B talks about it how he was just Elohim self-existing one and then he basically came down and became the L ghost and and from the L ghost amen he he moved himself into what we call Cosmic light and you understand what Cosmic light is it's your body with petroleum and all the other elements yeah I can read a quote in just a moment but the point is you are light but you are a different kind of light until the Holy Ghost comes now we see in Genesis he said let there be light right and the Bible said there was light and the light was good right and so he separated let's go there first Genesis 1 now like I said I'm just trying to lay a foundation here this morning and by the grace of God we'll try to finish it out whenever the Lord will will end it but my point is and you'll see down the road is that it is important that light and darkness be separated if God sep separated it in the beginning it must be separated in the end right Genesis 1:3 that's why the Bible said you cannot be lovers of the world and lovers of God too God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness is that all right and then he named the light he named The Darkness the Bible said and then he called the light day and he called The Darkness night amen hallelujah and I think it's in Peter with says now you're not Children of the Night amen you're Children of the day you're Children of the light in other words you are created by light you are The Offspring of light amen you are light so much so just as our father he is light in one place he call he's called the unapproachable light is that all right and we realize by the grace of God Amen when we see God Amen in his Beauty it should always excit us because this message is to give us ident identification remember now we're talking about the Rapture is that all right and brother brandham says it like this he said he talks about the UFOs he said one day the the those lights that you see they'll pick you up ah come on somebody one of these old days the same lights that been appearing all over the world the same light that's above the prophet's head he said that light he said that light one of these old days will pick you up now I don't know about you but I'm ready for it now we look at this thing and we say well brother Brooks where are you working with I'm I'm I'm working with the supernatural I'm trying to get to the supernatural light here but I I I want to say by the grace of God Amen that we are looking at a time amen where there's lot there's only a few people that actually have sight even this message people don't know who they're supposed to be oh come on somebody amen they don't have even though the messages come to bring them an identification they can't seem to separate themselves from the darkness hello and I want you to understand Darkness just doesn't back off Darkness must be conquered y'all hear what I'm saying Darkness must be conquered why because in tight it is the battle that started in heaven where Lucifer amen by his perversion brought in darkness there was no darkness in heaven everything was light oh y'all act like y'all don't want to believe that the Holy Ghost in you ought to wait say Amen to that why because the Bible said in him Christ Jesus God there is no Darkness at all amen so Darkness even came by the rebellion of Lucifer amen and God in his creation working with Redemption allowed Darkness to come oh my God as a contrast so that you can see there's a difference between the light thoughts and the Darkness thoughts amen so oh we're looking at uh the word of God in a way that the world can't see they couldn't see him right they couldn't see him even though they saw him some said this is bebel say hey some say no no no no this guy he he's born of fornication you know they all had their their their their revelation of who he was and then you took a prostitute by by the uh uh well there in Samaria who said we know that when the Messiah should come he should tell us all these things now anybody in their right mind let me tell you something you you know this is what gets me and I'm going to take it like this people I'm going take as long as God lead me this way this is the way I'm going because I I want you to get what I'm saying you take you take people and and and they these theologians who saw Jesus in so many ways and then here was a prostitute why cuz she had her seed yes sir amen she had What it Took and what God was looking for and then she was given abundance we know when the Messiah should come he should tell us all these things now this is what I want to say people arguing about the crowd and the hunting and the crazy stuff in this message they don't see they can't see they never met him there's no way you going to meet God and be concerned about such silly things amen so Jesus ate the corn am amen is that all right he went shopping amen if I could say it like this on a Sabbath day eating corn out of a field which was unlawful why to man kind but to God that was his corn amen God can eat his corn when he want to and there was a law that you could actually go eat corn as long as you don't pack your bags so he wasn't off the word but you see when you when you if you take a Critic and and and if they want to find something they're going to find something hello somebody now let me move on by the grace of God because we're working with a supernatural light right let me let me let me let me move on uh let's turn to St I mean first John please I hope you're being blessed this morning because people if you don't see you know we we think oh I know I'm light but huh is a different thing like brother bham say he said I'm not talking about I'm not talking about this this little this little blessing y'all talking about being in the presence of God I'm talking about in the presence of God he said all these things we're feeling he said that's just His blessings right he said but when you in the presence of God there ain't no jumping there ain't no shouting you know you feel like a dead man fear of the Holy One is is is is so overwhelming he always had to say fear not how many of us been there y'all hear what I'm saying okay 1 John 1 please is that all right 1 John 1 5-7 he said this then is the message which we have heard of him and declared unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all here it is if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in light as he is in the light in other words if you're walking in the revelation of your day we have Fellowship one with another oh he didn't say fellowship with him he said one with another because when you fellowshipping one with another in the light you are fellowshipping with him amen why we the body of Christ and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all our sin y'all hear what I'm saying and let me tell you something your Cosmic body is death your Cosmic body amen is is is sin oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you say that's beauti body yes I'm telling you seeing is beautiful so we realize amen the Bible said cleanses you from all sin what is he what what is he cleansing you from not in your not in your flesh your flesh is already condemned it is Darkness you can't see God by your flesh it is a holy spirit that reflects itself through your flesh that men yes the light of God is that right this is the message God is light oh I'm telling you you're not getting it I know it I can tell it I can tell it it ain't something deep it's just simple God is light if God is light that means I stay away from all Darkness just a simple as that if he's light and I'm light then I have no fellowship with Darkness amen understand by the grace of God it is the supernatural light that created the natural light right oh it's true the beginning of of the temporal this this natural light was just the beginning of the temporal and material world and put it this way because remember in Revelation the Bible tell tell us that we won't have need of the Natural Light sun it's temporal we won't have need of it he said because the lamb is the light and he will lighten the city Hallelujah come on somebody it's just a lamb you thinking just Jesus only but you better realize it'll be the bride Hallelujah with him because she sets in his throne and the Bible says she comes down with the glory of God the light of God is radiating through her oh my my my my my we have a white rment that are glisten come on somebody amen like brother brand said God light don't shine it glows my ask Moses about it he met the pill fire on top of the mountain come on somebody and when he come down amen they said they couldn't even look at his face amen cuz the glory of God was shining H I Can't Hardly Wait Hallelujah to God takes over this thing amen and I become him and he becomes me amen I'm in him and he's in me Hallelujah that's where we're headed created being created Created into him growing up into him the light of God woo woo now we realize because God is and as I said earlier nothing only existed in the natural it is the only uh uh only that in this which we can uh see tast and that that's what nothing is I used to get confused with that God created the world out of nothing I was how can he create something out of nothing when he was always here but I was getting two things mixed up two Rams mixed up Hallelujah is that right now I I know I listen what he says in Hebrews 11 1-3 I got it here it says now Faith is the substance of things hold for the evidence things are not seen for by it the elders obtain a good report through faith we understand that the worlds not world the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which do which are seen were not made of things which do appear in other words I mean we're talking about different Realms is that right in other words we we see the the natural thing but there's a spiritual thing that created it yes sir and and the thing that created it don't look like the thing that that it appeared in other words word created it amen word Spirit word created it and it materialized see so so that's the thing that's the only thing that M does that makes Satan in a place or put Satan in a place where he can't be God because he has he doesn't have the ability to create see but God put you in a place where you could create hallelujah amen hallelujah Now 1 + 1 equals two if you can create and Satan can't then who is God which of you am between the two has more Authority and power oh Lord see he might be able to pervert but you can speak a word and because he is darkened he has to flee the Bible said if you resist the devil he will flee from you oh glory to God I I tell you what teaching is hard for me cuz I like to jump but I'm trying to keep my posure here composure you love the Lord now let me get something out here in in the message by faith brother R said the world was not made the world was made by faith things were shaped in existence by faith God just seen the DW drop hanging out there in the air that whatever you want to call it and he just spake and said let there be light and there was light and when he brought the land forth and dried it off and so forth that was all done by an Act of Faith with God the whole world is made by faith amen hello and faith is the ability to see into the spiritual realm oh my and call those things that be not or can't be seen in this world as though they were because they are amen amen they really are but they can't be seen here yet amen am brother brandom says Amen in the message witness and when you get Faith in Jesus Christ working in a perpetual motion in your soul woo now that word Perpetual shook it shakes a perpetual motion in your soul something's going to take place sin and sickness will get away from you Devils will scatter like Roaches on the floor in the summertime am I like that maybe some of y'all I've never seen that but I have amen amen but roaches done got more Bolder nowadays but anyhow let's move on when we are we see by the grace of God Amen how this light is so powerful how many times you thought well I I can see my way I can go in through this room and even though it's dark and you're bumping up into everything and you think uh why didn't I turn the light on right is how we do it amen because we think that we can make it through this world without having the light turn on as long as your light is not turned on you're going to bump up into the things and some things will cause you to trip and fallen and the light I'm talking about keeping on is Jesus Christ himself is that all right now in the message of angel of of God he says listen I heard something and brother bandam talks about it and I'm thinking now oh my God this the scientists are catching up because they talk about traveling in the light said one day light we'll be able to travel by light but I want you to understand that's how Angels travel huh let me give you an example brother B said I heard something first I saw a light and I thought it was an automobile that turned the corner but it turned but it got brighter and I looked out the door and while and there was no automobile then I heard something coming like this walking and I looked and the light got greater and I just about me uh H H and just above me hung a great star and the light was kind of a more of a green and yellowish shining on the floor and come walking through the light came a man woo that looked like as I said before would have had been 200 lb a huge man he did not have a beard over his faith like Christ picture does who uh who he is I do not know but he had shoulders he was more of an olive complexion he had had dark eyes he walked as close to me as this microphone is H now he's showing by the grace of God Amen this Angel traveled by light he saw the light Hallelujah and if you and I going to travel you're going to travel by light oh I believe that amen that's why he said look up because your Redemption draw nigh Hallelujah who traveled by light to find the Messiah Hallelujah there was a star Hallelujah and there were three wise men who traveled by that light wherever the light would go that's the way in the direction they would follow now I'm coming to something here in just a moment I'm trying to hold it back you know what I'm saying I'm really I'm so enjoying this I don't know whether yall are but I am now when we look at this thing you and I must know by the grace of God God had to bring the law of contrast in order for us to see we showed by the grace of God that the word of God said in Psalms 33:6 by Thy Word by the word of the Lord were the heavens made and all the host of them by the breath of his nostril is that all right now I want you to understand by the grace of God that everything was made if he was the first born of All Creatures there was no seraphim there was no cherubim there was not even a host there was nothing of All Creatures he was the first come on come on think about it if the Bible the Bible said he was the first of our first born of All Creatures there was nothing before him God himself condescended Amen to bring a creation but you see that's why you he can't be second he can't be third he can't be fourth he has to be number one God must be first in your life because he he was first creation he was the creator he was first must be number one amen am I making sense that's why he said you must love the Lord God better than you love yourself with all of your heart with all of your mind with all of your soul amen oh my my my my turn with me now to Romans 9 I know I'm moving slow this morning but I have to Romans 9:20 now you and I ought to be so grateful because we understand this messag we're understanding it it just seem to unfold and unfold and unfold and unfold amen but think about it amen that that one of these old days that same light in you that you can't see we call it quickening power we call it Jesus Christ understand the Bible says it is light how how many of y'all know that light is in you how many of you know you got fire on the inside hallelujah oh yeah when the Holy Ghost come it shall baptize you with fire Holy Ghost and Fire on the day of Pentecost the Bible said those lick of fire appeared above their heads but that same lick that was above their head was in their soul amen is that right right the candles Li sticks could go out they could the fire outside on the outside where their sacrifice could go out but that light on the inside that fire that was in the kind of Glory Not only was it consuming but it was giving life it transformed a rod changed it amen to a bing limb that brought forth Almond's fruit that's same life right now on the inside of you is changing you from that Old Wicked nature that you used to have thank you Lord right so that you can bring forth Hallelujah the very fruits of God Romans n beginning at the 20th verse is but n oh man who art thou that thy rep is against God shall the things formed say to him that formed it why hast Thou made me thus how many times we've done that oh not what I verly you know you anybody with common sense ain't going to shout or speak evil of some people well I'm angry with God stay away from me see I don't even understand that concept being angry with God that's almost like a little roach or Little Ant screaming up to me says you know I'm angry with you huhuh huh but my point is this God covered his grounds so what if you were so messed up in life wh what if you had every you've done everything in the world everything that God told you not to do and yet he gives you Grace what would you be would you rather be a Pharisee who really thinks he's got it all together who's lived by the law like Paul said I'm blameless there's no reason why I shouldn't go to heaven cuz I've done everything he said do give me Grace amen give me the grace of God as a faulty man I'll take his grace the Bible said there is none righteous no not one so no matter how well we we we fix ourselves to be there is no way by the grace of God that you are you could ever marit heaven if it wasn't for the seed of God in you what you have would be taken from you that's it that's it amen so let's move on by the grace of God he says listen who's going to reply against God shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why has Thou made me thus have not the PO of power over the clay of the same L to make one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor I'm so glad God didn't make me Pharaoh I'm so glad that he didn't put me in the lineage of the popes yes come on I'm so thankful amen that he didn't allow me to be Judas oh y'all come on somebody or a can what about us sister Jezebel we all bore the nature of the of this world but God changed us transformed us translated us into the kingdom of God Amen and that's what he says listen the Kingdom of Heaven and the kingdom of God the kingdom of God includes everything the Kingdom of Heaven includes Heaven blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord and the people that whom he have chosen for his own inheritance woo can I shed some light on this that's the scripture I'm reading you the scripture and God is saying you're blessed because you are my inheritance that's the light of the word it understanding amen that I am an inheritor of God Amen inheritance of God oh I'm going to get to some oh Lord Psalm 271 and what I'm talking about a supernatural light I'm talking about the Holy Spirit I'm talking about God and you know we look at the Holy Ghost is something or something and we fail to see how powerful the Holy Ghost is right we see we fail to see amen what does Holy Ghost is and that it's not just something that's just ordinary it's extraordinary because it is God hallelujah you got to realize amen that what we talk about when we talk about God we we're talking about the Creator and that's what our little Minds allow us to forget sometime the creator of all things you know I G given this illustration long time ago how often time we say we got so many problems and we fail to see that God can solve them right amen and we think about oh my God you know he's too busy how can he be too busy he's still hold in the universe everything that you can see God still is in control of iten right the prophet of God said he can and the word of God tells us that he even knows the numbers of hairs on your head he knows amen every time the flee blasts his eye now he he's so under control he knows everything and my point is how come you feel like he doesn't know what you're going through he does he ordained it the footsteps of a righteous man are ordered by the lord well God I fail today do you think God was surprised oh God I I didn't I didn't mean to do it he know that why you tell him that but he loves to see repentance amen God loves that Hallelujah God loves to see repentance he even given a parable he said what if a father and I'm just paraphrasing this Parable says would tell his sons he said go do this and one voluntarily said yes I'll go do it he said then the other one says no dad I'm not going to do it he said but the one who says I'm not going to do it repents and the one who says I'm going to do it don't he just don't he he just doesn't get to do it now he said which one of them did my will the one that says oh I'll go do it and didn't do it or the one who said I W won't do it and went to do it that's not hard many times amen we fail God but weent we repent and then we go do the thing that we said at one point we weren't going to do am I was telling the the young people in Sunday school this morning you know I I tell you what I I used to be afraid of the Holy Ghost hello cuz I didn't understand it and in the Pentecostal they jump and shout and jerk and scream and many times I thought they were in pain not knowing and understanding it but I told him I said once you get it oh my God you wish you had gotten there before then see it just it's it's something of another world Hallelujah come on somebody it's true amen did I finish reading what I was reading yeah what if God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endureed with much longsuffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction and that he might make known The Riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy which he have a for prepared unto Glory this wasn't something that God decided to do just now before the foundation of the world this is light I'm working with light I'm working with light in your soul and if you could take it anden you'll find an illumination going on you'll find something happening on the inside of your soul when you recognize that you just didn't happen to be here sometime we think and I've seen people carry on as if they had something to do with their salvation because of this idea you didn't do nothing you didn't even seek God it was God who sought you you Hallelujah so where is the self-righteous thing come in I I don't know it's only because people are ignorant to what light is and what the whole Plan of Salvation is all about Hallelujah is that all right the Bible said according to Psalm 271 the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear wait a minute I'mma read that again the Lord is my light in other words he's my understanding he's my Revelation he's my God he's my healer he's my deliverer he's my everything I if I'm in the light I can see all that he is my salvation Whom Shall I Fear not when God right with me he said I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you that's the light of God that's a revelation of what his promised well Whom Shall I Fear Shall I Fear the boss man policeman president Pope Council of churches oh come on somebody Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is what the strength of my life without him I have no strength he is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid you don't think light has power the Bible said amen that when the light shine on Saul he fell fell from his Hearts hallelujah amen and when he fell from his Hearts guess what the light was so powerful it blinded him light hello who art thou Lord I am Jesus see listen when you really come into the light you really understand what you have but the problem is there so many of us don't know what we got oh I got the Holy Ghost but what is it who is it what does that mean hallelujah it's more than enough Amen to for the holy GH oh I I got the Holy Ghost because I come to church I got the Holy Ghost because I sing gospel songs I got the Holy Ghost what what does that mean to you it means amen if I've got the holy ghost in my soul that means I am him and he is me amen we're won that's why Paul wasn't afraid of death he knew where the light was he was a dwelling in the light he was abiding in the light Hallelujah and because of that he knew he could never die because death had no power over light as Darkness has no power over light but is a bad thing when you think you're in light and you're in darkness the church world all have no idea they're in darkness they think they're walking in the light see that's how we ought to be so appreciative of what God has given to us tell you what if any of us miss it it won't be God's fault hallelujah our attitudes is the reason why God answers and when he doesn't attitude toward the word come on somebody there Nothing But The Truth Listen that was Old Testament was David was saying this thing amen and what he wasn't you know uh like we are it was God with us but now is God in us amen hallelujah Psalms 119 105 says the word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my pathway in other words I get my direction my way of walking my way of talking my way of living by the word of God it is my light it is How I Live it is why I live it is the reason I live amen 119 and 130 says the entrance of the thy words giveth light it giveth understanding to the simple confusion will have no place in your life if you relied on the word huh because the word is light is that all right I don't know how long I've been gone but I'm I'm I just want to I want to I'm I'm sharing this because understand what the Bible says not the World At Large think they really have the gospel but they got another Jesus and the Bible says according to 2 Corinthians 4: 3-4 it says but if our gospel be hid it is hi to them that are lost in whom the god of this world have blinded their minds because of their minds they cannot see even though they looking right at it they see you they see us they see it but they can't see because their minds are blind their minds are darkened of them which believe not lest the light of the Gospel the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them in other words God purposed it God purposely blinded them for your sakes is that all right he purposely blind them and you know what we look at things like I I don't know I don't know what it is that we we can't seem to love him like we ought to but when you realize amen that God purposely blind like this Gentile age like he did the Jews for you it ought to do something and you and I who was in here worthy of this message you deserve it do you I mean come on now were you living so righteously out there in that in that in that denominational church out there or out there in the world that God says oh you deserve this come on in you didn't stop for God God stopped you and when you and I realize amen the light of this thing what is God trying to do produce a Love in Your Heart toward him even towards yourself because many of us are sometime disgusted with ourselves but it's not yourself that you're disgusted with you're disgusted with your Cosmos and that's not you amen amen because your Cosmos is perverted and your soul is converted amen see what I'm saying it's your Cosmos that you're upset with but God fixed that for you he condemned it I'm so glad that he's so condemned that we won't carry it with us all this sin and unbelief that's in this old flesh this old enemy of mine amen it will be down it will be destroyed Hallelujah and when the fire of God finish we'll be pure is that all right now we look at this thing he says if it be here is here to them that are lost and and and and and I'm going to say something to you because a lot of us don't realize this the Bible says according to Psalm 27:1 except the Lord build a house they labor in vain that building now I want you to understand there are denominational people who could put us to shame with the way they live but they're living it by law they living it by human effort believing it's the Holy Ghost oh oh yes and they can outlive us morally probably more clean in appearance oh come on and you don't have to say Amen but but it's true anyhow but you see it ain't it they're building the house they're the ones who are trying by human effort psychology whatever it is and they're looking pretty good is that right I I I don't have that quote with me but brother say you can pay your ti go to church you can do everything a Christian could do and he said can you still be lost as far as the East is from the West it ain't about your ability here it's about God Amen and his whole purpose now I love this because he said I have lost none so why should I be up said oh I'm going to be lost I'm going to lie I'm going to die oh no the light is I cannot be lost the light of the revelation of this message is the rapture can't take place except it go with me I go with it I'm part of this whole thing yes sir oh my people I I I just it was hard to except the Lord keep the city The Watchman waketh in vain now you go to Second Peter and you don't have to turn there first 2 Peter 1 3-10 and it tell add to your faith virtue knowledge Temperance y'all done heard the statute of a perfect man is that right what did Brother brandham say in that now if you've been like me if you were like me when I first heard that message I was trying to add you know oh I can't do this I can't do this and I shouldn't do this and you know just trying to keep myself from and that will run you plum crazy hello y'all hear what I'm saying but then one day I heard that message and you know what the prophet of God said you don't add to it it will add to you and I got to shout hallelujah amen I began to praise God because I realized when the storms come that's the rain I need to make me grow when the Sunshine it is the Sun that I need to make me grow when the lightning strike one of my limbs and turn me or cuts it off I realize that God is pring me Amen to make me bear more fruit come on somebody and when you see those things amen amen it gives you Joy to know that God is working on your behalf no matter what it looks like Hallelujah yeah he God Amen you know brother BR talk about transform and deform he said he said there's some some weeds that actually grows around and connects and pull a real fruit tree into a place or position it ain't supposed to grow but he said it's still a fruit tree oh Lord ain't God good to us I'm trying to get where I want to go I'm trying to get there how much time I got amen so let's look at this and and I'm saying that because I know my brothers and them got to go back to iow will say I don't want to keep them too long we look at this thing you and I must realize amen that the the Bible says for thus hath the Lord said unto me go set a Watchmen let him declare what he see now a Watchman nowadays would be a preacher right the prophet of God is going off the scene and we know what he was not only was he the evening light but God used him to reflect the evening life but God also used him as a day star hello God used him in other words the day star was reflecting in him why would you say that and I'm jumping here just to throw something out at you brother brandham kept saying the scientists say it's 3 Minutes to Midnight why would the evening light messenger tell you it's three minutes to midnight he was telling you the season was changing now amen the day star is shining I'm haing to this generation who are in this total darkness that the sun is about to shine hallelujah amen so now he's haing the coming of the son is that right he preached the message it is the rising of the sun now you must realize the sun don't rise without a battle Hallelujah and then the prophet preached a message on the wings of a snow white dove oh my God and he said though the dove was wounded it made it home in other words it got the message over and because the message is over the children of God will catch it and that same D that same me would make sure they get it home amen now you got to realize amen that if three minutes to midnight was before he died or went off the scene you got to realize now it's about the breaking of dawn yes siru and if it's a breaking of dawn there is the greatest battle ever fought amen amen hallelujah and that greatest battle that ever fought is when the darkness began to press itself against the light come on and what are you feeling in your mind right now Darkness amen pressing you on a daily basis trying to do what defeat you it cannot defeat you because you're the light is that right Jesus said ye are the lights of the world there was a time he said I am the light and as long as I'm in this world I am the light and guess what he says we must work while it's day because when the night cometh no man can work and brother Bram said at that time when no man can work he he says they will refuse or they will kill you even if you go to pray for someone he's telling us amen these dark Forces are gathering themselves against who the Lord and his Christ Hallelujah but what they fail to see is that the law of light will never be defeated can never be defeated because it is God the Watchman says the burden of Duma I look up that word Duma and it meant like uh silence or Edom or it was actually came from the word Esau the burden of Duma he calleth out to me out of Sea Air Watchman what are the night Watchman what of the night now what at what point in time this is night this is the age of Darkness this is the God Satan is the God of this evil age which mean he is the darkness that's overshadowing everything except the bride right he's got the church World brother bam showed us that through the vision he's got the church world but right now we are are in a battle and it is light against Darkness amen come on somebody but there is coming a break of day oh Lord have mercy think about it Joshua said Son stand still that I might defeat my enemy come on Amen and when when there was a break of day you and I must realize amen that the Bible tells us that Jacob wrestled with the angel all night amen and there was coming a break a day and the angel said let me go J says not so till you bless me hallelujah hallelujah and that's how the Bride of Jesus Christ is right now I'm not going to let you go amen until you bless me you got to change me amen hallelujah and realize amen before Jericho NE I mean the Israel never marched around Jericho at night brother B said at night that's when all demons come out he said but at the daytime that's when they rest come on somebody amen and the Bible said at the break of day every day J uh they would March around why because they're creatures of light Hallelujah that's it's the truth amen a true Son of God and daughter of God ain't got no business wandering themselves around at night you're not creatures of night you're creatures of the day and if you out there in the night at all kinds of hour you're looking for Darkness sir is that the truth hallelujah understand Jesus conquered death Hell In The Grave Hallelujah during a dark time you say yes it was the Bible said the son refus to shine Hallelujah the moon wouldn't give it light Hallelujah it was a dark time but what they failed to see at that coming together of all those demons to hold him in the grave the Bible said which is light he said my word is light my word is revelation he cannot stay there because I have spoken it I will not let his by see seek corruption he'll not seek corruption neither will I leave his soul in hell that was a revelation Hallelujah that's a revelation amen is that all right now you and I must understand what light is is when you can see can you see yourself being in this place of justification as though you never sin in the first place then why are you beating yourself up that's the revelation of this day sir the bride never sin in the first place amen woo see I can see I can see it on your faces for all of us amen it's hard is't it it's hard but you just got to say Lord give me that true revelation of that thing it'll bring joy to your soul amen when you recognize it ain't what I do for him it's what he's done for me that's my Covenant Hallelujah that's my understanding of this message amen that I am justified as though I've never sin in the first place now you got to realize a True Believer ain't going to just go out there and sin and say well you know I'm gonna get away with it anyhow no a True Believer does all he can do not to see Hallelujah the Sun the sunlight as our brother uh I'm going to close in here just yeah as our brother uh um Doug they could preach he said you must claim you must force your claim you got to force this thing you can't just say oh Satan just just let me have it please you got to take it why you think Satan had had all this ter that territory all your all this time and he's just going to easily walk away from it no you got to fight that devil but you don't fight him on your with your own human strength you got to learn how to take control by the words of your mouth amen the Bible says in your mouth is life and death Hallelujah and your mouth speaks whatever it is and you got to learn how to allow your mouth to speak life and not death Hallelujah I'm not cursed amen I'm blessed BL Hallelujah I'm not going to feel sorry for myself because I'm in the presence of God and in the presence of God there's fullness of joy you can you can speak yourself into happiness sir amen is that that right the Bible said that David encouraged himself in the law Jesus Jesus I don't know I now we look at this thing and I'm I'm trying to close just just a moment just give me one more moment because I want you to realize God even showed it he showed it that when Egypt was in Blackness when Egypt was in such a dark place amen there was still light and go Hallelujah I don't care how dark the world is because I am a recipient of his light I'm in the light I'm walking in the light there's light in goam you got to realize amen if there is no other light is in me yes sir amen I know the truth the truth know me Hallelujah come on somebody I was telling somebody the other day yesterday I think it was I said brother brandham was living right now he'd die he couldn't take it he could not take the filth y'all hear what I'm saying what he saw in his day was wicked to him can you imagine what he would be going through he really would be out in the mountain somewhere now I want you to understand that that wasn't brother Brandon's feeling about things that was the god in him oh Lord almost intolerable of the things he saw in that day what is he thinking now what on Earth is he thinking now we a mature audience I was at a store where I don't care Walgreen or wherever I was and and all of a sudden my eyes hit the Sports Illustrated and it was just it was you know how they put them all by the counter they used to have them in the back now they put them up there with the canyon all that and and I didn't lust no no no I was bars in Noble I was trying to get a a a book it's called Starts with Food anyway but nevertheless they had these women and I wasn't lusting God allowed me to see it was just for a moment but I put it this way they were wearing fig leaves the little what all they call it that brother Brown say Kini beini they were leaves they literally were shaped like leaves and I thought if I had a mature audience I would bring it I thought but no I don't want to touch that you know because that thing has Spirits y'all hear what I'm saying my point is by the grace of God people we are living in a day how can people reject this message when few years ago that kind of a thing would have been unheard of and I remember those kind of books and things were consider pornography now they're right there on the shelves people we're here yes sir we're here am the Rapture can take place at any time hallelujah amen and you don't think these blood moves mean something you know God got scientists working on our behalf yes sir it's the truth brother B talks about the car uh the astronauts when they landed on the moon and all these kind of things and you know how that typed out the church and everything else and then people say well they didn't go to the Moon well according to the prophet of God they did cuz it was a type of the Bride Hallelujah but one day we'll go to a world amen amen that won't be just rocks oh I've got some more stuff but I I tell you what I we'll just finish it this evening it's just I don't know whether I just pray God that give you understanding give us all more of understanding that if we are children of the light and we're going to travel by light light and if there's no darkness in him he cannot pick up Darkness that's one of the reasons why your body will be changed no flesh and blood will enter in there that's right amen and you have to be changed your Cosmos everything about you must be changed in order or suitable for the light that will transport you creatures of light all right creatures of light the transformation and you see what brother how can it be let me put it this way in closing on this part the Bible tells us that Jesus Took Peter James and John up on the mountain that we call Mount Transfiguration now there was no man on earth that could have been they say according to English no such thing but I like saying it more perfect than Jesus Christ himself and here he was born of a body without sin there was no sinful element in Jesus now the only thing I I I say it like this is that I don't understand that how Jesus himself could have aged but he did in his flesh but even so he did not have to die to be glorified H he stepped out of prayer or whatever he was going through there and when they woke when they awaken they saw him two who had already gone on Moses and Elijah and Jesus standing up there just as glorified or more glorified than Moses and Elijah the light was bright as the Noonday sun and the word of God said out of that light come this is my my belov son hear ye him now the Bible said he sh it was glowing right and then when it was all over they saw Jesus and all I could think about is that Moses and Elijah went back to where they were in him here they were standing there and all of a sudden they disappeared where did they go Jesus Christ was the Moses Jesus Christ was the Elijah oh my and Jesus Christ is you amen that's where we are that's where we are and you and I must Realize by the grace of God that light must increase it must increase it must grow stronger long when we were babes like the like the morning sun we didn't have straight but there come a time when the sun itself become in its full strength amen and so must the s o NS Sons and Daughters of God must come into their full strength amen when they come into their full strength it's around about Harvest Time the light must increase the darkness must vanish you love the Lord let's stand I I just trust that somehow God allow you to see if you are children of the light your children of the day all Darkness must flee as our brother said Accord and he it was perfect he said it like this you know in in the book solom The Songs of Solomon he said you know the Shadows flee away and this bride like Enoch P me must not reflect a shadow hello somebody must not reflect a shadow the sun must hit her so perfectly that that building and the sun must be one no Shadows may God help us rightous father God we come before you in your precious name we thank you for the light we thank you for this great Revelation you showing us who we are and where we come from father we thank you right now we pray that you bless each and every heart soul and mind help us Lord conquer every dark spot of us in Jesus Christ's name to your glory Lord amen
