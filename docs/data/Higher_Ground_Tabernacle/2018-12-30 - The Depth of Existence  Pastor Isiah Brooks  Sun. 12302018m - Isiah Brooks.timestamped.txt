[29:05] as we stand we like to ask that you
[29:15] would turn with us by God's grace to
[29:20] Ephesians the fourth chapter the
[29:25] Ephesians the fourth chapter surely
[29:30] we've been having a wonderful time the
[29:32] Lord in spite of all the battles God has
[29:38] been really good
[29:42] Ephesians the fourth chapter we're going
[29:45] to read from the fourth through the
[29:49] seventh verse and then we'll go to
[29:53] Ephesians the third chapter reading the
[29:58] fourteenth through the 19th verse verses
[30:03] there is a one body in one spirit even
[30:06] as ye are called in one hope of your
[30:11] calling one Lord one faith one baptism
[30:16] one God and Father of all who is above
[30:21] all and through all and in you all but
[30:28] unto every one of us is given grace
[30:30] according to the measure
[30:32] of the gift of Christ wherefore he saith
[30:37] when he ascended up on high he led
[30:40] captivity captive and gave gifts unto
[30:44] men
[30:46] Ephesians the third chapter we began
[30:51] reading at the fourteenth verse for this
[30:55] calls I bow my knees unto the father of
[30:59] our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole
[31:02] family in heaven and earth his name that
[31:07] he would grant you according to the
[31:10] riches of his glory to be strengthened
[31:14] with might by his spirit in the inner
[31:17] man amen that Christ may dwell in your
[31:24] hearts by faith that ye being rooted and
[31:28] grounded in love may be able to
[31:32] comprehend with All Saints what is the
[31:36] breadth and length and death and height
[31:41] and to know the love of Christ with
[31:45] passeth knowledge that ye might be
[31:49] filled with all the fullness of God let
[31:54] us pray
[31:54] father we thank you this morning for
[32:00] your amazing grace we thank you for your
[32:05] faithfulness because your word said it's
[32:08] renewed every morning so is your mercy
[32:13] and your grace Lord and we thank you
[32:16] because it still is amazing to me how
[32:20] you would take someone like myself and
[32:23] save me Lord not our choosing you but
[32:28] you chose us and so this morning we want
[32:33] to lift up our hands and Thanksgiving we
[32:37] want to raise our hands and praise we
[32:41] just think your Lord God because we
[32:44] realize this morning and it's not what
[32:46] we do for you but what you have done for
[32:48] us thank you for this resurrection
[32:51] morning we pray father that you have
[32:54] dine on way this morning we give you
[32:57] praise we give you glory we give you
[32:58] honor in Jesus Christ's name Lord break
[33:02] and destroy the yokes
[33:03] of the enemy in everyone's life here
[33:07] this morning and God will be careful to
[33:09] give you the praise glory and honor in
[33:11] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may
[33:16] be seated we thank God for His amazing
[33:24] grace yesterday when the Lord was
[33:32] dealing with me I had a wonderful time
[33:37] and it is a wonderful time when the Lord
[33:41] speaks and we make when God began to
[33:45] talk with you it's a wonderful thing and
[33:52] it's amazing because you know it's God
[33:54] because your thoughts would never be the
[34:01] kind of thoughts he puts in your mind
[34:04] and I was a little tired and I thought I
[34:08] would rest but he wasn't finished
[34:10] talking and so I thought I'd better get
[34:15] up and put this down because yesterday I
[34:19] kept crying out to the Lord what would
[34:21] you have me to speak on this morning for
[34:24] tomorrow morning and so this message I
[34:28] know and I trust you will be able to
[34:30] hear it I know it came from God the
[34:35] message on this morning would be the
[34:39] depth of existence the depth of
[34:45] existence because I think sometimes we
[34:50] don't realize that our existence
[34:58] it's like no ways the way James
[35:00] described it James when he talked about
[35:04] the life is of April he's working with
[35:07] this life and when we think about
[35:12] eternal life we can't even fathom where
[35:16] our life from this dimension fit it's
[35:22] kind of like a nano second something
[35:25] that's so small
[35:27] it'll take the scientists to figure out
[35:29] how long it is
[35:31] and so therefore James could only say is
[35:36] like a vapor and those of us who have
[35:39] gained a little age on us we realized
[35:41] that this time that we thought would be
[35:45] long has been really short everything
[35:48] moves so quickly and so fast and it's
[35:53] just a small portion of existence when
[35:59] we talk about the depth we're talking
[36:02] about the vastness of it how great in
[36:08] proportion it is existence because you
[36:14] realize that you and I could not even
[36:18] exist without God it boggles my mind to
[36:25] know that there are so many people who
[36:27] don't believe in God
[36:30] and God is so great he had to condon sin
[36:36] he had to come down and become a grain
[36:40] of sand in order for us to even
[36:45] comprehend a small portion of him when
[36:53] we think of
[36:53] out just existing in itself we can't
[37:02] remember what we were before we got here
[37:06] but we existed we don't know what it was
[37:12] like to be a thought of God but we were
[37:15] a thought of God we don't remember when
[37:21] he chose us we don't remember when he
[37:24] called us we don't even remember when he
[37:27] said this is what you are going to be in
[37:29] life remember every gift and calling is
[37:37] without repentance so that means that
[37:41] God gave us gifts even though he knew we
[37:46] were gonna fall he knew the condition in
[37:49] which we were going to be in but yet he
[37:51] gave us gifts and every one of the gifts
[37:55] that God has given to us he gave it to
[37:58] us before the foundation of the world
[38:02] before we even knew we existed and the
[38:08] truth about those who are elected in
[38:11] chosen of God you have existed as long
[38:17] as God has existed and these little
[38:22] human lives of ours cannot even
[38:24] comprehend what that is this little life
[38:31] we call here life is just a fragment of
[38:36] existence you and I
[38:42] understand that we are not just flesh
[38:46] and blood but we are eternal beings a
[38:54] bridge off of the eternal one
[39:00] one thing about God you can't put him in
[39:04] a box you can't make him one like a
[39:08] finger as the prophet of God says even
[39:14] though he was the fullness of Christ in
[39:17] him Christ was he was the fullness of
[39:20] Christ yet he still was in all above all
[39:27] through all he was everything and if a
[39:34] man is spiritual he will be able to see
[39:39] God in his universe understand this God
[39:49] had to step into his universe if I would
[39:54] say it like that because everything
[39:57] outside of the universe is filled God
[40:03] everything the Bible says everything
[40:06] that's been laid everything that was
[40:10] made was made by Jesus Christ well the
[40:17] man who makes it says he's God in morphe
[40:21] he's one that could change his mask
[40:26] hallelujah and God can do whatever he
[40:30] wants to do God took a donkey one time
[40:34] it spoke through him is that Alright God
[40:42] took
[40:42] Ravin one time and understand that Raven
[40:45] had to be a holy Raven because that
[40:50] Raven was actually bringing some holy
[40:53] food to a holy man called Elijah these
[41:00] are just little things that God has done
[41:02] because the Bible says your mind in my
[41:07] mind cannot even imagine what God has in
[41:13] store for us eyes have not seen no ears
[41:17] I've heard it in order to make a man
[41:20] want to run the good get to heaven when
[41:25] we talk about depth we're talking about
[41:27] the word dep th depth i have a time
[41:32] pronouncing it sometime but my thought
[41:35] about it because it's so deep yet is so
[41:39] simple I think I know the deepest
[41:43] preacher ever preached on the face of
[41:45] the earth with Jesus Christ himself and
[41:48] he preached a profound message he said a
[41:52] soul went to sow a seed hallelujah
[41:59] a good man wit and he saw the seed and
[42:05] then an evil man came after him and so
[42:08] deceive when you and I can look and see
[42:13] what God is doing and what God has done
[42:17] it's it's just it it my mind can hardly
[42:22] contain it that God will take take to
[42:27] the whole Redemption playing and liking
[42:31] it as a seed just to see and basically
[42:37] while he was preaching he was telling
[42:39] the church don't you understand they're
[42:42] two sees there's one that's good there's
[42:44] one that's evil and you can't be nothing
[42:47] but what you are whatever that seed is
[42:52] that's what you are when
[42:56] talk about dimension God is the God of
[43:00] all dimensions David said if I make my
[43:05] bed and he'll go out there if I die and
[43:10] take wings and fly to the uttermost
[43:12] parts of the earth though out there
[43:16] basically he said there is no place to
[43:19] hide from him I don't know why people
[43:23] think they have secrets
[43:25] because even God knows the secrets of
[43:29] the heart
[43:30] there's nothing can be hidden from him
[43:33] the Bible said everything that looking
[43:36] dark is light to God God sees it it
[43:41] doesn't matter how dark it is in haha
[43:43] hard we try to hide it from him he seen
[43:46] it all you and I must understand that
[43:51] this God is such a powerful God we we
[43:54] sing that song awesome God but I wonder
[43:57] do we really know what it means
[44:02] hallelujah man who goes
[44:08] say I don't believe this side of
[44:11] eternity how will ever realize that what
[44:15] you are the position that you are that
[44:20] God has placed you you spirit-filled
[44:23] people you are sons of God why he said
[44:29] angels are servant you're a son an angel
[44:34] can only bring you a message but you
[44:37] have to act hey mate you're the actor in
[44:42] the scene Oh somebody helped me this
[44:45] morning he said you're the actor that
[44:50] leads of anybody gonna see God in man
[44:53] he's got to see him in you and I he
[44:57] exists
[44:58] he's the invisible God but you and I are
[45:03] the actors we are the physical part that
[45:10] men need to see in order to comprehend
[45:15] is that right Oh think about it
[45:20] just to give me an illustration the
[45:22] woman at the well had never seen God
[45:26] didn't know what he looked like
[45:29] but one day he was at the well
[45:32] hallelujah and he did a certain sign he
[45:36] was able to discern the hearts her heart
[45:39] in so much she ran to the sea and say
[45:42] come see a man isn't this the Messiah he
[45:48] told me everything she really got
[45:52] excited but you see had Jesus just had a
[45:58] conversation with her and none of the
[46:02] discernment of the Messiah
[46:03] sign was seen she never would have
[46:06] caught on that he was a prophet and to
[46:13] to those who may not understand what a
[46:15] prophet is a true born prophet is God
[46:21] manifestation in flesh doesn't mean he's
[46:25] not a man doesn't mean he doesn't make
[46:28] mistakes but when it comes to the word
[46:31] he makes no mistakes hallelujah an angel
[46:40] can only bring you a message but you
[46:43] have to act a man you're the actor on
[46:46] the scene you're the son the angel is
[46:50] your servant to bring you the message

[46:59] to do so and so this is from the FRA
[47:02] father I bring it to you yes that's all
[47:05] he is
[47:06] a man you're a son and a daughter of God
[47:11] predestinated us hallelujah

[47:18] as he hath chosen us now we didn't

[47:33] me hallelujah is that right chosen us in
[47:39] him before the foundation of the world
[47:42] that we should be what holy so you

[47:50] chosen to be holy God will make sure you
[47:54] become holy you can't just get the Holy
[47:58] Ghost God must receive you it ain't you
[48:03] receiving God is God receiving you then

[48:24] think we can go places like we want to
[48:26] know sure if you are true living example
[48:32] of God if you are a thought or
[48:35] gene of God God will not allow it
[48:39] hallelujah but sometimes we think we
[48:43] have a right you have no right when you
[48:48] give your life to God you have no right
[48:53] you stripped hallelujah you come to a
[48:59] place in God where you want to die out
[49:02] and rot from all of your ways you have
[49:09] no right after you claim Jesus Christ
[49:13] you have no right to live any kind of
[49:18] way you want to live I'm talking about
[49:22] existence because for some reason people
[49:26] believe that you can live whatever you
[49:29] want to live and make heaven that is a
[49:31] deception from the devil you can't do it
[49:38] no one clean thing will enter those
[49:41] gates and if you die unholy you do not
[49:45] go to a holy place called heaven
[49:48] hallelujah you go to the place that has
[49:51] been designed for those who are unholy
[49:55] is that Alright see a true son of God
[49:59] stands the test they don't get me wrong
[50:02] I'm not will never say that you're not
[50:05] sons and daughters of God but every son
[50:08] and daughter of God must it's not an
[50:11] option you must be filled with the Holy
[50:15] Ghost now I'm talking about existence
[50:18] I'm I'm talking about you understanding
[50:21] that now you are playing the role that
[50:24] God thought of you when you was in his
[50:28] mind
[50:29] there's nothing oh I didn't know he was
[50:32] gonna be that way I didn't know she was
[50:35] gonna be that way no he knew every
[50:38] mistake you and I was going to make he
[50:42] knew our sauce he knew our pitfalls he
[50:45] knew our imprisonment he knew our in
[50:47] change
[50:48] I'll get the Devil Within chain i
[50:50] chained us up he knew these things
[50:53] hallelujah
[50:54] but God is able to break the Fowler's
[50:57] snare you'll never know what grace is
[51:02] until you know the love of Jesus for you
[51:07] personally hello somebody y'all
[51:12] understand what I'm saying those of us
[51:15] who think you're righteous and so holy
[51:16] God gonna get you unless you humble
[51:19] yourself oh I'm coming just a minute
[51:24] ain't nothing good about you ain't
[51:27] nothing holy about you hallelujah there
[51:30] is no good thing in a man nothing and
[51:34] when you begin to think that you're so
[51:37] holy and so righteous you off the track
[51:41] hallelujah that's why the Bible said
[51:43] you've got to be careful how you judge
[51:45] others because because of the same way
[51:49] you judge others God is going to come
[51:51] back and judge you well I feel like
[51:54] shouting right now but I got a preach
[51:58] the Bible and say God doesn't tempt men
[52:02] but God tries men test them
[52:06] God cannot tempt you but God can test
[52:09] you and every son that cometh to God
[52:12] must be tested or child trained before
[52:16] he can be a son and if we can stand
[52:20] chastisement the Bible said we become
[52:23] illegitimate children excuse me and if
[52:27] we can't excuse me stand chastisement
[52:31] the Bible said we become illegitimate
[52:34] children and not the children of God
[52:37] because a child of God is born of God
[52:41] and he will stand the test anywhere
[52:44] anytime in a condition on any condition
[52:48] a child is born of God he that's born of
[52:53] God does not see hello
[53:00] you may be elected of God you may in the
[53:05] mind of God be bribed but you still got
[53:08] to be born again Jesus Christ was born
[53:11] the son of God and he still had to be
[53:14] born again
[53:15] hello he still needed the Holy Ghost and
[53:20] if Jesus Christ needed the Holy Ghost
[53:23] you needed to see no no no no no if you
[53:28] think that heaven is full of self
[53:31] righteous people you've got it no I can
[53:34] tell you where the self righteous people
[53:36] are they are in hell they're not in
[53:39] heaven hallelujah even with all of the
[53:43] mighty things that God did to brother
[53:45] Adam you know what he was singing on the
[53:49] other side man Jim Gray how sweet so
[53:58] y'all understand me even the prophet of
[54:01] God knew if he was to make it it would
[54:05] still be by grace
[54:09] hallelujah deaths depths of the word
[54:13] yeah everybody say they deep and they
[54:16] don't even understand the blood of Jesus
[54:18] Christ they don't understand what the
[54:21] sacrifice of Calvary was fine because
[54:27] they're not really born again how can
[54:31] you be born again if you don't
[54:33] understand it took blood to save you
[54:38] something had to die in your place cuz
[54:42] you would have never measured up hello
[54:45] something someone died in your place
[54:48] because you would have never measured up
[54:53] you and I in all our effort could never
[54:57] live holy by will of the flesh hello
[55:03] somebody the only way that you and I
[55:05] could ever become holy
[55:06] he's by the blood of Jesus hallelujah
[55:12] and understand what the blood of Jesus
[55:14] is for today brother branham call it a
[55:16] token it is the Holy Ghost but nobody
[55:21] wants to be inconvenienced
[55:23] nobody really want to go through the
[55:25] measure to get it because like I said
[55:28] last week a week before last they've
[55:30] taught this holy goes without sensation
[55:33] and I agree there is that experience
[55:36] holy goes without sensation but where is
[55:40] the person of Jesus Christ ooh that all
[55:47] right see even in this message they want
[55:50] to stop where brother branham didn't
[55:52] stop he said the justification made room
[55:54] for st. location and Saint vacation make
[55:57] room for the baptism of Holy Ghost and
[55:59] he said what there's another stage
[56:01] there's another step and the Holy Ghost
[56:04] make room for the person of Jesus Christ
[56:07] himself well that's what I want to see
[56:11] the person of Jesus Christ I've seen God
[56:16] heal I've seen God deliver someone said
[56:20] to me the other day Saint John was it
[56:23] 1412 all referred to the prophet of God
[56:26] I said who told you that error that is a
[56:28] devil that is for the Bride of Christ
[56:32] God never isolated that scripture like
[56:36] that your prophet never did it
[56:38] hello somebody need to go listen to God
[56:43] and his people believe us 1950 but the
[56:48] party is if you don't if you don't
[56:53] accept that word st. John 14:12 for
[56:57] everybody you have taken from the word
[57:00] and the eternal life will be taken from
[57:04] you
[57:04] hello God y'all better hear me I can
[57:08] feel it I don't care but the truth of
[57:10] the matter is God is not interested in
[57:14] Gentile churches and supposing to a
[57:18] building God is interested only in
[57:21] individuals well that he chose from the
[57:25] foundation of
[57:27] I don't care how long you've been in
[57:30] this message God is more interested on
[57:33] how long the message has been in you
[57:39] Ephesians 4 4 through 7 says there is
[57:42] one body one spirit even as you are
[57:47] called into one hope of your calling one
[57:50] Lord one faith one baptism one God and
[57:56] Father of all who is above all and
[57:59] through all and in you all hallelujah
[58:04] you can't even state God even when you
[58:07] die hallelujah and so many people think
[58:12] when you're dead you're done no sir
[58:15] hallelujah just like you don't remember
[58:17] getting here uuuuu you understand me we
[58:21] got here we came from somewhere and we
[58:24] on a journey going somewhere but think
[58:27] about it
[58:28] eternity because God covers everything
[58:33] and you must understand those who are
[58:39] with God and in the mind of God before
[58:41] the foundation of the world has no
[58:44] stopping place there is no into you they
[58:50] cannot be into you because there's no
[58:54] into God but until every one of us is
[59:00] given grace according to the measure of
[59:03] the gift of Christ that means all of us
[59:06] will not have the same every one of us
[59:11] are different but God measures out a man
[59:15] a different amount of faith some might
[59:18] be able to move mountains
[59:19] some may be able to raise the dead some
[59:22] may be able to lay hands on the sick and
[59:24] they recover some may be able to fast
[59:26] three days seven days summer prayer
[59:30] warriors hallelujah but every operation
[59:35] is by one spirit and that is the Holy
[59:37] Ghost
[59:40] oh my I feel like shouting up here there
[59:45] is no space outside of God God created
[59:48] space whatever you consider in your mind
[59:52] is space god created space and the bible
[59:57] tells us that he's in every space
[59:59] wherever it is whatever's been created
[1:00:02] God is in it
[1:00:03] God is in time hallelujah God operates
[1:00:09] my time yet he's eternal hallelujah
[1:00:13] oh come on somebody I'm trying to get
[1:00:17] you to see something because a lot of
[1:00:18] times a second to the other week we were
[1:00:21] talking about the blood it'll go back to
[1:00:24] the blood because the life of the blood
[1:00:26] is what we're working with we say
[1:00:28] there's power power wonder-working power
[1:00:31] in the blood
[1:00:32] do you realize what was what you're
[1:00:34] saying you said there is God and blood
[1:00:37] God in the blood money working God in
[1:00:39] the blood because we're not working with
[1:00:42] the elements we're working with the life
[1:00:46] of God and so none of us will be able to
[1:00:52] get before God and say God the blood
[1:00:56] didn't work you didn't give me enough of
[1:01:04] blood in my life
[1:01:06] do you realize what blood the blood of
[1:01:09] God brother answer we don't work with
[1:01:11] the chemicals it ain't the chemistry if
[1:01:14] you had a crews of the blood of Jesus
[1:01:18] Christ right now it'll do you no good
[1:01:20] why the life is gone out of it there's
[1:01:24] no power in the chemistry like there was
[1:01:27] no populace and folks even Jesus
[1:01:30] declared he'd never healed anybody did
[1:01:34] y'all know that he said I do jesus never
[1:01:42] healed anybody that's that's
[1:01:46] verbatim but your prophet says Jesus
[1:01:48] never heal anybody you never heal nobody
[1:01:53] I don't care how many times you lay your
[1:01:54] hands brother branham declare himself he
[1:01:58] never healed anybody jesus said the work
[1:02:03] that I do he said I can't do it he says
[1:02:06] when I see the father do it then I do it
[1:02:10] it is the Holy Spirit it is a life in
[1:02:14] the blood
[1:02:15] it was the god that tabernacled the
[1:02:17] flesh hallelujah for this cause I bow my
[1:02:25] knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus
[1:02:27] Christ that scripture is real this is ok
[1:02:38] so you gotta understand I know this
[1:02:41] message came from God when we talk about
[1:02:45] the mind we think about this little
[1:02:48] thing that can add thing who you got a
[1:02:51] good mind you can remember you know God
[1:02:53] is talking about the being of existence
[1:02:55] in you that thing that existing you it
[1:02:58] goes beyond this this off this brain
[1:03:01] this flesh brain let this mind be in you
[1:03:06] what he's working with the Holy Spirit
[1:03:10] he's working with the character of God
[1:03:13] the nature of God let this nature be in
[1:03:17] you and while you serve abroad with you
[1:03:22] of course let me say it like this you're
[1:03:24] gonna find peace people in this message
[1:03:26] that's gonna give you all kinds of stuff
[1:03:29] I think that's sweet and Kanyon Sweeting
[1:03:32] all praise God this is what I am but let
[1:03:35] me tell you something if you don't get
[1:03:37] born again if you really don't get the
[1:03:39] Holy Ghost it does not apply to you now
[1:03:43] you can you can you can go on with
[1:03:46] knowing all these great mysteries
[1:03:48] oh brother books you so simple you're
[1:03:51] just too simple I'm simple enough for
[1:03:53] you to understand and one thing I don't
[1:03:57] have to say to nobody in here
[1:04:00] everybody know whether you got the Holy
[1:04:02] Ghost or not if you question it you need
[1:04:10] to find out for certain because the
[1:04:12] Bible said make your call and election
[1:04:14] sure
[1:04:15] oh I spoke in tongues that don't mean
[1:04:17] nothing I shouted that doesn't mean
[1:04:20] anything
[1:04:21] oh I ran up and down the house that I
[1:04:23] pay my tithe I come to church that
[1:04:26] doesn't mean I think have you received
[1:04:29] the Holy Ghost since you believe what is
[1:04:33] the Holy Ghost the life of God
[1:04:36] hallelujah and when the life of God come
[1:04:39] in you he gonna teach you how to live
[1:04:42] right you don't need a preacher over
[1:04:45] your shoulder you don't need one coming
[1:04:47] to your house if you got the Holy Ghost
[1:04:51] you live right well you live outside you
[1:04:54] live everywhere you go you live right
[1:05:01] yeah like I said I can tell you I can be
[1:05:06] just as mean and some of y'all want me
[1:05:07] to be youyou want me to use authority
[1:05:10] over you I can do that but I feel God I
[1:05:13] can tell you all you can't do this you
[1:05:16] can't do that you're not gonna do this
[1:05:17] and you gonna come to church I can do
[1:05:20] all of that but what will it produce a
[1:05:26] 2-fold child of hell you might do
[1:05:31] everything I say do and do it right but
[1:05:34] your righteousness is out of me your
[1:05:37] righteousness must be of God he is the
[1:05:42] righteous judge now I'm saying things
[1:05:45] they're not even on my nose so I know
[1:05:46] somebody needed she in the mind of God
[1:05:50] when we talk about the mind we talk
[1:05:53] about the consciousness and that's the
[1:05:55] thing brother Branham says there's many
[1:05:57] people who call themselves Christians
[1:05:58] who don't even recognize the presence of
[1:06:02] God they don't even know it why because
[1:06:06] they're so in tune to the dishes they
[1:06:09] want to see a tree move or something
[1:06:11] fatter or what
[1:06:12] ever hallelujah
[1:06:15] is that right brother man I'm using
[1:06:18] experienced descriptions he said when
[1:06:20] Jesus stood at that pulpit and said this
[1:06:21] day this scripture is fulfilled in your
[1:06:25] ears he was full of the anointing the
[1:06:29] anointing of God was upon him so there
[1:06:32] Norton doesn't mean you gotta jump all
[1:06:35] the time the anointing of God in you
[1:06:38] when God can can can can can can get it
[1:06:41] when God I'm getting excited can just
[1:06:45] speak through you you're no longer
[1:06:49] speaking that's God's began when God can
[1:06:52] sing through you you're no longer the
[1:06:55] singer he is the singer you using your
[1:06:58] body when you can play the instrument
[1:07:01] hallelujah and you're no longer playing
[1:07:04] but God is playing the instrument see
[1:07:07] that's the kind of thing you want in
[1:07:10] your life hallelujah because when God
[1:07:13] wants something and he really wants you
[1:07:17] to do something and you've got you have
[1:07:18] the Holy Ghost you say Lord what what is
[1:07:24] it that you would have me to do I find
[1:07:29] out that even in this generation the
[1:07:31] hardest thing for people to do is to
[1:07:33] forgive you don't even have it if you
[1:07:36] can't forgive the devil is lying to you
[1:07:39] hallelujah you mean to tell me my Lord
[1:07:42] can be spared in the face where a crown
[1:07:48] of thorns whipped all night mockery spit
[1:07:54] hanging from his face the people he
[1:07:57] dissolved what did that not as into me
[1:08:01] the people he loved did that and
[1:08:10] up there in agonizing pain we said
[1:08:14] Father forgive them for they know not
[1:08:17] what they do
[1:08:18] brother branham tells us when people do
[1:08:20] bad to you that don't mean it's the
[1:08:22] person it's the devil you don't even
[1:08:25] have the love of God in you until you
[1:08:27] recognize your enemy it's not your
[1:08:29] brother or your sister it's the devil
[1:08:32] that's how deep the word is that's deep
[1:08:38] because most people can't do it and you
[1:08:40] won't be able to do it except God being
[1:08:44] you and now the statue of a perfect man
[1:08:57] he says now we put the blood of Jesus
[1:09:00] Christ
[1:09:00] nc in and that brings the faith of Jesus
[1:09:05] Christ the virtue of Jesus Christ the
[1:09:08] knowledge of Jesus Christ the tempers of
[1:09:11] Jesus Christ the patience of Jesus oh
[1:09:13] the blood when the blood is applied this
[1:09:17] is what it bring right it brings the
[1:09:21] faith of Jesus Christ the virtue of
[1:09:23] Jesus Christ the knowledge of Jesus
[1:09:25] Christ the tempers of Jesus Christ the
[1:09:27] pages of Jesus Christ the godliness of
[1:09:30] Jesus Christ the president kindness of
[1:09:32] Jesus Christ and the love of God which
[1:09:36] is Jesus Christ he's ahead and controls
[1:09:41] you you don't control him he controls
[1:09:45] you all help me Lord
[1:09:48] people said I gotta lay down my Holy
[1:09:50] Ghost ah if you can lay it down you
[1:09:52] don't have it hallelujah right hey and
[1:09:59] your feet is a foundation thing amen
[1:10:02] control by the head takes seat there you
[1:10:05] are there is the perfect man of God when
[1:10:08] he possesses these virtues
[1:10:11] then God representing his church as a
[1:10:15] bride a woman God represents his church
[1:10:19] as a bride and the way he breathes
[1:10:22] individual to bring his son to go in the
[1:10:25] bride he also has brought the bride
[1:10:28] through these ages hallelujah and he
[1:10:33] says listen till he brings this one
[1:10:35] complete church hung into this so you
[1:10:41] got to come into that you want to make a
[1:10:44] rapture stop fighting the whole
[1:10:47] experience if you want the rapture you
[1:10:50] want to make a wrap to stop fighting the
[1:10:53] Holy Spirit and most of the time you
[1:10:56] know what it is we are too selfish
[1:11:00] selfish it's all about you
[1:11:03] you don't even consider that the bride
[1:11:06] of Jesus Christ is hurting because of
[1:11:09] your sins here's somebody it's the truth
[1:11:15] you get out here you do what you want to
[1:11:17] do and you don't even realize that the
[1:11:19] bride of Jesus Christ I'm speaking on

[1:11:25] Christ is hurting because of your sin
[1:11:27] your stubbornness yo selfishness may God

[1:12:09] salvation is sure and if we can see the
[1:12:13] vastness of God and we can see how great
[1:12:15] he is we realize a man that there is
[1:12:20] nothing too hard for God nothing nothing
[1:12:24] nothing nothing nothing too hard for God
[1:12:26] is that right oh praise the Lord because
[1:12:32] our little stuff is nothing Paul call
[1:12:34] them light afflictions
[1:12:36] ooh can I preach just a little while
[1:12:40] longer the Bible says in Revelation that
[1:12:43] when the beasts claim he deceived all
[1:12:46] upon the earth the beasts did he deceive
[1:12:51] all upon the earth whose names were not
[1:12:55] written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:12:58] since the revival began uh-huh dole does
[1:13:04] that sound right well since the preacher
[1:13:06] preached that my mighty sermon since
[1:13:09] that man was healed since that
[1:13:11] foundation know since the foundation of
[1:13:14] the world where was Jesus slain at
[1:13:17] Calvary no sir Jesus was slain before
[1:13:21] the foundation of law behold the lamb of
[1:13:25] God that was slain before the foundation
[1:13:28] of the world God in the beginning when
[1:13:32] he saw the sin he saw what was happening
[1:13:35] he spoke the word Jesus was slain before
[1:13:39] the foundation of the world and every
[1:13:41] person was saved was saved according to
[1:13:46] the Bible when the lamb was slain in the
[1:13:49] mind of God before the foundation of the
[1:13:51] world
[1:13:52] you were included in the salvation then
[1:13:54] so what are you going to do about it
[1:13:57] hallelujah y'all understand what he's
[1:13:59] saying I didn't just get saved you
[1:14:02] didn't just get saved you were saying
[1:14:04] before the foundation of the world
[1:14:07] now what are you gonna do then
[1:14:10] what do you mean even Jesus Christ
[1:14:14] Himself God manifested in the flesh had
[1:14:17] a will and he could have either obeyed
[1:14:22] or disobeyed and his flesh man did not
[1:14:29] want to go to Calvary and he prayed
[1:14:34] father not my will but thine be done
[1:14:38] see everything in the Bible it doesn't
[1:14:41] mean you gonna want to do it
[1:14:42] God just want obedience he didn't say
[1:14:45] you had to feel good doing it he just
[1:14:47] want obedient that's all God wants Jesus
[1:14:52] said not my will but let thine be done
[1:14:55] hallelujah and if my Lord said that and
[1:14:59] my lord is living in you he can say it
[1:15:02] again he'll do it again
[1:15:04] the same life that was in him if it's in
[1:15:07] you it lives the same ie it conquers the
[1:15:11] same way it always conquered and that's
[1:15:14] by divine love is that right brother
[1:15:18] Bailey said God took a lamb sweetness
[1:15:22] and meekness that's why most of us we
[1:15:25] don't win the battles we we want to
[1:15:27] fight we want to fuss we want to argue
[1:15:30] we want to carry on you are out the will
[1:15:33] of God when you do it that way
[1:15:35] you're not a lamb hello
[1:15:38] you are not displaying than their nature
[1:15:41] and when you work that way God departs
[1:15:45] that's why you feel empty that's why you
[1:15:48] feel alone because you're trying to
[1:15:50] battle the wrong way hallelujah the
[1:15:54] bride conquers according to divine love
[1:15:57] and divine love conquers everything if
[1:16:01] Jesus could whip the devil on camera to
[1:16:04] sweetness and meekness look it up that's
[1:16:07] what brother I'm said here was a lion
[1:16:09] haha conquering the devil with his lamb
[1:16:15] nature love will always conquer whether
[1:16:21] you understand it or not hey somebody
[1:16:26] that all right that old drunkard came in
[1:16:29] that house with his buddies and
[1:16:31] everything else and he said yeah cuz

[1:16:35] nobody there's a Christian hallelujah
[1:16:37] that old drunk who said you come on with
[1:16:39] me I'll show you my wife is a Christian

[1:16:55] extra drunk ah he gets to the table I
[1:17:00] don't want that old stuff and he and his
[1:17:04] buddy got up from the table and
[1:17:05] everything and while they were out of
[1:17:07] the room they peeking in and he was just
[1:17:10] Holy Ghost filled woman hi what was it
[1:17:15] she got on that floor and she began to
[1:17:18] sing must Jesus bear the cross alone and
[1:17:22] all the world go free no there's a cross
[1:17:27] for everyone and there's a cross for me
[1:17:30] hallelujah what was it it was that lamb
[1:17:34] nature it was the nature of God they're
[1:17:37] inside of that woman hey man she didn't
[1:17:39] have no other way to act because she was
[1:17:41] dead but Christ was living hallelujah
[1:17:46] and because of her reaction not only did
[1:17:50] her husband get saved but his friends
[1:17:54] did to God they saw the real example of
[1:18:00] a Christian what no screaming in Holland
[1:18:05] not on her part she cried out to the one
[1:18:08] who could help her in times of need
[1:18:10] hallelujah you understand me
[1:18:12] people of God I think sometimes we think
[1:18:14] we're gonna just go to heaven like a
[1:18:16] mess no the blood of Jesus supposed to
[1:18:19] clean that mess up grace is the time
[1:18:22] that God are lost to you to get rid of
[1:18:25] your mess there's no attitude in heaven
[1:18:31] there aren't any attitudes in heaven
[1:18:40] yeah I don't preach to preach for people
[1:18:42] to like me you know that I don't do that
[1:18:47] I'm gonna say what he wants me to say
[1:18:49] because I got to give an account for him
[1:18:51] return to him for this whoo if Jesus was
[1:18:56] slain before the founders of the world
[1:18:57] it taken four thousand years before it
[1:19:00] actually happened but when God spoke it
[1:19:03] back here
[1:19:04] every word of God is steadfast it's
[1:19:07] immutable its impart potable it cannot
[1:19:11] fail and when God slayed the son of
[1:19:15] before the family of the world he was
[1:19:18] just as much slain then as he was at
[1:19:20] Calvary it's a finished product and when
[1:19:24] God say so and remember when the lamb
[1:19:28] was slain your salvation was included in
[1:19:31] the sacrifice because the Bible said
[1:19:35] that your name was written on the layers
[1:19:38] book of life before the foundation are
[1:19:42] lower it ought to make see that's why
[1:19:45] the devil don't want you to press into
[1:19:47] it he wants you to get something that's
[1:19:50] almost you don't need the almost you
[1:19:53] need the Holy Ghost so you don't need
[1:19:56] something that's gonna be religious you
[1:19:58] don't need that you need something
[1:20:00] that's gonna take you into the Holies of
[1:20:02] Holies you wanna you want God just to
[1:20:06] seal you into that place so you can
[1:20:09] bloom like like like like like like the

[1:22:55] without a blemish has got to die in your
[1:22:59] place so you can live hallelujah it
[1:23:04] ain't because I belong to the message
[1:23:06] it ain't belong it is it you know I
[1:23:09] believe William Branham is the prophet
[1:23:11] praise God and you gotta believe that
[1:23:16] hallelujah
[1:23:17] you gotta believe God was in that man
[1:23:22] hallelujah
[1:23:23] I'm talking my rapture material now you
[1:23:27] gotta believe that every sign wonder and
[1:23:30] everything else he did it was Christ in
[1:23:32] the man hallelujah and it's so easy in
[1:23:39] the brother it's so easy for all of us
[1:23:41] to say you know what brother family this
[1:23:43] brother brown did this brother you think
[1:23:45] God gonna ask you that when you get to
[1:23:47] heaven if you get there you think he
[1:23:50] gonna say
[1:23:51] tell me everything William Branham did
[1:23:54] he ain't gonna do it why you got your
[1:23:58] own day you got your own work if he
[1:24:02] asked us that most of us wouldn't even
[1:24:04] know what all what he did because he
[1:24:07] didn't tell it all thank God we're not
[1:24:14] we won't be graded on that I would ask
[1:24:23] you but I'm gonna say it I'll answer how
[1:24:25] many y'all how many of y'all really read
[1:24:27] your Bible thank you
[1:24:31] I know you know I know people don't
[1:24:34] because so many people don't believe
[1:24:36] it's necessary you know if I said how
[1:24:42] many y'all listen to a tape every day
[1:24:43] that's that that's gonna drop to once a
[1:24:47] week twice a week once every two weeks
[1:24:55] it's good that you listen my opponents
[1:24:58] did not the brother him said this he
[1:25:01] said if you drink if you drink it he
[1:25:05] said it will push out all that meanness
[1:25:08] all that selfishness all that stuff you
[1:25:12] fight with every day he said if you
[1:25:14] drink it you you drink he's in the Holy
[1:25:16] Ghost did you know that he said the Holy
[1:25:19] Ghost feeds off the word so if you're
[1:25:22] not eating the word if you're not
[1:25:24] putting that word in you he has nothing
[1:25:26] to feed on your experience will die
[1:25:32] hmm so you gotta feed it you said what
[1:25:35] brother was what he said you have to eat
[1:25:37] this word every day saturate yourself in
[1:25:40] it is that right
[1:25:41] even if you can't understand it put the
[1:25:43] tape on listen to it anyway you should
[1:25:50] never go without you should never go a
[1:25:53] day without reading your word or
[1:25:55] listening to a tape or some gospel
[1:25:59] something you know you should always
[1:26:02] surround yourself with the heaven
[1:26:05] heavenly atmosphere I'm almost doing
[1:26:13] this the last quote I'm gonna read to
[1:26:15] today well my point is if we could see
[1:26:18] the vast and then you see that your
[1:26:19] little eye light affliction I was
[1:26:23] telling somebody years ago I used to
[1:26:26] those are Streisand I said oh that's
[1:26:28] supposing this is just a little feather
[1:26:30] on my back hmm
[1:26:34] I got this felt on my back oh my burdens
[1:26:36] are so heavy I don't know what I'm gonna
[1:26:41] do and I can't hardly make it oh oh I
[1:26:48] can't
[1:26:49] I can't Holly make you brother Oh
[1:26:52] nonsense that's the way God looking at
[1:27:01] us nonsense you know when Jesus couldn't
[1:27:07] Holly make it as a man guess what
[1:27:09] happened the Lord sent an angel to
[1:27:12] strengthen him and you are the body of
[1:27:16] Christ don't you realize when you get to
[1:27:18] a place you can hardly make it all
[1:27:20] you've got to do is cry out to God and
[1:27:22] Goddess dispatch an angel
[1:27:24] someone to this to do what to strengthen
[1:27:27] you more than likely your theophany get
[1:27:33] up from there boy you know you can do
[1:27:34] better than that
[1:27:41] how many I'll believe you got it the
[1:27:43] often because really when you hear from
[1:27:46] this message and you really believe it
[1:27:48] that's is that shows you haven't you
[1:27:50] haven't the off me you have a word body
[1:27:52] that means you are eternal and it's
[1:28:00] Christ that God looks at not you hello
[1:28:04] but sometimes people look at this like
[1:28:06] okay Christ is here and I'm here Christ
[1:28:10] that looks he looks at coming back to
[1:28:13] the blood right where is Christ heard
[1:28:16] somebody you get an A today it has to be
[1:28:20] he has to be in you that's why when I
[1:28:24] see the blood I'll pass over you
[1:28:27] I must see Christ in you in auditor for
[1:28:30] the judge judgment angel to pass over
[1:28:33] you he looking at you once you did your
[1:28:38] dad suppose suppose what are you dead
[1:28:41] and if you got Christ on the inside
[1:28:44] that's what God is looking at the seed
[1:28:47] the blood of Jesus the life of Christ in
[1:28:50] you that's why he passes over you but if
[1:28:55] you don't have it you get the same stuff
[1:28:57] the foolish virgin gone again until you
[1:29:00] get Christ in you you gonna have battle
[1:29:03] after battle failure after failure it's
[1:29:06] going to be just that way until you
[1:29:08] really get the real Christ in you I'm
[1:29:12] almost done is this alright so if
[1:29:16] there's no fault in him how can there be
[1:29:18] fall how can he find fall when you are
[1:29:21] dead and your life is here in Christ
[1:29:23] through God sealed by the Holy Ghost
[1:29:26] they are the they that are born of God
[1:29:30] does not commit sin for he cannot sin
[1:29:32] how can he sin when a perfect sacrifice
[1:29:35] is laying in his place God never looks
[1:29:38] at me he looks at Christ because we're
[1:29:41] in Christ
[1:29:43] alright and if I love Christ I live with
[1:29:47] him he will never brought he will never
[1:29:51] bought me unless he knows if
[1:29:54] God saved me today knowing he was going
[1:29:57] to lose me six weeks from today he is
[1:29:59] defeating his own purpose he don't even
[1:30:03] know the future then if he saved me
[1:30:06] knowing what he's want to save me for
[1:30:09] knowing he's going to lose me God
[1:30:12] doesn't do things then take it back in
[1:30:17] two weeks to keep his promise when he
[1:30:21] saved you it's for time and eternity I'm
[1:30:28] gonna stop there
[1:30:30] because I'm gonna say this to you
[1:30:32] everybody in here by God's grace I'm not
[1:30:36] trying to make people feel bad I'm
[1:30:39] trying to don't waking us out of this
[1:30:40] religious stuff that we find ourselves
[1:30:42] in religion club with religion
[1:30:50] everywhere I go that's what I see
[1:30:52] religion everybody hide behind William
[1:30:55] Branham religion oh I believe the
[1:30:59] Prophet don't get me wrong you've got to
[1:31:01] believe the Prophet but do you think
[1:31:04] that's going to save you when you get to
[1:31:09] a place and you believe just that that's
[1:31:11] Antichrist cuz only place you can be
[1:31:14] save is under the blood Jesus Christ
[1:31:17] saves you got to have an experience you
[1:31:26] got to know Jesus for yourself then when
[1:31:30] Christ coming to you you become
[1:31:32] omnipotent rather than say God love
[1:31:36] bravery I heard that this morning God
[1:31:40] and His people
[1:31:41] he said God loves bravery he said when
[1:31:44] you get the Holy Ghost you're supposed
[1:31:45] to be brave not some weak something I
[1:31:52] don't know what you want to call it
[1:31:53] People of God I'm telling you you said a
[1:31:55] person's you shouldn't talk like that
[1:31:56] well if I got the spirit of Elijah and I
[1:31:59] got a double portion you ain't seen the
[1:32:01] half yet be large it and play with
[1:32:05] people he saw spirits and he
[1:32:08] he went right for the juggler and you
[1:32:12] and I must realize Amen this message is
[1:32:15] not something to be played with you
[1:32:17] either live it or you leave it that's
[1:32:21] the safest thing you can do you can't
[1:32:29] live it God can live it for you but you
[1:32:31] know what I tell people in it in closing
[1:32:34] they don't want to be inconvenience but
[1:32:37] I'm gonna tell you something God has
[1:32:39] never changed his way of birth every
[1:32:42] birth a calling the prophet of God is a
[1:32:45] mess I don't even care versus up in the
[1:32:48] pink decorated room it's gonna be a
[1:32:52] bloody mess and you're gonna ask any
[1:32:55] woman who's had a baby when she she's in
[1:32:59] the process of having that child she
[1:33:01] loses all her shame who when she is in
[1:33:08] the process of having our child she
[1:33:12] loses all of her shame and that's what
[1:33:16] hinders people right now why they don't
[1:33:18] have the Holy Ghost because they got too
[1:33:20] much pride and you get to a place where
[1:33:22] you you you throw away all your shame
[1:33:25] and you always give me throw away all
[1:33:27] your pride and don't care about who's
[1:33:30] next to you and what people think about
[1:33:33] you and in all that nonsense you talk
[1:33:36] about heaven you're talking about
[1:33:38] breaking through you talking about going
[1:33:41] all the way with God that God can go
[1:33:43] beyond the veil yabai him into your
[1:33:47] heart people afraid of it they don't
[1:33:52] preach it no more that's why we're
[1:33:53] getting all of these children amen
[1:33:56] that's not being with the rooster and
[1:33:58] they're rotting in the nest that's the
[1:34:02] problem
[1:34:05] you love the Lord
[1:34:12] in moments like I'll sing I'll sing
[1:34:26] [Music]
[1:34:37] [Music]
[1:34:43] [Music]
[1:35:12] let's say again in all this
[1:35:17] I'll sing I'll sing our love soul to G
[1:35:27] the moment a little singing sing it
