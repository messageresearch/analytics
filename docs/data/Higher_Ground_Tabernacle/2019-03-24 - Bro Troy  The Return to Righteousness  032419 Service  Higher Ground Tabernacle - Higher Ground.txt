man's standing before his face a things worth they do grow strangely dim it's a pleasant place to be a man it's a place where all the cares of this life they fade away amen you're in a place that's more things are really important to begin to appear amen amen there's no other joy that's greater than being face-to-face with the Lord Jesus Christ amen there's no other place I'd rather be amen so let's just as we stand turn our Bibles to the book of Psalms 137 will read the first to the fourth verses we just have the one service today I don't remember if we announced it or not we're putting my grandmother in a Alzheimer's on this afternoon so I wanted to be there to support them and I moved some furniture and all those things so amen it's a rough time of life for her my grandfather and my grandmother you know he's she's 91 and he's 88 and it's hard to take your wife with 67 years and put her in a home you know but but it's a time where it has to be done so hey man just keep them in their prayers since my name's were Sid and Marjorie I'd appreciate all the prayers you could send up for them amen so let's turn our Bibles Psalms 137 read the first through the fourth verse and it says by the rivers of Babylon there we sat down yay we wept when we remembered Zion maybe I just want to pause there for a second you know before we go for the rest of these verses God has always used rivers as a dividing line amen you know when they crossed over the Red Sea and the cross over the River Jordan he always used those rivers as a sign as a type that they were being separated from the Egyptians or they're being separated from the desert experience and they were leaving one thing behind and they were entering into something better something greater a man something that he had for them but you know when he come down to this experience here they're going backwards and I would pray that none of us ever find ourselves in this condition amen because in order for them to get to this place they had to cross over the river Jordan going the wrong direction amen and then as they crossed over the river Jordan going back into that desert land that they had been delivered from they had to travel five hundred some-odd miles to come to the river of Babylon amen so this scripture let's let's start over the first verse again I just want you to put yourselves in their shoes this morning and see where they were staying and what they were feeling and what they were going through amen verse 1 says by the rivers of Babylon there we sat down yay we wept when we remembered Zion we hanged our harps upon the Willows in the midst thereof for there they that carried us away captive required of us a song and they that wasted us required of us mirth saying sing us one of the songs of Zion verse 4 how shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land amen let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father I just thank you Lord for coming to this place this morning Lord as Swee your servant's father our reporting for duty Lord Lord we just pray father that this morning Lord if you'd seemed good in your sight father that you would open up the pages of this book father and you'd preach a message unto us father in a way that only you can do when your spirit comes on the scene father and we Lord we just submit ourselves to youth saying here we are Lord send us father Lord that we might be about our father's business Lord as you--as Lord in this day of the choosing of a bride Lord or looking for righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost Lord that we submit ourselves Lord as candidates for that Holy Ghost Lord that we might be the candidate Lord for for the filling of the Holy Spirit father and the refilling Lord candidates Lord to be that bride of Lord Jesus Christ and we thank you for it Lord we pray Lord that you would have thine own way with us this morning in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you can be seated this scripture I came across it I've read it many times but I came across it probably good five six weeks ago and it's one of those scriptures when all sudden you just start turning your Bible and you run across it several times in a row and you just can't seem to get away from it amen so as I thought about it and I thought you know I would never want to be in that position you know this is just no Christian ever ought to find themselves in Babylon Amen it's just not a place where a Christian ought to be they just don't belong there amen this is not God's chosen land this is not a place that that God chose for his people but the land of Babylon was a place where where they worshiped all it was ungodly all that was all that was evil all that was wicked amen they had many gods they they worshiped the the things of their own hands their own abilities their own whatever they wanted to do they worshiped fine living amen and and fine palaces and all those things but here they came when they took into captivity a people that were dedicated unto Jehovah amen and and and as these and as the the Jews there as they left the Israel the God had given them that promised land as a promise unto them this is your land I will be with you I will fight your battles for you I will fight for you you can go and you can have this land this will be the land where all of my promises are manifested amen and as and as they but when they cross their border of the cross God's commandments one too many times amen and they and and one too many times they they had disobeyed the Lord and they had forsaken him to the point that God left them up to their own devices amen that God left them to - to go into bondage by their neighbors amen amen is babylons saw them as an easy prey and they came down and they took them captive they they spoiled their temple they took all the things that David had created to serve the Lord and took it all captive and and dragged it all back over to Babylon and there had to be a sense of finality you know as they're crossing over Jordan the wrong direction I don't know what that was like for a people that that always told the stories to their children about their fathers you know about we remember you know don't ever forget past the story on from generation to generation about the how the Lord brought us up out of Egypt and crossed over the Red Sea about how we saw our enemy is dead upon the seashore and how Moses picked up the tambourine and Miriam picked up the tambourine and danced upon the seashore and sung the songs of Zion of God's deliverance amen I mean they take these stories of God's deliverance and they turn them into songs you know David was a great songwriter and hewed and he would constantly sing about these things and the Bible says that when Moses stood upon the red sea shore after they saw their enemies that Moses took up this song and sang and they sang about God's deliverance and these songs were passed down from generation to generation to generation and they would teach them to their children amen and their children teach it to their children and their children's children would teach it to another generation the songs of how the great Jehovah has delivered them the songs about how Jehovah has set them free aim about how Joshua stood before the River Jordan and God parted the waters for them and said on the other end of this on the other side of this river is where all God's promises when we made manifest to his people on the other side of the river is where all God's promises lay amen there you will enter into the promises of Jehovah amen they found out that those promises were true and then you went to over there and they found out those promises were yes and amen amen but when they came the time after they'd been every generation told those stories and passed down those songs to their children and as they sang those songs that there came a time that even though they kept singing the songs of the gods victory and singing the songs of God's deliverance that they can no longer experience God's delivery and they no longer even though they continued our table they were able by their mouth to to make the sound come out of their mouth of God's deliverance and to make the sound come out of their mouth of God's victory but yet as they are crossing over Jordan going the wrong direction as they are crossing over on boats and different things thinking about how you know our forefathers told us that God parted this river for us amen and we entered into this land and God's own power but we're going back out of the land under the power of the enemy by the boats that the enemy created the boats that the enemy had hid in the bush as they set up the ambush was amen amen and as those boats boats had been hidden there as the invading force crossed over you know and they and they hid all her stuff as they knew that they would bring the spoils back over that direction amen and as the and as they took him captive and they led them back to the boats of the enemy they thought you know the songs that we sung said that we entered into this land of in this very spot a may we enter into this land yeah by the power of God but we're going out underneath the power of unity and as they crossed over the rim Isles later they crossed over the river Babylon they're in a foreign land amen they've never gone this way before and as they set down there by the Willows of the river Babylon they sat down and they wept when they began to realize everything that they had lost amen and the Bible says that they're by the rivers of Babylon there we sat down yay we wept when we remembered Zion amen they wept when they finally realized they had lost it all a long time ago but now they were beginning to realize it see a thing of it is they had actually lost Zion way back when they first quit giving God the preeminence they lost Zion when they kept singing the songs of God's deliverance but they didn't Revere the very God that gave them that deliverance amen when they would sing the songs of David but they wouldn't actually worship God amen the thing of it is as they were singing those songs if they would have found themselves before God's judgment throne to be judged for the very words that they were speaking they would be judged guilty a man of speaking lies because how can they say he has brought me out of the deep miry clay while they themselves are bound by the affliction of the devil amen amen how can they say let God arise and and how his enemies will be scattered when their enemies are carrying them across the river amen as they set down there and they wept and they remember Jerusalem a man that one of their captors came and said hey we've heard some of those songs that you sang amen when we are marching towards Zion to do to take it over we heard the songs coming out of the temple and they sounded pretty good we'd like you to sing one of those songs for us a man tell us sing that song let God arise and all his enemies be scattered sing that song that we heard he brought me up out of the deep miry clay we'd like to hear that one amen sing that song as the deer panteth for the water so my soul longeth for thee and as they heard their enemies say sing us one of those songs they sat down they wept and they said how can we sing the songs of God's deliverance of God's presence of God's victory while we sit here in bondage how can we do it amen and sometimes I wonder how can we do it amen how do we enter into these these the this room sometimes and sing the songs of God's deliverance while we ourselves are in Chains of the things we won't give up and and the bondages and the things that we allow of Babylon into our own lives amen amen as brother branham's you know he made that quote once where he says oh they say revival and our day revival in our day how can we have revival when the regular revival giver is bound amen you bound them by your traditions and your Creed's you bound them by playing with the things of the world you bound the revival giver and then you sit here and you cry out for revival but the revival Giver has been bound amen and so was it was they were being asked to sing the songs of God's deliverance but the very deliverer had been in bound by the things that they allowed in their lives Amen that I pray that no Christian finds themselves in that condition I no one in this assembly we ever find themselves in this to that condition I can't imagine could you put yourselves in their shoes can you imagine what that would feel like amen to cross over into Babylon realizing you're never gonna come back that way again that you'll never be able to enter into God's promises ever again Amen that I am THE LORD thy God that healeth all thy diseases amen you're never not in a place where God's promises could ever be manifested again amen what a place that's a terrible place to be a man you know it's worth fighting against going into a place like that a man is worth taking up in your mind a resolve that that's not going to happen to me a man is worth setting the things in your life patterns of and habits of of worshiping the Lord of reading your Bible and prayer and of searching your heart to make sure that such a thing doesn't happen to you amen amen the the the title the sworn is the return to righteousness amen because you know every time God's children got out of the way every time God's children ever went into bondage every time they ever went into captivity God always gave them a promise of return a mess not just that they are going into captivity but there is always a promise of return amen if you go and you read the what they call the Minor Prophets there and at the end of the Old Testament amen you read the first chapter of every one of those books it's pretty depressing amen when you read the first chapter of every one of those of micha of Zephaniah of amos you know of Jonah of all of all those Malachi all those is pretty depressing you know they're they're they're being judged they're going under judgment they've sinned they've transgressed and they refuse to repent about it amen it's not just that they Santa did wrong but they wouldn't sit down and examine their own heart amen and when the prophet point out the things they wouldn't listen they meant but if you go and flip forward to the end of the book amen they're almost every single one of those books when you go and read the last chapter or the last three verses the last five verses there's always a promise of return Amen there's always a promise of a way back there's always a promise that I the Lord will bring you back to righteousness I the Lord will bring you back to the land where although God's promises to be manifested I the Lord will bring you back to a place where you'll be face-to-face with me I the LORD have chosen you I have called you by my name I will draw you back again I will forgive you of all your sins and iniquities I will choose you for my own namesake and you will come back to the land where all God's promises good what a blessing that's our God God always has a promise of a place of return so if you ever find yourself in captivity in Babylon if you ever find yourself chained by the things of Babylon amen amen if you ever find yourself as a cage of every unclean and hateful bird amen if where Jesus said come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins that you not be not be in Chains of her iniquities they meant if you ever find yourself with those iniquities with those chains those sins God has a promise of a return a way to come back to righteousness a way that you can be that righteous bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God has a way provided for you to return to righteousness amen amen I can only imagine you know and when you know they had that right before they went into bondage they had the last King the last son of David on the throne was King Zedekiah and King Zedekiah was he reigned there the Bible says that he was a wicked King amen he did not do the things of righteousness even though he was a son of David a man and as he tried to reign there upon the throne I think he reigned twelve or fourteen years upon the throne and then the prophecy went out by Jeremiah one year before they went into captivity Jeremiah prophesied he says the Lord will never want for a man or a son of David to reign on the throne the Lord will always have a son of David to reign upon the throne one year later the last son of David to reign on the throne was brought into captivity and it's amazing to me when I think about the timing of that prophecy going out that God will always have a son of David available to rain upon David's throne and then a year later the last son of David is going into captivity they take him and they take all of his sons and they put their feet upon their necks and they kill every one of them so if the line of David has been stamped out and then they and then they and they take Zedekiah and they pluck out his eyes so this is the last image that he'll ever see is his sons being killed and then they lead him back over to Babylon and as they're sitting down there and they're hanging their harps upon the trees and they're asking them to sing a song of deliverance they see their king being led and bought in ropes being led to to president in Babylon the last son of David how can they sing this in God's deliverance when they are bound and there goes their King and James to Babylon let's turn as we let's leave that scene let's go back to Exodus chapter 15 you X's action will read the last two verses of the 14th chapter verse 30 and 31 this is the children of Israel they're standing on the red sea shore after crossing over to the other side and it says thus the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore and Israel saw that great work which the Lord did upon the Egyptians and the people feared the Lord and the people believed the Lord and his servant Moses verse 1 says and then Moses then sang Moses and the children Israel this song and to the Lord and spake I will sing unto the Lord for he triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea though the Lord is my strength and song he has become my salvation he is my god and I'll prepare him my habitation my father's God and I will exalt him the Lord is a man of war the Lord Jehovah is his name yo the thing of it is is it's not that God had changed he was still the same yesterday today and forever amen God had not changed one bit Amen but the thing of it is is though even though they continue to sing this song of Moses they could sing then say that the Lord is my strength and song that he has become my salvation they could say that he is my God they could sing I will prepare him a habitation and that I will exalt him but the thing of it is that they actually didn't do it then as much as they sang about it that they actually after a while they quit doing it they no longer had a habitation for God amen they no longer exalted God amen so it's not they God the God didn't change but they didn't give God the Prima anymore in their lives a man so when they came to the river Babylon to cross over God was not there that's not that it's not that God had changed but they hadn't given God the preeminence anymore amen amen no matter how much they sang about it they couldn't give God the preeminence let's turn over to first chronicles chapter 14 now let's begin to put ourselves in the King David's shoes amen first chronicles chapter 14 verse 2 and it says and David perceived that the Lord had confirmed him king over Israel for his kingdom was lifted up on high because of his people Israel that's a pretty powerful place to be amen now let's go down to verse 9 and the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of refa him and David inquired of God and saying shall I go up against the Philistines and wilt thou deliver them into my hand and the Lord said unto him go up for I will deliver them into thine hand that's a pretty powerful place to be amen now they fight the battle here in the next couple verses you know what they win under the power of Jehovah amen now let's go down to the 13th verse and the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley therefore David inquired again of God and God said to him go not up after them turn away from them and come upon over against the mulberry trees and it shall be that way now shall hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees that then thou shalt go out to battle for God has gone before thee to smite the post of the Philistines now think about it now here's two battles that just took place back to back God is training his new king God is training his new king now this King David he had fought the lion and God had delivered him the lion they meant he had fought a bear and God delivered a bear into his hands aim and now he fought with King Saul he fought there with King Saul there and they slew the giant but now he's been ordained and been put in place king over Israel all things are in his hands amen and he goes in the battle and the enemy is coming into his land so he goes before the Lord he says Lord shall I go up and fight this battle against the enemy and Lord says go up I will be with you and so he learned how to fight the battle that day and nito and then I'm in a little while later the enemy comes back into the land again and instead of going out and fighting the exact same way he goes and he goes up and he seeks the Lord again amen he is keeping his Lord what do you want to do this time amen he's not assuming anything he's not assuming that he has the will of the Lord he's not assuming that he's in the presence of the Lord but he's going back he's rechecking his experience a man he's rechecking the path to the face-to-face with God he's making sure that that's a well beaten path to being face-to-face with Joe but he's making sure that before he goes into battle that he has the presence of the Lord with him and God has a different instruction for him why because God wants to show him something a little bit different a different way of battle a different way of fighting they send the Lord tells them don't go up right now rather turn and go over by the mulberry trees you know God has a special thing about mulberry trees you know and in any any turns it goes on by the mulberry trees he says when you hear the sound of rushing that's me when you sound here the sound of rushing up in the trees that's me that's Jehovah coming to fight your battle for you and you wait until you hear that sound wait until you know that Jehovah is on the scene wait until you know that Jehovah is present wait until you know Jehovah is here and then go on the battle and I will fight for you David had something to sing about amen David was able to sing and he's wrote and then when later on when the when the when the when the Ark of the Covenant saw a climbing a hill and it was put on the the backs of the Levites in his proper place he just started climbing up that hill he said oh my he said let God arise amen let God arise all of his enemies will be scattered the Ark of the Covenant is being put in his proper position Amen I tried putting it on a cart and I saw how it failed but now I put the Ark of the Covenant on the back of the Levites it's going up the hill to Mount Zion amen it's going up the hill it's going to the tent of the Lord it's going to God's chosen place where God has chosen to put his name amen in God's presence God's ark God's covenant amen the the cherubim where the blood of the Lamb is is going up to the place in the tent where God has chosen to place his name and as soon as God is in his proper position that as God arises and in his proper position let God arise all of his enemies will be scattered why does he say that he says because I have seen it in action I saw how God was in the tops of the mulberry trees I saw how God went forth before me in battle and now that I see the Ark of the Covenant of Scindia public on God's high hill upon the hill of Zion there's God or rises in Zion Amen to all of his enemies will scatter amen the hills will mouth like wax at the presence of the Lord amen no one can stand all will tremble at the presence of Jehovah amen why because I saw what it was like to fight a battle when the presence of the Lord was rushing and the tops of the mulberry trees I saw what it was like amen and they stood a wrote it down as a song in Morial amen a Psalm 68 verse one says let God arise and all of his enemies will be scattered amen all of them will be scattered just let God arise just let him rise up upon that holy hill and all of his enemies will be scattered and they sung that song for hundreds and hundreds of years singing about how as long as God is up in his high and holy Hill all of his enemies will be scattered let God arise to the top of the holy hill that God beer had been the preeminence that God being his proper position and all of God's enemies will be scattered but then when they set down by the river of Babylon and they said come sing us that song seeing a Psalm 68 let God arise and all those Amiens be scattered they wept when they remembered Zion because God's all of God's instruments all of his ornaments that were on God's holy hill when Solomon's Temple was ruined and spoiled on God's Hill a man you know that was God's hill that was always God's hill they might put different tents and Tabernacles and temples and things on top of the hill but that was God's hill that was Mount Zion amen how beautiful is Mount Zion they meant amen and know made me adorn it with different buildings that was God's high and holy hill but when it was spoiled by the hands of men and they took all the instruments and they wept when they saw them being carried off to Babylon how can we sing the song of David how can we experience the deliverance of David because we forgot to revere Jehovah on God's high and holy hymn amen and what good is it God's Hill when you don't have Jehovah on the scene God was no longer rushing in the tops of the mulberry trees amen they could sing the song of God's deliverance but God was no longer in the tops of the mulberry trees they couldn't go out to battle anymore because they didn't have the experience in David's head amen amen let's turn over let's go ahead a couple chapters of first chronicles 14 and back a couple chapters or I mean ahead first chronicles 16 sorry when they put the when they put the Ark of God in its place that's what chapter 16 here is as they're putting that Ark in its place David is pretty excited you know the previous chapter is where he was dancing you know it says verse 27 of the previous chapter that he was clothed with row of fine linen and all the Levites to bear the ark and the singers and Shanaya the master of the song with singers and David also had upon him a leaf out of Lena and thus all Israel brought up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord was shouting and with the sound of the cornet and trumpets and with cymbals and with the noise of psalteries and harps and it came to pass as the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord came into the city that Michael the daughter saw looked out the window and saw the King David dancing and playing and she despised him in her heart David was pretty excited why was he excited because he knew the what the promise he knew the possibilities of when God was in his proper position Amen that he knew that their Ark of the Covenant they were with or if the Covenant was God's presence went with it amen and as they gave them God's Ark of the Covenant the preeminence that Jehovah would be there amen and the promise the ability he says I am now been ordained to be king over Israel and if I am to be king over Israel we're gonna put God in his proper position hey man we're gonna put gone his proper position is he saw God ascending up on that hill being put in his proper place he sung he danced he praised God why because he knew the the potential he knew the opportunity finally after hundreds of years after Moses were finally going to have God in proper position we're going to finally have taken over all the enemy of the land we're gonna fight every battle we're gonna destroy every enemy amen the land will be at peace again amen we will enter into the very thing that Moses wanted to do the very thing that Joshua wanted to do amen we are to experience all the promises of God be made manifest Jehovah is with us Jehovah is in his proper position Jehovah has the preeminence in the land what a place that's why there are so many songs written you know the thing of it is you can't properly sing the songs of Zion until you've experienced the deliverance of Zion hey man you know no man can really sing the songs that we sing in this church a man with a gladness with a joy in his heart until he's first seeing victories until he's first been in a place where he couldn't deliver himself anymore but he reached his hand up unto Jehovah and Jehovah delivered him he meant a man can never really properly sing the songs of Zion they tell his first witness God going into battle with him Amen but once a man has seen God going to battle for him Amen that man now has something to sing about a man that man now has something to dance about that man can now pick up the tambourine that man can now sing about God why because he's seen Jehovah in action he's seeing what the Lord Jesus Christ can do amen a mess one thing when you first come to the Lord to worship God but wait till you've been a Christian for a while and you've been through the hard battles you've been through the hard trials you've been through the things you didn't know you can make it through but you lifted up your hand unto Jehovah he delivered you he brought you out of the deep miry clay amen let God arise God did arise in your life you saw God arise in your life and you saw that all of your enemies were scattered then you have something to sing about and that is what is so and oppressing about psalms 137 is that they knew all the songs but they forgot to keep Jehovah in his proper place and it wasn't that Jehovah had changed but they had changed they themselves had changed and there they set in bondage because they no longer had God fighting for them and God had given them up to their own sins amen what a difference between the time of David and the time of the captivity but Jehovah was the same all along amen the only thing of it is is God at prophesizes you're going into captivity for 70 years but I will come back to you because whenever God's people go into captivity if you ever find yourself in bondage if you ever find yourself trapped in sin when you start doing wrong and you won't repent and you keep going the same way same way and all sudden consequences catch up with you amen when God's consequences catch up with you and you begin to reap what you have sowed and you think oh no I wanted to play with sin but I didn't want this to happen I wanted to be able to sing God's songs but I also wanted to be able to do the the wickedness of Babylon and when God wants the quizes start catching up with you and you begin to be caught up into bondage for your own sins and you can no longer sing you could keep singing those song as God's deliverance but you yourself have bound the revival Giver amen and no longer will God is God fighting your battles for you God has a promise of return amen you might go through a time of troubles of time of trials because God when you go we trample over God's laws there are consequences amen but God always has a way of return amen amen if they're being Buddy here that is is is going through consequences right now of your own actions let me tell you God does have a path of return it's a way it's a path it's a return to righteousness amen because if a people ever find themselves in bondage to where they can no longer God as dog or fighting their battles for them they're captive to their own sins to their own iniquities they have done wrong they no they've done wrong and they're not sure how they get back God has a way provided to come back amen and there it is only one way there is only one way back it's there's there's not more than one way there is only one way of return when you find yourself in that condition and and the only way you could ever return in that condition is to get down on your knees and run quickly to Jesus Christ and cry out to him and say Oh Lord if you would be willing to set me free Lord I I know that you have a right to send me to hell that I have a right after trampling over the grace of Lord Jesus Christ after trampling over the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ after all he's done for you and you go contrary to his laws and trample on his sayings anyway and now you find yourself in bondage the only one thing you can do is run quickly to him for mercy amen and if he should desire to bring you back again it will only be through through through repentance it will only be through crying out a man let's turn over to Daniel chapter 9 Daniel chapter 9 takes place about 68 years after Psalms 137 about 68 years after they found themselves at the river of Babylon they've now dwelled their generation and it's coming back for a time of return God had a sign that on the 70th year that they would go back or would they go back to they would return to righteousness they would go back to Zion to that holy hill they'd go back to the place to where God would drink would rain and have the preeminence but the only way they could go back to where God has the preeminence they first have to go through a path of repentance the path back to the return to righteousness you can only go down that path by the way of repentance amen you can only go down that path the path to return to righteousness to return to Zion goes by it goes through the way through the valley of repentance a man Daniel chapter 9 says in verse 2 and the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years where the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the Prophet that he would accomplish seventy years and the desolations of Jerusalem he's understanding his time to go back amen and he's understanding there's one thing he has to do before he goes back amen and he says and I set my face under the Lord to seek by prayer and supplications with fasting and sackcloth and ashes and I prayed unto the Lord my God and I made my confession and said O Lord the Great and dreadful God keeping the Covenant and mercy to them that love him and to them that keep his Commandments verse five we have sinned and commit iniquity and have done wickedly and have rebelled even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments neither neither have we hearken unto thy servants the prophets which spake and thy name to our Kings our Prince's our fathers and to all the people of the land Oh Lord righteousness belongeth unto thee but unto us confusion of faces amen let's just stop right there they were there because of their own sins righteousness belongs to the Lord and if you ever want to go back under righteousness you have to go by it through the valley of repentance for amen if by chance that somehow they God would allow you the opportunity to return a return to righteousness amen amen because if you find yourself singing the songs of Zion while you're living in Babylon you are doing worse and those that went into captivity for they themselves said how can we do it how can we sing how can we sing the Lord's songs while we are bound and in captivity but yet we will trample with hobnail shoes or angels fear to try how can we sing the songs of God's deliverance how can we say that he's brought us up out of the deep miry clay when we know that our feet are still in the deep miry clay amen how can we say that let God arise and all of his enemies will be scattered when the enemy is in our life is not scattered amen how can we say how can we sing as the deer panteth for the water so my soul longeth after thee when you know in your heart that you are not longing for the Lord at all amen amen we do worse than those Amen that were in bondage amen but God always has a path of return hey man now just here in closing I want to I want to go through some of those some of those let's turn toward a Amos I just wanna read the end of some of these chapters all of these prophets were prophesying you know there's multiple stages of Israel's captivity you know as they went into the you know the few tribes going to kept you there the ten tribes here and a few tribes there and there was multiple stages and every stage God would always send a prophet to warn them amen and as they would be disobedient to that prophet God would sin the judgment and they go into captivity hey you know in the beginning of each chapter of each of these chat of these books of these what they call the minor prophets there's always a judgment but at the end God always has path of return hey man so let's read Amos chapter 9 and it says verse 14 and it says I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel and they shall build the way cities and inhabit them they shall plant the vineyards and drink the wine thereof they shall also make gardens and eat the fruit of them and I'll plant them upon their land and they shall be no more pulled up out of their land which I have given them amen us go forward to Micah is about three books forward Micah chapter 7 verse 18 says who is a God like unto thee that pardon if iniquity and passes by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage he retain athough because he delighteth in mercy he will turn again he will have compassion upon us he will subdue our iniquities and that will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea and that will perform the truth to Jacob and the mercy to Abraham that which thou has sworn unto our fathers from the days of old amen now let's go forward to Zephaniah it's about four books forward Zephaniah three verse 18 I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly who are of thee to whom the reproach of it was a burden behold at that time I will undo all that afflict thee I'll save her that halted I'll gather her that was driven out and I'll get them praise and fame in every Lane where they had been put to shame and at that time I will bring you again even in the time that I gather you I'll make you a name and a praise among all the people of the earth when I turn back your captivity before your eyes Amen you know the Gentile church has gone into captivity amen and gone has pulled out a people for his namesake he has called them out by his huge amount by the prophets amen amen as he caught us called out our bride for his namesake they here we are the final people at the final age a man with a the message of the last prophet amen and as we sit here we have no right to be trampling and going back to Babylon Amen but we of all people ought to be standing steadfast in righteousness steadfast in holiness without which no man shall see God amen amen but violet Hebrews 12 says but follow a peace with all men and righteousness without which no man shall see God Amen if you want to see God in your life if you want to have the preeminence of God in your life then you have to go through the path of righteousness amen but that is only through the valley of repentance that you get there God has a promise of return to you Amen a path back to righteousness but you must go through the valley of repentance to get there Amy if you ever once want to see revival in your life if you want to stand where day visits it is you have to go through the battles the David with whom he meant amen if you want to stay if you want to sing the songs of victory the dammit saying you cannot sing them while you're standing in Babylon you never once will be able to sing those songs of victory while standing on Babylon soil amen you must first come back through the valley of repentance amen the return your righteousness for every departure there is a return amen and God always chooses the river busting to separate you from the things that are behind you amen there's got to be a clean cut Amen that River Babylon when they crossed over it they were cut off from Zion mmm but God offered them a path to return amen and they saw it they came back amen so does God offer every one of you a path to return a mental way back to Zions Hill where I can have the preeminence in your life once more amen but you'll you'll find it on your knees and your buddies amen let's just stand you know as they were crying out there and by the river they weren't cried out for the borderland no they were crying out for God's presence and God's holy temple amen they didn't want to just go hang out along the river Jordan they wanted to come back to worship God upon his hill Zion hey man so is us we don't want to just come back to where we think we're halfway right with God we need to come back to where we could say it was surely God is raining upon the throne of your heart where you know that you're being about your father's business amen in him you move and live and have your being they meant where God reigns upon your heart we don't want to just go to the borderland we want to be where God's Rush is rushing upon the tops of the mulberry trees where we have learned to wait before we go into battle Lord do you want me to go and fight against him or going to wait here and Gus says wait until you hear me upon the scene when you see me moving upon your heart then you can go upon battle amen then I will fight for you amen and God has that experience for you when you're on the path to return amen so let us go back but before we go back we have to first do what Daniel did he says it's been 68 years it's almost time to go back and like so we say God has prepared for himself a bride amen and she has made herself ready and we are in the day of making ourselves ready that means we have something to do amen God it wasn't that that in the last days God will make the bride ready but in the last days she will make herself ready how does she do that she chooses the harder path amen she chooses to do the hard things she chooses when all of her flesh says go this way she makes her choice no I will go the way on the path of righteousness I will return unto Jehovah I will return unto the worship of the Lord Jesus Christ I will sing the songs of Zion upon God's holy hill and righteousness peace and joy and the Holy Ghost I will make myself ready how will she do it God has sent her a word a message a prophet amen and she will listen to that word amen and she will make herself ready how will she do it she'll come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins that her iniquities do not cling to you for she for Babylon is a as a cage of every unclean and hateful bird and it ought not to be in your homes and your houses and your dwelling places a man and as the things as the things of Babylon ought not to live there he meant Hollywood doesn't belong in your house wickedness doesn't belong in your house why because God has judged those things they meant and as God has judged those things we take the harder way we say Lord I'm returning to righteousness Lord I'm making myself ready I want my garment to be she does the laundry they meant her garments are spotless amen if their babies spot there as she takes the blood of Jesus Christ and she pleads the blood of Jesus over her garments if their being a wrinkle she takes it to the fire of the Holy Ghost amen and by the heat of the fire the wrinkles are smooth out Amen by the great iron that God has created and she stands there a pure and righteous bride a holy man's wife amen that's what she'll do it's been prophesied and then even as Daniel stood there brother Branham said that that Daniel got and got a people ready to go back to Zion I'm getting you know people ready to go up in a rapture that just as much as Daniel got his people ready to go to him back to the return from Babylon I am getting my people ready to return to the heavens where they came he said I had a similar ministry and so we won't be faithful we're standing we're not there we're not in the days where we've just crossed over but we're in the days to return and we're going to return to righteousness peace and joy and the Holy Ghost but he doesn't just push us through a tube we get it through the valley of repentance through the valley of crying out to the Lord Jesus Christ forgive me Lord for I have sinned I've done that which is wrong amen forgive me Lord I you said go to the right and I went to the left forgive me Lord I you said to do this and I didn't do it he told me not to do this and I did it anyway Lord I want to go back I want to return to righteousness I won't be ready when you come amen like Enoch I want to walk with you I wanted these days my walk will go up a little bit higher and I will enter into your gates with Thanksgiving I'll enter into his courts with praise and I'll sing the songs of Zion upon that land and I will never leave again Amen let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we're looking forward to that day Lord or will we enter into your gates with Thanksgiving I can see my feet now walking into your courts with praise Lord and you'll give us a song of deliverance that none has ever sung before or will sing a song like Enochs son more than when you wrote when we realize that we have been delivered when in a moment in the twinkling of an eye we've been changed from this vile body and you set us free from this this sticky flesh floor that grabs all these things of the earth Lord and we enter into your gates Lord for that three and a half year honeymoon with you Lord Lord oh wow what will we sing what will we say though we can only imagine what it'll be like on that day father we will enter into your gates Lord with Thanksgiving and praise Lord for you have set us free and we will sing the songs of Zion where they ought to be sung where they are meant to be sung in clete complete victory Lord as we are called the overcomers and we get to sit with you and your throne Lord we're looking forward to it as we stand where daniel stood where he realized it's time to go back father we pray lord we know lord this time to return it's time to go into rapture and your bride is making herself ready lord and in order to make ourselves ready we have to go through the valley of repentance father or we want to examine every speck every spot we want to do the laundry Lord taking out every spot and smoothing every wrinkle Lord we can only do it with your blood and with your fire father and we ask lord have mercy upon us for we've sinned Lord we've done things that are out of the way Lord forgive us father bring us back to righteousness bring us let us return back let's go back to Zion to sing the songs were they ought to be sung Lord not in bondage but a complete victory for we've heard you in the tops of the mulberry trees before we want to hear you in the top of the mulberry trees again Lord and when we hear that rushing we'll know that you are with us when the rushing comes father because you always appear with a sound of rushing mighty wind and Lord let it happen to us once more in the name of Jesus Christ Lord we pray as we return to righteousness peace and joy and Holy Ghost that a beach your bride we pray and the name of Jesus Christ we pray do you believe he's able to do that a man I do you believe it's possible a man do you believe that it see that was the thing about him is when God makes a promise there is a path for that promise to be made manifest amen is just as sure as he has a promised land then there is a land where all of his promises are made manifest a man God still has a promised land for you and he has a possibility of you returning to righteousness to where the promise of God are made manifest in your life where this Bible is a living book amen and to where you are the spotless bride of Lord Jesus Christ and it's not just a something that's going to happen way off in the future but no it's not you it's in your mouth amen amen god bless you brother Isaac if you come sing a few songs brother rich will take up the offering a man you may desire to prayer amen you're welcome to come up amen god bless you in the presence of Jehovah [Music] Joe Oh Oh God oh my - Oh Prince of Peace Oh troubles me me Oh heart of Maine [Music] the prey is [Music] the King once again amen Oh in the prayer oh yeah
