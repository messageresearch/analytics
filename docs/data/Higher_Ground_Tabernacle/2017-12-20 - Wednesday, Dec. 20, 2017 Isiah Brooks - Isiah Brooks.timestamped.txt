[0:00] the skin worms destroy this body yet in
[0:02] my flesh shall see God right he knew
[0:06] there was coming forth a day of
[0:08] resurrection in the last days right last
[0:11] 2000 years my redeemer shall stand upon
[0:15] the earth
[0:16] now listen no Wanda David cried out my
[0:20] flesh shall rest in hope because he will
[0:23] not suffer my Holy One to see corruption
[0:26] neither will he leave his soul in Hell I
[0:30] love that hallelujah because if God
[0:33] could not allow Jesus real body its
[0:36] natural body to see corruption he will
[0:39] not allow us to see corruption
[0:41] who is his body hallelujah it got good
[0:46] see all of these things put back to
[0:49] Calvary then and you said it lays a
[0:52] complete salvation
[0:53] she excuse me in Jesus lays the
[0:56] completion or the complete of salvation
[0:58] the complete of divine healing if there
[1:01] is no divine healing now there is no
[1:03] resurrection of the day that doesn't
[1:06] take a scientist understand that
[1:08] hallelujah if God surely can't heal you
[1:11] he definitely can't get you about Anna
[1:13] GREs especially if you've been there for
[1:15] a long time
[1:17] is that Alright she we must look toward
[1:21] the promise that's what we got to do you
[1:24] can't look at the symptoms brothers
[1:26] sisters you this flash is evil you think
[1:29] you're gonna convert it it will never be
[1:31] converted
[1:33] hallelujah until God comes and change it
[1:35] so you gonna deal with this to Jesus
[1:38] come well praise God I pull of the holy
[1:41] goes well that's true but when you come
[1:44] to a statue of a perfect man then you
[1:46] were silence it yummy huh because that
[1:53] divine love conquers all that's the
[1:56] Bible that's the only way we'll be able
[1:59] to silence the devil because when the
[2:01] devil come with us at those things he
[2:03] can't accuse you he can't accuse your
[2:06] brother to you he can't even make your
[2:08] angry at your brother or your sister you
[2:11] hear me right because that love has
[2:12] captivated
[2:13] you so much you see the devil behind him
[2:18] it's amazing I'm excited you know how we
[2:23] were little children and we oh I can't
[2:25] hardly wait to I'll become an adult and
[2:27] then will become an adult which at all I
[2:29] just wish I could go back amen
[2:34] but in this case it's something in the
[2:37] bride of Jesus Christ that makes us
[2:39] groan you know we groaning right now we
[2:42] will literally literally groaning like
[2:45] God even save me from this place of Hell
[2:48] y'all to say it that way it is we know
[2:53] by God's grace that hell is blending
[2:55] into Earth amen doubt those two
[2:57] dimensions are bringing themselves
[2:58] together so you and I cannot expect it
[3:01] to get better it's going to get worse
[3:05] these Christians that we dealing with
[3:09] right now you know I don't know how
[3:10] we're gonna make it if the Church of God
[3:13] don't get down on their knees and pray
[3:15] that's where your victory I'm telling
[3:18] you the victory is in prayer you don't
[3:21] believe me go listen to the message what
[3:23] here at our Elijah he's got two of them
[3:26] and I tell you what it's in prayer and
[3:29] this is why the devil fights us so much
[3:31] because he doesn't want us to get up I
[3:34] don't know what call you a routine but
[3:36] he doesn't want you to get that prayer
[3:37] closet going hallelujah let me say like
[3:42] this even larger needed a cave you need
[3:45] one
[3:46] hallelujah shame Jezebel coming up to
[3:49] you right any larger rare from Jezebel
[3:55] when he didn't have the anointing with
[3:57] him who we look to his promise is that
[4:04] right see no matter listen no matter how
[4:07] much this and that and the other you got
[4:10] to have something strike you see what
[4:13] I'm saying
[4:13] in other words you gotta know when it
[4:16] when God strike you he's there you can
[4:19] jump you can shout you can do all you
[4:21] want to but until he changed your hearts
[4:23] mind you got to have a
[4:27] change in your hearts mind right he said
[4:31] listen he said you got to have something
[4:34] strike your brother vital that settles
[4:37] it forever that's faith Jesus is the
[4:40] high priest of your confession and
[4:41] whatever you confess that he'll do right
[4:47] if you say I'm a hypocrite that's what
[4:49] you are
[4:50] if you say I'm the Bride of Christ
[4:52] that's who you are
[4:53] and you may not even look like the Bride
[4:56] of Christ but you have angels standing
[4:59] by you waiting to hear you say it so
[5:02] they can move on the scene but you saw
[5:05] all Brotherhood's I don't have divine
[5:07] love but you know we need to start
[5:09] confessing it lord I've got divine love
[5:12] because when you start confessing it
[5:15] those angels have to bring something
[5:17] forth to put you in that position who
[5:20] you know out there in the world or any
[5:22] other church who can who can say they
[5:24] have divine love name it and claim it
[5:30] hallelujah you got to get real with this
[5:33] thing it is serious a lot of people look
[5:38] at symptoms and you say well brother
[5:40] Branham my hair is no no straighter I'd
[5:43] never be it'll never be as long as you
[5:45] look at it hey God then you don't came
[5:49] up for healing and you look and you said
[5:51] well God says your hand you you were
[5:54] healed
[5:54] in your arm cooking like that and you
[5:56] said well uh it ain't no straighter oh
[5:59] he said you'll never get it well you're
[6:02] looking at the symptoms hallelujah and
[6:05] that's the that's the truth I heard
[6:07] somebody else preach this it is so good
[6:09] they said oh you pray for your baby and
[6:12] your baby's temperature is 103 and you
[6:14] paint pray for the baby and then you go
[6:16] back to check it and see weathers went
[6:19] down you didn't have faith hallelujah
[6:25] and if it goes down you said where the
[6:27] Lord done he'll you have the Lord healed
[6:29] before the temperature went down under
[6:34] the temperature don't go down what do
[6:35] you do you still say he'll see but if
[6:39] you don't have that kind of faith take
[6:41] him to the doctor I'll play with it yeah
[6:45] don't hope you go get well you got to
[6:48] know something must strike you in order
[6:51] for you that's faith when that strikes
[6:53] you the devil has no chance why because
[6:58] God has given you a revelation that that
[7:00] baby will be healed I just don't like
[7:03] people playing with babies and playing
[7:05] you know with their own faith and no
[7:07] they ain't got it take it to the doctor
[7:10] talk about symptoms look at Jonah down
[7:14] in the belly of the whale if anybody
[7:16] could have had symptoms
[7:18] he had them back slidden had ties by
[7:21] ties behind him on the sea a storm
[7:24] coming up pitched him out whale
[7:25] swallowed him up went to the bottom row
[7:27] seeing fish in a fish went in and they
[7:30] will he fare he feeds he goes and
[7:33] resting in the bottom of the sea and
[7:35] there he was down there with a belly
[7:38] full of backslidden preacher well live
[7:44] down there on the bank down there under
[7:47] the sea a storm on the seatbacks land
[7:50] what a condition he was he looked this
[7:53] away it was whales belly he looked that
[7:56] away it was whales belly everywhere he
[7:59] looked it was whales belly you know what
[8:01] he said he said I'm not looking at the
[8:04] whales belly
[8:05] they're lying Vanity's holiday we huh
[8:09] I'm not going to look at this not this
[8:13] it's a lying vanity y'all better hear me
[8:17] your flesh is aligned vanity God conquer
[8:22] death hell and the grave for you
[8:25] it's a liar it's the shadow of death
[8:28] hallelujah
[8:29] but I feel no evil
[8:32] hallelujah you see this is where we must
[8:35] understand Satan is trying to deceive us
[8:37] and lessen our faith by our action by
[8:40] what we look in that hallelujah
[8:43] oh come on somebody when I was growing
[8:46] taller I did not see myself growing
[8:48] taller until I had to perhaps here try
[8:52] up here pea system something made me
[8:54] know I had grown taller but I never
[8:57] could see that hallelujah so how if you
[9:01] can't notice it in the natural how you
[9:03] notice it in the spiritual you gotta
[9:07] trust God except the Lord builds a house
[9:10] made that labor Labor's in vain
[9:13] right except the watchman you know what
[9:16] listen you gotta understand God is in
[9:19] one who's your watchman he must be if
[9:24] you the watchman now the Bible said pray
[9:26] watch and pray we're watching and
[9:28] praying right but you got to understand
[9:29] that there are angels that are
[9:30] commissioned to watch and pray for you
[9:37] just okay
[9:39] lying fantasies he said Lord once more
[9:41] look at your holy temple why did you see
[9:44] the way he's seeing God's temple right
[9:48] that's what we need to realize him and
[9:50] we must always look to Jesus Christ and
[9:53] Calvary hallelujah when that looks like
[9:56] amen these are overwhelming us and it
[9:58] looked like we're not gonna get out of
[10:00] this place hallelujah
[10:01] we must realize Amen that there was one
[10:04] who has already paid the price and he's
[10:07] already told you that your names are on
[10:09] the Lamb's Book of Life you gotta have
[10:12] faith it's true because some of us I
[10:19] know when out here thinking well praise
[10:20] the Lord I'm gonna be perfect
[10:22] and we all of a sudden went in that
[10:26] natural mode thinking you go conquer the
[10:28] devil in your natural knows that he
[10:34] knows you just gone on a full ride the
[10:39] only way you'll be able to talk to him
[10:41] is through prayer hallelujah
[10:44] oh because prayer
[10:46] changes things you cannot add a cubit to
[10:49] your statue
[10:50] it takes the Lord Jesus Christ he is the
[10:54] builder but you got to want the building
[10:57] you know I mean you gotta want it you
[11:00] gotta ask for it every day you ought to
[11:05] have that that statue of a perfect man
[11:08] before you Lord add to me don't you can
[11:12] add it but how you going how's it gonna
[11:15] be added if you don't ask him with
[11:17] sincerity
[11:18] this is what I want hello not when the
[11:21] trials come don't want about it you ask
[11:24] for it right because these virtues are
[11:27] not something that's so freely given to
[11:29] you you've got to battle it is a victory
[11:34] hallelujah and I won't God to show me
[11:37] where I am so I know where I need to go
[11:43] that's the beauty of it remember brother
[11:46] Branham told a joke to one of his
[11:49] friends and his friend went back and
[11:51] told his wife to joke and his wife got
[11:54] offended I know brother Branham ain't
[11:56] telling no jokes he said God did that so
[12:00] that he could stop joking yeah it became
[12:06] a stumbling block you see what I'm
[12:08] saying he said no I was wrong by doing
[12:12] that
[12:12] ya hear what I'm saying so it it's God
[12:15] duty to put something in your way to
[12:17] make you stumble or fall so you know
[12:22] where you are maybe we're doing
[12:25] something we don't know it's wrong
[12:26] God will it's his duty to make us know
[12:29] that it's wrong
[12:31] that's what I'm saying he allowed it and
[12:36] that's what the problem said God allowed
[12:39] that to happen to show me right I don't
[12:46] want to think I'm standing in a knot you
[12:50] know I look at those those are virtues
[12:52] you see what brother boots that's all in
[12:55] the hole of those absolutely it's only
[12:57] one seed in you but you are the
[12:59] that's responsible when it comes to
[13:02] letting God right because remember when
[13:08] when the Jews came back from Babylon and
[13:10] they were building the wall and symbolic
[13:11] them demons amen was right out there to
[13:13] stop them from building it hallelujah
[13:17] guess what
[13:18] Amen you got to realize that everybody
[13:20] they say they're in the message is not
[13:22] in the message because these were have
[13:24] Jews some of them don't you love the
[13:28] Lord you gotta watch who's trying to
[13:30] stop you from getting to the top now you
[13:35] tell you know now we do we do experience
[13:41] not talk about individuals we're talking
[13:44] about spirits accept the Lord feels the
[13:47] house I'm glad he's building it cuz I
[13:52] know if he builds it it's gonna be
[13:53] perfect is that right
[13:55] he's the one that's packing the boxcar
[13:58] hallelujah and he's gonna rather you
[14:00] till nothing else nothing in you can be
[14:02] rattled that means the storms and the
[14:04] trials going to come until you become a
[14:06] Superman or superwoman but either way
[14:09] you have Christ in you that's what we
[14:12] want we want the Lord to build a house
[14:15] right he said when the temple was
[14:18] dedicated Solomon prayed I said Lord
[14:19] when the Holy Ghost come in and that
[14:22] fire settles down behind the holy place
[14:24] if that people be in trouble anywhere
[14:28] and pray then you hear from heaven
[14:30] listen you and I must understand
[14:33] nothing can stop your prayer once you
[14:36] pray it doesn't matter if you at the
[14:38] bottom of the sea in a whale's belly
[14:41] right because when you pray you say well
[14:45] how do you know I mean how did Jonah
[14:47] uh-uh-uh-uh-uh know that he was facing
[14:49] the temple the prophet of God said when
[14:51] he started to pray that the prayer made
[14:54] the whale turned toward the temple oh my
[15:02] god and you and I was realized by the
[15:05] grace of God nothing can stop your
[15:07] prayer
[15:09] hello even our prayers some of our
[15:13] prayers God should take us to the grave
[15:14] right now your prayers still goes on and
[15:17] God will answer those prayer nothing can
[15:20] stop your prayer hallelujah is that
[15:26] Alright she don't believe that God hurts
[15:30] Solomon's prayer and he said I look to
[15:32] your temple and it made that oh well
[15:34] kind of feel funny
[15:36] and God put an oxygen tank down there
[15:38] and kept him alive three days and took
[15:40] him right on over to Nineveh you and I
[15:46] have no idea what that was like I don't
[15:48] think any of us want that experience
[15:50] either hey hey so you and I must
[15:53] understand except the Lord build the
[15:56] house and I'm gonna keep saying that
[15:57] because after for the Jesse preached
[16:00] that just struck me that scripture right
[16:02] there and I was telling him that he
[16:04] thought about that that's Scripture
[16:06] you know applying I'm like yes I mean we
[16:10] can't do this God can it takes humility
[16:15] it takes a man to Humble himself to say
[16:19] I can't that's that's a good place to be
[16:22] because when you go before God says law
[16:24] I don't can't do it I don't know how to
[16:26] do it then God will come you said what
[16:30] brother books are you certain see I'm
[16:31] gonna tell you something and this is not
[16:34] to make it sound bad but it's the truth
[16:35] I knew people who was in the thunders
[16:37] and they said that the seven virtues are
[16:39] was the seven thunders and all of that
[16:41] and I could see where they're going with
[16:42] it but you know they what they did they
[16:44] did some things with their shouldn't and
[16:46] what was the people doing they were
[16:48] trying to add these virtues and just
[16:52] call shipwreck it caused confusion it
[16:56] caused legal listen it caused pride
[16:58] because when you think you have achieved
[17:00] something then it has a tendency of
[17:03] looking down on somebody else but you
[17:05] see when God does it you know it's the
[17:07] grace of God and then your love extend
[17:09] toward the brother who's not reached it
[17:11] yet
[17:20] because the true statue of a christ will
[17:23] not bring : ISM worker you know what I
[17:26] mean
[17:27] colonising right when a person wants to
[17:31] denominator selves and put themselves in
[17:33] such a colony that is against the world
[17:36] of the Iowa even to bring division among
[17:42] the church is that right was it Peter
[17:46] dude I can't remember the scripture
[17:48] supposing that they had the Holy Ghost a
[17:50] true man of God will not divide a church
[17:55] if he disagree he leads but when he
[17:59] divides her charge and make disciples
[18:01] unto himself he is not under the
[18:03] inspiration of the Holy Ghost Oh what
[18:07] are you saying brother remember Moses
[18:09] was chosen by God Dave didn't Korah and
[18:13] when they brought in heresies trees and
[18:18] dogmas and what happened they all died
[18:22] it just making sense so you understand
[18:25] that the more you are you get closer to
[18:31] God the more your denominational walls
[18:34] will fall hello
[18:37] come on somebody see how used to be in
[18:40] those denominations different ones and I
[18:42] was a Christian being you say no you
[18:45] wasn't yes Iowa I'll be honest with you
[18:48] I was a Christian before the foundation
[18:49] of the world my Christianity didn't
[18:53] start with the Baptist Church you know
[18:57] and that's what we fail to see if
[18:59] somebody is he like today elected and
[19:01] none of your thoughts against them can
[19:04] change anything you can't tell me that
[19:07] God can't bring a man out of a Baptist
[19:10] Church right on into this message took
[19:12] me out of the Baptist Church out from
[19:14] the Baptist Church I went to the
[19:15] Methodist Church from the Methodist
[19:17] Church I went to the Catholic Church
[19:19] from the Catholic Church I went to the
[19:20] Apostolic Church and Here I am still a
[19:23] journey but God led me in all of that ah
[19:27] to realize there are differences but
[19:30] know that everybody that love
[19:33] Lord and have confessed with their mouth
[19:35] and believed in their heart to the
[19:37] saving of their soul is say wood now
[19:41] they don't trust in a denomination
[19:43] they're not trusting their bishops or
[19:45] their pastors they're trusting in the
[19:46] blood of Jesus Christ it doesn't mean
[19:48] they're make rapture but they are saved
[19:52] according to the Word of God they are
[19:55] and you can't take that from them either
[19:58] look dressing like well there's a lot of
[20:01] people that's dressing holy and filthy
[20:06] hallelujah
[20:07] come on is that Scripture Oh Pharisees
[20:10] and Sadducees and all of them y'all
[20:14] looking at me like I'm crazy get
[20:16] anything out with gamma that makes you
[20:18] holy
[20:18] it's the n-word that gives you the
[20:20] holiness now if you holy you got hold it
[20:23] goes you're gonna begin the dress holy
[20:25] y'all understand what I'm saying
[20:27] you're not gonna say how I got the holy
[20:29] girls like I should like you should have
[20:31] because listening
[20:32] holy goes where we're talking about now
[20:34] you might be a babe just came to Christ
[20:36] you don't I mean you may not know about
[20:38] sanctification right but if you got the
[20:42] real Holy Ghost he gonna tell you that
[20:43] ain't right no man had to teach me about
[20:47] shorts God showed me that took that come
[20:51] off me in the public ran to my house I
[20:56] was in swimming trunks getting ready to
[20:58] do my favorite thing swim oh lord have
[21:03] mercy and I had just been baptized in
[21:04] the name of the Lord Jesus by early I'm
[21:08] just telling you that's me that's what
[21:09] God did for me now let's go on this is
[21:12] something that brother Randy and I was
[21:14] discussing today and I said I've got to
[21:15] you that first King 6 & 7 in the house
[21:19] when it was in building was built of
[21:22] strong made ready before it was brought
[21:24] thinner so that there was neither hammer
[21:27] nor axe
[21:28] no any tools iron heard in the house
[21:32] while it was in building that means no
[21:37] man had anything to do with this
[21:39] building no man's hand God had already
[21:43] cut them strong hallelujah
[21:46] and when they were transported everybody
[21:49] every strong I don't know how they had
[21:51] the blueprint laid out but every stone
[21:54] fit exactly talk about a jigsaw puzzle
[21:57] oh wow
[22:00] and I've been to Egypt you know that
[22:04] that layout that they had that really
[22:06] reflected the Sun and everything else
[22:08] you know they don't took that goal and
[22:09] everything off that so you've got all
[22:13] this rough stone and when you see how
[22:15] huge some of these stones are you think
[22:17] to yourself there is no way anybody
[22:20] could have done this without some kind
[22:22] of laser supernatural thing I don't even
[22:26] know if they used horses and cots to
[22:28] bring those big stones from weather I
[22:30] don't know how they did it but my point
[22:33] is they had a destiny and that destiny
[22:37] no matter where they were built or cut
[22:39] away wherever they came from
[22:41] they had a destiny and that destiny was
[22:44] right there in Egypt who scientists and
[22:50] I don't know how true this is but they
[22:52] said scientists say that where this this
[22:54] this this a pyramid stands it's where
[22:57] the real Garden of Eden was I don't know
[23:00] how true that is all I know is that
[23:02] Jesus visited it he went right into
[23:06] Egypt before he came to Bethlehem and
[23:09] Jerusalem or whatever you understand me
[23:12] my point is Amit when it comes to the
[23:15] stones there are no extra stones they
[23:23] couldn't say well oh I like this song
[23:25] better than the other no sir and they
[23:27] could say well this stone is not shaped
[23:29] and cut right every strong though they
[23:31] were cut differently was right
[23:33] hallelujah so you understand God don't
[23:37] have any cookie cutters we're all
[23:39] different
[23:40] we're cut different but we're part of
[23:43] the same body yeah you know so many
[23:50] people believe that if people don't
[23:51] don't tell believe this message they're
[23:54] lost well what happened to the foolish
[23:57] virgins
[24:00] they don't believe it they don't believe
[24:03] it enough to get the Holy Ghost and
[24:06] that's what real belief is to know that
[24:08] you need more of God right I mean you
[24:12] look at this thing is well what about
[24:13] those ones who never heard some way I
[24:17] saw where brother Brown said that God
[24:18] will deal with their consciousness even
[24:21] if it's a tribe in Africa wherever they
[24:23] are whatever their laws were and those
[24:26] that stood for the word I was close to
[24:28] what God commanded and the people obey
[24:31] those laws grace is given to them in
[24:38] that okay so I want you to understand no
[24:42] man's I can't cut rich
[24:45] I can't chisel him ain't nothing I can
[24:48] do to help him it's the invisible
[24:51] carpenter it's Jesus Christ right oh you
[24:54] might say what brother Brooks I just
[24:55] wish you to have more patience but you
[24:57] can't give it give me no more patience
[24:59] you just got to have patience that deal
[25:03] with me not having patience y'all hear
[25:06] what I'm saying I just wish you know you
[25:08] know maybe you know it would be too easy
[25:11] but God won't somebody who loves
[25:14] disappearing huh
[25:17] because that's what it's all about the
[25:19] building of the statute of crisis for
[25:21] Christ amen is when God was appearing
[25:25] listen I believe brother I said you came
[25:28] him understand the seven seals without
[25:29] understanding the seven churches and
[25:32] each one of the church ages had virtue
[25:35] all the way up they had to meet the
[25:39] criteria he said even when it came to
[25:41] Paul's day or Ephesus he said up no he
[25:45] said Luther he said Luther he said all
[25:47] those people that came out with Luther
[25:49] but everybody didn't get they didn't
[25:51] come to Luther's measurement the just
[25:54] shall live by faith
[25:54] no he said some of them carried on but
[25:59] they didn't have it so what are you
[26:01] saying I'm saying there's a lot of
[26:03] people in this message won't won't reach
[26:06] perfect law oh I'm in the message but
[26:10] you got to reach perfect law
[26:13] how do I read see that's the point
[26:16] yeah God reveals to you like he did joke
[26:20] it's a revelation that God gives you
[26:23] that you gonna make it
[26:24] he even reveals to you how to make it
[26:29] otherwise you just like the Lutheran's
[26:31] who thought they were Lutheran's
[26:34] everybody that follow West the West
[26:36] Wesley didn't come up to a place where
[26:39] they were sanctified no but they were
[26:42] Wesleyan see but when God reveals to you
[26:47] and how you know he's gonna reveal to
[26:49] you cuz when you really receive the Holy
[26:51] Ghost that I think God gives you the
[26:54] real Holy Ghost
[26:56] hallelujah you said well did I speak in
[26:59] tongues you don't have to that run up
[27:01] and down the ad you don't have to but
[27:03] when it strikes your soul that you say
[27:05] nobody can take it from you and that is
[27:08] the foundation of faith that takes you
[27:11] up this ladder but the world doesn't
[27:18] know that only the bride she's the one
[27:24] that's adorning herself and making
[27:27] herself ready you sure what are you
[27:29] saying yeah there's a little work you
[27:31] got to do guarding a little just pull
[27:33] you through the two that barrel II meant
[27:35] after that that a rancher son that
[27:40] Rancher son Amen when he says I want you
[27:43] to marry me she didn't just say well I'm
[27:45] I was sitting in my lounge chair and
[27:47] wait to he returned Oh
[27:48] she worked and saved her nickels
[27:52] hallelujah so you got a little work to
[27:54] do
[27:55] right oh come on somebody the Bible said
[27:58] if you resist the devil here flee from
[28:00] you huh you said there's another story
[28:06] remember the learning lady who went
[28:08] overseas I've got what country with
[28:10] Ireland or somewhere she was an artist
[28:12] and she had the guy had proposed to her
[28:16] and while she was in school everybody
[28:19] went out partying and getting drunk like
[28:21] Americans do I think it was France at
[28:23] whatever world but the point is this
[28:26] old man this elderly man saw her that
[28:29] she wasn't part of these groups and one
[28:31] day he saw her standing at the fence
[28:32] looking looking out Westwood and he came
[28:35] he says I basically I'm not trying to
[28:37] pry on your business you know but I want
[28:40] to know why you're not joining everybody
[28:41] else and she says because over there
[28:44] there's a certain land and in that
[28:46] certain man there's a certain city and
[28:48] in that certain city there's a certain
[28:49] boy and she says oh we are and he's kept
[28:58] he's been faithful to me and I'm gonna
[29:00] be faithful to him oh if that don't
[29:03] strike you anybody know let me tell you
[29:06] God has been faithful that's what I
[29:08] desire I want to be faithful to him huh
[29:11] come on he proposed I said yes I want to
[29:15] be faithful and she said one of these
[29:19] old days we'll meet each other again
[29:23] lord have mercy you know one thing I
[29:26] know about the prophet of God he could
[29:27] tell it really good he put you right in
[29:29] the scene huh whoo hallelujah God is
[29:33] good to us she met through seven 21
[29:36] through 7 I let me read this it says not
[29:38] everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord
[29:40] shall I shall enter into the kingdom of
[29:42] heaven but he that doeth the will of my
[29:45] father which is in heaven many will say
[29:48] to me in that day Lord Lord have we not
[29:50] prophesied in thy name and in thy name
[29:52] have cast out devils and in that name
[29:54] done many wonderful works and then will
[29:57] I profess unto them I never knew you
[29:59] depart from me ye that work iniquity
[30:02] now iniquity is when you know to do good
[30:05] and you do with it not hallelujah and
[30:08] what they did is that they rejected the
[30:11] prophet or the message is that right
[30:13] they did that's why all the
[30:16] denominations are suffering because
[30:18] their leaders rejected the message of
[30:22] the hour had their leaders accepted it
[30:25] we probably be in a rapture by now but
[30:28] if the blind lead us lead the blind they
[30:30] both shall fall in the ditch y'all hear
[30:33] what I'm saying
[30:34] so you look at these things to a lord
[30:36] Lord huh yeah and you cannot you can't
[30:39] say see this is why
[30:41] you know we can see why brother Melanie
[30:44] warns us you know it's you know I love
[30:46] the signs I love the wonders I love all
[30:48] of those things you know he tells us
[30:50] identification of a church we're
[30:51] supposed to have these things but he
[30:53] says basically don't major on a minor
[30:55] right all these things are good but
[30:57] everybody that's doing these things are
[30:59] not right they're not right in their
[31:01] heart it's the same anointing falling on
[31:03] the wheat and the tear but understand
[31:05] that you're your biggest victories that
[31:08] your name has been written in the Lamb's
[31:11] Book of Life before the foundation of
[31:13] the world that's why he told his
[31:15] disciples don't come running to me with
[31:17] all that noise and noise is good but I
[31:21] think a lot of times people think noise
[31:23] is where God is he can be a noise if he
[31:28] want to be but he's not always in it is
[31:32] that right you go to some of these
[31:34] churches they could make more knowledge
[31:36] than we can but they got no word and God
[31:39] is his word right so he's all of the
[31:42] knowledge but the absence of the world
[31:43] means that he's put out the church he's
[31:45] not there right but when you worship God
[31:48] you must worship Him where in spirit and
[31:51] in truth
[31:52] and the only way that you can worship
[31:53] him as you got to have the Holy Ghost
[31:56] everything else is just potential right
[31:59] now they're doing that casting out that
[32:02] was Judas cast that's why the property
[32:03] that said Judas even cast out Devils and
[32:05] laid hands on the sea and inwardly he
[32:07] was a devil but here God has given us
[32:12] something greater than just all of these
[32:15] things and here's the eye Elijah the
[32:18] probably God said it thundered Eli
[32:21] didn't moon he said knowledge the wind
[32:23] came he'll I didn't knew he said then
[32:26] came a steel of small boys hallelujah
[32:29] then he answered y'all hear what I'm
[32:31] saying and you saw what do you mean
[32:33] brother Brooks you can't hear the voice
[32:35] and that's the voices in here how do you
[32:37] go here the resurrection if you the
[32:38] resurrection is not in you hallelujah
[32:42] yes a prophet of God became the still
[32:46] small voice of that day but now that
[32:49] scroll must be in you because he said
[32:52] eat the whole book for the
[32:54] as prophesy again huh is that okay see
[32:59] you must build your house upon a rock
[33:01] that house that rock is what listen I
[33:03] can't explain to you why I'm dry I can't
[33:07] explain you why I believe that nobody's
[33:09] gonna take it from me I don't care how
[33:12] many fall just how many times I falter
[33:14] Amen nobody can take that from me that's
[33:18] the way your attitude should be
[33:21] hallelujah that's like telling my son
[33:23] water whoever Gabriel you that's not
[33:26] your daddy
[33:29] hallelujah I don't care how much you
[33:32] look like and that's not your dad you
[33:33] understand what I'm saying
[33:34] Gabrus a man something really wrong with
[33:37] you say but if you want to go
[33:39] scientifically let's get us a DNA
[33:42] alright that's what I tell the devil you
[33:45] want to go scientifically let's go DNA
[33:49] is that right yeah that's the truth too
[33:52] probably gotta say God pulls your blood
[33:55] out of you and gives you a blood
[33:56] transfusion you may not be able to see
[33:59] him at the devil knows it is that
[34:08] Alright
[34:08] oh come on except the Lord builds the
[34:12] house the Labour's labor in vain you
[34:14] know what I'm saying
[34:16] God is the contractor he's got the
[34:19] blueprint he knows exactly what needed
[34:21] in this building you understand me and
[34:24] every one of our battles are different
[34:28] right and we don't have the same battles
[34:31] you know I'm be honest with you
[34:33] mines are bad but I don't want yours I
[34:35] don't I don't know how what kind of
[34:38] battles you have him I'm having time
[34:40] with my own like I heard somebody and
[34:42] then people carrying the cross right
[34:44] carrying different crosses everybody had
[34:45] their cross and then when they came to a
[34:47] bridge you know everybody had you know
[34:49] different woman had done cut their cross
[34:50] off to make it lighter it was so huge
[34:53] that the cross world but everybody
[34:55] nobody wanted to carry that that big
[34:57] cross and in at the end of the day
[34:59] everybody had them cut their piece of
[35:01] cross off except that one man and he his
[35:05] cross was the only one that could bind
[35:07] the breach
[35:09] his cause was the only one they could
[35:12] fit everybody else was too short see
[35:14] what I'm saying so it's not a good thing
[35:16] to cut off your cross
[35:18] let thy will be done Lord whatever I've
[35:21] got a something whatever I've got to go
[35:23] through so be it don't spare me from
[35:26] nothing I want my clothes to fit I don't
[35:34] know I don't I do not want to come up
[35:36] short you understand me now if a person
[35:41] came to this message and rejected it
[35:43] folks they're lost I'm gonna talk about
[35:45] that I'm come up people who didn't know
[35:47] much about it or whose doctor and
[35:49] somebody you know they never understood
[35:51] and never really believed it you know I
[35:53] mean because of the way they've been
[35:55] taught you know God gives great
[36:01] therefore whosoever heareth these
[36:03] sayings of mine and doeth them I will
[36:06] liken him unto a wise man which built
[36:09] his house upon the rock and the old
[36:12] faith virtue knowledge temperance right
[36:15] T whosoever do with these same right so
[36:21] what were you saying if I hired a
[36:24] contractor I don't have to do nothing he
[36:27] builds the house I just come in at Mary
[36:30] what he's built right and Jesus is the
[36:33] contractor of this house
[36:35] he's the Builder right and and what he
[36:40] wants in us is to glorify Him and
[36:44] whatever stage you are in oh that is so
[36:48] Lord I'm so thankful how many times
[36:51] people are things that come your way and
[36:53] you remember in the back of your head
[36:55] had I not been converted this is would
[36:57] have been my reaction anybody know what
[37:01] I'm talking about and because of that
[37:03] you know you've grown from somewhere
[37:04] like later say I ain't what I ought to
[37:07] be I'm not what I used to be in or not
[37:10] what I want to be but thank God I'm not
[37:11] what I want
[37:12] used to be y'all know that y'all know
[37:13] how to say it but my party has a
[37:15] opposite that it shows that he's calling
[37:18] these countries come from somewhere and
[37:20] how I know
[37:22] maybe I have not reached there where I
[37:24] want to in his own display because token
[37:27] must be on display divine love is not
[37:29] something that you cloak it must be seen
[37:32] that seal must be seen on the front and
[37:35] the back side right and you know you
[37:39] look at this aliens or brothers hey all
[37:41] like I said it's a reign to sin the
[37:43] flood came the wind blew and beat upon
[37:46] the house don't you know you and I the
[37:48] reason why we're not backspin is not
[37:50] because we have been so perfect it's
[37:53] only because God who started the good
[37:55] work in you its faithful to complete
[37:59] once he started he said I'll never leave
[38:02] you nor forsake you ha call it a car he
[38:04] will make it happen hallelujah
[38:07] absolutely
[38:09] whoo everyone that hears these sayings
[38:13] of mine you've got to trust God if
[38:15] nobody else nobody else it started with
[38:20] the thief on the cross he didn't even
[38:21] know much about Christ but he believed
[38:23] him he trusted in life and it ends up
[38:27] the same way trust the Lord with all
[38:29] your heart hallelujah
[38:32] hey how many times the prophet of God
[38:34] was owner on the platform and and people
[38:37] could have been healed member that's one
[38:38] lady who was dying and he told her she
[38:41] was gonna die and she didn't believe it
[38:43] right or she could have been healed this
[38:45] to case one case he said I can't pray
[38:48] for you because you can ready to go home
[38:49] and then later didn't want to believe it
[38:51] as soon as she got to her chance she
[38:53] fell dead huh
[38:55] and this other one he tried to get her
[38:57] to have faith she wouldn't she came all
[38:59] the way up then he told everything and
[39:01] she just couldn't not grasp it and he's
[39:03] basically trying to tell her if you
[39:04] don't even though I said what I said if
[39:07] you don't your faith will grasp it
[39:08] you're gonna die guess what she died see
[39:14] that's why he said sometimes he's a
[39:16] duster the law you yield then he says
[39:18] according to your faith God is perfect
[39:27] God can't do nothing for you you get
[39:29] over I don't know how I'm gonna be
[39:31] perfect I don't care how
[39:34] I'm not bringing back a bad report you
[39:38] understand me
[39:39] those those spas gave us so we cannot do
[39:41] it I'm saying we can do it I don't care
[39:45] how big got Giants I got in my life God
[39:48] knows how to slay every one of them I
[39:53] got it with one stone
[39:56] he they've begun the good working it's
[39:59] papers are completed kill every giant ah
[40:06] when he's gonna complete it that's his
[40:08] own business
[40:11] hallelujah
[40:14] y'all don't believe y'all need perfect
[40:16] love remember brother Adam said his wife
[40:21] even told him it's perfect love over
[40:25] here bill this is what you've been
[40:28] preaching old it goes all your life did
[40:31] you know that he himself went through
[40:33] changes before he could even see you
[40:36] know the stature of a man God had to
[40:38] take him through changes to let him see
[40:40] basically why people who were Christians
[40:42] who recall said had the Holy Ghost was
[40:44] failing and they were failing he said
[40:47] I've had patients with you for 33 years
[40:51] some of y'all still bobbling your hair
[40:53] and doing that
[40:54] can you imagine right in the face of the
[40:56] Prophet they still cutting their hair I
[40:58] can't I can't imagine it but he said
[41:01] I've had patients with you right but now
[41:04] I'm going to tell you something
[41:07] Israel died under sanctification because
[41:11] God was requiring though the cross over
[41:14] the in the daughter hello
[41:18] oh you can't stay there you got to move
[41:22] on is what you're saying
[41:23] we cannot stay where we are and listen I
[41:28] am so glad is individuals huh it's
[41:33] individuals it's you in God
[41:37] me and God nobody can hold me back
[41:40] nobody can hold you back okay
[41:46] just a bit okay I'm just gonna will
[41:49] bring something and it will see wonder
[41:53] what God is something I've never seen
[41:59] another thing brotherbrother Jesse
[42:01] brought it out and he was dealing with
[42:05] the mysteries in our always even in
[42:08] denominations
[42:09] what those fragments mean lies God
[42:14] collecting fragments pieces of bread you
[42:17] know what was it those pieces of bread
[42:20] belongs to whatever loaf it was but
[42:24] those those twelve fragments represented
[42:27] twelve apostles with twelve twelve
[42:29] governing powers that was the Beast
[42:32] listen let me read it let me read it
[42:34] amen and when Jesus knew it he said unto
[42:37] them why reason ye because you have no
[42:39] bread
[42:40] Percy ye not yet neither understand have
[42:43] you not your heart yet hardened having I
[42:47] see you not heaven ears hear you not and
[42:51] do you not remember now he's already
[42:55] told them says listen I knew you before
[42:57] the foundation of the world you was with
[42:59] me before the founders were and this
[43:02] these laws represented Christ and there
[43:04] was a peace peace peace so that bread
[43:07] was Christ and twelve pieces of it was
[43:10] to say you was with me when I was a
[43:12] whole loaf hallelujah but it was a
[43:17] mystery because nobody knew in the
[43:20] Jewish age kudos twelve disciples were
[43:23] and what they would mean in the future
[43:29] they were mysteries yet they were there
[43:32] with Christ even as Christ was a mystery
[43:34] they were a mystery and those twelve
[43:38] disciples were the foundation of faith
[43:43] y'all hear what I'm saying
[43:45] and when the seven among four thousand
[43:48] how many baskets full took ye up and
[43:51] they said seven that means they were
[43:57] going to be
[43:58] seven mysterious angels or servants like
[44:02] there were twelve who would carry
[44:07] missing who was carrying the word and
[44:10] you and I we look at this thing issue
[44:12] what brother was how can I done it there
[44:14] well why is he ask him why is it that
[44:16] you don't understand do we not
[44:21] understand communion communion is one
[44:23] brain broken up into so many pieces
[44:27] that's why he said don't leave nothing
[44:30] eat it all because every piece
[44:33] represents some body some part of the
[44:37] body hallelujah
[44:40] Moses said I leaving nothing behind and
[44:46] when we take communion we're literally
[44:49] identifying ourselves with the loaf who
[44:53] is Christ Jesus himself this is my body
[44:59] hallelujah so when you take a piece of
[45:02] the bed that bread which is 11 you will
[45:05] say I am part of the body of Christ and
[45:10] that wine means Holy Ghost amen
[45:14] I'm accepting the blood stimulation
[45:20] hello why because the Prophet God talks
[45:24] about those 12 mysteries of the Bible
[45:29] hmm and those 12 mysteries are the
[45:32] twelve parables or the parables that
[45:34] Jesus spoke of there in the book in the
[45:37] gospel I can't say enough but my point
[45:40] is this did you know that you are a
[45:43] mystery people say what brother works
[45:48] where you get that from I got it from
[45:50] the author that brother that
[45:55] so we're brother you don't even know
[45:57] your Bible he said I don't have to know
[45:59] my Bible I know the author though he'll
[46:02] tell me he'll tell me you know and we
[46:06] look at these things and we fail to see
[46:08] Amen that even God does not expect us to
[46:10] be parents God want us everything the
[46:13] property of God's has spoken that was
[46:15] Christ in him talking to the bride of
[46:17] Jesus Christ and guess what he tells her
[46:21] things that he doesn't tell other people
[46:23] sometimes God has told me things and I
[46:26] open my mouth and I get in trouble cuz
[46:27] nobody see what I'm talking about and I
[46:30] wasn't fine everybody it was for me and
[46:32] I had no business telling it ooh I'm a
[46:39] closed on there second Peter 1 through 4
[46:42] Lord I want you to people I want you to
[46:45] understand how our earth are we're going
[46:47] to get listen when you see what it what
[46:53] it what it means to add or take away
[46:54] that means you're making something
[46:57] different than what it really is but it
[46:59] see but but my point is is when you
[47:01] taking the Word of God and you seeing it
[47:02] because brother Branham done drop some
[47:04] nuggets here and some nuggets there and
[47:06] all you do is go through the scriptures
[47:07] and you find these things and what he's
[47:09] doing and what he's saying and you
[47:11] bringing it you're not adding to it
[47:12] you're literally opening up a meant by
[47:14] the same Holy Ghost what he's been
[47:17] bringing that makes it clearer to you
[47:19] it's not Jesus Christ the saying he told
[47:22] those saints of God he says listen I say
[47:24] unto you if you look at a woman in lust
[47:26] in your heart you've already committed
[47:27] adultery was he adding to the word
[47:29] because all know in the word all he had
[47:32] he had was that if you commit adultery
[47:34] right but he took it to the spiritual
[47:37] realm and he showed us what it really is
[47:40] if I don't take it to the spiritual
[47:42] realm and tell you and show you who you
[47:44] are how are you gonna know it it takes
[47:46] God to do that no man can do it
[47:52] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[47:54] great and precious promises that by
[47:57] these you might be partakers of the
[47:59] divine nature let me tell you something
[48:01] if we continue without revelation say
[48:05] everything brother man don't say it
[48:06] becomes like a catechism
[48:09] you don't even know what you're talking
[48:11] about what you just saying it just like
[48:14] these denominational churches that they
[48:16] have written whoever wrote it might have
[48:18] been spiritual I don't know but the
[48:20] people that saying it I heard I
[48:21] witnessed a message of a person a lady
[48:23] and she was a Lutheran she said well I
[48:25] have the Catechism like it was gonna
[48:27] save her I left for their web given unto
[48:34] us exceedingly great and precious
[48:36] promises and I said like this by the
[48:38] grace of God I will not put my soul on
[48:40] the line trying to give you something
[48:42] that I'd believe that God didn't give me
[48:46] wherever are given unto us exceeding
[48:48] great and precious promises that by ye
[48:51] by these you might be partakers of the
[48:54] divine nature having escaped the
[48:56] corruption that is in the world through
[48:58] lust and beside this giving all
[49:01] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[49:04] to virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[49:06] temperance and to temperance patience
[49:09] and to patience godliness and to
[49:12] godliness brotherly kindness it's the
[49:14] brotherly kindness charity and for these
[49:16] and for for if these things be in you
[49:19] and abound they make you that you should
[49:23] neither see in this what people what
[49:25] people do when you start reading this
[49:27] thing they kind of correlate and and
[49:28] process it in their minds and I'm not
[49:31] saying that this is here but when you
[49:32] start talking you can't even say the
[49:34] word thunders when you say it's not the
[49:37] word on this part of this message you
[49:40] say thunders everybody think Utah Cobra
[49:42] didn't have no no no what you call it um
[49:45] huh
[49:46] well who said it copyright on this
[49:50] message Laval didn't have a copyright
[49:53] either none of them had copyright then
[49:59] you listen and I tell you the truth you
[50:01] might think I'm I'm gonna say it anyway
[50:03] if those brethren had looked on that
[50:06] unwritten word like the Prophet told him
[50:09] we wouldn't have never had this
[50:10] confusion in the beginning he said stay
[50:14] right here and look up on it and all
[50:17] those preachers began to walk away by
[50:19] with their own revelation and they
[50:21] brought confusion in this thing because
[50:23] they the ones that began to what to
[50:25] colonize and break the thing up I got it
[50:29] I hunt with him and I fish with him and
[50:32] they did all that stuff but brother
[50:34] brems Edwin that's future bride come on
[50:35] the see he talks about it there is a
[50:39] spiritual bride and I'm one of them hmm
[50:50] but if these things be in you and abound
[50:53] they make you that ye shall neither be
[50:56] barren nor unfruitful in that the
[50:59] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but
[51:01] he that lacketh these things is blind
[51:04] and cannot see afar off and have
[51:07] forgotten that he was purged from his
[51:09] old sins wherefore the round up brethren
[51:13] give diligence to make your calling and
[51:16] election sure that's the only way you
[51:18] can make it for if you do these things
[51:21] you shall never fall for so an interest
[51:25] shall be ministered unto you abundantly
[51:26] in the everlasting kingdom of our Lord
[51:29] and Savior Jesus Christ and what that
[51:31] ministry was a man was Malachi for who
[51:35] God used to open up this message right
[51:38] now he's telling us he's telling this is
[51:42] in 1962 before the seals are open right
[51:46] and he takes us through the church ages
[51:48] in the church agency tells us of every
[51:50] Church what would require to them how
[51:53] they worked how they did this how they
[51:56] did this yet but God has some well
[51:57] against him something against this right
[52:00] the whole theme behind this this message
[52:03] was you have left your first love you
[52:06] did the same thing he did you left your
[52:08] first love
[52:09] right and God is calling us back to
[52:12] repentance repentance Awadh Jesus is not
[52:16] a thing he's a person and you and I
[52:19] supposed to know this person oh you said
[52:21] well I got a Holy Ghost but this hold
[52:22] ago supposed to talk to you hmm he's
[52:26] supposed to talk to you the whole thing
[52:28] about it is Christ in you the hope of
[52:30] glory
[52:31] now I tell you what has happened to me
[52:34] in the time that I shut-in you know I
[52:36] had
[52:37] listen to Elijah here's died Elijah all
[52:39] I listened to was a few tape different
[52:41] tapes and in statute of a personal man
[52:43] and I've seen this in a way that I've
[52:45] never seen it before and all I know is
[52:47] is something that will guarantee you
[52:50] heaven if you allow God to be able if
[52:56] you allow God to sanctify you if you
[52:59] allow God amen to build you up to
[53:01] brotherly kindness and temperance and
[53:03] patience and godliness all of these
[53:05] things which will be caught which will
[53:07] require death to you every one of these
[53:13] places amen you got to die that God's
[53:16] temperance can be seen brotherly
[53:19] kindness is not oh he just don't know if
[53:24] he hadn't met me ten years ago he would
[53:26] have got it
[53:28] that is not brotherly kindness that's
[53:32] not God virtue because virtue would not
[53:36] allow you to even think that way it just
[53:41] happens right so you and I must
[53:44] understand there's a lot of work to do
[53:46] but we don't already pass the first test
[53:49] some of us might even be at virtue how
[53:52] many of y'all have prayed for people
[53:54] that you felt a little weak before I am
[53:56] that's virtue that's where God they took
[54:00] virtue out of you that's something you
[54:02] gave your power your whole egos of that
[54:04] right they even say scientists say that
[54:06] when you lay hands on the sick they've
[54:08] seen it light pass from one to the next
[54:11] that is virtue you got knowledge right
[54:16] knowledge is easy all the word is right
[54:21] amen to everyone right and temperance is
[54:28] not just your temper yeah that's what it
[54:33] is
[54:34] just having control letting God have
[54:37] control you so wrapped up and people
[54:40] screaming at you you don't even hear
[54:41] them almost you hear them but you're not
[54:43] affected by the atmosphere all right
[54:45] y'all know what that is Oh patience is
[54:49] what we all need
[54:50] we need some old faces they oh my god
[54:57] they gave me the holy ghost yet we all
[55:01] needed the Lord I've been praying for
[55:03] this divine love patience you wait on it
[55:07] how many years Abraham waited for the
[55:09] baby
[55:12] mmm oh you think about it this is why I
[55:16] love Israel how many years have been
[55:18] waited for the Messiah and they still
[55:21] believe he's coming look at them I'm
[55:29] like woo you know I can't imagine when
[55:31] the Holy Ghost ate them folks what its
[55:33] gonna be like
[55:34] mercy hmm come on running over running
[55:38] through troops and all that oh you're
[55:41] gonna hear some bales for real Oh a lot
[55:44] of this prayed that God give us a little
[55:47] piece of the action by looking over the
[55:49] bed there are no people that as faithful
[55:53] as those people you understand what I'm
[55:55] saying they don't have nothing pretty
[55:58] much other than the law I've seen him in
[56:01] the air I don't seen him in the airport
[56:02] in the corner reading there whatever
[56:08] with them little hats on any time of the
[56:11] day I mean just little hats I don't know
[56:14] a box that's what I think it got Scrolls
[56:17] in them or something but these people
[56:19] they're not a shame in what has happened
[56:23] to the bride I say brother look at us
[56:25] you know people are shame to be holy
[56:27] anymore look holy they don't they want
[56:29] to be like I said sexy holiness is no
[56:31] such thing but that's what all the girls
[56:35] that's what they won't man you know they
[56:37] want the perm hand all of the kind of
[56:39] stuff and you know dude it all up
[56:41] anything nothing only looking nice but
[56:43] it's wrong when it take away from
[56:45] holiness
[56:53] is okay one more coat number let you go
[56:56] for the night I'm sorry I didn't mean to
[56:57] keep you so long what here's the I
[56:59] Elijah he's it we can testify jump up
[57:04] and down and sing and everything like
[57:07] that but until God makes us in such a
[57:10] condition till we can recognize one
[57:13] another as brothers until all malice
[57:16] Envy strife and everything's going out
[57:19] of us our jumping shouting and praising
[57:22] God
[57:22] organizing speaking in tongues and
[57:25] healing the sick and performing miracles
[57:26] and everything else will never amount to
[57:29] nothing come back and wait in the cave
[57:34] till we have heard the still small voice
[57:36] that calls us to the service of God oh
[57:39] how we meet it how the world needs it we
[57:44] need that he says name God will provide
[57:49] boom all of the stuff we're doing whoo
[57:55] that struck me - all of that and you
[58:00] can't even love your brother
[58:02] knowing you want to recognize him as if
[58:06] he'd belong to a camp we don't even want
[58:08] to recognize him as a brother because
[58:09] even you know he believes that you know
[58:12] but you know where I foundation where
[58:14] it's Calvary there's somebody to do away
[58:18] with kaveri he's not a brother but as
[58:20] long as Calvary is being emphasized the
[58:22] blood of Jesus Christ and the grace
[58:24] saves you that's a brother he said all
[58:32] of us colonising he was fussing at the
[58:34] people in 1960 whenever in 59 he says
[58:38] listen he says here it is God trying to
[58:41] move with the people and the more he
[58:42] moved the more these people are
[58:44] colonizing on that one tape he's
[58:48] literally praying for a woman free child
[58:50] and he said oh you a woman preacher and
[58:53] you just gave up your church because you
[58:55] found out you had cancer he said don't
[58:57] give up your church who how many of us
[59:01] would have told somebody that you come
[59:05] to
[59:06] you got to give it up you don't know
[59:12] what God is doing
[59:13] I heard him I like what he did he told
[59:18] her and that was God said that that
[59:20] wasn't him as a man that was God's
[59:22] and don't you give up your
[59:24] church now explain that word to me see
[59:31] we just things in the wrong way what you
[59:35] going to do with Amy McPherson with the
[59:38] Prophet respected with your graveyard
[59:40] parade and all that's down myself and he
[59:42] talks about how he respected her woman
[59:45] preacher who lived in his time he met
[59:47] her priest at her church oh she didn't
[59:52] make it to heaven hello huh brother
[59:56] Branham wasn't wasting his time he was a
[1:00:00] man led of God see I'm not a I'm not
[1:00:06] condoning it we know it's wrong but our
[1:00:10] attitude has to become better than what
[1:00:15] they do
[1:00:15] I heard the Prophet God said he's
[1:00:18] standing with anybody that's staying
[1:00:20] with Jesus regardless to doctrines oh
[1:00:24] and you know usual work but that's where
[1:00:28] perfectly love is gonna bring you to it
[1:00:29] it's gonna bring you there and you gotta
[1:00:32] want it high there's no body that I know
[1:00:35] of that I want to see go to hell nobody
[1:00:42] some people do what they do because they
[1:00:44] don't know you think that lady I don't
[1:00:49] know what happened at the end of the day
[1:00:50] but he said here's our line what do you
[1:00:54] realize you and all I'm saying is these
[1:01:03] people we blessed above measures we are
[1:01:09] blessed and I know that you and I don't
[1:01:13] understand a lot of things but one thing
[1:01:16] we must understand except the Lord
[1:01:19] builds a house
[1:01:20] we label anything and who is that I
[1:01:24] heard preaching the other day maybe Ben
[1:01:26] Jessie Satan will cause irreparable
[1:01:31] because we don't see much progress or
[1:01:34] something you know what you see Gideon
[1:01:39] saw himself as a coward when God called
[1:01:42] him that mighty man availeth now which
[1:01:47] one which report you would like to have
[1:01:51] God called me broad yes thank you
[1:01:54] hallelujah I already exceeded every bit
[1:01:58] of it I'll take it Lord let Stan and
[1:02:00] that's all I'm saying
[1:02:02] when the word of God is being preached
[1:02:04] if you don't understand it whatever ask
[1:02:07] God if you see yourself in a place and
[1:02:09] God gonna allow these things that come
[1:02:11] upon you to try you and test you but you
[1:02:14] don't give up you acknowledge your
[1:02:17] transgressions and you said well Lord I
[1:02:19] want to do better but I need you to help
[1:02:21] me you're the Builder of the house now
[1:02:23] that we know he's the one that's
[1:02:25] building it we need to tell him we know
[1:02:27] now that you're the Builder I can't do
[1:02:29] it Lord but you can do it in me and Lord
[1:02:33] no matter what it takes I want to be
[1:02:35] perfect like your words they'd be
[1:02:37] perfect even as your father which is in
[1:02:40] heaven is perfect and the only way I
[1:02:42] know I could be perfect is that the
[1:02:44] perfect one of I you love the Lord
[1:02:49] because it makes it easier for yourself
[1:02:52] but I'm gonna tell you something when

[1:03:15] laid in you or however they virtuals

[1:08:22] know how
[1:08:23] Lord you know me there is no secret you
[1:08:30] know our makeup each and every one of us
[1:08:34] Lord you know us better than we know
[1:08:35] ourselves you know our past our present
[1:08:39] and our future Lord but we know also
[1:08:43] Lord that it is your thought that causes
[1:08:48] us to is our you how you thought of us
[1:08:53] and spoke our existence
[1:08:56] you called us pride in the beginning it
[1:08:59] therefore we remain right father you say
[1:09:04] that this pride of God will stay with
[1:09:07] the word she'll know what to do with the
[1:09:09] word but Lord the only way that is
[1:09:12] possible is that the word lives in us
[1:09:15] you Lord knows what to do with your own
[1:09:18] world
[1:09:19] no we be in Bride form nor distill your
[1:09:22] Holy Spirit
[1:09:24] and before we become a bride we had
[1:09:27] become a son first Lord you baptized us
[1:09:32] with your Holy Ghost the Lord we're not
[1:09:35] here to stake Canaan land was not heaven
[1:09:40] it just showed us O God that we had to
[1:09:43] fight for opposition yet you told us
[1:09:47] wherever we place our feet is ours and
[1:09:50] yet Joshua had to fight for every inch
[1:09:52] of it help us fight Lord let us resist
[1:09:57] the enemy Lord give us words of wisdom
[1:10:00] may we hear that still all boys
[1:10:03] even as the Prophet was controlled by
[1:10:07] you boys he heard you when no one else
[1:10:09] could hear you you told him not to speak
[1:10:12] it's when you told him a man various
[1:10:17] things naught he just did what you
[1:10:19] wanted him to do it thought he had to
[1:10:21] learn now was Jesus may we come to a
[1:10:27] place of complete obedience is our
[1:10:32] desire to please he found his our desire
[1:10:35] to be perfect so mold us make us we
[1:10:43] trust your word you said you'll never
[1:10:48] leave us nor forsake you told us in your
[1:10:51] word that neither be done the good
[1:10:53] working us was faithful to repeat it and
