[1:09] up on Ephesians tonight Lord's will and
[1:13] um I have truly been blessed in in
[1:17] studying it and I don't know I trust
[1:20] that all of you
[1:22] have uh been enlightened some way or
[1:26] another um we're going to come from
[1:28] Ephesians the 6th chapter CH and we're
[1:31] going to start reading from the 11th
[1:36] verse and it reads put on the whole
[1:39] armor of God that you may be able to
[1:43] stand against the Ws of the devil and
[1:46] that word Wes means trickery for we
[1:49] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[1:51] against
[1:52] principalities against Powers against
[1:55] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[1:58] against spiritual Wicked is in high
[2:01] places wherefore take unto you the whole
[2:04] armor of God that you may be able to
[2:07] withstand in the evil day and having
[2:10] done all to stand stand therefore having
[2:13] your loins girdled about with truth and
[2:16] having on the bre breastplate of
[2:19] righteousness and your feet Shard with
[2:22] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[2:25] above all taking the shield of Faith
[2:29] wherewith ye shall be able to quench all
[2:31] the fiery dots of the wicked and take
[2:34] the helmet of salvation and the sword of
[2:37] the spirit which is of which is the word
[2:40] of God praying always with all prayer
[2:45] and supplication in the spirit and
[2:48] watching uh there unto with all
[2:51] perseverance and spirit and supplication
[2:54] for All For All
[2:56] Saints and for me that the other an may
[3:00] be given unto me that I may open my
[3:02] mouth boldly to make known the mysteries
[3:05] of the gospel for which I am an
[3:07] ambassador in bonds that wherein I may
[3:10] speak boldly as I ought to
[3:14] speak but that ye Also may may know my
[3:17] Affairs and how I do uh tius I a beloved
[3:22] brother and faithful minister in the
[3:24] Lord shall make known to you all things
[3:27] whom I have sent unto you for the same
[3:30] purpose that you might know our Affairs
[3:34] and that you may Comfort your hearts
[3:37] peace be unto the brethren in love with
[3:39] Faith from God the father in the Lord
[3:42] Jesus Christ Grace be with all them that
[3:46] love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity
[3:51] amen you may be seated I just want
[3:55] to uh that 24th verse of the chapter
[4:00] here um where it says Grace be with all
[4:04] them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in
[4:08] sincerity amen because uh that is
[4:13] basically what keeps can I say it like
[4:16] this it's it's if there be if there be
[4:19] any fastenings or buttons to basically
[4:23] keep the armor of God on uh an
[4:26] individual it would be the love of the
[4:29] sincere love that we have toward God in
[4:33] studying or in thinking about what what
[4:35] the whole arm of God is I thought to
[4:37] myself that these scriptures were
[4:40] written to every Church
[4:42] age and uh uh I I say it like this um
[4:48] because we had all of these churches we
[4:50] had seven churches of Asia and the
[4:53] letters were basically uh as I have
[4:57] understood uh those letters that were
[4:59] from Paul were passed around you know uh
[5:04] either by word of mouth or or by by by
[5:08] by letter which was um written on on the
[5:13] skins of animals but but my whole uh uh
[5:17] situation here is um when we talking
[5:19] about putting on the whole armor that
[5:21] means something that you do you have to
[5:23] be involved in it's not like somebody's
[5:26] going to put the AR you know we're going
[5:27] to just stretch our arms out here and
[5:30] somebody's going to do it for us but you
[5:33] have to play a part in this um when you
[5:38] think
[5:39] about how we lost our armor because
[5:42] remember uh Adam and Eve in the
[5:44] beginning was fully armored they weren't
[5:48] clothed but they were armored they
[5:50] actually had the protection of the Holy
[5:53] Spirit they had a veil about them um
[5:56] that uh kept them from their nakedness
[6:00] um they had Faith H because remember now
[6:04] Adam was the very expression of God he
[6:06] was when you saw Adam you saw god um
[6:10] that was just the way it is like when
[6:11] you see Jesus you see God it was God um
[6:15] manifested himself to his creation
[6:17] through Adam we lost the battle uh not
[6:22] through Adam but through Eve well let me
[6:25] back it up that's not correct we lost
[6:27] the battle because Eve was deceived D
[6:30] but Adam walked out willfully he
[6:33] willfully sinned in other words there
[6:36] was no way that Adam could have been
[6:39] tricked because Adam had the mind of God
[6:42] Amen he was the very thought of God
[6:44] whatever God was thinking Adam would
[6:46] think what God was thinking that's why
[6:49] he was able to um name the animals I'm
[6:53] saying all of this to bring us to a
[6:55] point putting on the whole arm of God it
[6:58] doesn't mean just the mysteries of your
[7:02] day it means taking everything from
[7:06] Ephesus all the way up to uh uh uh Lea
[7:11] all the way up to the bride amen because
[7:14] remember God is a god of furtherance
[7:18] Amen he's always revealing himself more
[7:21] and more and more and more they may have
[7:25] had just justification the other one may
[7:27] have had sanctification but in this hour
[7:31] the whole armor of God Amen is every
[7:35] attribute of every age amen plus Divine
[7:39] love that's right and we must understand
[7:42] that's the whole armor of God for us
[7:44] Divine love is the only thing that's
[7:46] going to conquer what Satan is putting
[7:49] out in this day amen now the thing about
[7:52] it is Faith you have to believe what God
[7:57] says about you that's right can I say it
[8:00] again you must believe I'm not talking
[8:03] about
[8:05] circumstances you know oh I I got this
[8:09] and and I used to be this and that and
[8:11] the other no no no we're talking about
[8:13] what
[8:14] God is saying to you amen I heard a a
[8:19] brother
[8:20] say when Adam was
[8:23] asleep Eve we you know we call her Eve
[8:26] but she wasn't Eve then she was Adam she
[8:28] was on the inside of Adam and as Adam
[8:31] slept she did sleep too amen and then
[8:34] when God woke up Adam he woke up Eve
[8:38] amen so she was she was Awakening to a
[8:41] Revival
[8:43] herself and and and I know for a fact
[8:47] that when we talk about woman she is she
[8:49] was the actual actual womb of Adam
[8:52] that's why we say woman she is the womb
[8:55] of Adam every woman is the womb of a man
[8:57] cuz a man don't have a w a man can't
[9:00] produce a baby by himself that's why God
[9:03] needed us and we need God Amen you see
[9:06] that's why Adam could not allow Eve to
[9:09] go because that was his only way of
[9:12] reproduction amen that's right even
[9:14] though even though God we know it was by
[9:16] Spoken Word she had a part in it I'm
[9:20] saying all of this is because if Eve
[9:24] would have kept kept to who she her uh
[9:27] Adam said she was she would have never
[9:30] gone with the
[9:32] serpent I'm going to say that again and
[9:35] this is what I'm trying to tell you I'm
[9:36] bringing it to you to us if we can
[9:39] believe what the message have said we
[9:42] are amen we will never uh listen to the
[9:46] voice of the serpent amen we we we got
[9:49] to believe and and Faith come by hearing
[9:52] and and this is what the word of God is
[9:55] when Adam when Eve came uh uh and and
[9:58] and and Adam saw her he declared unto
[10:01] her your bone of my bone and your flesh
[10:04] are my flesh Amen in other words amen we
[10:08] are from the same material amen right
[10:11] and so if we can understand that this is
[10:14] what God is saying to us but you got to
[10:18] believe it amen and this is why it was
[10:21] so important because what happened she
[10:24] took her armor off amen that's right
[10:27] youall understand me she took her arm
[10:29] armor off first of all if she had had
[10:31] that that Shield that Faith Shield the
[10:35] enemy would have never been able to
[10:37] seduce her amen Satan first seduces us
[10:41] in our minds amen that's right and if
[10:44] she had had the armor of God that that
[10:47] that that that that Shield of Faith this
[10:49] is why the Bible said we don't wrestle
[10:51] against flesh and
[10:53] blood but spiritual against
[10:57] principalities understand when Adam said
[10:59] you are woman he was literally placing
[11:02] her in her position amen right when God
[11:07] says your bride amen he's placing you in
[11:10] your position that's right meaning you
[11:14] came from him you go back to him you are
[11:17] a part of him and and he is expecting
[11:21] you to be as as the word is amen
[11:25] believing the word this is why the angel
[11:28] of the Lord told Brother
[11:29] brandom if I can get you if you can get
[11:32] the people to believe all things are
[11:35] possible
[11:37] amen see and brother Bron spent many of
[11:40] his years laying on hands and and and
[11:43] Discerning and then if you I can't
[11:45] remember the message I just listened to
[11:47] it he said he was wrong by doing that
[11:49] even though God honored it amen he said
[11:52] his commission was to get the people to
[11:54] believe amen amen and and it it's not
[11:58] changed
[12:00] God still saying you got to
[12:03] believe one of the things and I I I I
[12:06] I'll get to that any in a minute for
[12:08] Flesh and
[12:10] Blood we for we wrestle not against
[12:12] flesh and blood but against
[12:15] principalities against Powers against
[12:18] rulers of the darkness of this world
[12:21] against spiritual wickedness in high
[12:24] places and and here the devil um God is
[12:27] is actually working with both Dimension
[12:30] he's working with the dimension that we
[12:32] cannot see and he's working with the
[12:34] dimension that we can see amen because
[12:37] remember amen that all
[12:39] principalities
[12:41] all you could let's let's say it like
[12:44] this so you understand me presidents
[12:46] vice presidents all all all the
[12:48] government officials amen you must
[12:51] understand that they are ordained of God
[12:55] but it doesn't mean that they are all
[12:58] God's children that's right and we have
[13:01] spiritual wickedness in high places now
[13:05] Paul knew what he was talking about
[13:07] because he was dealing with Rome right
[13:09] and he un he wanted them to know you
[13:12] don't have to just battle with yourself
[13:14] but you actually got principalities you
[13:17] got powers in high places amen that
[13:20] you're going to have to ra HH be aware
[13:23] of not that these people are that you
[13:27] you must hate oh I hate
[13:30] uh you know uh a president no no no no
[13:32] you must understand that the spirit
[13:35] behind the person is what you're
[13:37] fighting against amen that's right right
[13:40] because you got to respect every office
[13:43] amen the Bible said give to
[13:45] Caesar what belongs to Caesar am and God
[13:48] is the one who lifts ups and brings down
[13:50] that's right right so it doesn't matter
[13:53] whether you like the president or don't
[13:54] like the vice president or Secretary of
[13:57] State God ordained amen hallelujah right
[14:01] and the truth of the matter is that's
[14:03] that's in the natural y'all understand
[14:06] what I'm saying because I'm saying if we
[14:08] would listen to the news it would
[14:11] literally cause us to despise or even
[14:13] hate those that are within office amen
[14:16] regardless of what they're doing you
[14:19] must understand that they are ordained
[14:22] of Goden that's right Hallelujah and God
[14:26] placed them there amen and the best we
[14:29] could do for them is pray for their
[14:31] souls
[14:33] amen right you can't get mad with the
[14:35] cop because he stopped
[14:39] you right and you know that we say oh we
[14:42] going over the speed limit the cop stops
[14:44] us and we say the devil just the devil
[14:47] yeah the devil got on you
[14:50] first amen that's right right cuz you
[14:53] were
[14:55] speeding yeah it ain't the police that's
[14:57] just the devil you allow the because
[15:00] because you didn't have your your your
[15:03] Shield of
[15:04] faith that God is going to take you
[15:07] where you need to be and make it all
[15:09] right even if you're a few minutes late
[15:11] amen like tonight amen right I was home
[15:16] studying I can't say where the devil
[15:18] made me get
[15:20] late so you got to understand all things
[15:24] work together for the good of them that
[15:26] love the Lord we don't r against we you
[15:30] know we have to think we have to think
[15:33] who's attacking me what is attacking me
[15:36] and understand that nothing can attack
[15:39] the bride without permission that's
[15:41] right amen God gives
[15:44] permission and he's expecting you to do
[15:47] what stand like a soldier amen
[15:50] hallelujah wherefore take on you the
[15:53] whole armor of God that you may be able
[15:57] to withstand in the evil days and having
[16:00] done all to stand see what God people
[16:03] don't realize is that the character and
[16:06] the nature of of of divine nature that
[16:09] is God Amen that that is God and the
[16:13] Bible says when all of those virtues are
[16:15] in us we will never fall we'll never
[16:20] fail we we we will stand amen why
[16:24] because we have put on the whole armor
[16:27] amen every portion of that that uh uh uh
[16:31] divine nature might be tried in one inst
[16:35] one instance but yet and still if we are
[16:38] clothed with God if we are strengthened
[16:42] in the Inner Man by these virtues we
[16:46] won't come up short amen right so I'll
[16:50] say this so whenever we come up short
[16:51] you know there's a leakage
[16:54] somewhere there's a leak that's right
[16:56] it's not that seal is not on their tight
[16:59] enough amen and and you got to work you
[17:01] got to do what oh I'm coming to that
[17:03] amen see because you cannot put on the
[17:05] whole arm of God without dying daily am
[17:10] Paul said you have to die to yourself
[17:13] daily now I I'm not talking about your
[17:15] bad habits they going to die when you
[17:20] die right when your heart start beating
[17:23] everything in your body dies amen right
[17:26] so if this thing when you can Surrender
[17:30] Your Life your will your thoughts
[17:33] everything to God getting down on your
[17:35] knees wherever you may be standing up it
[17:38] doesn't matter but Paul says in order to
[17:43] maintain uh uh being a good soldier you
[17:47] must die to yourself and then put him on
[17:51] Amen you got to put him on daily amen oh
[17:54] I had a good time today the Lord was
[17:57] good Sunday what what about Monday what
[18:00] about Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday we
[18:02] get relaxed
[18:05] relaxed after Sunday we we we we let we
[18:08] know we oh I made it no you didn't you
[18:11] got a few more days to go amen it never
[18:14] stops until this stops amen and you got
[18:19] to put on the whole armor this is what
[18:20] he's trying to tell the people Ephesians
[18:22] Ephesus was mature enough to understand
[18:26] what Paul was saying right you got to
[18:28] put on the whole arm of God you can't
[18:30] just put on a few things and expect to
[18:33] make make it through this war this is
[18:36] the this age is the most intense age
[18:40] ever amen that's the truth y'all say
[18:42] well oh no I think when they they had
[18:45] these people killing them and lions and
[18:48] all that no no no no no all of that was
[18:51] God
[18:53] Amen and I heard a brother said I'm
[18:55] going repeat this he said what people
[18:57] don't understand he said even when they
[19:00] they were out there being killed by
[19:02] lions that still was the book of Acts
[19:06] amen Lord and it
[19:08] was it was because there was no human
[19:12] possibility that would C no nothing in
[19:14] the human mind that would make him run
[19:17] toward a lion amen that's right that was
[19:20] the anointing of God that was God
[19:23] showing and proving himself that I'm
[19:25] greater amen and every age he unfolded
[19:29] more of himself to prove that he's
[19:31] greater so he's greater he he had
[19:34] started with the lion then the ox then
[19:36] the man then the eagle it doesn't stop
[19:40] there it keeps going amen she said well
[19:44] that that was just the four living
[19:45] creatures well what are you going to do
[19:47] with the
[19:48] lamb amen when John turned around he
[19:50] heard he he heard the voice of a lion
[19:53] but when he turned around he saw a lamb
[19:55] amen because whether you believe it or
[19:57] not it was the nature of the Lamb that
[20:01] conquered death hell and the grave
[20:03] Hallelujah even though he was a king
[20:07] amen that's why he had to be humble
[20:10] that's why he had to what he had to pray
[20:13] who Jesus amen he had to pray and we
[20:17] know of one prayer father not my will
[20:20] but let thine be done what was he doing
[20:23] dying to himself amen you say oh he
[20:26] didn't have to die to himself yes he did
[20:29] because he said Lord I don't want to do
[20:31] it father I would that this cup passed
[20:33] from me and whenever we get into that
[20:36] place we know what we need to do pray
[20:40] amen some part of us still living you
[20:42] got to pray amen right that's the way it
[20:47] is when you find yourself getting
[20:50] agitated and crossed you got to pray
[20:54] because the old man is rising up and you
[20:57] got to kill him kill him kill him daily
[21:00] sometimes you got to slay him more than
[21:01] one time
[21:03] am it's what it really is this is really
[21:06] a battle but your greatest enemy as
[21:08] brother Adam said is you amen
[21:13] yourself nobody can hurt my feelings
[21:16] better than I can hurt my feelings amen
[21:18] but you say what do you mean when I fail
[21:21] God nobody causing me to fall or fail
[21:25] but me amen when I fail to listen when I
[21:29] failed to have my shield of faith and my
[21:32] whole arm of God and you know what I'm
[21:34] saying amen then I I judge me amen
[21:38] that's right and I understand it was it
[21:40] was me right somebody mistreat you at
[21:43] the register hello and then you get all
[21:46] mad they're not the problem God tested
[21:49] the armor
[21:51] amen see what kind of armor you got on
[21:55] right and every one of us right
[21:59] we get those tests and we fail yes sir
[22:02] but don't look bad don't don't look bad
[22:04] on your it's like God is saying I'm
[22:06] getting your attention you allow the
[22:08] enemy to come in if what if that was a
[22:11] knife what if that was a sword that's
[22:13] right right you just you allowed him to
[22:16] penetrate the armor or the place where
[22:19] the armor should be you allowed him to
[22:22] penetrate you are now wounded because of
[22:24] your neglect amen it's not God it's our
[22:28] NE neglect amen stand
[22:31] therefore having your Lawns G about with
[22:35] truth that is so
[22:40] important because that's really your
[22:41] weakest
[22:44] part and your weakest part must maintain
[22:48] truth what is truth I am bride amen I've
[22:52] been created in His image amen I'm not a
[22:55] I'm not a devil I'm the seed of of God
[22:59] you got to have that truth that strong
[23:02] truth because I'm going to tell you
[23:04] something anybody any real Christian
[23:06] know when Satan causes you to stumble
[23:10] and fall the first thing he says to you
[23:13] see you ain't all you said yeah and
[23:15] remember when you when you was the the
[23:17] preacher was preaching you were like
[23:18] amen amen see where's your amen now see
[23:22] that's the way he comes at you but it's
[23:25] all because we fail to pray and die to
[23:29] ourselves daily amen that's right got to
[23:32] keep a song in your heart or a scripture
[23:35] in your mind or somewhere you got to
[23:37] entertain is that the word amen he told
[23:40] Israel he said put it on your head put
[23:42] it here put it around here put it on
[23:44] your you know everywhere you can put the
[23:46] word of God put it so when you look
[23:48] you'll be reminded of who you are amen
[23:51] and then the Bible says let this mind be
[23:53] in you that was also in Christ Jesus and
[23:57] you know what Jesus said said I do
[23:58] nothing except the father show me right
[24:02] so we got to understand it takes a real
[24:04] crucifixion a real dying out to
[24:07] ourselves uh and because we're being
[24:10] perfected and every every area measure
[24:13] of your of your life the inner man is
[24:16] going to be tried to see how much you
[24:18] have
[24:19] matured that's right from the last time
[24:22] amen this is about maturing amen that's
[24:25] right maturing and maturing mean I'm not
[24:30] going to lean to my not I'm Le script
[24:32] says lean not to your own understanding
[24:36] amen but acknowledge Him Amen in all of
[24:39] his ways what is his ways his word amen
[24:41] acknowledge Him in his word and he shall
[24:44] direct your path thank you Lord but when
[24:47] we get to a place and we allow the the
[24:49] the the the help how could say we when
[24:53] we allow and we don't have the helmet of
[24:55] faith on uh and then we allow doubt to
[24:58] come in doubt comes through the Mind
[25:01] from the mind it gets to the heart and
[25:04] from the heart it acts its way out amen
[25:07] and then we become a wounded soldier
[25:10] that's right or a fallen soldier only
[25:13] because we fail to put on the whole arm
[25:15] of
[25:16] God yes stand therefore having your
[25:19] Lawns gir about with truth and having on
[25:22] what the breastplate of
[25:25] righteousness what is righteousness
[25:28] believing God Amen Abraham believed God
[25:33] and it was imputed unto him as
[25:34] righteousness amen and I don't mean just
[25:37] believing God in your head I mean
[25:38] believing God in your heart amen right
[25:41] your whole being you believe God
[25:43] remember the story brother bam talked
[25:46] about I think it was a young man who was
[25:48] very very ill and um he has Paul said
[25:53] gone down to such a low place and
[25:57] brother Brandon pray for the person and
[25:59] the parents got to shout praise God I
[26:01] thank God for healing my and the nurse
[26:03] says hold up hold up how can y'all act
[26:05] like that that's right how can you act
[26:07] like that this is scientific known that
[26:11] once the hardbeat get that low and the
[26:14] blood pressure goes that low there's no
[26:16] Revival the person usually die and and
[26:19] the old man says come come here honey
[26:21] come here come
[26:22] come say I know you mean well but see
[26:25] you looking at your your instruments
[26:27] amen but we're looking at the promise of
[26:29] God see that's how Faith reacts amen it
[26:34] it it Shields unbelief it it blocks it
[26:37] it stops it right the shield of faith
[26:42] and and the breastplate of righteousness
[26:44] the righteousness of of a Believer is to
[26:46] always believe God
[26:49] Amen always believe
[26:52] him right stand
[26:56] therefore having your girdled you know
[26:59] what that mean tighten up tight tight
[27:01] not loose but tighten up amen that's
[27:04] right it's literally uh making the rest
[27:07] of the body you know strong right it's
[27:10] like rolling the shoulders back pulling
[27:12] the stomach in y'all know what I'm
[27:13] saying it's what it does it gives
[27:15] strength to the to the weaker part
[27:19] always believe God and your feet shy
[27:22] with the preparation of the gospel of
[27:25] peace amen
[27:29] yeah you know so we we must understand
[27:32] the grace of God any questions while I'm
[27:33] going this way
[27:37] comments I got a question yes sir when
[27:41] you
[27:41] talk god a lot of
[27:52] people in the Lord when I hear I think
[27:57] and he said yeah you can't you can't
[28:00] believe and not live it yeah believing
[28:03] believe believe God is an action
[28:06] word it's it's uh yeah it's like um when
[28:10] you believe God like brother said
[28:13] hearing and acting upon the word because
[28:16] you have heard it you act upon that's
[28:19] what real belief is when you act upon
[28:21] what you've heard and so uh I I'll say
[28:24] it like this I don't know about where
[28:26] people going to go but I know it's a
[28:30] it's where we are now is is the the
[28:34] Jesus Christ of
[28:35] today has has furthered his Revelation
[28:40] amen of himself that's right and those
[28:43] people who are back here will not find
[28:47] him the same yesterday today and forever
[28:49] amen but those who have seen him and
[28:52] understood what is the furthering of it
[28:54] that's what putting on the this is what
[28:56] I'm saying having that whole arm of God
[28:59] also involves having a great a a a
[29:02] greater revelation of God Amen how how
[29:05] you going to have a a armor the whole
[29:07] armor your armor is based upon your
[29:09] Revelation see when you have a full
[29:11] revelation of who he is then you can un
[29:14] you can put and and understand this
[29:17] because that Revelation also reflects
[29:19] back to you on who you are this is what
[29:22] God Adam said you are bone of my bone
[29:25] and Flesh of My Flesh somewhere she
[29:27] disbelieved have misbelieve
[29:30] something cuz she should have known the
[29:33] serpent had nothing to do with her amen
[29:37] Adam was her husband and she was a womb
[29:39] of Adam she was not it was not in order
[29:43] to produce the serpent seed amen yall
[29:46] understand me so it's not in order for
[29:48] the Bride of Jesus Christ if we
[29:50] understand who we are we must be sold
[29:53] out to him and to him only in this
[29:56] revelation
[29:58] in this
[29:59] Revelation see because this Revelation
[30:03] amen will give us the ability to produce
[30:06] His Kind amen and this is why people oh
[30:09] oh the Holy Ghost see this is why
[30:11] brother Brandon he couldn't just leave
[30:14] it to justification cuz you can't have a
[30:16] justification without the Holy Ghost you
[30:18] can't have sanctification without the
[30:20] Holy Ghost you can't have baptism of the
[30:22] Holy Ghost without the Holy Ghost amen
[30:25] right but it's got to go further amen
[30:28] the revelation of our day takes us into
[30:30] the person of Jesus Christ that's right
[30:33] after to your faith virtue knowledge
[30:35] Temperance all of that that is the
[30:37] person that is his nature that is his
[30:39] characteristics and we as a bride of
[30:41] Jesus Christ must in excuse me envelop
[30:45] it must be produced in US amen now how
[30:47] we going to do it because it's not given
[30:50] to you no it's a battle amen this is
[30:54] your promised land and you got to
[30:57] conquer all the inhabitants of the land
[31:00] amen that's how it works it has to be
[31:03] conquered and how is it conquered
[31:04] through Joshua the Holy Spirit Jesus
[31:07] Christ himself amen all right so yes did
[31:11] I answer your question y y okay so when
[31:14] we look at these things we must
[31:16] understand amen that the Gospel of Jesus
[31:18] Christ and how often do you find it how
[31:21] often do you see that even preached in
[31:25] churches gospel as we know it the
[31:28] foundation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[31:30] is his death burial and Resurrection
[31:32] amen how often do we hear it preached
[31:35] you see there are people even in our own
[31:37] church who've never understood what
[31:40] Calvary was all about why it had to take
[31:42] Calvary why was it a virgin amen right
[31:47] it had to be a virgin why see they don't
[31:49] know those things and so therefore they
[31:52] don't understand their position anybody
[31:54] could come and sway them to something
[31:56] else because they don't have a
[31:58] foundation for
[31:59] themselves but when you know the gospel
[32:02] like brother brand said there's no
[32:03] greater message than that a man can
[32:06] preach outside of the Gospel I don't
[32:08] care how deep your Mysteries are if you
[32:11] don't bring forth Calvary and how men
[32:13] should be saved and all of that it's all
[32:15] in vain amen that's right you got to
[32:17] preach
[32:19] that must preach
[32:23] that
[32:26] Hallelujah and o all things take the
[32:30] shield of Faith wherewith ye shall be
[32:33] able to quench all the fiery and wicked
[32:36] dot uh uh sorry quench all the fiery
[32:39] dots of the
[32:40] wicked
[32:45] right that means when you when you're
[32:47] going throughout the day do don't you
[32:49] know dots are being sh shot at you amen
[32:52] by wicked men by wicked women y'all
[32:55] don't know that oh it's const conly you
[32:59] know you don't you won't see them with a
[33:00] gun or a b and air or whatever but
[33:03] people brother B said people can project
[33:06] their Spirits you ever felt you ever you
[33:09] ever seen that happen I
[33:11] have I mean you could even be standing
[33:13] somewhere and all of a sudden you feel
[33:15] like somebody's staring at
[33:16] me and you know it you turn they St what
[33:19] did they do they projected their
[33:21] Spirit they don't they don't realize oh
[33:23] I'm going to project my spirit no it's
[33:25] an automatic thing that we do right and
[33:28] the thing about it is it when people do
[33:31] like do things like that it's never good
[33:35] hardly ever good there always a evil
[33:37] lustful Spirit that's coming at you
[33:42] amen
[33:46] yeah when we think about this this war
[33:50] Warfare uhh it it's All
[33:53] Flesh and this is why when I say All
[33:55] Flesh it involves our flesh
[33:58] Satan works with this because it's
[34:01] Fallen it's hybrid and anything that's
[34:04] hybrid causes death amen and you got to
[34:07] understand by the grace of God that this
[34:09] we're walking around in a body called
[34:11] death amen who shall deliver me from
[34:13] this body of death amen that's what Paul
[34:15] said that's right there's no real life
[34:17] in it uhuh the only life that we have is
[34:20] Christ himself and that's a a miraculous
[34:23] thing in in in itself that God could
[34:25] dwell in something that's dead amen cuz
[34:28] this body doesn't live it's dying daily
[34:33] amen right above all things the shield
[34:36] of Faith wherewith ye shall be able to
[34:39] quench all the fiery dots of the wicked
[34:43] and take the helmet of salvation and the
[34:46] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[34:51] God how you going to make it without the
[34:53] word people don't read they don't study
[34:57] how you going to make it you're supposed
[34:58] to be reading the Bible every day and
[35:00] praying amen every day one way or
[35:02] another right if it's by tape that's
[35:05] fine if it's you know by letting U the
[35:08] the the you know how they have it on the
[35:11] on the radio or the the thing where it
[35:13] reads the scripture to you however you
[35:15] need to be fed amen every day however
[35:18] you get it it's fine with God he don't
[35:21] mind he's just telling you you need to
[35:23] do it give us this day our daily bread
[35:27] and it must be done here's where I'm
[35:29] going to the 18th verse cuz I know I'm
[35:31] I'm behind but the 18th verse forgive me
[35:34] for rushing a little bit here praying
[35:39] always with with the with all prayer and
[35:44] supplication in the
[35:46] spirit and watching there unto with all
[35:51] perseverance and
[35:52] supplication for
[35:55] yourself no for all All Saints amen and
[35:59] sometime we go to prayer we just pray
[36:00] about us that's right that ain't what he
[36:03] saidy Lord he said perseverance and
[36:06] supplication for what All Saints amen we
[36:09] should pray for the house of God right
[36:12] not just being self as Lord deliver we
[36:14] ask it's okay to pray for yourself but
[36:17] remember there's others that need prayer
[36:20] amen and I I I I'll be honest with you I
[36:23] sometimes I've stayed as long as on my
[36:25] knees as as as as as uh I don't know I
[36:27] guess maybe an hour I'm not bragging but
[36:30] I like to feel him I don't like to get
[36:31] up without it amen that's right and I
[36:34] like I'll stay there till he comes and
[36:37] when he comes I'm satisfied y'all know
[36:39] what I'm saying and and I think that a
[36:41] lot of times I I go through in my mind
[36:43] or my prayer on my knees sometimes and
[36:45] and whether I fall asleep or not I don't
[36:47] know but I know I stay there till he
[36:50] comes amen and then when he comes that's
[36:53] when me and we we have a real
[36:54] conversation amen right so I just know
[36:58] that it prayer is a is a dimensional a
[37:01] dimensional thing you've got to die to
[37:03] yourself on your knees cuz you don't
[37:05] want to be there in the first
[37:07] place the devil don't want you on your
[37:09] knees yeah he he you know you don't mind
[37:12] praying here you know sitting in a chair
[37:15] but when it comes down to your knees he
[37:17] don't want you
[37:20] there the devil don't want you there
[37:22] because now you really humbling yourself
[37:24] before God in your natural and your
[37:26] natural is is reflecting what's in your
[37:29] heart right I I'm not saying that you
[37:31] have God say pray without ceasing
[37:34] wherever you have a place to pray you
[37:36] need to pray but let us not just have it
[37:40] Paul is trying to tell us in Ephesians
[37:42] don't just be praying for yourself all
[37:45] the churches have needs amen and
[37:48] whatever the Holy Ghost bring to your
[37:50] mind to pray for whoever he brings and
[37:52] if you don't have something get you a
[37:55] list amen that's right name everybody if
[37:58] you want to you don't know what they
[38:00] need you say God you know what they need
[38:02] that's but call their names out before
[38:04] the Lord just you know well I prayed and
[38:08] I I I ran out there's no such thing as
[38:10] running out of time um things to pray
[38:12] for there's a million things to pray for
[38:15] amen you just have your choice but there
[38:17] are many things to pray for E even in
[38:20] this
[38:22] assemly you love the
[38:25] Lord putting on the whole arm of God
[38:28] that means when the arm of God is on
[38:31] y'all know the old
[38:32] armor the the that they wore you can't
[38:35] even see the nothing but you know you
[38:37] got the helmet on you got everything you
[38:39] know those Knights of armor you can't
[38:42] even see who's behind it all you can see
[38:44] is the War equipment amen hallelujah and
[38:48] that's what God wants us to be in that
[38:50] way to have on the War equipment that
[38:53] when Satan see us he doesn't see us he
[38:56] see the equipment we
[38:58] and the devil will respect that
[39:02] amen yes
[39:04] brother Rich
[39:07] yes seems like the the
[39:11] armor is important if you don't have
[39:15] train along
[39:18] it
[39:25] arm yes all of
[39:28] that you've been telling us about isn't
[39:33] that yes yes because you know this is
[39:38] kind of like those are not gifts no sir
[39:41] and
[39:43] and it's kind of like boot camp yes sir
[39:46] they put you into the situation so that
[39:49] you can handle that situation when you
[39:51] get there that's right and patience if
[39:55] if I need patience he's going to put me
[39:57] in place where whoa it's going to be
[39:59] hard yes some place where I have to have
[40:02] patience yes and that exercises that yes
[40:07] sir Faith muscle yes brother it's not a
[40:09] gift you have to go through God's boot
[40:12] camp to get all of those attributes so
[40:15] that you can graduate somay amen that's
[40:18] the truth did y'all everybody did
[40:20] everybody hear what he said and it's so
[40:22] true understand that the training
[40:24] actually comes by God he is the of
[40:27] Joshua amen he is the he's the captain
[40:30] of the Lord's host and so therefore he
[40:32] trains us and like I was saying when he
[40:36] when he brings you to a place and you
[40:39] let's say for example um virtue and you
[40:42] slip in that area you know what I'm
[40:45] that's and uh or or faith put it that
[40:48] way that means you can't go you can't go
[40:50] all the way up to Temperance yet amen
[40:53] every place in you must be sealed
[40:57] amen and that comes through
[41:00] training right is that right amen going
[41:04] with with Brother Rich said after Boot
[41:06] Camp or before when you train don't you
[41:09] have to go through a final
[41:11] test that and that final test you got to
[41:14] you got to score amen that's right yeah
[41:17] you you you're not going they're not
[41:18] going to just pass you and you're not
[41:20] with all that training and you haven't
[41:21] learned what you've been taught you
[41:24] don't you don't
[41:25] graduate amen you''ve got to gradu you
[41:28] graduate after that final test that you
[41:32] can swim whatever that may be or or hold
[41:36] your breath whatever the case may be you
[41:39] got to pass those exams at the end
[41:42] before they graduate you every last one
[41:45] of them and that's how it is with God
[41:48] he's training us now but you know what a
[41:50] lot of time people don't real because
[41:53] because we're not conscious of the
[41:56] training
[41:58] we look at everything as just being the
[42:00] devil right but you got to understand
[42:03] it's God putting you in those positions
[42:07] to
[42:08] train right so that you can be sealed in
[42:12] faith okay sealed in virt sealed
[42:15] knowledge what is
[42:17] knowledge he that cometh to God first
[42:21] must believe that he is God Amen and
[42:23] that he is a reward of them that
[42:25] diligently seek him not knowledge is to
[42:27] know that in the beginning was the word
[42:30] the word with God and the word is God
[42:33] Amen knowledge is not knowing all of the
[42:35] Bible knowledge is knowing the person of
[42:38] the Bible
[42:40] amen and we know we must understand that
[42:43] his word never fails amen it never fails
[42:47] I don't care what we go through it never
[42:53] fails
[42:55] right amen and so when we understand
[42:59] that that gives us Temperance wow I'm
[43:02] going to wait till my change come I love
[43:05] that job made a powerful statement
[43:08] though he slay me I'll trust him that's
[43:11] Temperance I'm going to wait to what my
[43:13] change clown y'all understand me that
[43:16] means I'm not going to be in haste I'm
[43:18] not going to rush I'm going to let God
[43:20] do his that's what and James says let
[43:23] Faith have her perfect work work you
[43:28] want Faith to have his perfect work you
[43:30] want it to be perfectly and
[43:33] entire not one little inch left I want
[43:36] it full so when I'm done I'm done amen
[43:43] yeah get me
[43:48] excited but that but I love that what
[43:50] Brother Rich implemented that was that
[43:52] was really good that was that was
[43:53] something that was really needed to to
[43:56] be said because the training comes from
[43:59] God right I I give you a sword and you
[44:01] don't know what to do with the sword
[44:03] what what good is a sword in your hand
[44:05] amen you must be trained and that's what
[44:08] God Said you know when when the Bible
[44:10] you got the Bible the Bible ain't here
[44:12] just for you to memorize and and know
[44:14] it's there exercise
[44:17] it you ought to be exercised in the
[44:21] scripture knowing when to speak when not
[44:24] to speak when to use the word when not
[44:25] to use the word that's all that's it a
[44:29] wise man knows it's not it's not good to
[44:31] to to to speak quickly amen the Bible
[44:34] say be a slow be
[44:36] slow fast quick to hear but slow to
[44:41] speak you love the Lord amen amen just
[44:44] give me a few more minutes
[44:53] here
[44:55] okay Paul says it here here says in the
[44:58] 19th verse and for me that utterance may
[45:01] be given to unto me that I may open my
[45:04] mouth boldly to make known The Mystery
[45:07] of the gospel for which I am an
[45:10] ambassador in bonds oh I love that I
[45:14] love that I love the word bonds I mean
[45:16] not just you know he's an ambassador but
[45:18] he's in such he's he's going to be so
[45:22] faithful he's and it's a willful Bond
[45:25] it's not like God done put some ropes
[45:27] around him but he's in bondage to to God
[45:31] uh and faithful to God as an ambassador
[45:34] I'm going to say it even if it ca my
[45:36] life that's basically what he's saying
[45:38] I'm going to tell you the truth even if
[45:40] it if it and that's a true Christian
[45:42] that is a real Christian that's going to
[45:44] give you the word even if mean you won't

[46:29] sending a messenger with a message and
[46:32] he's going to make known to you all of
[46:34] the things that I need to say all right
[46:37] let me read this one quote I I've got a
[46:39] few that I didn't get to but uh
[46:41] exposition of of of the seven Church
[46:43] agents uh brother Venom is saying uh
[46:46] thirdly he said he had the evidence of
[46:50] the fruit of god-given
[46:51] [Music]
[46:52] ministry 2 Corinthians 12:11 says I am
[46:56] become a fool
[46:58] in glorying ye have compelled me for I
[47:01] ought to have been commended of you for
[47:05] in nothing am I behind the very chiefest
[47:09] Apostle though I be nothing then he goes
[47:12] in the First Corinthians 9:2 he says if
[47:14] I be not an apostle unto others yet
[47:18] doubtless I am unto
[47:19] you for the Seal of my
[47:22] apostleship are ye in the Lord second
[47:26] Corin Ians 11:2 says for I am jealous
[47:29] over you with Godly jealous for I am
[47:32] exposing you to one husband that I may
[47:35] present to you as a Chase virgin unto
[47:38] Christ see Paul had been the means of
[47:41] bringing in multitudes of the Gentile
[47:43] sheep for he fed them and cared for them
[47:46] until they brought forth righteous
[47:48] fruits and were prepared to meet the
[47:50] Lord as part of a gentile bride so he
[47:54] was in bond he he he understood his men
[47:56] Ministry and he he
[47:58] literally gave all that he he could give
[48:01] out because his his purpose he wasn't
[48:04] trying to be a great bishop or an
[48:06] apostle he was working in God's program
[48:10] to literally try to get the church into
[48:12] a position where they would be spotless
[48:16] Amen in other words h a Chase bride unto
[48:19] the Lord I want to present and see
[48:21] that's what people don't understand
[48:23] preachers whatever the ministry is in
[48:25] the church they cannot spare the rod
[48:29] amen the rod comes to correct us amen
[48:33] the rod comes to deliver us it is the
[48:36] word of God it comes to clean us we're
[48:39] Washed by the Water of the word and and
[48:42] often time preachers are
[48:44] misunderstood because most people don't
[48:46] want them to meddle in their business
[48:49] but I don't mean no harm God is a
[48:50] meddler amen he going to meddle in your
[48:53] business
[48:56] that's what he does because he's Lov you
[48:59] he concerned about you right listen what
[49:01] brother R said he says our heavenly
[49:03] father we are certainly elated tonight
[49:06] to be assembled here with the groups of
[49:08] people this side of Eternity and have
[49:12] this fine fellowship and as we sat
[49:14] around these tables tonight looking
[49:17] across at each other and the business
[49:19] colleagues the Christians we are aware
[49:22] that there is a coming another time that
[49:25] we'll meet
[49:27] and and I loved it the way he said it
[49:29] because he said now we're meeting here
[49:31] in in this Dimension but this is not the
[49:33] end of it we're going to meet somewhere
[49:36] else amen there's a coming place that
[49:38] the saints of God is going to meet and
[49:40] and I go back to family when you can
[49:43] when you can put on the whole arm of God
[49:46] then you can actually see everybody as
[49:47] being your family amen that's the way it
[49:50] works you're not my other brother or my
[49:54] other
[49:55] sister yeah I don't like that but that's
[49:57] what people
[49:58] do yeah they they even give the natural
[50:01] family more privilege than a a love more
[50:05] than the spiritual amen something's
[50:08] wrong with that one y'all can say I'm
[50:10] wrong but I'm not I know I'm not
[50:13] wrong but we do it and the reason why we
[50:16] do it because we haven't been fully
[50:18] baptized with the Holy Ghost like we
[50:20] should because the children of Israel I
[50:23] mean excuse me on the day of Pentecost
[50:25] everybody else had family
[50:27] Ames but they became a real family when
[50:30] they got the Holy Ghost and they stuck
[50:33] together the Bible don't give all the
[50:36] details but there were many people who
[50:38] left their loved ones to follow the
[50:41] message of Peter and those who all
[50:44] followed the word they were family oh
[50:48] see how quiet y are but that's the truth
[50:51] that's true I'm just going by what Jesus
[50:53] said who is my mother who is my father
[50:55] who is my sister my my brother but those
[50:58] who follow what the the word of God my
[51:00] father do the father's will that's the
[51:03] real family because whether you believe
[51:05] it or not you wait till the squeeze come
[51:07] you going to find out who your real
[51:09] family
[51:13] is that's the way it
[51:16] works
[51:18] Hallelujah and the Christians we are
[51:20] aware that there is coming another time
[51:23] that we'll meet we trust that we'll we
[51:26] we'll all be there there everybody
[51:30] present at the great wedding supper in
[51:32] the air when the king will come out and
[51:35] wipe all tears from our eyes and say
[51:38] it's well done my good and faithful
[51:41] servant enter into the joys of the Lord
[51:43] that's been prepared for you since the
[51:47] foundation of the world and I'm I'm just
[51:49] working on a message called preparation
[51:50] of being prepared and and you know we
[51:53] look at these things and we we we don't
[51:55] understand that even even now the
[51:58] setting that we have here God knew
[52:00] exactly who was going to come to church
[52:02] God knows exactly who's receiving the
[52:04] word God knows exactly amen this was
[52:11] prepared that's that's way you know
[52:13] there's no coincidence with God Amen
[52:16] everything is prepared amen now here's
[52:19] this and we and I'm I'm I'm I know I'm
[52:22] I'm don't want to start but anyway
[52:23] coming from the reproach of the call uh
[52:25] the reproach for the the cause of the
[52:27] word paragraph 54 he said we had no way
[52:30] of bringing ourselves here or we do not
[52:34] know how we shall go out the Lord you
[52:38] give to us life and you have we we give
[52:42] our lives back to you amen and in so you
[52:46] have given us in exchange eternal life
[52:50] our faith breathes that into our very
[52:54] being and we love the for this because
[52:58] we know that someday we'll see you and
[53:02] you'll be in your glory and we'll look
[53:05] upon him and we'll we and we long to
[53:08] hear those words it was well done my
[53:11] good and faithful servant enter into the
[53:14] joy of the Lord that's been prepared for
[53:17] you since the foundation of the world
[53:20] until that time oh God when we all meet
[53:23] lead us so you got to understand that it
[53:26] is God who's leading us and he's leading
[53:30] to Leading us to a aare a place that has
[53:33] been prepared is that the word amen he
[53:36] told Moses he said I'm going to take you
[53:37] to a land flowing with milk and honey
[53:41] amen the land had already been prepared
[53:43] amen it was set up for the children of
[53:45] Israel they just had to get there amen
[53:49] hallelujah and everybody that followed
[53:52] Moses got there and everybody that
[53:55] followed Joshua properly got their
[53:57] Mountain
[53:59] amen
[54:00] see but those places were already
[54:03] already uh prepared amen Caleb's
[54:06] Mountain Joshua's Mountain they were
[54:09] there but we have to get there the city
[54:12] is already ready for ready for us amen
[54:16] but we got to get there and how we going
[54:18] to get there we got to kill the the
[54:20] habitants of the land we got to possess
[54:23] this land so much so to the devil don't
[54:26] know what to do with you
[54:28] amen may God help us
[54:32] all we all in battle amen you pray for
[54:35] me I'll pray for
[54:37] you
[54:39] right okay this is one it won't be long
[54:43] all right this is coming from a court
[54:47] trial paragraph 110 all right it went on
[54:50] for a while but on they talk about May
[54:53] 17th one morning it rained
[54:57] and is absolutely destroyed all those
[54:59] people that was put to a test against
[55:02] the word of God and saved those who
[55:05] belied God and made preparation for it
[55:08] amen see those who who rejected God the
[55:13] flood
[55:14] destroyed those who prepared
[55:18] themselves God saved amen and how did
[55:21] they prepare themselves by going into
[55:24] the Ark by listening to the word amen
[55:28] that's simple as it as it as can be my
[55:30] last quote amen uh so so so we
[55:34] understand when we when this is coming
[55:37] from The Sixth Seal uh paragraph 390 um
[55:42] we we must understand that when we got
[55:44] baptized we we we forget when we got
[55:47] baptized we oh Lord you you saved me I'm
[55:51] going to do all you want me to do I'm
[55:52] going to be faithful Lord you know I'm
[55:54] going to walk in your ways I'm going to
[55:56] y'all know the promises I don't remember
[55:58] your prayer but I can remember what I
[56:01] prayed somewhat you know what I mean I
[56:02] mean I was so out to God right but down
[56:07] the
[56:09] road because I fail and I'm saying it to
[56:12] you too when you fail to deny yourself
[56:16] and to when you fail to Die
[56:19] daily you literally losing your Revival
[56:23] amen you are going to grow cold that's
[56:26] right that's just it you got to pray
[56:29] that's what people don't you know pray
[56:30] is the prayer brings the fire you know
[56:33] it's nothing you you you at the altar
[56:35] and you got the wood you got the you got
[56:37] the the sacrifice but where's the
[56:41] fire
[56:43] prayer brings the
[56:46] fire and that that's that's all I can
[56:49] say but here it says and uh 390 uh it
[56:53] says now father I pray that all that
[56:55] will receive you at this time in their
[56:58] hearts will settle for it forever at
[57:02] this hour that they are finished with
[57:05] sin sin is unbelief that they will rise
[57:08] and make preparations now talk about the
[57:12] public confession a baptism in the name
[57:14] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[57:16] their sins to show that they believe
[57:18] that God has forgiven them and they take
[57:21] on the name of Jesus Christ we forget it
[57:25] but Paul said put on the whole arm of
[57:27] God remember your name if we could
[57:31] remember that our name is his name the
[57:35] name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's who
[57:38] we are the whole family of of Heaven and
[57:41] Earth is named after him and if we can't
[57:45] whatever we can't we can't do it in the
[57:47] name of Jesus it shouldn't be done
[57:50] amen that's the way it works put on the
[57:53] whole arm of God let your faith take you
[57:56] on to higher Heights every one of us are
[57:58] going through battles right now and if
[58:01] you're not going through battles you
[58:02] need to check check check check
[58:04] something
[58:05] out something ain't right and I don't
[58:08] mean these little water down battles I'm
[58:11] talking about intense amen battles you
[58:14] know what I mean and I don't know about
[58:16] you all but I am I'm going through some
[58:18] great battles it's okay I'm to be honest
[58:21] with you I see God changing me and I see
[58:24] God getting my attention more often now
[58:27] when I go wrong he he makes me see where
[58:31] I'm wrong and you know the the thing
[58:34] about it even and and I said it like
[58:36] this by the grace of God if you can't
[58:39] see the coming of the Lord now I don't
[58:42] know what to say amen I I really don't
[58:45] everything is falling apart not just
[58:48] America
[58:50] everywhere demonic powers are joining
[58:53] together and and and we don't even see
[58:55] it
[58:56] but so that you'll know and now whether
[58:59] this this news article is true I I
[59:02] received it and uh we know that this
[59:06] present I when they get they going to
[59:09] have this Vatican thing soon um uh the
[59:12] united united churches um the church
[59:15] World Council church is getting ready to
[59:16] have this big thing United Nation is
[59:19] what I mean and our country is getting
[59:22] ready to sign us off to
[59:26] Who and the United Nation when that
[59:30] happens all of the American rights are
[59:33] finished there's no such thing as a
[59:35] constitution
[59:37] then yes part of
[59:42] that part of what they enacted this week
[59:46] at the United Nations
[59:48] after what you just said was that every
[59:52] country has to have every citizen
[59:57] so when you when you realize uh uh
[1:00:02] what's happening
[1:00:03] now what has been kept from us by what I
[1:00:07] understand uh we say well how these
[1:00:09] illegal aliens coming in but they're not
[1:00:12] what what what's been hidden from a lot
[1:00:14] of us is that they've been given
[1:00:15] citizenship this is why they have and
[1:00:19] getting what they getting we we're
[1:00:21] getting the last end of everything so
[1:00:24] what so you understand this is not just
[1:00:26] happening in America it's happening
[1:00:30] everywhere and whatever country that
[1:00:32] will not bow they put him in war to kill
[1:00:35] them off amen so you understand what
[1:00:38] we're working with now I'm saying this
[1:00:41] and I said all of that not because I
[1:00:43] love my country and uh I know I'm from
[1:00:46] Heaven brother vandom said when it comes
[1:00:48] to America she says you gotta you gotta
[1:00:51] you got to stand with her in her glory
[1:00:53] and stand with her in her shame so it
[1:00:56] doesn't mean that I'm going to do what
[1:00:57] she's doing I I hate to see where she's
[1:00:59] going come but we know the prophecy we
[1:01:03] we know it people right but the the like
[1:01:07] I said the greatest thing now we
[1:01:10] must deal with this man on the
[1:01:13] inside right somebody we know oh well I
[1:01:17] got to get married before the Rapture
[1:01:18] that'll be fine
[1:01:20] too you you SE your corn your wheat your
[1:01:22] whatever it's
[1:01:24] fine but what we fail to see it's the
[1:01:26] bigger picture cuz even over there you
[1:01:30] won't have husband and wives everything
[1:01:32] going to be brothers and sisters
[1:01:34] Hallelujah just like it was in the
[1:01:35] beginning amen so I I want y'all to
[1:01:39] understand don't think God cheating you
[1:01:41] out of nothing cuz I can't hardly wait
[1:01:43] to get to heaven I can't hardly wait
[1:01:44] till my change come y'all can I guess
[1:01:47] I'm old man now but I can't I've been
[1:01:49] feeling this way for a mighty long time
[1:01:52] so but I but I don't want to go with out
[1:01:56] meeting the measure that God wants me to
[1:01:59] meet I want to hear well
[1:02:03] done and so I just want to encourage
[1:02:05] y'all tonight if the Lord would Grant
[1:02:08] you Grace to say Lord increase my prayer

[1:02:28] stand as we say thank you for your
[1:02:30] patience putting on that whole arm of
[1:02:32] God is actually taking the word of God
[1:02:35] and covering yourself with it so much so
[1:02:37] that you can't be seen only God can be
[1:02:40] seen and as we know God has Us in this
[1:02:44] training right now and you got to
