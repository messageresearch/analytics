[0:22] amen we thank the Lord for you this
[0:24] evening running just a little bit behind
[0:27] but uh we do thank the Lord for bringing
[0:30] us here by the grace of God and uh we do
[0:35] thank the Lord for all of you who are
[0:38] who made it uh your choice to be here
[0:44] amen let's stand and just have a word of
[0:47] prayer
[0:53] please our Heavenly Father God as we
[0:55] come before you Lord Jesus we thank you
[0:57] for your grace and your mercy Lord we
[0:59] pray that you forgive us and cleanse us
[1:01] from all our unrighteousness today oh
[1:03] Lord we have been so busy Lord doing
[1:06] things that Lord just uh just took us oh
[1:10] God but Lord we thank you for what
[1:13] you've done for us and giving our
[1:15] brother aliser safe flight oh God to
[1:18] Tucson and Lord we thank you for the
[1:20] word that we have previously received
[1:22] through him we pray our father that the
[1:25] word that has been sown would uh bring
[1:27] forth a hundredfold in our lives bless
[1:30] the little bible study Lord as we
[1:32] approach the word of God we pray that
[1:34] you will sanctify to the to our our
[1:37] hearts oh God make it a part of us and
[1:40] father please speak the words that you
[1:42] would have us to know tonight we ask
[1:45] these things in your name Jesus Christ
[1:46] we pray amen you may be
[1:50] seated I want to entitle this little
[1:53] session uh by the grace of God the
[1:55] season of Vengeance the season of
[1:58] vengeance
[2:00] and the reason why I'm I'm bringing this
[2:03] out like this is because we know uh when
[2:08] we read Jeremiah we see so many of the
[2:11] things that uh God uh did through uh
[2:17] brother brandham Malachi 4 so I wanted
[2:21] to read that just to start it off
[2:23] tonight Malachi 4 5-6 we're going to
[2:26] read that we know also that uh
[2:30] Malachi 4 expresses a a a a different
[2:34] Elijah than the one uh Malachi 3 uh
[2:39] speaks of Malachi 3 speaks of John the
[2:43] Baptist and Malachi 45 speaks of Jesus I
[2:48] mean brother brand I excuse me I'm sorry
[2:50] the Elijah that will come in this day so
[2:53] we appreciate God and all that he's
[2:55] doing and has done for us and I just
[2:58] thank God because that one
[3:01] scripture uh Hebrews 13 and8 that
[3:05] declares Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[3:07] today and forever uh really uh it
[3:10] balances out uh the Bible in the sense
[3:13] that we understand that God cannot
[3:16] change he cannot change uh what he was
[3:19] yesterday and he is today and what he
[3:22] was and what he is today he will be
[3:24] forever more we love the character of
[3:27] God this is why we read the Bible we to
[3:30] come to better understand God's
[3:32] character things that he like and the
[3:35] things that he does not like as we read
[3:39] Malachi 4:5 starting at the fifth verse
[3:42] it says behold I will send you Elijah
[3:45] the prophet before the coming of the
[3:47] great and Dreadful day of the Lord and
[3:50] he shall turn the hearts of the father
[3:51] to the children and the hearts of the
[3:54] children to their fathers lest I come
[3:57] and smite the Earth with a curse
[4:02] now we know what God has
[4:05] done um and we know that this Elijah
[4:09] following him comes the destruction of
[4:13] the world and even as Jeremiah dealing
[4:16] with the Jews we we spoke many times and
[4:20] told you how Jeremiah was elected by God
[4:23] he was a prophet uh so much so that God
[4:26] told Jeremiah that he knew him before he
[4:29] was conceived received in his mother's
[4:30] womb and um so we know by God's grace
[4:34] that Jeremiah was a true prophet of God
[4:37] but you see in the days of Jeremiah he
[4:39] had a lot of
[4:40] unbelievers because Jeremiah prophesied
[4:44] and things like that it did not say that
[4:46] the people believed him and it's always
[4:49] that way Jesus says a prophet is without
[4:53] honor in his own country often times
[4:57] people don't see what the prophet is
[4:58] being is said staying until the prophet
[5:01] has gone off the scene and we know that
[5:03] to be true Jesus uh was in just a small
[5:07] space uh what we call Palestine I mean
[5:11] the whole world didn't see him the whole
[5:13] world knew nothing about his crucifixion
[5:15] and the things that he went through the
[5:17] whole of the world never knew he had 12
[5:19] disciples and those things I mean it was
[5:22] after the death of Christ we came to
[5:25] understand who he really was I mean it
[5:28] was that way even with his disciples
[5:30] they followed him three and A2 years and
[5:32] it was after his death they truly
[5:35] believe and receive that he was the
[5:38] Messiah of that day so is it with
[5:40] brother brandom many of the people that
[5:42] followed him they claimed they believed
[5:44] him but they did not and many of them
[5:47] didn't understand who he was until after
[5:50] he had passed away and gone but there is
[5:54] always that Remnant that God always deal
[5:56] with so I want to say this by the grace
[5:58] of God every nation that God raised up
[6:02] to destroy Israel God didn't come back
[6:05] around and he judged that Nation for
[6:07] doing so uh that's the way it is and we
[6:11] know that Babylon was a real great City
[6:14] during that time they had great Kings
[6:17] and and and everything but every one of
[6:20] those kings everyone that God raised up
[6:23] God brought down and it was all because
[6:26] of Israel and God being just so I want
[6:29] say this we never want God Justice we
[6:33] always want his mercy and Grace now
[6:37] Jeremiah had prophesied a lot of things
[6:40] he even told zedekiah he would be
[6:42] destroyed he would be killed zedekiah
[6:44] was a king and he was a king of unbelief
[6:47] he he just did not believe the
[6:49] Prophecies of and I'm a reason why I'm
[6:52] not reading right now it because I'm
[6:54] trying to summarize the things before I
[6:56] go further this book is a great book and
[6:59] and it's
[7:00] has a lot of things in it but anyway um
[7:03] and
[7:04] zedar when when the king came uh
[7:07] Nebuchadnezzar came and everything else
[7:10] uh zedekiah was not only killed uh
[7:13] brought before the king uh excuse me I'm
[7:15] sorry but his sons were killed in in the
[7:18] face of the king as NE uh as uh Jeremiah
[7:23] prophesied that they would be and
[7:26] zedekiah eyes were pled out a't that
[7:29] amazing
[7:30] uh he had eyes to see but because he
[7:32] couldn't see the prophet uh God had his
[7:35] eyes plucked out by Babylon in other
[7:38] words he went into darkness and the word
[7:40] of God Jedi means uh the Lord is just
[7:44] and and that's what happened God God's
[7:47] justice fell on zedekiah who was really
[7:51] like a shadow type of the day that we're
[7:54] living in lead deia uh because Israel
[7:57] had become so bad
[7:59] it was terrible that God said they their
[8:02] hearts were like iron and and and and
[8:05] and and as hard as a diamond and so you
[8:08] got to understand a diamond is a very
[8:10] hard thing it's not something that could
[8:11] be easily broken crushed or or or it
[8:14] takes a diamond to cut a diamond so we
[8:17] find out that God couldn't even reach
[8:19] them even in the time that God started
[8:22] with uh Jeremiah he told Jeremiah he
[8:25] said uh I'm going to cause you to preach
[8:26] to these people but they hard
[8:29] hard-hearted and and and they won't
[8:31] listen they're not going to listen and
[8:34] because they not going to listen
[8:36] basically I've sent prophets I've seen
[8:38] all kinds of witnesses before Israel but
[8:41] the more I sin the more hardened they
[8:43] become the more they become more like
[8:46] the world now I want to ask a question
[8:49] before I go any further what was one of
[8:52] the main reason why God didn't want
[8:54] Israel to mix with the other tribal
[8:57] people anybody know
[9:00] ID idolatry was one of them that's
[9:04] true it was their
[9:07] lifestyle these people were so wicked
[9:10] they were so filthy they had all manner
[9:14] of diseases running through their bodies
[9:17] according to history and all of these
[9:20] diseases were brought upon them because
[9:23] of their sexual activities they had gods
[9:27] that that uh uh that Worship in the way
[9:31] of
[9:32] origes and you know I heard a
[9:35] description people said well I'm
[9:38] pansexual and I didn't know what that
[9:40] was until today and pansexual means you
[9:44] you as a person will have sex with
[9:46] anything a horse a dog a cat it just
[9:51] doesn't uh just doesn't um the
[9:55] boundaries is just not men or women it
[9:58] there is no boundaries and we know
[10:01] that's exactly what happened in the days
[10:03] of Sodom that's what happened in the
[10:05] days of Noah and is and and as long as
[10:08] Israel kept mixing with these kind of
[10:11] people that's why God said don't marry
[10:12] them because they had sexual diseases
[10:15] that would be transferred into the blood
[10:18] that would cause blindness remember when
[10:21] that man was blind and and and they
[10:23] asked Jesus who did Sin see that was one
[10:26] of the reasons because uh uh these
[10:29] things were
[10:31] transferred to Israel and Israel was
[10:34] many of them were sick because of their
[10:36] mixture and mixing with the neighbors uh
[10:40] PE neighborhood people and tribes and
[10:42] things like that now I say all of this
[10:45] to bring you to a place when when the
[10:49] cup of the amorites are full that means
[10:53] everybody is so
[10:55] polluted in the
[10:57] natural that there is no ter turning
[10:59] back now why would you say that so if
[11:02] you can see where America is now the cup
[11:06] is almost full I mean you search to to I
[11:10] can't even say it search the record and
[11:13] you find out that venal disease is on a
[11:16] rapid but people don't care and what
[11:20] they don't understand is a curse it's a
[11:22] judgment is the Vengeance of the Lord
[11:25] that they are now partaking in and we we
[11:29] we look at these things it's as as if
[11:31] it's nothing and I'm going to say it
[11:32] like this Solomon said there's no new
[11:35] thing under the sun and we come to the
[11:38] end where the cup of the amorites is is
[11:40] about full I mean it's not only have
[11:43] they mixed so much in the natural uh
[11:48] sense of lust but they have mixed uh
[11:51] churches and and all of these things and
[11:54] and the Bible said two can't walk
[11:55] together except they be agreed and so we
[11:58] find out that this is what Israel was
[12:01] doing they and and believe you or not
[12:04] believe but what was God doing with
[12:06] Israel he was breaking them and in
[12:10] reality he was preserving them he
[12:14] literally beat them and chasen them as
[12:17] children and locked them up in Babylon
[12:21] so they had no way especially to to
[12:24] spread diseases or for diseases to be
[12:27] spread to them
[12:29] that's right and God preserved them uh
[12:33] by way of the king God said told to
[12:36] Israel by Jeremiah if you if you allow
[12:39] King Nebuchadnezzar to take you go down
[12:42] to Babylon serve him you'll be serving
[12:45] him for 70 years I will preserve you and
[12:48] I will bring you out and that's what he
[12:51] did look at the anointing that God put
[12:54] on Shadrach mesach and
[12:56] abedo right they were determined not to
[12:58] do what defile themselves they weren't
[13:02] going to defile themselves with food
[13:04] they weren't going to defile themselves
[13:05] with women they weren't going to defile
[13:08] themselves by worshiping any other God
[13:10] they had determined within themselves
[13:13] they would stay righteous because they
[13:15] knew that was the reason why they was in
[13:18] Babylon because they had began to
[13:20] worship idols and everything else and
[13:23] forgot about God and the Judgment comes
[13:27] to the king of Babylon as well as as as
[13:29] I said
[13:31] so one thing of certain also God brings
[13:35] in Moab in this and when I was reading
[13:37] about Moab I thought about around the 48
[13:40] 49th chapter around the 50 God talks
[13:43] about Moab and how God is going to
[13:45] destroy and chasen Moab now you got to
[13:47] realize that God is calling all of these
[13:49] kind of names and you got to understand
[13:52] that all is the Lords and God can do
[13:55] what he wants to do he raised up a
[13:57] nation he brings them down he use them
[13:59] for this as a a vessel of honor and then
[14:02] he comes around and and destroy the
[14:04] vessel of Honor yall understand I mean
[14:06] dishonor excuse me now so I want to I
[14:08] want to come and bring you all the way
[14:10] up because I I am I'm skipping a lot but
[14:13] let's get down by the grace of God let's
[14:15] come to uh Jeremiah the 50th
[14:19] chapter Jeremiah
[14:23] 50 and as I said a lot of things have
[14:26] taken place I want you to read Jeremiah
[14:29] uh thoroughly as as thoroughly as you
[14:31] possibly can uh if you see anything that
[14:34] that you would have me to teach on in
[14:36] the in the in the books that I kind of
[14:38] jumped over uh just let me know and I
[14:41] will I will do my best to do
[14:44] that the word of the
[14:47] Lord the word that the Lord spake
[14:51] against Babylon and you know why I love
[14:54] this because America and Rome all
[14:59] together all the churches is spiritual
[15:04] Babylon and they have done
[15:08] exactly in the natural as well in the
[15:11] spiritual that the old Babylon done has
[15:14] done Bible said that Babylon was the
[15:17] cage of every unclean and hateful bird
[15:22] you understand what that means God has
[15:25] imprisoned them already locked in
[15:30] and and and brother Brandon preached a
[15:32] message Souls that are in prison now so
[15:35] they're there they're in their religion
[15:38] there the and and and Moab was what Moab
[15:41] was the son of lot and his daughter and
[15:45] they he was he was bought into this
[15:47] world by way of
[15:49] incest right and so he he came in more
[15:54] corrupt right as we heard our brother
[15:56] preach the other day that's why it had
[15:58] to be a virgin because amen there was a
[16:02] a a a certain standard that God was
[16:06] looking for and God couldn't use the
[16:09] woman nor could he use the man in such a
[16:11] way so God had to find a a woman that
[16:15] could house the god of the blood of God
[16:18] and and the seed of God Mary had nothing
[16:21] to do with it she was an incubator but
[16:23] we needed that uh type of uh virgin SE
[16:28] uh to be able to join with God and so is
[16:30] it
[16:31] now God called for virginy us being
[16:35] virgins to the word obedient to the word
[16:38] now we're not speaking natural now we're
[16:40] speaking spiritually and that word means
[16:42] that we're not going to get plac to the
[16:44] devil's lies and his deception and
[16:48] that's why God sent us a prophet see
[16:51] those who did not obey Jeremiah many of
[16:54] them died by the hand of the
[16:57] Babylonians right and you're going to
[16:59] find out in this 50th chapter if we can
[17:01] get through it that God
[17:04] destroys
[17:07] Babylon the word that the word that the
[17:10] Lord spake against Babylon and against
[17:13] the land of the Chans by Jeremiah the
[17:16] prophet declare ye y ye among the
[17:20] Nations and publish and set up a
[17:23] standard publish and conceal not say
[17:27] Babylon is taken Bale is
[17:30] confounded meido is broken in pieces her
[17:34] Idols are confounded Her Image are
[17:36] broken in pieces and you so what do you
[17:39] mean brother Brooks we understand that
[17:41] those demons out of the Euphrates am me
[17:43] went into Hollywood and Hollywood is a
[17:46] representation of what uh the the the
[17:48] demons and the power of Satan from where
[17:51] the anian world the Judgment of the Lord
[17:55] and we understand that these things
[17:57] these demons had come back uh once the
[18:00] the the the cap of as brother bam said
[18:03] the lid of hell was taken off and now we
[18:06] see the flooding of these demons to do
[18:10] what bring the world back into the
[18:14] state of judgment where God can do
[18:17] nothing but judge but understand the
[18:20] prophet of God says before God said
[18:22] judgment he always brings a
[18:25] warning you said why are you saying this
[18:28] don't you understand what I'm trying to
[18:29] say we didn't have Jeremiah but we had
[18:32] William Brandon we had we had a a
[18:34] Prophet by the you know under the
[18:36] inspiration of Elijah that God said that
[18:39] when he was done the world would burn so
[18:43] what are you looking for the point is
[18:45] we're living almost in the same kind of
[18:48] day people's hearts are hard you can
[18:51] preach all you want to and people still
[18:54] believe because they belong to this
[18:57] message they're going to have
[18:59] with no change in heart no change in
[19:02] lives no change at all they do what they
[19:04] want to do and come to church and feel
[19:06] like they all right that's exactly what
[19:08] Israel would do and God hated that kind
[19:11] of
[19:13] action let's go on I'm sorry for out of
[19:16] the North there cometh up a nation
[19:18] against her which shall make her land
[19:21] desolate and None Shall dwell therein
[19:24] they shall they shall remove they shall
[19:27] depart both men and Beast now wait we
[19:30] know what we have heard been taught that
[19:33] in our day not only that does the ones
[19:36] from the north Russia is going to be on
[19:38] the soil China is on the soil and all of
[19:42] these things are happening because it is
[19:44] the Vengeance of God we have not reached
[19:48] the climax of all these things but God
[19:51] listen listen have your ears open as we
[19:53] continue to read and I I looked at the
[19:55] chapter 50 50 means Jubilee 50 means
[19:58] freedom
[19:59] and and God is saying to us amen we we
[20:02] can have this Freedom I'm giving you the
[20:04] warning I'm telling you the truth now
[20:07] what we going to do with it are we going
[20:08] to be like Babylon oh I'm a
[20:11] Jew we we're safe under the message no
[20:14] you're not you're not safe unless you're
[20:17] in the message and the message is in you
[20:20] no religion is
[20:21] safe that's not the shelter of God the
[20:24] shelter of God is under the blood of the
[20:26] Lamb of Jesus Christ that's the only
[20:29] shelter in those days in that time said
[20:32] the Lord the children of Israel shall
[20:34] come they and their children of Judah
[20:37] together coming and weeping they shall
[20:39] go and seek the Lord their God now if
[20:41] that ain't what's happening right now
[20:44] amen Israel is seeking the face of God
[20:48] they shall they shall ask the Way to
[20:51] Zion with their faes thither toward
[20:54] saying come and let us join ourselves to
[20:56] the Lord in a Perpetual Covenant that
[20:58] shall NE not be forgotten so in all of
[21:03] this judgment God is still waking him up
[21:07] now you know and I know what Israel has
[21:10] suffered because of their rejection and
[21:14] they they rejected God because they were
[21:16] Wicked and and and filthy matter of fact
[21:19] John said you Generation of Vipers it
[21:22] had gotten so bad till it was like
[21:24] almost the same day of Jeremiah nothing
[21:27] but snakes majority of them were snakes
[21:30] and that's why they could say uh let let
[21:33] let let's blood be on us and our
[21:36] children see they couldn't see it they
[21:39] were
[21:39] blind
[21:41] blind yeah but this is the end of it
[21:44] there's not coming another generation
[21:47] this is this is it you know my people
[21:51] have been lost sheep their Shepherds
[21:54] have caused them to go astray they have
[21:57] turned them away on the mountains they
[22:00] have gone from the mountain to heal they
[22:03] have forgotten their resting place and
[22:06] you see now people should should be here
[22:09] you know what's happening with them
[22:10] they're fighting demons every day all
[22:13] kinds of demons lust demons sexual
[22:16] demons you name it they're fighting but
[22:18] where are they where are the
[22:21] people and if you don't come to church
[22:23] you know what you're going to do to it
[22:24] you going to yield to those Spirits you
[22:26] come to church for faith for strength
[22:29] for connection with God so you'll know
[22:32] the next move and and what people don't
[22:35] understand they they they they hand the
[22:36] word like it's a
[22:38] newspaper and and you're not going to
[22:40] get anything but news that's it but the
[22:43] word comes to change us people Jeremiah
[22:46] is not sitting here for it to be a book
[22:49] of History Jesus Christ is same
[22:51] yesterday today forever we are the
[22:54] spiritual Israel and what God did to
[22:57] them God is going to do to us and is
[23:00] doing to us because of our Disobedience
[23:03] and our
[23:04] idolatry and a lot of people are
[23:06] idolators and don't even know
[23:09] it yeah some people worship their Church
[23:12] some people worship holidays all kind of
[23:14] stuff and you'll find out that we are
[23:17] the same same
[23:19] way we're doing the same
[23:22] thing many people have been lost sheep
[23:26] their Shepherds have caused them to go
[23:28] astray is that right preachers they have
[23:30] turned them away on the mountains they
[23:32] have gone from mountains to heill they
[23:34] have forgotten their resting place all
[23:38] that found that found them have devoured
[23:41] them and their adversary says we offend
[23:43] them not because they have sinned
[23:45] against the Lord and habitations of
[23:48] Justice even the Lord the hope of their
[23:50] father remove out of the midst of
[23:53] Babylon and go forth out of the land of
[23:54] the Chans and be as the as a heo before
[23:58] the blocks and that's what God has
[24:00] always called for his people a total
[24:02] separation of unbelief amen this is what
[24:05] God is calling for now a total
[24:07] separation but it's so difficult for us
[24:10] like the brother said God is not God is
[24:12] interested in your soul now the message
[24:15] the word is for the soul we allow our
[24:18] Spirits if you can heal the soul the
[24:21] spirit will fall in line the flesh will
[24:23] fall in line but your objective is when
[24:26] when you disbelieve in your soul is like
[24:29] a a a how can I say it uh h a domino
[24:33] effect if you're not believing in your
[24:35] soul your spirit fall and so will your
[24:40] flesh I was telling somebody the other
[24:43] day well matter of fact today I said how
[24:45] is it that we can we we we want to be
[24:48] Pentecostal and then we don't even
[24:50] understand what that mean but I'm I'll
[24:52] say it like this when brother brandham
[24:54] came did you ever see brother brandham
[24:57] wrestled with a demon
[24:59] did you ever see him fight with one did
[25:01] you ever see him beg one no brother
[25:04] Brandon prayed the demon was
[25:07] gone right you talking about the
[25:09] apostolic way the apostolic way is when
[25:13] your Shadow will heal Lord the apostolic
[25:18] way is when the devil see you coming
[25:20] they're scared amen we cast Devils out
[25:24] just by our presence amen you see what
[25:27] I'm saying that's the real way now how
[25:30] far away are we from
[25:33] that we see what the Pentecostals come
[25:36] on out devil come on out you gotta come
[25:38] out that ain't that's not even
[25:41] scriptural Jesus spoke the word and
[25:44] those Devils had to
[25:46] obey not only that the apostolic way is
[25:50] what when the devil knows your
[25:53] name the sons of ska they didn't know
[25:56] the names of those they says who are you
[25:59] Paul we know y'all know what I'm saying
[26:02] but see they did the devil says we can't
[26:04] recognize you because you don't have
[26:07] what it
[26:09] takes and that is the true way of the
[26:12] Bride but if we don't turn loose the
[26:15] World we'll never get there everything
[26:18] must die as he said and rot it's not the
[26:22] word that's is ineffective is
[26:25] us we want to hold on on to our lustful
[26:29] thoughts and
[26:31] desires ninth verse but lo I will raise
[26:34] and cause to come up against Babylon an
[26:37] assembly of a great nation from the
[26:39] North country and they shall set
[26:41] themselves in Array against her from
[26:44] then she shall be taken their arrows
[26:47] shall be as a mighty expert man and none
[26:50] shall return return in vain the Talan
[26:54] shall be a spoil all that spoil her
[26:57] shall be satisfied said the Lord because
[26:59] ye were glad because ye Rejoice oh ye
[27:05] destroyer of my Heritage you see what
[27:08] I'm saying God raised them up they
[27:10] rejoiced because they conquered Israel
[27:13] and and so will it be the same people
[27:16] who conquered or think they conquered
[27:18] the church the real Church the foolish
[27:20] virgins they themselves will be caught
[27:23] up and destroyed Babylon you know
[27:25] brother brandham said only Jesus Christ
[27:28] will be able to stop
[27:30] her it's so deep and ingrained in
[27:33] everybody it's so in people's DNA till
[27:37] they don't even see the difference
[27:39] systematic worship all of that came from
[27:43] Babylon raising men up higher than they
[27:46] should
[27:48] be that's
[27:50] Babylonian when when Jesus came and he
[27:53] found s Pharisees Sadducees scribes and
[27:55] aodan where did you think they got that
[27:57] from
[27:58] they got it from Babylon they brought
[28:01] all of that stuff and when they when
[28:03] Jesus came they were so mixed up they
[28:05] couldn't even recognize the word and so
[28:08] is it
[28:09] now it was so mixed up in Jeremiah's Day
[28:13] by different influences by false
[28:15] prophets that even Israel had until they
[28:19] could not recognize the voice of of God
[28:23] they thought they were in a season of
[28:25] blessings when they were in a season of
[28:27] cursing
[28:28] and that's where the church is today
[28:30] you're in a season of
[28:32] cursing you're in a season of repentance
[28:36] is that is that the word the Bible said
[28:38] according to uh uh Revelation Third
[28:41] chapter repent to the lay of SE Church
[28:44] AG repent be zous to repent you know let
[28:49] let be tried in the
[28:52] fire that you'll come out as pure gold
[28:55] but you know it it's it becomes a story
[28:58] to people they don't take it seriously
[29:00] anymore I mean we us should take this
[29:02] message really serious but that's what
[29:05] happens when you don't allow it to
[29:07] connect to your heart it
[29:10] fades it becomes
[29:12] boring and you and I must know by God's
[29:15] grace amen that once the word becomes
[29:18] boring you in Def you in trouble let
[29:22] move on I know I'm not going fast enough

[30:49] the grass and Bellows or Bellows as
[30:51] Bulls your mother shall be sore
[30:54] confounded she that bear you shall be
[30:56] ashamed behold the hind the most uh of
[31:01] the nation shall be a Wilderness a dry
[31:03] land a desert because of the Wrath of
[31:06] the Lord it shall not be inhabited but
[31:08] it shall be wholly desolate everyone
[31:11] that goeth by Babylon shall be astonish
[31:14] and hiss at her plagues now I want to
[31:17] say this you know and I know that is the
[31:20] truth Israel was so desolate and so
[31:23] Barren for so many years nobody thought
[31:26] it could ever be inhabited gain but God
[31:29] had a prophecy that that Israel will
[31:31] return and he would restore like he said
[31:33] in Malachi for us God will restore so
[31:36] when Israel came back to their Homeland
[31:39] because of God punishing them and and
[31:42] spanking them and chising them by way of
[31:45] Hitler musan musan U musolini and and
[31:50] others amen they were driven back to the
[31:54] Homeland and and now we see them as a FL
[31:56] a nation but it ain't all over Jesus
[32:00] said when they come become as a nation
[32:02] you know that summer is nigh That season
[32:05] is nigh what what season the destruction
[32:09] the destruction and of the Gentile
[32:11] Nations and the rebuilding of Israel
[32:14] that's where we are we're at right at
[32:17] the crooks of this thing and and is
[32:20] about to happen and we see that if we
[32:23] don't get on the side of the Prophet
[32:25] believe what brother Ram believe the
[32:28] message of the hour receive the message
[32:30] of the looking for what the
[32:33] Messiah because if not that's the only
[32:36] safety there is an exodus and brother BR
[32:40] preached the Third Exodus this is what
[32:41] we're talking about there is an exodus
[32:45] Israel had an exodus and they were
[32:48] brought into Babylon but then they also
[32:50] had an exodus when they came out of
[32:51] Babylon into 70 years they were there
[32:54] right that was all God God did every one
[32:57] of of those
[32:59] things right but and you think they
[33:01] would have learned now if you take
[33:03] Israel right now you just got a little
[33:06] small group of people that's really
[33:09] Israel it's a small country but if you
[33:12] take Tel Aviv Tel Aviv is one of the
[33:14] most wickedest places on the face of the
[33:17] Earth it is absolutely the capital of
[33:22] homosexuality my wife and I were there
[33:24] in Israel they wouldn't even take us to
[33:26] Israel I mean Tel because it was so e
[33:28] evil that was years ago I can't even
[33:31] imagine what it's like
[33:33] now and what I'm trying to say is Tel
[33:36] Aviv is no no different than Los
[33:39] Angeles and all of these people all of
[33:42] these things going to be judged they are
[33:44] judged they they're ready for the
[33:45] Vengeance of God and what is the
[33:47] Vengeance of God today
[33:50] fire
[33:51] fire everybody want to push the
[33:55] button we're right in the face of
[33:58] it right put yourself in Array against
[34:02] Babylon around about all ye that be the
[34:05] bow and shoot of her spare no arrows for
[34:08] she have sinned against the Lord and
[34:11] what did God what did God do you you you
[34:14] so well brother what are you saying when
[34:15] the when the world especially that that
[34:19] particular country I won't call the name
[34:22] when they realized who is behind all of
[34:26] this evil
[34:28] we know that they will be
[34:33] bombed yeah God will rais up and has
[34:37] raised up a nation not only to bomb them
[34:40] but to bomb us
[34:43] too it will happen it must
[34:47] happen but thank God that the Bride of
[34:50] Jesus Christ will be gone that's
[34:53] right everybody that followed the order
[34:56] of Jeremiah
[35:00] lived and everybody that didn't follow
[35:02] the order God didn't care what Jew they
[35:04] was what tribe they was where they came
[35:06] from how they how old they were they
[35:09] died there were those who tried to
[35:11] escape by going to Egypt and God raised
[35:14] up an enemy to go attack Egypt and they
[35:17] God killed them in Egypt see there's no
[35:20] hiding place other than in the pl in in
[35:23] in other than under the blood of Jesus
[35:25] Christ amen let's go on I'm sorry shout
[35:29] against her roundabout she have given
[35:31] her hand her foundation all Fallen her
[35:35] walls are thrown down for it is the
[35:37] Vengeance of the Lord take vengeance
[35:40] upon her as she have done do unto her is
[35:43] that right Book of Revelation said
[35:46] double the
[35:47] cup double her pay what she's done said
[35:52] said that that that the blood of all the
[35:54] martyrs is in her she's killed us she's
[35:58] destroyed us and God said because you
[36:00] done it I'm going to destroy you don't
[36:03] you understand that when the bride is
[36:05] gone and then then then after the the
[36:08] foolish virgin when she's uh dealt with
[36:11] what's left pure
[36:14] serpents and God destroy them
[36:17] all so that you'll
[36:19] know make sure you count it in the in
[36:22] the
[36:23] number 17th verse Israel I'm not gonna
[36:27] Israel is is is is a is a is a scattered
[36:31] sheep the Lions have driven from her
[36:34] from him away the king of Assyria have
[36:38] devoured him and and last this
[36:40] Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon have
[36:43] broken his bones therefore thus said the
[36:46] Lord of hosts the god of Israel behold I
[36:48] will punish the king of Babylon and his
[36:51] land as I have punished the king of
[36:53] Assyria now God raised these uh these
[36:56] people up to chastise Israel and then
[36:59] God comes right back around and destroy
[37:01] the countries that did so they enjoyed
[37:05] it and you say well what do you mean
[37:07] just like the world thinking right now
[37:09] that the god of Israel is dead they
[37:12] think that God has forsaken Israel and
[37:14] they're thinking that God is their imag
[37:18] this God they have is their imagination
[37:21] and they don't realize they're repeating
[37:23] exactly what Babylon said about them
[37:25] about Israel God is forsaken you he you
[37:28] know he's he's no longer with you and
[37:30] stuff like that you see but what they
[37:32] failed to see was God said I will never
[37:35] leave you I will never forget you I have
[37:39] Graven you on on the palms of my hand
[37:42] and not only that God said all Israel
[37:45] will be saved and every true seed of
[37:48] Israel will be saved every true seed of
[37:51] the Bride will be saved amen that's
[37:54] that's
[37:55] it and I will bring bring Israel again
[37:59] to his habitation and he shall feed on
[38:01] the carel and Basham and his soul shall
[38:05] be satisfied upon Mount Ephraim and
[38:08] Gilead and in those days in that time
[38:11] say the Lord the iniquity of Israel
[38:14] should be sought for and there should be
[38:16] none and the sins of Judah and they
[38:19] shall be found for I have pardon them I
[38:23] reserved you see what I'm saying when is
[38:26] that H when will that
[38:28] happen right you say well brother Brooks
[38:31] this is way back then but I'm going to
[38:32] tell you the end of this thing is after
[38:35] the bride is gone they will receive
[38:38] their Revival amen God will pardon Judah
[38:41] and God will pardon Israel and God will
[38:44] fill them with the Holy Ghost one nation
[38:47] in one day amen and that's powerful
[38:51] right when all the world think that it's
[38:53] finished well because you you you see
[38:55] what they going to do right when they
[38:57] they kill Moses and Elijah they're going
[38:59] to Rejoice they're going to throw a
[39:01] party when they wipe out the Jews
[39:03] because the Jews said there'll never be
[39:04] another holy CA but we know that it will
[39:07] be cuz the Bible says so they're going
[39:10] to kill
[39:11] 144,000 and God is going to raise them
[39:13] up amen you see what I'm saying it's
[39:16] evident that they got to do another
[39:18] suffering people and you say well what
[39:21] do you mean it's all because of
[39:24] you God blinded them that he may graft
[39:28] Us in and that's why God said always
[39:31] pray for
[39:32] Israel and you think that God is going
[39:34] to let them suffer like that for people
[39:38] who don't even care about their
[39:41] salvation no this was bought with a
[39:44] great price a great price it was bought
[39:48] with the blood of Jesus Christ and it
[39:50] was also bought with the blood of
[39:54] Jews
[39:55] yeah go up against the land of of meidam
[40:00] even against and even against it and
[40:03] against the inhabitants of p PE peod
[40:07] waste and utterly destroy after them
[40:10] said the Lord and do accordingly to all
[40:12] that I have commanded thee a sound of
[40:15] battling battle is in the land and the
[40:18] great destruction how is the Hammer of
[40:20] the whole earth cut aunder and broken
[40:23] how is Babylon become a desolate among
[40:26] the nation
[40:27] I have laid a snare for thee and thou
[40:30] art also taken oh Babylon and thou was
[40:34] not aware thou art found and also
[40:37] carried because thou has driven against
[40:39] the Lord striven against the Lord now I
[40:42] go home and say just like the word of
[40:44] God says here the devil is trying to
[40:46] kill every man and the secret was in the
[40:51] woman he hid the secret in the woman so
[40:54] that was so powerful to me and so is it
[40:56] today
[40:58] he he's trying to destroy these great
[41:00] churches and things of that nature but
[41:02] the secret is in the bride that's why
[41:05] the Rapture is a revelation to who the
[41:07] Bride of Jesus Christ nobody else know
[41:11] knows the way of escape the Lord have
[41:14] opened the Armory and have brought forth
[41:17] the weapons of his ignation for this is
[41:20] the work work of the Lord God of host is
[41:23] in the land of Chans now how many of
[41:27] y'all know who childan
[41:29] is
[41:33] H yeah it's it's it's the land of
[41:35] Babylon but you got to also know that
[41:38] Chans and China is
[41:40] mixed because that's where China
[41:43] was so you got to understand that
[41:46] Babylon and China and Rome I mean and
[41:50] and and and and uh uh what you call it
[41:57] when it says that Abraham came out of
[42:00] the land of
[42:02] Chala that land was actually Asian
[42:08] amen so even even even your your your
[42:12] your Abraham don't look like you think
[42:14] he
[42:19] look so the Lord has opened his Armory
[42:22] and have brought forth so that you
[42:24] understand what what what what we're
[42:26] trying to say
[42:30] everybody has turned against
[42:35] America
[42:38] everybody because of what we've done we
[42:41] have no friends we tried to buy friends
[42:44] and you say what do you why are you
[42:46] saying all of these things because the
[42:48] guns are pointed at
[42:52] us and you're going to realize one of
[42:54] these old days everything God did to the
[42:57] old Babylon he's going to do it to us
[43:00] because brother bam said I look to turn
[43:03] and all I saw was smoking
[43:08] Ash the Judgment of the Lord Malachi 4 5
[43:13] and
[43:14] six when that judgment come it's going
[43:17] to be
[43:19] fire we're under the inspiration of
[43:22] judgment they call it they call it
[43:25] global warming and all that stuff
[43:28] inspiration of
[43:29] judgment polluted air polluted water
[43:33] polluted food polluted
[43:36] everything the Judgment of the
[43:41] Lord sound a battle we're in a battle
[43:44] sound a battle I have laid a snare the
[43:47] 24th verse I have laid a snare for thee
[43:50] and thou art also taken oh Babylon and
[43:53] thou has thou was not aware th thou art
[43:57] found and also caught because thou HTH
[44:00] striven against the Lord the Lord ha
[44:04] opened his Armory and and you know
[44:07] brother brandham said it you can look it
[44:09] up China was the first
[44:15] civilization so you understand all of
[44:18] these nations they may have come under
[44:20] another
[44:21] name but they that what what is has
[44:24] already
[44:25] been and you and I I got to understand
[44:28] by the grace of
[44:30] God that God doesn't God waits till it
[44:33] gets so full you said well why would you
[44:36] say
[44:37] that he waited in the days of Sodom and
[44:40] Gomorrah can I find righteous anywhere
[44:44] none in the days of Noah
[44:48] eight everything had come to a full
[44:51] everybody was doing what they thought
[44:53] was right in their eyes and you got to
[44:55] understand Israel was the only one that
[44:57] had the laws of God and the laws of God
[45:01] was the not to restrict us or to curse
[45:04] us the laws of God was set there to give
[45:07] us a long life on
[45:08] Earth as long as you did God's laws you
[45:13] lived when when is when Israel met these
[45:16] countries they didn't have no law they
[45:17] didn't they didn't know who Jehovah was
[45:20] they had Devils they were worshiping and
[45:22] all of those Devils was what Devils of
[45:25] the flesh
[45:28] I mean they they they they sacrific
[45:30] babies what do you think they're doing
[45:32] now I mean it's the same Spirit but just
[45:35] in a worse
[45:37] way so much so it's the whole world and
[45:39] God got to destroy the whole world
[45:41] because we all
[45:45] corrupt so you understand that's why all
[45:50] Gentile Nations hate
[45:52] Israel because even in the Old Testament
[45:56] all Gentile Nations hated Israel and
[45:59] Moab was one that hated her the most who
[46:03] was a
[46:04] relative and so you can understand
[46:07] that's why the World Council of churches
[46:10] hate the bride amen because the World
[46:13] Council of churches represents
[46:15] Moab pod
[46:17] word and Par
[46:20] system
[46:21] hybrid but they hate the true seed of
[46:24] God which is you and and
[46:28] Israel you love the
[46:30] Lord hallelujah any
[46:35] questions
[46:39] yes he was from that land for my
[46:42] according to my understanding
[46:45] sir yes
[46:47] sir called together the arteries against
[46:50] Babylon all ye that bend the bow against
[46:54] it uh uh uh uh uh the bo Camp against it
[46:58] round about it none thereof
[47:02] Escape recompense her according to the
[47:05] work according to all that she haveth
[47:07] done do unto her for she have been proud
[47:11] against the Lord against the Holy One of
[47:13] Israel and and you see her in the in the
[47:16] old test I mean the New Testament she
[47:18] rides upon a beast with 10 horns and
[47:22] those 10 horns we see those 10 Nations
[47:24] which we call the United Nations those
[47:27] same 10 horns is living today that will
[47:30] go against her and their their whole
[47:33] duty is to wipe her off the face of the
[47:37] of the earth and even though they think
[47:39] that's what they're going to do God
[47:42] preserves them just like he preserves
[47:44] the
[47:47] bride Now who is the king of
[47:50] Babylon Satan himself so you understand
[47:53] I'm talking about L Lucifer the Beast
[47:57] the man who puts out the mark of the
[47:58] beast the system that that literally
[48:01] swallows the world up and all of them
[48:04] whose names are not written in the
[48:05] Lamb's Book of Life 30th verse therefore
[48:08] shall her young men fall in the streets
[48:11] and all her Men of War shall be cut off
[48:14] in the day as say the Lord behold I am
[48:17] against against thee Oh thou that most
[48:20] proud say the Lord God of host for the
[48:23] day is come the time that I will visit
[48:25] thee and the most proud shall stum
[48:28] stumble and fall and None Shall raise
[48:32] him up and I will Kindle a fire in the
[48:34] cities and it shall be devoured all
[48:36] around about him can I can I throw I
[48:40] keep talking maybe too much but let me
[48:42] show you what God is doing just what he
[48:44] did he
[48:46] literally opened the gates for
[48:50] Babylon for
[48:52] Cyrus and and and to to come in and and
[48:55] and invade
[48:58] and and you say what do you mean it it
[49:00] you you what do you think the border is
[49:03] is a door open amen so that America can
[49:07] be invaded amen it's God's
[49:11] judgment because we turn our backs on
[49:13] God God has turned his back on us as a
[49:16] nation that's exactly what is happening
[49:19] and the next thing is
[49:22] destruction if there be a another great
[49:25] America I don't know I don't think this
[49:27] the season that it doesn't seem like
[49:29] that's what the music sheet is saying
[49:32] but I will say by the grace of God God
[49:35] has never left himself without a witness
[49:37] Hallelujah and God just like he made a
[49:40] way of Escape for those of old he makes
[49:42] a way of Escape for
[49:43] us we ought to be so happy and thrilled
[49:47] to know that the day we got instructions
[49:50] we see what God did yesterday is a
[49:52] warning that we may keep ourselves
[49:55] upright before God un L the same thing
[49:57] happened to these people will happen to
[50:00] us God has no respect of person that's
[50:04] how he
[50:06] is all right 32nd verse and most and the
[50:11] most proud shall be stumbled and fall
[50:13] and none shall rise up him raise him up
[50:15] and I will K the fire in the cities and
[50:18] it shall devour all round about him thus
[50:20] said the Lord uh of host the children of
[50:24] Israel the children of Judah were op
[50:26] pressed together and all that took them
[50:28] captive held them fast they refused to
[50:31] let them go their redeemer is strong the
[50:33] Lord of hosts is his hand uh right he
[50:37] shall thoroughly plead their case that
[50:40] he may give them rest to the land and
[50:43] disqui the inhabitants of Babylon so you
[50:45] got to understand even to this day look
[50:47] what they're doing they got they got
[50:50] Israel in touch such a tight hole she
[50:52] can't even defend her
[50:53] country who who you think is ruling that
[50:57] that's
[50:58] Babylon you know and and then you think
[51:00] the man behind the curtain don't know
[51:03] what's going on and then he's talking
[51:05] about going to the UN and and and and
[51:07] and and and and and telling them to
[51:09] bring peace as our brother was telling
[51:11] me
[51:12] today that's
[51:15] scripture and how will they bring about
[51:17] peace they have to make a
[51:20] covenant and if they make a covenant
[51:23] where those people are who's going to
[51:24] make the Covenant with them they're here
[51:27] amen just as sure as the bride is here
[51:29] they're
[51:31] here and we're going to see these people
[51:34] negotiating the world will know nothing
[51:37] about it but we will amen this is why it
[51:40] is really time we have to fight y'all
[51:42] know we're
[51:43] struggling and and the point is we got
[51:45] to know what season it is and say Lord
[51:48] you know I need
[51:50] more I need more desperation I need more
[51:53] sincerity I need you right now because I
[51:55] can see the
[51:57] Horsemen's I can see what's coming my
[52:00] way give me Grace to escape I believe
[52:04] the message that you sent to
[52:06] us right and so that's that's how to
[52:10] that like our brother rich brought out
[52:12] about Luke pray every day always that
[52:15] the Lord would count you worthy to
[52:18] escape the wrath that is to
[52:21] come all right so we got one more Sunday
[52:25] uh Friday in this month
[52:27] amen
[52:29] so I think I think uh no this this this
[52:35] yeah I got one more week yeah so we'll
[52:36] be able to have one more one more
[52:38] service on uh on Jeremiah for those I
[52:42] know some of youve been blessed I don't
[52:44] know about all of you but I've been told
[52:47] by some that you just blessed you and I
[52:49] thank God for
[52:51] that
[52:53] right 34th verse then redeemer is strong
[52:58] the Lord of hosts is his name he shall
[53:00] thoroughly plead their cause that he may
[53:03] give rest to the land and disqui
[53:05] inhabitants of Babylon a sword is upon
[53:08] the Chans sayeth the Lord and upon the
[53:11] inhabitants of Babylon and upon her
[53:13] princes and upon her wise men a a sword
[53:18] is upon the liars and they shall do do a
[53:22] word is upon her Mighty Men and they
[53:25] shall be dismayed a word excuse me a
[53:28] sword I'm sorry a sword is upon their
[53:31] horses and upon their chariots and upon
[53:35] all the mingled people of her and they
[53:37] shall become as women sword is upon her
[53:41] treasure and they shall be robbed now I
[53:46] don't know why you can't see it but I'll
[53:49] just say it like this they
[53:52] have
[53:54] feminized our m military so
[53:59] badly the men in Marine used to be a
[54:04] man army navy they were tough people now
[54:09] they
[54:10] have watered things
[54:12] down everybody's
[54:15] soft uh it's true and you know they're
[54:18] soft because they let women
[54:21] fight and it it just it's a
[54:24] curse and it's God said would happen
[54:28] they would become his men and women uh
[54:32] just soft like that and let me ask you a
[54:36] question
[54:38] physically how could we stand against
[54:41] people like
[54:43] China how how could we stand physically
[54:45] if we just went say drop the guns and
[54:48] let's just fight with our fist you know
[54:52] you you
[54:54] know almost Every Nation would whoop us
[54:58] we're not equipped anymore we don't do
[55:02] it you
[55:05] know you know I'm I'm I might get in
[55:07] trouble for saying these things but I'm
[55:10] going to say it anyway there was a time
[55:13] a army Personnel could not be
[55:17] fat and if you was overweight they would
[55:20] suspend you until you lost that weight
[55:22] before you could come back in
[55:24] policemen's come on
[55:27] how how they going to chase
[55:30] you I'm just
[55:32] saying we done let it down we we we you
[55:35] know it's sad it's really sad but they
[55:39] couldn't help the inspiration the
[55:42] inspiration of today is
[55:45] destruction everything that that that
[55:48] once was solid must be
[55:50] destroyed and from the food to the air
[55:53] to the ocean to the air everything is
[55:55] being destroyed slowly but
[55:59] surely like I was telling somebody today
[56:02] and I'm going to close in just a bit I
[56:04] know I'm a little bit beh overtime but
[56:06] let me say it like
[56:10] this if I has had weather like this
[56:14] before it must have been before I got
[56:18] here I have never seen so many tornado
[56:22] sir heard so many tornadoes sirines in
[56:25] such a short period of
[56:28] time and even where I live it was so
[56:32] close go go go to anky you see all
[56:34] branches and everything Brown down and
[56:37] broken I mean it it it amazes me because
[56:40] I've seen the
[56:42] change and all of this stuff is because
[56:45] of
[56:47] judgment you know we never thought H
[56:50] famine was God's judgment but it is all
[56:54] of these things when Nature changes God
[56:56] uses that to try to bring people back to
[56:59] repentance okay cuz I know you're tired
[57:01] let me hurry up all right what verse was
[57:04] I on
[57:05] brother 38 okay a drought is upon her
[57:10] Waters and they shall be dried up for it
[57:13] is the land of the graven images and
[57:15] they are mad upon their Idols therefore
[57:19] the world the the the wild beast of the
[57:21] desert with the wild beast of the
[57:23] islands shall dwell there and the ows
[57:26] shall dwell therein and it shall be no
[57:29] more inhabited forever neither shall be
[57:32] it be dwelt in uh from generation to
[57:35] generation as God overthrew Sodom and
[57:38] gomorah and the neighbor City thereof
[57:40] said the Lord so shall no man abide
[57:43] there neither shall any son of man dwell
[57:46] therein Behold a people shall come from
[57:49] the north always from the
[57:51] north and a great nation and many kings
[57:54] shall be raised up from the coast of the
[57:57] earth they shall hold a bow and Lance
[58:00] and they are cruel and what did Brother
[58:03] randam say about uh Russia he said they
[58:06] are cruel he used that same
[58:10] word they are because they have no God
[58:14] you don't have a God you're
[58:16] cruel man's Nation n nature is evil and
[58:20] with not show Mercy neither voice shall
[58:23] roar their voice shall Roar like the sea
[58:27] and they shall rise upon horses e even I
[58:30] mean everyone put in Array like a man to
[58:33] the battle against the old Daughters of
[58:35] Babylon the king of kings of Babylon
[58:38] have heard the report of them and and
[58:41] His Hands waxed
[58:43] fil again uh uh excuse me and anguish
[58:48] took hold of him and pains as a woman in
[58:52] travail behold he shall come up like a
[58:55] lion from the s dwelling of Jordan unto
[58:57] the habitation of the strong but I will
[59:00] make them suddenly run away from her and
[59:03] who is a chosen man that I have made May
[59:07] appoint over her for who is like me and
[59:10] who shall will appoint me the time and
[59:13] who is the Shepherd that will stand
[59:17] before me therefore hear ye the counsel
[59:19] of the Lord that he have taken against
[59:23] Babylon in his purposes that he have
[59:25] purposed against the land of the Chans
[59:28] surely the least of the flock shall draw
[59:32] them out surely he shall make their H
[59:35] habitation desolation with them and as
[59:38] the noise of uh and as the noise of
[59:41] taking of Babylon the Earth is
[59:44] moved at excuse me at the noise of
[59:47] taking of
[59:49] Babylon the Earth is moved and the cry
[59:52] is heard among the Nations
[59:57] sound like a fierce
[59:59] thing sound like a thing that's going to
[1:00:01] really rock reel and rock the
[1:00:04] Earth and you know and I know it that's
[1:00:07] exactly what it's going to
[1:00:08] do and and you look at these things you
[1:00:11] say well brother Brooks that that was
[1:00:13] for Jews but if you can't
[1:00:15] see and you can't hear God speaking to
[1:00:19] you through these scriptures then
[1:00:21] something's
[1:00:23] wrong something's wrong this is a
[1:00:26] serious time it it is a time of
[1:00:28] Consecration and and myself I today I
[1:00:31] was too busy too busy I don't like being
[1:00:35] busy like that uh um but I tell you what
[1:00:40] saints of God it is always a trick of
[1:00:42] the
[1:00:43] devil it's always a trick of the devil
[1:00:46] to make us so
[1:00:48] busy till we don't give God his
[1:00:52] time this is not a time to be that way
[1:00:56] this is a time of trying to meditate and
[1:00:59] and and and on the word and try to keep
[1:01:02] ourselves abiding in the word and you
[1:01:05] know and I know and I'm not saying oh
[1:01:08] I'm 100% where I should be but I will
[1:01:11] say this by God's grace I press every
[1:01:16] day I battle every day but I press every
[1:01:20] day and I'm going tell
