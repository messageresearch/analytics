TRANSCRIPT
========================================
God bless you this evening it's good to be here I didn't come to speak he's right I told him I was just going to come over and visit tonight it's always good to come and see God's children brother BR told my father once he said John what do you say to people you're going to spend eternity with and that's the way I feel when I get around God's people someday we'll pass from this mortality that we know into a realm of Eternity and we're going to have Fellowship there amen there's going to be some singing brother I I always say I I never could sing I I never was any good at it and I always said I can't wait to get to heaven God don't need no preachers over there I never wanted to preach either but I'm going to enjoy singing and giving praise to God some glorious day just around the corner time is going to drop off for us just passing through and I I counted an honor to be here I met brother Isaiah like I say in South Africa some years ago and uh I I thought he was in another part of the town and I knew he had moved and I got over here I come you know you never know why you do things and I left home about the 2nd of June to take a little trip and I drove down and come flew down and got me a car and drove went up through Pennsylvania and up through West Virginia and and I come back in here and I was shoting some horses for Tim my cousin races over at the track and he's got some horses and I was putting on some shoes shoes for him it was what we did for a living for many many many many years and have track license so I was shoing some horses and I called a brother I said where is brother Isaiah Brooke I know he's somewhere around here I'm going to church Sunday morning somewhere well Saturday I tried all day Saturday to find y'all to come to church and he couldn't get the message and I didn't get no directions and we called different ones and but it just wasn't meant to be maybe and he did call me back on Sunday he apologized and I said that's all right I you know I wake up on Sunday morning and wherever I am I want to go to church there's something in a believer that causes him to want to worship God and on the Resurrection Sunday morning if I'm up hunting in the mountains I try to go quit and go find me someplace to get alone and I won't take much of your time tonight I'm not much of a Preacher I'm not much of anything but God's been good to me amen and anything that I am it's because of him I want to read a Short scripture and let you sit down and we'll take just a moment of your time I I thought today I I I wasn't planning on preaching until 5:00 4:30 I never write any notes anyway I can't read them if I wrote them not very educated so you got to forgive me there but uh I uh I thought I L went home Tim and him had went over to the lake today with a bunch of guys and they tried to get me to go and I told him no I'm going to go I was leaving this afternoon so I said I'm going to go shoot a few horses didn't leave and I went and laid down and I went and rented me a room after he left and thought no I'm going to go to church over there tonight and I'm going to go visit brother Isaiah and I just laid down and was resting and a I wasn't planning on preaching but this little thought come on my heart and I went back over and shot some horses and I thought it was for that and I won't take much of your time tonight but I'd like to read in Psalms 139 if you have your Bibles would like to turn uh the 30 one Psalms 139 the first verse Oh Lord oh thou H has searched me and know me thou knowest my Downs settings and my uprisings thou understandeth my thoughts a far off thou compassest my path and and my lying down art acquainted with all my ways for there is no words in my tongue but lo oh Lord thou knowest it all together gracious Heavenly Father may you add the blessings to the reading of your word you may be seated I thought today I like I said I won't take a whole lot of your time but I I thought as I went over to shoe these horses and I I began to Sho and you know Sho and race horses I I you have to forgive me a little bit I'm County Country so I just uh when God begins to deal with me he always deals with something usually and reveals something to me we had lunch the other day me and brother Isaiah and we got to visit him and it excited me we got to talking about the revelation of God and if God if man gives you something he'll take it away from you but if God ever gives you something no man can take it away from you and I love God because he did it that way you know if he would come along and he would have left it up to you or me we might have got mad at somebody or we might have got upset I I met a man in South Africa once a I went to this hospital and it was an AIDS hospital and all these babies was dying with AIDS and they asked me to go over there and I went over there and this doctor he had come into the message and then he'd backslid and married a Muslim girl and he was there he was a doctor that was working there and when I met him he said now brother Al said I know my dad asked you to come over here but I don't want nothing to do with the message anymore I said well brother I didn't come over here to give you anything if I give it to you you'd lose it anyway amen so I said I didn't come over here to give you they asked me to come pray for some babies and that's what we come to do and you know just uh maybe a few testimonies tonight and I can encourage your hearts tonight to know that great Jehovah God is someone he's not a four off or he's not of yesterday or just tomorrow but every moment of your life he has control of it he knows what you're going to do I I like you because he doesn't just know that he knows your thoughts a far off I mean can you even you can't even really wrap a thought around it to imagine that God it is evident that he could know your thoughts what they're going to be next week Hallelujah no man has that power but great Jehovah God has that power and do you not think that he doesn't know your path the testimony of the brother I thought how fitting it was you see he might have just thought that it was that way and this happened and that happened but nothing happens to a Believer without a reason now you and I we get into this and we fall over here said I get a 100 leadings he said one of them will be of God yeah and so he had to find where that path is and sometimes we take a path that's not right God doesn't cause you to sin amen I had a man tell me a while back he said well God calls me to sin I said no beg your pardon God never CED you to sin you and I we make decisions and sometimes those decisions cause things or people you know circumstances does that to us but God knew you was going to make that decision and he made restitution for you oh my it ought to make you some it ought to make something down on inside of you rejoice anyway I I thought today as I I went to this I want to tell you a story about this AIDS hospital I don't have a watch on but I I'm not going to take much time tonight I usually carry one I left my Bible in the motel room I left my watch in the motel room but anyway I showed up in this AIDS Hospital we went in and we begin to sing some songs yes and they had brought a baby in there we my mother had sold a bunch of prayer cloths on handkerchiefs and we would take those and we sewed them on blankets and we took a whole pile of these blankets with a prayer cloth on them and they gathered all the people in this hospital around and we sung some songs and we begin to pray for babies now you have to understand these babies are without hope you and I don't know what it is to be without hope you see I tell testimonies and sometimes people think that you're bragging on some on yourself but I tell you this evening that if there is any good it's only by the grace of God if you and I ever do anything that's worthwh it'll only be the grace of God you and I are those filthy rags in our services as filthy rags but God in his greatness has allowed us to be a part of something so wonderful and I begin to pray for these babies we got to this one deal and they had a glass over it and in there laid a baby about 2 weeks old I want to say and it was unrecognizable its mother had AIDS and she buried in a rock pile because she didn't want it because she knew it was born with AIDS and she'd been raped so she buried this baby it's a true story I seen it with my own eyes she buried this baby in a rock pile and how it survived only God knows but Along Comes somebody and they found it and they dug it out his face was all mashed in and it was unrecognizable had no clothes on had no one to love it had no one to care for it besides the few doctors at this hospital but I thought my heart went out of me you see compassion not of a man oh you and I couldn't have that compassion for someone but when Divine love oh I tell you when human love comes out of a man and divine Love Takes Over It will produce a savior I looked in that cion I thought oh God how could this happen and I took one of them blankets and I I told the Dr Ruben I said wrap that baby in that blanket and I said let's pray that God will be merciful to it three months later I went back to that hospital the baby's up moving around his face features was coming back they said it's got AE it ain't got a chance brother Allan I said the god that pulled it out of the rock pile Oh let me tell you something the god that cleans you up that pulls you out of sin knows who you are and he knows which path you're on and he knows your thoughts a far off oh he don't just know your actions he don't just understand what you're going through he knows the decisions that you made to get to where you're at and what you're going to make to get out of them oh my if you can ever get a revelation and I I know I'm probably speaking to all believers tonight and that's good and I but I would encourage you tonight sometimes we forget who we are sometimes I I've been in this message all my life you might say but how long has the message really been in me yes sir I started preaching some 30 years ago God was good to me I've traveled all over the world I've watched God do every kind of Miracle there is known to mankind Hallelujah but that ain't what holds me tonight oh that's not what makes me love anymore oh the watching heal the blind eyes or an a person that's not what causes me to Rejoice with him today it's because down on the inside I know that he knows my thoughts a far off when I falter he's there that scripture that I read if you keep reading it psmas David said though I make my bed in heaven he'll be there though I make my bed in hell oh he'll be there why he had a revelation of who he served oh there you think David was a perfect man a he wanted to build God a temple he had too much blood on his hands he couldn't even do that oh he he wanted to do all these things but he looked over and seen the neighbor's wife and liked her and had the man killed and took his wife and but there was something down inside of D it was called rightous judgment and when you and I hear the word of God if that same judgment Rises up that means god is on your side hallelujah oh the apple of God's eye that baby begin to get better and better and better Reuben said to me brother all only said the reason I don't want nothing to do with this message no more he said one of the men was over here the church he said told me that he took the blood away from me because I married this girl that was a Hindu I said well I don't know nothing about that number one it wasn't his [Laughter] blood amen I wasn't being mean to the minister amen it wasn't his blood shed on Calvary it wasn't some man's blood that was shed for you and I that some man can take it away from you I said you might face God someday with that cuz that'll be his choosing but not mine but I said what could be better than to say oh Lord I messed up but I love you he said well I can't do any good anymore I said how do you figure you work down here at this AIDS hospital about 40 hours a week for free well he said I just do that I said no you don't because great Jehovah God knew your path amen well long story short I baptized his wife he come back to serving God serving God today I thought what can't God do but that ain't the story of the little baby I kept going back I made about 30 or 40 trips to South Africa every time I had to go see that little age baby I watched the young man begin to grow that wasn't the real part of after he was about 2 years old the doctor come to me one day I said where's the young man he said he's gone I said where's he gone he said a miracle happened a miracle it was a miracle from the day he was born you and I are a miracle from the very get go from the very word go we a miracle I hear people all the time they say well I never see no Miracles no more I said every day I get out of bed it's a miracle every day that I can raise my head and say I love you lord it's a miracle why we live in a this a time where we powers are all over you and the mental pressure so great but if you got a desire to serve God it's a miracle oh but we it's so easy for us to get County loud L we don't see the Miracles are gone oh the Miracles ain't gone the power of God is as real tonight has it's ever been oh he ain't sure his hand ain't weaking that somebody said well the churches ain't full that's that's the word of God they're not going to be amen I'm not looking for great big churches I'm looking for somebody that says I love Jesus somebody's going home it might as well be you and me may not be many Mak Hallelujah my brother R told my dad one time he said Johnny said there ain't going to be many preachers there yes yes sir yeah I said really he said y'all cuz they can't say only what I said wow I told D I don't want to be no preacher that less my odds yeah why do I want to take any chances it's hard enough to get to heaven now amen but you know who he has called and wrote on the palm of his handj oh I tell you something Church you say brother Allan I've woke up some mornings all the Miracles I've seen all the things I've seen I've wake up some mornings and wonder if it's real wonder if there's any use in serving God wonder if is coming back they all of a sudden down on the inside of me oh something turns over and says War them Hallelujah you ever have those days I've had weeks of where you just depression seems to sets in on you and you and I'm not a depressed person I'm pretty I'm pretty they always my wife says she never knows anybody so upbeat when things are going so bad I said well I can't see being bad with them that just brings me down she says but things are ugly around right now why are you so happy I said because just I'm just pass passing through oh if you can ever get a vision of where you're going and you know that you're just passing through no sickness will harm you it don't have no power over you sin don't have no power over you death don't have no power over you oh what a what a thing this morning I laid down on my bed this afternoon and I thought God why did I come to IA I I shoe horses and Tim pays me $130 ahe and I still shoe three an hour even as fat as I am today so I don't do too bad I make a lot of money when I'm up here with him and I I do really well but I thought you know I I have a church in in an in Fairbanks Alaska and I thought I why did I make this trip at I made a trip and sometimes you know you go and you you just don't seem this just seems like it's just maybe it was in vain or just I was lay on my bed today and I thought well I started to go to the lake with him and I changed my mind and I like to go to the lake with the guy just like anybody else but you see if you will ever get to the place to where you listen to that still Small Voice in you I've never had God really to speak to me in an audible voice but I've had him to walk so many dark trails with me I've had him to walk down through so many countrysides and I've had him to keep me from they were going to kill us one time pick us up with a van and shoot us and a man had my name on a sign and I went to go to him cuz he had my name on the sign and something down inside him he said don't go to that man death wait you there they killed seven people in that van that night but it wasn't me because my God loves me but you know what we do if we're not careful we override it so often amen and I thought of Samuel and I thought of first Samuel the third chapter or something like that when Samuel was talking to Eli and he said in those days there was the word of God was precious there was no open vision and I thought if there was ever a day in our homes where the word of God to be precious I think so many times I got calls this week from families and are in trouble a man call me said BR and can my kids come stay with you for a couple of weeks these girls 13 these boys 17 he said they're going with the wrong crowd and I'm losing them another one call in he him and his wife was trying they were fixing a breakup and he's got three or four kids and just turn all and I thought if there was ever a day where the word of God needs to be precious in our homes precious in our life but if we're not careful we don't hold it precious it just becomes another letter form and we read our Bible every day out of formality and we listen to a tape out of formality and we come to church cuz it's a thing to do but when the word of God becomes precious to you when it becomes so precious that there ain't anything like it that there ain't anything and you hold it that way I told the people at home the other day I said I give Bibles away once in a while when I go overseas I'll carry them and I I I give them to just when I don't give anything I don't feel to give cuz you know why most people don't they don't appreciate it so why carry it so I say I never take nothing bring nothing back but I do carry a few things once in a while but I've been way up in the country and give some man a Bible and they didn't know how to read and you see them brother Isaiah they look through it and a brother told me one time he said that man don't know how to read why'd you give him a Bible I said it ain't about reading it I said you watch how precious it is to him he took it like this I seen him now he lived in the jungle his floors were dirt they wasn't made of wood his house didn't have the settings mind us in it his there was the floor was swept so good you thought it was wood but it was really dirt they cooked outside he had about seven kids and he was way up in the Philippines where and we walked like 10 miles to get to his place no cars I seen him through 4 years later that Bible looked like it had been it I thought my I said brother did you Lear read it he said a few Paces he opened it up and he read me of Psalms about three verses he said I read that for almost six months just them three verses I thought when the word of God is precious to you when it becomes so precious to you in your household I told that man on the phone he said what can you do for me brother alen I said make the word of God precious in your house he said how do I do that I still start living the word don't make it a written word make it a living word oh a written word won't do you no good unless you make it a Living Word he said but we're too far gone I said no one's too far gone amen it's full of people that's not too far gone I went over and I started Shing they were supposed to have me one her or th breads you don't tie them up they always have to have somebody holding them and the person that was holding didn't show up today I thought what a coincidence I got a no holder a young black kid and he's from Louisiana and he's holding my horse and I shot the first horse I got to the second horse and Paul my he's a second cousin to me and his dad mom was coming to message years ago and he was raised in the message but he's backslid and went out and living with a girl and she's pregnant fixing to have a kid and the other day in Arkansas I got the witness to him a little bit he's up here working for Tim some reason another he' come over and sit on the gate after he got done working today watching me shoe and I'm shoeing along not thinking about nothing thinking about come go I was gonna go run get a shower come over to church in closing today but I'm Shing along all of a sudden Paul says to me he said man Alan he said it was something he said that grandma got healed wasn't it his our his grandma was my grandma his way it is my dad's mother in 1947 got healed in brother br's meetings they brought her in she was eat up with cancer she was dying they opened her up when they opened her up she just it just spread all through her they sewed her up and said take her home to die my dad's oldest sister my dad was 16 years old his oldest sister she was a Pentecostal preacher and she had heard brother Brandon was coming through the country and she said Mom I'm taking you over there carry Grandma up there at that time brother BR was taking him by the hand he took my grandmother by the hand and he said your name is Maddie Martin and he said I see you're a woman of great faith he said but you've backed up on the Lord but he said I'm going to tell you he said I see a doctor standing over you and he said you've got cancer and he said they give shadow Your Shadow with death and you're dying he said as long as you live for God he said you'll have one more spell and as long as you live for God you'll never die of cancer and that's thus sayith the Lord they hul my grandmother home in a wagon that night they laid on top of her dad said she had a spell like they had never seen dad said she bucked it took four of them to hold her down yeah said she kicked up a great big old round deal about like that right there and my grandmother lived to be 97 years old she never died of cancer either why because the God we serve is alive and well and I thought after all them years here stands Paul my second cousin it was his dad's sister too he said wasn't that something Allan I thought man here's my opening I begin to witness to him he said but that was a long time ago I said Paul let me tell you about the God of our day I said maybe you've Fallen away and you haven't seen God in somebody's life or somewhere maybe I haven't showed him when I've been around like I should have but I said he's alive and well I said let me tell you about a little Hunchback Raman one time and I began to tell him testimony after testimony in Africa that little black kid holding the hor he said wow he said that's Miracles it all excit us I stopped I looked at I'm shoting he's hold my horse he said man he said that woman he said she she come I said she started crawling about 100 yards out there we went into a Township where they told us not to go the cops said if you go down there there them people will kill you there no lights go in there don't go but I felt love of the Lord to go and I said you know what my wife she always gets mad at me she said are you Brave I said not at all it ain't bravery it said if I die I shall rise again either you believe it or you don't either it's a fairy tale or it's real either this gospel that we so believe is so real that I'll give my life for it if it's what meant to be I took three brothers down there with me they packed it he said there's only going to be about 10 people there I said I don't care he said what's a long ways to go for 10 people I said not for me not a long ways to go at all I'd go across the world for one brother Bram said if you were the only one if you were the only one he would have went to the Cross if you was the only man or the only woman were saving the King of Kings would have left Glory if you don't believe it that way see you won't make it amen cuz Satan will come along and tell you you ain't worthy and he's right and he'll tell you you ain't got a chance and he's right he'll tell you there's a lot better Christians than you and he's right but that ain't who he come after if you were the only one oh church I hope tonight that you got a revelation of it I hope tonight that it you can picture it I went there and they it was a little school room about twice size this and they had about 500 people jammed in it they were packed around the walls and they were just jam-packed the guy's eyes that took us over and got real big he said oh man brother Allan he said this is crazy I've never seen this many people gathered here I said that's all right God's going to do something great he'll do something great if there's one person amen oh my see we think God's got to have this or he's got to have that he's got to be a Sunday or it's got to be this or it's got to be that you know what it's got to be you in the right frame of mind amen your attitude towards the word of God right take it in and allow it to grow we got there that night and preached about 15 minutes he said brother you got to preach longer I said when God tells me stop I'm done I said anybody in here needs healing down in the aisle come this little woman she looked about 80 had a looked like a Brer bull hump on her back and she was walking on her hands and feet like that and she I didn't know the story about her but God did I didn't know that everybody in that Township knew she was the mama and she' been that way since she was 5 years old been hit by a car down the aisle come I preached on if you could have faith in the god of today that God sent a prophet in our day and his name was William brandham and that pillow of fire that hung over his head I told him about it and I had told him that we come as ambassadors to tell them of the good news that there was a God that would hear their prayer and their cry and if they could believe all things were possible she come down that a God be my witness kneeled down like that to touch her and she jumped to her feet I don't know how many miracles happened that day we baptized about 47 people out of that little group what a God we serve that little black boy he said up there to by day he said man I would have liked to seen that I said but he's alive and well and he sent me over here today to shoot horses and need to hold them for me to tell you about him amen Paul said man Allan you make it sound so real I said it is he said man tornadoes was about to hit the other night you know they told us the mot tell I was at everybody get out in the hallway cuz the tornado was fixing the hit Paul said man I was a little bit scared thought it was time to pray was you praying I said no I stayed in bed I already did my praying my wife called me about 3: in the morning she said honey we're praying it don't strike you I said she said are you praying I said nope well I want you home I said well then you have to do the praying cuz I'm not praying I'm ready to go home am and it ain't back to Fairbanks even though that's my home we've been married for 23 years and I do love her and I'm looking to go home in a few days but but you see it's got to be real you've got to know that he knows your thoughts a far off that's how you can have faith you can't have any faith in a God that you don't believe in how is it possible to have faith that he LED that brother with a testimony about the job and you didn't not get it in on time you got in just at the right time because you know why God knew he knew this and was going to do that maybe if you had got it on time they would have looked at it and disqualified you because they didn't know where they would be but you see God does and I encourage you tonight he's real and alive I've been privileged in my life to travel around the world and see God do so many miracles I told the guys tonight I said I couldn't get them in a book if I tried you go to thinking about them and they said man it's hot here I said you don't even know what hot is I was in swas land in the tent when it bued the strings off the brother's guitars it was about 123 degrees and the brother said we're going to stay here I said God had a purpose and a plan that night They Carried a woman in they brought her from the hospital of AIDS and they laid her over there in the floor she couldn't even raise her head up she couldn't raise her arms up they said she should have already been dead but she would be dead within any time she couldn't even move power of God struck her that night she jumped off that floor two years later I baptized that woman about 3 Days Later two years later she's still serving God the doctors told her we must have made a mistake I said yeah they made a mistake but not believing in God that's the only mistake they made amen don't let Satan tell you tonight that God doesn't know your thoughts of off we love you you ever get up our way come visit us pray for us we're planning on taking some trips down into Columbia down in back to South Africa this year I stayed home for a couple years and built a church when I first went to Fairbanks it was the longest stretch my wife said I'd been home in 20 years but I was home for a few days and we built a church and it's grow grow from about 20 25 people to about 100 now and it's a nice building and God's been good to us I told the church but don't get to thinking that you're a homesteader cuz you ain't am this is just a place where your families can come get blessed don't get me wrong I believe in going to church Sunday mornings it ought to find you somewhere to know that he's risen I leave you tonight with just some encouragement I appreciate brother Isaiah asking me to come and I hope this been a blessing to you I pray pray that God will be y''s portion and I pray that he'll I'm going to come back through from time to time to Tim I own a horse over there and he's been training it for me and I just I don't know why I do things sometimes I wonder I've never liked the racetrack my dad always said stay away from them I don't believe in gambling I don't believe in any part of it but you know I do things as I feel on my heart to do them now I wouldn't gamble it wouldn't be on my heart to do that so don't get me wrong but but you know God has a way of doing things I thought tonight I spent a little money traveling down here this trip and I didn't really have it to do and I thought I'm not going to go back to Iowa I went to Pennsylvania and I was going to fly home but I just was so pressed I told my wife no buy me a ticket back to Iowa I'm going to go back but I wouldn't have took nothing for the whole trip for the just to 10 minutes with that young black kid my cousin I watched God begin to work on him I'm going to inv have Tim to invite him over he works for Tim to invite him over to church you never know where that last predestinated seed is we may travel the world over he may be just in the mo Iowa that's why when you get the opportunity I'm not never one for pushing religion on people I don't believe in it I believe God's a gentleman I believe if you get up with the attitude in the morning Lord use me if there's an opening today Lord use me brother told me one time and Africa he said let's go down to the beach and preach to them I said not me God didn't call me to go preach to them people on the beach he said well I'm going I said well God called you to do it go do it I said now if you want to go pass out stuff and invite them over to a service I'm all for that preach on the corner somewhere or something but you know I don't believe God pushes hisself on people I believe he you'll find he went where he was invited he didn't go barging into Simon's house and say I'm Jesus and I come down here to see you Simon am Simon invited him now the little woman at the well she didn't invite him but she
