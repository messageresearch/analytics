[7:10] you can also remember whether John who
[7:14] is in Atlanta and but Elis Paul as well
[7:17] on their way back home
[7:24] just uh
[7:26] the word for
[7:28] my son-in-law Jesse
[7:32] was on a hunting outing yesterday and
[7:36] ran into a twig and punctured his eye
[7:41] and uh
[7:43] so they did they ran him to emergency
[7:46] they lived about two hours from here and
[7:50] run him to emergency and
[7:53] pretty much did what I could to comfort
[7:56] my daughter being that far away it's not
[7:59] always that easy but uh
[8:01] she followed the emergency wagon to Iowa
[8:04] City they
[8:05] decided it was best to start working on
[8:08] him there so just pray for Jesse that I
[8:12] know God allowed this to happen for a
[8:14] reason
[8:15] just to give him a greater hunger and
[8:18] thirst for the Lord's righteousness

[23:12] um for coming because
[23:14] Wednesday night is a night that only a
[23:17] few people show up
[23:19] so it's okay you know because I know
[23:21] there are those who do watch Us online
[23:23] maybe not so many
[23:25] but we we understand the influence of
[23:27] the hour
[23:29] yes um
[23:32] Bobby said scarcely will a righteous man
[23:35] be saved
[23:36] and where were the ungodly and The
[23:38] Sinner appear
[23:40] we know we're living in a time where
[23:42] only a few will make a rapture
[23:45] and uh you know I thank God for those
[23:47] who
[23:48] who comes amen by the grace of God to
[23:52] church is very important it really shows
[23:56] what's really in you
[23:57] and I really appreciate you and I'm sure
[24:00] the Lord is the one who
[24:03] moving you to come
[24:05] amen because this is no fancy place
[24:08] you don't have this great preacher you
[24:11] know I mean it's just simple everything
[24:13] is and uh we just thank God for the word
[24:16] that God gives us
[24:18] and we're grateful Genesis the third
[24:22] chapter
[24:26] Genesis the third chapter will read the
[24:28] first through the fifth verse
[24:30] of that that chapter
[24:34] he loved the Lord
[24:37] amen
[24:46] amen you should always bring your Bible
[24:47] to church
[24:49] it's very important
[24:51] so um
[24:54] when we read something you'll you know
[24:56] where it's coming from and you won't
[24:57] forget it
[24:59] Genesis the third chapter beginning at
[25:01] the first verse it says now the serpent
[25:04] was more subtle than any beast of the
[25:07] field
[25:08] which the Lord God had made
[25:11] and he said unto the woman yea
[25:14] hath God said ye shall not eat of every
[25:17] tree of the garden and the woman said
[25:20] unto the serpent
[25:22] we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of
[25:24] the garden
[25:26] but of the fruit of the trees which is
[25:28] in the midst of the garden God hath said
[25:31] ye shall not eat of it neither shall you
[25:34] touch it
[25:35] lest ye die
[25:37] and the servant said unto the woman
[25:41] ye shall not surely die
[25:45] for God doth know that in the day that
[25:48] you eat thereof
[25:50] then your eyes shall be opened and ye
[25:53] shall be as gods knowing good
[25:57] and Evil
[25:59] let us pray
[26:01] father God we thank you for your grace
[26:03] and your mercy
[26:05] we thank you for being so good to us
[26:07] Lord you have been better to us than
[26:10] we've been to ourselves
[26:12] we constantly say that because it's so
[26:15] true
[26:16] when we think about how you bring us
[26:19] throughout the day and how your mercy is
[26:22] forever with us and your grace Lord
[26:25] how your blood covers Us and how you
[26:28] shelter us from all hurt harm and danger
[26:32] Lord there is no way to describe our
[26:35] gratitude
[26:36] forgive the human element of us Lord
[26:39] that we can sometimes fail to praise you
[26:42] and sometimes fail to thank you and
[26:45] sometimes fail to be aware of who you
[26:48] are what you are and and your being
[26:51] Among Us and around us and in US Lord we
[26:54] we ask that you keep us guide us and
[26:57] strengthen us make us more aware of you
[27:00] Lord every day may we see you may we see
[27:04] your glory may we see your life in US
[27:07] Lord in your name Jesus Christ we pray
[27:09] that you bless the word the reading of
[27:11] the word
[27:12] and bless the hearers as well in Jesus
[27:15] Christ's name we pray amen you may be
[27:18] seated
[27:21] you know we've been dealing we took a
[27:23] little kind of like a slash a little
[27:25] break in the word and to to to bring uh
[27:28] the last a week message on the influence
[27:30] of the word knowing the power of the
[27:33] word uh you know Paul talks about it
[27:36] that God is Not only in us he's uh above
[27:39] us with us and you know he goes on to
[27:42] tell us that we are even The Offspring
[27:44] of God
[27:46] um I'm I'm dealing with something uh
[27:49] today because uh tonight I want to make
[27:52] us fully aware of the actions that we we
[27:56] take throughout throughout the day
[28:00] um one of the things that we
[28:03] must learn how to do if we're not doing
[28:06] it and that is pray without ceasing
[28:11] um because when we pray without ceasing
[28:14] that one scripture that comes into play
[28:19] or into mind is to
[28:22] um
[28:23] acknowledge the Lord
[28:25] in all your ways
[28:27] and he shall direct your path
[28:30] I'm dealing with a subject tonight calls
[28:34] and effect
[28:37] cause and effects
[28:39] because there's always a Cause
[28:43] that's why I read Genesis you know we we
[28:46] understand what Adam and Eve did and now
[28:48] we're suffering
[28:50] because of what they did
[28:52] uh God told them not to eat of the tree
[28:56] and they did do it
[28:59] and now we are experiencing what we call
[29:01] death
[29:02] literally we were born into this world
[29:05] by the tree of death
[29:07] and we came out dying not living
[29:11] even though we came out as a baby and we
[29:14] looked all cute and most of us did
[29:16] perhaps I don't know
[29:18] but you know we thought oh what a
[29:20] precious angel
[29:22] but wrapped up into that human flesh
[29:24] wasn't so much of an Angel
[29:26] it was the nature of the Fallen man
[29:30] and that nature lies that nature steals
[29:32] that nature is conniving it's it's just
[29:35] everything that the flesh is
[29:37] that little bundle of joy that you call
[29:40] an angel
[29:42] is that nature is within that child
[29:45] because
[29:48] Adam and Eve fail God
[29:51] they transgressed God
[29:54] now the definition of cause and effect
[29:57] is the relationship between two things
[30:01] when one thing makes something else
[30:03] happens
[30:05] and to give you an example which is
[30:07] something that we clearly can see
[30:10] if we eat too much food and do not
[30:14] exercise
[30:15] we gain weight now that's just one
[30:19] sentence or one thing that I think most
[30:22] of us understand
[30:23] uh but see but the calls
[30:27] uh uh uh uh of this uh for example the
[30:31] calls in itself
[30:33] is is the uh eating too much food
[30:37] and not exercising
[30:39] but the effect of that is the gain the
[30:44] weight gain
[30:45] so it's a real simple thing
[30:48] when something uh in relationship to one
[30:52] another something happens there's always
[30:55] a cause and effect I mean even in
[30:58] science we know that to be true uh we
[31:03] may know it as Newton Law emotion for
[31:06] every action there's an opposite but yet
[31:08] an equal reaction
[31:10] and um in that law of motion it relates
[31:14] to objects uh motions to the forces
[31:16] acting on it for an example if when you
[31:20] clap your hands that's two forces coming
[31:22] together and it produces something it re
[31:25] it has a reaction even though we don't
[31:27] see it we it is a reaction going out as
[31:32] it came in
[31:33] and so we must understand that
[31:37] we are people who how can I say it
[31:41] we're we're composed of vibrations
[31:45] without these vibrations our flesh would
[31:48] just
[31:49] go everywhere but everything we call it
[31:51] gravity whatever you call it but
[31:53] everything is vibrating and this is why
[31:55] our bodies don't fall apart
[31:58] because they're vibrational forces
[32:01] that are keeping everything together
[32:04] and you and I must understand that even
[32:06] when we move like this or move like that
[32:09] that the opposite way there are
[32:11] vibrations there are movements that are
[32:13] taking place in the Unseen that we don't
[32:15] even see
[32:17] and brother Branham explained it to us
[32:19] he said it never dies
[32:23] even your voice which is a vibration
[32:26] it never dies and they said that even
[32:28] scientists can you know pick up the
[32:30] voice of Jesus
[32:32] because your voice Never Dies your
[32:35] action Never Dies and that's why in the
[32:38] Judgment nobody will be able to lie
[32:41] because everything is recorded oh no on
[32:45] the video of God
[32:48] and this I had somebody to say this to
[32:50] me
[32:51] today we are living Epistles written and
[32:54] read of all men
[32:56] and they said on that day what will
[32:58] people read
[33:00] when they read your scripture
[33:02] your book
[33:04] that has been written by you
[33:07] there is an influence
[33:10] and this influences the influences that
[33:12] we are are dealing with is good and evil
[33:16] that's right because that's what the
[33:19] serpent said basically you know the God
[33:22] don't want you to eat of this tree
[33:24] because the day that you do you will
[33:27] become as he is knowing good from evil
[33:31] and that is true now we are in a in in a
[33:34] in a a dimension that that includes Good
[33:39] and Evil
[33:40] but the dimension in which Adam and Eve
[33:43] was in their influence was only good
[33:46] and that good was God
[33:49] right and then Satan brought in and
[33:52] broke something he destroyed something
[33:54] with with his deception and when they
[33:58] when they broke the word of God
[34:01] uh it began to move them away in other
[34:04] words that became a breach
[34:07] we call it a chasm
[34:10] and and so Mankind and God was once one
[34:14] but now they're separated by a Chasm and
[34:19] the only thing that combined that breach
[34:21] is the blood of the Lamb
[34:23] this is why brother Brandon preached
[34:25] before he preached the seals he preached
[34:28] the breach and showed how Jesus Christ
[34:31] the lamb was able to bring fellowship
[34:34] and communion back to man and God but it
[34:40] took something
[34:41] just like this uh uh thing that Adam and
[34:45] Eve did cause death we needed a tree of
[34:49] life
[34:50] to bring life back to the human race and
[34:53] in order for the Tree of Life to do that
[34:55] he had to die and when he died he died
[34:58] in our Stead
[35:00] that's the cause and the effects like
[35:02] brother random said nobody goes to hell
[35:05] because they are a sinner
[35:07] he said they go to hell because they
[35:09] failed to accept the atonement
[35:12] they go to hell because they fail to
[35:14] accept what Jesus Christ has done for
[35:17] them
[35:18] so you and I must understand by God's
[35:21] grace that uh everything we we we we do
[35:25] it I had like a sub-topic and you've
[35:29] heard me sing that song everything's
[35:31] moving by the power of God
[35:35] because sometimes I think people think
[35:37] that God is a god that's way up into
[35:39] heaven and he's paying us no attention
[35:41] but that's not what the Bible said God
[35:43] said the word of God says that the Lord
[35:45] is not only nigh us but he's in us he's
[35:48] even in our mouths
[35:50] and everything we do whether we
[35:52] understand it or not is being influenced
[35:54] like I said by the word of God
[35:57] we ought to be so grateful to the Lord
[36:00] that God put a seed his seed in US
[36:05] had not his seed be planted had been
[36:08] planted in us we would be just like the
[36:11] world
[36:12] but it's because his Gene is in us and
[36:16] it influences us
[36:18] and has always influenced us even before
[36:22] we became what we call a Christian
[36:25] even when we were Sinners God watched
[36:29] over his inheritance
[36:31] Hallelujah and you and I must understand
[36:34] that those things that we went through
[36:36] during that during the uh uh time of
[36:39] ignorance it still was God protecting us
[36:42] as you heard me say and may have heard
[36:45] me say those dark times were when God
[36:49] Was preparing the ground
[36:52] had not you gone through the the
[36:55] horrific times in your life where your
[36:58] heart was broken where people betrayed
[37:01] you and all kinds of things happened to
[37:03] you you would not have been ready for
[37:06] the gospel
[37:07] because you had to come and God had to
[37:10] bring you to a place in your life where
[37:13] you knew you had needed salvation
[37:16] right I think when Mary was out there
[37:19] doing what she was doing uh there was
[37:23] somehow sometime in her life something
[37:26] woke her up
[37:28] and and what what I believe awakened her
[37:31] is when she heard that there was a man
[37:35] by the name of Jesus Christ
[37:37] that could not only save her but change
[37:41] her see we don't come to church just as
[37:44] you say I'm saved there's a lot of
[37:45] people saying but not changed the Bride
[37:48] of Jesus Christ we come to be changed
[37:51] from glory to glory to glory we move
[37:54] forward
[37:56] and the only way we can move forward in
[37:58] him is to allow his influence the word
[38:02] influence you know um
[38:05] the message um
[38:07] uh uh uh meet and do season brother
[38:11] random talks about that I think in 1965
[38:15] uh he talks about
[38:18] how that the message is the secret place
[38:22] of God
[38:24] nobody knows that
[38:26] we read it and we thought where's the
[38:28] secret place of God he says it's in the
[38:31] message this is why the message came to
[38:34] hide the bride in a secret place and he
[38:38] said what do you mean because Elijah was
[38:40] in a secret place of God and during the
[38:43] time of the famine he was being fed
[38:46] by a raven
[38:50] you see what I'm saying when everybody
[38:52] else was starving and he says this is
[38:55] the day there's a famine in the land
[38:58] and God Amen is now he's got his bride
[39:02] in a secret place and she's being fed
[39:05] living bread
[39:08] living bread and she's she's living
[39:11] while everybody else is dying
[39:16] see but you see that that without the
[39:19] the the how can I say it had not God
[39:22] sent us Elijah
[39:25] we would have been
[39:27] like all the rest
[39:30] but Elijah found out something himself
[39:33] in reading the word he found out
[39:36] that everybody that worked how can I say
[39:39] it everybody want idolatus
[39:43] there were seven thousand
[39:45] who had not bowed down
[39:48] to bail
[39:49] they were not idolaters you hear what
[39:52] I'm saying now my my I'm going on with
[39:55] this because I'm bringing you to a place
[39:57] of sowing and reaping whatever you sow
[40:01] you shall reap that is the law of God
[40:05] whether it be good or whether it be evil
[40:08] all right and I'm coming and I've said
[40:10] that about the seed the ground that
[40:12] you're planted and this ground this
[40:14] heart which is your ground right listen
[40:18] if it's good ground it repents
[40:23] it gets rid of the Stony stones
[40:27] it gets rid of the the the the
[40:29] uh the the stickers
[40:33] all of everything that that that
[40:35] literally describe a land of death
[40:38] it gets rid of it
[40:40] and all of that is uh is done on your
[40:44] knees
[40:45] God preparing the ground which is your
[40:48] heart
[40:49] and so when that heart is prepared and
[40:52] brought to a place where God says it's
[40:54] good ground it brings forth a
[40:57] hundredfold because remember there was
[41:00] nothing wrong with the seed
[41:03] it was the heart
[41:05] that the seed was planted into
[41:10] is that right
[41:12] listen the word of God tells us
[41:13] according to secretary Corinthians 9 and
[41:15] 6
[41:17] he would show it sparingly shall read
[41:20] also sparingly and he that saw it
[41:24] bountifully shall read also bountifully
[41:27] let me let me put it this way if you
[41:29] read your Bible a little bit that's all
[41:32] you're going to get is a little bit
[41:37] right because you're you're literally so
[41:39] when you when you're reading your Bible
[41:41] you're sowing seed the word into your
[41:44] heart
[41:45] if you don't so so the word you don't
[41:48] get nothing
[41:49] however little watch people when they
[41:52] don't read their Bible the influence of
[41:54] the word is not there
[41:56] they allow silly things to uh distract
[41:59] them is that right the Bible said those
[42:02] who were who who fell on thorny grounds
[42:05] allowed the the cares of the world to
[42:09] choke it
[42:10] right right so how do you know that the
[42:13] heart is Stony is when they allow the I
[42:16] mean you know thorny is when they
[42:18] allowed the cares of the world to choke
[42:20] them
[42:23] and we've got people all over the
[42:25] message all over the world you know just
[42:27] just oh I Gotta Have This I Gotta Have
[42:30] This I Gotta Have that and you have no
[42:32] idea
[42:34] that your love for God
[42:37] is drifting away
[42:40] it's the truth
[42:41] you find people oh I gotta have this
[42:45] can't come to church I got to work I
[42:47] gotta work I gotta work when one time
[42:49] hopefully I think one time God was The
[42:52] Sinner
[42:54] he was he was your attraction
[42:56] it was it's oh I'm going to church and
[42:59] not going to stop me from going to
[43:00] church I don't know but I was that way
[43:03] I'm still that way even though I'm the
[43:04] preacher I'm still that way but my point
[43:07] is is that because the love of God is
[43:09] waxing coal but it's not God who's doing
[43:12] it
[43:14] it's the influence
[43:17] you got good and you got evil
[43:21] and the influence of evil is working on
[43:23] the people because they're lacking to
[43:26] feed the heart see the Holy Ghost is fed
[43:29] by the word the more word you got and
[43:32] you want the Holy Ghost to really
[43:33] manifest himself read your Bible
[43:36] meditate on your Bible read and listen
[43:38] to the message and the more you do
[43:41] have you ever noticed
[43:43] that when you Slack
[43:46] in these areas is when the Devil comes
[43:48] and trips you
[43:52] how are you going to love God and you
[43:54] don't read his word and his Bible said
[43:55] the word is God
[43:58] the Bible says according to Galatians 6
[44:01] 7-9 be not deceived I'm coming God is
[44:06] Not mocked
[44:07] for whatsoever man soweth that shall he
[44:11] also reap
[44:13] for he that sowed to the what flesh
[44:17] shall of the flesh read corruption now
[44:20] did I put that in there or did that did
[44:21] the word say that
[44:23] but he that saw it to the spirit shall
[44:26] of the spirit read life Everlasting
[44:31] Hallelujah you know it's amazing that
[44:35] people have what they call a buddy plan
[44:39] if my buddy goes to church I go to
[44:40] church if my buddy don't go to church I
[44:43] don't go to church right
[44:44] you know so your buddy plan is going to
[44:46] take you and your body to hell
[44:51] that's the way it works
[44:54] and what people don't understand amen
[44:56] that that is an individual thing but
[45:00] there's so many people who are closer
[45:04] to their friends than they are to God
[45:08] he that sword to the flesh shall of the
[45:10] flesh reap corruption he that sword to
[45:13] the spirit shell of the spirit what reap
[45:15] life Everlasting let us
[45:19] not be weary in well-doing and now I'm
[45:22] gonna tell y'all something oftentimes we
[45:25] don't realize we get there but we get
[45:26] there
[45:27] we get tired
[45:29] spiritually and naturally
[45:31] we get weary in what not evil well doing
[45:36] it's important for us to come to church
[45:38] it's important for us to sing and
[45:40] worship God it's important for us to
[45:42] help people and to do nice and do you
[45:45] know what we do but sometimes we feel
[45:47] overwhelmed am I wrong
[45:51] but the Bible said don't be weary
[45:56] for in due season
[45:58] we shall reap
[46:00] if we think not
[46:02] listen when I get to heaven I want some
[46:06] kind of record
[46:08] that
[46:10] so much so that God could say Well done
[46:16] and you know and I know well done comes
[46:19] because he influenced us
[46:22] that word drove us that word caused us
[46:26] to Triumph
[46:27] y'all hear what I'm saying that's what
[46:29] the Bible said he causes us to Triumph
[46:32] we are the effect of his his Triumph
[46:37] he causes us to Triumph
[46:40] huh think about it and how often time
[46:43] you know we ourselves fall into the
[46:46] inspiration of evil
[46:49] one of the things that uh that always
[46:51] comes to my heart is that the Bible says
[46:54] only the pure and hard shall see God
[46:57] that that's always in my mind always in
[47:00] my heart and you know so when I do wrong
[47:01] I try to make all things right you know
[47:05] um
[47:06] you know I I brought this story up and
[47:09] you know I call it acts of ananias and
[47:12] Sapphira
[47:13] that's what I call the buddy system
[47:16] they were husband and wife but they
[47:18] thought that they would cover themselves
[47:20] their sins together and they thought if
[47:22] they agreed on whatever they were doing
[47:24] that God would uh uh it would be you
[47:27] know Peter them wouldn't see it but they
[47:29] don't understand it wasn't we're not
[47:31] even now dealing with men we're dealing
[47:32] with the Holy Spirit
[47:34] see and you got to guard your heart
[47:36] against evil you know sometimes you know
[47:39] even when I paid my tithing you know the
[47:41] the enemy says you know you want me to
[47:44] calculate it down to the penny I don't
[47:46] do that
[47:47] and whatever that inspiration comes I
[47:49] give more
[47:52] amen that's what I do I fight that devil
[47:56] right because if he's going to have you
[47:58] calculating into the penny after a while
[48:00] he's going to have you subtracting
[48:02] okay
[48:04] right so anyway I fight that spirit
[48:06] because I know listen the Bible said God
[48:10] he he he loves a cheerful giver and
[48:14] we're not supposed to give Grudge
[48:15] grudgefully
[48:17] right but acts 5 1 through let me just
[48:21] read the I'm not going to be long
[48:22] tonight because we we're expecting a
[48:24] storm it may not even show up we've
[48:26] asked God to do that but well you know
[48:28] when he says stop or quit we're going to
[48:30] stop okay but a certain man named
[48:33] ananias and zafara his wife sold a
[48:35] possession
[48:36] and kept back part of of the price
[48:40] his wife also being privy to it and
[48:43] brought a certain part and laid it at
[48:45] the apostles feet
[48:47] let me tell you something
[48:50] you know what it was it's basically
[48:53] almost depressing me and and you know
[48:56] because I think to myself how people
[49:00] think
[49:02] that they're actually getting over on
[49:05] the preacher
[49:07] they're so carnal in their thoughts
[49:11] to they can't even see God
[49:14] and that's the Bible you know
[49:16] without the Holy Ghost you can't see God
[49:20] you need there got to be a quickening of
[49:22] the holy spirit is that right I would
[49:25] look at Jesus the very God standing
[49:27] there and those people who's ordained to
[49:31] see him saw him as the Messiah and those
[49:33] who were well educated had money even
[49:36] the Rich Young Ruler had everything laid
[49:39] out just right and could not see him
[49:44] think about it
[49:46] and they fail to see
[49:48] it was the condition of the they weren't
[49:51] worried about the money
[49:53] it was the condition of their heart
[49:56] that God was more concerned about
[50:00] because even though uh Safara
[50:03] had a moment of repentance she failed to
[50:06] repent
[50:08] instead of saying yes me and my husband
[50:10] we conspired to do this which they
[50:12] didn't have to do it
[50:15] like I try to tell people you don't have
[50:16] to do nothing for God
[50:20] everything must be a free will offering
[50:24] if you
[50:25] really you you you basically count
[50:27] counseling out
[50:29] the very act that you're doing
[50:33] everything must be done in joy you can't
[50:35] like oh my God see no it's a lack of
[50:39] Revelation when people do that trust the
[50:42] Lord with all your heart and lean not to
[50:45] your own understanding acknowledge the
[50:48] Lord in all your ways and he shall
[50:50] direct your path and that's where people
[50:52] fall
[50:53] they don't see
[50:56] it they don't they don't see us God that
[50:59] gives him strength
[51:01] oh they get sick and they want to call
[51:03] on God
[51:05] Lord Jesus help me but why should he
[51:08] help you
[51:09] when you wouldn't do what you're
[51:10] supposed to do
[51:12] you re many people are reaping things
[51:14] that they've sown
[51:16] and they look and said why is God
[51:18] allowing this to happen to me because
[51:21] you broke the order
[51:24] and whenever you break order there are
[51:27] consequences
[51:29] right listen that's what people in this
[51:31] message don't understand oh I'm
[51:33] Justified as though I've never seen in
[51:35] the birthplace don't misplace it
[51:37] don't misplace that
[51:39] because whatsoever man so he shall reap
[51:43] you say well what do you mean God told
[51:45] Brother Benham not I think it was he was
[51:46] supposed to go to to Africa and he went
[51:49] to India or whichever way it went and he
[51:51] disobeyed God he called amoeba and
[51:55] almost died
[51:57] why he broke God order did God blessed
[52:01] it when he went to preach yes and
[52:03] because God bless you even in your wrong
[52:06] doing doesn't mean you've gotten away
[52:07] with your sin
[52:10] a lot of times people think ah my mom
[52:12] said this God will slow walk you
[52:16] while you running as hard as you can it
[52:19] doesn't take God but a few steps to
[52:21] catch up
[52:22] and don't you think your sin won't find
[52:24] you out
[52:25] huh Peter said ananias why have Satan
[52:29] filled thine heart to lie to the Holy
[52:31] Ghost and to keep back part of the price
[52:34] of the land
[52:36] and see that's what they understand you
[52:37] know people sit right here you preach on
[52:40] giving and tithing and you know you talk
[52:43] about things like that and I know I talk
[52:44] about that all the time and the reason
[52:46] being I have a revelation of it and I
[52:49] know that if you don't you're cursed so
[52:51] I think to myself you making my
[52:53] preaching to you in vain
[52:55] you're not going to get anything and
[52:57] you're going to walk out here not
[52:59] hearing a word that's coming from the
[53:01] pulpit because of your disobedience
[53:04] is that right oh come on the Bible said
[53:07] that Elijah amen had the Hazel and Hazel
[53:11] was afraid that the Syrian Army was uh
[53:13] surrounded them right
[53:16] and Elijah says Lord open this man's
[53:18] eyes
[53:19] and then he saw a horses cherish a fire
[53:22] all around him because Elijah said
[53:25] they're more of us
[53:27] than them do you understand we're living
[53:30] in the Days of Elijah and as it was then
[53:33] it is now there are more Angels around
[53:36] us than devils thank you
[53:40] it is what it is
[53:45] Hallelujah it's the truth you want God
[53:49] to do a miracle you want God to do
[53:50] something and yet you can't keep
[53:52] listening
[53:55] one of the things
[53:58] Israel had to do
[54:00] was get all the leveling out of the
[54:02] house
[54:05] that's right you want God to bless you
[54:07] you got to get all the leavening out of
[54:08] your house
[54:10] that's just the way it goes
[54:13] and when when when when when Aiken
[54:15] thought he gonna hide his little stuff
[54:18] he calls his whole family to die
[54:21] even his animals
[54:24] wow he broke the order
[54:26] he broke the word
[54:29] the word and has free range in your life
[54:32] when there's a breach like a germ you
[54:35] cut yourself
[54:36] without any anesthesia or anything Satan
[54:39] that germ has a free range into your
[54:43] body to bring an infection
[54:46] that's just the way it goes
[54:48] that's the way life is
[54:51] and yet we see we don't think it we
[54:53] don't think it and I that's what's been
[54:55] really on my heart and mind for a while
[54:57] and and you know just just
[55:00] knowing that everything I do
[55:04] there's going to be a response to it
[55:08] whether it be good or evil
[55:15] and oftentimes it comes when you least
[55:18] expect it
[55:20] and I'm gonna I'm not going to read
[55:22] everything I'm just going to go here
[55:23] because of the time but you remember
[55:26] David said I'm gonna hide this
[55:29] nobody will never know what I did
[55:32] and he thought he going to hide his
[55:34] action that he had with Bathsheba and he
[55:37] went to hiding it so he thought he hid
[55:39] it so well until he actually had Uriah
[55:42] killed
[55:43] and he thought nobody nobody can see
[55:45] nobody's listen let me tell you
[55:48] something God don't need uh what they
[55:52] call it some listening device in your
[55:54] house like like the god
[55:56] Sarah or whatever y'all call her God
[55:59] don't need that
[56:01] God knows your thoughts are far off
[56:04] he sees every move you make
[56:07] and here we find out what are you saying
[56:09] Brothers I am just trying to say to the
[56:12] people that's here including me let us
[56:17] be conscious
[56:19] of everything we do doesn't mean we're
[56:22] going to make mistakes but as soon as we
[56:24] do let's make it right you call that
[56:27] repentance
[56:29] that's all I'm saying we're going to
[56:31] make mistakes but David thought he
[56:33] covered his
[56:34] and God says Nathan
[56:37] I got something to tell you I got
[56:41] something I need for you to do David
[56:44] just did this and David listen a man at
[56:49] the God's Own Heart did it stop God for
[56:52] loving him no
[56:54] because God loved him he corrected him
[56:58] that's what God will do because he loves
[57:01] us he corrects us
[57:03] God is not in the business of just
[57:06] punishing you no he wants to correct you
[57:09] first
[57:10] and as long as you receive his
[57:12] correction don't you know your
[57:13] punishment is less
[57:16] right
[57:18] I can just say it like this and all my
[57:21] children are grown now you know
[57:23] but when I beat one of them yeah I used
[57:26] to whip them
[57:27] when I was with one of my the most
[57:30] stubborn kids the stubborn kids got more
[57:32] licks
[57:35] yeah more love
[57:37] why because you wanted to break that
[57:39] spirit
[57:40] I had a son he just ball up like this
[57:44] and he was all muscle anyway Bob Bobby
[57:47] he would never move sometimes he'll
[57:50] grunt
[57:52] he's still The Fighter
[57:54] I never could break it
[57:57] just showing you amen if you don't break
[58:00] it then they're gonna grow up with it it
[58:02] becomes a problem after a while
[58:04] but my point is God wants to bring us to
[58:07] a repentance so that he can help us
[58:11] how many of you here in here that you
[58:13] know you don't need no help
[58:15] raise your hand you better not raise
[58:18] money
[58:21] we all need
[58:23] we need this Mercy we need his grace but
[58:26] understand everything we do is removed
[58:30] by the power of God and God wants us to
[58:33] have an ear to hear his voice not the
[58:36] devil's voice
[58:38] and David David got in trouble
[58:41] and because of David David did a lot of
[58:43] things you remember David even count the
[58:46] people the number of the people God told
[58:48] him not to do it he did it and he got in
[58:50] trouble and then God put him in a
[58:52] position said which one you'd rather
[58:54] have to punish me you were me or these
[58:56] people and David says no Lord
[58:59] I'd rather you punish me
[59:02] I don't want to fall into the hands of
[59:04] man
[59:05] y'all hear what I'm saying well we don't
[59:07] have mercy on each other
[59:09] yeah yeah we're we're crucify each other
[59:12] we'll have sin in our lives and yet
[59:14] judge somebody else
[59:16] it's true
[59:18] it's true you say that's not true yes it
[59:21] is they wanted to crucify that woman
[59:23] called an adultery
[59:25] like a lot of people around here would
[59:27] do
[59:30] and Jesus wrote down in the sand oh I
[59:33] just want to know what he wrote
[59:35] but whatever he wrote down in the sand
[59:39] it back those people up
[59:41] and he said let me say it like this he
[59:44] that is without sin
[59:46] let him cast the first stone that's what
[59:49] I can't get my I don't understand it
[59:51] people call fall they come short and we
[59:54] ready to Stone them and we got problems
[59:57] in our own lives
[59:59] but our righteousness you want everybody
[1:00:01] to think you're righteous
[1:00:03] but Jesus is the one that's judging us
[1:00:06] see that's what people don't understand
[1:00:08] God is the one that's judging us
[1:00:11] let me tell y'all something if I had a
[1:00:13] problem and somebody put say oh no no
[1:00:16] you got to get out you can't come to my
[1:00:18] church
[1:00:20] do you think I'll stop serving God
[1:00:23] absolutely not man doesn't control that
[1:00:28] and because you put me out doesn't mean
[1:00:30] I'm put out
[1:00:33] it's all about God and you
[1:00:37] every it's amazing how churches feel
[1:00:40] like they can do that and they and their
[1:00:42] judgments are not even true I don't know
[1:00:45] how come I'm on this this group because
[1:00:46] that's not my note but here I am
[1:00:49] my point is this for every action
[1:00:51] there's an opposite reaction
[1:00:54] right look at the men who who literally
[1:00:57] judge that woman and they end up lost
[1:01:05] because I guarantee you because they
[1:01:08] didn't recognize the word then they
[1:01:09] didn't recognize him later and more than
[1:01:11] likely they were among the crowd they
[1:01:13] cried crucified
[1:01:16] people say oh brother random said let me
[1:01:18] tell you something if brother Brandon
[1:01:20] was here it'd be a different story
[1:01:23] most of these people wouldn't even come
[1:01:25] to this church because he'll call them
[1:01:26] out
[1:01:28] right it's best if they don't want to
[1:01:30] repent
[1:01:33] and that's the thing people are you know
[1:01:35] it's amazing how people say I love the
[1:01:38] Lord and God Is My All In All but no
[1:01:41] yeah
[1:01:42] let's get real with the thing you can't
[1:01:44] say that God is your all in all and you
[1:01:47] willfully out there doing wicked things
[1:01:49] y'all understand what I'm saying I don't
[1:01:51] even know why I'm saying this maybe
[1:01:52] somebody just listening you know listen
[1:01:55] the Bible says because they don't have a
[1:01:59] love for the truth
[1:02:01] God gives them over to a strong delusion
[1:02:04] to believe a lie
[1:02:09] you believe that
[1:02:11] Hallelujah God is grateful give me a few
[1:02:14] more minutes and I'm Gonna Let You Go
[1:02:16] listen
[1:02:20] am I listen what program said he said so
[1:02:23] sin must be dealt
[1:02:24] and God always deals with sin by
[1:02:27] judgment that's why our Lord died the
[1:02:30] death that he did on Calvary is because
[1:02:33] that sin was such a horrible thing that
[1:02:37] Judgment of sin was placed on him that
[1:02:39] those who desire might go free through
[1:02:43] Believing on him and accepting him as
[1:02:45] their sin barrier not how good we could
[1:02:49] be listen to that not how good we could
[1:02:52] be but how we believe and accept him and
[1:02:56] when we accept him he comes into our
[1:02:59] heart and that's where the good part is
[1:03:02] it's not only what we could do it's on
[1:03:06] it's on what he has done and what he has
[1:03:09] done for us that's why people Christians
[1:03:12] need to go back to the principles and
[1:03:15] understand what Grace is and understand
[1:03:17] what forgiveness is and understand that
[1:03:20] we're all peace in the same pot
[1:03:24] we all need the mercy and grace of God
[1:03:27] so we always that's why the Bible said
[1:03:29] do unto others as you would have them do
[1:03:32] unto you
[1:03:33] right remember the man amen who all the
[1:03:36] debt and his death his debtor forget
[1:03:40] gave forgave him then he had somebody
[1:03:42] that owed him and he wouldn't forgive
[1:03:44] and matter of fact he put him in jail
[1:03:46] and then the news got back and what
[1:03:49] happened
[1:03:51] everything he was forgiven of was placed
[1:03:55] back on his account
[1:03:57] y'all hear what I'm saying that's how
[1:03:59] forgiveness works that's the law that's
[1:04:01] the order even God said if you don't
[1:04:04] forgive your brothers or your sisters
[1:04:06] God can't forgive you
[1:04:08] that's just the way the word works so
[1:04:11] all your religious acts and everything
[1:04:13] else that you do is of no value it has
[1:04:16] no weight
[1:04:19] if you can't forgive
[1:04:21] and the truth of the matter is sometimes
[1:04:23] you know it's hard to do so
[1:04:25] but once we remember
[1:04:28] we remember that God has forgiven us
[1:04:31] and why why he forgave us because he
[1:04:34] wanted to
[1:04:36] you don't Merit forgiveness
[1:04:38] it's the grace of God
[1:04:41] and that's what people need to
[1:04:42] understand well they need to make it
[1:04:44] right you know how many things you ain't
[1:04:46] made right yet you know
[1:04:52] um
[1:04:54] it's not on what we do can do it's it's
[1:04:57] on what he has done and what he has done
[1:05:00] for us there is where there is where see
[1:05:02] he was wounded for our transgression and
[1:05:04] Bruce wild iniquity and the chastising
[1:05:07] on our peace was upon him and with his
[1:05:09] stripes we are healed most Christians
[1:05:11] cannot grow because they don't know how
[1:05:14] to forgive
[1:05:16] that's the thorny ground
[1:05:19] you can't bring forth a hundredfold
[1:05:23] y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:05:25] you said why would you say that
[1:05:27] because Jesus is the first last thing he
[1:05:29] said before he died father forgive them
[1:05:32] for they know not what they do
[1:05:34] he had to do that Stephen before he died
[1:05:37] father forgive them hold these things
[1:05:39] not to their charge we all have to do it
[1:05:43] if you want to make heaven
[1:05:46] and it can't be something that you just
[1:05:48] do with your lips it's got to be done
[1:05:50] with your heart now I haven't seen what
[1:05:52] brother random said this but somebody
[1:05:54] told me the other day that brother
[1:05:55] Reynolds said
[1:05:58] if you pray for your enemy
[1:06:00] and you don't love him or her
[1:06:05] it'll never work
[1:06:06] it's of no value
[1:06:09] because you don't love your enemy
[1:06:13] so in order for it to uh you have
[1:06:16] victory in that area you got to go
[1:06:19] before God In Love
[1:06:22] for their souls you may never like what
[1:06:25] they do
[1:06:27] but you got to look at the soul of that
[1:06:29] person
[1:06:30] and ask God to give you love for that
[1:06:33] Soul because listen there is not one
[1:06:35] person I want to see go to hell
[1:06:39] we as Christian believes all the word
[1:06:42] regardless of circumstances
[1:06:45] we as Christians are able to stand
[1:06:48] within the book now I'm just laying
[1:06:50] something down because I'm not finished
[1:06:52] with this subject because I want to
[1:06:54] bring something in on order and how we
[1:06:57] can break order and because we break
[1:06:58] order it brings a breach before God
[1:07:02] hello
[1:07:04] it brings breaches in the family
[1:07:09] brother Randall said it like this he
[1:07:10] says if I'm a Christian I have to be
[1:07:13] identified with every character of the
[1:07:15] Bible
[1:07:16] I had to stand with no one and preach
[1:07:19] with him in the in their days and warn
[1:07:22] the people that's right I had to stand
[1:07:25] on Mount Carmel alone with Elijah I had
[1:07:28] to stand in Calvary and be crucified to
[1:07:31] myself and my own Thoughts with him but
[1:07:34] then again I raised with him on Easter
[1:07:36] triumph over all things all the carnal
[1:07:40] of the carnality of the world raised
[1:07:42] above it in him
[1:07:44] notice it doesn't reflect
[1:07:47] the word then no it doesn't vindicate it
[1:07:50] now but if you believe on the word God
[1:07:53] will vindicate it himself as he did here
[1:07:57] in Jesus
[1:07:58] the word bread are always mean to be fed
[1:08:02] on
[1:08:02] and Men shall not live by bread like
[1:08:05] this bread alone but every word so that
[1:08:08] the word bread keep that in mind is this
[1:08:12] bread that the church through every age
[1:08:15] has fed on has been the hidden matter
[1:08:18] just for the Overcomer only
[1:08:22] and this matter that we're preaching
[1:08:25] this word that the prophet of God
[1:08:27] preached God used especially after the
[1:08:29] seals we must understand
[1:08:32] that's the secret place
[1:08:34] and how you gonna be hidden into that
[1:08:37] place into that place if you don't study
[1:08:39] it you don't read it you don't listen to
[1:08:41] it it's not affecting you your mind is
[1:08:45] not on a Rapture your mind is not on
[1:08:47] change your mind is on the world if
[1:08:50] you're not in the secret place but if
[1:08:52] you're in a secret place you're not
[1:08:54] worried about the the president you're
[1:08:57] not worried about the Democrats you're
[1:08:59] not worried about the Republicans you're
[1:09:00] not worried about this perverted world
[1:09:02] like I was telling somebody today I'm
[1:09:05] not
[1:09:06] I'm not
[1:09:10] where lot was
[1:09:13] it vexed Lots spirit
[1:09:16] why should I worry about that or be part
[1:09:19] of that that's an influence
[1:09:22] a negative influence we don't need
[1:09:24] negative influences right now
[1:09:26] everything must come positive and if
[1:09:29] we're going to be positive we must stay
[1:09:31] in the fellowship of Elohim
[1:09:33] and that's where Abraham was he was
[1:09:36] fellowshipping with the angel
[1:09:40] having communion
[1:09:43] and that's where we need to be the world
[1:09:46] is going to take care of itself
[1:09:48] can I ask you a question
[1:09:51] what about the days of Hitler do you
[1:09:54] really think somebody could have changed
[1:09:56] that
[1:09:57] that was God's plan
[1:09:59] moving by God's plan
[1:10:02] hallelujah amen those Jews had the reap
[1:10:06] what they sowed because on the day they
[1:10:09] crucified Jesus they said let his blood
[1:10:12] be on us and our children
[1:10:14] and God never forgot what they said
[1:10:17] raised up a Hitler and a stalling and
[1:10:20] all that but look at the twofold
[1:10:22] God not only chastened them for doing
[1:10:25] what they did and saying what they said
[1:10:27] but he also provided eagles wings so
[1:10:30] they could go back to their Homeland
[1:10:33] it's not like he stopped loving them he
[1:10:36] always loved them
[1:10:37] but they had to be punished
[1:10:40] for and there's an action there's a
[1:10:42] reaction right they had to be punished
[1:10:46] now if God punished Those whom he loved
[1:10:49] then what about now
[1:10:54] the time we're living in is compared
[1:10:57] like I said to Elijah today and in
[1:10:59] Elijah's day there's a lot of things
[1:11:00] going on but that one thing we knew
[1:11:02] there was a famine in the land
[1:11:05] is that right and no matter how it
[1:11:08] looked there was still this one woman a
[1:11:11] man that needed some food
[1:11:14] and we're the one
[1:11:17] the denominational husband is dead
[1:11:20] and all we've got had was just a little
[1:11:22] meal and all left
[1:11:23] and Elijah said if you fix me first
[1:11:27] see that's what people don't understand
[1:11:28] we worry about our finances don't you
[1:11:31] worry about your finances you give to
[1:11:34] Elijah what he's supposed to get and God
[1:11:36] is going to multiply you
[1:11:39] you know I'm guilt he said the meal in
[1:11:41] the oil that was substance that was life
[1:11:45] and as long as you give to God your life
[1:11:47] he will give you his life that's the way
[1:11:50] it works
[1:11:51] because I think to myself I said is that
[1:11:54] not right I mean in the days of the
[1:11:57] Exodus amen God saw that it was going to
[1:11:59] happen he knew how it was going to
[1:12:01] happen he wasn't shocked that you know
[1:12:03] Pharaoh uh heart was hardened by the
[1:12:06] fact the Bible said that God hardened
[1:12:08] Pharaoh's heart
[1:12:11] God did it
[1:12:14] no matter how hard those the children of
[1:12:17] Israel they they cried out they cried
[1:12:19] out and God made it harder and harder
[1:12:22] and harder and you know what he was
[1:12:24] trying to get them to do basically
[1:12:27] repent and come back to him
[1:12:29] it only lasts for a moment
[1:12:32] the god in the wilderness and they all
[1:12:33] they could think about is how good it
[1:12:35] was in Egypt
[1:12:37] see that's what happens to the people in
[1:12:40] the message you know we come into the
[1:12:42] religious part of it but it doesn't last
[1:12:45] it doesn't last in following Moses it
[1:12:48] doesn't last if you don't see the god
[1:12:49] that Moses following
[1:12:51] Moses is leading us but there's a God
[1:12:55] leading Moses
[1:12:57] and that's who that's that's how come
[1:12:59] Joshua and Caleb they saw the God who
[1:13:01] was leading Moses that's why they had a
[1:13:03] different Spirit that's why they knew
[1:13:04] they couldn't be defeated
[1:13:06] but those who all they saw was Moses
[1:13:11] I'm trying to get to a quote now
[1:13:16] Hallelujah you love the Lord I'm almost
[1:13:19] done Lord forgive me I've gone longer
[1:13:20] than I intended to forgive me uh we're
[1:13:23] not finished but let me see if this the
[1:13:25] one that we want here by the grace of
[1:13:27] God
[1:13:29] oh here it is yeah yeah yeah
[1:13:32] this is coming from the the the church
[1:13:34] Facebook
[1:13:35] but consider this also and this is my
[1:13:38] last quote
[1:13:39] the prophet Messenger will be in his
[1:13:41] nature now I'm talking about Elijah
[1:13:44] and the manner as were Elijah and John
[1:13:47] the people of this prophet's Messengers
[1:13:49] day will be as they were in ahab's day
[1:13:52] and in John's now y'all pay attention to
[1:13:55] what's being said and since it is only
[1:13:58] the children whose Hearts will be turned
[1:14:01] did y'all hear that only the children
[1:14:04] whose Hearts will be turned because
[1:14:07] everybody under Elijah Ministry wasn't
[1:14:10] turned
[1:14:11] only the children
[1:14:13] were turned
[1:14:15] whose heart will be turned it is only
[1:14:18] the children who will listen
[1:14:20] in the days of Aid have only seven
[1:14:23] thousand true see Israelites uh were
[1:14:26] found
[1:14:27] in the days of John there were also a
[1:14:30] few very few
[1:14:31] the masses in both Ages were in the
[1:14:34] fornication of idolatry so he's saying
[1:14:38] idolatry is another form of fornication
[1:14:42] y'all hear me he's saying it not me I
[1:14:45] want to make one more comparison between
[1:14:48] the Legacy and uh prophet's messenger
[1:14:51] and John
[1:14:52] the prophet messenger who perceived
[1:14:55] Jesus first coming the people in John's
[1:14:58] day mistook him for the Messiah
[1:15:01] John 1 19 20 and this is the record of
[1:15:05] John where the Jews sent priests and
[1:15:07] Levites from Jerusalem to ask him who
[1:15:10] ought thou and he confessed and deny and
[1:15:13] denied not but confess I am not the
[1:15:16] Christ now this last day Prophet
[1:15:19] Messenger will have such power before
[1:15:22] the Lord that there will be those who
[1:15:25] will mistake him for the Lord Jesus
[1:15:28] there will be a spirit in the world at
[1:15:31] the end time that will seduce some and
[1:15:34] make them believe this
[1:15:38] Matthew
[1:15:39] 24-26 for there shall arise false Christ
[1:15:43] false prophets and shall show Great
[1:15:46] Signs and Oneness in so much that if it
[1:15:49] were possible they shall deceive the
[1:15:51] very elect behold I have told you before
[1:15:55] wherefore if they shall say unto you
[1:15:57] behold he is in the desert go not forth
[1:16:01] behold he's in the secret chamber
[1:16:03] believe it not but don't you believe it
[1:16:06] he is not Jesus Christ he is not the Son
[1:16:10] of God he is one of the Brethren a
[1:16:13] prophet a messenger a servant of God
[1:16:16] listen what he says he needs no greater
[1:16:19] honor
[1:16:21] bestowed upon him then that which John
[1:16:24] received when he will when he was the
[1:16:27] voice that cried I am not he but he is
[1:16:31] coming after me
[1:16:33] hello somebody
[1:16:37] guilty
[1:16:39] everywhere guilty
[1:16:42] but you think they're going to repent no
[1:16:44] you know why it's a spirit
[1:16:47] it's an influence
[1:16:49] upon the people and they don't even
[1:16:51] understand that they're moving in the
[1:16:54] spirit of fornication in idolatry
[1:17:03] is what it is
[1:17:07] but listen what happened if you're not
[1:17:08] filled with the Holy Spirit you're then
[1:17:10] filled with what spirit
[1:17:13] they fail to love the truth
[1:17:16] those don't believe that the whole word
[1:17:18] is of god scoffs that is coming
[1:17:21] the message is not all what it says is
[1:17:23] supposed to be the Bible said love not
[1:17:26] the world neither the things that are in
[1:17:27] the world if any man love the world the
[1:17:29] love of God is not in him for all that's
[1:17:32] in the world the lust of the flesh the
[1:17:33] lust of the eye the pride of life is not
[1:17:35] of the father but is of the world and
[1:17:37] and the world passes away and the lust
[1:17:40] thereof but he that doeth the will of
[1:17:42] God abide in Forever
[1:17:44] Hallelujah going back to Romans because
[1:17:47] they didn't have the love of God in them
[1:17:49] the love of the truth they're saying he
[1:17:51] said Paul says being filled the 29th
[1:17:53] verse of Romans 1 being filled with all
[1:17:57] unrighteousness fornication wickedness
[1:18:00] covetousness maliciousness full of Envy
[1:18:03] murder debate deceit malignity
[1:18:06] Whisperers backbiters haters of God
[1:18:09] despiteful proud bolster inventions of
[1:18:13] things disobedient to Parents Without
[1:18:15] understanding Covenant Breakers without
[1:18:18] rule natural affection implacable
[1:18:21] unmerciful now you say oh what Pauline
[1:18:25] talking about the world Paul is talking
[1:18:28] about condition of the church
[1:18:33] so-called Church
[1:18:35] people who don't love the truth and we
[1:18:37] have some who come here they don't love
[1:18:40] it if they did then be faithful to it
[1:18:44] they don't even know that the word that
[1:18:47] we preach is the bleeding bloody word of
[1:18:49] Christ they don't understand this is not
[1:18:51] a message from Brother Brooks
[1:18:53] this is a message from God they don't
[1:18:56] understand they look and they see a
[1:18:58] natural man and they're doing the same
[1:19:00] thing they they did in Jesus they they
[1:19:03] looked at the outward couldn't see the
[1:19:05] inward
[1:19:06] even so his disciples says Lord show us
[1:19:09] the Father and Jesus said have I been so
[1:19:11] long with you you don't know who I am
[1:19:13] when you see me you see the father now
[1:19:16] I'm not talking about me I'm just saying
[1:19:18] they don't recognize who he is
[1:19:23] listen
[1:19:25] the Bible says who's knowing the
[1:19:27] Judgment of God that they would commit
[1:19:29] such things are worthy of what death not
[1:19:32] only do they do the same but have
[1:19:34] pleasure in them that do them
[1:19:37] yeah listen people they drink they smoke
[1:19:40] they do all kind of stuff that they do
[1:19:42] around you know what I mean and and
[1:19:44] nobody tell it ain't me but I ain't
[1:19:47] gonna tell on them
[1:19:48] and the Bible said you don't have you're
[1:19:50] supposed to go to them try to correct
[1:19:51] them do what you got to do to make it
[1:19:54] right
[1:19:55] but I might if I do that nobody would
[1:19:57] love me hello they're not supposed to
[1:20:00] love you
[1:20:02] but we're not here to be loved like that
[1:20:05] thank you
[1:20:07] this is a this is a Warfare
[1:20:11] this is a Warfare
[1:20:13] no so if they don't love you
[1:20:19] no I'm not going to hell on a buddy
[1:20:21] system it ain't happening
[1:20:25] I I you know it's just the way it really
[1:20:27] is right so let's let's I'm closing on
[1:20:30] this okay
[1:20:32] Luke 8 14-16 we're trusting the Lord
[1:20:35] will keep us
[1:20:37] and that which fell upon the Thorns are
[1:20:40] they which when they had heard go forth
[1:20:43] and I choked with cares and riches and
[1:20:46] pleasures of this life and bring no
[1:20:48] fruit to perfection
[1:20:53] and I keep wondering to myself with all
[1:20:56] the people that we have here when are
[1:20:59] these people or some of these people
[1:21:00] going to say brother books how can I
[1:21:03] help
[1:21:04] what can I do to help the church
[1:21:07] we need ushers we need deacons we need
[1:21:09] all kinds of administrations but nobody
[1:21:12] wants to live right to do that
[1:21:14] they know we need it but nobody wants to
[1:21:16] qualify for they can't as long as
[1:21:19] they're just out there you know lukewarm
[1:21:21] and loving the world we can't use that
[1:21:24] God can't use that but we need people
[1:21:28] that's going to repentance as God I want
[1:21:29] to do right I want to live right I want
[1:21:31] to do and I want to help the church but
[1:21:33] when while people is out there doing
[1:21:35] they doing no it's just dead weight
[1:21:39] I hope they hear it because that's what
[1:21:41] it is dead weight
[1:21:45] you know it's the truth why do you come
[1:21:49] to church why do people come to church
[1:21:50] if they're not going to help out be a
[1:21:52] part of it
[1:21:54] why do they do it
[1:21:58] so they can say I go to church brother
[1:22:02] Brooks is my pastor whoa
[1:22:06] brother said
[1:22:07] [Laughter]
[1:22:15] but y'all understand me we need life in
[1:22:19] this place
[1:22:20] yes and the people who doing the best
[1:22:23] they can do folks criticize them come on
[1:22:26] that makes no sense to me
[1:22:28] but you know what I have to resolve this
[1:22:31] by saying brother Branham said in every
[1:22:34] Church there are three kinds of
[1:22:36] believers
[1:22:37] and I have to that's the way I solve it
[1:22:40] and that's the way I get peace and I
[1:22:42] said for those who are true seed of God
[1:22:43] they will awaken at some point in time
[1:22:45] now but that on the good ground but they
[1:22:49] but that on the good ground a day which
[1:22:51] in an honest and good heart
[1:22:55] having heard the word keep it and bring
[1:22:59] forth fruit with patience
[1:23:02] right no man when he had lighted a
[1:23:06] candle covered it with the vessel or put
[1:23:08] it under the bed but setting it on a
[1:23:11] Candlestick that they which enter in may
[1:23:14] see the light
[1:23:17] cause and effect
[1:23:19] right
[1:23:20] and in order for us to see have a church
[1:23:23] a really powerful church and I say this
[1:23:26] you pray for me I'll pray for you but
[1:23:28] ever since I've heard
[1:23:30] brother random talk about that super
[1:23:32] anointing and I'm not talking about
[1:23:34] jumping and shouting I'm talking about
[1:23:36] the person of Jesus Christ being in me
[1:23:40] and you and living in me and you I
[1:23:42] believe this message and I believe
[1:23:44] that's our portion
[1:23:45] and I'm gonna tell you I want to
[1:23:47] encourage everybody here tonight
[1:23:48] whatever you do you keep pressing
[1:23:51] forward it doesn't mean you're not going
[1:23:53] to make mistakes but acknowledge your
[1:23:55] mistakes keep moving forward just don't
[1:23:57] let Satan you know have a stronghold
[1:23:59] over your life
[1:24:02] keep pushing keep pressing because if we
[1:24:05] do that God sees that and as long as
[1:24:08] you're pushing forward in your heart in
[1:24:10] your heart you want will of God that is
[1:24:12] the holy so bring that Perfection to you
[1:24:15] if you just have the patience
[1:24:17] to wait till he comes that's the problem
[1:24:20] is we sometimes don't know how to wait
[1:24:22] but God knows
[1:24:25] if you just continue to press on and
[1:24:28] pray and whatever is necessary for you
[1:24:30] to do God's going to meet you
[1:24:34] let's stand
[1:24:50] lord said take no thought for tomorrow
[1:24:54] most people
[1:24:56] most Christians don't know what that
[1:24:57] means
[1:25:00] when you say take no thought for
[1:25:01] tomorrow they say yeah but the Bible
[1:25:03] says consider the ant
[1:25:05] [Music]
[1:25:07] he stores up and he does this and that
[1:25:09] but I believe that sometimes I believe
[1:25:12] that God when he when he speaks of those
[1:25:14] things you know people always worry yeah
[1:25:17] tomorrow is not promised
[1:25:19] when you when the day comes you thank
[1:25:21] God for the day and you keep moving you
[1:25:23] know dig your potatoes however brother
[1:25:25] Brandon says it do it but you put no
[1:25:28] trust in those things
[1:25:29] your trust come from God your trust is
[1:25:32] in the Lord and just think about how far
[1:25:35] God has brought you
[1:25:37] listen people I know what it is to have
[1:25:40] a problem with people and don't know how
[1:25:41] to forgive I was there
[1:25:43] it took me three years Lord I forgive
[1:25:46] Lord I forgive oh I do forgive Lord and
[1:25:49] every time I would hear that person's
[1:25:51] name that funny feeling would come on me
[1:25:54] then I would get mad with people because
[1:25:56] they would fellowship with it
[1:25:58] my friends fellowshipping with him then
[1:26:00] when they knew what he did to me you see
[1:26:03] what I'm saying it's it's a division
[1:26:05] it's a devil
[1:26:06] but my wife and I we just continue to
[1:26:09] pray
[1:26:10] and I can't tell you when God
[1:26:12] delivered me but what he did he did
[1:26:16] and right now God is my witness if that
[1:26:18] brother needed help I would do any and
[1:26:20] everything I could do to help him
[1:26:22] without even thinking about it
[1:26:24] I hate the fact that we can't we
[1:26:26] remember those things but I promise you
[1:26:28] because I remember it does not affect my
[1:26:31] decision to help and to love on him the
[1:26:34] way I would if I could
[1:26:35] and that's the way it's supposed to be
[1:26:37] we can't forget what people do but we
[1:26:41] can love them what about our natural
[1:26:42] relatives think about how many things
[1:26:44] they've done to us church people I'm
[1:26:47] gonna tell you they're the ones that
[1:26:48] brings the real wounds you know because
[1:26:50] we expect so much out of them
[1:26:53] but we forget that we're all in the same
[1:26:55] part
[1:26:56] we all faulty without the blood of Jesus
[1:26:59] the covering of the Lamb you know none
[1:27:01] of us would make it
[1:27:03] it is reality
[1:27:06] and I I I desire your prayers I covet
[1:27:09] your prayers never forget to pray for me
[1:27:12] my my the enemy attacks me on a daily
[1:27:15] basis sometimes all day
[1:27:18] in my mind I really go through some
[1:27:20] great battles but but God helps me
[1:27:23] through each and every one of them
[1:27:25] and so I do I do I know who I am that's
[1:27:29] what makes the difference
[1:27:31] you know I know who God is uh chosen me
[1:27:34] to be and I appreciate everything he's
[1:27:37] done for me and my honest desires to be
[1:27:41] a servant or receive that well done at
[1:27:44] the end of my destiny at the end of this
[1:27:46] thing I want to have a well done you
