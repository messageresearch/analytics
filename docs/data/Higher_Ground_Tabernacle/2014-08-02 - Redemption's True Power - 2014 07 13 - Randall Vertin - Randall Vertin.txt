TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen Revelation chapter 5 we're going to read verses 1-7 just do a little bit of reading here I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open the book and to read the book neither neither to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the SE the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne amen let's turn over to Revelation 10 you know what let's just actually let's just go to 1 Corinthians 15 we just go back to there we'll read Revelation 10 a little bit later by the grace of God 1 Corinthians 15 trust everybody had a good week by the grace of God a lot of people are traveling I know my wife wishes she was one of them right now Sister Lindsay really likes her vacations but you know unfortunately all of life can't be a vacation but the praise the Lord for those little periods that we get of it amen 1 Corinthians 15 and we're going to read verses 15 through 54 said now this I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither doth corruption inherit incorruption behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be be all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we sh we shall be changed for this in for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put put on immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory amen let's just read the rest of this we all know this but oh death where is thy sting oh grave where is thy Victory The Sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which give us giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ amen let's just bad prayer Lord Jesus we just Lord we come to you this morning Father we are in need of you more than we ever have been Lord Lord every day we're in need of you and father we just ask right now that you just be with us in this place this morning I pray Lord God that you just manifest yourself to us this morning through your word Lord speak to our hearts Lord and help us to receive exactly that which we have need of Lord may we be in expectation to hear from you lord lord we don't have Lord we have nothing of ourselves to bring Lord but just as that little that little boy who had the Fish and Loaves Lord we're just bringing what we have and we know Lord that you're more than able to multiply those things oh God to the people so we just pray right now oh God that your people are hungry Lord for your word Lord we pray as that as you did Lord by that seed on that day when you fed those 5,000 Lord when you fed the 7,000 Lord that you would just bless this bread Lord of life and multiply it to your people bless all those that are traveling Lord and those that aren't able to be here we thank you for all those ones Lord God and we just pray that your angels Lord would just encamp about them and keep them s safe on their Journeys and we just thank you for it in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may be seated we just want to speak a message this morning if we can just just want to title it redemptions can you turn that down just a little bit maybe it just where my mouth is all of a sudden I get an echo out of it uh we just want to speak a message this morning redemption's true power and then I know brother Brooks likes to some come sometimes put like a little subtitle and brother brandham did it so if we could put maybe a little subtitle to this as well just uh we want to put a a subtitle to it know know thy enemy amen because you know I really feel that you know as we look through the word if we could really grasp in our hearts what the word is really telling us about who we are that you know there wouldn't be a feeble one in this place that Victory would be something that isn't uh we say a rare thing it would be a Perpetual Victory because the people of God are meant to live Victorious lives the people of God were designed and built we were created and ordained to live a life of perfect Victory you know and so many times you know the reason we want to talk if we could give that subtitle know thy enemy because so many times we're looking everywhere at our enemies whether it be our enemies you know we have enemies maybe at our jobs and our schools or wherever we're going maybe even in our family we it seems like we have enemies but really when it it comes down to it the only true enemy that we have we know it's the devil but we I want to bring this closer to home the only true enemy that we have is ourselves the only true enemy that we have in this life is this flesh that we're wearing right now they and this is bringing it down to the to the to the very basics of things that people have missed all through you know we have in this age especially with the denominational that's around the world and this this supposed this social type of gospel to where the preaching of the word has become more of a self-help guide you know you have these different ministers in their mega churches they're they're more busy writing books than they are trying to really preach the gospel to the people and you find out that their their gospel is more of a a self-help kind of a religion it's just of you know maintain this positive attitude and it'll get you through life and all these things and don't get me wrong we know that the prophet brother brand he preached about keeping that positive attitude in your mind that's a that's a very important thing and there's nothing wrong with those things but if we fail to realize where your real enemy lies you know they the they want to preach a mind over matter type of gospel when when it doesn't matter how much you have this gospel in your mind if this gospel is not settled in your heart and you don't have a true revelation of who you are and who your enemy really is then you're not going to get anywhere with Christ because this enemy that we're talking about isn't some isn't Some Devil that's just floating around in the skies it's not just the people at your job that irritate you or don't like you and it's not just your family that treats you like a crazy person because you believe this message your true enemy is your flesh every day that you wake up your enemy is your flesh the scripture says that every day you wake up the spirit lusteth against the Flesh and the flesh against the spirit so that you cannot do the things that you ought to do see when we go back to the Garden of Eden we find that there was a battle already had taken place in heaven BR I I love the way brother Brooks minist about it just recently and he talked about how the battle in heaven had already been settled see Satan had no more place in heaven now he's allowed to go up there and accuse the Brethren right now and we find in the end of Revelation here that he's going to be kicked out completely but see God allows this period of time for him to accuse because there's got to be a battle God is an overcomer and in order for him to overcome there's got to be something for him to overcome and it's the same thing in our lives but we see in the Garden of Eden that there was a battle that took place and there was and what it was was a battle for the soul of a man Satan wanted what God had remember he said he would exalt his throne above the stars of God and the stars of God are nothing but you and I the children of God that's nothing but us the children of God and Satan's entire objective see Satan wanted to prove to God that he could usurp his God's kingdom That's what Satan wanted to do see we find out that we find out Satan's motives there that Satan said I want to prove to God that I'm more powerful than God that's what his goal has been from the very beginning and that's what his goal is in your life every day through your flesh is to try to prove to you that your flesh is more powerful than God because that's what he did in the beginning because see what but Satan but Satan even though he thought he was so intelligent and smart but the problem was he he didn't know the scriptures quite because the scripture says that God would take the wise in their own craftiness see Satan thought he was so smart when he was able to get Adam and Eve to fall not realizing that that was completely in the plan of God from the beginning see Satan has never been anything but a pawn in the hand of of God and what happened was see see Adam probably I I don't know you know we don't know very the mind of what was going on in the mind of Adam but something tells me that Adam really didn't even know what he was doing when he took Eve back but I I I but there's something in me that tells me that the thought that kept going through his mind was that he didn't have the choice see because we know that Eve sinned but Adam did it willingly see Eve knew the Commandment of God and willingly she was she was trapped into it she she was basically ignorant she was completely confused she was trapped into it but Adam willingly went out and took her back willingly according to what we would see disobeyed the Commandment of God and took back Eve but what we failed see so many times we put the blame on Adam and we don't even realize he had no choice he had to do what he did he had no choice you say oh he had a choice he had no choice Adam was a carbon copy spiritually of God came if we could say it this way he came directly out of the loins of God himself and see there had to be a first Adam and there had to be a last Adam the last Adam was the one that had to bring life and the first Adam was the one that had to bring a breach but you see it had to be I'm using that word had to be because it had to there was no choice for Adam see if you listen to what brother Brooks was preaching just the other day you found out that God he was he was trapped into doing what he did by his own word when when Abraham I know you I know everybody's probably trying to keep up right now but I believe it's going to strike when we really get down to it because we got to see how fixed all this stuff is and when you can get it completely F when you realize when the Lord and see that's where I think we are because even you know we've heard the quote from the church age book you know if you could get a true revelation of who you are what the bride stands for and that she can do the greater work she be an invincible Army the problem is the Revelation has not struck yet because if if you see there is such a freedom in Christ now not the freedom that the world teaches now this isn't a freedom to sin this isn't the I can just go do what I want and everything will be all right but it's a freedom from sin it's a freedom from condemnation and see this is where it gets really deep but it's also so simple because if we could realize see that no matter what you've done though it can condemn you in your heart if you could have a true faith in the blood of Jesus Christ to forgive you from that how much freedom is there in that when you can come to a real point I'm not talking about just letting you Willy nearly go do what you want to do because if you know if Grace does abound let's let it much more abound no Paul said you got to be wary of that because you see the the people see it's see we've almost flip-flopped when it comes to to the mentality of the age see but we're right back to where it was in the beginning even Paul had to preach against it because now it's come to the point where everybody has mistaken the freedom in Christ for the freedom to do whatever they want see and they did it in the day of Paul too that's why he had to preach that you know he said let's not sin that Grace May abound he he and and see that's where we're at now at least with the denominations see the denominations and and this message have split so far apart now in their mentalities that the truth is still somewhere in the middle because the people in the message think they got it all locked up but they're so Bound by legalism again that they can't even take the real see there is a real Grace and there is a false Grace and then there's a disgrace the denominations have taken taken that all the way to disgrace the denominations do whatever they want to they got coffee shops in their churches they don't care if people are running around doing whatever they want they don't even feel convicted about it but you see the message churches have taken it all the way where they don't even have a true revelation of real Grace anymore because no matter when they fall they can't even get back up now everybody in the message walks around so condemned because they know the word is right I don't think anybody here would deny that this word is absolutely the word of God and true and that this message brings us the true revelation of this word the problem is is that the people have gotten so beat down under the fact that they can't live it the way they want to that they can't even accept real Grace anymore but I'm here to tell you that there's a real Grace that can free you from condemnation so much so that that a man like Paul who was a murderer could walk in the midst of the Apostles and tell them what was going on because he knew that the grace of God was sufficient for him it wasn't about the fact that now he could just go do whatever he wanted you can even see throughout the scriptures how Paul always lamented the things that he did before he came to Christ but but he knew enough about the grace of God to see the true power of redemption in his life think about how much condemnation had to try to follow Paul around every day every time he would have gotten up in front of those people trying to preach the word of God to the people of God don't you think the devil was in his ear telling him about how he killed people in the church how he the scripture even says he talks about he said I caused others to blaspheme and you don't think that that followed him around and we have the same thing in our lives don't we you try to get up and do something for God you try to witness for God and the devil's right there in your mind say what about what you just did last week and you think you're able to go witness to this person and and we'll get ourselves down because we don't understand real Grace and the fact that it can absolutely free you from all condemnation see but back to what we were talking about in the garden V because this is where it really comes down to when we go to Abraham we have to understand what happened with Abraham to understand what happened in the garden because what happened in the garden was God actually showing see that what happened in the Garden of Eden goes beyond what just happened in the garden of Eden but what happened in the Garden of Eden literally showed us the entire Plan of Redemption right in a nutshell God opened up his very heart to us in the Garden of Eden and it wasn't until this age that we could really see that but let's talk about Abraham for a second to really show you what we're talking about because Abraham was given a promise that he would have a seed and that seed would would possess the gates of its enemies doesn't that sound familiar because God's seed possesses the gates of their enemies see all these things every single scripture points to Christ amen every scripture is showing if you can let God open your eyes spiritually every scripture is showing you what God has been wanting to do with you from the very beginning it's showing what God was planning even before he spoke the world and existence God was planning this thing he's always been planning this thing but see so let's look at it now Abraham a type of God himself a very type of God himself wanted to bring forth seeds that would possess the gates of their enemies that would shine like the stars of heaven doesn't this house sound familiar see the very life of Abraham was the life of God and he wandered about seemingly alone just like God Alone with his thoughts seemingly alone but he there was something that had to be performed a son had to come forth and that son did come forth though it took its time Joe you may take your time you're going to come forth but now look at it Isaac now comes out right Isaac comes forth and God tells Abraham you have to sacrifice your only son now I want you to think about this think about this think about this this stuff's getting so deep to me I don't even know what to do sometimes I hope you can see it because this is deeper than any of us can imagine but it's so simple when you can see what God has done and his thoughts towards you and how how impossible it is for him to lose you it is impossible for God to lose you because he told himself in the beginning that he was going to have you and he will have you he said I have not lost one he can't lose you and he won't lose you and I want you to see see how fixed it is because now Abraham brings Isaac now Isaac was born in sin see Isaac is a type if we could say of that first Adam because now he was born in sin though he was innocent at the time he was born in sin he was a sinful flesh and God is showing him this is I want you to think about it Abraham now typing out God waiting to bring forth his son he brings forth his son but now his son is brought forth into a sinful nature as Isaac didn't have a choice that's just the way he was brought forth I was born in sin shapen in iniquity came out of the womb speaking lies but now look God tells Abraham go sacrifice your only son doesn't that sound familiar that son's got to die death is required of him just like it was required of Adam it was required as soon as he took back Eve it was required of Adam to die but see we're talking spiritual death not just natural but we're typing this out so I want you to follow me it was required for Adam to die that was his requirement being typed out in Isaac now God looking at the situation and saying I have to sacrifice death has to come to my own son because though though we are often want to put Adam in a place of low esteem because of what happened in the garden he is the original Son of God in that Garden he was that the very one of the first fruits on the earth at least now Jesus Christ we know was before the foundation of the world but that's because he's all the fullness but now look at at this Abraham God in tight having to sacrific his own son on the altar but now look at this but then the angel comes to him and turns his attention right as he's about to kill his own son just as Adam should have been given death spiritually for all etern he should have died separated from God something happened the angel catches him and says don't touch him but look behind you there's a ram caught in a Thicket the horns of this Ram remember the horns type power the very power of this RAM and the ram is Christ amen caught in the thicket God's Own Christ's own power was caught himself in such a place now the ram was innocent the see these animals are innocent see this is where the type goes so much deeper because this animal was completely innocent that's why it can type Christ because it was a completely innocent sacrifice it had no choice it wasn't it wasn't guilty of anything see we take the type so many times surface deep and we say Abraham and then Isaac typing out the promised son of Christ but let's go a little deeper here and we see that Abraham being the father don't we call Abraham the father of the faith and who is the father but God so Abraham God seeing his son Isaac has to Die the death and yet here is this Ram caught by its own power see and we find that the scripture tells us all about it because the scripture says that God swore by himself for he could swear by no greater that he would bring these things to pass that he would bring the Redemption to pass and what was it that is the very that's the ram catching himself by his own horns God taking his word his word is his power amen and he caught himself in his own words he trapped himself don't you see see it God literally God to ensure to absolutely make sure that you would be redeemed he trapped himself by his own word because before the foundation of the world brother Bob he swore by himself that Bob Stamper is a Son of God and because he swore that oath to him self he can't lose you can I say it like this without sounding like I'm being sacreligious or anything he literally no matter what it takes he has to have you whether it looks like he's bending the rules or not because if you look through the Scripture it looks so many times like God is breaking his own rules I've often used the example of uh David David when he sinned with basba should have died he was under the law and yet God comes back to him and David pronounced the Judgment out of his own mouth he said that guy's going to die when Nathan gives him the parable of the man and the lamb and he says who is that man he's going to die Nathan says you are the man but what does he say see David should have died the Lord dictated that he him and basa should have both been puted outto the street and stoned to death caught in the act of adultery murder on top of that and bearing false witness lying to the people and yet it looked like God turned against his own word when he comes right back through the mouth of Nathan and says you're not going to die though how can he do that how because can you turn it down just a little bit it's still giving me the weird I don't know if you can probably hear it to but why could God do that how could he do that it looked like he was breaking his own words but see you got to be Eternal to understand this thing because from the foundation of the world God already dictated he already dictated and swore to himself that the Son of God Christ Jesus would come from the line of David so he couldn't die it couldn't happen do you see it God caught him himself by his own words see and if you could take this in your own life you could see who you are to God see that's why Adam didn't have a choice he had no choice because God had no choice and Adam whether you people want to believe it or not had the very nature of God in him he was born a son of God direct lineage out of the loins of God himself he had the nature that's why he didn't have a choice because he had to live that out and what was he showing he was showing that God does not have a choice with you he doesn't do you have a choice who your brothers and sisters are who were born to your parents you don't when you're growing up you may have wish you did there are a lot of times I wish I didn't have two sisters when I was younger I didn't like being the only the oldest child and a boy because I'm the only one that got to mow the lawn I didn't like that I but you don't have a choice they were bored to your parents and God didn't have a choice do you see that now here's what happened though Satan wanted prove to God that he could usurp his kingdom from him he Satan's whole thing was like you know what I'm GNA show that I'm just as powerful as God and how's he GNA do that I'm G to make his children do what I want them to do but see the problem is is that Satan is and always has been a carnal nature because Satan could only go Skin Deep he could only affect the flesh now we understand that you were born with a sin nature as it was you know brother brandham called it he said there was that little snake in there that little nature that you carried with you from the time you were born but I want you to see that the only reason you have that nature the only reason you have that nature is because you don't know who you are yet that's the only reason reason you have that nature because had you and because you were born the reason you don't know who you are is because you were born into this carnal sinful flesh see we're talking about knowing your enemy and your very enemy is your flesh it's the it's truly the only enemy you really have when the rubber meets the road it doesn't matter what is outside because the the only enemy that you have is your flesh because what happens is is that if you right now were to take your flesh away right now and give you a a redeemed body you would be perfect if you've been sealed with the Holy Ghost and that and that you take away the sinful flesh and give you a redeemed body you would literally be perfect that that would be it because the only thing that keeps you from being perfect is that flesh because it tells you the word's not right it messes with your vision and I'm talking spiritual vision it messes with your spiritual vision it messes with this and that because I want you let's look at things from a spiritual perspective right let's say you work in a place and you got a guy you can't stand now your flesh is telling you that you just don't love the guy at all you don't like the guy but what it's not telling you is what you really don't like is the spirit on the die and if if you were I'm just now we're using hypothetical here but this is nothing but the truth if you were at that job and you're having a trouble loving this person if you could take your sinful flesh out and replace it with that perfect body and all of a sudden you had a revelation that it wasn't the man but it's the spirit on the man you would love that man the way you ought to and all of a sudden you'd realize wait a second it wasn't him I was actually fighting but it was the the thoughts that my flesh was trying to make me believe that's what it is everything that we're fighting see we have it up here all the time we get it preached to all the time you know I may be you know a person I know may I may not I'm just using this an example because we all deal with stuff like this people that we know that rub us the wrong way whatever it might be right so I'm using this an example but the the flesh is telling you oh you just don't like that guy oh maybe they're a serpent SE maybe they're this we don't like them I don't do this or that but what the problem is you don't see that your flesh is the one feeding you all those lies that that's what it is but we'll make ourselves think that that's just us believing it when really see if you really want to know everybody's like well how do I know you know the I had this I had this thought you know how do we know the the nature of the devil right because you know they they say in order to fight your enemy you got it that's why we gave the subtitle you have to know your enemy right they say know your enemy as yourself and say I keep my friends close and my enemies even closer well you keep your enemy as close as it can get every day but if you want to know the nature of Satan all you have to do is listen to what your flesh is telling you because in the Garden of Eden when Satan went to pervert the people of God that's what he did Satan literally infused his nature into your flesh that's what it was because it was a carnal act see because Satan's a carnal being he could not see I don't no matter what Satan tried to this is where I'm trying to get it with this with this thing about knowing who you are because no matter what SAT tried to do it doesn't matter how much he tried how much he worked that he could not change the fact that Adam was a Son of God he couldn't change it see and Satan tries to tell us that all the time that he's got some magical power he doesn't have I don't care what he tells you if you're a Son of God if God has put it in your heart that you're a Son of God there is nothing that Satan can do that can change whether you are a son of God it literally cannot be done you can't do it you can't just as much as brother Isaac can't change the fact that he's a sear that's his family name he can't change the blood that runs in his veins he can't I don't care he can transfuse himself all he wants to he could replace every bit of blood in his body but you give it a while and the DNA that flows in his veins will make sure that that blood will testify that he's a sear Isaac sear that's where he's from just as much as brother Marshall's a Stamper just as much as I'm a ver it can't I don't care what you do you can't change it Satan thought he could the only thing he could do was corrupt the flesh though see and he corrupted the spirit in a sense to the point that he could deceive the people but he could never truly change you see that's W that ought to be a powerful statement he cannot truly change you the thing is do you recognize that is having the faith to believe in who you are and believing that God has the power to seal you away into that Kingdom see even the oh just I wish you could see that he can't change you he can't do it he can he can torment you as much as he want he tries to every day and most of that is because you know the only reason he can really torment you just got to be sealed away into that kingdom is all it is because when you're sealed away he can't even get to you anymore but many times we wander out there by like brother brandom said it's not that he comes into us we go out to him we start just like Eve did we start listen to those Lies We wander outside the blood we greet the holy spirit away from us for a season and we think that we've been changed into a son of the devil now or a daughter the daughter of Satan that's what the devil does but the thing that Satan loves is he just trying to he's just clouding your vision I hope this is all right this morning I'm trying to I want to give you guys hope here I want to give you something that you can latch on to here because he can't change who you are you can't change who you are God can't change who you are because it was ordained his decision from the foundation of the world was perfect and it can't be changed his mind mind was made up about you before you were born and the fact that you want to serve God proves who you are because the ones that don't have that desire those are the ones that can't serve him because they don't have anything in them to serve see Satan here's the thing here's where Satan's always blurring lines with us right he's switching you know that's what politics does a lot a lot of times they try to change the meaning of words I mean I was telling my wife I was on I was on uh I was watching a YouTube thing and they had those commercials they put on YouTube and you know how they completely changed the rainbow now I mean homosexual rights and they had a Burger King advertisement where they're they wrap up their Whopper in this rainbow paper for Gay Pride events and try to tell them that you know we're all the same on the inside you know it doesn't matter if you're gay or whatever you can do whatever you want to but it just see that's how Satan loves to turn things around and try to make the mean something they don't mean and see what Satan tries to do to us is he tries to make you feel like you're no longer a Son of God just because you're messed up or something but what he fails to what you fail to realize is he can't change whether you're a son or daughter of God he can't change it the only thing he can get you to do is is to not accept it is to try to mess with your mind and your thoughts enough to convince you that you're not and all that does is it keeps you away from the blessings that God's got for you because now you don't find your s worthy enough to have him anymore because he's convinced you up here of something that's not true in here he's convinced you that that you don't have a desire to serve God when you do a desire to serve God is one of the greatest things you can have just the fact that you have that proves you're not the Devils it is absolute proof that you're not of the devil like I said do you want to know the nature of Satan look at your flesh your flesh doesn't want to go to church your flesh doesn't want to pray your flesh doesn't want to read your Bible your flesh doesn't want you to witness the people your flesh doesn't want you to think about God but somewhere in your heart you want to think about God you want to go to church you want to save Souls you want to make a Rapture that proves those two Natures are opposite and and Satan is trying to tell you that the nature of your flesh is your nature when in reality it's his nature and I've preached this many times but what a lot of people don't know is what happen to Calvary is that is that God see at one time Satan had a free roam between this flesh and your soul to go back and forth and and really try to corrupt you but at Calvary when Christ died on the cross he severed that connection that connected the nature of your flesh to the nature in your soul and then God came along with the Holy Ghost and even doubly cemented the the power of it by sealing your soul away with the Holy Ghost so now it's an impenetrable Fortress that Satan can't touch and what the devil all he tries to get you to do is he tries to confuse you and he tries to tell you that your flesh nature is your nature but it's not your nature it's his nature your flesh's nature is literally the nature of Satan himself that that's what it is because when he allow when he ejected himself into the human race through the serpent he literally forced his nature into the into the flesh because it was a fleshly act see that's why Satan always thought he was so smart he thought he was so smart because he tricked Eve into doing what she did carnally not realizing that the the carnal flesh is not heir to the kingdom anyhow flesh and blood can inherit that's why we read that Flesh and Blood can't inherit it anyhow see he he knew the word but he never believed the word so he thought he could corrupt the seed of God through the flesh but it's not the flesh that matters anyway it was the soul the whole time and it's something that Satan can't touch it it's see if remember that that seed in you is literally a piece of God it's a piece of the word it doesn't matter how many versions of the word Satan tries to come up with NIV RSV all these different versions they got you know all different things they got it doesn't matter how many versions Satan could come up with he still can't corrupt the true word because the word isn't letters written on pages the word is literally life it and you can't corrupt life you can't do it it can't be done life because God himself is life he is the only true sort life cannot be contained it cannot be stopped and it cannot be held back and that's what Satan tries to tell you though is that somehow he's corrupted your soul through your flesh but you believe this word if you can receive the holy GH that's why the Holy Ghost is so important because what the Holy Ghost does is it allows you to have a real Revelation that he cannot penetrate your soul anymore he can't do it because he Satan cannot corrupt that seed that's inside you anymore than he can corrupt the word of God and he can't do it he may corrupt people's minds about the word of God he may corrupt people's thoughts and give them false Revelations but the true word of God cannot be corrupted and since the seed of God is the word of God and that seed of God resides in you that you cannot be corrupted the problem is we're we're all impatiently now the scripture says that the creation granth for the manifestation of the sons of God the the creation is waiting why because creation knows these animals that don't have souls these birds that don't have souls the very trees themselves and the rocks are crying out because all of them are suffering because of the fall and they're all innocent that's why the creation literally groans because here's the thing that there's the power of redemption I want you to see the power of redemption and that it was a two-step process if I could say it like this see because when when Christ died on Calvary rose again and brought the Holy Ghost back he only completed one part of the Redemption but there was two parts to Redemption and we preached this before here but if you read I'm not going to read it but you go back and read Jeremiah 32 and it tells you about H Hannam's field that Jeremiah had an uncle and God comes to him and says your uncle is going to tell you to buy this piece of land he says go buy it and when you go through and you read and you find out that Jeremiah buys this field from his uncle and and when he buys it you you find a strange thing that there there's an just like you have a title to a piece of property or a car there were that he called it an Evidence is an Evidence of the purchase that's a title he says there were two evidences to this purchase two evidences there was one that was sealed according to the law and what was it it was a sealed evidence nobody could look upon it and then there was an evidence that was open there was an open evidence and a sealed evidence and this is what happened on Calvary see there was a sealed evidence that's been inside you the whole time and you don't even know it if you weren't spiritual you might not even see it if it walked right by you why because it's sealed it's a sealed evidence it's inside you it's an evidence that you can't see with your natural eyes it it's the it's your soul see when Christ on the day of Pentecost and the Holy Ghost was sent that was a sealed evidence a seal if I could say it this way it was a sealing evidence that there's evidence because why remember that he the scripture Paul says that the earnest of the inheritance and in Earnest is a down payment and a down payment what is a down payment a down payment is a proof of purchase it's a proof that this purchase has happened and there's more to come and that's what the Holy Ghost was it was a proof it was a proof it was a evidence back to Jeremiah it was one of the evidences that the purchase has taken place here's the thing but there's another evidence to go and this is the one that the creation is groaning for because this is the one that really concerns them you see if we could say it this way and these poor animals and things that have to suffer and die the birds and the you know the trees you know creation the scripture say it it it's groaning it's basically crying out the the creation wants Redemption but see it has to wait on us see we as Spiritual Beings can live in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus your dog can't do that it doesn't have a soul it just lives on this Earth poor things got to suffer and fleas and you know all these different things it's got to go through we on the other hand are Spiritual Beings who have received the the earnest of our inheritance and therefore we can live in Heavenly places but you see that there's a little bit let's turn over to Romans chapter 8 but there's more to it than this you see oh this is powerful I hope this is all right we're talking about redemption's true power and I want you to see how powerful it was God completely you you couldn't you have to be who you are and God will if you are a son of God or a daughter of God he will accept you he has to he swore by himself that he would the only question is are you going to believe it and are you going to surrender to it that's the only question because the only thing that gets in your way is your faith in what he's already done that's the only thing it gets that's that's what gets in your way because the work's already done the question is are you going to surrender to him or not and here's what everybody's looking for though this is why people get so frustrated because you see Romans chapter 8 verse2 says for the creature was made the creature which is US was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope now if I could paraphrase that scripture for you he says we being people the creature we're the creature preacher he's speaking about here he says we were made subject to vanity which is this life if you read through Ecclesiastes you find that everything's vanity and vexation of spirit and he what is he talking about he's speaking about this carnal life that we have to live this toiling and sewing and reaping and the fact that we find we're feeding this flesh to stay to keep it alive but in essence it's all vanity because all men die and go to the dust anyway right that's that's what he's talking about is the what is the point of this exercise of life well God has a purpose for it that doesn't mean you should go out and just do whatever you want to do God has a purpose for your life here but what he's saying he says because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption what is the bondage of corruption it's this flesh this flesh is literally the only for a a a son or daughter of God sealed with the Holy Ghost the only bondage left to them is death and it's even that as we read in the beginning is going to be swallowed up in Victory because this corruptible must put on incorruption this this death must put on immortality it has to be done why because remember the scripture says The Last Enemy to be defeated is death and that's what we're waiting for that's why we suffer with diseases that's why we got to fight these demons in our flesh because it's the only thing that they can attack to you is that flesh because it's not redeemed yet see remember there's two evidences to this Redemption you hold one right now in your soul if you're baptized sealed by the holy ghost that is your first inheritance that's your first evidence and what is the second evidence we're waiting for right now see we know that verse 22 for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit e even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for what adoption but what is this adoption he's speaking of he says to Wi which means or in other words the Redemption of our bodies if you're sealed with the Holy Ghost brothers and sisters the only thing that you are waiting for now is the Redemption of your body that's what you're waiting for and that's what the devil is trying to get you see he the devil tries to make you believe that because of the deterioration of this life and this flesh that there's something wrong in your heart doesn't he try something bad happens to you oh why is this happening is this not supposed to happen this way why because there's something in you that knows it's groaning for the Redemption of this body because that's the only step left that's why the creation is also groaning for the manifestations of the sons of God because if I could put it this way without sounding like I'm giving animals too much credit but the animals the trees the very Earth itself knows that the only thing left until it is renewed is for the bodies of the children of God to be renewed because our bodies and the Earth are intertwined we are one and the same our bodies are of the earth and that is what needs to be redeemed is this Earth with a baptism of fire does this all make sense to you I hope I hope I'm not like I'm not I'm trying to make it as simple as possible but remember when Christ died on Calvary remember the Earth was washed over in the days of Noah by water washing a water is a baptism that it was Sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ that fell on the ground at Calvary but the and the only thing left is that fire baptism to cleanse every demon from off the face of this Earth and to remake the earth a new Behold a new heavens and a new Earth that's why the creation is groaning right now that's why and what the and the devil twist it in your mind to make it seem like there's something wrong with you there's nothing wrong with you in in your soul if you're baptized if you're filled with the Holy Ghost there's nothing what it is is that you know somewhere deep inside that there's still more to be done that there's still one more step that's got to be taken I love that he says he says we're waiting for the adoption to Wi the Redemption of our bodies see you could see this I don't have time we we won't turn there but we know the scripture of the mount Transfiguration and brother brandham called that that was when Jesus Christ was adopted because remember he said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell hear ye him that was adoption remember if we we'll just do a quick overview remember back in the Eastern Traditions when a son was born he was a son always but he did not attain the position of a son until the father had deemed that he was ready to achieve that position at which point the the father would bring the son out clothe them in his own garments and tell him this day you are now my son everything I have is yours and on Mount Transfiguration remember Jesus Took Peter James and John faith hope and love up to the top of a mountain and Christ was transfigured before them and his reignment shown is the light and what was that Christ see every a lot of people have mistaken adoption to be just this great power that we have in Christ but adoption even Paul says it plainly through adoption is the Redemption of your body that's why when Christ see they were given a vision of Christ in his glorified form because when he received that adoption he received receed he also received the power of a Redemptive body though he didn't in in if we could say in realistic terms on the Earthly sense receive it just then because he still had to go die but it was showing them that the Redemption that adoption and Redemption of the body go hand in hand God was foreshadowing that this adoption and this this this Authority that was given Christ and the Redemption of the body went hand in hand because he was they were shown the glorified body at the same time and that's what God is trying to show us is that if we can get to that place of of if we could get ourselves so in love with him so one with him then how could anything but the Redemption of the body come because death has to be swallowed up in Victory at that point it has to be that way the only thing hindering it is ourselves because we have not yet sold out to him because what was it Christ had fully given himself over that's why those things could be that way but see we have to struggle through all these things and you know we got to realize who we are and it's fixed God made up his mind about you before the foundation of the world and God is I think sometimes looking at you said I made up my mind about you a long time ago when are you going to make up your mind about yourself let's all stand not hold you any long I hope this I'm not you know I don't I'm not trying to preach deep Mysteries to me these things so simple you look at the Garden of Eden Brothers and Sisters you see he didn't have a choice Adam had to do it because he had the he had the nature of God and the nature of God was to save himself because Eve was a part of him she was him he could not exist he could not see remember Paul said that they without us could not be made perfect Adam without Eve could not remain perfect god without you cannot remain perfect because remember perfect perfect means complete in its real true definition God is not complete without you it can't be you may think you're the littlest part of God you know you may think you're just the the pinky toenail on God's body but i' miss my pinky toenail I mean wouldn't you you you know so many times we take things for granted but you know if I if I had lost my pinky toenail every time I took my sock off and looked at it I said I wish that didn't you know what I mean it sounds in a silly in a but that's how God thinks about you he can't he cannot exist he can't exist without you any more than you could not exist without a part of yourself it just can't it can't because God the nature of God is that he is perfection he is complete in his nature and if you you so you cannot remove any part of his nature and that includes you I'm going to read while we're standing I want to read this one scripture I told you we're going to go back to Revelation 10:7 and I want you to I want you to realize this I want you to see this this just to be a little scripture and then I just want you that you can just dwell on this we'll just give this as a little final parting gift if we could say it that way I don't want to really preach on it remember we read the very first scripture we read was Revelation 5 he says who is worthy to take the book and loose the seals there on and John said he wept because no one in Earth was found worthy to take take the book or even look at it but I want you to see something this is the power of redemption Revelation 10 and we're going to read do 10 through uh 10 we're going to read verses 1 through 11 he said and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as BU as of fire and he hand in his hand a little book open now remember this is the book of redemption brother I'm talk about because this Angel this Mighty Angel is none other than Christ and he had his little book open and he said his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion woreth and when he had cried seven Thunders Thunders under their voices and when the seven Thunders uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the Sea and the things that there which therein are that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets now we've heard this scripture before but I want you to see this and we've heard this before but I want you to realize the significance of this scripture and the The Voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he sent it to me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey think about this five chapters ago John was So Unworthy that he was not even able to look at this book only Christ could take this book only Christ could loose those seals only Christ could look at it read it understand it even touch it but now John this is the power of redemption John who was once unworthy to eat even look at the book it's now commanded to take it now I have a question if in chapter five the only one worthy to take the book was the lamb but now in chapter 10 John takes the book then who is John he has to be a part of that Lamb of God there there is no other explanation for it because there's no mistake in the scripture so if if John was not worthy then but now he's worthy how does that work that means that there had to be something happened and that means only one thing don't you just chew on that that means that John could has to be as perfect as the lamb was just chew on that the rest of the day think about that John remember we've heard the scriptures a million times right no one he said I wept because no man in earth or anywhere was found worthy to open the book or even to look upon but now we go five chapters later after the lamb is loosed the after the lamb has loosed the seals after the lamb has loosed the seals and now John not only can can take the book and eat it but he's actually commanded to take the book and eat it just chew on that I hope that's all right let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer Lord Jesus Lord we love you and we appreciate you father Lord I pray oh God that the words that were spoken here this morning father would be edifying to your people Lord if there's anything that was said or done that was not pleasing in thy sight Lord God I pray that you forgive me Lord I pray that you just take the revelation of this word Lord God and that you'd sink it deep into our hearts help us to see who we are Lord and that you fix this thing from the foundation of the world Lord and not only that help us to really believe it and walk into it Lord and live it Lord that we may Lord just that we may become just absolutely in love with you more than we ever have Lord and that we'd serve you better than we ever have Lord we love you and we appreciate you father and we thank you Lord for all these things Lord in the name ofus
