[5:48] goodness unto us in Jesus Christ's name
[5:50] we pray believing amen
[5:54] hallelujah I mean you're happy to be the
[5:57] house of the Lord this evening amen let
[6:00] us open our Bibles to the Book of Luke
[6:02] chapter 24 verse 49 I don't intend to
[6:10] take too long this evening Luke 24
[6:19] chapter Luke chapter 24 verse 49 and
[6:27] behold I send the promise of my father
[6:29] upon you but tarry ye in the city of
[6:33] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[6:36] from on high
[6:37] you may take our seat continue reading
[6:41] well - you're seated and we see that
[6:45] this was Jesus before he was gone before
[6:49] the Ascension and he was talking to his
[6:52] disciples saying you go wait in
[6:54] Jerusalem until you are endued with
[6:57] power from on high he was telling them
[7:00] to wait until the day of Pentecost after
[7:04] he would come back and he would come and
[7:06] meet them a man would like to read
[7:09] another scripture in the book of Acts
[7:10] chapter 2 verse 1 to 4
[7:17] and when the day of Pentecost was fully
[7:20] come they were all in one Accord in one
[7:24] place and suddenly there came a sound
[7:29] from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind
[7:32] and it filled all the house where they
[7:35] were sitting and there appeared unto
[7:39] them cloven tongues like as of fire and
[7:43] take not as it set upon each of them and
[7:47] they were were all filled with the Holy
[7:51] Ghost and began to speak with other
[7:53] tongues as the Spirit gave them
[7:55] utterance you just want to take not
[7:58] unchopped ur three essays and they
[8:01] appeared unto them cloven tongues like
[8:03] as of fire and it's set upon each of
[8:07] them amen
[8:08] I'd like to speak on a small subject
[8:12] entitled personal experience here if you
[8:16] look at the wording of the Bible he says
[8:18] and it's set upon each of them and we
[8:23] know that they were about 120 disciples
[8:25] in the in the Upper Room as they were
[8:28] waiting for the for the Holy Ghost to
[8:31] come upon them as Christ had promised
[8:34] and here it was not a matter of a group
[8:38] but it was an individual affair Christ
[8:42] split all the cloven tongues of fire for
[8:45] each and every one of them so that each
[8:48] and every one could get a personal
[8:51] encounter with God amen and so what is
[8:55] the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the
[8:58] person of Christ coming to live within
[9:01] us we know in a lot of different places
[9:05] some schools of thoughts they they they
[9:09] explain the Holy Ghost to be some sort
[9:12] of emotion emotion or some theology that
[9:15] after you go through some school or
[9:17] after you go through a certain number of
[9:20] courses or anything then you have the
[9:23] Holy Ghost and they teach it amen
[9:26] but we know that's not right the prophet
[9:29] of God told us amen
[9:30] that the whole
[9:31] a ghost is Christ himself coming down to
[9:34] dwell within us amen we know in the Old
[9:37] Testament he was God above above them he
[9:42] will speak from above and he will speak
[9:44] through the prophets when God had a
[9:47] message for his people he had to speak
[9:49] from above so he was God above he was
[9:52] Jehovah a man but that was not good
[9:55] enough for him he did he he had a
[9:58] revered him he had a mediator which was
[10:01] a prophet to get to his people
[10:03] and he wanted to get closer to them that
[10:06] wasn't working out so well once he was
[10:08] up there and then he desired to come
[10:11] down on earth to condescend and become a
[10:14] man and dwell among us and he came down
[10:18] and God prepared a body called Jesus
[10:22] Christ and that's where he decided to
[10:24] dwell in amen and then he walked on the
[10:28] face of the earth grew up with people
[10:31] communicated with people he wanted to
[10:33] feel how it is being a man amen
[10:37] and he got into contact with his
[10:39] disciples he was leaving but still he
[10:42] thought that was gonna be better but it
[10:45] was just not close enough because even
[10:48] as he was walking with them they still
[10:51] had no idea who he was and that was not
[10:54] good enough amen then he devised a plan
[10:58] he wanted to get closer to people and
[11:01] the only way he could do it he had to
[11:03] come and dwell within us himself amen
[11:07] so that each and every one of us we have
[11:09] a personal relationship with God amen
[11:13] many people they take Christianity as a
[11:16] religion but it is not a religion
[11:19] because their religion you can get in
[11:21] and out of it but it is not a religion
[11:25] Christianity is a relationship with God
[11:28] amen until when he comes and lives
[11:31] within you he reflects himself from
[11:34] within you and everybody sees that you
[11:36] are acting like Christ
[11:37] you know when they called them the first
[11:40] time they called them Christians it was
[11:42] a nickname because they say
[11:45] they were acting like Christ they were
[11:48] showing all the characteristics of
[11:50] Christ that's why they say their
[11:52] christ-like so they are Christians amen
[11:55] from the very original day of Pentecost
[11:58] and now coming down through the ages us
[12:01] we are when we received the Holy Ghost
[12:04] - Christian true Christianity is when we
[12:08] reflect the life of Christ from within
[12:10] us amen
[12:11] wherever we live whenever we are talking
[12:14] we are supposed to show the life of
[12:16] Christ and since it is a relationship
[12:18] with God we do not try to live
[12:22] Christianity but it is automatic amen so
[12:26] Christ decided to come in and live
[12:28] within us to live within the people
[12:31] that's why he commanded them and he said
[12:34] you go tarry ye in Jerusalem until
[12:38] you've been endued with power from on
[12:40] high
[12:40] because he knew that without this power
[12:44] without the Holy Ghost they wouldn't be
[12:47] true Christians they couldn't be true
[12:51] witnesses of God because for you to be a
[12:53] true witness of God he has to be within
[12:56] you amen so that's why he decided to
[13:00] come in and dwell within them and from
[13:02] that day on they were Christians God
[13:05] living within them amen
[13:07] and now this is the book of Acts the
[13:11] prophet of God calls it the book of the
[13:14] book of the acts of the Holy Ghost in
[13:16] the Apostles so there was Christ working
[13:19] in the Apostles so it is the book of
[13:24] Acts of the Holy Ghost that was using
[13:27] the people amen
[13:28] so it was the Holy Ghost that was doing
[13:30] the work using the bodies of people
[13:32] because we know that God needs a body
[13:35] for him to you for him to work on earth
[13:37] amen
[13:38] even the devil as well he uses people so
[13:42] it is your own choice it is our own
[13:44] decision on whom we want to yield to
[13:47] amen
[13:48] either to yield to God or to yield to
[13:51] the devil because either way for that to
[13:54] work for God to work he uses that person
[13:57] for the devil to work
[13:59] to do his job he uses a person a man so
[14:02] we got to decide whom we want to be
[14:04] yielded to a man whom we want to build
[14:07] the relationship but now we are called
[14:10] the Bride of Christ a man and we know we
[14:13] are bride and we have that relationship
[14:15] with God the moment we have that Holy
[14:18] Ghost within us we know we are connected
[14:21] amen
[14:22] so after now he came in to live within
[14:25] the disciples that's when the book of
[14:28] Acts started and we have all these
[14:31] miracles that's when everything started
[14:32] but now the book of Acts does not have
[14:35] miracles only it also have persecutions
[14:39] of the Christians because the moment you
[14:42] received the Holy Ghost you have
[14:44] declared with the devil that it's time
[14:48] for war you have made the lines clear
[14:51] that you are they and I'm here we are
[14:53] not on the same side before you receive
[14:56] the Holy Ghost you are trying to live a
[14:58] Christian life you know the devil is not
[15:01] really sure if you're he's or not
[15:03] because sometimes you were there you're
[15:05] neither here not there but the moment
[15:07] you receive the Holy Ghost and you make
[15:09] your decision to follow Christ then
[15:12] that's when you know you have declared
[15:15] war with the devil that's when before
[15:19] before the crucifixion of Christ Peter
[15:22] was so scared and he rejected Christ
[15:24] three times it's because he didn't have
[15:27] the Holy Ghost yet he didn't have that
[15:29] courage and they didn't persecute him
[15:32] they left him like that but after the
[15:36] day of Pentecost after they started
[15:38] performing all these miracles healing
[15:41] people saying silver and gold have I
[15:44] none but what I have I give to you
[15:47] that's when they saw that these people
[15:49] are dangerous then they threw him into
[15:51] prison and started persecuting them
[15:53] because they had drawn lines with the
[15:56] devil to say you are they and I am here
[15:59] amen
[16:00] so when Jesus was walking on the face of
[16:03] the earth all the whole host of Hell
[16:07] they were looking at one man they had to
[16:12] I believe in modern day if we're looking
[16:14] at it they would have they would have a
[16:16] screen and a little track or one dot
[16:18] trying to see where he is at wherever
[16:22] Christ is then they have a meeting that
[16:25] man you see where he is going we have to
[16:28] go and disrupt his plans because we know
[16:31] wherever he is going there's a healing
[16:33] that's going to take place we'll know
[16:35] whenever he's going we know there are
[16:37] thousands of demons that are going to be
[16:39] cast out
[16:40] we know wherever he is going demons are
[16:42] going to be in trouble wherever he is
[16:45] going people are going to be saved so
[16:47] they they were all looking at this one
[16:50] little dot on this you screen probably
[16:53] under on the map of on the map of
[16:55] Jerusalem Israel wherever he went
[16:58] they were keeping track then they
[17:01] thought after crucifixion and they
[17:04] thought they devised a plan to kill him
[17:06] and after that they thought it was done
[17:09] the screen went blank they said we have
[17:13] finished it it is done amen
[17:18] but then after it doesn't a couple of a
[17:22] couple of weeks they just hit pan dam
[17:26] pandemonium happening in Jerusalem and
[17:28] they just pops 120 different dots now
[17:32] they were now they now had more trouble
[17:34] after the day of Pentecost than when
[17:37] Jesus was there because now 120 people
[17:40] we're now doing the work that Jesus was
[17:43] doing while she was by himself so Jesus
[17:46] Christ now he had he had most success
[17:49] using the diffusing of the disciples the
[17:52] 120 and we are told that that very day
[17:56] three thousand people were baptized so
[18:00] it was all a mess they didn't know whom
[18:02] to look at what to watch because the
[18:05] whole screen was full of dots just
[18:06] crisscross in the whole the whole
[18:09] country amen and that is the effect when
[18:13] Christ comes in you so for him to be rib
[18:16] for him to be born in each and every one
[18:19] of them he had to die so that like he
[18:22] said in the in the scriptures that for a
[18:24] seed to come forth
[18:25] it has to be buried so that it brings
[18:28] forth too many amen
[18:30] so when he was buried after he died on
[18:32] the cross of Calvary he was doing that
[18:35] so you and I we could rise up with him
[18:37] amen when he rose we rose up with him
[18:40] not he was no longer just doing it by
[18:43] himself but doing it through each and
[18:45] every one of us amen
[18:48] so it is our duty to keep the devil to
[18:51] keep the demons on their feet hallelujah
[18:54] so we need this Holy Ghost it is very
[18:58] important for us to have it because
[19:01] that's what makes us Christians right
[19:04] amen
[19:06] and now the Prophet talks about the
[19:09] importance of the of the Holy Ghost
[19:11] I read he says that's what the church
[19:14] needs tonight
[19:15] it's just stop starting so much theology
[19:19] and get down to the altar and pray until
[19:23] a personal experience burns down into
[19:26] the human heart and burns out all the
[19:29] darkness and gives a new vision amen you
[19:33] see he says you shall receive the Holy
[19:35] Ghost and fire you know the Holy Ghost
[19:38] is fire it burns out all the dross it
[19:41] burns out all the dirt and it burns out
[19:44] all your past amen
[19:46] whatever that you did in the past it
[19:49] doesn't exist no more because the the
[19:52] Holy Ghost and fire it is the most
[19:54] powerful purifier there is a man and
[19:57] when it burns all that it's no longer
[20:00] exists when the devil the accuser comes
[20:03] to you to say you did this you look at
[20:06] it and you say I don't see it it never
[20:08] happened I never did it in the first
[20:10] place a man this is what the Holy Ghost
[20:13] does for you and we amen
[20:15] so each and every day we leave knowing
[20:18] that we're we are living holy lives
[20:21] cling to God amen because we have
[20:24] nothing that condemns us of everything
[20:27] that we did it is attributed back to the
[20:30] devil because Paul tells us that in the
[20:34] New Testament that we are not imputed to
[20:36] sin sin is not imputed to us amen
[20:39] that's why the holy ghost does for us I
[20:42] read another quote from the prophet of
[20:44] God he says now look now to you people
[20:49] it's absolutely essential and the
[20:52] necessary and compelling and compulsory
[20:57] that you receive the Holy Ghost now for
[21:01] if you don't you can't come in the
[21:03] resurrection now watch God cannot break
[21:07] his laws we know that he follows his
[21:10] laws so he's telling us he is
[21:13] emphasizing how it is important since
[21:16] essential necessary compelling and
[21:20] compulsory you see without the Holy
[21:23] Ghost we cannot make it to the
[21:25] resurrection then what are we doing if
[21:29] we are not striving to make it into the
[21:32] resurrection you you try to leave your
[21:35] holy life but then you don't get the
[21:37] Holy Ghost you die you don't make it
[21:39] into the resurrection then what was all
[21:42] the trouble for amen so we have to
[21:45] strive and thrive to make sure we get
[21:48] the Holy Ghost because this is the
[21:50] person of Christ himself coming to live
[21:53] within us and when you have the Holy
[21:55] Ghost the Christa Christian life becomes
[21:58] automatic you don't have to think if
[22:02] this is right or wrong your body you're
[22:06] the Holy Ghost puts your whole body
[22:08] under subjection to everything that you
[22:10] were supposed to do when you try to say
[22:13] something you're not supposed to it will
[22:15] check you to say that's not right make
[22:18] it right when you try to do something
[22:20] that's wrong it will check you to say no
[22:22] that's not right because it is God
[22:25] that's living within us
[22:26] amen so when wherever our feet walks to
[22:29] that's where God wants us to go amen and
[22:32] he can never let us go in wrong places
[22:35] that's right you see when you get the
[22:39] Holy Ghost it it is all a matter of
[22:42] nature change it changes your whole
[22:45] nature into a brand-new man amen it's
[22:48] not like a ship that's wearing a wolf's
[22:51] clothing that he can take
[22:53] at any point in time it's not like that
[22:55] and it's not just a makeup that we come
[22:58] in with you somebody comes and sit they
[23:01] and we tell them you know what now
[23:04] you're a Christian you have to do this
[23:06] you have to do that do this and do that
[23:09] that's one other thing where we get it
[23:12] wrong we think that Christianity is a
[23:15] list of do's and don'ts but that's not
[23:19] what it is because when you exhaust that
[23:22] list you do a lot of are the wrongs
[23:25] that's not there but it is a life amen
[23:28] such that you do not have to think
[23:31] what's wrong what's not right you find
[23:33] yourself doing what's right but we are
[23:36] humans and we make mistakes
[23:39] Paul says I die every day I die daily
[23:43] but when you die every day you rise up
[23:46] amen
[23:47] because we are we are righteous people
[23:50] and a righteous person is one that when
[23:53] they fall they rise up they don't stay
[23:55] on the ground so whenever we make those
[23:58] mistakes we get up and we get going so
[24:02] the Holy Ghost changes your whole nature
[24:04] it's not something that is taught we do
[24:07] not teach the Holy Ghost it's the same
[24:10] like taking a pig a hug you take it out
[24:14] from from from the pen or whatever they
[24:16] stay you you brush it up nicely put some
[24:20] ribbons on it keep it in the house it's
[24:23] really good it's so smart for however
[24:27] long it is in the house but as soon as
[24:30] it rains you open up the door it will
[24:34] run straight into the puddle and lose
[24:37] you start rolling into the mud and what
[24:40] have you done you see you just dressed
[24:43] it up but what the Holy Ghost does it
[24:46] removes the whole nature such that when
[24:49] you when you are cleaned up and when you
[24:52] go into the house of God when you leave
[24:54] your appetite is different you do not
[24:57] want to go back to the mud to the murk
[24:59] that way you used to be because it is a
[25:02] whole nature that has been changed amen
[25:05] so that's why we
[25:06] the Holy Ghost because it's not
[25:08] something that's made up or something
[25:11] that is thought but it is a lifestyle it
[25:14] is a new lifestyle because you're like
[25:16] life your nature has been changed a man
[25:20] you see the prophet of God said and as
[25:23] long as that hog remains a hog his
[25:26] nature is a hog he'll go right back to
[25:29] that wallow
[25:29] so that will never change for life or in
[25:34] life to change you have to get the
[25:35] nature change amen
[25:37] to remove that nature because we were
[25:39] born in sin and shaped in iniquity and
[25:44] so we have we have the nature of the
[25:47] serpent in the Garden of Eden
[25:50] amen when when the origin of Cino
[25:53] occurred that's when that's how we all
[25:56] came through so we have that nature
[25:58] within us but now that's when we need
[26:01] God
[26:01] the second birth so that it comes and
[26:04] removes that nature that's that the
[26:07] first birth gave unto us so that we can
[26:10] be reborn and become Christians amen and
[26:13] be reborn by Christ hallelujah and now a
[26:19] lot of people and many a times we get
[26:23] under this pressure and this notion that
[26:26] we cannot make mistakes and we think
[26:29] that we are supposed to be holier than
[26:32] thou but it doesn't work like that
[26:35] we are all humans and we are bound to
[26:39] fail no matter how strong of a Christian
[26:42] you are so long you are in this body we
[26:46] are going to get tempted so long you are
[26:49] in this flesh you are still going to get
[26:52] tempted the only time we are not going
[26:55] to we are going to stop being tempted is
[26:58] when we have this body change amen so
[27:01] until then the fight is on we keep on
[27:05] going amen but that doesn't draw us back
[27:08] because we know that the Bible tells us
[27:12] that there is no temptation that's
[27:14] uncommon to man
[27:17] every trial that is set before you
[27:20] before it was set you already given the
[27:24] power to overcome it
[27:25] amen so you go through it and when you
[27:29] fail you realize and you say you go to
[27:32] God you pray and you say god I failed it
[27:35] this time
[27:35] may you please grant me the strength
[27:37] next time so that I overcome it next
[27:41] time when you come up you come out as a
[27:43] victor you come out victorious as an
[27:45] overcomer amen because that's what we
[27:48] are we are meant to be overcomers
[27:51] because in psalms david said when
[27:56] afflictions come on the righteous he
[27:58] will deliver out of some of them out of
[28:02] them all
[28:04] when afflictions come on the righteous
[28:06] he would deliver out of them all and we
[28:10] are the righteous of God earlier on we
[28:13] said a righteous person doesn't mean
[28:15] somebody who doesn't sin a righteous
[28:18] person is one when they sin they get
[28:21] back up again amen
[28:23] if we look into the Bible and try to
[28:28] count the number of sins and wrong
[28:30] things that Saul and David did the
[28:36] gravity of the sins that David did are
[28:39] worse than the ones that Saul did but
[28:43] God said I am the seed of David and he
[28:46] says David is a man after my own heart
[28:49] amen why is that but he committed most
[28:52] sins and his his all the generations
[28:56] after him were given the kingdom but so
[28:59] when he made one mistake when he failed
[29:02] to obey the kingdom was taken away from
[29:05] was taken away from his family but he
[29:08] just did one mistake why is that because
[29:11] David was a righteous man every time he
[29:14] fell down he got back up he had that
[29:18] thing he had that God had placed
[29:21] something within him that whenever he
[29:24] was drawn further away from God he had
[29:26] that longing to want to come back to God
[29:29] amen
[29:29] because of
[29:31] God had pleased in him because oh he was
[29:34] a righteous man so a righteous man
[29:36] whenever one Falls you get up and you
[29:39] get going now we have a promise to us
[29:42] that if we are righteous
[29:44] whenever afflictions come upon us God
[29:47] will deliver out of he will deliver us
[29:50] out of them all so whenever you come
[29:54] across afflictions that you think you
[29:56] cannot get out of you go to God and to
[29:59] point at the scripture and you say Lord
[30:02] your word says when afflictions come
[30:04] upon me you said you would deliver me
[30:07] out of it
[30:08] because the word is not the word the
[30:12] word is what God said and God never lies
[30:15] so you got to hold him accountable for
[30:18] the word you say Lord this is what I see
[30:21] in your word may you please fulfill it
[30:23] in my life because I have done that
[30:26] which you require of me I'm trying to
[30:29] live a righteous life for you amen and
[30:31] he will always come through for you amen
[30:35] you know the the fervent prayer of a
[30:39] righteous man availeth much like we
[30:41] spoken last Saturday in last Sunday when
[30:43] you are a righteous man when you pray
[30:46] you have the main line you get priority
[30:50] it says okay you can put that one on
[30:53] pause you can put that one on pause
[30:54] let's listen to that one because you are
[30:57] you pray availeth much amen God will
[31:01] listen to you because you are a
[31:02] righteous man so whenever you follow up
[31:05] get up rise up and get going amen that's
[31:09] the definition of the righteous man God
[31:11] will always provide a way out and we
[31:14] know that through these temptations
[31:16] trials and fallings that's how we get
[31:21] perfected because we are told that that
[31:24] Christ although he was a son he learned
[31:28] obedience through suffering so the
[31:33] sufferings are the ones that made up his
[31:35] nature to mate however he got to being
[31:39] the perfect being that he was it was due
[31:43] to the suffering that
[31:45] he went through and although he was a
[31:47] son of God he went through that
[31:49] so we offspring of God we sons of God we
[31:54] have to go through that as well because
[31:57] Christ was the first ship waving that in
[32:00] as much as this one has come to maturity
[32:03] we are also coming through that and so
[32:06] we are taught to be perfect as he was
[32:09] perfect and so we are perfected by this
[32:12] trials tribulations and temptations so
[32:16] counted all joy when you fall into
[32:18] divers temptations Amen because they are
[32:21] meant to perfect you because that's what
[32:24] Christ wants and when he is going to
[32:27] come back he's going to he is coming
[32:29] back for a perfect bride but perfect
[32:32] doesn't mean you don't you don't do
[32:34] wrong you cannot do wrong you can do but
[32:37] you will fix it as soon as you do amen
[32:40] and he looks at you and he say you are
[32:42] blameless he looks at you and he says
[32:44] you are spotless amen you see that's how
[32:48] we get to be come into the state of the
[32:51] perfect man virtue knowledge temperance
[32:55] patience it comes with time being
[33:00] patient with your with your brothers you
[33:02] know first time somebody some somebody
[33:07] offends you you just get off right quick
[33:09] then you you reflect back to it and you
[33:13] say there was a bit extra you pray to
[33:16] God lord please give me more patience
[33:20] with my brothers next time it happens
[33:23] you let it go next time else something
[33:27] happens you let it go then you are
[33:31] building yourself God is building you to
[33:34] being a perfect person amen and it is a
[33:37] victory character is a victory God does
[33:41] not put you through a pipe and take you
[33:43] out through the other you have to strive
[33:46] you have to fight for you to get it amen
[33:49] and when Christ is going to come he's
[33:52] going to try and find he's looking to
[33:55] come and get the perfect bride that's
[33:58] what he is coming for
[33:59] he comes for something that looks like
[34:01] him amen
[34:03] it's like the gold the gold purifiers
[34:08] when they go and mind the gold it is it
[34:11] has so much impurities within it but
[34:15] because it has impurities the gold miner
[34:18] does not trash it it has a lot of value
[34:22] but he takes it and then starts
[34:25] purifying it until he or she can see
[34:28] their face in the gold when they see
[34:31] their own reflection then they can say
[34:34] it is now pure amen
[34:35] so those trials those tribulations that
[34:39] you are going to count it all joy
[34:42] because it is for your perfection Amen
[34:45] God is working on you he is removing
[34:48] those impurities he is removing
[34:51] impatience he is removing that lying
[34:54] after some time you say oh I used to lie
[34:57] but I lied no more why because he is
[35:00] perfecting you each and every day Amen
[35:02] you are getting closer to being what God
[35:05] is like a man and slowly he's removing
[35:08] all those impurities until he can see
[35:11] himself within you and he sees his own
[35:14] reflection coming up from you and he can
[35:16] say that's my bride amen
[35:19] we are cause we are cold people who are
[35:22] called by his name and he is Jesus
[35:24] Christ and since we are bride we are
[35:27] mrs. Jesus amen is that right so that's
[35:30] what he is going to come forth he's
[35:32] going to come for a bride that is
[35:34] perfect so count it all joy because all
[35:37] it is working out in your favor
[35:39] that's what he is coming back for amen
[35:42] so you do not have to worry there is
[35:45] nothing that's added to the gold when
[35:48] it's gotten it's just taken out as it is
[35:51] with the dirt that is it has and it is
[35:54] purified and the impurity is removed
[35:57] so whatever that you need God has given
[36:01] you no need to worry that I'm lacking
[36:05] this or I'm lacking that just as you are
[36:09] God justified you
[36:12] prophet of God a likens justification to
[36:15] a person who goes to get um a glass from
[36:20] from a dirty glass from from trash you
[36:24] go and take it it is dirty but he just
[36:28] goes and he selects that one there are
[36:31] many other ones that are there but you
[36:34] preferred that just that specific one
[36:36] and you take it and you go and you clean
[36:39] it up and then it is set aside for use
[36:42] amen that's what you and I were when we
[36:46] were walking down those streets doing
[36:48] wrong we had no idea we just looked like
[36:51] everybody else but there was something
[36:53] special about us and when God came and
[36:55] he chose us because he had predestinated
[36:58] us before the foundation of the world
[37:00] amen and he came and he picked us out
[37:03] out of that Mary clay and he justified
[37:06] us he cleansed us so that we could be
[37:09] Versalles of Honor and he can he can
[37:12] dwell within us amen
[37:13] so that is what he is requiring for us
[37:16] from us amen
[37:18] so do not worry he has predestinated you
[37:22] before the foundation of the world you
[37:24] cannot fail amen
[37:27] because the scripture tells us that God
[37:30] will never lose none that I his so the
[37:35] moment you know you see the word the
[37:37] depot in you calls back to the dip that
[37:40] is in the word you know you are chosen
[37:42] you are bright and you tell the devil I
[37:45] cannot fail amen
[37:47] can somebody say that this evening I
[37:49] cannot fail hallelujah because we were
[37:53] chosen before the foundation of the
[37:55] world and now God now is obligated the
[38:00] prophet of God tells us that God is more
[38:02] willing to give you the Holy Ghost more
[38:04] than you want to so it is just a matter
[38:07] of going to God you say God I have come
[38:11] may I have the Holy Ghost
[38:13] may you please dwell within me the
[38:16] formula for it it was spelled out at the
[38:20] day of Pentecost they said how shall we
[38:22] receive the Holy Ghost you say repent
[38:25] and be
[38:25] sighs and you shall be filled with a
[38:27] gift of the Holy Ghost which is Christ
[38:30] giving you a piece of him south amen so
[38:33] when you receive when you receive the
[38:36] Holy Ghost now you did you become a
[38:38] different and a new creature amen
[38:41] so now that's why your that's all you
[38:43] have to do just go to God and say God
[38:46] please may I have the Holy Ghost and
[38:48] many a times the prophet of God says we
[38:51] fail to get the desperation that's
[38:53] needed
[38:54] we just come then you say well if you
[38:58] give me all that's fine if you don't
[38:59] that's it
[39:00] we need the desperation we need to come
[39:04] and say Lord if I cannot leave until you
[39:07] give it to me I forgot the name of this
[39:09] other gentleman he said Lord if you
[39:12] don't give it to me today you when you
[39:15] come back you will find a pile of my
[39:17] bones right here because I am NOT going
[39:20] to leave until you touch me amen the
[39:22] prophet of God told is that when we come
[39:24] to the altar we should come with that
[39:27] sincerity we should come with that
[39:29] desperation to say God you please come
[39:31] and touch me and he is more willing to
[39:34] do that more than you want to receive it
[39:36] amen
[39:37] so when you receive the Holy Ghost you
[39:40] have this relationship established with
[39:41] God and everyone knows that amen
[39:44] the other day we talked about the sons
[39:46] of sceva they knew they knew that Paul
[39:50] was making was having all these miracles
[39:53] and they went they they tried to chase
[39:55] this demon the demon says and Paul we
[39:59] know Jesus we know but we just don't
[40:02] know you because they never had the Holy
[40:04] Ghost they didn't have the relationship
[40:06] that they were supposed to have with God
[40:08] so without that Devils are not scared of
[40:12] you so you gotta have the Holy Ghost
[40:14] amen
[40:15] each and every one of us have to get to
[40:18] that point if we are Christians we have
[40:20] to get to that point where we can point
[40:22] back to say on that day since this day
[40:26] my life has never been the same again
[40:28] because that's when I met God amen
[40:31] we look at Jacob when he was there he
[40:35] knew his grandfather Abraham it had an
[40:38] experience
[40:39] with God he knew that his father had had
[40:42] an experience with God and he had come
[40:45] to a point we know that Jacob was as was
[40:47] as a planter and he was just leaving
[40:50] anyway anyhow but he came to a point
[40:53] where he needed it he remembered his
[40:56] father had a personal experience with
[40:58] God when God talked to Abraham mouth to
[41:02] ear and he said leave the land of the
[41:05] Chaldeans and I'll give you a land that
[41:07] I have set for you amen and Abraham
[41:10] could say I remember this day God came
[41:13] to me and he chose me out from the
[41:16] people that were there and he had to
[41:18] leave his family and he lead had to
[41:20] leave everybody else because he was
[41:22] hearing to the call of God amen and we
[41:25] are told that Abraham was a hidden they
[41:27] were worshipping idols but when God came
[41:30] to tell him he left all that to follow
[41:32] what God had in store for him what God
[41:35] had commissioned him for amen and now we
[41:38] see lot just followed Abraham he had no
[41:42] idea why Abraham was leaving he was just
[41:45] following and he never had that contact
[41:48] he never heard that personal experience
[41:50] with God he didn't have a point where he
[41:54] could say this day God told me this God
[41:58] met me I had this personal experience
[42:00] with God you see that's what happens
[42:03] many many a times people just follow
[42:05] people with the revelations strange
[42:08] revelations and you ask them could you
[42:11] explain that they say no so-and-so told
[42:15] me this this and that we are not talking
[42:17] about so in sauce revelation what did
[42:20] God reveal to you amen you have to get
[42:22] that personal revelation from God so
[42:25] that you can be answerable for whatever
[42:28] you believe not just getting different
[42:31] revelations and following whatever that
[42:34] is because if a revelation is explained
[42:37] to you it can be unexplained to you so
[42:40] you have to get that personal experience
[42:43] so that you can say for sure I know that
[42:47] this was God and I know that what I have
[42:49] is it's I'm holding substance and
[42:53] will not let this go because this is my
[42:55] lifeline this is what God told me amen
[42:58] and he came down Abraham bought Isaac
[43:01] and Isaac he had a point in time where
[43:04] he could point back and he says this was
[43:07] God he says this day my life almost
[43:10] ended but God provided a lamp instead of
[43:13] me I could have been sacrificed but I
[43:16] know that it was God who brought who
[43:19] created that lamp and it got stuck in
[43:22] the bush amen and that was his own
[43:24] personal experience and this was a time
[43:27] he could remember amen
[43:29] so Jacob knew all about this he was told
[43:32] all this history I believe and he knew
[43:34] and we know Jacob us as a planter and he
[43:38] was just living anyway if somebody when
[43:43] people were at home if they would miss
[43:45] something they would ask everybody else
[43:48] have you seen this have you seen this
[43:51] they'll just say um did you ask Jacob
[43:54] because he was always the suspect
[43:57] everybody knew him to be a cheater he
[44:00] cheated his way through everything even
[44:04] he cheated even doubt on how he got his
[44:06] wealth with his um with with his ax
[44:09] father-in-law Laban he cheated through
[44:11] everything but it came to a point in
[44:14] time when he had to meet back his his
[44:17] brother his twin brother Esau and he
[44:20] knew now that this was a matter of life
[44:23] and death
[44:24] it was now different he remembered all
[44:27] the supplanting he had done all the
[44:29] cheating's he had done it was nothing he
[44:31] counted in vain and he knew that his
[44:34] life was at stake he looked at his
[44:36] children he looked at his wives he
[44:38] looked at everything he had that meant
[44:41] nothing because until unless he would
[44:44] meet God his life was going to be ended
[44:47] that's when he got desperate and he got
[44:50] to a point where he went and he started
[44:52] praying and until the angel of the Lord
[44:55] came down and he started wrestling with
[44:58] the angel until almost daybreak almost
[45:01] up until the Sun almost came out and he
[45:04] said I'm not going to leave you
[45:06] until you bless me because he knew that
[45:08] if the angel was gonna go without giving
[45:12] him an assurance yeah he he was going to
[45:16] be in trouble with Esau but he held on
[45:20] to the angel and he fought until he he
[45:23] broke his hip and he could say this day
[45:26] just before daybreak I had an experience
[45:29] with God and he could point back to that
[45:32] a man and from then on his life was
[45:35] changed and his name was changed from
[45:37] Jacob to Israel why because he had met
[45:41] God he started working different when
[45:44] people will see they say Jacob is now
[45:46] walking different used to walk straight
[45:48] but now he's walking crooked why
[45:50] something should have happened to him
[45:52] amen I believe he started talking
[45:55] different because he had met Christ amen
[45:58] and thus what happens to all of us amen
[46:01] when we meet Christ people can see they
[46:04] say you used to do this you don't do it
[46:07] no more why because you had an
[46:09] experience your language is now
[46:12] different you don't speak the words you
[46:14] used to speak before why because you had
[46:17] an experience with Christ amen
[46:20] so whenever you have a personal
[46:23] experience with God
[46:24] people will see you do not have to say
[46:27] it people can tell there is a mark
[46:29] that's just visible to say this person
[46:32] has been somewhere they should have met
[46:35] God amen so your Christianity you do not
[46:39] have to walk just by the way you leave
[46:41] you people come and ask you what's so
[46:44] different about you how come you don't
[46:47] you don't wear pants for for the sisters
[46:50] how come you don't you don't wear pants
[46:52] so the Bible said we are the salt of the
[46:54] earth we gave we give the savour to it
[46:58] the flavor so people get thirsty they
[47:00] want to come and find out more about it
[47:02] amen
[47:03] that's what we ought to be when we
[47:05] receive the Holy Ghost
[47:07] so Jacob now came to a point where you
[47:09] could say this day that's when I met God
[47:13] you see God does not have grandchildren
[47:16] or he just everybody is the same so
[47:19] whether your parents God the Holy Ghost
[47:21] or not well if your parents go the Holy
[47:25] Ghost he don't mean that you and also be
[47:28] automatically it comes to you it's
[47:31] different you have to have your own
[47:33] personal experience amen
[47:35] he doesn't share the Holy Ghost the Holy
[47:38] Ghost is not inherited it has to come
[47:41] down upon you amen
[47:42] so if your great-great-grandfather was a
[47:46] message believer that means nothing
[47:50] yourself you have still to come and come
[47:53] and have a personal experience with God
[47:55] because you will be accountable for
[47:57] yourself because we Gentiles we
[48:00] accountable unto God individually it is
[48:04] only Israel that is saved as a nation
[48:06] amen
[48:07] so we have to get this personal
[48:10] revelation of who God is to us one time
[48:14] Christ as the disciples he said whom do
[48:17] men say that I am and they started
[48:19] saying different things they say that's
[48:21] that's in the Matthew 16 chapter 13
[48:24] Matthew chapter 16 verse 30 and I
[48:26] believe he says who demands who do men
[48:29] say that I am some studies say you some
[48:32] say you are Isaiah some say you are
[48:35] Elias
[48:35] Jeremiah they started off saying all the
[48:38] different names but then he said okay
[48:40] that's fine but what did you say that I
[48:43] am a man how do you see me as and Peter
[48:47] said you are Christ the Son of the
[48:50] Living God and God said Jesus Christ
[48:53] said unto him flesh and blood has not
[48:55] revealed this unto you a man because he
[48:58] knew there was a personal revelation to
[49:00] Peter nothing could shake him off that
[49:02] you couldn't come and tell him anything
[49:04] different because he had had that
[49:06] personal revelation and he knew it was
[49:09] he is a man so that's what we ought to
[49:12] do to have that perfect to have that
[49:14] personal experience personal revelation
[49:17] that we can hold onto as substance
[49:20] holding onto as a lifeline knowing that
[49:23] my life depends on this amen because
[49:25] that's what Christ means to me amen so
[49:29] you cannot get an experience explain
[49:33] to you neither can it be taught we look
[49:36] at Moses we know Moses the children of
[49:39] Israel had been crying they knew 400
[49:41] years were up and they knew it was time
[49:43] for a deliverer to come and the prophet
[49:47] of God tells us that Moses his mother
[49:49] and father
[49:50] that's a merman Djokovic he told us that
[49:53] they were praying they were praying
[49:56] fasting day and night for this deliverer
[49:59] and when Moses was born they knew that
[50:02] he was a deliverer but now and God made
[50:06] it possible that Moses was raised by his
[50:09] own mother in the in the palace of
[50:12] Pharaoh and she was being paid to suckle
[50:15] her own child a man and then Moses as he
[50:20] was growing up
[50:21] his mother always told him that you are
[50:23] a deliverer and he knew it and it was
[50:27] true that he was a deliverer and now
[50:30] with that knowledge that revelation that
[50:34] had been taught to him he tried to go
[50:37] and carry out the duties of being a
[50:39] deliverer and that's when he went and he
[50:42] killed one Egyptian and after that he
[50:45] was a fugitive why because he was trying
[50:48] to carry out a commission on a tort
[50:51] revelation he hadn't gone to meet the
[50:55] person who had given the commission he
[50:57] hadn't met God yet for him to the person
[51:01] who had given him the commission to be a
[51:02] deliverer a man but after 40 years he
[51:06] was in the desert he came to a point
[51:08] where he came to the burning bush that's
[51:11] when God said it is now time for me to
[51:14] make myself manifest to Moses Amen and
[51:16] that's when he came and he said removi
[51:19] of your shoes for way you are standing
[51:21] is holy ground and that's when Moses saw
[51:24] this burning bush that's when he had a
[51:27] personal experience and Moses knew that
[51:30] God the God they would pray and say the
[51:33] God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[51:35] so that was a historical God to Moses
[51:38] but now God said it has time for me to
[51:41] make myself make manifest unto Moses and
[51:45] he said I am
[51:47] that I am which is present tense so he
[51:50] was letting Moses know that I I want to
[51:53] be your God
[51:54] yes I am Abraham's God yes I am Isaac
[51:58] job
[51:58] Isaac's god I am Jobs God but now I am
[52:03] that I am I want to become your God he
[52:06] was making it revealed to to Moses amen
[52:10] and when he had that experience he had
[52:13] he had a one-man invasion and he went
[52:17] back and he delivered the whole nation
[52:18] why because he had had this personal
[52:21] experience and he had this revelation
[52:23] amen
[52:25] one more quote the prophet of God said
[52:28] if I went here to a church member and I
[52:31] said what do you think of Jesus Christ
[52:33] who was he why he was the son of God
[52:36] well how do you know my posture say so
[52:39] your past is right but what do you know
[52:43] about it see mother's right and the
[52:46] pastor is right but before you know he
[52:49] is the son of God the Bible said no man
[52:51] can say Jesus is the Christ only by the
[52:55] Holy Ghost amen the Holy Ghost has to
[53:00] witness it too you must be a personal
[53:02] experience I hope you see that no matter
[53:05] how much you go to church how well your
[53:08] name is engraved or on its stained
[53:11] windows Oh book it'll never mean nothing
[53:14] to you until you are witness you're a
[53:17] witness of the resurrection of Jesus
[53:19] Christ by the infilling of the power of
[53:22] the Holy Spirit amen so it is good to
[53:26] come to church but that doesn't make
[53:28] that doesn't guarantee you the Holy
[53:30] Ghost after you come to church you have
[53:33] to go the further step to say Lord may
[53:36] you please fill me and that is the only
[53:38] way we can be true witnesses of the
[53:40] resurrection of Jesus Christ but getting
[53:43] the Holy Ghost filled within us amen and
[53:45] that's how we can become we can have
[53:49] personal experiences and we can become
[53:51] perfect weaknesses for for Jesus amen
[53:54] now we can talk about Paul when he was
[53:59] on the road to Damascus
[54:01] he was given this knowledge that he was
[54:05] serving God by persecuting the
[54:06] Christians and to him he was doing God a
[54:10] service by persecuting this cult of
[54:13] people who supposedly followed a person
[54:17] who said you drink my blood and he was
[54:21] doing God a service but then God said no
[54:25] you have had you been you have been
[54:29] having new revelations shoved down your
[54:31] throat for a while it's now time for me
[54:33] to give you my own revelation to have
[54:36] your own personal experience and on his
[54:39] road to Damascus
[54:41] that's when Christ shine that light and
[54:44] his and his donkey stopped and that's
[54:47] when Christ had a conversation with Paul
[54:49] you see Paul after that he was so bold
[54:53] because it was not something he had been
[54:55] told he wasn't taught by Peter to say
[54:58] this is what it is and this is what
[55:00] happened he knew he had a personal
[55:02] revelation he knew he had a personal
[55:04] experience that he could point back to
[55:07] and he said Jesus Christ spoke to me
[55:10] amen from this day on my life was
[55:13] different from this day on I was one
[55:17] soul but now from this day my name
[55:19] changed to Paul amen a name change is
[55:22] the same as a life changing that's when
[55:25] my lifestyle changed because I had a
[55:27] personal experience with God amen and we
[55:30] wrote all this he wrote Paul wrote the
[55:33] the New Testament why because it was a
[55:36] man who had had a personal revelation
[55:38] where they had a personal experience and
[55:41] a feeling of the Holy Ghost so brothers
[55:43] and sisters it's Bhuvan us that we have
[55:46] the Holy Ghost it is essential and it is
[55:50] very important that we have the Holy
[55:53] Ghost because that is the only way we
[55:55] can make the rapture and that is the
[55:57] only way we can get to come into the
[55:59] resurrection because of the Holy Ghost
[56:02] amen
[56:02] and God is willing to give you the Holy
[56:05] Ghost more than you are asking for it
[56:08] you just come to God desperate enough
[56:11] and you say Lord may you please fill me
[56:14] and God
[56:15] is always so faithful that he will give
[56:17] it to you because he knows by giving it
[56:20] to you you were going to get more
[56:22] victory by giving it to you nothing can
[56:25] stand in your way
[56:26] amen because it is he himself who is
[56:29] doing it amen
[56:30] he is different from other people that
[56:33] when they send you they send you and
[56:35] they go the other way but when God sends
[56:38] you as soon as he finished sending you
[56:40] he comes in and he comes in with the new
[56:43] and he comes out and do what and he does
[56:46] what he has sent you to do right using
[56:48] your body amen
[56:49] isn't that wonderful knowing that
[56:52] wherever you go so long you are in the
[56:54] will of God you know that God is within
[56:56] you wherever you go whatever you do you
[56:59] know that God is within you that it is
[57:01] God who is doing it amen and he said
[57:05] whatever you do to this little ones you
[57:07] have done it unto me amen so he knows
[57:10] that when you have the Holy Ghost you
[57:13] are invincible that's why the devil
[57:15] always tries to ask you to he wants you
[57:18] to to procrastinate to say no no today
[57:22] I'm getting some other time when I have
[57:23] more time whilst today is today get on
[57:27] your knees and you say lord please feel
[57:29] me and it doesn't mean that you were
[57:32] only supposed to get it once the prophet
[57:34] of God tells us that we are supposed to
[57:36] get refilling over over again amen
[57:40] rejuvenation you pray Lord fill me again
[57:43] because it is like David say the cool
[57:46] waters of Bethlehem you just want to
[57:48] keep on having more of it amen
[57:50] so however many times you have gotten it
[57:54] you still need more and more refilling
[57:57] of the Holy Ghost because this is
[57:59] important for us to get this is Christ
[58:02] dwelling with dinners amen
