[20:31] a manga bless you amen you know God is
[20:40] so good to us
[20:42] hallelujah Matthew six please we had a
[20:50] good time there in Iowa City appreciate
[20:54] your prayers
[20:58] yeah appreciate our brother rich going
[21:06] with this we're going to start reading
[21:18] at the ninth verse of the sixth chapter
[21:21] of Matthew after this manner therefore
[21:29] pray our Father which art in heaven
[21:34] hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[21:39] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[21:44] heaven you love the Lord let us pray
[21:49] father we thank you for your grace thank
[21:52] you for your mercy thank you for the
[21:54] reading of your word Lord we just pray
[21:56] that tonight that you just have have
[22:01] your way give us the strength increase
[22:04] our faith in you Lord in Jesus Christ's
[22:07] name we pray amen
[22:09] you may be seated when we use this
[22:14] little illustration again by God's grace
[22:17] and I just hope that you can see what
[22:21] I'm working with but I'm liking this
[22:26] bottom here as being God and I'm alike
[22:28] in this bottle as being his adversary
[22:30] which is the devil you have two origins
[22:33] here this amen
[22:36] is eternal life and this here is the
[22:40] beginning of a creation or creation
[22:43] Lucifer has never been eternal had he
[22:47] been eternal he would have remained with
[22:50] God remember the scripture says if they
[22:54] were not of us if they were of us they
[22:57] would have remained but because they're
[22:59] not of us they leave and so you and I
[23:02] must understand Amen that those who came
[23:05] from God will always go back to God
[23:07] Jesus himself said
[23:09] I have never lost one Moses told Pharaoh
[23:13] I would not even loot leave oh one hoof
[23:16] behind you understand me so when God
[23:19] gathers and I'm gonna read that
[23:20] scripture in just a minute when God
[23:22] gather he comes to gather his own you
[23:25] understand me redeem means to buy back
[23:28] that which once was yours
[23:31] and so so Redemption tells us that
[23:34] somewhere in eternity we was God with
[23:39] God and so you must understand Amen that
[23:42] that that's why Lucifer can be destroyed
[23:44] Amen because he was created being at the
[23:48] time of Lucifer's reign or at the time
[23:50] that Lucifer was if I could say in a
[23:54] position of holiness none of the Angels
[23:56] knew who he was
[23:57] Amen they just thought he was one of
[23:59] them but your origin will always
[24:03] determine what is manifest down the road
[24:06] alright and so Lucifer because he would
[24:09] God said iniquity was found in him he
[24:13] did not even speak it with his own mouth
[24:14] but God being a god that can judge the
[24:18] heart so what was in the heart of
[24:20] Lucifer for thou have said in your heart
[24:22] I will Excel I will Excel I would go
[24:27] beyond I will exalt myself above the
[24:31] stars of God so God saw that now you
[24:34] must understand that there is only one
[24:36] God and God is a jealous God he says in
[24:39] the Book of Isaiah Amen if there's any
[24:41] other god I don't know him Amen so we
[24:44] realized by God's grace that this is God
[24:47] let's put it this way
[24:48] alright the Bible tells us that Jesus
[24:50] Christ was the fullness of the Godhead
[24:52] bodily alright amen
[24:55] he said unto David David said he said
[24:58] David wanted to build God a house he
[25:00] said what house can you build me right
[25:02] Tim ha heaven is my throne and the earth
[25:06] is my footstool what can you build me
[25:08] but the Bible tells us that God prepared
[25:11] himself a body right so I want you to
[25:15] understand if I took this let's put take
[25:18] this out of the bottle let's say this is
[25:20] in this is God's Spirit right
[25:23] now we're not interested in the bottle
[25:27] we interested in what the bottle is
[25:28] contained in we want that substance and
[25:32] if this is God in this bottle amen ask
[25:35] I'm trying to give you a great scenario
[25:38] so you can see what I'm working with God
[25:41] poured all of his substance let's put it
[25:45] this way all of his character into Jesus
[25:48] Christ and this is what Jesus Christ
[25:50] says I can't do nothing except I see the
[25:54] father do it so the Bible tells us that
[25:58] Jesus Christ that God is a spirit no man
[26:01] I've seen God at any time follow me now
[26:03] because I'm gonna deal with you you need
[26:06] to know exactly who you are and where
[26:07] you come from
[26:08] amen once you come to know who you
[26:11] really are you as an individual becomes
[26:13] an invincible army Satan cannot just do
[26:17] it we'll what he desired to do with you
[26:19] because at that time when you come to
[26:21] know who you are
[26:22] you understand that you are Satan's God
[26:27] Satan is not your God you rule over him
[26:31] you come from the royal family your sons
[26:34] and daughters of God and Satan has never
[26:37] been a son yeah II understand me because
[26:40] to be a son you have to be begotten II
[26:43] right okay and the Bible tells us that
[26:46] Jesus Christ was the only begotten right
[26:50] so we find out that all that was in God
[26:53] he poured it into Christ and all that
[26:57] was in Christ he poured it into what the
[26:59] church right that means you you you all
[27:02] of us who got the Holy Ghost that is God
[27:05] in you
[27:06] right that's what he did at the
[27:09] communion he did it at the communion one
[27:11] bread one God broken into what many
[27:14] pieces but it takes all those pieces to
[27:17] make one bread right in Jesus he was one
[27:20] body but in his bride
[27:22] he's many bodies so much so a man no man
[27:26] can number them to make myself clear and
[27:30] plain by God's grace so you would
[27:32] understand among the Jewish people they
[27:35] said to kill a man
[27:37] to kill a universe hello think about if
[27:42] you can love a man what you're doing so
[27:46] if you're kill a man you kill but you
[27:47] kill a universe why would you say that
[27:49] because understand we'll never know how
[27:53] many seeds were in the tree of Abel
[27:57] because he was killed but let's look at
[28:00] his dad his dad it was Adam look what
[28:02] Adam has produced numbers cannot be
[28:07] numbered from the days of Adam from the
[28:10] days all the way up you see all the seed
[28:12] all mankind all the image of Adam amen
[28:15] multiplying multiplying multiplying and
[28:17] we know that one soul saved is worth ten
[28:22] thousand worlds so you talk about a
[28:26] kingdom you're talking about a one tree
[28:29] because you and I know how it is
[28:31] you got an apple tree you got an orange
[28:32] tree and each tree produces fruit year
[28:36] at the year at the year at the year
[28:38] until there's no more seeds in the tree
[28:42] but you are look at that one seed that
[28:45] you plant it understand that seed came
[28:47] from somewhere so some multiplication is
[28:51] a consistence is a a constant C being
[28:55] reproduce reproduce reproduce reproduce
[28:57] what if you stopped that one seed right
[29:01] so that's what the devil tried to do he
[29:04] tried to stop the seed of of Jesus
[29:07] Christ like he stopped the seed of Seth
[29:09] Seth has no seed Seth has nothing right
[29:15] so you look at this thing and say what
[29:17] brother was what are you trying to say
[29:18] I'm bringing us to a point you came from
[29:21] somewhere and you're going somewhere but
[29:24] if you came from God there is no way
[29:27] you've been turned back into this sea
[29:31] because once God brings you out of
[29:33] himself you will always be here right
[29:38] and remember Jesus said I have never I
[29:41] won't lose one right so we understand
[29:48] that even though
[29:50] tree bring forth alphabets from the same
[29:51] tree one Apple may be bigger than the
[29:54] other one Apple may be redder than the
[29:57] other one my Apple might be more round
[29:59] than the other but they all came from
[30:02] that tree why because God is a variety
[30:05] God loves a variety you understand me so
[30:09] I'm saying these things so you can
[30:11] understand because if you can understand
[30:13] that God is your father it will elevate
[30:16] you it would bring you to a place where
[30:19] God is no longer a stranger mmm and you
[30:23] look at these things you say what
[30:25] brother what are you trying to say where
[30:27] are you going with this our Father which
[30:29] art in heaven hallowed be thy name holy
[30:32] is thy name thy kingdom come thy will be
[30:35] done in earth not above earth not alone
[30:38] Earth but in you in you in earth as it
[30:42] is in heaven is that right because you
[30:45] got to realize that heaven was in Adam
[30:49] wherever God is is heaven so heaven was
[30:54] in Adam and what happened is when Adam
[30:56] sinned he lost heaven for the moment
[31:01] because Adam could never lose his
[31:04] sonship sin never law made us lose our
[31:08] sonship it only broke our relationship
[31:12] right you could never lose your sonship
[31:15] I don't care how bad what am i children
[31:18] how they may misbehave they can never I
[31:21] could never decide how can I say I can
[31:24] never disown them and and even though
[31:26] they made this own me but the blood
[31:29] tests showed that they are mine now I'm
[31:33] getting a little happy I'm trying to
[31:34] hear amen so you got to realize amen
[31:37] that's why it's important to get the
[31:40] Holy Ghost
[31:42] having this seal the Lord knoweth them
[31:46] that are his right only the seal of God
[31:50] will show you who you are
[31:54] hmm in other words if the man is that
[31:58] spanking the train he patched all those
[32:01] virtues in you and what virtue see
[32:03] putting in you his own it is Christ in
[32:08] you the hope of glory and once all of
[32:11] himself is placed in you he seals it and
[32:15] what does he steal the width Son of God
[32:20] read the package son of God
[32:23] daughter of God you understand me and
[32:24] that seal cannot be broken until it
[32:30] reaches destiny so we come from God and
[32:34] we go back to God oh you say brother
[32:38] books I don't see it let me say it like
[32:40] this Jeremiah I knew you
[32:43] Jeremiah was born a sinner but God said
[32:46] I knew you before the foundation of the
[32:49] world hallelujah and how can God know
[32:54] Jeremiah before the foundation the world
[32:57] called him to be a prophet if God did
[32:59] not know him and he didn't come from God
[33:04] he came from God Oh
[33:07] people say well I don't understand how
[33:09] Solomon can be saved
[33:12] I'll tell you how he can be saved he is
[33:15] saying why Solomon came from God the
[33:22] Lord justify who he will he forgives
[33:26] whom he will it's not by power is not by
[33:29] might but by my spirit saith the Lord
[33:32] Oh I'm coming to something in just a
[33:35] moment but we look at this thing and you
[33:38] know what I love God for you know what
[33:40] I'm just so loving for because he
[33:42] promised he's not like us we promised
[33:46] and somehow things going or get in the
[33:48] way and messes up the promise and we
[33:50] can't fulfill it but there is not one
[33:52] promise God has ever made mankind and
[33:55] didn't fulfill it if God has given you a
[33:59] promise you can rest on that promise
[34:01] that is going to be so I don't care what
[34:04] Satan tries to do the only thing that
[34:07] Satan can delete you or whip you with
[34:09] his unbelief is that right that's how he
[34:13] broke down by unbelief but if you
[34:16] believe
[34:17] amen if you believe his word hallelujah
[34:20] is like a wall of fire about you
[34:23] Satan K penetrate your faith hallelujah
[34:27] oh come on somebody when God said unto
[34:30] his disciples if you say to this
[34:33] mountain be thou move and believe in
[34:36] that heart it shall be moved what was he
[34:40] telling them it's like a man training
[34:44] his son where one you're part of me I
[34:51] know what you're capable of doing
[34:53] because I'm the one that created it all
[34:56] and if you say to this mountain
[34:58] understand you're a part of me and the
[35:00] part of me in you will make that
[35:03] mountain move he tried to teach them
[35:07] what it was to be esta poll a fall and
[35:13] son versus a restored son how Jesus was
[35:17] never fallen so he he he he was the
[35:21] example he was a picture-perfect person
[35:24] if I could say like that to show them
[35:26] what it was and what is supposed to be
[35:29] to be a restored son he didn't have to
[35:34] be restored he is
[35:37] but we've been fallen we needed to see
[35:41] the supernatural we needed to see what
[35:45] we were supposed to be can I use that
[35:47] word we needed to see what God was
[35:49] trying to evolve us into you need fish
[35:54] go for it you need money go for it huh
[36:02] because the power is in the tongue is
[36:05] that word the Bible said life and death

[48:03] forgive you and there are many so called
[48:04] Christians if I can say like wet like
[48:06] that wash it and say it that way but

[48:09] lost because they didn't have the
[48:12] ability to forgive let me tell you
[48:15] something the only way you can't forgive
[48:16] you must be elected and chosen by God to
[48:20] be to forgive is that right you say how
[48:23] beat that can be let me show you how
[48:25] deep it is
[48:26] Jesus spat in his face slapped him
[48:29] around call him the devil they did
[48:31] everything they could do to put
[48:33] bitterness in his heart
[48:34] but he was too saviour paulina he was
[48:38] full of the Holy Ghost hallelujah so God
[48:41] stepped back the Spirit of God stepped
[48:43] back and said okay son you got to take
[48:45] cavalry as a man hallelujah I'm with you

[48:50] hallelujah see he step out there because
[48:53] you know what Jesus had to become sin

[48:59] he was because he had to feel every pain
[49:05] he had to feel every blow he had to feel
[49:08] every word everything that was said to
[49:10] him he felt because of you and I but he
[49:14] had an obligation he had a purpose in
[49:17] life and he understood by the scripture
[49:20] he was the Lamb of God he was the one
[49:24] that was going to take this sin charge
[49:27] away from us hallelujah you said what do
[49:30] you mean I'm saying he understood we
[49:34] were family
[49:36] he understood Amy that right
[49:40] you've heard me say it many times when
[49:42] Jesus mother came to him say Lord your
[49:44] mother's here he said who is my mother
[49:46] who is my brother who is my sister but
[49:48] those who do my father's will hallelujah
[49:51] those are my people the real people are
[49:54] my people are those who are full of the
[49:56] Holy Ghost
[49:57] those are kind from the God family so
[50:03] are you so are you and when you God
[50:09] family let me tell you something you're
[50:12] like another Steven let him cast the
[50:14] stones let them hit him hit you in your
[50:15] face let him stone you to death but at
[50:18] the end of the day you said father hold
[50:20] not these things to their charge

[50:25] Brooks he was the same as his father his
[50:27] father said Father forgive them for they
[50:30] know not what they do if we're gonna see
[50:33] a powerful revival in this church
[50:35] we're gonna have to have l.o.v.e capital
[50:38] Devine that right and you not understand
[50:46] one thing for certain Amen that perfect
[50:49] love is based on forgiveness I'd love to
[50:53] say it - is that right because listen
[50:56] would Adam its wife sinned against him
[50:59] hallelujah do you ever see it in the
[51:02] scripture where she came up to Adam says
[51:03] I'm sorry there is no repentance there
[51:06] if it is is not written hallelujah
[51:10] but Adam so loved her his whole duty
[51:17] amen now is seen he was always a husband
[51:22] but now that his wife is sinned against
[51:25] him he could have said what in the world
[51:29] have you done I'm going to the proper
[51:31] and I'm gonna ever tell him to give me
[51:33] another one but he didn't he's so loved
[51:37] her you'll never see in the scripture
[51:40] what all Adam did before the fall
[51:46] hallelujah now we had a property came
[51:49] and told us some of the things
[51:50] Amen that Adam had the authority to do
[51:54] but it's nothing written and said Adam
[51:55] did this out of the debt so we don't
[51:57] know can you imagine
[51:59] amen are you hearing every day oh I love
[52:02] you I love you I love you I love you now
[52:06] how you know that you don't never know
[52:09] you'll never know how much a person
[52:12] loves you until they offend you when
[52:16] they do something wrong contrary to you
[52:19] you'll know how much you love them huh
[52:25] because the love is long-suffering love
[52:30] covers a multitude of seeing God now I'm
[52:35] not talking about this a filial love
[52:37] that akil's about it because he's
[52:38] jealous I'm done my devala the Bible
[52:42] said in that while we were yet sinners
[52:44] Christ died for us in then while he was
[52:47] a sinner Adam died for her he could save
[52:53] us but he couldn't redeem her
[52:56] yeah even I'm seen y'all getting quiet
[52:59] of me I'd never did it Eve oh there was
[53:06] no repentance at that time Adam come see
[53:10] what I did and she persuaded him to do
[53:17] the very same act and so now they all
[53:20] caught the same attitude when God walks
[53:23] in the cool of the evening you took my
[53:26] one flesh in one spirit is that right
[53:30] she said Lord the circle Adam said Lord
[53:33] the woman you gave me
[53:35] she said Lord the serpent you gave me
[53:37] not one of them stood there says Father
[53:40] forgive me but what did God do he jumped
[53:48] to the jump if I could sit with he went
[53:50] immediately to the restoration he went
[53:55] immediately to restore them to cover
[53:59] them to protect them because he was a
[54:02] father our Father
[54:06] you understand me in the midst of all
[54:09] our wickedness God could catch us in the
[54:13] act if he really wanted to send you to
[54:16] hell he could take your life right then
[54:22] there are those who were right in the
[54:24] act with just their mouth declaring
[54:26] there was something like a God and God
[54:28] struck him dead right then worms eat
[54:32] them hmm but still his patience and love
[54:36] suffering is with his children whoo
[54:40] listen when seaweed not only that but
[54:45] you see our soul is a part of God that's
[54:48] the real you your soul is a part of God
[54:52] is that right and even in our fallen
[54:56] state yet it's the most great species of
[54:59] all species on earth is the man and then
[55:03] get him to connect with his maker
[55:05] he becomes a super man is that right oh
[55:10] we don't see that hallelujah but
[55:13] Hollywood knows that there really are
[55:14] Superman hallelujah they try to
[55:18] scientific find or demonize it or
[55:21] whatever the case may be but even
[55:23] mankind know we're supposed to be
[55:25] something greater than what we are
[55:29] hallelujah it's evident just you know
[55:32] the intellectual side of it
[55:34] amen how many ah scientists in our day
[55:37] can build a pyramid how many of them can
[55:40] make dyes that'll last for thousands of
[55:43] years nobody yet
[55:46] they say we're more intelligent and they
[55:48] were it's a lie I'd ever from a lot from
[55:52] hell is what it is those people were
[55:54] eight if you had to go see the pyramid
[55:56] in order to see the entire state
[56:01] building it and whatever was that little
[56:03] building a time put up there that looked
[56:05] like a little child's play tons because
[56:09] those tons every mile or so high well in
[56:13] the world
[56:14] y'all understand understand what I'm
[56:16] trying to say but understand what I'm
[56:18] saying I'm saying this
[56:20] how can you think your problem is so big
[56:24] that God cannot solve if I hell does
[56:31] this this bottleless is like to me give
[56:36] me some time with this though if I held
[56:39] this thing out for a long period of time
[56:41] at the Wow that which is likely comes
[56:43] heavy and begins to drop right but the
[56:50] moon the Stars the earth the Sun has
[56:55] been held in its place since the
[56:58] beginning of time way before then God
[57:01] has held it and not one thing has moved
[57:04] out of his place you understand me why
[57:07] cuz God can't get weak he's Almighty
[57:11] hello he's Almighty and if God can hold
[57:15] the Stars and the moon in place you
[57:16] think God can't fix it for you I'm
[57:19] trying to help your faith you gotta
[57:21] broaden your mind when it comes to God
[57:22] you were God to be strapped up into the
[57:25] little brain here it ain't gonna work
[57:27] hallelujah God is far bigger than your
[57:30] brain he's your father
[57:34] I call him a mastermind ah because these
[57:39] things that he's formed they declaring
[57:41] him the declaring his power declaring
[57:44] hallelujah you'll watch me get behind
[57:46] time but that Sun is gonna rise
[57:48] tick-tock ha you and I we're beautiful
[57:57] people you might not think so cuz you're
[58:01] not looking at the real me
[58:02] but we're beautiful people in the inside
[58:07] of us it's the greatest and the most
[58:10] beautiful thing ever and that's gone
[58:13] that's why it's important for us to
[58:16] dodge our own will in our own way
[58:23] if God
[58:25] Adam before the fall you know God can
[58:27] lead lit it can lead Adam after the fall
[58:30] all right
[58:31] I think one of the greatest men ever
[58:33] lived was Abraham and Abraham was a
[58:35] common man just like you and I was
[58:37] nothing special about Abraham but
[58:39] election God chose him he lived in a
[58:43] time and a day Amen that they were idol
[58:45] worshipers but only inside of Abraham
[58:49] was a seed term of God hallelujah you
[58:53] see what I'm saying that's why God don't
[58:55] care whether you're let me put his way I
[58:58] don't know how to say it I said God
[58:59] don't care but let me just say it in
[59:01] this manner there are those who have
[59:03] been prostitutes there have been doors
[59:05] who have been mongers and pervert
[59:06] us and all kinds of things and yet on
[59:09] the inside there's a seed gene of God
[59:12] and God looks at the seed and some point
[59:20] God will visit you like he did Jericho
[59:24] hallelujah Here I am locked up in the
[59:27] city and then don't even belong to
[59:29] Israel but God says she's a part of it
[59:32] is that right
[59:34] and God why took a harlot oh well no not
[59:40] only that God restore her to her
[59:43] position in a natural way because she
[59:45] belonged to the royal family I love this
[59:49] but when God told down the walls of
[59:52] Jericho he restored all the evidence
[59:54] that they haven't ever been a harlot if
[59:57] the Scriptures had not said it we would
[59:59] have never known it hallelujah
[1:00:01] but I want you to look that's what the
[1:00:03] blood does when the blood of Jesus
[1:00:06] strikes you when it rose a walk for you
[1:00:08] and then it kills and it's how all of
[1:00:10] your past not some of it all of it and
[1:00:14] you walk away from Jericho like a new
[1:00:17] creature in Christ
[1:00:21] mm-hmm we have no abilities of our own
[1:00:25] we can't impress God the greatest
[1:00:29] singers in the world whether it be
[1:00:31] gospel or whatever the case may be
[1:00:32] you can't impress God let me tell y'all
[1:00:34] something we don't really know what
[1:00:36] singing is until we get to heaven
[1:00:38] perfect pitch and all that stuff being
[1:00:41] able to sing without catching a breath
[1:00:46] [Laughter]
[1:00:48] never never weaning from it we know we
[1:00:52] don't do that is and when someone say
[1:00:58] you sing like an angel that's a real
[1:00:59] compliment y'all understand me
[1:01:03] see there's no abilities of our own you
[1:01:05] know it's even a preacher you know we
[1:01:08] think oh my god is that just just - I'm
[1:01:10] gonna tear it up just do it but you're
[1:01:12] not doing nothing when it comes to men -
[1:01:15] preaching preaching is not acting though
[1:01:18] a preacher may act you understand me but
[1:01:22] my point is if God ain't doing it it's
[1:01:24] all in vain hallelujah and at the end of
[1:01:29] the day no matter what he does how he
[1:01:31] raises his voice and I'm talking about
[1:01:33] myself
[1:01:33] that's not what God is in God is in his
[1:01:36] word I want to hear what he's saying we
[1:01:42] all love the emotional part but let me
[1:01:45] tell you something people that's not
[1:01:47] what you ought to follow you need to
[1:01:49] follow what's being said and if it's the
[1:01:52] Word of God that's what you follow your
[1:01:55] understanding amen you look at these
[1:01:57] things in you sometimes people than what
[1:01:58] I am so smart let me tell you like this
[1:02:03] that's what Moses taught I can deliver
[1:02:05] the children in Israel I'm gonna go down
[1:02:07] there and I'm a set that Egyptian
[1:02:09] straight and whenever you know because
[1:02:11] somebody done told me I'm gonna be the
[1:02:13] deliverer and I believe it they men so
[1:02:14] I'm a little put it in order and what do
[1:02:16] you know with a dead man every time you
[1:02:19] try to help God you end up with a dead
[1:02:22] man and guess who the dead man becomes
[1:02:23] you hello Moses now the dead man
[1:02:31] represents Mose you say what do you mean
[1:02:33] because from that day on Moses became a
[1:02:36] vagabond a fugitive of Egypt he was no
[1:02:39] long longer this great royal family and
[1:02:42] that's what that's what happens to you
[1:02:44] when you get in God's way you stumble
[1:02:46] and fall even though he was to be the
[1:02:50] deliverer he was opposed to wait
[1:02:52] god is that right but God will always
[1:02:56] turn that evil around for good
[1:02:59] why because on God's calendar
[1:03:02] he had a conference call he had a call
[1:03:05] for Moses that Moses wasn't there yet
[1:03:07] y'all understand me so God had a Egypt
[1:03:10] to kick Moses out so Moses could make
[1:03:12] the journey to the Sinai and when he got
[1:03:17] there God was waiting hmm you see a lot
[1:03:21] of time we are it will us it into places
[1:03:23] and us and into journeys we don't even
[1:03:26] know where we're going but God knows and
[1:03:30] at the end of the journey guess what I
[1:03:32] don't care how far he is how long it
[1:03:35] takes amen as long as at the end of the
[1:03:37] journey I meet God am i making sense he
[1:03:42] said well what do you mean I'm saying
[1:03:43] like Jacob Jacob was a thief he was shot
[1:03:47] is that right and you look in the
[1:03:50] scripture says that when he cheats his
[1:03:54] brother out of this birthright and you
[1:03:56] know he goes over there to his future
[1:03:59] father-in-law and he cheats his
[1:04:01] father-in-law and God blesses him an
[1:04:02] angel came and told Jacob how to treat
[1:04:05] how to trick his father-in-law I don't
[1:04:08] understand it but what I'm trying to
[1:04:12] tell you when you are a seed of God
[1:04:14] you're blessed you may not recognize it
[1:04:18] at the time that you are seat of God but
[1:04:21] when God sees you he sees himself he'll
[1:04:26] bless you in Egypt he'll bless you
[1:04:28] wherever you are
[1:04:29] amen because you are here he will
[1:04:33] protect her come on somebody you and I
[1:04:36] know I know I know I should have been
[1:04:39] dead the many times Satan tried to kill
[1:04:42] me
[1:04:43] but he couldn't because I didn't belong
[1:04:47] to him Satan is the one who kills his
[1:04:50] children and God saves his own his own
[1:04:53] hallelujah oh you said all those souls
[1:04:57] in hell it would have never been that
[1:05:00] way if Lucifer hadn't done what he did
[1:05:05] that right god kicks who out Lucifer and
[1:05:10] all of those angels that God created
[1:05:14] that followed Lucifer was ordained to do
[1:05:16] it
[1:05:18] hallelujah because they were created he
[1:05:21] never was a part in the beginning that's
[1:05:24] why Paul says unto us
[1:05:26] I think this Paul he said listen if they
[1:05:28] leave you they weren't part of you now
[1:05:31] people think round if they leave my
[1:05:33] church God ain't talking about no
[1:05:34] denominational Church God talk about if
[1:05:36] they lead the word you stay with the
[1:05:40] word but it didn't lead the word they
[1:05:43] never was a part of the word whatever
[1:05:47] people you did for their similar dive
[1:05:49] ain't got nothing to do with your
[1:05:50] stimuli even though it may occur in your
[1:05:53] simile Paul there's a little more deeper
[1:05:55] than that and he probably referring back
[1:05:58] to Lucifer is that right you sure what
[1:06:02] do you mean brother did not the Bible
[1:06:04] tells us in the book of Revelation come
[1:06:06] out of her my people and be not
[1:06:07] partakers of her sins so daddy can't be
[1:06:10] talking about leaving a church building
[1:06:11] my church system because he's calling
[1:06:13] you out of that he's leaving God mmm
[1:06:19] help me Jesus y'all understand me the
[1:06:22] only way that we can destroy Satan's
[1:06:24] working us is to render unto God a
[1:06:27] complete surrender that's the only thing
[1:06:33] that can destroy the works in the devil
[1:06:35] it was like Christ came in and I'm not
[1:06:38] gonna be long tonight but it was like
[1:06:39] Christ he was facing the greatest thing
[1:06:41] of his life and you know he had to be
[1:06:44] the lamb he can't open his mouth he had
[1:06:46] to keep his shot a man he had to he knew
[1:06:48] the pain he was gonna experience pain
[1:06:50] that was beyond anything ever I felt on
[1:06:53] the day of her own desert why coz
[1:06:55] thinking about the millions and
[1:06:57] trillions in part whatever you got it I
[1:06:59] don't know how many how many the young
[1:07:01] tree is I don't know but anyway that was
[1:07:08] to come that he had to die for and to
[1:07:14] think
[1:07:15] he felt all those blows for us those
[1:07:21] strikes and bruises were our sins the
[1:07:26] judgment of God being afflicted upon him
[1:07:29] think about that and he knew it and yet
[1:07:33] he the Bible said with joy he said his
[1:07:36] plane face like a flint ha because he
[1:07:39] knew the outcome he understood that was
[1:07:42] going to be a nation born without sex
[1:07:45] there was going to be a nation of people
[1:07:48] a special class of people that will come
[1:07:51] through his loins and when the devil
[1:07:57] Pierce him in his side who came out of
[1:07:59] his loins blood and water which was a
[1:08:02] type it meant of the bride of Jesus
[1:08:03] Christ hallelujah and the devil sent in
[1:08:07] the book of song who shall declare his
[1:08:10] generation
[1:08:14] who's gonna clear his G who's gonna
[1:08:17] declare his seed here we are Lord when
[1:08:22] the devil thought he had Jesus come to a
[1:08:24] stop hallelujah it was only just the
[1:08:27] beginning whew we almost happy in now
[1:08:34] the houses and thousands and thousands
[1:08:37] of children has come out of Christ who
[1:08:42] sits on the throne of God Jesus Christ
[1:08:45] and who sits on the throne of Christ the
[1:08:47] bride of Jesus Christ and as Jesus came
[1:08:50] out of God we came out of her eyes I was
[1:09:00] thinking about this the other day
[1:09:01] brother rich amen jesus said if you if
[1:09:03] you fable into little I would give you
[1:09:05] 10 cities cities and he doesn't even say
[1:09:10] how big the cities gonna be but let's
[1:09:13] supposing is just that in a natural
[1:09:15] that's wonderful too but think about if
[1:09:18] he gives me ten cities one two three
[1:09:21] four y'all understand me I'm counting so
[1:09:24] I gotta stop cuz we got more than ten in
[1:09:26] here
[1:09:27] but my point is that's like having a
[1:09:30] tree and each one of you is a universe
[1:09:35] and your soul is worth more 10,000
[1:09:40] world's infant infinity is what it is
[1:09:44] because I will never stop existing
[1:09:50] hallelujah
[1:09:51] you know I don't know how to try to say
[1:09:55] what I'm saying but I'm gonna tell you
[1:09:57] something this thing is so great that
[1:09:59] when God you know you gotta be
[1:10:01] something's got to be wrong with you if
[1:10:03] you think that God created the earth and
[1:10:05] the earth only for habitation anybody
[1:10:13] seen heaven
[1:10:16] there's plenty up here and then
[1:10:19] happening heaven worlds and stars and
[1:10:29] Suns and moons and do you think God is
[1:10:32] doing all of that to be vain eyes have
[1:10:39] not seen nor ears heard God gives you
[1:10:43] the ability to create and you don't even
[1:10:45] use it
[1:10:48] hallelujah
[1:10:49] what is he giving you the ability to
[1:10:51] create form there's no creation after
[1:10:53] this oh I don't know let me say it like
[1:10:56] this the Bible said that God rested on
[1:10:59] the seventh day right he rested and the
[1:11:05] Bible said Joshua didn't fulfill that
[1:11:07] that day but there's coming another rest
[1:11:10] and what was that rest the Holy Ghost
[1:11:18] when you enter
[1:11:20] to the Holy Ghost you have now entered
[1:11:22] into your promised land am I making
[1:11:28] sense
[1:11:28] and what is your promised land Oh amen
[1:11:33] we realized that God said to Abraham I
[1:11:35] am your portion I'm not the screen
[1:11:41] brother I'm uh
[1:11:42] I am your portion I'm gonna give this a
[1:11:45] portion him a portion him up this one
[1:11:47] this preacher portion this preacher
[1:11:49] portion I give this preach preacher
[1:11:51] portion but don't you worry about what
[1:11:53] I've given you them
[1:11:55] I am your portion Oh somebody help me
[1:11:58] here
[1:11:59] oh thank about it if God says I am your
[1:12:02] portion somebody gonna have to scrape me
[1:12:04] off the floor I just fainted because
[1:12:08] I've just not been given the greatest
[1:12:11] thing ever and that's eternal life can
[1:12:16] you imagine and this is just a small
[1:12:18] teeny little piece of God that we see
[1:12:20] now how God good good God has been you
[1:12:22] have no idea what's awaiting you and the
[1:12:28] thing forever I'm gonna be with him
[1:12:30] eternally there's no dying no crying you
[1:12:33] can't you can't these are the bird
[1:12:34] brains that we have we came fathom what
[1:12:36] it is and you think that I'm gonna trade
[1:12:39] this for anything of this world
[1:12:42] hallelujah you see what do you see I'm
[1:12:45] seeing like like like Satan has Satan
[1:12:48] has his fashion Satan what they wear in
[1:12:51] hell is not what they wear in heaven
[1:12:56] that's why everybody's naked because
[1:12:59] they make it in hell hello you don't
[1:13:04] carry nothing you know you don't see God
[1:13:06] said well when you get to hell God Satan
[1:13:08] is gonna robe you with something you
[1:13:09] ain't got nothing naked you came into
[1:13:13] the world and they could you leave out
[1:13:15] only the believer is clothed with the
[1:13:18] character of Christ and because he's
[1:13:21] clothed with Christ he has a clothing -
[1:13:23] that's waiting on him yeah I remember
[1:13:28] now this whole thing started with being
[1:13:30] clothed and unclothed
[1:13:34] we were clothes and Satan unclothed them
[1:13:37] and what is he doing now he's still
[1:13:40] unclosing them but those who are in
[1:13:43] Christ keep themselves clothed you love
[1:13:49] the Lord he meant that in the
[1:13:51] dispensation of the fullness of time he
[1:13:53] might gather together in one all things
[1:13:55] in Christ both which are in heaven and
[1:13:57] which are on earth even where in him
[1:14:01] back to the point we must be in him
[1:14:04] hallelujah for whom he did foreknow he
[1:14:07] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[1:14:10] the image of his son that he might be
[1:14:12] the firstborn among many what brethren
[1:14:15] you mean to tell me that Jesus is my
[1:14:18] brother and if he is my brother
[1:14:20] that means his daddy is mine you can't
[1:14:24] have two daddies you don't understand
[1:14:30] that the Godhead is so important because
[1:14:33] they want to make three cards there is
[1:14:34] no three gods may God hear when they say
[1:14:38] it just like you you got body soul and
[1:14:40] spirit hello but you'll never see me
[1:14:43] saying how you doing body body says
[1:14:45] though I'm doing okay and then what
[1:14:46] about two spirits Oh soul I didn't mean
[1:14:49] to forget you you know what they gonna
[1:14:55] take you and lock you up somewhere cuz
[1:14:57] you schizophrenic hallelujah but they
[1:15:02] say well who would Jesus got talking to
[1:15:05] and they don't understand John was the
[1:15:07] only one that saw the vision you know
[1:15:10] after all those people would have saw
[1:15:11] that dub coming down and saying this is
[1:15:14] my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased
[1:15:15] they would have fell down and worship or
[1:15:17] fainted but John was only one they'd
[1:15:20] seen it and they must understand that
[1:15:22] was a vision descending like a door like
[1:15:33] mmm and people don't understand that was
[1:15:36] truly the voice of God ah because Jesus
[1:15:39] was only the house of God like you are
[1:15:41] the house of God but he was born without
[1:15:45] sex
[1:15:47] about making sense all right I'm trying
[1:15:50] to hurry I'm trying to hurry you and I
[1:15:52] must understand by God's grace the only
[1:15:54] thing listen it takes a full surrendered
[1:15:57] heart to Jesus Christ no matter how he
[1:16:00] literally you are though a fool will not
[1:16:02] err in that way see so listen to listen
[1:16:05] closer now as you know what was not
[1:16:08] Abraham our Father justified by works
[1:16:11] when he had offered Isaac his son upon
[1:16:13] the altar right but you got to
[1:16:16] understand that the Bible says Abraham
[1:16:18] was justified by faith hallelujah the
[1:16:21] Bible said if you believe in your heart
[1:16:22] and confess with your mouth that Jesus
[1:16:24] Christ is the son of God you are saying
[1:16:26] how many I believe that a man you can't
[1:16:30] take that out of the world at that
[1:16:32] moment they're justified in their passed
[1:16:35] from death unto life the problem with us
[1:16:39] is that when God shows us more opening
[1:16:42] of the world if you fail to walk in it
[1:16:45] that's when death strikes you now right
[1:16:51] oh yeah the children of Israel came
[1:16:53] right out of out of Egypt amen and it
[1:16:55] was justified they escaped the Death
[1:16:57] Angel when they were in Egypt but when
[1:17:00] they got in the wilderness when it came
[1:17:02] to sanctification they did not they
[1:17:04] failed and because of that they died is
[1:17:08] that right Jesus said they are all dead
[1:17:11] right my our fathers did eat manna in
[1:17:15] the wilderness and Jesus said they're
[1:17:17] all dead go look it up
[1:17:18] that means eternally separated from God
[1:17:21] and that's what people said well we
[1:17:23] ain't got to look like that we ain't got
[1:17:24] to be sanctified yes you do if you're
[1:17:27] gonna go all the way to the fault the
[1:17:28] next stage and that's didn't feel
[1:17:30] complete with the Holy Spirit because
[1:17:32] God cannot put his spirit in it unclean
[1:17:34] vessel he won't do it I'm going on you
[1:17:38] love the Lord come on somebody you and I
[1:17:41] must understand that we are the General
[1:17:43] Assembly the Church of the firstborn
[1:17:45] right which are written in heaven huh
[1:17:49] your names are written in heaven you say
[1:17:53] brother please how could my name be
[1:17:55] written in heaven God put your name on
[1:17:56] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:17:59] foundation of the world
[1:18:01] what do you mean was I there you were
[1:18:03] there when God said let there be light
[1:18:06] you were there you said that in
[1:18:09] Scripture yes it is the Bible said Levi
[1:18:11] paid tithes in Abraham where was Levi in
[1:18:14] Abraham two more generations down huh so
[1:18:23] what are you saying I was in God that's
[1:18:26] why I can return back to him hallelujah
[1:18:29] and by God he listen there's a part of
[1:18:34] me that's created this old flesh but
[1:18:36] when I get the Holy Ghost that's what I
[1:18:37] had with that's what I had with him
[1:18:41] before I became this Oh God give me the
[1:18:47] seal I had the seal sheets in broke the
[1:18:51] connection hallelujah Oh amen sin was
[1:18:56] the one that made us what we are but God
[1:18:59] said in the beginning there was a sore
[1:19:01] sowing seeds hallelujah there was a good
[1:19:04] so uh he put one in my heart he put what
[1:19:08] all of his children had his seed before
[1:19:13] they got here and the preaching of the
[1:19:16] word is like the blood cell breaking
[1:19:21] through the egg and causes life in you
[1:19:26] now when you hear the gospel you confess
[1:19:29] with your mouth believe in your heart
[1:19:30] now you have been been been conceived
[1:19:34] hallelujah
[1:19:35] you're not quite formed yet but your
[1:19:39] life in Christ is that right amen now
[1:19:43] you're forming up you're forming up your
[1:19:45] formula whatever tell you something you
[1:19:47] don't become a real baby
[1:19:48] Amen until you get Christ gives you full
[1:19:52] birth by blood water and spirit that
[1:19:56] were John said and these three agree in
[1:19:59] one you gotta have blood water
[1:20:02] experience justification safe occasion
[1:20:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost right and so
[1:20:07] when you come out hallelujah because all
[1:20:09] that that nine months you lived off your
[1:20:12] mama's life that right
[1:20:15] that's what we do we come in and we live
[1:20:17] off the church life hallelujah
[1:20:20] but that neighbor cord got to be cut so
[1:20:23] we can take our own breath so you gotta
[1:20:30] understand by God's grace that when you
[1:20:32] take your own breath that's why people
[1:20:35] must understand I can't own you know
[1:20:38] church can on you know preacher can on

[1:21:25] maker is your husband how can it be your
[1:21:27] husband lets you be like Eve on the
[1:21:29] inside of him Oh a man is that Ryan II
[1:21:34] was only inside an atom when she came to
[1:21:36] manifestation she was his why the Lord
[1:21:39] of Hosts is his name what that mean he
[1:21:43] had a lot of like Solomon plenty right
[1:21:48] and I Redeemer the Holy One of Israel
[1:21:51] the god of the whole earth shall he be
[1:21:54] called for the Lord have called me as a
[1:21:57] woman Forsaken and grieved in spirit and
[1:21:59] a wife of youth when thou was refused
[1:22:01] said their Lord in a small moment I have
[1:22:04] forsaken thee but we're great with great
[1:22:06] mercies will I gather thee is that right
[1:22:09] you said brother looks at it you know
[1:22:11] what I had done read this Bible many a
[1:22:12] time but one day my wife and I was at a
[1:22:14] gas station and this man came up to me
[1:22:16] with prophecy and he gave me that
[1:22:19] scripted that was one of them that he
[1:22:20] gave me and saying God told me to give
[1:22:23] this scripture to you well why was with
[1:22:28] me hmm
[1:22:34] what was the other one brother now there
[1:22:36] 57 no weapons formed against you shall
[1:22:39] prosper
[1:22:40] no oh brother that's core is it in a is
[1:22:45] a good core isn't it I'm already I'm
[1:22:48] about ready to close what am i trying to
[1:22:50] tell you I'm trying to tell you that
[1:22:52] listen I heard that brother Torah
[1:22:57] preached some good messages and every
[1:23:02] one of us ought to be stirred enough to
[1:23:03] prove him wrong I don't even know what
[1:23:10] he preached but I heard it was a hot one
[1:23:13] oh thank God told us I'm glad I wasn't
[1:23:16] there I was just kidding my point is
[1:23:19] this your success
[1:23:25] in becoming a true son or daughter of
[1:23:28] God is hindered upon your faith to
[1:23:34] believe which you come from if Satan can
[1:23:38] cause you to doubt and disbelieve that
[1:23:41] you came from God he's definitely proven
[1:23:46] to you you're thinking like him because
[1:23:51] even though God was the creator of all
[1:23:53] things Satan thought he was on his own
[1:23:55] God he had his own origin so therefore
[1:24:00] he could do what he wanted wanted to do
[1:24:02] but for us who know we I don't know
[1:24:06] about you I I depend on him I'm not
[1:24:10] seeking something else other than
[1:24:13] eternal life that's all I want I didn't
[1:24:16] give myself a thirst for eternal life I
[1:24:18] didn't give myself to know God
[1:24:20] hallelujah and you and I ought to be so
[1:24:23] we ought to see how blessed we are that
[1:24:26] God didn't allow us to be worshipping
[1:24:28] Buddha or Allah he brought us into truth
[1:24:33] and this truth is vindicated by his old
[1:24:37] life hallelujah we're not sitting around
[1:24:41] kissing statue feet and all this kind of
[1:24:44] stuff we are serving a living God and I
[1:24:48] so thank God I don't understand it other
[1:24:50] than he knows my name he knew me before
[1:24:54] I knew me hallelujah and he chose us
[1:25:00] what I was saying in understanding what
[1:25:03] I was saying with brother
[1:25:04] when I say prove him wrong because God
[1:25:06] gave him the words to speak and if God
[1:25:09] gave him words of correction we must
[1:25:12] love the correction hallelujah because
[1:25:18] let me say like this every true seed of
[1:25:21] God
[1:25:21] will correct themselves how do you
[1:25:29] yourself brother book repentance that's
[1:25:33] all you can do
[1:25:33] God I'm wrong you're right and in
[1:25:37] closing I'm saying this when God is
[1:25:40] right and you acknowledge he's right
[1:25:42] he was then direct your path like I said
[1:25:45] down there the church I said how can you
[1:25:47] die anybody know how to you die how do
[1:25:49] you die tell me is there an instruction
[1:25:51] book to tell you how to die but God said
[1:25:57] we must you must die you must rock to
[1:26:00] yourself rock to your ideas rot rot rot
[1:26:04] because every seed before it could ever
[1:26:07] bring forth life it must die and rot go
[1:26:11] dig it up in the Nile you find out that
[1:26:12] every seed that's planted because you
[1:26:15] don't even you can't even see the life
[1:26:16] that's in the seed until it manifests
[1:26:19] itself after you rock and that's what it
[1:26:25] is we got to die to ourselves down to
[1:26:27] our wheel die to our habits and so a
[1:26:30] Lord how do I do it I tell you where you
[1:26:32] first start prayer Jesus as a man said
[1:26:38] father I would that you this copy pass
[1:26:40] away from me nevertheless not my will
[1:26:45] our Father that will be done in earth
[1:26:48] nevertheless not my will and he kept
[1:26:52] praying he kept praying he kept praying
[1:26:55] he got up one time he says could not
[1:26:57] y'all stay with me for an hour god
[1:27:00] what's happening with you don't you know
[1:27:01] the pressure and the squeeze is on and
[1:27:03] y'all over here sleeping when y'all to
[1:27:05] be praying with me and then at the while
[1:27:07] he come back a second time it says sleep
[1:27:10] on because now the consequences of your
[1:27:13] not praying will now be made manifest
[1:27:16] and then when they came when the
[1:27:19] soldiers came guess what instead of them
[1:27:21] staying with Jesus they all scatter the
[1:27:23] only person that stayed with Jesus was
[1:27:25] John and John was the type of the bride
[1:27:27] hallelujah help me Jesus so you and I
[1:27:31] realize amen hmm we're being born of
[1:27:37] uncorruptible seed born of God is to be
[1:27:39] born of uncorruptible that means it
[1:27:41] cannot be
[1:27:42] rubbed it through the world or do the
[1:27:44] things that Satan put on you
[1:27:45] it cannot be corrupted hallelujah
[1:27:49] it can't be habbit eyes you can't mix
[1:27:52] you with nothing faith cannot be mixed
[1:27:54] with anything not real faith I'm jumping
[1:27:59] job said in 35 35 10 but none said where
[1:28:03] is God my maker who give his song
[1:28:07] anybody know what I'm talking about how
[1:28:09] many times they've been you've been so
[1:28:11] down and God comes and only starts
[1:28:13] singing all over him to you and you
[1:28:21] don't even want to sing that song
[1:28:22] because you're saying I don't feel
[1:28:24] nearer and God is trying to say but
[1:28:26] that's what I'm saying it so you can get
[1:28:27] nearer listened gotta make your radio
[1:28:35] you hear sounds from heaven and you
[1:28:38] think it's coming from your mind it's
[1:28:40] coming in your mind I don't mean to
[1:28:45] laugh I'm serious folks you know it is
[1:28:47] true it's so true we we miss God by what
[1:28:51] we miss God we do too much process one
[1:28:58] thing I learned about my mom you don't
[1:28:59] hurt her heard me talk about her my mama
[1:29:03] didn't have enough education she didn't
[1:29:04] even know how to reason I'm sure she did
[1:29:07] but she probably didn't know that's what
[1:29:08] she was doing
[1:29:09] my point is she just knew whatever I
[1:29:13] heard the preacher say I believe it the
[1:29:16] Holy Ghost in church no matter had to
[1:29:19] beat her up she heard the word her faith
[1:29:24] call the whole of it and God filled her
[1:29:26] right there in a Baptist Church God
[1:29:32] don't care where you get the Holy Ghost
[1:29:34] as long as the temperatures right but
[1:29:40] don't you think no air gonna hatch if
[1:29:42] the church is dead and cold hallelujah
[1:29:45] that's why I scream out all the time
[1:29:47] about having this temperature right in
[1:29:48] this church we got young people that's
[1:29:50] coming up and they gonna need the Holy
[1:29:51] Ghost if they tear it God tarry long
[1:29:53] enough hey Church the you know you
[1:29:55] can't be a Frigidaire that's what people
[1:29:58] say the Church of the Frigidaire up I
[1:29:59] don't want this church to be like that
[1:30:01] or the Church of the frozen Chosin no

[1:30:12] children gotta learn how to love God and
[1:30:14] if they don't see you loving them how
[1:30:16] you love God coz they learning through
[1:30:20] us y'all understand me somebody is
[1:30:25] always watching you oh wait I'm almost
[1:30:34] done I'm just gonna cut it short whereas
[1:30:38] not sure but whoever cut it I get really
[1:30:42] I don't mean this sound playfully to put
[1:30:45] it I'm just happy all I can tell you I
[1:30:51] do think about my salvation I don't
[1:30:56] worry if I'm saved or not that's not
[1:30:58] when I worry about I I want to hear well
[1:31:01] done you understand me I want to hear
[1:31:06] well done and I don't mean no harm
[1:31:09] I don't want to be one that called oh I
[1:31:12] barely made it I don't want to be a bear
[1:31:14] to make it you understand me the Bible
[1:31:19] said we're going to have reward there be
[1:31:20] some rewards that works that'll be burnt
[1:31:23] and all that I don't want my work to be
[1:31:25] burned everything I do I want to do it
[1:31:29] for Christ I don't want to be somewhere
[1:31:33] well I think I can do something I think
[1:31:35] I can help him no sir that's exactly
[1:31:38] what that man did when he grabbed that
[1:31:40] Ark he thought he could help David and
[1:31:42] he had no business grabbing the ark I
[1:31:45] don't care if it was falling that wasn't
[1:31:48] his position the Word of God said don't
[1:31:49] touch it and that's what God means don't
[1:31:51] touch it and you and I must understand
[1:31:57] him and the best thing we can do is to
[1:32:00] get on our knees somewhere somehow and
[1:32:03] pray to God take you to the next level
[1:32:08] he
[1:32:09] waiting on us he said well it's so
[1:32:12] difficult do you think at this day at a
[1:32:15] time
[1:32:16] the devil is gonna make it easy for you
[1:32:18] well brother books I just get so tired I
[1:32:20] get so sleepy and I get this net any
[1:32:22] other that's just a sign that you've got
[1:32:26] a devil working on the outside on the
[1:32:27] other side of you trying to keep you
[1:32:29] from your goal hallelujah sometimes you
[1:32:33] don't even know where else to say
[1:32:35] but just say Jesus he knows what's in
[1:32:39] your heart
[1:32:40] you don't know where to say like them
[1:32:42] like the men say if you don't know how
[1:32:44] to pray just pray
[1:32:45] abcdefg and God to know exactly what
[1:32:48] you're talking about
[1:32:51] he's God but we gotta persevere people
[1:32:57] I'm telling you it's true I'm not just
[1:32:59] talking to you or above you I'm saying
[1:33:01] this man gotta pray more I didn't
[1:33:07] already spoke to my heart and he's
[1:33:09] speaking to yours you want to see the
[1:33:11] supernatural occur you want to see that
[1:33:14] little room come to pass in your life
[1:33:16] where me and comes in there amen and
[1:33:19] walk out hold lame and blind and halt
[1:33:22] and what is going to happen that's
[1:33:23] people people don't understand anything
[1:33:25] or some great man is gonna raise up the
[1:33:27] greater man then calming down right now
[1:33:30] God is trying to get the people in their
[1:33:32] closet he alone will make this move
[1:33:36] there won't be another see more or
[1:33:38] something you know one of the seven
[1:33:41] angels are finished now we're now with
[1:33:45] Joshua
[1:33:46] we're with the pillar fire we're with
[1:33:49] God himself he's the one that's gonna
[1:33:52] make the next move oh lord help us Jesus
[1:33:56] and you and I know the Bible said
[1:33:59] whatever if you pray in a clowder you
[1:34:00] pray and secretly God will manifest
[1:34:03] himself so others can see I believe that
[1:34:08] with all my heart but you and I know
[1:34:12] most of us prayer Satan hates it and
[1:34:17] he's going to do everything he can you
[1:34:21] know what he works with
[1:34:23] feeling who said you had to feel them do
[1:34:27] y'all feel me I'm talking you do you
[1:34:33] feel the anointing y'all understand what
[1:34:36] I'm trying to say I'm talking to you but

[1:34:42] want to do
[1:34:43] let me hear him when I speak I won't
[1:34:46] even speak back whether I feel anything
[1:34:49] or not I want to know he's dead
[1:34:51] it ain't based upon feeling that's
[1:34:53] pillow costume and where we're supposed
[1:34:56] to be good beyond the childishness of
[1:34:59] that now like there's something wrong
[1:35:07] with it because we're Pentecostal but we
[1:35:09] supposed to be a mature Pentecostal and
[1:35:11] I'm not talking about a church
[1:35:13] denomination I'm talking about way of
[1:35:14] experience
[1:35:16] you can't get to heaven without a Holy
[1:35:18] Ghost experience right you love the Lord
[1:35:22] let's stand I wanna I really want to
[1:35:25] preach more on this our Father because
[1:35:28] we need to know who our Father is
[1:35:34] Alleluia once you know more about your
[1:35:37] father it gives you some prior to being
[1:35:39] who you are
[1:35:40] hello did not the Bible said we are
[1:35:43] citizens of heaven we have a kingdom
[1:35:49] that cannot be moved
[1:35:52] Paul said oh this earthly Tabernacle be
[1:35:54] the SOB I got a building devil and we so
[1:36:01] worried about this okay hallelujah you
[1:36:04] got him stay this thing is dying from
[1:36:06] like I heard a brother say this thing is
[1:36:08] dying from the moment you take your
[1:36:09] first breath we were born into death
[1:36:15] hallelujah Oh like I said many times I
[1:36:19] never knew what it meant for an old
[1:36:20] person to get up out of that chair you
[1:36:24] know they get up I better be careful how
[1:36:25] far I'll go down and let got complete
[1:36:30] victory because sometimes getting up out
[1:36:34] of that chair in
[1:36:37] especially if you not accompany with
[1:36:40] pain young people eh
[1:36:43] I told some friends of mine just tell
[1:36:44] that's a y'all better enjoy that you I
[1:36:48] say because when that age come don't you
[1:36:51] know Amen they talk about the pains of
[1:36:54] death how many y'all experienced in it
[1:36:55] oh yeah you're already experiencing the
[1:36:59] pain that come with death as you grow
[1:37:01] older you can't do what you want to do
[1:37:04] oh my goodness and you know something
[1:37:06] can be that much off the phone you trip
[1:37:08] over it because you can't lift your feet
[1:37:10] as hot you and I must understand that we
[1:37:18] have a greater hope we have also love
[1:37:21] God because God didn't play with us he
[1:37:23] didn't he didn't roll dice he didn't do
[1:37:25] checkers or in it he didn't do nothing
[1:37:27] like that and make this miss salvation
[1:37:29] by a chance I'm so grateful he did not
[1:37:32] make it by chance oh you got a chance to
[1:37:34] make help make ever no sir no ma'am this
[1:37:38] is not a chance
[1:37:39] this is predestination this is election
[1:37:43] this is by God's choosing well if God
[1:37:46] gonna just choose you listen God knew
[1:37:49] who you were gonna choose I don't
[1:37:51] understand it all but I do know one
[1:37:54] thing as I said today you didn't find
[1:37:56] Christ Christ found on you he knew where
[1:37:59] you were Adam we're out there and you
[1:38:01] think God didn't know where Adam or he
[1:38:07] wanted Adam to respond because it's when
[1:38:10] God asks you where you are you ought to
[1:38:12] know where you are right amen and when
[1:38:15] Adam when God responded and I love it
[1:38:19] like I said I hope you understood what I
[1:38:21] was saying about brother Troy's meaning
[1:38:22] preaching because I love brother Troy
[1:38:24] preaching I haven't heard it yet but I
[1:38:26] will but my point is when God was
[1:38:28] talking to you today or talking with you
[1:38:29] on Wednesday amen and I'm gonna tell you
[1:38:32] something I gotta listen cuz I gotta get
[1:38:35] mine too
[1:38:37] but my point is is imma imma gonna I'm
[1:38:39] tryin to tell you this is the attitude
[1:38:41] we want everybody to take we want you to
[1:38:45] say thank you Jesus so
[1:38:48] somebody sent me one of those things
[1:38:51] they said this man
[1:38:52] this person has seven years to continue
[1:38:56] to be six seven years I think it was and
[1:39:00] it's a long story but this bird was
[1:39:04] going to heaven he says ask the Lord why
[1:39:06] you know how long that I must take sick
[1:39:10] like this and the bird came back to Doug
[1:39:11] and said he told me that you have to be
[1:39:14] you got six seven years to go seven more
[1:39:17] years to go he said but but each day I
[1:39:20] want you to say thank you Lord and he
[1:39:25] said that those seven years turn into
[1:39:28] seven days because he every time he woke
[1:39:33] up no matter what kind of pain he felt
[1:39:35] no matter how it looked
[1:39:37] amen to him he said thank you Jesus
[1:39:39] thank you Lord oh Lord I just so thank
[1:39:44] you for every moment I have here and
[1:39:46] what I'm going through like right now I
[1:39:48] thank you Jesus hallelujah
[1:39:51] yes see that's what we fail to do the
[1:39:53] Bible said in all things give things
[1:39:55] because you know God is the one who's
[1:39:57] leading us God predestinated us he chose
[1:40:00] our battles for us right I just had a
[1:40:04] daughter a friend of mine who lost her
[1:40:06] daddy who never was a daddy to him/her
[1:40:08] and you know and I shared a few things
[1:40:11] with her and I said you know what God
[1:40:12] told me he said the daddy that you
[1:40:14] didn't have I am he now I'm gonna be the
[1:40:17] father that you so long for hallelujah
[1:40:20] if I had to make a choice I'd rather him
[1:40:23] than the other one that's going on you
[1:40:24] understand no offense but if I have been
[1:40:28] predestined ordained to pass a test I
[1:40:31] want to pass it with our hundred if I
[1:40:35] can get an A+ brother
[1:40:36] I want a plus hallelujah and don't tell
[1:40:42] me Amen those disciples amen had a
[1:40:44] different Holy Ghost no they didn't some
[1:40:46] of them Amen they hadn't you think there
[1:40:47] was some Superman they were only super
[1:40:49] because the Super God was him right but
[1:40:53] that's the kind of Holy Ghost I want to
[1:40:54] have that I can go to a chopping block
[1:40:56] and call out the devil said hey I'm
[1:40:59] laughing
[1:40:59] - you think you killing me but you see I
[1:41:02] have an eternal life I cannot die hmm
[1:41:14] Paul said I'll tell you what I want to
[1:41:17] stay back here this long for the Jews
[1:41:18] but if it was up to me I would have been
[1:41:20] gone a long time ago yeah that was Paul
[1:41:23] attitude but you see when you start
[1:41:25] thinking God he's short indeed he's
[1:41:28] short new trials
[1:41:30] he's shortened amen everything that
[1:41:32] you're going through when you begin to
[1:41:33] really praise the Lord you know I praise
[1:41:35] God for victories I haven't even seen
[1:41:37] yet huh thank you Jesus for saving all
[1:41:41] of my children that's what I do
[1:41:46] sometimes they'd ever try to make me
[1:41:48] think otherwise has no sir God gave me a
