day we get right into the word of god i'm so glad this morning it was too cool and now it's too warm somewhere in the middle of the road right [Music] oh my goodness that's where it's at now this morning we started out with acts 17. i'm going to read just a portion of that today and then we're going to go from there to colossians 1. acts 17 we're talking about the destiny of god's will and us being in that in that will in him uh that's why his will be done not ours it's uh a beautiful situation wearing that we're now beginning to see uh what god's plan has always been for us now we we didn't know throughout the ages they didn't know because we had fallen away from god so much think about it's been over 6 000 years since you know the fall of adam and eve and look how far we have come in the most contrary way and you know what just like with all the issues going on in the world uh we were talking and and i heard somebody said you know it's not a skin problem it's a sin problem and once people begin to understand that it's a sin problem that has the people doing what they're doing you know maybe we can repent but you see as a whole america and most of the world have fallen away so much so there is no place to repent uh when you think about all of the tragic tragedies that has been taking place and all of the earthquakes and then i think in the congo they've had another volcano erupts so it's two going on right and you think about that and almost everywhere you look the philippines and different places islands and you know that's the ring of fire people and brother adam talks about when that thing began to wag his tail that's exactly when california is going to sink so we're right at that place of the sinking of california in the translation of the body now understanding the opening of the word it says that god that opening of the word was also the gathering of the people it was a time when god was going to gather those saints who have already gone on and i was telling somebody the other day i said they must be having a glorious time down up in there up in there wherever they are they're having a glorious time because they understand what's getting ready to take place you know we in in this dimension we're so blind to the other dimensions but that's why god wants us to come up higher that's why he told john come up hither you can't see this revelation on the earth by being earthly and carnal we've got to get into the spirit of the composer in order to see what the music with the next move in this drama is and you are it you know like this you know you know we realized a man that was samson amen was uh you know being paraded and being mocked which samson typed out the church he became a laughingstock the same pentecostal church the same powerful church that used to be you know the talk of the town to talk with the world when it came to miracles signs and wonders have now fallen amen and you rarely hear anything all they have is music shouting and dancing and confusion right they were blind and i asked what happened to samson he was blind but one thing about samson he was not a quitter and that's he was the typing of the bride she is not acquitter she doesn't quit she moves on in spite of all the opposition she could not feel or see in the natural but he had more sight than the philistines had and he said there's a possibility so i want to say that even with your faults or your failures there's still a possibility that god is going to answer your prayer just that possibility he moved on that it's kind of like the woman with the issue of blood with that little possibility if i but just touch the lamb of his garment i shall be made whole and so we realized by god's grace amen faith doesn't quit faith is a is a man of muscles [Laughter] and there's no failure in faith so let's read acts 17 we started today at the 22nd verse uh by god's grace 24th verse god that made the world and all the things therein seeing that he is lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands neither is worship with men's hands as though he needed anything and seeing he giveth to all life and breath and all things and that's so amazing people when they give their tithes they actually think they're giving something you're only giving what god has given you and so many people are so stingy when it comes to god but then they want god to give them everything you know it's amazing i don't usually mention tithing but i just felt spirit led to me there and he have made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the way of the face of the earth excuse me and have determined the time the force appointed and the balance of their habitation and so let's just put it this way god knows your boundaries he set those boundaries you know and uh i think it was a brother rich brought to my attention one time and you know brother rich said you know god is so awesome he didn't make all everybody nurses and he knew those who would be nurses he's got the right amount of nurses the right amount of doctors the right amount of scientists sciences of god too but god comes first all that is of god but god comes first you know you know we're not talking illiteracy here we're talking about amen god is the creator of all things where would we be without those who would construct and knew how to construct buildings and roads and all these modern things that we have now is very very convenient and i don't think any of us would want to go back to the horse and buggy not me you know maybe if i'm at a fair ground or somewhere where you know you can get a little small experience of it that's okay but who would want to live in that under that kind and there are people in the world that still live that way but i'm speaking about those of us who are in america where we have the luxuries of driving in the car anyway those things are okay the thing that god has issues with is because man failed to put him first he must come first and he knows how to make you miserable god knows how to get our attention now and that's exactly what he did with samson he made him miserable sometimes you got to go down in order to look up so let's go on with the word of god by god's grace i'm just a little stirred this this evening 28th verse for in him we live and move and have our beings as certain also of your own prophets have said for we are also the offspring and so we talk about a destiny we talked about this morning how that from the beginning of time before time or when adam and eve was made or created god purpose for them was to be fruitful and to multiply they failed they did multiply but they were no longer producing sons of god they were producing sons of adam and now now god called them sons of god now why because they still was made in the image and likeness of god but they were marred right the sons of god saw the daughters of men and took unto them wise so god's still liking them as the sons of god just like he liken all of us as sons and daughters of god because we're still made in his image and his likeness we know good from evil not like some kind of beast or some kind of animal that has no idea what good and evil is they just do what they do but man who is a higher order who is in the image and likeness of god and that's what happened when they eyes were open they beg knew good and evil they began to have their own will and their own choices of things activated while under the word it was only the will of god and i explained that in the message before that is why in the garden the second adam who was lord of heaven said father not my will but thine be done he reversed the very will of man and placed it back in to the will of god when adam took it out of the hand of god and placed it in himself so and in that is where you'll find eternal life amen colossians you love the lord colossians 1 15. one thing i love about this word it speaks for itself it speaks for itself we know by god's grace that uh how can i say it god is rich in mercy amen let us never forget about that god never forces his by his whosoever will god is a gentleman right and he never forces anything on us he'll tell us what is required of us but when it comes to forcing it on us he will not do it of course there are consequences for us not be obeying obedient to him but then at the end of the day is because of our choice our choosing excuse me i'm just having a i'm having a little struggle up here there you go it was hiding from me colossians amen colossians amen 115 let's just uh let's go to the 13th verse who have delivered us from the power of darkness and have translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom i love that has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son that ain't tomorrow that's today what part of us did he translate and if he translated us already we're in there already amen in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sin who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in earth visible and invisible whether there be thrones dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist as we say you can't love something you don't know you know what i mean you can't you can't you can't i mean we we uh you know we use the word love so lightly and freely you know yeah we love i love my automobile you know what i mean i love this chair you don't think can't even do you look they can't love you back can't even hear you you know what i mean but we do that because there's levels of love but there's only one divine love there's a there's agape love and there's a filial love and we want the agape love that causes us to love even our enemy let me hurry amen by god's grace let's just stop there for the uh the reading no one more scripture isaiah 43 and 6 isaiah 43 and 6 i did not know i had gone so long on this morning but i was blessed and i trust that you were as well uh we know there's a destiny and i'm looking forward to it i'm i'm really excited for the change i've seen where god has brought me from i know where i came from a lot of you all don't know you have no idea but i was i was really under the mud i wasn't stepping into it i was covered right it was god who heard my voice underneath the mud and pulled me out that's just the way he did it no use in trying to spare me a spare my you know like i've been some good boy no i was not a good boy hmm let's start at the fifth verse fear not for i am with thee i will bring thy seed from the east and gather thee from the west and when i i will say to the church to the north give up and to the south keep not back bring my sons from far and my daughters from the ends of the earth even everyone that is called by my name for i have created him for my glory i have formed him yea i have made him call you for his glory we need to find out what the glory of the lord is let's pray father we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for being so good to us in a time when satan has tried to belittle us cut us down demean us uh between us and everything he's tried to do but you in your word has promised us maturity in this day in spite of all of his efforts there is a seed that is alive in us that will grow until we reach that perfection because it's ordained to do so and father we ask that you give us the grace to surrender to your will that we would let go and let god have his way lord we pray that you bless this service in a special way bless the hearers whether they be here or on the youtube bless them father they may be able to uh enjoy take partake of the service wherever they may be father we give you the glory the honor and the praise and we thank you for the opening of our eyes that we can see thank you lord in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated now if you notice that even in the third chapter of revelation uh laodicea is being rebuked because she's forgotten laodicea was the pentecostal age and we understand that god has pulled us out of that age it's not that we're better pentecostals it's just that the grace of god has found us our roots are pentecostal if you want to put it that way our roots amen comes from the in feeling and indwelling of the holy ghost but we realize that we're not uh we have matured as paul says you know when he was a child he spake like a child he you know talked and walked like a child but when that which is perfect has come it's come he put away the childish things and so we realized that all of the sensational things that we dealt with and enjoy in pentecost was not necessarily signifying that we truly was sealed by the holy ghost we enjoyed his presence we enjoyed the dancing we enjoyed the shouting we enjoyed the speaking in tongues we enjoyed all of those things for those of us who have gone through those stages we've seen it we've seen the miracles i've seen miracles even when i was among them but we understand that all of that does not signify that you have the holy ghost what signifies the holy ghost in you is when you can recognize and agree to the word of your day you see because you've got to understand that the same anointing of luther went to the wesleyans but when the wesleyans refused and the wesleyans were under uh their same anointing but a higher order of the anointing uh that the lutherans was in and when the lutherans failed to follow the westlands they died and the westlands when they failed you know to move on with the pentecostals they die and so when the pentecostals fail to move on with the word of their day they die the life continues on up the stark until it comes amen to a place where it will produce the very seed that was planted amen and what you must understand is that this is the omega time that's why jesus said i am the alpha and the omega i am the planting and i'm the harvest and so we're living in the harvest time we're living in a time where the sea now is laying in the presence of the sun amen to do what be ripened amen so when god comes back again he's coming back for the same kind of seed he had planted in the age of ephesus which was the paul uh paul age many people don't even liken paul as a prophet but paul was a prophet the word of the lord came to paul and this is why paul was able to speak as he did right remember paul said in the corinthians church he says ah he said you're making me nervous now he said i would i want to present to you i i want to present to god you as a chaste virgin but you're scaring me you're making me nervous because you're acting like eve and just as sure as the serpent beguile eve i'm a fear i'm afraid you're going to be beguiled likewise paul knew what he was talking about and why did he take this same thing spiritually that was taking our place in the ephesus church and and and and liking it into the to the garden of eden because paul was fully aware of what take place took place in the garden of eden hallelujah he knew amen that it was not an apple that eve had eaten but eve was a she allowed herself to be a machinery of high breeding amen you see that's why god could not accept cain's offering he was not of the bloodline he was not adam's seed and so because of that amen there was nothing he could do now god said unto him now if you act nice and you come and worship and do like you ought to you know i will accept you think about it here was god right there giving cain the uh uh the the place a place a place in the garden in other words i won't separate you i'll leave you there now jesus didn't do that jesus in the new testament say let them grow together but i'll bring a prophet he'll bring the separation amen right but in the garden of eden god separated and drove cain out of the garden and cain left and went to god and y'all know the story but the whole point is is that they learned the animalistic way of reproduction and they began to multiply and multiply and multiply and as they multiply women began to get prettier and prettier and prettier and prettier and and then men began to take more than one wife you know it's like having three or four cars i'll take this one i'll take that one oh yeah that one's better you know how you can't drive four cars at one time but that's what people do and they don't they fail to see amen that when we do that amen it is out of the order of god now look at god look at look at the scriptures when god wanted to bring an elect to to earth that's going to do a will some his purpose he made it known samson huh an angel visited by an angel right amen when it came to uh moses visited by an angel right all those seats and that was the way it was supposed to be god was to determine when the seed would come upon the earth but adam and eve they failed to the serpent's way see animals you know they uh have mating season but the woman can mate at any time she can get pregnant at any time lambs get pregnant uh you know and have their babies in the spring but you see there's a time they can can't conceive but when a woman she can do it and why because she fell into the animalistic way of reproducing and when she did that she no longer produced i said majority of the children that were being born were not children of god and here was adam seed and at the end of the day adam island had eight seed whatever went on the ark was all that he had left because the hybrining of flood swords had killed off the two seat of god speaking spiritually so you see amen the earth was replenished but it was replenished by serpents this is why god said destroy it all that's why that's why noah could preach for 120 years and nobody repented they were like their father it was the offspring but yet god says no no no this my word cannot come back void see it cannot god had had adam says listen it must be done so god comes down and he didn't say he was the second adam says he was the last adam that was jesus christ god in morphine coming down to do what restore bring back what the first adam messed up the first adam as i said in corinthians made us sinners made us flesh made us corrupt and look now over six thousand years how corrupt we've become man has been he has lost his identity so much so he doesn't even know who he is or what he is they're tattooing themselves they're putting horns on their head and disfiguring their bodies they want to look like animals if they could read that mind of a cat or dog the cat or dog would love to be a man or a woman and here we want to go that way see we it just messed up and people don't realize it's because we're lost we've lost our identity and in the only way to find your way back you got to pick up the road map you got to pick up the diary you got to pick up amen the the will and testament and find out whose relatives and who gets the promises yeah but anyway let's go on we've been created for his purpose and i i want to be i want to do his purpose and this might sound really crazy to you but you know i says lord if i can't be with you i'd rather burn up i'd rather come to my end can you imagine living eternity in the devil's hell always thinking about how you did his bidding thinking about how god tried to call you and you wouldn't respond that in itself just thought alone is hellish to know that there is no prop no way no way no way you could ever have eternal life and be with the god that created you that's that's amazing fire would be a pleasure compared to that kind of a torment but god rich in mercy as i said always tried to contact man and even when mankind had gotten down to the lowest of all lows he always would lift up a standard the bible said that god never left himself without a witness huh never left himself without a wisdom even if it was just only one what you say noah yeah you crazy you're up in the top of the mountain building an ark tell me there's going to rain and we haven't seen no rain the best we have ever seen of water is the dew coming up so scientifically no doubt they tried to experiment and see to see whether nora's noah's theory was correct and they went into the atomic mode trying to find out if hot air and cold air collides together what it's going to produce and they went too far you think oh god just caused it the rain man did it science did it just like science calls it the flood science is going to cause heaven to rain fire amen by way of the third world war dropping the nuclear bomb is going to throw this earth back into the fire hey in that world we will have a fire baptism hey mankind but in the whole time they don't realize what the fire baptism is it is this platform it is the stage for the bride of jesus christ and when she come back to earth the bible says she will walk upon the ashes of the wicked [Laughter] hallelujah knowing the devil has been placed under her feet that's our destiny that's his will and god let your will be done he always tried to show himself god is a just god he he doesn't he always give you warnings before he judge you but god is a mysterious man the bible said that he took moses and moses did exploits in egypt so much so god told moses you hear what i'm saying god told moses you will become god unto pharaoh can you imagine you we don't understand egypt had built such a kingdom they had they were led they lasted for thousands of years i ain't talking about america three to four hundred years thousands of years egypt was number one and god took a runaway fugitive enslaved by the name of moses brought him back that's right even a murderer brought him back to egypt with a stick in his hand i wonder how scientists figured that one out the greatest nation on earth was defeated by a shepherd boy a shepherd the lowest of all loaves it was low class to be a shepherd in england in egypt and god said listen i'm going to show you something you might be proud in your business your builders may be high but i'm gonna show you i'm bringing you down and listen let me tell you something god hardened pharaoh's heart when he wanted to repent god hardened his heart why because god had already made him a vessel of dishonor is that all right god took a man now he's trying to reveal himself but let me tell y'all something you know why leo the seal is blind because god said there would be god said it he's a god of god's contrast there are those there shall be light in the entire some kind of darkness must be somewhere and he's not talking about the sunlight spiritually there shall be light in the evening time and you and i must understand evening time has passed we're at the breaking of a day midnight has passed we are breaking of the day is that right the morning star has appeared hailing the sun that is to come and the dog how do you know brother because the darkness are now congealing together trying to press out the light but they don't understand never in history never in the time of creation has darkness ever defeated the light hallelujah there's a light why because they said uh the the difference between um uh the darkness is the light is that the the darkness is absence of the light hallelujah so you got to understand if once light it doesn't matter how dark you are light comes in you become the light right and so that's how it is it doesn't matter how dark the heart is once light comes in the heart whatever was dark becomes light so god comes along and he's always trying and when i went to egypt and now i love this i always tell people egypt never got over moses but moses but egypt was so proud to they don't really remember moses you know just like in that movie how seth he said we're going to wipe his name out we're going to take it off this and that's true i i went to egypt and and and and the uh what they call those people that showed you around um the guy you know we were there in the library and everything she said we don't have no record of moses i say yes amen that's why brother ben said that that man who who made the movie was inspired by god because they have no record of moses but we do that's why egypt is in a wreck to this day they never got over moses yeah so anyway let's move on but what what i'm trying to say is at the time of exodus god was hidden behind human flesh god even told moses you will be god unto these people you understand me that was god in moses moses never did one miracle it was god who did all the miracles he was hidden behind the veil of moses you understand me that was god behind the veil when he said when he when when he struck out that rod amen uh and and he spoke to the sea and that sea backed up no man could do that i'm coming to something because we got to know where our destiny is you know i tell you what i don't know how the little worm thinks about his who he is when he's a worm but somehow he always when it becomes a butterfly he doesn't act like a worm anymore right when he takes that madam office change and he gets into that cocoon because there's a hiding place and when you get into that holies of holies oh somebody help me here see i want you to understand when you get into the presence of god you don't have to work it works for you hallelujah when you get into the presence of god that's why the devil tried to keep us from praying that's why the devil was trying to keep us from fasting he do not want us to get into that element of of god because you know if you get into the element of god god will change you it's god's business to bring forth life in us you can't do it just be the rod hallelujah and i told you that rob was a female rod did i tell you that because only the female tree can bring forth fruit and that tree brought forth almonds think about it god was using that rod all along throughout time showing in type the godhead see a lot of times people think the godhead is just father son and holy ghost those were terms that they've been used in the modern language but you got to understand that the godhead means more than that and i'm going to prove it to you brother branham brought out some things is she what people don't understand god if you want to put that away has always been changing because one time they only knew him as jehovah one time they only knew him as uh elohim you understand they knew him jehovah jairo jehovah nesi that was a godhead he was the only one he still is the only one but then when jesus christ came and the holy ghost began to manifest itself in the new testament they said the godhead which consists of father son and holy ghost but in their theology they made the godhead three and not one and they fail to see that the godhead has always been one always will be one and if you had a two-headed monster you'd be in trouble god is not two-headed there's only one head the father who's above christ christ who's the head is who's above the church and you got to understand let's let's just go back to the garden of eden who was the godhead there who represented the godhead before the fall it was adam and eve you know what that means the authority of the word they had the authority of the word they had god living in them they had his mind they had his thinking they had his will they had his way that was the god hand so if you go if that was the way it was in the beginning you got to understand that's the way in the end you say prove it to me by scripture because the bible says the spirit and the bride says come amen amen not two persons one person amen he said i'll tell you what jesus i'm going a different way he said but i'm gonna tell you something i will let you in this day as you overcome i will let you sit in my father's throne even as i have sat in his throne hallelujah now when jesus sat in his father's throne who did you see jesus hallelujah and when the bride sits in here his throne he sits in our throne which is the heart you understand that this is where the throne room is it ain't there that was a replica the throne room is your heart amen yes i'm not saying there's not a throne room i'm saying but the major throne room is in your heart that's where god you are the tabernacle of god that's why people are so weak because they don't want to believe that but when you know you've got god on the inside of you you are as omnipotent as he is that's right because he said you could ask whatsoever you will and it shall be given unto you hallelujah is that right and the scripture tells us that god is more able to give us a bundle exceedingly abundantly above anything we ask or think hallelujah let's move on by the grace of god you understand what i'm saying let me just read a few things here is this okay because i said i wasn't going to keep you long and i really don't intend to do so but i'm trying to get us to see this thing it can't go back board it has to come back to the reality of who we really are sons and daughters of god i read there in acts 17 he said we are the offspring of god offspring of god that means god had a son his son would be a god if he had a daughter his son would be a god it would not be it would not be a horse or donkey or cow it would have to be the very image of the father and the mother it would have to be the very genetics of the father and the mother is that right so when god produced that's why god said to uh adam and eve now listen he says you must leave father and mother and cleave to one another because you have now become one flesh now you love that so we look at this thing and you say well brothers what are you trying to say i'm trying to say this you didn't create you you did not make you who you are god made you and no matter how insignificant you may feel it means nothing to god god kind of really it's something about god he takes the losers of this world to make him great he looks down in the trash can and gets the throwaways huh that's what he does you know he recycles you he takes the trash and makes something good out of it hello i'm among the trash i was among the trash hallelujah but that song say look what god has done omnipotent is he look what god has done hallelujah mastermind is he he took the moon and stars hallelujah placed him in place came down shed as his blood for the whole human race look what god has done mastermind you see that's one of those old songs hallelujah you love the lord amen amen listen when we how many all believe that god is the word god is the word everything was made by the word what you're sitting on has been made by the word what your breathing has been made by the word everything is made by the word see it says god it's your word it's your word and you know this this word can only operate by faith faith is something that god gives you you can't muster you can't exercise into it it's something that god gives you it's a revelation that you know that you know that you know that you know and you don't have no explanation for it how come this and out of all the world out of all the religions out of all that's going on god chooses you and select you to hear what is truth see people can argue with the fact that they don't believe brother branham is a prophet but i can prove to you that he is and that he was just by the things he preached the man been gone since 65 but yet and still the words that he preached still lives and it's happening right now we see the world counseling of churches we see what they call the the the big businessmen getting together and people have no idea it's amazing how god allowed me to see things because before big tech ever became big tech they met with the pope i saw it and they came back with a new agenda and they have enforced it and let me tell you something nothing's going to stop it you know you say oh we're going to have a better day the better days are over and what we're heading into nothing can stop it is on a roll i don't care how much money you try to put to it i love this one and i enjoy that one but let me tell you something this thing is going to fulfill itself amen and this thing in america is affecting the whole world amen it's true everybody seems like whatever happened in america happens here england yeah everywhere it's happening because the whole world is being consumed by the spirit of destruction it has to be destroyed all systems must fail you understand me before the exodus egypt had to fall and before the exodus the whole world must fall everything is going to fall must fall and at the same time when this thing is being being done there are those who's covered by the blood amen aren't you glad to be covered by the blood hallelujah aren't you glad to be able to hear the voice of a prophet knowing that it's not the man but it was god hidden and veiled behind them and this is what we're trusting not the flesh of a of a seventh year or a great seventh grade uh man born in kentucky that's not what we're trusting it's the word that he brought a man we realized that was not a man it was god amen and that it didn't stop there that's the thing everybody think it stopped it did not god don't you understand god confuses and blind people under that seventh seal let's put it this way under the sixth it shook the people when john the baptist was killed but it really shook the people when jesus died amen they had a they had their own interpretation just like the people in our day they never would have thought william branham was going to die but he had to die like john had to die he had to move out of the way something was turning jesus had been identified he pointed to the lamb of god and said that's my lord see but that was the transition that was a changing of dying and those who followed john was left behind god gave him a space of grace they met up with paul and you know he gave him the word and they changed i know what baptism was you baptized i was baptized under john baptized john only baptized with the baptismal epistles you need to be re-baptized again so you see i'm saying all of these things they're saying god comes along and this whole thing is falling apart the evidence of what we see small in number and this is everywhere it is it's everywhere even among us people don't want to hear the word let me tell you something if the word don't give you joy you are backslidden amen hello if you can get happiness and joy out of music and playing and dancing and everything else oh that's good but your husband is here your husband is here it's all right to like your ring and like your watch or whatever he's giving you but because you like and love that that don't mean you love him he gave those things to you to gain your favor so that you can love him hallelujah this is what god has done for us he's given the word so we can love the word because let me tell you what the bible says that all shall pass away everything the grass with us the flowers fade away the music fades away the dancing fade away all the gifts fade away hallelujah but the word of the lord shall stand that's where we are we're in we're the word we cannot fall it's impossible for us to disbelieve the word we were ordained to believe it like mary we may not understand it but be it unto me according to thy word of god amen see that's where we are that's why they call us crazy hallelujah listen they're going to strip us from all nice and fancy things everybody that won't join into this world council of churches you say that can't be true oh yes there was another man whom god hid behind his name was daniel and daniel you got to bow if you don't bow to the image out there i'm throwing you into the lions no we're not bowing to the world council of churches and the image of the beast we're not going to take the mark of the beast and we don't care i'll open up my window so you can see we're not going there i don't care listen when you tell tell me tell me tell me throughout all history when has the majority ever been right never never they have made a mockery out of christianity all the churches they have go there with all kinds of little shorts and skirts and little everything's exposed and then yes jesus loves me come on like i said the other day i'm not criticizing a girl i don't know she probably just don't know no better but i was on the youtube and i don't use that no more but i had youtubing and they had fantasia on there oh my goodness and she was singing when he put my name on the road you know jesus you know huh i've been changed i know i've been changed and i'm like you've been changed if you've been changed i wonder what you were before you were changed but you know not making mockery i don't mean to do that she don't she probably don't know she just doesn't know they're blind naked and don't know it because i was out there i used to be on the on the on a group called uh the voices of faith and we'll sing on friday night record on friday night so our songs will be played sunday morning on tv and friday night after we record we go to the club oh yeah we didn't know no better but as i began to sing the songs that song convicted me i think that was one of those songs lord you know i've been changing angels in heaven and i knew i hadn't been changed but it did something i used to hear this song thank god i was saying you know he watched me through and through and made my love brand new thank god thank god i've been saved i've been saying and i'm saying lucy and nothing in me would say nothing but god had mercy he knew the thirst he knew the desire was to be saved and by those words god convicted me and i had to stop that nonsense i had this big hair overhead believe it or not i went to the church they were baptizing i'm like i got a concert tonight i came with this because when you wet the fro you know what happened to it right from there to there i said i can't do this i'll come back after the concert and that's what i did i came back after the concert and there was brother simmons and i heard the voice says be baptized in the name of jesus christ i heard him he said no you didn't yes i did where it came from the outside or the inside i heard it who can determine did that come from the outside no i heard him he was there i got baptized when they baptized me in the name of jesus christ not only did i i heard the voice commanded me to be baptized but i also heard the voice says now you know the name and when i come up out of that water it could have been my own experience in which it was it could have been i don't know what it was but i saw lights hanging all off the walls and i'm screaming where look at all those lights and i was the only one that could see those lights i didn't know it at the time but you know what i've seen those lights before when they were killing a missionary there over there in india and bombay they had just burned a missionary his wife and family up in a car i was at a hotel there laying in my bed and those lights appeared then i had no idea what was going on on the outside until i came out and that's what they told me god protected me because i i kept seeing lights flashing i thought it was my eyesight i don't know what all that means i'm just telling you it doesn't make me any different no you know what i'm trying to say these supernatural things they're wonderful but those are the things that i do not major on i major on life the life of christ many shall come in my day say lord lord have not we cast out devils have not we done many wonderful works in your name and he's going to say depart from me ye workers of iniquity i don't know you that's people ministers prophets and prophetess all kinds of people who were used by god but they never came to know him and he never came to know them they never had an intimate relationship and god is looking for an intimate relationship with his people a union that's how intimate he wants to be a union not some engagement ring a union that's a marriage becoming one flesh hallelujah is this okay let me hurry up listen we we it's coming from the message seeking after him he said god it's your word and take the right mental attitude toward it that divine promise it will bring it to pass because there is no defeat faith cannot be defeated there is no defeat to faith you understand me taking that right this what you understand i'm telling you devil this word is god you don't fight me you're fighting the word the word is god and there is no defeat in the word that's how you bring it to the devil you take it right to the juggling or right to the heart and let him know this is god this is my shield this is my buckler you understand me this is how i i'm straightened in the inner man by his word are you going to be lost i cannot be lost devil i'm in the word the word is in me we have become united amen together hallelujah listen genuine faith no no defeat it's already done it's already done it's already over god says so now it's the same thing one time what you really once you really believe right that touches him in other words when god see that you truly believe it it touches him hallelujah let me move on amen you got to understand then it was god and in them days it was god in a man i'm listening because i'm working with the godhead now and i'm gonna bring a scripture here just a minute because so you don't think i'm bringing a new doctrine i'm just trying to tell you that the ark moves on it takes it moves place it it changes mask right why would brother branham say the move is on for the bride and why would he have to decrease for him to increase and if he increased what was his increase it was his bride it was god in his bride the holy ghost now representing god in the feminine form oh somebody i just feel just like shouting yarn we believe that see see it was god and a man his son jesus christ we believe that not just a prophet not just an ordinary man or ordinary human it was god in christ god in a man the fullness of the godhead bodily in a man god in a man see now is god in men amen the fullness of the god in the godhead see what i'm saying the let me yeah let me read it again for you so it's that don't stir you [Laughter] now is god in men the fullness of god in the godhead in his entire church no it can't get in planar manifesting himself fulfilling his word that has been the mystery to restore eve back into the godhead hallelujah what are you saying i'm trying to tell you i mean that's what it's all about you go look at esther what did god what did what did king hesselro did when when he stuck out his scepter amen to esther he actually gave her power she and him became one in the godhead and he even brought it broke it down he said i'll give you half of the kingdom and jesus said we are joint heirs with christ you're part of it but your your definition of the godhead is what confuses people that those words were only used in the new testament but when it came to esther she not only condemned the devil haman she killed all of the serpent seed hallelujah she restored israel she did because she said within her mind and she died and let's put it this way in time she said we go fast three days and three nights without water or food in a natural way she dies she resurrected and when she rolls she rolls with power hallelujah and the king saw that that she was wearing the garment in which he gave her that glorified garment of praise ain't nothing more flattering to your husband when you put on something he's bought for you that's right he likes that i'm telling you he likes that and immediately he's going to compliment you because he realized you wearing that i bought you that didn't i yeah you know and that's how it was with the king he was overwhelmed with her beauty and for the fact that she was wearing the garment he gave her so you see what i'm saying what is your garment is christ put on him we must put on christ what is christ the anointing we put him on and he puts us on we become one oh my god god is doing something and we cannot allow church entity and christianity as we call it to be our hindrance of growth we've got to go beyond pentecost we must manifest god in a way that they did not see that's what the prophet was trying to tell them when they were majoring on speaking in tongues and shouting and dancing he said listen there's a lot of people among you who do that and they don't have it the character of christ is not there and power without character is satanic i'm trying to tell you what's in your ranks because you have altered the word and you made it the evidence of the holy ghost speaking in tongues you allow satan to come in and deceive you and so therefore another seed has been planted and now the serpents are standing in the doorway of your church just like they did in the doorway when jesus came your preachers he said he called them serpents he said they won't go in and they won't let you go in and they're holding the truth in unrighteousness understand me they know who i am and because of their jealousy they have plotted against me to kill me that's what he said is there parable he spoke it he said the king sent his own son he had already sent laborers into the vineyard he he sent them there and they killed them all when they ran them off and here and then and then when the sun came to oh this is the sun let us kill him that we may get his inheritance and that's exactly what they've done these mega churches instead of giving it to the people of god they have taken it upon themselves stealing god's inheritance hmm i'm just telling you we're there i'm feeling close i'm feeling close see now it's guarding men the fullness of the god here in the godhead that in his entire church manifesting himself fulfilling his word now we find god of all ages has skin on it he god has been hidden behind the veil in other words god came down he revealed himself to some and he hid himself from others by the veil of william branham god has done the same thing in this day that's right here's the bride of jesus christ is on the scene and he's hiding himself behind his people they call you a lunatic they call you brendamites they call you a cult they call you all of these things just like they did jesus he promised it didn't he he said if they did it in the green tree what they gonna do in the drive right if they you understand me so you got to understand it man all of these things are really wonderful especially when you have come to a level in god you know who you are and we don't put on acting we don't put on displays they have gotten so much hollywood into the pentecostal realm and into the message and i'm going to say it again you pray for people come out devil come out come out i know you in there come spending hours with drama and the whole time the devil is laughing at you because he knows you don't even believe what you're screaming when jesus said come out of her that was it the devil had to leave when that when you when that man who had epilepsy and and jesus spoke over that man and told that devil to come out the devil acted up you see the devil of drama he loved drama you ever seen people like that they just love drama i've seen it i've seen you say one thing they waving their head i saw a girl get beat up like that big old girl big girl i better not call her name she might catch on this video one day just a little skinny little girl you know coming home from school in i think i was in the seventh grade at that time walking down the road and this girl who's a friend of mine even to this day she's throwing up her hand i'm going to whip you she had a those long needles knitting needles that little girl says cat i don't want to fight you she trimmed it like a little mouse i think that was her her little fake defense you know she said but i tell you what cat if you hit me i'm going to hit you back so don't you know how to cry the crowd pushing get your head can't do it cat hit that girl and i saw lightning thunder and rain or something i mean this girl must have had some brothers she stood up and then she grabbed cat this is a big girl with a little this little girl literally lifting her and the whole time no forgive me i can't get it out my mind every time she hears her can't go i called her name lord forgive me but i learned a lesson you can never go by anybody's size you don't know what they're packing all right you know what i think about let me move on let me move on so my point is this goliath thought the same thing he waving his probably so everything oh david you do a little something you run and don't know i'm gonna take your head off and david said but you don't understand i come in the name of the lord david didn't fuss with him david took it says no no no you the one's gonna die and i'm gonna take your head off can you imagine a little boy talking stuff like that but david knew what he was packing brother bradley said do we have any davids do we have it and david's left people who are not afraid of circumstances and the things that the devil tried to put on you he is a liar i don't care what kind of sickness he's a liar that's not yours that's not your headache that's not your blood pressure that's not your diabetes that's his stuff god healed us with his stripes we were healed 2 000 years ago and the medals are still work and the devil knows it god is so good to us you love the lord i'm just going to stop here but uh let me read this because this is what god is don't worry about vindication god will vindicate his word if you stand on his word he's going to vindicate it sometimes god allows you to go to the extreme before he comes through in other words he might let you walk directly into the fire before he come and rescue you but he will he's done it before you understand me god don't keep us out of trouble he just don't that's part of it how much do you really love him how much do you really believe him and you know every time when things are going well i just love the lord but when things go rough do you still love him remember the prophet god tell about that little story about those poor poor couple who didn't have much lived in the box cart from on the train track and he went up to the house of the rich people where he he had married them and here he peeps through the door the window or however he kind of looks in there and they fussing and caring on about what happened the night before at the party and the man was jealous of his wife because she she um dance with somebody else and they screaming and hollering at everybody each other and then knocked on the door to see it brother branham come god bless you brother bran how y'all doing we're just doing well aren't we honey you better smile too you see what i'm saying hypocrites he said and then i went down and i found out from my brother what happened to that couple who didn't have holly nothing when he got married his hair was shagged and everything else it didn't have nothing to give her but love he went down in there and he said i i felt like a hypocrite i i was looking in on there and here he had just gotten off from work and she's sitting on his lap and and they're they're counting the money and he wanted to go buy her a dress and she said honey i don't need a dress and you know all that kind of thing and you know we yeah he and he goes on and said but they loved each other so much he said who was the rich ones see being rich doesn't guarantee you happiness and joy well i want to i want somebody that can financially take care of me but that don't mean you're going to be happy find somebody you love that's going to love you and going to endure see that's what god wants he don't want somebody to love him because of his riches oh god is good to me but what ain't he when he doesn't when he's not or when you think he's not hallelujah when trials are coming do you still love him when somebody gets sick and ready to die or even die you do you still love him or do you get angry with him you see no all things work together for the good of them that love god you got to love him in the pain the sorrow the shame or whatever you love him still that's the kind of bride he wants he wants somebody that's going to stick with him like i've tried to sell somebody i said that's the thing about a lot of christians like i said this morning i'm getting ready to close on this segment then we'll when we preach again we'll move on with it but the point is sometimes people misunderstand love and like i said this morning they think love is giving give me this give me that that ain't that is not love is too thick and thin i've seen people do some crazy things wife or someone get afflicted husband get afflicted and then they want to write them a divorce you never loved that person things are going to change all flowers fade nothing remains the same but the word but somewhere you got to come to grips whether you know this is love or this is convenience and i've seen people marry for convenience stuck like chuck people in this message i've seen congolese people and different other people england people from england a couple married each other in the military because they wanted better tax breaks that's how the devil fooled people but when it comes to marrying god the thing about god is when you come to marry him he says you got to give up everything i don't want nothing in your past to come between us so you got to give it up all give up all i don't care who it is or what it is when you come to the altar you come just as i am i don't have nothing to give nothing in my hands i have to bring i'm not clinging to anything i'm coming just as i have i'm surrendering my thoughts my ways my habits my everything i'm surrendering all to you lord i'm stripping myself naked so you can see everything i have nothing to bring but i understand you're the only one that can clothe me you can take away my shame you can build me into a person a real person this is what i come for i want to be united with you lord and it doesn't matter what circumstances i want you you're the treasure that i have found and the thing about it in closing i i'll finish this later i think about the rich young ruler sometimes and how god told him says listen you've been a real christian i'm paraphrasing it you've done all the works you've done everything that's needed to be done but you haven't given up your most prized possession and i want you to give that up sell all that you have and come follow me so close to the kingdom and yet he turned and walked away because he still was holding on to worldly things a lot of christians are will find themselves in that position they fail to see that the offer that god has given you can't even be compared to what you have you want to hold on to your pennies when god wants to give you trillions zillions whatever and you think this life is something it ain't worth two cent it's like a vapor you can't even grab it you can't hold it it's not there long enough it disappears that's right that's what james said this life is like a vapor a vapor's a short period of time once was there now it's gone and you want to hold on to that vapor tell me if it's possible it's not it's for a moment and it's going to next right so you say well brothers what are you trying to say and jesus says i'm offering you eternal life a vapor can't even be compared i don't even how would you count a vapor into eternal life but most people look at this world like i want to live like that y'all too strict i can't do this i can't do that well okay let's see when you get to hell you can do it people think and i'm closing people think when i get the hair they don't say it but many people do they don't they think going down the hell they're gonna be partying you'll be jumping but it won't be bad music and that's what people don't understand this life is nothing you're going to die can't carry nothing with you and everything you think is worth something it ain't worth nothing and think about it every that's what solomon said it's vanity you don't work all your life to save up all this money you die and a fool comes around and spend it in a day they don't care i don't seen it when somebody die the money hunters come they do the relatives come i want this i want that i want this sometimes the people ain't even in their grave yet but that's what they do so solomon's right it's vanity we put emphasis in the wrong place what we need to be concentrating on right now faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness holy ghost the capstone of god capping us off that's where we what we should be building that's where our emphasis should be lord help me make me into that perfect statue of christ let me be that individual that you would house your holy spirit here that i would be a reflection of you in this last day that's my goal let's stand everything has a destiny you take an automobile shop you got all kinds of nuts and bolts and screws and paint and you name it all those things look like jump put laying on the floor if you put them all together un unconnected but when you start connecting those pieces together whoo that thing started looking good right and the finished product it looks real good but they got to give it the final test put some oil and some gas in it and crank it up and he says oh that baby running real good it's amazing right amen but if you would you as they were before united and connected by boats it was just a pile of junk that's how the body of christ was just a pile of junk but the mechanic the holy spirit is putting it all together and every cylinder is going to work everything in this car let me tell you something people before it's all over these people who have mocked us and laughed and made fun they're going to see who god has chosen for his bride i'm not saying everybody who identify themselves with william branham is going to make it either there's a lot that won't because they're not hearing it they're slumbering still you're not taking heat to the warning it's so late in the evening it makes me nervous i got so many things that needs to be done in my life and i know it's only by the mercies and grace of god it's going to be done but there is no quitting there is no giving up there is no surrender because in the depths of my heart i know who i am it doesn't matter how the devil tried to deceive me and things and make me think i am not but god says i am hallelujah let's pray father god we come before you we thank you for your grace and your mercy thank you for being so good to us lord we are in you and you are in us that's what makes us who we are none of us can declare these things of our own only because you said so and because you say so we believe it we receive you told mary she was going to have the christ child she wasn't the only virgin it wasn't because she lived much cleaner than the others they were virgins but you selected her you chose her from the foundation of the world and when isaiah was speaking that word a virgin shall conceive it sent out that message it sent out the seed it sent out a word that would create this little baby girl in somebody's womb it protected her through all her life no doubt she had temptations and of some sort of kind but god you kept her you kept her faith in church because the word said so it was your plan it was her destiny and you made it come to pass now we know her amen and all christians will and don't do
