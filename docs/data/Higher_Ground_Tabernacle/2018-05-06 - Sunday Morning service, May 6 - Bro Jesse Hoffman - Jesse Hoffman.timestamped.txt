[4:00] reason I see I love you I love you my
[4:11] love Hey
[4:24] you
[4:35] good to see everyone here today so good
[4:40] to see everyone I think last week I was
[4:43] just sharing with the brothers this
[4:44] morning we had Bible study there at the
[4:46] coffee shop and had an opportunity many
[4:51] years ago when a young man was about 14
[4:54] years old to be asked by his parents if
[4:58] I would be his overseer should anything
[5:03] ever happen to them then he flew a lot
[5:06] and they were very concerned about
[5:08] leaving their son without a guardian and
[5:11] my wife and I agreed to that and went on
[5:15] later on to really enjoy the opportunity
[5:20] had felt like I had a good ear and good
[5:23] way to train him even though his parents
[5:25] were still living and and as time went
[5:30] on he was given responsibilities within
[5:33] the company and I started hearing things
[5:37] come out of his mouth that were not good
[5:39] and it just really grieved me and I
[5:43] found as I looked back my prayer life
[5:46] changing for him sadly enough that it
[5:49] was not one of suddenly captive free and
[5:55] one of Lord break the chains loosen the
[6:00] bands of darkness but it was one of Lord
[6:04] go after him second you know it was one
[6:08] was not by at all God inspired and I
[6:12] hope this is a testimony for someone
[6:15] else
[6:15] but as what as the Lord showed me about
[6:20] a week ago he said didn't I deliver this
[6:23] young man to you when he was 14 and now
[6:27] you're praying against him and it really
[6:31] it really hit home caused me to repent
[6:34] and cause my prayer life to change
[6:37] dramatically this past week and funny
[6:41] isn't when you should praying for
[6:43] somebody how the joy and
[6:46] comes through in their face when you
[6:48] greet them it wasn't the joy wasn't
[6:50] there before it was grievious and that
[6:53] was me I was being Grievous to him
[6:56] I was not praying for him I was not
[7:00] bringing joy to him I was not showing
[7:02] him that there was something in the
[7:06] atmosphere that was causing him to be of
[7:09] joy and the whole week was that way
[7:11] every time I would greet each other in
[7:13] the hallway and holy cubes grinning at
[7:15] me huh and it's just I just thank God
[7:19] for setting me free in my thinking and I
[7:24] trust that you know somewhere you can
[7:26] find this in your own life you know he
[7:30] was just let me help without pointing
[7:32] the finger at him he was cursing I had a
[7:37] young man that was hired and Lord led me
[7:41] to witness to him and he said eight
[7:43] don't don't witness to him you're gonna
[7:45] scare him off he'll leave and so things
[7:48] like that were happening in it and I
[7:51] succumbed under that type of
[7:54] conversation and didn't take the high
[7:58] road
[7:59] so I thank God for being able to share
[8:02] that with this morning and thank you for
[8:03] listening

[36:32] from from Minnesota and kind of neat how
[36:36] the Lord works I was here actually a
[36:37] week and a half ago I was actually down
[36:40] here in Des Moines doing some work for
[36:42] the Army National Guard
[36:43] and so I met with with brother Adam I
[36:45] know Adam you know from his days his
[36:48] earlier days and and then stopped by for
[36:51] service on Wednesday
[36:53] had a really good time with brother
[36:54] Isaiah enjoyed the service and you know
[36:58] just turned out that he needed a little
[37:00] bit extra help so I'm glad to glad that
[37:03] I can do that glad that I can you know
[37:05] come alongside and and fill in and
[37:08] support God's people so I just want to
[37:11] again just say thank you for the
[37:13] opportunity to be here I appreciate
[37:15] brother Isaiah my father is a minister
[37:17] so I bring greetings from our church we
[37:20] have a little fellowship much like this
[37:21] in in Hopkins Minnesota so if you are
[37:25] ever up that way please reach out and
[37:28] say hi we'd love to have you and so yeah
[37:33] I know anyway my my father being a
[37:36] pastor you know I really appreciate
[37:38] brother Isaiah you know the how he stood
[37:41] at his post through the years and I know
[37:44] the toils and the labors and the strains
[37:49] and all those things that come with
[37:50] being in this position so again just
[37:53] want to want to mention that and say how
[37:56] much I appreciate my brother so amen do
[37:59] you love the Lord well I tell you what
[38:02] it's you remember that old song he's
[38:04] still working on me to make me what I
[38:06] ought to be aren't you thankful for that
[38:08] his patience and I'd like to just bring
[38:11] out some things that the Lord put on my
[38:12] heart this morning I trust that it would
[38:14] be an encouragement to you and and it
[38:16] would stir you up you know sometimes
[38:18] there's a lot of things we just we got
[38:19] to be reminded of sometimes we've got to
[38:21] we've got somebody to come along and
[38:23] tell us maybe there's things we know of
[38:25] course but we got to be reminded and so
[38:28] I just pray that the Holy Spirit again
[38:30] not counting on myself but the Holy
[38:32] Spirit would stir up your hearts and
[38:33] minds this morning and that maybe he
[38:36] would just you know tune your hearts and
[38:38] your focus your vision a little more are
[38:40] you looking at the right thing are you
[38:42] looking at what God's Word says of you
[38:45] are you looking at something else what
[38:47] are we looking at so as we go through
[38:50] the scriptures and some things this
[38:51] morning that's again that's why I'll
[38:53] probably repeat some things that's okay
[38:55] but my goal my heart's desires that you
[38:58] would be just encouraged up that the
[39:00] Holy Spirit would again would magnify
[39:04] himself and I know in that process
[39:07] you know you'll be blessed and I love
[39:11] the word of God don't you you know it's
[39:14] it never we can just continually reach
[39:18] in and pull out and draw and fill
[39:21] ourselves up that's the reality my
[39:24] confidence is in God's Word and that
[39:27] he's got more for us every day now the
[39:29] reality is I believe truly with all of
[39:31] my heart you and I could open the Bible
[39:34] we could read for example maybe Noah the
[39:35] book of you know read the story of Noah
[39:37] and you would be blessed every single
[39:39] time we open this word there's something
[39:41] more for us I do believe that so let's
[39:44] just approach the Word of God with
[39:45] confidence this morning if you would
[39:48] stand I'm sorry I had you sit there for
[39:49] a minute but stand and turn with me to
[39:52] first John chapter 3 and verse 1 okay
[40:07] and verse
[40:07] he says behold what manner of love the
[40:10] father hath bestowed upon us that we
[40:13] should be called the sons of God amen
[40:16] what what an amazing thing therefore the
[40:20] world knoweth us not because it knew him
[40:22] not okay
[40:24] verse 2 says behold now now watch the
[40:27] tents he says now we are the sons of God
[40:30] aren't you thankful for that and it does
[40:33] not yet appear what we shall be so we've
[40:36] got watch the tenses present and future
[40:39] now we are the sons of God and he's
[40:42] talking about what we shall be we know
[40:44] that when he shall appear we shall be
[40:47] like him like him for we shall see him
[40:52] as he is and then verse 3 says and every
[40:54] man that hath this hope in him in him
[40:57] purifies himself even as he is pure all
[41:01] right and then while you're standing
[41:02] let's turn also to the book of John
[41:04] chapter 1 and just we're gonna okay
[41:16] verse just verse 12 so chapter 1 and
[41:21] verse 12 says but as many as received
[41:25] him to them gave he power and and the
[41:30] word there is the right or the privilege
[41:32] the power to become sons of God even to
[41:36] them that believe on his name amen you
[41:38] can be seated this morning so I just
[41:41] want to dwell on those two verses that
[41:42] we read first John chapter 3 and how it
[41:46] says we now we are the sons of God that
[41:49] reality that now we are the sons of God
[41:52] and we have to again we have to examine
[41:54] ourselves what am I looking at when I
[41:56] think of myself being a son of God am I
[41:59] looking at my flesh am I looking at
[42:01] something else or am I looking what God
[42:03] God's Word says and so I want to dwell
[42:06] in dwell on that for a minute and really
[42:10] capture if I can just trusting the Lord
[42:12] to to convey this to you but to see the
[42:15] potentials of what you have now what's
[42:19] inside of you of who you are
[42:21] right now and yet also looking at this
[42:25] maybe future tense or present and future
[42:27] tense this reality of us becoming sons
[42:31] so you are sons and you're becoming sons
[42:35] right there's a development there's a
[42:37] maturing there's a process that God is
[42:40] working out by his Holy Spirit in us
[42:42] bringing us into the image and likeness
[42:45] of his son amen that's what we're called
[42:48] to you love him amen what do you again
[42:52] what are you looking at this morning
[42:53] don't look at yourself don't look it's
[42:56] yourself look at what God's Word says
[42:58] about you if you look at yourself you're
[43:00] gonna fall you're gonna fail every time
[43:03] so we got to remind ourselves of these
[43:06] things keeping our eyes on who we are
[43:09] what he says about us what he's called
[43:11] us to let's look at another passage here
[43:13] I want to turn to first Corinthians
[43:15] chapter 15 just again some familiar text
[43:21] here but I think it just kind of fits in
[43:24] here with the prince the principal that
[43:27] we're bringing out first Corinthians
[43:28] chapter 15 okay and let's start with
[43:35] verse 45 I think it's a beautiful
[43:38] picture here that we we can see and you
[43:41] know this this particular passage you
[43:44] know is got a lot of different a lot of
[43:47] different ways maybe it might be used
[43:48] but I want to use it maybe in a
[43:50] different way this morning so first 45
[43:51] says and so it was written the first man
[43:54] Adam was made a living soul the last
[43:58] Adam was made a quickening spirit
[44:00] howbeit that was not first which is
[44:03] spiritual but that which is natural and
[44:05] afterward that which is spiritual the
[44:08] first man is a is of the earth earthy
[44:10] the second man is the lord from heaven
[44:12] and as is as as is the earthy such are
[44:17] they also that are earthy and as is the
[44:20] heavenly such are they also that are
[44:23] heavenly and now verse 49 which I think
[44:27] is just so beautiful to me
[44:28] and as we have borne the image of the
[44:32] earthy we shall also bear the
[44:35] heavenly I believe that's for us right
[44:38] now I believe there is compound
[44:39] fulfillment yes where there is going to
[44:41] be a body change there's going to be
[44:43] this these great things but for right
[44:45] now this nature this inner man this
[44:48] character is going to reflect the
[44:50] heavenly and and what at what an age we
[44:53] live in when the fullness of the word
[44:55] has been delivered to produce this in a
[44:57] people you know in in previous ages
[45:00] there was a part there was a shadow
[45:01] there was a there was there's a sliver
[45:03] but now we have the fullness to produce
[45:05] the fullness of Jesus Christ among his
[45:07] people amen
[45:09] I love that so again what are you
[45:13] looking at so let's talk about now we
[45:16] are the sons of God now we are the sons
[45:19] of God where does life begin it all
[45:22] starts in seed form what is God's seed
[45:25] it's his word
[45:27] just for a little bit again a bit of a
[45:29] foundation it's familiar but let's turn
[45:31] back to Genesis chapter 1 and let's look
[45:35] back at the the principle of life really
[45:37] the seed principle Genesis chapter 1 and
[45:41] verse 11 he says here and God said let
[45:49] the earth bring forth grass the herb
[45:53] yielding seed and the fruit tree
[45:55] yielding fruit after his kind whose seed
[45:57] is in itself
[45:59] Amen upon the earth and it was so and
[46:02] the earth brought forth grass and herb
[46:05] yielding seed after his kind and the
[46:09] tree the tree yielding fruit whose seed
[46:11] was in itself after his kind and God saw
[46:14] that it was good the seed is in itself
[46:17] and it produces after its own it
[46:20] produces its own likeness
[46:22] the seed is in itself and we can look at
[46:24] God what is God going to produce sons of
[46:27] God guess what they're gonna look like
[46:29] they're gonna look like god they're
[46:31] gonna walk like god they're gonna talk
[46:33] like God so we can look at ourselves we
[46:36] identify with ourselves our the life of
[46:38] God that's in us and if I could let's
[46:41] take a step back let's talk about how we
[46:45] are a three-room house right the Prophet
[46:47] tells us body
[46:48] soul spirit now those outer two
[46:52] dimensions those outer two realms give
[46:54] us all kinds of trouble and that's again
[46:58] don't look at those things he's in a
[47:00] process of redeeming us and ruling and
[47:04] replacing those senses and those things
[47:06] with himself to where we're completely
[47:08] governed by his holy spirit what's the
[47:11] real you it's that inside man the seed
[47:13] soul germ of God the gene gene of God
[47:17] amen so what is that going to produce
[47:20] its gonna produce God God and his people
[47:23] so again the the points that I'll just
[47:26] continue to reiterate here is we are now
[47:29] sons what's in you what's in you is God
[47:31] in seed form and because that is God you
[47:35] can hear and you can see and you can
[47:38] recognize now you can get troubled you
[47:41] can get turned all upside down looking
[47:44] at the wrong thing but what did Jesus
[47:46] said he he said my sheep know my voice
[47:51] isn't that awesome he had done
[47:54] identified his people and he said my
[47:55] sheep know my voice
[47:57] that's your identification now you could
[48:00] be a chicken you can be scratching
[48:02] around in the manure you can be in the
[48:03] barnyard like we all are you can be in a
[48:05] pretty rough condition but when that
[48:07] word strikes you recognize it because
[48:10] you're his seed amen you are now the
[48:13] sons of God so we want to look at that
[48:15] again the potential if I could say that
[48:18] the potential of his life in you his
[48:21] seed in you and it's got to be expressed
[48:24] it's going to express itself okay now I
[48:28] want to share some things this is from
[48:31] the message identification he says
[48:35] brother Branham says in the beginning
[48:36] was God he wasn't even God then no God
[48:39] is an object of worship only thing he
[48:41] was was the eternal and in him was
[48:44] attributes and those attributes were
[48:46] thoughts and those thoughts were it was
[48:48] expressed to words and word was made
[48:51] manifest what is it it's all listen he
[48:54] says it's all God becoming tangible and
[48:59] and you are a part of God
[49:03] there you go that's your identity he
[49:06] says and Jesus come to redeem those that
[49:08] was put on the Lamb's Book of Life
[49:10] before the foundation of the world so
[49:13] really when we're looking at ourselves
[49:14] we're going back we're going back to
[49:17] that beginning we're seeing who we are
[49:18] in Christ and we again by God by His
[49:22] grace and the Prophet he gives us a
[49:25] vision of what he's called us to the
[49:27] vision that God had in his mind God with
[49:31] his family God with sons and daughters
[49:34] and listen it's like the saying says I'm
[49:37] not what I ought to be I'm not what I
[49:39] used to be praise God
[49:40] but he's making me what he wants me to
[49:42] be Amen it's him working and I think in
[49:47] in life what I found and I know every
[49:49] one of you we were in different stages
[49:50] of course but what we find is that the
[49:54] there's so much in just simply
[49:57] surrendering you know I I think the
[50:02] Lord's continually working with us and
[50:04] in stages of surrender and you know we
[50:08] come to something something we face
[50:09] within ourselves some kind of struggle
[50:11] or a trial their self that's got to go
[50:15] and so that you know there's victory
[50:18] honestly there's victory in surrender
[50:20] the more we can yield the more we submit
[50:23] the more we die to ourselves the more he
[50:26] can take over so that's that beautiful
[50:28] working of His grace that he's working
[50:30] out in us amen so let's again let's go
[50:34] back to what he says here he says only
[50:36] those thought he's talking about the
[50:39] word being expressed becoming tangible
[50:41] and you are a part of God now to think
[50:45] about that let's let's look at the word
[50:46] even to recognize right to recognize the
[50:50] Word of God what does the word recognize
[50:53] me just in simplicity just pure
[50:55] dictionary definition recognize is to
[50:59] recollect or recover knowledge of either
[51:03] with an avowal
[51:04] of that knowledge or not we recognize a
[51:06] person at a distance when we recollect
[51:08] we have seen them before okay so how can
[51:13] you recognize because you're a part of
[51:15] him already
[51:16] amen brother branham said 'i said in the
[51:19] message who is this Melchizedek he said
[51:21] then after you recognized the very word
[51:24] of God was eagle food then you left the
[51:27] other thing you have been formed into
[51:29] the living image of the Living God
[51:31] you've heard from your theophany oh my
[51:35] goodness do you see who you are do you
[51:38] see who you're a part of amen you're a
[51:41] part of him in his life that seed again
[51:44] that word which is that seed cannot fail
[51:47] it's going to press itself and it's
[51:50] going to produce exactly what he said
[51:52] and what he ordained okay now this is
[51:56] this is beautiful this is from the
[51:58] message future home he says if you got
[52:01] eternal life I know we've heard these
[52:03] things but it's it's beautiful it's
[52:05] precious he says there's only one form
[52:07] that's God and you're an expressed
[52:09] attribute okay he said so see if you
[52:13] it's if you're not you're not gonna be
[52:15] there anyhow no man can come to me
[52:17] except my father has drawn him see which
[52:20] passes away all these things these don't
[52:22] so it speaks of eternity he says the
[52:24] Holy Ghost
[52:25] he's eternity then you are in eternity
[52:29] amen
[52:30] you are in eternity where you was all
[52:32] the time but you've just recognized what
[52:35] happened oh my lord open our eyes don't
[52:38] you feel sometimes like we're just
[52:40] awakening to these things oh I love it
[52:43] he says see you were made for an eternal
[52:45] purpose an eternal purpose that because
[52:48] you was the manifestation of an
[52:51] attribute that was in God that thought
[52:54] of you and expressed you you are an
[52:56] attribute of God expressed now if we can
[52:59] take the confidence in God's Word
[53:02] knowing that God's Word cannot fail
[53:04] cannot pass away and apply it to that
[53:07] same life inside of us it's gonna it
[53:11] can't do anything but express his life
[53:13] and bring out what he ordained amen
[53:17] okay moving on he says in this is in the
[53:20] message God's power to transform listen
[53:24] to this just the way he puts this as far
[53:26] as the seed life and the power that God
[53:30] places in that seed he says now God in
[53:34] 6000 years had planted all these
[53:36] wonderful seeds or he had spoke his word
[53:39] it should be this way this tree shall be
[53:42] this shall be everything was perfect it
[53:44] was just good and he commanded each one
[53:47] of those seeds what they that they would
[53:49] be now listen he says that they would
[53:51] transform themselves into the plan of
[53:54] life a plan of which kind of life the
[53:57] Word of God had spoken in them should be
[53:59] right see that potential in there you
[54:01] see it as if it was an oak tree it's
[54:03] gonna bring forth an oak if it was a
[54:04] palm it's gonna bring forth a palm
[54:06] because the Great Creator had just sent
[54:10] forth his word and the word seed there
[54:13] was there before the real seed was ever
[54:15] formed and the word formed the seed okay
[54:19] he made the world out of things that
[54:22] does not appear okay so is is he talking
[54:25] about simply creation well yeah he's
[54:27] talking about creation he's talking
[54:28] about so much more
[54:29] he's talking about us amen the seed word
[54:33] of God of life in inside of us it can't
[54:35] do anything but do but Express and bring
[54:38] produce what he said it would amen
[54:41] okay and then further on he says now
[54:43] same message God's power to transform go
[54:46] go look it up go read it please it's
[54:48] it's just wonderful he says the seed can
[54:50] only come forth with the power of life
[54:53] within it to transform it from a seed to
[54:55] a plant or whatever it was he said his
[54:58] transforming power God put the seed in
[55:03] there with the potentials that it would
[55:05] be exactly what he said it would be amen
[55:08] now that's you look at yourself this
[55:10] morning okay what are you looking at
[55:13] what are you identifying in all right
[55:16] and then further on again he says the
[55:19] same thing he says each one of those
[55:20] seeds has the power in itself to
[55:24] transform itself into the specie that I
[55:26] desire it to be oh isn't that beautiful
[55:29] God's passion his heart and his desire
[55:32] for his family
[55:33] it's going to express him amen that's
[55:36] what it must be because I've given every
[55:38] seed transforming power to make itself
[55:42] out it
[55:44] the potentials now to make itself
[55:45] exactly what I want it to be you see
[55:49] that the potentials of his work in you
[55:52] because you are a part of him and you
[55:54] are that seed and his word cannot fail
[55:57] so do you again we find a resting place
[56:00] I would have again by the Holy Spirit I
[56:02] trust just Lord direct our hearts into
[56:05] your word are we looking at ourselves
[56:07] are we seeing ourselves in the right way
[56:09] don't identify with the enemy you know
[56:13] the enemy he's a thief he Rob's he
[56:16] steals he kills and he's injecting
[56:19] nonsense into your head all day long
[56:22] reject him deny him and stay with what
[56:25] God says amen his word cannot fail so we
[56:31] can look at these things again this seed
[56:33] word life of God and we can say I'm
[56:36] gonna be successful if I can put it that
[56:38] way
[56:39] I am the guaranteed success of God's
[56:41] Word in me to produce what he said he
[56:45] can't fail so I'm just resting in him
[56:47] it's not up to me not something I can
[56:49] perform not something I could put on or
[56:51] do but it's his seed word life inside of
[56:54] me expressing itself amen let's just go
[56:57] back in the scriptures Isaiah chapter 55
[57:01] now we owe just with with these things
[57:05] in mind I love it
[57:08] let's let's look at this scripture
[57:10] Isaiah 55 and verse 10 says for as the
[57:20] rain cometh down and the snow from
[57:23] heaven and return if not hither but
[57:26] watereth the earth and maketh it bring
[57:29] forth and bud that it may give seed to
[57:31] the sower and bread to the eater verse
[57:34] 11 so shall my word be that goeth forth
[57:38] out of my mouth it shall not return to
[57:41] me void amen but it shall accomplish
[57:45] that which I please and it shall prosper
[57:47] in the thing whereto I sent it you see
[57:51] that word it's got to strike the target
[57:53] it's got to do and produce exactly what
[57:56] he said it cannot fail
[57:57] so again we see these things and we can
[58:00] say Lord that concerns me the seed of
[58:03] God that spoken word attribute that's in
[58:06] me is gonna produce that's all there is
[58:08] to it
[58:08] amen turning back and you don't have to
[58:12] turn I'm going to go through a few but
[58:13] just a chapter back you know again Luis
[58:16] these things in mind what rest we can
[58:19] have what rest just just a chapter back
[58:22] there of isaiah 54:17 says no weapon
[58:25] that is formed against thee will prosper
[58:28] okay why cuz it's God God can't fail his
[58:31] word can't fail now I always like to
[58:33] look at that and remind myself it
[58:35] doesn't say that no weapon will be
[58:37] formed against you we know all hell is
[58:39] against this you're gonna battle but no
[58:42] weapon formed against you will prosper
[58:44] because his word cannot fail his word is
[58:47] gonna succeed his word is gonna produce
[58:49] what he promised amen oh he's so
[58:53] wonderful let's turn back and again in
[58:55] Isaiah chapter 27 and so we're looking
[58:58] at this seed this seed that is you that
[59:01] is God and his life and look at this
[59:05] just this picture here in Isaiah chapter
[59:07] 27 to see God's care and his attention
[59:11] if you will and is how he watches in
[59:13] Isaiah 27 verse 2 says in that day
[59:17] seeing ye unto her a vineyard of red
[59:20] wine now look at 3 it so beautifully
[59:21] says I the Lord do keep it I will water
[59:25] it every moment lest any heard it I will
[59:29] keep it day and night that is his love
[59:31] and his care and his attention for you
[59:34] for his own seed it's not can I make it
[59:37] can I keep it can I am I gonna succeed
[59:39] oh no what about no God is gonna keep it
[59:42] it's his seed he'll watch over it he's
[59:44] gonna water it and it will produce
[59:46] exactly what he said amen don't you love
[59:49] him okay now these are these are
[59:53] something the again this is from a
[59:55] message the unconditional covenant that
[59:58] God made with his people now with what
[1:00:00] we just covered I think this is so
[1:00:02] fitting just listen to what the Prophet
[1:00:05] says here he says so the Pentecostal
[1:00:07] people do you see that that's you he
[1:00:10] says the others can't believe
[1:00:11] they have nothing in them to believe
[1:00:14] with see okay so there's that seed that
[1:00:16] can hear that can receive that city's
[1:00:18] talking about he says but the trouble of
[1:00:23] it is you've got it and you don't know
[1:00:25] it oh god help us stir up our our
[1:00:28] thinking our eyes right he says if the
[1:00:31] devil he says if you can get it and he
[1:00:32] can hide it from you not let you know
[1:00:35] what you've got what you've got what you
[1:00:38] have already amen he's got you licked
[1:00:41] right so that's why again I brought what
[1:00:43] are you looking at consider these things
[1:00:46] he says now listen he says you can't
[1:00:49] fail there's no way of failing you're
[1:00:53] Abraham's seed that's amen praise the
[1:00:56] Lord why because God can't fail it's his
[1:00:59] word what he promised he says God has
[1:01:01] sworn with an oath that he'd take you in
[1:01:04] okay then later on he says the same
[1:01:07] thing he says listen you are the
[1:01:10] Covenant people of God God tore apart
[1:01:13] Christ at Calvary making the covenant
[1:01:16] swearing by himself he took the body
[1:01:18] into heaven which will return someday
[1:01:20] but the Spirit he gave back to lead the
[1:01:23] church okay the same life that was in
[1:01:27] Christ Jesus is in the church tonight by
[1:01:29] the Holy Ghost doing and acting and
[1:01:31] performing the same things that he did
[1:01:34] when he was here on earth okay you've
[1:01:37] received it listen to what he says again
[1:01:39] you've received it you've got the
[1:01:41] Covenant it's written to you swore by
[1:01:44] God here it is again he says you can't
[1:01:47] fail that makes the devil mad let's make
[1:01:52] the bed a devil mad this morning tell
[1:01:54] him I can't fail amen I can't fail sure
[1:01:59] does he says it makes him mad when you
[1:02:00] realize you are who you are it's him
[1:02:05] it's his life his seed don't you see the
[1:02:09] potentials now we are the sons of God
[1:02:12] what lies within you to produce itself
[1:02:14] that seed okay so that's that's the
[1:02:17] first part that I wanted to bring out
[1:02:19] again is just emphasize that reality of
[1:02:22] the potentials the security
[1:02:25] of that seed life word of God inside of
[1:02:28] you and as we read now let's look at the
[1:02:31] next part of this as we read in John
[1:02:33] chapter one he's given us the power to
[1:02:36] become sons so we are sons amen but we
[1:02:41] are becoming sons again what is that
[1:02:43] referring to it's God by His Holy Spirit
[1:02:46] by His grace effective working in the
[1:02:50] lives of his pre people bringing us into
[1:02:52] a place where we are conformed to the
[1:02:55] image of his son because if we couldn't
[1:02:58] just say okay there is a seed and here
[1:03:01] goes a man walking and talking but boy
[1:03:03] he sure doesn't know he's gonna have a
[1:03:05] family that looks like him
[1:03:07] that walks like and talks like him so
[1:03:10] there's this amazing beautiful process
[1:03:13] of the working of his grace bringing all
[1:03:16] things under his Dominion bringing it
[1:03:20] into a place where listen Lord I'm all
[1:03:23] yours and he completely conquers and
[1:03:26] rules and has dominion over every part
[1:03:29] of our life every part of our body I
[1:03:31] mean that's his desire to have that
[1:03:34] preeminence in his people okay so let's
[1:03:38] look at that again because you are sons
[1:03:40] his spirit and his grace will be working
[1:03:43] in your bringing total submission total
[1:03:46] surrender total conformity to God's Word
[1:03:49] amen
[1:03:50] the fruit of this age think about it the
[1:03:54] fruit of this his word what is he
[1:03:57] looking for in this day he's sown a seed
[1:03:59] he's spoken
[1:04:00] he's given us a word what is that word
[1:04:02] going to produce what is he looking for
[1:04:04] he's looking for himself reproduced in
[1:04:08] his bride that's for you that's for each
[1:04:10] one of us Amen reproducing himself in
[1:04:14] his children amen again I love it let's
[1:04:18] turn with me to Romans chapter 8 as we
[1:04:20] go through some scriptures here and see
[1:04:23] that that process of becoming sons it's
[1:04:26] all over the the scriptures of course
[1:04:27] but we'll just pick out a few and do our
[1:04:30] best to bring it out we're gonna we're
[1:04:33] gonna touch on Romans 8 up quite a bit
[1:04:36] because there's so much here in terms of
[1:04:37] you know adoption
[1:04:39] that maturing and and and becoming sons
[1:04:42] but he says let's let's read in Romans
[1:04:44] eight and verse 29 for whom he did
[1:04:47] foreknow again going back to the
[1:04:50] beginning what God had in his mind for
[1:04:52] you he also did predestinate to be
[1:04:56] conformed to the image of his son amen
[1:05:00] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:05:01] many brethren so that's the image that's
[1:05:06] what God is working towards and
[1:05:08] producing amen
[1:05:09] and it's sometimes these things are
[1:05:12] painful you know the Bible tells us that
[1:05:13] that correction for example he says it's
[1:05:16] not pleasant but you know what it's
[1:05:18] yielding the peaceable fruits of
[1:05:20] righteousness
[1:05:21] okay so endure because you are sons you
[1:05:24] can take it I love our brother parade
[1:05:26] wheel of Correction it's in us it's in
[1:05:29] us we can take it and and he's gonna
[1:05:32] take us through those dry seasons he's
[1:05:35] gonna take us through the valleys he's
[1:05:37] gonna take us through the deserts this
[1:05:38] isn't all you know if I can just use the
[1:05:41] term beige sunshine and rainbows God's
[1:05:44] gonna pretty he's gonna work through
[1:05:45] some tough times in your life to bring
[1:05:47] out what he needs to bring out and each
[1:05:49] one of us are gonna have a different
[1:05:51] path but God knows what he's doing and
[1:05:53] he he knows exactly what to work in you
[1:05:56] and and what to bring your way to
[1:05:59] produce something a little more
[1:06:00] submission a little more of him amen
[1:06:03] amen he's wonderful turn with me to John
[1:06:07] chapter 17 again there's a lot we could
[1:06:11] draw from this this passage here but
[1:06:14] we're just gonna pick focus I guess on
[1:06:17] one one verse here John 17 and verse 22
[1:06:22] it says and the glory which thou has
[1:06:26] given me I have given them that they may
[1:06:29] be one as we are one amen you're called
[1:06:34] to that and you look at that it's so
[1:06:36] rich you look at that word glory
[1:06:38] it's values opinions judgments we're
[1:06:43] gonna have the same mind we're gonna
[1:06:45] have that same glory the same the same
[1:06:47] heart the same nature and
[1:06:48] characteristics of Jesus Christ and
[1:06:51] that's how the
[1:06:52] we'll know were one Amen and I would
[1:06:55] just encourage you brothers and sisters
[1:06:56] as we go through these things be patient
[1:07:00] be patient with God be patient with one
[1:07:04] another God waters he we as we read he
[1:07:08] watches over that seed he waters it it's
[1:07:10] gonna produce in the time in the way and
[1:07:13] the season he meant for it but you've
[1:07:15] got to be patient patient again with him
[1:07:18] with one another okay let's let's move
[1:07:22] on Romans actually let's go back to
[1:07:25] Romans eight I'm sorry we were just
[1:07:26] there
[1:07:38] and he's still working on me right to
[1:07:40] make me what I ought to be love it
[1:07:43] praise the Lord Romans chapter 8 and
[1:07:47] here we go let's let's actually look at
[1:07:50] verse 18 kind of as we were just
[1:07:52] referring to there the sufferings it
[1:07:54] says verse 18 for I reckon that the
[1:07:56] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:07:59] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:08:02] which shall be revealed in you in me in
[1:08:07] us amen and 19 for the earnest
[1:08:10] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[1:08:12] the manifestation manifestation of sons
[1:08:16] of God amen so we've talked about birth
[1:08:20] we talked about our identity that seed
[1:08:22] life of God but he's saying here that
[1:08:24] creation is waiting for that
[1:08:25] manifestation not about the birth of
[1:08:28] sons but manifestation of sons okay
[1:08:31] that's what we're called to I like to
[1:08:35] take let's go back in in the Old
[1:08:36] Testament here Isaiah I'm sorry David
[1:08:39] Psalms chapter 9 yes 90 and I've loved
[1:08:44] this but I think this takes on a whole
[1:08:46] new light based on what we just talked
[1:08:50] about here what we've been looking at
[1:08:52] Psalms chapter 90 in verse 17 it says
[1:08:57] look at this it says and let the beauty
[1:09:00] of the Lord our God be upon us amen it's
[1:09:05] going to be because your sons because
[1:09:07] your daughters you are gonna look like
[1:09:09] him you're going to express his beauty
[1:09:11] amen and look what follows he says and
[1:09:14] establish okay he doesn't stop there he
[1:09:16] says and establish now the work of our
[1:09:18] hands okay so he's working in our lives
[1:09:21] every part of our makeup to produce to
[1:09:25] reproduce himself in us amen don't you
[1:09:29] love him let's keep going
[1:09:32] let's turn to Hebrews chapter 13 again
[1:09:36] I'm just I'm just picking a few things
[1:09:37] but you can see these principles all
[1:09:39] through the scriptures the end of the
[1:09:41] end of the book there Hebrews chapter 13
[1:09:43] and it says let's just start in we'll
[1:09:48] start with verse 20 there
[1:09:51] says now the god of peace that brought
[1:09:53] again from the dead our Lord Jesus the
[1:09:56] great Shepherd of the sheep through the
[1:09:58] blood of the everlasting covenant now
[1:10:01] that's oh that's beautiful through keep
[1:10:03] that hold that tight through the blood
[1:10:06] of the everlasting covenant make you
[1:10:08] perfect
[1:10:08] we're in every good work to do his will
[1:10:13] amen just like Jesus there you go being
[1:10:16] conformed to the image of the son he
[1:10:18] said I can do nothing until my father
[1:10:20] shows me I can do nothing of myself and
[1:10:22] he's going to do the same thing in us
[1:10:24] working in us what that which is well
[1:10:26] pleasing in his sight making you perfect
[1:10:29] in every good work hey there goes Jesus
[1:10:33] Christ right there there goes Jesus
[1:10:34] Christ we are gonna reflect him amen
[1:10:37] that's what we're called to that's
[1:10:39] what's inside us amen let's keep going
[1:10:44] Philippians chapter 3 and you say again
[1:10:51] how does this happen it's it's his
[1:10:54] business he's gonna work in each one of
[1:10:56] us in his own way and his own timing to
[1:10:59] bring us into that place of submission
[1:11:01] and surrender and if he I'm sorry
[1:11:05] Philippians chapter 4 3 I said three and
[1:11:08] verse 20 says for our conversation is in
[1:11:12] heaven our conduct our manner of life is
[1:11:14] actually what that means our is in
[1:11:16] heaven from once we also look for the
[1:11:19] Savior the Lord Jesus Christ verse 21
[1:11:23] who shall change our vile body that it
[1:11:27] be be fashioned we're talking likeness
[1:11:29] like him like unto his glorious body
[1:11:32] how according to the working working
[1:11:36] continual amen by his Spirit continually
[1:11:40] whereby he is able even to subdue all
[1:11:43] things to himself there it is it's
[1:11:46] personal its individual him inside each
[1:11:49] one of us working bringing about that
[1:11:52] submission subduing all things in my
[1:11:55] life under his headship and his Dominion
[1:11:58] in his control a man that's what you're
[1:12:00] called to he gave him to be the head
[1:12:03] over
[1:12:04] things to the church amen he is our head
[1:12:08] and he said doing every part of our
[1:12:11] lives amen so that he can be displayed
[1:12:13] he can be reflected in and manifested
[1:12:17] through us amen
[1:12:19] and I love in back there and again be
[1:12:22] patient be patient brothers and sisters
[1:12:24] be patient with each other patient with
[1:12:27] God he says in you know Philippians 1 if
[1:12:30] you want to turn back there even it's
[1:12:31] verse 6 he says being confident of this
[1:12:35] very thing that he which began a good
[1:12:38] work is going to perform it I love the
[1:12:42] word that comes next
[1:12:42] until ok it means as long as we're here
[1:12:46] he's got more for us as long as we're
[1:12:49] here he's continuing to work he's going
[1:12:51] to perform it until the day of Jesus
[1:12:54] Christ amen his word cannot fail you are
[1:12:59] sons you are becoming sons amen here he
[1:13:04] says this is this isn't the message
[1:13:07] adoption there's again there's so much
[1:13:11] here I couldn't even begin to capture it
[1:13:13] all but he says an invert paragraph 150
[1:13:18] ASIS what's everything waiting on what's
[1:13:21] the whole creation waiting for the
[1:13:23] manifestation of the sons of God it's
[1:13:26] waiting for the church to come into its
[1:13:28] position amen
[1:13:30] who was the son of God when Adam where
[1:13:33] he where was his domain the earth he had
[1:13:35] dominion over the earth is that right he
[1:13:39] was he wasn't lla Elohim then he was
[1:13:43] Jehovah see now listen I love he says
[1:13:46] this that is he said I am God and I've
[1:13:49] made some lesser ones underneath me and
[1:13:52] I have given them dominion and in their
[1:13:55] Dominion the Dominion under them is the
[1:13:57] earth man had dominion over the earth
[1:13:59] and all the whole creation is waiting
[1:14:02] for the sons of God to be manifested
[1:14:06] amen we're watching amen he says later
[1:14:10] on he says is that right what waiting
[1:14:12] God is trying to place his church in
[1:14:14] position to manifest himself
[1:14:18] getting that one that he can work
[1:14:20] through like this say there's my spirit
[1:14:22] flowing freely oh my goodness don't you
[1:14:25] just let you rejoice and you just say
[1:14:28] yes Lord that's what I was meant for
[1:14:29] that's what you were meant for that's
[1:14:31] what you're called for to reflect him to
[1:14:34] be a body that he can he can flow
[1:14:36] through like that oh let me read that
[1:14:39] again he says he says God is trying to
[1:14:44] place his his church in position to
[1:14:46] manifest himself getting one that he can
[1:14:49] work through like this say there's my
[1:14:50] spirit flowing freely there it is he
[1:14:54] says then I can work here's an here
[1:14:56] get another one over here and place him
[1:14:57] I can place him play adoption placing
[1:15:01] manifesting okay take him out there and
[1:15:04] put a ceremony on and visit him with an
[1:15:06] angel amen exactly he said it let's
[1:15:11] believe for all things you know you
[1:15:13] gotta examine ourselves sometime and say
[1:15:14] Lord where am i limiting you I want to
[1:15:17] open my heart and my mind to all that
[1:15:20] you have written to all that you want to
[1:15:22] do inside of me okay again it's it's all
[1:15:25] about surrender yielding to him letting
[1:15:27] him have his way now he says visit him
[1:15:31] with a danger tell him something now if
[1:15:33] he's told the truth if he's just making
[1:15:35] up something it won't work he said that
[1:15:36] won't work he says but I mean
[1:15:38] manifestation of sons of God when God
[1:15:41] manifests himself and he sends him out
[1:15:44] amen and there he goes forth and what he
[1:15:47] says is the truth we speak what he
[1:15:51] speaks we wait on him it's not us
[1:15:55] it's him amen he says then he manifests
[1:15:58] Christ how do you judge him by the way
[1:16:00] he stays with the word right with the
[1:16:02] word that's how you know all the time is
[1:16:04] by the way he stays with the word amen
[1:16:06] amen
[1:16:09] don't you love him you see this picture
[1:16:11] this beautiful picture of again God and
[1:16:14] his children God and his sons his family
[1:16:16] they're gonna look like him they're
[1:16:18] gonna walk like him and talk like him
[1:16:20] you are a son and in that is so much
[1:16:25] power and so much riches and so much
[1:16:27] reality just in that statement but
[1:16:30] you're becoming your
[1:16:32] becoming that seed is going to produce
[1:16:33] it's going to produce Christ amen and
[1:16:37] let's just take a look now again as
[1:16:40] we're talking about being conformed to
[1:16:42] the image of the Sun let's let's focus
[1:16:44] and what does that mean in this
[1:16:46] fellowship that we have as sons growing
[1:16:49] up let's look at our Lord Jesus what how
[1:16:52] did the father work with him how did he
[1:16:54] shape him how did he deal with him you
[1:16:56] know what did he go through and even the
[1:16:58] Prophet you can see in the prophets life
[1:16:59] over the span of those years how he
[1:17:02] dealt with him you know in the beginning
[1:17:04] maybe he was listening to the wrong
[1:17:05] people the wrong influences his
[1:17:07] mother-in-law right things like that
[1:17:09] later in life what was it it was a
[1:17:11] little attitude a little feeling see
[1:17:14] it's that continual refining continual
[1:17:16] processes he's working out in us where
[1:17:19] we are captive to one voice alone one
[1:17:23] head alone yes amen and he has complete
[1:17:26] dominion and complete control over his
[1:17:29] church his body amen
[1:17:31] so let's look at that for a minute turn
[1:17:33] with me to galatians chapter 4 and we
[1:17:37] talked about sons and and all these
[1:17:39] potentials and yet we've got to be
[1:17:42] reminded of some things here galatians
[1:17:44] chapter 4 and verse 1 he says now i say
[1:17:48] that the air as long as he is a child
[1:17:50] differ differ nothing from a servant
[1:17:53] though he be Lord of all but listen look
[1:17:56] at verse 2 and read that carefully but
[1:17:58] his under tutors and governors until the
[1:18:02] time appointed of the Father okay so
[1:18:06] there it is it's the Holy Spirit
[1:18:07] training he is our tutor we're sons but
[1:18:11] he's got to work with us he's got a
[1:18:12] spank us sometimes he's got a he's got
[1:18:14] it he's gonna deal with us as sons and
[1:18:16] there's tutoring and training and
[1:18:18] correction and and we learn obedience
[1:18:21] like Jesus said he learned obedience
[1:18:23] through the things that he suffered
[1:18:26] you're gonna suffer you're gonna learn
[1:18:28] obedience you're gonna learn oh I
[1:18:29] shouldn't have done that God have mercy
[1:18:31] forgive me next time we'll do it
[1:18:34] differently he's gracious but he's
[1:18:36] working with us amen
[1:18:39] Hebrews chapter five
[1:18:43] God dealing with his sons training and
[1:18:46] testing and Burt's I'm sorry Chapter
[1:18:49] five
[1:18:50] oh we just I just quoted that too but
[1:18:53] yeah that's fine he says though he were
[1:18:54] son yet he learned yet learned he
[1:18:57] obedience isn't that amazing it to me
[1:18:59] it's it's awesome it's a little
[1:19:01] mysterious but it's the truth and he's
[1:19:05] gonna deal with us in the exact same way
[1:19:07] let's let's actually move to the end of
[1:19:10] the chapter there verse 13 he says for
[1:19:13] everyone that yusuf milk is unskillful
[1:19:16] and the word of righteousness for you
[1:19:17] said babe but strong meat belongeth to
[1:19:20] them that are of full age even to those
[1:19:23] who by reason of use have their senses
[1:19:26] exercised to discern good and evil okay
[1:19:31] sense is exercised and you're gonna fall
[1:19:35] and you're gonna fail and you're gonna
[1:19:36] make mistakes but he's gonna continue to
[1:19:38] work continue to train to continue to
[1:19:42] refine until you come to that place
[1:19:43] again slowly he begins to clean out
[1:19:46] slowly he begins to take subdue all
[1:19:49] things and have that dominion and that
[1:19:51] control amen
[1:19:53] and you think again like we mentioned
[1:19:55] we're a multi-dimensional being in some
[1:19:58] days it drives us crazy we've got this
[1:20:00] God part we do and we've got the human
[1:20:03] part screaming at us all the time now
[1:20:06] you look at it you look at a I don't
[1:20:08] have a it's fine you look at a young
[1:20:11] person a child
[1:20:12] okay body soul spirit when they're a
[1:20:16] young person and an adult to really
[1:20:18] unregenerate that's let's just if I
[1:20:22] could draw those three circles or
[1:20:23] picture those with me we have body at
[1:20:26] the top and we have spirit and then we
[1:20:29] have soul at the bottom okay what are
[1:20:31] those five senses on the outside see
[1:20:33] taste it's in spirit man affection calm
[1:20:36] as a young person and as a natural man
[1:20:40] it's all from that outside in
[1:20:42] influencing you know you're driven
[1:20:45] you're driven you're completely
[1:20:48] captivated by those senses and yet when
[1:20:52] these things happen when God gets ahold
[1:20:54] of us gives us that new birth it flips
[1:20:56] and
[1:20:57] you began to wear that soul is truly in
[1:20:59] the control tower the holy spirit coming
[1:21:01] down cleaning out senses memory
[1:21:04] affection reasoning and that's him in
[1:21:07] control that seed that life of God is
[1:21:10] the control tower ruling and having that
[1:21:12] Dominion in coal does that make sense I
[1:21:14] couldn't draw it up but I hope you get
[1:21:16] that that picture there amen though he
[1:21:21] were a son yet learned he obedience by
[1:21:23] the things that he suffered amazing okay
[1:21:26] let's look at our Lord Jesus against
[1:21:28] some more let's turn back to to
[1:21:30] Philippians chapter 2 this life of
[1:21:33] fellowship if you will of sons what does
[1:21:38] it mean it means a lot of surrender lean
[1:21:40] means a lot of death to self and he says
[1:21:45] Amen that's right in verse 5 he says let
[1:21:48] this mind be in you which was also in
[1:21:51] Christ Jesus who being the in the form
[1:21:54] of God thought it not robbery to be
[1:21:56] equal with God but made himself of no
[1:22:00] reputation hallelujah I loved him and
[1:22:03] took upon him the form of a servant and
[1:22:05] was made in the likeness of men so there
[1:22:08] it we can see that picture God
[1:22:10] expressing and coming down in his son
[1:22:12] he's gonna do the same thing with us
[1:22:14] where we take on that same mind we
[1:22:16] become a servant to our brothers and
[1:22:18] sisters it's not about me it's not about
[1:22:21] you it's about him and doing him doing
[1:22:23] what he wants in us making ourselves of
[1:22:26] no reputation i men amen I'm what you
[1:22:30] think about this and we're talking about
[1:22:31] maturity right we're talking about
[1:22:33] becoming sons God expressed in his
[1:22:36] family and mature son is an obedient son
[1:22:39] all right he knows what to do he knows
[1:22:42] how to behave himself you look at
[1:22:44] brother branham you go through adoption
[1:22:45] he talks so much about conduct and
[1:22:48] behavior the father's watching he's
[1:22:50] looking is my son how is he performing
[1:22:52] how is he acting is he doing what I
[1:22:54] would do is he saying what I would say
[1:22:56] that's what he is looking for and again
[1:22:59] we are sons were becoming sense that
[1:23:02] that seed has to produce it's going to
[1:23:05] produce amen a
[1:23:08] this is from the message look he says we
[1:23:11] must focus our lives he says not what
[1:23:15] somebody else says but focus our lives
[1:23:17] to him and he is the word see if if we
[1:23:20] get our lives lined with the word and
[1:23:22] the word and our life becomes the same
[1:23:25] isn't that beautiful
[1:23:26] oh my he says our word in our it life
[1:23:32] becomes the same he said if you abide in
[1:23:34] me and my word in you then you ask what
[1:23:37] you will it'll be granted it to you
[1:23:39] verily I say unto you of this mountain
[1:23:41] be moved and don't doubt in your heart
[1:23:43] believe that what you have said will
[1:23:45] come to pass you can have what you said
[1:23:46] oh my now listen he says not what I said
[1:23:51] what you said what you say Amen he says
[1:23:56] what you said he says because you and he
[1:23:59] become the same Amen you become the same
[1:24:04] because the mind that was in Christ is
[1:24:05] in you and the miner was in Christ was
[1:24:08] to fulfill the father's world word oh
[1:24:11] man don't you just feel heaven yeah
[1:24:13] that's our identity that's our Father
[1:24:16] our life right there and you can feel it
[1:24:18] right inside here just saying yes amen
[1:24:20] Abba Father amen the mind that was in
[1:24:24] Christ was to fulfill the what father's
[1:24:26] word which he was the word there you are
[1:24:28] then you and the word are focused in
[1:24:31] together you become a living unit of God
[1:24:34] Oh hallelujah
[1:24:35] I love it let's just keep moving on a
[1:24:38] little bit more here turn with me to
[1:24:40] first Peter and this try to try to yeah
[1:24:47] let's just take a look here this is
[1:24:48] something that's always so beautiful
[1:24:51] first Peter where to kaptur to and let's
[1:24:56] start with verse yeah we'll start with
[1:25:00] verse 19 here says for this is thank
[1:25:03] worthy if a man for conscience toward
[1:25:05] God and doer grief suffering wrongfully
[1:25:09] for what glory is it if when you be
[1:25:12] buffeted for your faults you take it
[1:25:13] patiently but if when you do well and
[1:25:15] suffer for it you take it patiently this
[1:25:17] is acceptable to God okay
[1:25:20] that's encouraging
[1:25:21] for even hereunto where you called
[1:25:23] because Christ also suffered for us
[1:25:26] leaving us an example this is so
[1:25:29] beautiful he said that you should follow
[1:25:30] in his steps now let's see let's see
[1:25:33] he's giving us an example he's painting
[1:25:35] a picture who did no sin neither was
[1:25:38] guile found in his mouth who when he
[1:25:41] revived was reviled reviled not again
[1:25:43] when he suffered he threatened not look
[1:25:47] what follows but committed himself to
[1:25:49] him that judgeth righteously you look at
[1:25:53] the interpretation therein in verse 23
[1:25:58] it says he kept on delivering himself to
[1:26:02] the Father no matter what comes your way
[1:26:05] no matter what you encounter Jesus if he
[1:26:08] was he was reviled all these things he
[1:26:10] suffered he continually continually kept
[1:26:12] on delivering himself Lord Lord I give
[1:26:16] this to you I give myself to you no
[1:26:18] matter what you're facing that's your
[1:26:20] response and that's your reaction is to
[1:26:23] turn it over to God and let God be God
[1:26:25] and let him deal with it okay what a
[1:26:28] beautiful picture amen
[1:26:32] this is just another beautiful quote
[1:26:35] here this is from Abraham's covenant
[1:26:37] confirmed he says if you can't if you
[1:26:42] can catch it and know what I'm talking
[1:26:44] about the very the very ministry that
[1:26:48] Jesus Christ was doing here on earth
[1:26:50] when it when it comes back the very same
[1:26:53] ministry he had Pentecost will not have
[1:26:56] to wide not-self out into organization
[1:26:58] but but listen but shape itself
[1:27:01] isn't that interesting watch his wording
[1:27:03] here shape itself up in Christ until the
[1:27:06] headstone and church will fit one to the
[1:27:09] other Oh hallelujah
[1:27:11] you see what we're called to your
[1:27:14] identity he said and them is so cemented
[1:27:16] till you can't even take a razor blade
[1:27:18] and go around and find the crack where
[1:27:20] they're put together what beauty what
[1:27:22] oneness and that's how the church has
[1:27:24] got to come so much like Christ now
[1:27:27] watch what he says next I think it's
[1:27:29] beautiful he says and look what we got
[1:27:31] to do then what do we have to do what is
[1:27:35] it's cut away and circumcised and
[1:27:38] chopped off and form and molded until
[1:27:41] the image of Jesus Christ until that
[1:27:44] church and cap come rights back together
[1:27:46] okay so he's saying the church is going
[1:27:50] to be one with Christ they are going to
[1:27:52] be just perfectly one but it takes a
[1:27:55] cutting and it takes a chopping and it
[1:27:57] takes some molding and it takes
[1:27:58] circumcising amen that's that that
[1:28:01] submission that we read about in
[1:28:03] Philippians chapter 2 that working
[1:28:05] whereby he is going to subdue everything
[1:28:09] all of us to himself amen don't you love
[1:28:12] him this morning you are sons you are

[1:28:58] say to you I'm sure you you may
[1:29:01] recognize this one but it's just oh so

[1:29:54] dogmas mixed with the word and that
[1:29:56] brings forth a hybrid but the true
[1:29:59] genuine unhybridized spoken cede Word of

[1:30:07] produce him him in his people amen
