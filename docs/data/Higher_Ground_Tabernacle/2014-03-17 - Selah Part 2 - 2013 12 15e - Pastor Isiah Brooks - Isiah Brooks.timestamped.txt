[0:00] let's just start by reading Proverbs
[0:02] 23:7 just the first portion of that and
[0:06] we'll take and move on finish this
[0:08] tonight Lord's
[0:10] willing
[0:19] amen Proverbs
[0:21] 237 for as he thinketh in his
[0:25] heart so is
[0:28] he that's just read that portion again
[0:31] for as he thinketh in his heart so is he
[0:36] let us pray father God we come before
[0:38] you right now we thank you for your
[0:40] grace we thank you for your mercy and
[0:42] your love Lord we pray that you forgive
[0:44] us of all of our sins and our
[0:46] shortcomings Lord and we'll be grateful
[0:49] Lord grateful Lord gratefully to praise
[0:52] you Lord and testify of all the great
[0:55] things you've done and is doing for us
[0:57] Lord help us Lord here tonight bless us
[1:00] we pray as we surrender our hearts our
[1:02] minds and our souls to you Lord in Jesus
[1:05] Christ's name we pray amen you may be
[1:08] seated I started off this morning amen
[1:10] showing uh by the grace of God uh where
[1:14] civilization had taken us or has taken
[1:17] us and I showed you how uh all of that
[1:21] though be good is evil too uh so much so
[1:24] that it won't even be in the new
[1:26] civilization amen and so we thank God
[1:29] Amen because
[1:30] if this is a faith civilization the one
[1:32] that we're going to is a faith
[1:34] civilization as well and um I read here
[1:38] in the power of transformation it says
[1:40] see how that the serpent seed went off
[1:42] into science education cities and music
[1:45] and great things in education and
[1:48] Science and so forth but the seed of the
[1:49] righteous one uh uh uh came back to the
[1:53] word I just kind of uh uh paraphrase
[1:56] that a small portion there but that's
[1:59] what he said you know he said a lot of
[2:01] other things but he brought it right
[2:02] back down to uh the seed of Eve and he
[2:05] said that Eve did not have a seed so
[2:07] that was God's seed so and it came back
[2:09] and he brought it back Amen to the point
[2:11] where the Bible said Seth amen when he
[2:13] was born uh men began to call upon the
[2:16] name of the Lord see because that was in
[2:18] the seed it's in the seed to worship God
[2:22] Amen you hear what I'm saying so when
[2:24] that seed was born that seed couldn't
[2:26] help itself it had to worship God amen
[2:30] the true and living God because it was
[2:32] the proper and correct seed is that all
[2:35] right then amen I was reading here how
[2:39] that the civilization built uh uh is
[2:42] built up to its Pinnacle now in other
[2:43] words am mean this civilization has come
[2:46] to its point and we've got death in this
[2:49] civilization we got sin in this
[2:50] civilization we've got sickness in this
[2:53] civilization and that can't be of God so
[2:57] God in in in the uh his great own
[3:01] kingdom that is to come will have a
[3:04] civilization but it'll not be anything
[3:07] like this amen one of the things I
[3:09] wanted to show you this morning I think
[3:11] I kind of left out but I wanted to show
[3:14] you how this transformation take takes
[3:17] place brother brandom said and he used
[3:19] the word I used the tple he said that
[3:22] tple when it is born it looks like a
[3:25] catfish but that catfish when it begins
[3:28] to transform it drops his tail and it
[3:30] turns into a
[3:32] frog amen amen to look at the Frog and
[3:35] look at the tple you'll never uh believe
[3:38] or even know that it was the same
[3:40] creature but that's the kind of
[3:42] transformation that God Amen is looking
[3:45] at of course we're not transforming into
[3:47] a frog we're going far beyond that by
[3:49] the grace of God but he used that as a
[3:52] scenario so that we can see that there's
[3:54] a a total outward change and character
[3:58] change amen
[4:00] right because the tap pole can only live
[4:02] in water but the Frog can live in water
[4:05] and on the land is that right so we're
[4:08] looking at this so we understand by the
[4:10] grace of God that this scientific
[4:12] civilization he goes on to say it'll be
[4:15] a faith Civilization by the word see the
[4:18] scientific civilization we have is all
[4:22] is is ex have excuse me uh the
[4:25] scientific civilization we have is
[4:27] exactly listen Satan an's
[4:31] trap and that's what he's killed the
[4:34] people with that's what he's killing
[4:37] us every day with that's how as we eat
[4:41] day instead of living we die they have
[4:44] so perverted everything to even they
[4:47] take just so much of this and mix it
[4:49] with this and hre this and that and that
[4:52] it till it's a dying it's a dying race
[4:55] and no matter what you try to do you'll
[4:58] die you see seen the picture last night
[5:01] of those Africans they never had
[5:04] penicillin them people live longer than
[5:06] we do they don't even know germs don't
[5:09] bother them see why a germ would throw
[5:12] up his hands and surrender at
[5:14] them I like
[5:17] that they don't why they haven't you see
[5:20] all been uh uh working with he talking
[5:24] about this hybrid
[5:25] stuff so when you and I can see by the
[5:29] grace of God that this stuff is
[5:32] basically killing
[5:33] us so in order to live we got to get
[5:36] something that's going to cause us to
[5:38] live right all of us can be a witness to
[5:41] that amen that this thing amen is
[5:44] killing us I don't care how much amen
[5:47] you physical exercise vitamins amen you
[5:50] can you can close yourself in a bubble
[5:52] and you'll still die
[5:55] amen this civilization has built up as
[5:58] they say a pin
[6:00] it cannot be of God by the grace of God
[6:02] is killing everything is that right amen
[6:05] so but we know by the grace of God that
[6:08] God has something special for us amen
[6:11] he's got something good for us if we can
[6:14] just have faith in God now let me read
[6:19] on one of the things I didn't want you
[6:21] to do I don't want us to so frat like oh
[6:24] my God I'm going to miss the Rapture
[6:26] like I said amen a sheep can never be
[6:28] sheepish it is what it is or two
[6:31] sheepish rather amen it is what it is
[6:34] it's going to bore the character that it
[6:36] is so when it comes to the saints of God
[6:39] let me put it this way I don't care what
[6:41] you think and what I think God's word is
[6:45] the thing or the cause of who we are and
[6:50] what we are
[6:52] today if God did not come by to stir you
[6:57] if God didn't come to anoint you you if
[7:00] God did not if he would not come to
[7:02] change you all of us would still be out
[7:05] there in the world Amen because we have
[7:08] come to know that we did not seek God
[7:11] God sought
[7:12] us oh come on somebody God interrupted
[7:16] every one of our Lives Amen to bring us
[7:19] to this truth and the one thing that I
[7:22] love about it is that God has never lost
[7:24] one hallelujah hallelujah come on
[7:26] somebody you might be at the head of the
[7:29] line but I might be at the back of the
[7:30] line but I'm still in the line
[7:33] amen hallelujah come on somebody he
[7:37] might have to scream to us stay in line
[7:40] get back in line but we in line hey
[7:44] somebody I felt that one am amen so when
[7:47] you look at this you and I must
[7:49] understand that we're working with the
[7:51] God of Peace
[7:54] amen is that right when that wig one
[7:57] came a revelation 10 is that right when
[8:01] he came by the grace of God Amen the
[8:04] Bible said his eyes was like the flame
[8:06] of fire I mean he looked like he was
[8:08] really
[8:09] upset oh my God but he was not upset
[8:13] with his own he came to redeem his own
[8:16] but judge the wicked see because God
[8:19] knew that he his own would repent amen
[8:23] that's where our Victory is it's in
[8:25] Repentance amen that's why Revelation 3
[8:28] says be zous to repent people of God
[8:31] because God knows that his people will
[8:34] repent it doesn't mean you won't do
[8:36] wrong but he knows you're going to
[8:37] repent from it thank God for that
[8:41] amen now he says Amen in Romans 16:20
[8:44] and the God of Peace shall bruise Satan
[8:46] under your feet
[8:48] shortly come on somebody the grace of
[8:51] our Lord Jesus Christ be with you amen
[8:56] that wasn't just for the Romans that's
[8:58] for you and me
[9:00] God knew that his seed would come in
[9:01] this day and read the very same word
[9:05] because his thoughts about the church
[9:06] yesterday is the same thoughts for today
[9:08] amen and it cannot
[9:10] change is that right I can't tell you
[9:14] how often I have to repent during the
[9:16] day and ask God to forgive me during the
[9:18] day and you know uh come on somebody
[9:21] Hallelujah you know and I mean I mean
[9:22] it's just amazing the battles that we're
[9:25] going through right now you say oh
[9:27] brother Brooks the battles are great I'm
[9:29] so glad you said how can you be glad yes
[9:33] it's painful my daughter just had a baby
[9:37] hallelujah oh my God but she said when
[9:40] she delivered that baby all she could do
[9:42] is say thank you Jesus thank you Jesus
[9:46] thank you
[9:48] Jesus amen amen and they was telling me
[9:52] about one of my daughters when she had
[9:54] her baby she told the doctor she told
[9:56] the doctor I'm going to die the lady
[9:58] said you're not going to die she said
[9:59] yes I am I'm going to
[10:03] die but you see amen that pain was
[10:07] making her feel that way amen but what
[10:10] she failed to see momentarily she wasn't
[10:13] dying she was literally bringing forth
[10:15] life and right now you might feel like
[10:18] the pain is feeling bringing you to a
[10:20] death and you might die but that's not
[10:22] what's really happening God is producing
[10:25] life amen he's bringing life out of you
[10:28] yeah is home
[10:29] yes it's painful Hallelujah anxiet all
[10:32] these things fight your mind but you're
[10:34] pushing Hallelujah you're bringing forth
[10:37] the head Hallelujah which is Jesus
[10:40] Christ
[10:41] himself Oh Glory to God he's a God of
[10:44] Peace God is not angry with you amen
[10:48] amen oh come on somebody if he was angry
[10:51] with you you'd be out there come on
[10:53] somebody God is the God of Peace is that
[10:55] the word amen now the God of Peace that
[10:57] brought again from the dead our Lord
[10:59] Jesus Christ that great Shepherd of the
[11:03] sheep why you put Shepherd of the sheep
[11:06] so that you understand he's
[11:09] leading through the blood of the
[11:12] Everlasting Covenant not I got you
[11:15] you're Sav today and you're not Sav
[11:17] tomorrow this is an unconditional
[11:19] Covenant amen so rest in Christ
[11:23] amen oh I love this make you perfect in
[11:28] every good work to do his will that is a
[11:33] process to complete and what has been
[11:36] broken he's going to fix
[11:38] it
[11:40] Lord he's going to make you perfect in
[11:44] every good work to do his will amen
[11:47] working in you say working in me amen
[11:50] working in me working in me

[11:57] sight through through Jesus Christ to
[12:01] whom be glory forever and ever amen that
[12:04] word means so be it amen hey Lord
[12:07] working in me working in you Hallelujah
[12:10] he's going to do it he's doing it right
[12:13] now oh the pain thank God for the pain
[12:17] amen cuz if you was dead you wouldn't
[12:19] feel
[12:20] any not in the body
[12:23] anyhow
[12:24] amen glory to
[12:27] God
[12:29] see the birth of the word is truth I
[12:32] love that when the Bible you see I may
[12:34] have read that quote many time where
[12:35] brother brandom said our parent is the
[12:38] word but when I was studying that thing
[12:41] looked like a new a new dimension opened
[12:43] to
[12:44] me Hallelujah you know you know the
[12:46] eaglet that little eaglet amen didn't
[12:49] realize it was a eaglet or Eagle until
[12:51] he heard the scream but when I when I
[12:54] heard that I heard the scream Hallelujah
[12:56] I heard something you know something
[12:58] went off I'm like there it is amen it
[13:01] ain't about me it's about him in this
[13:03] clay God in this clay not me is God in
[13:07] the
[13:08] clay that's what made me it was a human
[13:11] life in this clay that made me human but
[13:15] now it's a God in this clay that'll make
[13:18] me a god hey Lord have mercy it's simple
[13:22] as that and what I got to do be faithful
[13:27] in feeding when Papa and Mama want to
[13:30] feed me I just got to eat right amen eat
[13:34] all your vitamins eat your food and
[13:36] you'll turn out to be a healthy boy and
[13:38] girl right that's the way it goes
[13:41] because the life in itself is going to
[13:42] produce his life
[13:46] am this is
[13:48] powerful you'll never see another tree
[13:50] nurturing a
[13:51] tree and just throw the seed out
[13:55] there this is good
[13:57] stuff amen he throws the seed out there
[14:00] and everything that that seed needs is
[14:02] right in nature amen everything in the
[14:04] earth he don't have to worry about
[14:05] whether it's going to grow because Mom
[14:07] and Daddy tree done proed that the
[14:09] ground was good yeah Hallelujah so the
[14:11] seed goes out amen and the water the
[14:14] rain the Seas and everything that Mom
[14:15] and Daddy had to go through that tree
[14:17] got to go through amen that baby tree
[14:20] has to go through but the life has
[14:22] already been proven Hallelujah the
[14:24] stamina of the tree it's been proven
[14:27] that Mom and Daddy tree y' understand
[14:29] what I'm saying amen he can believe that
[14:31] he's going to be grow up to be a great
[14:33] Oak cuz he can see the ones that around
[14:35] him Hallelujah and so is it with the
[14:38] True Believer the seed may have been
[14:40] thrown but it fell in good ground amen
[14:43] that'll bring forth aund fold God will
[14:46] cause the seed to grow
[14:48] amen have you ever thought about this a
[14:51] lot of us we want to just run real fast
[14:53] don't we but have you ever thought about
[14:55] it that we've got a slug because there's
[14:57] somebody else left yeah Hallelujah if we
[15:00] could run as fast as we desire to run
[15:03] the Rapture will be on Amen but God
[15:05] sometime he have to slow us up a little
[15:08] bit H he has to he has to slow us up a
[15:11] little bit that's why some sometimes
[15:13] famines come in that's why droughts or
[15:16] whatever the case may be may hit certain
[15:18] thing because and and during that period
[15:20] amen it'll slow you up the growth but
[15:23] then after a while a real rain will come
[15:26] Hallelujah and you are you you've grown
[15:29] overnight Hallelujah that's the way God
[15:31] works sometimes even in our lives
[15:35] amen hallelujah amen so when we look at
[15:39] this he make you perfect in every good
[15:40] work to do his will this is what I love
[15:43] about it because understand I love this
[15:47] I've
[15:48] always watched those little animals a
[15:50] horse a deer and the first thing they do
[15:54] when they come they they they a they
[15:56] first learn how to stand and then the
[15:58] next thing they they do after they stand
[16:00] they go for the
[16:02] Mama come on somebody amen they go to be
[16:06] nursed by the mother how did they know
[16:09] that they didn't go to school we're the
[16:11] only lame creature per se not the only
[16:16] ones but we got those like monkeys and
[16:18] all that that needs to be fed that way
[16:20] but when we are
[16:22] born we have to be so taken care
[16:26] of almost every other animal finds their
[16:30] way but we're the ones that have to be
[16:32] so taken care of mama got to come you
[16:35] got you know it it just amazing and
[16:37] that's how God is when we're born he so
[16:40] take care of us hallelujah even when you
[16:44] cry and think he's not far away he's
[16:46] right there watching amen sometime he
[16:49] gives you Grace to exercise your
[16:56] lungs that's the truth that's the truth
[16:59] folks amen you look at that and God is
[17:01] right there to help you is that right
[17:03] now I want you to understand because a
[17:05] lot of times You Feel So Unworthy but
[17:08] I'mma change your thought about this
[17:09] right now Hebrews
[17:20] 11 oh Lord have mercy you got to realize
[17:23] amen that this thing is by faith right
[17:26] you've got something
[17:30] that the world don't
[17:32] have now the world may have faith in all
[17:35] this whatever they call Faith but you
[17:37] got Jesus the faith of the Lord Jesus in
[17:40] you right now here the word of God tells
[17:42] us in Hebrews
[17:44] 11:38 think about this and I want you to
[17:47] really think about this the scripture
[17:50] says of whom the world was not
[17:54] worthy who was he talking
[17:57] about us those who've gone on before us
[18:01] and Who We Are The World is not worthy
[18:04] of
[18:05] you that means you're worth something
[18:10] amen the devil say you're not worth it
[18:13] anything but the Bible said you're worth
[18:15] far more so much so this world is not
[18:20] worthy Hallelujah that's right the whole
[18:23] world is not worthy of you oh yeah they
[18:27] wondered inde deserts and the mountains
[18:29] and dens and caves of the Earth but what
[18:32] this world didn't understand was those
[18:34] who wandered were those who were there
[18:36] in the
[18:38] beginning created with God created in
[18:41] God am I said created with God but y'all
[18:44] me know what I mean when Jesus Christ
[18:46] was created am Hallelujah hey amen there
[18:50] was a part of him that was Hallelujah
[18:53] come on somebody if that part wasn't
[18:55] created it would have never died but
[18:57] when he was created so were you you were
[19:00] in him
[19:03] amen and the world is not worthy of you
[19:06] but they look at like you're the scum of
[19:07] the earth ain't nothing to you oh Lord I
[19:10] I I say sometime man if the people when
[19:13] they mistreat me I said if they only
[19:14] knew who they was
[19:17] mistreating every time I get on the
[19:19] plane they should put me in first
[19:23] class hallelujah amen if it was some
[19:26] Royal president or something there put
[19:28] him
[19:29] there Hallelujah but that's okay our day
[19:33] coming amen amen so look look the world
[19:37] is not worthy and I'm I'm I'm saying
[19:39] because if the if you the world is not
[19:41] worthy that means you're something amen
[19:44] now we're not to be allowed ourselves to
[19:46] be puffed up with pride but we are
[19:49] supposed to know who we are amen amen
[19:53] took upon himself no reputation but he
[19:56] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[19:58] God this is the mindset the bride must
[20:02] have amen you must have
[20:08] this is that all right let us turn to
[20:11] first Thessalonians 5 because I want you
[20:13] to know amen that the Bible said every
[20:16] good and every perfect gift is from
[20:18] above and cometh down from the father of
[20:21] lights are you a good and perfect
[20:24] gift yes I am if you're not you well I
[20:28] thought that was listen the the the the
[20:31] perfect gift was Jesus Christ and I was
[20:34] in
[20:35] it amen
[20:38] hallelujah the father of lights and the
[20:41] Bible said ye are the lights of the
[20:43] world Amen is that right but look what 1
[20:47] Thessalonians 5
[20:49] says let me get that so you can
[20:53] understand first 1 Thessalonians 5
[20:56] 5 ye are are the children of light amen
[21:01] that means if light going to have
[21:03] children the only thing it can produce
[21:05] is light
[21:09] amen God is light amen there's not a two
[21:13] lights there's only one light amen and
[21:15] I'm part of that amen that's why brother
[21:18] R said that the Holy Ghost was a you
[21:20] know you were a a rotation off of God in
[21:24] other words God pulled a piece of
[21:25] himself and gave it to you amen broke a
[21:28] piece that's why he broke the bread yes
[21:31] amen oh Lord when I think about that see
[21:34] my point is this you got to believe what
[21:37] you are before you can be what you
[21:41] are huh you got to believe what you are
[21:45] before you can be what you are see and
[21:47] once you believe that nobody can take it
[21:51] from you
[21:56] amen you know I tell you like this Bruce
[21:59] Lee you know this is a a natural thing
[22:01] he was one of the smallest Fighters I
[22:03] ever seen in my life but there wasn't a
[22:06] big fella could whip
[22:08] him why because he had to believe in his
[22:11] heart he could whoop
[22:13] him though they were big in size he was
[22:16] bigger in
[22:17] man right and that's what I'm saying
[22:20] David had believed something amen when
[22:23] he faced Goliath he could not have the
[22:25] same mindset his brothers had that's
[22:27] right amen he could not allow himself to
[22:29] run as a coward in other words he
[22:32] defeated fear by running into the
[22:34] problem instead of running from the
[22:36] problem that's how you defeat fear you
[22:39] run into it
[22:42] amen you don't run away from it you take
[22:44] the challenge and you challenge it amen
[22:47] by the same words amen Goliath
[22:49] challenged David David took the same
[22:51] words and brought it back to Goliath
[22:55] amen hallelujah come on somebody
[22:58] it's still good to me now I look at this
[23:01] thing because if we are the light that
[23:03] and there Darkness tell me at any point
[23:05] anywhere any time Darkness defeated the
[23:09] light you can cut all this whole
[23:12] building all the lights off get you a
[23:14] flashlight and I guarantee it'll be
[23:17] seen somehow it penetrates through all
[23:20] that Darkness nowhere matter what point
[23:22] of the room you're in you can see that
[23:25] light that's how it is in the spirit
[23:27] world
[23:28] yes amen that's how in the spirit world
[23:31] that's how come the devil can recognize
[23:33] you because of the light that you
[23:37] have oh yes I've had mediums come up and
[23:40] tell me so my point is this people of
[23:42] God Amen they can see your light might
[23:44] as well tell you like this you need to
[23:46] start seeing the light
[23:48] amen your mindset out the way we think
[23:52] the way you know you know we've got to
[23:56] learn to to to really set only those
[23:59] things before us that are pure and that
[24:01] is Holy and that is good and that is
[24:03] righteous things that like a the word
[24:06] where we can read and study and you see
[24:09] what I'm saying and you know bringing
[24:11] this thing to us the mirror of the word
[24:14] and I I put down and I thought that's
[24:16] right we must become the mirrors of the
[24:19] word in other words we are person or
[24:22] individual must be able to see the word
[24:24] in us we must reflect back to the word
[24:28] what it has what it's given
[24:30] us in other words amen everything that
[24:33] they said about Jesus was able to be
[24:35] found in the word amen hello somebody he
[24:38] met the word by every Dot and by every
[24:42] tile he met that word amen and so
[24:45] therefore he was blameless because he
[24:48] met the word he said can you find any
[24:50] fault he said if if I'm not doing what
[24:53] the scriptures have said that I would
[24:55] do then you can find you you got me he
[24:59] said but but if I am he basically say
[25:01] shut up that's basic what he was saying
[25:04] because you see he understood he hadn't
[25:07] missed God by one point he was right
[25:12] there see and worldly people can call
[25:15] you Fanatics they can call you holy
[25:17] rollers and all you got to do is tell
[25:19] them say show me where in the scripture
[25:22] I'm not meeting God's
[25:25] criteria show me where I'm going
[25:28] wrong if you can't show me zip
[25:33] it right because amen we are the
[25:36] reflection of the word listen it's not a
[25:38] pride it's not an arrogance it it's it's
[25:40] just an
[25:41] assurance amen they said that this man
[25:44] who give him authority to teach the word
[25:46] like this see he had an authority and
[25:48] when you are certain of who you are it
[25:51] gives you the authority to use the
[25:54] word you know who you are you know your
[25:57] relationship ship with it you're not
[25:59] some study student you the
[26:03] word reflecting back to that word is
[26:06] here is in our minds we've got to learn
[26:09] to change this
[26:11] to can I use brother brand example
[26:14] brother B said I ain't got nothing to
[26:16] brag on he said my daddy was a drunkard
[26:19] my mother was a half Indian my family
[26:22] had a bad
[26:23] name he just was going down the road he
[26:26] said I was born of brandom that's where
[26:28] I was born he said there was nothing to
[26:30] brag on there now what if this man would
[26:34] have allowed his past to keep him from
[26:37] his
[26:40] future not like like Moses did I'm a
[26:43] mess Lord I done messed up over there in
[26:47] Egypt huh I'm oued out like a murderer I
[26:51] can't hardly talk and you telling me
[26:53] that I'm a
[26:54] deliverer you see what I'm saying how
[26:56] how the contrast that God allows all
[26:59] these Wicked worldly rough things to
[27:02] happen in your life and then he brings a
[27:05] lily up out of that pond
[27:07] mud see that's the whole
[27:10] plan that's the whole plan to show Satan
[27:13] no matter how dark you made it for them
[27:16] it's the seed that conquers everything
[27:19] it's what's in them that I have placed
[27:21] in them that will conquer
[27:24] you oh God think about it if the prophet
[27:28] had allowed that to hinder him he
[27:31] couldn't because there was something in
[27:33] him that was driving him they say oh
[27:36] brother brandom that thing that you got
[27:37] is be of the devil he said can't be I
[27:40] love God too much he ran from it
[27:43] Hallelujah then God Amen perfect in his
[27:47] power and in his understanding amen one
[27:49] day stepped out of a pillar of
[27:54] light oh see God protect Tak his
[27:59] gifts amen and if you don't know that
[28:01] God has protected you thus far you in
[28:04] trouble CU every last I I won't say
[28:07] every last one of us but I can say many
[28:09] of us have had death encounters and God
[28:12] brought us through them
[28:16] all what was it it was the gift it was
[28:19] what what was in you Hallelujah that was
[28:22] protect he was protecting
[28:24] amen he couldn't let you go you got work
[28:26] to do
[28:28] amen come on somebody listen even you
[28:31] don't think you're going to get tired
[28:32] even on this journey you get
[28:34] weary

[28:39] in your natural
[28:41] jobs but you know you still got to show

[29:37] whipping whipping because I didn't tell
[29:39] the LIE
[29:41] right oh Lord have mercy on us but
[29:45] nevertheless you see what I'm saying it
[29:49] would be exposed but I look at this
[29:51] stuff and I think to myself Lord have
[29:53] mercy what we've gone through this life
[29:55] but God is rich in Mercy amen amen
[29:58] we becomes the mirror as the scripture
[30:00] says according to James 1 123 for if any
[30:03] be of a hearer of the word and not a
[30:05] doer he is like unto a man beholding his
[30:07] natural face in a
[30:09] glass we're not supposed to hold our
[30:12] face because understand this it was only
[30:14] in this age the face of the Lord Jesus
[30:17] was revealed amen he said we'll see him
[30:20] face to
[30:22] face huh and then James said it'll be
[30:24] like a mirror in other words he's saying
[30:26] when you see my face you see
[30:28] yours the body has one face and that is
[30:31] the face of Jesus Christ come on
[30:33] somebody only one
[30:35] face so when you see his face you see
[30:39] yours wo somebody ought to be happy
[30:41] tonight to know that we're seeing the
[30:44] face of God and that's the way we look
[30:46] amen
[30:48] perfect than
[30:52] amen our lives are heing in Christ Jesus
[30:55] that's a beautiful scripture to me amen
[30:57] man every time I think about that I
[30:58] think about Levi being in the in the
[31:00] Lawns of Abraham his life with he and
[31:03] Abraham and all of Abraham's blessing
[31:06] Levi got it come on somebody and that's
[31:08] how it is with Jesus Christ all of his
[31:10] blessings we get it amen why because we
[31:13] were hid in him 2 Corinthians 3:18 said
[31:17] but we all with open face open face
[31:21] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[31:25] Lord a chain change into the same what
[31:30] image from glory to glory even as by the
[31:34] spirit of the Lord we're being changed
[31:37] from glory to glory don't all happen at
[31:39] one time little by little but we're
[31:42] being change into the glory and the
[31:44] image you've got to believe it anybody
[31:46] believe it I believe it oh can you see
[31:49] it brother I don't care if I can't see
[31:51] it I believe
[31:54] it Abraham walked with God is that is
[31:57] that right amen amen amen and yes we do
[32:01] have to suffer sometimes Romans 8:18 I'm
[32:04] going to read that
[32:05] quickly we have to suffer sure we do
[32:08] amen glory to God and the Bible said but
[32:11] I reckon that the suffering of this
[32:12] present time are not worthy to be
[32:14] compared with the glory which shall be
[32:16] revealed in US think about it think
[32:19] about it think about it just like I read
[32:21] this morning ain't no way that baby
[32:22] going to want to go back into his
[32:24] mother's
[32:25] womb no no no no no he might have
[32:28] thought he was coming into a mess amen
[32:30] especially when the first expression he
[32:32] the first thing he feels
[32:35] amen oh my God what am I coming into
[32:38] Hallelujah and understand he don't come
[32:40] in here seeing he comeing here not
[32:41] seeing amen so at little by little amen
[32:45] his eyes began to open up amen all of a
[32:48] sudden you see the baby start smiling
[32:50] wonder what he was thinking before he
[32:51] started
[32:53] seeing but you know nevertheless amen
[32:55] you look at this thing and and he can
[32:57] now see he sees a face that he he he
[33:00] knew was mama all along but now he can
[33:03] see who Mama looked like oh oh we can we
[33:07] don't have no idea the joy that fills a
[33:09] baby Soul we can't even remember it but
[33:12] I guarantee you it must be wonderful
[33:15] when this baby can't even recognize but
[33:17] he understands I am in a better place
[33:21] now oh Lord have mercy Abraham never
[33:25] altered his thought
[33:28] and the seed of God never Alters thought
[33:31] Rapture I am amen I'm going to produce
[33:34] Jesus Christ how you know God said so
[33:36] amen well you look like you're getting
[33:38] older Abraham I am but I'm still going
[33:41] to produce Jesus amen cuz God says so
[33:44] amen y'all hear what I'm saying amen
[33:47] it's in my appointed time and God going
[33:51] to produce it
[33:54] amen I want to say something to you that
[33:56] may even look look look a little strange
[33:58] or sound a little strange but Abraham
[34:00] believed God all those years and then
[34:03] here come Elohim himself sit down at
[34:06] Abraham's tent and tells him now Abraham
[34:10] it's time to fellowship with your
[34:13] wife because nine months from
[34:22] now
[34:24] amen I know I'm looking stupid but I'm
[34:26] feeling good
[34:27] amen you think about I I think about
[34:30] things like this not saying it's going
[34:31] to happen like this but what if God does
[34:34] come what if he says he comes to you
[34:36] individually and says okay it's now time
[34:39] to do this this
[34:41] this because so many days from hence
[34:45] this is going to happen am he did it to
[34:47] Abraham he did it to Abraham in the
[34:49] natural amen the Bible said we're
[34:52] Children of the light am we're not of
[34:54] Darkness this thing will not catch us
[34:56] unaware
[34:57] amen hallelujah there's something God is
[35:00] hiding in here and he's doing something
[35:02] amen and let me tell you something the
[35:03] bride feels it amen but I believe by the
[35:06] grace of God she's going to have a
[35:07] personal encounter with God before
[35:10] leaving out of here
[35:11] hallelujah
[35:14] amen glory to God see he's perfect I
[35:18] love the way he he does things I just
[35:20] it's just something that he he moves
[35:23] me W Lord have
[35:25] mercy and when Abraham was 90 years old
[35:28] you know and that's the thing about a
[35:30] people we look at Enoch and like you
[35:32] know Enoch was always perfect huh how
[35:36] could it be Enoch walked with God Enoch
[35:39] wasn't always perfect he walked with
[35:43] God put it this way the prophet of God
[35:45] had walked With God all those years you
[35:48] know been with God seen God but one day
[35:51] at the time of a storm God said can I
[35:54] walk with you he he has the
[35:57] prophit can I walk with
[36:03] you see but all along he had been with
[36:06] him but this was the first encounter
[36:08] that we know of God actually walks with
[36:12] him enjoying the
[36:18] creation this was the first time that we
[36:21] know of that God says to him you've come
[36:25] to that place
[36:28] I can walk with youall you did something
[36:32] that pleased me even though it looked
[36:35] like your death you didn't run from the
[36:37] storm you face the storm I told you to
[36:40] walk to through it you did I told you to
[36:43] speak through it you did it amen you see
[36:45] what I'm saying that's the test every
[36:48] test watch the Hebrew boyss they didn't
[36:50] run from it watch Daniel they didn't run
[36:52] from it they walked right into the storm
[36:56] knowing it was going to be their death
[36:57] if God had not answered and that was the
[37:00] thing that pleased him please
[37:07] God
[37:09] obedience ain't God good to
[37:12] us let me hurry Psalms and I 82 and6
[37:17] says I have said ye are gods and all of
[37:21] you are children of the most
[37:23] high then Jesus comes along in John
[37:26] 10:34 and quotes it again Jesus answered
[37:30] them is it not written in your law I
[37:33] said ye are
[37:36] Gods huh he said I said ye are
[37:40] Gods I said ye a gods look like they
[37:43] would have caught
[37:51] it for in him we live according to Acts
[37:55] 17:38 and move and have our being you
[37:59] see why I'm saying this because when you
[38:01] start thinking like this amen you know
[38:03] what people going to call you a
[38:06] cult you going to believe that you a
[38:08] cult there's only one God hallelujah I
[38:10] know that and that one God is living in
[38:13] me
[38:15] amen no I'm not saying I'm separate from
[38:18] God but we going to Stone you man
[38:21] because you make yourself equal with god
[38:23] you being a man make yourself equal with
[38:26] God you being a man make yourself equal
[38:28] with God and you think that accusation
[38:31] is not going on still and understand by
[38:34] the grace of God you do have
[38:36] Cults that literally be believe that
[38:38] they're being transformed into
[38:42] Gods the New Age movement and all of
[38:44] that but all that is folks is just a
[38:48] mimic of the truth amen you got to
[38:51] recognize where you are we didn't ask to
[38:53] be God we didn't strive to be God he
[38:55] made us that amen it was Lucifer who
[38:57] wanted to be that and God said no
[39:01] amen see because the only one that could
[39:04] be a God is those who comes out of the
[39:06] loins of God Amen and Lucifer was not a
[39:10] seat of
[39:12] God see what I'm saying but that's what
[39:15] he
[39:18] wanted we didn't ask for it no more than
[39:21] you asked to be a man or a woman God
[39:24] gave it to you so is it amen as a son
[39:27] and daughter of God God gives this to
[39:29] you it's a gift it is he God in you
[39:33] right and then in Acts 17:38 says for as
[39:36] much then we are all the offspring of
[39:40] God we ought not to think that God is
[39:42] like unto gold or silver or stone or
[39:44] Graven by Art in man's devices we don't
[39:47] be little God understand he is God Amen
[39:50] created of all things the invisible God
[39:53] but visible to us because we see him on
[39:55] the inside he said in that day you'll
[39:57] see me you'll know me amen like I said I
[40:01] told you you don't see with your eyes
[40:02] you see with your
[40:05] mind have I been on time with you Peter
[40:08] philli and you don't even know
[40:10] me when you see me you see the father he
[40:13] wasn't talking about his physical
[40:15] Anatomy he was talking about the works
[40:17] and the things he did
[40:19] amen
[40:22] amen being born
[40:25] again right 1 Peter 2 1:23 says being
[40:28] born again not of corruptible seed but
[40:31] of Incorruptible seed that mean it can't
[40:33] be corrupted
[40:34] amen that's why the Bible said if that
[40:36] seed remaineth in you you cannot sin
[40:39] amen oh Jesus
[40:42] amen excuse me is that all right amen by
[40:45] the word of God listen we make mistakes
[40:47] but we can't sin there is not a true
[40:50] believer that could ever disbelieve the
[40:52] word huh you mess up because of the
[40:55] sticky of this
[40:57] flesh but if we didn't have this flesh
[41:00] we'd be perfect
[41:04] already that's why we make it right this
[41:06] whole thing right here got to go it's
[41:09] got to be changed to with the Redemption
[41:11] of your body everything has been
[41:13] redeemed but your body amen but I tell
[41:15] you what has happened to your body has
[41:16] been
[41:20] condemned huh is that the truth I'm
[41:23] laughing you know I'm laughing it gives
[41:25] me joy amen we triy so hard to fix this
[41:27] house up and it's still condemned before
[41:30] God it's condemned we got a condemned
[41:32] side on it oh Lord have
[41:36] mercy All Flesh is as grass and all the
[41:39] glory of the of man as the flower of
[41:41] grass that's the truth all this stuff
[41:43] people work so hard for in one moment's
[41:45] time it's vanished the grass wither and
[41:48] the flowers thereof follow the way but
[41:50] the word of the Lord endureth forever
[41:53] and this is the word which by the gospel
[41:55] is preached unto you
[41:57] you it endure
[41:59] forever it endures forever they say they
[42:02] they say that even scientists can catch
[42:03] the real real voice of Jesus
[42:07] Christ It Never
[42:10] Dies think about it amen so this holy
[42:15] ghost that we have by the grace of God
[42:16] it causes us to
[42:18] Triumph second Corinthians 21:14 say
[42:21] thanks be to our god unto God which
[42:24] always causes us to Triumph in CAU let
[42:26] me read it again which always causes us
[42:29] to Triumph in Christ it's a win-win amen

[42:35] loser right because of his Victorious
[42:38] life you are victorious hey he causes us

[43:21] yourself sometime and then you're
[43:23] fighting both of
[43:25] them amen amen it's always that way

[47:12] have suffered a while make you perfect
[47:14] establish strengthens settles you a
[47:18] process that you and I must go through
[47:21] amen but let me say it like this the
[47:22] whole time you know it's like this it's
[47:24] your mindset
[47:26] is what you believing and thinking in
[47:27] your heart you got to push through all
[47:30] your unbelief because unbel you can't
[47:32] stop it unbelief coming you know doubt
[47:35] comes but you block it you stop it you
[47:37] you speak the word you create a
[47:39] different atmosphere than all of that
[47:41] unbelief comes y'all hear what I'm
[47:43] saying you're light you're light and and
[47:46] think about it if we could see that
[47:47] realm I guarantee you you see the light
[47:49] in the darkness
[47:50] fighting but that light Hold Steady
[47:53] whole steady whole steady you're not
[47:55] going to come through this I'm not going
[47:57] out why because the light that I have
[47:59] was not lit by men amen it was lit by
[48:05] God my last
[48:08] scripture
[48:10] almost Hebrews
[48:13] 1313 let us go forth therefore unto him
[48:16] without the
[48:17] camp bearing his
[48:20] reproach for here we have no continuing
[48:23] City but we seek one to come
[48:26] by him therefore let us offer the
[48:28] sacrifice of
[48:30] praise you know he didn't say he said
[48:33] sacrifice of praise y'all know what that
[48:36] means sacrifice something's painful
[48:38] something's got to die in order for the
[48:40] praise to come through Hallelujah
[48:43] sacrifice of praise to God
[48:46] continually amen that is what that's
[48:50] what I was trying to say this morning ah
[48:53] the fruit of our lips give giving thanks
[48:56] to his name the fruit of our lips and we
[49:01] fairly see people with fruits lip
[49:05] fruits but he says he looking for them
[49:07] fruits amen continually giving thanks
[49:10] amen oh I hurt my leg Thank God now that
[49:14] doesn't make sense but he said in all
[49:16] things give thanks amen it's obedience
[49:20] amen see if the children of Israel would
[49:22] have given God thanks when he was
[49:24] leading them through the Wilderness they
[49:25] would have taken them far short of a
[49:27] time and all of them probably would have
[49:30] lived but they murmured and complained
[49:32] because they tried to think that they
[49:35] thought that they knew more than what
[49:37] God thought surely God knows better than
[49:40] this this cannot be the way of a true
[49:43] leader that would lead us into the
[49:45] desert ain't no water out here no bread
[49:48] oh what do you do you should have left
[49:50] us over there in Egypt to die y'all hear
[49:52] what I'm saying and that's the way it is
[49:54] you can't think like like God don't know
[49:56] what he's doing God knows exactly what
[49:58] he's doing and guess what it's all about
[50:00] saving you and
[50:04] me it's hard it is tough sometimes but
[50:07] the harder way is the better way
[50:10] people it is the better way now the God
[50:14] of Peace that brought again from the
[50:17] dead of our Lord Jesus Christ that great
[50:19] Shepherd of the sheep through the blood
[50:21] of the Everlasting covet I read it again
[50:24] make you perfect in every good work to
[50:25] do his will working in you that which is
[50:28] well pleasing in his sight working in
[50:31] you that is well pleasing how many of
[50:33] y'all have heard as I was with Moses
[50:36] that's a good tape good message brother
[50:39] BR said God never held Moses
[50:41] accountable for his
[50:43] wrongdoing how he didn't put it that
[50:46] way but he was saying that God does not
[50:48] look at your sin he looks at the
[50:51] commission you see well Moses struck the
[50:54] Rock and he didn't go over that was
[50:55] God's
[50:56] plan because God can't have two prophets
[50:59] on the scene at the same time so Moses
[51:02] had to go off the scene so Joshua could
[51:04] come over Moses represented the law
[51:07] hello
[51:08] somebody but what you don't see what's
[51:11] the difference brother bandam said I
[51:13] went over there and he said I I was over
[51:15] there and they were
[51:18] real I felt him I talked with him and
[51:22] all Moses got up there you don't know
[51:24] what he saw but he was able to look over
[51:26] into the promised land now come on if he
[51:28] was able to look to the promised land
[51:30] all he saw was the river and whatever
[51:32] was there but I believe he's seen it
[51:36] all however God did dealt with him God
[51:39] showed him the promised land you can't
[51:41] show me a house this is your house and
[51:43] don't let me go look in the
[51:46] rooms huh I want to see the rooms in
[51:49] there see and I just somehow believe
[51:51] that God showed him amen the promised
[51:54] land he didn't go there
[51:58] physically but spiritually he
[52:04] saw you said well I don't know about
[52:06] that well let me put it this way he was
[52:09] standing on Mount
[52:12] Transfiguration can't get it no good
[52:14] than
[52:15] that huh you can't get it no better than
[52:17] that right here he was amen he couldn't
[52:20] go over there then but now he's standing
[52:23] on my Transfiguration
[52:28] people of God look at this thing and
[52:31] here God comes along and he does
[52:33] something for you the Bride of Jesus
[52:35] Christ that he's never done for nobody
[52:37] no other age he only took Paul up into
[52:40] that Dimension Paul came back and told
[52:42] him some of the things brother random
[52:46] comes back and he says I saw you there
[52:48] amen
[52:50] amen hallelujah Blessed Assurance amen
[52:54] Jesus is my
[52:55] oh what a for of Glory
[53:01] Divine no other
[53:04] age was able a prophet able to go over
[53:08] and come back and tell them about all
[53:12] the people he didn't go through the
[53:14] mansions and whatever this and that and
[53:16] the streets of gold you know what he
[53:18] came he brought back the precious fruit
[53:21] that which was more precious to God than
[53:23] anything and that was The Souls of the
[53:25] people amen Millions upon Millions were
[53:29] there and they come and says oh my
[53:31] precious
[53:34] brother oh
[53:36] my one more this is it because I want
[53:40] you to understand and you've heard me
[53:42] say this many
[53:43] times judgment begins at the house of
[53:46] God this scripture has come so alive to
[53:49] me because I realize by the grace of God
[53:52] that what I do will affect the whole of
[53:56] De Mo and
[54:02] anching it had gotten down to the point
[54:05] that God held the flood up until it was
[54:07] one man
[54:09] left the whole flood and when he saw
[54:12] that the people w't go repent he saved
[54:14] that one man took him out of here him
[54:17] and his household is that right so you
[54:19] see it was up until that point God don't
[54:21] love destroying
[54:23] people God would that no man would
[54:26] perish he would that all men come into
[54:28] repentance but he know they're not going
[54:30] to do it but he'll work that righteous
[54:33] seed there he'll leave him there as long
[54:35] as he possibly
[54:37] can to give nobody an
[54:41] excuse eight Souls were
[54:44] saved in the days of Noah huh Enoch
[54:48] one huh somebody said well I can't
[54:51] believe you know brother said to Enoch
[54:54] Enoch uh
[54:55] Noah saw Enoch leav and that's when he
[54:58] knew I said thank God for a
[55:02] prophet people said well he wasn't there
[55:04] I said thank God for a prophet I said
[55:07] because God took Noah right there at the
[55:09] day of
[55:10] Enoch he was a prophet he saw him leave
[55:14] he saw him
[55:16] leave in two different times spans he
[55:20] saw him leave just as much as uh Jesus
[55:22] saw um um brother bandam saw ad and
[55:27] Eve amen he knew the
[55:32] wise he knew these Skeptics were looking
[55:34] to there say see he made a contradiction
[55:36] he didn't make no contradiction Noah saw
[55:39] Enoch leave amen now ask God for the
[55:43] Revelation he'll give it to you brother
[55:45] B said whenever it look like there's a
[55:46] contradiction he say seek God there's a
[55:48] revelation and that's what I did and I
[55:51] saw God and God showed me he said Noah
[55:53] was a prophet Hall that's it you know
[55:57] what people said well he made a mistake
[56:00] amen when when he said uh that uh he
[56:02] went up to the Feast of Pentecost he
[56:05] did he so also went up to the Feast of
[56:07] the unleavened
[56:10] bread he hello what's the feast that
[56:13] they said he went up to the Feast of
[56:17] um Passover yes the Passover now let me
[56:21] tell you something they didn't have no
[56:22] vehicles like we do they don't go up to
[56:25] one feast and said well I'll go back
[56:26] home and I'll come back up to the next
[56:28] one they stayed
[56:32] there but that was laid there in the
[56:34] message to trip you they wrestle and do
[56:37] wrestle to their own destruction
[56:40] amen but he stay I I sought the Lord on
[56:44] him he stayed there and that's why
[56:47] brother you think he mentioned Pentecost
[56:49] all those time like he didn't know what
[56:50] he was talking about who was speaking
[56:52] through the man you don't have to answer
[56:55] and say Amen but I know what people
[56:58] think but this is a matter of life and
[57:05] death so people look at it and they say
[57:08] well he made a
[57:09] mistake cuz this is what the Bible
[57:13] says God have
[57:15] mercy I wondered about it too till I
[57:18] sought God you keep what your
[57:21] understanding is until you seek God ask
[57:23] God what he did
[57:26] huh because God laid right there and
[57:28] showed me they stayed there but the
[57:31] feast that God wanted to emphasize was
[57:34] the Feast of
[57:39] Pentecost
[57:41] so but he was there he had to be there
[57:44] he was the word and those feasts were
[57:47] the Feast of the lamb and he had to be
[57:51] there to every one of
[57:53] them and and it was one after the other
[57:56] so you got to realize what was going on
[57:58] but y'all in this day that's why God
[58:00] kept saying it the way he said it he
[58:02] know it was going to stumble some but
[58:05] for that bride it is given to you to
[58:07] know the mysteries of this thing
[58:09] amen see because that's the foundation
[58:13] those are the things that now the
[58:14] critics are actually attacking because
[58:16] they don't understand it they didn't see
[58:18] God for
[58:19] it what you going to say about
[58:22] it cuz you don't see it and no
[58:24] understand it you better understand what
[58:26] a prophet
[58:29] is anyway I don't know why I dropped
[58:32] that
[58:33] in because of your mindset you got to
[58:36] recognize your what where you're
[58:39] thinking right you got to have
[58:41] confidence amen whether I understand it
[58:43] or not I know it seemed like blind
[58:46] leadership but the the the sheeps are so
[58:48] dumb they don't know which way they
[58:49] going anyhow it's only the shepherd amen
[58:53] thank Lord
[58:55] Lord and when you can trust the Shepherd
[58:57] that God and I told a brother this not
[58:59] long ago I said if brother Brandon
[59:01] wasn't the prophet for our age we better
[59:02] find another one quickly cuz time is
[59:04] running
[59:07] out hello and now if he donees messed up
[59:10] we messed up too because if one word
[59:12] brought us into the chaos every word has
[59:14] to be
[59:15] reestablished and so if one word doesn't
[59:17] mess us up and now brother brandham done
[59:19] messed up and go now who where who how
[59:22] we going to get out of
[59:23] this
[59:27] lean not to your own understanding all
[59:30] I'm saying is by the grace of God
[59:31] there's more to this message that a lot
[59:33] of people are seeing amen you know right
[59:35] now God is unveiling it to us showing us
[59:38] amen by the grace of God where you
[59:40] there's a question there's an answer but
[59:42] God gives the answer hallelujah how in
[59:45] the world brother Brandon would have
[59:46] known serpent seed if God had not spoken
[59:48] it to him first
[59:50] amen see if your God our God must speak
[59:53] to you whenever there's a question there
[59:55] there's an answer there somewhere you
[59:58] just got to wait on God to give it
[1:00:01] there's a lot of things left off the
[1:00:05] pages you love the Lord amen you got to
[1:00:08] believe folks you got to have faith am
[1:00:10] you got to trust this message with all
[1:00:12] your heart because if if this if this
[1:00:14] ain't it what we going to trust I mean I
[1:00:17] mean you understand what I'm saying amen
[1:00:20] and all you got to do is ask him that's
[1:00:22] that's what he's there for
[1:00:25] that's what he's there for to give us
[1:00:27] understanding of what he's
[1:00:29] saying and if we're going to trust him
[1:00:31] we need to trust him with all of our
[1:00:32] heart not in skepticism or whatever we
[1:00:35] need to just go forth and say this is
[1:00:36] what it is you know brother say serpen
[1:00:39] sced and didn't even know how to back it
[1:00:40] up at the
[1:00:43] time he didn't he didn't know how to
[1:00:46] back it up but he know what the God told
[1:00:48] him he said it and so you and I must
[1:00:51] understand by the grace of God sometime
[1:00:53] we have to say things ye don't don't
[1:00:54] even understand or even know how to back
[1:00:56] it up but if you wait on God he'll show
[1:00:58] you just how to back it up you love the
[1:01:02] Lord let's
[1:01:11] stand dear heavenly father God we come
[1:01:13] before you Lord as humbly as we know how
[1:01:15] and we thank you for your grace and your
[1:01:17] mercy Lord truly Lord you've been good
[1:01:20] to us and you've been better to us than
[1:01:21] we've been to ourselves and father we
[1:01:24] pray Lord God that you forgive us and
[1:01:26] cleanse us from all our unrighteousness
[1:01:29] help us dear Jesus oh God to walk in
[1:01:31] your way not to add or take away
[1:01:34] anything from your thoughts give us
[1:01:36] strength Lord to repent Lord when we
[1:01:38] find ourselves wrong
[1:01:40] help Father God to move forward in your
[1:01:44] name Jesus Christ we pray
[1:01:49] amen
