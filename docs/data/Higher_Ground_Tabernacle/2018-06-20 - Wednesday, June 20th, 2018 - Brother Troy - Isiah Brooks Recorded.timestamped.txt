[15:39] talking to me about his his ex and this
[15:41] what was going on he had been separated
[15:43] for six years and then he started saying
[15:46] you know he says you know start bringing

[15:54] talking how he he started asking me for
[15:57] prayer he says says I need someone to

[16:47] so the next morning I was on my knees
[16:49] and and lower

[19:59] just as we get into the service let's
[20:01] open our Bibles were the Lord to 2nd
[20:05] Peter chapter 3 and we'll read from the
[20:11] eighth verse down to the fifteenth verse
[20:21] learning to lean on Jesus amen we'll
[20:25] speak a message tonight called counting
[20:28] slackness you'll see as that comes from
[20:31] the scriptures here in 2nd Peter
[20:33] second Peter 3 start with the eighth
[20:36] verse and it says but beloved be not
[20:40] ignorant of this one thing that one day
[20:44] is with the Lord as a thousand years and
[20:46] a thousand years as one day the Lord is
[20:50] not slack concerning his promise as some
[20:54] men count slackness but is
[20:57] long-suffering to us-ward not willing
[21:00] that any should perish but that all
[21:02] should come to repentance but the day of
[21:05] the Lord will come as a thief in the
[21:06] night and the wish the heavens shall
[21:08] pass away with a great noise and the
[21:10] elements shall melt with fervent heat
[21:12] and the earth also and the works that
[21:14] are therein shall be burned up seeing
[21:17] then all these things shall be dissolved
[21:19] what manner of persons ought you to be
[21:22] in all holy conversation and godliness
[21:24] looking for and hasting unto the coming
[21:27] of the day of God wherein the heavens
[21:29] being on fire shall would be dissolved
[21:32] and the elements shall melt with fervent
[21:34] eat nevertheless we according to his
[21:36] promise look for new heavens and new
[21:39] earth wherein dwelleth righteousness
[21:42] where for a look wherefore beloved
[21:44] seeing that you look for such things be
[21:46] diligent they may be found of him in
[21:49] peace and without spot and blameless and
[21:51] account that the long-suffering of our
[21:54] Lord is salvation even as our brother
[21:57] put our beloved brother Paul also
[21:59] according to the wisdom given unto him
[22:01] have written unto you amen let's just
[22:05] power hasn't word of Prayer Heavenly
[22:07] Father we just want to thank you Lord
[22:08] for the scripture lord I just ask you
[22:10] Lord that you would allow me father - to
[22:14] speak this and its fullness the way that
[22:16] their just the way that you intended it
[22:17] to be spoken father may there be nothing
[22:19] inside me that would hinder your gospel
[22:21] from going out Lord Lord may there be
[22:23] nothing in the and the hearts of these
[22:25] believers I've assembled here from
[22:26] receiving the word Lord that you speak
[22:29] tonight and I pray Lord that you'd
[22:30] soften every heart Lord to receive your
[22:32] gospel in the name of Jesus Christ we
[22:34] pray amen amen god bless you you can be
[22:38] seated amen counting slackness the Lord
[22:44] is not slack concerning his promise as
[22:46] some men count slots as some men count
[22:50] slackness amen some people when they see
[22:54] a promise they doesn't happen right away
[22:56] and no the raid just discount the
[22:59] promise amen or cancer well he's slower
[23:03] if there's just slow that's not gonna
[23:05] happen but tonight we're gonna really be
[23:08] going through the calendar of God amen
[23:10] God has a calendar and everything
[23:13] happens right on time amen everything
[23:17] happens right in this new season amen
[23:20] nothing is late no nothing is nothing is
[23:23] running behind everything is running
[23:25] just the way God has intended to run
[23:28] amen everything is happening right on
[23:30] God's timepiece right in the time and
[23:32] it's season of when is supposed to
[23:34] happen amen and some people might think
[23:36] well this should happen at this time or
[23:38] maybe this should happen now or or a
[23:40] little bit later or a little bit sooner
[23:41] but but we cannot say anything but what
[23:44] God is going to do it right in his time
[23:46] a man in his time
[23:47] is perfect amen when we submit ourselves
[23:50] to the timing of God amen when it'll all
[23:55] the will discover the peace that passes
[23:57] all understanding Amen because when you
[24:01] begin to think that well maybe God has
[24:02] forgotten his his promise we you can't
[24:06] start counting that as script counting
[24:08] goddess being slack amen as God is is
[24:12] being lazy too to bring his promises to
[24:15] pass amen that's that's speaking of
[24:18] doubt in your own self amen you're no
[24:21] you're no longer operating in faith but
[24:23] you are now operating in doubt amen and
[24:25] the man that operates in doubt will
[24:27] never see anything happen from God amen
[24:30] but the man that operates in faith
[24:31] believing that God will see to his
[24:34] promises that God is watching over his
[24:36] word to see their little it'll come to
[24:39] pass in your life that man is gonna see
[24:41] something a man that God that man will
[24:44] see that God is operating a ride on time
[24:46] ride on time every single thing that he
[24:49] said that he'll do he will do it amen
[24:52] now I got a whirlwind of about four
[24:54] different pastors of scriptures I want
[24:56] to go through here real quick let's turn
[24:58] our Bibles to Luke chapter 24 amen and
[25:04] if I go faster you can turn well you
[25:06] have to turn faster amen Luke 24:49 says
[25:12] and behold I send the promise of my
[25:16] father upon you but tarry in the city of
[25:20] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[25:23] from on high now Jesus Christ was
[25:26] speaking here that to his disciples amen
[25:29] and he is speaking to him right before
[25:31] he gets right before he gets carried
[25:33] away and he's given to them a promise
[25:36] and this promise is going to happen
[25:38] right on God's calendar amen
[25:40] he says I behold I send the promise of
[25:44] my father upon you Amen Jesus has
[25:47] already seen it he already knows what
[25:48] the promise is he's seen it come - he's
[25:50] seen it coming to pass and he's now
[25:52] expressing that to them the word is
[25:54] going forth out of his mouth and it's
[25:56] going to happen right according to God's
[25:58] timing amen he says I'm behold I send
[26:00] the problem
[26:01] of my father upon you but tarry in the
[26:04] city of Jerusalem until you be endued
[26:07] with power from on high
[26:09] amen and maybe those disciples didn't
[26:11] quite realize it but they were standing
[26:13] right on the pages of God's calendar
[26:14] amen as they are counting off the fifty
[26:17] days you know from the from the Passover
[26:19] that was slain to the day of Pentecost
[26:21] there is going to be a Pentecostal feast
[26:23] Amen there's gonna be a time when the
[26:25] Holy Spirit of God is gonna be poured
[26:27] upon upon our church fathers amen and
[26:29] that then that Holy Spirit of God is
[26:31] gonna do them with power from on high so
[26:34] that they don't have to preach this
[26:35] gospel by themselves a man so they don't
[26:38] have to live this Christian life by
[26:39] themselves so they don't have to try to
[26:41] bear fruit unto God by themselves but
[26:44] know the power from on high is and it
[26:46] come down right up in God's timing on
[26:48] the day Playhouse and it's gonna fill
[26:50] them with the Holy Ghost amen what they
[26:53] do they sit there and they waited and
[26:55] they waited in Jerusalem amen
[26:59] for the promise that God had spoken to
[27:01] them and sure enough when God's countour
[27:03] got to the right position God's Word
[27:05] came to pass just like you said it would
[27:08] amen now let's turn over to Acts chapter
[27:11] 2 verse 39
[27:23] I got a lot of scriptures I'm just gonna
[27:26] lay a foundation here so stay with me
[27:29] amen Acts chapter 2 verse 39 first we'll
[27:37] start with verse 38 says then Peter said
[27:39] unto them repent and be baptized
[27:41] everyone you in the name of Jesus Christ
[27:44] for the remission of sins and ye shall
[27:46] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[27:49] the promise is unto you and to your
[27:52] children and to all that are afar off
[27:54] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[27:56] call so whenever a man repents and is
[28:00] baptized in the name of Lord Jesus
[28:01] Christ he is now on the pages of God's
[28:05] calendar amen
[28:06] and God has a promise for that man amen
[28:09] and that man is gonna receive the
[28:11] promise of the Father amen
[28:13] and is gonna be filled with the Holy
[28:14] Ghost amen it's not a different Holy
[28:16] Ghost but it's the same Holy Ghost that
[28:18] fell on the day of Pentecost back there
[28:20] amen is not a different Holy Ghost but
[28:23] is the same because Jesus Christ is the
[28:25] same yesterday today and forever
[28:27] now it's turned forward a few chapters
[28:28] to Acts 717 this is three out of five
[28:33] scriptures I want to go to Acts 717
[28:52] it says this talking about the time of
[28:55] Moses there and it says but when the
[28:57] time of the promise drew nigh which God
[29:00] had sworn to Abraham the people grew and
[29:03] multiplied in Egypt until another king
[29:06] arose which knew not Joseph Amen the
[29:10] same dealt subtly with our kindred and
[29:12] evil and treated our fathers so that
[29:14] they cast out their young children to
[29:16] the end that they might not live in
[29:18] which time Moses was born and was
[29:20] exceeding fair and nourished up in his
[29:23] father's house three months amen and you
[29:26] know the rest of the story
[29:27] God had a promise that was laying out
[29:29] there amen that promise had not been
[29:32] fulfilled yet but it was to be fulfilled
[29:34] upon a certain time because he said that
[29:36] they would be there in 400 years and
[29:38] then God would raise them up a delivery
[29:40] men and so in God's when when God's
[29:43] promise began to meet God's time and
[29:47] time and promise got together amen
[29:50] and they met together on the pages of
[29:52] the calendar the people that were living
[29:53] on that day were blessed they meant why
[29:56] because God's deliver a rose up and
[29:58] delivered his people a man you cannot
[30:00] stop us for God's promises and when time
[30:02] and promise meet together whoever is
[30:05] living on that certain page in time of
[30:08] the calendar they're gonna see the
[30:09] blessings of God amen they're gonna see
[30:11] something and as long as they're patient
[30:13] even as long as they're patient and as
[30:15] they're trusting to the Lord they're
[30:17] gonna see something mighty come to pass
[30:19] whenever people are at a time where time
[30:22] and promise are coming together time
[30:24] promise are meeting together and they're
[30:26] standing on the pages of God's calendar
[30:27] that something is gonna happen amen now
[30:32] let's turn over to Acts chapter 13 verse
[30:35] 23
[30:49] I'll start with the 22nd verse it says
[30:52] and when he had removed him and raised
[30:54] up unto them David to be their king to
[30:57] whom also he gave testimony and said I
[31:00] have found David the son of Jesse a man
[31:02] after my own heart which shall fulfill
[31:04] all my will of this man seed of God
[31:08] according to his promise raised unto
[31:11] Israel a savior Jesus amen
[31:14] God had a promise that he would raise up
[31:17] a man now David came and fulfilled all
[31:19] God's will amen he fulfilled he was a
[31:22] man after David's own heart why did
[31:23] Jesus Christ - he came and fulfilled all
[31:26] God's will why did he do that he did
[31:28] that for us a man he fulfilled the will
[31:30] of God for us then why is he do he sends
[31:32] his spirit down upon us we can now
[31:35] fulfill his will by submitting to his
[31:37] Spirit amen
[31:38] what so the promises of God may affect
[31:41] all right now we'll go down to the last
[31:42] one here acts 26 God has promises that
[31:47] have to come to pass and they kind of
[31:50] pass in God's own timing
[32:09] except
[32:10] six verse 15 Paul said and I said who
[32:14] art thou Lord this is Paul when he was
[32:17] slain on the road Damascus everyone
[32:19] spitting down by the by the light he
[32:21] said who who art thou Lord he said I am
[32:24] Jesus whom thou persecute us
[32:26] ba rise stand upon thy feet for I've
[32:29] appeared under thee for this purpose to
[32:32] make the a minister and a witness both
[32:34] of these things which thou hast seen and
[32:37] of those things in which I will appear
[32:38] unto thee delivering the from the people
[32:41] and from the Gentiles unto whom now I
[32:43] send thee to oh now here's why he sent
[32:46] him to open their eyes to turn them from
[32:49] darkness to light and from the power of
[32:52] Satan unto God that they may receive
[32:54] forgiveness of sins and inheritance
[32:57] among them which are sanctified by faith
[32:59] that is in me amen
[33:02] that multi-purpose that God was sending
[33:05] st. Paul the same reason that he's also
[33:07] sending us amen
[33:09] he's sending us what to open their eyes
[33:10] to turn them from the darkness to light
[33:13] from the power of Satan unto God and
[33:15] that they may receive forgiveness of
[33:17] sins and inheritance among them they're
[33:19] sanctified by faith that isn't me hey
[33:21] man if you're struggling with any one of
[33:23] those ions let me tell you you got to go
[33:25] back and read the scriptures over again
[33:27] amen if you're so strongly with
[33:29] understanding forgiveness of sins if
[33:31] you're living underneath the power of
[33:33] Satan instead the power of God you need
[33:34] to come back to the gospel here because
[33:36] there is a promise for you amen
[33:39] now I read all those four for this
[33:42] purpose that God has a lot of promises
[33:45] they're sitting out there amen and God
[33:48] has a calendar for them to happen now
[33:51] God has set forth a pattern for a
[33:53] Christian payment he has a pattern that
[33:55] man when he repents and when he gets
[33:59] baptized in the name with Lord Jesus
[34:01] Christ you are now standing upon the
[34:04] calendar of God amen and God has certain
[34:07] promises that are laid up in store for
[34:09] those that will walk in this truth amen
[34:12] and those promises cannot be taken away
[34:14] amen they they have to come to pass
[34:17] every true believer must walk through
[34:20] those pages of the calendar with God
[34:22] amen it's just like the
[34:24] just like the churn of Israel they had a
[34:25] calendar in that calendar they had the
[34:27] feasts amen and at the beginning in the
[34:30] in the springtime and those feasts had
[34:32] to do with their agricultural seasons
[34:34] amen so what would they do they would go
[34:36] forth in the as they went through their
[34:38] agricultural seasons amen that they have
[34:41] the beginning of the year they'd have
[34:44] their Passover amen the beginning of the
[34:48] earth started with the password
[34:49] everything started with the the Passover
[34:52] guy was I will pass over you that was
[34:54] the when when they had the first
[34:56] Passover the God told them this will be
[34:59] the beginning of the year unto you this
[35:02] will be your New Year's every year when
[35:04] you celebrate the Passover and this will
[35:06] be a forever a covenant unto you through
[35:09] all of your generations that every year
[35:11] that you have from this time forward it
[35:13] will be you'll start your year off with
[35:16] the Passover a manna for a Christian it
[35:18] starts the same way every man when he we
[35:21] first must recognize his atonement amen
[35:24] he first must recognize a lamb there's a
[35:26] lamb slain in the morning every day and
[35:28] there's a lamb slain evening amen every
[35:30] day every day every day they had they
[35:32] had to recognize that their lamb was
[35:34] slain amen and I will write when you
[35:37] when you rise up in the morning amen you
[35:40] have to recognize that there was a lamb
[35:42] slain for you amen rise up off your bed
[35:45] calling upon the name of the Lord Jesus
[35:47] he'll give you songs on your bed of the
[35:49] night you raise up in the morning you
[35:51] recognize your atonement you recognize
[35:53] that there was a lamb slain for you amen
[35:55] and it's a beginning of a new day for
[35:57] you a beginning of a new year for you
[35:59] and when you first become a Christian
[36:01] it's a beginning of a new life for you
[36:02] amen you're the things of the past SAR
[36:05] dead and gone amen you're recognizing
[36:07] your atonement that now God is gonna
[36:09] wipe away your sins as far as East is
[36:11] from the West and I have an atonement
[36:13] for you amen
[36:14] and every household it wasn't just for
[36:17] the priests to do here but every
[36:19] household had to do it and recognized it
[36:22] themselves as soon as every household
[36:24] here must first come to recognize that
[36:26] the Passover lamb has been slain for
[36:28] them Amy if you don't if you have never
[36:31] yet recognized that Jesus Christ died
[36:33] for your sins then you have a yes start
[36:35] upon this journey but what about the
[36:37] first time
[36:37] that you look at that cross amen and you
[36:40] realize that when you feel that
[36:42] conviction upon your heart and you rise
[36:43] oh my I've sinned about when God says
[36:46] turn to me there is a sacrifice for you
[36:48] and that is the beginning of a year for
[36:50] you that has a beginning of a new
[36:52] beginning for you and you're now
[36:54] standing on the pages of God's calendar
[36:56] and there are certain things coming down
[36:58] the road they cannot be they're gonna
[37:01] happen in God's own season for your life
[37:02] amen they have to happen Amen God and
[37:06] God is not slack concerning his promises
[37:08] amen they have to come to pass amen so
[37:13] so so what so let's say so once you go
[37:17] from the Passover on down through the
[37:19] calendar throughout the year the Jewish
[37:21] year they've gone through their winter
[37:23] time and now they're now it's the spring
[37:25] time and they're recognizing their
[37:26] Passover then life starts springing up
[37:29] everywhere amen there's life over here
[37:32] there's life over there
[37:33] or the first thing they celebrate the
[37:35] barley crop and then they begin to
[37:36] celebrate the the wheats and they have
[37:39] to bring forth the patent the
[37:40] firstfruits amen and so whether they do
[37:44] they fertile a start counting off fifty
[37:47] days from the day of Passover amen as
[37:50] soon as they recognize their atonement
[37:52] the very moment that they cling to the
[37:57] cross and they create cling to the blood
[37:59] of the Lamb a time timer starts clicking
[38:03] off in heaven amen amen and it's what is
[38:06] it counting down to that you shall
[38:08] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[38:10] amen you're gonna receive it upon God's
[38:13] own time a man for your life you're
[38:16] gonna receive what are they doing
[38:17] they're counting down in the Jewish
[38:19] counter there is fifty days from the day
[38:21] of Passover to the day of Pentecost 50
[38:24] days counting down until the Pentecostal
[38:26] feast and the Pentecostal feast was a
[38:30] Pentecostal feast the first time the
[38:34] wheat harvest began to appear amen
[38:37] now I didn't appear everywhere all at
[38:39] once but they appeared on the high
[38:41] places first off upon the mountains on
[38:44] the high places first you can look up to
[38:46] the hills and they're up on the hills as
[38:48] the wheat harvest is starting to in the
[38:50] high elevations as a star
[38:52] to grow a man what do we do we look up
[38:54] to the high places Amy we look up to our
[38:56] fathers our Pentecostal fathers we look
[38:58] up to the first fruits of Pentecost amen
[39:00] and where the fruits first began to
[39:02] appear amen
[39:04] well it was the first it was the first
[39:06] time now first they had the barley cop
[39:08] remember
[39:08] and the barley crop has leaven in it
[39:11] amen so what they do
[39:13] they had the right at the time of the
[39:15] Passover they had a barley crop amen so
[39:19] they've recognized their atonement and
[39:20] the fruits are coming up are still mixed
[39:22] with leaven amen all the time the fruits
[39:26] are still mixed with lemon from that
[39:27] time over they're counting off till the
[39:29] day of Pentecost Aemon but once the day
[39:32] of Pentecost appears now we're beginning
[39:34] to see the firstfruits of the wheat
[39:35] harvest and the we harvest doesn't have
[39:37] leaven and amen so so the so the so the
[39:41] so the wheat when the wheat is also in
[39:45] harvest now we begin to recognize fruits
[39:47] that are appearing amen that are not
[39:49] leavened by the sins of our flesh why
[39:51] because we've been sealed with a baptism
[39:53] of the Holy Ghost now we're no longer
[39:54] working upon our own flesh if anybody's
[39:57] ever remembered about the time of back
[39:59] before you have filled with the Holy
[40:01] Ghost amen
[40:02] trying does when you first trying to
[40:04] serve God with all your might
[40:06] trying to do the things that are right
[40:07] and you're in yours mixed with your own
[40:09] work so you just don't can't seem to get
[40:11] up but all sudden God comes down amen
[40:14] and he seals you with the baptism of the
[40:16] Holy Ghost
[40:17] he fills you with the Holy Ghost then
[40:19] sudden what all sudden the the the acts
[40:21] that happened in your life what is it
[40:22] it's a new harvest in your life now it's
[40:25] no longer the fruits of something else
[40:26] but but as God's fruits are springing up
[40:29] in your life amen amen and yo you know
[40:31] as you go down through God's calendar
[40:33] you know brother Brahimi in the first he
[40:38] preached there in the in the Feast of
[40:40] Trumpets but then he appreciate again
[40:41] and question answers later but he was
[40:43] talking about the Feast of Trumpets he
[40:44] talks about that passage of time from
[40:47] Pentecost on down to the feast of the
[40:50] trumpets and when I was looking I was
[40:53] reading through I've been studying
[40:54] through that the last several days and
[40:56] through the agricultural because because
[40:59] you had the first the the wheat crop the
[41:02] firstfruits of the wheat crop was on the
[41:04] day of Pentecost
[41:05] they took the firstfruits and they
[41:07] harvested from the high elevations and
[41:09] they waived it before the Lord amen and
[41:11] the wheat spoke of Jesus Christ himself
[41:14] a mint they waved before the Lord
[41:16] so what that happens so then it's from
[41:18] that time on down through month after
[41:21] month as you're getting towards the
[41:22] Feast of the trumpets the the wheat crop
[41:24] begins maturing on the lower and the
[41:27] lower and the lower elevations amen amen
[41:29] and so now this not just those on the
[41:32] hike tops but now everybody is beginning
[41:34] to experience not just those back in the
[41:36] day of Pentecost but as time goes on
[41:38] everybody is because experiencing their
[41:41] wheat crop on in their due season amen
[41:44] amen in their own due season and now
[41:47] we've had what 7 church ages 7 months as
[41:49] brother branham said 7 months and then
[41:53] seventh months was the day of trumpets
[41:54] everybody when you get to the to the
[41:57] feast of the trumpets now everybody and
[41:59] every month at every elevation has
[42:02] experienced their their their crop of
[42:05] wheat
[42:06] everybody has expressed at your neighbor
[42:08] who who lived on the higher plane and he
[42:10] was able to bring his firstfruits over
[42:12] to the priests amen but now you yourself
[42:14] you yourself have experience in your own
[42:16] season in your own day in your own age
[42:19] you have your own crop of wheat every
[42:21] man must have his own his own fruit in
[42:24] its due season amen because in the land
[42:29] of Judea was a hilly land and crops
[42:32] matured at different elevations at
[42:34] different times a man so the man that
[42:37] lived down here in in Bethlehem or in
[42:40] Jericho would receipt would have his
[42:42] fruit mature at different time than
[42:44] those that lived up in Jerusalem amen
[42:47] because because of Bethlehem and Jericho
[42:50] will be at different elevations amen and
[42:54] so so the same thing is we at different
[42:57] ages than the apostles receive our own
[43:00] crop in its due season time and promise
[43:03] meet together in our lives just like
[43:05] time and promise met together for them
[43:08] in their season amen and so Jesus Christ
[43:10] is the same yesterday today and forever
[43:13] amen amen now as soon as as soon as that
[43:17] first fruit
[43:18] amen was was snipped off there in the in
[43:23] the third month they had the the
[43:26] Passover is in the first month the the
[43:28] Feast of Pentecost is in the third month
[43:30] and then the Feast of Trumpets is in the
[43:32] seventh month and the Feast of the
[43:34] trumpets was the end of all harvests
[43:37] everything has been harvested every crop
[43:40] every grape every barley every every
[43:43] every everything all everything has been
[43:45] harvested at that time amen
[43:47] but but there's a space of time between
[43:50] the between the the firstfruits of the
[43:53] wheat and the Feast of the trumpets and
[43:58] there's a long season there and it's
[44:00] their hot season it's their dry season
[44:04] and a sudden heat shows up and and all
[44:07] of a sudden as the Sun begins beating
[44:09] down and and and paint away elevation
[44:12] you can start having a hard time with
[44:13] your fruits but but God said I will give
[44:16] you rain and it's due season hey man
[44:18] we're going at that scripture here in a
[44:20] little bit but God said I will give you
[44:21] rain and Dew season if you receive the
[44:23] rain and Dew season then you'll be safe
[44:26] from the heat that is gonna come amen
[44:28] amen
[44:29] so that passage of time know that during
[44:32] the seven church ages those that are
[44:34] that lift the hot season a mint we've
[44:36] all had our season and heat amen
[44:39] but what are we doing we're coming down
[44:41] to the coast of the piece of Trumpets
[44:43] now
[44:43] amen we're in the seventh months amen
[44:47] we're coming to that we're in the
[44:49] seventh church age we're coming to our
[44:51] own due season hey man were the last to
[44:55] receive their wheat harvest a man and
[44:57] now now and when when through out though
[45:00] that period of season lots of things
[45:02] become start popping up in the
[45:05] agricultural because first they have
[45:07] their wheat amen and then they have
[45:09] their then they have their the grapes
[45:13] and then they have their figs and then
[45:17] they have their walnuts but then they
[45:19] have their but then all of a sudden in
[45:21] the we've gone through the first month
[45:23] the third month but then the fifth month
[45:24] all of a sudden now that the grapes
[45:27] begin to appear and they begin to make
[45:29] the oil and the wine right before the
[45:31] right before they get to the
[45:32] month they get in the six months they
[45:34] start getting the grapes harvesting the
[45:35] grapes and things start making their oil
[45:37] in their wine amen because they because
[45:39] the grapes and the and olives mature at
[45:42] the same time amen so what do we do
[45:45] right here at the right here at the end
[45:46] is we're we've gone to our dry season
[45:48] amen and we're beginning to harvest the
[45:51] oil in the grapes and as we're entering
[45:53] to the Laodicean age Nelson the oil is
[45:56] being poured upon the church amen
[45:58] she's experienced her dry season through
[46:00] the church ages but God says I I have
[46:03] not left myself without a witness amen
[46:05] I'll pour out myself again and you know
[46:07] I send out my olive I'll send out my oil
[46:10] I'll send out that's why if that's we
[46:11] promise to the Laodicean church I will
[46:14] have eye salve for you I'll have an
[46:16] anointing for you I'll give it to you
[46:18] and it'll save you from the things that
[46:20] are gonna happen in Laodicea
[46:23] amen amen let's turn over to Leviticus
[46:33] chapter 26 it has everything that
[46:42] happens in its own due season amen
[46:59] Leviticus 26 we'll read the third verse
[47:03] there in it and says if you will walk in
[47:09] my statutes and keep my Commandments and
[47:12] do them then I will give you rain and
[47:16] Dew season and the land shall yield her
[47:19] increase and the trees of the field
[47:21] shall yield their fruit and your
[47:24] threshing shall reach under the vintage
[47:26] and the vintage shall reach under the
[47:28] sowing time now look look what's saying
[47:30] there your threshing what's the
[47:32] threshing that's the threshing of the
[47:33] week
[47:33] Amen so at the very beginning of the
[47:36] time when the first fruits are threshed
[47:38] out that that meat will last you all the
[47:41] way to the middle layer cultural season
[47:43] to win the victory when the grapes are
[47:45] period in the fifth month a man when the
[47:47] grapes are appearing to the fifth month
[47:49] that will reach all the way until the
[47:51] sowing time which is clear over in the
[47:53] eighth month clear over past the Feast
[47:55] of Trumpets amen and so that you will
[47:57] have your you shall eat your bread in

[48:06] to you amen the meat will reach from
[48:08] season to season
[48:09] verse six and I will give peace in the
[48:11] land you shall lie down and none shall
[48:14] make you afraid amen I'll read evil
[48:17] beasts out of the land and either show
[48:18] the sword go through your land you shall
[48:20] chase your enemies and they shall fall
[48:22] before you by the sword five of you

[48:34] respect unto you and make you fruitful
[48:36] and multiply you and establish you
[48:38] establish my covenant with you why
[48:41] because they kept established statutes
[48:43] and keep his Commandments how do you
[48:45] keep God's statutes the only way to do
[48:49] it is to is to be filled with the Holy
[48:51] Ghost and to walk in the spirit every
[48:54] day that's the only way to do it
[48:56] he said I will write my statutes upon
[48:58] your heart amen
[48:59] and what was I doing your your life will
[49:02] go through even through the dry seasons
[49:04] I will have bread for you month in month
[49:06] out month in month out amen amen
[49:12] now let's turn or to Joel chapter two so
[49:30] the Jews has a march through there
[49:32] through their calendar they would every
[49:35] time they had to give thanks for every
[49:36] fruit amen Joel - Joel - jab chapter 2
[49:46] verse 23 and it says be glad they need
[49:52] children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord
[49:54] your God for he hath given you the
[49:56] former rain moderately on the heel cause
[49:58] to come down for you the rain the former
[50:02] rain and the latter rain in the first
[50:04] month and the floor shall be full of
[50:06] wheat in the fats shall overflow why
[50:08] Noah and I will restore to you the years
[50:12] that the locust has eaten the cake of
[50:15] worm and the caterpillar and the palm
[50:16] war my great army which I sent among you
[50:18] and he shall eat and plenty and be
[50:20] satisfied and praise the name of the
[50:22] Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously
[50:25] with you and my people shall never be
[50:26] ashamed amen
[50:28] so think about what the Jews have
[50:30] experienced
[50:33] year after year they celebrated the
[50:36] Passover hundreds thousands of years
[50:38] they celebrated the Passover and and it
[50:41] was testifying that Jesus Christ would
[50:43] show up on the earth amen but at the
[50:46] very moment that their Passover came
[50:48] that they came to celebrate their
[50:51] Passover the last time amen and when
[50:54] they're supposed to turn the corner and
[50:56] receive Christ and they missed it amen
[51:00] they the God's calendar for them stopped
[51:03] when they rejected Christ amen
[51:07] they were and they were to receive
[51:09] Christ and I was supposed to set off a
[51:12] chain of events amen and it's supposed
[51:15] to start ticking off a calendar so they
[51:17] could go from receiving it someday and
[51:19] they went from there to Pentecost amen
[51:22] and they received there that they
[51:24] received the Holy Spirit amen but for
[51:27] the Jews that it stopped for the Jewish
[51:28] nation they rejected Christ and it
[51:31] stopped right there their whole calendar
[51:33] was put on pause and so what happened to
[51:36] us the calendar was opened up to us and
[51:39] every single one of us has been preached
[51:41] to us the gospel a man going down age
[51:44] after age after ages has said to Paul
[51:46] there that to go and preach the promise
[51:48] unto them amen to turn them from the
[51:50] power of Satan unto power of God and
[51:53] that four Gospels in priest year after
[51:55] year and every man as soon as they
[51:57] receive as soon as they receive their
[51:59] atonement the calendar starts clicking
[52:01] off in their life amen you must receive
[52:04] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[52:06] hey man you over see now a few errs down
[52:08] a few now if you start counting God as
[52:10] slack concerning his promises and you're
[52:12] in doubt and you're never gonna receive
[52:14] it
[52:14] Amen you can't receive the Holy Ghost if
[52:17] you're doubting amen but one man when he
[52:20] wants four pence amen and all those
[52:24] programs said all the sins are chopped
[52:26] off right there
[52:27] amen you repent and then and then a man
[52:31] takes you into the waters say mint and
[52:33] you were baptized into the name of the
[52:35] Lord Jesus Christ and you come up out of
[52:38] that water
[52:38] amen where two are standing good Jesus
[52:41] Christ Himself said where two on earth
[52:43] our tests are on this earth or testify
[52:46] of any one thing what you bind on the
[52:48] earth I will bind it in the heavens a
[52:50] man went to stand in the water amen and
[52:54] you were baptized in the name of Lord
[52:56] Jesus Christ so you come up you're both
[52:57] testifying this man is dead to himself
[52:59] and he's alive under Christ Jesus
[53:02] a man at that point that point on what
[53:04] you testify on earth God testifies her
[53:07] in heaven
[53:07] well you bind there on the earth in the
[53:09] water he binds up in the heavens a man
[53:11] was it doest that binding starts a
[53:14] calendar Amos starts a process that if
