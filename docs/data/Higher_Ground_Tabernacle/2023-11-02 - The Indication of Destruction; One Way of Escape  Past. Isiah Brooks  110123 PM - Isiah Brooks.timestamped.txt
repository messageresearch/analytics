[24:09] getting ready uh
[24:13] ourselves to experience some things that
[24:16] only the Holy Ghost will
[24:22] be Genesis
[24:25] 71 and the Lord said unto
[24:28] Noah Come Thou and all thy house into
[24:31] the

[25:53] place holy spirit will have
[25:56] pre in your name Jesus Christ
[26:00] pray amen amen you may be
[26:04] seated I just uh want to say
[26:08] that I know for
[26:11] myself I have had
[26:14] uh some tremendous uh mind
[26:21] battles especially these last few
[26:26] days totally forgetting what brother Ram
[26:30] said successful
[26:34] meeting
[26:40] fight one thing I know about
[26:44] Warfare there is no way that you could
[26:46] be in a
[26:49] Warfare without receiving
[26:52] Scar and your
[26:54] scars is the evidence that you've been
[26:57] find
[27:00] encourage you
[27:02] tonight keep
[27:04] fting you know we we know we have the
[27:08] victory has been
[27:10] given nobody in this
[27:14] room can defeat
[27:16] Satan without God it is God who
[27:23] deat
[27:25] our i' like to preach a message
[27:29] tonight the indications of
[27:34] Destruction and I want you to remember
[27:37] tonight if I don't say anything
[27:40] else I want to say that the whole entire
[27:45] world is under the
[27:48] inspiration of
[27:51] Destruction they can't help
[27:53] it they can't get away from
[27:56] it
[27:58] prophecy must be
[28:00] fulfilled but
[28:03] remember we have a way of
[28:06] escape the thing that I
[28:09] see is that the world is
[28:14] Bewitched they they act as if they are
[28:16] in a
[28:19] days a days like
[28:24] trapped yeah you you know how a deer in
[28:27] head
[28:30] lights they can't
[28:33] move light hit they stuck
[28:37] there and and they just become
[28:43] pre and that is it seems as
[28:46] if everybody in the
[28:49] world has they're
[28:52] stuck you know they
[28:56] G because they wouldn't receive the
[29:00] truth the Bible said that God gave them
[29:03] over to a strong
[29:07] delusion a
[29:11] lie the world did not see
[29:14] it Hallelujah but the son of man was
[29:18] revealed in our
[29:20] day but they rejected
[29:23] him and because they rejected him
[29:27] rejected the
[29:29] gospel just
[29:31] America whole
[29:33] world is under this false
[29:38] illusion believing that they could make
[29:40] the world
[29:43] better the world cannot get
[29:46] better the scripture
[29:48] says evil sedu
[29:51] us shall wax worse and
[29:54] worse it's not going to get better
[29:59] and we even as
[30:01] Americans it's going to get
[30:04] better it's not going to get
[30:06] better hallelujah hallelujah when I
[30:11] look and I see the
[30:13] condition the world is
[30:16] in it takes me
[30:18] to uh Genesis
[30:22] 6 violence was
[30:25] everywhere women were
[30:28] beautiful it was
[30:30] [Music]
[30:31] overpopulated right and the and can
[30:35] people were the rulers of the
[30:39] country the
[30:44] intellects they they they did a lot of
[30:47] experiments
[30:49] Hallelujah said whatever they
[30:56] imagine in that day
[30:59] now is an
[31:03] indication it's it's a
[31:05] way it's
[31:07] evidence God is
[31:09] showing that
[31:12] judgment about to
[31:16] strike somebody the other
[31:18] day trying to tell
[31:21] them in America at this point in time
[31:26] you need to enjoy enjoy your
[31:30] life because it won't remain this
[31:37] way you're
[31:41] living you don't see the BS
[31:44] falling you are living under a good
[31:48] condition we're not in
[31:51] Pakistan not in
[31:53] Jerusalem we're not in Ukraine UK so we
[31:57] we ought to be
[31:58] grateful the that we have
[32:01] now because our day is
[32:06] coming said our day is
[32:10] coming hallelujah hallelujah we must be
[32:14] prepared oh my because the Bible says
[32:19] every
[32:20] Temptation God makes a way of
[32:25] escape the thing that get
[32:27] me because everybody is
