[6:50] pray for every request that is lifted up
[6:52] by these hands, Father. Lord, may you be
[6:55] very careful, Lord, to look them over

[18:17] me a right spirit. Saints of God. That
[18:20] is what we need to have the right
[18:22] spirit. You know, the power of God says
[18:25] you can be, you know, right in your
[18:27] doctrine and, you know, you're wrong in
[18:29] your spirit, but you could be wrong in
[18:30] your doctrine and if you're right in
[18:32] your spirit, you know, God could bring
[18:34] you back into that way. So, it's a
[18:36] beautiful thing to know that in this
[18:38] time and in this season that we could
[18:40] have the right spirit and we come to
[18:43] realize that that is the mind of Christ
[18:45] Jesus in this day that we living in. You
[18:48] the scripture speaks of all kind of
[18:50] mind. You know you have the reprobate
[18:52] mind. You know you have all different
[18:55] kind of the confused mind. You have the
[18:58] evil mind. But saints of God we must
[19:00] have the mind of Christ. That is the
[19:03] only mind that can set us as the word of
[19:06] God will set us free today. Shall we
[19:08] just bow our heads in prayer? Gracious
[19:11] God and heavenly father. Lord, we come
[19:16] this afternoon, this evening time in
[19:18] your presence, Lord. Oh God, we want to
[19:21] thank thee for your great love that you
[19:24] have shed abroad amongst your people,
[19:26] Lord, that we can come under your shed
[19:28] blood under one banner, Lord. Oh God, as
[19:31] you promised us in your word, Lord, as
[19:34] often as you do it in remembrance of me,
[19:36] we want to thank thee, Lord, for your
[19:38] grace that is being established towards
[19:41] us, Lord. that Lord we know that you'll
[19:43] come again Lord and you'll have the
[19:46] supper and you'll drink with us Lord we
[19:48] want to thank thee for this opportunity
[19:50] that you have given us Lord once again
[19:52] that we could come in your presence we
[19:54] pray God that you may speak to us lip to
[19:57] ear Lord we pray that every human
[19:59] element Lord would be hidden behind the
[20:01] veil that only you can be seen today
[20:04] Lord that whatever will be said and done
[20:06] Lord that we can be uplifted Lord to
[20:08] glorify your name that oh God our faith
[20:11] can be lift lifted up to be in a a
[20:13] raptured condition, Lord, that when you
[20:15] shall appear, oh God, we shall be just
[20:17] like unto you, Lord. We give you all the
[20:20] praise and we give you all the glory and
[20:21] the honor, Lord, in Jesus name. Amen.
[20:25] Praise God. Amen. You love the Lord.
[20:27] Amen. Amen. You're glad to be here again
[20:29] in the house of God. Hallelujah. The
[20:31] best place that we can be on earth is
[20:34] coming into the house of God.
[20:36] Hallelujah. And we truly want to tell
[20:38] God that the season that we living in,
[20:40] we ought to be sitting in heavenly
[20:41] places. Amen. With him. Amen.
[20:44] Hallelujah. And our desire will be
[20:46] fulfilled. Hallelujah. By the word of
[20:48] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Praise
[20:51] God. At this time, without any delay, we
[20:54] like to turn your attention in the word
[20:56] of God in the book of Genesis, chapter
[20:59] 1, reading from verses 1 to five. Praise
[21:04] God. I'd like to preach on a little
[21:06] thought this evening. Creating the right
[21:09] atmosphere. Hallelujah. You know, it
[21:11] means a lot to be in the right
[21:13] atmosphere. Amen. And we want to thank
[21:15] God this evening that God has through
[21:18] the eyes of the prophet. There's so many
[21:20] things that we can see in the
[21:22] scriptures. Hallelujah. And the prophet
[21:24] of God come with inspiration of the
[21:27] living word today that we can see what
[21:30] it's all about. Praise God. In the
[21:32] beginning, God created a heaven and the
[21:35] earth, and the earth was without form
[21:37] and void, and darkness was upon the face
[21:41] of the deep. And the spirit of God moved
[21:44] upon the face of the waters. And God
[21:47] said, "Let there be light, and there was
[21:51] light." Amen. And God saw the light that
[21:54] it was good. And God divided the light
[21:58] from the darkness. And God called the
[22:01] light day and darkness he called night
[22:05] and the evening and the morning were the
[22:08] first day. Gracious God and heavenly
[22:12] father, we want to thank you this
[22:14] evening for your great love and your
[22:17] great mercy towards us Lord that Lord
[22:20] you have set every captive free Lord and
[22:23] Lord you have turned every darkness away
[22:25] Lord of the light of this gospel that
[22:28] has come in this day Lord we pray God
[22:30] that you may bless the people richly
[22:32] Lord as we feast upon your word Lord
[22:35] that this light can come in Lord that we
[22:37] could recognize Lord oh God who We are
[22:40] in a greater way Lord. We give you the
[22:42] praise and the honor and the glory in
[22:44] Jesus name. Amen. Praise God. You may be
[22:48] seated. We want to thank God again for
[22:50] this evening that he has given us yet
[22:52] another privilege to be in the house of
[22:56] God. And we want to thank God for the
[22:58] welcoming spirit. Praise God. Because we
[23:01] know that we are we have one heavenly
[23:03] father. And if you are feeding upon that
[23:06] word, hallelujah. You know we have that
[23:08] same spirit. And it's no different than
[23:10] wherever I I go. It's the same spirit of
[23:13] Christ Jesus across the nation and
[23:15] around the world. Even in other
[23:17] countries, you go into Amazon and those
[23:19] places where they don't even speak
[23:21] English is the same spirit. The first
[23:23] time I get there, the believer is
[23:26] saying, "Brother, you know, we would
[23:27] like you to come into our home and we
[23:29] can have fellowship. Although we don't
[23:31] understand each other language when we
[23:33] look in each other's face we just feel
[23:34] satisfied you know just to know just to
[23:38] know that we are children of God.
[23:40] Hallelujah. And you know through singing
[23:43] and through music you know it goes a far
[23:46] away because what happened you know some
[23:48] of the songs they sing it in their
[23:49] language and we sing it in our language
[23:51] in English and then we can communicate
[23:53] and say it's the same thing. So you know
[23:55] then it know it it creates an interest.
[23:58] So we want to thank God for a heavenly
[24:00] language. Praise God. And you know the
[24:03] one thing we come to recognize,
[24:05] hallelujah, in every language is the
[24:07] very same. Hallelujah. So we thank God
[24:10] that you know he's so gracious towards
[24:13] us that he can allow us to pass this way
[24:16] in fellowship. Hallelujah. And what is
[24:18] fellowship? Two fellas in a ship. Not
[24:21] just in a ship, but going the same
[24:23] direction. Because if you're not going
[24:25] the same direction, you know, somebody
[24:27] might be out of the ship. Praise God.
[24:29] But we ought to thank God. Hallelujah.
[24:32] That we can go in the same direction by
[24:35] the leadership of the Holy Spirit.
[24:38] Praise God. And I I really enjoying the
[24:40] time with the believers of like precious
[24:43] faith. And you know, there always
[24:45] memories that you could have in your
[24:47] mind in wherever you go by the grace of
[24:50] God. And we, you know, we want to thank
[24:52] God for these precious memories that we
[24:54] could have in the way of fellowship
[24:57] because when the hard time comes, you
[24:59] know, you can look back and reflect, you
[25:01] know, to how good it is and pleasant
[25:03] that brethren can dwell together in the
[25:06] unity of the Holy Spirit. And that is a
[25:08] great encouragement along the way of the
[25:11] ministry. Wherever you go, you know, you
[25:13] have the rough times and you have the
[25:16] good times. But we want to thank God
[25:18] that as human, we just passing through
[25:20] and we are pilgrims and we are
[25:22] strangers. But saints of God, we know
[25:24] that we are ambassadors for Christ.
[25:26] Amen. And you know it's a lot goes along
[25:28] with the whole thing. So we so thankful
[25:31] to be here by the grace of God. So we
[25:34] come to realize that the right
[25:36] atmosphere need to be created. It's so
[25:39] important for God's people to dwell in
[25:41] the right atmosphere. Amen. Hallelujah.
[25:44] Because it's the atmosphere, hallelujah,
[25:46] that causes, you know, life to come
[25:48] forth. And we come to realize that the
[25:50] hour that we living in, we need to
[25:52] create the right atmosphere because the
[25:55] world is full of many different kind of
[25:57] conditions. And we come to realize if
[26:00] you go into a hospital community,
[26:03] there's a certain kind of atmosphere.
[26:04] There are certain kind of feelings that
[26:06] when you go there, how you'd feel if you
[26:08] go into a marketplace is the very same.
[26:11] And where if you go in a rum shop or
[26:13] where they have alcohol, there's a
[26:14] certain kind of feeling. Hallelujah.
[26:16] Wherever you go, there's a certain
[26:18] atmosphere and there's a feeling or a
[26:20] characteristic that goes with it.
[26:22] Hallelujah. And where the churn of God
[26:24] is, there must be a certain kind of
[26:26] atmosphere. And when the right
[26:28] atmosphere is being created, the
[26:30] presence of God can come down.
[26:32] Hallelujah. And we come to realize that
[26:34] God cannot work in darkness. God cannot
[26:38] work in confusion. As we read here, in
[26:41] the beginning, God created a heaven and
[26:43] the earth. And the Bible says the earth
[26:45] was without form and it was void.
[26:48] And darkness was upon the face of the
[26:51] deep. Hallelujah. And the spirit of God
[26:54] moved upon the face of the waters. And
[26:57] God said, "Let there be light."
[27:01] Hallelujah. But it didn't stop there.
[27:03] And there was light because there is
[27:06] power in the word. Amen. Hallelujah.
[27:08] It's the creative power. And whatever
[27:10] God says it must come to pass. Amen.
[27:13] Hallelujah. And God saw the light that
[27:15] it was good. And God divided light from
[27:19] darkness. Amen. Allelujah. And God
[27:21] called the light day, darkness. He
[27:23] called night. And the evening and the
[27:25] morning were the first day. And after
[27:27] that, Hallelujah. If you go down into
[27:29] the book of Genesis and you continue to
[27:31] read, you're going to find that then God
[27:33] began his creation. Hallelujah. So, we
[27:36] come to realize that God needs the right
[27:39] atmosphere to work in. Amen. Hallelujah.
[27:42] And God cannot God is not contrary and
[27:44] God is not a God of confusion. But we
[27:47] find today why the Holy Spirit cannot
[27:49] move in churches and in lives today.
[27:51] People their lives are confused and
[27:53] there's darkness in their lives and God
[27:56] cannot move. Amen. Hallelujah. But when
[27:58] this light come, when this gospel comes,
[28:01] it brings new light. When it go, when
[28:04] this gospel comes, Hallelujah. when the
[28:06] light is shining forth, everything that
[28:08] is in darkness, it will have to come to
[28:11] light. Amen. Hallelujah. So, no matter
[28:13] what is done in darkness, it will be
[28:15] manifested. Amen. We come to realize
[28:17] that if there is no light in the
[28:20] building and you know we're outside in
[28:22] some kind of building and there's
[28:23] darkness there and you know just a
[28:26] flicker of a light shines and you know
[28:28] that there's a a venomous snake in that
[28:31] corner there while the place is dark you
[28:33] may not know but when the light flicker
[28:35] and you see in this particular corner
[28:38] you have a a venomous snake there you
[28:40] wouldn't want to go there anymore
[28:41] because your mind is telling you that
[28:43] there's danger there. So that is why the
[28:46] more the brighter the light shines the
[28:48] more you can see danger. Amen.
[28:50] Hallelujah. But the Bible tells us that
[28:53] you know you have people they love the
[28:56] darkness rather than light. Already they
[28:59] know that when you're in darkness
[29:01] anything can happen to you. Hallelujah.
[29:03] But when you're in the light you can see
[29:05] the grace of God and you can move in the
[29:08] grace and in the mercies of God.
[29:09] Hallelujah. And things can happen in
[29:11] your life. But is what spirit people are
[29:13] being possessed by. If you're possessed
[29:15] with the right spirit, you would flee
[29:17] from darkness. If you're possessed with
[29:19] the right spirit, saints of God, you
[29:21] want to be in the light of God. Because
[29:24] in the light of God, hallelujah, your
[29:26] faith can rise in the word of God and
[29:29] you can have healing. You can have
[29:30] victories in your life. Hallelujah. We
[29:33] wanted to know why some people are so
[29:35] tossed about is because they don't want
[29:37] to dwell in the right atmosphere.
[29:40] They don't want God to come and move in
[29:42] their life. There too many earthly or
[29:44] carnal things that he want to hold on
[29:46] to. Hallelujah. But God want us to be
[29:48] set free. The word says whom the son set
[29:51] free is free indeed. Hallelujah. And
[29:54] when you are free is to serve God is to
[29:57] worship him in spirit and in truth.
[30:00] Hallelujah. When the spirit of God comes
[30:02] in the right atmosphere, you'll come to
[30:04] respect and understand headship.
[30:06] Hallelujah. And headship for God's
[30:08] people is not a bondage but headship is
[30:11] a privilege. Hallelujah. But the world
[30:14] today they don't want headship.
[30:16] Hallelujah. You have many relationships
[30:18] today and you know there are many
[30:20] marriages and in those marriages now the
[30:22] women of the world today they don't want
[30:25] their names to be changed. They want to
[30:27] hold on to their same old title and you
[30:29] know they just want to have an addition.
[30:31] But saints of God the word teaches us
[30:33] that we have to die out to ourself.
[30:35] Hallelujah. And when only when you die
[30:37] out yourself and take on his nature,
[30:40] then you can have a true relationship
[30:43] with God. Hallelujah. As long as we have
[30:46] self in us, the right atmosphere can
[30:48] never be created. Amen. Hallelujah. And
[30:51] this word of God is teaching us,
[30:53] hallelujah, all about what it takes
[30:55] because faith cometh by hearing and
[30:57] hearing by the word. In a message gyrus
[31:00] and divine healing paragraph 35 the
[31:02] prophet of God said and we ought to get
[31:05] ourselves in the kind of an
[31:07] atmosphere create. He says each one of
[31:11] you is a creator. He says did you know
[31:14] that each one of you people that's born
[31:18] again is a creator. It's only when
[31:20] you're born again then you are a
[31:22] creator. And we must create an
[31:25] atmosphere. As I said the other night,
[31:28] God has given us the ability to be
[31:30] creators to create the right atmosphere.
[31:33] So we have to be careful as believers
[31:36] what kind of atmosphere we are creating.
[31:38] That is why we need to be harnessed by
[31:41] the Holy Spirit in the word of God that
[31:43] every time we open our mouth to speak,
[31:45] hallelujah, it must be glorifying unto
[31:48] God. Hallelujah. This is not bittersweet
[31:51] that one time you speak well and another
[31:53] time you speak bad. The nature inside of
[31:55] you must be the nature of Christ Jesus.
[31:58] And every time Christ Jesus opened his
[32:00] mouth to speak hallelujah. It was words
[32:02] of wisdom. It was words that is being
[32:05] directed by God because no time in the
[32:08] life of our Lord and Savior when he was
[32:10] here on earth ever spoke anything that
[32:12] was out from the will of God.
[32:14] Hallelujah. Everything that he said
[32:16] hallelujah is what God had told him. He
[32:18] was being led by the spirit. And today,
[32:21] every son and daughter must be led by
[32:24] the Holy Spirit. We must not be led by
[32:27] our own feelings and by our own
[32:29] ambition. Hallelujah. Or some friend or
[32:31] some organization, but we must be led of
[32:33] God. Hallelujah. And the time and season
[32:36] that we living in. Praise God. We don't
[32:38] believe in collective
[32:40] revelation. And that is what is taking
[32:42] place today. You find a bunch of
[32:44] ministers getting together and people
[32:45] coming together and because they agree
[32:47] on certain thing, well, they take it for
[32:49] gospel. But if it don't line up with a
[32:51] message of the hour, you got to kick it
[32:53] out. Hallelujah. Because it's going to
[32:55] bring confusion. That is darkness to
[32:57] begin with. But when the light comes,
[32:59] Hallelujah. I don't have my own thought.
[33:01] Brother Brooks or any one of the
[33:02] minister don't have their own thought,
[33:04] but we have the mind of Christ.
[33:06] Hallelujah. That is why we can go around
[33:08] the world and recognize praise God the
[33:11] spirit of Christ Jesus. Hallelujah. Say
[33:13] if the same spirit that raised Christ
[33:14] from the dead dwell in you is going to
[33:16] quicken your mortal body. Hallelujah. So
[33:19] when we are being quickened by the word
[33:21] of God, we can say the same thing and we
[33:24] can come and we can have fellowship
[33:26] under the same kindred spirit that God
[33:29] has provided. Hallelujah. Isn't it
[33:31] wonderful that you can come to realize
[33:33] that we living in a time and a season
[33:35] that the word of God is alive in the in
[33:38] the life of his people? Amen.
[33:40] Hallelujah. That in this hour that we
[33:42] living in, the works that Jesus Christ
[33:44] did, he says the works that I do shall
[33:47] he do and greater than these.
[33:49] Hallelujah. Why? Because of the
[33:50] atmosphere that is being created, God
[33:52] have many sons and daughters today.
[33:54] Hallelujah. Which were born by the word
[33:57] of God. Hallelujah. Not by the will of
[33:59] man or the will of flesh. Praise God.
[34:02] But by the spoken word in this hour that
[34:04] have called us out from denomination,
[34:06] call us out from darkness and every
[34:08] corner that we were dwelling in.
[34:10] Hallelujah. That is why whatever we say,
[34:12] it must be pleasing to God. Hallelujah.
[34:15] Many people say, "Well, I'm not
[34:16] concerned what I say and I don't care
[34:18] about anybody." But if you're a son or
[34:20] you daughter of God, you have to be
[34:22] careful in what you say. Hallelujah.
[34:24] Because the word even tells us offense
[34:26] will come but woe to the one that bring
[34:28] it. Amen. Hallelujah. But if offense
[34:31] comes and is through the word and people
[34:33] reject the word, well that's the
[34:35] different kind of offense. Hallelujah.
[34:37] But not when we are contrary and we say
[34:39] things that is not likened. Hallelujah.
[34:41] To the word of God. Hallelujah. In a
[34:44] message identification paragraph 40.
[34:46] Jesus gave us example of what we ought
[34:49] to be looking at when he reflected his
[34:53] life to us through the word. What we
[34:56] should see when he look when we look
[34:59] into God's mirror we should see
[35:01] ourselves identify with him. That is a
[35:04] perfect example. Hallelujah. When we
[35:07] look into the mirror of God's word, we
[35:09] must see ourselves identify with him.
[35:11] Hallelujah. Which one of you ever go in
[35:13] front of the mirror and when you look in
[35:15] a mirror you see something else other
[35:17] than yourself? That will to make you
[35:19] jump. That will ought to make you to
[35:21] understand what is really happening
[35:22] here. Hallelujah. And whatever you are,
[35:25] whatever your features are, when you go
[35:27] in front of the mirror, that is what
[35:29] you're going to see. Amen. Hallelujah.
[35:31] So the mirror don't lie. We know they
[35:33] have all kind of mirrors today with all
[35:34] kind of different whatchimens or
[35:37] whatever you call it. And they can show
[35:39] your face if it's you can make your face
[35:41] look longer and wider and all kind of
[35:43] different things. But I'm talking about
[35:45] a real genuine mirror. Hallelujah.
[35:48] Praise God. A real genuine mirror. When
[35:50] you go in front of it, it gives you an
[35:52] exact Hallelujah portrait or picture of
[35:56] your very self. And that the greatest
[35:58] mirror, the best mirror that we could
[36:00] think of is the very mirror of God's
[36:02] word. Amen. Because God don't lie. His
[36:05] word cannot lie. Hallelujah. God is
[36:08] perfect and he is the same yesterday,
[36:10] today and forever. So we find we need to
[36:13] come before the mirror of God's word and
[36:15] then we can examine ourselves.
[36:18] Hallelujah. We're not to examine
[36:20] ourselves. Hallelujah. By our standard
[36:23] by another brother, another sister and
[36:25] most of the time as human when we get
[36:27] into a certain way we are judging others
[36:30] by our standard by how we feel and what
[36:32] we think. It should not be that way.
[36:35] Amen. Hallelujah. We should not judge no
[36:37] one by no other standard but the word
[36:39] way. Hallelujah. We should not even try
[36:41] to judge one another. But we should
[36:43] judge ourselves by the word of God. And
[36:46] if we judge ourselves, we shall not be
[36:48] judged. Hallelujah. So, we got to
[36:50] recognize the time and the season that
[36:52] we living in. Saints of God, our lives
[36:55] ought to be worthy of this gospel.
[36:57] Praise God. Continuing here now that we
[37:00] find out that we go along to life that
[37:04] our character molds the image that we
[37:07] are. Our character molds the image that
[37:09] we are and each one knows that you as
[37:13] you live so is your character. Your
[37:16] character it molds you to what you are.
[37:18] He says now you have seen people that
[37:21] you just love to be around. Isn't that
[37:23] so? Yet they might not exactly be in
[37:26] your bracket or society. And again, they
[37:30] might be of different race, the color or
[37:32] brown or yellow, but there's something
[37:35] about that character that you just love
[37:38] to be in their presence because each
[37:40] person is a little dynamo of their own
[37:43] and you put out an atmosphere. So each
[37:46] and every one of us put out an
[37:48] atmosphere. Hallelujah. We may not all
[37:51] see eye to eye but sometime we love to
[37:53] be around certain individual certain
[37:55] person certain characteristic because we
[37:58] know it can always be a blessing. You
[38:00] know sometimes I put it this way you
[38:02] know you might see some brother might
[38:05] call you and say oh brother you know I
[38:07] want to come by you today but you know
[38:09] for that particular day you may not have
[38:11] anything you know particular to do but
[38:15] because you know every time a certain
[38:17] person come around the atmosphere that
[38:18] they create is so confusing and so dumb
[38:21] spirited and even if you don't have
[38:23] anything to do you might try to find
[38:25] something to do and try to find yourself
[38:27] occupy that when he comes you busy.
[38:30] Hallelujah. And on the other hand, you
[38:32] may have a whole lot of things to do.
[38:34] And when a certain brother call say Brad
[38:36] you know I want to come by you today and
[38:38] you say okay you can come you know and
[38:40] because you know what kind of atmosphere
[38:42] is being created and that is the kind of
[38:44] atmosphere that we must create a one
[38:47] that is welcoming. Hallelujah. That we
[38:49] could come and we can feel the presence
[38:51] of God that when we come and fellowship
[38:54] with each other when we leave each other
[38:56] presence we must feel blessed. Amen. How
[38:58] many you want to feel like that and we
[39:00] should feel like that that nor we come
[39:03] together we leave our spirit aggravated
[39:05] and you know it's a whole waste of time
[39:07] and these kind of thing because as human
[39:10] whatever we put whatever sacrifice we
[39:12] make we want to know that we get the
[39:14] best out of the whole thing. Hallelujah.
[39:16] And so is God. The best Hallelujah
[39:19] businessman that you could find is God.
[39:21] Yes. Hallelujah. Praise God. the the man
[39:24] on the outside or the businesses today,
[39:26] they have profit and loss. But in the
[39:29] kingdom of God, there no profit and
[39:30] loss. God never lose. Hallelujah. And
[39:33] there is nothing for him to loss. And a
[39:35] proud of God said God did never God did
[39:37] not save us to lose us. Hallelujah. But
[39:41] when God saves you, hallelujah, you are
[39:43] saved. Amen. Hallelujah. But with us, we
[39:45] do business and we after the end of the
[39:48] year or how much we want to do, we do a
[39:50] profit and loss account to find how we
[39:53] are getting through in business. But
[39:54] saints of God, God knows everything.
[39:56] Hallelujah. And we want to thank God
[39:58] that we have such a great accountant.
[40:01] Hallelujah. That can give account for
[40:03] everything. Should not we give account
[40:05] for the life that God has given that we
[40:07] can live wherever we go and whatever we
[40:09] say. Hallelujah. is not just in our
[40:12] homes and in our community, but wherever
[40:14] we go. You have a lot of people they
[40:16] live contrary lives when they're at home
[40:19] and and when they go out, you know, they
[40:20] try to be a saint. But you see, the
[40:22] spirit of God goes with you everywhere.
[40:24] Hallelujah. And we cannot hide. You
[40:26] know, the scripture tells us that our
[40:28] hiding place becomes God's pavilion.
[40:31] Could you imagine that? Hallelujah. that
[40:32] you are sitting in a pav, somebody is
[40:34] trying to hide in the open field and you
[40:36] in the pavilion and we think that we are
[40:39] so smart that we could hide from God. We
[40:41] cannot hide saints of God. That is why
[40:43] he says that our our hiding place is his
[40:46] pavilion. So what could we do? The only
[40:49] thing we can do is to surrender our life
[40:52] to him. Hallelujah. Praise God. So we
[40:56] come to realize that we need to create
[40:58] the right atmosphere because each person
[41:00] is a little dynamo of their own and you
[41:03] put out an atmosphere. You see we were
[41:05] being created in the image and in the
[41:07] likeness of God before the foundation of
[41:10] the world. Hallelujah. And in Genesis
[41:12] 1:26 tells us, "And God says, let us
[41:14] make man in our own image, after our
[41:17] likeness, and let them have dominion
[41:21] over the fish of the sea, and over the
[41:23] fowl of the air, over the cattle, and
[41:25] over all the earth, and over every
[41:28] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[41:30] earth." Amen. So God created man in his
[41:34] own image, in the image of God created
[41:36] he him. Male and female created he them.
[41:41] Hallelujah. And God blessed them. And
[41:44] God said unto them, "Be fruitful,
[41:46] multiply, and replenish the earth, and
[41:49] subdue it, and have dominion over the
[41:52] fish of the sea, over the fowl of the
[41:55] air, over every living thing that moveth
[41:58] upon the earth." You see, God give us
[42:00] our dominion. He gave us the authority
[42:02] over everything. But man in his fallen
[42:05] nature, he broke that entirety with God.
[42:09] Hallelujah. And that is why sin came
[42:11] upon the face of the earth. But we want
[42:13] to thank God with all of that, saints of
[42:16] God, there's a message of restoration.
[42:18] Amen. Praise God that everything that
[42:20] has been broken. Praise God. It came
[42:22] right back through Lord and Savior Jesus
[42:25] Christ by shedding his blood on the
[42:27] cross of Calvary by bringing redemption.
[42:29] Praise God. That a bride can come back
[42:31] once again. Amen. Praise God. So we come
[42:34] to recognize that God himself said, "Let
[42:37] us make man in our own image." So we if
[42:40] we are in the image of God then we are
[42:42] miniature creator then we are little
[42:44] dynamos. So we got to be careful of what
[42:47] kind of atmosphere we create because we
[42:49] can stir up a trouble. Hallelujah. You
[42:52] know human being could stir up a real
[42:53] trouble and we can be peaceful when we
[42:56] want to but let us possess the right
[42:58] spirit. And when we possess the right
[43:00] spirit you will not be led by your
[43:02] emotion and led by your feeling but
[43:04] you're going to be led by the word of
[43:06] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Praise
[43:09] God. We come to realize that your faith
[43:10] will make you believe things that your
[43:12] mind knows nothing about. How many you
[43:15] believe that your faith will make you
[43:17] believe things that your mind know
[43:19] nothing about. Because it's not about
[43:21] what we think and it's not about what we
[43:23] feel, but it's what the word of God
[43:25] says. All things are possible to them
[43:27] that believe it. Sometime you pray and
[43:29] you ask God for leadership and he's
[43:31] leading you a certain line and the
[43:32] direction and you don't have any lead at
[43:35] where you're going but because you're an
[43:36] obedient child you following the
[43:38] leadership of the Holy Spirit.
[43:40] Hallelujah. And sometimes battles may
[43:42] want to come in mind but where you going
[43:43] you know what you're really doing look
[43:45] the line you taking and the whole odds
[43:47] may be against you. Praise God. your
[43:49] closest buddy, your closest friend or
[43:50] somebody may be against you and say what
[43:52] you're really doing but you have no
[43:54] explanation but still nobody cannot take
[43:56] it away from you or tell you that you're
[43:58] doing wrong because something inside of
[44:00] you that is leading you to do the right
[44:02] thing. Amen. Hallelujah. There are many
[44:04] things in our life that we cannot
[44:06] explain. You cannot explain God but you
[44:09] have to believe God. Hallelujah. And you
[44:11] have to go the way that God will have
[44:12] you to. The greatest pull that you can
[44:15] have is when God is pulling and tugging
[44:17] at you. Yes. Hallelujah. Why? Because
[44:20] there's no force like him. Hallelujah.
[44:22] So we thank God. Uh the Bible tell us in
[44:25] 2 Corinthians chapter 10
[44:29] 3-6. For though we walk in the flesh, we
[44:33] do not war after the flesh. For the
[44:37] weapons of our warfare are not carnal,
[44:41] but mighty through God to the pulling
[44:43] down of
[44:44] strongholds, casting down
[44:47] imaginations and every high thing that
[44:50] exalt itself against the knowledge of
[44:52] God and bringing into captivity every
[44:54] thought to the obedience of Christ.
[44:58] Isn't that wonderful? Amen. and having
[45:00] in a readiness to revenge all
[45:04] disobedience when your obedience is
[45:06] fulfilled. Hallelujah. We must re having
[45:10] in readiness to revenge all disobedience
[45:13] when your obedience is fulfilled. The
[45:15] only way our obedience can be fulfilled
[45:17] is when we can surrender to the word of
[45:20] God. When we can surrender, hallelujah,
[45:22] to the life that God has provided for
[45:25] us. Hallelujah. Then we see the glory
[45:27] and the grace of God working in our
[45:29] life, when the right atmosphere can be
[45:31] created. Hallelujah. And a message is a
[45:33] life worthy of your gospel. Paragraph
[45:36] 151. And did you know you are a little
[45:39] creator yourself? You know that
[45:43] certainly you seen people that you just
[45:45] love to be around. You don't know why.
[45:48] Just that loving type of person. Have
[45:51] you seen that? Just as kind there. You
[45:54] like to be around them. That's he said
[45:56] they create that atmosphere by the life
[45:59] they live, the way they talk, their
[46:01] conversation. And that happens today.
[46:04] The way how people talk, the way how
[46:06] they conduct themselves. Hallelujah.
[46:08] It's soothing. Hallelujah. It's a it's
[46:10] life. And it can bring you in a certain
[46:13] condition. That is why we have to think.
[46:16] Hallelujah. Before we can say something,
[46:19] we have to have the right mind.
[46:20] Hallelujah. Think of our thoughts. Think
[46:22] of something of our action and what we
[46:24] do and what we talk about. It creates an
[46:27] atmosphere. Amen. Hallelujah. I remember
[46:30] going into the jungles, you know,
[46:32] through the Amazon and different places.
[46:34] People start to talk of different spooky
[46:36] things about zombies and all kind of
[46:38] things. And when they start talking, it
[46:40] create a certain kind of atmosphere. And
[46:42] you have fellas, they may think that
[46:44] they're brave, but when the nightfall
[46:46] comes in, they don't even want to come
[46:48] out from their camp to go where they
[46:50] were staying all the time because of
[46:52] fear. Why? Because of the atmosphere
[46:54] that has been created. Amen. Hallelujah.
[46:57] If you know it's it's of such that words
[47:00] have power, words have life. And you
[47:02] know many time we don't understand but
[47:05] now coming into the message we can see
[47:07] why when men speak something why we have
[47:09] to be careful of what we say.
[47:12] Hallelujah. That's why in Sunday school
[47:14] days, we used to say, "Be careful little
[47:16] eyes what you see. Be careful little eye
[47:18] ears what you hear. Be careful little
[47:20] mouth what you speak. Be careful little
[47:22] feet where you go." And saints of God,
[47:24] it might seem to be just a song to the
[47:26] Sunday school. But you know, we are all
[47:29] children of God and we all need to
[47:31] continue in the word of God. We always
[47:33] have to be careful with our life. God
[47:35] didn't call us to be careless.
[47:37] Hallelujah. What God called us to be
[47:39] careful that whatever we do, we have to
[47:41] give account. Amen. Hallelujah. I think
[47:44] it's somewhere in the book of Acts
[47:45] chapter 10. It says, you know, God
[47:48] whatever we do, it comes up as a
[47:50] memorial before God because when you
[47:52] look at Cornelius, the Bible tells us,
[47:55] you know, that, you know, the it was
[47:58] told to him that he was praying to God
[48:01] and he was faithful. He he prayed to
[48:03] God, give arms. I think he prayed to
[48:05] God. He give arms and he pray to God
[48:07] always. Hallelujah. And that came up as
[48:09] a memorial before God. So when Peter was
[48:12] having that vision, hallelujah, it was
[48:15] uh quicken onto him that he should come
[48:17] and visit Cornelius. So whatever we do,
[48:20] it comes up as a memorial before God.
[48:22] You see God don't forget. Amen.
[48:24] Hallelujah. Whatever we do, it comes up
[48:26] as a memorial before God. That is why we
[48:29] got to be careful of this life that we
[48:31] live because many time we don't know who
[48:33] looking at us. Hallelujah. We might
[48:35] think that we may be far away from home
[48:37] in a different state or in a different
[48:39] land. But God is looking over us.
[48:43] Hallelujah. Praise God. Some say when
[48:45] you are in Rome, you have to do as the
[48:47] Romans do. Well, saints of God, we are
[48:49] not Romans. Hallelujah. We are sons and
[48:51] daughters of God. Hallelujah. We came
[48:53] from God and we going back to him. We
[48:55] got to realize that we are just pilgrim
[48:57] and we are stranger. We are passing
[48:59] through. But we are we are son of a
[49:01] king. Hallelujah. son of not a king but
[49:04] son of the king. So we got to be careful
[49:06] the way we conduct ourselves and many of
[49:09] us we know the little story of that
[49:11] slave hallelujah who was in captivity
[49:13] and the way how he conducted himself it
[49:16] was different from all the others and
[49:18] the way we conducting ourselves today it
[49:20] has to be different than all others.
[49:23] Amen. Hallelujah. You see we are not
[49:25] making comparison with our life but our
[49:27] life must be worthy of this gospel.
[49:30] Hallelujah. And we truly want to thank
[49:31] God for that. So even the thoughts that
[49:34] we have, we must think of the very
[49:36] thoughts that we have. It must be plain.
[49:38] It must be pure. It must come from the
[49:40] mind of God. Hallelujah. Whatever we
[49:42] think, it must not come from our
[49:44] reaction. What somebody done to us and
[49:46] how we will react. Hallelujah. Because a
[49:48] power of God clearly tells us is not the
[49:52] person attitude towards you, but is your
[49:54] attitude towards the person. So it
[49:57] doesn't matter what somebody done to
[49:58] you, saints of God, it's your attitude.
[50:01] Hallelujah. In return, Amen. Hallelujah.
[50:03] Because Christ Jesus, he was a perfect
[50:06] example. When they crucify him, he says,
[50:08] "Father, forgive them for they know not
[50:10] what they do." And look what they did to
[50:12] him. Even Steven was an example.
[50:14] Hallelujah. in what was happening. How
[50:16] much more sons and daughters of God in
[50:18] this time and in this season having the
[50:20] fullness of the word of God having the
[50:22] plum line for the hour to lead us and to
[50:25] guide us into every truth. Amen. Amen.
[50:27] Hallelujah. What a time, what a season
[50:29] that we living in. Ephesians chapter 2
[50:32] reading verses 2 and three tells us
[50:34] wherein in time
[50:35] past we walk according to the course of
[50:38] this world according to the prince of
[50:40] the power of the air the spirit that now
[50:43] workketh in the children of
[50:46] disobedience among whom also we all had
[50:49] our conversation in time past in the
[50:51] lust of our flesh fulfilling desires of
[50:54] the flesh and of the mind and were by
[50:57] nature the children of rot even as
[51:00] others You see where we were? But we
[51:02] want to thank God for his grace towards
[51:05] us that has brought us in that we could
[51:07] walk hallelujah as children of the light
[51:09] in this hour. Because when God said let
[51:12] there be light, there was light and in
[51:14] him there is no darkness. In him there
[51:17] is no confusion and we see that God
[51:19] cannot work in confusion. So if God who
[51:21] is God cannot work in confusion, can we
[51:24] work in confusion? Can we work in doubt
[51:26] when our minds are scrupled up and in
[51:29] all kind of condition? We must have a
[51:31] clear thought. Hallelujah. We must have
[51:33] the clear light of this gospel in where
[51:35] we are standing. Hallelujah. Because God
[51:38] want us to live the way that he would
[51:40] have us to live. In Philippians 1 27
[51:43] tells us, "Only let your conversation be
[51:48] as becometh the gospel of Christ." Amen.
[51:50] that whether I come and see you or else
[51:53] be absent, I may hear of your affair,
[51:56] that he stand fast in one spirit with
[51:59] one mind, striving together for the
[52:02] faith of the gospel. This was the letter
[52:05] of Paul. Hallelujah. Only let your
[52:08] conversation be as it becometh the
[52:10] gospel of Christ. So we have to think
[52:13] about our thoughts, what we saying. We
[52:15] must weigh our words. We must not speak
[52:17] vain words. Hallelujah. And we find
[52:20] today that people they can live this
[52:22] side and they can live that side. But
[52:23] God, hallelujah, called us to be doves
[52:25] in this hour. He didn't call us to be a
[52:27] dove and a crow. Amen. Hallelujah. A
[52:30] crow can come and he can eat on a grain
[52:32] and he can go and he can eat on the dead
[52:34] carrier. Hallelujah. But a dove, saints
[52:36] of God, he only have one position. If he
[52:39] try to eat anything unclean, it will
[52:41] cause debt. Hallelujah. And debt, what
[52:43] debt does? It separates you from God.
[52:46] Hallelujah. So we know where we ought to
[52:48] feed upon by the grace and the mercies
[52:51] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. And
[52:53] to back up that scripture, first Peter
[52:55] chapter 1 verse1 15 tells us, "But as
[52:59] but as he which had called you is
[53:02] holy, so be holy in all manner of
[53:06] conversation
[53:07] because it is written be holy for I am
[53:11] holy." So saints of God throughout the
[53:13] scripture you can see the grace of God
[53:16] to his people in this hour that we
[53:18] living in. Hallelujah. And this is not
[53:21] how long you're around church or or if
[53:23] you're being raised in the message.
[53:24] Saints of God, one of the greatest
[53:27] hindrance that people are going through
[53:29] today is those that are being raised in
[53:31] the message. They feel that they are
[53:32] superior and they feel this and that. I
[53:34] was being raised in a message from the
[53:36] age 10 years old when I got baptized.
[53:38] But that didn't make me a believer.
[53:40] Hallelujah. is when you receive the Holy
[53:42] Ghost. And I come to realize, you know,
[53:45] it's lots of peer pressure around the
[53:47] realm of the message realm and these
[53:49] kind of things. And you know, you want
[53:51] to be a good boy to your parents and
[53:53] among the believers. And when you go
[53:54] outside, you want to be a you want to be
[53:57] just like them on the outside and even
[53:59] better. Hallelujah. And the devil will
[54:01] give you a special anointing because he
[54:03] wants to destroy your life. Amen.
[54:05] Hallelujah. And when we come to
[54:07] recognize what is happening and is the
[54:09] most hypocritical life you could live
[54:11] and is the worst life that you could
[54:12] ever think of when you don't make a full
[54:15] clearcut decision who you are and what
[54:18] you want to be because you want to
[54:20] please both sides and you're not even
[54:21] pleasing yourself and you're being
[54:22] caught in the middle of the whole thing
[54:25] and it's a miserable condition to be in.
[54:27] That is why we need to train up our
[54:29] children in the fear of the Lord in the
[54:31] way they ought to grow that when they of
[54:32] age they will not depart from the word
[54:34] of truth. Amen. Hallelujah. And only
[54:36] when you receive the Holy Ghost in your
[54:38] life, then you can live the way that God
[54:40] would have you to live. So saints of
[54:42] God, we want to thank God. It have its
[54:44] good and it have its bad. But there's
[54:46] nothing to boast about how we are being
[54:48] raised up, but make sure that we receive
[54:49] the Holy Ghost. We can born and die in
[54:52] the church. And if we don't receive the
[54:54] Holy Ghost, we are lost. Hallelujah. And
[54:57] that is nothing else but the truth.
[54:59] Praise his wonderful name. The power of
[55:01] God says in a message, do you now
[55:03] believe? Paragraph 33 says, "Now let me
[55:06] tell you something. Each
[55:08] man, although each man that's born again
[55:12] with the spirit of God in him is a
[55:15] miniature creator." He says, "Now that
[55:18] might shake you a little, but that's the
[55:20] truth." Hallelujah. We are in the image
[55:23] of God. God is a creator. Amen. That's
[55:27] the reason that you can believe that God
[55:30] could heal a person because God is in
[55:34] you. Amen. And God made this world. He
[55:37] just spoke it and his word became
[55:40] material. The very ground that you
[55:42] settling on is the word of God made
[55:45] manifest. Everything that is here,
[55:48] hallelujah, the very ground and places
[55:50] that we go is the very word of God being
[55:52] made manifest. Amen. If he didn't, where
[55:56] do he get it? See, he just spoke it and
[55:59] it turned into existence.
[56:03] He believed in his own word. And if a
[56:06] man is born of the spirit of God, he's
[56:09] an offspring of God. Amen. If you're
[56:12] born of God, you're an offspring of God.
[56:14] And if you're offspring of God, you have
[56:16] the very attributes of God. And if God
[56:18] is a creator, you also can create.
[56:21] Praise his wonderful name. And that part
[56:23] of God is in him. And he believes every
[56:26] word that God says will materialize.
[56:29] Amen. Hallelujah. See, and so that makes
[56:33] him part of God. The Holy Spirit in the
[56:37] man makes him a part of God. What make
[56:40] him a part of God? Is the Holy Spirit in
[56:43] him. So if we don't have the Holy
[56:45] Spirit, tell me, are we part of God?
[56:48] We just religious. Yeah, we just have an
[56:51] intellectual conception. But to be part
[56:53] of God, you need to have the true
[56:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost in your life.
[56:58] Hallelujah. Praise God. We don't want
[57:00] the anointing on upon body and upon a
[57:02] spirit. But we want the full anointing
[57:04] of God, a full baptism down into the
[57:07] depths of our soul that will make us
[57:09] live. Hallelujah. 1 Corinthians chapter
[57:11] 6 20. For we are bought with a price.
[57:17] Therefore, glorify God in your body and
[57:20] in your spirit which are God's. We are
[57:22] all bought with a price.
[57:25] Hallelujah. And there is no limit to the
[57:28] price. Amen. Because one soul is worth
[57:31] not 10,000 world but more than 10,000
[57:34] world. Amen. So what price could you
[57:37] pay? We are priceless.
[57:40] Hallelujah. And we want to thank God.
[57:42] Hallelujah. that you know we come to
[57:44] realize that nothing can separate us
[57:47] from the love of God. Hallelujah. God is
[57:50] so good to his people that we come to
[57:53] recognize in this hour the word says
[57:55] love not the world or the things of the
[57:57] world because if you love the world and
[57:59] the things of the world the love of God
[58:01] is not inside of you. Hallelujah. So
[58:03] with all of this we got to come to
[58:05] realize saints of God we must have a
[58:07] love for God. If his nature is inside of
[58:10] you you will love God. Amen. Hallelujah.
[58:14] If you don't have to beg somebody to
[58:15] love somebody if love is in their heart.
[58:18] If you love God, nobody don't have to
[58:20] beg you to serve God or pat you on the
[58:22] back and try to woo you to come to
[58:24] service because the word said, "Forsake
[58:26] not the assembling of self." As a man of
[58:28] some as we see the day approaching, we
[58:30] ought to be in the house of God. And
[58:32] we're going to make the very effort.
[58:33] Hallelujah. To be in the house of God
[58:35] and stay with the word for the hour that
[58:38] we are living in. Hallelujah. So we come
[58:41] to realize do you realize the atmosphere
[58:42] that you dwell in you can influence
[58:44] somebody else. Yes sir. Our life can
[58:47] influence somebody. Do you know how many
[58:49] people might be looking at you? You slip
[58:52] up and do something wrong. Then you know
[58:55] the whole world will know something
[58:57] about you. So we got to be careful
[58:59] because if we create the wrong
[59:01] atmosphere we can lead people astray.
[59:04] Hallelujah. We can be a bad influence if
[59:06] we don't live the word of God. God don't
[59:08] want us to be professors. Hallelujah.
[59:10] But he want us to be possessors. But
[59:12] today you find a lot of people
[59:14] professing and professing and they don't
[59:16] possess anything. Hallelujah. You know
[59:19] it's like little boys, you know, used to
[59:20] go to school and their fellas come to
[59:22] school and they want to tell you how
[59:24] much money they have. So what they would
[59:26] do, they will take the daily newspaper
[59:27] and they will take it and they will cut
[59:29] it up like the size of the money and
[59:30] they're going to get a few dollars and
[59:32] back it this side and that side and fold
[59:34] it and put in their pocket. When they
[59:36] pull it out, you think they have a lot
[59:37] of money. Hallelujah. But when the time
[59:39] come for you to really buy something,
[59:41] they always broken. Hallelujah. But they
[59:43] always have to. They always the pockets
[59:45] are looking filled. And that is what is
[59:47] happening today. People talk too much.
[59:49] Hallelujah. But they live too little.
[59:51] Amen. Hallelujah. Is not speaking the
[59:54] gospel, but Paul is talking about about
[59:56] living the gospel. To me to live is
[59:59] Christ. Hallelujah. And we are being
[1:00:01] living epistle. The word says read and
[1:00:03] seen of all men. Hallelujah. So wherever
[1:00:07] we go, saints of God, we must be the
[1:00:09] very same that God would have us to be.
[1:00:11] As I said this morning, we is not
[1:00:13] putting on a show. Hallelujah. But it's
[1:00:16] to live the way that God would have you
[1:00:17] to live. Our God is not in show
[1:00:19] business. Hallelujah. God is not in
[1:00:21] theatricalism to put on all kind of show
[1:00:24] to make people feel good. Hallelujah.
[1:00:26] But God is God. He's a perfect God. And
[1:00:28] he tells us this is the way. Walk in it.
[1:00:30] Amen. Hallelujah. What more plainly do
[1:00:34] we want to have than what God has
[1:00:36] already provided and given to us? Men
[1:00:39] want to do something and feel that we
[1:00:41] can do things you know to make ourselves
[1:00:43] better but is what he had done for us.
[1:00:45] We come to realize is an unconditional
[1:00:48] faith covenant. Hallelujah. That God has
[1:00:50] provided is not what we can do but what
[1:00:53] God has already done. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:00:57] The job has already done. So do you
[1:00:59] realize the atmosphere that you dwell
[1:01:00] in? If you can influence somebody else,
[1:01:03] what makes people act the way they do is
[1:01:05] because what makes the
[1:01:07] drunk likes to be with
[1:01:11] drunks as it says my my mother used to
[1:01:14] say of old proverb and I think is
[1:01:15] southern here to birds of a feather
[1:01:18] flock together because they have things
[1:01:20] in common. So when you see people having
[1:01:22] things in common is something is
[1:01:24] attracting them. Hallelujah. So the true
[1:01:27] of God will want to be with children of
[1:01:29] God having real true fellowship.
[1:01:31] Hallelujah. And we want to be the place
[1:01:33] that God would have us to be.
[1:01:36] Hallelujah. It says in divine love. Now
[1:01:39] we want to talk on facts. Now the reason
[1:01:41] is is because of the atmosphere that the
[1:01:45] individual himself or herself creates.
[1:01:48] Because you are a miniature creator.
[1:01:51] Because you are sons and daughters of
[1:01:52] God. That is why you are miniature
[1:01:54] creators. No matter, listen to this, no
[1:01:56] matter how far you stooped in
[1:01:59] sin, you're still sons and daughters of
[1:02:03] God because you're fallen, hallelujah,
[1:02:07] degenerated in your soul and mind. But
[1:02:10] God is your creator. And in your fallen
[1:02:14] estate, you are
[1:02:16] lost,
[1:02:17] undone, certain of God. Hallelujah. Or
[1:02:21] undone rather. creation of God dominated
[1:02:25] by the devil. That's right. But still,
[1:02:27] you are sons and daughters of God. With
[1:02:31] all of that, with all we have sinned and
[1:02:33] fall and come short, hallelujah, of the
[1:02:36] glory of God, we still are sons and
[1:02:38] daughters of God. He's not willing that
[1:02:41] any of you should perish, but all might
[1:02:44] come to repentance. See, and he's done
[1:02:47] everything that lays possible. For the
[1:02:51] only God himself could do this to give
[1:02:54] the opportunities to the creatures of
[1:02:57] his to accept and to be what he wants
[1:03:00] you to be back in your right estate
[1:03:03] again. With all that we have done, God
[1:03:07] is loving and he is merciful to give us
[1:03:09] the opportunity. Hallelujah. To be back
[1:03:12] in the right estate again. Amen. Thank
[1:03:14] you Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:03:16] Or look at a prodigal son when he came
[1:03:19] to a condition or a stage in his life.
[1:03:22] He felt that he was man enough to take
[1:03:24] what he had or what bel what belongs to
[1:03:27] him from his father and severely
[1:03:30] relationship and went off because he
[1:03:33] felt that he have enough and he went
[1:03:35] out. Hallelujah. But what happened? The
[1:03:39] time came he lost everything that he had
[1:03:42] and famine was upon the land. Every
[1:03:44] anytime you cut off from the lifeline of
[1:03:47] the word, hallelujah, you're done.
[1:03:51] And that is what is happening today.
[1:03:54] People have come so far that they have
[1:03:57] get so much revelation and they feel
[1:03:59] that they cannot stay with the word any
[1:04:03] longer that they have their own revel.
[1:04:05] They have their own thing. It's death.
[1:04:07] It's spiritual suicide when you cut
[1:04:10] relationship. Hallelujah. From the word
[1:04:12] for the hour. Amen. And that is what is
[1:04:14] happening today. Men are committing
[1:04:16] spiritual suicide and they don't even
[1:04:18] know what they're doing.
[1:04:20] Hallelujah. Because it's a deception.
[1:04:22] It's a delusion. A strong delusion upon
[1:04:25] the face of the earth that people are
[1:04:27] believing a lie. They're living a lie.
[1:04:29] Hallelujah. But God wants you to believe
[1:04:31] and live his word. Hallelujah. Not what
[1:04:33] we think and what we feel because the
[1:04:35] right atmosphere has to be created. And
[1:04:37] when people live in a wrong atmosphere,
[1:04:39] it's only death and confusion and doubt.
[1:04:43] That is why light has come. Hallelujah.
[1:04:45] To set everything in order. Hallelujah.
[1:04:48] Because we recognize that God, he is a
[1:04:50] God of order. Hallelujah. So we come to
[1:04:54] realize that he's not willing any should
[1:04:56] perish, but all might come to
[1:04:58] repentance.
[1:05:00] Hallelujah. Might come to repentance.
[1:05:03] See, and he's done everything that lays
[1:05:05] possible for only God and because of the
[1:05:07] love of God that God is giving us these
[1:05:10] opportunities. Hallelujah. That we could
[1:05:12] come and we can live the way that God
[1:05:14] would have us to live. Hallelujah. The
[1:05:17] prophet of God says, now here it is, and
[1:05:20] it's pretty
[1:05:21] sharp. He says, but listen to this. No
[1:05:24] person is in their right mental status
[1:05:28] until they have accepted the Lord Jesus.
[1:05:32] Amen. Hallelujah. He says that's a deep
[1:05:35] word, but that's the truth. No person is
[1:05:38] mentally right until they have accepted
[1:05:42] Christ Jesus as their personal savior.
[1:05:46] He said that sound but it's the Bible.
[1:05:49] Certainly that is true. Hallelujah.
[1:05:55] That is the very truth because when
[1:05:56] Christ Jesus went across Hallelujah to
[1:05:59] the
[1:06:00] Gdara. Praise God. When Legion was
[1:06:04] there, he was out of his mind, he was
[1:06:07] unsung mind. But when Christ Jesus
[1:06:10] finished with him, hallelujah, then he
[1:06:13] was in his right mind. It's only when
[1:06:15] the word comes, it can bring you in your
[1:06:16] right mind. Only when the word comes,
[1:06:18] hallelujah, it will create the right
[1:06:20] atmosphere that we can live and dwell
[1:06:22] in. But as long as we not abiding in the
[1:06:24] word of God, we are in confusion and we
[1:06:26] are in darkness. But let us stay with
[1:06:28] the word of God. Hallelujah. 2
[1:06:30] Corinthians chapter 5 17 tells us,
[1:06:33] "Therefore, if any man be in Christ,
[1:06:35] he's a new
[1:06:36] creature. Old things have passed away.
[1:06:39] Behold, all things are become new."
[1:06:44] Amen. Hallelujah. So we come to realize
[1:06:47] that if you are in Christ, God is
[1:06:50] calling us through the message of the
[1:06:51] hour. Hallelujah. To put us in a certain
[1:06:54] place that we could stand. Hallelujah.
[1:06:56] Because when he shall appear, we got to
[1:06:58] be just like unto him. We got to stay
[1:07:00] with a word for the hour. But what we
[1:07:02] find there's too much of people catching
[1:07:04] one another spirit in the world today.
[1:07:06] But we need to have the spirit of
[1:07:07] Christ. Hallelujah. The part of God said
[1:07:10] the people get one another spirit
[1:07:11] instead of getting the Holy Spirit. You
[1:07:14] go into a group of people and you watch
[1:07:16] the way that person acts and the then
[1:07:19] kind of people that come in that
[1:07:20] congregation. The first thing you know
[1:07:22] they act the same way. He says you add
[1:07:25] her. He said you take a good woman and a
[1:07:28] bad man and he will either she will
[1:07:30] either become good man or or bad woman.
[1:07:34] It's the atmosphere that you live in.
[1:07:36] You project to your associates what you
[1:07:39] are. Amen. Hallelujah. The atmosphere
[1:07:41] that you live in, you projectly
[1:07:43] associate what you are. Then what type
[1:07:46] of people ought we to be? If we are a
[1:07:49] Christian, what type of atmosphere
[1:07:51] should we live in? The part of God says
[1:07:54] this is very strong. Hallelujah. And we
[1:07:56] should think about this. What type of
[1:08:00] atmosphere should we live in? He said in
[1:08:02] a
[1:08:04] consoling,
[1:08:06] soothing, healing atmosphere we should
[1:08:09] live in with our hearts constantly in
[1:08:12] prayer with a deep love for every person
[1:08:16] we come in contact with. That is
[1:08:18] powerful.
[1:08:20] But that is the word of God. Hallelujah.
[1:08:23] We must be sincere in our hearts.
[1:08:27] Hallelujah. that the way we
[1:08:28] live, consoling, soothing, healing, a
[1:08:33] healing atmosphere we should live in
[1:08:35] that our hearts constantly in prayer
[1:08:37] with a deep love for every person we
[1:08:39] come in contact with. Saints of God, we
[1:08:42] ought to be in deep prayer and
[1:08:43] consecration.
[1:08:45] Could a man or woman go before God
[1:08:48] sincerely in prayer, hallelujah, praying
[1:08:51] for a brother or sister and come out
[1:08:52] with a wrong spirit? It can never
[1:08:55] happen. If it do happen, you are not in
[1:08:58] prayer and you're not consecrated.
[1:09:00] You're just probably saying a prayer.
[1:09:03] God don't want us to say a prayer, what
[1:09:05] it does come, it must come from the
[1:09:06] depths of our heart. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:09:10] Because we come to realize, hallelujah,
[1:09:12] that whatever we do when you come in
[1:09:15] prayer and true consecration before God,
[1:09:17] when you come out, the part of God say
[1:09:19] it doesn't matter what a brother done
[1:09:21] you, no matter how wrong, and you know
[1:09:23] that he done you wrong. When you get
[1:09:26] into the presence of God and you bring
[1:09:28] him before God in prayer, you cannot
[1:09:30] think evil.
[1:09:32] Hallelujah. Why? Because there's the
[1:09:34] presence of God inside of you.
[1:09:37] Hallelujah. You see this message, saints
[1:09:39] of God, this whole message, this whole
[1:09:41] word to us is a message of
[1:09:43] reconciliation.
[1:09:45] Hallelujah. Praise his wonderful name.
[1:09:47] Because we're all lost and we all are a
[1:09:49] done. But God want the right atmosphere
[1:09:52] to be created that we could live in the
[1:09:54] grace and in the mercies of our Lord and
[1:09:56] Savior Jesus Christ. So when we now
[1:09:59] become sons and daughters of God.
[1:10:01] Hallelujah. What happened? The prophet
[1:10:02] of God said our disposition changes.
[1:10:05] Your attitude changes. We cannot live
[1:10:07] the very same again because now you're
[1:10:09] not living by your own self but you're
[1:10:11] living by the grace and the mercies of
[1:10:13] God. Hallelujah. Your attitude change
[1:10:16] you all. You look towards life and
[1:10:19] towards others change. It doesn't mean
[1:10:22] that you just have joined church. It
[1:10:24] means that you have been regenerated.
[1:10:27] You have become a new creation in Christ
[1:10:30] Jesus. That you have the old things have
[1:10:33] passed away and God has spoken to you
[1:10:36] and you have become a new creature. He
[1:10:38] says I want this to go way down even
[1:10:42] into church members.
[1:10:44] Amen. Look out the way the prophet of
[1:10:46] God put this. He says, "Then as you
[1:10:49] would love to be in the presence of
[1:10:50] Christ and you become a part of Christ,
[1:10:54] then people love to become in your
[1:10:56] presence because you become a part of
[1:10:58] God, son and daughter of God." And when
[1:11:02] you become that, hallelujah, let your
[1:11:04] life be salty. Let your life be worthy
[1:11:07] of this gospel that when people come
[1:11:09] into your presence, hallelujah, they can
[1:11:11] see Christ inside of you. Amen. They
[1:11:13] must not see a a personality, my
[1:11:16] personality or your personality.
[1:11:18] Hallelujah. When we preach the gospel,
[1:11:20] it must Christ Jesus must be on display.
[1:11:23] Amen. Hallelujah. That is why many
[1:11:25] people are afraid. Hallelujah. To serve
[1:11:27] to serve God because all they can see is
[1:11:30] man. Hallelujah. But we ought to see
[1:11:32] Christ Jesus being manifested in the
[1:11:34] very word. Amen. Hallelujah. Now you got
[1:11:37] to create an atmosphere. Your faith will
[1:11:39] do it.
[1:11:41] They were all he was talking here that
[1:11:44] they were all in the upper room with one
[1:11:45] accord when suddenly they came from
[1:11:47] heaven a sound of a rushing mighty wind.
[1:11:49] The atmosphere was right. It takes an
[1:11:51] atmosphere to do anything. So for us to
[1:11:54] receive hallelujah life in this hour. We
[1:11:57] need to be in one spirit. We need to be
[1:11:59] in one accord. Just like when the 120
[1:12:02] they went up into the upper room, they
[1:12:04] had to wait on the presence of God.
[1:12:07] Hallelujah. Until they endured power
[1:12:09] from on high. saints of God. But it's a
[1:12:12] it's not easy to wait. It takes
[1:12:15] patience. It takes effort. It takes
[1:12:18] sacrifice. It takes a direction.
[1:12:21] Hallelujah. We when you're waiting on
[1:12:23] something, you must know what you're
[1:12:24] waiting on. If somebody just tell you to
[1:12:27] wait and they don't tell you the time.
[1:12:28] If it's if you know that there's
[1:12:30] something good you're waiting on, you
[1:12:31] don't mind the time. Hallelujah. But if
[1:12:33] it's something not worthwhile, you
[1:12:34] wouldn't want to waste any time.
[1:12:36] Hallelujah. But for you to receive the
[1:12:38] fullness of Christ, the baptism of the
[1:12:40] Holy Ghost in your life, he says, "Go
[1:12:42] into the upper room and wait until you
[1:12:44] be endued with power from on high."
[1:12:47] Hallelujah. So they waited one day, two
[1:12:49] day until they waited 10 days.
[1:12:51] Hallelujah. And when they wait, saints
[1:12:53] of God, then the presence of God came
[1:12:55] down. Hallelujah. And they were all
[1:12:57] filled with the Holy Ghost in their
[1:12:59] life. And saints of God, why? Because
[1:13:01] the right atmosphere was being created.
[1:13:04] Hallelujah. The proud of God says, "We
[1:13:06] are now in heavenly places. We are now
[1:13:09] in the power of the resurrection. If
[1:13:12] there wasn't a law to that, sons and
[1:13:15] daughters of God would create them a
[1:13:17] world out there and go live a private
[1:13:20] life on
[1:13:22] it." Because God made you a creator.
[1:13:25] Look at the power that he give to you.
[1:13:26] You have the power in you to do it. If
[1:13:29] you've got a shadow of the power of God
[1:13:32] in you, you got power to do it. God is
[1:13:36] omnipotent. Hallelu See what I mean? The
[1:13:38] power that's in you will make. You could
[1:13:41] speak a world into existence and go live
[1:13:44] on it. Hallelujah. There you are. That's
[1:13:47] what power is in the church now. Amen.
[1:13:52] But it is controlled by the law. Isn't
[1:13:56] that wonderful? Son's being led by the
[1:13:58] spirit. We cannot do what we feel like
[1:14:00] doing or what we want to do. Hallelujah.
[1:14:03] And the law is not keeping a bunch of
[1:14:06] commandments. It's a law of faith that
[1:14:09] Jesus said, "All things are possible to
[1:14:11] them that believe." And if you can
[1:14:13] believe it, whatever God will lead your
[1:14:17] soul to believe, that is yours. Every
[1:14:21] place that a soul of your foot can set
[1:14:23] upon by faith, God give it to you.
[1:14:26] Hallelujah. That's the word. It's yours.
[1:14:28] You possess it. If you can find a key to
[1:14:31] this law of faith that opens it to you,
[1:14:34] you see what I mean? The power is
[1:14:36] controlled. If you are sons, if you are
[1:14:39] a son of God, you are a daughter of
[1:14:42] God. That never leaves you. It's with
[1:14:46] you all the time. But your faith get
[1:14:48] away from it. But it's still there. If
[1:14:52] you're a son and daughter of God, you're
[1:14:53] always there. But what? You find
[1:14:55] yourself up and down sometime and you're
[1:14:57] not in the right position. Hallelujah.
[1:15:00] But you have to be in the right
[1:15:01] position. Hallelujah. So God wants us to
[1:15:04] get into the right position. And when
[1:15:06] you get into the right position, you'll
[1:15:08] see the manifestation of the life of
[1:15:10] Christ in your life. This time and
[1:15:12] season that we living in is a dangerous
[1:15:15] hour. We got to be careful of the
[1:15:18] atmosphere that we create. Hallelujah.
[1:15:20] Because we are miniature creator. We are
[1:15:22] little dynamos. Hallelujah. And we
[1:15:24] create an atmosphere around us. Amen.
[1:15:26] Hallelujah. And if you're in the light,
[1:15:28] walk in the light as he is in the light.
[1:15:31] Because when you're in the light, people
[1:15:33] can see you in the light. And whatever
[1:15:35] move you make, call, they can see. That
[1:15:37] is why we have to be careful. It's just
[1:15:39] like we are here. If you take off the
[1:15:41] light, you will not see me. Or if
[1:15:43] somebody is out in the darkness outside
[1:15:46] there, they can see all of us inside.
[1:15:48] Hallelujah. People in the darkness can
[1:15:50] see those that are in the light. And
[1:15:52] those who are in the light, you could
[1:15:53] hardly notice on the outside. What
[1:15:55] happens? It's just like sometimes you go
[1:15:57] into the jungles, you know, in South
[1:15:59] America to preach and when you see a
[1:16:02] gathering in front of you, you feel that
[1:16:04] that's all. But it surprises you that
[1:16:06] you don't see those on the outside. And
[1:16:09] there time when you should go on the
[1:16:10] outside and you look, you have more
[1:16:12] people on the outside than the people
[1:16:14] there. Some of them they will standing,
[1:16:16] they stand by trees like that. So, and
[1:16:18] you go when you go outside and you go
[1:16:20] with the light then you want to know
[1:16:21] well there's so much more outside of
[1:16:23] that little building than what is in the
[1:16:25] inside and they can see you and you know
[1:16:28] and sometime you pass them by and they
[1:16:30] say pastor well we hear your preaching
[1:16:32] and we're in the you never saw their you
[1:16:34] never see their faces. Hallelujah. So if
[1:16:36] you're in the light you got to be
[1:16:38] careful of what you say and what you do
[1:16:40] because every action you make it will be
[1:16:42] manifested. Amen. Hallelujah. So we come
[1:16:45] to rely saints of God. He called us to
[1:16:47] dress right, to walk right and to do
[1:16:49] everything that is right. Hallelujah.
[1:16:52] Because in this pathway we need to
[1:16:54] create the right atmosphere. Is just the
[1:16:56] other day we had a a ministering servant
[1:16:57] of God. He came along and he was giving
[1:16:59] us a little example. He says of a
[1:17:02] particular sister in the church, he had
[1:17:04] very long hair and then you know she go
[1:17:06] and cut her hair and the he went to her.
[1:17:08] He said what's the reason why did you
[1:17:10] cut your hair? She says she didn't had
[1:17:12] he said well come. And he took, you
[1:17:13] know, one of those machet he said, "Put
[1:17:15] your finger there." You know, he said,
[1:17:17] "What you going to do?" He said, "Well,
[1:17:18] look at your finger. They are not level.
[1:17:20] I'm going to level them for you." He
[1:17:21] said, "No, no, it's going to hurt." He
[1:17:23] says, "Well, when you cut your hair,
[1:17:24] you're hurting God." Amen.
[1:17:27] So, what an example. Because when you
[1:17:28] look at your fingers, they're not level.
[1:17:31] But you don't want to go, "Well, my
[1:17:32] fingers not level. I'm going to level
[1:17:34] them off." You're going to feel, but
[1:17:36] your hair now it's in a such a way you
[1:17:38] say, "Well, you're going to level it."
[1:17:39] And you may not feel it. But he says
[1:17:41] well when you do that you're hurting
[1:17:42] God. So and then you have younger people
[1:17:45] they come and they look at you and they
[1:17:47] see what you're doing. You see that is
[1:17:49] why the right atmosphere is need to be
[1:17:51] created. Amen. Praise God. Coming down.
[1:17:54] He says apply it. Create the right
[1:17:57] create that atmosphere around you that
[1:18:00] it'll just drop right in it. See he says
[1:18:03] if you got the
[1:18:05] token he says if you got the token you
[1:18:08] create a spirit around you. Amen. A
[1:18:11] power that when you walk, people know
[1:18:14] you are a Christian. You don't have to
[1:18:16] tell people what you are, but your life,
[1:18:19] something inside of you is ringing out
[1:18:21] that people can see the life of Christ.
[1:18:24] They love for you to say something to
[1:18:26] them. Isn't that so? You go places, it
[1:18:29] might be not even believers, but they
[1:18:32] just want you to tell them something
[1:18:34] that will brighten up the day. You know
[1:18:36] why? Because you're a little dynamo. You
[1:18:39] are creator is that spirit that is
[1:18:40] inside of you. Hallelujah. The love for
[1:18:44] you to say something to them. They
[1:18:46] believe your word. What you say, they
[1:18:49] hold on to it. See, that's it. So, as
[1:18:52] ministers, we got to be careful what we
[1:18:54] say and how we live because people hold
[1:18:57] on to your word. Whatever you tell
[1:19:00] people, they will want to do. But make
[1:19:02] sure that you lead them in the right
[1:19:04] direction. God didn't call us to give
[1:19:07] direction and and examples like the
[1:19:09] scribes and the Pharisees because they
[1:19:11] did things what they feel and they
[1:19:13] always feel that they're obligated to
[1:19:15] give men an answer which they themselves
[1:19:17] never have the answer for. That is why
[1:19:19] Pharisees are being called hypocrites.
[1:19:21] Hallelujah. Because they will tell
[1:19:22] people things that they don't even know
[1:19:24] themselves. Hallelujah. But we want to
[1:19:26] thank God for a prophet. He was honest.
[1:19:29] And if he didn't have an answer for
[1:19:30] something, he going to tell you. But
[1:19:32] before he finish, hallelujah. God will
[1:19:34] give him the answer for the question.
[1:19:36] Hallelujah. Because for many as are led
[1:19:38] by the spirit of God, they are the sons
[1:19:40] of God. Hallelujah. Finally, apply the
[1:19:44] token. Then walk with it. Claim your
[1:19:47] household. You must do it. Ben, now this
[1:19:52] is evening time. Now you've been
[1:19:54] listening a long time. Now this is
[1:19:56] evening time. It's applying time now.
[1:19:59] The wrath will strike one of these days.
[1:20:02] It might be too late then. See, apply
[1:20:05] the token with confidence. Saints of
[1:20:08] God. This is time. Hallelujah. The death
[1:20:10] angel will pass. Hallelujah. So if the
[1:20:13] right atmosphere is being created,
[1:20:15] saints of God, it will be a soothing,
[1:20:17] welcoming atmosphere that a presence of
[1:20:20] God can come and anybody comes your way,
[1:20:22] they're going to recognize the presence
[1:20:24] of God. And the word say wherever the
[1:20:26] presence of God is, there is liberty.
[1:20:30] Hallelujah. So saints of God, we need to
[1:20:32] create the right atmosphere by the grace
[1:20:35] of God. Let us all stand together.
[1:20:37] Praise God. And praise his wonderful
[1:20:40] name.
[1:20:42] Hallelujah. Praise God. To be like
[1:20:49] Jesus. To be like Jesus.

[1:23:43] Amen. Let there be light. Amen. Surely
[1:23:45] the Lord light the darkness can't stay
[1:23:47] in the light. We It was just amazing. I
[1:23:51] just thought about it when he started
[1:23:53] out, you know, how often time we want
[1:23:56] God to do something on the inside. But
[1:23:58] the first thing first before he can do
[1:24:00] anything, he must separate the darkness
[1:24:02] from the light. Amen. And when that
[1:24:04] darkness is separated or dispelled,
[1:24:07] Amen. then God can do a work. Is that
[1:24:09] right? Amen. So, we appreciate the Lord
[1:24:11] Jesus Christ. We're not going to prolong
[1:24:13] the time the word of God is is is uh
[1:24:16] more than words can express. Amen. We
