[18:30] heavenly lover
[18:32] let thy precious cover Shekinah on Nene
[18:41] is all
[18:44] No oh you love the Lord he's sweet I
[18:54] know as we stand gonna get right into
[19:00] the Word of God
[19:01] thank you brother Marsha we appreciate
[19:06] you I so marvel how God can bring such a
[19:15] message as he did on this morning and
[19:22] yet we find that the message didn't fall
[19:29] in the right places had it fallen in the
[19:35] heart it would have been more people
[19:39] here tonight but that's what the Word of
[19:43] God says and here God's be call on
[19:48] diligent being more diligent in in the
[19:52] things that we do for God and Christians
[19:56] have become so weak and so how would I
[20:02] say it
[20:03] you just can't depend on them anymore
[20:05] like it used to but nevertheless amen
[20:10] we are here tonight and I want to speak
[20:14] a little message and hopefully it'll be
[20:16] a blessing to you I was going to
[20:20] continue on that thought I had last week
[20:22] on escaping the evil in the darkness but
[20:27] I'm gonna save that I'm working I got
[20:32] some more to come and so I want to give
[20:35] another little thought tonight so that
[20:37] you can see that you've got more than
[20:39] what you think you have because only the
[20:43] real true revelation of God in your
[20:46] heart will cause you to press through
[20:49] every
[20:52] how can I say it it would cause you to
[20:55] to push through every obstacle every
[21:02] hindrance everything that Satan places
[21:06] in your way it would cause you to go
[21:10] forward and not backwards so as we stand
[21:15] we're gonna ask that you turn with us to
[21:19] Exodus I'm sorry let's go to Matthew 15
[21:25] 16 please Matthew 16 we are thankful for
[21:37] the Word of God that came today
[21:41] real blessing what what the Lord brought
[21:45] forth last night in Iowa City was a
[21:49] blessing as well but I find out that
[21:54] having a good service it would either
[22:00] set you free or place you into more
[22:02] bondage you could never hear the word of
[22:05] God and remain the same it either sets
[22:10] you free or places you more into bondage
[22:14] Matthew 16 please a real simple message
[22:20] I believe that's the way God likes it he
[22:23] likes it so we can understand what we
[22:27] need to do and what he's saying Matthew
[22:30] 16 beginning at the fifteenth verse he
[22:36] said unto them but whom say ye that I am
[22:41] Simon Peter answered and said thou art
[22:44] the Christ the Son of the Living God
[22:49] jesus answered and said unto him blessed
[22:53] art thou simon barjona for flesh and
[22:57] blood hath not revealed it unto thee but
[23:00] my father which is in heaven and I say
[23:04] also unto thee
[23:06] thou art Peter and upon this rock I will
[23:10] build my church and the gates of Hell
[23:13] shall not prevail against it let us pray
[23:19] Heavenly Father we come before you and
[23:22] we thank you for your amazing grace Lord
[23:27] you have been better to us than we are
[23:29] have been to ourselves and we thank you
[23:32] God we ask you now Lord to be with us in
[23:41] these trying times and the times that we
[23:47] find very hard but yet you ordained us
[23:52] for this time and so therefore we thank
[23:55] you Father
[23:56] bless the service bless those who are
[23:59] here tonight we ask these things in your
[24:03] name Jesus Christ we pray amen
[24:06] you may be seated there are things that
[24:14] I have seen in this message which I
[24:21] don't know whether many people see it's
[24:26] right before us I really believe that
[24:30] the enemy has caused us to stress
[24:40] ourselves in knowing greater and deeper
[24:44] revelations and there's nothing with
[24:50] deep revelations matter of fact I love
[24:54] it it's good but there is a process in
[25:00] which we come through in order to secure
[25:06] our place in heaven deep revelation and
[25:13] knowing all the plans of God will do you
[25:16] no good if
[25:19] don't follow the pattern in which God
[25:24] has laid out for us to make a rapture to
[25:29] know what the seven thunders are to know
[25:33] what the seven seals to know that God
[25:35] sent a prophet all those things are
[25:37] great it is necessary it is something
[25:42] that we should know it is the children's
[25:46] bread but Paul who was the first angel
[25:52] first messenger in this great salvation
[25:56] of God has told us to know all the
[26:00] mysteries to understand all the
[26:04] mysteries and not have charity it
[26:08] profits us nothing
[26:11] it took the seventh angel brother
[26:15] branham Elijah to come in this day God
[26:20] took us a man who had only a seventh
[26:24] grade education he suffered he learned
[26:29] obedience through the things in which he
[26:32] suffered at times when he would let go
[26:36] wayward and in and make his own decision
[26:39] about things God spanked him and several
[26:42] times he almost died even though the
[26:46] ministries and the places he would go
[26:48] would explore with miracles yet he still
[26:53] was not in the perfect will of God
[26:55] because he chose to do it his way and I
[27:01] said all of that because God had a
[27:04] greater plan for him at the end time God
[27:08] would open up those seven seals and he
[27:12] needed a man who would not inject his
[27:15] own thoughts in his own feelings because
[27:18] he understood God knew that that that he
[27:21] did not need an interpreter of the word
[27:25] God needed someone who could bring the
[27:28] interpretation in otherwise the message
[27:32] is about the interim
[27:33] of william branham it is God speaking
[27:36] the interpretation through brother
[27:39] branham why are you saying all these
[27:41] things because we know in order to make
[27:46] a rapture in our age we must first be
[27:52] obedient by way of the spokesman who we
[27:58] know as Peter on the day of Pentecost
[28:01] they said what must we do to be safe he
[28:04] said repent and that's where that's one
[28:07] word you rarely ever hear preached
[28:12] across the pulpit is repentance what is
[28:17] repentance what good will it do for man
[28:21] to be baptized in the name of Jesus
[28:24] Christ without repentance the baptism is
[28:28] of no avail it doesn't profit them
[28:30] anything because repentance must come
[28:33] first you understand what I'm saying so
[28:37] I'm trying to say these things I'm
[28:39] saying these things because my subject
[28:45] tonight is upon this rock because you
[28:52] got to realize that it's a revelation
[28:55] that God gives you it doesn't matter how
[28:58] much education you have you can have a
[29:00] doctor's divinity or DDL D of literature
[29:05] but if you don't have the revelation of
[29:09] who God is
[29:10] you'll never know who you are you'll
[29:13] never know you'll never come to
[29:15] understand where you come from and where
[29:17] you're going
[29:20] revelation as brother Brennan said it is
[29:22] so important to the bride but we have
[29:27] been listening to revelation at the
[29:29] revelation of a revelation it meant and
[29:32] most of the revelation that we have been
[29:34] listening to is basically who brother
[29:40] Branham is all the shadows and type of
[29:44] who he is
[29:45] who
[29:46] right is and all the shadows and types
[29:50] of who the bride is but we have not seen
[29:54] yet men preaching the Word of God to
[30:01] show the bride of Jesus Christ how to
[30:05] become bride hmm how do you become Ryo
[30:10] I just believe I'm right no it's more to
[30:14] it than that first of all a man must be
[30:18] born again
[30:20] you can cannot even understand this
[30:24] message until you born again because the
[30:28] carnal mind cannot understand the
[30:31] spiritual things that are of God you
[30:34] look right at it you can quote it and
[30:37] still not understand it because the Word
[30:42] of God because it is spirit
[30:44] it must be spiritually discerned that's
[30:48] why we see people over said gross
[30:51] darkness to cover the people but it's
[30:53] not it's not people are just out in the
[30:55] world they're lying darkness but it is
[30:58] the church they are the ones that are
[31:01] walking in gross darkness and they can't
[31:04] even comprehend that they are in
[31:08] darkness somebody help me here see a
[31:13] revelation must be given to you by God
[31:19] because that's what the Word of God said
[31:22] Peter who do you who do men say that I
[31:24] am then he goes up but who do you say I
[31:27] am we must know the I am and the I am
[31:33] must know us hallelujah you got to
[31:38] understand the bride of Jesus Christ is
[31:42] not a mail-order bride
[31:45] she didn't come by UPS no sir she is
[31:50] ordained of God she is a woman that is
[31:55] redeemable
[31:57] she was the thought of God in God's
[32:00] mind she was the thought she was the
[32:03] very existence of God in a feminine form
[32:10] it's amazing because the answer to
[32:15] Peters to Jesus question was you Dow are
[32:20] the Christ the Son of the Living God in
[32:26] other words you're not just a prophet
[32:30] you're more than a prophet you are the
[32:33] Living God that's what he's saying
[32:37] because Israel didn't believe in to gods
[32:40] or three gods they only knew one and
[32:44] they understood that when the Messiah
[32:45] would come he would be God is that what
[32:48] brother Adam said Jews know that when
[32:51] the Messiah comes he will be God in the
[32:55] flesh so in order to understand God you
[33:05] say why are you saying these things
[33:08] because Jesus could have used some other
[33:14] type upon this water but he said upon
[33:19] this rock I'll build my church in other
[33:24] words the rock was the revelation you
[33:32] understand me
[33:33] a rock of defense is your revelation of
[33:39] Jesus Christ okay if we can understand
[33:43] that the revelation of Jesus Christ is
[33:47] the very rock of defense it is your
[33:50] shelter hallelujah it is your buckler it
[33:55] is your shield it is your everything
[34:01] hallelujah
[34:03] just that one revelation as simple as it
[34:09] is boom he said the
[34:14] of Hell shall not prevail against this
[34:18] the revelation that Jesus Christ or God
[34:23] has come into the flesh that right
[34:26] remember even John said except a man
[34:30] believe that Jesus Christ is coming to
[34:33] the flesh he is Antichrist upon this
[34:39] rock upon this rock I build my church
[34:43] and let me understand when you working
[34:45] with bricks you lay those bricks and you
[34:48] build brick upon brick with the same
[34:50] kind of brick in other words the
[34:56] substance of the house must be of the
[34:59] substance of the foundation it must be
[35:01] of the same material hey he's my rock so
[35:10] when we hear the word rock you must
[35:12] understand it's not talking about some
[35:15] stone you throw or some natural granite
[35:19] or some kind of thing that nature put
[35:21] together when they talk about a rock
[35:24] they talk about their defense they're
[35:27] talking about the God who defeats all of
[35:34] their enemies remember there's always a
[35:42] saying let me stand on the rock where
[35:49] Moses Stewart you see because the rock
[35:52] in itself is what revelation not only is
[35:58] that right God the same rock that Jesus
[36:02] was talking about he says not not not
[36:04] not not like brother Brennan said not
[36:06] just Jesus is himself but the revelation
[36:10] of who Jesus is is that right
[36:13] who do men say I am listen it's the
[36:16] revelation of who he is that will bring
[36:19] us through this evil age we know he's
[36:24] not denomination we know he's not a
[36:26] Trinitarian we
[36:28] no he's not a to God we know he is one
[36:31] God and not like the oneness you must
[36:35] understand that because that will be the
[36:37] only way you understand your oneness
[36:40] with God Father I would that they be one
[36:43] even as we are one
[36:46] hallelujah and once you understand the
[36:49] oneness of Christ and God you understand
[36:52] your oneness upon this rock I build my
[36:56] church
[36:58] hallelujah he is my god and i'ma say it
[37:05] like this
[37:05] Amen that rock that Moses stood on it's
[37:09] the same rock that was in the rock right
[37:13] come on somebody remember when when when
[37:17] God took Marion mops and all they took
[37:21] he took him to her tomb a tomb that was
[37:23] in a rock but inside the rock was a rock
[37:27] in otherwise there was a revelation
[37:31] laying there hallelujah how can I say it
[37:36] I said Mary Martha but I'm saying when
[37:39] Mary went down to the tomb hairy man and
[37:42] saw a man that there stone was no longer
[37:45] there she says who stolen my lord
[37:49] hallelujah you don't have to steal him
[37:53] he's a gift going to God hallelujah she
[37:56] looked for him and he was right there
[37:59] it was only when God Himself Christ
[38:01] himself that great Rock opened her eyes
[38:04] and called her by name that's one thing
[38:08] about the revelation of God it calls you
[38:11] by name hallelujah when you think about
[38:16] today and the evil that is now lurking
[38:21] among the people of God among the
[38:23] Churches of God amen among what we call
[38:26] the bride it is amazing that people know
[38:30] all kinds of things about the message
[38:32] but they don't know the true Messinger
[38:37] but all of you understood the revelation
[38:43] the Word of God is out of any private
[38:46] interpretation so even William Branham
[38:50] could not privately interpret interpret
[38:52] the word it was Christ in him bringing
[38:56] the revelation of the word you
[38:59] understand and when you see that you can
[39:02] take those words as ah that's me when I
[39:06] hear the message of God I don't put it
[39:08] on somebody else
[39:09] I pray sit here I eat that word I take
[39:13] it in because I realize it is what I
[39:16] live by it is my protection
[39:21] Oh somebody help me here when I think
[39:28] about Amen the church built upon the
[39:31] rock and I think about the gates of Hell
[39:33] everybody think the gates of Hell Amen
[39:35] is some Clubhouse out here some kind of
[39:38] this is some kind of that out there no
[39:40] sir the gates of hell is church
[39:42] organization it is the systems that are
[39:47] offering life and the Bible tells us
[39:50] amen a call according to proverbs Amen I
[39:54] think seven if you go in there ain't
[39:57] nothing in there but death and you know
[40:00] I must understand Amen they say by seven
[40:04] oh my god let me move on we talk about
[40:09] life brother Balaam said you must have
[40:15] the token wonder what people think the
[40:18] token is you think the token is just a
[40:22] piece of cloth
[40:23] what is the token what is the token it's
[40:27] Jesus Christ when I see the Blood I pass
[40:31] over you
[40:32] it wasn't the chemistry of the blood it
[40:36] was the life that it represented that
[40:38] made that enemy pass over it we talked
[40:42] about heaven we must apply the token
[40:46] that means we must come up with the
[40:48] goods
[40:48] he said the Boxcar must be sealed every
[40:54] box must be in
[40:55] tightly fifteen right it can't rattle or
[41:00] shake win-win-win-win-win been going
[41:02] through troubles
[41:03] it must be solid that's how those
[41:06] virtues must live within us it must be a
[41:11] solid one spirit displaying seven
[41:15] attributes eight with with divine love
[41:19] the rainbow not worn on the outside like
[41:24] Joseph but worn on the inside it's an
[41:27] inside garment because this common here
[41:32] will die this is what we call the body
[41:36] of death hallelujah
[41:38] Paul said who shall deliver me from this
[41:41] body of death my rock my revelation
[41:46] hallelujah and that's when he took Mary
[41:49] and Martha it meant to the tomb of
[41:51] Lazarus he said I want you to know
[41:53] something me about Bob me Mary and
[41:55] Martha I'm not just a prophet hallelujah
[41:59] but I will give you another step I am
[42:02] the resurrection hallelujah he was
[42:05] teaching them they'd seen him do a lot
[42:08] of miracles they've seen him raised the
[42:10] day they've seen him open the eyes of
[42:13] the blind but now he was teaching them
[42:15] something else I am not just that I'm
[42:18] more than that when I told you though a
[42:22] man be dead he shall live again that's
[42:25] what I'm saying if you believe in me
[42:28] don't you be dead you'll live again ha I
[42:32] am the resurrection in other words I am
[42:35] the power that quickens the dead
[42:39] hallelujah
[42:41] the Lord will always fight our battles
[42:45] that rock that revelation you understand
[42:50] me
[42:50] I love the Lord so much you know why
[42:53] because he allowed himself to be
[42:57] separated from his creator for a moment
[43:03] time he was left alone as a sinner like
[43:08] you and I
[43:09] I would have been left alone had not we
[43:12] had a redeemer but he knew that what sin
[43:17] did was separate us from God himself so
[43:20] he became sin therefore he had to be
[43:24] separated brother Aaron said he had
[43:27] never been separated from God or the
[43:29] Jehovah God before but he with the
[43:31] cavalry as a man and there on the cross
[43:35] he said my God my God why is thou
[43:38] forsaken me why did he do that he did
[43:42] that so when he would overcome he can
[43:45] say and and they could come to pass I'll
[43:49] never leave you nor will I forsake you
[43:52] in all your dark hours I will always be
[43:56] there when you come to death and though
[43:59] you may look like a sinner it's the
[44:02] truth Paul said this body it dies it
[44:05] comes incorruptible but it leaves out
[44:07] incorruptible hallelujah we we come in
[44:11] model but we leave out immortality huh
[44:14] amore excuse me and then you say well
[44:17] what do you say that is a revelation
[44:19] that is a rock and you never you gotta
[44:23] have this revelation what you're saying
[44:25] Brigham's you've got to know that you
[44:27] know that you know that you know that
[44:29] you came from God and you go back to God
[44:31] you got to know that you are the seed of
[44:34] God in this day and hour you came faced
[44:40] death with the hope you must face death
[44:44] with faith the Bible said they all died
[44:46] in faith and when they died and they
[44:49] guess what when Jesus rose again they
[44:52] rose with him Wow
[44:54] because they died in faith they died
[44:57] with that revelation even though I had
[45:00] to accomplish everything I want to
[45:02] accomplish I did not come to the place I
[45:04] want to come but I traveled by faith I
[45:07] journeyed in faith they all died in
[45:10] faith what is faith revelation
[45:19] that only God can give you is that right
[45:23] Joseph died in faith he said I'm dying
[45:26] over here needs you but don't leave my
[45:28] bones here
[45:29] take me to the place I know the
[45:33] resurrect are will come to resurrect
[45:36] hallelujah take me to that place where
[45:39] the resurrection is going to happen
[45:41] don't eat me over here in Egypt
[45:44] hallelujah think about it
[45:46] four hundred and something years or
[45:47] however long it was later amen they win
[45:51] and they believe Joseph report they pack
[45:54] his bones with them when they left out
[45:56] of Egypt hallelujah y'all love that
[45:59] think about it it's a revelation of who
[46:02] Christ is to you when you can see these
[46:07] things no man's Dogma or doctrine can be
[46:10] feature hallelujah because you know
[46:13] you're not saved by doctrine you saved
[46:16] by grace hallelujah anyhow what you do
[46:20] for Christ is what Christ has done for
[46:22] you the reason why we live holy the
[46:25] reason why we live righteous is because
[46:27] we want to show him our gratitude for
[46:30] what he's done for us is that right the
[46:34] Bob said all men have sinned and come
[46:36] short of the glory of God hallelujah I
[46:40] don't know about you but I want to love
[46:42] him so much I want to love him so much I
[46:45] can't explain what I'm trying to say but
[46:48] I want the love of God in me so much
[46:49] that when he looks at me he smiles
[46:53] yeah that's what am i you know it's like
[46:59] God thinking the message he longed for
[47:00] the RAM said this young boy his daddy it
[47:05] died and all he had was this big brother
[47:07] one day he asked his brother about Daddy
[47:10] do you know much about daddy well yeah
[47:12] well he was he was just kind of man he
[47:14] was nice it's good to mama he was good
[47:16] to this that's there he said but that's
[47:18] all you know he said well they tell me I
[47:21] got his mannerism I kind of act like him
[47:25] and and I look just like him did yeah
[47:27] that's what I want to know he said so
[47:29] when I see you I see my daddy see and
[47:31] that's what God wants with
[47:33] so that people that's what I'm saying
[47:35] how many people you know that are trying
[47:39] to press so into the image of God that
[47:41] when people see you they see Jesus see
[47:46] this is the message that's what they
[47:49] brother branham different because he
[47:51] wasn't gonna shadow a man for the mark
[47:53] of the beast he wasn't gonna settle for
[47:55] system
[47:56] he broke he went beyond the cap he
[48:00] wanted to look like him talk like him
[48:03] act like him everything he could be he
[48:06] wanted to be just like Jesus he knew
[48:09] himself he wasn't Jesus but he wanted to
[48:11] be just like him he want to be a carrier
[48:14] of him think about it I don't know how
[48:21] that donkey felt brother that carried
[48:25] Jesus for that distance into the gates
[48:29] of Jerusalem but he must have felt
[48:31] pretty good you know we go meet him
[48:33] right we don't see that donkey kick
[48:37] hallelujah he had to feel pretty good
[48:40] here was a master of the universe the
[48:42] Great Creator and then the all is
[48:44] alright know me the poor little donkey
[48:46] ha ha yeah chosen by God is that right
[48:53] he was so chosen God had him tired up in
[48:57] a certain place and that's how it is
[49:03] with God when God choose you he tie you
[49:06] up he puts you in a certain place you
[49:09] can't get away when he's ready to ride
[49:12] you he's ready to ride you hmm
[49:17] you look at things and we look at things
[49:20] and we fail to see that this one
[49:22] revelation is the thing that defeats the
[49:24] devil you don't need the whole book
[49:27] though the whole book is good y'all
[49:30] understand what I'm saying
[49:31] but let me make myself clear you may not
[49:35] come even out her brother BAM said I may
[49:37] he may not understand everything in the
[49:39] book he said but I know the author you
[49:42] may not understand everything but
[49:46] you know the after that's your rock
[49:49] that's your revelation and doing the
[49:54] devil knows when you know that you know
[49:56] who Jesus is when you understand Jesus
[50:00] is not a secondary God he doesn't take
[50:03] second place to not matter of fact she
[50:07] said if there'd be another God I don't
[50:08] know him
[50:10] you understand me
[50:12] so when death comes on your door he just
[50:15] can't come knocking down your door and
[50:17] take you you have a right to ask him did
[50:22] Jesus send you any sickness or whatever
[50:29] that comes across your path you have a
[50:32] right to kick him out you have a right
[50:34] to make the lead except you get a word
[50:38] from God Jesus himself could have got
[50:45] out of the crucifixion we didn't know
[50:48] they did God left it up to him
[50:51] did y'all know that it was left up to
[50:55] him he had to make a choice on whether
[51:00] he would go to Calvary or not and he had
[51:03] a battle with the devil the devil no
[51:06] doubt perhaps put all kinds of thoughts
[51:09] in his head and you know probably tried
[51:12] to overcome with fear buddy and didn't
[51:13] understand that was love in that body
[51:16] yeah amen love repels fear fear would
[51:22] come will come but love repairs fear
[51:31] there was Jesus as a man brother branham
[51:34] said when he when he got to that place
[51:36] the Holy Spirit left him he went down
[51:39] into the Garden of Gethsemane and he's
[51:43] asking his fellow man come pray with me
[51:45] in our rock kneeling on a rock praying
[51:56] on a rock
[52:00] you what's your time I see Jesus knew
[52:03] who his father was
[52:04] he knew his father and who we laid on
[52:08] that rocky is that right you lay on the
[52:10] rock of the rock will crush you you fall
[52:13] on the rock of the rock will crush you
[52:16] he fell on that rocket is his father I
[52:19] would that this cup pass from me but
[52:22] this is the part I like nevertheless not
[52:25] my will but thine be done are you
[52:29] talking about Brotherhood your sacrifice
[52:33] we don't give enough credit to our
[52:35] sacrifice not him that willeth know he
[52:40] that running but God that shows mercy
[52:44] hallelujah we don't give enough credit
[52:47] to our sacrifice
[52:49] you shall have power after which the
[52:52] Holy Ghost is come upon you that's how
[52:54] you live when the power of the rock is
[52:57] living in you the revelation of the rock
[53:00] come from somebody if you can just get
[53:03] what I'm saying here tonight it will
[53:06] make you a different man a different
[53:08] woman when you realize that the very
[53:10] creator of all things is the revelation
[53:13] of Jesus Christ
[53:15] living in you if I've said the demons
[53:20] shake and tremble at the name of Jesus
[53:26] sometimes we just hope to make him shake
[53:29] and tremble just to do it I'm saying
[53:32] Jesus make him shake call on the name of
[53:41] Jesus he hates that because he knows
[53:46] that name has defeated him every time
[53:49] hallelujah at the name of Jesus that
[53:52] right it will defeat every time when you
[53:55] in pain call on the name of Jesus oh
[54:00] mercy Jesus cheated that's all you can
[54:03] say Jesus Jesus Jesus hallelujah stir
[54:08] truth I remember when I first got saved
[54:11] in the enemy
[54:12] me to go out and do some winter things
[54:14] and I could feel that anointing all over
[54:16] me and I'm like Lord you have sanctified
[54:18] me and I do not want to go back
[54:20] hallelujah
[54:21] you know what I did I said Jesus Jesus
[54:24] Jesus that's one thing about the
[54:27] Pentecostal church they're they teach
[54:28] you how to call on Jesus message people
[54:32] need some Pentecostal apostolic or
[54:37] something in when you're in desperation
[54:43] you call him we had that man that man
[54:48] last night he is inspired by oh but I
[54:58] can feel the fear mounting up on the
[55:00] people you know what they were thinking
[55:02] this BAM I come here with a gun some
[55:04] people they were thinking that I caught
[55:07] the thought and I said you know that's a
[55:09] shame
[55:11] hallelujah that we would fear even when
[55:16] I sang this up I sang the next song
[55:18] everybody had to tone it down a little
[55:20] bit because that fear entered into the
[55:24] service and people captured it and now
[55:27] they were afraid come on so what it's a
[55:31] great testimony if he come as a boom
[55:33] boom boom what you afraid of you can't
[55:37] die and I guarantee you he wants you to
[55:41] translate it into the next Kingdom you
[55:43] goes oh ha ha
[55:45] what was I waiting on yeah why do we do
[55:50] what we do when you don't fear death he
[55:57] can't take you and brother who said that
[56:03] death is what hearing that but a little
[56:05] horsing but he's asleep he's your flunky
[56:07] he's the one that you ride all the guid
[56:10] where you go to your next station but
[56:16] you don't ever feel the enemy I don't
[56:19] care what it is
[56:20] you don't fear him because you realize
[56:24] by your revelation
[56:26] greater is He that is in us than he does
[56:29] in the world I don't care what listen I
[56:33] when I got sick that time with all that
[56:35] pain because of that eye situation and
[56:37] the pain was so excruciating and
[56:39] everything else and I thought to myself
[56:41] Oh God
[56:42] I didn't know how to act I didn't know
[56:44] what to say you look like I got
[56:46] frustrated in my fresh and anger angry
[56:49] and I don't know whether oh spend those
[56:51] kind of unknown things were right but
[56:53] they were there you know Nemean but who
[56:56] was out gonna get angry at all I wanted
[56:58] was the pain to stop you understand me
[57:01] and then when I thought about Jesus I
[57:05] thought about Calvary I said Oh Lord you
[57:10] sent me through this just to learn this
[57:12] lesson if that's what it is is okay with
[57:14] me because I've from that moment on I
[57:18] have loved my god more to know that he
[57:21] could I've stopped the pain he could
[57:25] have said it's enough but you know what
[57:29] at times when he looked like he was
[57:31] gonna be defeated he pushed himself up
[57:34] for more pain because he realized that
[57:38] the pain that he was being inflicted on
[57:41] him was what B was deserving hallelujah
[57:47] the Bible said that God has not dealt
[57:49] with us according to our sins thank God
[57:54] for Calvary thank God for the rock thank
[57:57] God for the revelation of Jesus Christ
[58:00] that His grace and His mercy endureth
[58:02] forever hallelujah and His mercies amen
[58:06] I renewed and this is what I get I can
[58:08] hardly stand it when we allow Satan to
[58:11] make us think we're suffering because of
[58:14] some evil deed you either justified or
[58:20] you're not brother branham said when
[58:23] you're justified as though you never
[58:25] sinned in the first place that's the way
[58:27] God does it when you when you're
[58:29] suffering you're going through lessons
[58:32] hallelujah and God is trying to get
[58:35] something out of you that's in you
[58:37] because you said father I want to
[58:40] just like you hallelujah God is not a
[58:44] woman Peter he doesn't beat his wife for
[58:48] pleasure but you know what he does he
[58:55] corrects her because he loves her thank
[58:59] God for the correction
[59:00] thank God that's why it says in
[59:02] everything give thanks how many I'll
[59:09] believe that all things work together I
[59:11] believe that with all of my heart that's
[59:13] my rock
[59:14] that's my revelation I don't care
[59:17] whether it's naturally financially
[59:18] whatever and spiritually I'm going
[59:21] through this and it's gonna work toward
[59:23] my good something God is doing even
[59:26] though I don't understand that
[59:27] it's gonna work for my god and guess
[59:30] what the Bible said when you're tried in
[59:33] the fire you'll come out like pure gold
[59:37] hey that's what I'm saying I'm gold now
[59:41] I may not look like it from here
[59:42] but gold tried in the fire I heard this
[59:51] message I received this message and so
[59:55] the message has identified all of us as
[59:58] gold go try it in the fire come on I'm
[1:00:06] gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna purify you I'm
[1:00:09] gonna bring the fire hallelujah but at
[1:00:13] the end of it all I'll be able to see my
[1:00:16] image in you that's what I'm saying
[1:00:18] thank God for the gold haha thanks God
[1:00:21] for the fire everything I go through I'm
[1:00:24] gonna take him I'm gonna praise him
[1:00:26] hallelujah
[1:00:28] um listen you love the Lord we're not
[1:00:33] here to kill to be just anything I might
[1:00:36] read a quote coming from Christianity
[1:00:38] versus idolatry here the Prophet God
[1:00:42] says we are made partakers of his
[1:00:44] holiness
[1:00:45] we're in his image we are living images
[1:00:49] of the Living God and you know i I've
[1:00:52] always thought now
[1:00:53] was the bride of Jesus Christ 61 moving
[1:00:57] up to her perfection but brother Branham
[1:01:00] is not saying we're going to be he says
[1:01:03] we are he's using the present tense the
[1:01:07] way God would speak you understand me
[1:01:11] he's not looking at your Falls he's not
[1:01:13] looking at your heirs
[1:01:14] because whom he justified he is also
[1:01:17] glorified so he's looking at the
[1:01:20] glorified state of the bride of Jesus
[1:01:22] Christ and telling her listen in your
[1:01:25] glorified state this is who you are and
[1:01:27] so therefore you must be as you are now
[1:01:32] right be this now listen we are made
[1:01:36] partakers of his holiness we in His
[1:01:39] image we are living images of the Living
[1:01:44] God then dare to self raised with him
[1:01:49] now listen listen to this his word made
[1:01:53] flesh again in us look what it is not
[1:01:57] the mystical imaginary God sitting out
[1:02:01] there but the Living God
[1:02:04] what is the Living God the world in you
[1:02:07] making itself real don't tell me these
[1:02:12] signs shall follow them that believe
[1:02:14] your signs are not following you
[1:02:17] signs are following they'll believe oh
[1:02:21] hello the word living in you that means
[1:02:26] you move from justification to
[1:02:28] sanctification to the baptism of Holy
[1:02:30] Ghost to the sealing of God himself in
[1:02:32] other words to the very full image of
[1:02:35] God in you is that right brother Balaam
[1:02:38] said all that was in God he poured it
[1:02:41] into Christ and all that was in Christ
[1:02:43] he poured it into his church every one
[1:02:46] of the virtues you see that's what may
[1:02:48] make us different hallelujah Ephesus had
[1:02:51] faith Smyrna virtue it went that way but
[1:02:55] in this day we have them all faith
[1:02:59] virtue knowledge temperance patient
[1:03:01] godliness brotherly kindness all the way
[1:03:03] up we must be what the fullness
[1:03:06] and Paul Saturdays like this they cannot
[1:03:08] be complete without us the very capstone
[1:03:13] of God is in the pride of Jesus Christ
[1:03:15] you say well that's what brother Berman
[1:03:18] said he said the voice of the
[1:03:20] resurrection is in the bride what is the
[1:03:23] voice of the resurrection Jesus Christ
[1:03:26] hallelujah here a choked voice it's the
[1:03:29] voice in you Jesus Christ himself mmm
[1:03:34] this okay but all brother do you see it
[1:03:38] triumph over every denomination triumph
[1:03:42] over all paganism a living God made
[1:03:46] manifest in a living temple and the Word
[1:03:48] of God which is God is made flesh in you
[1:03:52] why you're seated in heavenly places
[1:03:55] triumphed over all things in Christ
[1:03:58] Jesus amen not tomorrow now and you must
[1:04:06] be that's your revelation
[1:04:10] that's your revelation hmm the same
[1:04:17] powerful God is a humble God clothed in
[1:04:24] humility hallelujah is that right the
[1:04:28] same Jesus Christ
[1:04:29] one day became a foot washed flunky oh
[1:04:34] come on somebody yes what he did he
[1:04:38] humbled himself and washed his disciples
[1:04:41] feet let me tell you something that was
[1:04:46] more than symbolism it was reality
[1:04:50] because Jesus told Peter if you don't
[1:04:53] come to this level you won't make it if
[1:04:57] you and I can't wash our brother's feet
[1:05:01] forgive them of their sins their fears
[1:05:04] their shortcomings and we can't do that
[1:05:06] don't you even expect that you're
[1:05:08] getting to heaven that way you can't
[1:05:10] forgive your brothers neither can God
[1:05:12] forgive you
[1:05:14] hallelujah what stop healings
[1:05:16] unforgiveness what stopped the
[1:05:18] resurrection I'm from
[1:05:19] give this what stop your growth in god
[1:05:22] unforgiveness when you can't forgive God

[1:06:51] a well respected man but he met a
[1:06:57] prophet by the name of Elijah not alike
[1:07:00] job he likes y'all
[1:07:02] and he like shock represents the bride
[1:07:04] of Jesus Christ and Elijah says navin in
[1:07:09] order to be cured

[1:10:57] and grand dude that would have gotten
[1:10:58] some attention from the people you would
[1:11:00] have done it why not do this hmmmm
[1:11:06] that's why a lot of time people didn't
[1:11:09] get their hearts to the Lord him to the
[1:11:10] churches fool they want everybody to see
[1:11:14] them come down the altar down to the
[1:11:16] altar you'll be amazed how people think
[1:11:20] when listen if anybody ever come to the
[1:11:23] altar time I giving their lives to
[1:11:25] Christ and you want people to see it you
[1:11:29] missed it you missed it it's not about

[1:12:33] at home worship him while we're driving
[1:12:36] our cars worship wherever we are worship
[1:12:40] the Lord just pray is that right the
[1:12:43] Bible says let everything that has
[1:12:46] breath praise the Lord and then he says
[1:12:48] praise ye the Lord that you got practice
[1:12:53] and praise ye the Lord you got a right
[1:12:56] to praise him even if you haven't got
[1:12:59] any breath see praise everything that
[1:13:06] has breath praise the Lord him and he
[1:13:09] says praise ye the Lord and see that's

[1:23:07] seen him us in you say well how come you
[1:23:10] say they're decent because before they
[1:23:12] came here there were somewhere else and
[1:23:15] I can tell you where they were the Bible
[1:23:17] said they were in the head the stars of
[1:23:20] God was in his hand whenever his hand is
[1:23:24] wherever it is that's where they were
[1:23:26] and that's where they went back to seven
[1:23:33] stars in his right hand come on whoo but
[1:23:42] where were you brother books I'll tell
[1:23:44] you where I was I was in the cleft of
[1:23:47] the rock I didn't know it at one time
[1:23:53] brother hitch but when they pierced him
[1:23:55] inside that was a clef that's what David
[1:24:01] said Lord hide me in the class of the
[1:24:03] rock hardly in the womb of Christ where
[1:24:09] the blood was shed I'd be there give me
[1:24:12] the revelation that I came from him and
[1:24:14] I'll go back to him I'm almost done
[1:24:19] because I'm gonna tell you something
[1:24:21] we'd better understand what I'm trying
[1:24:23] to say when everything comes down go go
[1:24:28] listen to the message Shalom 1964
[1:24:31] brother Baron say something's coming and
[1:24:33] he's telling us it's going to be rough
[1:24:35] he said that's the reason why I'm
[1:24:37] telling you alone because peace that
[1:24:39] mean peace to you because it's coming
[1:24:41] and you're gonna have to have some
[1:24:43] substance you gonna have to have
[1:24:45] something that's gonna be able to endure
[1:24:47] the storm that's coming he said it's
[1:24:49] gonna get so table it'll be just like
[1:24:52] that little girl he meant in the
[1:24:53] darkness got so dark she starts
[1:24:56] screaming and her little boy said
[1:24:58] don't worry little sister there's a man
[1:25:01] here who can turn on the light see he
[1:25:03] said listen listen what we don't
[1:25:05] understand when the scripture says in
[1:25:06] our patience possess he household that's
[1:25:09] exactly what's going to happen because
[1:25:11] when that Council of Churches begin to
[1:25:13] move and I'm gonna tell you something
[1:25:15] everybody look at that Trump and all the
[1:25:18] things that's going on let me tell you
[1:25:19] something you know why all of the
[1:25:21] staging is being made brother Brennan
[1:25:24] said is to come against the bride she's
[1:25:29] not even in the picture right now but in
[1:25:32] the mind of these demons she's in the
[1:25:35] picture they going around all about this
[1:25:38] here to put laws and everything in place
[1:25:41] so they can come after us you can
[1:25:45] believe it or not but it's coming
[1:25:46] he said you watch the history watch what
[1:25:49] God did throughout the age everything he
[1:25:51] said the same thing the devil did to
[1:25:54] Israel and what happened they trusted in
[1:25:58] their church instead of the voice
[1:26:01] because the voice told him when you see
[1:26:03] these city encamped about with soldier
[1:26:06] get up out of here but you know oh I'm
[1:26:08] in the message we gonna hide in the
[1:26:10] church and they die in the church you
[1:26:17] understand me escape down how do you
[1:26:22] escape

[1:26:25] amen like the brother saying don't be
[1:26:27] foolish
[1:26:28] yeah you're either wise on your foolish
[1:26:30] but the wise version had all and extra
[1:26:34] and how did you get that I had a prayer
[1:26:36] life I kept crying out to God even now
[1:26:40] the Bible says in Brisbane tells us and
[1:26:42] then those who sigh and cry for the
[1:26:45] abominations done in the city y'all
[1:26:47] think you're talking about are you out
[1:26:49] now in the church you are a city that
[1:26:53] sits upon a hill you're the city the
[1:26:59] prophet of God said God didn't come to
[1:27:00] shake the world this message didn't come
[1:27:02] to shake the world he said he said this
[1:27:04] message came to shake the church
[1:27:06] I'm not telling people they're not
[1:27:08] saying but you got to know what you
[1:27:10] possess him
[1:27:12] this message came us came to do what
[1:27:14] feel us with the divine nature of God
[1:27:18] don't you sell it for nothing less
[1:27:20] Paul said I Buffett my body every day I
[1:27:24] put it under subjection every day my
[1:27:27] body your body everybody's body is
[1:27:29] against the Word of God this flesh is
[1:27:32] the enemy that you have to fight every
[1:27:35] day I tell people if I didn't have this
[1:27:39] flesh I'll be perfect because of the
[1:27:42] inner man it's the flesh that brings me
[1:27:44] trouble every day
[1:27:45] it's the flesh that will allow the flesh
[1:27:47] and lust of the eye it's the flesh that
[1:27:49] want to lift itself up hallelujah but
[1:27:52] that intimate said homeboy is a new one
[1:27:55] here and I'm the man in control now see
[1:27:59] that's the inner man must come to a
[1:28:01] place it controls the body not that the
[1:28:04] body controls you you is that right
[1:28:07] I think I who was I talking to possess
[1:28:09] in the land you got to possess it but
[1:28:11] the key you got to possess the land you
[1:28:13] got to do the land in my last statement
[1:28:17] thought remember I said this the other
[1:28:20] night there is a replenishing I didn't
[1:28:25] finish it because Adam Commission was to
[1:28:28] multiply and replenish the earth and he
[1:28:30] failed because of sin but the second
[1:28:33] Adam his generation would be spiritual a
[1:28:36] quickening generation Oh God have mercy
[1:28:39] so you got to understand why a rapture
[1:28:42] must take place there must be a coming
[1:28:45] of a grand people see because what we
[1:28:47] fail to see is that we would have come
[1:28:51] into this world by spoken word and it
[1:28:56] would not have been babies babies came
[1:28:59] by the fall hello
[1:29:03] come on the creation when God created
[1:29:07] Adam and Eve he did not create them
[1:29:09] babies they were grown spoken word was
[1:29:14] not going while you think won't be no
[1:29:15] babies when you get there hello why
[1:29:20] won't babies be over there why when
[1:29:23] babies die and they
[1:29:25] go behind the curtain of time they're
[1:29:26] not 21 in 19 or whatever because that
[1:29:29] was the original plan and when god
[1:29:34] replenish the earth he's got to get rid
[1:29:36] of all the contamination that the first
[1:29:38] atom brought by way of seeing then God
[1:29:42] brings back the real sons of God when
[1:29:45] all evil is done away with they'll never
[1:29:49] ever ever again
[1:29:51] will be another tree of knowledge of
[1:29:52] good and evil ever it'll be the Tree of
[1:29:55] Life you said what do you mean look in
[1:29:57] the book of Genesis all you see is that
[1:29:59] real life you do not see the tree of
[1:30:02] knowledge good and evil it's not bad it
[1:30:05] was only placed in the Garden of Eden to
[1:30:09] serve God's purpose once the purpose is
[1:30:14] served God can now come back and
[1:30:17] replenish the earth because his word
[1:30:19] can't not come back on that right if
[1:30:24] Adam had stayed true he would have
[1:30:27] produced Jesus see y'all don't know that
[1:30:31] but it's true because he would have been
[1:30:35] see oh is that right brother Baron said
[1:30:37] all the seeds of adam's that's why he
[1:30:39] had to be a virgin because if Eve had
[1:30:41] remained a virgin if she had remained a
[1:30:44] virgin all the seeds that was in the
[1:30:47] first Adam would have come forth
[1:30:51] hello God had the job that's right
[1:30:54] because what happened when God when the
[1:30:57] devil allowed able to be killed guess
[1:30:59] work for the man said it was like a
[1:31:01] resurrection when he brought forth Seth
[1:31:04] but still self could not produce the
[1:31:07] Christ hello Mary couldn't produce the
[1:31:11] Christ Joseph couldn't produce the
[1:31:12] Christ only God could produce the Christ
[1:31:15] he needed a virgin and he needed none of
[1:31:18] Mary genes or none of Adam's genes he
[1:31:21] had to come by way of creation and guess
[1:31:24] what the very voice of God had to create
[1:31:28] the egg and the seed in their spoken
[1:31:31] word
[1:31:35] okay
[1:31:37] yes sir you love the Lord that's how God
[1:31:40] gonna replenish he replenish the
[1:31:46] redeemed
[1:31:48] that means you was here before him he
[1:31:50] replenished the world with redeem seed
[1:31:57] somebody ought to shout let's stay in
[1:32:06] joint Jesus I am enjoying Jesus you know
[1:32:10] I look and i'ma tell you something how
[1:32:12] can I say this I'm marvel and I'm sure I
[1:32:18] have gone haven't going through some
[1:32:20] storm maybe you may have gone through
[1:32:22] worse trials and storms that I have but
[1:32:26] I'm gonna tell you something God has
[1:32:28] done a perfect job with me oh we
[1:32:39] couldn't have done no better and I'm
[1:32:42] still not what I will be father does not
[1:32:47] yet appear what we shall be but when he
[1:32:50] shall appear we'll be like it just like
[1:32:53] it don't you want to be just like him
[1:32:56] I'm so glad it's not in my hands I'm so
[1:32:59] glad that that that God predestinated me
[1:33:03] I don't know how to explain it he never
[1:33:06] made me do anything it was by my choice
[1:33:11] but I thank God I don't know all I know
[1:33:14] is that I love holiness and I love
[1:33:18] righteousness and I love when I read
[1:33:21] this Bible I read it and and I just love
[1:33:23] it it's the stories and the things in
[1:33:26] here they never get dead and boring they
[1:33:29] always live I look at characters in this
[1:33:33] Bible and I think oh I just wish I could
[1:33:35] be just like them but the man that I
[1:33:38] want to be like most of all is Jesus
[1:33:40] himself because Joshua was just a piece
[1:33:43] of him Moses was just a piece of him
[1:33:45] David was a piece of him but Jesus
[1:33:48] Christ was all of him
[1:33:50] and to think that we've got him inside
[1:33:54] of us moving and growing and maturing
[1:33:56] amen into this Christ I am so excited
[1:33:59] it's like a a woman who's pregnant right
[1:34:04] she doesn't had that baby for about
[1:34:06] three months all of a sudden he started
[1:34:08] kicking she get excited come feel come
[1:34:10] on and feel it you gotta hear you gotta
[1:34:16] feel him kicking every now and again now
[1:34:18] the only girls moving in you it has to
[1:34:21] move in you for you to feel it for you
[1:34:23] to know he's living you got to see some
[1:34:25] shine
[1:34:26] he's living you can't be like Elizabeth
[1:34:31] I've been pregnant so long and he said
[1:34:32] made a move no sod that's not good you
[1:34:36] need to call in the name of Jesus the
[1:34:38] Bible said at the name of Jesus amen
[1:34:41] John came to life I tell you what maybe
[1:34:48] I'm a crazy man
[1:34:50] but one thing I know is that what I'm
[1:34:53] seeing and I'll say this and you don't
[1:34:56] have to believe it but I was in prayer
[1:34:59] right here in church by myself I can't
[1:35:03] even remember what I was praying but I
[1:35:05] was just praying praying just praying
[1:35:07] sighing and crying I do know that not
[1:35:11] just for myself but for others and all
[1:35:14] of a sudden I saw all of these people I
[1:35:26] didn't see the
[1:35:37] it was they were just standing like they
[1:35:43] was waiting for something we tell you
[1:35:47] it's more to this message than what
[1:35:49] people think all I could scream at it
[1:35:54] was that I see him oh I see
[1:36:00] they waiting one word from him and it'll
[1:36:06] be all over that was just something he
[1:36:10] gave me I know that we don't we're not
[1:36:15] far and you don't understand but I said
[1:36:19] like this I just want to hear him say
[1:36:21] well done we get tired we get weary but
[1:36:28] just like Jesus the Bible said that
[1:36:32] Jesus was acquainted with grief hard
[1:36:38] disappointments heartbreaks it comes
[1:36:43] with the package
[1:36:46] but it's okay when you know who you are
[1:37:02] Oh God trying to get the people to see
[1:37:09] and God sent a man all the way from Ohio
[1:37:13] tell us that we need to be more
[1:37:21] determined to produce Christ in us I am
[1:37:30] able to lose all my friends whatever
[1:37:39] this one boy who is determined to make a
[1:37:45] rapture I came to this message because
[1:37:46] in 1977 I saw what I call UFOs and I
[1:37:53] remember screaming right in the middle
[1:37:54] of the street lord whatever you do don't
[1:37:57] let me miss the rapture at that time I
[1:38:01] knew nothing about this message it's
[1:38:03] just so many little places God had
[1:38:05] stopped me and made me pay attention to
[1:38:07] things and I know it's because of Who I
[1:38:10] am
[1:38:11] I didn't make me who I am he made me who
[1:38:13] I am
[1:38:17] I've tried to tell people even in my
[1:38:21] earlier stage of ministry what you see
[1:38:23] things and and I told the Lord I says
[1:38:25] lord I want to produce what your message
[1:38:28] say I'm supposed to reduce I don't care
[1:38:31] about all these other teachers that have
[1:38:33] come and gone and make every for you
[1:38:36] justified as though you've never sinned
[1:38:37] in the first place and don't tell the
[1:38:39] people they still got to clean up their
[1:38:40] lives you've gotta have a clean life you
[1:38:44] gotta have a clean life God will see
[1:38:48] action
[1:38:49] what's it used to buying bleach if it
[1:38:51] can't wash or clean right why does the
[1:38:56] blood is a bleach you mean to tell me
[1:38:58] the bleach of Christ the blood of Christ
[1:39:00] came wash away all your sins no it
[1:39:04] washes everything he gets a rake get rid
[1:39:06] of every stain everything I trust in the
[1:39:11] blood of Jesus cuz that's all I have
[1:39:13] Oh Lord
[1:39:16] I know I'm a crybaby I can't help it
[1:39:21] every time I think about how good he's
[1:39:23] been to me and just to see how things
[1:39:29] are maybe I'm not explaining it like
[1:39:31] everybody else can explain it but I do
[1:39:33] know one thing
[1:39:34] God didn't drop the divine nature in our
[1:39:37] list and I'll out for us to sit there
[1:39:40] and watching it observe it break it down
[1:39:42] and dissect it
[1:39:43] no he wants to see it live the purpose
[1:39:47] of the blood of Jesus Christ is to see
[1:39:49] it live right hallelujah when Abel died
[1:39:54] that layer gave him a right after death
[1:39:59] to speak the Bible said the blood of
[1:40:02] Abel spoke still living and the blood of
[1:40:07] Jesus Christ was greater than in Abel
[1:40:09] must still speak through human vessels
[1:40:13] it must prove it's ears the blood it
[1:40:16] lives through us that's the way he chose
[1:40:19] it to be that's one thing I love about
[1:40:22] God you know we need predestinated us
[1:40:25] what he brought us to this place and I'm
[1:40:26] almost done good or evil he came and he
[1:40:31] suffered at all he made a right he's a
[1:40:33] just God and he gives everybody the
[1:40:36] right to choose whatever way they want
[1:40:38] to go he can't help he's God he's God
[1:40:40] and he knows everything he understands
[1:40:43] everything but one thing I know there'll
[1:40:47] never be an excuse because God has given
[1:40:51] us everything if every man in this world
[1:40:54] he has given us all we need like Jesse
[1:40:57] said whosoever will let him come he's
[1:40:59] given us everything we need to make
[1:41:02] heaven with most of all he's given us
[1:41:06] his life and brother brought him in this
[1:41:09] closing statement said he's more willing
[1:41:12] to give us a Holy Ghost then we desire
[1:41:15] to have
