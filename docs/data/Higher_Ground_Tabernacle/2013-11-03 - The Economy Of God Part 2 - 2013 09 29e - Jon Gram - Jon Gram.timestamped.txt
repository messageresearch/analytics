[1:03] received Lord father we all need to get
[1:05] out of the way no doubt there's Spirits

[1:19] whatever there might have been Lord help
[1:21] us Lord Jesus we confess it just now
[1:23] Lord we need you Lord so help us I pray
[1:26] Lord let us not lean unto our own
[1:28] understanding Lord
[1:30] but lean on to your word in Jesus
[1:32] Christ's name we thank you
[1:35] Lord Psalms 127 let's please go
[1:39] there
[1:46] amen Psalms 127 we'll read that one
[1:49] again verse one
[2:05] except the Lord build the house they
[2:08] labor in vain that build it except the
[2:11] Lord keep the city The
[2:13] Watchmen waketh but in
[2:16] vain praise the
[2:18] Lord yes
[2:21] sir so let's pick up kind where we left
[2:23] off we were talking a little bit about
[2:25] and you can be seated there if you'd
[2:26] like sorry about that but we were
[2:27] talking about how that the economy of
[2:30] God and how that it's the wealth and the
[2:32] riches of the nation of the of you know
[2:34] of the of the entity that's the economy
[2:36] you know we're all workers in that
[2:38] economy we all have responsibilities in
[2:40] this economy amen amen and there's many
[2:42] economies that you know you have Satan's
[2:44] economy and you have God's economy going
[2:46] on so we must make a
[2:48] choice a conscious choice of where we're
[2:51] going to be putting our resources how
[2:53] we're going to be working what what kind
[2:55] of goods are you going to produce right
[2:57] amen amen and remember eternal life is
[2:59] living for others right so to me you
[3:02] know working in this economy of God has
[3:04] a lot to do with service to others
[3:06] adding value to other people's lives
[3:08] making their lives more valuable right
[3:11] that's what an economy does you build
[3:13] value in this economy economies that do
[3:15] not build value are not valuable right
[3:18] look at the economies of other nations
[3:20] look how poor they are it's because they
[3:22] don't produce anything it's a vain false
[3:25] economy right amen and that's where we
[3:27] learn that the United States of America
[3:30] the the natural types of spiritual we
[3:32] were a manufacturing Powerhouse our
[3:34] goods and services out stripped
[3:36] everybody else in the world Amen and it
[3:38] was because we had that spiritual
[3:40] economy first amen
[3:42] amen absolutely
[3:45] amen so let's go back into this here how
[3:47] that God his attributes are expressed in
[3:51] his economy amen we said that and let me
[3:53] just read this here how that God it's
[3:57] like a bottle let's just put it that way
[3:59] way God is eternal right I know you're
[4:02] not going to bot up God but put it this
[4:04] way if something's Eternal it's
[4:05] constantly building pressure right has
[4:07] Eternal pressure so if this container
[4:09] has Eternal pressure inside of it and it
[4:11] doesn't vent out what's going to
[4:14] happen yeah you're gonna have a real
[4:16] mess there so God has to have this vent
[4:19] Amen to express his attributes it's got
[4:22] to happen so he created this economy so
[4:24] it could happen so that we talked about
[4:25] this exchange of your currency of Faith
[4:28] right so that you could exchange it with
[4:30] God's attributes right aren't you
[4:32] married to God if you have the Holy
[4:34] Spirit you're married to God Amen that's
[4:36] why it's so important to receive the
[4:38] Holy Spirit you got to have that
[4:40] marriage for as we said Jesus he's the
[4:42] door right the way the truth and life so
[4:44] that's how you get into his spiritual
[4:46] economy marry his Spirit right right
[4:48] there it's opened up then it all starts
[4:50] you're in his economy amen amen and you
[4:53] can be workers with him
[4:55] amen yes sir acts 20:28 take heed
[5:00] therefore unto yourselves and unto all
[5:02] the flock over which the Holy Ghost hath
[5:04] made you overseers to feed the church
[5:06] with he had purchased with his own
[5:10] blood yes sir so we were certainly
[5:13] bought with a high price amen let me ask
[5:16] you a question
[5:17] here how valuable is God's
[5:21] blood can anyone put a price on it I
[5:24] mean we're talking about God's blood
[5:25] here not John Graham's blood you know
[5:27] that Lord knows how many times I spilled
[5:29] in a floor because of my own foolishness
[5:31] right accidents and things right that
[5:33] was worthless they just cleaned it up
[5:34] put powder over whatever more and
[5:36] cleaned it up they didn't regard it much
[5:37] at all but oh the blood of God can you
[5:40] imagine the blood of God like brother
[5:41] Brandon would say you know at the cross
[5:43] when the blood of God came on the ground
[5:45] if we had a little portion of that just
[5:46] a little mustard grain seed size drop of
[5:53] blood okay now we've established
[5:57] that let me read this first Cor thians
[6:00] 6:19 what know ye not your body is the
[6:03] Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you
[6:04] which you have of God and you're not
[6:05] your own for you're bought with a price
[6:07] therefore glorify God in your body and
[6:09] your spirit which are Gods okay so now
[6:11] we're Gods right amen his blood is
[6:13] priceless we're Gods you're bought with
[6:16] a price in 1 Corinthians 7 do not be
[6:18] Servants of men verse 23 says that so if
[6:23] I understand the natural economy
[6:25] correctly uh brother Randy if I go out
[6:27] and buy a car and the car is worth
[6:30] $113,000 and I pay the $133,000 how much
[6:33] is the car worth
[6:37] $133,000 so what I bought was worth what
[6:40] I paid for otherwise I wouldn't have
[6:42] paid for it I wouldn't give that much
[6:43] money right you ever have somebody try
[6:45] to overcharge you for something if I
[6:46] walk up to this $1 13,000 car and the
[6:48] dealership says hey you got to pay me
[6:50] 20,000 no that car is only worth 13,000
[6:53] that's all I'm going to pay you right
[6:56] okay so God's blood is priceless he
[6:59] bought us so we are Priceless
[7:04] amen that's right amen you see that's a
[7:07] simple example but I thought that was
[7:09] powerful you are Priceless in this
[7:11] economy of God amen amen hallu praise
[7:15] the Lord that Holy Spirit receiving it
[7:17] is a confirmation that he bought you
[7:19] amen receive the holy spirit amen I just
[7:22] that's a major I just can't no we can't
[7:24] stress that enough can we we can't I say
[7:26] it a lot but we cannot stress it enough
[7:28] it is the major amen amen people try to
[7:32] Major on many other things other you
[7:34] know strange doctrines and other maybe
[7:35] things that are trying to be so deep but
[7:37] it's that simple receive the Holy Spirit
[7:39] am that's it that's the major that's the
[7:42] whole point amen without that all this
[7:44] would be pointless that's right amen
[7:47] amen so now that we've established the
[7:49] value of your soul yourself right your
[7:51] very person you are Priceless
[7:55] amen 1 Peter 3:4 says but let it be the
[7:58] hidden man of the heart which is that
[8:00] which is not corruptible even the
[8:01] ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit
[8:02] which in the sight of God is a great
[8:04] price yeah so he that's why he bought
[8:06] you because in his sight you were a
[8:07] great price amen amen praise the
[8:11] Lord praise the Lord Matthew 10:29 says
[8:14] you're more valuable than The Sparrows
[8:16] right more valuable than the creation
[8:18] what I'm more valuable than those big
[8:20] Majestic mountains sir look how
[8:23] beautiful those things are I mean how
[8:25] about way out there in Colorado right I
[8:28] mean I've never been out there but I've
[8:29] seen
[8:31] pictures yeah so we are more valuable
[8:34] than that
[8:36] amen Proverbs
[8:39] 138 The Ransom of a man's life are his
[8:42] riches but the poor heareth no rebuke so
[8:46] in other words a man what can a man will
[8:48] exchange all of his wealth for his soul
[8:51] right if it come down to it brother
[8:53] Keith you had a choice take all pay all
[8:56] your riches out empty your bank account
[8:58] or go to to
[9:00] hell that's that's not a really hard
[9:02] choice is
[9:04] it yeah it's not very not too difficult
[9:07] no it wouldn't take you too long to make
[9:08] that
[9:09] decision not much delay there you know
[9:11] you wouldn't be like oh let me go pray
[9:12] about it right I mean right now you know
[9:15] exactly what you do
[9:17] amen praise the Lord so don't let Satan
[9:21] trick you he tries to trick you that
[9:23] you're not of much
[9:24] value he does he really does try what
[9:29] what what does he do he tries to make
[9:31] you compare yourself to others he try he
[9:34] tries to make you compare yourself to
[9:36] many other things oh I'm not an I'm not
[9:38] adequate or that brother has this
[9:39] characteristic that you know I don't
[9:41] have or that preacher you know I'm
[9:44] telling you he battles us he battles us
[9:47] don't let him battle you all you got to
[9:48] do is say you know hey God bought me
[9:51] with his blood Priceless that means I'm
[9:53] Priceless that's it I mean you don't
[9:56] have to reason with him it's just that
[9:57] simple amen yes don't a reason with the
[10:00] devil
[10:01] amen praise the
[10:04] Lord
[10:05] amen we all know the scriptures in
[10:07] Matthew 13:18 how that it talks about uh
[10:10] you know returning 30 and 60 and
[10:12] hundredfold you know we want we want to
[10:14] return as much value as we possibly can
[10:16] to the kingdom that's got to be our
[10:18] focus of our life we've got to return we
[10:20] got to work in this economy that's what
[10:22] it's about as we said in the beginning
[10:23] you're producing goods and services and
[10:25] you're and actually what it does is it
[10:27] goes back into this economy and makes it
[10:28] more rich so in other words if you're
[10:30] coming on this Earth and you leave this
[10:32] earth and it's not uh you know the
[10:34] economy of God was not more made
[10:35] enriched by you than you didn't do your
[10:38] job you weren't a very good worker right
[10:41] you probably tried to as we talked about
[10:43] this morning you probably tried to tell
[10:44] your Foreman what to do you probably try
[10:46] to tell him how to interpret the
[10:47] blueprints and how to do the job right
[10:49] the standard work that was made up for
[10:50] the job the you know the work
[10:51] instructions you probably tried to type
[10:53] them out yourself right don't do that
[10:56] amen you won't return any value if you
[10:58] do that
[10:59] follow his instructions black and white
[11:01] in the word amen sir yes sir because we
[11:04] look at many people and don't get
[11:05] discouraged but God has different you
[11:06] know we brother brandham talked about it
[11:08] many different things how we see that
[11:09] you know Abraham was a silver dollar and
[11:11] you know different you know lot was a
[11:12] different currency mightbe I forget what
[11:14] he said a nickel or 5 Cent or something
[11:16] 10 cents I forget but nonetheless there
[11:18] are all different there's all different
[11:19] amounts and currencies in this economy
[11:22] you as far as your value return so don't
[11:24] be comparing to somebody else because
[11:25] somebody else might have got five
[11:26] talents you might have got two it
[11:28] doesn't matter just return return that
[11:30] value try your best to return as much on
[11:32] investment as you can
[11:34] amen
[11:36] amen praise the Lord I mean you look at
[11:38] that boy that fed you know that brought
[11:40] that that bread and that fish to Jesus
[11:42] and and brought it up there and he said
[11:44] you know he's looking around these
[11:45] thousands of people and this little boy
[11:46] comes up they're all wondering how are
[11:47] we going to feed these people this
[11:49] little boy this is all I have yeah just
[11:51] a couple fishes and right what I mean
[11:54] look at that what if that boy would have
[11:56] said oh I don't have much I'm not going
[11:57] to invest
[11:59] you know I'm I'm not going to give it to
[12:00] Jesus give what you have to Jesus right
[12:04] he'll cause it to return far more than
[12:06] you can ever imagine he will amen yes
[12:10] sir don't you worry about it
[12:13] amen now what if uh you know let's all
[12:16] go kind of a little story here imagine
[12:17] this imagine you're sleeping in your bed
[12:19] at night and uh uh you know a robber
[12:22] breaks into your
[12:24] house okay a robber breaks through your
[12:27] window you hear this loud crash you and
[12:29] your wife are in your bed your children
[12:30] are all sleeping right it's in the
[12:31] middle of the night there's no police to
[12:33] help you there's nobody around that's
[12:34] going to help you right so this robber
[12:36] breaks
[12:37] in all right once you realize what's
[12:40] going on you start to you know you start
[12:41] to Adrenaline going on you know
[12:43] different different things are going on
[12:44] in your mind and your head what are you
[12:46] going to do this man is probably crazy
[12:49] he's out to get money at whatever cost
[12:50] he's on a drug fix he's got to satisfy
[12:53] that lust of the flesh you know how
[12:55] strong that can be he's just out of his
[12:58] mind what are you going to do well
[13:01] you're probably going to protect your
[13:03] family you're probably going to protect
[13:05] your economy your little wealth there
[13:08] you have your health your Wellness your
[13:09] family you know all that you're going to
[13:11] protect it and what happens do you have
[13:12] to think about it do you have to go back
[13:14] over here and really think about oh what
[13:16] am I going to do you know and maybe pray
[13:17] about it no you're in if that man breaks
[13:20] in your house and tries to hurt you or
[13:21] your children or kill your family
[13:23] members you're going to instinctively
[13:25] protect your wealth amen your economy
[13:28] amen do you know where we got that from
[13:31] our
[13:36] father here's some scriptures he goes
[13:38] before us in 2 Samuel 5:24 the Lord
[13:41] fights for us in 2 Chronicles 328 the
[13:43] battle was the Lord's 1 Samuel 17:47 the
[13:46] Lord strengthens us in five Amos 58 the
[13:49] Lord is a man of war in Exodus 15:3
[13:52] right the Lord is a jealous God Exodus
[13:55] 34:14 he protects his property I mean
[13:58] this is what it's about out when he
[14:00] comes out and he all the time children
[14:01] of Israel are fighting and and they have
[14:02] enemies and they're starting to maybe
[14:04] Prevail over them or whatever more God
[14:05] comes out and smites them he strikes
[14:06] them why because Israel is his economy
[14:09] that's his wealth that's his people
[14:11] you're his people too there's no
[14:13] exception amen so we inherited that
[14:15] trait from our father that instinctive
[14:18] trait right there we don't think about
[14:20] it amen so you're going to protect your
[14:23] economy when the devil attacks it so the
[14:25] spiritual is no different that natural
[14:27] types of spiritual we ought to be
[14:29] protecting this spiritual economy that
[14:31] God has given us that we are in that we
[14:33] are we are fighting and battling in
[14:35] don't be ashamed of it protect it amen
[14:37] amen Give It All you have to protect it
[14:40] yes
[14:41] sir amen I like the story here I want
[14:45] another story of Arnold Von
[14:47] winkd right how brother brandom laid out
[14:50] this beautiful
[14:53] story of this man
[14:56] Arnold uh that you know
[14:59] the Swiss people were under
[15:01] attack and brother Brenham let me go
[15:03] down to it here it says that uh you know
[15:05] their their
[15:06] economy
[15:09] was threatened they knew that if they
[15:12] lost this battle these people coming
[15:13] into their house right into their
[15:15] country into their economy and they know
[15:17] that if they lost this battle their
[15:19] wives will be ravaged their children
[15:21] will be killed their wealth would be
[15:22] taken right their homes would be
[15:23] confiscated burned to the ground
[15:25] whatever more they knew that so
[15:29] this man went out and
[15:32] said I know what to do men and Brethren
[15:35] follow me he instinctively took the lead
[15:39] role to protect his country and his
[15:43] family right he didn't hesitate didn't
[15:45] say in here well let me go let me think
[15:46] about this or what am I going to you
[15:47] know he just he knew exactly he was an
[15:49] inspiration he jumped out there and he
[15:51] said men and Brethren follow me and
[15:54] fight with all you have amen amen now
[15:58] we'll get to this but this is the type
[16:00] of somebody that did the same thing he
[16:02] come down to this earth and he said men
[16:05] and
[16:06] Brethren follow me amen fight with all
[16:10] you have in this economy amen amen let
[16:13] me show you the way so our uh this uh
[16:17] man Arnold he he took this opportunity
[16:20] this huge vast army they had no chance
[16:22] and he and he just started screaming and
[16:24] running and yelling and ran right into
[16:26] that Army and all his other countrymen
[16:28] was following him and what he did was he
[16:30] gave his own life he jumped on all those
[16:32] Spears brother brandom said he brought
[16:34] them towards his chest and jumped into
[16:35] them and it caused such a confusion
[16:38] these people had no idea what was going
[16:40] on they could not believe that somebody
[16:41] would give their own life like this they
[16:43] had they had no clue they were so
[16:45] bewildered and the rest of the
[16:47] countrymen come along and beat them out
[16:48] of the country they took advantage of
[16:50] the situation the advantage that Arnold
[16:53] brought to his people all they had to do
[16:56] was take advantage of it it was an easy
[16:57] Victory because Arnold had already done
[16:59] all the work so you see Christ Our type
[17:03] has already done all the work amen yes
[17:06] he has he's already done it all he's
[17:08] come and he's opened the door for you
[17:11] the door is open you just got to walk
[17:12] through it receive ye his spirit and
[17:14] walk through the door amen he's already
[17:17] defeated the devil yeah he's given his
[17:19] own life amen we've got to take
[17:22] advantage that don't let this spoil and
[17:24] go to waste as we said this morning now
[17:26] is the time today is the day of
[17:28] salvation right
[17:30] now is the time to sharpen your
[17:31] character now is the time to improve and
[17:33] get the filth and the junk out the
[17:35] desires of the economy for Satan get it
[17:37] out amen the cares of the world whatever
[17:40] more lust and and selfishness and
[17:42] whatever you might have get it out you
[17:44] cannot be perfected with that in there
[17:46] get it out of there amen it's such a
[17:48] process take advantage of what our Lord
[17:49] and savior has done
[17:52] amen praise the Lord so a worker let's
[17:55] look at worker here is a person or
[17:56] animal that works in particular an
[17:58] employ employee so you're an employee
[18:01] you're going to be employed under some
[18:02] economy right you're going to work for
[18:05] somebody also a person who produces or
[18:08] achieves a specific
[18:10] thing interesting so look at this
[18:13] definition of work work is an activity
[18:16] involving mental or physical effort
[18:20] done in order to achieve a purpose or a
[18:26] result amen I like this one here the
[18:29] exertion of a force overcoming
[18:32] resistance or producing molecular
[18:36] change amen are you looking for your
[18:38] molecular change amen yes sir that's
[18:42] what we're working for amen he'll do the
[18:44] work he will that final work will be
[18:46] done by him amen boy that's good I
[18:49] didn't see that in
[18:51] there amen yes sir so we're overcoming
[18:55] resistance that word over overcome let's
[18:58] look at that St John
[19:00] 16:33 these things and this is exactly
[19:03] what we're talking about our Lord and
[19:04] savior has come and he has said these
[19:06] things in St John
[19:08] 16:33 these things I have spoken to you
[19:11] that in me you might have peace
[19:15] Amen in me you might have peace amen
[19:21] so in the world ye shall have
[19:25] tribulation be but be of good cheer I
[19:27] have overcome the world
[19:32] overcome the world so he has come like
[19:34] that example we said of Arnold he is
[19:36] come and he has taken advantage of Satan
[19:39] and he has passed that advantage on to
[19:40] us and he has overcome that economy
[19:43] right there that that that that giant
[19:46] that Satan has produced he's overcome
[19:49] it amen look at this definition of
[19:52] overcome now we need to meet this
[19:54] definition because Jesus said right
[19:55] there be of good cheer I have overcome
[19:57] the world we're following his lead right
[19:59] so you got to meet this definition right
[20:01] here it means to defeat beat conquer
[20:03] trce trout Vanquish overwhelm over power
[20:07] get the better of triumph over Prevail
[20:08] over win over against outdo out class
[20:12] worse than
[20:13] Crush amen do you meet that definition
[20:17] you ought to if you don't it's your own
[20:19] fault get out of his way cuz he's
[20:21] already done that all you got to do is
[20:23] accept it amen yes sir keep pressing
[20:26] forward don't be discouraged now I don't
[20:28] say that to discourage you I say that to
[20:30] encourage you because you know what he's
[20:32] already done am all you got to do is
[20:34] follow his lead with all you got all
[20:37] your might
[20:39] amen amen yes sir praise the Lord as we
[20:44] move forward here we gotta speed up a
[20:45] little bit here
[20:48] amen Satan don't like this that's why I
[20:50] I was going to go a different way and
[20:52] preach something else but I thought he
[20:53] just didn't like this he he fought too
[20:55] hard and that gave me a clue I'm
[20:57] learning okay I'm
[20:59] learning you know have have mercy on me
[21:02] I'm learning so so God got us back on
[21:04] track I believe it
[21:05] amen all right everybody knows what a
[21:07] mortgage is right is there who has a
[21:10] mortgage raise your hand anybody here
[21:12] has a
[21:13] mortgage only one person two two people
[21:16] have morgage that's it wow you lucky
[21:19] people are
[21:21] lucky
[21:23] amen okay so let's go through this a
[21:25] little bit I thought there'd be more
[21:26] hands but uh you know you get into that
[21:28] mortgage you think it'll take 30 years
[21:29] to pay off and you're oh that's a big
[21:31] giant isn't it you know you think that
[21:32] way but God will have his way he'll help
[21:34] you all right so a
[21:36] mortgage because remember in Proverbs
[21:38] 22:7 says the rich ruleth over the poor
[21:41] and the borrower is Ser borrower is
[21:43] servant to the lender oh my you hear
[21:47] that so you know that mortgage you have
[21:49] you're a servant of that bank until it's
[21:50] paid
[21:53] off Romans 6:16 know ye not that whom
[21:56] you yield your servants your servants to
[21:59] obey rather his servants you are to whom
[22:02] you obey whether it is sin unto death or
[22:05] obedience unto righteousness so we're
[22:08] going to take a mortgage out whether you
[22:10] have one or not right now in the natural
[22:11] you you have to take one out in the
[22:13] spiritual amen you have to and I'll tell
[22:17] you why here in a minute so you got to
[22:19] be careful who you want to take it out
[22:20] with which bank you want to take it with
[22:23] they have completely different
[22:26] terms they do they're totally different
[22:29] the One Bank tries to look like the
[22:31] other bank tries to copy the same terms
[22:33] but really the fine print is just way
[22:36] different remember we talked about that
[22:38] false economy I try he transforms
[22:41] himself into an Android light yeah
[22:44] amen
[22:46] so a mortgage loan is a loan secured by
[22:50] real property through the use of
[22:51] mortgage note which evidences the
[22:54] existence of a loan and encumbrance of
[22:57] that reality through the granted
[22:58] mortgage which cures a loan so that's
[23:01] kind of wordy but that's why the title
[23:03] deed that we have to get right we we
[23:05] know a lot about that got to get that
[23:07] Holy Spirit that seal until the day of
[23:09] your Redemption to prove your mortgage
[23:11] right to prove your mortgage is with
[23:15] God Amen because the mortgage is going
[23:17] to be for your soul one way or the other
[23:19] I mean you got you have to our our our
[23:20] debt load was so heavy it was so deep
[23:23] that we had to take a mortgage out to
[23:25] take care of it had to and there was one
[23:28] who established a bank on this Earth for
[23:30] you am amen right that could pay for
[23:33] your
[23:35] debt yeah he can so let's see this
[23:38] hereall so the mortgage is on your soul
[23:40] and Christ secured your loan as a
[23:42] co-signer with his own blood amen he did
[23:45] he he you had to borrow money from God
[23:47] right and I his terms are very favorable
[23:50] the word mortgagees is from a French law
[23:52] term meaning death contract isn't that
[23:55] something it means death contract
[23:57] meaning that the pledge ends or dies
[23:59] when either of the obligation is
[24:01] fulfilled or the property is taken
[24:03] through
[24:04] foreclosure so if you go with the other
[24:07] bank you're probably going to go into
[24:08] foreclosure go with the economy of God
[24:10] in his bank and you'll surely lead to
[24:12] life he'll pay it's already paid for as
[24:13] a matter of fact right you just got to
[24:15] live it out amen you got to live through
[24:17] the trials and the tests and get through
[24:18] it all and it's already done paid for
[24:20] see the other bank the bank of Satan's
[24:22] economy you know he wants to he wants to
[24:23] make you think it's paid for because oh
[24:25] you can feel so comfortable under his
[24:26] bank all the all the pleasures of the
[24:28] world and things you can buy the
[24:29] luxuries you can have right and you just
[24:31] live so luxuriously right just like that
[24:34] rich man right in Lazarus he lives so
[24:36] luxuriously but where didd he find
[24:37] himself and where the where' the poor
[24:39] beggar find himself Lazarus right so you
[24:42] know that's exact same scenario Lazarus
[24:44] he took a mortgage out with God right
[24:46] the Lord God and the rich man took a
[24:48] mortgage out with Satan he did so they
[24:52] got exactly what the mortgage said
[24:53] they'd get right that's what the that's
[24:55] what the fine print said in Satan's
[24:57] contract he just didn't read it
[24:59] carefully
[25:00] enough yes sir so foreclosure is the
[25:03] process of taking possession of a
[25:05] mortgage property as a result of the
[25:07] mortgage failure to keep up the mortgage
[25:10] payments that's what you get when you go
[25:12] with Satan's Bank the bank of Satan
[25:14] right yeah yep few individuals have
[25:17] enough savings or liquid funds to enable
[25:20] them to purchase property
[25:21] outright that's why you got to get a
[25:23] mortgage amen so I thought that was a
[25:25] good illustration right you're all going
[25:27] to take a mortgage out what bank are you
[25:30] going to go
[25:33] with yes sir First Corinthians 10:24
[25:37] says let no man seek his own but every
[25:40] man another's
[25:42] wealth no that isn't saying go steal
[25:45] from other people no that isn't saying
[25:47] seek out somebody else's wealth and take
[25:49] it right what that's saying is look out
[25:52] for your brother in his wealth make sure
[25:55] that he is taken care of right naturally
[25:58] and spiritually there's no exceptions or
[26:00] exemptions in this contract of the bank
[26:03] of God right there isn't it says right
[26:06] there that's part of the agreement you
[26:08] have the Holy Spirit you'll do that amen
[26:10] right you'll do it because that's his
[26:12] desire you take care of your brother
[26:15] right what did Cain say to to the Lord
[26:17] God am I My Brother's Keeper and look at
[26:20] his end look what happened to him he
[26:22] didn't want to be his brother's keeper
[26:24] he didn't think he had to be of course
[26:25] he didn't because it wasn't in his
[26:27] contract right right the contract he had
[26:29] had nothing about that in
[26:32] there but it was the contract he chose
[26:35] right to be banished from the sight of
[26:36] God right he even said it himself my
[26:39] burden is greater than I can bear that's
[26:41] what out of his own mouth but he done
[26:43] too late he already signed the contract
[26:45] so be careful where you sign
[26:50] amen yes sir James 214 let's just James
[26:53] chapter 2 I'll skip around on there
[26:55] verse 15 if a brother or sister be naked
[26:57] or destitute of daily food and one of
[26:59] you saying them depart in peace be
[27:01] warmed and filled notwithstanding you
[27:02] give them not the things which they're
[27:04] needful to the body what does it
[27:06] profit verse 20 but wilt thou know oh
[27:09] vain man that faith without works is
[27:12] dead so if you say be wared and filled
[27:14] but don't give nothing that means you
[27:15] don't have any faith you don't have the
[27:17] currency of God that you need to pay for
[27:19] that right it doesn't mean that faith is
[27:21] dead it doesn't mean that it doesn't
[27:23] work it just means you don't have it if
[27:25] that's what you say to somebody you see
[27:27] they have a need and you don't meet that
[27:28] need your faith is dead because you
[27:30] don't trust God will help you provide
[27:31] that money to him you think oh well I
[27:33] can't do that because I don't have
[27:34] enough money or I don't have enough of
[27:36] this or that or the other or time or
[27:37] resources or whatever more that brother
[27:39] needs your help help him in any way that
[27:42] you can otherwise faith without works is
[27:46] dead completely dead am you have no
[27:50] faith praise the Lord amen the Lord God
[27:53] wants us to enjoy this economy through
[27:56] relationships doesn't he isn't he a
[27:58] relational God isn't that what he wants
[28:01] how often do we try to just stick to the
[28:03] numbers and try to play a numbers game
[28:04] with him he wants you he wants you not
[28:09] your not necessarily your works we do
[28:11] these things because we're saved we have
[28:12] works because we're saved right not to
[28:15] be saved so quit playing the numbers
[28:17] game have a relationship with him amen
[28:20] what if I ran a company what if I was a
[28:22] business owner and I ran a company and I
[28:23] never wanted to have any relationship
[28:25] with any of my customers right and my
[28:27] suppliers didn't talk to them didn't
[28:29] care about them treat them like dirt all
[28:31] I cared about was money or was the
[28:33] numbers or meeting the the monthly
[28:35] quarterly goals whatever what if that's
[28:37] all I cared about how well would my
[28:38] business
[28:40] run without relationships it's going to
[28:43] crash think about that examine your life
[28:46] with that because I think I'm guilty of
[28:48] it I know we probably all are
[28:51] right
[28:54] amen praise the Lord so we are
[28:57] responsible that's another point that we
[28:58] need to make in this economy of God
[29:00] we're definitely
[29:01] responsible we are responsible let's all
[29:04] say it together we are responsible we
[29:07] are it sounds kind of it might uh feel
[29:10] kind of funny to some of you saying that
[29:12] but it's true we don't say that enough
[29:15] how often do we get into a fix or a
[29:17] problem and we try to blame everybody
[29:19] else but us or we try to examine
[29:21] everybody else's fault you know all the
[29:23] problems I've ever seen in this world
[29:25] I've never ever seen a problem really
[29:27] you know tell me if I'm wrong if you
[29:29] have a situation but even at work and
[29:30] different situations where you have
[29:31] problems and non-conformance issues with
[29:33] product and whatever more never one time
[29:35] has there ever been all the fault on one
[29:36] one person or one particular variable
[29:39] never ever one time even if it's 99%
[29:42] this guy's fault and 1% this guy's fault
[29:44] they still share the pH this guy with
[29:46] the 1% is over here blaming this 99% guy
[29:49] right or what if it's 25 25 25 25 I mean
[29:52] usually there's many variables in any
[29:54] problem so all you have to do in this
[29:56] great economy is know what your
[29:58] contribution is to that problem your
[30:00] fault in that problem fix that first
[30:03] then you can go help your brother get
[30:05] that little speck out of his eye right
[30:09] that's right so we got to be responsible
[30:11] because in Genesis 21:15 that's exactly
[30:13] what God told Adam right took the and
[30:16] the Lord God took the man and put him in
[30:18] the Garden of Eden to dress it and keep
[30:19] it in other words you're
[30:22] responsible and they tried to blame
[30:24] everything else for their fall right
[30:26] trying to blame this that and the other
[30:28] they should just said hey I know I'm
[30:29] responsible but they
[30:31] didn't amen stewards of this economy is
[30:34] what you are in Luke 16 1-13 you can
[30:37] read about that talks a lot about
[30:39] stewardship amen Proverbs 27:23 be
[30:42] diligent to know the state of thy flocks
[30:45] and look well to thy
[30:47] herds I mean it's all through the Bible
[30:49] we're responsible you can't we can't get
[30:50] out of it amen that's how God purposed
[30:52] it because he knows as soon as you take
[30:54] ownership and responsibility of
[30:55] something that's when the change will
[30:57] happen that's right all too often we
[30:58] keep having these reoccurring problems
[31:00] in our life and it's all because we're
[31:02] not taking responsibility we're not
[31:04] tending to the flocks in the herds that
[31:06] God has given us we're trying to blame
[31:09] somebody else for it or some other
[31:11] variable oh woe is me even if it rains
[31:13] in pores and thunderstorms or let me put
[31:15] it this way if there's a tornado going
[31:17] outside you're not going to sit stand
[31:19] there and complain and blame the weather
[31:20] and stand right there in the middle of
[31:21] it are you you're going to do something
[31:23] about it am you're going to go protect
[31:25] yourself do something right don't sit
[31:28] sit there and complaining about
[31:29] something you have no control over it
[31:30] does nothing amen it just keeps your
[31:32] life in
[31:33] danger right so it does no good to
[31:36] complain about things even you don't
[31:37] have control of do something about it do
[31:39] what you can about it there's always a
[31:41] solution always Our God's economy
[31:44] there's always a solution amen if there
[31:46] wasn't then he wouldn't be infinite
[31:49] right amen okay
[31:52] amen let's turn to First Peter 1 if you
[31:54] could please
[32:09] praise the Lord 1 Peter
[32:15] 1:6 wherein ye greatly Rejoice though
[32:19] now for a season if need be you're in
[32:21] heaviness through manifold temptations
[32:23] that the trial of your faith being much
[32:25] more precious than that of gold that
[32:27] perisheth
[32:28] though it be tried with fire might be
[32:30] found unto praise and honor and glory of
[32:32] the appearing of Jesus Christ so the
[32:34] trial of your faith is more precious in
[32:36] gold is what that said right there so
[32:38] how about in James 1:10 through2 but the
[32:41] rich in that he is made low because as
[32:44] the flower of the grass he shall pass
[32:46] away for the sun no sooner riseth with
[32:48] burning heat but it withth the grass and
[32:50] the flower thereof fath and the grace
[32:53] gra the grace of the fashion of it
[32:55] perish so also shall the rich man Fade
[32:58] Away in his ways blessed is the man that
[33:01] endureth through Temptation for when he
[33:04] is tried he will rece receive a Crown of
[33:06] Life which the Lord hath promised to
[33:08] them that love
[33:11] him so what are we saying here I'm
[33:13] saying that trials produce great wealth
[33:16] trials produce great wealth so anyone
[33:18] that tries to run from trials or get
[33:20] away from them in any way that's not
[33:22] what you should be doing amen if you
[33:24] want to build the economy of God in your
[33:26] life or allow it to be built you have to
[33:28] go through trials that's right you have
[33:30] to face them don't run from them face
[33:33] them amen that's what God wants us to do
[33:35] because that's why he's sending them
[33:37] your way why do you think he did that to
[33:39] job I mean this wasn't God our God is
[33:42] not a vain God Satan is a vain he's the
[33:45] one that's vain not our God Amen right
[33:47] so When Trials come your way seek for a
[33:49] purpose in that there's a purpose behind
[33:51] everything remember all things work
[33:53] together for the good of those who love
[33:55] the Lord right you don't have to
[33:57] understand it I'm just saying all things
[33:58] work together for your good amen all
[34:01] things work together amen
[34:04] amen 2 Corinthians 4:17 says the light
[34:08] Affliction that you're enduring right
[34:09] now works in exceedingly and eternal
[34:11] weight and Glory so that that that
[34:14] little light Affliction even says light
[34:15] Affliction this little thing that you
[34:17] think so great right now this this just
[34:21] Builds an exceeding weight in glory amen
[34:25] this little pound that you got to carry
[34:26] around oh me this little
[34:30] pound translates to a million pounds in
[34:34] heaven right so don't worry it's just a
[34:37] little pound little weight right now
[34:38] don't don't exaggerate it is what we're
[34:40] saying amen amen yes sir yes don't
[34:44] exaggerate it so we say that we shall
[34:46] not want Psalms 231 the Lord is my
[34:48] shepherd I shall not want amen so we got
[34:51] to have faith in the word do we have
[34:52] faith in the word amen so all these
[34:54] things I'm just speaking of the word so
[34:56] we can believe it everybody has faith
[34:57] you have that currency right so just
[34:59] take it for exchange right now you can
[35:01] you can receive this just exchange your
[35:02] faith right remember we said no faith no
[35:05] exchange no transaction amen this right
[35:08] here that I just read in Psalms 23:1
[35:10] this right here if you don't have faith
[35:11] you'll never receive that right so if
[35:13] you're standing sitting there in your
[35:14] seat like this oh you know I already
[35:17] have you know I don't need that you
[35:18] probably don't have the faith to receive
[35:19] it you ought to go get the faith go to
[35:21] the bank of God and get it amen take a
[35:23] loan
[35:24] out he's rich in Mercy he'll give you
[35:27] whatever loan you want won't he amen
[35:30] doesn't he give you whatever size loan
[35:32] you want all you got to do is go ask
[35:35] amen he he has never
[35:37] denied a loan application amen never
[35:41] amen he has that he's nobody has a
[35:43] record like that no Bank does right and
[35:46] and and none of his loans have ever
[35:49] defaulted a't that good amen oh he's
[35:53] such a good God to us he's got a perfect
[35:55] track record amen
[35:58] praise the Lord oh my so we know that
[36:01] that faith and and I I have I want to
[36:02] get more scriptures on that that'd be an
[36:04] awesome sermon would wouldn't it faith
[36:05] is is the currency of the economy of God
[36:07] Amen there's so much on faith you know
[36:09] you go typing that in and you know all
[36:11] these I don't know hundreds of
[36:12] scriptures come up with faith in it my
[36:14] God that's that that's a big thing amen
[36:18] praise the
[36:19] Lord the currency of this
[36:22] world will fail right just a few prosen
[36:26] just compare and contrast here a little
[36:28] bit so the economy of God that currency
[36:30] can never fail right we know that it
[36:32] will never fail it's not like the dollar
[36:34] where you know we we know where our
[36:36] dollar is going you know how it's losing
[36:38] value every day hence the you know the
[36:39] past couple years inflation has taken
[36:41] this thing like for crazy you know crazy
[36:42] ride now you can't hard you know it's
[36:45] just it's just amazing I don't know the
[36:46] figures off hand but you look at the
[36:48] inflation over the past whatever 50
[36:49] years and it's just phenomenal I mean
[36:51] it's phenomenal I you
[36:54] know but it can't fail
[36:58] also in the economy of God his currency
[36:59] of Faith the more you give the more you
[37:01] get back isn't that something because
[37:05] with this dollar we have in this United
[37:06] States the more you give the less you
[37:07] have of it
[37:08] right but the currency of God the more
[37:11] you give the more you have
[37:13] amen amen how about this
[37:17] uh the the what you purchase with it
[37:20] your faith will'll take with you amen
[37:23] the currency of God whatever you
[37:24] purchase it's yours it marries into your
[37:26] soul right those spiritual things come
[37:28] right in there but whatever you purchase
[37:30] with your money now you're not gonna
[37:32] take that with you that's gonna stay
[37:33] here that's gonna burn yes sir amen yes
[37:36] so there there's you know there there's
[37:38] a lot of things like that that that's
[37:39] just amazing because God's economy is
[37:41] far superior isn't it the way that he
[37:43] designs everything you know as we talked
[37:44] about Satan's a copy he just copies
[37:46] everything and you know he's a perverter
[37:48] so you know God's economy that's what we
[37:50] want we ought to model everything after
[37:51] that
[37:52] amen amen couple more
[37:55] here let's go to the parable of the
[37:58] talents this is a wonderful story I love
[38:00] this story there's so much there's so
[38:01] many Rich things in here that we can
[38:03] learn about the economy of God let me
[38:05] just kind of skim through it here it's
[38:07] in Matthew 251 14-30 how that the master
[38:11] has servants and a number of servants
[38:13] and he's leaving right he's going out of
[38:16] town he's leaving his wealth to your
[38:21] charge we're right there this is us am
[38:25] he's gone right now he's not here he's
[38:27] not walking around on this earth right
[38:29] and that's on purpose because we are to
[38:31] take and care and keep this economy just
[38:34] says in the
[38:36] beginning okay so these servants come to
[38:39] him and he says okay servants in this
[38:41] scripture you can even read it it says
[38:43] that these servants are trained servants
[38:45] they're trained into to know what to do
[38:47] with this money because in Luke 12:47 it
[38:51] says and the servant which knew his
[38:53] Lord's will and prepared not himself
[38:56] neither did according to his will shall
[38:58] be beaten with many stripes you know
[39:01] what God wants you to do am the message
[39:03] of the hour has made sure you know what
[39:05] God wants you to do with his economy
[39:07] there's no excuses that's why it's so
[39:09] dangerous to hear this word this truth
[39:12] and walk out that door and not do what
[39:13] the word says that is
[39:15] dangerous very dangerous
[39:19] so you are just like these servants they
[39:21] were trained it says in here in Matthew
[39:23] 25 they were trained they knew their
[39:25] Lord's will they knew it
[39:29] but two of them one received five
[39:32] talents one received two and the other
[39:33] one received one I believe so the the
[39:36] First with the one with five he followed
[39:38] his training he followed the blueprint
[39:41] he knew what to do in this economy his
[39:42] master didn't have to be right there
[39:44] with him holding his hand right he knew
[39:46] what to do because he was trained so he
[39:48] did it and guess what it returned a lot
[39:50] of good results doubled it
[39:53] right so I bet you'd like that take all
[39:56] your money in the bank right now and
[39:58] just go out and follow the simple
[39:59] instructions that the master gives you
[40:01] and it doubles I mean that's pretty easy
[40:03] right so these these these servants it
[40:06] wasn't hard they knew what to do they
[40:08] were already given the instructions no
[40:09] doubt he probably wrote it out and work
[40:11] instructions you know this that and the
[40:12] other this is what I want done right so
[40:13] they knew it we have his word black and
[40:16] white so the second servant had two
[40:19] talents and what did he do he followed
[40:20] the same instructions and what did it do
[40:21] it double right amen so now he has four
[40:25] great now this other servant that has
[40:26] one he was was probably complaining and
[40:28] whining because he only had one and the
[40:29] other ones had more than him
[40:31] right right doesn't that happen oh yeah
[40:34] so he thought looked at the work
[40:35] instructions and thought well you know
[40:37] I've been trained in this and this is a
[40:39] bunch of
[40:40] garbage you know I I don't know I'm
[40:41] afraid of this I don't you know I'm have
[40:43] fear said he had fear right he's afraid
[40:46] of his master this is I don't I don't
[40:48] like this I'm gonna do what I want with
[40:50] it so when the master came home what did
[40:53] he say to them first two well done well
[40:55] done great you followed my instructions
[40:57] did my bidding you uh you know you
[40:59] received a you returned on investment
[41:01] for me thank you and they were rewarded
[41:03] with more right then the lord of the
[41:05] house give them more so it was pretty
[41:07] simple they took the money that their
[41:10] Master gave them it wasn't theirs put
[41:13] yourself in this place he gave them the
[41:14] money he told them what to do with it
[41:16] they did exactly what he told them to do
[41:18] with it and then they they it it yeah it
[41:20] doubled they they return a lot of value
[41:23] and then they come back and then they
[41:24] the master says well done you've good
[41:26] done what I told you to do with my own
[41:27] money that I gave you and I will now
[41:29] reward
[41:30] you amen now they you know no doubt they
[41:33] had unsearchable riches and they entered
[41:35] right into the Kingdom right but this
[41:37] third one didn't do that and what
[41:39] happened to him it was taken away even
[41:41] what he has and given to those that have
[41:43] and he was cast into Eternal damnation
[41:47] right that was the contract he signed
[41:49] that was the mortgage that he took out
[41:51] right so that was a great example put
[41:54] yourself in those shoes and learn from
[41:56] that example amen amen I'm myself
[41:58] included now all
[42:00] right praise the Lord when do we start
[42:04] here 3:30 is when I come up is that
[42:08] right all
[42:10] right not too much longer here now we
[42:13] have in Luke excuse me Ecclesiastes 11
[42:17] if you want to turn there please
[42:17] everyone turn there say Amen when you
[42:20] have it
[42:29] everyone there Ecclesiastes 11:1 this is
[42:33] a powerful scripture
[42:35] cast thy
[42:39] bread upon the waters for Thou shalt
[42:42] find it many days Thou shalt find it
[42:45] after many days okay so what we're
[42:48] talking about here is Investments that's
[42:50] what we're talking about you if you
[42:51] didn't catch on to that so the story of
[42:53] the the parable of the uh you know of
[42:55] the talents there that was about
[42:56] investing
[42:57] God wants to invest in you so now we
[43:00] have a situation in Ecclesiastes where
[43:02] it tells us that cast your bread upon
[43:04] the waters and you shall find it many
[43:06] days then it'll come back to you right
[43:08] it'll it'll return on investment but
[43:09] it's going to take many days so that
[43:11] means we got to be patient this
[43:13] scripture speaks patience and it says
[43:15] don't get all worked up don't get all
[43:17] overwhelmed don't think you know we tal
[43:19] that that great illustration about the
[43:20] Gap you know we always talk about it
[43:22] we're here we need to get here we got a
[43:23] gap okay that Gap now it's going to take
[43:26] a little bit of time to fill that Gap
[43:27] Gap don't get discouraged don't get
[43:29] discouraged because it will return we're
[43:32] working with the laws and principles and
[43:33] values of this God's Great economy and
[43:36] they don't fail right I mean these laws
[43:38] that are in this economy they don't fail
[43:40] so all you got to do is follow them just
[43:41] like the parable of the talents you just
[43:43] got to follow okay so now we know that
[43:45] if we cast this out here this investment
[43:48] it'll come back now in his historical
[43:51] standpoint here it says here that that
[43:55] back in these times and even now go over
[43:57] to the Orient go over to you know the
[43:59] Asian lands and where they grow a lot of
[44:01] rice the farmer comes out and he and
[44:05] he's got water P you know he's got rice
[44:06] patties water and he throws that rice
[44:09] out there seed throws a seed throws a
[44:11] seed now do you think he comes back a
[44:13] week later and he's got
[44:15] rice you know how long it takes to grow
[44:18] rice long time I don't have the exact
[44:21] figure but it takes a long takes a long
[44:23] time you know so he has faith in that
[44:26] law of that seed it's going to come
[44:27] forth right it's just like when you
[44:29] plant a seed of any type out there in
[44:31] the ground you don't come back and pull
[44:32] it back up the next day to or dig it
[44:34] back up to see if it's growing do you
[44:36] you'd kill a thing right so have
[44:38] patience God has patience with us he
[44:42] doesn't come back ripping in your life
[44:43] because you're not this that and the
[44:44] other right he lets you grow little by
[44:47] little just like we talked about this
[44:48] morning with my faults you know he lets
[44:50] you grow he sends he allows it to come
[44:51] your way right I mean that thing that
[44:54] that Spirit was knocking me around
[44:55] knocking me off and I was just kept
[44:57] coming back to my notes trying to trust
[44:58] in myself and I kept stumbling I mean I
[45:02] that was that was very powerful there
[45:03] must there had to been something else
[45:04] going on I don't know but uh that was
[45:06] very powerful on me I never experienced
[45:08] it quite like that but you know I just
[45:10] we just got to be patient
[45:14] amen Matthew 22 if you could turn there
[45:17] please we're going to we're going to be
[45:19] in the portion of 15 through 22 Matthew
[45:21] 2215 through 22 let's kind of skip
[45:23] around a little bit there
[45:29] all right let's go to verse
[45:33] 19 now let's start at 15 rather sorry
[45:36] take a little bit of time and go through
[45:37] this get the context and then went the
[45:40] Pharisees and took counsel how they
[45:41] might entangle him in his talk and they
[45:44] sent out unto him their disciples with
[45:46] the herodians saying Master we know Thou
[45:49] Art true and teachest the way of God in
[45:52] truth neither carest thou for any man
[45:54] for thou regardest not the person of men
[45:57] isn't that what Satan does look what
[45:58] he's doing here trying to butter him up
[46:00] trying to oh we know that you're so true
[46:02] you know can you imagine what they were
[46:04] thinking when they were saying that they
[46:06] were lying out their
[46:08] teeth I they were think about that he
[46:11] his false economy makes people do that
[46:14] right they think I'm so right and
[46:15] prideful I'm gonna catch this guy in his
[46:17] fault and I'm you know and they whatever
[46:18] schemes they come up with amen so love
[46:21] the people that do that to you love them
[46:23] because that's what God wants right love
[46:26] love your
[46:27] enemy so that's what Jesus did
[46:30] here he had love and compassion for them
[46:33] he knew what was going on so he said
[46:35] tell us therefore in verse 17 what
[46:37] thinkest thou is it lawful to give
[46:38] tribute unto Caesar or not but Jesus
[46:41] perceived their their wickedness and
[46:43] said why tempt me you Hypocrites now
[46:45] that doesn't mean he didn't love them he
[46:47] was just straight out with them right
[46:49] you can love people and be firm you
[46:52] definitely can just don't you know just
[46:54] don't don't do nothing wrong right don't
[46:56] you know don't you got to be in line
[46:57] with the word right it's a tough love
[46:59] right here he's telling them exactly
[47:01] what they are and I I'll tell you what
[47:02] I'm glad when people tell me exactly
[47:04] what I am if I got a fold or a problem
[47:06] you better come and tell me about it be
[47:08] straightforward with me don't beat
[47:09] around the bush I don't want that I want
[47:11] to be right I want to be in truth so
[47:15] you're my keeper and I'll be your keeper
[47:18] yes sir right so Jesus is pretty
[47:21] straightforward with them and then he
[47:23] said in verse 19 show me the tribute
[47:25] money and they brought to him a penny
[47:27] and he said to them whose image in
[47:29] superscription is this on this you know
[47:31] on this on this coin here and they said
[47:33] unto him Caesars then he said unto them
[47:35] render therefore unto Caesar the things
[47:37] which are Caesars and unto God the
[47:39] things that are
[47:41] gods and when they heard these words
[47:43] they marveled and left him and went
[47:44] their way isn't that
[47:47] beautiful what this says to me you know
[47:49] this spoke volumes to me when I read it
[47:51] because you know you're going to use
[47:53] currency of either economy right faith
[47:57] or filthy lucer right of the other
[48:00] economy right or so you know this
[48:04] basically says Jesus says the principle
[48:05] right here that whatever currency that
[48:08] belongs to that's who it's going to go
[48:09] back to that's all that's the only
[48:12] economy you can use it in right so
[48:14] Satan's currency you're not going to be
[48:15] using it in God's
[48:17] economy and God's currency you aren't
[48:19] going to be using it in Satan's economy
[48:21] right so be careful what currency you
[48:24] hold whether it be F Faith right right
[48:27] or whether it be selfishness hatred lust
[48:31] Envy Strife lying Spirit covetousness I
[48:35] mean Satan loves it when you hold that
[48:36] that currency he wants you to you get
[48:38] all kinds of things for that think about
[48:40] when you start using all those things
[48:42] what do you get back exactly what Satan
[48:43] wants you to get back in it's perpetual
[48:45] cycle of conflict that you never get out
[48:47] of that's right so watch what currency
[48:51] you acquire because that's who it's
[48:53] going to go back to amen and you'll get
[48:56] whatever you pay pay
[48:57] for yeah
[49:00] amen so as we close here let's let's
[49:03] stand together I want to hold you too
[49:04] long
[49:09] there the spirit is willing but the
[49:11] flesh is weak I know I know that old
[49:15] flesh can't we can't wait to get out of
[49:18] it amen when our change comes the Final
[49:20] Redemption of the body right what you've
[49:22] been working for and what you've been
[49:24] building up your currency for it's going
[49:26] to going to be a Payday there's going to
[49:28] be a final payday it's just going to be
[49:31] a the final
[49:34] exchange oh that Rapture I can't
[49:38] wait keep that in mind this is a serious
[49:41] thing now is the time to build up that
[49:43] currency don't get to the end of the
[49:45] road and not have enough currency to
[49:47] make it
[49:49] across I mean that's a serious thing if
[49:51] you think about it so time right now you
[49:54] can think it's against us but really for
[49:56] us because we have time still we're not
[49:58] we're not dead yet right so you still
[50:00] have time so take advantage of it work
[50:03] like the Rapture is going to happen
[50:05] tomorrow
[50:06] amen that's how you got to be that's how
[50:09] through all those years Paul kept
[50:11] writing you know in context the coming
[50:13] of the Lord is n he's coming everybody
[50:15] thought he's coming he's coming oh
[50:17] tomorrow he's coming or next week he's
[50:19] coming or they were all waiting for this
[50:20] the great
[50:21] Deliverance that was don't you see why
[50:23] that was it's so they could build that
[50:25] currency of faith
[50:27] if someone thought like in the parable
[50:28] these servants that come out here and
[50:30] they thought their master was delaying
[50:31] and they didn't do what they should have
[50:32] done because oh I got plenty of
[50:35] time I'll enjoy life how many times you
[50:37] hear people say this I'll enjoy life
[50:39] first and then I'll serve
[50:42] God don't be caught in that
[50:45] trap serving God is far better serving
[50:48] God now is far better than enjoying life
[50:50] with all its Pleasures right now and the
[50:52] reward is by far better In the End Amen
[50:55] so it's a win-win situation a and lose
[50:58] lose for the devil
[51:02] so amen so let's think about this which
[51:05] economy do you put first we all know
[51:07] that the you know we need to seek first
[51:09] the kingdom of God and all things in the
[51:11] natural will be added onto you whatever
[51:13] you have need of will come so don't
[51:14] worry about those things right God
[51:16] closed the the the flowers of the field
[51:18] you know they're all so pretty and
[51:19] beautiful he closed them takes care of
[51:21] them sparrows they fly around they get
[51:23] their food they don't worry about
[51:25] it and how much more valuable are you
[51:27] than the
[51:28] creation infinitely
[51:30] valuable he purchased you with your own
[51:33] blood Joshua 721 through 22 talks about
[51:38] aen he he didn't pick the right economy
[51:43] there did he he picked the economy of
[51:45] Satan he coveted after those things of a
[51:47] foreign economy a foreign nation's
[51:50] wealth and he brought it in and it
[51:52] hindered the whole Camp of Israel so
[51:55] anybody here come in after foreign
[51:58] currency could hinder the whole
[52:01] congregation people could die because of
[52:05] you oh my that's a serious thing people
[52:07] could spiritually die because of
[52:10] you you could have such an impact on
[52:12] their life like that so we need to make
[52:15] sure that we covet after the correct
[52:17] currency
[52:19] amen Ephesians uh Philip Philippians
[52:22] rather 4:19 as we're closing here but my
[52:25] God shall
[52:27] supply all your needs according to his
[52:30] riches in Glory by Jesus Christ that's
[52:34] Philippians
[52:38] 49 amen so we got to keep in mind who we
[52:41] are what economy we truly belong to but
[52:44] sometimes we forget and we get off track
[52:46] a little bit we do we're all guilty okay
[52:50] and God just wants to bring us right
[52:52] back
[52:54] so praise the Lord
[52:57] he's good to us isn't
[52:59] he amen well I trust there was a
[53:02] blessing said somewhere here because the
[53:04] word is a blessing isn't it let's give
[53:05] the Lord a round of applause here
[53:08] amen you know I'm I'm so thankful for
[53:11] this economy that we're in I learned so
[53:12] much by going through this I mean I
[53:14] didn't all these things you know just
[53:15] build your faith it's simple but that's
[53:17] where God he wants it in Simplicity
[53:19] right as we talked about this morning
[53:21] Satan wants everything to get so complex
[53:23] and so you know so hard to understand
[53:26] and so many variables that what about
[53:27] this and what about that and tries to
[53:28] make so many exceptions that that he
[53:31] gets you off track he does that's what
[53:33] he wants keep it simple go back to the
[53:36] Holy Ghost sir you don't have to
[53:39] understand how to solve all your
[53:40] problems just go back to the Holy Spirit
[53:42] he'll lead you and guide you but I've
[53:44] I've been such a fornicator in the past
[53:46] and I've done done adultery and I've
[53:48] done all these wicked things and I've
[53:50] stole and I've people and killed people
[53:51] or whatever more it doesn't matter now

[54:40] these
[54:42] things Lord
[54:45] Jesus we thank you for this
[54:47] word it's not a word that any of us can
[54:53] produce we don't manufacture this word
[54:57] Lord You're the maker and creator of
[54:59] this great economy Lord you just it's
[55:02] amazing what you've done for us you've
[55:03] set this great vast economy up it's full
[55:06] of riches and and
[55:08] glory and you've given it to us just for
[55:11] free all we have to do is make that
[55:14] commitment to you sign on that dotted
[55:16] line of your contract and your contract
[55:19] is the easiest contract there ever was
[55:22] you hardly have any rules in it right
[55:24] just if you love me keep my
[55:28] Commandments amen we thank you Lord
[55:30] Jesus your Holy Spirit even keeps the
[55:32] Commandments for us we're not even the
[55:34] ones that have to do it so we thank you
[55:36] Lord there's there's all mercy and all
[55:38] Grace in this contract so Lord help us
[55:41] if if there's one in here or whoever's
[55:43] in here that's never signed your
[55:45] contract Lord I pray that you would
[55:47] bring it to them just now Lord may they
[55:49] sign your contract Lord and may they see
[55:51] receive that stamp of approval the holy
[55:54] spirit in their soul lord God who is
[55:56] signed and sealed and delivered until
[55:58] the day of their Redemption Lord truly
[56:00] let's examine ourselves because some of
[56:02] us may be in this room just now that
[56:04] think we have signed that contract they
[56:05] think we have received that seal but we
[56:07] really have not the contract that we
[56:10] signed is the wrong contract and oh
[56:12] don't worry because the Bible tells us
[56:14] that when that old man is dead then we
[56:15] can be married to another one and Lord
[56:18] even if we've signed that old contract
[56:19] we can still break it all you got to do
[56:21] is rip it and tear it up and that
[56:23] contract that old man will be dead but
[56:25] we have to do it only we are the only
[56:27] one that can do it we are the only one
[56:29] that can tear that contract up and then
[56:31] your blood covers it and it's like we
[56:33] never signed it in the first place
[56:35] Justified and then you sanctify us Lord
[56:38] and then you fill us with your Holy
[56:39] Spirit we thank you for that being right
[56:41] there in your contract Lord
