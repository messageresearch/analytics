[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] some time out of words when it comes to this this messaging and you know the thing that mostly I'm excited about is the changes I seek are doing in me you know I've seen all kinds of miracles but this is the greatest change the greatest miracle that God has ever done and I'm able to see changes that I had nothing to do with God comes along and changed me in his own time and this is what I love about it we're gonna ask our brother Jasper to come and just minister if you want to sing before then whatever you want to do I want God to have his way a manual we appreciate further Samuel he came in and I told her you could he says no he said no no no that I'm happy so thank you for that brotherly kindness we're not going along the time we're gonna let him have his way you may be seated I guess until ya is good to us how many out thankful just just thankful I wish I could say it like I feel it but [Laughter] stand to your feet just a moment so we can then get into the word a man giving honor to our Lord amen amen thanking God for the angel of this house and amen and sister Brooks amen yes and we just think off for the Saints I'm brother Keith amen brother Isaac in this absence amen oh there he is back there amen amen brother rich and those I've been able to fellowship with amen the soldiers in the gospel Amen that all up ahead of us looking back to y'all come on amen I've already seen great things y'all let's get on up here amen amen we thank God amen Peter said you know that how amazing it is that we can love Him who we have not seen we haven't seen them yet but how many you're in love with it and it just takes a little bit of inspiration from each preacher and you know God's prophets and a minute just take a little inspiration for them to just give us a glimpse of what he could look like y'all know the story you know that people try to paint him and there's no way to paint it there's no way to ink out that humility all the the magnitude of God and put into a picture frame you know but hummina still love him yes and so I thank God for preaching I think God that he gave all of us a part of it and if God had to make me a preacher I'd have been a big mouth shouting in the church will you please be quiet I can't help it I can't hold it amen amen and so I want you to turn to Genesis to eighth chapter you man picking up where we left off this morning Amen I told you this would be a seat of series on the seasons time seasons and purpose amen so we want to go a little farther with that tonight amen now y'all don't get sad on me tonight just because I get to preach on this amen but the title of this night semesters B night seasons amen amen so let's just see what God would give us amen I rather be obedient to him than for us to shout every time amen I would just rather be obedient and I've learned just to he'll work it out amen amen humming no even when it's dark the Sun is still shining amen yes all right Genesis 822 and I want to read there and let's read it says as long as the earth indoors see and I'm reading a different translation here let me get y'all have King James writes Amen I don't mean the home I like you know I mean I have to study different translations here amen but I like the old-fashioned I just don't mean no harm I'm old-fashioned I don't mind telling it so let me just get Genesis 822 from King James if I read it could read just a little different amen and amen while the earth remaineth seedtime and harvest and cold and heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not cease amen and I'll just read it from the NIV version too but it says as long as the earth and dualist seed time and harvest cold and heat summer and winter day and night will never cease amen let's buy his father we thank you O God we've read your holy scriptures and father as we know that your word is eternal and it is settled in heaven you said not one jot or tittle would pass away until every question mark and quotation that you spoken be is fulfilled Lord we pray that whatever our part in there if we're just a period if we're - just a - in the scriptures let that part that you've given us Lord be for field that we can please you O God father more than signs and wonders and miracles father we want to know you and we want you to know us and to be known of you thank you tonight father for this flock bless us in Jesus name Amen amen god bless you may be seated a man soul a man we want to try to deal with night seasons a man all right amen I'm in this blessed this morning I mean I mean you see that we can't mess up just keep going follow it you can't mess it up amen yes and not you know so I want to move a little closer to that amen dealing with the seasons and tonight we want to deal with on this evening deal with night seasons and I want to read another scripture here about night seasons David quoted this verse and I have it any mind know said but I don't want to leave it out before I get all stirred amen Psalms for those you take note Psalm 16 verse 5 and 7 before we get into the message tonight I'll recap a little bit so you know those who missed this morning amen and when you meet him cross the street they say well what was the message about you telling guess it's only had a guest preacher and guess amen amen it's always good to come to church you might miss something just the way sometime God will say it different something you know already you heard it before but it was said just a little different and it gets a little bit closer to your spirit amen amen so it's always good Amen God in simplicity amen but I want to read Psalm 16 verse 5 and 7 just to reiterate the subject here and outline it before we get into the message the Lord David said in verse 5 the Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup amen thou maintain it my lot thou keepeth my life remember I told you this that the place that we lived in akin and we went through a lot Amen I think the one we had a good neighbor on one side and we had a bad neighbor on one side and he just believed in cutting grass on my side and I said no please don't cut on my side how many know God has given us all a lot and you better sting on your own lot amen working out based on what God has given you though maintenance my lot David I'll say it's also said in verse 6 the lines are fallen unto me in Pleasant places that's David looking at his own lines the lines are falling unto me not looking across the street and across the yard and across what somebody else has and what they have and I wish I had I wish amen but looking at your own lines and what everything what's surrounding you it has fallen I'm glad to be Who I am how many can say man the lines have fallen to me in Pleasant places yay I have a godly inheritance if you knew what God has left for us and what he has given to us you'd be a happy person it's like getting married and got some prizes I think when we meet my wife got man we had so many gifts we had stacked them in the closet and we will open them up little by little and God has stacked up so many gifts so many wonderful things in the closet for us and we haven't even unboxed it yet how many think God yes the lines are falling in Pleasant places I have a godly heritage I will what I will bless the Lord who has given me counsel my rains my spirit also and struck me David said in the night season sometimes you have a lot but sometimes you hit a night season and you can't see a thing all your spiritual experience how many no God can take you to a level and that what you thought you could use it ain't working now amen oh Jesus how many know what I'm talking about my mind is my thoughts are just on it right now but sometimes you just got to feel up in the air that's true you don't know you just got to feel hope the line is up there you just got the feel your weight but God is there in the night seasons oh Jesus that's wonderful right there that's beautiful right there yes God will be with you in the night seasons all right so there are all night seasons their time this will be oh this is my season everything is lovely no you're gonna go through some night see I'm gonna know that farmer goes to the store get the seeds amen all in the daylight amen and plows the garden and get it ready amen for planning and all of a sudden you get dog see you got to go in the ground sometimes when God get ready to transform you nobody won't know about it sometimes and God is getting ready to change the dimension of how you act anymore but you won't be mean and snappy no more you know when you get through to and when when this when it when you come up out of the ground you have a little more sweetness to you some sweet potatoes amen yes all right and so they're nighttime they're night seasons there are times when they get dark there are times when you don't know what God is doing but you just trust God you've been trusting him all along but he's shifting on you taking to taking you to another level and he got to teach you how to trust him in that next level yes you can't go like I'm in front and God in the back no it's always he leadeth me I'll follow him yes night seasons night seasons all right and so we want to look at this just for a few minutes a man st. John at 11:00 let's look at st. John 11 amen as we get into the message tonight that their night season sometimes the season Amen change on you youth so surprised oh my but just trust God in the night seasons amen st. John 11 in verse 10 amen and through 25 of those you won't take notes and just remember now as we go through this as long as the earth indoors and low as the aren't and gules church as long as you open your eyes and there's a earth now you can wake up in space you own earth and that's good to say as long as the earth indoors see time and harvest : e summer in winter day and night will never cease in other words they'll be up time you can sow again you missed it you missed last year's planning but then it'll come again it'll be seed time again and you can take the original seed and plant it in the ground and it will guarantee come on coming - thank God for that hallelujah as long as the earth remain there'll be Cesar's Amen God has not finished yet you know people want to go home so fast you're ready to go home but dog got people that still need to be saved dog got people that need to come into the light what you so in a hurry for you already going home what they're gonna do when you get there but give God praise God say my soul amen God want somebody else to hear the good news but as long as the earth remain there be a time that you can so don't worry about they're not they're not hearing me don't worry there'll be a season when they'll hear you they didn't hear your last time there'll be a season you'll be seeing you can plant it in the ground and it'll come up it'll be a strong strong tree good strong roots as hot bed plants you got to water it all the time the pass alone call me I'm not coming you don't call me pastor didn't call me so I'm not coming how many don't talking about it's time for pampering people amen I can't poplin we need to get that good old-fashioned hey man that girl fashion we're getting a gold fashion religion that's the long he don't have to call me I'll call him look you didn't call me but that's alright I'm calling you to encourage you as long as it remains there'll be a seat time yet there'll be a time that you can plant again and there'll be a time that you can harvest and I listen surprise people holla bye this is my season is it really let me know that's that's the cliche around a Christian how many of hear people say that oh it's my season it's a new season how many know you won't get nothing if you didn't put none in the ground I'm gonna rain fall on the just and the unjust but if you didn't want nothing don't expect nothing if you're doing the same thing you do all the time there will never be nothing else come up for you oh my goodness a nobody but it's true you can't just declare it's gonna be your season you didn't put none down won't nothing come up hey man but as long as this time you can still plant there's still time that you can wait for harvest if you planted something you ought to be out there with a straw hat any man my daddy would plant every year and come out to the end of the garden and just look and all he see was a blade but he was so encouraged she's a son if you put three calls in the hell and three calls in the road so high he talked about I can't figure I put three he rolled ahead and two and three and two and three and I just plant behind him I didn't know what in the world I was doing hey man yes but if you put it in the ground harvest time when it come you watch for the blade watch don't look for big things the Bible said despise not the day of small beginnings don't try to start where somebody ND you know that's where people want to do they wanted to read the end of the story they want to start where these great beating mining minister started I mean where they end it and they don't want to start where they began young people listen people gonna laugh at you with all the power with all the anointing with all this that God and giving you you can't dump that into my lap and go running in it you got to start from ABC I'm gonna no you gonna have to be laughed at yeah you have to let him know because see people are go along with you lawns you go along with them then salut they say well let's drink let's take a drink you said well I don't drink you know what so let's take a smoke so I don't smoke what well let's cut a little bit well I'm never come see and then there's a denial period and see if you're gonna act like them are you gonna do not see you'll have to be laughed at how many no you don't have to be laughed at you're gonna have to be a oddball in order for God to use you don't pluck up your seed young people don't be like the rest of the young people be a standard amen yes because when harvest I'm coming whatever's in there is coming up cold and heat summer and winter day and night will never cease I want to look at this in st. John Levin because sometimes when the season changes it can be so devastating can be so devastating when season changes and so in the story we all know you know Jesus said in st. John 11 verse 10 but if a man walking tonight he stumbles because there is no light in him there's no direction in him there's no inspiration in him there's no instruction in the nighttime to him sometimes God will bring you to a place where you don't have an answer people won't ask us to everything that's why people go to psychic and if I could just make up something but make sure you pay the only thing real about that situation is the money how many know that and they make themselves believe that answer all right and so in the situation God in verse 11 these things said he and after that he says done Tim our friend Lazarus is sleeping but I go that I might awake him out of sleep see what happened it was a nighttime the season had changed something that happened that that wasn't when thinking it was gonna happen and how many know Jesus loved Lazarus he loved him he was good friends and the Bible said in verse 12 then is the sign said Lord you know if he's sleeping he's doing well but Jesus wasn't speaking about taking a regular sleep he was talking about he was dead but they thought that he spoke of taking rest in sleep so they thought he was talking about he was sleeping but Jesus a lathers is dead alright then jesus said unto them plainly Lazarus is dead and I'm glad for your sake that I was not there to the intent that you might believe nevertheless that's going to him now here it is the disciples trying to figure out you know I look at here Thomas get a little comical in verse 16 and then Thomas said oh with just did of us unto the fellow citizen let us go let us go all so that we may die with him see Thomas getting a little comical trying to use God's Word let us go to that we may die with him you know what Jesus was talking about yes and Thomas had see he said that did Jesus said him when when Jesus came he found that they had laid him in the grave for days already it was past the normal time Oh God it was past three days it was past the time then it could have happened it was past the time where maybe people would have used their faith and sometimes things that you think well how to miss my day how to missed it but if God before you God can turn the time back oh god how many believe that that's not unscriptural now he made God meet time God made the clock amen all right Beth and one answered rules my 15 fur laws it wasn't right around the corner minute a minute the Jews came to Martha Mary to comfort them and just think about it everybody crying he meant verse 21 then said Martha to Jesus Lord if you had been here my brother wouldn't die see and when it happens he when it happened it was a ship and it left her breathless all the people crying everybody morning everybody I forgot well what didn't happen I was Jesus would have been here because if he would have been here and you know people think like that or if he would have been here it wouldn't happen no God ordained for it happen God meant for them because God had something else he was fixing a brain for oh god I hope you see where I am now Lazarus might be dead but I tell you I'm putting for your sake I'm glad that I wasn't down that I might come and go wake Lazarus oh people are not interested don't you worry God knows how to make them interesting people don't care about going to church God know how to bring them in if God could on non animals and the door open and nobody had you're strong where the door was listen when God start up they all find their way they'll find the true church they'll find somebody preaching the truth and they're just it is full well you know I just feel I feel like we need to turn left how many know God can tell you how to turn left God has said turn right go this way stand on the corner don't move and here comes somebody said well you know which way you're going I need to find a church and here they come into the Word of God God can still do it amen yes he can Lazarus was dead the scene had changed and the hope was lost and Jesus loved him I like that and I want you to know Jesus loved sentence he loves it when the condition gets up beyond you know God loves it when it gets beyond normal the loves are when you need a dog and the doctors say we don't have a cure God loves it when it get beyond what human beings can do so he can come be like a man so well I think we could do something about this I like the way God does that he becomes human and then he becomes God so God took this impossible situation here Amen it was all dog amen the season had been shifted Amen but Martha spoke the right thing and I wish the church was because she said but even now Lord whatsoever you ask God taught to give it to you now that's a lesson right there no matter how dark it is even now God could turn it back I missed a lot of opportunity I don't know about you but I know I missed a lot of opportunities I was timid I was afraid I was scared I didn't know how could I do it I didn't know if I could afford it but even now Lord he can tell me and I'll listen even now he can make a way out of no way yes he can oh yes he can even now Martha said even now Lord see and just that moment she blocked out in the morning that's what you got to do that's why I was trying to show you this morning amen amen Moses that had gotten so encouraged I believe you just beginning sometimes gotten encouraged your own self I believe Moses got that start being a Christian you know what I just killed a man and God come and talk to me I know how wretched a man that I am but I know God spoke to me now I can't get out of that and God told me this high this gift word God told me you use it this see God was teaching me how to do all this here and God said well when I tell you to sweet you speak God God told me God told me to raise the stick up there so I'm just gonna wait and all other noise was going away and that's how you got to do you got to get moved away until you can't hear nothing but God you got to get caught up Amen why you standing still you got to be in another place why you in this dimension amen the Bible says Stephanie and why they were there throwing rocks he couldn't see them rocks he was looking custom stove you look at past and hard faces he could see the face of God he could see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of God he could see the glory of God and all the angels I don't know what else he saw but that's what you got to do you got to get sawed out so you can't see nothing else hallelujah gotta get so liked you can't see nothing else and then the noise or go down and all of a sudden the little small voice that you heard started moving and you're standing here amen and knock I said Amen the noise switched it wasn't the devil's noise no more it wasn't done all that rebellion and I'm not going and I'm don't believe in going in church everybody want to go to church amen everybody got a baptism it wasn't all it wasn't all of it but it was a little bit about kissing him amen that's right that water went up even the children say well you know what I'm not staying back here mama going through I see the goats and the sheep going on down through dry land I'm going to and that's what the Brian needs and need a move of God so you can't shake out of it you have to go yes but is the night time I have to say it like this God put ladders and sleep for a reason and I believe lathers being put to sleep for a reason yeah I believe that's that a little time amen well you wish people just come on and come on you know and God got you where you can't get to him like you want to get to him God got you far away and you're trying to you know you're trying to hurt him get to him it look like every time they like something hindering you and lather is constantly getting dead deader I don't know if that's a word dinner that's not a word I'm making it up dinner Amen people are getting colder people are getting where they don't believe that the preaching of the gospel is God's Way but God promised how beautiful are the feet of those that preach the gospel oh man look at him coming up on the hill skipping on the mouth since a man when his feet was coming there having dominion over all the devil was doing as a man he was doing he was walking like you and I coming up over the mountains that's why they called him beautiful feet because he was having dominion we just walking normal now but he was saying no my sons and daughters can walk holy how many know that you can behold it because God is holy yes holy be holy for your God is holding Amen alright and so that's what happened so Martha made that great statement jesus said here thy brother shall rise again do you believe that amen I'll tell you there'll be a revival that we've never seen before can you believe it oh I got two amens can you really believe that God amen we'll do it where will you be me will you skip it and read about it on the internet or will you be in it oh oh mine will you be a part of history will you be a part of it listen history don't lie if people say you know people can say all kind of things they got all kind of negative things they say but you know God can its God can show it display it so much well you can't not deny it how many know what I'm talking about yes those great revivals they were so plainly done it was so extremely plainly done thousands of times thousands of people where you couldn't deny it not a little trickle over here and a little trickle over there how many know what I'm talking about yes it'll hit the news what in the world I saw the building on fire and the people came out shouting and praising God I'm telling you there's gonna be a revival that will unmatch anything we've ever seen it's got to be because God is greater yes lather was put to sleep for a season it was to change things around and get the furniture moved around not you doing it you can't move the fridge how many know that yep if the Hat sitting there hey man if the vision said a hat was there you got to leave the Hat you can't sit there Sarah I sure hope they'll move the Hat no the hats that leave the head alone but all my god when you see somebody to come by and get the hat and move it where it belong I want just a basa name yeah amen when you see things start working and clicking like it's supposed to be you see all mine say the season is right the timing is right it's gotta be God this time Oh hallelujah and I'm gonna be right there when it happened Oh God give God praise night season see how good God could beat you even in the night time God can instruct you in the night when you don't know what's going on God can put an answer in your heart brother and it's the right answer and you can't say it but it is fulfilling itself by your heart and that's powerful and I just interpret that but that's exactly what happened God can give you answer well Lord should I or shouldn't I you know God got a way of answering me I'm gonna know that God got away he don't have to I am going to do it oh oh he doesn't do it amen yes but how many love you Amen all right so let's just move on this move a little close can we go a little further our lad was put to sleep for a reason I said that now and that that happened it shall happen again they'll put him to sleep amen and it'll be past three days and I tell you I believe I'm gonna believe this past three days oh my hate to say it but how many know all of us we stink I know you don't want to say Amen brother I'm not yeah it's just a little perfume you got on if you don't put none on tomorrow the truth will be told a man is nothing - none of us we're not how many - know that without God we are sinners that's right yes lathers death stuck in there unmoved Amy and the church seemed like is not there amen but for God God did that for a reason because God even got its internet power we don't need it God won't give us more and we don't need it no sir got old Jesus I'm gonna know what I'm talking about if the times get rougher than God got it that way because what he a man has appointed us to do what he spoke about that we will do in the latter days you know the Bible said that we shall do exploits a man no you just won't get by a man we're gonna need the power so if you need the power of God gotta let the devil do little more I'm gonna know right when God got ready to deliver the children Israel amen the taskmasters got harder and then wonder why is he getting off I don't know if I want to trust Moses and I know you better go with Moses it's gonna be rough either way go amen but I'd rather go with God hallelujah lads put back it was a night season things that change everybody crying and sometimes people get crying you get the cry don't know why you crying I mean I know what I'm talking about yes amen all right all right and so that's what happened here all right let's look at Luke 22 27 let's go here for who is greater the one who's at the table or the one who serves I want to give you another example here in me and then we're gonna stop here Amen but I want to show you how Peters I mean I love Peter but I want you to see this real quickly sometimes it changes and God don't have to warn you you just have to know it didn't change now yes you have two good long years or revived when you wake up your cup of coffee and you get to study nothing's distract you then God pushed the time back say you got to figure out how to get up earlier amen it's God's program I'm gonna know that's the truth God can break up your regular habits I told you you know you even your body play tricks on you I was telling the church I was preaching I'll see y'all I said don't worry about me I said this suit is small I mean the suit is big you know the body played tricks on you when the body knows that you going fast you just came fast normal so well I fast one or two hours well if he don't have about 20 years the devil got you I'm gonna know that yeah you know my body played tricks on me and I had to learn after several years ago I learned from I learned from your pastor yeah I learned from him and you know what I went fast and fast and not the way I thought my goodness it got said well you didn't give me a little more yeah you know the body played tricks on you body know so well oh yeah he going fast and you know and that's the time you swell up more I won't ask me about any witness death but yeah your body swells up because it says you know what it Fitness saw of me so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna stow up some more food and sometimes you swell up biggest I'll see you you better go on and fast anyway I'm gonna know what I'm talking about yes sir email it's just a little meat just a little food a man's heart so now let's look at Peter I want you to see how some time is it's hard the way God does it but it has to do it this way all right in Luke 22 verse 28 you are those who have stood by me in my trials beautiful go with me just a moment I just want you to see this and you just think about all those apostles when Jesus came along and he picked a few guys I'd say they were bosom buddies youngja did you meet a person that's a real genuine article it seemed like you know them all along it's not a whole lot of issues you don't have to stand taller they accept you just hunt all y'all y'all know what I mean and and Jesus right here imma taters it hurts to think about this but I have to just share it to you just how it was showed to me this place right here Jesus had to do something it was hard to do it's in the scriptures and sometimes everybody can't go with you I'll be stopping don't don't be done just a minute here well sometimes they're places and the crowd thins down everybody can't go with you yeah you got pick you whew and take them few with you it's god it's scripture that's just how it is I wish that all everybody could go I know you wish I knew it but that's just how the scripture plays out and right here it's a beautiful setting here God you know the Lord begin to say you know y'all being with me when I started my ministry when I came here you know and I picked you know picture all the walk with me so we've been together by three years you know and and then he began to talk to them there he said verse 29 22 chapters Luke 22 29 and I confer on you a kingdom watch this now watch just as my father conferred on me watch what's happening it's actually happening right on this verse it's happening right he said I confer on you a kingdom just as my father had conferred on me so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel hallelujah how many would have been glad to been there that day oh my god but I hope tonight God would help you see you are there already hallelujah Jesus oh my god Jesus comfortness to them you see and then right in verse 31 here's the thing now see but I watch night season it come but don't keep your eye on the word don't never look away from that word don't decide that something else will work nothing else will work God's work cannot fail it can't fail us you don't think God will take you out in the woods and look and let you get lost to show you that you can't get out let's not bring you out how many no God can do it I'm gonna know that god help me cannot just back off just a minute we are we all right with time I just want to give one little testimony just back up just to show you we're human and let's see brother so so this would have been about 26 years ago I was I was trying to get with a musician to learn and to you know increase my skills and and now he was a very good well-known musician he was Christian and and we would get together and pray and the brother was speaking tongues even before we you know anybody said brother he said with nothing except God do this and he was a real humble brother and I had met him and he said well you come to my house and and we'll get to practice together and I'll never forget it here told me where he lived and everything and no and so I went to try to find this house and you know and I was going on the road and I just driving and just constant driving you know and after a while the time got missing and then I thought man I'm not gonna make it all of a sudden I just y'all I just had to stop and say you know what I'm lost I'm not gonna find it I can't figure out where I am right in Columbia and Columbia and I thought Lord I said Lord and then I stopped and Paul and moved into a place and I got beside myself and I thought law I said my father I said Lord you see what I'm doing I said I'm going back and forth back and forth I can't find this guy house I wanted it bad now you got the only bad enough I'm gonna know what I'm talking about something you've got the walnut bad enough if it change on you and God won't work the way he used you know sometimes you ask prayers and before you finish the prayer whew make an answer then sometimes gotta say no I'm gonna see if you really want it how many know God will do you like that yes and I was then I really want I really didn't want to miss this event and I would say Lord I'm sitting here on the street I said the thing is I said you see me and you see the brother that I was the house that I'm trying to get to I said Lord you see his house I said father if you will put your eyesight into my eyes I said I could see where this house was I could get to it I said father I'm gonna try one more time and I begin to drive so I went back up and I've been going on the same road I just missing it couldn't see going back and forth driving back and forth driving back and forth and I said Lord I'm gonna try one more time I said you see it I said put my eyes get in my eyesight and show me what does your man's house is and I'm beginning to drive down the road and when I got down the road I saw a man sitting up I mean standing out the side of his yard raking the yard and y'all look but the man looked like the boy the man looked just like the boy did I was trying to come see you know the teacher that's trying to get headed lessons with he looked just like him I had to stop I mean he looked too much like him I mean he looked like they could have been twins and I stopped I said sir I said sir I'm so sorry so please I said I forgive me I said but I've been trying to find such and such and so um I said I've been going up and down this row I say I know around here somewhere he said you trying to find who I said so and so and so I said we supposed to have rehearsal he's supposed to get me a prize he said going in the house downstairs it's still the same yesterday today and forever God can take your eyesight cuz you think you can find it you think you can fight but God there's nothing like God finding it yes so when God want to move you to another level things you used to use don't don't cry like a baby said when I want it this way no going with what God want to do cuz I don't want to grow us higher how many ready to go hi Amy we're gonna stop just few minutes but I want to I want to give you this this push how God how Jesus did this it's such a delicate thing when the Holy Spirit shows me I sell old Jesus help us help us when the pastor rebuked us a loving pastor Oh y'all know we don't know how we get all right y'all see nothing all right 31 look at verse 31 Luke 22 chapter 22 verse 31 Simon Simon you know he called him second time because people don't hear you Oh church hey Simon Simon Satan has axed look at that row we said this morning Satan has axed I'm you thank God for that one word I'm here so glad now I didn't want him next but he did but I'm so glad that Jesus know about it I heard Jesus tell Simon Says Saint Simon Satan has asked to sift you as wheat how many know what a sister look like how many ever seen a sifter in here you know how anybody ever I'm real old-fashioned sisters sisters know I'm old-fashioned sister my mama had won back this side when she had the big kind and had the middle and that's all you get and a little sister I know we don't want it but Satan done axed in other words what is doing it's sitting it's that God won't find flour that's all gonna happen it's a little motion I know you want to go in pray one time and it lasts for 20 years it's not so brother I don't faster before when how many times how long how many know what I'm talking about sitting it's a little bit here Jesus told Simon said Simon said in an axe to sift you as wheat but remember this I have already taken care of it aren't you glad that God has already taken care you bout to have a bill but just don't forget I have already taken care of it oh I'm about to get sick but just remember by His stripes you are already healed my stripes we are already healed amen you bout to be tired of just know that amen God will sin men to untie you I'm no God can send me in to untie you yes all right so all right so this beautiful thing here what happened to verse 31 Simon I pray for that your faith won't fail and when you turn back stretching your brother's alright y'all know the story but verse 33 said but he replied Lord I'm ready to go with you to prison and go to go to death y'all know how Peter was yeah see Amen Cole Peter Lord helped the church amen and then verse 34 jesus answered I tell you Peter before the rooster crows today see he gave him a time watch closely gave him a time when things would change it would be a bad time for Peter you will deny me and I'm gonna tell you how many times you're gonna do it you're gonna deny me three times I'm gonna tell you when it's gonna happen let me know God is just that accurate Jesus braces Peter up right here to understand that a time would come for him like never before that his own testimony showed he had no clue of a turning point in his life right here was a turning point for Peters life right here amen probably all the disciples they didn't see it either but you know the scripture has already declared that all of them was gonna deny every one of them smite the Shepherd and the Sheep he's got every but one of them eventually what's gonna turn back and go back to fishing how many know that's the truth he said I won't go see begin see God begin the prophesied that a nighttime was coming in sometime when the night time come you can't see it nobody else can see it and God can blind the whole nation and none of them see it and God can blind everybody and everybody looking at everybody and can't see who they are I mean I know God blind it Israel for lying on Joseph Joseph's brother lied on him amen and the lie blinded them and Joseph was still alive on the earth just a few miles away daddy something happened to him we don't know don't you tell a lie get it right the thing blinded the boys where they couldn't know they could they'd believe the lie they beginning to believe that the brother was dead and how many know Joseph was not dead they sold him they told her daddy a lie it blinded him it was a night time for Joseph but God was working right away anyway and there he was standing before his own brothers and brothers so blind they couldn't even see him but he could see them so this night time came for Peter right here it came amen amen verses verse 35 and I want to I want to stop right here but I want you to see something interesting here I know you wouldn't believe that Jesus would do this but he did it I want to stop right this poor Emily get I wanna make it clear to you that sometimes you night season come and you think God would do it God will allow it but if he allows it he'll bring you through it if God like if you got put you to something so tough and so rough and you don't have answers and you can't come back to tell the church what God gonna do just stand still amen what's so precious he is right at this moment you can imagine what it felt like that Jesus you know we can agree that Peter was kind of close to Jesus now yeah all the disciples had their time with him but you know you know Peter was just that kind of guy and it's probably close to him and imagine what it was like Jesus pushing Peter away from him i watch the scripture unfold right here Jesus be tendancy night you fish to go through a trial Peter said don't forget I pray for you and here in verse 36 he said now I mean verse 35 then Jesus actually said now when I sent you we're gonna finish it just read this right these verses right here Jesus asked them when I sent you without purse bag or sandals did you lack anything how many know when Jesus first came in this Minister he told him don't take purse bag on Saturday I watched this we got the beginning of Jesus ministry telling him don't take these things but then in verse 36 he said to them but now if you have a purse take it and also obey and if you don't have a sward lord have mercy sell your cloak and buy one here is the same Jesus that told them don't take a purse don't take a saw how many I'll see it in the scripture now I didn't make it up look at your Bible cuz I this is a hard place for a preacher to get through cuz I don't want you to think I interpret this just look at what it says how many of y'all see that verse 35 verse 36 and verse 37 see verse 36 says but now if you have a purse do what take it and also a bag and if you don't have a slaught sell your cloak and buy one the same Jesus that told them don't take a purse don't take a bag don't take a swore it's telling them now take a purse take a bag go find your sward how many I'll see that he's pushing them into a night season don't you know they're getting trouble having Swann's don't you know Peter could turn around and blame Jesus say you know what if you want to told me to pick that straw back up I want to cut that man's help but it was a night time so he is the master author he got to set the seeds he's changing the scene cause it's about to be a life time and he had to push away them that loved him the most I'm gonna know that the eagle loves his own easily know your mom and daddy love you but I'm gonna know every now and then they got to make it hard on you so you won't think that this nest is your this ain't your nest this mine and the missus nest that went over some peoples here how many no that's the truth how many that's what the Eagles do they get all comfortable and she come by said no y'all two copper clean up because it won't be long clean up cuz it won't be long see that ego had to push them away why cuz it's time for them to fly don't you know we can't have all them big wings in one nest are we gonna fit hair Jesus beginning it took him away I know I told you to put those things away now I'm telling you pick him up almost III don't know how to it's so holy what I'm seeing is hard to put it in words yeah Jesus tell him to set themselves up and when none people those soldiers came by they looked like it looked like they were ready to fight no Jesus Father he set them up why because verse 37 it is written somebody say women it is written it is written and he was numbered with the transgressors and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me as holy as he was as righteous as he was there never was a man like Jesus never spoke a man what kind of man is this and now I got to act like a transgressor cuz there's the act it's the next act coming up yo y'all wit me everybody wit me he pushing the church away making it look like they you know that make him look like bad boys bad boys he make it look bad a because he with saws and his soldiers coming back a man standing there amen and when their soldiers come up to take him Peter got a sword don't you know Peter wouldn't I had that sward if Jesus when they told me to pick it back up but he told to pick it up why cuz they had to set the CIMA it's gonna be a nighttime but I'll tell you amen after the dark time too a time will come in the morning we've been indoors for a night but joy is gonna come in the morning whole little pita ain't me I had to look like a transgressive a man he had to go to bed scared thinking well I'm not gonna go to sleep and God make sure you go to sleep and had a crop beginning crow amen and he denying him before you know it he didn't done it one time not once and getting you know but two time he denied him three times he denied him you see it was a night time for Peter it was a night time for the disciples it was the night time for you know people said you know what this thing got to be a hoax it's not true and then when they put Jesus on the cross and stripped him they thought I'm sure this thing is the hope this can't be right and all of them went fishing all of them left God made a road of a mess I tell people God made that roll for all of us I called a road Emmaus to quit rolls some people take the quit road as well I'm going back to do what I want to do don't you do that but thank God for His mercy like any good shepherd would do he got on the road and called him so why are you walking you sad why you give up so quick descriptive got to be four there's got to be a night time I had to be numbered with the transgressors I had to be numbered with the sinners I had to act like I was a sinner he who knew no sin became sin that we might be the righteousness of God how many think God for that oh Jesus I hope you can see this well the Lord already said it Oh spirit said it you can't see it how many I'm gonna hold spirit said that this morning at the end of the service and that word Greek translated is continual sin doesn't mean that you won't see but it's impossible for God has never done something in your life and you continuing it how many know what I'm talking about you might fall you get back up how many know what I'm talking about but it's impossible he that is born of God to continually seeing all the over and over and over and over and over someone catch you I want to encourage you tonight that this was hard this was hard it's hard place for Jesus to put Peter in but he had to put Peter in the ground because Peter was gonna come up in just a few days coming to thank God it won't be long don't you worry about it you put him in that ground Peter came up if you give you a night time it's a planning if you'd be a dark hour and you don't have answers it's a planting so just get ready cuz rain sleet of snow that bleed gonna shoot up one lon oh brother you don't know how wild my children you don't know how wild children are peer you don't know how a while all of us was I'm gonna know what I'm to my but one day the light struck the blaze and it pop the cement how many no grass apoplexy man almost seeming is not gonna do it but it but if light hit it right hallelujah the Holy Ghost don't come up how many thank God for the words let's stop right there and give God a praise amen amen amen I want to stop right there because I want to end up I want to bring the next part of this and finish this up in here amen so I hope you encouraged and I don't worry about it's a nice scene in Scripture you got to have it you won't know everything and then you'll get so deep that you don't need God no the higher you go the more you need it amen how many know that amen and the higher you go you can't take everybody with you amen sometimes it'd be 12 then it'll get down to three then to get down it's just you and God I'm gonna know that's the truth I'm gonna thank God for the word Amen stand to your feet with me man amen stand to your feet it's a nice season I mean I believe it as a song about a something to God leads him along isn't it's something to water something to flood all through the fight but all through the blood something to fight a me in the night seasons he lead us along amen but God leads us a man he can tuck you away you don't know the answer just know that if he plants you in the night time you don't have answers no God is getting ready to do something how many think God for that a man I'll never forget that time my wife crying honey what are we gonna do when my son was born and everything was on the opposite side and everything was always was in vs. or whatever they call this medical term everything flipped all the way lungs overhead and however you know things that was supposed to be on the front was on the back of him you they had it going in open him up and flip it all around turn all right and put it back how many know God is a miracle worker but I'm here to tell you today to 12 years later amen Timothy is living it's a big healthy strong guy and the doctors talking say y'all take that boy at home saying we can't do nothing else for him says somehow his blue and red and blue blood cell blood oxygenated and uh knocks native blood is doing his own cleansing and we can't figure out take that bar on home how many know God is a miracle worker but in that night season I couldn't tell mama nothing I couldn't tell my wife I chew on it wonder why you think we may have seen you know people put in some types of no sir we're gonna stand firm I don't know what God is doing but I know he's up to something and when you get in the nighttime just know daytime go come a man do you love it Amen buy hits with me Amen yes church don't get discouraged Amen no matter what we we won't have all answers but God has all the answers I want you to take courage tonight sometimes God will push you in the ground cause he want to bring more glory out of here we'll push you down in there and cover you up and it seems like well Lord you hadn't used me in a long time just know it's a new season just to run the horizon for you God is getting ready to bring you to another level just know amen you don't know the answer but just sit quiet sit quiet in it don't take everybody with you this time amen god you're into something new sometimes you can't tell it cuz people talk it down you just have to tuck away sit quietly before God in the night season and God will come by like he did David David say Lord shall I go up god you know one time I lost said no don't he said Lord shall I go up he said go up told Joshua I have given this land to you already he told Abraham open your eyes and look to the east to North the south and the west as far as you can see that have I given to you if you can believe as far as your eyes can see out there that that's yours I have already given it to you you just got to put your foot on it in the night seasons let's pray father we thank you tonight thank you Father that you are the great Shepherd thank you Lord that you lead us in the paths of righteousness for your own namesake that even that when we walk in darkness that you can lead us you can make our hand feel that line Oh God you can in oh Jesus what it will be like the touch the line the right line and the move fault bring the church out of darkness into light god grant it to the church and she would totally depend on you even in a nice season in Jesus name Amen god bless you for that brother for groups I called my father no y'all heard you don't have to ask whether any of us have had experiences of night season you know and it's so key we will experience these seasons until Jesus comes so when you feel like you up on the mountain enjoy every morning because the night season is coming the valley is coming and you know I love the Lord because he tells us these things the Word of God says they get not strange when you fall into divers temptations knowing that the trial of your faith is more precious than gold we've come to be tested and sometimes I think we think that when we're Christians it's going to be easy I've never seen it where a man can carry a cross and call it easy and Jesus said if you are gonna be my disciples you must take up your cross and follow me sometimes we forget that we must experience those rain storms amen but understand that rain storm is just for you it helps you those roots to go deeper so we love the Lord in the word of God I appreciate the message this morning I appreciate the message now because we realize that every season will change yes that's what I love about it yeah you know I couldn't live in Alaska [Music] the season Shane from snow to more snow from coal DeMarco but I'm just glad that I live in a place where we can get awful awful yes because each peach season speaks to my heart y'all know how it is I know some people love snow and I'm so I'm gonna I just don't want to disappoint you but over there there is no snow snow is a perversion snow came by the fall amen now I want you to know that the temperatures a man was so beautiful and so perfect in HIDA they didn't have to wear clothes but will wear clothes this time but everything will be some regulated and after all of the day everything is over we'll live in a sin up in a city where the seasons won't affect us it will only affect those who are outside the city in that city we won't need no luck because the lamb will be the light you see it's a beautiful situation because where we will be there will be no changes we'll really see Jesus Christ as being the same yesterday today of ever he will be a constant he'll be we'll be in a place that we don't ever have to worry about a cloudy day is that right Oh God is good to us he changes everything for us and I'm so grateful for my brother speaking I missed out a little part because I had to go you know attend to some things but you know I thank God for the message this morning spoke so much to me till this change me it's I can't explain it I see it I understand it and and it has given me a greater hope if I could see it like that because sometimes you think you forget we all miss those chances but to know that there's another season there's another time there's another time where when you plant you reap but like I said if you don't plant nothing you don't get nothing right but if the seed is going down if you have planted and how do you plant your plant in prayer yeah you see them saying you you so you you claim things you you say god this is it that's that that and it has to happen and win that season calm those seeds of faith that have been planted has to produce the product exactly I think God and I'm gonna say this and closer you know when it comes to your relatives you never give up you fight like Abraham you may not have enough but a home but lot is coming back with me if that's what it be you understand me you don't give up on them God has set you in a priesthood and this priesthood you are the one that distributes the blood hello we're all your priesthood if they're going to escape they will seal it's gonna be by your prayer by you applying the blood for the velum center like this applying the token it doesn't matter how bad they look is anything too hard for God if he can raise a man that's been there for days rod it raised him up till he didn't even stake no more right every evidence of death was gone your situation may look like that the people that you so been praying for may look like they hopeless Alleluia it may look like a take it can't happen but there's a time yeah there's a season there's a sawing time and there's a reaping time yeah right and that's all we have to do all sake of God if our fathers is a farmer we're ordained to be farmers spiritual farmers planting sowing and reaping and we thank God for His grace we thank God for our precious brother and I just want to say to you you know even if you know right now crazy things are happening right sometimes the storms look like me gonna flood everything out but God has built a standard one thing I love about Jerusalem Jerusalem was a walled city and as long as Israel did right before God no enemy could come now that camp everything was destroyed and I'm saying you knew Jerusalem y'all hear what I'm saying you might go through some some seasons but like the brother said you always come out as a winner I'm sorry I I said like this I believe I believe the script when Paul said I'm more than a conqueror I believe that not just for me but for my whole house I believe that I'm more than a conqueror I believe I'm more than a conqueror brother just if I'm a king I got a kingdom you read it and just like Jesus has a kingdom I have a kingdom and one day my kingdom which is his kingdom we sit at the table of his kingdom but he gave me a portion of here and that's the way I look at it by God's grace his kingdom is there my kingdom in his kingdom it will be his kingdom and we'll be there right he made us kings and priests I could say the same thing I'm not even I don't know what he finished on Joe but you say Joe it wasn't all about Joe God started God finished it yes and then he looked over there and gave Joe rewards for being used by him in the bath hey don't think you're not gonna have a reward for fighting gods battle is that right yeah see God is the spirit you know we we can't see him in that follow but he choose us right he wanted the Angels and everybody to see what with behind the scene there were Lucifer and how we come down here in God seasons in God's time and we know if the devil go to defecate we he's ordained to fake you're the winners your danger wins I don't care what it looks like oh I'm leaving this word I ain't messing with this necess no board on that listen you don't hear the devil's lie is that right joe says woman you sound foolish you don't sound like my wife I love that you know God because Joe recognized his wife was not talking like Jesus recognized that wasn't Peter and he said Satan I rebuke you when you hit it your love was talking nonsense and you know they've been raised in this word you tell the devil you don't sound like my daughter you don't sound like my son because that is not your daughter that is not your son that is the inspiration of the devil if you don't see the devil you go see flesh and blood and the Bible says we wrestle not against flesh and blood it's spiritual wickedness you don't feel nothing when Satan comes around and try to throw his bluff on you don't fear him you look at that devil and say hey I know who you are and it ain't gonna stop me from praying and it ain't gonna stop me from believing you love the Lord surely God is good to us in his time [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] God leads us along in shady
