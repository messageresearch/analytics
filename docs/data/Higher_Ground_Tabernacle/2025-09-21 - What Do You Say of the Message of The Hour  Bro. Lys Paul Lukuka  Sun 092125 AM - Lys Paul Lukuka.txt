Oh, was I true and free from all sin. Oh, I will shout and I will sing when the redeemed are gathering in. Amen. When the redeemed are gathering in, you know, the message of the hour came to redeem us back to the positions of sons and daughters of God. You know, and how many are happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's open our Bibles to the book of John, chapter 14. Thank you for the songs and the And about the when the redeemed are gathered in the Bible says that wherever two or three are gathered in his name he's going to be there. So when the redeemed gather that brings the presence of Jesus. &gt;&gt; John chapter 14 verse 18 to 19 The Bible says, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more. But ye, the redeemed will see me, because I leave, you shall live also." And let's turn to Matthew 16. verse 13 to 20 &gt;&gt; the Bible says when Jesus when Jesus came into the coast of Cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do m whom do whom do men say that I the son of man am? And they said, "Some say there are John the Baptist, some Elias, and others Jeremiah's and or one of the prophets." &gt;&gt; And he said unto them, "But whom say ye that I am?" &gt;&gt; And Simon Peter answered and said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered and said unto him, "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee, but my father which is in heaven." &gt;&gt; Amen. And I say unto thee, thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our head. &gt;&gt; Dear heavenly father, Lord Jesus, we come before you this morning in your precious name. the the only name that we can pray to, Lord. &gt;&gt; The only name in which you have placed a the place of worship, Lord, &gt;&gt; the name in which we are saved, the name by which we have our redemption, the name that has been raised above all names. That father at the mention of the name of Jesus Christ every knee shall bow. &gt;&gt; Lord that's why I mention your name this morning because father we want every knee to bow this morning so that you may have the preeminence. Lord Jesus forgive us of our shortcomings. Wash us with your blood Lord Jesus. And father Lord you know why your children came this morning. Lord, they worked all week. &gt;&gt; Lord, they could have just decided to stay home and rest today. But they came here, Lord, to hear from you, Lord Jesus. They did not come to hear from me, but to hear from the God who created them. Lord Jesus, I pray that you, Father, Lord God, uh, uh, give them what they what they came to hear. I pray, Father Lord, that you speak to their hearts, that you hear through their ears. &gt;&gt; And Father Lord, I submit myself to you as well, Lord Jesus. Lord, I give everything that I am unto you and have your own way, Lord Jesus. And I bind every spirit of unbelief in the name of Jesus Christ. And I pray that you anoint the word, Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; because the Bible says it's the anointing that breaks the yolks. &gt;&gt; Lord, we want we want the yolks to be broken this morning, Lord Jesus. In the name of Jesus Christ, I pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And may you may have your seats. &gt;&gt; My title this morning is going to be, &gt;&gt; what do you say of the message of the hour? Or I can say what do you see in the message of the hour? You know when someone says when someone says I believe the message of the hour when someone says I am a message believer. What does that mean? Remember the question that Jesus asked Peter at first he was like what do other people say? Peter said that oh some say that you are Elias or other Jeremiah or this and that or one of the prophets you know Jesus didn't stop there. Then he he's like okay but let's not ask about what other people say of me about you. Whom say you that I am? The Bible tells us that Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; I was reading a place where the prophet says that the same Jesus that walked on Galilee is the same Jesus Christ tonight in the brand tabernacle. And I also say that same Jesus Christ that was in the brand tabernacle is the same Jesus Christ here this morning. And Jesus the same way he asked Peter, he's also asking you this morning this morning, what do you say of the message of the hour? What is your revelation of the message of the hour? A lot of people they just we just come and we just say, "Oh, I believe the message." But what is truly the message? &gt;&gt; Amen. And because it's a it's a it's a revelation. Because Jesus said to Peter that flesh and blood has not revealed this to you. &gt;&gt; So you have to understand that godly things are not revealed by flesh and blood. They are revealed by God himself. That's why you got to make sure you have a good connection with God. You got to make sure you have a good fellowship communion with God. because only then that he can reveal to you his who who truly this messages. That's the question I ask everyone this morning including myself. If someone came to you was like I I've always heard I'm a message believer. What does that mean? What are you going to tell that person? Are you going to say, "Oh, let me call Brother Brooks and ask him a little bit." &gt;&gt; What if that person only had five? You were, for instance, a nurse at a hospital or in your workplace or wherever you may be, you may be walking on the street and someone had an accident and you go to hell, the person is like, &gt;&gt; "I've always heard people talk about the message of the hour. You know, I only have a few minutes left on earth. What is the message of the hour? What are you going to tell that person? Cuz the message has to be reflected in you. You don't have to wait to to to start calling your your father, your mother to say, "Oh, what is the message?" So we see that Jesus got to a place and he asked his disciple whom do others says that that that I am. You know you noticed what others were saying was not the true revelation of who Jesus Christ was. The true revelation of who Jesus Christ had was something that was personally revealed to Peter. You can never have the revelation of this message to what other people are saying of this message. You truly know the message of the hour when the message of the hour reveals itself to you. And the message came not just to be preached or not just to be said in the mouth, but it's to be believed. And I I read a place where the prophet says the kind of life you live shows the kind of revelation you have. &gt;&gt; So many of us says we believe the message but do we leave the message because the Bible Jesus says that if you love me you will keep my commandments. A lot of usually quotes that that that place where the prophet says that God says that all you ever loved and all that ever loved you, I have given them to you. &gt;&gt; But if you truly and that that that's that quote is very true. If you truly love the prophet or the message of the hour, what will happen is that you will do what the prophet says to do. That's why Jesus says that you you are known to be my disciples by the love you have one towards another not by what you say but by by the way you act no others there different interpretation of the message and what you notice is that in that interpretation one Peter says some says you are one of the prophets That was true. &gt;&gt; You know Jesus was one of the prophets. &gt;&gt; But the difference was that that was if only Peter the difference is that when he says you are one of the prophets that was he was just repeating what others were saying. How do you know the message of the hour is real? I know it's real, but are you just repeating that the message is real because people say, &gt;&gt; brothers, the message did not come to just say the message is real. Leave me a message. The prophet even says, I rather have a man pre leave me the message than preaching me a message. Because you cannot live higher than your testimony. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just bear with me a little bit. I came up with this message yesterday. I was going to preach something else, but I just felt led to go this direction. &gt;&gt; So when Jesus came, you know, a lot of them knew that the Messiah was supposed to come. They were even singing, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" in the temples, &gt;&gt; in the synagogues, &gt;&gt; but they miss to see that that that that prophecy was living in their age. Why? Because their eyes were blinded. Why? Because the father had not revealed who Christ was to them. So that that's why in order to to to understand what uh in order to um because the title the one of the title that I title is what do you see in the message of the hour but you only know the value of the message of the hour or what it is if you actually know its characteristics. You have to know what is the message supposed to do. What is even the message of the hour? When the prophet preached on the message the Holy Ghost, the prophet says uh what he started by preaching what was the Holy Ghost given for. Why? Because he says that some you have to know what you are looking for so that you know the value it brings. A lot of us don't value the message because we don't have the revelation of what the message is. The message is very important for this hour. I'll go through it. You understand why it's very important. Without the message of the hour, you will not make the rapture. Without the message of the hour, you will stay behind. But the message is not a book. The message are not tapes. The message is the spirits that was on the tapes. &gt;&gt; That spirits that was on the tapes that's that has to be lived in you. &gt;&gt; You know the the the the devil doesn't care if you just quotes the message. The devil doesn't care if you just quotes the Bible. But he's scared when you start seeing that that quotes become alive in you. If you want to check the devil this morning, just start leaving the word. Be a witness that God has sent a prophet in this generation. Don't just say God has sent a prophet, but show it by the way you live, by the way you dress, by the way you carry yourself in the church, you know, because this message is a message of perfection, you know. It's a message that when the Bible Paul says that we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect comes &gt;&gt; and I was reading a place where the prophet says humbly as I can say this is the perfect interpretation of the word of God. What is the message of the hour? It's the perfect interpretation of the word of God. Don't go look at other places for the revelation of the word. The revelation of the word is found in the message of God. Billy Graham doesn't have the me the revelation of the word. &gt;&gt; Martin Luther could have had a revelation in his day, but the revelation progresses. The message of Luther cannot take you to the rapture today. The message of Luther will take those in Luther's time to the rapture. But you you that which is perfect. And the word is perfect. The word is perfect. &gt;&gt; What does the the Bible in Malachi says? He will restore us to the faith of our sins. &gt;&gt; The message of the hour is a message of restoration. &gt;&gt; It's the message that throughout the ages the enemy tried to to to kill the word of God. He tried to kill the influence of the word. &gt;&gt; The devil tried to kill the influence of the word on the believers. But God had promised that in the evening time there shall be lights. That's not a partial light, but that's the great light. That's the same lights that shine in in Genesis. That's the same life that the Bible says, "Let there be lights." That's the same light that was in the pillar of fire. That's the same lights that appeared to Paul. The Bible says the message of the hour in the end time is bringing back the pillar of fire in the church. That's what the message of the hour is. The pillar of fire among God's people. Brothers and sisters, when you you speak the message of the hour, when you leave the message of the hour, &gt;&gt; the pillar of fire is present. That same pillar of fire that appeared to Paul. You have been received the grace not just to hear about it, but to see it. There is a reason why God let the pillar of fire be photographed. The reason is to let you know that now we are living in an age. God is among his people where the pillar of fire is among the people of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But the pillar of fire is only in God's camp. The denominations don't have it. &gt;&gt; The pillow of fire went knocking on the door, but they're not opening the door. When the angel comes, when he sees the blood, he will pass over. But when there were darkness in all the land of Egypt, everywhere there was there was thick, the Bible says thick darkness upon the land. And the pre the message, the prophet preached a message, the third Exodus. And as it was in the time of Moses, it is right now darkness in the land. The Bible like like the word right has become wrong and wrong has become right. When the prophet was preaching the message the seven church ages, the angel of the Lord came and started drawing the church ages. And you could see how the darkness started to take over the church. And he got to a place where he felt like it was going to be complete darkness in the church. But then God always keeps his word. He says that in the evening time when there's darkness in the land in the camp I the pillar of fire is in the midst of that's why the mighty angel had to come down who is the mighty angel is the pillar of fire among his god allowed himself to be photographed because he wants to to have witnesses He wants science to also witness. It's in an age where it's not just oh the pillow far about things that just cannot be seen. In this age, God is seen. Hallelujah. There is even a reason why if you go to Washington DC, &gt;&gt; you will see this picture there because it's proven that it's a supernatural supernal thing. [Music] &gt;&gt; But the mistake that many people do, they leave the pillar of fire in the picture. Brothers, this pillow of fire did not let to be photographed to stay on the picture. But he came to indicate the message of the hour. I want to tell you that he wasn't a prophet speaking, but he was just a microphone that God was using to speak to his people. And when God says anything, when I receive it, I receive a blessing behind it. Blessed is he that keeps the word of this book. Blessed is he that reads and meditates this book this book day and night. Brothers, what is the message of the hour? &gt;&gt; It's God among his people. It's God back in this age among his people. Not just a God of yesterday, but the prophet says he came to vindicate that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. that just in yesterday's message that is not the message of the hour. If you believe in just a message that's for tomorrow, that's not the message of the hour. If you believe for a message that just for today, that is not the message of the hour. The message is the same yesterday, today, and forever. What Jesus did when he was walking in Galilee is the same this morning, walking in this church. Jesus did when he met the the the the woman who was prostitute she was full of sin but he said go and see no more that same message is here this morning saying that though your sins may be red as a sconeless but I'm here proclaiming to you go and sin no more because I am the same Lord Jesus Christ of the Bible the same Lord Jesus Christ that was with William Brana and Same with his people. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The prophet preached a message. If God be with us, then where are the mirrors? God cannot be with you and you don't know it. Hallelujah. God was with the prophet William Brham. Everybody that came across across with him across him in contact with him they know that he had something different even those people even Tommy I was born all those people they testify we have never seen anything like &gt;&gt; so the people needs to also be able to say that there's something different with the bride because have that which is perfect. So how do you have that which is perfect and be the same with that which is not perfect? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The the word see means to understand. &gt;&gt; What do you see in this message? That means what do you understand of this message? Young young brothers and sisters, you know, is the message that's something that you grew up under. made real to you. &gt;&gt; And if it's not yet real to you, ask God to reveal to you what this message is. Once you have the revelation of what this message is, the Bible says, "The gates of hell shall not prevail against it. I may not finish this message today if I don't." No, it's very important to have a revelation. You can only know this message with the revelation of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; In the message, the rapture. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 73. &gt;&gt; What is the message of the hour? The prophet says, he said, "Flesh and blood never re revealed this to you, but my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you. &gt;&gt; Upon this rock, I will build my church." Now notice he says the revelation of the word in its season. &gt;&gt; I will build my church and the gates of hell cannot prevail against it. &gt;&gt; What is Christ building his church upon? The revelation of the word in its season. That is why you need the message of the hour because it is the revelation of the word in our season. the message of Noah. If you building your church based on the message of Noah, that's not the church of Christ. If you are building your message based on the message of Luther, that's not the church of Christ. It was back in the in the in the age. &gt;&gt; But today, God is building his church on the revelation from Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In this season, what is a season? &gt;&gt; A season is a period of the year that is distinguished by special climate conditions. You know, in other words, you can say that a season there are like ages. Even in life, there's what called the season of life. &gt;&gt; You first came in as a baby. There's a season where you're a baby and then you become an adolescent, young adult, and then you become an adult. &gt;&gt; There are seasons. &gt;&gt; So, God is also building his church through seasons. God is building his church through seven church ages. He's building a body &gt;&gt; and during those season God is building a church on the revelation of the word for that season. In a message, the talking the prophet says it doesn't matter what you are, how good you are, how many times you've jumped up and down, how many churches you've joined, how many good things you've done. It won't mean one thing to you if the token isn't applied. This is the evening time. He worked all right in the days of Luther. &gt;&gt; In the days of Luther, the message was different. &gt;&gt; In the message of Luther, you could have made it without the talking. That worked all right in the days of Wesley, but it don't work now. Right now, you need the talking applied to you. The message of the hour is applying the token. The prophet says it was the highlight of my ministry. &gt;&gt; It's the highlight of the ministry of the hour. &gt;&gt; What is a highlight? You know, if you watch, for instance, a sport game, &gt;&gt; a game like a soccer, if you didn't get a chance to watch an entire game, the game can be summarized through highlights. You can go to YouTube and you watch the highlights to have an idea of the game. So the prophet is saying if you never have a chance to listen to the entire messages that I preached but if you listen to the talking you will know that this is the message of the hour. What is the message? What is the talking? Applying the blood in your house. &gt;&gt; Applying the blood in your lives. And the the thing is it's not just saying that I applied the blood, &gt;&gt; but God only gives you the token when he's received you. &gt;&gt; You may say, "I believe the message of the hour." That's good. That's what you say. &gt;&gt; But what does God say about it? Has he received your faith yet? And when God receives your faith, he gives you the token. And the prophet says that's what the message of the hour is. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; that's why you, he says, it might have worked back then, &gt;&gt; but right now to make it to the rapture, &gt;&gt; you need the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; You need the message of the hour. You know the the in the exposition of the seven church age is the prophet says &gt;&gt; no man knows the things of God save the spirits of God and he to whom the spirit of God reveals them to whom the spirit of God reveals them. You need a good fellowship with the spirit of God. He says we need to call on God for revelation more than anything else in the world. I'm reading the prophet. We need to call on God for revelation more than anything in the world. The prophet says we have accepted the Bible. We have accepted the great truth of it. &gt;&gt; But it still is not real to most people because the revelation by the spirit is not there. The word has not been quickened. We believe the truth of the Bible. We believe the truth of the message. We still don't see being live in us. &gt;&gt; Why the prophet says is because the revelation by the spirit is not there. &gt;&gt; That's why it's the it's the most important thing that you can ask God. There's even another place where the prophet says I I only pray if God could reveal to you give you the revelation of the importance of the Holy Ghost. So in order for you to even be desperate for the Holy Ghost, God has to reveal to you what the Holy Ghost is. So that's why you have to ask God for revelation. The importance of revelation by the spirits to a true believer can never be overemphasized. So the prophet says, I can preach on revelation every Sunday and that's not still not going to be enough. He says now I'm not talking about this book of re revelation and you talking about all the revelation. So the revelation of the word in our season &gt;&gt; is important. Mothers when you when you are raising your children what are you going to tell them about the message of God but you know what are you going to tell them if yourself you don't have the revelation of God of the message but the Bible says you have not because you ask not if you ask God for revelation Lord I'm raising my family what is the revelation of the word for how a family is supposed to be raised. You know the message of the hour came to be applied to every aspect of our lives even in how we do businesses. The prophet preached on the message investment and in that message he also talks how a good person is supposed to do business. The prophet is saying never go for those investment that they that just they promise you things overnight. We hear about all those stories like like there was something that happened recently with a lot of African you know the LLC something &gt;&gt; no or those kind of things &gt;&gt; and a lot of Africans jumped really quick after it. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I even read I because they were they were talking to me about it and I and I went to do my research &gt;&gt; and I could see out in the research they're saying that they are targeting African people because they know we came from a lot of us came from like we didn't have good good background back we didn't have money. We we tremble before money. if they just tell us, "Oh, there's an opportunity to make 30,000 jump real quick to it." &gt;&gt; But the Bible says, uh, uh, uh, Proverbs 3:5, "Lean not unto your own understanding, but acknowledge him in all that you do, and then he will direct your path." You know, a lot of us, we jump real quick into it, &gt;&gt; but we forgot to acknowledge God. &gt;&gt; You you forgot to get a revelation of of the message for what a business is supposed to be like. &gt;&gt; Don't listen to the message investment. If you're thinking about starting a business, listen to the message. The prophet says, "Don't go for things that promise you things overnight." The Bible says, "My people perishes for lack of knowledge." We have people that lost thousands of dollars &gt;&gt; because you forgot to filter that through the word. Maybe maybe if you had prayed about it, God could have directed you because I don't think you are having losing thousands of dollars. I don't want to lose. So now the Bible says, &gt;&gt; does he say God came to steal, kill, and destroy? &gt;&gt; The devil came to steal. What is steal? It's something that belongs to you. And now he came and he took it. You worked very hard. You did overtime and work. And now all your money you take it and you gave it to someone who is probably chilling in China over there. I mean the Bible doesn't lie. You perish for lack of knowledge. In other words, you perish for lack of revelation. You know this message came to perfect us. You know what Satan does is he he he looks he knows each and every one of our weaknesses. &gt;&gt; And he knows that African people, &gt;&gt; if you just go with a promise that tomorrow you I'll you invest 30,000 you'll have &gt;&gt; to me even the thought of it was very ridiculous. &gt;&gt; You know one time I heard someone mention I think if you invest like 30,000 or something you'll have like a million of dollars. You know, I kept asking myself, I was like, I think one of them was a business about scooter or something. &gt;&gt; I didn't plan this, so I just I'm just going to go out this lady. I was like, what kind of a if I looked up how much a scooter cost online? So, I was like, so how come you are going to make millions of dollars for just investing this money? them. How you would make profit out of that? Brother, I'm here to tell you it was the devil. Your money, God gave it to you for a good purpose. God gave you your money. You have to be a good steward of God's money. That's why the prophet is against gambling. &gt;&gt; The prophet is against gambling. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he says that when God gives you money, he expect you to be responsible with the money. &gt;&gt; This is God speaking. It's really not in my notes. You have to be responsible with the way God not just you ask God for a child. You ask God for children, you have to be responsible for the children that God gave you. Because if God never give you a children, you would have been crying and God give me a child. But now God has given you a child. God is giving you children, but you giving them to daycarees, &gt;&gt; you know. And now you you saying, "God, give me a child." so someone else can raise the child. That's not a perfect will of God. I might even say one thing. I'm not against women working. I am not against it. But we have to understand the Bible, the prophet has taught us on the perfect will and the permissive will. I'm just going to repeat the message. Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet said that the perfect will of God for a woman is to be stay mom. The perfect will of God is for you to take care of your children because you are the sixth gospel to your children. There is no one that can raise your children like the mother can. To be honest, even the dad cannot raise the children the way the mom did. &gt;&gt; And then there's another quote where now the prophet is talking about the permissive will of God where he says that I can understand circumstantially even at if so it's conditional. If you need to help your husband financially, you know, you need to help him, you guys need to pay the bills and all that, it's okay for you to go work, but that's the permissive will of God. And another thing I will say too, I you know, a lot of us live in the permissive will of God because we choose to. It I it just doesn't make sense to me that God will say this is my perfect will but he says I know you won't be able to do it and I'm also not going to help you figure it out on your own. That's not the God that's not the God I believe in. If God says you're supposed to do one thing, the prophet says if I'm trying to reach somewhere with a ladder and I cannot reach it, get a bigger ladder, go higher so you can reach it. So what I was about to say is that a lot of us find ourselves that we cuz I understand sometimes you really have to work both husband and wives but most of the time is because you choose to live above your means. You choose to leave. Imagine you choose. Nobody forced you. You purposely choose to to live above what what you are comfortable. Now that's why you feel like now okay I have to go work. &gt;&gt; Yes, you have to go work. &gt;&gt; You need to take care of those kids. But you have to understand that you know when God gives a permissive will like it's there's something that's lacking in that permissive will for instance it wasn't it wasn't the perfect will of God for us to come through through sex he allowed his permissive will he produce there is sin So just because God says it's permissive doesn't mean that okay I'm going to choose to do it permissive you have to understand what are the consequences that come with this permission living above your means and what happened now when you go both the husband and the wives go work you have to sacrifice one thing &gt;&gt; what is that one thing now it's the education of your children If it's not the education of your children, it's the harmony between the husband and wife. Why? Because the husband has to go to work from 8 to 5 so that the wife stays home and takes care of the kids and then the wife goes to work at night. Now you don't you don't barely even see each other. But you notice when when the prophets preach on the message uh the choosing of a bride, you know, he he he he preached a message showing that the marriage, our physical marriage is a is supposed to be a reflection of the marriage of God. God said he wouldn't leave you comfortless. God says if you are weak tired come unto me and I will give you husband sometimes your wife go and she's very tired she goes to work and she comes home she has to take care of the children again she has to cook she has to clean the house and you just there like a king. That's not a reflection of God's love to his bride because God says, "I will give you rest. I I I I cannot speak on that because I'm not a mother, &gt;&gt; but I'm sure mothers here know &gt;&gt; that it it is actually a full-time job to take care of children. I like I remember growing up, I'm not saying that it's like everybody is supposed to do it, &gt;&gt; but my my dad, &gt;&gt; he used to even give a salary to my mom. She like because my mom wanted to work &gt;&gt; but my dad was like we need to take care of the children. &gt;&gt; So he's like stay home. I will pay you whatever you were supposed to get out there because it's a job. And if you truly love your wife, you don't want her to be tired all the time. Children also be nice to your parents. Don't give them a hard time. Sometimes dad and mom have to go work because they they made a choice to live above their means. But don't make life harder for them. Now be good children. Help your mom at home. When mom comes back from work, do the dishes, you know, &gt;&gt; clean the house. The message of the hour came to restore to true sons and daughters, &gt;&gt; true parents. &gt;&gt; That's the word. It's that which is perfect. &gt;&gt; We live in a time where we need perfection in every aspect of life. No Jeremiah says that I can't my plans for you is is not my place for you is to prosper. So you define what prosper is to you. But God is here this morning to prosper you. &gt;&gt; The message of the hour came to prosper you. Brother didn't have to talk about investment. But what did he do? He knew that there would be some people that would need those advices. So what you take away from it is don't jump for quick investments. &gt;&gt; You need to be patient in life. Actually if you you know if you actually study business you will see that the stat shows that a true business usually takes off within three to five five years. It's never tomorrow that the business just takes off. And in case you didn't know, those that want to be entrepreneur, I'm not an entrepreneur. &gt;&gt; But I know one thing about investment is only invest what you are comfortable losing. So you cried because you you like maybe lack of knowledge. &gt;&gt; Go seek help. go seek for like help from people that have been successful investing. That was off my notes, but I believe God wanted it. So, let's get back on topic. &gt;&gt; In the message, Christ is the mystery of God revealed. Paragraph 234, the prophet says, "What is the new birth?" Then, &gt;&gt; you'll say, "Well, brother Brandham, what is the new birth? He says it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you. Now you join a church. You shook a hand. You done something different. You said a creed. You promised to live by a code of rules. That's what the message of the hour is to a lot of people. It's just a code of rules. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm supposed to wear a a long dress. Oh, I'm supposed to do this. I'm supposed to do that. And I promise to live by those rules. That's not the message of the hour. That's not the new birth. The prophet says, "But Christ, the Bible, &gt;&gt; he is that word that was revealed to you." &gt;&gt; And no matter what anybody says, &gt;&gt; what takes place, &gt;&gt; it's Christ, &gt;&gt; pastor, &gt;&gt; priest, whatever it might be, &gt;&gt; it's Christ in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; So your revelation of the message is not what the pastor just tells you in the pulpit. The revelation of the message is not just what I'm preaching to you, but it's when God personally is revealed to you, then you know you are born again. So the new birth is not just jumping and getting those are good. But the new birth is when Jesus is personally revealed to you, not by what the pastor says. That's why we have people, you know, one minister will come in the pulpit, he preaches one thing and then you go with that side. Another minister comes, he preaches one thing, you go with the other side. You know, moved from preaching to preaching, church to church to church. You know, &gt;&gt; but that's not the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; And also those other people say the message of the hour is just play tapes. Just press play. You can't press play 24/7. And if God doesn't personally reveal this to you, himself to you, it's all in vain. So ask God what you can take from this message. Ask God reveal to me what is the message of the king. What I'm doing right now, I'm not trying to reveal it to you. I'm preaching you the importance of knowing that you need to have your own revelation because I cannot reveal it to you. Blessed blood has not revealed this to you, but my father which is in heaven has revealed this to me. you know, let's keep reading this, you know, and he says it's Christ, you know, he says, um, you you said I'm a Lutheran. I'm a Baptist. That don't mean, &gt;&gt; you know, it's Christ being revealed and he is the word. And when the word is revealed, it expresses itself. &gt;&gt; Let's read that again. When the word is revealed in you that the prophet didn't say you express it. Why? Because you can try to fake it but the word itself will express itself. So examine your life. Has the word been revealed to you? Is the word being expressed in your life? it expresses itself. &gt;&gt; You you won't force it. That's something you can that's not something you can fake. [Music] That's why Paul says make sure your make sure the uh make your elections and calling sure how by seeing the word expressing itself in your life. Someone hurts you. Someone does something really evil to you and you want to you really want to just go like confront that person so bad but then the word expresses itself in you and you forgive the person. You know &gt;&gt; you have a problem that comes in in your life. You want to get weary and all those things but then the word expresses itself to you. How does the word express to you? It says peace be still. God is a God of peace. &gt;&gt; The Bible says he's a he's a counselor, Prince of peace. &gt;&gt; Lord, I want your word expressed in my life. Lord, express yourself in my life. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Christ God died in flesh. You know, let's skip the verse paragraph uh 237. And if a man says he's born again and tries to place these promises of Christ in in these last days to some other age, making him Christ yesterday but not today, then that man or that person has been a delusion by Satan. You've been in a delusion. If God has never revealed himself to be the God of today, we read a lot of stories in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Are you able to write one story about your life? If you cannot write a single story of how God has been revealed to you, how he's he's the same today, you are living in a delusion by Satan. If you think that you are like the me the message has to be lived. &gt;&gt; I know that God is real. &gt;&gt; I know there was I remember I was I was talking to a brother. I think one time he he he went to the prayer line so that he can get he needed some money. &gt;&gt; And then I think Isaac was preaching and he prayed for him. And when I was singing the brother, the brother is telling me, &gt;&gt; you know, God is real. No, God is real. God, &gt;&gt; that's the God that we serve. &gt;&gt; In case you didn't know, I'm here to tell you this morning that God is real. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. No, he he didn't die just to and stay dead. He rose again. &gt;&gt; He says uh making delusion. And if that man says that he believes that and it doesn't manifest itself to you say you believe the message of the hour but the message of the hour is not manifesting itself in your life. The prophet says you are living in a delusion by Satan. &gt;&gt; So I don't know what kind of message you are believing. &gt;&gt; Maybe the message of the table.exe maybe the message of let me even maybe the message of William Brham. This message is not the message of William Brandon. If you have the revelation that this is the message of William Brham, then you are lost. Because if you build your church, your house on the message of a man, you will not. But if you build your revelation on Christ, if you build your life on Christ, the winds may come, the tempest may may come, but you will stand. You know, there's there's a wave that's going on around the message now. A lot of people are leaving the message. A lot of people, even pastors, are leaving the message. people that have been pastorred for 30 years, 20 years with vindication in their ministry. &gt;&gt; You know, great teachers praying for people, people getting healed. 30 years later, they come and they say, "I don't believe the message." They said that was they starting now. They start disputing everything that brother Brandham said. If you were if your faith was built on that pastor, what a disappointment. &gt;&gt; You know, I'm I'm like if that even if that was me, if I was putting my faith on a man like that and I see that he leaves the message, it's going to shake me, you know? I would be like, like, is this message really the truth? Where have we been living? Where have we been been living all these years? That's why you see those people, they don't just leave alone. &gt;&gt; They also have a way for people that follow them. So if your revelation of the message is built on what a pastor preached you, what if that pastor today decided to leave the message? Will you also leave the message? You will if you never had that revealed by God. &gt;&gt; I'm not even saying you might know. I'm promising you you will if God never revealed you. But when your revelation is based on Christ, the solid rock. The Bible say the song says on Christ the solid rock I stand. All other ground is seeking stand. But on Christ the solid rock I stand. Brothers and sisters, stand on the solid rock. Let Christ reveal himself to you personally. Then even if 30 million people leave the the message of the hour, even if the entire earth left the message of the hour, I know for myself &gt;&gt; that this message is the truth. I know for myself it's the truth. &gt;&gt; But are you able to say that &gt;&gt; today? If the entire world forsook this message, what where will you stand? What is going to be your stand? I remember myself when I was I was studying at Kirkwood &gt;&gt; when God was really burning so so hard in my heart that I could even skip my classes &gt;&gt; and just go to my car and pray and listen to the message a fire a fiery desire of God in me and I remember I was studying the seven church age and I got through the seventh church age And it just seems like everything clicked all of a sudden. &gt;&gt; I was in the car. We had a van at that time &gt;&gt; and I remember it seems like it's not a vision but it's like I could see a like an image. God studied in the age in the in the uh with Paul and it's like I could see like a light that's going through our ages and the light is on. And I remember I had my hand in my Bible like this and it seems like all of a sudden it's like whoa. It seems like this is the light. And I was like oh my god this is that same light. And then all of a sudden I got in the spirit and I started shouting. And from that time I was like I don't care even if anybody else this message &gt;&gt; God has revealed to me that this message is the truth. That is my witness. That's what came in my I was like I don't care even if the whole world left this message. I know for a fact that this message of the hour is the truth. But I didn't have to force it. God revealed this to me. &gt;&gt; On Christ the solid rock I stand. All the ground is seeking stand. But I stand on the revelation of the word for our season. Rather stand on the revelation of the word for this season. If you stand on the revelation of the word for this season, the gates of hell shall not prevail against you. If you stand on this message, even if you go in colleges that are full of demons, you will be like me, Shadrach, and Abednego who stood on the message of their hour. And God came down himself. If you stand on the message of the hour, when the enemy is attacking you, God himself is going to come down to rescue. God is your refuge. When you believe the message of the hour, God is your strength. When you believe on the message of the hour, God is your provider. When you believe on the message of the hour, &gt;&gt; I've been young. The Bible says, "I have been old. I've been young, but now I'm old. I've never seen a righteous forsaken." When you believe on the message of the hour, God says, "A little world, the world will see me no more." But you, you have received the light. You have received the message of the hour. You will see me because I will be with you, but not just in you, but the same pillar of fire. Hallelujah. The same pill of fire shall be in you. When the pill of fire is in you, all things become possible. When the pill of fire is in you, all the mountains has to to to God. When the pill of fire is in you, every knee shall bow. Why? Because the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is in you. When the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is you, there's not a single gate that can stand against you. Brothers, I'm encouraging you. Take the message in your heart. Apply the message of Yahweh in your life. Don't ever be ashamed of this message. This is your power of salvation. This is your power of of rapture. That is rapturing faith. It's not elsewhere. Rapturing faith is in this message. If the devil is tormenting you, take the message of the hour and says house of house of hell, give away The message of the hour is a message of deliverance. The message of the hour will break the chains of the enemy. It doesn't matter the strength of those chains. It doesn't matter how long you have been addicted to that. But when you take the message of the glory in your heart, that chain has to be broken. That chain has to be broken. The chains of lust has to be broken. The chain of sickness has to be broken. The chain of worry has to be broken. The chains of anxieties have to be broken. The chains of depression has to be broken. The chains of alcohol has to be broken. Nothing. I said this morning, nothing can stand against you when you believe the message of the hour. Satan, I challenge you in the name of Jesus Christ. These people here are the redeemed of the Lord. We have believed the message of the hour. Satan, I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ. Satan, I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ. The prophet says that the message of the hour brings the pillar of fire back in the church. The pillar of fire is in this building right now. What you need to see is call on the pillar of fire. He's passing through every aisle right now. He's passing by your eye right now. Call on Jesus Christ. He steal you. The spirit of the Lord is in this place. Nothing will stand against you. Nothing will stand against you. Just do like blind B. Please Jesus don't pass me by. Jesus. Jesus don't pass me by. Whatever you need this morning, Jesus don't pass me by. Bimus was like, who is this? I hear a noise. I hear a noise. What's going on? They told us, "It's Jesus of Nazareth." &gt;&gt; This morning, I hear a noise. I hear a spiritual noise going on. Some noise. I hear demons screaming. I'm hearing demons calling for help. But I'm also hearing the people of God asking for God. And you're asking, "What is that? What you are feeling right now? What is that? &gt;&gt; That pillow of fire is near you. &gt;&gt; What is a pillar of fire? It's a consuming fire. A consuming fire will consume everything that on its way. all the stress that's in your life, the pill of fire will cleanse you and it will make it will bring the true gold out of you. It will make you a a true Christian. It will make you a true sister. It will make you a true son, a true daughter, a true parent. It will make you a a true husband, a true wife. &gt;&gt; That's the message of the hour. I don't believe a message of yesterday. &gt;&gt; The message did not die when the prophet died. &gt;&gt; The prophet says you might kill the messenger but you will never kill the message because the message is one with the messenger. The messenger and the message is one. But when I say the messenger, don't think I'm talking about the prophet. I'm talking about the true messenger. The prophet says a messenger is an angel. The prophet says every prophet has an angel behind them bringing the message. The prophet says I'm just a microphone and the angel is speaking to you. &gt;&gt; We are living in a visit in an age where angels are visiting the children of God. &gt;&gt; Angels has visited this generation. and they are still here. &gt;&gt; They did not go back up. &gt;&gt; The message came to bring down the angels of God around around his people. &gt;&gt; Not just the angels but the might angels. You know in the God God saw his people in trouble. God saw in 2025 the bride is in trouble. darkness up on all the land. And Gabriel is telling God, "Oh mighty God, send me. Send me there. I'm just going to go rescue them myself." God said, "No, Gabriel, sit down." The other angel warm is saying, &gt;&gt; the prophet says the angel wound was the the angel of water. He was the angel that that that brought the the the the flood. And the angel is like when Meshadra Shadrach and Abednego were in trouble the prophet says the angel was like God send me I will bring the flood and I'll destroy all Babylon. But the prophets God said no war s. I myself have seen my people in trouble this morning. God saw you in trouble. God saw you in trouble and he says, "No, I for my people I need to come myself. For my people, I'm not going to send my angels. I, the mighty angel in Revelation 10, I put one foot on the land, one on the sea. I am calmed down among my people." Why? To set you free. Why? To bring you back to the positions of sons and daughters. You are no longer in trouble. Because your big brother has come down. You are no longer in trouble. Because the mighty God is with you. This message is God speaking to you. That's why the messenger and the message is what? The message is Christ. &gt;&gt; The message is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We serve a living God. We serve a living God. I'm trying to wrap up. &gt;&gt; You know, I think I read this, but in the message, the talking, the prophecy, &gt;&gt; and remember, Israel come through many things, but it was evening time when the token was required, not in the morning, not in the preparation. the 14 days of the keeping up of the land in P of 91. The message is preached on the September 1st the token 63. &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "So did Luther know it. [Music] So did Wesley know it. So did Finey, Knox, and Calvin know it. &gt;&gt; This is it. They knew &gt;&gt; there would come a time that the pillar of fire will return back to the churches knew of it. Paul knew of it. They knew there will be a time. What is a pill of fire? It's light. What is that time? In the evening time, there shall be light. Brothers and sisters, you are blessed &gt;&gt; because now God didn't just send an angel by himself. The pill of fire has come down. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. Glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Means the highest praise. Hallelujah. God deserves the highest praise &gt;&gt; because he's mindful of you &gt;&gt; because he he he thought of you. You know, he came down to rescue you. This message came to get you ready for for a rapture. You know, often time I think about college college students, the struggle of being a college student. It's really tough out there. You know, women dress inappropriately. the that that's why Paul says in second Timothy I believe he says their conscience has been sealed like an a an iron. So people no longer have conscience of good and right. People going outside almost naked out there, &gt;&gt; you know, and they believe that we're just going to we're not robots &gt;&gt; when when those guys go to college. It &gt;&gt; It's a real struggle out there. You think God doesn't know that you're in trouble? He knows &gt;&gt; but he said he will not leave you. &gt;&gt; The message came to display the token in your colleges so that in the midst of the trouble you stand on the message of the hour will keep you. He will keep him in perfect peace. He who keeps his mind stayed on the on him. &gt;&gt; What is Who is he? What is he? Who is Who is he? &gt;&gt; He's the word. &gt;&gt; I'm wrapping up. Sorry. I'll be done in the next 10 15 minutes. The prophet says, I'll continue this next time. I don't think in the message God chose a place of worship my friends I don't want I don't want to hurt you &gt;&gt; but I am responsible for a message and what is that message come out of this mess if I ask you to come out where am I going to take you to Would I take you to the Brandham tabernacle? &gt;&gt; It's as much fault as any of the rest of them. &gt;&gt; So, I don't know why some people think as if the brand tabernacle was like the mother church. The prophet says it's as much fault as any of them. &gt;&gt; But there is one place I can take you to. where it's safe, where you are protected from death, that's in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's what the message of the hour came to do. &gt;&gt; The message of the hour came to take you into Jesus Christ. If your life is not in Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; you are failing as to accomplish the purpose for which has God revealed himself to you? You stand? Has God revealed himself to you? The Bible says that the gospel did not come in words or or um words or deeds only but it came with power. &gt;&gt; He came with a manifestation. He came to express itself. &gt;&gt; I know I asked you to stand but I have just a quick test quick testimony. Because the question to you is what is the message of the hour to you? &gt;&gt; To me, the message of the hour is a God that keeps his word. &gt;&gt; To me, the message of the hour is a God that that would never leave me. To me, the message of the hour is God saw me in trouble and he came down to help me. &gt;&gt; To me, the message of the hour is God's mercy in my life. When I was full of sin, but Christ cleans me. &gt;&gt; The word washed me. The word washed me. &gt;&gt; I am what I am because of the message of God. &gt;&gt; This message has changed my life. &gt;&gt; When I I come with u a problem or or struggles I turn back to the message of the hour and I take God at his own. I said you promised this. &gt;&gt; Your prophet said this &gt;&gt; and I stand on it and every time God has always come through. I've given a testimony before how even I had a class that could not be in the system and God created that. I had another testimony how even God changed a policy of an entire university because of a prayer that I prayed right here. &gt;&gt; To me, the message of the hour is not a story. You know, like many of some of you know, we we we have we received our papers from immigration. &gt;&gt; It was it's been like it was like nine years since my parents my mom came and she applied for asylum. Nothing was moving. It was in the same stage for nine whole years. &gt;&gt; Nine whole years. &gt;&gt; And then one time, I think it might have been in my third sermon. And then while the the anointing of God came up on me, you know, we prayed, we prayed, we prayed &gt;&gt; and one time I was here right here. It's, you know, and I was preaching at the end of the service. I God took over me. And one of the things he said was that if you need your papers, he says, "I the Lord Jesus Christ give it to you." &gt;&gt; Less than three weeks after that, &gt;&gt; they called us for an interview. And then a few a few months after, you know, actually before that even happened, God is so God was so merciful. &gt;&gt; He gave me a dream and I had a dream. In a dream I saw that the immigration responded to us and approved our case &gt;&gt; and I told one of my friend I was like hey I had a dream this is what happened that we usually when I dream something that means it's not it's not too long before that happens two days later I get on the system I see it's been approved that's what the message of the hour is to me he's a real God a God that when he promises anything to you He will give it to you. It doesn't matter how long you've been waiting for, but when God says he will give it to you. It's yours to take. Whatever you need right now, God is here to give it to you. God is here to vindicate to you that this message is the reality. So, let's bow our head. If you need anything, just raise your hand or you can come up here. [Music] If you can lead us into a song, [Music] you know, I want you to put your faith on the God of this message right now. Challenge God. Challenge God this morning. Ask him, "Is this message the truth or not?" Ask God. I mean, I've I've been going to church for years. Is this message the truth? &gt;&gt; Lord, prove it to me today. In Malachi chapter 3, God says, "Prove me." God wants to be proven. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says that if God doesn't take care of his own word, then he's not God to you. &gt;&gt; What do you need? Jesus is here this morning to give you whatever you need. Put your faith in him. &gt;&gt; He will never let you down. &gt;&gt; Can you lead us into a song and you can start praying wherever you are or come here. &gt;&gt; My faith looks up to thee. Th lamb of calary savior divine [Music] now hear me while I Pray. Take all my sin away. Isaac from this day behold [Music] thine. [Music] Thy reach grace impart strength to my faithing heart my zeal inspire. Oh, as thou has died for me. Oh, may my love to thee pure [Music] and changeless be. worthy fire.

Just as I am and waiting out to read my soul of one dark blood. Oh to thee whose blood can cleanse each spot. Oh lamb of God, I come.
