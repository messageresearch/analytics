i'm happy night and day because all my sins are gone [Music] my soul is filled with music [Music] as far as darkness as far as heart removed as darkness m it's about the story of the two disciples after the resurrection of jesus and behold two of them went the same and behold two of them went that same day to a village called amirs which was from jerusalem together and reason together jesus himself drew near and went with him but there are you should not know him and he said what money of communications are these that you have one to another as the walk uh and or said you know and the one of them whose name was cleopas uh answered and saved unto him are dealt only as friends in jerusalem and has not known this the things which are coming to us and he said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet my mind indeed and word before god [Music] and how the chief priests and the rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified himself [Music] and beside all this today is the third day since these things were done in [Music] and when they found out his body they came saying that they had they also seen a vision of injuries which said that he was alive [Music] [Music] these things and to enter into his glory the palliative background and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning themselves the blood was before it is toward evening and the day his far spent and he went and he went in to tear it off and they said unto one and they say one to another did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened up and how it was um [Music] to be that you need to provide your father we have questions father god that are not answered by prayer father god that you give us answers amen lord we pray your father lord that you pray lord that you take me out of the way like those two disciples and our heart was brilliant [Music] [Music] um don't you cry little bride he's not dead he's alive amen you'll see that those two disciples where they were going they were talking about with the event that took place before that took place three days before when jesus who uh rose people from the dead amen who called lazarus and lazarus started walking and this jesus this man who came you know giving them hope of deliverance see don't just give your daughter in this be home amen giving them hope of oh hope of of of redemption amen so now this jesus is dead amen and it's been three days since it's been dead and those disciples were devastated amen those disciples amen that they were confused amen all our hopes we put on this on this man is that jesus told them when he was alive they forget amen how jesus told them to destroy this temple and rebuild it in three days amen they forget how jesus tell them that amen amen as jillian's when it was spent three days in the belly of the well amen i will also spend three days forget how david says that he will never leave his yeah he's his begotten one to seek corruption amen they had all those verses inside of them but the event that took place was so also uh uh strange that they couldn't even they couldn't control their emotions so so now here we'll see that there is a difference between knowing the word and and the word being revealed to him here amen you can't forget what you claim to believe amen amen because that word that you know is not really uh anchored in you amen but once that word has been revealed to you amen now you are in an unshakeable kingdom it doesn't matter how strong the situation is or how hard and impossible it is they fellowship with jesus communion with jesus broke the bread amen the bread which is the word and their eyes were open and that word and then they went and they told the rest of the disciples the good news that just happened amen that they saw jesus amen that they walked with jesus amen that they fellowship with jesus they had a one-on-one conversation with him amen that jesus was alive and well amen amen that jesus wasn't dead that everything that jesus told them amen came to pass amen amen and then you'll see that you mean after the man later on you see mary yeah amen after the news came to them that morning it meant that the the body of jesus couldn't be found amen all of them ran and then they went to the tomb am i trying to find who took the body of jesus amen the same thing happened again amen they forget everything that jesus tells them they started to cry they started to look for the body of jesus amen mary probably thought that the romans in men took the body of jesus or do something with it she was so scared and she was crying amen and then she heard someone women calling her a woman what is going on amen he said mary don't you marry the blood mary don't cry amen amen because that meant it meant i'm alive and well recognizing your day and its message what have they done they have not recognized the awakening of the bride by being a christian they feel the pull of the hour they know something is supposed to happen but see but they're looking for they're looking for it they're looking for it way off in the future before you you don't don't only future you may way off in the future to come when they believe that there will be a forerunner if around to come but it was right on them amen and they didn't know it they didn't recognize it the messiah amen because because it was prophesied that they would be blinded as uh hosea said so amen amen the word was before them and the fulfillment of the word was before them but they were looking for something in the future amen they were looking for something in the future the thing that was being happened that the thing that happened right in front of them amen that's the same thing with the chief phrase they knew all the prophecies amen amen the virgin shall concede amen but that prophecy happened before their eyes amen your virgin conceived that amen because they were looking for something in the future that was happening before in amen sometimes the answer is right in front of us amen amen are you trying to look for your forgiveness amen amen jesus shared his blood on calvary amen so why are you still looking for your forgiveness in the future amen you can't go to him even is that the man that the men can feel amen every temptation any man ever stood uh amen it doesn't matter what temptation is that temptation to be an overcomer [Music] that's where we have to go and every sons and daughters of christ of god has to go to calvary amen recovery is the main thing for us christians is the main thing for us right amen you can't be safe without going to calvary that's right you can't be bright without going to calvary jesus christ i've had to go through it it's just that means that every christian has to go through it amen amen the prophet says that calvary there is not a day but that was there is not a day that can't be that can be compared to calvary the day on calvary amen that's when our victory were given that's when we can go and say that we are now christ-like amen because it's no longer us living amen trying to work out to obey the law living inside amen that's why sometimes you don't understand sometimes we don't understand well i've got to complain it happens are you going through something and and out of a sudden a scripture comes to your mind amen the scriptures that you have read five years ago or 10 or sometimes you never read it amen why because they're comforted inside of us he's him and he's been him and he's bringing us to remember amen amen everything that jesus told us him and the word of christ amen amen one day the prophet and when he went to pray for his sister uh her name was sister lewis the prophet amen but before the prophet prayed they uh she had the priest and all those catholic people coming and and doing their prayers and stuff and she called all those catholic people and they did themselves and the prophet went now because he didn't want to be a part of it so after that the prophet came back in to pray for her because the prophet was believing in faith of healing the prophet believed that god was able to heal her amen the prophet believed that whatever she was going through god was able to to to help her to get out of that situation and then the prophet prayed for her in the prophetic people she received their healing amen and she gave her life to jesus amen she said the prophet amen brother brandon we're no longer catholic amen we want to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen and the word baptism the name of the lord jesus christ her and the little horse amen they lost them and he went to the prophet said that brother branham i have to find my opponents [Music] you have to pray for me i have to find him amen you pray for them and when my family now is safe amen and i believe that you are and i believe that you can pray for me and i will find it amen amen and the prophet was called in the spirit amen and he gave a prophecy amen telling him that you will go find those ponies on the mount on top of the mountains it was so difficult and impossible that those points will still be alive they were all covered in snow the word came from the prophet of god him and god gave him his promise that you will find your opponents that you will find your joy amen and he believed to that promise amen that's why god said that you may ask everything in jesus christ's name [Music] amen that your joy be perfect it doesn't matter how complicated is the thing you just asked amen what was that amen that was god hiding behind the skin of man amen that was god with the skin on it it's like the story of junior man who was scared because of the amen the rain was coming and the thunder and the stone lightning and everything everything will be all right junior said my mother i'm scared i can't sleep and her mother and his mother went up and started telling her he's telling him stories is you know that we believe a god who is able to to keep us safe amen she said junior god is able to keep you safe there is nothing to be there is nothing to be worried about amen you don't have to be scared in a junior you don't have to cry amen because god has his eye on him amen junior junior's response was reponsed he said that mama i do believe in that they say mom i believe that god is able to keep me safe mom i believe that you know i believe that every promise in the book is is mine and i believe in that promise but when does lightning start by by by windows the storm is coming and the lightning is is is is coming amen i need a girl with the skin on me when you when you're next to him and you feel safe amen amen amen his mom was the god with the skin on him amen because god was inside of his mother and when god unveiled himself god veiled himself inside of her amen the same jesus the same god who veiled himself in jesus christ he gave the spirit and then his spirit is in in every one of us amen he called us god exactly the jew amen the light of the world amen to be the god that the world is looking amen even when when the world is still talking about the god of history amen you can tell them that here is god walking [Music] amen because they had the spirit of god inside of them amen because they were revealing that spirit inside of them before before satan was broke it whip no more amen when he went when he broke the backbone of satan the backbone of sin of sickness we've since [Music] amen he can't be forgiven of that sin that's right you never seeking man out out here on the earth there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from emmanuel's veins where sinners are plunged beneath the flood and they lose all the guilty stains there is a fountain amen amen open in the house of david all of us sinners amen when we plunged in those students beneath that flood we lose all our guilt amen we lose all the condemnation of sin that's right amen will become new amen amen our sins are not but our sins can't be seen by god amen amen all of that because of calvary amen and jesus is sailing and he's telling us don't cry amen don't cry amen don't complain don't cry amen because i'm still alive amen i'm when amen that's where you find your forgiveness that's when you find your comfort zone amen that's where you find your blessings amen that's where you find everything that you need amen because when he died he said that everything is fulfilled amen all hope is gone you just trust in the word amen amen you just trust the promise of god you just trust everything that he told you amen you just trust every promise of the bible amen amen you just trust every word that he said that he would do in exodus chapter 14 verse 13 to 15 the bible says that and moses said unto them to the people you know amen but the bible says that moses said unto the people fear you not and stand still and see the salvation of god of the lord which you shall see them again no more forever amen the egyptians that you sing today for you amen you will see them no more forever amen the lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace and the lord said unto moses and the chin of israel shall go on the dry ground through the midst of the sea it is amen your jordan [Music] to be able to speak the word the situation is not clear when it when the road is not clear even when the tempest is coming speak the words speak the word for your healing speak the word for your deliverance i believe also amen speak the word for your salvation i believe amen speak the word for your blessing i believe will be amen speak the word for every situation you'll find yourself in the ship it may cut the head of goliath amen amen divide the red sea that is standing on your way amen speak the word moses why are you crying amen i have given you the ability to speak the word amen what was that amen that was the redemption by power amen that was god destroying the greatest army of the world that was the redemption by powers there was a promise for us to tell us that no amen there is nobody that can stand against our gods amen amen because god will do everything to keep you safe amen don't you cry little bro because god will do everything to keep you safe amen which went before the camp of israel amen removed and went behind them and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face and stood behind them and he came between the camp of the egyptians and the camp of israel and it was a cloud and a darkness to them but he gave that was god making sure that they're safe he was before them amen leading the way but when the time started when the trouble started to come even when the children of israel are starting to to cry amen that same god was leading the way he left there he left him he went behind them to become a barrier [Music] that the fire will not burn you and he will be the fourth man in the fire he will be the god amen who will always shut down the the the mouths of of of the lions amen there is nothing to be to be complaining about amen because god will do everything amen to keep you safe if he did it he's the same god amen who will do it for you the spiritual israel amen because it says that that promise is for you this is unto you is for you and and for those who will come after you amen for your children as long as god is still calling people that promise will still be there sickness amen he went back to bed to make sure that they're safe and he went back to make sure that pharaoh would not touch them and he went back to make sure that that the errors of pharaoh will now touch them amen amen the bible says and jesus said unto them because of your own belief amen foreign its transporter and nothing shall be impossible yeah that's right it meant nothing would be impossible amen everything that you say amen whatever mountain of your life if you i have been young and now i'm old yet if i not see the righteous being forsaken amen no his seed be begging bread he is that you shall not need to fight in this battle second chronicles verse 24 uh chapter 24 17. the bible says that you shall not need to fight in this battle tomorrow god is fighting amen pick up those blessings for three days amen the blessing was so good it was so there were so many blessings that and the bible says that and in the day and in that day uh john chapter 16 verse 23 amen and in that day you shall ask me nothing have you asked nothing in my name and you shall receive your joy that your joy be full amen until now amen you will receive whatever you're asking that your joy before my god i want you to be happy may god want you to smile amen god wants you to have the happy face he doesn't want you to be sick amen [Applause] amen he said again verily very i said unto you john chapter 14 verse 12. amen so now you have to know what are those works if the women know someone that jesus was talking about dude the way he said that the works that i do amen he was talking about the present time what were those words healing amen amen creating food that's right multiplying bread amen finding morning in the in the belly of a fish amen all those miracles that jesus did amen bringing the good news to the people amen those are those who were the word were the works that jesus was talking about amen those are the words that i do and those words you shall do also amen amen understand that jesus didn't stop there amen and he said that and greater works than this you shall do amen and greater works than this year shall he do it greater than worse than healing sick people it meant greater greater work than great greater work than than than the multiplying breaks the greater works than raising up the dead people and then he says that those greater work you will do also amen so now what is that greater word amen that what is that greater work that jesus himself wasn't able to do see what's he constantly using amen what is that greater work that jesus himself said that you will do amen because he said that i go to my father amen now the prophet says now know this the greater works the concern was to have power in the church not only to heal the sick by prayer cast out devils by prayer amen by the greater work that jesus was talking about amen was to impart eternal life to believers amen the holy ghost was coming and given into the hands of the church amen to import life amen amen and lifted them into a place to be sons and daughters of god amen to heal the sick and to impart eternal life by giving the holy by giving the holy ghost to obedient believers men who were once unbelievers amen be made believers and import spiritual eternal life amen people receiving the holy spirit amen that is the greater word jesus couldn't do it in that present time amen because he head first to go up yes am i here's first to to do the work of calvary to be able to give the holy spirit amen to give able to impart the holy eternal life to all believers what do you mean how can i do it his disciples giving chapter 16 and then the 11 disciples went and went away into galilee into a mountain where jesus had appointed them and when they saw him they worshipped him and jesus came and spoke unto them saying jesus all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth amen now go ye therefore ali and teach all nations baptizing them in the in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost teaching them to observe all all things whatsoever i have i have commanded to i have commanded you hey amen this gospel that will give joy to the people amen this gospel of joy amen this gospel amen that has blessings amen this gospel the good news amen that jesus is still alive amen amen that's the goodness we have to be giving up amen how can you give a goodness on yourself how can you give a goodness when yourself you say imagine that god bless you with 10 amen and then you come to the church and then you start testifying about the blessing of god and then all said and you say well i believe that god blessed me with a million dollars you're not showing you're not showing the expression of the blessings amen to take away all our sadness amen the word has come amen to take away all everything that everything that we're complaining about amen that's the good news that jesus christ is dead yeah that jesus christ is alive amen that god is not was before them a disjoint and now the other side you have people insulting you so it is not true and then on the other side you have people saying that you're not a christian here are people saying that you're not a believer amen but you have to you have to keep the faith amen amen the same god who departed the red sea amen he's the same god amen to give you victory you don't it's not a time asking yourself that
