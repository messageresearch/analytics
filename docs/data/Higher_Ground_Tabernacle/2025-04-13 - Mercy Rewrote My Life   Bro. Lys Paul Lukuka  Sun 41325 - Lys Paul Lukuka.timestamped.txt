[46:13] you. Amen. God bless y'all. Amen. Happy
[46:17] to be in the house of the Lord this
[46:18] morning.
[46:20] And we'll go straight to the word and
[46:22] thank you for the songs, Brother
[46:28] Isaac. I greet you all in the name of
[46:31] the Lord Jesus
[46:34] Christ. Are we happy to be in the house
[46:36] of the Lord? Amen.
[46:38] Again, are we happy to be in the house
[46:40] of the Lord?
[46:42] Amen.
[46:44] Uh let's go straight to Ephesians
[46:47] chapter 2.
[47:00] Ephesians chapter 2 verse
[47:05] 1-5.
[47:13] Ephesians and I'll start.
[47:16] And you ha has he quickened who were
[47:19] dead in trespasses and sins. wherein in
[47:23] time past you walk according to the
[47:25] course of this world, according to the
[47:27] prince of the power of the air, the
[47:30] spirit that now workketh in the children
[47:33] of
[47:33] disobedience, among whom also we all had
[47:37] our conversations in time past in the
[47:39] lust of our flesh, fulfilling the
[47:41] desires of the flesh and of the mind,
[47:44] and were by nature the children of
[47:46] wrath, even as others. But God, who is
[47:49] rich in mercy, for his great love
[47:51] wherewith he loved us, even when we were
[47:55] dead in sins, has quickened us together
[47:58] with with Christ. By grace ye are saved.
[48:04] It was in Ephesians chapter 2 verse 1-5.
[49:14] Amen. Let's go to uh the book of
[49:17] Lamentations chapter 3 verse 22-23.
[49:24] It goes right after the book of
[49:26] Jeremiah.
[49:31] Yeah. Chapter 3 verse 22-
[49:33] [Music]
[49:40] 23 and I'll start.
[49:44] It is of the Lord's mercies that we are
[49:46] not consumed.
[49:49] Hallelujah.
[49:51] Yeah. Chapter 3 verse 22. It is of the
[49:54] Lord's mercies that we are not consumed
[49:56] because he his compassions fail not.
[50:14] Amen. I'm I'm thankful for the mercy of
[50:17] God this morning. And let's bow our
[50:19] head. Um if if you have any pro any
[50:22] needs, just lift your hand to God and
[50:24] we'll
[50:25] pray. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we
[50:28] humbly approach your throne of mercies
[50:31] this
[50:32] morning. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we
[50:34] thank you for your mercy this
[50:36] morning. Father Lord, we just I just
[50:39] heard they sang the song and like what a
[50:41] mighty God we serve
[50:43] Lord. And that song also says we'll
[50:46] enter into his gates with thanksgiving
[50:48] Lord
[50:51] Jesus. And heavenly father Lord we are
[50:54] entering with thanksgiving this morning
[50:56] into your gates
[50:57] Lord. And heavenly father Lord Jesus
[51:00] because we are thankful for your
[51:03] mercy. I pray heavenly father Lord God
[51:05] that you forgive us of our shortcomings
[51:09] Lord. I pray father Lord God that you
[51:11] speak to us this
[51:13] morning. I I pray Lord that you hear
[51:15] through our ears Lord
[51:17] Jesus. I pray that you have full
[51:20] preminence in the service this morning
[51:21] Lord
[51:22] Jesus. Lord your Bible says that if you
[51:24] be lifted up you will draw all men unto
[51:28] you. Father Lord God this morning we are
[51:30] here not to lift up a man but to lift up
[51:32] the person of Jesus
[51:35] Christ because Father Lord we want to
[51:37] get we want to we want to draw get drawn
[51:39] to you Lord
[51:41] Jesus and heavenly father Lord the Bible
[51:43] tell us in order to do that we got to
[51:45] lift you up Lord
[51:47] Jesus Lord I surrender myself into your
[51:50] hands Father Lord Lord your prophet says
[51:53] that a gift is the ability to put
[51:55] yourself out of the way and let God use
[51:56] you.
[52:01] Lord, if I don't know how to do it, I
[52:03] pray that you teach me how to do it,
[52:05] Lord
[52:06] God. Because your children did not come
[52:09] to hear me, but they came to hear you,
[52:11] Lord. Because your word gives lives,
[52:13] Lord Jesus Christ. Give them life this
[52:16] morning, Lord Jesus. Oh, the person who
[52:19] came into this church dead in the
[52:20] spirit, may they go out alive in the
[52:22] spirit, Lord Jesus.
[52:24] I pray that you remember the person,
[52:26] everybody who rose their hand this
[52:28] morning, Lord God, with a need.
[52:32] Lord, you alone know what their needs
[52:33] are, Lord Jesus. I pray that you grant
[52:36] them their needs in the name of Jesus
[52:38] Christ. Oh father, I pray that you have
[52:41] full preminence. Lord, I bind every
[52:43] spirit of unbelief in the name of Jesus
[52:46] Christ. May the Lord Jesus Christ have
[52:48] his way.
[52:51] bless the reading of your word and
[52:53] anoint every word that will be said,
[52:55] Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ, we
[52:58] pray.
[52:59] Amen. Amen. Amen. You may have your
[53:01] seats.
[53:05] So, I've preached this sermon here
[53:07] before, but it was on a Wednesday,
[53:12] but it it might be slightly different.
[53:14] However, God is going to
[53:17] lead. I had another sermon that I wanted
[53:20] to preach,
[53:22] but somehow I just didn't feel like
[53:25] preaching it today and I just felt led
[53:27] to this one.
[53:31] So I trust uh this is going to be a
[53:33] blessing to you.
[53:36] So my sermon title is going to be mercy
[53:40] rewrote my life.
[53:45] You know, mercy rewrote my life
[53:49] because if it wasn't for the mercies of
[53:51] God, none of us would have been here
[53:52] this
[53:54] morning. And it is. And it is important
[53:57] for each one of us to recognize that we
[53:59] are only here by his
[54:03] mercy because even the Bible, like we
[54:06] just read here, it says that it is of
[54:08] the Lord's mercies that we are not
[54:10] consumed.
[54:15] So the reason why we are not consumed,
[54:17] Jeremiah is telling us it's because of
[54:19] the Lord's mercy.
[54:24] Because his compassions fail
[54:29] not. So his compassion never
[54:32] failed. And you can put your faith on
[54:35] that. And then the good the thing I like
[54:38] about this verse is that they are new
[54:40] every
[54:44] morning. So they don't exhaust. Every
[54:47] morning they are new.
[54:50] Yesterday God's mercy is yesterday's
[54:53] God's
[54:55] mercy. But this morning he gives you a
[54:58] new
[54:59] mercy. Tomorrow morning he gives you
[55:01] another new
[55:03] mercy. Next year he gives you a new
[55:05] mercy.
[55:08] Many of us are still alive 2025 today.
[55:11] It's the Lord's it's the Lord's mercy.
[55:17] The mercy of 220 2024 is not the same
[55:20] mercy as of
[55:24] 2025. So bec and and why does God keeps
[55:27] renewing his mercy is because he loves
[55:29] you.
[55:33] God love God's love is what projected
[55:35] the person of Jesus Christ to
[55:40] come Jesus came on earth because of the
[55:42] Lord's
[55:45] mercy and that's on that mercy that
[55:48] we'll speak this
[55:51] morning mercy the the word mercy means
[55:55] compassion or forgiveness shown towards
[55:57] someone whom it is within one's power to
[56:00] punish or harm
[56:06] So in other words, it's if I have the
[56:08] power to to to to
[56:11] forgive. No, if I have the power to
[56:13] punish or to harm
[56:16] you, but instead of punishing you, I
[56:19] choose to give you
[56:21] forgiveness. So you have to first know
[56:24] that the person who's giving forgiveness
[56:26] didn't have to do it.
[56:31] You know that's what happened in the
[56:32] garden of
[56:34] Eden. Men fa mankind
[56:37] fell. You know the Bible says you shall
[56:40] not eat of that tree. And then and then
[56:42] Adam and Eve they
[56:45] disobeyed. And because of that
[56:48] disobedience the the punishment was
[56:51] death. You know the Bible says the soul
[56:54] the soul that sinnth shall
[56:57] die. And the prophet tells us that God
[56:59] never goes against his own
[57:03] word. So every time we disobey the word
[57:06] of God, there's death that has to
[57:10] follow. But God so rich in
[57:14] mercy. He didn't let us continue to
[57:18] die. He didn't let us to be
[57:21] consumed. God rich in his mercy. He
[57:24] provided his son.
[57:26] God rich in his mercy. He provided a
[57:30] sacrifice because the sacrifice had to
[57:33] be without
[57:34] sin. But the Bible says that all of us
[57:37] were shaped and born into
[57:41] iniquity. So no you no human being was
[57:44] worthy to even be the
[57:48] sacrifice. That's why John in revelation
[57:53] cried. John looked and he saw when they
[57:55] asked who is worthy to take the
[57:58] book saw that no one was
[58:02] worthy. When John looked he saw that not
[58:05] even Elijah was
[58:08] worthy. When John looked he saw that
[58:10] even himself he wasn't
[58:12] worthy. He I he probably started seeing
[58:16] all the sin that he's committed in his
[58:19] life. So he wasn't worthy to redeem
[58:22] mankind.
[58:24] John looked and he saw a brother wasn't
[58:28] worthy and he started crying. He started
[58:32] weeping and the prophet tells us that
[58:34] John started weeping because he saw that
[58:36] it was going to be the annihilation of
[58:38] the
[58:41] world. So in other words, we were not
[58:44] going to be here this
[58:46] morning. And John cried so much because
[58:49] of that.
[58:52] But he heard another voice behind him
[58:54] says, "Cry
[58:56] not for the line the lamb the the lamb
[59:00] has prevailed."
[59:02] And when John looked, he saw the lion
[59:04] that was coming to take the
[59:08] book. When John looked, he saw that cry
[59:11] not because Jesus has prevailed.
[59:15] This morning, I'm here to tell you, cry
[59:17] not because Jesus has
[59:19] prevailed. This morning I'm here to tell
[59:21] you that there is hope because Jesus has
[59:23] prevailed.
[59:26] This morning I'm here to tell you that
[59:28] there is forgiveness for your sins
[59:29] because Jesus has
[59:32] prevailed. I can tell you that you can
[59:34] overcome your addictions because Jesus
[59:36] has
[59:38] prevailed. Even though you commit you
[59:40] fall short, Jesus has
[59:45] prevailed. John looked at himself. He
[59:47] was full of sin. But because he saw that
[59:49] the lamb prevailed, he had
[59:54] hope. We we ought to be people with hope
[59:57] this
[59:59] morning because the lamb has
[1:00:02] prevailed. That's why we are here this
[1:00:04] morning. That's why we can sing to God
[1:00:07] songs of songs of love, songs of
[1:00:11] gratefulness. Great are your
[1:00:14] mercies. Great is your faithfulness.
[1:00:18] Your mercies are new every
[1:00:19] morning. That's why we are here and we
[1:00:22] can sing about the
[1:00:29] Amen. Amen.
[1:00:32] So like I said u there was a punishment
[1:00:36] that that if the soul sins the
[1:00:38] punishment was death.
[1:00:43] And we saw that uh if we go to the book
[1:00:45] of revelation 12 verse
[1:01:02] 6 and I'll read it. Oh and I heard a
[1:01:06] loud voice saying in heaven now is come
[1:01:08] salvation and strength.
[1:01:18] and the kingdom of of our God and the
[1:01:20] power of his
[1:01:23] Christ. For the accuser of our brethren
[1:01:27] is cast down which is accused them
[1:01:29] before our God day and
[1:01:36] night. I'll read that again. The accuser
[1:01:39] of our brethren is cast down which
[1:01:43] accuse them before our God day and
[1:01:51] night. So the Bible is telling us in
[1:01:53] revelation there is we have an
[1:01:56] accuser. There's someone who goes up
[1:01:58] there in heaven day and night accusing
[1:02:00] us to God.
[1:02:03] So every time you fall short there's the
[1:02:06] devil goes God look at your own son look
[1:02:08] at what he
[1:02:11] did God is like Satan is like look look
[1:02:15] at what he just did
[1:02:18] yesterday but your law says that he
[1:02:20] should be
[1:02:22] dead and he's like but the but you you
[1:02:25] you always you are you are your own law
[1:02:29] and you always stand by your law so why
[1:02:31] are you not punishing
[1:02:33] But he forgets that the law has already
[1:02:35] there is already been a price paid for
[1:02:37] that.
[1:02:39] The problem is that Satan is pointing
[1:02:41] God at your old book.
[1:02:46] The problem is that once you are saved,
[1:02:49] God transfers your names from the old
[1:02:51] book to the book, the lamb's book of
[1:02:55] life. So when Satan is going before God
[1:02:58] and bringing all the evidences,
[1:03:02] God, he did this. She did this. She did
[1:03:05] this. God says, I don't see it. I'm
[1:03:08] looking at the lamb's book of life. I
[1:03:10] don't see
[1:03:12] it. I'm looking. All I see is the blood
[1:03:14] of Jesus
[1:03:15] Christ. Brothers, we are to be grateful
[1:03:18] for the blood of Jesus
[1:03:20] Christ because the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:03:22] covers all all our
[1:03:25] sins. When I will see the blood, I will
[1:03:28] pass over you.
[1:03:31] When I'll see the blood, you got to make
[1:03:33] sure that the blood is applied in your
[1:03:35] life because that's the only way God
[1:03:38] shows mercy towards
[1:03:41] you. He has one requirement.
[1:03:47] It's when I see the blood.
[1:03:49] And the prophet tells us that when God
[1:03:52] applies the blood in your life, he gives
[1:03:54] you a token.
[1:03:57] When God applies the blood in your
[1:03:59] lives, he gives you a token. You
[1:04:02] cannot just say that the blood has been
[1:04:04] applied but there is no
[1:04:08] signs. And the prophet tells us that the
[1:04:11] token is the Holy
[1:04:14] Ghost. So when the blood is applied in
[1:04:16] your life, you got to show that the Holy
[1:04:21] Ghost. Amen.
[1:04:25] Let's let's look at some some examples
[1:04:27] of people who who found the mercies of
[1:04:30] God in the Bible.
[1:04:35] The the first woman I have here is the
[1:04:37] woman who was caught in the act of
[1:04:43] adultery. The this woman was caught in
[1:04:46] the very
[1:04:50] act. So she had no defense.
[1:04:54] What are you going to defend defend
[1:04:56] yourself with? They literally caught you
[1:04:58] in the
[1:05:01] act. You remember the title of my sermon
[1:05:04] is the mercies of God rewrote my
[1:05:08] life. So this
[1:05:10] woman, this woman, she knew that
[1:05:12] according to the law, if a woman is
[1:05:13] caught in the act of adultery, she she
[1:05:15] will be stoned to death.
[1:05:24] So this woman knew that she was going to
[1:05:26] die that
[1:05:27] day because they brought her to Jesus.
[1:05:31] You know that's the mistake that the
[1:05:33] enemy always
[1:05:35] does. Don't you dare accuse my own
[1:05:37] daughter to
[1:05:40] me. That's the mistake that Satan is
[1:05:43] doing. He's accusing you to God.
[1:05:47] He's accusing you to the person who
[1:05:49] loves
[1:05:50] you, you know, he brought her to Jesus,
[1:05:54] you know, look look at what she did,
[1:05:58] you know, but Jesus says that the person
[1:06:00] without the without sin, let him cast
[1:06:02] the
[1:06:05] first, you
[1:06:06] know, look, it's always look at that
[1:06:09] spirit of
[1:06:10] accusations.
[1:06:12] People are sometimes too quick to accuse
[1:06:15] others without even looking at yourself.
[1:06:20] I feel like the accusations would be
[1:06:22] less if people could only look at their
[1:06:24] own lives
[1:06:28] too because once you understand that you
[1:06:31] are also full of
[1:06:35] sin then you will be more compassionate
[1:06:38] to someone else.
[1:06:41] Doesn't the Bible tells us that when you
[1:06:43] go to someone, go with the spirit that
[1:06:45] that person could have been you
[1:06:49] for? When you're praying for someone,
[1:06:52] when your brother falls, you you pray
[1:06:54] not with the spirit that you are better
[1:06:55] than that
[1:06:57] person. But you pray because you feel
[1:06:59] like that could have also been
[1:07:02] you. And the prophet tells us that
[1:07:05] spirits don't die.
[1:07:07] So those same spirits went to accuse
[1:07:09] this
[1:07:11] woman but they could not look at
[1:07:14] themselves. So Jesus he says the person
[1:07:17] without sin cast the
[1:07:20] first and the woman was just like okay
[1:07:23] these are my last minutes on
[1:07:26] earth
[1:07:28] dying but she she waited a few minutes I
[1:07:32] don't know how long it took could have
[1:07:34] taken hours
[1:07:36] minutes and then she looked and then
[1:07:39] Jesus is like woman where are the
[1:07:43] accusers this Morning. Jesus is telling
[1:07:46] you where are your
[1:07:48] accusers? That that enemy that keeps
[1:07:50] accusing you day and night, where is
[1:07:54] he? She found mercy with God. Instead of
[1:07:58] her being dead, now we are talking about
[1:08:01] her in the Bible as an
[1:08:03] example. Her life has been
[1:08:06] rewritten. Her story was going to be
[1:08:08] known as the
[1:08:10] prostitute, but now she's known as
[1:08:12] someone who found favor with God.
[1:08:16] your story. Maybe some of us were on in
[1:08:19] different
[1:08:20] paths. Some of us were in path of
[1:08:24] distractions. Some of us were in path of
[1:08:26] drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, all the
[1:08:30] worldly
[1:08:32] things. But you have found favor with
[1:08:34] God this
[1:08:36] morning. That's why you are here this
[1:08:39] morning. You are not here by your own
[1:08:41] strength. Oh, you are not here by your
[1:08:44] own might. There are many other people
[1:08:46] there stronger than
[1:08:48] you. There are more people out there
[1:08:50] with more discipline than
[1:08:52] you. But you are here not because of
[1:08:55] your
[1:08:56] discipline. But you are here because of
[1:08:58] the mercy of
[1:08:59] God. If you see your brother struggling
[1:09:02] with an
[1:09:04] addiction, don't think that you are
[1:09:06] better because you are
[1:09:08] disciplined. No, it's not discipline. It
[1:09:12] is the mercy of
[1:09:13] God because if it is discipline one day
[1:09:16] it's going to run
[1:09:17] out but the mercies of God who keeps
[1:09:21] renew every
[1:09:23] morning every morning God gives you his
[1:09:26] mercy yesterday you overcame the spirit
[1:09:29] of of
[1:09:31] alcohol this morning again God gives you
[1:09:34] his new mercy you overcome that
[1:09:37] spirit tomorrow you wake up again God
[1:09:40] gives you that the the
[1:09:43] mercy you know that's the thing that we
[1:09:45] are lacking we are not asking God for
[1:09:48] his mercies we are trying to do things
[1:09:50] on our own and every time man tries to
[1:09:54] to take things into their his own
[1:09:56] hands he always leads to
[1:09:59] destruction every time man tries to we
[1:10:02] see we they created guns
[1:10:06] and they kept in improving it to to the
[1:10:09] to the point that he became like an
[1:10:11] atomic
[1:10:13] weapon. And now they're going to have
[1:10:15] regulations to stop certain countries
[1:10:17] from from producing nuclear
[1:10:21] weapons, always leading to
[1:10:24] distractions. Every time you have a
[1:10:26] situation in your life, you try to
[1:10:27] figure it out on yourself, it will lead
[1:10:30] to problems after
[1:10:35] problems. But what you need to do is you
[1:10:38] need to bring it to Jesus.
[1:10:41] because he will give you his
[1:10:43] mercies. You know when David God asked
[1:10:46] David a choice when David had sinned
[1:10:50] I think that's when he number the
[1:10:52] people you know God told David choose to
[1:10:56] choose between being at the mercies of
[1:10:58] man or the mercies of
[1:11:01] God the judgment of man or the judgment
[1:11:04] of God.
[1:11:06] David chose to be under God's judgment.
[1:11:11] Because under God's judgment, there's
[1:11:13] still his mercy that's
[1:11:16] there. Oh, this morning I'm choosing to
[1:11:18] be under God's
[1:11:20] judgment, then under the Satan's
[1:11:23] judgment because the enemy wants to harm
[1:11:26] you. Satan wants to destroy you. So the
[1:11:30] moment you give him that opportunity to
[1:11:32] harm you, he will not have mercy on you.
[1:11:37] That's why even when when he was
[1:11:39] accusing Job to God,
[1:11:42] God had to tell Satan, okay, take
[1:11:44] everything but don't take his own life.
[1:11:46] Don't take his life.
[1:11:48] So when you give the opportunity to the
[1:11:50] devil to judge you, he'll take your
[1:11:53] life and he will destroy your marriage.
[1:11:57] He will destroy your house. He'll
[1:11:59] destroy your
[1:12:00] family. But I wonder every time I fall
[1:12:03] short, I want to be under God's mercy.
[1:12:07] Because in his mercy he remember that
[1:12:10] I'm his
[1:12:11] son. In his mercy he remember that I'm
[1:12:14] his
[1:12:15] daughter. Why? Because he's put a his
[1:12:18] germ of life inside of
[1:12:20] me. God cannot go against you.
[1:12:24] He cannot go against you because you are
[1:12:26] his
[1:12:35] There was another woman who went to wash
[1:12:36] Jesus' feet with her
[1:12:41] tears. No, that woman also she was an
[1:12:45] ill-fame woman.
[1:12:48] Do you do you see the pattern here? It's
[1:12:50] people people with an ill fame.
[1:12:54] people with bad
[1:12:56] lives, but every time they are brought
[1:12:58] to Jesus, their lives are changed.
[1:13:02] The woman who was caught in the act of
[1:13:03] adultery, she brought to Jesus her
[1:13:07] life. That woman, the the the prostitute
[1:13:10] woman that went to to wash Jesus feet
[1:13:12] with her teeth, she was a
[1:13:15] prostitute. Jesus, her life was changed.
[1:13:19] the the the the the
[1:13:22] the crazy man from Gadra. Oh, the the
[1:13:25] maniac. The maniac.
[1:13:28] He had legions of demons in him,
[1:13:32] but he was brought to Jesus and his life
[1:13:34] was
[1:13:37] changed. That's what the solution is. Go
[1:13:40] to
[1:13:41] Jesus. If you want to have your life
[1:13:44] changed, go to Jesus.
[1:13:47] religion had de thousands of demons
[1:13:49] inside of
[1:13:51] him. You know, he was going he was
[1:13:54] cutting himself,
[1:13:56] you know. He was uh removing his
[1:13:59] clothes, you know. He had those demons,
[1:14:02] they were even binding with chains, but
[1:14:04] the power of those demons would break
[1:14:05] those
[1:14:08] chains. But again, the mistake that they
[1:14:11] made was they brought him before Jesus.
[1:14:16] Those demons used to play with all those
[1:14:19] other
[1:14:20] people. They came to Jesus. They met the
[1:14:23] source of all
[1:14:25] electricity. They came to Jesus. They
[1:14:27] noticed that this electricity feels
[1:14:31] different. The feeling that this person
[1:14:33] is
[1:14:34] different. Why? Because Jesus was the
[1:14:37] word. Jesus was God made flesh.
[1:14:42] Oh, they brought him to Jesus and that
[1:14:44] electricity was different
[1:14:47] and they started asking why did you
[1:14:49] bring us to Jesus?
[1:14:53] Why? That's why we're not here to do
[1:14:55] Satan a
[1:14:57] favor. We are here to tear his kingdom
[1:15:00] down this morning. We are here to tear
[1:15:03] the kingdom of
[1:15:04] God. We want them to start asking why
[1:15:07] did you bring
[1:15:09] us? Brothers and sisters, you came to
[1:15:12] the right
[1:15:14] place. The word of God is in this
[1:15:17] place. Demons are crying out, "Why did
[1:15:20] you come to
[1:15:22] Jesus?" Demons are crying. Why did you
[1:15:25] bring
[1:15:26] us? You came to Jesus because he's your
[1:15:30] creator. You came to Jesus because he's
[1:15:32] your savior. Because he's the the the
[1:15:35] power of all power.
[1:15:38] And there's not a single demon that's
[1:15:40] more powerful than the
[1:15:43] Jesus. There's not a single demon that
[1:15:46] you are struggling here that is more
[1:15:48] powerful than
[1:15:52] Jesus. Amen. That's the problem.
[1:15:56] We are here to tear the kingdom of
[1:16:00] Satan. Satan, the prophet tells us that
[1:16:02] Satan does not like those kind of
[1:16:03] sermons.
[1:16:08] that he'll try to have you get out of
[1:16:11] service for you to be out of this
[1:16:14] church because he knows he's about to
[1:16:17] get cast down.
[1:16:19] God's mercy is telling you stay in your
[1:16:23] seat. God's mercy is telling you cast
[1:16:25] that kingdom down
[1:16:28] because the kingdom that we receive from
[1:16:31] God is more powerful than the kingdoms
[1:16:33] of this
[1:16:35] world. The kingdom of God is more
[1:16:37] powerful than all the darknesses of this
[1:16:41] world. The kingdom of God is a type of
[1:16:43] kingdom that when it comes down in a
[1:16:45] place full of darkness, it brings light.
[1:16:51] We are the children of
[1:16:53] light. We are the children of
[1:16:55] light. And it's time to cast down all
[1:17:00] darkness. Satan, you got to
[1:17:02] leave. Oh, in the name of Jesus
[1:17:05] Christ. Let the light of God shine in
[1:17:08] your
[1:17:09] life. May the light of the gospel shine
[1:17:12] in your
[1:17:12] [Applause]
[1:17:14] life. Cast down the kingdom of sin.
[1:17:18] It's by the word of
[1:17:20] God. But the word will never come unless
[1:17:22] you ac you receive it in your
[1:17:25] heart. The prophet tells us that Jesus
[1:17:27] is a
[1:17:29] gentleman. He'll never force himself
[1:17:31] into your lives unless you let him
[1:17:34] in. But he's there
[1:17:39] knocking. That's the mercy of God.
[1:17:42] The fact that he's even there at your
[1:17:44] door knocking, it's his mercies.
[1:17:48] And how do you know that God is knocking
[1:17:50] in your heart? It's when in your heart
[1:17:52] you have a desire to you hearing the
[1:17:55] sermons. You're like, "God, I want to be
[1:17:56] set free from
[1:17:58] this. Lord, I want to draw closer to
[1:18:01] you. Lord, I want to serve you
[1:18:04] more. Lord, I want to die out to
[1:18:07] myself." The prophet tells us that it's
[1:18:09] not yourself saying that because the
[1:18:12] Bible says that no man can come to God.
[1:18:15] God draws
[1:18:17] him. So that desire in you to want to
[1:18:20] get drawn to God, that means that God is
[1:18:22] pulling
[1:18:25] you to you.
[1:18:28] But what you need to do, you also need
[1:18:29] to respond to the
[1:18:31] call. You also need to draw night to him
[1:18:35] because the Bible says draw night unto
[1:18:36] him and he will draw night unto
[1:18:39] you. I want to have God with me all the
[1:18:43] time.
[1:18:44] I want to walk in this life with
[1:18:47] God. This age that we're living in is an
[1:18:50] evil
[1:18:51] age. It's an age that the Bible tells us
[1:18:54] that if it wasn't God shortening the
[1:18:56] time, none of us would have made
[1:18:58] it. So God to make to shorten the
[1:19:04] time. And you think you can't live in
[1:19:06] this age without
[1:19:09] him. We need God every
[1:19:12] hour. I need you every minute of my
[1:19:15] life, Lord. I need you every hour of my
[1:19:18] life, Lord. Even when I sleep, I want
[1:19:21] you there with
[1:19:22] me, Lord. When I wake up, I want you
[1:19:24] there with me, Lord. When I go to work,
[1:19:27] I want you there with me, Lord. When I
[1:19:29] come back from work, I want
[1:19:31] you, Lord. When I go to work, my
[1:19:34] children, my family, I want you
[1:19:37] there, Lord Jesus Christ. Protect me.
[1:19:42] Satan is roaring like a
[1:19:44] lion seeking him whom you can
[1:19:48] devour. Satan is roaring in your
[1:19:53] life. So you need that
[1:19:55] protection and the protection is Christ.
[1:19:59] The protection is Jesus Christ. The
[1:20:01] Bible says that the name of the Lord is
[1:20:05] strong. The name of the Lord is a
[1:20:09] strong. It's not a weak tower, but it's
[1:20:13] a strong tower that the righteous runs
[1:20:17] into safe.
[1:20:19] You want to find safety, it's in the
[1:20:21] name of
[1:20:24] Jesus. You want to find safety for your
[1:20:26] job, stay in
[1:20:30] Christ. You want to stay, you want to
[1:20:33] stay safe in your house, stay in Christ.
[1:20:45] Christ is our security.
[1:20:48] Christ is our strong tower.
[1:20:51] Don't run to the
[1:20:53] devil. Run to Christ. Christ is the
[1:20:58] solution. We want those demons to cry.
[1:21:02] Why did you bring me to Jesus?
[1:21:07] The Bible says that Jesus is the same
[1:21:09] yesterday, today, and
[1:21:11] forever. If that man that had thousands
[1:21:14] of demons in him went to Jesus and he he
[1:21:16] went back a different person, so can
[1:21:22] you. Why? Because he is the
[1:21:25] same. When when Moses asked God, "What
[1:21:28] am I going to tell them? Who sent me?"
[1:21:34] I like how God identified himself to
[1:21:38] Moses. Tell them I am send
[1:21:42] me because God is the God of the present
[1:21:45] present
[1:21:46] tense. Why? Because we don't want a God
[1:21:49] of
[1:21:52] history. Satan is not scared of God of
[1:21:55] the
[1:21:56] past. Satan doesn't want a God over
[1:21:59] history.
[1:22:00] But Satan want a man who has an
[1:22:02] experience with God.
[1:22:05] A man who knows that God is alive and
[1:22:08] well this morning.
[1:22:10] A man who knows that Jesus did not stay
[1:22:12] in the
[1:22:14] tomb. But Jesus rose from the
[1:22:17] dead. And he says that I will send you
[1:22:20] my
[1:22:21] comforter. He says that I will be with
[1:22:24] you. Not just with you but even in you.
[1:22:29] So now we are living in an age where God
[1:22:31] is not walking just with
[1:22:34] us where God is walking in.
[1:22:39] Oh, so now Satan doesn't have to say why
[1:22:41] did you bring me to
[1:22:44] Jesus? But now he has to say why did I
[1:22:46] go inside of you? Because Jesus is
[1:22:50] there. So if tells you why did you bring
[1:22:54] me to Jesus,
[1:22:55] you need to tell him I didn't bring you
[1:22:57] to Jesus. You came
[1:22:59] yourself. Why? Because the word became
[1:23:02] flesh. Why? Because I'm looking at the
[1:23:04] word flesh this
[1:23:06] morning. Because now you are the living
[1:23:08] epistles read of all
[1:23:10] men. You are with the walking
[1:23:13] message. Someone want to know the
[1:23:15] message of the
[1:23:17] hour. Satan does not care if you bring
[1:23:19] him
[1:23:23] tips. He does not care about that.
[1:23:26] Somebody asking for the message of the
[1:23:28] hour. He doesn't want you to show him
[1:23:30] that I am the
[1:23:33] message. This message is
[1:23:36] right. This message cannot just stay on
[1:23:41] tape. A message can become a
[1:23:45] person. Jesus is coming back for his
[1:23:48] bride and the Bible tells us that his
[1:23:51] bride will be just like
[1:23:53] him. Why? So that means you have to
[1:23:56] become the
[1:23:57] word because Christ is the
[1:24:00] word. And in order to become the word,
[1:24:02] you got to eat the
[1:24:05] word. That's how you overcome
[1:24:10] Satan. That's the mistake that Satan
[1:24:13] keeps
[1:24:14] making. Coming back to this, Satan has
[1:24:17] made a huge mistake this
[1:24:19] morning. Satan has made a huge mistake
[1:24:22] this morning.
[1:24:24] He's come to torment you,
[1:24:29] but he's not realizing that when he's
[1:24:30] tormenting you, he's touching that
[1:24:32] electricity.
[1:24:35] Satan needs to be uncomfortable around
[1:24:37] your
[1:24:39] life. As Christians, we should not let
[1:24:41] Satan be so comfortable with
[1:24:44] us. Jesus feels like he can come and
[1:24:46] dwell in your body and do what
[1:24:48] everything he needs to
[1:24:50] do. No, he needs to be uncomfortable.
[1:24:54] And if Satan is comfortable in your
[1:24:56] life, then something is wrong.
[1:24:59] And what am I talking about Satan being
[1:25:01] comfortable in your life?
[1:25:05] For for
[1:25:07] example, thank you. The Bible, the
[1:25:10] prophet
[1:25:11] is against uh for for instance women
[1:25:15] wearing makeups.
[1:25:20] bought. Thanks. And then the prophet
[1:25:22] tells us that those women they do it
[1:25:24] without even realizing it's not them,
[1:25:26] it's the spirit inside of them making
[1:25:28] them do.
[1:25:32] So now my question is why is the spirit
[1:25:34] so comfortable to just feel like he can
[1:25:36] come and make you do
[1:25:41] makeups? We're going to hit every spirit
[1:25:43] this morning.
[1:25:47] said, "The prophet is against
[1:25:51] alcohol." You know, in me other quotes
[1:25:54] that I have is not just specific. He's
[1:25:56] literally saying against drinking in
[1:26:01] general. And if you don't know it, then
[1:26:03] you just need to listen more to the
[1:26:07] tapes. And I pray that God's mercy be
[1:26:09] with you this
[1:26:12] morning because why is Satan so
[1:26:14] comfortable in your
[1:26:16] life? Why is Satan coming just to you
[1:26:19] and you drink and you know it's
[1:26:24] wrong. If you are truly a child of God,
[1:26:27] you know it's wrong.
[1:26:29] Unless you're not a child of God.
[1:26:33] The the prophet talks about that when
[1:26:35] when a child of God is living in sin,
[1:26:38] for instance,
[1:26:41] you're going to night clubs. I'm
[1:26:42] paraphrasing.
[1:26:44] You know, the prophet says that there's
[1:26:45] there's always been that thing about you
[1:26:47] that you just fell out of
[1:26:50] place. You just felt that you were
[1:26:52] different from everyone
[1:26:54] else. The prophet said, "Why was that?"
[1:26:56] It was because that germ, that seed of
[1:26:58] life was in
[1:27:00] you. When you are born in this world,
[1:27:02] that seed of life is already in
[1:27:06] you. You can do whatever. You can do the
[1:27:09] worst thing on earth, but you will still
[1:27:11] feel like you are
[1:27:14] different. Even when you are fooling
[1:27:16] yourself with a spirit of
[1:27:19] alcohol, you well know that it's wrong
[1:27:23] and you know that you're not supposed to
[1:27:25] do that. My question is, why is Satan so
[1:27:29] comfortable with it?
[1:27:32] He comes in because what it's even one
[1:27:34] thing if you do it at the bar at a
[1:27:38] bar but now satan is coming into even in
[1:27:41] your homes.
[1:27:44] I'm telling you somewhere there the
[1:27:45] blood has not been
[1:27:48] applied. You've made the devil very
[1:27:50] comfortable in your
[1:27:53] life. Amen. And as long as you make the
[1:27:56] devil comfortable in your life, he will
[1:27:57] keep tormenting you.
[1:28:01] That mania guy, he was in
[1:28:03] torment. The prophet tells us that those
[1:28:06] spirits don't
[1:28:07] die. Amen. We have received a kingdom
[1:28:10] that's more powerful than the kingdom
[1:28:12] kingdom of this
[1:28:14] world. This message of the hour is not
[1:28:16] just just some tapes or some
[1:28:20] books. It's a reality. It's a power.
[1:28:24] It's a power that that God knew that in
[1:28:27] this church of in this church of Leodia
[1:28:29] we needed that
[1:28:31] power. What is the power? It's a power
[1:28:34] of perfection.
[1:28:37] It's a the message came to restore
[1:28:39] everything that was
[1:28:42] loose. Clarity to every question.
[1:28:50] Amen.
[1:28:51] Amen.
[1:28:53] Another person who found mercy with God
[1:28:56] was
[1:28:57] the prophet brother Brhamet
[1:29:00] the prophet he was born in a family
[1:29:03] again I didn't even plan to talk about
[1:29:05] alcohol but now it's tying with the
[1:29:07] prophet because the prophet said he was
[1:29:08] born in a family full of
[1:29:15] alcoholics the prophet was he was even
[1:29:17] ashamed like the the last name Brham was
[1:29:20] a really shameful name to
[1:29:26] heaven. He was in name in a family of
[1:29:29] murderers. His dad was a murderer
[1:29:36] and and he still had that blood of his
[1:29:38] father in him that that he was a growing
[1:29:41] up the prophet used to be a he had used
[1:29:43] to have a lot of
[1:29:49] temper and one time he went to shoot
[1:29:52] someone because that person killed his
[1:29:55] dog.
[1:29:57] The prophet wanted to kill that person.
[1:30:01] Let's read our quote.
[1:30:04] In the fifth
[1:30:06] seal, the prophet says, "I felt
[1:30:08] something lick my hand.
[1:30:12] There was my old
[1:30:15] dog. When Mr. Shorts down here poison
[1:30:19] him, I swear I'll kill Mr. Short for
[1:30:22] it."
[1:30:24] I was about 16 16 years
[1:30:27] old. Remember when so after he already
[1:30:30] received the visitation from the
[1:30:33] angel when he was a child in that tree
[1:30:35] and he was carrying the bucket of water
[1:30:37] in the angel the voice spoke to him out
[1:30:39] of the
[1:30:40] tree. So after he heard the voice of the
[1:30:45] angel kill
[1:30:49] someone to show you
[1:30:51] that does not change you. What changes
[1:30:55] you is the blood of Jesus.
[1:30:58] The prophet had to be
[1:31:00] converted. Even though he heard the
[1:31:02] voice of God, the voice of God did not
[1:31:05] change him. What changed him was the
[1:31:07] blood of Jesus
[1:31:09] Christ who asked for forgiveness for his
[1:31:15] sins. He says he poisoned him, give him
[1:31:18] a dog button.
[1:31:22] My daddy caught me with a
[1:31:25] rifle going down to shoot
[1:31:29] him right here in the police
[1:31:32] station is is is is a sh
[1:31:36] fellow like Satan is because it wasn't
[1:31:39] the prophet by himself. It's Satan that
[1:31:41] was driving to
[1:31:43] do but he's setting him up in a place
[1:31:45] where like doing right in front of the
[1:31:47] police station.
[1:31:51] Satan just want
[1:31:53] trouble. He'll set you up and he'll be
[1:31:56] the first one to accuse
[1:31:59] you. And the said, "I said I'll kill
[1:32:03] him. I went over to the dog's
[1:32:07] grave. I buried him. I said freezed.
[1:32:11] You've been like a companion to
[1:32:13] me. You clothed me and sent me to
[1:32:16] school.
[1:32:19] When you got old, I was going to take
[1:32:20] care of
[1:32:22] you.
[1:32:25] Now, and I said, I promise you, freeze.
[1:32:29] That he won't
[1:32:31] leave. I promise you he won't
[1:32:34] leave. I catch him on the street
[1:32:38] sometime
[1:32:40] walking, then I'll run run right over
[1:32:44] him. And I said, I'll get him for you.
[1:32:50] a prophet saying
[1:32:51] something because you are born a
[1:32:54] prophet a
[1:32:56] prophet just like Isaiah you know when
[1:32:59] he saw himself at the temple he realized
[1:33:03] in the presence of God he realized that
[1:33:04] he was full of
[1:33:07] sin this is a problem he already heard
[1:33:10] the voice of God some of us may even
[1:33:13] have an excuse we may say we never heard
[1:33:14] in audio
[1:33:18] But he heard an audible voice of
[1:33:22] God. He still had that old nature.
[1:33:27] You know, but but he says, "But you know
[1:33:29] what? I led the man to
[1:33:33] Christ. I baptized him in Jesus
[1:33:36] name. I buried him at his death."
[1:33:41] Yes sir. I got converted about two years
[1:33:43] after that.
[1:33:47] things different
[1:33:49] then I loved him instead of hating
[1:33:52] him. You see what the mercies of God
[1:33:54] will do to your
[1:33:55] life change your vision. He will make
[1:33:59] you look at things
[1:34:01] differently. He will make you love your
[1:34:03] brother. That person that you used to
[1:34:05] hate, now you love the
[1:34:07] person. That person that you used to go
[1:34:09] months, days, weeks without speaking to,
[1:34:11] now you want to speak to that person.
[1:34:14] because you love that person and you
[1:34:17] realize that you are only what you are
[1:34:18] by the grace of
[1:34:21] God. If the mercies of God never stepped
[1:34:24] into his life,
[1:34:26] brother in jail for
[1:34:31] life and we would have not had the
[1:34:33] message of the
[1:34:34] hour. I would have not known brother
[1:34:37] Isaac. I would have not known brotherh
[1:34:40] Danny. I would have not known any of
[1:34:42] you.
[1:34:44] But the mercies of God, God actually saw
[1:34:47] you. God saw me. God saw you. God saw
[1:34:50] everyone here. And he's like, "No, I
[1:34:53] cannot let my servant do
[1:34:55] this." If he does this, then there won't
[1:34:57] be there won't be any of you this
[1:35:00] morning because the prophet tells us
[1:35:02] that God knows the end from the
[1:35:05] beginning. God knew that there had to be
[1:35:08] a Sunday morning, April 13th.
[1:35:12] people were going to come from crimes,
[1:35:16] Congo, from other
[1:35:19] countries together here this morning to
[1:35:21] hear the word of
[1:35:24] God. But in order to for for that to
[1:35:26] happen, I have to be merciful to myself.
[1:35:29] I have to the mercy of God is so good
[1:35:32] that when you want to do evil, sometimes
[1:35:33] he can't intervene and
[1:35:37] stop. Yeah, that's how good his mercies
[1:35:40] is to us.
[1:35:42] Sometimes you drive, you driving down
[1:35:44] the street. You almost want to hit
[1:35:46] someone,
[1:35:48] but the mercies of God steps in and you
[1:35:52] don't hit that person. Why? because of
[1:35:54] the mercies of God in your
[1:35:56] life. The mercies of God in your
[1:35:59] life. Maybe maybe Satan had already
[1:36:02] planned things for
[1:36:05] you months
[1:36:07] ago. Maybe you were supposed to be dead
[1:36:09] according to Satan's
[1:36:11] plan. Satan will get up one morning, on
[1:36:15] a certain day, I'm going to do this for
[1:36:16] you. I'm going to
[1:36:17] do this and I'll get him.
[1:36:23] No, but the mercies of God step into
[1:36:25] your life.
[1:36:29] The mercy of God steps into your life,
[1:36:35] brother Denny. The mercies of God
[1:36:37] stepped into your life,
[1:36:40] the devil tried to attack you. The devil
[1:36:43] tried to attack our brother. He tried to
[1:36:45] take his life, but the mercy of God
[1:36:48] stepped into your life. Why? the love of
[1:36:52] God. Why would God still want to protect
[1:36:56] you? Because he still has a work for you
[1:36:58] to
[1:37:00] do. You came into this world with a
[1:37:02] mission to be a son of
[1:37:05] God. And God will not permit. So God
[1:37:09] what pretty much what happened, God told
[1:37:11] Satan, go do anything else but don't
[1:37:13] touch his life.
[1:37:19] And we hear the brothers here in a
[1:37:21] Sunday morning.
[1:37:23] According to Satan's plan, he should
[1:37:25] have been in the hospital
[1:37:28] or maybe in a casket somewhere.
[1:37:31] But I'm grateful that God had another
[1:37:32] plan for
[1:37:33] you. I'm grateful that God saw you this
[1:37:37] morning say that I have to go down and
[1:37:39] protect my
[1:37:41] son. Satan, get your hand off of my son.
[1:37:45] Some of us sometimes, you know, many
[1:37:47] sometimes we have things that we don't
[1:37:48] even know that Satan has planned against
[1:37:53] us. But in the unseen world, the God is
[1:37:56] sending his angels to protect
[1:37:59] you. The Bible says that the angels of
[1:38:02] God encamped around them that fear
[1:38:06] God. God is sending your angels around
[1:38:08] you to protect you from evil.
[1:38:14] as long as his job with you is not
[1:38:18] done your life.
[1:38:24] The mercy of God.
[1:38:26] So many good examples in the Bible.
[1:38:32] The woman who came to Jesus at the well,
[1:38:35] she was again a woman of she couldn't be
[1:38:37] stable with husbands.
[1:38:41] kept switching husband to husband to
[1:38:43] husband to
[1:38:45] husband. Such an unstable life.
[1:38:49] She probably wondered. She's like, "Why
[1:38:51] am I like
[1:38:53] this?" She knew better. She knew the
[1:38:55] word because when the word came, she
[1:38:57] recognized the word. So, she knew the
[1:38:59] word. Sometimes you know what you know
[1:39:02] that you need to do right and you want
[1:39:05] to do right, but you just keep finding
[1:39:07] yourself doing wrong.
[1:39:10] And you keep asking why Lord why I'm
[1:39:13] trying to overcome
[1:39:15] this. Paul says the good that I'm trying
[1:39:18] to do I
[1:39:19] don't that's this woman she probably was
[1:39:22] trying to do
[1:39:24] right she's like maybe this husband is
[1:39:26] going to be different
[1:39:28] maybe the same issue you know the
[1:39:32] problem is when she kept switching
[1:39:34] thinking that by switching husband he
[1:39:36] would solve her problems.
[1:39:40] But she didn't realize that she needed
[1:39:41] to first in order for her
[1:39:44] to sometimes when we have things in our
[1:39:47] life, we want to blame someone else for
[1:39:49] that. We think that, oh, I need to move
[1:39:51] to another
[1:39:53] state. I need to move to another church.
[1:39:57] I need to leave my house. I need to do
[1:39:58] this
[1:39:59] thing. Have you thought about yourself
[1:40:02] first?
[1:40:04] Have you thought that maybe if you had
[1:40:06] more tolerance
[1:40:08] Maybe you had more
[1:40:10] love. Maybe if you actually got more on
[1:40:12] your knees and pray for the situation.
[1:40:17] This woman, she
[1:40:19] came, she was unstable. But when she met
[1:40:23] Jesus, her life was changed. She became
[1:40:27] a witness of the
[1:40:29] word. Again, that's the same pattern.
[1:40:32] People with issues, they go to Jesus.
[1:40:37] So why won't he do it for
[1:40:40] you? Why won't he do it for you? It's
[1:40:43] your own fault. You're not going to him.
[1:40:47] He wants to do it for you. The prophet
[1:40:49] says that. I was reading that this week.
[1:40:52] He said that God wants to fill you with
[1:40:54] the Holy Ghost more than than you want
[1:40:57] to. So then why don't you have the Holy
[1:41:00] Ghost?
[1:41:02] It's your own fault.
[1:41:05] Have you tried to to let the word
[1:41:07] sanctify you?
[1:41:10] Because in order for the Holy Ghost to
[1:41:11] fill you, the vessel has to be
[1:41:16] clean. And how are you going to be
[1:41:18] sanctified when you don't listen to the
[1:41:20] word? We are too
[1:41:23] busy. The Bible tells us that we are
[1:41:25] washed by the water of the
[1:41:28] word. It's the word that sanctifies us.
[1:41:32] It's the word that conditions you into a
[1:41:34] place where the Holy Ghost can now come
[1:41:36] into you.
[1:41:39] So now what you need to do if you need
[1:41:40] the Holy Ghost, listen more to the word
[1:41:42] of God.
[1:41:44] The more you listen to the word of God,
[1:41:46] it's going to break those bondages of
[1:41:49] sin. Those those grips, those holes of
[1:41:52] Satan that were in your life was going
[1:41:53] to become weak.
[1:41:56] Why? Because he that is in you is
[1:41:59] greater than he that's in the word.
[1:42:01] Because when you eat the word, you
[1:42:03] become the word. And when you become the
[1:42:05] word, you become more powerful than you.
[1:42:11] Romans chapter 4:8
[1:42:29] The Bible
[1:42:31] says, "Blessed is the man to whom the
[1:42:34] Lord will not impute
[1:42:38] sin." Satan goes and accuses to God, but
[1:42:41] you are blessed because God is not
[1:42:43] imputing sin to
[1:42:47] you. Do you realize that when you walk,
[1:42:50] you are a blessing walking?
[1:42:53] Maybe you just don't realize that.
[1:42:54] That's why you let the enemy kick you
[1:42:59] around. Blessed is the man to whom the
[1:43:02] Lord will not impute
[1:43:06] sin. Who is that man that the Lord will
[1:43:08] not impute
[1:43:09] sin? Is that man which under the blood?
[1:43:14] So I'm walking with a blessing.
[1:43:18] You are a blessing, brother. You came in
[1:43:20] this church being a blessing.
[1:43:22] You are blessed. Everyone here is a
[1:43:25] blessed. You are
[1:43:27] blessed and walk like someone who is
[1:43:30] blessed.
[1:43:32] Imagine you they gave you $10 million in
[1:43:34] the bank but you keep you just keep
[1:43:37] borrowing money from people. Oh, can you
[1:43:39] borrow me
[1:43:40] $10? Can you give me five
[1:43:43] bucks? People going to be like what's
[1:43:45] going on with you? Imagine if Elon Musk
[1:43:48] come came right now
[1:43:50] and just keeps asking everybody, "Oh,
[1:43:52] can you borrow me
[1:43:54] $5?" Like, why is he acting like
[1:43:57] that? It's not is this Elon Musk?
[1:44:01] Are we sure this is Elon
[1:44:05] Musk? That's what Satan is doing. He's
[1:44:07] like, "This guy is a son of God.
[1:44:12] Are you sure that person is blessed?
[1:44:14] Because your church is not walking like
[1:44:15] someone who's
[1:44:17] blessed. Why? It's an amnesia. You have
[1:44:20] forgotten that God has blessed you. And
[1:44:23] I'm reminding you this morning that you
[1:44:25] are
[1:44:25] blessed. Start walking like someone was
[1:44:29] blessed. On Monday morning when you go
[1:44:31] to work, they got to notice a
[1:44:33] difference. Why is everything different
[1:44:35] with you
[1:44:38] today? When they bring problems before
[1:44:40] you, why are you not glad? Because I'm
[1:44:42] glad.
[1:44:44] When any situation comes in your
[1:44:47] life, why? Because I am
[1:44:50] blessed. Why are you solving things
[1:44:53] differently than everybody else?
[1:44:55] Because I am
[1:44:57] blessed. Satan needs to start. But I
[1:45:00] kick this guy around. But he's still
[1:45:02] happy. He still comes to church. Why?
[1:45:05] Because I am blessed. You might have
[1:45:08] blinded me
[1:45:09] before. That's how blessed I was. Right
[1:45:13] now, the prophet says you need to
[1:45:14] believe what the word says about
[1:45:18] you. To believe what the word says about
[1:45:22] you. I'm choosing to believe that I am
[1:45:26] blessed. Joshua said, "Choose this day
[1:45:29] whom you will
[1:45:31] serve. Be free to make your
[1:45:33] choices. But I know that as for me and
[1:45:37] my we will serve the
[1:45:40] Lord. If you want to walk any ways you
[1:45:43] want to walk, go ahead.
[1:45:45] But I know that as for me, I'm going to
[1:45:48] walk like someone who is
[1:45:50] blessed because I am a living
[1:45:53] blessing. The blessing doesn't just come
[1:45:56] to me. I become the
[1:45:57] blessing. When you walk into someone's
[1:46:00] life, you bring blessings with you.
[1:46:03] You go to someone's house, the person is
[1:46:05] blessed. They don't
[1:46:06] understand because I had a blessing in
[1:46:08] my house. The blessing came in the form
[1:46:11] of a
[1:46:12] man comes into your house, you
[1:46:16] always. And when you become the
[1:46:18] blessing, you interact with someone,
[1:46:20] that person feels
[1:46:21] blessed. I understand why things are
[1:46:24] working in my
[1:46:26] life. Why? Because I had a blessing.
[1:46:29] Benediction. No wonder Jesus says that
[1:46:31] in that day you will say that when when
[1:46:33] did I clothe
[1:46:36] you? When did I give you food? When you
[1:46:39] were hungry.
[1:46:40] Why? Because Jesus came in your house.
[1:46:44] The blessing came in your house and you
[1:46:46] took care of the
[1:46:47] blessing. That's why we need more
[1:46:50] fellowship. I want more blessings to
[1:46:52] come in my life. God is still free to
[1:46:54] come in my life. I want more blessings.
[1:46:57] You don't want to stand for yourself.
[1:47:01] Me and my house I want
[1:47:05] the that's why Satan want to divide you
[1:47:11] because an army divided cannot
[1:47:15] stand. I want Isaac to give me his
[1:47:18] blessing. I want another blessing. I
[1:47:21] want all the blessings that you have.
[1:47:22] When we combine all these blessings,
[1:47:24] isn't that what the Holy Ghost does?
[1:47:27] Jesus in him dwell the fullness of God.
[1:47:32] But in us, it's droplets of it's drops
[1:47:34] of those of the of
[1:47:37] God. You know the Holy Ghost, the full
[1:47:39] Holy Ghost divided himself among the
[1:47:41] church.
[1:47:44] And the prophet says that's when Jesus
[1:47:45] says that the works that I do, you shall
[1:47:47] do greater.
[1:47:49] Why? Because now the Holy Ghost is not
[1:47:51] just working in one man but it's working
[1:47:53] in multiple men. And when you combine
[1:47:56] all that it's the body of
[1:47:59] Christ. That's what I'm talking about.
[1:48:01] The blessing. Christ is the main
[1:48:04] blessing. But when you that blessing is
[1:48:07] split into everyone
[1:48:10] here and when we gather
[1:48:13] together all those blessings are
[1:48:15] gathered and what does it do? The
[1:48:17] blessing pushes us the curse.
[1:48:20] The blessing pushes out the curse
[1:48:23] things that that some some of you may
[1:48:26] have had cursing curses in your
[1:48:30] life. Start having more blessings around
[1:48:33] you. You're going to drive all the
[1:48:35] curses in your
[1:48:36] life that you couldn't figure out. Now
[1:48:39] you're going to start to figure that
[1:48:41] out. I want blessing in my
[1:48:44] house. Send your blessing.
[1:48:47] Lord send your
[1:48:49] blessings. I'm pretty sure everyone here
[1:48:51] wants blessings. Then we have to say
[1:48:54] Lord send your
[1:48:55] blessing because he said you have not
[1:48:57] because you ask
[1:49:00] not. And sometimes you have it but you
[1:49:03] don't realize that you have
[1:49:04] it because you don't read the word. You
[1:49:08] don't realize that the word says that
[1:49:10] you are
[1:49:11] blessed. Amen. It's a it's a revelation.
[1:49:15] It's a revelation to
[1:49:17] know. That's why you need to change the
[1:49:19] way you read the
[1:49:21] Bible. Make it personal to
[1:49:24] you. When you open this book, you should
[1:49:27] be curious to be like because this book
[1:49:28] is about you.
[1:49:31] I want to be curious in the morning. I
[1:49:33] want to wake up. Lord, what do you say
[1:49:34] about me?
[1:49:39] Because imagine if you had you had a
[1:49:40] house that was full of uh uh we weapons.
[1:49:47] and okay, let's say you have a you have
[1:49:48] a house full of weapons and one of them
[1:49:51] was an atomic weapon
[1:49:55] and you hear that there is a fighting
[1:49:58] going on on the street and it's going
[1:50:00] house to house
[1:50:02] and they're fighting with knives or
[1:50:07] machetes if you don't have any weapons.
[1:50:11] Let's say you had those but you didn't
[1:50:12] know you had those weapons.
[1:50:14] What is going to be your reaction? You
[1:50:16] will be
[1:50:17] frightened. You will be scared. You
[1:50:20] might even walk out of your house and
[1:50:22] try to run to just follow the
[1:50:26] crowd. But someone who knows what they
[1:50:29] have, they know that I have an atomic
[1:50:33] weapon that are more powerful than what
[1:50:35] they
[1:50:36] have. Then I'm not
[1:50:39] afraid. That's the same thing with you.
[1:50:42] You read the Bible, you you you keep you
[1:50:46] keep being frightened by situations in
[1:50:48] your life.
[1:50:51] But if only you could realize that what
[1:50:53] you have is greater than
[1:50:55] those. If only you could realize that
[1:50:58] what you have is Jesus
[1:51:01] Christ. If Christ lives in you, he'll
[1:51:04] continue to do the greater
[1:51:07] work. You know, 2 Corinthians 5:1 19
[1:51:13] speed. Um, I had 17 pages and I'm still
[1:51:17] on the third page,
[1:51:20] but I won't go to all the 17 pages. So,
[1:51:23] I will skip a few things. So, 2
[1:51:26] Corinthians 5:1 19th,
[1:51:31] the Bible says to which that God was in
[1:51:34] Christ reconciling the world unto
[1:51:37] himself.
[1:51:41] not imputing their trespasses unto
[1:51:46] them, but has committed unto us the word
[1:51:49] of reconciliation.
[1:51:54] You know the key word here, not imputing
[1:51:55] their trespasses unto them.
[1:51:59] Let me skip
[1:52:07] um this. Yeah, let's let's read the
[1:52:11] invis invisible union of the bride of
[1:52:14] Christ.
[1:52:19] The paragraph
[1:52:20] 222, the the prophet says, "You
[1:52:22] separated from your first
[1:52:26] union by spiritual death.
[1:52:30] Now you are born
[1:52:32] again, remarried
[1:52:34] again to the new spiritual
[1:52:38] union of not your natural life of the
[1:52:41] things of the world but of eternal
[1:52:46] life. That germ, that germ that was in
[1:52:49] you at the
[1:52:51] beginning found
[1:52:53] you. Now your old book is
[1:52:57] gone with your old union.
[1:53:02] Your name in your old book has been
[1:53:06] transferred. Now you say, "Do you mean
[1:53:09] to tell me that my old book?" Yes. God
[1:53:11] put him in the seat of his
[1:53:16] forgetfulness. You stand perfectly
[1:53:19] before
[1:53:20] God. So don't let the enemy tell you
[1:53:23] anything else.
[1:53:24] The word of God is telling you that your
[1:53:26] sins, your old book has been thrown in
[1:53:28] the sea of
[1:53:31] forgetfulness. Now your name is now in a
[1:53:34] new
[1:53:36] book, not the book of
[1:53:39] life, but the lamb's book of
[1:53:42] life, you know, not the old book of your
[1:53:45] natural union,
[1:53:48] but your new your new
[1:53:52] your new bride.
[1:53:55] No, it's
[1:54:01] um Romans 5:1 says, "Therefore, being
[1:54:05] justified by fa by faith, look at the
[1:54:08] word." The word don't mean
[1:54:12] forgiven. The word means justified.
[1:54:16] It don't mean you are forgiven.
[1:54:19] For instance, you heard I got drunk and
[1:54:22] done some evil things and
[1:54:28] everything. Then you come around say to
[1:54:30] me, you found out I didn't do
[1:54:33] them. You say, "Brother Brandham, I
[1:54:36] forgive
[1:54:37] you. You can forgive
[1:54:39] me in the
[1:54:41] first now. If I did do
[1:54:45] it, but you could forgive
[1:54:47] me, then I wouldn't be
[1:54:50] guilty. But yet, I'm not
[1:54:53] justified because I actually done
[1:54:56] it. But the word justified is
[1:55:02] don't. It's not even
[1:55:07] regarded. God's book of the sea
[1:55:13] of God's book of sea of forgetfulness.
[1:55:19] Your old book and marriage is divorced
[1:55:21] and dead.
[1:55:25] Even in the memories of
[1:55:27] God, you know, there's another place I
[1:55:29] don't have the quote for it, but I
[1:55:31] remember a long time ago. The
[1:55:33] prophet sometimes we go to God
[1:55:38] for God is like like I don't know what
[1:55:41] you're talking
[1:55:43] about. Like forgive you for what? Okay,
[1:55:47] let me go check. Let me go check again.
[1:55:49] And he goes checking and he still don't
[1:55:51] see it.
[1:55:52] I don't know what you tell. You have
[1:55:54] nothing to be
[1:55:56] forgiven because all he sees is the
[1:55:58] blood of
[1:56:00] Jesus. You know,
[1:56:02] it's the mercies of God. The prophet
[1:56:05] says, "You are
[1:56:07] justified. He was
[1:56:09] accused. You was
[1:56:11] accused. You never done it in the first
[1:56:15] place. The whole union is in the sea of
[1:56:18] of God's forgetfulness.
[1:56:21] He says you weren't even married to it
[1:56:23] to begin
[1:56:23] [Music]
[1:56:25] with. So now the prophet is taking it
[1:56:27] further. He says not just that the book
[1:56:29] has been
[1:56:31] thrown, but you weren't even married to
[1:56:34] it. So it's not your fault. The devil
[1:56:38] thought that you were married to it. You
[1:56:40] just you just came into this world with
[1:56:43] it. But you you chose
[1:56:50] you know Mary to it to begin
[1:56:53] with. He took your place.
[1:57:01] Amen. So let's go uh Romans chapter 8
[1:57:04] verse 33. Romans 34 uh uh
[1:57:10] The prophets, the Bible says, "Who shall
[1:57:12] lay anything to the charge of God's
[1:57:14] elect?"
[1:57:18] It is God that justif.
[1:57:22] Who is he that
[1:57:25] condemnth? Who is he that condemn? It is
[1:57:27] Christ that
[1:57:31] died. So he's saying that therefore
[1:57:34] nothing can be charged against you.
[1:57:40] Because the judge
[1:57:41] himself is your
[1:57:44] lover. Because the judge himself is
[1:57:47] Christ. He's the one that gives the
[1:57:50] verdict. He's the one
[1:57:52] that he died already for
[1:57:55] you. Now, let me try to wrap this up.
[1:58:09] Okay.
[1:58:12] Um, you know, so do we, the Bible says
[1:58:14] that he that the son has made free is
[1:58:17] free indeed.
[1:58:21] And we understand that Jesus on the
[1:58:23] cross when he he died and he says it is
[1:58:26] finished that made you free.
[1:58:29] Because the Bible says that by his
[1:58:31] stripes
[1:58:33] Are you healed?
[1:58:36] So everything was finished on Calvary.
[1:58:40] You don't have to remain bond bond to
[1:58:43] sin
[1:58:46] anymore. The Christ is not going to
[1:58:49] blame you for your
[1:58:51] sin, but he blames you for refusing to
[1:58:55] accept that he there is a mercy for you.
[1:58:59] We just read in the Bible that his mercy
[1:59:01] is on you every
[1:59:04] morning. So the the the the fault is
[1:59:07] that you are not accepting his mercy.
[1:59:10] That's why you all continue to live in
[1:59:12] sin.
[1:59:15] It's like the I remember the prophet
[1:59:17] talks about that bird that was
[1:59:20] freed. a birth was freed and he was so
[1:59:23] used to being in
[1:59:26] bondage that he kept behaving as if he
[1:59:28] was still in bondage even though he was
[1:59:33] free. That's a lot of Christians this
[1:59:36] morning that day on Calvary already
[1:59:38] freed you. The prophet says that if you
[1:59:41] went to Jesus and you say heal
[1:59:44] me, he told you I he'll tell you I
[1:59:47] can't. He'll point you back to
[1:59:50] Calvary. He'll say I already did
[1:59:53] it. So that's the same thing. A lot of
[1:59:56] people are living as if they are still
[1:59:58] bound
[2:00:01] bound. But I'm here to tell you that the
[2:00:03] word is
[2:00:08] already. Psalm 103:10, he has not dealt
[2:00:12] with us after our
[2:00:16] sins, nor rewardeth us according to our
[2:00:19] iniquities.
[2:00:22] The mercies of
[2:00:23] God be the prophet says iniquity is when
[2:00:27] you know what to do right, but you do
[2:00:28] what's
[2:00:30] wrong. And a lot of us are guilty of it.
[2:00:34] But David is telling us that we his
[2:00:37] chosen he does not deal with us
[2:00:40] according to our iniquities.
[2:00:45] Isaiah chapter 40 verse 1-2. Comfort ye
[2:00:48] comfort you my people sayaith your
[2:00:53] God comfortably to Jerusalem and cry
[2:00:56] unto
[2:00:59] her that her warfare is
[2:01:02] accomplished that her iniquity is
[2:01:06] pardoned for she has received of the
[2:01:09] Lord's hands doubled for all her sins.
[2:01:20] I'm trying to find a quote to close
[2:01:22] with.
[2:01:36] Paragraph 137.
[2:01:40] The prophet says that many of you here
[2:01:43] tonight,
[2:01:45] [Music]
[2:01:47] the doctors turn you
[2:01:50] down. There are people sitting in them
[2:01:53] wheelchairs. They'll probably never come
[2:01:54] out of there.
[2:01:59] They are there to stay.
[2:02:02] Some of them paralyzed in different
[2:02:07] ways. Apply to this. They say paralyzed
[2:02:10] in different
[2:02:11] ways. So even in spiritual ways, some of
[2:02:14] some of you this morning
[2:02:17] paralyzed. You can't move. You can't
[2:02:19] move spiritually with
[2:02:22] God. Someone who's par uh uh someone who
[2:02:25] is par paralyzed.
[2:02:28] You can correct me if I'm wrong. You
[2:02:29] cannot feel the place where you're
[2:02:30] paralyzed. Right.
[2:02:33] Exactly. So some of us the presence of
[2:02:35] God comes in the place and we don't even
[2:02:37] feel his
[2:02:39] presence. Paralyzed spiritually.
[2:02:43] I know that God is here this
[2:02:45] morning. But some are don't even know
[2:02:48] how like they cannot even feel his
[2:02:51] presence paralyzed
[2:02:56] spiritually in different ways.
[2:03:00] They wouldn't come out.
[2:03:03] Some of some people here the move of God
[2:03:05] has been in this church but they
[2:03:06] couldn't even feel the presence of God.
[2:03:08] They've never felt that before.
[2:03:16] Because when you are born again, you you
[2:03:18] are born into another kingdom.
[2:03:21] So when the things of the kingdom start
[2:03:23] happening here, you
[2:03:26] will feel it. You will feel that I'm
[2:03:29] feeling something from another
[2:03:31] dimension. Something that other people
[2:03:33] cannot
[2:03:35] feel. You can feel it because you are
[2:03:37] born into that
[2:03:40] dimension. But you've been paralyzed
[2:03:42] spiritually.
[2:03:46] They would never they couldn't come out.
[2:03:48] There is no way for them to come out.
[2:03:53] It may seem like you you it's been
[2:03:55] years. You you always go to church. Oh,
[2:03:58] I know the message. Brother is a
[2:04:00] prophet. I just wear dress to go to
[2:04:03] church. I wear skirts to go to
[2:04:06] church. But I I've never really failed
[2:04:09] God.
[2:04:11] I've I don't even I've never experienced
[2:04:13] God. I don't even know if God is real. A
[2:04:17] lot of people a lot of churchgoers are
[2:04:19] just sympathizers.
[2:04:22] You just sympathize because you you
[2:04:24] weren't born knowing that you have to go
[2:04:25] to
[2:04:28] church. But I'm telling you, this is
[2:04:31] more than that.
[2:04:33] There's a reality to God. God is very
[2:04:36] real.
[2:04:38] You know, I used to I used to be like
[2:04:40] that too.
[2:04:42] I used to just go to church and like go
[2:04:44] to and one time it started it started
[2:04:46] bothering me.
[2:04:49] I used to be like then how can I like
[2:04:51] how do I even know that God is real?
[2:04:55] Am I just going to church like what if
[2:04:57] this is just something that I was born
[2:04:59] into just thinking it's real?
[2:05:05] There's just that one thing about when
[2:05:07] you're a child of God, you you know you
[2:05:09] longing some you not in your you feel
[2:05:11] like you out of place.
[2:05:14] You want to get back to your original
[2:05:16] position.
[2:05:18] we have to get back to our original
[2:05:20] position and I was like God like I don't
[2:05:23] know if you are
[2:05:25] real and it started bothering me
[2:05:29] and I started praying about that and one
[2:05:32] one Friday
[2:05:34] evening because it used to be that um I
[2:05:37] would see people falling in the spirits
[2:05:40] and other people speaking in tongues and
[2:05:42] all that but I I was like how do I know
[2:05:45] that they're not faking it?
[2:05:49] I was like, "How do I even know that
[2:05:51] it's
[2:05:53] real? I've never experienced God. How do
[2:05:56] I know that?" Like, I really, it really
[2:05:58] bothered me. We used to live in Iowa
[2:05:59] City.
[2:06:01] So, one Friday, I told God, I was like,
[2:06:04] "Lord,
[2:06:05] today, it's time for me to know if you
[2:06:08] are real or
[2:06:10] not." I told God that I need to know
[2:06:12] that those people aren't faking it.
[2:06:16] I don't want when other people talk when
[2:06:18] they ask me about Jesus, I just have to
[2:06:20] give them other people's experience.
[2:06:26] And some of us are in that condition
[2:06:27] today.
[2:06:29] You cannot right now someone out comes
[2:06:31] from the street and they tell you that I
[2:06:34] need
[2:06:39] Jesus. How? Because you don't even know
[2:06:41] Jesus.
[2:06:43] You don't even have faith in your own
[2:06:45] Jesus.
[2:06:47] You don't even have faith that you can
[2:06:48] go to him and pray,
[2:06:51] "Father, here's here's someone who is
[2:06:54] looking for
[2:06:55] you because you never had that
[2:06:58] experience. I don't blame you. You never
[2:07:00] had that experience. So you how can
[2:07:04] you because you've never met a real
[2:07:08] God?" And to be honest, that's a that's
[2:07:10] what makes it different.
[2:07:13] Someone who has met Jesus is always
[2:07:16] different than someone who's never met
[2:07:18] Jesus.
[2:07:20] The prophet says that you give me
[2:07:22] someone who has met you who has the Holy
[2:07:24] Ghost. Just keep talking and I'll kill
[2:07:26] this person has been with
[2:07:28] you. You cannot fake it. If someone has
[2:07:33] truly had an experience, you can have
[2:07:36] experience and there is plenty of
[2:07:38] experience for you to have experience.
[2:07:42] You can have it
[2:07:45] today. Don't limit God.
[2:07:49] And yeah, I'll go back to my story.
[2:07:50] Yeah. I was like I told God that I need
[2:07:52] to know that you're real.
[2:07:56] And that day I went to
[2:07:57] church. Please. That was the first time
[2:08:00] I ever got in the spirit.
[2:08:03] The spirit of God took control over me
[2:08:06] and I started screaming like never
[2:08:08] before. God answered my prayer.
[2:08:12] God showed me that he's real and after
[2:08:15] that I keep I kept having experiences
[2:08:17] after
[2:08:19] experiences and I don't know if brother
[2:08:22] would would remember
[2:08:24] that it got to a place where I started
[2:08:27] having so many experiences that my faith
[2:08:29] in God started to increase
[2:08:32] and I wasn't really getting worried
[2:08:34] about situations.
[2:08:37] So one time I I remember I think he lost
[2:08:39] my mom's credit card
[2:08:42] And we knew that if you lose mom's
[2:08:44] credit card, it's really a
[2:08:47] problem. She's going to talk so much.
[2:08:49] She's going to
[2:08:51] complain. And I was in the basement and
[2:08:53] I heard there was a commotion in the
[2:08:55] living room. I think he was arguing or
[2:08:56] something like
[2:08:57] that. That was
[2:09:00] in. And I called him downstairs to come
[2:09:03] downstairs. Now things were different
[2:09:05] with me. I had I had met a God who is
[2:09:09] real. I knew that I can talk to him like
[2:09:12] like like a son talks to his
[2:09:15] father. And I told Gaddy, I was like,
[2:09:18] Gaddy, this is what happened to me. I
[2:09:20] had an experience last week. Something
[2:09:23] similar like that happened and God
[2:09:24] showed me where
[2:09:27] the same God who did it for me, he can't
[2:09:29] do it for you. Instead of arguing and
[2:09:32] all that, they just get an
[2:09:35] easy and he still didn't take me
[2:09:38] seriously.
[2:09:39] He was laughing. He thought it was all a
[2:09:42] joke
[2:09:44] because they had I was a different man.
[2:09:46] He just didn't know it
[2:09:48] yet. We met God.
[2:09:51] And I told him I was like, "Let's get on
[2:09:53] our knees and
[2:09:55] pray." And we got on our knees and we
[2:09:58] prayed. And I told God that God, this is
[2:10:01] the card that was
[2:10:02] lost. I know that the Bible says, "You
[2:10:05] know all things.
[2:10:07] you know exactly where that card
[2:10:09] is. You can lead us to that
[2:10:12] card. I said in the name of Jesus
[2:10:14] Christ,
[2:10:16] amend he still was
[2:10:20] disbelieving. He went upstairs and I
[2:10:23] knew he was he still wasn't taking me
[2:10:26] seriously and I I don't even think even
[2:10:29] five minutes went by.
[2:10:33] I I I remember I think I heard a not a
[2:10:35] voice but it was something that spoke to
[2:10:36] me and told me exactly where the card
[2:10:40] was something close to I don't remember
[2:10:42] it's been
[2:10:44] long a lot of minutes went by we found
[2:10:46] the
[2:10:48] card you know and it's happened several
[2:10:51] times in my life
[2:10:54] that sometime I don't worry about that's
[2:10:56] why sometime people don't understand I
[2:10:58] don't worry about
[2:10:59] situation and when I do I get on my
[2:11:01] knees and I ask God to get me back in
[2:11:05] line I know that God is
[2:11:10] real and And I want every one of you to
[2:11:13] meet
[2:11:14] him because it will make you a different
[2:11:17] person. My life has been changed since
[2:11:20] then.
[2:11:22] I've had several one
[2:11:25] time I needed
[2:11:28] $300. That was a long time ago,
[2:11:31] too. I came to church and I and I was
[2:11:33] broke.
[2:11:35] I really was broke.
[2:11:37] You know, I was telling my family, um, I
[2:11:40] was looking at my previous taxes from
[2:11:42] multiple years
[2:11:43] ago when I was a student and I realized
[2:11:47] that I really was
[2:11:49] broke and I needed
[2:11:53] $300 and I remember, yeah, this is a
[2:11:57] good testimony. So, I I hadn't paid my
[2:11:59] tithing.
[2:12:03] I didn't pay my tithing
[2:12:06] and I was like but but I wanted to pay
[2:12:09] my tithing but I didn't have money.
[2:12:12] So what it happened I had done several
[2:12:14] months of not paying my
[2:12:16] tithing. Now I wanted to take all that
[2:12:18] money together and pay it all at
[2:12:20] once and it was $300. So that's why I
[2:12:24] needed that money. I needed money so I
[2:12:26] can pay for my time because I wanted to
[2:12:28] be right.
[2:12:31] So imagine I wasn't even right with God
[2:12:33] because I hadn't paid my
[2:12:34] tithe. But God saw my intentions that my
[2:12:37] intention was right were right with
[2:12:39] you. If you're struggling paying your
[2:12:42] tithing, ask God to help
[2:12:45] you. So I asked God for
[2:12:48] $300 and I finished
[2:12:50] praying. And as I finished praying, I
[2:12:53] forgot about my prayer.
[2:12:56] And um what was that again? I remember
[2:12:59] brother Brooks sent me a message
[2:13:05] and he said that the Lord told me to
[2:13:07] tell you that he heard your prayer,
[2:13:12] you know. He told me that and I was like
[2:13:14] I was like okay that's that's a very
[2:13:16] broad statement like what do you mean? I
[2:13:18] have so many prayers that I
[2:13:24] make. How do I know that this is I
[2:13:27] literally prayed about $300 and he's I
[2:13:30] was I mean I was nice about it. I was
[2:13:31] like thank you but it still didn't
[2:13:33] answer my question.
[2:13:38] And then brother Brooks comes to church
[2:13:42] and I used to I almost used to leave her
[2:13:45] church during those days.
[2:13:47] I remember one time brother Marshall he
[2:13:49] used to come to church and he asked me
[2:13:50] brother do you have a home?
[2:13:55] Even Frank can be a witness. I used to
[2:13:57] live with Frank before my family moved
[2:13:59] to De Mo and Frank said that you're
[2:14:01] going to have problems if you get
[2:14:02] married because you always at church all
[2:14:04] the time.
[2:14:08] So, Brother Brooks came to church.
[2:14:11] And he cames and he says he feels in his
[2:14:13] heart to give me $300.
[2:14:17] He gave me $300
[2:14:20] and I took that money, not even telling
[2:14:22] him why I needed that. I took that
[2:14:24] money, I put that in an envelope and I
[2:14:25] gave it back to God as well.
[2:14:29] So I know that God is real.
[2:14:32] You know, that's why I said last Sunday,
[2:14:34] a lot of us are living under privileges.
[2:14:38] We have a God. God is so earning. God
[2:14:41] wants you to ask him.
[2:14:44] God doesn't want you to to to to uh
[2:14:47] struggle when situations come before
[2:14:49] you.
[2:14:52] So there's a difference when someone
[2:14:53] meets
[2:15:02] God. different
[2:15:04] ways. I'll just read it from here.
[2:15:07] Paralyzed in different they couldn't
[2:15:08] come out. There's no way for them to
[2:15:10] come out. But God rich in mercies has
[2:15:12] provided an atonement.
[2:15:16] So many of people paralyzed
[2:15:20] spiritually. The mercies of God is
[2:15:23] here. He's saying that you can also have
[2:15:26] an experience with him.
[2:15:28] That was not only for brother Brandham.
[2:15:31] That was not only for brother Brooks.
[2:15:33] That's not only for me. That's also for
[2:15:36] you. His mercies on you every every
[2:15:39] morning.
[2:15:41] He says, "Don't turn it
[2:15:43] down. Receive
[2:15:46] it. If you're ready to receive the
[2:15:48] mercies of God this morning, just stand
[2:15:50] on your feet."
[2:15:55] Apparently, people didn't understand
[2:15:56] what I said.
[2:15:58] If you are ready to receive the mercies
[2:16:00] of
[2:16:01] God, stand on your
[2:16:04] feet and if you don't, you can say you
[2:16:07] can sit
[2:16:09] down. Don't the prophet is saying don't
[2:16:12] turn it
[2:16:13] down. Receive
[2:16:15] it. There's men out there with hard
[2:16:18] trouble.
[2:16:20] So he said hard trouble but I said there
[2:16:22] are men out there with troubles,
[2:16:26] things that trouble you in your life,
[2:16:28] things that trouble you in your in your
[2:16:31] house, in your career.
[2:16:34] There's people with
[2:16:35] cancers that the that the doctors can do
[2:16:39] nothing
[2:16:41] with. He says you are hopeless.
[2:16:45] You are
[2:16:47] helpless in this world.
[2:16:49] helpless.
[2:16:51] When you feel like you've asked for all
[2:16:52] the help you could
[2:16:56] and you still don't have the help you
[2:16:58] need,
[2:17:00] Jesus want to be your
[2:17:02] help. Jesus want to be your
[2:17:04] hope. The prophet says, "But
[2:17:07] God rich in
[2:17:10] mercy. Hallelujah. He's not poor in
[2:17:13] mercy. God is rich in mercy. If you want
[2:17:17] to feel God,
[2:17:19] God's in he's rich in mercy.
[2:17:22] If you want to have an experience with
[2:17:25] God, God is telling you he's rich in
[2:17:27] mercy.
[2:17:30] God rich in his mercy has sent down the
[2:17:33] Holy Ghost.
[2:17:38] I know God is here. I
[2:17:44] can't hallelujah.
[2:17:47] God has sent down the Holy Ghost.
[2:17:53] Let's make this personal this morning.
[2:17:55] God reaches mercy. He knew your
[2:17:58] conditions.
[2:18:00] And he has sent down the Holy Ghost.
[2:18:03] The Holy Ghost is
[2:18:05] here. God rich in his mercy has the Holy
[2:18:08] Ghost
[2:18:10] and is right here now to confirm the
[2:18:12] word.
[2:18:15] The Holy Ghost is right here to confir
[2:18:17] his mercy. He's still there for
[2:18:20] you. No matter how far you feel like
[2:18:22] you've
[2:18:24] gone, no matter what the sins you've
[2:18:28] committed, God's mercy is
[2:18:30] here. There's a fountain filled with
[2:18:33] blood.
[2:18:36] God is here right now to confirm the
[2:18:39] word to prove that he's the same
[2:18:43] yesterday and forever.
[2:18:46] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. What was it
[2:18:50] yesterday? He forgave the woman at the
[2:18:53] well. He forgave the woman that was
[2:18:55] caught in
[2:18:56] adultery. He changed their lives. Where
[2:18:59] was he
[2:19:00] yesterday? He gave mercy to the prophet.
[2:19:06] Why was he yesterday when the prophet
[2:19:08] was shot in the leg and he was dying? He
[2:19:12] was living in sin and he was going to
[2:19:15] hell. He cried out, "Lord, be merciful
[2:19:20] today." That same God is the same today.
[2:19:25] He's the I am.
[2:19:29] Jesus is here
[2:19:31] today. And he's the same yesterday,
[2:19:34] today, and
[2:19:37] because we deserve it.
[2:19:41] There's none of us that deserve it.
[2:19:45] Fix your expectation first. Know that
[2:19:48] you don't deserve his mercy. Lord, I
[2:19:51] don't deserve your mercy. I know my
[2:19:53] life. I know how many times I fall
[2:19:57] short. Even I come for the same thing
[2:19:59] time after time. Lord, forgive me.
[2:20:01] Forgive me.
[2:20:02] And then I repeat the same thing again.
[2:20:05] Forgive me. I repeat the same but he
[2:20:08] hasn't given up on you because every
[2:20:11] morning his
[2:20:13] mercy. Amen. Thank you Lordra. He says
[2:20:18] because it's not because we we deserve
[2:20:20] it but it's because God is rich.
[2:20:24] Now that's the
[2:20:26] one that's the
[2:20:28] person. It's the Lord Jesus.
[2:20:32] He's not dead,
[2:20:34] brothers. Jesus is not dead.
[2:20:38] You can experience God. He's not dead,
[2:20:42] but he has risen from the dead.
[2:20:45] And he is alive forever more.
[2:20:50] That's the news that Satan doesn't want
[2:20:52] to
[2:20:54] hear. He's alive
[2:20:57] forever. Satan tried to kill Jesus on
[2:20:59] the cross.
[2:21:01] Jesus is alive.
[2:21:03] But what Satan is even fearing is he
[2:21:05] doesn't want that Jesus.
[2:21:10] You need the Holy Ghost.
[2:21:12] You need to make
[2:21:17] Jesus. How many people want the Lord
[2:21:19] Jesus to be in their
[2:21:22] heart? He's seeing your hands right now.
[2:21:25] Jesus is seeing your
[2:21:27] hands. Still with him. Remember, don't
[2:21:31] be sincere with
[2:21:34] me because I cannot give you the Holy
[2:21:37] Ghost. I cannot change your life. But I
[2:21:40] know a God who
[2:21:42] can
[2:21:44] say have I not
[2:21:47] Peter. As such as I have, I give it all.
[2:21:52] I don't have any money, but what I have
[2:21:55] is the Lord
[2:21:56] Jesus. I can I give you the Lord
[2:22:00] Jesus. It's that person.
[2:22:03] He is the same yesterday.
[2:22:08] And look what the prophet says.
[2:22:12] He's still just as rich in his mercy as
[2:22:15] he was to the woman that had a blood
[2:22:18] [Music]
[2:22:22] issue. He's still as merciful as he was
[2:22:26] to that woman.
[2:22:29] What did you do yesterday? What did you
[2:22:31] do that you feel like it's condemning
[2:22:33] you so bad?
[2:22:36] What did you do the past 10 years that
[2:22:38] the
[2:22:42] devil is still the same
[2:22:45] today? You know, he says he he's still
[2:22:48] the same that woman that had an issue of
[2:22:51] blood. A woman that was
[2:22:54] sick, she had had an issue of blood for
[2:22:57] seven
[2:22:59] years, but she
[2:23:01] made it throughout her life. The prophet
[2:23:05] tells us that the same mercy is still
[2:23:06] the
[2:23:08] same. Whatever sickness you
[2:23:11] have, God's mercy is still the
[2:23:16] same. And she started through the crowd.
[2:23:21] There was no hopes for her.
[2:23:25] No hopes for her. The doctors had done
[2:23:28] all that they could.
[2:23:31] She had a blood issue. She was dying
[2:23:35] and she touched the master's
[2:23:39] garment. This morning you have touched
[2:23:41] the master's
[2:23:43] garment. blood rich in
[2:23:47] mercy. I told her of her
[2:23:50] condition and she was healed of this
[2:23:54] blood. Foul prostitute went up to a well
[2:23:57] one
[2:24:03] day. She had been excommunicated from
[2:24:06] the
[2:24:06] virgin from around the people. Her life
[2:24:10] was no good.
[2:24:13] What's the use of trying?
[2:24:16] Is that what you're saying? What's the
[2:24:18] use of coming to church?
[2:24:21] What's the use of trying to be a
[2:24:23] Christian? I keep falling finding myself
[2:24:26] in
[2:24:27] repeating. I I once used to say
[2:24:30] that. I got to a point where I was
[2:24:33] finding myself repeating the same
[2:24:34] mistake after
[2:24:37] them. Then what's the point?
[2:24:40] If God won't deliver me, then what's the
[2:24:42] point of
[2:24:45] coming? If if if God be with us, then
[2:24:49] where are all the miracles?
[2:24:53] Is this message true or not?
[2:24:56] You need to come to that question to
[2:24:59] experience that. Ask yourself, is this
[2:25:02] message true?
[2:25:05] And if this message is not true to you,
[2:25:07] then stop coming to church.
[2:25:11] You have to get into a place where the
[2:25:12] message is becomes a
[2:25:16] reality. I have experienced God. I know
[2:25:20] it's true. So can
[2:25:22] you say what's the use of
[2:25:25] trying? Turn out there's nothing left of
[2:25:28] me.
[2:25:30] But she
[2:25:31] looked standing over on the
[2:25:34] side and sitting by the side of the
[2:25:37] well. And there was a man sitting there
[2:25:39] who told
[2:25:43] her, "She looked, brother, sister,
[2:25:48] look, God rich in
[2:25:52] mercy." The same God tonight, the
[2:25:55] prophet says,
[2:25:58] "The same God this afternoon. He's just
[2:26:01] as rich in his
[2:26:03] mercy and just the same as he was with
[2:26:06] them
[2:26:07] days. Do you believe that? I read that
[2:26:10] one more
[2:26:11] time. That same God to this
[2:26:15] morning, not the God of the
[2:26:18] past, but this
[2:26:21] morning, he's just as rich as he
[2:26:27] was. Amen. Amen.
[2:26:30] How many wants healing?
[2:26:33] Raise your hand. If you need the Holy
[2:26:35] Ghost to
[2:26:37] raise you need deliverance, raise your
[2:26:40] hand. You can talk to him in your seat
[2:26:42] or you can come pray
[2:26:45] here. I want you to talk to
[2:26:48] God here and he want to hear you talk to
[2:26:52] him. Whatever you have, God's mercy is
[2:26:55] here this morning.
[2:27:00] Don't turn it down. I prophesy don't
[2:27:02] turn it
[2:27:03] down. It's not in my hands anymore. It's
[2:27:06] in your
[2:27:08] hands. Pardon is pardon when it's re
[2:27:11] it's been received after.
[2:27:16] Let's sing. There is a fountain.
[2:27:19] There there
[2:27:21] is a found 10
[2:27:26] filled with blood drawn
[2:27:34] from
[2:27:38] ve and
[2:27:41] sinners

[2:27:45] plunge the flood.
[2:27:48] lose

[2:27:55] guilty. Lose
[2:27:57] all. Lose
[2:28:00] all their
[2:28:03] guilty and stop praying to God. Stop
[2:28:06] talking to him. Lose
[2:28:10] all who you are, wherever you are.
[2:28:14] There's the mercy of God this morning.
[2:28:16] God in my

[2:29:00] him who comes to
[2:29:01] him. As long as you're sincere with him,
[2:29:04] he's there for you.
[2:29:09] Wash
[2:29:11] all. This is the
[2:29:17] way. Wash

[2:51:49] [Music]
[2:52:04] Tell your
[2:52:09] [Music]
[2:52:20] sweet death.
[2:52:22] [Music]
[2:52:40] What happened is that God confirmed to
[2:52:42] you that his his mercies are new every
[2:52:47] morning. God confirmed to you that he's
[2:52:49] still just as merciful to you as he was
[2:52:52] to those others.
[2:52:57] but if some didn't understand
[2:53:01] French when the spirit got into the
[2:53:04] sister she was saying that they are
[2:53:07] lost they are
[2:53:09] lost maybe there's still one person who
[2:53:12] hasn't responded to the
[2:53:15] call wherever you are in your
[2:53:18] seat you having a mind battle whether
[2:53:21] you should come to get prayed for or not
[2:53:26] because God is rich in
[2:53:28] mercy. He's extending his call
[2:53:31] again. He's making a second call to you.
[2:53:35] Wherever you are, don't let pride get
[2:53:39] ahead of
[2:53:41] you. I'm making a second call
[2:53:45] again. If you feel like you should have
[2:53:47] been in the altar praying and you
[2:53:50] didn't, the altar is open.
[2:53:53] We're going to sing again.
[2:53:56] The mercies of God on you every morning.
[2:54:01] Don't let nothing hinder you.
[2:54:06] Jesus will not leave one of you
[2:54:09] behind. And he's very
[2:54:11] merciful.
[2:54:14] Again, again I ask,
[2:54:17] you know, don't say when the day of of
[2:54:20] judgment comes, don't say that you
[2:54:22] weren't asked. I'm asking again. You
[2:54:25] know, nothing is guaranteeing you that
[2:54:26] you're going to leave a day from
[2:54:28] now. Nothing is guarantee you. Brother
[2:54:31] Keith was at church before he passed
[2:54:33] away. We had a good service with him and
[2:54:37] the evening he passed away. Nothing is
[2:54:40] guaranteeing you even the next hour. Are
[2:54:42] you sure that if you were to die right
[2:54:44] now, you are right with
[2:54:47] God. Are you sure? Examine your lives
[2:54:50] right now. Well, the fountain of God is
[2:54:52] open. The mercies of God is still here
[2:54:55] right
[2:54:56] now. Examine your lives. And if you feel
[2:54:59] like you need to
[2:55:02] come, I mean making a second call, the
[2:55:06] altar is open.
[2:55:09] is
[2:55:12] [Music]
[2:55:17] you go
[2:55:19] [Music]

[2:59:18] [Music]
[2:59:55] your
[2:59:56] [Music]
[3:00:03] street.
[3:00:05] Amen. Let's let's pray. Let's bow our
[3:00:08] head.
[3:00:10] Dear heavenly father, Lord Jesus,
[3:00:14] how good you have been to us, Lord.
[3:00:19] Lord, you never fail us, Lord.
[3:00:22] You never fail to be merciful to
[3:00:25] us. As the lamentation says, it is the
[3:00:28] goodness of the Lord. It's because of
[3:00:30] his mercies that we are not
[3:00:33] consumed because your mercies are new
[3:00:35] every
[3:00:36] morning. Oh, this afternoon you I had
[3:00:38] another
[3:00:40] sermon. No wonder I couldn't I just felt
[3:00:43] something was
[3:00:45] off and you knew that your children
[3:00:47] needed to hear this
[3:00:49] one. And Lord, a lot of them have have
[3:00:52] responded, Lord, and some from their
[3:00:55] seats, some here. But Lord, you wouldn't
[3:00:58] give a message unless if it had to have
[3:01:00] a
[3:01:01] purpose because you said in your word,
[3:01:03] Father, that the word of God will not
[3:01:05] return void.
[3:01:07] but he will always accomplish the
[3:01:08] purpose for which
[3:01:10] you Lord Jesus you sent your word of
[3:01:12] mercy to them this
[3:01:14] morning and we trust that he's
[3:01:16] accomplished the purpose for them. I
[3:01:18] pray, oh Lord God, that you said in your
[3:01:20] word that though their sins may be red
[3:01:24] as a
[3:01:25] crimson, I'll make them white as
[3:01:27] snow. Lord, they've all confessed their
[3:01:30] sins. Lord, they've repented, Lord.
[3:01:33] Right now, as your servant, I pray in
[3:01:36] the name of Jesus Christ, that you wipe
[3:01:38] all their sins away,
[3:01:40] Lord, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ
[3:01:42] that you see of
[3:01:45] forgetfulness. Oh, Satan, you are
[3:01:47] defeated.
[3:01:48] Satan, you pointing at the old
[3:01:51] book, but their names have been written
[3:01:53] in the lamb's book of
[3:01:55] life. Their sins are
[3:01:58] forgiven. They are new creatures in
[3:02:01] Christ. They have responded to the call.
[3:02:04] Satan, you have lost. Satan, your
[3:02:07] kingdom has been teared
[3:02:08] down. Satan, get your hands off the
[3:02:11] properties. In the name of Jesus Christ,
[3:02:14] I pray that the Holy Ghost in the name
[3:02:17] of Jesus Christ, I pray that the fire of
[3:02:19] God touch their life. In the name of
[3:02:22] Jesus Christ, Satan lose them in the
[3:02:26] name of Jesus Christ. I pray that the
[3:02:29] bondage of Satan be
[3:02:31] broken. Oh, the Holy Ghost will
[3:02:34] consume. I pray that the fire of God
[3:02:38] come and consume whatever God
[3:02:43] Satan, you had another
[3:02:45] agenda. Satan, you had another agenda.
[3:02:48] But they came to Jesus.
[3:02:51] They came to Jesus.
[3:02:53] Satan, you made a
[3:02:54] mistake. They came to the power of all
[3:02:57] time. And in the name of Jesus Christ,
[3:03:01] that power is breaking you
[3:03:03] down. Get your hands off of them. They
[3:03:06] are the property of God. Jesus bought
[3:03:09] them with his blood.
[3:03:11] You have tormented them so long.
[3:03:15] Today is the day.
[3:03:17] Today is the day.
[3:03:20] Brothers and
[3:03:22] sisters, are you ready to let the devil
[3:03:24] go?
[3:03:27] Brothers and sisters, you are the one
[3:03:29] that have to decide. I'm not deciding
[3:03:32] for you.
[3:03:34] I'm asking
[3:03:35] again. Do you want to be set free?
[3:03:39] Do you want that demon to leave you?
[3:03:42] Have you confessed your
[3:03:45] sins in the name of Jesus Christ?
[3:03:48] Satan, leave them in the name of Jesus
[3:03:52] Christ. Satan, you are weak. Hallelujah.
[3:03:56] Hallelujah. The power of God is there.
[3:03:58] In the name of Jesus Christ, Satan,
[3:04:01] leave them.
[3:04:06] [Applause]
[3:04:10] Hallelujah.
[3:04:12] [Music]
[3:04:21] In the name of Jesus Christ.
[3:04:23] That's the sound of freedom.
[3:04:27] Oh, when the children of Israel were
[3:04:31] freed, Miriam started dancing with a
[3:04:34] tambourine.
[3:04:36] What they were hearing were the sound of
[3:04:38] freedom.
[3:04:41] Tonight this
[3:04:44] afternoon, you all hear the sound of
[3:04:46] liberty.
[3:04:48] They are free.
[3:04:50] They are free.
[3:04:53] They are free.
[3:04:58] Don't let Satan kick you around.
[3:05:01] The enemy is defeated.
[3:05:06] Why?
[3:05:07] Because God rich in mercy.
[3:05:12] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[3:05:14] God rich in mercy.
[3:05:18] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Think about the
[3:05:21] mercy of God. Just think about his
[3:05:23] mercy.

[3:05:27] Why you? Because God rich in mercy.
[3:05:34] Your sins are forgiven.
[3:05:39] Your sins are forgiven.
[3:05:42] [Music]
[3:05:44] They are thrown in the sea of
[3:05:46] forgetfulness.
[3:05:50] But God want you to be thankful for his
[3:05:53] mercy.
[3:05:58] Because it's his mercies that doing all
[3:06:00] the work.
[3:06:03] I can't do nothing on my own.
[3:06:06] I can't do nothing on my own.
[3:06:09] But God rich in his mercy provided this
[3:06:12] message to this morning.
[3:06:16] Are you grateful to God?
[3:06:20] Show him your gratitude.

[3:06:27] Israel were set free from
[3:06:30] bondage, they danced. They marched,
[3:06:34] Miriam had a tambourine.

[3:10:15] just lay your hand on your
[3:10:19] neighbor and we're going to
[3:10:22] [Music]
[3:10:24] pray. Dear heavenly father, Lord Jesus,
[3:10:28] thank you for your goodness.
[3:10:30] Thank you for your mercy. Thank you for
[3:10:32] this service. Thank you for healing us.
[3:10:36] Thank you for forgiving our sins. Thank
[3:10:38] you, Lord, for saving us. Thank you for
[3:10:41] sending us the message
[3:10:42] of Lord. Thank you for giving us a
[3:10:46] church. Above all, Lord, thank you for
[3:10:48] your blood.
[3:10:51] Jesus, I pray that you bless your
[3:10:54] children. Lord, we read that we are
[3:10:57] blessed because the Bible says, "Blessed
[3:10:59] is the man to whom the Lord will not
[3:11:01] impute
[3:11:03] sin." Lord, I pray that you send your
[3:11:05] blessings in their lives as they're
[3:11:08] laying their hands on each other.
[3:11:10] I pray that whosoever came in this
[3:11:12] church a little bit sick, give him
[3:11:14] healing in the name of Jesus Christ. I
[3:11:17] pray that you set the captive free. I
[3:11:19] pray that you provide to their needs
[3:11:22] that you protect them throughout the
[3:11:23] week. That this week may be a different
[3:11:26] week that this week may be a week full
[3:11:28] of blessings. Why? Because we have
[3:11:31] received the mercies of God. Let that
[3:11:34] this week they may walk differently.
[3:11:35] Lord Jesus, I pray right now, Lord, that
[3:11:39] you dwell inside of them. I pray that
[3:11:42] you install yourself in their hearts and
[3:11:45] that you live with them. Lord, be with
[3:11:47] them throughout the week, at work, and
[3:11:49] everywhere. And we thank you for this
[3:11:51] service in the wonderful name of Jesus
[3:11:55] Christ. Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[3:12:08] And I think we had birthday um some
