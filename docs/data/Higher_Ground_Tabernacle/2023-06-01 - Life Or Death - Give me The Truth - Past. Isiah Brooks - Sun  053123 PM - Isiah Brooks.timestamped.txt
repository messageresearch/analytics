[38:09] thank you
[38:17] foreign
[38:25] [Music]
[38:45] [Music]
[38:54] right into the word of God
[39:08] we started a message on last
[39:11] Sunday I just want to kind of do a
[39:14] another part of it
[39:16] we will actually talked about coming the
[39:19] word of the word becoming us
[39:21] dealing with what we have to do with
[39:24] this world that we're living in and
[39:27] one of the things was that we were to go
[39:31] beyond our boundaries you know all of us
[39:34] have boundaries
[39:36] um places where we feel comfortable uh
[39:40] not Crossing and so but but God requires
[39:45] us to go beyond that
[39:47] amen uh there's no places uh for our
[39:51] personal confidence uh when it comes to
[39:54] the Lord Jesus
[39:56] and um we'll try to give you an
[40:00] understanding of what that is but anyway
[40:02] uh the subject tonight would be life or
[40:05] death
[40:06] uh give me the truth
[40:12] so let us turn by God's grace to Romans
[40:14] 8. 14 8 14.
[40:18] familiar scripture
[40:29] Romans 8 14.
[40:33] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[40:36] God
[40:37] they are
[40:39] the sons of God
[40:43] John
[40:45] eight 44 through 46
[40:50] ye are of your father the devil
[40:54] and the lust of your father ye will do
[40:57] he was a murderer from the beginning and
[41:00] a bold not in the truth
[41:02] because there is no truth in him
[41:05] when he speaketh the LIE he speaketh of
[41:07] his own
[41:08] for he is a liar and the father of it
[41:12] and because I tell you the truth ye
[41:15] Believe Me Not
[41:17] which of you convinced me of sin
[41:20] if I say the truth
[41:22] why do you not believe me
[41:26] you love the Lord
[41:28] let us pray
[41:30] father God we come before you Lord Jesus
[41:32] as humble as we know how we thank you
[41:34] for all that you do for us Lord you have
[41:37] been better to us than we've been to
[41:39] ourselves and father we ask that you
[41:41] forgive us of our sins and cleanse us
[41:43] Lord God from all unrighteousness Lord
[41:45] we thank you for your mercy we thank you
[41:48] for your grace we just thank you for
[41:50] being Who You Are
[41:51] Lord and we thank you God for the many
[41:54] things that you have given to us in
[41:58] spite of
[41:59] but father we realize this is a serious
[42:01] hour and Lord we want to be more serious
[42:04] we want to be more consecrated we want
[42:07] to be more sincere and I pray father
[42:10] that you would give us this Lord granted
[42:12] because without you lord we will not
[42:14] make it in your name Jesus Christ we
[42:17] pray amen you may be seated first of all
[42:21] I want to make a statement you know
[42:23] there's nothing that we can do when it
[42:27] comes to our Salvation other than truly
[42:30] believing and the believing word that
[42:33] I'm working with is not a noun it's an
[42:36] action verb as an action it's a verb
[42:40] and so it's what we do we first believe
[42:44] and we continue to believe uh what Jesus
[42:47] Christ has already done for us this in
[42:50] itself will bring us into his very image
[42:53] and likeness of God
[42:55] because the word of God tells us that we
[42:57] need to follow him
[43:00] um when I talk about truth we realize
[43:03] that most people do not like truth
[43:06] because truth in itself uh hurts
[43:11] oftentimes because of who we are and
[43:14] basically uh what we have done or the
[43:17] things that we have done in life
[43:20] um but but nevertheless the Bible said
[43:23] the truth shall make you free
[43:26] um and no matter how much it hurts I
[43:29] want truth
[43:31] you know uh the truth is always followed
[43:34] by the minority never the majority
[43:37] that's right uh if you go through the
[43:40] scriptures you'll find out the majority
[43:41] of the people is always wrong
[43:44] it took that small minority of people
[43:46] that had the ability to hear from God
[43:49] and believe it
[43:52] um when it comes to uh who we are we
[43:56] must we make choices
[43:58] and oftentimes I put this way the
[44:01] choices in which we make
[44:03] uh is because of who we are
[44:07] now why would you say that I'll say it
[44:10] like this
[44:11] uh to to bring you where I'm going
[44:14] he was the Pharisees in the Sadducees
[44:16] the religious people of their day
[44:18] they had studied the word of God and
[44:22] they claim to be uh the uh children of
[44:28] God
[44:30] but when Jesus Christ came
[44:33] and he was able to identify them so was
[44:37] John the Baptist John the Baptist
[44:40] identified those who would not follow
[44:42] him as serpents
[44:44] and Jesus Christ came and he backed them
[44:47] up likewise
[44:49] uh and so much so Jesus even said my
[44:53] sheep heareth my voice in a stranger
[44:55] they will not follow
[44:57] many times they want truth I mean I
[45:00] think it was pilate that said uh to
[45:03] Jesus Christ what is truth
[45:05] uh you know because Jesus said I come to
[45:08] testify of that which is truth
[45:11] but you see the thing is if um
[45:14] oftentimes people say they want truth
[45:16] but when truth come
[45:19] they don't want it right because truth
[45:22] always changes you yes if truth doesn't
[45:26] change you it's not truth
[45:28] basically because we were born Sinners
[45:30] we were born shaped in iniquity speaking
[45:34] lies and you know all of those things
[45:38] but one thing about God he gives you a
[45:40] choice
[45:42] uh in your leadership
[45:45] he never makes a person follow him
[45:48] but he will give you the choice
[45:51] you can either follow him or follow the
[45:54] devil because you're going to follow
[45:56] somebody
[45:58] and if you follow Jesus he promised to
[46:02] give you eternal life
[46:05] and of course the children of the devil
[46:07] are the children are the devil and we
[46:08] know where they are
[46:11] Hallelujah as I said there are two types
[46:14] of people the children of God and the
[46:16] children of devil
[46:17] and there are no in between that's right
[46:21] now sometimes it takes an individual
[46:24] quite a long time to I come to the
[46:27] reality of who or she is
[46:30] it may even come to a place where
[46:32] they're on their deathbed and they
[46:34] recognize that Jesus Christ is their
[46:37] savior but it is a thing uh difficult
[46:41] it's it's how can I say it it's just
[46:43] you're playing Russian roulette when you
[46:46] do such a thing
[46:47] because Paul said make your call in an
[46:50] election sure
[46:51] there is a way to find out who you are
[46:55] and that is when you find the word and
[46:59] the word is true and you follow the
[47:02] truth
[47:03] the Bible said they that are led by the
[47:06] spirit of God they are the sons of God
[47:08] and we find out that there are so many
[47:11] people who don't even believe in the
[47:12] movement of the Holy Spirit
[47:15] they don't believe that the Holy Spirit
[47:17] exists they think that the holy spirit
[47:19] is some figment of our imagination
[47:23] but God is real
[47:26] amen and to the believer
[47:28] he will always be real
[47:31] is that right remember when I read the
[47:34] scripture Jesus said unto him because
[47:37] those which I wasn't his uh you are of
[47:41] your father the devil
[47:43] and the lust of your father you will do
[47:46] I mean the very fruits of your life the
[47:48] very fruits of your labor the whatever
[47:50] you do describes who you are and that's
[47:53] what the Bible said you'll know the tree
[47:56] by the fruit it bear now don't get me
[47:59] wrong people of God I'm not working you
[48:02] know sometimes when it comes to uh
[48:05] people's uh personalities a Christian in
[48:08] himself uh could have a demon on any
[48:11] Spirit or soul and still have the Holy
[48:14] Ghost uh and and those demons will
[48:17] direct your life uh in in a way that is
[48:22] not of God
[48:23] it it will it will enter into your flesh
[48:26] and your flesh in itself is is the enemy
[48:30] between God I mean they fight one
[48:32] another that your flesh don't want to do
[48:34] anything of God because it's hybrid it's
[48:37] it's part beast and part man
[48:39] is that right so we know amen that the
[48:43] word of God tells us that Romans 6 and
[48:45] I'm gonna try to go as fast as I can but
[48:47] it but not mix it up uh the thing that
[48:52] you draw that's driving you is what
[48:54] you're worshiping
[48:57] hello I'ma say that again the thing that
[49:01] you that that is driving you
[49:04] is the thing that you're worshiping and
[49:07] you know the scripture gives us the word
[49:10] and I'm going to give it to you in just
[49:11] a moment in Romans 6
[49:14] 16-23 it says know ye not that whom you
[49:19] yield yourself servants to obey
[49:22] his servant ye are to whom ye obey
[49:25] whether of sin unto death look what sin
[49:29] takes you unbelief unto death or to uh
[49:32] obedience unto righteousness
[49:36] but God but God be thanked
[49:39] that we were the Servants of sin but ye
[49:43] have obeyed from the heart that form a
[49:46] Doctrine which was delivered you amen
[49:50] right we as the Bible says we were all
[49:54] once children of Wrath
[49:57] without holy ghost or being born again
[50:00] we were Sinners we did everything that
[50:03] Sinners would do uh there was no
[50:05] difference between us
[50:08] and the man who we call sinner now we
[50:12] were all in the same pot
[50:14] being then made free from sin became the
[50:18] Servants of righteousness and this is
[50:20] what I want to dwell because when you
[50:22] come into Christ
[50:24] you are be you are made free from sin I
[50:28] mean free from unbelief
[50:31] right you get the Holy Ghost you'll
[50:33] never doubt it ever again amen
[50:36] Hallelujah you know God is real is that
[50:40] right
[50:41] see he says listen I speak after the man
[50:44] of men because of the infirmities of
[50:47] your flesh for as you have yield your
[50:50] members servants to uncleanness and to
[50:53] iniquity unto iniquity in other words
[50:55] once you start it doesn't stop
[50:58] yeah
[50:59] one thing continued continues continue
[51:02] to continue continue to continue
[51:03] continue and we we know one thing it
[51:05] becomes a burden right and and and this
[51:09] sin when it is accomplished it becomes
[51:12] what death when it when the lust is
[51:15] conceived like the brother said you are
[51:18] now pregnant with lust
[51:21] and once pregnated with lust it has to
[51:24] bring forth a child
[51:27] and that child is not going to be holy
[51:29] it's not going to be righteous whatever
[51:32] the lust is it will perform
[51:35] right even so now you are your members
[51:39] servants to righteousness unto holiness
[51:42] so if we use that same uh how could I
[51:45] say it if we resist the devil the Bible
[51:48] said he will flee from us
[51:51] and therefore we're yielding our members
[51:53] unto righteousness and that
[51:55] righteousness unto what holiness
[51:59] for when we were the Servants of sin ye
[52:03] were free
[52:05] from righteousness right when we were
[52:08] Servants of sin there were no such thing
[52:10] as righteousness in being a sinner
[52:11] you're a sinner you do sinful things
[52:14] that's what you do you enjoy it right it
[52:17] wasn't about righteousness what fruit
[52:19] have ye been in those things whereof ye
[52:23] are now ashamed for the end of those
[52:26] things is death
[52:29] and until we get to a place that we come
[52:32] to until we come to the place that we
[52:35] are ashamed
[52:37] of our failures
[52:40] ashamed of sin
[52:42] amen ashamed
[52:44] because if you're never ashamed you'll
[52:47] never be corrected
[52:49] correction won't come and this is why we
[52:52] come to the house of God to be corrected
[52:55] amen
[52:59] amen right but now being made free from
[53:02] sin
[53:03] and become servants to God you have your
[53:07] fruit unto holiness
[53:08] and the in everlasting life
[53:12] this brings us into holiness
[53:15] right
[53:17] the kind of Holiness that brings us into
[53:19] the statue of a perfect man but here it
[53:22] is and this is something we know but
[53:25] we've often fail to remember
[53:28] the wages of sin is death
[53:32] but the gift of God is eternal life
[53:34] through Jesus Christ Our Lord wages when
[53:40] you work in sin your wage is death
[53:46] what do you like
[53:50] what do you like
[53:52] that's that's really important
[53:54] especially nowadays
[53:57] but my readers a quote from the message
[53:59] leadership
[54:02] he said what do you what do you look
[54:05] like
[54:06] that was a what do you look like
[54:10] are you following what are you following
[54:14] what have we done
[54:17] you must choose your leader
[54:20] is that right I think it was Joshua
[54:23] saying choose you this day
[54:25] whom you going to follow
[54:28] choose today you choose life or death if
[54:32] you chew your your choice will determine
[54:35] your Eternal destination what you choose
[54:39] remember Jesus said follow me and you're
[54:43] invited tonight to do so and to follow
[54:46] him into eternal life you must come on
[54:51] his terms
[54:54] um
[54:55] that's right the word not upon the Creed
[54:58] not upon the public opinion not about
[55:01] what what anybody else thinks about it
[55:04] but on what God said about it
[55:08] you say well brother Benham I know a
[55:10] woman just as good as she can be she
[55:14] does this I know a man that went through
[55:17] this I can't help what they've done
[55:21] God's word he said let every man's word
[55:25] be a lie and mine be the truth amen amen
[55:29] you've got to come on his term come on
[55:32] his condition the word you cannot come
[55:36] through Creed you cannot come through
[55:39] denominations you cannot mix like that
[55:42] there's only one thing you can do accept
[55:46] it on his terms that you're willing to
[55:49] die to yourself and all your thoughts
[55:52] and follow him get rid of all the things
[55:56] of the world and follow me
[56:06] yeah we all need help don't we
[56:09] second chronicles 15 I talked about that
[56:12] and uh where they made a covenant
[56:15] and the Covenant was that they were
[56:17] going to pursue the Lord with all their
[56:19] hearts and I believe that I believe if
[56:23] we whether from the pulpit to the back
[56:25] of the door if we don't pursue the law
[56:28] with all of our heart
[56:29] we're going to be left behind
[56:33] and I got some stuff here tonight I hope
[56:36] I can get through it it's not something
[56:38] that we don't know it's something that
[56:41] we need to be reminded of
[56:45] I showed you there in Chronicles that
[56:47] Esau ASA which is Asa he was a doctor
[56:51] God used him I mean his name and
[56:54] Benjamin the son of my right hand and
[56:57] and Judah praise and Obed worshiper and
[56:59] and
[57:01] Azariah helped by God but they failed in
[57:05] a condition called maca
[57:07] and that means pressed down worn and
[57:10] fast and you know when something fast
[57:12] you down you can't get free of it
[57:15] oh
[57:16] how many of you've been there
[57:18] you've had a bad dream and you can't
[57:20] wake up yet you are awake
[57:23] and and you you want to get loose and it
[57:26] won't let you loose
[57:27] it pins you down that's marker that's
[57:31] kind of thing that kind of a demon will
[57:33] do to you
[57:35] it puts you in a terrible situation of
[57:38] sin and you can't get free
[57:41] it's locked you in it presses you it
[57:43] depresses you oppressing you whatever it
[57:46] puts you in a bad situation until you
[57:49] fight and you fight and you're fighting
[57:51] you fight you just all worn out that's a
[57:54] devil amen I need to get out of this
[57:58] situation
[58:02] and the word of God said it's possible
[58:04] yes
[58:04] but you got to seek the Lord God with
[58:07] all your heart
[58:09] that's when the blessings come
[58:11] when you seek the Lord with all your
[58:13] heart here's second chronicles 15 12-16
[58:16] says and they entered into a covenant to
[58:18] seek the Lord God of their father with
[58:21] all their heart and with all their soul
[58:24] that whosoever would not seek the Lord
[58:28] God of Israel should be put to death
[58:31] whether small or great whether man or
[58:34] woman what was it and then we had a
[58:37] prophet coming in our day it says
[58:39] desperation you have to be desperate if
[58:43] you don't get desperate you're going to
[58:45] miss it what is he saying you got to
[58:48] seek the Lord God with all of your heart
[58:51] life or death give me the truth
[58:56] I'm giving you the truth
[58:58] because most of the world don't even
[58:59] care about God most of the Christians
[59:02] are they're nothing they they're nothing
[59:04] about Jesus Christ is about Fame and
[59:08] riches and all of the wealth and things
[59:10] of that nature that's nonsense at a time
[59:14] like this
[59:18] foreign
[59:19] when judgment has already struck uh has
[59:22] struck the West Coast
[59:25] we've already already been prophesied
[59:27] California going down
[59:31] it's later than what we think
[59:34] and what's happening to the Christian
[59:37] it's getting so bad you can't even
[59:39] hardly find a lukewarm Christian
[59:41] everybody's growing cold
[59:44] think about it Sunday when I ministered
[59:46] I thought the altar of somebody would
[59:48] just I thought we were going to have
[59:50] some real weeping of some sort
[59:54] what do we get
[59:55] see something is happening to the people
[59:59] they don't see their condition
[1:00:03] they really think they're okay
[1:00:06] when they're not that's the same thing
[1:00:09] Israel thought
[1:00:11] when Titus came and you know Titus was
[1:00:13] judgment
[1:00:15] on Israel for rejecting Jesus
[1:00:19] and who did he destroy all of the
[1:00:22] so-called church people
[1:00:25] who fail to see Christ who fail to
[1:00:28] follow him
[1:00:31] Hallelujah guess what did they do what
[1:00:34] did they do it got so bad they were
[1:00:37] eating each other's children
[1:00:39] I got it in the scripture
[1:00:42] Jeremiah said they were getting eating
[1:00:44] each other children the father was
[1:00:45] eating his sons and all I got it
[1:00:48] and what you say oh brother
[1:00:50] oh brother gonna happen here
[1:00:53] you see it coming
[1:00:55] the handwriting is on the wall
[1:00:58] there's nothing new Under the Sun what
[1:01:01] has been will be
[1:01:05] he said oh not here look what they're
[1:01:08] doing they're trying to shut your food
[1:01:10] down anyhow what you're gonna do
[1:01:14] if you don't have God
[1:01:16] the Bible has already told you
[1:01:19] you should know these things
[1:01:22] you say oh no brother because it
[1:01:24] happened even in a time of Solomon
[1:01:27] two women came up before Solomon
[1:01:31] and they both had babies
[1:01:34] right
[1:01:35] a hard time it was a hard time
[1:01:41] and they kill one baby and they ate him
[1:01:44] and then the other lady stole you know
[1:01:47] how it goes
[1:01:49] but the truth of the matter is is
[1:01:52] horrific
[1:01:54] it's a horrible scene
[1:01:57] that those who know God would submit to
[1:02:01] such a thing because my question is
[1:02:03] after you eat somebody you still got to
[1:02:06] die
[1:02:08] that fool's gonna Digest
[1:02:11] and you're gonna get hungry again
[1:02:13] so who do you kill next
[1:02:16] and you know how calm it is
[1:02:19] what goes around come around
[1:02:21] you reap what you sow
[1:02:24] so you end up in somebody else's pot
[1:02:27] I know it sound crazy but it's the truth
[1:02:30] I'm telling you what we're getting ready
[1:02:33] to experience America
[1:02:36] has no idea what it is like or what it
[1:02:39] will be like
[1:02:44] people say oh we got poor people no go
[1:02:47] to India that's where the poor people
[1:02:49] are go some places in Mexico that's
[1:02:51] where you poor people are where they
[1:02:53] they don't even have clothes to wear
[1:02:56] right let me move on
[1:02:59] and they swear unto Allah the Lord you
[1:03:02] sound like brothers why use a you know
[1:03:04] Doom and Gloom I'm trying to warn us
[1:03:07] it's not a doom and gloom it's it's a
[1:03:10] warning
[1:03:12] amen I'm warning myself you think I'm
[1:03:14] preaching just to preach to you no no no
[1:03:16] this word comes back to me
[1:03:21] and while I Was preparing this message I
[1:03:24] was constantly repenting
[1:03:28] and they swear unto the Lord with the
[1:03:30] loud voice with the shouting with the
[1:03:32] trumpets and with coronets you see how
[1:03:35] they praising God and all Jews Rejoice
[1:03:37] at the oath for they had sworn with all
[1:03:40] their heart and sought him with all the
[1:03:43] whole desire and he found he he was
[1:03:46] found of them and the lord gave them
[1:03:48] rest around about them you hear what I'm
[1:03:50] saying with their whole desire and the
[1:03:53] Bible said they were he was found of
[1:03:56] them that's what the Bible said seek ye
[1:03:58] the Lord while he may be found amen
[1:04:01] seek him early cause when these things
[1:04:04] start rolling
[1:04:06] people going to seek God and they won't
[1:04:09] be able to find it right
[1:04:15] also concerning Marcus listen and Judah
[1:04:19] rejoiced at the oath 15th verse but they
[1:04:22] had sworn with all their heart and
[1:04:24] sought him with their whole desire and
[1:04:26] he was found of them and the lord gave
[1:04:28] them rest round about that's what we
[1:04:31] really need
[1:04:33] it's so concerning Maca the mother ASA
[1:04:36] the king he removed her from being Queen
[1:04:41] She ruled
[1:04:43] because she had made an idol in a Grove
[1:04:46] and Asia cut down the idol her Idol and
[1:04:50] stamped it and burned it and broke
[1:04:53] at the brook of kedron what was it what
[1:04:56] was going on everything that hindered
[1:05:00] the move of God he destroyed it amen
[1:05:03] Hallelujah hey man he wasn't like a A
[1:05:07] can that went out and got it and hid it
[1:05:11] but we find out that he knew what his
[1:05:13] mother was doing
[1:05:15] he went after her mama yeah he went out
[1:05:19] the mama and he destroyed
[1:05:23] laughs
[1:05:24] removed her from the from being the
[1:05:27] queen you don't have no more rulership
[1:05:28] here there's joy in the camp now
[1:05:33] depressed oppressed or anything there's
[1:05:36] joy in the camp why because the queen
[1:05:40] has been removed
[1:05:42] huh
[1:05:44] when desperation sets in there's nothing
[1:05:46] that's going to stop you from getting
[1:05:48] what you want
[1:05:49] is that right hey you know that's the
[1:05:53] truth
[1:05:54] you see this ambulance or these cars and
[1:05:57] they got a sick person in the car and
[1:05:59] the red light could be red they care
[1:06:00] nothing about it they go straight
[1:06:03] through it nothing's going to stop them
[1:06:04] from getting to getting to the place

[1:06:08] Hallelujah and I say this by the grace
[1:06:11] of God you pray for me and I pray for
[1:06:13] you because nothing is going to stop me

[1:08:06] become so complacent and so when you
[1:08:09] preach messages like this they say oh
[1:08:11] that's not for the message that's for
[1:08:13] the the the uh
[1:08:15] Pentecostals or whatever that that's not
[1:08:17] my idea yes it is
[1:08:19] I'm repeating to you what your Prophet
[1:08:22] said
[1:08:23] Hallelujah in 1963 after the seers were
[1:08:27] open
[1:08:31] huh see what it is you gotta it's like
[1:08:34] these people have gotten a secondhand
[1:08:37] religion
[1:08:38] yes it's been handed down since he's
[1:08:40] left and that's all they got
[1:08:43] but listen it doesn't God don't receive
[1:08:46] second-hand religion you got to have
[1:08:48] your experience yourself you must have
[1:08:52] the experience yourself
[1:08:55] Hallelujah and what we had in Pentecost
[1:08:58] ain't gonna work
[1:09:00] hello amen you know how I was when we
[1:09:04] was in the Pentecostal church or we
[1:09:06] thought we had it all but what have we
[1:09:08] done since we left it amen come on you
[1:09:12] go back to those same churches and
[1:09:15] they've gotten so worldly it's sickening
[1:09:19] but you shall receive power after which
[1:09:21] the Holy Ghost has come upon you right
[1:09:24] see we didn't understand we didn't
[1:09:25] understand the three dimensions we
[1:09:27] didn't understand the three parts of us
[1:09:29] we didn't understand that the Holy Ghost
[1:09:31] can fall on your flesh and you can shout
[1:09:32] and dance and cry and whatever more we
[1:09:35] didn't know that the Holy Ghost confide
[1:09:37] following your spirit and you can speak
[1:09:38] in tongues and all that kind of stuff
[1:09:40] but that's not where it's supposed to
[1:09:43] land it's supposed to be in the soul
[1:09:47] Hallelujah in the whole is of holy
[1:09:51] that's where he controls you from
[1:09:54] Hallelujah glory to God
[1:09:58] Proverbs 1 24-29
[1:10:02] see what we we looking at this thing and
[1:10:04] and and and you know the church will
[1:10:06] fill up almost and you know what what
[1:10:09] happens we you know let me tell y'all
[1:10:11] something there ain't no devil somebody
[1:10:13] said something to me the other day about
[1:10:15] that and I can't remember who it was but
[1:10:18] it was a male figure and uh you know and
[1:10:21] I I just basically said you know what
[1:10:24] the only person that's going to tell me
[1:10:25] I'm not going to make it
[1:10:27] it's Jesus Christ himself
[1:10:30] I don't care if it's a Prophet come up
[1:10:32] to me speaking in tongues and shouting
[1:10:34] and dancing
[1:10:36] and if he said thus said the Lord you
[1:10:38] ain't going to make it
[1:10:40] you know I tell him
[1:10:42] already done made it
[1:10:45] the word of God is already spoken on my
[1:10:47] behalf
[1:10:49] Hallelujah I just said to him you better
[1:10:52] be patient with me because God ain't
[1:10:53] through with me yet
[1:10:55] you hear what I'm saying amen amen
[1:11:00] oh so this is what he said Proverbs 1 24
[1:11:02] 29 listen hey like the prophet of God
[1:11:05] said it was it was Jacob who was the
[1:11:09] shyster
[1:11:12] and Esau was the good man
[1:11:14] that was from the outside but on the
[1:11:17] inside Jacob was the seed
[1:11:21] he just needed an experience with God so
[1:11:24] right now you might look like a Esau
[1:11:28] but God is trying to get to Jake up he's
[1:11:31] trying to get to the com the seed that
[1:11:33] can be converted
[1:11:36] Hallelujah
[1:11:38] you know they were twins right
[1:11:40] yeah
[1:11:42] yeah one represents the Flesh and the
[1:11:43] other one represents the soul
[1:11:48] ah
[1:11:50] Hallelujah
[1:11:52] because I have called
[1:11:54] and you refused
[1:11:56] I have stretched out my hand and no man
[1:11:59] regarded
[1:12:00] but ye have said and not all my counsel
[1:12:04] and with none of my reproof see that's
[1:12:07] what happens you preach and you preach
[1:12:10] and you preach people run right out of
[1:12:12] the congregation right into the best of
[1:12:14] you oh they
[1:12:17] like they hadn't heard nothing it went
[1:12:20] right then the Devil comes and steal
[1:12:22] everything they thought they had right
[1:12:24] out of their spirit and soul
[1:12:27] Hallelujah that's what happens the Bible
[1:12:30] said that children of God Israel heard
[1:12:32] the word but they rose up to play
[1:12:37] and that's what you see
[1:12:39] but you have said it not all my counsel
[1:12:41] and with none of my reprove I also here
[1:12:47] you go we'll laugh at your calamity
[1:12:50] I will mock when your fear cometh
[1:12:54] he said oh where will you be he gonna be
[1:12:57] in your he's going to be in your head
[1:12:58] right your conscience remember
[1:13:01] everything what do you think who do you
[1:13:03] think preached to you if if you go to
[1:13:05] hell it's your own conscience your own
[1:13:09] soul will condemn you because your old
[1:13:13] soul wants to live
[1:13:15] but your soul will tell you what he
[1:13:17] tried to get you to do and you would do
[1:13:20] it you would not
[1:13:25] when you feel coming there's desolation
[1:13:27] in your destruction cometh as a
[1:13:30] whirlwind
[1:13:31] when distress and anguish come cometh
[1:13:34] upon you then shall they call upon me
[1:13:37] but I will not answer
[1:13:40] they will seek me early but they shall
[1:13:43] not find me for that they hated
[1:13:45] knowledge and did not choose to fear the
[1:13:49] lord and that's you say oh brother
[1:13:51] someone the
[1:13:53] [Music]
[1:13:56] revelation
[1:13:57] God is talking to two C's amen amen
[1:14:00] hallelujah but he know the true seed of
[1:14:02] God will take heed to the word they love
[1:14:05] truth
[1:14:08] amen the word of the Lord that was
[1:14:11] spoken on Jeremiah what was it the
[1:14:13] Judgment of Israel you know Jeremiah God
[1:14:16] told Jeremiah said you're going to
[1:14:17] preach but ain't nobody going to repent
[1:14:21] sometimes I feel like Jeremiah
[1:14:26] oh yes ain't nobody gonna repent
[1:14:33] marker
[1:14:35] a spirit got you fastened down
[1:14:39] Lord free me because the Bible said he
[1:14:42] whom the son set free is free indeed
[1:14:49] but thus saith the Lord Jeremiah 16 9-12
[1:14:52] for thus said the Lord of hosts the god
[1:14:55] of Israel behold I will cause to cease
[1:15:00] out of this place in your eyes and in
[1:15:04] your day the voice of myrrh and the
[1:15:07] voice of gladness the voice of the
[1:15:09] bridegroom and the voice of the Bride
[1:15:12] now hey something you know what I'm
[1:15:14] saying what is he saying
[1:15:17] God is taking his people
[1:15:22] the bride has rapture
[1:15:24] that's the only time when the bridegroom
[1:15:27] and the bride is gone
[1:15:30] and it should come to pass when thou
[1:15:32] shall show this people all these words
[1:15:34] they shall say unto thee wherefore have
[1:15:37] the Lord pronounced all this great evil
[1:15:39] against us or what is our iniquity or
[1:15:43] what is our sin that we have committed
[1:15:46] against the Lord Our God then
[1:15:49] shall thou say unto them because your
[1:15:52] fathers have forsaken me see that's the
[1:15:55] thing and you can't blame people that
[1:15:58] have grown up in the message
[1:16:00] when their their fathers and their
[1:16:02] mothers for circum
[1:16:04] they could only give you what they have
[1:16:08] right this becomes a generational kind
[1:16:10] of curse thing because they can only
[1:16:13] give listen you can't give the holy if
[1:16:16] you don't preach the Holy Ghost if you
[1:16:19] don't bring that into the uh uh uh how
[1:16:22] can I say it into the picture
[1:16:25] and all you got is religion
[1:16:27] that ain't gonna work they're going to
[1:16:29] take your religion and that's all
[1:16:30] they're going to have is religion
[1:16:34] amen is that right oh that's what the
[1:16:38] Pharisees had when Jesus come he says
[1:16:40] listen you've done all these things you
[1:16:43] did everything right but you you you you
[1:16:45] missed them the more wavier things
[1:16:49] that compassion that love
[1:16:52] that Grace you missed it
[1:16:55] amen and that's what's happening right
[1:16:57] now people are missing the most
[1:16:59] weightier things and that's love
[1:17:02] hey let me say it like this by the grace
[1:17:05] of God it ain't just in the age of Grace
[1:17:07] no more we're in the Capstone where
[1:17:10] perfect love is supposed to be on
[1:17:12] display
[1:17:15] love love your labor love your enemy
[1:17:19] love love love that's what you and I
[1:17:21] suppose we do and when we don't do that
[1:17:24] we're coming up short may God have mercy
[1:17:26] on us
[1:17:28] Hallelujah
[1:17:31] do unto others as you would have them to
[1:17:33] do unto you
[1:17:36] does it come easy not when your flesh is
[1:17:39] in rule
[1:17:41] but when God is in rule it comes easy
[1:17:45] naturally like a lamb being a lamb
[1:17:51] then shall thou say unto them because
[1:17:53] your fathers have forsaken me said the
[1:17:55] Lord and have walked after other gods
[1:17:58] and have served them and have worshiped
[1:18:00] them and have forsaken me and have not
[1:18:03] kept my laws I can go down a list of
[1:18:06] things that people are doing and they
[1:18:08] don't even see it wrong anymore when
[1:18:10] brother Brandon preached so hard against
[1:18:11] it
[1:18:12] and you have done worse than your
[1:18:15] fathers you you have done worse
[1:18:22] worse worse and worse for behold you
[1:18:24] walk every one after the imagination of
[1:18:27] his heart is evil heart that they may
[1:18:29] not hearken unto me
[1:18:33] but let me tell you something you
[1:18:35] haven't had a battle until God fights
[1:18:37] against you
[1:18:40] when the Lord fights against you you are
[1:18:42] in trouble because guess what nobody can
[1:18:45] help you
[1:18:47] when the Lord fights against you he
[1:18:50] brings you up brings you under a Siege
[1:18:56] yes
[1:18:57] you Encompass With the Enemy and you
[1:19:00] can't get out and you can't fight back
[1:19:05] Jeremiah 19 9 says I would cause them to
[1:19:08] eat
[1:19:09] the Flesh of their sons and the Flesh of
[1:19:11] their daughters when did that happen one
[1:19:14] time it happened in Jerusalem 70 80 A.D
[1:19:18] 70 A.D right and what happened historics
[1:19:24] say is it got so bad to the blood came
[1:19:27] up with a horse is bridled
[1:19:32] so this is not something that just gonna
[1:19:35] happen again because I'm gonna tell you
[1:19:38] something if you read Jeremiah
[1:19:41] it will appear as if Jeremiah is
[1:19:44] standing in the midst of the United
[1:19:46] States
[1:19:47] right now he's describing
[1:19:51] his day but he's also describing our day
[1:19:58] Hallelujah
[1:20:02] I would cause him to eat the Flesh of
[1:20:04] their sons and the Flesh of their
[1:20:06] daughters and they shall eat everyone
[1:20:08] the Flesh of his friend in in the in
[1:20:12] what the siege
[1:20:14] and straightness where with their
[1:20:17] enemies they that seek their lives shall
[1:20:20] straighten them and that's what happened
[1:20:22] they didn't have nowhere to run Titus
[1:20:25] Army encompassed the whole Jerusalem
[1:20:27] they couldn't get out
[1:20:30] stayed there
[1:20:32] and what did they do they started
[1:20:34] devouring one another
[1:20:35] what's going to happen to his people
[1:20:39] when we know that the Demons of
[1:20:41] Euphrates have already been loosed
[1:20:44] they have worked their way from uh uh
[1:20:49] Hollywood and has infiltrated the entire
[1:20:53] world
[1:20:54] to everything is filled
[1:20:57] there's no hiding place
[1:21:00] not even on the moon
[1:21:03] because as long as man go to the moon
[1:21:06] sin is with him
[1:21:09] he'll just start all over again is that
[1:21:11] right oh it's true look what Noah did
[1:21:15] soon as it was over there was no change
[1:21:18] in his heart or mind
[1:21:19] right he was just Justified he wasn't
[1:21:23] Sanctified Justified
[1:21:26] amen
[1:21:29] and guess what as soon as he got off the
[1:21:31] boat
[1:21:32] he got drunk
[1:21:35] and then after that incest
[1:21:38] and then the beat goes on is that right
[1:21:40] look at it now now we're now back in the
[1:21:44] days of Noah
[1:21:46] men look
[1:21:49] look at you'll find it to be true
[1:21:50] violence fill the land
[1:21:55] Hallelujah even Jesus had in that day
[1:21:57] before the coming of the Lord Nation to
[1:21:59] be against Nation Brethren begins
[1:22:01] brother you know everybody's against
[1:22:04] everybody
[1:22:07] uh I I don't mean to be screaming but a
[1:22:10] serious message
[1:22:12] I wish the church would have been full
[1:22:14] but listen let me let me move on how
[1:22:16] many of y'all know
[1:22:18] we're living in a dangerous time

[1:22:23] every day you feel strange stuff you
[1:22:25] feel it it's a strangeness it ain't it's
[1:22:27] not the way it used to be it's strange
[1:22:32] oh the problem says don't think about
[1:22:35] fifth colonists hurting us
[1:22:38] don't think about Russia taking us it
[1:22:41] isn't the robin that picks on the Apple
[1:22:44] that hurts it it's a worm at the core
[1:22:47] that's what killed the Apple it isn't
[1:22:50] any other nation that we're afraid of
[1:22:53] if we have stayed where our forefathers
[1:22:56] planted the foundation we have been
[1:23:00] built upon the principle of the Bible
[1:23:02] now you haven't got any government
[1:23:05] or anything else running four terms and
[1:23:09] Breaking All the Constitution making
[1:23:12] their own laws to do what they want to
[1:23:14] do
[1:23:15] 58 19 if that ain't a prophet I don't
[1:23:19] know what is
[1:23:20] and that's exactly what they're doing
[1:23:22] breaking the Constitution to fit in and
[1:23:26] to do whatever they want to do
[1:23:28] um
[1:23:30] Hallelujah glory to God
[1:23:33] you love the Lord
[1:23:36] and in and it's nothing but honeycomb by
[1:23:40] communism the government and you know

[1:24:02] hey and you can't be a politician unless
[1:24:05] you know how to lie real good
[1:24:09] I'm not saying that some don't do good
[1:24:11] do well but listen people of God you
[1:24:13] know it's um how can I say it huh
[1:24:17] it's terrible it's rotten to the core
[1:24:19] and we're living in the day
[1:24:22] one of these old days they'll lock me up
[1:24:24] for saying this
[1:24:26] but my future has already been
[1:24:28] determined by God
[1:24:31] listen friends there isn't a thing this
[1:24:34] very hour in the next 25 minutes or 10
[1:24:37] minutes for Russia to send up its
[1:24:40] satellite and sweep over
[1:24:43] here across this nation
[1:24:46] they've been doing it
[1:24:48] train is missiles and say surrender or
[1:24:52] in two minutes you'll be nothing but
[1:24:54] dust
[1:24:56] they can do it right now
[1:24:58] think of it
[1:24:59] they can do it right now October 1958.
[1:25:03] what what would happen
[1:25:05] plain load up plane load ship load at
[1:25:10] the ship load of ungodly communist
[1:25:14] soldiers would swarm our lands would
[1:25:18] grab our girls take them into the street
[1:25:21] treat them like cattle Ram a sword
[1:25:24] through them go into our homes and take
[1:25:27] our wives out bust the baby's head
[1:25:30] against the wall ravish our women
[1:25:33] you say one thing it belongs to them let
[1:25:36] me say it like this yeah it sounds crazy
[1:25:38] what I'm reading but it's true
[1:25:42] because jehu was anointed
[1:25:46] and jehus killed and they took those
[1:25:49] babies and they broke took babies and
[1:25:52] bust their head up against the wall and
[1:25:53] everything because they rejected the
[1:25:56] truth
[1:25:59] and they thought they had gotten
[1:26:06] understand is that jehu is coming
[1:26:09] and we know Jay who is here
[1:26:12] oh yes people haven't seen nothing yet
[1:26:15] right now this is calm before the storm
[1:26:18] but it's coming
[1:26:21] oh yeah you say will our Pentecost
[1:26:24] surrender Shore in Pentagon surrendered
[1:26:27] sure it would that would be the only
[1:26:30] sensible thing to do for it to do it it
[1:26:34] would happen to do it if it didn't we'll
[1:26:38] do nothing but will excuse me we'll be
[1:26:41] nothing but powder in a few minutes
[1:26:43] we haven't made maybe a few more hours
[1:26:47] of life but what a Slaughter huh what
[1:26:52] they may be loading on the plane right
[1:26:54] now the ships may be in the harbor hello
[1:26:58] have you all heard
[1:27:00] we've had ships in our Harbor
[1:27:03] Russia and China ships
[1:27:06] and you know they don't tell you
[1:27:09] they don't want to scare you but let me
[1:27:12] tell you something
[1:27:13] you don't have to be afraid
[1:27:16] because God has a hiding place
[1:27:19] in Christ
[1:27:21] if you hide in Christ
[1:27:24] you won't have to worry about the bombs
[1:27:26] is that right because our Prophet has
[1:27:30] told us before one bomb dropped
[1:27:33] the Bride of Jesus Christ will be gone
[1:27:35] [Applause]
[1:27:41] there's not one
[1:27:45] a weapon to keep it from happening
[1:27:47] according to prophecy here we are
[1:27:50] next week you don't know what condition
[1:27:52] you could be in
[1:27:54] the handwriting is on the wall
[1:27:57] we are weighed in the balanced and found
[1:27:59] wanting now if these things are true and
[1:28:03] you see they are true
[1:28:04] you hear what he's saying if these
[1:28:07] things are true and you see that they
[1:28:08] are true then how close is the coming of
[1:28:11] the Lord tonight I want to continue what
[1:28:14] where will the church be when these uh
[1:28:17] this take place now if you now you
[1:28:21] who've always been taught that the
[1:28:23] church would take the tribulation come
[1:28:25] out come find out if this is so close if
[1:28:29] this destruction is so close how much
[1:28:32] closer is the coming of the Lord for it
[1:28:35] takes place before the church before one
[1:28:38] rocket hit this country the church will
[1:28:41] be in the arms of Christ and gone amen
[1:28:44] we're at the end it can happen anytime
[1:28:48] amen oh my God
[1:28:52] amen you love the Lord
[1:28:54] I don't mean to scream but I can't help
[1:28:57] it
[1:28:58] because I realized that that so many
[1:29:01] things are going wrong
[1:29:03] and you don't have to tell me about your
[1:29:05] battle because I'm having one myself
[1:29:14] but he said take my yoke upon you
[1:29:18] learn of me
[1:29:19] for my yoke is easy
[1:29:22] and my burden is light
[1:29:24] and all we've got to do is trust God
[1:29:27] right
[1:29:29] and trust God
[1:29:30] yes Lord I guarantee you know we're
[1:29:33] saying I'm so glad I followed those
[1:29:35] blueprints
[1:29:38] when he saw the storm that he had to
[1:29:40] encounter and I'm so glad because you
[1:29:43] know the devil was probably there saying
[1:29:45] you know what you need to just do it a
[1:29:46] little bit different than this but he
[1:29:48] had to follow it accurately
[1:29:51] see it wasn't his terms it was God's
[1:29:55] terms that's the only way you'll make it
[1:29:57] his terms
[1:29:59] listen he said just like America today
[1:30:01] with some of their rotten rotten gags
[1:30:04] and so forth that they have on
[1:30:07] television and radio and in their modern
[1:30:09] you you you people that call yourself
[1:30:12] Christians listening to such stuff now
[1:30:15] you can see where we're standing you
[1:30:18] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian you good
[1:30:21] Pentecostals something's happened to you
[1:30:23] you desire your desire got wrong for
[1:30:27] what's in your heart you'll do
[1:30:32] it wouldn't be no great surprise to me
[1:30:34] to see a pig on a manure pile feeding
[1:30:37] that's his nature but it would sure
[1:30:40] surprise me I've never did see it I
[1:30:43] never will see a lamb eating with him
[1:30:45] because of nature in him is different
[1:30:49] you don't see Christians doing those
[1:30:52] things their nature the nature of the
[1:30:55] great Holy Ghost won't let them do these
[1:30:58] things
[1:31:00] hello I'm gonna read that again the
[1:31:03] nature of the great Holy Ghost will let
[1:31:06] them do these things the Bible says if
[1:31:09] you love the world and the things of the
[1:31:10] world the love of God is not even in you
[1:31:13] now you can judge yourself or the word
[1:31:17] judge you if you love those things the
[1:31:21] love of God is gone from you
[1:31:24] God
[1:31:25] has first place a no place
[1:31:31] they'll owe somebody
[1:31:33] God has first place or no place blessed
[1:31:39] be his name I'm so glad of that I'm so
[1:31:42] glad that he's pure and holy we can put
[1:31:46] confidence in him
[1:31:48] he he he he
[1:31:50] compromises with nothing he is God and
[1:31:54] he's God Alone amen it's not going to
[1:31:57] come down to us we've got to measure up
[1:32:00] to him he ain't going to come to our
[1:32:03] thoughts we're God to measure his to his
[1:32:06] thoughts he ain't going to listen to our
[1:32:09] Commandments we're going to listen to
[1:32:11] his Commandments but of course we can do
[1:32:14] just what we want to
[1:32:16] and I say this with respect
[1:32:19] ninety percent of the pastors they got
[1:32:21] so weak they won't preach against it
[1:32:24] it's a meal ticket to them I'd rather
[1:32:27] have starve and wear grass sacks to
[1:32:30] cover my nakedness and preach the gospel
[1:32:34] the truth then to have uh to have fried
[1:32:38] fried chicken three times a day and
[1:32:41] compromise with the devil's trash
[1:32:42] getting to be an old man and I stood for
[1:32:47] it when I was young man I want to stand
[1:32:50] more Gallant now for I see the hours at
[1:32:53] hand what do you think the prophet of
[1:32:56] Old Testament would do if they Rose
[1:32:58] today
[1:32:59] look at conditions
[1:33:01] I don't mean to be reading all of this
[1:33:03] but it just
[1:33:05] you know we have how could I say it like
[1:33:09] we have become
[1:33:11] desensitized
[1:33:15] because things don't matter anymore
[1:33:19] there's a time you know we saw disorder
[1:33:22] we saw somebody walking in a way we
[1:33:24] would immediately pray
[1:33:27] it's different now
[1:33:30] handwriting on the wall
[1:33:32] brother Brown said when you dress like a
[1:33:34] prostitute you'll act like one that's
[1:33:37] right oh you have to do you have a lot
[1:33:40] to do what kind of a spirit is in you
[1:33:42] certainly it makes you act what's in you
[1:33:47] it makes you dress and act and live
[1:33:52] whatever is in you it governs you
[1:33:57] hello
[1:33:58] now get away from that one
[1:34:02] love or hatred
[1:34:05] is your leader
[1:34:08] if you're a sinner raise up your eyes
[1:34:10] and look now
[1:34:12] if you've been in indifferent if you had
[1:34:15] little squabbles and little things what
[1:34:18] difference does it make you're going to
[1:34:20] die one of these days what day maybe
[1:34:22] today you don't know an hour from now
[1:34:26] you may be in Hell or you may be in
[1:34:28] heaven but you've got to choose now if
[1:34:32] there's anything in your life that isn't
[1:34:34] right you choose Now by faith you say
[1:34:38] well if I can just even uh get even with
[1:34:42] her if I can uh get even with him no
[1:34:46] matter what they've done choose life
[1:34:49] choose life Jesus said if from your
[1:34:53] heart you don't forgive every person
[1:34:55] their transgression neither does your
[1:34:57] heavenly father forgive you so just get
[1:35:01] that close if there's one art in your
[1:35:04] heart against any person sinner or Saint
[1:35:06] you in danger of Hell Fire
[1:35:11] by faith Moses
[1:35:14] y'all got quiet
[1:35:17] see when truth comes the only thing you
[1:35:19] can do is repent
[1:35:21] God help me
[1:35:23] Jesus help me because I'm gonna tell you
[1:35:27] something we say I forgive but let me
[1:35:29] tell you something
[1:35:31] it doesn't come easy
[1:35:34] you can say it with your mouth but your
[1:35:36] heart
[1:35:37] is where it's lodged
[1:35:40] it takes God to remove it from the heart
[1:35:44] but he'll never remove it until you see
[1:35:47] your desire your earnest desire is for
[1:35:50] it to be removed amen ah
[1:35:56] I'm almost done
[1:35:58] you're okay with that
[1:36:00] see we have had examples to go through
[1:36:04] we we shouldn't have to be con uh act
[1:36:07] like we don't know what's going to
[1:36:09] happen to us if we don't obey God we've
[1:36:12] had examples throughout the Bible
[1:36:16] see you've had examples back there to
[1:36:18] what God did to your fathers when he got
[1:36:21] here the high-minded and let his kingdom
[1:36:25] go like that you got an example of what
[1:36:27] he did
[1:36:29] and so
[1:36:30] have you got an example of what God did
[1:36:33] to those who did walk up right didn't
[1:36:35] walk up right before him
[1:36:37] these are not mystery thing mysterious
[1:36:40] things
[1:36:41] this is not a hard message it's the
[1:36:44] truth
[1:36:45] you've got an example you know what he
[1:36:48] did back Yonder to the women who danced
[1:36:50] before the idols you know what he did to
[1:36:53] the men who went at the strange women
[1:36:55] you know what he'd done to the drunken
[1:36:58] socks and the homosexuals and the
[1:37:01] perverse of Sodom it's no strange thing
[1:37:04] you know these things
[1:37:07] said you should have known it there you
[1:37:10] there's your example by your grandfather
[1:37:13] but now this is the meaning of the
[1:37:16] writing God has numbered your kingdom
[1:37:19] you are weighed in the balance and found
[1:37:22] wanting oh if there's ever was a time
[1:37:25] that Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[1:37:27] Lutheran Pentecostals they are weighed
[1:37:30] in the balance God's balance found
[1:37:33] wanting they call the spirit of the
[1:37:35] Living God and the Unholy thing they
[1:37:38] have done despite to the work of Grace
[1:37:40] they have followed big churches and
[1:37:42] organizations you Assemblies of God you
[1:37:45] Church of God all you you Oneness and
[1:37:48] trinitarians baptism Presbyterian
[1:37:50] Catholics you know you've gone back to
[1:37:53] Babylon you had an example of that and
[1:37:56] this Branham Tabernacle knows that
[1:37:59] you've been warned of these things years
[1:38:02] ago but now you're weighed in the
[1:38:04] balance and found wanting fuss and
[1:38:08] fighting and holding grudges and stewing
[1:38:10] you think God could work in a place like
[1:38:14] that never there you are indifference
[1:38:18] Unholy without natural affection truce
[1:38:21] Baker false accusers that's the day that
[1:38:25] we're living in
[1:38:26] huh what
[1:38:28] he didn't even leave Branham Tabernacle
[1:38:31] out
[1:38:32] and That Was Then do you can you imagine
[1:38:35] what it is like now
[1:38:37] because whenever the man of God leaves
[1:38:39] it gets worse
[1:38:47] it gets worse
[1:38:50] I'm not gonna read all of this but I'm
[1:38:53] I'm gonna quote it to you a little bit
[1:38:55] Rome or Jeremiah 18 1-12
[1:39:00] says take me to The Potter's House
[1:39:04] there I will cause thee to hear my words
[1:39:07] and then I went down to The Potter's
[1:39:09] House and behold
[1:39:11] he wrought a work on the wheels and
[1:39:14] that's what God is doing right now
[1:39:16] at The Potter's House he's he's got got
[1:39:19] us on the Wheel
[1:39:21] you know when you when he puts you on
[1:39:22] the wheel he's already softened you up
[1:39:24] and you know he's got you going around
[1:39:26] it might you might like I'm so tired of
[1:39:28] going around in these circles but God is
[1:39:30] putting the pressure
[1:39:32] that's just the beginning of the real
[1:39:34] battle
[1:39:35] you know it seemed like I can't take it
[1:39:37] no more but you wait till he take you
[1:39:38] off of The Potter's will
[1:39:40] and then you got to go through the fire
[1:39:42] [Laughter]
[1:39:45] to realize that the pressure the head
[1:39:47] the fivefold ministry wasn't so hard on
[1:39:49] you after a while but when you go
[1:39:51] through the purifying fire
[1:39:53] where God got to take you through that
[1:39:56] fire to make sure that everything is
[1:39:58] pure if it's not pure the fire we're
[1:40:00] gonna it's going to break you
[1:40:02] it will destroy you
[1:40:05] you know and so he said the vessel that
[1:40:07] made he made of clay was marred in the
[1:40:10] hands of the Potter so he made it again
[1:40:13] another vessel as seen good to the
[1:40:16] Potter to make it and that's the thing
[1:40:18] there's nothing wrong with saying Lord
[1:40:20] Make Me Over again if you come to a
[1:40:23] place and you marred you find yourself
[1:40:25] not the kind of Christian that you want
[1:40:27] to be
[1:40:29] whatever I got to go through
[1:40:32] what's ever necessary
[1:40:36] for me to please the Potter
[1:40:39] so let it be
[1:40:41] old house of Israel cannot I do with you
[1:40:44] as a Potter said the Lord behold as the
[1:40:47] clay is in The Potter's hand so are ye
[1:40:50] in mine or House of Israel
[1:40:53] at what instant I shall speak concerning
[1:40:56] a nation and concerning a kingdom to
[1:40:59] pluck up and to pull down and destroy it
[1:41:02] what are you talking about he's saying
[1:41:04] I'm God I'm your maker I can do what you
[1:41:07] what I want to do
[1:41:09] and who's going to stop me
[1:41:12] but he's showing Israel listen I'm
[1:41:14] giving you a second chance
[1:41:16] you were marred so let's make this part
[1:41:19] all over again
[1:41:22] and at what instance will I shall speak
[1:41:25] concerning a nation and concerning a
[1:41:27] kingdom to build and to replant it you
[1:41:30] see that to read to build and to plant
[1:41:33] excuse me
[1:41:34] or if
[1:41:36] if it to do evil in my sight that it
[1:41:39] obey not my voice then I will repent of
[1:41:42] the good wherewith I said I would
[1:41:45] benefit them and see that's what people
[1:41:47] oh but we under grace we under grace
[1:41:50] well I know one thing God has never
[1:41:52] changed his mind about his word
[1:41:56] and whether you realize or not from the
[1:41:59] Old Testament to the new the only way
[1:42:01] the people made it was by grace
[1:42:04] true they may have been under law but it
[1:42:07] was Grace that carried them over
[1:42:12] I'm almost done
[1:42:15] my thoughts is not to criticize people
[1:42:21] but I'm going to tell you something you
[1:42:23] can't trust in your flesh
[1:42:25] your flesh will betray you every time
[1:42:30] you think you're a strong man
[1:42:33] you let a lion get out there if you
[1:42:36] don't run you're gonna faint
[1:42:42] your flesh you might in your mind want
[1:42:45] to run
[1:42:46] with your flesh can't move
[1:42:49] it's terrified
[1:42:54] hmm
[1:42:55] it's true you know we love each other
[1:42:58] right
[1:42:59] but we love each other to a degree
[1:43:02] because we know that we're still flesh
[1:43:05] if you say oh I know that brother oh
[1:43:07] that brother will never do you don't
[1:43:09] know that
[1:43:12] we just hope that that brother won't or
[1:43:14] that sister won't
[1:43:15] with flash
[1:43:18] but we must have an understanding of
[1:43:20] Truth amen amen if your brother do wrong
[1:43:23] or your sister do wrong no it's the
[1:43:25] devil and not your brother or your
[1:43:27] sister it is what it is we don't wrestle
[1:43:30] against flesh and blood but spiritual
[1:43:33] wickedness in high places that's our
[1:43:35] enemy not the man not the woman it's
[1:43:39] Satan amen
[1:43:44] blessed is the man the seventh verse
[1:43:47] let me read the fifth verse thus said
[1:43:49] the Lord curse should be the man that
[1:43:51] trusted trust is in man and make flesh
[1:43:54] is on and whose heart departed uh from
[1:43:57] the Lord
[1:44:00] for he shall be like the heath of in the
[1:44:02] desert and shall not see when good
[1:44:05] cometh but shall inherit the parts
[1:44:07] places in the wilderness in a salt land
[1:44:11] and not
[1:44:12] not inhabitable blessed is the man that
[1:44:15] trusteth in the Lord whose hope the Lord
[1:44:19] is
[1:44:22] for he shall be as a tree planted By the
[1:44:25] Waters and that spreaded out her Roots
[1:44:28] by the river and shall not see when he's
[1:44:30] coming but her least shall be green and
[1:44:33] shall not be careful in the years of
[1:44:36] drought neither shall cease from
[1:44:39] yielding fruit
[1:44:42] the heart is deceitful above all things
[1:44:46] and desperately wicked
[1:44:48] who can know it
[1:44:50] I the Lord searched a heart
[1:44:53] I try the Reigns even to give every man
[1:44:56] according to his ways
[1:44:58] and according to the fruit of his doings
[1:45:02] it is God who knows you better than you
[1:45:05] know yourself
[1:45:06] Try Me O Lord that's right if you find
[1:45:09] any wicked thing in me deliver me that
[1:45:12] that should be our prayer
[1:45:16] the Bible said when you think you stand
[1:45:18] take Eve
[1:45:21] take e
[1:45:24] one thing for certain there's only one
[1:45:27] place of refuge and that's in the Lord
[1:45:30] and I'm going to close with that
[1:45:32] statement
[1:45:33] I just want one scripture then Jeremiah
[1:45:36] 17 13 14 says O Lord the hope of Israel
[1:45:40] all the all that forsake thee shall be
[1:45:43] ashamed and they that depart from me
[1:45:47] shall be written in the Earth because
[1:45:49] they have forsaken the Lord the Fountain
[1:45:52] of Living Waters
[1:45:54] Heal Me O Lord and I shall be healed
[1:45:59] save me
[1:46:01] and I shall be saved
[1:46:03] for thou art
[1:46:05] my praise
[1:46:09] so at the end of the day
[1:46:12] you got to choose life or death
[1:46:17] and life comes in truth
[1:46:19] and death comes in lies
[1:46:23] and you got to choose truth
[1:46:27] you got to follow the lord Jesus Christ
[1:46:29] he says I am the way the truth and the
[1:46:32] life
[1:46:34] that's who he is
[1:46:36] and I don't care what the world is
[1:46:39] saying oh you could be saved any kind of
[1:46:41] way you can be a save and Muslim you can
[1:46:44] be a saved all that kind of crazy stuff
[1:46:47] Jesus said I'm the only way
[1:46:49] and that is what I believe and know to
[1:46:51] be truth
[1:46:53] you love the Lord people of God all I'm
[1:46:56] trying to say is that we all stand in a
[1:47:01] place where we need God to give us
[1:47:04] desperation
[1:47:11] we are living in the worst age ever
[1:47:16] and how can you be desperate when
[1:47:18] everything is at your fingertip
[1:47:21] we got an easy life
[1:47:27] but that's the thing that's killing us
[1:47:30] that's the thing that makes us lazy
[1:47:32] that's the thing that that hinders the
[1:47:35] desperation
[1:47:37] we need Jesus
[1:47:39] how many of y'all want to make a rapture
[1:47:42] oh I know in my heart I I don't live for
[1:47:45] nothing else that's all I want
[1:47:48] that's not because I'm afraid to go to
[1:47:50] hell
[1:47:52] it ain't going to do no good to be
[1:47:54] afraid to go to hell if you go in there
[1:47:57] you understand what I'm saying
[1:48:00] at least the world of people out there
[1:48:02] accept themselves and they accept that
[1:48:04] they're going to go to hell and they
[1:48:05] think that when they get there they're
[1:48:06] going to party they'll be jumping around
[1:48:08] but they won't be because of music
[1:48:12] the prophet of God said is the worst
[1:48:14] thing he's at your worst nightmare
[1:48:17] cannot even compare what hell is like
[1:48:20] he said just like you can't Envision
[1:48:22] what heaven is like even at the most
[1:48:25] Sublime thing in your mind he says far
[1:48:28] beyond that
[1:48:29] and hell is just the opposite
[1:48:33] and people are being tormented they
[1:48:34] think when I'm dead die I'm dead I'm
[1:48:37] done that's such a lie
[1:48:40] hey
[1:48:41] it's not true
[1:48:43] you have Consciousness and everything
[1:48:45] else when you go there
[1:48:46] that that Rich Young Ruler said Lord
[1:48:50] have Lazarus go and stick his hand a
[1:48:53] finger in in some water and just just
[1:48:55] place it on my tongue that wasn't no
[1:48:58] story that was truth that was history
[1:49:05] yeah he's still there
[1:49:07] still thirsting and remember oh he knew
[1:49:11] he was called to preach
[1:49:13] because he goes on to say tell go let me
[1:49:16] let me raise on the dead and go tell my
[1:49:18] brother and Jesus says no even if you
[1:49:20] raise from the dead they won't remember
[1:49:21] they won't believe you
[1:49:23] see what was he saying I will raise from
[1:49:25] the dead I'm coming from there they
[1:49:28] still won't believe why ain't nothing in
[1:49:30] there to believe
[1:49:33] may God help us Jesus help me y'all pray
[1:49:36] for me and I pray for you
[1:49:40] let's stand
[1:49:46] Lord
