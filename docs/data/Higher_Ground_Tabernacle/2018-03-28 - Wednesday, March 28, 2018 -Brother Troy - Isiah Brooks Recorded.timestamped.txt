[32:45] certain attributes amen and he has
[32:48] placed those attributes in a book called
[32:50] life amen and and your name there is the
[32:53] description of what the attribute is and
[32:57] what that attribute will look like upon
[32:59] the earth and then once that attribute
[33:01] comes upon this earth and is filled with
[33:04] the Holy Spirit life of God with the
[33:07] token with the token all the heaven is
[33:09] behind it
[33:10] amen to fulfill what was written upon
[33:13] that attribute amen so when the DNA of
[33:16] God is placed down on the inside of you
[33:18] that DNA begins to express itself amen
[33:22] and Express what God had in his mind but
[33:24] from before the foundation of the world
[33:25] and when it starts to express itself in
[33:28] your life that things begin to happen
[33:30] that you can't quite explain
[33:33] amen things start happening in your life
[33:36] that maybe you go do this you go do that
[33:38] you don't know why you go do this or go
[33:40] do that you don't know why you have
[33:41] desires to go this way or to do that way
[33:44] but there's something growing up on the
[33:46] inside of you this pushing you this way
[33:49] and pushing you that way and you're led
[33:51] to do this and led to do that yeah you
[33:54] don't even know why but there is a life
[33:55] down on the inside there's speaking out
[33:58] on behalf of joven
[34:00] amen the speaking on behalf of the
[34:02] creator of heavens earth that that life
[34:05] on the inside speaking on behalf of God
[34:07] speaking on the inside of you go this
[34:10] way go that way what is this try and do
[34:12] it it's expressing the life of God down
[34:15] on the inside of you there was
[34:16] given a portion of it to you from before
[34:19] the foundation of the world
[34:20] Amen your own portion of God portion of
[34:23] God down on the inside of you that was
[34:26] given to you your part here to Express
[34:28] no man can express that for you you must
[34:32] express it yourself amen
[34:34] you know we spoke here a long time ago
[34:37] about the author you know any any man
[34:41] when he writes a book first yes to have
[34:45] an idea of what that book is going to be
[34:46] about amen and yes he he gets a title
[34:51] for his book he and that title is
[34:53] supposed to encompass kind of give a
[34:55] brief description of what that book has
[34:58] on the inside something that'll grab the
[35:00] people to make them open the book up cuz
[35:03] no book you know the glory of a book is
[35:05] when a book is revealed you know when a
[35:07] book is just sitting up on the shelf
[35:09] there's really no glory to it but but
[35:11] once the book is opened then the glory
[35:14] of that book is revealed
[35:16] amen and so an author when he has a book
[35:19] he has something in his mind that he
[35:21] wants to get out of his mind so the
[35:23] people can open the book and see the
[35:25] glory of what's on the inside of his
[35:27] mind amen so when he sees the story he
[35:30] he writes it out he gets it out chapter
[35:33] by chapter by chapter he decides what
[35:35] the beginning of the book is going to be
[35:37] he decides what the end of the book is
[35:39] gonna be he knows what the middle of the
[35:41] book is gonna be and he writes it out
[35:42] and then he starts expounding upon each
[35:45] little portion of the book and he breaks
[35:47] it out and why Eaton's it out widens it
[35:50] out so that each little portion of the
[35:52] story will be revealed revealed revealed
[35:55] and the glory of the book is as widened
[35:58] out widened out winding down and tell
[35:59] it's a the book grows wider and wider
[36:01] and tell every single attribute of what
[36:04] God had in his mind from before the
[36:06] foundation of the world is expressed on
[36:08] the inside of this book Amen so and when
[36:11] the author goes he fishes the book and
[36:13] he and he goes and sends it to the
[36:15] author and the authors to the publisher
[36:17] publisher says Oh what do you want the
[36:19] title this book and he says this is the
[36:21] title of the book and the whole thing is
[36:24] sealed it's finished it's complete and
[36:26] it's just waiting for someone to
[36:27] discover the glory that is on the inside
[36:30] amen and so when someone goes up and
[36:33] down the bookshelves of the library or
[36:35] or of your own private den you know
[36:37] where they look so what's that book
[36:39] about and you say well I've read that
[36:41] book cover-to-cover and you can begin to
[36:43] expound upon the glory of that book why
[36:45] because you've experienced it there's
[36:47] been a time where you went up to that
[36:49] bookshelf and you took that book off the
[36:51] shelf and you opened it up and you
[36:53] started reading it and you got fully
[36:55] aware of all the details on the inside
[36:57] of that book and you and that you became
[36:59] one with the glory of that book amen and
[37:02] what's you and when you really find a
[37:04] book that you love and enjoy amen and
[37:07] you when you when someone says oh if you
[37:09] ever read this book you can start going
[37:11] on and on about all the little bits this
[37:14] is my favorite part here this is my
[37:16] favorite and you can begin to take the
[37:19] glory and share in the glory of the
[37:21] author by expressing to someone else
[37:24] what is on the inside of that book a man
[37:27] so God had a book he wanted to write
[37:30] down because God had certain attributes
[37:32] down on the inside of him amen and he
[37:35] wanted these attributes to be expressed
[37:37] so before the foundation of the world he
[37:39] took these attributes and he put them in
[37:41] a book a man when he when he thought
[37:44] down in his mind what am I gonna call
[37:46] this book what title am I gonna put on
[37:50] this book and he and he decided to put
[37:52] the title this book the Lamb's Book of
[37:55] Life amen
[37:57] this is the book of the life of the Lamb
[37:59] amen and and God you know God he if
[38:02] anybody's gonna know what life is
[38:05] it's God if anybody is well qualified to
[38:09] write about life it's God himself you
[38:13] know there's a lot of people that might
[38:14] be able to say oh this is the life or
[38:16] they can go and travel over here and I'm
[38:18] gonna go enjoy this over here it's high
[38:21] society and all these other things that
[38:23] they think oh this is the life but in
[38:25] reality what they have doesn't even mean
[38:27] this compared to what God it knows what
[38:30] like this amen and anybody has had any
[38:35] experience with the Holy Spirit of the
[38:37] Living God can begin to have a little
[38:41] bit of testimony of what is on
[38:44] inside of this book but anybody that has
[38:47] not had any experience with the Holy
[38:49] Spirit of the Living God does not know
[38:51] the least basis of what this book is all
[38:54] about
[38:55] amen but this book has God decided to
[38:59] describe his own life in a book amen and
[39:02] when he went in you know any man we
[39:04] write opens up a book you can read all
[39:06] this flowery language and and ups and
[39:09] downs and emotions and everything you
[39:11] know and and how it reaches out and
[39:13] grabs you with the words but but when
[39:15] you open up this book called life and
[39:17] you go and you read in it and the only
[39:20] thing that's in there's names there's no
[39:24] high language or there's no it's just
[39:26] just writing names
[39:28] I mean you think well what is this you
[39:30] know it's not you know what what what is
[39:33] this book Lord that you're you're
[39:35] describing here Lord huh you know I
[39:37] thought I thought I was going to open
[39:38] this book and read about God's life but
[39:40] but when I open up this book all I see
[39:42] his name's written in it I think it's
[39:47] time to discover some of the glory of
[39:49] this book so he sure you discover some
[39:52] of the glory of this book tonight so in
[39:54] so an atom began to discover the glory
[39:57] of the inside of the life of Christ as
[39:59] he walks up out on this new creation of
[40:02] the earth you know and he and he walks
[40:03] out and he begins to experience the life
[40:06] of God down on the inside and he he's
[40:09] being to notice that he can if God
[40:12] has God says I have created this garden
[40:14] for you to live in amen and I want you
[40:17] to live here I want you to be at peace
[40:18] in here with me I want you to commune
[40:20] I'm gonna come by and I'm gonna visit
[40:22] you a day after day after day and this
[40:25] is he's beginning to begin to understand
[40:27] all this attribute that God has given me
[40:30] to express his life it comes with no I'm
[40:33] not just gonna express the life of God
[40:35] alone but I am partnering with God here
[40:39] on the earth
[40:39] amen God is gonna come in a visit with
[40:42] me I'm gonna sit here and goddess had
[40:44] this creation in his mind but he's
[40:47] placed me here to be the mediator
[40:49] between God and heaven and the earth
[40:51] down here below and current and Adam
[40:54] there was the mediator between God and
[40:56] the animals between God and the trees
[40:58] he is sitting here on the earth with the
[41:00] authority of Christ and he was beginning
[41:03] to be in partnership with God amen and
[41:06] God would come down to his son and
[41:08] commune with him day after day and what
[41:11] was Adam was experiencing the glory of
[41:14] the book of life amen and as Adam could
[41:18] experience the life of the earth they
[41:20] began to see you know if you go to the
[41:22] other most depths of the earth of the
[41:24] waters there's life if you if you dig a
[41:27] hole in the earth ground there's
[41:29] microbes there's things living there if
[41:31] you go to the forest there's there
[41:33] there's tall trees if you look at the
[41:35] dirt there's a little tiny bugs yeah and
[41:37] then it's just the whole earth you go
[41:38] out to the desert and it looks lifeless
[41:41] but then you see little things squirming
[41:43] here and there there's life everywhere
[41:45] you go all over the earth
[41:47] how is it that this that this planet has
[41:52] so much life covering it and all these
[41:55] other planets they go and then they're
[41:56] looking for the least a little bit of
[41:58] microbial life and cannot even find it
[42:01] but God has decided to express his life
[42:04] on this earth amen and all these things
[42:07] that we see that of how much life is on
[42:10] this earth is just a shadow and a type
[42:12] of what is supposed to be the expression
[42:15] down on our souls
[42:16] amen of the life that God has said and
[42:19] what it life that I will put down on the
[42:21] inside of your soul is greater than what
[42:24] is living on the Amazon jungle a man is
[42:27] greater than what the we go out and see
[42:29] the forests out here a man is greater
[42:31] than you know like they say that the the
[42:34] know the the Mahon's and the Incas tried
[42:38] to build these great cities out here in
[42:40] the jungles and they they spent decades
[42:42] clearing the jungles and building these
[42:44] great towers and now they can't even
[42:45] find him
[42:46] because life took over amen and the
[42:49] roots grew out and every little crevice
[42:51] and it broke up the rocks and and
[42:54] everything caved in on itself because
[42:55] the roots would expand out and push the
[42:58] blocks out of the way and and life is
[43:00] God's life he's gonna take this place
[43:02] over all their foreign gods that they
[43:05] ascribe the stone and gods like just
[43:07] comes in and just ruins the whole thing
[43:09] amen
[43:11] amen but good that's just a small
[43:13] testimony compared to what is down on
[43:15] the inside of us the life of God down on
[43:18] the inside of the human soul is a
[43:21] greater expression than anything you
[43:23] could find any little tropical island
[43:25] anywhere on the earth amen because
[43:28] wherever God is there's life amen
[43:32] I mean even when even like Jesus he
[43:35] never attended a funeral service the one
[43:37] time he is walking by and they saw come
[43:40] out of the gates of the city the the
[43:42] pallbearers carrying the casket he
[43:43] walked by and the man jumped off out of
[43:45] the casket and was raised from the dead
[43:48] why because life was walking by amen
[43:51] there was a man that was behind the
[43:52] behind the behind a stone you and he
[43:55] said rolls the stone away and Lazarus
[43:57] come out why because life called out
[43:59] unto Lazarus a man that same life is
[44:03] down on the inside you know my death
[44:06] where is your sting grave where is your
[44:08] victory
[44:09] but thanks being to God who has given me
[44:11] the life why because he rode down before
[44:14] the foundation of the world amen the
[44:17] author he knew what life was all about
[44:19] so when he decided that I'm going to
[44:22] describe my life on the earth I'm not
[44:24] gonna rest on just the Amazon jungle to
[44:26] testify in my life I'm not going to let
[44:29] the the whales in the ocean and the
[44:32] plankton to describe my life I'm not
[44:34] going to allow my life to the
[44:36] description of my life just deceased
[44:38] with with with the little things that
[44:40] are crawling around in the desert no but
[44:43] I'm going to place my the story of my
[44:45] life in a book and there's an attribute
[44:47] called the Lamb's Book of Life with
[44:49] attributes and any of those names
[44:50] written and you know these names are
[44:53] with written that when they are
[44:55] expressed when those names come up on
[44:57] this earth they're gonna express my life
[45:00] anyway he made the st. the thing so sure
[45:03] that he said that even if these names
[45:06] ever fall short of the glory of God if
[45:08] any of these names come short of the
[45:11] glory of God I'm going to slay a lamb
[45:13] for these names amen so that this thing
[45:16] cannot fail
[45:19] amen amen
[45:22] Psalms 139 is
[45:24] said how precious also are thy thoughts
[45:28] unto me O God how great is the sum of
[45:32] them if I should count them they're more
[45:34] in number than the sand when I awake I
[45:37] am still with thee amen how many times
[45:40] did David fall asleep but yet when I
[45:43] awaken my God is there
[45:44] amen he said how great are the some of
[45:48] your thoughts towards me
[45:49] amen going hey God how can God express
[45:53] it he found the the biggest thing he
[45:56] finally can just express he he's like
[45:58] I'm just gonna write their name down and
[46:02] then try to ride it out in the English
[46:04] language he didn't try to write it out
[46:06] in the Babylonian language or in the
[46:08] Hebrew language he just wrote out in his
[46:10] own language and his language was to
[46:12] write our names Amen these names will
[46:14] describe my life on the earth amen
[46:20] this is where we stand sings this is
[46:23] where we're at this is a you know you
[46:26] know in in the battlefield of our mind
[46:28] we can get so far away from losing our
[46:31] memory spiritual amnesia getting away
[46:34] from where we stand but we are standing
[46:36] here to fulfill the Living Word of God
[46:38] amen your land your name was written
[46:41] upon the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[46:43] foundation of the world and there was a
[46:45] lamb slain before the foundation of the
[46:46] world there just in case you ever fall
[46:49] short of the glory of God and the glory
[46:51] of God is expressed through these names
[46:54] written on this book amen so if anybody
[46:57] does fall short of the glory or was it
[46:59] the blood that makes the way back amen
[47:01] for you to keep on expressing the glory
[47:04] of God amen next attributes of his life
[47:08] amen so we can stand there with with you

[47:21] anointed me to preach the good tidings
[47:22] to the meek he has sent me to bind up
[47:25] the brokenhearted he has sent me to
[47:27] proclaim Liberty to the captives he has
[47:29] anointed me - oh the open the prison to
[47:32] them that are bound well how can he do
[47:33] that why because the Holy Spirit was in

[48:34] name of the Living God may I read this
[48:37] quote of brother branham's from the
[48:40] message identification
[48:42] he said says their only things he was
[48:47] was the eternal and in him was
[48:50] attributes and those attributes were
[48:53] thoughts and those thoughts was
[48:56] expressed to words and the Word was made
[49:00] manifest what is it it's all God
[49:03] becoming tangible and you are a part of
[49:06] God amen it's all God becoming tangible
[49:10] being bit he could be handled he can be
[49:12] felt he can be touched well it is God

[49:21] to redeem those that was put on the
[49:23] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[49:25] foundation of the world it was in God's
[49:27] thoughts and that's what he came to
[49:29] redeem and then now watch this that's
[49:33] you hate me that's us
[49:35] well why how do we know where is it was
[49:38] us because of the revelation what when
[49:41] God opened her eyes to his word when God
[49:44] when God revealed his words to us our
[49:47] eyes were opened our blindness was
[49:49] removed

[49:51] our faith rose up and said yes and amen
[49:54] to that
[49:55] hey man when your faith rose up and said
[49:57] yes the name into that we said we
[49:59] followed in step with the Word of God a
[50:01] man and that word is the same thing that
[50:04] created the heavens that we stand earth
[50:06] that we stand on amen
[50:08] and it was in God's thoughts that's what
[50:11] he come to redeem and then as soon as it

[50:16] life is in there a man as soon as that
[50:19] life strikes them they see it because
[50:22] the life was in there and that is how we
[50:24] got here amen
[50:26] that's how we came to be see where we
[50:28] are right now why because our eyes were
[50:31] open to this word we said yes and amen
[50:33] I see that I see it I see it I believe
[50:36] it I accept it a man and here we stand
[50:39] today a man part of the Word of God amen
[50:43] amen
[50:45] oh how great is the sum of his thoughts
[50:47] towards us Amen it has even been fully
[50:50] expressed yet what the Holy Spirit has
[50:53] in store for us to fulfill a meant but
[50:56] we know it's gonna be great because what
[50:57] is it it's his thoughts down on the
[50:59] inside and it's gonna express from glory
[51:02] to glory to glory you say oh I've been a
[51:04] Christian for twenty thirty years I've
[51:07] done all that I can do you know but God
[51:09] still has another step for you
[51:11] amen God still has another revealing for
[51:15] you why because his glory is eternal
[51:17] amen the glory of God is eternal at
[51:20] which that glory is our down on the
[51:22] inside of you

[51:27] you a man so when you take the book off
[51:29] the shelf you want to explain to someone
[51:31] B can never really fully explain the
[51:34] book to someone they just have to read
[51:36] it for themselves amen but when you and
[51:39] you know sometimes when you read a book
[51:40] you read it over again the second time
[51:42] third time you begin catching things oh
[51:44] I didn't see that there before anyway
[51:46] it's the same thing as there are things
[51:47] to be revealed on the inside of us that
[51:50] we have not even seen you Amen what the
[51:54] depth is untold amen I have not seen
[51:57] ears not heard the glory they will be
[51:59] revealed in us amen amen
[52:05] oh my to point unto them that mourn in
[52:09] Zion to give unto them beauty for Ashes
[52:11] the oil of joy from oil of joy for
[52:13] mourning the garment of praise for the
[52:16] spirit of heaviness that they might be
[52:18] called the trees of righteousness the
[52:21] planting of the Lord that he might be
[52:23] glorified how will he be glorified by
[52:26] his life in us not just by him being
[52:30] kind of identified with us by our words
[52:32] not just by with us you know just kind
[52:34] of being you know just just sympathizing
[52:38] with the gospel
[52:39] no but vote by us taking the full dive
[52:42] into the holy spirit of living God being
[52:44] immersed baptism being immersed in the
[52:48] Holy Ghost amen he didn't say you would
[52:51] be sprinkled with the Holy Ghost he
[52:52] didn't say that you would be given a
[52:54] little speck of the Holy Ghost he when
[52:57] he when he decided to scribe the Holy
[52:58] Ghost he said consuming fire he said
[53:02] you'll be filled with the Holy Ghost he
[53:04] said you'd be baptized into the Holy
[53:07] Ghost full immersion a man these are the
[53:10] descriptions of what he said but the
[53:12] Holy Ghost would take over in our lives
[53:14] amen full immersion baptism amen when
[53:18] you go down to the waters of baptism you
[53:19] come up completely wet so saturate it
[53:23] die down every the head-to-toe
[53:25] saturating the Holy Ghost and these are
[53:28] the descriptions of the Holy Ghost with
[53:30] us amen if we fall short of that glory
[53:32] then there's an altar here for you to
[53:35] come so that you won't fall short of the
[53:36] glory of God amen why because the blood
[53:40] was slain that if any of us would fall
[53:42] short of the glory of God that we could
[53:45] raise back up to it
[53:46] hey man don't don't think they'll take
[53:48] that role as 23:23 lightly that that we
[53:52] are supposed to attain under the glory
[53:54] of God amen God's glory sometimes we
[53:56] look at that Scripture we think it's
[53:57] only this tall wits
[53:59] you know the glory of God to be revealed
[54:03] in us a man is there an end to that
[54:07] no it's eternal God's glory is unrivaled
[54:11] unveiled and available and available if
[54:13] you just stop here then you're falling
[54:18] short of the glory of God
[54:19] because God's glory doesn't stop here
[54:22] God's glory keeps going going going
[54:24] going going on on on on so when you stop
[54:27] you're falling short of the glory that
[54:29] is expansive it's eternal amen amen amen
[54:39] so if you find yourself brokenhearted
[54:42] amen if you find yourself captive hey if
[54:46] you find yourself in prison if you find
[54:48] yourself bound and then the Holy Spirit
[54:50] anointing is here to set you free from
[54:53] those things so you can fully Express so
[54:57] you can fully Express the glory of God
[55:00] that God prophesied himself when he
[55:03] wrote your name upon the book of life
[55:04] these are the names that will express my
[55:07] life that was the prophecy of God and
[55:10] God's prophecies I'll always come to
[55:11] pass amen that's the is what the author
[55:14] said amen and how great is the sum of
[55:18] his thoughts the sum the total how great
[55:23] is a total of his thoughts towards us
[55:25] amen he had thoughts of what we would be
[55:28] from before the foundation of the world
[55:30] and they weren't little thoughts they
[55:33] were grand thoughts expressive thoughts
[55:36] Amen amen amen let's turn our Bibles to
[55:43] Hebrews chapter 3
[56:02] will read the 19th verse last verse and
[56:05] then going to chapter for a little bit
[56:10] 19 says so we see that they could not
[56:14] enter in because of unbelief let us
[56:18] therefore fear lest a promise being left
[56:22] to us of entering into his rest that any
[56:25] of you should seem to come short of it
[56:28] for unto us was the gospel preached as
[56:31] well as unto them but the gospel
[56:33] preached did not profit them not being
[56:35] mixed with faith and them that heard it
[56:39] amen so we've all just heard it tonight
[56:42] Amen we all just heard the gospel hey
[56:46] man we just heard the gospel story
[56:48] amen repent be baptized in the name of
[56:51] the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall
[56:53] receive the rest amen you shall receive
[56:55] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you will
[56:58] be immersed baptized into the life of
[57:01] Christ and you'll receive then the glory
[57:03] will be expressed down the inside and
[57:05] that glory has no end and free Friesen
[57:08] upon life's journey you seem to fall
[57:11] short of the glory of God
[57:12] the blood of Christ is standing there
[57:14] and he is staying there as an inner
[57:16] sesor to make intercession for you based
[57:18] upon your confession so there is no
[57:20] excuse there is no excuse for our
[57:22] shortcomings there is no excuse for our
[57:25] our dilly-dallying around there is no
[57:27] excuse for us to fall short of the glory
[57:29] of God because he's already been
[57:31] approved to be the waymaker for us amen
[57:34] so let us let us rise up with a true
[57:36] heart of faith amen amen
[57:38] let us fear lest there be less fall
[57:41] short of the promise of entering into
[57:43] his rest
[57:43] Amen why because the gospel is preached
[57:46] to us just like it was preached to them
[57:48] back there in the day of Moses Amen when
[57:52] they heard the promise of Moses when
[57:55] Moses told and when they became when
[57:57] they when they started sympathizing with
[57:59] the words of Moses and they are sitting
[58:02] there in Egypt and they said okay we can
[58:04] be free from our bondage we'll follow
[58:05] you out into the desert for a while and
[58:06] see what you do and they sympathize with
[58:09] the law of Moses but they were never
[58:10] really bet immersed a man into Jehovah
[58:14] amen they weren't immersed into Jehovah
[58:17] a man they were just kind of following a
[58:19] man they never really fully got to
[58:21] Christ amen and so when the guy out into
[58:25] the wilderness they are baptized into
[58:27] Moses in the Red Sea according to
[58:29] Hebrews I think they said we will follow
[58:31] you Moses everywhere you go and we will
[58:33] believe what you say and then when they
[58:35] got on the other side of the Red Sea
[58:36] they all suddenly began to find out no
[58:39] they would not listen to Moses and no
[58:41] they would not obey the things that he
[58:43] said so it came to find out the word of
[58:45] Moses really meant something the word of
[58:49] Moses the word that they followed out
[58:51] what is it they heard the word there in
[58:55] Egypt they heard the word while they
[58:58] were there in Egypt they said they would
[59:01] follow the word and they follow it for a
[59:03] little while but they never really fully
[59:05] submitted themselves to the word
[59:08] so therefore what was it what caused
[59:12] them not to submit themselves to the
[59:14] word only they did not fully believe
[59:19] because they did not fully surrender and
[59:23] they did not fully surrender because
[59:25] they did not fully believe vice versa
[59:28] amen so so when so the word so Hebrew
[59:32] says that they did not mix with faith
[59:34] the word that was preached shown so then
[59:38] the word never stood up for them amen so
[59:42] so likewise also we have have come out
[59:46] of our our our our sinful nature we were
[59:50] spent all of our lives United with this
[59:53] sin bore nature United in our old union
[59:56] our old marriage we were married to the
[59:58] flesh we when everything the flesh told
[1:00:02] us to do is anointed by the devil we
[1:00:04] would do it
[1:00:05] amen when the flesh said do this we
[1:00:07] listen to the flesh and we did it when
[1:00:09] the flesh said go do that we listen to
[1:00:11] the flesh we did it
[1:00:12] amen and was that we saw the light all
[1:00:15] sudden came down upon our lives amen and
[1:00:19] we heard the word and our eyes were
[1:00:21] opened a man we saw the word we saw the
[1:00:24] glimpse of the light and we and we
[1:00:26] followed that light and it said repent
[1:00:30] and when we saw that our lives were
[1:00:32] contrary to the Scriptures we said all
[1:00:34] repent just like they said we'll repent
[1:00:38] of Egypt and they repent of Egypt and
[1:00:40] follow Moses and so likewise you know we
[1:00:43] as we go down to the and we go what do
[1:00:46] we do we say that's it I'm done with the
[1:00:49] wood things of the world I'm done with
[1:00:51] the foolishness of nine hundred
[1:00:53] denominations upon this earth I'm done
[1:00:56] with the spiritual Babylon I'm done with
[1:00:58] the things of this flesh I'm done with
[1:01:01] all those things and and we go we do we
[1:01:03] walk out in newness of life amen newness
[1:01:06] of life and we and as we keep walking in
[1:01:08] the light as he is in the light walking
[1:01:11] in the ice he's like I also we were
[1:01:13] baptized in the name with Lord Jesus
[1:01:15] Christ why are we baptized the name of
[1:01:17] Lord Jesus Christ because we were
[1:01:18] following Christ amen our eyes have been
[1:01:21] opened to him Amen we've seen the
[1:01:23] revelation of Jesus Christ here on the
[1:01:25] earth
[1:01:25] amen and not just we've seen the
[1:01:28] revelation of Christ the Christ being
[1:01:32] revealed to us he's been revealed and
[1:01:34] again in these last days that he is
[1:01:36] still the same after 2,000 years amen
[1:01:39] we've seen his sign we've seen a star in
[1:01:42] the east and we've come here to worship
[1:01:44] Him Arty's underneath this revelation
[1:01:47] amen so now what do we stand here we
[1:01:49] we've been we've repented we've been
[1:01:51] baptized in the name of Lord Jesus
[1:01:52] Christ what should we do we have to
[1:01:55] express the life amen we have to express
[1:02:01] the life and we do not want to fall
[1:02:05] short of the glory of God amen because
[1:02:08] the glory of God is his own life in us
[1:02:12] amen and you can really only know the
[1:02:15] glory of God when that life is revealed
[1:02:18] down on the inside of you you can talk
[1:02:20] tellers about it but they can never
[1:02:22] really grasp it until they receive it
[1:02:25] themselves
[1:02:25] Amen until then they're just on the
[1:02:27] outside looking in they might have
[1:02:29] repented they might have been baptized
[1:02:32] but but but until they receive the life
[1:02:35] of Christ down on the inside they cannot
[1:02:38] see it cannot understand it amen they're
[1:02:40] hoping unto it
[1:02:42] amen amen
[1:02:46] but once you are filled with the holy

[1:03:46] whatever the spirit told to do he would
[1:03:49] go here and go there no no why he went

[1:04:12] spirit they are here to fulfill Christ's
[1:04:14] will on the earth and fulfill the life

[1:04:33] here to express the life of Christ and
[1:04:35] his life will Express day in day out day
[1:04:38] in day out

[1:04:43] expressing that name upon the life
[1:04:45] Lamb's Book of Life amen he was
[1:04:47] expressing what God's attribute down the
[1:04:50] inside Adam expressed now what is our
[1:04:52] turn to express the our name upon the
[1:04:55] lands book
[1:04:56] like amen amen and we can't stop the
[1:05:01] glory of God has to go from glory unto
[1:05:04] glory unto glory amen why because life
[1:05:07] is still speaking amen that's the then
[1:05:10] that is the token Amen that's the
[1:05:14] attribute God has put down the inside of
[1:05:16] our body that we were once unite in a
[1:05:19] body of sin that was trying to drag you
[1:05:21] to hell but God and His mercy has has
[1:05:24] completely not just divorce you from
[1:05:27] that body but as completely removed you
[1:05:29] from that body and to die it died out to
[1:05:31] that flesh and now you are alive under
[1:05:34] Christ Jesus being immersed into his
[1:05:36] life by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:38] amen that's the mystery of redemption
[1:05:43] amen you're born anew with the new dirt
[1:05:47] that germ on the insight is growing
[1:05:50] growing word upon word word upon word
[1:05:53] word upon word when she sees the word
[1:05:56] she falls in the line behind the word
[1:05:58] and says yes they meant the word and
[1:06:01] when the word is revealed to her she
[1:06:03] says yes I will fulfill that word and
[1:06:06] whenever the word is revealed she obeys
[1:06:08] it the words revealed she obeys it the
[1:06:10] words revealed she obeys it amen why
[1:06:14] it's Christ in you the hope of glory he

[1:06:19] espoused married to the Word of God Amen
[1:06:24] married to the Word of God and now that
[1:06:27] word is expressed in us and all just
[1:06:29] that but all with all the authority of
[1:06:32] the word of God is also in us amen and
[1:06:34] all the power in the Word of God is
[1:06:36] behind us to see that the word is
[1:06:38] fulfilled the same yesterday today and
[1:06:40] forever in us amen so this day March
[1:06:44] 28th or whatever this day is in 2018
[1:06:48] that Christ can be revealed to be the
[1:06:50] same Christ in you the hope of glory and
[1:06:54] I asked what the author wrote hey man
[1:06:57] that's what the author expressed but
[1:06:59] what we have done is we've taken the
[1:07:00] book off the shelf amen I actually
[1:07:03] Christ is the one that took the book off
[1:07:04] the shelf amen what is it Christ he
[1:07:08] stood there he had a book
[1:07:09] his hand and seal with seven seals and
[1:07:12] the book was open it was revealed Amen
[1:07:15] Christ was revealed and what was a
[1:07:17] reveal to us him and us was the marriage
[1:07:20] said the marriage of the Bride of Christ
[1:07:22] being United with the word and that's
[1:07:24] how brother Branham said that's how
[1:07:26] these mysteries are coming forth of
[1:07:28] divorce of marriage and divorce and a
[1:07:31] baptism and of Mystery Babylon all these
[1:07:34] things what are they they're being
[1:07:36] revealed they're being revealed and was
[1:07:37] in underneath that revelation we are
[1:07:39] towing in line with the towing in line
[1:07:41] of thing towing in line with it with the
[1:07:43] revealed Word of God
[1:07:45] hey man why because when when the
[1:07:48] husband revealed the word the bride was
[1:07:52] in agreement with the word Amen amen
[1:07:56] amen amen let's turn to Hebrews chapter
[1:08:05] 3 verse 6
[1:08:22] and it says Hebrews 3:6 s but Christ as
[1:08:29] a son over his own house whose house are
[1:08:32] we if we hold fast the confidence and
[1:08:36] the rejoicing of the hope firm to the
[1:08:39] end that means some rejoicing to the
[1:08:41] hope needs to be going on here
[1:08:42] amen amen wherefore as the Holy Ghost
[1:08:46] saith today if ye will hear his voice
[1:08:48] harden not your hearts as in the
[1:08:51] provocation in the day of temptation in
[1:08:54] the wilderness what is that that those
[1:08:56] that they heard the word of God they
[1:08:59] hardened their hearts against the Word
[1:09:01] of God and they did not fulfill what was
[1:09:03] written upon the lands look like a man
[1:09:05] they chose they showed themselves not
[1:09:07] worthy of the life of God amen so so
[1:09:12] what was it they hardened their hearts
[1:09:14] against what the word said anyone let's
[1:09:18] go down to the thirteenth verse he says
[1:09:20] but exhort one another daily while it is
[1:09:24] called today lest any of you be hardened
[1:09:28] through the deceitfulness of sin that's
[1:09:30] what we're doing tonight well it's
[1:09:31] called today I'm exhorting you your
[1:09:34] heart not be hardened what verse 14 for
[1:09:37] we are made partakers of Christ if we
[1:09:40] hold the beginning of our confidence
[1:09:41] steadfast to the end while is said today
[1:09:45] if you hear his voice harden not your
[1:09:47] hearts as in the day of provocation
[1:09:50] amen amen
[1:09:53] don't harden your hearts God is trying
[1:09:56] to reveal his glorious if we stop if we
[1:10:00] stop we are falling short of the glory
[1:10:02] of God
[1:10:03] why because God's glory is ever
[1:10:05] expanding ever expanding ever expanding
[1:10:07] but if you become crusty if you have a
[1:10:10] portion of the word that you will not
[1:10:11] fall in line with you will not fall in
[1:10:13] obedience to then what are you doing
[1:10:15] you're stopping the glory of God from
[1:10:17] being revealed amen
[1:10:19] the only we have to hold fast the
[1:10:21] steadfastness of the hope unto the end
[1:10:25] amen amen just here in closing let's

[1:11:16] mistakes are written in heaven he says
[1:11:18] your name is written in heaven the
[1:11:20] attributes that I have given you that

[1:11:25] foundation of the world it's written in

[1:12:05] the ionized did see my substance yet
[1:12:08] being unperfect and in thy book all my
[1:12:11] members were written which in
[1:12:13] continuance were fashioned when as yet
[1:12:16] there was none of them how precious also
[1:12:18] are thy thoughts unto me O God how great
[1:12:21] is the sum of them if I should count
[1:12:23] them they're more in number than the
[1:12:24] sand when I awake I am still with thee a
[1:12:28] man God's thoughts towards us are more
[1:12:30] than the sand of the sea a man you know
[1:12:33] I would go as far as saying that when we
[1:12:35] go up in a rasher that we won't even be
[1:12:37] finished expressing all that God has for
[1:12:39] us
