[33:34] amen amen we're just going to get right
[33:37] into the word of God thank you musicians
[33:39] Hallelujah
[33:43] I'm glad he got into my life
[33:50] the battles go get their rage
[33:54] gets hard sometimes
[33:57] you know people don't want to
[33:59] admit that but it does
[34:03] when you think about carrying a cross
[34:05] and
[34:08] and you know at this day and time the
[34:10] way the world is
[34:14] Christians are not
[34:18] how could I say it a favorite
[34:21] of the world
[34:23] but that's the way God ordained it
[34:27] no wonder Paul said I'm not ashamed of
[34:29] the gospel of Christ
[34:31] for it is the power of God unto
[34:33] salvation
[34:35] we're going to come from second
[34:36] Corinthians
[34:38] remember we are still dealing with the
[34:41] the theme topic of the meaning of
[34:44] Calvary what did it what was the meaning
[34:47] what was the reason for it
[34:50] and basically what's the benefits
[34:53] uh because you know even the psalm says
[34:57] forget not all your benefits
[35:00] amen so there are
[35:03] many benefits
[35:06] uh that a Christian can partake of
[35:10] uh in God
[35:12] so second Corinthians 11
[35:16] will begin at the first verse
[35:22] we all have
[35:24] days of success
[35:27] and we sometimes have days of failure
[35:31] but in all of that
[35:34] we still conquerors
[35:37] because uh you know our our conquest or
[35:41] our
[35:42] uh is not us it's Christ and hopefully
[35:46] we'll be able to show you it bring you a
[35:49] peace and a joy
[35:50] sometimes we the enemy he's an accused
[35:53] of the Brethren he knows we're weak when
[35:55] it comes to this flesh
[35:57] uh but
[35:59] Paul separated the whole thing and he
[36:01] says it's not I
[36:04] I'm not doing that he said there's a law
[36:06] in my flesh
[36:08] but the inner man he glorifies God
[36:11] second Corinthians 11 1-4
[36:16] .
[36:19] I've seen where Satan make a man have a
[36:22] hard time during the daytime
[36:25] and then when he gets to church he feels
[36:27] unworthy to praise God all right I've
[36:30] got news for you
[36:32] the devil is a Deceiver
[36:35] and when you become worthy to praise God
[36:38] let me know how you did that
[36:40] because none of us are worthy to praise
[36:43] him
[36:45] if you just consider that
[36:47] what I'm saying because you feel good
[36:50] doesn't make you Worthy
[36:52] in times when you're feeling bad it
[36:54] doesn't make you Worthy
[36:56] the only thing that makes you Worthy is
[36:58] the blood of Jesus Christ
[37:01] second Corinthians 11 1-4
[37:06] and it reads
[37:12] what to God ye could bear with me a
[37:15] little in my Follies
[37:18] and indeed
[37:21] bear with me
[37:22] [Music]
[37:26] should I wait
[37:29] for I am jealous over you with Godly
[37:31] jealousy
[37:33] for I have espoused you to one husband
[37:37] that I may present you as a chaste
[37:40] virgin to Christ
[37:44] but I fear less by any means
[37:48] as the serpent beguiled Eve through his
[37:51] substitute
[37:53] so your mind should be corrupted from
[37:55] the Simplicity that is in Christ
[37:59] but if he that cometh preaches another
[38:02] Jesus
[38:04] who we have not preached
[38:07] or if we receive another spirit
[38:11] which ye have not received
[38:14] or another gospel which ye have not
[38:17] accepted
[38:18] ye might well bear with it bear with him
[38:23] one more scripture
[38:26] will be coming from
[38:30] second Corinthians 5.
[38:34] 21st verse
[38:40] for he hath made
[38:43] him to be sin
[38:45] for us
[38:47] 21st verse right in 5 21.
[38:50] who knew no sin
[38:53] that we might be made the righteousness
[38:57] of God
[38:58] in him
[39:00] made the righteousness of God
[39:05] in him let us pray
[39:08] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[39:10] grace and your mercy
[39:13] we thank you for being so good to us
[39:15] Lord you have been better to us than
[39:17] we've been to ourselves
[39:19] and father I pray Lord God that you
[39:22] would strengthen the believer those who
[39:24] are here tonight
[39:27] normally as usually lord it's only a few
[39:30] come out on Wednesday
[39:32] I don't understand that
[39:35] but I pray father God that wherever your
[39:37] people are you made bless them
[39:40] anointed eyes with eyes out that they
[39:44] might see the day that we're living in
[39:47] Lord you said when we see that day
[39:49] approaching that we ought to come
[39:51] together the more
[39:53] and father even in the times that we do
[39:55] come together we have so many
[39:58] that seemed so uninterested in being
[40:02] here
[40:03] but Lord I know they'll they'll be here
[40:06] if they really truly loved you
[40:09] so I pray that you will increase their
[40:11] love and abide in the spirit of
[40:13] slothfulness and laziness
[40:15] Lord have mercy on your people
[40:18] we need you in these last moments of
[40:20] history in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[40:23] amen you may be seated
[40:27] on Sunday we told you that we were going
[40:30] to be ministering
[40:32] beginning a little thought on The Church
[40:35] Without spot wrinkle or blemish
[40:38] and for a long time I I believe you're
[40:42] not
[40:43] uh believe it or not I didn't understand
[40:45] how
[40:47] I was going to achieve that
[40:49] even as a Christianity that would
[40:52] stumble me because I knew how faulty
[40:56] I was and in all of my efforts
[41:00] there wasn't a day that I didn't come
[41:02] short
[41:04] and so that would always trouble me
[41:08] because I didn't understand it
[41:11] I did not understand that
[41:14] we traded places Christ
[41:18] I didn't understand that he became my
[41:20] sin
[41:23] that I might be made the righteousness
[41:25] of God
[41:28] when it comes to the scripture Paul in
[41:31] second Corinthians
[41:33] warning the church
[41:37] about the Antichrist spirit
[41:40] and I want to say by the grace of God
[41:43] that the whole of America
[41:46] is the Antichrist spirit
[41:49] we understand a man uh
[41:53] Wendy embodiment
[41:55] of that spirit will come into a single
[41:59] man but at this point in time that
[42:02] anointing
[42:03] has anointed this whole civilization
[42:08] man whether you be in America whether
[42:10] you be in Asia whether you be in Africa
[42:14] The World At Large is totally insane
[42:20] what it's really astonishing to me
[42:25] is that people even now don't even know
[42:29] that we have already entered
[42:32] into World War III
[42:34] everybody thinking that it's coming
[42:38] but it has already begun
[42:43] but we find out that we don't see the
[42:46] people of God stirred
[42:50] and I don't know about you but if I knew
[42:53] that a hurricane was coming or a tornado
[42:56] was coming in the light of my district
[42:59] or my house I would find some kind of
[43:02] safety provisions
[43:04] I wouldn't just sit there and say hey
[43:06] it's coming
[43:08] and I feel like this is what's happening
[43:11] to
[43:12] the people they are Bewitched
[43:15] Spellbound they have lost the Zeal and
[43:19] lost the desire to to serve God I don't
[43:23] know about you but I I battle every day
[43:26] and it ain't always with the devil it's
[43:28] with me
[43:30] my will trying to die to my will
[43:35] because this flesh love pleasure
[43:39] and we know that we're living in an age
[43:41] in a time where the people of pleasure
[43:45] more than they love God
[43:48] no doubt many people who are not here
[43:50] tonight they're in some kind of
[43:53] pleasurable setting
[43:55] they're either eating dinner or with
[43:58] their friends
[43:59] or they're looking at TV
[44:01] or monitor
[44:04] but all of these things happen and none
[44:07] of these things have has anything to do
[44:09] with Jesus Christ
[44:11] and when you choose to do such thing you
[44:13] are speaking with your action that you
[44:17] love pleasure
[44:18] more than God
[44:20] because brother Branham said A True
[44:22] Believer
[44:23] one that has the Holy Ghost can hardly
[44:26] wait
[44:27] for the doors of the house of God to
[44:29] open
[44:30] you don't have to beg them you don't
[44:33] have the prod they're going to be there
[44:36] so but Paul was warning that uh it's a
[44:41] simple thing
[44:42] Satan is a wise adversary and don't you
[44:45] ever take him for granted
[44:48] and you know because he deceived
[44:52] Eve with one changing of the scripture
[44:55] where God says
[44:57] you shall die he said You shall surely
[44:59] not die
[45:01] here was a woman who was whole in Beauty
[45:04] whole in character
[45:07] a holy
[45:09] she wore the Garment of Praise if you
[45:11] want to say it like that the the light
[45:13] of God covered their nakedness
[45:17] and all it took was a smart fella
[45:21] recall the serpent
[45:24] to seduce her
[45:26] and he and he seduced her by way of
[45:29] reasoning and psychology
[45:33] and and she walked out
[45:37] of the will of God being deceived she
[45:41] really thought she was doing right and
[45:43] that's what a lot of people are thinking
[45:45] now there's nothing wrong with what I'm
[45:47] doing if I'm elected I've had somebody
[45:49] to say that to me if I'm elected to be
[45:52] bride I'll be there
[45:54] what a terrible attitude
[45:56] because if you really believe that you
[45:58] would be your bride you're doing
[46:00] everything possible
[46:03] to please God to walk with God and to
[46:06] maintain your fellowship with God
[46:09] this whole civilization as brother Adam
[46:11] said is insane
[46:15] and he said the only people on the face
[46:19] of the Earth at the coming of the Lord
[46:21] that would that would have sanity
[46:25] would be the true Christians
[46:28] but now we're living in a situation
[46:31] where wrong is right and right is wrong
[46:35] just like they this uh Transit
[46:40] they call it a she but anyway
[46:43] first time a woman you know went into a
[46:46] school and and killed children or people
[46:50] hello it was not a woman
[46:54] no matter how you dress it up it's a man
[46:57] the DNA says she is a he
[47:02] and you know it just made me sick to my
[47:05] stomach when I was hearing the
[47:07] newscaster saying she and a woman I'm
[47:10] like you deceive people
[47:13] even nature tells us there's only two
[47:16] genders and that's male and female
[47:20] but that's just how insane people are
[47:22] even animals knows the difference
[47:26] but we who are so smart and supposed to
[47:29] be at the head of this thing has
[47:32] belittled ourselves
[47:35] don't you know people don't in this woke
[47:37] situation people don't even appreciate
[47:39] being men they want to be cats and dogs
[47:42] and cows and name it and you have to
[47:44] give them respect for that totally
[47:47] totally totally insane now I can get in
[47:50] trouble by saying this but I don't care
[47:52] because I'm in trouble already because
[47:54] I'm a real Christian
[47:55] foreign
[47:59] Hallelujah
[48:00] see
[48:04] you if you stand still something's wrong
[48:07] you got to keep pushing
[48:08] this is a pressing way and remember
[48:11] Brothers It's a narrow way
[48:14] and as we get closer to the translation
[48:17] it's going to get narrower
[48:20] that means all your baggage you got to
[48:22] lay it down that's right
[48:24] is that right it's like when when Jesus
[48:27] said it's it's it's impossible for a
[48:30] rich man uh to be saved or to move or to
[48:32] go into the eye of a needle and I didn't
[48:34] know the eye of a needle when I was
[48:36] young in in the gospel I thought it was
[48:37] like you know a little needle in your
[48:39] soul with but no there was a place there
[48:42] in in Israel Pakistan wherever it is but
[48:45] in order for the cameras to go through
[48:48] they had to unload this camel the Camel
[48:50] had to get on his knees and they had to
[48:52] have pulled him through
[48:54] it was a it was a narrow way
[48:57] you see so what God was saying is that
[49:00] you got to humble yourself you got to
[49:03] unpack all your stuff
[49:05] and then somebody gonna help pull you
[49:08] through and that is the Holy Spirit
[49:12] yes what's going to happen to these
[49:14] people when they change the money system
[49:17] y'all know they're going to do it right
[49:18] not tomorrow is in our day
[49:21] you better believe it and win the dollar
[49:24] and all of that is no good what on Earth
[49:27] are you going to do
[49:29] y'all better hear what I'm saying
[49:32] because
[49:34] this is not our world
[49:36] this world has been ordained to perish
[49:40] and now we see all the leaders of the
[49:43] world
[49:44] Anointed with the spirit of destruction
[49:48] because they're getting ready to destroy
[49:50] it
[49:51] they're not going to be a a fourth world
[49:53] war it's just a third one
[49:56] and that that's where we have already
[49:58] entered into it has not escalated in the
[50:01] place that is going to escalate too but
[50:05] it's here
[50:06] and my point is have you made yourself
[50:10] ready or are you making yourself ready
[50:15] brother Adam says
[50:17] and the message works is Faith expressed
[50:20] 1965.
[50:23] he said we we realize he's praying he we
[50:26] realize father
[50:28] that we're in a dying generation of
[50:31] people
[50:32] we're headed or faced with eternity
[50:36] the world has gone insane
[50:40] murders little girls being cut to pieces
[50:44] and ravished the people men wearing
[50:48] their hair like women and women like men
[50:51] they're just perverting the race is
[50:54] dying the world is a dying everything is
[50:58] a dying the church is dying
[51:03] hello 1965.
[51:06] and it was dying then where is it now
[51:09] oh God bring bring life
[51:13] oh God life of faith
[51:17] reveal to these people Lord I can only
[51:21] pray and lay my hands upon them but
[51:24] you're the one that can heal them and
[51:27] you're alone can heal them I pray that
[51:31] you will father to each and everyone
[51:34] granted with my hands upon them and
[51:37] asking with all my heart in the name of
[51:40] Jesus Christ heal these people
[51:44] I use that quote because
[51:47] we still need healing
[51:49] yes not just of the physical but mainly
[51:52] of the Soul
[51:54] healing of the spirit we need it this
[51:57] church needs a Revival
[52:02] and we know what Revival is it's not all
[52:05] in the music and the jumping in the
[52:06] shouting and speaking in tongues all of
[52:08] those things are good but a true Revival
[52:11] is when God the anointing comes in and
[52:14] moves the trash out of your life
[52:17] see because we're at a place we can't
[52:19] even move the trash
[52:24] the prophet God said we are in a
[52:26] changing dispensation
[52:31] in identification with Christ in all
[52:34] ages
[52:35] he said and we're in a changing
[52:37] dispensation that's in 1964.
[52:41] we're changing now
[52:43] every change
[52:45] just like building a building
[52:48] you come to the corner you have to make
[52:51] that that bend
[52:52] it it's strange
[52:55] everybody wants to run right straight on
[52:58] down and you'll have just one big wall
[53:02] but we're building a building
[53:06] and we'll come to a corner
[53:09] we'll come to a corner and you've got to
[53:12] change
[53:13] those corners
[53:15] see that's where we're running into
[53:17] issues
[53:18] people in the message are not turning
[53:21] the corner
[53:23] as Brother Don price so well he he said
[53:28] so well started not long ago
[53:31] at those changes is where the Trouble
[53:34] Comes
[53:36] where is hard on that corner to make
[53:41] cut that corner and make it just right
[53:44] see that's what's happening
[53:47] we have been where we are since the
[53:50] prophet died
[53:52] Hallelujah
[53:53] but you see the problem is the change
[53:56] started
[53:58] changing the corner started at the
[54:01] opening of the word
[54:03] we see things amen and hear things Amen
[54:06] in this age that they didn't hear
[54:10] yeah they didn't see it
[54:12] they didn't even know it
[54:14] Hallelujah
[54:17] and now we must understand what is the
[54:20] corner change what is the change if you
[54:23] understand the house
[54:25] brother Branham said it's a pyramid
[54:28] Hallelujah and the changing of the
[54:31] corner is leading us right into what the
[54:33] headstone
[54:35] and the thing that we must understand by
[54:38] God's grace is as we turn we change
[54:43] he said he saw the preview of the bride
[54:46] and she was walking to the tune of the
[54:48] word or and then
[54:50] on another occasion she said marching to
[54:52] Onward Christian Soldier but he said as
[54:55] they walked
[54:57] amen they began to he didn't use the
[55:00] word translate but he said they began to
[55:03] step higher and higher they ascended
[55:05] they began to ascend Hallelujah but the
[55:11] church she was naked insane
[55:15] and didn't even know it
[55:17] with all of that worship she began to go
[55:20] down
[55:22] Hallelujah but the Bride of Jesus Christ
[55:25] she is ordained to go up this is what
[55:29] I'm saying the message must bring change
[55:32] in your life
[55:34] if it's not bringing change something's
[55:37] wrong and if there if there's nothing
[55:39] stirring your heart for a change you see
[55:41] what I'm saying that's where the change
[55:43] began it begins in Your Heart Lord I
[55:46] want to do better
[55:47] Lord I want to be closer Lord I want to
[55:51] be in your image Lord I want the statue
[55:53] of Christ to be fulfilling me I desire
[55:58] amen that Divine love
[56:00] oh Lord feel me like David said to my
[56:04] cup runs over
[56:06] see
[56:08] stand this
[56:10] in this system we were like Israel
[56:11] coming out of law into Grace
[56:14] because whether you realize it or not
[56:17] amen denominations they had Grace but
[56:20] they stopped and they went on with law
[56:23] you got to do this you got to do that
[56:25] you got to do this you got to do that if
[56:27] you don't do this if you don't do that
[56:28] you're lost
[56:30] and they left God out of it
[56:32] every one of them Luther Wesley
[56:36] Pentecost message it got to the place
[56:40] amen it was man leadership over God's
[56:43] leadership
[56:44] a lot of people don't like that but it's
[56:46] true anyhow
[56:48] where the spirit of the Lord is
[56:51] there's liberty
[56:53] and remember I said what does it mean to
[56:56] be free indeed
[56:59] Jesus said I will make you free indeed
[57:03] is that right oh brother Branham you
[57:06] can't go over there but the spirit of
[57:08] the Lord told me to go over there
[57:11] you hear what I'm saying he he could
[57:15] care less about all the politics around
[57:17] him he was able to hear the voice of God
[57:20] and he did what God wanted him to do
[57:23] and people like that gets in trouble
[57:28] with the hierarchy
[57:34] is that right
[57:37] what we need to understand that we're no
[57:39] longer in law The Headstone came to with
[57:42] Grace
[57:43] you see what it is the problem is we're
[57:45] not getting the people to Christ
[57:48] hello you get them to the Holy Ghost and
[57:51] you won't have to worry about how long
[57:54] the dress is and how tight the dress is
[57:56] and how you know man woman we won't have
[57:59] to worry about those Elementary things
[58:04] Holy Ghost bring conviction
[58:08] and because
[58:10] I'm your preacher and you're going to be
[58:11] scared of me how long would that last
[58:16] it's not
[58:22] the invisible Union what you've got to
[58:25] not do I want you to I'm I'm quote this
[58:27] quote and you need to believe this
[58:30] it will set you free if you truly
[58:33] believe it it doesn't mean Satan won't
[58:35] fight your mind
[58:36] but you got to believe this quote
[58:38] coming from the invisible Union of the
[58:40] bride of Christ
[58:41] paragraph 228.
[58:44] but the word Justified
[58:47] is though you've never done it
[58:50] amen
[58:52] it's not even regarded at all
[58:57] how is it done
[59:00] in the god in God's book of the sea of
[59:03] forgetfulness
[59:04] your old book and marriage is divorced
[59:08] and dead
[59:09] it's not even in the memories of God
[59:12] amen
[59:14] amen now you must think I'm crazy but
[59:17] I'm gonna tell you something you know
[59:18] how the devil tricks have tricked me in
[59:21] the past of making me stumble and fall
[59:23] by bringing back memories
[59:27] he uses memories to weaken you
[59:32] to make you fall or to make you stop oh
[59:35] come on y'all know what I'm talking
[59:36] about
[59:37] yeah but why should we remember
[59:40] if God doesn't remember
[59:46] [Music]
[59:50] he said it's not even in the memories of
[59:52] God Amen you are Justified
[59:55] therefore being justified
[59:58] it was accused you was accused
[1:00:03] you've never done it in the first place
[1:00:06] see that's what Paul said the good that
[1:00:08] I would I don't do and I find myself
[1:00:11] doing the things I wouldn't Paul say hey
[1:00:13] it's not me
[1:00:16] said the same thing
[1:00:18] it's not you
[1:00:21] you've never done it in the first place
[1:00:24] the old Union is in the sea of God's
[1:00:26] forgetfulness
[1:00:28] you wasn't married to it to begin with
[1:00:31] he the bridegroom bore your shame
[1:00:36] himself for you in your place
[1:00:40] he became our sin that we would be made
[1:00:44] the righteousness of God
[1:00:47] Hallelujah that's right you wasn't
[1:00:51] married to it to begin with he the
[1:00:54] bridegroom bored your shame himself for
[1:00:56] you in your place now put that in the
[1:01:00] devil's face if you can believe this you
[1:01:04] are Rapture Ready
[1:01:05] [Applause]
[1:01:08] Hallelujah
[1:01:11] yeah
[1:01:14] for your shame for you you see people
[1:01:16] don't even in this message don't even
[1:01:18] understand the principles of the Gospel
[1:01:21] and that's Calvary
[1:01:23] he paid it all
[1:01:25] Hallelujah and then when the lamb came
[1:01:28] and took the book
[1:01:29] he proved he was the one who paid it all
[1:01:33] Hallelujah
[1:01:36] free indeed they don't know what they're
[1:01:39] talking about but thank God Almighty I'm
[1:01:41] faith
[1:01:42] at last Hallelujah
[1:01:44] so you you look at that in homo seems
[1:01:47] impossible to believe it but believe it
[1:01:51] yes
[1:01:52] it's true it's real
[1:01:55] that's where the joy of the Lord comes
[1:01:57] in to know I am free he paid my debt
[1:02:02] Hallelujah is that right even as a man
[1:02:06] brother Branham made mistakes all the
[1:02:08] way up
[1:02:09] he was human
[1:02:12] I would listen to his prayers
[1:02:15] but he was free
[1:02:17] he understood his position
[1:02:19] [Music]
[1:02:21] and he knew he loved God and he knew God
[1:02:24] loved him
[1:02:26] Hallelujah
[1:02:27] see that's all I'm saying when you begin
[1:02:30] to see what all God has done for you you
[1:02:32] can't help but to love him
[1:02:35] and you can't help but to hurt when you
[1:02:37] fall short
[1:02:38] Hallelujah now if your sin is not
[1:02:41] bothering you if you don't when you come
[1:02:43] short and it doesn't bother something's
[1:02:44] wrong with you you need to be born again
[1:02:47] right but when you do wrong the first
[1:02:50] thing you know you feel and sometimes
[1:02:52] you can't believe you did what you just
[1:02:53] did
[1:02:54] or said what you just said y'all know
[1:02:56] you know what I'm saying yeah
[1:03:00] your place
[1:03:05] what bride
[1:03:08] before the foundation of the world the
[1:03:12] Bible says so you are predestinated seed
[1:03:17] Hallelujah I've rarely preached this
[1:03:19] quote why because so many people get the
[1:03:22] wrong idea they think oh I'm
[1:03:25] predestinated I'm bride so I can do what
[1:03:27] I want to do and if you're out there
[1:03:29] sinning with that kind of mentality I
[1:03:31] doubt if you've even even been born
[1:03:33] again
[1:03:35] because the bride knows she's free and
[1:03:38] she knows no matter what she does she
[1:03:39] can she'll be forgiven but she does
[1:03:42] everything she could do to keep from
[1:03:45] sinning against God
[1:03:47] that's the truth
[1:03:51] Hallelujah Jesus
[1:03:56] the thing is we fail to recognize him
[1:04:00] God have mercy that's why G Brothers say
[1:04:04] keep the Lord before you
[1:04:06] keep him before you sing praises to Him
[1:04:09] do whatever you got to do keep him
[1:04:10] before you in the message presence of
[1:04:13] God unrecognized he said but we've got
[1:04:16] to recognize his presence
[1:04:18] and now how you recognize his presence
[1:04:22] is when his promised word for this age
[1:04:26] is made manifest not promised word of
[1:04:29] Moses age or any other age the promise
[1:04:33] of the word for this age
[1:04:36] now let me ask you a question how did
[1:04:39] you know that this message was right
[1:04:42] we saw Jesus Christ
[1:04:44] making himself known
[1:04:47] through a man called William Branham
[1:04:50] you can't be ashamed of that
[1:04:52] it's reality right but now that he's
[1:04:56] gone remember the prophet God said if a
[1:04:59] prophet or a man comes with uh with
[1:05:01] whatever kind of gift and says he is and
[1:05:04] he doesn't bring a different message
[1:05:05] than the one that was before him he said
[1:05:09] you don't believe that
[1:05:12] that's why the brother random couldn't
[1:05:13] leave off the scene until another
[1:05:16] message it's the same message like the
[1:05:19] Bible is the same word but it's just a
[1:05:22] more revelation of it
[1:05:24] right right that was given to the bride
[1:05:26] and he said she will be able to read
[1:05:29] through the lines now let me tell you
[1:05:32] something you can't be reading through
[1:05:34] the lines if you're not spiritual
[1:05:39] this is to me to most people what I'm
[1:05:42] preaching now is blasphemous
[1:05:47] because brother I'm coming into is that
[1:05:49] everything he is we are
[1:05:54] see this is the maturing of the Bride
[1:05:57] She's Not Afraid Of The Challenge or
[1:06:00] however you want to put it she's not
[1:06:02] afraid she realizes that God is bringing
[1:06:05] us into a place we've never been before
[1:06:09] Hallelujah and he's not talking about
[1:06:12] perfecting this he's talking about
[1:06:14] perfecting this the inner man is in so
[1:06:17] much control he literally binds this
[1:06:21] flesh
[1:06:22] if you think the flesh is not going to
[1:06:24] just lay down and you say okay you know
[1:06:26] no no no no every day you got to deal
[1:06:29] with this thing
[1:06:30] right
[1:06:32] listen the word of God as I said earlier
[1:06:34] he became our sin that we might become
[1:06:36] I'm talking about without spot wrinkle
[1:06:38] or blemish there is no human way no
[1:06:42] possibility for you to be able to
[1:06:45] present yourself before God without spot
[1:06:49] wrinkled or blemish a way had to be made
[1:06:53] and that way was through Jesus Christ's
[1:06:56] sacrifice the blood of the Lamb is that
[1:06:59] right even in the Old Testament every
[1:07:02] vessel would sprinkled with blood
[1:07:05] Hallelujah and you've got to have your
[1:07:08] blood experience
[1:07:10] Hallelujah that's right
[1:07:13] that's right it's simple
[1:07:16] and Paul said I'm really concerned in
[1:07:19] Corinthians he says lest you be beguiled
[1:07:21] as Eve was beguiled she was tricked and
[1:07:24] let me tell you something the trick of
[1:07:26] this whole thing is you this thing can
[1:07:28] move into it so easily into a systematic
[1:07:31] worship it would be very difficult for
[1:07:34] you to see it
[1:07:36] huh it takes the Holy Spirit to sound
[1:07:39] the alarm but what about Ephesus
[1:07:42] what about Ephesus when they were there
[1:07:44] in Ephesus and this little nicolating
[1:07:46] deed came in everybody didn't see it
[1:07:50] but those who want the Holy Ghost
[1:07:53] they hated the deed
[1:07:55] and it was it was all about hierarchy
[1:07:58] one man being greater than the other
[1:08:02] Hallelujah that's not the gospel Jesus
[1:08:06] washed his disciples feet and said this
[1:08:08] is what I want you to do come down to
[1:08:11] the same level one blood for one body
[1:08:15] see
[1:08:16] Hallelujah
[1:08:20] you and I must understand by the grace
[1:08:22] of God that we are here to be free not
[1:08:26] to be placed in bondage all over again
[1:08:29] amen so now we are invited into you see
[1:08:33] that's that's why so many people didn't
[1:08:35] stand doing the coven
[1:08:37] because they were so involved into a
[1:08:39] systematic worship to when their system
[1:08:41] was taken away the god that they worship
[1:08:44] was taken with it
[1:08:46] [Music]
[1:08:52] you love Jesus where did he disappear to
[1:08:56] yeah you understand me
[1:08:58] and my point is this did the mighty
[1:09:00] angel of Revelation 10 come down
[1:09:04] he came down one for the land one on the
[1:09:06] sea did he ever leave us no he's here
[1:09:11] the power of God is here even brother
[1:09:14] Bradham called it he said the super
[1:09:16] anointing
[1:09:18] it's here but you know what if you don't
[1:09:21] tap into it it's not his fault
[1:09:24] huh let me tell you something about a
[1:09:27] woman that the Bible talked about Mary
[1:09:28] who is a prostitute right she heard that
[1:09:31] Jesus was at Simon's house she was
[1:09:33] disconnected but she heard about what he
[1:09:36] had done and she pressed through the
[1:09:39] crowd she went through all of the
[1:09:41] criticism right and when she saw Jesus
[1:09:44] she went to his feet
[1:09:47] what did she do she humbled herself
[1:09:50] didn't even ask him for nothing see
[1:09:53] that's what people don't understand you
[1:09:55] don't always have to ask with your mouth
[1:09:59] when your heart is right
[1:10:01] God is going to say what is it that you
[1:10:03] want
[1:10:04] right he go right down to the source and
[1:10:08] he'll give you what your hearts desire
[1:10:13] you said brother Brooks I don't know
[1:10:14] about you well let's show you how he did
[1:10:16] it with brother Branham there were
[1:10:18] people out in the audience praying Lord
[1:10:21] please let that Prophet call my name
[1:10:25] praying inwardly I don't know but here
[1:10:29] was a man all the way in the front of
[1:10:30] the auditorium heard
[1:10:33] y'all understand what I'm saying what
[1:10:35] was it he said God would go out of his
[1:10:37] way to bless you
[1:10:39] and he will because there were ones who
[1:10:43] were battling with doubt and I believe
[1:10:45] he said oh oh you're going to miss it
[1:10:46] you're going to miss it uh let me and he
[1:10:49] calls their name he said I I hope that
[1:10:51] helped you
[1:10:52] right and that was the Holy Spirit
[1:10:55] helping them over the hump listen we
[1:10:58] don't understand a lot of things but one
[1:11:00] thing I know God has ordained us to be
[1:11:04] victorious over the devil
[1:11:07] and he'll do everything he can to help
[1:11:10] us get over the hump is that right that
[1:11:13] true
[1:11:15] everything
[1:11:20] Hallelujah and just like God used to
[1:11:23] profit God want to use us now we don't
[1:11:26] we don't have that gift that's only one
[1:11:28] in one in a lifetime you know what I
[1:11:30] mean but but as a bride
[1:11:33] when you take on this message you
[1:11:35] literally take on the son of man
[1:11:38] that's a quote
[1:11:40] he said it
[1:11:42] and we and we must understand that same
[1:11:45] son of man that stood there William
[1:11:47] Branham is in the bride right now
[1:11:50] amen
[1:11:51] [Music]
[1:11:53] he said now so now we're invited to to
[1:11:57] him so now we are invited to him
[1:12:00] to be partaker of all that he is did
[1:12:06] y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:12:08] he said to be partaker
[1:12:11] this is the meaning of Calvary it's to
[1:12:14] restore the man
[1:12:17] the humankind back to the proper
[1:12:20] position as two sons and daughters of
[1:12:23] God
[1:12:24] by the way I'm saying when those seals
[1:12:25] were opened right I love this because he
[1:12:28] said I'm paraphrasing it it put us back
[1:12:31] into the position of Adam before he fell
[1:12:35] now think about it meditate on that
[1:12:38] everything was all or had to obey him
[1:12:41] the Sun the moon the stars the wind the
[1:12:44] rain the trees everything the animals
[1:12:46] had to obey him
[1:12:50] now he wasn't like some of these people
[1:12:52] let me see what can I do now mountain
[1:12:54] move over here no no no no no everything
[1:12:56] was inspired by the cool the voice that
[1:12:59] walked in the cool of the
[1:13:02] Hallelujah it was a voice
[1:13:05] the very voice that inspired him is the
[1:13:08] very voice that inspires us that's why
[1:13:12] God could have a human being in this age
[1:13:16] just one man representing him because
[1:13:19] now it's a courtship between him and his
[1:13:22] bride
[1:13:23] Eliza has to step aside oh y'all better
[1:13:27] understand what I'm saying that's what
[1:13:29] it really is
[1:13:30] well yeah it's the truth
[1:13:33] we're invited to him which is which is
[1:13:36] hid
[1:13:38] to the unbeliever
[1:13:40] by the veil of human flesh
[1:13:43] nobody could see God in brother Branham
[1:13:46] they thought he was just a not everybody
[1:13:48] I mean some people did I mean just like
[1:13:50] some people saw who Jesus was and most
[1:13:53] of the religious people never did see
[1:13:55] him even in G in brother bear who say
[1:13:57] most of the religion people never did
[1:13:59] see who he was
[1:14:00] or what he represented even though he
[1:14:03] told him straight up at times they still
[1:14:06] didn't believe him they ain't that funny
[1:14:07] they didn't believe him but they were
[1:14:09] afraid of him
[1:14:11] they're like I try to tell people I said
[1:14:13] yeah y'all talk about brother Brandon
[1:14:14] bad now because he's not here
[1:14:18] I said if he was here you wouldn't be
[1:14:20] said the things you're saying right they
[1:14:23] know it's the truth the man can't defend
[1:14:26] himself
[1:14:27] you know they Twisted a lot of things
[1:14:29] brother Branham said even when he was
[1:14:31] alive so you can imagine what what
[1:14:33] they're doing now
[1:14:35] yeah let's move on we're invited into
[1:14:38] him which is here to unbelieve us by the
[1:14:42] veil of human flesh see they know that
[1:14:45] Glory they read of it in the word here
[1:14:49] the glory of God and the things like
[1:14:51] that it's just words to them to us it's
[1:14:55] a manifestation see
[1:14:57] it is a normal word I love this it is a
[1:15:02] reality see this message to me is a
[1:15:04] reality because nothing could have
[1:15:07] changed me like God Has Changed Me
[1:15:10] [Applause]
[1:15:12] am I am I where I want to be no but I
[1:15:15] can see a movie I can see a change and
[1:15:19] the changes is in his own time but I
[1:15:22] know he promised that he'll make all
[1:15:24] things beautiful
[1:15:28] to the Lord like that I said Lord you
[1:15:31] said you'll make all things beautiful
[1:15:34] in your time
[1:15:36] yes sir I believe that Hallelujah I
[1:15:39] might look like a little ugly duckling
[1:15:41] right now but that same little ugly duck
[1:15:43] can turn out to be a beautiful swan
[1:15:46] Hallelujah yes sir in God's own time
[1:15:51] yes he said God said let there be light
[1:15:54] that was the word but now there is light
[1:16:00] it ain't the word it's the light see
[1:16:04] what I mean
[1:16:05] now it isn't just written word to God us
[1:16:09] it's a reality this message is light
[1:16:13] at one time it was on the word it was on
[1:16:16] the pages of the book but now it is a
[1:16:18] reality and that's what I don't think
[1:16:20] people are seeing we are literally
[1:16:23] seeing the manifestation of what God
[1:16:26] meant when he said let there be light
[1:16:32] we are in him
[1:16:34] now we're enjoying
[1:16:37] now he behold now we Behold Him now we
[1:16:41] see him the word
[1:16:43] manifesting himself is hid out there
[1:16:46] because why it's veiled in human flesh
[1:16:51] that's it
[1:16:54] yeah I've had people call me all kinds
[1:16:58] of names I mean people who believe this
[1:16:59] person because
[1:17:02] it wasn't given to them to understand
[1:17:04] and some of them don't even believe the
[1:17:07] message no more
[1:17:09] I had a precious brother who had a gift
[1:17:11] of discernment of something he had I
[1:17:13] know God used him in my life and he
[1:17:15] tried to turn me away from this message
[1:17:17] brother I'm at a point of no return
[1:17:20] [Laughter]
[1:17:21] I'm too deep in this I said I'd have
[1:17:25] laid my soul on this
[1:17:27] I have what else
[1:17:29] God excuse me TD Jakes whatever whatever
[1:17:33] his name is whatever you know what I
[1:17:35] mean maybe I shouldn't call his name but
[1:17:37] the point is
[1:17:39] you know you you Osteen
[1:17:43] yeah
[1:17:46] he looked too much like a priest
[1:17:53] you're gonna get in trouble boy
[1:17:55] that's all right like I said I'm in
[1:17:57] trouble already because I'm a Christian
[1:18:00] Hallelujah amen his name is exalted
[1:18:04] above all names
[1:18:07] listen we can't glorify people that's
[1:18:09] not preaching the gospel yet they say
[1:18:11] they are
[1:18:15] out of all those people how many of them
[1:18:18] you think know Jesus
[1:18:20] now I read to you
[1:18:24] Paul talked about it there are many
[1:18:26] jesuses
[1:18:28] but if they're not preaching the Jesus
[1:18:30] Paul preach
[1:18:33] it's another one
[1:18:35] huh now Paul said in the inspiration of
[1:18:39] God
[1:18:40] he said I want to know him
[1:18:43] not just in the power of his
[1:18:44] resurrection but I want to know him in
[1:18:46] his suffering but we don't want to know
[1:18:48] him any suffering well maybe that's a
[1:18:49] different Jesus you got
[1:18:53] y'all understand me because when you
[1:18:55] sold out to God you don't mind suffering
[1:18:57] for him huh I've had you know what my
[1:19:01] young Christian days they call you a
[1:19:03] holy roll I have my the man we was
[1:19:05] renting from and he came to pick up the
[1:19:07] rich and me and Ruby started testifying
[1:19:10] about the Lord he said you Holy Rollers
[1:19:14] that might have been my first time
[1:19:16] hearing about a Holy Roller but you know
[1:19:22] because I was
[1:19:24] how I enjoy being a Christian
[1:19:27] the problem that bothers me I wish I was
[1:19:30] a better Christian
[1:19:32] that's the thing
[1:19:34] right his name is exalted above all
[1:19:37] names to approach God you must approach
[1:19:40] him in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:19:43] he is the door the truth the way
[1:19:47] right right is the truth
[1:19:51] hallelujah Paul said it in Romans he
[1:19:54] said for I know that in me that is in my
[1:19:57] flesh
[1:19:58] dwelleth no good thing to will is
[1:20:02] present with me y'all know what I'm
[1:20:03] talking about
[1:20:06] but how to perform that which is good I
[1:20:11] find not
[1:20:12] the other day I was so tired
[1:20:16] and I was going to fix me some tea I
[1:20:18] think it was
[1:20:19] and my wife was sitting in the chair she
[1:20:21] said honey would you fix me a cup of tea
[1:20:23] too I did one of these numbers
[1:20:26] thank you
[1:20:33] I said so I said honey I'm so tired but
[1:20:37] I'll fix you a cough my flesh you're
[1:20:40] fainted on me
[1:20:43] she said don't worry about it honey she
[1:20:45] said I feel that way sometimes too
[1:20:48] but you see the flesh will faint
[1:20:51] I did not mean to give that response
[1:20:55] but it took just that moment
[1:20:58] [Laughter]
[1:21:00] oh Lord I was so glad she understood
[1:21:03] there was no no misunderstanding but she
[1:21:05] understood for the good that I would I
[1:21:08] do not
[1:21:10] but the evil which I would not that I do
[1:21:13] now come on somebody why do you know God
[1:21:16] will let you see things because she
[1:21:18] could have asked that question way
[1:21:20] before then but God allowed me to be
[1:21:23] really tired I'm thinking how tired I
[1:21:25] was but you see you don't know what's in
[1:21:28] you until that part is punched
[1:21:33] yeah there it is Boom but but you know
[1:21:38] you we have that space to repent
[1:21:40] that's the thing you don't leave it that
[1:21:43] way right you repentance and and then do
[1:21:46] it redeem that time
[1:21:49] right you didn't feel like it and you
[1:21:50] probably don't feel like it still yet
[1:21:52] but do it
[1:21:54] that's what I do
[1:21:55] now if I do that which I would not let
[1:21:58] me hurry up it is no more I that do it
[1:22:01] but sin that dwelleth
[1:22:03] in me
[1:22:05] describe what me was he said in my flesh
[1:22:08] I find in a law that when I would do
[1:22:12] good evil is present with me
[1:22:16] have you ever tried witnessing to
[1:22:18] somebody
[1:22:19] and the whole time the devil is trying
[1:22:22] to make your thoughts become carnal
[1:22:26] somebody know what I'm talking about for
[1:22:29] I Delight in the law of God
[1:22:35] I Delight in the law of God after the
[1:22:37] inward man
[1:22:39] but I see another law in my members
[1:22:42] warring against the law of my mind and
[1:22:45] bring me into captivity of the law of
[1:22:48] sin which is in my members that Paul is
[1:22:51] is explaining something to us but Paul
[1:22:54] is free
[1:22:55] he understand what it is but he also
[1:22:58] understand he's covered by the blood
[1:23:00] or ratchet man that I am and you heard
[1:23:03] me preach this before who shall deliver
[1:23:05] me from the body of this death
[1:23:08] because that's exactly what it is I
[1:23:11] thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord
[1:23:13] so then with the mind I might myself
[1:23:16] serve the law of God but with the flesh
[1:23:19] the law of sin Hallelujah see so he's
[1:23:23] saying listen I'm going to make mistakes
[1:23:25] but it's the Inner Man
[1:23:27] it's this guy because this going to be
[1:23:30] redeemed it's not redeemed yet
[1:23:33] but one day we'll put on a new body
[1:23:36] Hallelujah
[1:23:39] see it is it is almost impossible
[1:23:42] because the sharing uh to do what God
[1:23:45] requires us to do without his blood or
[1:23:48] his power of his blood right like I said
[1:23:51] I'm only I'm just doing this because I
[1:23:53] want you to understand I'm still working
[1:23:54] with the meaning of Calvary the purpose
[1:23:56] of Calvary and now I'm working with
[1:23:58] without spot wrinkle of blemish to show
[1:24:01] you
[1:24:02] all human effort
[1:24:04] must be surrendered
[1:24:06] you know I told I think I told you guys
[1:24:08] about this the other day how that when
[1:24:11] um
[1:24:12] Jesus
[1:24:14] when he was in you know in in in the
[1:24:17] Garden of Gethsemane and he says father
[1:24:19] not my will
[1:24:21] die and be done
[1:24:23] but see we hear that but we fail to see
[1:24:26] how he labored
[1:24:28] to get to that point
[1:24:39] surrender you've got to labor
[1:24:43] till you kill it it has the dies brother
[1:24:46] though and rocked
[1:24:48] and when he said not my will but thine
[1:24:51] be done at that point
[1:24:53] he defeated the devil
[1:24:56] in every test
[1:24:58] that day
[1:25:01] and and you know the human will is
[1:25:03] something else and I I just didn't know
[1:25:05] how powerful that thing was
[1:25:07] it's true amen until recently I began to
[1:25:10] press
[1:25:12] and then you find out there's something
[1:25:13] pressing behind pressing you another way
[1:25:15] but I'm pressing and something pushes
[1:25:18] you and you're pressing right it's a
[1:25:20] real wall it's nothing to play with but
[1:25:23] listen that light in you I told the
[1:25:26] devil I said you might trick me
[1:25:28] sometimes but one thing about me I'm not
[1:25:31] a quitter
[1:25:32] I'll never give up
[1:25:34] right I can't give up
[1:25:36] [Music]
[1:25:38] and then you know oh turn around turn
[1:25:40] around to what
[1:25:43] I I spoke I've spoken to the Lord many
[1:25:46] times and y'all might think I'm crazy
[1:25:49] but I'd rather burn in hell till I come
[1:25:51] to no existence than to ever be exists
[1:25:54] in existence serving Satan
[1:26:00] I'm not his
[1:26:02] I wasn't born in this world to be his
[1:26:06] y'all hear what I'm saying there's
[1:26:08] nothing about him I like
[1:26:13] if it wasn't for this flesh I would be
[1:26:15] perfect
[1:26:17] I'm just telling you
[1:26:19] because we got to understand I'm really
[1:26:21] beginning to see my freedom because when
[1:26:23] you don't see your freedom you won't see
[1:26:25] your joy
[1:26:26] and you won't see Christ
[1:26:29] right he said in that day you'll know
[1:26:31] I'm in the Father the father's in me and
[1:26:33] I am in you and you know what the Bible
[1:26:34] said at his right hand
[1:26:37] in fullness of joy
[1:26:39] amen so if you're not at his right hand
[1:26:41] your joy is not full I
[1:26:43] full Joy
[1:26:46] I don't know just religion I don't have
[1:26:49] religion for years
[1:26:51] Lord please restore my joy
[1:26:58] how many times you in your early
[1:27:00] Christian days I don't know how how
[1:27:02] things are but you smile so much about
[1:27:04] Jesus till your jaws hurt
[1:27:07] y'all ever had that experience you're so
[1:27:10] happy try it you don't have to try it
[1:27:12] it's a come on you know I mean it's not
[1:27:14] a put on it's a come on
[1:27:16] let me have people looking at you like
[1:27:18] you're crazy
[1:27:21] let me move on I'm gonna cut it in just
[1:27:24] a bit
[1:27:25] Hebrews 9 22.
[1:27:29] and almost all things are by the law
[1:27:33] purged with blood
[1:27:35] and without the shedding of blood is no
[1:27:39] remission
[1:27:42] huh now bulls and goats that blood could
[1:27:46] never remit your sin
[1:27:49] all it could do was cover it
[1:27:52] you know what I'm saying and for those
[1:27:54] of us who have have houses and
[1:27:56] apartments and you've got carpet or
[1:27:57] whatever you know sometimes are staying
[1:27:59] to get on it and you can't get it up
[1:28:01] just right you put a rug over it
[1:28:04] but it doesn't mean that the stain has
[1:28:06] disappeared
[1:28:07] the covering is there that's just
[1:28:09] religion
[1:28:10] we don't need religion we need salvation
[1:28:15] amen right the covering we the only
[1:28:17] covering we need is the blood of Jesus
[1:28:20] Christ
[1:28:23] listen I I read this quote I'm gonna
[1:28:25] read it again because we need to
[1:28:27] remember this but let me move up to it
[1:28:30] the All-Seeing Eye of God sees it all
[1:28:34] there is no hiding place
[1:28:36] every sin will be brought to light
[1:28:39] only the blood of Jesus can free us from
[1:28:42] the penalty of sin and death
[1:28:44] Psy is proved that your actions Never
[1:28:48] Dies that those are my words but here's
[1:28:51] what brother Weller says he said you
[1:28:53] know
[1:28:54] like in television
[1:28:56] television has picked up the every time
[1:28:59] we even moved our finger anything
[1:29:03] it's on record
[1:29:05] every word we say is on record
[1:29:09] now see television has proven that now
[1:29:12] television doesn't manufacture picture
[1:29:15] it only channels that wave into the
[1:29:18] television see it doesn't make it that's
[1:29:22] what there was television when Adam
[1:29:24] walked on the earth there was television
[1:29:26] when Moses come to the Red Sea there was
[1:29:29] television when Elijah was on Mount
[1:29:31] Carmel see but they just now discovered
[1:29:35] it see and now everywhere every move we
[1:29:39] make every sound it playing a record
[1:29:42] that will meet us at the Judgment every
[1:29:45] move we make has got to meet us there
[1:29:49] I've got to answer for the words that I
[1:29:52] say to you as a minister I've got to do
[1:29:55] it because God will hold me responsible
[1:29:58] for it
[1:30:00] to it you understand me
[1:30:03] is that right
[1:30:04] and that's for everybody that's not just
[1:30:06] for a preacher
[1:30:07] everybody
[1:30:10] you know even even it's so amazing in in
[1:30:12] the book of uh Genesis you know God Adam
[1:30:15] Adam where are thou now now come on you
[1:30:18] know God knew he was he wanted Adam's
[1:30:22] response
[1:30:24] God knew where Adam was there was no
[1:30:26] Hiding Place not there not now
[1:30:30] God before Adam he and God knew where
[1:30:32] he's hiding
[1:30:34] but he needed to know Adam excuse me
[1:30:38] Adam needed to know
[1:30:40] by his own confession why he was hiding
[1:30:46] and Adam says Lord we're hiding because
[1:30:49] we're naked
[1:30:51] see that's what he needed to know he's
[1:30:54] experienced something he's never
[1:30:56] experienced before
[1:30:58] but even Adam
[1:31:00] calls it by name
[1:31:02] we're naked he never knew nothing about
[1:31:05] it how do you know about this nakedness
[1:31:08] he said because the serpent
[1:31:11] see what I'm saying
[1:31:13] so that's you and I must understand that
[1:31:16] that when when we're naked we know it
[1:31:20] now I'll put it this way this generation
[1:31:23] does it does it
[1:31:25] laodicea was naked and didn't know it
[1:31:28] but when we make mistakes we know when
[1:31:30] the clothing has been taken away
[1:31:34] Hallelujah Revelation 9 6 through 10
[1:31:36] says and I heard it was the voice of a
[1:31:38] great multitude as the voice of many
[1:31:41] Waters I love that because it's one
[1:31:43] voice
[1:31:44] one voice right and as the voice of
[1:31:47] Mighty thundering saying hallelujah for
[1:31:51] the Lord God omnipotent rain let us be
[1:31:54] glad and rejoice and give honor to him
[1:31:56] for the marriage of the Lamb has come
[1:31:59] and his wife have made herself ready
[1:32:04] thank you
[1:32:07] come on somebody you got to put your
[1:32:10] name in that where it says wife
[1:32:20] that word was prophesying about me
[1:32:24] so it ain't if I'm going to make it it's
[1:32:28] not if I will be ready the Bible said I
[1:32:32] made myself ready
[1:32:34] amen
[1:32:36] oh Lord maybe I'm the only one that's
[1:32:38] just really enjoying this but I'll tell
[1:32:40] you what Hallelujah glory to God for the
[1:32:45] marriage of the Lamb has come and his
[1:32:47] wife hath made herself ready
[1:32:51] and that's what the prophet of God said
[1:32:53] you've got to do something
[1:32:55] he don't sit here and says Lord put on
[1:32:57] my clothes no there's some things you
[1:33:00] must do
[1:33:02] it all works together
[1:33:04] is that right
[1:33:08] Hallelujah I mean come on
[1:33:11] David could have went up to the Goliath
[1:33:13] with no stone
[1:33:16] but a revelation came to him
[1:33:19] something he knew he was Victorious
[1:33:22] and something inspired him to pick up
[1:33:25] five Stones I'm gonna get this guy and
[1:33:28] if his other brothers come they go into
[1:33:30] see he was ready
[1:33:33] right
[1:33:35] I mean I tell people I said David could
[1:33:37] have done the cartwheel he could have
[1:33:38] turned back was he gonna whatever and
[1:33:40] once he loose that stone it was out of
[1:33:43] his control
[1:33:44] God is always in control and God will
[1:33:48] always know make you hit your target
[1:33:50] hello especially when you are inspired
[1:33:54] to do it
[1:33:56] amen
[1:33:58] y'all love the Lord see God fights your
[1:34:01] battles
[1:34:02] and that's the problem we must learn God
[1:34:05] fights our battles
[1:34:08] we're always getting in the way
[1:34:10] hello
[1:34:15] huh
[1:34:16] you know I you know what I'm gonna tell
[1:34:19] you this is it
[1:34:20] you can't give up to God and then go
[1:34:23] pick it back up
[1:34:25] whatever you surrender leave it there
[1:34:28] well how you know I you didn't I'm not I
[1:34:30] didn't leave there because any time you
[1:34:32] say I've left it and you worry about it
[1:34:35] you still got it
[1:34:38] because once you leave something at the
[1:34:40] altar you don't worry matter of fact it
[1:34:43] almost seems unfair that you can do that
[1:34:45] but that's what he said he has what he
[1:34:48] wants us to do the Bible said cast all
[1:34:51] your cares upon him because he cares for
[1:34:53] you
[1:34:54] Hallelujah now I know one thing I can't
[1:34:57] change myself
[1:34:59] but I know the man who can
[1:35:03] so I go to him
[1:35:11] I said well God it ain't gone yet
[1:35:14] yes I'm I'm here and I'm not going to
[1:35:17] move until this thing is moving till
[1:35:20] it's gone until there's nothing left you
[1:35:23] say how is that possible because I know
[1:35:26] what he did with me when it came to
[1:35:27] drinking and God took all of that from
[1:35:30] me all of it and I can drink right now
[1:35:34] without wanting more like I'm out of
[1:35:36] control
[1:35:38] I take real communion real wine
[1:35:41] so you can't tell me God can't deliver
[1:35:44] alcoholism
[1:35:46] I never was a drug addict but I know
[1:35:49] what I used to do when it came to
[1:35:50] alcohol
[1:35:51] my dad was one my sister was one my
[1:35:54] cousin was one
[1:35:55] you name it
[1:35:57] it was a family affair
[1:36:01] Hallelujah but God rich in Mercy
[1:36:07] that's what I said to the Lord the other
[1:36:09] day it says Lord I need some mercy today
[1:36:11] he said go listen to God rich and mercy
[1:36:14] I say I sure will see when you talk to
[1:36:16] him he speaks back
[1:36:18] let me tell you something I just don't
[1:36:20] go randomly free speaking you know
[1:36:22] picking up Tates or listening to a
[1:36:24] message I see God lord what do you want
[1:36:26] me to hear today
[1:36:30] he directs me and you know what what I
[1:36:33] need is right on it sometimes it's like
[1:36:35] in the first paragraph excuse me that's
[1:36:38] mean the grapes are getting good but let
[1:36:40] me hurry up
[1:36:41] Hallelujah
[1:36:44] let us be glad and rejoice and get honor
[1:36:47] to him for the marriage of the Lamb has
[1:36:49] come and his wife hath made herself
[1:36:52] ready
[1:36:53] and to her was granted that she should
[1:36:55] be a raid in fine linen and clean and
[1:36:57] white for the fine lending is the
[1:37:00] righteousness of the Saints and he said
[1:37:02] unto him right blessed are they that are
[1:37:05] called into the marriage supper of the
[1:37:06] lamb and he said unto me these are true
[1:37:09] sayings of God I fell at his feet to
[1:37:12] worship him and he said unto me see thou
[1:37:15] doeth did not I am thy servant and thy
[1:37:18] Brethren let's turn the corners people
[1:37:22] Oklahoma that's what we did we failed at
[1:37:25] brother random's feet
[1:37:27] and of that Brethren that that have
[1:37:29] testified of Jesus
[1:37:31] worship God
[1:37:33] for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit
[1:37:35] of Prophecy
[1:37:38] John typed the prophet
[1:37:41] John was the prophet
[1:37:44] John also was the bride
[1:37:47] but the man the angel that spoke there's
[1:37:49] only one angel
[1:37:51] that was ordained
[1:37:53] to be in place on Earth
[1:37:55] when the seals will be opened
[1:37:59] only one
[1:38:01] and you know the message was so and
[1:38:04] still is beyond anything we could have
[1:38:07] comprehended
[1:38:09] no man could have done this
[1:38:11] I don't care how big his office or small
[1:38:13] this office was how many books he could
[1:38:15] have read there's no way a man could
[1:38:18] have come up with this kind of language
[1:38:21] that so fit into the word
[1:38:24] like a hand and a glove
[1:38:27] no man could have done that
[1:38:29] right and so I understand worship
[1:38:33] how easy it was for people to worship
[1:38:35] Him and most of them is because they
[1:38:38] didn't read your their Bibles
[1:38:40] the Bible keeps you in a balance
[1:38:43] right now when it comes to God um of
[1:38:47] doing something great
[1:38:49] when the change has been completed and
[1:38:51] and listen the change is not completed
[1:38:53] yet in the mind of God yes but in time
[1:38:56] no and the changes are being completed
[1:38:59] you and I are now moving into that
[1:39:01] complete and that final stage as I said
[1:39:04] it
[1:39:05] earlier and I'ma stop here
[1:39:12] I pray that
[1:39:14] brother this is the way I'm paraphrased
[1:39:16] the brother brother Brian said the
[1:39:18] foolish virgins thought that they were
[1:39:20] under the blood
[1:39:22] you can find it
[1:39:24] they thought they were under the blood
[1:39:28] and I could really see it because so
[1:39:30] many of them out there shouting and
[1:39:32] speaking in tongue and say they're under
[1:39:33] the blood
[1:39:34] they got the Holy Ghost and it's not so
[1:39:38] I'm not saying they all don't have it
[1:39:40] but what I'm saying is there are many
[1:39:42] who've been deceived because the Nature
[1:39:44] has not been changed when the Holy Ghost
[1:39:46] comes it changes your nature
[1:39:49] is that right oh yeah the Bible said it
[1:39:52] it it literally uh uh give cleanses your
[1:39:56] consciousness
[1:39:57] it takes away your desire to sin
[1:40:02] and and and then changes your affection
[1:40:04] to things that are above
[1:40:07] now
[1:40:09] in my closing
[1:40:14] when we see the
[1:40:17] big group in Revelation 7. and nine we
[1:40:21] come to understand that's the foolish
[1:40:23] version because they came out of Great
[1:40:25] Tribulation
[1:40:27] but look how
[1:40:31] it spoken to them because right right
[1:40:33] after the 144 000
[1:40:36] you know how the language is in the
[1:40:38] Bible in the ninth verse it says of the
[1:40:40] seventh chapter after this I beheld and
[1:40:43] lower a great multitude which no man
[1:40:45] could number
[1:40:46] of all Nations and kindreds and people
[1:40:50] in tongues stood Before the Throne
[1:40:53] and before the lamb clothed with white
[1:40:56] rose
[1:40:58] and Palms in their hands and Palms is a
[1:41:01] it spiritually means the victory of the
[1:41:04] spirit over the flesh
[1:41:07] right
[1:41:08] but the Bride of Jesus she's an
[1:41:10] overcomer now
[1:41:12] the foolish virgins goes through the
[1:41:14] tribulation to be purged
[1:41:17] right the Bride of Jesus Christ is being
[1:41:19] purged now
[1:41:20] she's being clear and she's literally
[1:41:23] you know transforming right now by the
[1:41:26] by the word by the washing of the water
[1:41:30] of the words
[1:41:31] and and you know I know by God's grace
[1:41:34] the scripture says for whosoever is born
[1:41:37] of God
[1:41:38] overcometh the world
[1:41:40] and the foolish versions did not
[1:41:43] overcome the world
[1:41:45] this is the victory that overcometh the
[1:41:47] world even our faith
[1:41:51] now how can you have faith if you don't
[1:41:54] have the reveal word for your day
[1:41:58] Luther
[1:42:00] Wesley
[1:42:02] Pentecostals when the light of God was
[1:42:05] upon him that they had faith in that and
[1:42:08] everybody that had that it worked for
[1:42:11] them and God moves on
[1:42:14] now in order to have the faith of a
[1:42:17] Rapture is that right rapturing Faith
[1:42:19] you need a message that's going to give
[1:42:21] it to you
[1:42:22] and you gotta believe that message
[1:42:25] right the word of God it can't be just
[1:42:28] if that be the case now I don't know how
[1:42:30] God deals with everybody but I do say it
[1:42:33] like this it's not in my business
[1:42:35] it really isn't you know just like you
[1:42:38] know I think it was uh uh the servant of
[1:42:40] Elijah says Lord you know we all by
[1:42:43] ourselves you know no no there's seven
[1:42:46] thousand
[1:42:48] I think Elijah felt that way have it
[1:42:50] y'all know the scripture seven thousand
[1:42:52] that have not yet bowed down to Baal it
[1:42:55] wasn't his business
[1:42:57] God knew exactly who had out there
[1:43:01] that's what I'm saying you know whenever
[1:43:03] you get to a place you say well if you
[1:43:05] don't believe it exactly like this
[1:43:06] you're dead
[1:43:11] I'm closing
[1:43:13] you just messed up
[1:43:16] that's what happened to a lot of people
[1:43:17] in the message God would give them a
[1:43:19] revelation and I'm not saying the
[1:43:20] Revelation wasn't true but instead of
[1:43:23] incorporating your brothers you put them
[1:43:25] out
[1:43:26] you made your own little click your own
[1:43:28] little system
[1:43:29] and no sister now doing what dying
[1:43:33] their faith most of the systems in
[1:43:35] cancer this message has faded out and
[1:43:37] died
[1:43:38] why
[1:43:39] because they did the same thing
[1:43:42] that the Pentecostals and all the other
[1:43:44] ages did
[1:43:45] thank God for William Branham you know
[1:43:48] why I said like that he kept his arms
[1:43:50] open
[1:43:52] he never de-christianized anybody
[1:43:55] he kept his arms open
[1:43:58] because none of us know who true seed is
[1:44:01] only God knows we can look at the woman
[1:44:04] that came to you know uh Simon's house
[1:44:07] well wait wait wait wait a minute now
[1:44:09] she coming over here She's Not Our Kind
[1:44:10] hey but listen she was so much his car
[1:44:13] Jesus is kind he rebuked Simon and
[1:44:17] everybody else in the place
[1:44:19] see yeah
[1:44:21] yeah it's kind of don't tell me the
[1:44:23] devil can't bring you to Jesus yeah the
[1:44:25] devil can bring you to Jesus those
[1:44:27] Pharisees and everything brought that
[1:44:29] woman called an adultery to Jesus
[1:44:37] no doubt they were the same ones they
[1:44:39] were crying crucify him
[1:44:41] because he had exposed them they hated
[1:44:44] him
[1:44:45] and if you're a real Christian people
[1:44:48] gonna hate you
[1:44:50] they don't you don't even have to talk
[1:44:51] to them you can walk by them and they
[1:44:53] can tell that you know they got
[1:44:55] discernment they call it reading you I
[1:44:56] don't know what it is but I know one
[1:44:58] thing
[1:44:59] people know a real one
[1:45:02] I'm closing I'm not finished
[1:45:05] we're still going to be working with uh
[1:45:08] uh Church Without spot wrinkle of
[1:45:09] blemish because I just kind of hit some
[1:45:12] uh highlights but I wanna I wanna um
[1:45:15] maybe pull a few things I don't know how
[1:45:17] to how to teach uh the people
[1:45:21] when you know they're lacking the Holy
[1:45:23] Ghost
[1:45:25] you understand they're not they're not
[1:45:27] going to understand what you're saying
[1:45:28] you're trying to get it to him
[1:45:31] and you're hoping that somehow the Holy
[1:45:33] Ghost is going to come in and an anoint
[1:45:34] them anoint them you know maybe in
[1:45:36] service and and I you know I really
[1:45:38] don't I really when I say these things I
[1:45:42] want the church to hear me
[1:45:45] if God has put me here as the pastor I
[1:45:47] want them to hear me because this is
[1:45:49] what I see
[1:45:50] how can you say you got the Holy Ghost
[1:45:52] and you love God and don't show up
[1:45:55] no something's wrong with that picture
[1:45:59] am I judging you know the word because
[1:46:02] the Bible said when you see that day
[1:46:03] approaching come together in the morning
[1:46:05] that's right and brother Randall said a
[1:46:07] true Christians can't hardly wait to the
[1:46:08] doors of the house of God is open
[1:46:11] they're there now we all have
[1:46:13] circumstances that prevent us I'm not
[1:46:15] talking about that I'm talking about
[1:46:16] people who just went to b-bops laying at
[1:46:18] the house they're looking at TV drinking
[1:46:20] their pop and all that kind of crazy
[1:46:22] stuff
[1:46:26] they might even be looking at us online
[1:46:28] like they're at a theater or something
[1:46:32] listen that's a respect disrespectful
[1:46:35] too if you go look at Church online you
[1:46:38] need to dress up like you at church
