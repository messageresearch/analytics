[39:06] phone by brother Keith's uh son-in-law
[39:13] that I needed to come to the
[39:16] hospital that he had had a stroke that
[39:19] they believe.
[39:22] Well, we we rushed over there
[39:28] and uh they they I was the only one they
[39:31] would let back there outside of
[39:34] the family.
[39:42] But anyway, when I got back there,
[39:46] I I expected to
[39:48] see a man laying on the bed.
[39:53] dysfunctional,
[39:56] but he was not that
[39:59] way. He was excited.
[40:02] And I couldn't understand. I'm looking
[40:04] at a man. They said he had a
[40:09] stroke, but when you have a stroke,
[40:11] you're weak.
[40:13] And he was he was so strong, he grabbed
[40:16] my hand
[40:18] and he was so excited. He pulled
[40:21] me into himself or near his
[40:25] head and he said, "I love you, brother
[40:28] Brooks."
[40:30] And I said, "I love you too, brother
[40:32] Keith."
[40:34] And then he said something on this this
[40:37] wise.
[40:41] This
[40:44] is what's happening to me
[40:48] is what you preach this morning.
[40:53] For those of you who were here Sunday,
[40:56] I I preached going
[40:59] beyond this dimension.
[41:04] And I said to Keith, "No, no, no. You
[41:06] can't go now."
[41:08] I said, "We've got to take a rapture
[41:11] together." He grabbed my hands again.
[41:16] And all he didn't say this now,
[41:19] but I was in his way.
[41:22] So he pushed like
[41:24] this like, "Okay, you can go."
[41:29] Well, Sunday
[41:31] also Sunday
[41:33] passed. While I was preaching, I saw how
[41:36] that area was lit up where he was
[41:41] sitting and I I I remember looking up to
[41:44] see if there was an extra light
[41:47] there and it was not. So, I just kept on
[41:50] preaching.
[41:52] Now, all of these things came to me
[41:56] afterwards. About a month ago,
[41:59] maybe a little
[42:00] more. Brother Keith told me that he had
[42:03] a visitation from an angel
[42:08] and he also said that he had a out of
[42:10] body experience.
[42:14] So what I'm trying to tell
[42:16] you not only was he told his
[42:23] death he was excited.
[42:26] Even his wife and family said they had
[42:28] never seen anything like it.
[42:31] He was happy all the way to the end.
[42:36] At that time, they didn't know it was a
[42:38] brain cl or some kind of clot. I don't
[42:40] know whether it was brain or what,
[42:43] but we we do know it was a blood
[42:49] clot. And when the when it struck him,
[42:56] he looked over to his wife and says,
[42:57] "I'm sorry.
[43:00] And then he went on out
[43:04] in his will. He was not to be
[43:06] resuscitated.
[43:22] I am saddened. I am saddened
[43:27] because he was not only a friend, he was
[43:28] like a father and a brother.
[43:34] He helped me uh a great deal.
[43:38] But if some of you all know the story
[43:40] how we
[43:43] met in Lima at St. Rita's Hospital, I
[43:47] think it was
[43:48] there's my wife. But anyway, in the
[43:50] hospital, his mom was on hospice.
[43:55] She had cancer of the pancreas.
[43:59] And we prayed for her, Keith and I,
[44:03] and she was instantly healed.
[44:07] She got up and was dismissed the next
[44:09] day.
[44:12] I gave Keith his first church age book
[44:18] and from that point on he was traveling
[44:20] all the way from Iowa at times just to
[44:23] come to
[44:26] church in line.
[44:29] Prior to that, Brother Keith had already
[44:31] had a Bible study going on.
[44:34] [Music]
[44:36] Amen. Brother Rich was part of it.
[44:39] Brother Isaac, I believe. However,
[44:41] however it went, you know, he was that
[44:42] kind of person. He witnessed to
[44:44] everybody.
[44:48] Yeah.
[44:53] Anyway, there was a man by the name of
[44:55] Steven
[45:00] Stween that when the when the message
[45:03] began to roll this
[45:06] way, he
[45:08] we gave permission for them to contact
[45:12] him since he lived
[45:15] here to work with the
[45:18] church. and he worked with the church I
[45:20] believe for five years or so.
[45:24] Then he discovered that he didn't want
[45:25] to pastor
[45:29] and I didn't want to come to De Moine,
[45:32] but God sent me
[45:35] anyway. Long story
[45:37] short, and from then on, Brother
[45:40] Keith, we would meet with him almost
[45:42] every Friday
[45:45] for breakfast and with other brothers.
[45:49] We just had a friendship and an
[45:51] understanding.
[45:55] We disagreed at times,
[45:59] but we never had a falling out.
[46:03] We always remain Christians
[46:07] in our
[46:08] disagreements until God will give one or
[46:11] the other or
[46:15] both the spirit of forgive forgiveness,
[46:19] however you want to say it.
[46:22] But tomorrow we'll be preaching
[46:25] and his wife
[46:28] who pretty much was a stranger to us
[46:34] and that we didn't get much fellowship
[46:35] with
[46:38] her.
[46:42] Uh she invited us to her
[46:47] house. The family called me family, my
[46:50] wife and I.
[46:55] She looked me in my eyes and she told me
[46:57] she loved me.
[46:59] And some of y'all don't know the
[47:00] background, but that was victory.
[47:07] So pray for her name is Joyce.
[47:10] Amen. That God will open her eyes to
[47:13] this message.
[47:18] Amen. Thank you for those of
[47:21] you who who
[47:23] called, those of you who gave me a word
[47:26] of
[47:27] encouragement. This has been one of the
[47:29] toughest times of my life.
[47:34] And I appreciated the encouragement.
[47:38] Even Pinuel
[47:41] encouraged me this morning.
[47:44] That that girl is spiritual, brother.
[47:48] Something about her.
[47:51] So we thank God for his grace and his
[47:53] mercy.
[47:56] Hallelujah. Let's stand and we'll have
[47:57] the word of God.
[48:06] I know I'll miss him,
[48:10] but I'm so happy for him.
[48:13] That might sound strange,
[48:17] but I
[48:18] am. I said to the Lord,
[48:22] what did he do
[48:25] to make you to to to so you favored him
[48:31] and took him
[48:34] home? I know the I know the answer to
[48:38] that, but but I thank God for his grace
[48:40] and his
[48:42] mercy. For those who watched brother
[48:44] Keith,
[48:47] you know that uh he was getting weaker
[48:52] after CO. He never was the same in his
[48:56] body. Then he was hit with it
[49:00] again. Some of you all may have not
[49:02] known or seen
[49:04] it. But things were not going well for
[49:07] him in his physical body.
[49:11] One thing I love about this situation.
[49:16] He did not suffer
[49:19] and I thank God for that.
[49:22] Yes, Lord. Amen. As we stand, let us
[49:25] turn to St. John 8:23.
[49:34] What was so real about him? Excuse me,
[49:38] but being a white man,
[49:42] he loved me.
[49:47] My color made no difference.
[49:51] And
[49:52] his friends, many of
[49:56] them were wealthy people.
[50:00] But he never was ashamed of me,
[50:04] and I appreciate that about him.
[50:11] St. John 8:23-25.
[50:17] And he said unto
[50:18] them, "Ye are from Did I say that right?
[50:23] Ye are from beneath. I am from
[50:26] above. Ye are of this world. I am not of
[50:31] this world.
[50:37] I said therefore unto I say that said
[50:41] therefore unto you that ye shall die in
[50:44] your sins. For if you
[50:47] believe not that I am he, ye shall die
[50:52] in your sins.
[50:59] Then said they unto him, "Who art thou?"
[51:03] And Jesus said unto them, "Even the same
[51:07] that I said unto you from the
[51:10] beginning."
[51:19] St. John
[51:21] 6 28- 29
[51:41] Then say they unto him, "What shall we
[51:46] do that we might work the works of God?
[51:52] found yourself with the
[51:54] Jew. And Jesus answered and said unto
[51:57] them, "This is the work of God that you
[52:01] believe on him whom he hath
[52:08] sent." I tried to cut it down, but I
[52:10] don't know how well I did with
[52:12] that. I can't hardly breathe up here.
[52:15] It's so hot.
[52:17] Let us pray.
[52:19] Father God, we thank you for your grace
[52:21] and your
[52:22] mercy. We thank you for being so good to
[52:26] us.
[52:28] Lord, I know you call your son
[52:32] home. It's a beautiful
[52:35] situation. It's a journey that we all
[52:38] must
[52:39] take. But when I saw how excited he was
[52:43] about
[52:45] leaving, enthused about going,
[52:50] That's when I do know that the man had
[52:52] what he said he had.
[52:56] Lord, bless the saints of God
[52:59] here. Those who loved him and are broken
[53:02] in
[53:03] heart. I I pray that you would give them
[53:05] peace of mind. Comfort them in this time
[53:09] Lord of bereiement.
[53:11] Bless the service. Speak to our hearts.
[53:15] In your name Jesus Christ we pray.
[53:18] Amen. Amen. You may be seated.
[53:24] I'd like to entitle this message.
[53:29] This is the reality of Christ.
[53:34] As you know, the Bible calls us pilgrims
[53:36] and
[53:38] strangers. We We know that we're
[53:42] travelers. I got in my notes traveling
[53:45] from Earth to glory.
[53:49] But in reality, it's from glory to
[53:51] glory.
[53:53] Earth is just in the middle of it.
[53:57] Yes, sir. This time element that we're
[54:00] dealing with.
[54:04] Brother Random call it just a hick. Just
[54:06] a little
[54:08] hickey in in in time. Just a little drop
[54:12] uh in
[54:14] eternity. And and so we know that we're
[54:17] not here to stay,
[54:20] right? But the reality of Christ
[54:25] is throughout the whole Bible.
[54:28] Jesus Christ came to save.
[54:32] Not just a little bit. He came to save
[54:34] to the uttermost.
[54:38] But he told those Pharisees something.
[54:42] Except you believe that I am he.
[54:46] uh you shall likewise die in your sins.
[54:50] You got to understand that
[54:52] statement here. It was historically
[54:55] these Pharisees
[54:57] from generation to generation to
[54:59] generation.
[55:02] Amen. from Babylon all the way upon
[55:05] they they they they try to hold their
[55:08] traditions
[55:12] so that you'll know that the systems of
[55:14] the Pharisees and the Sadducees
[55:19] had adopted uh uh things from
[55:26] Babylon lost the feeling for the
[55:34] people. The synagogue
[55:37] became a place of debate
[55:41] and striving with the
[55:43] scripture to see who's right and who's
[55:48] wrong. So when Jesus came as a a little
[55:53] lad, I believe he was around 12 years
[55:56] old, here he was in the
[55:59] synagogue teaching them about the
[56:03] Christ, they marveled at his
[56:07] wisdom, and for those of you who heard
[56:11] uh the message there in Minnesota, here
[56:14] it
[56:15] was. Jesus trying to prove his
[56:19] supernatural
[56:22] birth. And here all of a sudden Mary
[56:25] comes
[56:26] and disrupted the whole thing
[56:29] uh by saying, "Joseph, your father and
[56:35] Ise, we were looking for you."
[56:39] Now, here's the thing. God always hides
[56:43] himself.
[56:46] He wants you to believe in him.
[56:49] And he said, "Except you believe that I
[56:51] am he, you shall likewise die in your
[56:54] sins."
[56:56] But then he hides himself.
[57:00] Everybody can't
[57:02] sin. Not even in this church
[57:05] world. Everybody do not see Jesus.
[57:10] Like the scripture says, we don't see
[57:12] all things.
[57:15] But we see Jesus.
[57:17] Maybe you you you you may not see a lot
[57:20] of miraculous things happening in your
[57:23] life, but one thing you need to be able
[57:26] to
[57:28] see is who Jesus
[57:31] is in your
[57:34] life. Hallelujah. Faith in itself is
[57:37] dimensional.
[57:40] You can't see it. You can't touch it.
[57:44] You can't smell it, but you can possess
[57:47] it.
[57:48] Hallelujah. It is more real.
[57:53] Excuse me. Excuse me. Some water,
[57:58] please. More real
[58:01] than the things that are visible.
[58:05] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. How many can say
[58:07] amen to that?
[58:09] Because the Bible says that things that
[58:12] are seen
[58:15] does not
[58:16] appear. It it is not because it's made
[58:19] from the unseen,
[58:23] right? I mean, we we we we we often go
[58:27] through our
[58:29] lives concentrating on the natural
[58:34] when we should be focusing on the
[58:36] supernatural.
[58:38] Because when you're born
[58:40] again, you're not born of this
[58:43] world. You're born of another world,
[58:47] another dimension.
[58:50] Hallelujah. Where angels become real.
[58:54] Hallelujah. The supernatural becomes
[58:58] natural. Let me say it again. Where
[59:00] angels become
[59:01] real. The supernatural becomes natural.
[59:07] It is so amazing
[59:12] that in the Old Testament,
[59:15] people who did not have Jesus Christ in
[59:17] them,
[59:20] they had him with
[59:22] them. But God visit him visited them
[59:26] with
[59:28] angels, an angel here, a angel there.
[59:32] They saw the
[59:34] supernatural. those who were true
[59:36] believers.
[59:38] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And now it's on
[59:40] record.
[59:43] That the God of of of Israel
[59:47] is the God of the bride.
[59:51] Jehovah of the
[59:52] old is Jesus Christ of the
[59:56] new. And one thing we do know, he does
[59:59] not
[1:00:00] change. This is the reality of Christ.
[1:00:03] He doesn't change and a lot of us can't
[1:00:06] experience it
[1:00:08] him because we don't that anointing is
[1:00:12] not there.
[1:00:14] The anointing is Christ. I want you to
[1:00:18] think about this. Jesus Christ was born
[1:00:22] the son of God. Is that right? He was
[1:00:25] able to do things even when he was a
[1:00:27] young fellow.
[1:00:30] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But he was not
[1:00:33] the anointed
[1:00:35] Messiah until the Holy Spirit came down
[1:00:38] on him
[1:00:41] and said, "This is my beloved son in
[1:00:45] whom I'm well pleased to dwell
[1:00:47] in." Y'all hear what I'm saying? It was
[1:00:50] then the fullness of the Godhead
[1:00:53] bodily dwelt in Jesus Christ.
[1:00:58] From that point on,
[1:01:00] demons
[1:01:02] trembled even at his presence.
[1:01:06] Now, if it's the same Holy Ghost, if
[1:01:09] it's the same
[1:01:11] Christ and you and I claim to have him
[1:01:14] on the
[1:01:15] inside, the demons are af or should be
[1:01:19] afraid of
[1:01:21] you like they were
[1:01:23] afraid of Jesus himself. Amen. Amen. You
[1:01:27] say, "Oh, brother." Paul, I know.
[1:01:31] Y'all know this the story of the sons
[1:01:34] ofKea.
[1:01:36] They tried to cast out devils.
[1:01:39] But those devils didn't know
[1:01:41] them. But the the devil know
[1:01:44] you. If you got the Holy Ghost, the
[1:01:48] devil know
[1:01:49] you. Why? Because that Holy Ghost is
[1:01:53] Christ. Remember I told you we cannot
[1:01:56] stay down here
[1:01:59] expecting to see a rapture.
[1:02:01] Hallelujah. We've got to come up. The
[1:02:04] mind of Christ must elevate himself in
[1:02:08] us. And the only way that will ever
[1:02:11] happen. We must yield to
[1:02:15] him is
[1:02:17] yielding is
[1:02:19] surrendering. Is getting out of God's
[1:02:21] way. That's what a gift
[1:02:24] is. Hallelujah. Hebrews 11
[1:02:29] 13-4 16, excuse me.
[1:02:33] I need y'all to pull on the gift. Don't
[1:02:35] make it harder for
[1:02:38] me. Hallelujah. Hebrews
[1:02:43] 11:13. Think about
[1:02:46] it. These people knew more about
[1:02:49] God than a lot of Christians do.
[1:02:54] That's right. They had a faith.
[1:02:58] Now, I don't even know why people say,
[1:03:00] "Well, Jesus wasn't real." Do you think
[1:03:02] disciple those disciples would have went
[1:03:05] to death
[1:03:07] over a fictitious story?
[1:03:09] No. He was real to them.
[1:03:13] Yeah, he was more real to them than the
[1:03:17] guillotine or or the lions in in in in
[1:03:20] in the circus.
[1:03:23] He was real to
[1:03:25] them. When they saw him as their battle
[1:03:28] act, that's what he
[1:03:29] was. When they saw him as as their
[1:03:32] defense, that's what he
[1:03:34] was. When they saw them as his their
[1:03:37] protector, that's what he was. There was
[1:03:40] no doubt
[1:03:42] whatsoever. See, when Christ comes in,
[1:03:47] the doubt has to go out.
[1:03:50] Praise God. Hallelujah. These all died
[1:03:53] in faith, not having received the
[1:03:57] promises, but having seen them a far
[1:04:00] off, and were persuaded of them, and
[1:04:04] embraced them, and confessed that they
[1:04:08] were what?
[1:04:10] strangers and pilgrims on the
[1:04:16] earth. And
[1:04:21] there and there is no way you can be a
[1:04:26] Christian and not be
[1:04:29] strange. Amen. The the Bible used the
[1:04:32] word peculiar,
[1:04:34] but it's still
[1:04:36] strange. And the reason why we're
[1:04:40] strained is because we designed to hear
[1:04:43] the voice of God.
[1:04:46] Hallelujah. You could be standing right
[1:04:48] by me. Or I could be standing right by
[1:04:51] you and God can speak to me and you
[1:04:55] won't hear him or he can speak to you
[1:04:58] and I won't hear him because we are on
[1:05:01] different frequencies.
[1:05:04] Hallelujah. We are living on a higher
[1:05:08] plane of all of this
[1:05:11] confusion. So much so this this day is
[1:05:15] called Satan
[1:05:17] Eden. This is
[1:05:19] Babylon. This is the darkest of all
[1:05:22] ages. Hallelujah. But in this
[1:05:25] time God has
[1:05:27] sheep and he said my sheep hearth my
[1:05:31] voice and a stranger they won't follow.
[1:05:35] Can y'all hear what I'm saying? You
[1:05:37] don't even know how blessed you are that
[1:05:40] you can hear this message that God sent
[1:05:44] by Malachi 4. Hallelujah. Many of people
[1:05:48] are not on the frequency. They can't
[1:05:51] hear it. They can't understand it.
[1:05:54] Hallelujah. And when you can see serpent
[1:05:56] seed, you have no idea. You're on
[1:06:00] another frequency.
[1:06:02] You're able to hear the voice of
[1:06:05] God. That's why Paul said, "We are now
[1:06:09] sitting in heavenly places in Christ
[1:06:12] Jesus. You may not understand it, but
[1:06:16] right now I stand here." Hallelujah. on
[1:06:19] earth. But there is a representation of
[1:06:23] me. There's a representation of you
[1:06:26] that's in another dimension. Hallelujah.
[1:06:30] And that angel stands before the throne
[1:06:33] of God. And when he hears something
[1:06:36] concerning you, he comes down and
[1:06:39] whispers in your ear. Hallelujah. That's
[1:06:44] how come we know things and we don't
[1:06:46] know why we know them.
[1:06:51] Hallelujah.
[1:06:53] That's the reality of Christ. That's the
[1:06:55] reality of the anointing. When you are
[1:06:58] anointed in Christ, God said, did
[1:07:01] nothing. He said, I'm going to show you
[1:07:04] all the things that the Father revealed
[1:07:06] to me. I'm going to reveal them to
[1:07:10] you. Somebody help me here. See, this is
[1:07:13] what I
[1:07:14] love. God could have taken Keith
[1:07:17] anytime, but he prepared him.
[1:07:22] And the reason why he said to his wife,
[1:07:25] "Sorry, because I think she was trying
[1:07:27] to get him to the
[1:07:29] hospital." And he wasn't so stirred
[1:07:31] about what she wanted to do with that.
[1:07:34] So, they had a little something going on
[1:07:36] there, but God was rich in
[1:07:39] mercy. God must have quickened him just
[1:07:41] at that moment of time to say, "Honey,
[1:07:44] I'm
[1:07:45] sorry." Y'all understand me? God is good
[1:07:48] to us. Hallelujah.
[1:07:51] Let me keep reading it. These all died
[1:07:53] in faith, not having received the
[1:07:55] promises, but have seen them a far off
[1:07:58] and were persuaded of them and embraced
[1:08:03] them. Confess that they were strangers
[1:08:06] and pilgrims on the
[1:08:09] earth.
[1:08:11] Hallelujah. For they for they that say
[1:08:14] such things declare plainly that they
[1:08:17] seek a country.
[1:08:21] This is not my
[1:08:23] home. I'm not trying to make it my home.
[1:08:26] I got to keep my eyes on that
[1:08:30] city. No, no matter what Abraham went
[1:08:33] through.
[1:08:35] Hallelujah. He said, I'm looking for a
[1:08:37] city whose builder and maker is
[1:08:40] God. Like brother said, when Abraham
[1:08:44] ended his
[1:08:45] journey, he said the city was just above
[1:08:48] him.
[1:08:49] Hallelujah. He had he doesn't have to
[1:08:52] search for it anymore. He's there.
[1:08:55] Somewhere in that
[1:08:57] dimension. You say, "Well, what do you
[1:08:59] mean, brother?" Jesus says, "According I
[1:09:02] don't want to go." Jesus said according
[1:09:04] to the word I go away to prepare a place
[1:09:07] for
[1:09:08] you that where I am there you might be
[1:09:12] so
[1:09:13] hallelujah and truly 15th verse if they
[1:09:18] had been mindful of that country from
[1:09:21] which they came out they may have had
[1:09:24] opportunity to have returned
[1:09:33] Amen. But now they desire a better
[1:09:36] country. I don't know about you
[1:09:40] with this world right here.
[1:09:42] I desire a better country
[1:09:45] that is an heavenly Wait a minute.
[1:09:50] A heavenly country
[1:09:53] where God is not ashamed to call to be
[1:09:56] called their God.
[1:10:01] Listen to the scripture. Wherefore God
[1:10:04] is not ashamed to be called their God.
[1:10:09] For he had, it doesn't say we have.
[1:10:15] He one prepared for them a city.
[1:10:21] Then Jesus must be God.
[1:10:25] He said, "I go away." He didn't say we.
[1:10:28] He said, "I I'm going in a way to
[1:10:31] prepare a place for you that where I am,
[1:10:36] there ye might be also."
[1:10:39] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So even so, in
[1:10:43] the Old Testament when they looked for
[1:10:44] him, they didn't understand and didn't
[1:10:47] know his name. Hallelujah. But they
[1:10:50] understood that God was the one who's
[1:10:53] building a city.
[1:10:55] Hallelujah. Amen. Is that right? Abraham
[1:10:59] met Mazdc.
[1:11:01] Hallelujah. And since he met after he
[1:11:04] met Mazdc,
[1:11:06] he was never the same.
[1:11:10] Hallelujah. And I'm going tell you
[1:11:12] something. Once you meet this
[1:11:15] MCDC, you'll never be the
[1:11:17] same. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. He prepared
[1:11:21] a place. See, even today, people are
[1:11:24] still questioning
[1:11:27] And you know, I always think you don't
[1:11:29] hear hardly anybody talking about Allah
[1:11:31] and Buddha and but you
[1:11:36] mention Jesus stir up
[1:11:39] Hollywood. So you you know he's
[1:11:43] right. When you tell people you love
[1:11:46] Jesus Christ is the Lord and in
[1:11:49] Hollywood, you stir up that harness
[1:11:52] nest.
[1:11:53] Hallelujah. cuz you know what that is.
[1:11:59] Oh my goodness. You say, "Well, what do
[1:12:01] you mean, brother Brooks?" We know what
[1:12:03] that is. Brother Vanam said, "Those
[1:12:06] Antalubian
[1:12:07] demons when they left out of the
[1:12:10] Euphrates, they landed in Hollywood."
[1:12:14] Hallelujah. So those demons are still
[1:12:17] there. I don't know why people are so
[1:12:21] surprised about what they doing
[1:12:24] there. The activities
[1:12:27] they're doing the same thing they did
[1:12:30] before the antluvian world. Hallelujah.
[1:12:33] One is not more evil than the other.
[1:12:36] They all devils.
[1:12:39] Oh my goodness. They're not even afraid
[1:12:42] to say they're selling their souls.
[1:12:46] You know what I'm to the devil. What
[1:12:49] y'all need to do is give your
[1:12:51] soul to
[1:12:53] God and be proud of it.
[1:12:56] There's no shame in being a Christian.
[1:13:00] Hallelujah. We're here today to prove
[1:13:04] that Jesus Christ still
[1:13:07] lives. Amen. Hallelujah. Matthew 16.
[1:13:11] Like I said, people are still
[1:13:13] debating
[1:13:15] Jesus. Some says he was just a coetan
[1:13:19] son. Some say he was a fake. Even Jews
[1:13:22] are still saying he was a fake.
[1:13:27] Yeah. That's that's willfully wanting to
[1:13:29] be blind.
[1:13:31] But when
[1:13:32] you see people who are atheists
[1:13:36] and they say it's just a a matter a
[1:13:39] figment of your
[1:13:41] imagination, just another religion,
[1:13:45] but remember what Jesus told those
[1:13:48] Pharisees who have grown up
[1:13:52] in the
[1:13:53] word. The prophet God said those
[1:13:56] Pharisees could just stick a finger
[1:13:59] anywhere and tell you what what was
[1:14:01] being said.
[1:14:06] I flip through my Bible and sometime
[1:14:08] like where is
[1:14:13] Nehemiah? Y'all understand me? Y'all
[1:14:15] laughing? But it's true.
[1:14:18] And the thing about it, these people
[1:14:20] were so apt in the scripture. They had
[1:14:22] scrolls.
[1:14:24] not pages like we have.
[1:14:27] But then Jesus said, "Except you believe
[1:14:30] that I am he."
[1:14:33] So it doesn't matter how much you can
[1:14:36] quote the scripture, how much you can
[1:14:38] quote the prophet, you must be born
[1:14:42] again. That's it.
[1:14:45] It's so simple to me. But we make it so
[1:14:48] complicated.
[1:14:51] Yeah. We Oh, if you don't believe the
[1:14:53] thunders,
[1:14:55] if you're not in Peruia,
[1:14:57] come on. We're in Christ.
[1:15:01] Hallelujah. And if you're in Christ,
[1:15:03] you're in the thunders.
[1:15:05] You're in Peruia. Whatever you want to
[1:15:07] call it. I think people just you become
[1:15:11] phariseic.
[1:15:14] We we t for t
[1:15:16] and we fail to see the kingdom of God is
[1:15:21] joy is peace is
[1:15:24] righteousness in the Holy Ghost.
[1:15:28] It ain't your doctrine.
[1:15:31] You could be ignorant as a rock
[1:15:35] and you have Jesus on the inside. That's
[1:15:38] all that matters.
[1:15:40] Hallelujah. Amen. Matthew 16:13-19
[1:15:45] again when Jesus came into the coast of
[1:15:48] Cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples
[1:15:51] saying whom do men say that I the son of
[1:15:53] man am
[1:16:01] now this sound like a a question that
[1:16:04] sounds like okay brothers we're beyond
[1:16:05] that but I want you to understand what
[1:16:08] they're saying
[1:16:08] here and they say some say that thou art
[1:16:12] John the Baptist, some Elias, and others
[1:16:17] Jeremiah,
[1:16:20] or one of the other prophets.
[1:16:25] Ain't that amazing?
[1:16:29] Because even in their perception,
[1:16:33] they couldn't go beyond the Old
[1:16:35] Testament.
[1:16:38] They know there's no such thing as
[1:16:40] reincarnation.
[1:16:44] But some of these Jews are believing
[1:16:46] that the Christ has
[1:16:49] reincarnated
[1:16:51] himself and John the Baptist or Elias or
[1:16:56] Jeremiah or one of the other
[1:16:59] prophets and they failed to
[1:17:02] see y'all hear what I'm saying? They
[1:17:04] fail to see
[1:17:06] Jesus. That's why he asked the
[1:17:09] question and he said unto them, "But
[1:17:12] whom say ye that I am?" Now, I'm asking
[1:17:15] all y'all this morning. Who do you say
[1:17:18] Jesus Christ is? Oh, you say, "Oh, he's
[1:17:22] a message." Well, which one?
[1:17:26] Amen.
[1:17:28] Which one?
[1:17:31] Amen. Let's break. It's the truth. Oh, I
[1:17:34] believe the message, but which one?
[1:17:38] Because there have been so many
[1:17:40] offshoots from the original message.
[1:17:44] Hallelujah. You better know what you
[1:17:46] believe in.
[1:17:48] Hallelujah. And I don't care how deep a
[1:17:51] church get in their
[1:17:53] doctrine. If they don't believe in the
[1:17:55] Holy Ghost, they're not in the message.
[1:18:01] That's right. Amen. That's the truth.
[1:18:05] The Holy Ghost. So much so, Brother
[1:18:07] Brandham called this
[1:18:10] message Holy Ghost message. Go look it
[1:18:13] up.
[1:18:16] Hallelujah. And we've done just what
[1:18:18] everybody else has
[1:18:19] done. We're beyond Pentecost
[1:18:24] in
[1:18:26] theory. Come on. But when you get beyond
[1:18:30] Pentecost, you're going to do what
[1:18:32] Jesus.
[1:18:34] Y'all hear what I'm saying? The word is
[1:18:38] coming up to the word. It's two
[1:18:40] different things.
[1:18:42] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:18:44] The Pentecostals of Isuzu Street were
[1:18:48] beyond the Methodists
[1:18:50] because they expressed it.
[1:18:53] It was an expression. It was a
[1:18:56] vindication.
[1:18:57] And this message is not intellectual.
[1:19:01] It's
[1:19:02] life. The life of Christ in you, the
[1:19:06] life of Christ in me. Hallelujah. So
[1:19:10] much brother, he kept preaching. These
[1:19:12] signs shall follow them that
[1:19:14] believe. These signs shall follow them
[1:19:17] that
[1:19:18] believe. Hallelujah. Many people think
[1:19:21] they believe when they
[1:19:24] don't. It is what it is. Say,
[1:19:27] hallelujah.
[1:19:28] You love the Lord. Whom do men say? Whom
[1:19:32] but whom do you say that I am?
[1:19:35] And I'm I'm not I'm just dwelling on
[1:19:37] this just a little bit.
[1:19:40] What What did Simon, thou art the
[1:19:42] Christ? Jump to the 18th verse. And I
[1:19:44] say also unto thee, thou art Peter. Why?
[1:19:48] Because Peter responded, I'm sorry, 16th
[1:19:52] verse. and and and Simon Peter answered
[1:19:54] and said, "Thou art the Christ, the son
[1:19:56] of the living
[1:19:59] God." Do y'all understand what what he
[1:20:01] was saying there? Basically, he was
[1:20:03] saying, "You're God."
[1:20:06] Because in in in in the
[1:20:09] understanding of the Jewish people, when
[1:20:11] the Messiah come, he will be God.
[1:20:14] He'll be God in the flesh.
[1:20:17] Oh Lord, I feel like I'm climbing a
[1:20:20] hill. But nevertheless,
[1:20:23] This is the reality. I don't care. You
[1:20:27] got to understand your church energy
[1:20:28] ain't going to do you no good.
[1:20:32] I don't want nobody to be deceived.
[1:20:35] You could pay your tithe. You be you
[1:20:38] could be a deacon, a preacher, a usher,
[1:20:40] whatever. Musician, but without the
[1:20:44] Christ without God in you.
[1:20:48] I'm not. Oh, I felt him. Oh. Uhhuh. You
[1:20:52] can feel it, but you need to know where
[1:20:54] that feeling coming
[1:20:56] from. Huh? The devil can give you good
[1:20:59] feelings. Y'all hear me? Oh, you say,
[1:21:02] "Well, I was out in the flow dancing. I
[1:21:03] used to dance out there in the flow when
[1:21:05] I was in the world. Did you feel good? I
[1:21:08] felt super. I felt great. But that
[1:21:11] wasn't the Holy Ghost." Somebody help me
[1:21:14] here. It's the truth. is when you know
[1:21:17] that a change has taken place in your
[1:21:21] life. A change. And that's just the
[1:21:24] beginning. We're trying to mature. We
[1:21:26] want God to mature us. You you you got
[1:21:29] You can't do it. But we know that that
[1:21:32] life is in us. As long as that rain and
[1:21:34] that sunshine, all those seasons hit it,
[1:21:37] it's going to grow.
[1:21:41] Hallelujah. Glory to God. You love the
[1:21:43] Lord. Jesus Christ is still a mystery.
[1:21:47] There's so many people who don't even
[1:21:49] know whether they got it or not. So if
[1:21:51] you don't know whether you have it or
[1:21:52] not, it's still a mystery to you.
[1:21:55] Hallelujah. Why you say that? Because
[1:21:58] Jesus said in that day you will know.
[1:22:02] I'm in the Father. The Father's in me
[1:22:03] and I am in you. You say, "Well,
[1:22:06] brother, can't you get a little deeper?
[1:22:07] I don't think this you can get no deeper
[1:22:10] than the Holy Ghost because without it
[1:22:14] you can have all the that's what Paul
[1:22:16] says you can understand all
[1:22:19] mysteries and have not the Holy Spirit
[1:22:22] it profits you nothing
[1:22:27] I don't want to just know
[1:22:29] mysteries what that going to do for me
[1:22:32] it'll excite me yeah but I don't want to
[1:22:35] be reading somebody else's
[1:22:38] matter. You understand me? This Bible is
[1:22:42] mine and you got to claim it as your own
[1:22:45] when it speaks it speaks to
[1:22:47] me. It it speaks to you when you claim
[1:22:50] it as your
[1:22:51] own. See, Jesus Christ is still a
[1:22:53] mystery to the church
[1:22:55] world. They claim to know
[1:22:58] him. Do they really know him?
[1:23:02] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. They're
[1:23:05] still debating.
[1:23:08] Sometimes even in church, we preach a
[1:23:11] word and we'll go out there and we'll
[1:23:14] debate.
[1:23:16] I know it used to be. I don't know how
[1:23:17] things are
[1:23:18] now, but my point
[1:23:21] is when fa you need to see what you're
[1:23:27] doing. Revelation is given by
[1:23:32] God. And you can debate all you want
[1:23:34] with
[1:23:35] somebody who can't see the revelation
[1:23:38] like you
[1:23:40] do. And your debating with them is not
[1:23:43] going to make them
[1:23:45] see. The mature way of getting next to a
[1:23:48] person or getting a person to
[1:23:52] see it's like Elijah Lord open their
[1:23:55] eyes. If you really got the truth
[1:23:58] revelation of the
[1:24:00] word, you don't beat a person on the
[1:24:03] head. You don't separate your family for
[1:24:06] it.
[1:24:08] Hallelujah. This is the reality of
[1:24:10] Christ by one spirit. We are baptized
[1:24:13] into one body. Hallelujah. And the body
[1:24:17] of Jesus Christ is not divided.
[1:24:21] Amen.
[1:24:22] Amen. I know it sound elementary, but
[1:24:24] there's so many of us that need we need
[1:24:27] the Holy
[1:24:29] Ghost. We need it. And I can't give it
[1:24:32] to you. God will, but you got to believe
[1:24:35] he
[1:24:36] will. If you're always doubting in your
[1:24:38] mind, can I say
[1:24:41] this? You'll never be
[1:24:44] worthy. If you get on your knees
[1:24:46] thinking because I'm praying, that's
[1:24:49] going to make me worthy. You are
[1:24:52] deceived. You can pray 24 hours a
[1:24:56] day. You'll never be worthy to receive
[1:24:58] the Holy
[1:25:00] Spirit. If that be the case, it becomes
[1:25:03] works. And it's not works. It's a
[1:25:07] gift. So you come to God just as I
[1:25:12] am. Just as I
[1:25:15] am. No, I'm not worthy, Lord. I'm not
[1:25:19] worthy to even call upon your name. But
[1:25:21] God, you promise. I like that. You
[1:25:25] promise me the Holy Ghost.
[1:25:28] Hallelujah. And the only way I can get
[1:25:31] it is that you give it to me.
[1:25:34] Hallelujah. It's promised. You promised
[1:25:38] in Acts
[1:25:39] 2:38. Is that right? Repent. Be baptized
[1:25:43] in the name of Jesus Christ. You receive
[1:25:45] the gift of the Holy Ghost. But you
[1:25:48] don't stop there. It goes on and on from
[1:25:52] glory to glory to glory. What are you
[1:25:55] saying, Brother Brooks? I don't want
[1:25:58] this church to be a
[1:26:01] church. I want to see this church. Be
[1:26:04] the bride of Christ.
[1:26:08] We can be religious,
[1:26:11] but the reality of Christ is power. this
[1:26:15] authority after which the Holy Ghost has
[1:26:17] come upon you, you shall receive power.
[1:26:23] He said, "Brothers, why you keep
[1:26:24] preaching on the Holy Ghost?" Cuz
[1:26:26] brother Brandon said, "Whatever you
[1:26:27] preach on, that's what you going to
[1:26:29] get."
[1:26:32] Hallelujah. And I know if I keep
[1:26:34] preaching it, it's going to strike
[1:26:36] somebody.
[1:26:38] All I need is one person. All I need is
[1:26:41] one true convert.
[1:26:43] Hallelujah. And it'll spread like
[1:26:45] wildfire.
[1:26:48] Hallelujah. It's the truth.
[1:26:52] Thank you, Lord.
[1:26:55] It doesn't mean you're going to be
[1:26:56] jumping up and down all the time, but
[1:26:59] one thing, it will give you, love for
[1:27:02] your brethren.
[1:27:07] Matthew Matthew 11:25.
[1:27:16] You love the Lord. I'm telling you these
[1:27:19] things because the pressure is coming.
[1:27:25] Y'all think it's hard now?
[1:27:30] No.
[1:27:32] It's going to get harder.
[1:27:37] But even brother Rich found a quote
[1:27:42] where brother said before
[1:27:46] they they they they start the system
[1:27:49] where you can't buy or sell.
[1:27:53] He said the bride of Jesus Christ will
[1:27:55] be
[1:27:56] gone before.
[1:27:59] So if you hear when they do that
[1:28:02] somewhere you've missed the boat.
[1:28:08] Everybody's waiting on that buy and
[1:28:11] sell.
[1:28:13] If you ain't doing good now, how you
[1:28:14] figure you going to do good later?
[1:28:17] Samson did bad for a long
[1:28:21] time so bad to they puncture his eyes
[1:28:25] out, burn him out.
[1:28:29] And all he could say is, "Oh Lord, once
[1:28:31] more.
[1:28:34] Brother, use that word
[1:28:37] possibility. There's a
[1:28:39] possibility that he'll hear me
[1:28:41] again. There's a possibility he will
[1:28:44] answer my prayer.
[1:28:46] Hallelujah. Don't ever give up on
[1:28:50] God cuz God will never give up on you.
[1:28:54] You're the bride of Christ, right?
[1:28:57] Verse 25. At that time Jesus answered
[1:29:01] and said, "I thank thee, oh Father, Lord
[1:29:04] of heaven and earth, because thou has
[1:29:07] hid these things from the wise and the
[1:29:10] prudent, and have revealed them unto
[1:29:21] babes." Amen. Hallelujah. Let me tell
[1:29:24] y'all something. The devil is so shrewd.
[1:29:29] He will blow his spirit of unbelief on
[1:29:31] you
[1:29:33] and you will think you see him when you
[1:29:35] don't see
[1:29:38] blind. Thinking you
[1:29:40] see you say what are you saying? The
[1:29:44] woman at the
[1:29:45] well. She said I know that when the
[1:29:48] Messiah come, he's going to do these
[1:29:52] things. She had the right vibration.
[1:29:56] You understand me? She had ears to hear.
[1:29:59] But then the Pharisees says, "No, he is
[1:30:03] of Bea."
[1:30:06] I'mma use the same thing that this note
[1:30:08] that brother Joseph used. I loved it.
[1:30:13] He said, "Chosi." I better put that last
[1:30:16] name on there.
[1:30:19] There's a lot of Josephs. But the point
[1:30:21] he said, which was so wonderful to me,
[1:30:26] he said, "Here was
[1:30:28] Jesus born in Bethlehem, Judea."
[1:30:33] God takes him from Bethlehem, Judea.
[1:30:36] Brings him down to
[1:30:38] Egypt to fulfill the
[1:30:40] word. I will call my son out of
[1:30:45] Egypt. From Egypt, he goes to
[1:30:48] Nazareth. And the whole time he's
[1:30:51] setting a
[1:30:52] platform to blind the Jews
[1:30:56] to who Jesus was.
[1:30:59] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You understand
[1:31:02] me? Because there was no prophet that
[1:31:05] was to was to come out of
[1:31:08] Nazareth. So much so they said could any
[1:31:12] good thing come out of Nazareth.
[1:31:15] Think about it. Out of all the
[1:31:19] virgins, Jesus picked a virgin,
[1:31:23] God picked a virgin
[1:31:26] that was already
[1:31:28] engaged, a
[1:31:30] spouse to another
[1:31:32] man. Hallelujah. And then she gets
[1:31:36] pregnant.
[1:31:39] And you would have been there. You would
[1:31:40] have thought the same way. There ain't
[1:31:42] no way.
[1:31:45] No
[1:31:46] way that this could be
[1:31:49] so that's Joseph's baby or somebody's
[1:31:52] baby.
[1:31:55] Y'all hear me? So and it it it went that
[1:31:57] way for a long time. So much they said
[1:32:00] to Jesus, we be not born of
[1:32:03] fornication. So the rumor still
[1:32:06] lived and that blinded the Jews because
[1:32:10] because there was not to be a prophet.
[1:32:14] coming out of Nazareth.
[1:32:19] Hallelujah. Let me let me say it like
[1:32:21] this. That's what blinds our
[1:32:25] world. It's not written that a prophet
[1:32:29] would come out of America.
[1:32:32] Hallelujah. Yeah. And then what God did,
[1:32:36] his his grand his mother was a habreed
[1:32:39] of some sort and his daddy was a
[1:32:42] drunkard.
[1:32:44] Hallelujah. It blinded the people.
[1:32:48] And here he was an uneducated
[1:32:51] man. Hallelujah. In an educated
[1:32:55] world. Hallelujah. Is that all right? It
[1:32:59] blinded the people. Hallelujah. But they
[1:33:03] asked
[1:33:04] Jesus, "What are the works that we must
[1:33:07] do to inherit eternal life?" And the
[1:33:11] scripture says, "Believe on him who I
[1:33:15] have sent." And God sent a prophet in
[1:33:18] this day. And we must believe on that
[1:33:22] prophet. Hallelujah. That's only works
[1:33:25] God called for you. Because everything
[1:33:28] else is grace. Praise grace grace.
[1:33:32] Hallelujah. People don't understand it,
[1:33:36] but this is the reality of Christ.
[1:33:39] You couldn't Who was Noah? Noah was
[1:33:42] Christ for his day.
[1:33:45] Hallelujah. And if you didn't follow
[1:33:47] Noah, you didn't get on the boat.
[1:33:50] Hallelujah. Who was Moses? Moses was
[1:33:54] Christ for his day. Hallelujah. And if
[1:33:57] you didn't follow Moses,
[1:34:00] hallelujah, didn't come out of Egypt.
[1:34:03] Somebody help me here. And that's why
[1:34:05] when Jesus came on the scene, he said,
[1:34:08] "Except you believe that I am he, you
[1:34:11] should likewise die in your
[1:34:13] sins." Then God slipped in a
[1:34:16] prophet. Hallelujah. in the Gentile age.
[1:34:21] There's nowhere in the scripture that
[1:34:23] says that the Gentiles will ever have a
[1:34:27] prophet. But God sent us Malachi 4.
[1:34:30] Y'all better hear what I'm saying. And
[1:34:33] except you believe in him, you shall
[1:34:36] likewise die in your
[1:34:38] sins. Glory to God. That's the word of
[1:34:41] God. That's how Christ works. But it
[1:34:45] doesn't stop there. God has a bride
[1:34:48] who's resounding the word of Malachi
[1:34:52] 4. Except you believe in the bride,
[1:34:57] you shall likewise die your sin.
[1:35:00] Hallelujah. Because we're carrying the
[1:35:02] same
[1:35:05] message. Hallelujah. You know, God makes
[1:35:08] us strange like
[1:35:10] that. You're strangers.
[1:35:13] Hallelujah. People say, "Oh, y'all a
[1:35:16] cult."
[1:35:18] Well, if we was a cult, so was
[1:35:22] Jesus. Jesus Jesus had 12
[1:35:25] disciples. Many of them lost their job,
[1:35:27] quit their jobs, and everything to
[1:35:30] follow Jesus. Come on, somebody. Don't
[1:35:32] get quiet. We're not a cult. Many
[1:35:36] churches
[1:35:37] are there. Baptist cults, Methodist
[1:35:40] cults. Whatever you br you you it is
[1:35:46] but not the bride of Jesus. Hallelujah.
[1:35:49] She has one husband.
[1:35:51] There's only one who rules her and
[1:35:54] that's the Lord Jesus Christ. Y'all
[1:35:57] better hear what I'm saying. She's led
[1:36:00] by his spirit, not the spirit of a man,
[1:36:04] not the spirit of a church. She's led by
[1:36:07] his spirit. Come on, somebody. When
[1:36:10] brother Brandham, he could have been any
[1:36:13] a part of anybody's church. They would
[1:36:16] have loved to have him. He would have
[1:36:18] brought millions into their
[1:36:20] organization.
[1:36:22] But he didn't believe he didn't belong
[1:36:23] to nobody but Jesus. He was quite
[1:36:26] strange.
[1:36:28] Is that right? Why was he strange?
[1:36:30] Because he was a stranger. He was a
[1:36:32] pilgrim just like you are.
[1:36:35] Hallelujah. You mean to tell me you got
[1:36:38] a flight to catch? And the Holy Spirit
[1:36:41] is talking to you and tell you to keep
[1:36:45] walking. Think about it. Keep walking.
[1:36:49] And he's walking into the colored area.
[1:36:52] Oh, come on, somebody. Y'all, the
[1:36:54] reality of that, if I was a white man
[1:36:58] walking through the colored area in that
[1:36:59] time and
[1:37:01] day, I would have been singing, "I'm so
[1:37:03] glad I'm one of them, too."
[1:37:08] There's a human element in there.
[1:37:12] But he was he he knew he had to follow
[1:37:14] the
[1:37:15] spirit. And when it came to this old
[1:37:18] mother, she was resting. I can see it
[1:37:21] right in my head right now. Resting on
[1:37:24] the fence. And when he came by, she
[1:37:28] says, "How
[1:37:29] param." He said, "How do you know I'm a
[1:37:32] par?" He said, "Cuz the Lord done showed
[1:37:35] me." Hallelujah. See, that's what I'm
[1:37:37] talking about. Elevating yourself into a
[1:37:42] place where you can hear the voice of
[1:37:44] God. Here it was. Here it was. Her son
[1:37:48] had a social disease. And
[1:37:51] she knew he was going to die.
[1:37:54] Hallelujah. She didn't care about his
[1:37:57] dying. She just wanted him to die saved.
[1:38:01] Somebody help me here. See, I have
[1:38:03] children that go away with it.
[1:38:06] Those things don't bother me. The only
[1:38:08] thing I want to see them save.
[1:38:11] Hallelujah. I want Christ in their
[1:38:14] lives.
[1:38:15] Hallelujah. And I'm waiting on it.
[1:38:18] Hallelujah. I believe it and I'm waiting
[1:38:20] on it. Hallelujah. One thing about it,
[1:38:25] Brother said, when that old auntie
[1:38:28] prayed, he said, you know, she had
[1:38:30] talked to God before. Amen. That's what
[1:38:33] I'm talking about. You ask somebody to
[1:38:36] pray, you can tell whether they done
[1:38:37] them prayed to God before. Hallelujah.
[1:38:40] God is so good. Y'all see what I'm
[1:38:42] saying? That's the reality of Christ.
[1:38:45] The reality of Christ is that he'll have
[1:38:48] you doing strange
[1:38:50] things. People will look at you like
[1:38:52] you're
[1:38:53] crazy. Hallelujah. Like building a boat
[1:38:56] on a
[1:38:58] mountain. Hallelujah. And that's what he
[1:39:01] called Noah to do. There was no water,
[1:39:05] but Noah built it.
[1:39:08] Hallelujah. Because God told him,
[1:39:11] and whether the whether scientists know
[1:39:13] know this or not, but his boat, that ark
[1:39:17] was better than the Titanic.
[1:39:20] Hallelujah. Not only was it better, it
[1:39:24] was bigger.
[1:39:27] Somebody help me here. You said, "Well,
[1:39:29] brother, what are you saying?"
[1:39:31] See, God will tell you to do some
[1:39:32] strange
[1:39:33] things, and I I told y'all one time, God
[1:39:37] said, "Get up, brother. $50."
[1:39:41] I said, "Lord, that's all I have." And
[1:39:43] he said, "That's all I asked
[1:39:48] for." It sound like a joke, but it
[1:39:51] happened. Shortly after that, I received
[1:39:54] $500 in the mail from somebody I didn't
[1:39:58] even know, they said they heard me
[1:40:00] online and was blessed by the message
[1:40:03] and they sent me $500.
[1:40:06] Amen. Thank you, Lord. Let me tell y'all
[1:40:10] something. You You be like the woman
[1:40:12] where the meal will never run out. You
[1:40:15] give God first
[1:40:17] and you'll be surprised how the money
[1:40:19] flows.
[1:40:21] See the problem with with us, we don't
[1:40:23] understand the mathematics of God.
[1:40:26] Hallelujah. I can see that old lady with
[1:40:28] those two mice coming. That's all she
[1:40:31] got is two mice. We don't know how old
[1:40:33] she was. We don't even know how long she
[1:40:36] lived after
[1:40:37] them. But she put in two
[1:40:41] mites and she got eternal
[1:40:43] life. and then was put in the the uh the
[1:40:47] book of fame. God's book of fame. Y'all
[1:40:51] hear what I'm saying?
[1:40:53] How crazy would you be?
[1:40:56] You done lost the axe. You done lost a
[1:40:59] axe head. How how it goes? You You done
[1:41:03] Oh, I can't. But anyway, God
[1:41:05] God and you throw a rock or something
[1:41:08] and y'all know a stick, whatever it was
[1:41:10] and then the axe head float if we saw.
[1:41:13] Amen.
[1:41:15] Brother Bam,
[1:41:17] throw up.
[1:41:21] And all of a sudden, he throws up the
[1:41:22] sand or whatever it was.
[1:41:25] And here come the pillar of
[1:41:27] fire whirling
[1:41:29] down. And he tells everybody,
[1:41:32] "Duck, I was there. Not there, but
[1:41:36] there. I went to that place and that
[1:41:39] place at the time looked like the very
[1:41:41] hill of Goltha.
[1:41:45] I've been to Israel and I was there. And
[1:41:48] where those three crosses was formed in
[1:41:51] the mountain, I seen for myself.
[1:41:54] Like I told y'all before, I had a few
[1:41:56] pyramid rocks back in the day.
[1:42:00] But Christians, they do steal, you know.
[1:42:09] Yeah. That's why I we stopped putting
[1:42:11] air fresher in the bathrooms.
[1:42:15] They run out too quick and we know
[1:42:16] better.
[1:42:20] I know that sound rough, but it's a
[1:42:22] truth.
[1:42:24] People said, "Well, I pay my tithe. I
[1:42:27] You know, people do things and they
[1:42:28] don't know it's wrong."
[1:42:35] But that's what we do. People do things
[1:42:37] and and they don't realize that, you
[1:42:39] know, we we're sheep. We're sheep. And
[1:42:43] just like I said, when you're spiritual,
[1:42:45] you get both sides of the story. You you
[1:42:48] can be influenced by God easily. And
[1:42:51] then you can be fluenced by the devil
[1:42:52] easily if you're not careful. I'm almost
[1:42:55] done. St. John 10. I'm almost done.
[1:43:00] You love the Lord,
[1:43:02] people. This is reality. You you got to
[1:43:05] you got to come up.
[1:43:08] We we counting not counting our pennies
[1:43:10] and oh my God Lord look at this.
[1:43:15] How many of y'all know that God
[1:43:16] multiplies?
[1:43:20] That's the
[1:43:21] scripture. And if you could take God's
[1:43:24] mathematics and really believe it and
[1:43:26] hold on to
[1:43:29] it, God don't mind you saying to him,
[1:43:32] "Lord, your word say,
[1:43:35] I believe your word. Your word say that
[1:43:39] makes God feel
[1:43:41] good. Your word
[1:43:44] say and and when you make God go to God
[1:43:47] like that, you're not being
[1:43:48] disc." The Bible said we can go boldly
[1:43:51] before the throne.
[1:43:54] We're children of God. And we must come
[1:43:57] to understand by God's grace. Amen. That
[1:44:00] God hears us even before we
[1:44:03] call. But can't work with
[1:44:08] unbelief. Can't do it.
[1:44:11] Like I tell somebody, I say, "You sick
[1:44:16] and you have prayer."
[1:44:19] And the moment you look at that
[1:44:21] thermometer,
[1:44:24] you might as well get prayer all over
[1:44:26] again.
[1:44:28] You just broke
[1:44:30] it cuz you wasn't healed. If your your
[1:44:33] your thermometer goes down, your
[1:44:35] temperature go No, no, no, no. You
[1:44:37] healed
[1:44:39] instantly. Whether the temperature go up
[1:44:41] or down, you'll yield instantly.
[1:44:45] If you truly
[1:44:47] believe, God will bring it to pass.
[1:44:51] Amen.
[1:44:54] Devil tricky, you know. He's tricky.
[1:44:59] St. John 10
[1:45:01] 27:33. I'm closing on this. My sheep
[1:45:04] hearth my voice and I know them and they
[1:45:09] follow
[1:45:10] me and I give unto them eternal life and
[1:45:14] they shall never perish neither shall
[1:45:17] any man pluck them out of my
[1:45:21] hand. If you can't rest on
[1:45:24] that I don't know what to
[1:45:28] say your salvation if you if you know
[1:45:31] you got it. First of all, if you can
[1:45:34] hear the message, it's a blessing.
[1:45:37] And all you got to do is receive
[1:45:39] it like like the prophet of God said,
[1:45:41] even though I was listening to the
[1:45:42] Hebrew series this
[1:45:44] morning, he said Jesus done did all the
[1:45:48] saving. He's healed
[1:45:51] everybody, but you got to accept it. He
[1:45:54] said, "People are lost not because of
[1:45:56] their wrongdoings, but because they
[1:45:58] failed to accept the atonement that
[1:46:00] Jesus Christ has provided for them.
[1:46:05] You're already healed."
[1:46:08] He said, "This lady got got on
[1:46:10] him because he pronounced and said she
[1:46:13] was her faith healed her, her husband,
[1:46:15] her husband, excuse me. But a week or so
[1:46:18] later, her husband died."
[1:46:20] He never said, "Thus said the Lord."
[1:46:23] He said because if I say thus said the
[1:46:24] Lord regardless to what you thought or
[1:46:27] feel it was going to
[1:46:29] happen but because I said you heal your
[1:46:31] faith heals you and he died a week or so
[1:46:35] later. She blamed brother Brandham for
[1:46:38] it. See you can have faith
[1:46:41] today and the devil make you doubt
[1:46:43] later. You said that's the truth right.
[1:46:47] Peter
[1:46:48] come. Peter start walking on the water.
[1:46:52] faith had him walking on the water. And
[1:46:56] when he began to see all the things
[1:46:58] happening around him, he began to doubt.
[1:47:01] He began to falter. Hallelujah. The l
[1:47:06] the thing that I love about Jesus that
[1:47:08] even when you get ready to sink, he's
[1:47:11] right there to reach out to you. He's
[1:47:13] right there. That's that's the reality
[1:47:16] of Christ. He cannot fail you.
[1:47:20] He can't. The problem is we fail him.
[1:47:26] And you got to you got to understand if
[1:47:28] God says no. Amen.
[1:47:31] Amen. Amen. Some things we go through,
[1:47:34] God allow us to go through. I'm getting
[1:47:37] ready. I'm getting ready to close.
[1:47:39] Is that right? That was the difference
[1:47:41] between Billy uh or Roberts and brother
[1:47:43] Brandham.
[1:47:45] Or Roberts would pray for any and
[1:47:46] everybody and they would get healed. And
[1:47:50] brother Brandon said, "When you pray for
[1:47:51] somebody and they get healed, you better
[1:47:54] know you pray in the will of God."
[1:47:58] Cuz sometime God put things on people.
[1:48:01] And if you take them off, then God get
[1:48:04] angry with
[1:48:06] you. That's why he had a discernment.
[1:48:09] Let me find out where the sin is.
[1:48:17] Hey, in all your ways acknowledge him.
[1:48:23] Is that the truth? You can't even help
[1:48:26] everybody financially.
[1:48:29] You got to know it's the will of God.
[1:48:32] Amen. They said, "Well, you're a
[1:48:34] Christian." Yeah, I'm a Christian.
[1:48:37] But was Jesus a Christian?
[1:48:39] Hallelujah. He was the first.
[1:48:42] Amen. Is that true?
[1:48:45] At at the pool of Bethesda, did he heal
[1:48:46] everybody?
[1:48:50] No. No. There's some people you just uh
[1:48:53] you know, I'm finding that out. I'm
[1:48:56] finding that out. I need to ask God, is
[1:48:58] this your
[1:48:59] will? But I I have not found a place
[1:49:02] where I have not found the will of
[1:49:04] God. Whenever I moved in the way I
[1:49:07] moved, I moved. So I had never regret
[1:49:10] it. But I'm learning.
[1:49:14] maybe in a family way.
[1:49:18] I'm learning from, you know, because
[1:49:20] anyway, I'm not going to get into that.
[1:49:22] But my point
[1:49:24] is when people don't live
[1:49:27] right, you need to check and see what
[1:49:29] they
[1:49:30] doing. Why are you in this condition?
[1:49:35] Because if they don't straighten the
[1:49:36] condition,
[1:49:38] they're going to repeat repeat repeat,
[1:49:42] right? You know, some people don't like
[1:49:44] to work.
[1:49:49] Now, I'm not throwing up. I'm just
[1:49:50] saying. Maybe I shouldn't have said
[1:49:52] that, but because I don't feel like that
[1:49:54] about nobody here, but I I know some
[1:49:58] people that that's in my family. Let me
[1:50:00] put that. They don't like to work.
[1:50:05] But they don't they don't mind saying,
[1:50:06] "Give me."
[1:50:12] Paul said, "If you don't work, you don't
[1:50:14] eat."
[1:50:16] Now, he ain't talking about some of
[1:50:17] y'all who who you can't help. You know,
[1:50:19] you done lost your job. That's not what
[1:50:21] I'm talking about. I'm talking about
[1:50:24] people who who who just love to leech on
[1:50:28] people.
[1:50:30] I don't know. I'm talking to somebody,
[1:50:32] but I don't know who I'm talking to.
[1:50:34] But my point is, in all that you do,
[1:50:37] make sure you're doing it under the
[1:50:38] spirit of the Lord Jesus.
[1:50:42] Giving is not a problem with me. And I
[1:50:45] try to be whatever God wants me to be. I
[1:50:47] don't care. I don't I'm not a lover of
[1:50:50] money, though I know some of y'all think
[1:50:51] I am, but I am not. You know, I don't
[1:50:55] care about fame, cuz if I cared about
[1:50:57] fame, I wouldn't be
[1:50:58] here. Hallelujah. and I've been faithful
[1:51:01] to my wife. There's not a woman out
[1:51:04] there, y'all understand me, who can say
[1:51:08] I did nothing.
[1:51:10] So, by the grace of God, you love the
[1:51:13] Lord. Now, I want you to
[1:51:16] understand that as a people of
[1:51:20] God, it's our duty to help one another.
[1:51:23] Now I say what I said but it is our
[1:51:27] duty but not but not to get
[1:51:34] glorification. I'm almost done. I know
[1:51:36] I'm over about 15
[1:51:38] minutes. Not to get
[1:51:40] glorification. You're not here to get
[1:51:43] glorification. But there should be
[1:51:45] nobody in this
[1:51:47] church
[1:51:49] suffering and you know about it and you
[1:51:52] won't help.
[1:51:55] Oh, y'all getting quiet now.
[1:51:59] Jesus
[1:52:00] said, "When was I sick and you visited
[1:52:03] me?"
[1:52:06] Remember that's in Matthew 25 talking
[1:52:09] about the virgins wise and foolish and
[1:52:12] wise.
[1:52:14] When I was naked, when did you close me?
[1:52:18] When I was hungry. You see, the bride of
[1:52:20] Jesus Christ is so so she's supposed to
[1:52:23] function such a in such a way.
[1:52:26] She function in a way that when I do
[1:52:28] something for you, don't tell
[1:52:32] nobody. You understand me? It ain't on
[1:52:35] everybody's
[1:52:36] business. So, cuz God laid it on your
[1:52:38] heart to do that for that
[1:52:40] person. Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[1:52:44] And you, that's the way it's supposed to
[1:52:46] be. We supposed to
[1:52:48] work. And some of y'all got more money
[1:52:50] than I do.
[1:52:54] And won't even buy your b brother a
[1:52:55] burger.
[1:53:00] No, it ain't right.
[1:53:03] None of us should be suffering like
[1:53:04] that.
[1:53:07] Am I wrong in saying this?
[1:53:11] You know, I said it like this in
[1:53:14] closing. So, you won't think I ain't
[1:53:15] picking on nobody, but I know a lot of
[1:53:18] people not long ago lost their job.
[1:53:22] And I know at times they probably needed
[1:53:25] help. Hallelujah.
[1:53:28] Hallelujah. And I wondered how many of
[1:53:30] us helped each other.
[1:53:37] Please don't raise your hand. Amen. But
[1:53:40] it's a shame
[1:53:42] if we did not.
[1:53:48] That's not the love of God.
[1:53:50] That's not the reality of Christ.
[1:53:54] You understand me? So if there be
[1:53:57] anybody here in need and you know
[1:53:58] they're in
[1:54:00] need, they didn't they didn't ask me.
[1:54:04] Why should they have to
[1:54:05] ask? If you know they need it, why?
[1:54:10] Why? If you know their need, why do they
[1:54:12] have to
[1:54:13] ask? Go knock on the door.
[1:54:17] Put something in their hand. And say,
[1:54:20] "Don't tell nobody."
[1:54:23] Amen. I guarantee you, God will multiply
[1:54:26] what you got.
[1:54:30] I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to
[1:54:32] help you.
[1:54:33] You can't tell me you love me and you
[1:54:36] say I see me in need and won't help me.
[1:54:39] I'm just using me as an example.
[1:54:43] Well, I don't like that, sister.
[1:54:45] You need to be
[1:54:48] saved. That's just all to it. You need
[1:54:51] to be saved. And it ain't all the
[1:54:54] pastor's job to do it all.
[1:54:57] Y'all supposed to be doing something.
[1:55:01] I can't say it enough
[1:55:04] and I don't know why I'm on this, but I
[1:55:06] have to stay on it until he says I'm
[1:55:08] done.
[1:55:10] People in this church are needing
[1:55:14] and you guys are gossip about it. You
[1:55:16] talk about
[1:55:17] it, but gossiping and talking ain't
[1:55:19] going to put nothing on the
[1:55:21] table. Amen.
[1:55:27] In closing,
[1:55:29] my wife is a witness. I'm not going to
[1:55:32] name the people,
[1:55:34] but one day they just brought a couple
[1:55:35] of bags of groceries by the house.
[1:55:42] And these people may not be even
[1:55:44] Christians to you all,
[1:55:48] but they did something Christian-like.
[1:55:53] I'll never forget them
[1:55:56] and I will always pray for them
[1:55:59] and I pray whatever when if that's if
[1:56:03] what if doing that it's going to give
[1:56:06] them eternal life so Lord let it
[1:56:10] be right
[1:56:14] so don't think I'm asking for growth we
[1:56:16] got plenty
[1:56:20] but I'm using that as an example.
[1:56:23] Don't let your brother suffer or your
[1:56:26] sisters suffer
[1:56:30] unnecessarily. The body, the blood, it
[1:56:32] it goes through the entire
[1:56:39] body. Are y'all hearing? Are you
[1:56:43] understanding?
[1:56:45] Let's stand.
[1:56:54] The Bible said that you'll know that
[1:56:57] they are the disciples of Christ because
[1:56:59] of the love they
[1:57:00] have one toward
[1:57:11] another. If you're making a million,
[1:57:14] you got a lot of interest. You could
[1:57:16] actually help somebody who has
[1:57:20] You understand what I'm saying?
[1:57:22] I just pray that somehow,
[1:57:25] see, we the church of God is not
[1:57:30] divided. It's it's one
[1:57:33] and we must understand, we must work
[1:57:35] together.
[1:57:38] Yeah. If if I'm not helping somebody,
[1:57:40] it's only because I don't know you need
[1:57:41] help.
[1:57:44] And sometime people they they they they
[1:57:46] they live in pride.
[1:57:50] But my old mother said to me, "Junior,
[1:57:54] pride ain't never fed a
[1:57:57] man. Pride will never fill your
[1:58:02] stomach." And Jesus even said, "You have
[1:58:04] not because you ask
[1:58:07] not." We are the richest and most
[1:58:09] wealthiest people on
[1:58:11] earth. naturally and spiritually
[1:58:15] potentially we can do
[1:58:21] what I say a a quantum leap
[1:58:24] a quantum leap leap of
[1:58:28] faith take your level of faith to a
[1:58:31] higher
[1:58:32] standard to a higher
[1:58:34] place don't believe just for you believe
[1:58:37] for your
[1:58:39] brethren teamwork is I know you can do
[1:58:42] it
[1:58:43] I know you can do it. That's how team
[1:58:46] works. That's how the church supposed to
[1:58:48] work. We supposed to We supposed to
[1:58:51] actually positively speak well of one
[1:58:55] another. You see somebody
[1:58:58] down, pick them
[1:59:00] up. You see somebody
[1:59:03] stumble, you don't have to go tell
[1:59:06] everybody. Keep
[1:59:08] it. Love covers a multitude of sins.
[1:59:13] correct your brothers and sisters in
[1:59:15] love.
[1:59:16] Nobody nobody like being corrected.
[1:59:20] But when that approach is
[1:59:21] right when they know you honest, they
[1:59:24] know you sincere. They know you want to
[1:59:27] help, they'll receive it and they'll
[1:59:31] thank you down the road.
[1:59:34] Let's love each other like we love
[1:59:36] Christ and like Christ love us.
[1:59:41] Hallelujah.
[1:59:43] I'm trying to
[1:59:46] um
[1:59:50] Oh, what's that song I said I was going
[1:59:52] to sing
[1:59:56] tomorrow? That's one. Huh? The goodness
[2:00:00] of God. Give me a good key so I don't
[2:00:02] know.
[2:00:04] [Music]
[2:00:11] [Music]
[2:00:13] I love you,
[2:00:16] Lord, for your mercy never fails. Keep
[2:00:20] it in your All of
[2:00:23] my I've been held in your
[2:00:27] [Music]
[2:00:28] hands. From the moment that I wake
[2:00:33] up until I lay my
[2:00:36] head. Oh, I will
[2:00:39] sing of the
[2:00:42] goodness of
[2:00:48] God. All my life you have been
[2:00:55] faithful. Yes, Lord.
[2:00:58] All my life you have is so so
[2:01:05] good. In every breath that I am
[2:01:11] able. Oh, I will
[2:01:14] sing of the
[2:01:17] goodness of
[2:01:20] God. I love your voice.
[2:01:27] You have led me through the
[2:01:31] fire in the darkest
[2:01:34] nights. You are close like no
[2:01:40] other. I know you as a
[2:01:45] father. I know you as a friend.
[2:01:50] Oh, I have
[2:01:52] lived in the
[2:01:54] goodness of
[2:01:57] God.
[2:02:00] Oh, all my life you have been
[2:02:07] faithful.
[2:02:09] Yes. All my life you have been so so
[2:02:15] good.

[2:02:22] made,
[2:02:24] hey, I will
[2:02:27] sing of the
[2:02:29] goodness of
[2:02:31] God. I love your voice. I love your
[2:02:36] voice. Everybody sing it. You have led
[2:02:40] me through the fire.
[2:02:44] In the darkest
[2:02:47] nights, you are close like no
[2:02:52] other. I know you as a
[2:02:56] father. Hey, I know you as a
[2:03:01] friend and I have
[2:03:04] live in the
[2:03:06] goodness of God.
[2:03:14] All you have been
[2:03:19] faithful.
[2:03:23] Oh, you
[2:03:25] have so
[2:03:30] good. Every day that I am.
[2:03:35] [Music]
[2:03:37] Oh, I will
[2:03:39] sing of the
[2:03:41] goodness of
[2:03:44] God.
[2:03:47] Yes. Your goodness is running after
[2:03:50] them. Running after
[2:03:55] me. Your goodness is running
[2:03:59] after running after me.
[2:04:04] my life later. I surrender now. I give
[2:04:11] everything. Oh, your goodness is running
[2:04:16] after. It's running after
[2:04:21] me. Your goodness is running after. It's
[2:04:26] running after me.
[2:04:30] Your goodness is running after. It's
[2:04:34] running after
[2:04:37] [Music]
[2:04:40] me. Now I give you
[2:04:45] everything.
[2:04:47] Yes. Your goodness is running
[2:04:50] after running after me.
[2:04:59] All my life you
[2:05:01] [Music]
[2:05:04] have
[2:05:07] so all my life you have been so so
[2:05:16] good with every breath that I am made.
[2:05:23] Oh, I will
[2:05:25] sing for the
[2:05:28] goodness of
[2:05:34] God. And all my life you have been
[2:05:41] faithful.
[2:05:43] Yes. All my life you have been so so
[2:05:49] good.
[2:05:52] Every breath that I am
[2:05:57] made, oh I will
[2:06:00] sing of the
[2:06:03] goodness of
[2:06:07] God. I will
[2:06:09] sing of the
[2:06:12] goodness of
[2:06:14] God. One more time. Yes. I will
[2:06:19] sing of the
[2:06:21] goodness of
[2:06:24] God. Yes, I will
[2:06:28] sing of the
[2:06:30] goodness of
[2:06:34] [Music]
[2:06:38] God. Amen. Amen. I hope you heard
[2:06:42] something this morning.
[2:06:47] on the way of Christ.
[2:06:50] We are a body.
[2:06:54] One of these old days, I'm just going to
[2:06:57] do a
[2:07:01] lesson on the love of God.
[2:07:05] Cuz you can't love God if you can't love
[2:07:07] his people.
[2:07:10] Y'all hear what I say?
[2:07:13] Loving God is loving his people.
[2:07:19] And if Christ is in you,
[2:07:22] you said, "Oh, I don't know about that,
[2:07:24] brother Brooks."
[2:07:26] Brother Bannon was in Mexico, I believe
[2:07:27] it
[2:07:29] was, Africa, whichever one it was. He
[2:07:33] saw a man with no shoes,
[2:07:36] and he took his shoes
[2:07:38] off to give that
[2:07:42] man. How many of us would do
[2:07:44] that? This is my last last pair of
[2:07:47] shoes.
[2:07:49] Well, you always buy some more. You got
[2:07:51] many at home. But y'all understand what
[2:07:54] I'm saying? You should never think about
[2:07:56] what what I already have.
[2:08:02] You love the Lord. God taught me when I
[2:08:06] used to go to Africa and stuff. People
[2:08:09] say, "Oh, I love your towel. Say you can
[2:08:11] have it."
[2:08:13] But I always had in the back of my mind,
[2:08:17] "I can get me another one just like
[2:08:18] that."
[2:08:21] Right.
[2:08:24] That what what was that?
[2:08:26] That really wasn't love. That wasn't
[2:08:28] that was performance. That was
[2:08:31] religion. Love is when you can give and
[2:08:33] you don't know what what's going to come
[2:08:34] back to you. Love don't look for
[2:08:37] something back. You just you just do
[2:08:39] it. And that's what you should do people
[2:08:42] of
[2:08:43] God to one another.
[2:08:47] And don't blow no trumpet. Oh, I did
[2:08:49] this and that and the other cuz I'm
[2:08:51] I'mma close on this note.
[2:08:54] How many
[2:08:55] times God has dealt and done for you?
[2:09:00] Do you think God has a list?
[2:09:03] Well, I did this for him, did that for
[2:09:05] him, did this for him, did that for him.
[2:09:07] I just have done so much for him. I'm
[2:09:08] not going to do nothing
[2:09:10] else. That's not in God's vocabulary.
[2:09:13] That's not in his his way of doing
[2:09:15] things.
[2:09:17] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. You give
[2:09:20] when you don't have to give. Give it
[2:09:21] anyway.
[2:09:23] And watch God bless you.
[2:09:28] Amen. Let's have a word of prayer.
[2:09:31] Father God,
[2:09:33] a lot has been said.
[2:09:35] I trust that those who
[2:09:38] were hearers,
[2:09:42] they were not just listeners,
[2:09:45] but they heard the
[2:09:47] cry. The way of Christ never
[2:09:52] changes. You told that Shunomite woman,
[2:09:57] "Fix me bread first.
[2:10:01] And sometimes that's where you are. You
[2:10:04] we do strange things Lord.
[2:10:07] But those of us who are on the right
[2:10:08] frequency, we hear your voice
[2:10:12] and we do to do to each other or for
[2:10:15] each
[2:10:17] other what we
[2:10:19] hear. We help one
[2:10:22] another without looking for help in
[2:10:24] return.
[2:10:26] We love each other without looking for
[2:10:29] love in return.
[2:10:31] Lord, you even said that we ought to
[2:10:32] love our enemies.
[2:10:35] Hallelujah. Help us, Lord, that we'll
[2:10:38] break down these walls, these
[2:10:42] traditional way of
[2:10:44] thinking from the pull pit to the back
[2:10:46] of the door. Help us now that we would
[2:10:50] we we would love to give because the
[2:10:52] Bible says blessed is the cheerful
[2:10:54] giver. Help us now. Bless this family.
[2:11:00] Bless Lord this
[2:11:02] family. Anoint them with your spirit of
[2:11:04] Christ.
[2:11:06] Open our eyes to see
[2:11:09] and our hearts receive one
[2:11:11] another to know that Christ lives in us.
[2:11:16] In your name Jesus Christ we pray.
[2:11:20] Amen. Amen.
[2:11:23] [Music]
[2:11:26] The brother needs prayer.
[2:11:33] [Music]
[2:11:52] I've seen how faithful he comes with his
[2:11:54] mom. And Lord, I know that the
[2:11:57] experience that he has is beyond his
[2:12:00] mother's influence. I pray, Father God,
[2:12:03] hallelujah, that you continue to bless
[2:12:05] him, Lord. Amen. Strengthen him. He's a
[2:12:07] young man and in this day, Lord God,
[2:12:09] it's hard for young people. But I pray
[2:12:12] that you will protect him, keep his eyes
[2:12:15] focused on you, Lord. May this be the
[2:12:18] best year that he's ever lived. And may
[2:12:20] he live it in you, Lord Jesus. May the
[2:12:23] joy of the Lord overflow him. And I
[2:12:26] pray, Father God, whatever he sets his
[2:12:28] feet to do or hands to do, you would
[2:12:31] cause it to pro prosper, Lord. But most

[2:14:56] more.
[2:15:00] Amen. Uh we have a few announcements to
[2:15:02] make.
[2:15:05] So we are reminded that at the end of
[2:15:07] this month,
[2:15:10] which is uh next Sunday, the 30th of
[2:15:13] March,
[2:15:15] We have brother Gio from New
[2:15:19] York coming to uh preach for us.
[2:15:23] So let's remember uh those meetings in
[2:15:26] prayer and um this March as well is our
[2:15:30] contribution collection uh month.
[2:15:37] So,
[2:15:38] um, by the end of the month, we are
[2:15:41] aiming, as we all discussed, to raise
[2:15:44] $5,000 for the month of March for
[2:15:46] building
[2:15:50] funds. Just a reminder, in January, we
[2:15:53] failed to reach our 5,000 goal.
[2:16:03] We collected 1,900 instead of 5,000.
[2:16:10] So there was a very big we had a very
[2:16:12] big shortfall in that.
[2:16:16] So um yeah, just a reminder so that
[2:16:19] March we can do the collection and we
[2:16:20] are aiming for 5,000
[2:16:27] I was talking to the pastor. So if this
[2:16:28] month we are not able to meet our goals
[2:16:30] as we all discussed
[2:16:50] if it is not sustainable for everyone.
[2:16:55] So we'll come back with a report at the
[2:16:57] end of the
[2:17:00] march with whatever we would have
[2:17:02] collected.
[2:17:06] Then a reminder uh brother Keith's
[2:17:09] funeral is uh being held tomorrow.
[2:17:16] We sent out the details in the uh in the
[2:17:19] church WhatsApp group and an email as
[2:17:23] well. WhatsApp.
[2:17:26] So the place is in Hamilton funeral home
[2:17:32] and uh the program supposed to start um
[2:17:35] visitation is from 11:30 to 12:30
[2:17:44] the ceremony 12:30 to 1:15
[2:17:51] 12:30 to 1:15 there is the ceremony
[2:17:55] fellowship
[2:17:57] Sorry. 12:30 to 1:15 there's a ceremony.
[2:18:04] Then 1:15 to 3:30 we have the fellowship
[2:18:06] with the food.
[2:18:16] That's when the burial is supposed to
[2:18:17] take
[2:18:20] place. But the burial is only set aside
[2:18:23] for the
[2:18:25] family. So the rest of us won't be able
[2:18:28] to go
[2:18:30] except for the
[2:18:32] pastor. So if you are open and um you
[2:18:35] are available
[2:18:37] tomorrow, it'll be good to give our
[2:18:39] brother um a farewell.
[2:18:44] Amen. Amen. And uh brother John has a
[2:18:46] reminder
[2:18:47] for Sunday Sunday school and um the camp
[2:18:53] collections that people are supposed to
[2:18:55] make.
[2:19:05] So those people who are committed that
[2:19:07] they're going please uh pay those
[2:19:09] amounts um so that the registration can
[2:19:12] be made and you won't miss out.
