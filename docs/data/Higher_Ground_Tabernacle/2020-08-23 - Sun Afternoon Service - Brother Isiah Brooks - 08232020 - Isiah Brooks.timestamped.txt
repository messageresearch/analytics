[41:52] god is good to us
[41:56] coming from deuteronomy the eighth
[41:58] chapter deuteronomy 8.
[42:09] deuteronomy 8
[42:11] chapter the second verse
[42:13] from there we're going to go to isaiah
[42:15] 29
[42:17] deuteronomy 8
[42:20] second verse
[42:25] and thou shalt remember all the ways
[42:27] which the lord that god led thee 40
[42:30] years in the wilderness
[42:32] to humble thee and to prove thee
[42:35] and to know what was in thine heart
[42:39] whether thou would keep his commandment
[42:42] or no
[42:44] you met amazing
[42:46] isaiah 29.
[42:58] isaiah 29
[43:04] we're going to read the 11th verse
[43:07] through the 12th then you'll jump down
[43:09] to
[43:10] the 18th and 19th verse of that same
[43:13] chapter
[43:15] and the vision of all is become unto you
[43:17] as the word of god that is sealed
[43:21] which means which men delivered to one
[43:24] that is learned saying read this i pray
[43:26] thee and he said i cannot for it is
[43:29] sealed
[43:31] and the book is delivered to him that is
[43:33] not learned saying read this
[43:35] i pray thee and he saith
[43:37] i am not
[43:38] learned. let's jump down to the 18th
[43:41] verse
[43:44] and in that day shall the death
[43:47] death hear the words of the lord of the
[43:49] book
[43:50] and the eyes of the blind shall see out
[43:52] of obscurity and out of darkness
[43:55] the meek shall also shall increase their
[43:58] joy in the lord and the poor among men
[44:01] shall rejoice in the holy one
[44:04] of israel
[44:05] let us pray
[44:06] father god we come before you lord as
[44:08] humbly as we know how we thank you for
[44:10] your amazing grace
[44:12] we thank you for being so good to us
[44:14] lord you have been better to us than we
[44:16] have been to ourselves
[44:18] father we pray lord god that you will
[44:20] anoint the word anoint the hearts of the
[44:22] people to receive the word
[44:24] oh god draw us nearer and closer lord
[44:26] open our hearts mind that we may
[44:28] recognize who we are in this bible
[44:31] bless us now we pray in jesus christ's
[44:33] name
[44:35] amen you maybe see that
[44:45] one thing that we do know that the bible
[44:47] tells us that jesus christ is the same
[44:49] yesterday today and forever he's a god
[44:51] that changes not
[44:54] and whatever he did on yesterday he'll
[44:56] do it today and forevermore because god
[44:59] is a god that cannot change
[45:01] once he make a decision to do something
[45:03] that that decision is established as
[45:07] permanent
[45:08] he must continue to do it that way god
[45:10] doesn't have a system of multiple
[45:12] choices
[45:14] once he makes one choice once he chooses
[45:16] to do something it remains that same
[45:19] yesterday today and forever
[45:21] because god is perfect
[45:23] so in saying all of that you and i must
[45:26] recognize that the bible in itself
[45:29] is a sealed book
[45:31] it is a book that has been sealed for
[45:33] thousands of years
[45:35] we know about it because daniel talked
[45:37] about it isaiah talked about it malachi
[45:39] and all
[45:41] talked about it that the book was sealed
[45:43] that means for thousands of years men
[45:45] have read this book and never fully
[45:47] understood what it was all about
[45:50] they
[45:51] perhaps went to school and they got
[45:52] their doctor's degree divinity degree or
[45:55] whatever
[45:57] but but many people are in their own
[46:00] minds they they reasoned with it
[46:03] we know by god's grace that god
[46:04] interprets his own word and sometimes
[46:06] god interprets his word in a way that
[46:08] men never think about
[46:10] when the lord talked about john the
[46:12] baptist coming he was saying that the
[46:14] mountains should be
[46:16] brought low and the valley should be
[46:18] brought up
[46:19] and so they were looking for a great
[46:21] earthquake of some sort
[46:23] to happen and here was a man
[46:25] by the name of john in the wilderness uh
[46:28] wrapped with
[46:30] uh
[46:30] skins of the uh sheep
[46:33] eating uh locusts
[46:35] and popping them like
[46:36] popcorn or peanuts in his mouth
[46:38] but we realized by god's grace amen this
[46:41] man looked quite insane to the people
[46:43] but he was the revealed word for that
[46:46] day
[46:47] even when it came to the coming of jesus
[46:50] christ many thought that jesus christ
[46:52] more than likely would ride into
[46:53] jerusalem on a white horse a stallion at
[46:56] that
[46:57] and he would come and he would conquer
[46:59] and take over the roman empire overthrow
[47:02] them
[47:03] and the kingdom of israel would be
[47:05] established
[47:07] but these were the uh very uh how could
[47:10] i say it this was the the the the uh
[47:13] uh the explanation of the scholars of
[47:16] that day
[47:17] because the bible in itself cannot be
[47:20] explained in a calmer way
[47:22] it is spiritually discerned and most of
[47:24] the bible in itself are written it's
[47:27] written in in in a way of parables
[47:30] sometimes god uses stories or whatever
[47:33] to tell
[47:34] uh things and and and these these his
[47:37] way of doing this is to hide it from the
[47:40] wise and the prudent
[47:42] we know by god's grace that every time
[47:44] things get really bad whether it be in
[47:46] israel or whether it be by the gentiles
[47:48] of course we being a new new generation
[47:51] if we're going to say a new way of doing
[47:53] things are grafted vine
[47:55] god still could not do his work among
[47:58] the gentiles without having a prophet
[48:02] and whether you realize it or not one of
[48:04] the first prophets to the gentiles
[48:06] though he be jew amen he was paul who
[48:10] was once named saul
[48:12] and paul in himself was a revelation
[48:15] to the new gentile church
[48:18] because he was not part of the 12
[48:21] apostles when jesus walked the earth
[48:24] paul was a revelation
[48:27] because to the new church
[48:29] because they did not no nor did jesus
[48:32] tell them that saul or paul was coming
[48:35] amen when the church started a man he
[48:37] was a
[48:38] persecutor of the church and then
[48:41] eventually he was converted by the
[48:43] pillar fire
[48:44] who was jesus himself while on the road
[48:46] to damascus
[48:48] amen and so paul conversion disturbed
[48:52] the church it made the men know
[48:55] that
[48:56] they're not the controller
[48:58] of god and god will do whatever he wants
[49:01] to do because you remember they voted in
[49:04] this man called i think matthias
[49:06] something like that
[49:07] and brother bradham said that that was
[49:09] never god's choice that was men george
[49:12] god had already a man who he was going
[49:15] to put in place
[49:16] i'm saying all of these things to let
[49:18] you know that god is not moved by what
[49:21] we think he in the way that we think he
[49:24] ought to move god has already
[49:26] established his way of moving and one
[49:28] thing about it is he can't change that
[49:30] it is what it is
[49:32] and so
[49:34] i said all of that because all of the
[49:36] stories the bibles are the things in
[49:38] history because god is in history god is
[49:40] in psalms god is in all of those things
[49:42] and and and and they are inspired so we
[49:45] can look through the scriptures and we
[49:47] can look through the psalms and we can
[49:48] see you say well what do you mean you
[49:50] know david said in the psalms you know
[49:54] they have pierced me in my side
[49:56] david never was pierced in the side
[49:58] amen and and they looked upon me and so
[50:02] it was christ in david
[50:05] amen in the book of psalms inspired by
[50:07] psalms amen to lay a word in there that
[50:11] that soon became prophecy
[50:14] it may have taken i say soon but
[50:16] hundreds of years but that word was
[50:18] there and god confounds the wise
[50:21] you know he's we've got we got
[50:23] theologians right now who still do not
[50:26] believe in the virgin birth
[50:28] when the virgin birth has already
[50:30] occurred
[50:32] but they look at their bible and they
[50:34] figure it in their intellectual minds
[50:36] they say it can't be it can't be
[50:38] never have a virgin conceived
[50:41] well
[50:44] god did a new thing
[50:46] and god had already prophesied it was
[50:48] going to take place and it did
[50:51] so i'm saying i'm just kind of like
[50:53] building a little stage because you and
[50:55] i we're in the last
[50:56] last age
[50:59] and this age that we're in is not
[51:01] laodicea
[51:03] if you remain in laodicea you will be
[51:05] anointed by laodicea and you would do
[51:07] the works of laodicea you will be as
[51:10] blind as laodicea because lay your
[51:12] decear is not a a person
[51:15] or thing
[51:16] or place
[51:18] it is a condition
[51:20] it is a condition where men amen loses
[51:23] their first love
[51:25] and find themselves in a place of
[51:27] lukewarmness
[51:29] when you and i see by god's grace amen
[51:32] that god how can i say it he always uh
[51:35] history repeats itself
[51:38] you know even so much so that the book
[51:41] uh
[51:42] songs of solomon tells us these things
[51:45] ecclesiastes excuse me tell us these
[51:47] things that there is no new thing under
[51:49] the sun
[51:50] that everything that was and and has
[51:52] been will be and is
[51:55] everything comes around
[51:56] again
[51:58] men die but the spirits don't die
[52:01] and you and i must understand that
[52:02] there's a purpose behind all of this
[52:05] so i say this to say by god's grace
[52:09] that even the message that god brought
[52:10] to us through
[52:12] malachi 4 william branham
[52:14] can never be looked upon and read as a
[52:18] newspaper
[52:19] you'll never get what he's trying to
[52:21] tell you
[52:22] because everything that's led on whether
[52:25] it be on book or tape is there to be
[52:28] revealed
[52:29] to the prophet of uh to the people of
[52:31] god remember jesus said it
[52:34] flesh and blood has not revealed this
[52:35] thing unto you peter but my father which
[52:38] is in heaven he has revealed this and
[52:40] upon this rock i'll build my church and
[52:43] the gates of hell shall not prevail so
[52:46] we understand by god's grace that if
[52:48] you're going to get the real
[52:49] understanding of the message it's going
[52:52] to take more than you reading the books
[52:54] or just listening to the tapes you've
[52:57] got to meditate and you've got to ask
[52:59] god what is it
[53:01] that you want me to know
[53:03] what is it that you want me to see what
[53:05] is it that you want me to understand
[53:08] reveal to me
[53:10] what is being said
[53:13] on these tapes
[53:15] because remember amen brother branham
[53:17] says a lot of things
[53:19] and it just looked like he just avoiding
[53:21] the answers to the questions
[53:23] or avoiding saying directly what he's
[53:26] about to say
[53:27] and that's the way it is
[53:29] god always worked in a way a parable
[53:32] jesus did it so much so when they asked
[53:35] jesus amen uh was he the messiah and
[53:39] jesus
[53:40] returned the question you know they said
[53:41] never you never answer a question with a
[53:43] question but jesus did it
[53:45] he said tell me who was john the baptist
[53:48] you understand me you tell me who john
[53:50] the baptist is then i'll tell you who i
[53:53] am well of course they never would tell
[53:55] him they said we don't know and then
[53:57] jesus said well then i cannot tell see
[54:00] it is the thing that god does and he's
[54:02] always doing it
[54:04] and we're looking at a time where even
[54:06] in this message for over 50 years we
[54:09] have tried to interpret this message
[54:12] when we in fact know that the prophet of
[54:14] god said that christ interprets the word
[54:18] himself
[54:19] is that right
[54:20] and so therefore
[54:22] in all of these things we fail to see
[54:25] that god has been trying us for over 50
[54:28] years
[54:29] to see whether we would do his will or
[54:31] not
[54:32] hallelujah the bride of jesus christ
[54:35] should be further up the road hallelujah
[54:39] talking about exploits we we don't have
[54:41] to say oh uh we got to have this in the
[54:43] church we got to have this in the church
[54:45] if we get right with god
[54:47] those gifts in itself will fall into
[54:50] line
[54:51] hallelujah but god is looking for a
[54:54] matured woman
[54:55] a people a man who is who has been
[54:58] groomed and raised up by the holy spirit
[55:02] did you hear what i'm saying
[55:04] right galatians says amen that the tudor
[55:06] is the holy spirit the holy ghost and
[55:09] that holy ghost raises us checks on us
[55:13] and and and expresses to god
[55:16] where we are when it comes to our growth
[55:19] there is no way of getting around it
[55:22] the lord knows your heart he knows the
[55:24] depths of your heart he knows your
[55:26] motive he knows your thinking he knows
[55:28] everything
[55:29] and like i said the only way that we can
[55:32] overcome this is that we must die to our
[55:34] own will
[55:36] now we find that even in isaiah i said
[55:38] it's in a way of prophesying he said
[55:40] there's a book and he's he's telling he
[55:42] asking the intellectual can you read
[55:44] this
[55:45] he goes to the poor can you read this he
[55:47] goes to the learner can you read this
[55:50] right
[55:50] nobody could read it
[55:52] nobody could understand it why because
[55:55] the book is sealed hallelujah now watch
[55:58] this now this is the bible this is the
[56:01] book this is the scroll
[56:03] i can open this book
[56:05] and i can say woe to ariel to ariel the
[56:08] city where david dwell and ye and ye
[56:11] year to year let them kill sacrifices i
[56:15] can walk away with this and say okay
[56:17] something's going on in ariel
[56:19] but you see there's a spiritual
[56:21] application to it
[56:22] it's not just amen reading the word of
[56:25] the bible and thinking you getting it
[56:27] hallelujah it's not even comparing
[56:30] scripture to scripture which in turn all
[56:32] of those things are good
[56:34] but you're not learned you don't learn
[56:37] god by comparing scripture to scripture
[56:39] you learn god by the revelation
[56:42] of the scriptures that you're comparing
[56:45] is that all right i'm saying this for a
[56:47] purpose because many people in this
[56:50] message know they they think they've
[56:51] really got it all together
[56:54] in reality all they have done is learn a
[56:57] book that has been closed to them
[57:01] oh you said the book is open the mighty
[57:03] angel came down revelation 10 and the
[57:06] book was open
[57:07] tell me
[57:08] tell me
[57:09] what was in the open book
[57:13] because you got to understand when the
[57:15] seals were broken
[57:17] this book
[57:18] became a new book
[57:20] y'all know what i mean
[57:22] now the bible even told daniel shut up
[57:25] the words
[57:27] shut up the words how do you shut up the
[57:30] words if a brother speak
[57:32] or somebody speak
[57:34] and they're speaking certain words
[57:37] you can't take it back
[57:41] how do you shut up words
[57:44] you shut up words by
[57:46] hiding the meaning of the word
[57:50] you set up the bible by hiding the
[57:53] meaning or the revelation of what's
[57:56] being said
[57:57] because theologians have been able to
[58:00] read this book people in the message
[58:02] well they may read the book
[58:06] because i find out that people want to
[58:08] know god but they're so lazy they don't
[58:10] want to read
[58:13] the bible says blessed is the man that
[58:14] readeth
[58:16] you must read
[58:18] you're in a land in an area that i don't
[58:20] care if you slow in reading read it
[58:23] anyhow
[58:24] now this book is also given to the
[58:26] unlearned it's given to the ignorant
[58:29] is that right
[58:30] but god amen is is is blessing those who
[58:34] are humble enough to receive it because
[58:37] really in isaiah 29 18 it says in that
[58:40] day shall the death
[58:42] hear the words of the book
[58:44] and the eyes of the blind shall see out
[58:46] of obscurity and out of darkness
[58:49] something that is unknown something that
[58:51] is an uh unimportant personal thing
[58:54] they're in the darkness they're in a
[58:55] place they're not noticeable
[58:58] but those are the ones whom god comes to
[59:00] bless in this day you say well what do
[59:02] you mean remember that little story
[59:05] about the ranch's son and i preached a
[59:07] little bit of this this morning but i'll
[59:08] just kind of get to something else
[59:10] amen where the man amen sent uh uh for
[59:14] uh this man to find assad a wife for his
[59:18] uh
[59:19] son
[59:20] he didn't pick all the fancy girls
[59:23] he didn't pick the pentecostals and
[59:25] those that jumped around and those who
[59:27] like to dance because let me tell you
[59:28] something you can dance till you turn
[59:31] great
[59:33] that don't put you in heaven
[59:36] and that doesn't declare that you've
[59:37] been born again
[59:39] hallelujah because when a man and a
[59:41] woman is being is born again there is a
[59:44] change and a thirst in their lives
[59:48] hallelujah it says the meek also shall
[59:51] increase their joy in the lord and the
[59:54] poor among men shall rejoice in the holy
[59:56] one of israel but what about the
[59:58] educated ones what about the the
[1:00:01] intelligent ones that that are able to
[1:00:03] reason and all of these things but you
[1:00:05] see that those are the ones
[1:00:09] where the book was sealed
[1:00:11] now i'm gonna say i'm gonna say some
[1:00:13] things what about the great men
[1:00:16] of god in this message
[1:00:18] who's able to really
[1:00:20] cause you to get excited
[1:00:24] they know how to bring it
[1:00:26] the mighty angel came down from
[1:00:28] revelation 10 once one foot on the land
[1:00:30] and one on the scene oh hallelujah
[1:00:33] and at the end of the day
[1:00:35] you'll walk away
[1:00:37] with nothing to change you
[1:00:42] look at the condition
[1:00:44] because i want you to understand in
[1:00:46] order to go on with god you got to
[1:00:48] recognize where you are
[1:00:51] and the bible tells us that at the end
[1:00:54] when time would be no more when
[1:00:55] revelation 10 would come into play
[1:00:57] in revelation 5 time would be no more
[1:01:01] it's the ending of things
[1:01:03] we know when it comes to laodicea we're
[1:01:05] not a part of laodicea how many of y'all
[1:01:07] believe that
[1:01:08] we're no longer in laodicea
[1:01:10] we are in what we call the eighth day
[1:01:13] we're in that place where brother
[1:01:14] brandon said the holy convocation
[1:01:17] meaning that the seventh have turned
[1:01:19] back to eight turn to eight and the
[1:01:21] eighth is the first
[1:01:22] and he explains to us that this message
[1:01:26] is to change us so much
[1:01:29] that it will place us back into a
[1:01:31] position
[1:01:32] before the fall
[1:01:35] y'all hear me
[1:01:36] now how many of us have been pressing
[1:01:40] into god
[1:01:41] to bring that to pass
[1:01:44] this message and i'm not going to be
[1:01:45] long because i know we're tired but in
[1:01:47] the bible tells us let this mind be in
[1:01:50] you that was also in christ jesus
[1:01:54] who what who thought it not robbery to
[1:01:57] be equal with god
[1:01:59] so that you'll know you are part of
[1:02:01] god's
[1:02:05] godhead
[1:02:07] whoo
[1:02:08] yes ah
[1:02:09] cause remember brother branham described
[1:02:11] it
[1:02:12] i love this yesterday i was just weeping
[1:02:14] just crying crying to myself
[1:02:16] uh uh uh looking at these things
[1:02:19] and you know here it was god who was
[1:02:21] before god
[1:02:23] before he was god he was elohim
[1:02:24] self-existing one is that right he comes
[1:02:27] along amen and then
[1:02:30] he becomes the logos
[1:02:32] which is the word god in the logos is
[1:02:35] the same
[1:02:36] not a separate ain't two gods is one god
[1:02:39] it's just a different manifestation of
[1:02:41] that same god
[1:02:42] he unfolds himself into the logos and
[1:02:45] the logos is that right we called him
[1:02:47] jesus
[1:02:48] and jesus began to create everything
[1:02:53] hallelujah at the father's will
[1:02:57] then jesus is that right unfolds himself
[1:03:01] or god unfolds himself another foe right
[1:03:05] and the last fall of god before he
[1:03:07] rested
[1:03:08] was man
[1:03:10] amen
[1:03:13] let me say it again
[1:03:14] the last fall of god
[1:03:17] before he rested
[1:03:19] adam was god in flesh
[1:03:22] and what god was doing
[1:03:24] was making himself a body to live in
[1:03:28] y'all understand me that was the last
[1:03:30] fold of god was that god dwelled or
[1:03:34] desired to live in human flesh
[1:03:37] in order to create a fellowship with his
[1:03:41] creation
[1:03:42] that's what adam was
[1:03:44] and adam fell
[1:03:46] hallelujah and so therefore god from
[1:03:49] that point on could not allow
[1:03:52] himself to dwell without him in that
[1:03:54] state
[1:03:56] because the flesh in itself was to be
[1:03:58] governed by the holy ghost
[1:04:00] is that right that's what the holy ghost
[1:04:02] is here for
[1:04:03] to reflect christ jesus in us
[1:04:06] hallelujah you say brother books i don't
[1:04:08] believe what you're saying well if you
[1:04:10] don't believe it let me explain it to
[1:04:11] you in the future home brother adam says
[1:04:14] above jesus christ will be the pill of
[1:04:16] fire jesus christ was set on the throne
[1:04:18] and then the bride of jesus christ
[1:04:21] what was that who was in the city
[1:04:24] that's god in the city
[1:04:27] and the bible tells us that before he is
[1:04:29] that right that's the bible jesus said
[1:04:32] in the word according to paul's writing
[1:04:35] we are joint heirs with christ
[1:04:39] jesus even said
[1:04:40] if you overcome this world
[1:04:43] you will set in my throne
[1:04:46] as i have sat in my father's throne
[1:04:50] hallelujah
[1:04:52] so the oneness of god is just a greater
[1:04:54] manifestation of god if we can
[1:04:56] understand
[1:04:57] that even when the prophet of god i'm
[1:04:59] not going to be long so you better
[1:05:00] anyway anyway
[1:05:02] brother branham says this
[1:05:05] when he was on the scene the angel would
[1:05:07] come and talk to him and show him things
[1:05:09] and different things he see visions he
[1:05:11] could interpret dreams but something
[1:05:14] took place
[1:05:17] when that sword hit his hand
[1:05:20] god didn't tell him go up there on the
[1:05:21] mountain i've got a sword to hit your
[1:05:23] hand no
[1:05:24] it was god appointed time led him up
[1:05:26] there he's up there praying all of a
[1:05:28] sudden the sword hits his hand
[1:05:30] he said it was a perfect fit
[1:05:34] right and he heard a voice that said
[1:05:37] this is the king's sword
[1:05:40] well the king sword
[1:05:42] he thought would maybe a
[1:05:44] a king you know not a king the king
[1:05:48] amen when man god and man became one
[1:05:56] in the prophet's life because god was
[1:05:58] using him as a wave sheath
[1:06:01] the king's word and then brother banner
[1:06:04] tells us when it when the seals were
[1:06:05] opened and the thunders were open he
[1:06:08] typed it in he said that's what that
[1:06:11] sword was
[1:06:13] it was the seven seals
[1:06:15] the hidden word
[1:06:17] unfolding
[1:06:20] to us
[1:06:21] remember now he didn't understand it
[1:06:24] is that the truth it's the truth
[1:06:26] he said i thought i knew i went to you
[1:06:29] know different ones the different
[1:06:30] sources and you know i had the white
[1:06:32] horse as christ and you know and all of
[1:06:35] those things and he had it all wrong and
[1:06:37] he said you know even that morning when
[1:06:39] the first seal was supposed to be broken
[1:06:41] he still was looking for other stuff
[1:06:43] and all of a sudden the angel walked in
[1:06:46] hallelujah now you say well what do you
[1:06:48] mean he said the angels of the lord not
[1:06:51] angel
[1:06:52] seven angels of the lord
[1:06:55] that had the seventh under mystery
[1:06:57] to unfold unto the supr brother branham
[1:07:01] now watch this now
[1:07:03] because you and i must understand
[1:07:06] he said the move is on for the bride
[1:07:09] we're no longer in the seventh church
[1:07:11] age
[1:07:12] if you thank laos here you're going to
[1:07:14] act like leona's here you're going to be
[1:07:16] lazy you're going to be lukewarm that's
[1:07:18] the spirit you're fighting come out of
[1:07:20] her my people he's not talking about
[1:07:22] coming out of the catholic church or the
[1:07:24] baptist church or this church or that
[1:07:25] church come out of the spirit
[1:07:28] of laodicea that's what's imprisoning
[1:07:31] the people it's the spirit of land is
[1:07:33] here it is the thing that enslaves you
[1:07:37] you got to want to come out of that
[1:07:40] you can't allow satan amen to slow you
[1:07:42] up at this point time because zechariah
[1:07:44] said once the vision is made plain and
[1:07:46] clear to you run
[1:07:49] let him that readeth run
[1:07:51] because the vision is appointed time
[1:07:53] it's just a short time it's not going to
[1:07:55] last forever
[1:07:57] that's what he said
[1:07:59] let me tell you something and once the
[1:08:00] gentile door is closed it's shut is shut
[1:08:04] you can bang on it all you want to it's
[1:08:06] still shut
[1:08:08] nor tell you that
[1:08:09] this is gross darkness that we're in
[1:08:12] gross darkness and you must understand
[1:08:15] you are at the wall
[1:08:17] you're fighting the last battle
[1:08:20] in this dimension
[1:08:22] hallelujah and god chose you and i
[1:08:25] but what are we doing we're doing just
[1:08:27] like israel we're laying easy in zion
[1:08:31] that's what prophet god said he said
[1:08:33] every church age was able to understand
[1:08:36] and know their enemy but this layout is
[1:08:38] seeing people they don't understand he
[1:08:41] said easy living is our greatest enemy
[1:08:44] hallelujah but don't you worry
[1:08:47] just like israel amen lay there in egypt
[1:08:50] amen for 400 years because they were in
[1:08:53] gerst goshen
[1:08:54] god said uh-uh this is not your homeland
[1:08:58] and those of us who are bribed god is
[1:09:00] not going to allow you to stay in that
[1:09:02] condition
[1:09:03] huh y'all hear me
[1:09:05] the bible tells us it was attendant
[1:09:07] brother brandon tells us it was the
[1:09:08] tinder hand of jehovah that drove the
[1:09:11] jews back to their homeland you don't
[1:09:13] want to tend the hand of jehovah
[1:09:16] to drive you
[1:09:18] you want to be led by like sheep
[1:09:21] hallelujah
[1:09:22] but if it takes that it's going to take
[1:09:24] that
[1:09:25] you better realize tonight amen
[1:09:29] that ramses is coming
[1:09:32] we were talking about that coming here
[1:09:34] ramsay is coming
[1:09:35] the world council of church and the pope
[1:09:38] is coming and knocking on your door
[1:09:40] and you better believe that this whole
[1:09:42] world is being set up for a new world
[1:09:44] war world order and whether you want to
[1:09:47] believe it or not it doesn't matter
[1:09:49] there are people who say well i don't
[1:09:50] believe noah there was an our god proved
[1:09:53] them to be liars
[1:09:55] the ark was found on mount ararack where
[1:09:57] god the bible said it was there are many
[1:09:59] people who say well there if there was
[1:10:01] no virgin birth we might as well give it
[1:10:04] up
[1:10:06] it was so important
[1:10:08] that god would come by way of a virgin
[1:10:12] birth
[1:10:13] if it had not been a virgin birth
[1:10:16] there would have never been a
[1:10:17] restitution
[1:10:19] it took
[1:10:21] god
[1:10:22] to create the blood cell
[1:10:25] and the housing for the blood
[1:10:28] it was not joseph blood and neither was
[1:10:30] mary mixed in it
[1:10:32] if they had been mixed in it we would
[1:10:34] have still been lost
[1:10:36] jesus would never have
[1:10:38] mounted up amen to the place of a savior
[1:10:42] because he would have been tainted
[1:10:45] but you got to understand the word never
[1:10:48] makes a mistake
[1:10:50] god put us in the flesh
[1:10:53] so that the mistakes could be made
[1:10:55] and so that he can correct the mistakes
[1:10:58] but the word
[1:11:00] would never and can never make a mistake
[1:11:04] yeah you say well what do you mean
[1:11:05] brother brooks even when jesus at the
[1:11:07] age of 12 left his mom or his dad and
[1:11:11] mary
[1:11:13] he didn't make no mistake
[1:11:14] he wasn't being a bad boy
[1:11:16] he was being led by his father
[1:11:19] somebody help me here you understand me
[1:11:22] and when mary and joseph came mary
[1:11:25] denounce her her experience
[1:11:27] your father and i
[1:11:29] look for you and then jesus the word
[1:11:31] corrector
[1:11:33] amen
[1:11:34] don't you know him about my father's
[1:11:36] business
[1:11:37] so what are you saying i'm trying to get
[1:11:39] you get you to say the bible says
[1:11:41] amen that gross darkness will be upon
[1:11:44] the people now i don't know about you
[1:11:47] but if you go go out even at night
[1:11:49] there is a different kind of darkness
[1:11:52] now
[1:11:53] we were just driving the other day and i
[1:11:54] said i said to my daughter i said you
[1:11:56] see this darkness is different
[1:11:58] it's different and and i've seen it for
[1:12:01] a while now but he's not talking about
[1:12:02] that but the natural types are spiritual
[1:12:05] there is a darkness on the people are
[1:12:07] blind is on the people and they cannot
[1:12:10] see
[1:12:11] how you were going to tell the pharisees
[1:12:13] of the of that day that jesus was the
[1:12:16] messiah and everything in their
[1:12:18] intellectual mind taught them
[1:12:21] differently they were taught wrong
[1:12:24] but they believed the error
[1:12:26] right so when jesus came he didn't even
[1:12:28] they didn't even recognize him they
[1:12:30] didn't even understand who he was
[1:12:34] so much so they asked that question i'm
[1:12:36] coming to something now you and i must
[1:12:38] understand
[1:12:39] that the churches are in gross darkness
[1:12:43] amen
[1:12:45] and look at this
[1:12:46] even though god took israel out of egypt
[1:12:49] the majority of those people were still
[1:12:51] in egypt
[1:12:53] their lives never never never left
[1:12:56] you know they had church service with
[1:12:57] moses that was the best of all things
[1:12:59] but that's it
[1:13:00] they acted like egypt they thirst after
[1:13:03] egypt
[1:13:05] they danced like egypt
[1:13:07] everything they did was like egypt
[1:13:11] egypt was still in them
[1:13:14] and they didn't even know it because
[1:13:16] they followed the prophet i like the way
[1:13:18] ben said it
[1:13:20] there
[1:13:22] is that right
[1:13:23] they didn't have to do nothing
[1:13:25] all they had to do was follow a prophet
[1:13:28] hallelujah but there was a change
[1:13:30] moses is dead the ministry is changing
[1:13:34] joseph is the head now
[1:13:36] joseph is another word for jesus is that
[1:13:38] right joshua excuse me but joseph is
[1:13:41] perfection so we find out yourself well
[1:13:43] what do you mean not that the man is
[1:13:45] dead he's not dead he's alive like all
[1:13:46] the other saints but god has moved on
[1:13:50] can i can i say it like this if you
[1:13:53] following this message
[1:13:56] and you're looking at the message in a
[1:13:58] way that because brother branham was the
[1:14:01] seventh angel messenger
[1:14:02] to laodicea did you know that
[1:14:05] he was
[1:14:06] and even joseph either even brother
[1:14:09] branham said this he said
[1:14:11] elijah
[1:14:13] was uh
[1:14:14] ahab and
[1:14:16] all jezebel's pastor even though they
[1:14:18] didn't like it
[1:14:20] he was their pastor
[1:14:22] and brother branham was the pastor or
[1:14:24] the shepherd of that age
[1:14:26] whether they liked it or not he was and
[1:14:28] still is
[1:14:31] but something went on when those seers
[1:14:32] were open when god began to break the
[1:14:34] seals when that time junior jackson's
[1:14:37] dream and and the vision that brother
[1:14:39] branham had and and you know the big old
[1:14:41] blast or the the explosion that he that
[1:14:43] came brother branham actually thought he
[1:14:45] was going to die
[1:14:46] sir is this the time something's
[1:14:48] happening i don't know what it is but
[1:14:50] perhaps maybe this is it he didn't know
[1:14:52] exactly what was going on until it
[1:14:55] happened
[1:14:56] and the very dream he had picking up the
[1:14:59] cocker barrel off his pant leg boom here
[1:15:01] come the angels
[1:15:02] not one angel
[1:15:04] seven
[1:15:07] seven
[1:15:08] and understand those seals everyone one
[1:15:11] two three four five six had already been
[1:15:13] open
[1:15:14] otherwise brother branham here he was
[1:15:16] standing there is that right that's in
[1:15:18] your message you know
[1:15:20] brother branham didn't open the six
[1:15:21] seals he opened the seventh and the
[1:15:24] seven explained all the others
[1:15:26] all those that worked under you know
[1:15:29] luther wesley whenever the seers were
[1:15:30] open they didn't know what they were
[1:15:32] doing
[1:15:34] god said he always brother and said god
[1:15:36] always do something then after it's done
[1:15:38] he comes back and tell you what he did
[1:15:41] that's what he did
[1:15:43] right and so brother brown opens the
[1:15:45] seals he tells us what was under the
[1:15:47] first second third fourth fifth sixth
[1:15:49] seals souls under the altar jews amen
[1:15:52] persecuted
[1:15:53] you know the three unclean spirits
[1:15:56] he tells us all of that we had no idea
[1:16:00] right but those spirits had already
[1:16:02] started working
[1:16:04] hallelujah
[1:16:05] y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:16:07] they were manifesting themselves already
[1:16:10] world war one had the first war had
[1:16:12] already happened
[1:16:14] the second war had already happened
[1:16:16] hallelujah that was the first and second
[1:16:18] world like i said this morning and right
[1:16:20] in between the second war and the third
[1:16:22] wall is the rapture
[1:16:25] and you and i we're looking at this
[1:16:27] thing like like like like lay of the
[1:16:29] sins
[1:16:31] hallelujah when the bible said he that
[1:16:33] read it when the vision is made plain
[1:16:35] that's the problem the vision is not
[1:16:37] plain
[1:16:38] like i said this morning brother bannon
[1:16:40] didn't say it like this he didn't say
[1:16:42] when the bride comes to know who jesus
[1:16:44] is
[1:16:46] he didn't say that or when the bride
[1:16:48] comes to know who the father is
[1:16:50] he said when the bride comes to know who
[1:16:52] she is
[1:16:54] then the rapture will take place so the
[1:16:56] emphasis is on the bride
[1:16:59] you must come to know who you are by way
[1:17:02] of the scripture and by way of prophecy
[1:17:05] hallelujah because once you come to know
[1:17:08] and how you going to know
[1:17:10] how you're going to know
[1:17:12] who you are
[1:17:14] it takes it took adam
[1:17:17] the first adam
[1:17:18] to tell he eve who she was her name was
[1:17:21] adam at the time
[1:17:22] he said listen you came from me
[1:17:25] god opened me up took a rib out made you
[1:17:29] formed you and now you're me you're born
[1:17:32] and by bone and flesh of my flesh you
[1:17:35] are my wife you came from me
[1:17:38] hallelujah and it took the second adam
[1:17:40] to do the same
[1:17:42] on calvary when god opened up him opened
[1:17:45] him up what was he doing unfolding
[1:17:47] himself because remember i told you that
[1:17:50] when god
[1:17:51] unfolded himself in the man
[1:17:53] he rested
[1:17:59] but there was a foal of adam that had
[1:18:01] had been opened
[1:18:03] and all of the angels and everybody else
[1:18:05] was probably surprised
[1:18:07] here is god male and female
[1:18:11] oh come on somebody and you say well
[1:18:13] what do you mean brother you got to
[1:18:15] understand the godhead is something more
[1:18:17] than just a trinity
[1:18:20] hallelujah it's more than that
[1:18:23] amen
[1:18:24] god unfolding himself and we realized
[1:18:27] that if it could just have gone on it
[1:18:29] wouldn't have been just that but what
[1:18:32] god god had to redeem eve
[1:18:34] he had to redeem her
[1:18:36] in order to be complete
[1:18:40] amen he cannot be complete without us
[1:18:43] and we cannot be completed without him
[1:18:47] this is why paul said think it's not
[1:18:49] strange thinking not strange hallelujah
[1:18:52] when temptation try you you're going to
[1:18:54] be tried amen
[1:18:56] but he also said listen don't even don't
[1:18:59] even think it's difficult you shouldn't
[1:19:01] be difficult the bible says let this
[1:19:03] mind be in you
[1:19:04] that was also in christ jesus
[1:19:07] who thought it not robbery
[1:19:10] to be equal with god
[1:19:12] the problem is we fear
[1:19:14] we fear we're going to fail
[1:19:16] you'll never learn how to ride a bike
[1:19:21] if you're afraid of falling
[1:19:23] you're gonna fall
[1:19:24] you'll never learn how to roller skate
[1:19:29] if you're afraid to fall
[1:19:31] you're never especially ice skating
[1:19:33] you'll never learn how to ice skate
[1:19:36] if you are afraid to fall
[1:19:38] falling is part of the process
[1:19:42] but the same god that allows you to fall
[1:19:45] is the same god that picks you up
[1:19:48] y'all understand me it's a growth
[1:19:50] process it is what god expects to happen
[1:19:53] that's why he put you in flesh
[1:19:56] because he knew the flesh had a tendency
[1:19:58] to fall he let it fall so he can express
[1:20:02] his attributes
[1:20:05] is that right he wasn't father to the
[1:20:07] angels he was god to the angels but he
[1:20:10] needed sons and daughters to be a father
[1:20:14] and in this thing he's been being our
[1:20:16] father he's nurturing us he's taking
[1:20:19] care of us is that right
[1:20:21] oh god have mercy
[1:20:24] how are you going to go any further
[1:20:27] if you just settle for religion
[1:20:30] you just said well i'm in the message
[1:20:32] you know well
[1:20:33] if you know one of my daughters said to
[1:20:36] me if i'm elected elected then god will
[1:20:38] do it uh-huh
[1:20:40] wrong attitude
[1:20:42] that don't work
[1:20:43] if you're elected you're going to do it
[1:20:46] because god will inspire you to do it
[1:20:49] hallelujah people think oh when i get
[1:20:52] i'm bright and you filthy no you're not
[1:20:55] if you are then you need a revival
[1:21:00] and the revival is getting the trash out
[1:21:01] of your life
[1:21:03] come on somebody
[1:21:05] i'm anticipating i'm exciting i'm
[1:21:08] excited amen because i see where god is
[1:21:10] bringing us into the very image and
[1:21:12] likeness of god and he's doing it right
[1:21:14] now right under the nose of what we call
[1:21:16] the message
[1:21:17] while everybody else is out there
[1:21:19] fighting
[1:21:20] taking the quotes and fighting over them
[1:21:23] nonsense it shows that those who are
[1:21:25] fighting with quotes don't understand
[1:21:27] their revelation they have no idea of
[1:21:31] who jesus christ is most of all they
[1:21:33] don't know have an idea of who they are
[1:21:37] it's the truth
[1:21:38] but they'll yet lead the people
[1:21:42] blindly
[1:21:44] like the pharisees and the sadducees
[1:21:47] and when the true jesus come by they'll
[1:21:49] call him fanatical
[1:21:51] you understand me you say oh brother
[1:21:53] brooks like like the people say well if
[1:21:55] you say jesus christ came in 1963 that
[1:21:59] cloud or whatever then brother branham
[1:22:01] said that he's he's coming in the
[1:22:03] corporal body see what people don't
[1:22:05] understand god
[1:22:07] interprets his own word don't you dare
[1:22:10] tell god what to do
[1:22:12] he does it the way he wants to
[1:22:15] and at what point in time he brings the
[1:22:17] corporate body that's his business and
[1:22:20] if he shouldn't do it who's going to
[1:22:21] tell you
[1:22:24] oh my god
[1:22:26] like i said to you the other day
[1:22:29] however god does it all i'm looking for
[1:22:32] is to be in there
[1:22:34] i don't care if he's coming on a white
[1:22:35] horse
[1:22:36] i don't care what he's coming on a
[1:22:38] chariot i don't care as long as he come
[1:22:41] and i see him
[1:22:43] see we fight over childish things
[1:22:47] right
[1:22:48] no no mama i want that red bubblegum no
[1:22:51] that's my favorite color you can have
[1:22:53] the blue no i don't want the blue i want
[1:22:55] the red that's childish
[1:23:01] but that's what we do children
[1:23:05] and that's what i was trying to tell the
[1:23:06] people of god when when jericho was
[1:23:08] being conquered there was no little
[1:23:10] children in there making mama
[1:23:12] cry i mean you know worrying mama and
[1:23:14] all that you know tugging on her you
[1:23:16] know are we there yet
[1:23:19] no there was nothing like that they were
[1:23:21] grown they were matured people that god
[1:23:23] had chosen to do what keep silent
[1:23:29] hold the mystery
[1:23:31] don't tell nobody
[1:23:34] jericho don't need to know what we're
[1:23:35] doing
[1:23:36] you just keep on marching
[1:23:38] and at the time i call for the shout i
[1:23:40] want you to give it all you got
[1:23:43] y'all understand me
[1:23:44] it wasn't the shout that brought it down
[1:23:46] it was god in the shout
[1:23:48] out and you say well brother what are
[1:23:50] you trying to say i'm trying to say now
[1:23:52] there is such thing as eternal security
[1:23:55] eternal security
[1:23:57] and that turn of security is when you've
[1:23:59] got the holy ghost
[1:24:00] and the holy ghost got you
[1:24:03] right that's what brother adam said it's
[1:24:05] not it's not right to say i got the holy
[1:24:06] ghost he said the correct way is to say
[1:24:08] the holy ghost got me
[1:24:10] amen right and as long as the holy ghost
[1:24:13] have you you have eternal security
[1:24:16] ah lord have mercy that's the truth
[1:24:19] anyhow
[1:24:20] and we're baptized into the body now let
[1:24:23] me say it like this because there have
[1:24:24] been many who have gotten so
[1:24:25] intellectual to the holy ghost don't
[1:24:27] mean a thing
[1:24:28] but you still need it
[1:24:30] now however you get it that's up to you
[1:24:32] and in the holy ghost
[1:24:35] right because the bible said when you
[1:24:36] get the holy ghost it's not that you
[1:24:38] receive it is that god received you
[1:24:41] amen
[1:24:43] god is pleased with you and he gives you
[1:24:45] the holy ghost right
[1:24:47] now the thing is when it comes to the
[1:24:49] mighty angel coming down i think a lot
[1:24:51] of times we don't even understand it but
[1:24:53] at that time
[1:24:55] something changed in william branham
[1:24:59] william branham began to talk about the
[1:25:00] waves and talking about the the radios
[1:25:03] and all of these kind of things and he
[1:25:04] talks about how that they have a a
[1:25:07] crystal that can pick these things up
[1:25:09] and then show it to the people
[1:25:11] he was more than just a prophet people
[1:25:13] of god
[1:25:14] he really was he was a covenant angel he
[1:25:16] was doing something that he himself
[1:25:18] didn't even realize he had been ordained
[1:25:20] to do it until god revealed it to him
[1:25:23] right
[1:25:24] so now he's in a position that he could
[1:25:26] literally
[1:25:27] up
[1:25:29] how could i say you know how radio is
[1:25:31] your man maybe a thousand miles he's on
[1:25:33] a talk show the radio catches it and it
[1:25:36] sounds like the man is directly in your
[1:25:38] living room
[1:25:40] that's what brother branham became
[1:25:42] he became the radio for the message
[1:25:45] and when god after 63 it was god himself
[1:25:49] speaking oh lord have mercy bypassing
[1:25:53] the flesh of a man
[1:25:55] the thoughts of a man y'all hear what
[1:25:57] i'm saying
[1:25:59] that's why people don't understand and
[1:26:00] even in the time when the when brother
[1:26:02] brandon was stuttering he looked like he
[1:26:04] wasn't didn't know how to answer things
[1:26:06] that was still god
[1:26:10] god was doing all of those things to
[1:26:12] confound the wise
[1:26:16] making them stumble this can't be a true
[1:26:18] servant of god he's seventh grade
[1:26:20] education he don't know what he's
[1:26:22] talking about his his english ain't as
[1:26:24] good
[1:26:25] that had nothing to do with it
[1:26:28] hallelujah
[1:26:29] the point is he got the point across
[1:26:32] and many times even when it came to to
[1:26:35] to the uh the seven seals and i told you
[1:26:37] about this another he always the whole
[1:26:39] thing is parables it's
[1:26:41] it's in a way that only god can reveal
[1:26:44] to you what's being said
[1:26:46] and even in the messages yay god
[1:26:50] lines certain messages up
[1:26:53] right
[1:26:54] you know god doesn't change his mind
[1:26:56] about his word
[1:26:57] huh
[1:26:58] the the
[1:26:59] every message title was ordained and
[1:27:02] inspired by god so if you have a
[1:27:05] question look at the titles because many
[1:27:07] times whatever you're looking for is in
[1:27:09] there
[1:27:11] and you know you say well brothers what
[1:27:13] are you what are you saying
[1:27:14] so i'm trying to tell us that listen
[1:27:17] right now jesus said in uh saint john 30
[1:27:20] 10 30 he says i and the father
[1:27:24] are one
[1:27:25] we're one
[1:27:26] and they wanted to stone him
[1:27:29] because they said here was a man making
[1:27:31] himself god
[1:27:32] then brother brethren says no no it
[1:27:34] wasn't a man making himself god it was
[1:27:35] god making himself a man
[1:27:37] but the day must come
[1:27:40] that you and i will have to say
[1:27:42] when you see me you see jesus
[1:27:46] [Music]
[1:27:48] huh
[1:27:49] because brother branham could have
[1:27:51] started he could have said that
[1:27:53] you know he was such a humble man he was
[1:27:54] just like jesus he was just like john
[1:27:56] when they asked him questions he went
[1:27:58] around the bush to answer you know what
[1:28:00] i mean he never gave something that he
[1:28:01] never gave a direct answer to now when
[1:28:03] it came to the woman at the well because
[1:28:05] she was seed
[1:28:07] she said i know when the messiah come
[1:28:09] you know he's going to tell us of these
[1:28:10] things he said i am he because she was
[1:28:13] seed right but to those who were not
[1:28:15] seeded from them
[1:28:18] hallelujah and then rebuked them in in
[1:28:21] the long and in term he said my sheep
[1:28:23] hears my voice and a stranger they will
[1:28:25] not follow so you got to understand that
[1:28:28] the message or the seven thunders are
[1:28:30] seven seals and i showed you how the
[1:28:32] earthling vessel had two two two to to
[1:28:35] to uh
[1:28:36] uh and subscriptions there
[1:28:38] inscription subscription however you
[1:28:39] want to put it and one was sealed and
[1:28:41] the other one was not well we've seen
[1:28:44] the one we've seen the healings the
[1:28:46] deliverances and all of that stuff but
[1:28:47] one thing that they did not and could
[1:28:49] not receive that jesus christ was god
[1:28:53] or the son of god
[1:28:55] that was one of the early messages or
[1:28:57] revelation that god gave to his
[1:28:59] disciples or peter he said who do men
[1:29:01] say i am i the son of man i am the
[1:29:03] christ the son of the living god peter
[1:29:05] accepted it
[1:29:07] huh but when it comes down to william
[1:29:09] branham we failed to see that that was
[1:29:11] god in him
[1:29:13] i don't worship a man
[1:29:15] don't get me wrong but that was god
[1:29:17] there were times that god
[1:29:19] almighty stood there
[1:29:21] even in in in some of the services the
[1:29:24] tongs interpretation moses is here
[1:29:27] jesus is here elijah is here all three
[1:29:30] in one
[1:29:31] because christ was all
[1:29:36] and i'm saying all of these things to
[1:29:37] say okay if god has gone out of his way
[1:29:40] to bring this message understand what
[1:29:42] we're saying
[1:29:44] everybody couldn't go behind the veil
[1:29:48] god
[1:29:49] rent the veil from top to bottom so that
[1:29:52] you and i can go in
[1:29:54] and brother bam said there was a time if
[1:29:56] you tried to go in it was death
[1:29:58] he said but it's death now if you don't
[1:30:01] y'all understand that do you oh my god
[1:30:04] do you understand that you cannot remain
[1:30:08] the way you are
[1:30:09] and expect to see a rapture amen
[1:30:14] is there anything you can do about it
[1:30:17] believe what has been preached
[1:30:20] and call on the living god that can make
[1:30:22] the changes
[1:30:24] because you can't do it
[1:30:26] hallelujah you understand me
[1:30:29] but you gotta like he said lay in the
[1:30:31] presence of the son
[1:30:33] you and i have been called is that right
[1:30:36] do i have it wrong i thought the message
[1:30:38] said we are messiahs
[1:30:41] huh
[1:30:43] anointed one did he say that
[1:30:45] did the word of god say ye are gods
[1:30:48] i know that sound but you see it take
[1:30:50] only the bride cause she's got a certain
[1:30:52] crystal
[1:30:54] she's got something in her that will
[1:30:56] cause her to receive this
[1:30:58] and press toward it
[1:31:00] um to make a long story short i'm not
[1:31:03] i'm not going to go any further but i'm
[1:31:04] going to close at this
[1:31:06] you know when when when when adam fell
[1:31:10] satan had rule from then on he became
[1:31:12] the god of this world now he's the god
[1:31:14] of this evil age right
[1:31:17] and when when
[1:31:18] because see what one of the things that
[1:31:20] god wanted he wanted to put them in a
[1:31:23] flesh
[1:31:24] that had the ability to fall
[1:31:27] but he wanted that word to have
[1:31:30] preeminence of the flesh
[1:31:32] so that it would never fall
[1:31:34] you understand me
[1:31:35] so god comes along and adam and ee fell
[1:31:38] and adam went out willfully and did it
[1:31:40] like christ would did for us
[1:31:42] but but the whole redemption plan was to
[1:31:44] be
[1:31:45] bring restitution
[1:31:47] god never lost a son nor daughter ever
[1:31:52] i'm gonna say that again
[1:31:54] god never lost a true son and a daughter
[1:31:59] you say well what do you mean what about
[1:32:01] all those people in the days of noah
[1:32:03] they were in the image of adam
[1:32:06] never in the image of god
[1:32:08] yet god still calls them sons of god
[1:32:12] when the sons of god saw the daughters
[1:32:14] of men that they were fair took it upon
[1:32:16] their wives huh
[1:32:18] but really they just looked like they
[1:32:21] were
[1:32:22] and that's how it is today people look
[1:32:25] like they are
[1:32:27] the only thing that makes you and i
[1:32:29] different
[1:32:30] is what's on the inside
[1:32:33] where the seed was planted
[1:32:35] hallelujah it is the seed of god that
[1:32:39] distinguishes you from that of the
[1:32:42] serpent
[1:32:44] that's it
[1:32:45] that's it
[1:32:46] so i'm saying all of these things to you
[1:32:49] as believers
[1:32:51] if you think
[1:32:53] you're gonna you're gonna be raptured
[1:32:55] laying up there in leia this here
[1:32:58] you got another thought coming
[1:33:00] cause
[1:33:01] laodicea has already been spewing out of
[1:33:03] god's mouth
[1:33:04] she has already been judged
[1:33:07] and most of them have already received
[1:33:09] the mark of the beast that's why they
[1:33:10] can't hear this message
[1:33:13] hallelujah is that right so you and i we
[1:33:16] must say oh brother brooks i'm telling
[1:33:18] you we are i want to say like this we
[1:33:20] are in an eighth age can i read a quote
[1:33:23] in the future home
[1:33:24] brethren say we're living through all
[1:33:26] these types in here but when you hit the
[1:33:29] eighth you go into eternity you don't
[1:33:32] come by laws
[1:33:34] and rituals
[1:33:35] and orders you come by predestination
[1:33:39] and predestination do what look back to
[1:33:42] four knowledge
[1:33:44] hallelujah oh come on somebody
[1:33:47] see and there is a genuine holy
[1:33:50] convocation see and we're ending
[1:33:54] the seventh church age
[1:33:58] the church eight the pentecostal age do
[1:34:00] you see it we're entering
[1:34:02] that holy convocation we are entering
[1:34:06] into that real genuine eternity where
[1:34:09] the church is called not to some station
[1:34:12] some denomination but into eternity with
[1:34:16] their eternal king see
[1:34:18] we don't have it all
[1:34:20] no such a thing as days and things and
[1:34:24] times and you know what i'm saying
[1:34:25] everybody get crazy about christmas and
[1:34:27] easter's and all that
[1:34:31] ain't nothing wrong with it that's what
[1:34:32] y'all want to do
[1:34:34] but you know my thing is there ain't no
[1:34:36] such thing as an eternity
[1:34:39] we don't have customs like that
[1:34:41] we don't have that in eternity oh come
[1:34:44] on somebody that was seventh church aid
[1:34:46] stuff
[1:34:49] the bride has something higher than that
[1:34:51] oh come on somebody what she's free
[1:34:55] she's not under any man's bondage
[1:34:58] we're not like israel and the law
[1:35:02] we're free amen
[1:35:06] you passed into eternity where you come
[1:35:08] from
[1:35:09] you was there
[1:35:10] to begin with
[1:35:15] is that okay
[1:35:16] i'm gonna read another one
[1:35:18] the word fell on the day of pentecost
[1:35:20] with not
[1:35:21] will the word
[1:35:22] fall or fail on the day of pentecost
[1:35:24] will not work this day no sir
[1:35:27] that was for pentecost this is for the
[1:35:30] bride
[1:35:31] going home of the bride we've got
[1:35:34] something different the pentecostal
[1:35:37] presented that again we're in the broad
[1:35:40] age no more than the word of noah would
[1:35:43] have worked in the days of moses no more
[1:35:46] than the moses law would have worked in
[1:35:48] the days of paul here he tried to tell
[1:35:50] them you are dead to that and you cannot
[1:35:54] have that church unto you who i'm
[1:35:58] speaking to tonight across the nation if
[1:36:01] you're separated from the denomination
[1:36:04] and all the filth and things of the
[1:36:05] world and all those things that keep you
[1:36:08] in man-made creeds and orders and things
[1:36:12] like that y'all looked at me like i was
[1:36:14] crazy when i said christmas and easter
[1:36:18] huh
[1:36:21] i'm just reading what he said
[1:36:23] and all those things that keep you in
[1:36:25] man-made creeds and orders and things
[1:36:28] like that you separate yourself look up
[1:36:32] get ready the fire is going to fall one
[1:36:35] of these days god is going to let him
[1:36:38] come
[1:36:39] and
[1:36:41] a sight to behold would you be ready
[1:36:44] when he comes would you be ready to go
[1:36:46] up with him when he comes
[1:36:49] the secret rapture of the supernatural
[1:36:51] bride shall be
[1:36:52] more from mortal to immortality be
[1:36:55] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[1:36:58] an eye
[1:36:59] he which are alive and remain shall not
[1:37:02] present prevent them which are asleep
[1:37:06] huh
[1:37:07] so i'm throwing out a lot of little
[1:37:08] things and and therefore by god's grace
[1:37:11] we'll we'll try to do a little better on
[1:37:13] sunday if the lord tarry on wednesday
[1:37:15] but my point is we're trying to get you
[1:37:17] to see you got to move forward you got
[1:37:20] to move from where you are
[1:37:22] and all of the things that you allow
[1:37:24] satan to occupy your time with i'm not
[1:37:26] saying anything wrong with easter
[1:37:29] you know that's death burial and
[1:37:30] resurrection which should be celebrated
[1:37:32] every every day right
[1:37:35] you know even brother branham said it
[1:37:36] becomes so commercialized with easter
[1:37:38] bunnies and all that kind of stuff
[1:37:39] easter egg whenever you seen a rabbit
[1:37:42] with an egg
[1:37:43] but people do it around this message
[1:37:46] yes they should do
[1:37:50] we we're not going to go there but my
[1:37:52] point is
[1:37:54] we got to get rid of all this nonsense
[1:37:58] get rid of the nonsense
[1:38:01] i'm gonna stop there
[1:38:03] yeah i'm gonna stop there
[1:38:05] oh god you you and i must understand
[1:38:08] that uh
[1:38:09] we're living in the last days
[1:38:12] and god is calling us to a higher ground
[1:38:18] he is
[1:38:19] calling us to a higher ground what we
[1:38:21] have been doing and allowing ourselves
[1:38:22] to
[1:38:23] enter be entertained with it has to stop
[1:38:27] if you want to make a rapture
[1:38:31] you know i i can truly say two three
[1:38:33] years ago years ago maybe i was doing
[1:38:36] little things that i shouldn't have been
[1:38:37] doing but i'm not doing them now
[1:38:40] why because changes the word changes you
[1:38:44] and when you find yourself falling into
[1:38:46] a system of worship
[1:38:48] you got to know it
[1:38:50] you you must know it you're coming to a
[1:38:53] message church you're hearing preachers
[1:38:54] preach and all of that stuff and yet
[1:38:57] you're lacking power to overcome
[1:39:02] y'all know i'm speaking the truth
[1:39:05] and you and i must understand that if
[1:39:07] that be the case something's wrong
[1:39:09] if the mighty angel has come down where
[1:39:11] do you think he is
[1:39:13] he's here
[1:39:15] and he's here to help us to minister to
[1:39:17] us that's what brother brown said he
[1:39:18] said that head
[1:39:20] the power and everything of god will
[1:39:22] flow from the head to the body
[1:39:25] but in order for that to happen it must
[1:39:27] be connected
[1:39:30] there got to be a connection somewhere
[1:39:33] and you and i must understand that here
[1:39:35] was when christ came in 1963
[1:39:39] call it an appearance whatever y'all
[1:39:40] want to call it it's okay it happened
[1:39:43] and when it came amen by god's grace it
[1:39:46] brought an open book
[1:39:48] now what is the open book then that book
[1:39:51] amen has come to to me is that right to
[1:39:55] get abroad ready
[1:39:57] for the rapture
