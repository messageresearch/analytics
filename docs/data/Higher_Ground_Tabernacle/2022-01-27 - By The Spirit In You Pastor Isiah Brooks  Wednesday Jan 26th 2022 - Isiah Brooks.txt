this cold weather amen but i feel like when we do our daily chores amen we venture out into the cold so if we do it for the natural we need to do it for the spirit amen amen god is good to us i've gotta this is kind of like a i say things like that and i never follow through but i like to think that i can and i will when it comes to series and all of that i i jump from one place to another but by the grace of god we i was thinking uh since sunday basically uh how how do you express to the people what is required and not only what is required how are we going to uh meet those requirements how can we do it uh so hopefully tonight uh will be the beginning of something where our eyes and uh uh and will be enlightening enlightened in our understanding uh you know will come to a place where we'll know how anyway as we stand let us turn to second peter second peter the third chapter and we'll begin reading at the 17th verse i was told that they had a really good time there in iowa city and so i'm happy for what took place there on sunday and appreciate the brother isaac for the great sacrifice of going down there by god's grace ii peter 3. that must be first pete i think i got it wrong i do i'm in first peter that's why i won't work beginning at the 17th verse he therefore be loved seeing ye know these things be before i would be aware less ye also being led away with the air of the wicked fall from your own steadfastness but grow in grace and in the knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ to whom be glory both now and forever amen let us pray heavenly father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so real to us without you jesus christ we can do nothing man we understand lord god that everything moves by your power amen you move with us you move in us you move through us and we so thank you father god for being the god that you are knowing that you're the only true and living god and there is no other beside amen amen father i so thank you for your mercy and your grace for that you used to open our eyes and to broaden our understanding of who we are and i pray this night that you would have mercy upon us and open our understanding to the scriptures and i pray father god that even those things that i failed to say that you were quickened amen to the hearts and the minds of your people granted father in your lovely name jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated i was thinking uh and have been thinking about that message that i preached on sunday and uh i can truly say that every bit of it was from god amen and but you know if in the carnal mind in the mind if if you catch it in the wrong uh inspiration you're not you won't understand what god is saying amen let me say it like this it's not him that willeth nor he that running but it's god we'll show his mercy amen and i want you to understand that if you take the message that has been preached and you take it in the legalistic way thinking that you're going to make a man perfect enough to to make heaven you missed it amen the element of this whole entire message is grace and you must understand that it's grace that saves you amen you know the great grace that takes you there amen first of all we're living in the time of the rapture this is why we've been preaching the way we preach and i'm going to take this kind of go with this kind of pace if this is okay and we must understand our understanding of the rapture is not like the denominational understanding of the rapture that we're going we're dealing with an unfair god that he's just going to leave son behind and take some god only takes those whom we predestinated amen and those that belongs to him amen he's not going to steal somebody else's children you understand me he only come for his own amen salvation is only for the children of god and the bible says that the lord knoweth them that are his amen and we must understand that the rapture is as a process we know the bible said in a moment in the twinkling of an eye we're going to be changed but we've got to get to that moment amen and it is a process it's a coming out of egypt going through the wilderness going through canaan land and then possessing your inheritance the children of israel is a sure type of what we call the transition of the rapture that we'll go through uh it's like matthew 28 19. god called five wise and five foolish and of course in the denominational realm we believed for years that the five foolish were lost but until this message we came to find out that the wise and the foolish was made out of the same material but god cut a pattern amen a piece of cloth in a pattern way that that left a remnant amen and that remnant though it be from the same material uh was not included into the pattern amen and if you want to say it like this he cut out a pattern of the bride amen and those that were not included into that pattern were still saved god didn't throw the material away no amen but we find out that god gives them white robes after the great tribulation hallelujah amen so we must understand that sometimes people think that when god said uh two would be in the bed and one taken and the other one left and often time we correlate that to a husband and wife but not necessarily so that's not what the bible says amen two would be in the bed one taken the other one left he did not say two would be in the same bed amen he said two would be in the bed but it brings such a fear on people that's right amen and the insecurity when we add things like that he said there'll be those two in the field one taken and one left and what was he doing he was basically showing the time zones where some would be sleeping others would be working and that's what he was working with one would be a bride and one will not be a bride however it may be god interprets his own word amen but you got to understand this the bible said that god's sheep heareth his voice and a stranger they will not follow and understand when he were talking about strangers he was talking about the pharisees and the sadducees the herodians and all the denominational of those that day amen because you got to realize there were those who could hear his voice those who were in those systems like nicodemus yep amen or like lazarus and his sisters they were orphans but they were in those systems and and and when they heard the voice of jesus they left those systems and followed the shepherd amen a peter james john paul all of them who were so locked into those systems but once they heard the voice of their day amen they moved with that voice amen and god never talks about their failures or their faults but one thing in the new testament we come to realize is that those that were truly chosen of god received the baptism of the holy ghost amen and he started with the least and went all the way up to what the man called saul of paul when one thing about paul a saul he had to humble himself amen and become a fool in so much so paul says i worship in the way they call heresy and that way heresy is called crazy and that was the standard of true believers through the seven church ages amen they worshiped in the way people called crazy the lutherans were crazy to the catholics yep amen is that right the wesleyans were crazy to the lutherans the pentecostals were crazy to the westlands and now those who claim to be in the message are crazy to the pentecostals amen and god continued to move he's a god of progression he never stops amen you understand me how would god require you to do something that he know you can't do for thousands of years men were fallen under the penalty of death so much they hated death they was afraid of death and they understood that their righteousness could never make it amen even those who were under the law they did everything in the love but see they died like almost hoping and only those who had a revelation of what was taking place they understood they'll die in faith believing that the redeemer will come because we need a redeemer amen we need a savior there you understand me the the person redeeming you is the one that receives the honor amen the one who saves you is the one who receives the honor because there's nothing you could do god picked you up like a dirty cop yes sir he justified you amen he cleansed you up like a dirty cop he sanctified you he gave you the holy ghost amen he filled you with his spirit he puts you into service amen this is not a man-made thing amen this is all about the lord jesus christ according to the scripture romans 11 34 says for who have known the mind of god of the lord or who have been his counselor and i love that because how can you cancel god when it comes to your life when you yourself don't know your life you can't govern your life you can't even control what you're doing that's right you need a controller amen this is where the holy ghost comes in amen because you and yourself you can't stop yourself hallelujah it takes god in you to interpret his word through you amen you can say i'm bright all you want to but until the holy ghost comes in and begins to live his life through you that is the only thing that significant evidence i could say when jesus says in that day you'll know i'm in the father the fathers in me and i am you amen ephesians 1 4 says and i'm going to not going to be long but ephesians 4 1 4 says according as he have chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love this is his high calling this is his standard hallelujah that we would be without blame and how many of us know what how to be holy throughout the church ages they've tried to be holy amen it's true catholics the priests the nuns they dress in a manner that people think is holy that's not the holiness of god amen but people in their minds that get this concept even in the message that if i look poor and destitute and everything is you know not magic or unfitting or whatever the case may be i'm really looking holy that's not holiness amen holiness doesn't even uh care if you're skinny if you're fat if you're tall if you're short if you're ugly if you're handsome if you're beautiful whatever it may be that holiness it just doesn't care because what holiness is is having the holy god on the inside and god doesn't look at your way you look says oh you know that person looked just like i you know yeah you good enough let me go ahead on it it's not that it's that he chose you you were in him amen now a lot of times we we think oh well this natural man was no no no i'm talking about the spirit man amen god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth not just a spirit his spirit see it's god in you as you've heard me say many times it's it's not the mountain that's holy it's the holy god on the mountain is that right your flesh could never enter heaven no matter how good you live on earth amen no matter how you keep yourself you can walk perfectly listen paul said i was blameless there was nothing in my life that somebody could point to and said i'd done wrong hello but paul had to be born again amen you know because he was born a sinner amen amen hallelujah god doesn't care about your self-righteousness the bible says self-righteousness before god is like filthy rags understand where i'm going with this because you and i must understand death will strike us it will give us a reward it meant that we won't expect amen if we don't have his life in us oh come on somebody lord amen his life is the only life that death will pass over amen we sing that song let the death angel pass for the token has land we we've received the token and we've received the token which is his holy spirit that's the only thing death recognizing on us amen is that right it's the truth and you and i must understand this this whole plan of salvation was to restore what we call the title deed amen back to mankind amen thousands of years we've struggled we we tried our best to live what we call holy lives and you know in the appearance and listen what the law did to those pharisees and sadducees amen when jesus came to their day he said they were all dead men's bones because the law will kill you amen the law will suck all the joy of god out of you because you will always feel it like you in bondage it's true when the bible said it is the spirit that sets you free amen you understand me because when you receive the holy ghost that is god's approval he accepts you amen no matter what the devil says it tried to do he could never take you out of his hands amen glory to god thank you lord we must understand by god's grace it's by his spirit in you and i said that last week you know the only thing that you're going to take with you is character right it is not yours it's his character amen yes sir is his virtue is his knowledge is his temperance is his patience is his godliness it's christ's nature in you that's the mystery of the entire book that god himself wanted to replenish himself that's right amen thank you lord that's god and everybody is it's given to any and everybody who wants it but you know what most of us do not want to go through the labor we must labor is that right hebrews i think the fourth chapter whichever it is he says we must labor to enter into his what rest right it's like a woman in travail she knows she's carrying a baby you might know within yourself you got christ on the inside but let me tell you something you need him to be reflecting amen you need a life that when people see you they see him it must come to life in you and it takes laboring and this is where we have fallen short around the message because we've adopted the baptist doctrine you believe that god sent a prophet if you you believe the message no you really believe it you're going to act upon it amen because brother branham preached the holy ghost and he preached the statue of a perfect man and these are things that denominational people knows nothing about they won't they don't even know how to approach it when all we need is to know that it's been quicker the life has been quicker amen and once the life is quickened we feed the life that's it we grow up into him we feed and worship that life in us which is the word living word amen the holy spirit is the word and so the more you eat the more you feed him you say oh i can't change it's because you're not feeding on the bleeding bloody word of the son of man amen this message came to transform us amen and by the time jesus christ as he will interpret it it'll take a moment amen just a twinkling that's right we didn't know we had no no knowledge of this rapture we had no understanding of what you call the changing of the body we had no understanding that when the rapture begins to really take place there be those who have fallen asleep already in christ that would awaken and those of us who have been ordained those of us who have that character those of us who've allowed christ to bring us to a a state of perfection if i would say just prior to perfection however we want to put it but we'll have those virtues in us we'll have this developer nature and we'll be a different how can i say it because our dimensions will change amen amen that's all i'm telling you i'm telling you you began to see things that you could not see because of its nature you understand me you'll be able to understand things that you never could understand because of his nature amen in you and to the world you'll look crazy but you know what you're looking at amen how can you see something they cannot see because your eyes the veil will be lifted is that the scripture when it turns to the lord the veil will be lifted because when israel saw moses what did they see they just saw a prophet but he veiled himself they couldn't see you know the light of god or what the transformation was and the bible said that that was just what that was a glory but what about this glory amen that god is bringing us to uh to transform us so much so that uh like i said it's not like we'll be shining like a light bulb you know we're not going to have all of this but you understand what i'm saying the light of god will be seen only by those who can see the light amen because remember there was a many people in brother brown's ministry and the pillar fire would come and many of them couldn't see the pill of fire but then yet there were those ordained to see it amen is that all right so let me go on according to i want you to understand because you gotta see this you gotta you gotta i see it and and all i know is that uh one of the tapes uh i want you to listen to god's provided way for this day 1964 february 0-5 god provided way for this listen closely listen closely to it meditate on it because god has given you the answer amen for your day amen and this is a fresh tape that i began to listen to and i thought lord i need something and the lord directed me to that particular tape so here you go listen so ii corinthians 3 17-18 says this now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty amen but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image you hear me listen to it closely the glory of the lord as in the glass the glory of the lord are changed we are changed into the same y'all understand what the same means the same image from glory to glory even as by the same spirit of the lord amen and you say from glory to glory each church age had their own glory amen each one of them uh uh uh expressed a virtue of god right each one of them had to go through trials and temptations and battles after battles to obtain those virtues it wasn't just given to them they had to fight for every every inch of their journey and you and i we've got to fight for every inch of it it's not just going to be given to you god shows you your faults he said well i don't know yes he does every time we make a mistake every time we air he makes us know and the reason why he makes us know so that you can see what's in your heart amen but he also let you know it doesn't have to stay that way because prayer changed things that's why the enemy fights us all in the way of prayer amen ii corinthians 3 15-16 says the veil remains upon their hearts what veil look at israel the veil is still there they can't see jesus all they can see is moses i didn't even mean to say that like that but that's the truth all they could see is the prophet they couldn't see the greater prophet they missed him because they were always looking at abraham always looking at moses and here was jesus in plain views you must understand this message brings jesus christ into plain view you must see him and if you can't see him the veil still remains amen amen amen thank you lord and don't tell me because if you try to tell these other church ages those who have been fruits of that particular age that they're blind they won't believe you they can't believe you they don't want to believe that it could have gotten any better than what they have but you must understand god didn't stop there he didn't stop at the catholic he didn't stop with the methodists he didn't stop with the pentecostals he keeps moving amen and now he calls a bride out of church age out of denominations out of the systems of law out of the systems that are made by man creeds and dogmas into a place of liberty amen how come it's free how come it's liberty because it's christ in you amen and the word cannot be bound amen glory hallelujah ii corinthians 3 and 2 says ye are our epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men amen and so you got to understand he didn't say written in your head is it in your heart and that is the throne room of god amen god comes into your heart it is the throne room of god in your heart and there in your heart he rules you amen he talks to you from your heart amen not your head amen from your heart for as much as you are manifestly declared you understand me it comes to a place in your life is no skepticism it's real it's what you are manifesting whatever spirit in you is manifesting itself through you if it's a holy spirit it must manifest holiness if it's an unclean spirit it will manifest uncleanness but you and i must understand that we cannot stop amen we must die we must rot to all our ideas all of our thoughts and all of our fears and most of us are afraid to continue because we don't know what's next you've not been this way before the pentecostals have never come this way before no no organization the domination has ever come this way before this is a new way this is a way that's been hidden from the eyes of men but is now being revealed to those paid amen those that such would learn amen and understand that the hallelujah oh my god understand that the this way is has been hidden even from a lot of people who claim to know the message god doesn't he doesn't make mistakes you know why he so hated the deeds of the nicolaitans because he was headship he was the head he was the husband to the church and he was not going to allow men or any organizations to take his position he hates it it's an abomination you ever think about what happened to the eunuch when he got saved where did he go i guarantee you he's in heaven right now why because god's business was the feeling with the holy ghost and he did what he did amen paul in them you know they didn't have literature or anybody above them that could help actually tell them what to do the bible said they were led by the spirit that's right you got to have the spirit of god in you now to be led by he's not talking about being led by your human thoughts and ideas you're talking about being led by the spirit and when i think about ye epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as you are manifestly declared to be the epistles of christ amen ministered by us written not with ink now paul says i have delivered a word to you that was able to penetrate and go beyond the outer court it went beyond the spirit man but it went right into the soul and now god has made your heart a fleshly heart a heart that that that his word is written on amen now i understand you the bible says as a man thinketh in his heart so is he can you imagine if you could really grasp the fact that the holy ghost is in you and that he is in your heart and think on the things that's why the bible says think on the things think of these things whatsoever honest whatsoever just whatsoever good whatever is a good report think on these things because really that's christ yes amen that's him in your heart amen for as much as she manifested declared to the epistles of christ ministered by the written now paulie says i wrote these things and here come brother branham knowing that he could not deviate from what paul wrote and he said i preached the same message amen so the very seed in which he sold was the very seed that paul sold paul was the alpha and brother branham was the omega right or those men who god used because every uh servant whether it was billy graham or roberts they sold seeds yes amen but in this day we had a seed that was sown by a prophet and a prophet by god's grace cannot he has no ability to sow his own seed he he can only sow the seed of god remember in the old testament they even wanted baal baal to uh balaam to to preach or prophesy something different he said i can't i'm bound by god whatever he says i must say and that's the way it is with every prophet maybe even if it means that they must go to the guillotine for what they say you understand so we're in a day where the spirit of the lord is trying to control us but are we fighting his will and this is where we must die daily you know we we have a battle every day we have a gastimity every day that we have to go through dying to ourselves that the will of god will be done not i will lord but thine be done can you imagine the prophet of god coming in and doing all he did to make sure the seed was planted and that it was come up and then all of a sudden no harvest there is no harvest but not so also it has to be a harvest amen that's part of it there has to be a harvest amen there are those amen who will press into the kingdom amen because it is oppressed y'all know that every day is oppressed i fight the devil every day some battles i win some i lose but one thing for certain i have a goal i'm just not fighting the air beating the air if i don't know where i'm headed i know where i'm headed amen there's something on the inside it's like that rainbow trout amen he doesn't go with the current he goes against the current and he has to travel all the way up the stream amen fighting for his life and then once he gets there to the bedding ground he makes and he dies his whole struggle in life was to die because he understood once i listen we supposed to produce other christians it's not the shepherd that produced christians it's the sheep that produce christians she brings forth christians and you and i our lives are supposed to be so like christ till people will be desiring to be like you amen like they say in that traveling are we there yet no potentially y'all understand what i'm saying amen i didn't know he was going that way but potentially but we and i must understand by god's grace that this is in god's control mayor couldn't say you know what i think i'm going to produce jesus mary didn't even know she was married she didn't even know she was in the scripture she didn't even know she was that virgin that isaiah prophesied amen it took a message from an angel to tell her who she was you understand me and god sent us a messenger he sent us an angel to tell us who we are amen believe it and all we've got to do is says lord be it unto me according to that word that's all she had to say and god took over the rest amen amen that's good it's really that simple we complicate it amen because we don't want to struggle and we don't want to get on our knees and fight until we get into our rest go listen to that tape you can't stop on this religious plane and expect you're going to make it many people will be difficult disappointed because this is a time of pride you got to understand changes you know i've changed we know that the things i used to do i don't do no more the places i used to go i don't go no more we know that but that's not all of it it must come to a place where your mind becomes his mind let this mind be in you that's what he said that was also in christ jesus and what was the mind of christ father i come to do your will amen amen not mine but my whole purpose of life is to do the father's will amen this is what i've been made for no matter what it is no matter what the cost i'm going to listen hear his voice and work to make sure it happens amen amen in the message what shall we do with this jesus call christ 1964 january 26th is that amazing is it day 26 yes sir i just realized that i didn't know when i was writing this down i didn't know it's amazing the evidence as i said the other day we tried to place evidence like luther said believe and walk out uh he said the devil believes too wesleyan said shout when you got it but he found out he didn't penal call says speak in tongues and you got it they didn't christian science says love you got the fruits of the spirit but they haven't they deny the divinity of jesus christ what is the evidence of it listen closely when the spirit that's in you can punctuate every promise with an amen amen and god will confirm it see people people they lead that part out punctuate with an amen but they leave this other part out which says god will confirm it amen in other words you can't fake it that's right amen the statue of a perfect man is is what god gives unto you you battle you go through the hardships to get there but once you get there you can tell somebody i've gone through the battle i'm a witness it's there i partook of it i'm like those joshuas those joshua and caleb that went over there crossed over there i found the graves of the promised land and i'm here to show you you can do it amen and that's where people think well oh my god this is just too hard for me i can't i can't do it no you can't do it and yes it is hard yes it is hard but you got to put in your mind i can do it the bible said you can do all things through christ with strengthen you amen it's christ it's the lord you go back to the holy spirit he strengthens you he is the one that directs you he is the one that gains gives you victory it's not you amen it's god that's right you can do it yes it's the devil telling you you can't do it don't bring back a false report amen when god said you can and you say you can't amen god says you came amen hallelujah hallelujah god will confirm it see that's exactly the way it was with jesus huh that's the way it was with jesus oh yes they had they had all kinds of evidences you can't pin any evidence down to anything but god himself manifesting his word you understand what manifesting is making it come to life in you not somebody else he did it in william branham right he did it in oral robbers and all of the other ones that that move and you know they did god did it but now it's your turn amen and the thing is you can't think god isn't going to drop it in on you those people went through some struggles to get where they were they had some dying out to do we're not on a picnic and oh well it's you know grace and it's going to just happen that's not the way it happens god puts it on you mary said be it unto me according to your word and then god wait till she get fully impressed fully pregnant and says now travel to bethlehem amen yes sir on a donkey sisters y'all know what i can't imagine and then when she gets there there is not a room a stable who's not no perfume in the room flowers nothing convenient how can this be god come on we would say oh surely this is not god you know god wouldn't do this to me and god didn't tell mary don't you know you got a stable waiting on you no he did not he kept all of that hidden step by step they went through the journey and at the end of the day before it was all over three wise men come two years or so afterwards and declare that her birth amen was of god amen think about it see if what we fail to see is that oh we won't reward right off god don't always give you reward he gives you sufferings first stay in tune with him that's all you need to do god's will be done stay in too that's all we need to do you think david being the king had a great time david suffered yes amen and no doubt the devil devil says see how can you be king and look what all you're going through david you were just a young boy now you got to go through all of this yes because god was also building character in david that's what it's all about god building character you can't have character built in you without suffering that's right that's right you gonna suffer if you be of god amen and you're gonna suffer if you be of the devil suffering is something that you can't get out of it is what it is but if you're going to suffer suffer for the name of jesus christ amen suffer for the cause of christ if you've got to suffer i don't know if the lord tarried and i got to go on i don't know how it's going to be but you know what brother brown says i don't want to i don't want the devil to crown me with some mean spirit sir amen i want to go out like a crab you know what i'm saying i don't know if i've always asked the lord i said god i don't know what you're going to do with me i really believe i'm a rapture material but if i gotta die if i gotta go please let it be so that entourage will help him come down and i have a glorious time going out you know i want some witnesses there you know i've heard where people be in the room and the power of god comes in the anointing of god comes in and then when the launching leaves they go with him that's what i'm talking about i believe those stories amen with all my heart amen he said that's the only true evidence that there is that you're a christian how can you be a christian when see listen and what he's trying to say is let's say it like this here was jesus christ the very word of god manifested in the flesh and yet and still he needed the holy spirit that's right amen why he couldn't make his journey he couldn't go no further god had met him there at the river of jordan with john it was then the pillow fire come down and said this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased to dwell in and after that miracles upon miracles but first he had to suffer amen 40 days and 49 he went through the wilderness and listen the bible don't even tell us of all the events that satan may have tempt him with god knows it well it was rough it had to be just as rough as calvary was but when he came out he was all god amen he had learned that man does not live by bread alone is that right because that's what the bible said he learned his his obedience through the things he suffered and when he came out he he basically told the devil you know man doesn't live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god that's how we live amen because we live off these earthly substances we're going to die but if you really want to live you live by the word amen and once that word is on the inside of you you become eternal it's the only thing about you now that had no beginning or no ending is that eternal life in you amen all right just almost at the end here in the beginning was the word and you understand when i said that about jesus he had to be anointed quickened even though he never lost vision of who he was but the holy ghost came down amen in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and you think you got it tough but jesus even as a child had to live circumspectly and after the age of 12 he had to make sure he did no wrong and he was perfect even as a natural man and how more perfect if there's such thing you can become when god himself dwells in you god was so in him amen he calmed the sea yep amen when that boat was rocking and peter them afraid and lord lord careth thou not we perish and he goes up and says peace be still he didn't argue with the devil no he knew where the storm was caused by the devil right sometimes we waste words when it comes to prayer faith just tell them to to go and say you know we don't have to go through all the history of the bible god i know you can do it because you open the red sea you know what i'm saying we don't have to do all of that just speak to the devil when the authority is in you it's in you often times we go through all that drama the devil's saying okay you're trying to convince yourself that he is yeah we don't have to go through all that amen in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us the same yesterday today and forever what i'm trying to say is i don't know how to say it but god give me the words because i see what i see we often use we're made out of the same material we're bone of his bone in flesh of his flesh but if we were to look in the mirror what would we see not trying to discourage you but i'm saying that's where we need to be amen we understand this from glory to glory that means suffering from suffering battle to battle but at the end of the day our goal is to look in the mirror and see jesus the bible said we'll see him face to face the very same image the very same likeness the same authority the same power the same everything that jesus had did and in our day through a prophet is supposed to be in the bride amen don't become complacent it's what i'm working with press toward the mark of a high calling in christ jesus don't let these things distract you because i have distractions all the time that i wore again sometimes i mean it's like a you know back and forth and back and forth but at some point in time it it must stop in order to go forward it has to stop not just you all of us go through these things but we must understand that the god in us is saying come on now you won't go around this mountain too long amen come on let's move forward you see he's the same yesterday to them forever and we said well he's in us well if he's in us he must be the same that's what i see almost done the same yesterday today and forever he was the same god that was in david in other words david could have never done anything had it not been the god in him he was the same one that was in moses moses couldn't have done one thing had not god met him on the back side of the desert that same god that was in the burning bush stepped into moses that's what we need we need that same god to step into us amen he was the same one that was in moses he was the same one in all of the apostles he's the same one he is the same one that was in jesus christ to manifest himself there for that promised word and he is the same god today the same word throwing light upon the word of the hour god be merciful to us see this is what the message comes to throw light to throw that anointing through light on the word throw light so you can understand who you are and what you're supposed to be it will not come back void and whether we believe it or whether we achieve it if somebody will and those people that have been ordained to achieve it will achieve it amen and you got to believe that you're one of them amen don't let the devil down play who you are amen you've got to move forward god help me i don't care if i gotta move like a snail let me move forward that's what brother battle say you know we're moving slowly but that's the way he said it would be in this day but we'll get there amen yes sir believe in god to interpret himself every word to be vindicated yes he is his own interpreter amen and i say all of that to say the god in you that one in you that spirit in you is trying to lead you into a place of perfection let go and you know the cares of this world and the things that we care about don't mean a thing in a moment of twinkling of an eye it's gone and you know what we don't know when we're gonna die we don't know our day of departure and you know you find rich men who build and build and build and build and as soon as they get ready to retire they die yeah and and solomon said it someone said you spend all your life building these things and then when you die a fool come by and spend it it's the truth now i'ma say this so you can rest at ease you know i you know god did this but i'll be honest with you when i graduated from school and things i had in my mind that one day i'd have my doctorate degree but you know i went to this apostolic church and this church had us thinking that the rapture could happen in such a time and you got to be so ready you know we spent every every day looking up and looking at the stars and looking seriously i'm laughing but it's true until we spend so much time trying to observe the season life passed us that's right and it put us in such a nervous condition you fail you come short you just like lord don't let the rapture happen right now because i got to get it right you know what i'm saying it was the way we were taught and it was wrong it's strange that the prophet of god said plant your potatoes that's right you keep planting your potatoes if you have something in you that you want to achieve go for it but make sure you keep amen don't let nothing stop you because we don't know we don't know don't don't make you see what i'm saying if you got the holy spirit and you really know that you saved you're sanctified the holy spirit the grace of god is with you then who can lay in the charge to god's election amen who can misjudge you you understand what i'm saying but we get to a phase we get to a place where we feel like we can help it you can't we do make ourselves ready if there be anything in our way that is hindering us to becoming going forward we need to get rid of it but if what you're doing is not hindering your spiritual life you go on with it you understand me and no that if you have been chosen before the foundation of the world and we don't know how many years that have been that's before the earth started that's before the sun and all of those things foundation of the world you understand me way before then god chose you and at the end of the day he's not going to say oops i made a mistake god don't make mistakes and god knew your travel he knew your ways before you ever came here is that right jacob i love and esau i hate it not taken away from righteousness but understand that our righteousness is of god and out of ourselves this is the grace of god that has been given to us and if you've been chosen to make a ride or rapture there's nothing satan can put in your way to make it not happen we can get in his way though just like i said i think the the last sunday you know here god didn't already told or was it rachel uh rachel one of the two you know the jacobs i love and he's all i hate and the younger were rude the elder and she thought well i gotta help it god told me but i gotta help it i hear that you know uh daddy getting ready to anoint you see what i'm saying and in the course of that jacob had to suffer 14 years things went out of course because of their action as if god wasn't going to make it happen god only god don't anoint you to be a deceiver man that's not god that was human being that was human effort human human in the way you understand me and what happened jacob had to suffer for 14 years and he even married a wife amen that had a little idolatry in them yeah and look at the scripture it took rachel a long time before she could actually call jacob israel god had to work on her too see but all of that took place because here was a man and his mama getting in the way and that's what happens we let the church get on our way we let these natural things get in our way like we gonna make it happen and happen no no you get in the way you're gonna cause a long journey of suffering but god will bring you back because all things work together for the good he knows how to do it amen you love the lord amen don't don't uh let me tell you like this what i believe and i you know i don't know i i believe it's far closer to the translation than we think yes sir amen and i believe that when the this this volcano erupted underneath the sea there out there and shook all of that tsunami and everything wasn't a big one right because listen even even when in that dream of 33 or whatever it was that young boy that had to dream about california he said you know what we call the big one he said it started off as a small earthquake something so small that people ignored it see god knows what he's doing and a lot of times our interpretation is not the way he's going what are you going to do and i say this by the grace of god i'm trying to bring a peace to you but the peace i'm trying to bring to you is this is established in you getting the holy ghost amen if you don't have it do whatever you can do when i say that i mean talk to god well i don't know how talk to the lord show me the way talk to the lord amen that's on that tape that's on the tape god's provided way for this day you ask him how to do it and he'll show you how to do it amen he'll show you how to get there he's the only one that knows the way amen people this is a perfect message and all we need to do is take it and believe it and move forward with it no questions asked just do what it says and god will anoint you in such a way i see it coming i really see it coming it's it's going to happen let's stand brother brandon said your pastor leads you you know what people are taking so much they don't even study they don't read the word no they come to church for the pastor to lead them what kind of christianity is that they take a quote and they run it to the stream and they don't understand that in the midst in the middle of all of that you could tell people don't know this message you can tell their response they just don't know what you know and if you're not preaching something they're accustomed to hearing they don't even know what you're talking about right reading the word loving the word that's your husband this is a letter form but lord help me love you in such a way the problem god talks about he said the bride will be reading her word every day folks if you're not reading it repent amen get to a places lord give me the love for this word so i'll know you better amen quicken this word to us in such a way that you would become my daily bread and my my lover help us jesus lord we thank you father let's find a word of prayer father we so thank you for your grace and your mercy i pray lord with this little short message that you would enlighten our hearts give us a thirst and a desire to serve your father we realize oh god we don't know the dating or the hour he told us to continue to plant our potatoes lord and god you don't want us to live on the edge you don't want us to be nervous we don't you don't want us to fear that the rapture will leave us behind but you want us to have the faith to know that the rapture can't happen until you're ready until we're ready and we're part of that rapture because we've heard your call we came out of the system we're into your word oh god and we're allowing your word to wash us in the cleaners and to prepare us for that homecoming city hallelujah yes lord help us this night to understand and to see and to not only see but obey let
