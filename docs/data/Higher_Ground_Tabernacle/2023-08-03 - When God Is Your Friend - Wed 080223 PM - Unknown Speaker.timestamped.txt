[35:33] it is that time
[35:37] it is manifesting time
[35:43] brother random preached a message on the
[35:45] Harvest
[35:47] and we know that we are living in the
[35:50] last days
[35:56] so as we stand
[35:59] we're going to ask that you turn with us
[36:01] to Philippians 1 practice
[36:05] 21 verse in Philippians 3 7 through 10.
[36:15] Philippians 1
[36:16] Philippine 21
[36:20] for to me 4242 mean to live is Christ
[36:24] amen and to die is gained
[36:32] Philippians 3 Philippians
[36:37] 7 through 10 verses
[36:45] you there amen what things were gained
[36:48] to me those I counted lost for Christ
[36:51] amen Massachusetts
[36:58] you're doubtless and I count all things
[37:01] but lost for the Excellency of the
[37:04] knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord
[37:11] for whom I have suffered the loss of all
[37:15] things and do count them but dung that I
[37:18] might may win Christ
[37:25] and being found in him and not having my
[37:29] own righteousness
[37:32] which is of the law
[37:37] but that which is through the Faith of
[37:40] Christ the righteousness which is of god
[37:43] by faith which verse
[37:55] 10th verse that I might know him I found
[37:59] the connector Christ and the power of
[38:01] his resurrection
[38:03] and the fellowship of his suffering
[38:07] being made conformable unto his death
[38:10] and did not confirm some more one more
[38:13] scripture and I'll let you be seated
[38:28] God is good to us amen
[38:38] bear with me just a moment I thought I
[38:40] had a scripture there
[38:47] James Jacques
[38:51] 23-26
[38:59] and the scripture was fulfilled which
[39:01] saith Abraham believed God and it was
[39:04] imputed unto him for righteousness and
[39:08] he was called the friend of God and
[39:11] sister
[39:14] accomplished
[39:18] you see then how that by works a man is
[39:22] Justified and not by faith only
[39:29] likewise also was not rehab the holy
[39:32] justified by works
[39:38] when she had received the messengers and
[39:41] had set them out another way
[39:48] for as the body without spirit is dead
[39:52] so faith without works is dead
[39:59] Hallelujah let us pray please Heavenly
[40:03] Father we come before you Lord
[40:06] thank you for your goodness and your
[40:08] grace
[40:18] that's my service in a special way
[40:21] finishes
[40:27] fill our hearts with your Divine love
[40:31] that we will not only love each other
[40:35] we will love your word we will love you
[40:40] God help us now in your lovely name
[40:44] Jesus Christ
[40:46] amen amen you may be
[41:07] basically about friends
[41:10] and everybody has a friend
[41:14] hopefully anyway it's a spell
[41:17] but as we have heard in the songs
[41:27] you know brother Brandon was not only a
[41:30] prophet
[41:31] but brother Brandon was a friend of God
[41:36] hallelujah and even the bride the memory
[41:40] poos she has been called the friend of
[41:44] God
[41:45] Amen now when you are friends
[41:48] the definition of a friend like
[41:51] definition is a person whom one knows
[41:55] and with whom one has a bond of mutual
[41:58] affection person
[42:04] affection typically exclusive of sexual
[42:08] or family relations
[42:11] exclusive the the sexual sexual if the
[42:15] relation family Hallelujah
[42:17] but if you've ever had a good friend man
[42:21] she was a
[42:22] you know a good friend sticks closer
[42:24] than a brother
[42:28] we now I want to say tonight
[42:31] in order to be a true friend of God
[42:35] you've got to sell all that you have
[42:40] is that right that's right we know the
[42:44] story of the Rich Young rulers
[42:46] he came to Jesus for salvation
[42:50] he had done all the law
[42:54] right things but when Jesus Christ asked
[42:58] him
[42:59] one day to give everything he had
[43:04] and follow him it was too much to ask
[43:09] for
[43:10] we look at this Rich Young Ruler as if
[43:14] it's a strange story
[43:19] this man would not follow Jesus
[43:25] he was not willing to sell all
[43:34] [Music]
[43:39] does it put you in the same position
[43:45] [Music]
[44:04] [Music]
[44:18] oftentimes people say I'm a Christian
[44:21] but then there is no life behind him
[44:25] y'all hear what I'm saying
[44:27] Christianity is not a social club
[44:31] it is not something that you join is
[44:34] anybody become a member
[44:37] in order to be a Christian
[44:40] you must be born again
[44:43] y'all hear what I'm saying
[44:45] Christianity the Christianity has to be
[44:48] lived
[44:50] is that right that's right in the
[44:52] question and answer all three
[44:56] 1964.
[44:58] I've got to live that example
[45:02] Christianity is is what you Christianity
[45:06] ain't what you say look
[45:09] it's what you live
[45:12] what you do circle is an example is it
[45:16] an example you're the sword of the Earth
[45:18] amen
[45:49] amen now all of us are guilty
[45:54] but in order to be a friend of God
[45:57] you must obey the law
[46:01] you got to give to Caesar
[46:09] you got to give to Caesar
[46:12] what belongs to Seasons
[46:16] and the prophet God said you know you
[46:18] may find yourself doing wrong
[46:26] way you you you confess
[46:30] Hallelujah
[46:37] [Music]
[46:49] [Music]
[47:04] [Music]
[47:49] [Music]
[47:56] in our revelation is unto the Lord is
[48:01] that right that's right brother man who
[48:04] tells a story in that same message
[48:08] he talks about a woman about you in
[48:11] first husband was a drunkard
[48:14] and they were discussing
[48:18] that they had never seen a Christian
[48:20] before you know
[48:22] and this drunk man said it's the
[48:25] strongest
[48:28] my wife
[48:30] and if you don't believe me
[48:47] foreign the man said to his wife with
[48:50] his friends
[48:53] fix me some food I always prepared to
[48:56] you fix me some eggs and ham
[49:00] and she fell right into it and she said
[49:04] yes I'll go fix you some eggs and ham
[49:07] Hallelujah now he prepared she prepared
[49:10] the meal for all of them
[49:14] Hallelujah but when he the husband
[49:17] God his meal are you stronger he said
[49:21] these eggs are bad you know they threw
[49:25] all the food on the tape the floor and
[49:26] everything
[49:28] Hallelujah go fix me some more uh
[49:32] she says oh no honey I'll go fix you
[49:35] some more and I just passed for him um
[49:37] and he said well you knew I didn't like
[49:39] eggs like that hey like you just did
[49:41] that just to be doing it
[49:45] he and his buddies walked out the house
[50:05] [Music]
[50:29] because she was a friend of God
[50:33] hallelujah amen she obeyed the word of
[50:36] God
[50:38] hallelujah bless those who curse you
[50:42] could understand that despitefully use
[50:54] and team
[50:57] amen amen
[50:58] amen we're built upon Revelation
[51:01] built upon Revelations
[51:14] one thing about Christianity
[51:16] you cannot fake it
[51:20] [Music]
[51:21] if it's not in you it can't come out of
[51:25] you Hallelujah
[51:28] amen and when you see yourself fail
[51:31] remember the blood of Jesus Hallelujah
[51:38] God always
[51:40] away
[51:42] for us to get it right Hallelujah
[51:47] having God as a friend
[51:51] I mean
[51:53] you don't have to worry about nothing
[51:55] even
[51:58] people people spoke evil to brother
[52:01] Branham
[52:02] he didn't have to fight them
[52:08] Hallelujah and when you are a friend of
[52:11] God
[52:20] absolutely absolutely
[52:23] Hallelujah and if you don't pray for
[52:26] those that offend you and Siri was a
[52:29] false they will be in great trouble with
[52:31] God
[52:33] the Bible said be careful you know if
[52:37] you think the least of these
[52:40] though
[52:43] Romeo Stone about your neck
[52:46] a stone about your neck
[52:52] and cast yourself into the sea hey
[52:56] Hallelujah is that all right that's
[52:58] right see uh we we look at the scripture
[53:01] and we talk about faith
[53:03] in the message faith without works is
[53:06] dead

[1:35:01] against uh the uh uh uh Branham
[1:35:05] Tabernacle

[1:36:24] right
[1:36:27] Hallelujah can I go just a little
[1:36:29] further yeah
[1:36:32] Hallelujah just a little bit do I
[1:36:35] continue Paul speaking Paul ADI if a man
[1:36:38] ever come to a spot
[1:36:40] that he's been saved and Sanctified the
[1:36:46] blood Sanctified
[1:36:50] Hebrews 13
[1:36:52] 12 and 13.
[1:36:57] says that the blood sanctifies
[1:37:01] and then comes right up to the gate of
[1:37:04] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:37:07] and because of prestige or
[1:37:10] denominational refuses to walk in it
[1:37:13] with the denominations
[1:37:16] he says indeed that person is lost says
[1:37:19] person can never be saved
[1:37:21] for he doesn't spite even to the memory
[1:37:25] of Grace
[1:37:28] that called him out to that place
[1:37:32] I'm showing it to him and then turn
[1:37:35] around
[1:37:36] walk away from it he counsel the blood
[1:37:40] of the Covenant
[1:37:41] but he was crucified
[1:37:45] was crucified as an Unholy thing
[1:37:49] because the blood that saved him
[1:37:54] Sanctified brings him up to the Baptist
[1:37:58] of the Holy Ghost
[1:37:59] and then walks away
[1:38:05] and let me bring it down to our little

[1:40:17] amen if Versace as bread of any of you
[1:40:22] that his father
[1:40:25] will give him a stone see redone Japan
[1:40:28] or if he asked a fish well she's the one
[1:40:32] in poisson will he for a fish give him a
[1:40:34] serpentine the call the answer that
[1:40:38] question is no no
[1:40:41] hallelujah hallelujah there's so much I
[1:40:43] wanted to say but yeah man I'll say this
[1:40:46] by the grace of God
[1:40:48] God has been so good to us
[1:40:52] we've seen him as a lawyer
[1:40:56] we've seen him as Savior the one very
[1:40:59] common
[1:40:59] last come to know him as a friend amen
[1:41:19] you become the enemy of God
[1:41:24] doesn't mean you're lost
[1:41:26] but I would not take chances
[1:41:31] because if you really love God
[1:41:34] you'll keep his Commandments
[1:41:39] coming from identification
[1:41:41] he said did you know when you get more
[1:41:45] education
[1:41:46] and more culture approach the culture
[1:41:49] did you know that that that's what side
[1:41:52] it puts you on some people can say
[1:41:55] he said it puts you on the devil's side
[1:41:59] the Bible said that like people just the
[1:42:01] children of the darkness larger than the
[1:42:04] ones of the life
[1:42:06] so it ain't all that uh
[1:42:09] if you don't get that yeah
[1:42:12] you put God first
[1:42:16] you love the Lord amen you put him first
[1:42:21] with all that you get all right
[1:42:26] just so you'll know
[1:42:31] do I have time for one more quote
[1:42:34] just one more just inside okay this is
[1:42:36] really a good one because so many people
[1:42:39] say they're a friend of God
[1:42:41] and they won't even come to church
[1:42:44] and the Bible said when you see that day
[1:42:47] approaching and I believe they come over
[1:42:51] come from the question and answers part
[1:42:54] three questions
[1:42:56] they misunderstood brother random on
[1:42:58] some things
[1:43:00] he says no you're mistaken see
[1:43:04] let me go over and just answer it as a
[1:43:08] come by
[1:43:10] he said do you teach that the bride must
[1:43:14] not attend any other Church unless you
[1:43:17] are preaching preaching or else or
[1:43:19] otherwise the Tabernacle like insurance
[1:43:27] folks
[1:43:34] he said no I don't teach that I don't
[1:43:39] believe that I do not believe it
[1:43:44] now this is the listen to what your
[1:43:47] Prophet our Prophet says
[1:43:50] 1964.
[1:43:52] we've got ministers
[1:43:54] sitting here that's
[1:43:56] that's scattered all around through the
[1:43:59] country
[1:44:01] and I believe they are a part of the
[1:44:04] Bride
[1:44:07] I believe that a man or woman
[1:44:10] from can go to church anywhere they want
[1:44:13] to go
[1:44:15] away
[1:44:19] if they don't teach the word whole words
[1:44:23] you can't go to church any other place
[1:44:28] where do they teach the whole word
[1:44:32] [Music]
[1:44:34] until you can get to where they teach
[1:44:37] the homework
[1:44:41] going to church wherever you do
[1:44:46] that Hallelujah
[1:44:51] and he didn't say we got tapes
[1:44:53] everywhere
[1:45:01] that are part of the Bride preachers
[1:45:08] [Music]
