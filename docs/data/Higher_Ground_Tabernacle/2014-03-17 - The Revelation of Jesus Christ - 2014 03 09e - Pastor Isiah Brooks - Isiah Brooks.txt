cause of Christ I'll Stand shoulder to shoulder for the cause of Christ Hallelujah we've got to stand with each other amen surely surely let us stand by the grace of God amen we're going to come from Matthew the 16th chapter as we were uh uh ministering here this morning my Lord my God not something that is just said but something that we must know and understand by the grace of God Amen we we we we you know there's a lot of people who who are Christians and mainly in their heads and more than in their hearts amen they they know him intellectually but you must know him uh as a as a person as God as your savior as Lord he must become you all in all and uh we're living at a time amen where people are falling away and uh Christianity has become just a fad it's not something that's real anymore but you know the Bible tells us that God never left himself with without a witness amen God has never left himself without a witness we're going to be coming as I said from Matthew the 16th chapter you love the Lord amen amen we'll try our best not to uh uh Bel long uh by the grace of God Matthew 16 we're going to uh begin reading at the 16th verse and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon Bo Jonah for bless Flesh and Blood have not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and upon this Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and I will give thee unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever thou shallal bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shall loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven then charge his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ you love the Lord let us pray Heavenly Father God we come before you Lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord we pray father that you would break the bread of life to us give our hearts and mind understanding Lord and we'll be careful to give you the praise Glory and Honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated so we realize by the grace of God that Jesus Christ is not what we would say an organization denomination he is truly amen the divine revelation of who God is and when we speak of divine we must realize amen it is something that God must uh reveal to you that he must give you an understanding of who he actually is there are those of us amen who have come a mighty long way but yet there is a distance that we must still travel and by the grace of God we realize amen that God who started the work in us will finish it we're looking at this thing and and and we want to say by the grace of God as we said this morning it is not enough to to say Jesus or to know him according to the written word but he must become personal to you he must be a savior to you he must be a deliverer to you he must be one amen that you know that you know that you know as we said this morning amen those uh Old Testament Saints amen were not trusting God by chance but they knew who God was and is and they understood him as being God understand there's only one God and the Bible said that he's Lord of all is that all right amen the question question was given unto Peter because and we've heard these things before the question was given to him because there was a rumor there were sayings going out amen among the Jews about who Jesus was and you know some uh Jesus finally answer ask his disciples who do men say that I am I've heard that they Peter said some say that thou art uh Elias some say that you are Jeremiah some say one of the prophets and then Jesus said but I say unto you see and that question comes to each and every one of us you're followers of Christ and he's asking you the question tonight who do you say I am now remember he said uh thou uh the son of man who do you say the son of man am and that term son of man goes all the way back to the time of Ezekiel all the way back time to the prophets of old the word of the term son of man meant Prophet yes sir we know you're a prophet but I want to know what more what what are you more tell me who the son of man am and he said Thou Art the Christ watch that because Christ is the anointed one Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God that meant that you're not only a prophet but you're the prophets God Amen you are a son of God you are God manifested In the Flesh and Jesus said I want you to understand this Flesh and Blood did not reveal this to you in other words you didn't learn this in a Theological Seminary you know your mom or your daddy didn't teach you these things but my father who's in heaven has revealed this unto you and then Jesus go on to say Upon This Rock and some people say well it's the rock of Peter some says it's the rock of Jesus but I want to say it's neither are it is the Revelation upon this Revelation Peter you your answer to my question upon this I will build my church in other words I will divinely reveal to my true followers those who are who I really am who I really who I am upon this Revelation I will build my church because if it was Peter we're in trouble Peter denied Jesus three times come on somebody now isn't it something Paul comes along and said we don't know Jesus anymore after the flesh so it wasn't the man Jesus it was the man it was the god that was in the man why the Bible said in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily so is God the spirit that revealed himself to Peter who Jesus was at that day and Upon This Rock in other words it was the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against me y'all understand what he's saying now a lot of time the gates of hell is the clubs no it's not everybody that goes to the clubs and things like that know if they're caught there they know where they're headed amen don't get shy on me tonight amen where but it it's it's where people go thinking they're going to be saved H because there is no salvation in the church there's salvation only in the name of Jesus Christ churches are places we come to congregate Amen to come together as a party Hallelujah come on somebody but you as individuals you are the church yes sir amen it is your body that God chose to make his Temple the Bible said know ye not that the your temple is the temple of of God woo come on somebody now we look at this thing and you know we realize amen that the whole program the whole church is built upon divine revelation is that right the whole church the Bible tells us that Abraham forsook his Kindred he was following a God that had no name hello somebody so how did he know that the God he was following was really the true God he comes out of the land of ch here and in that land amen there was just Idol worshippers everywhere come on somebody how do you know you following the real one you got Buddha you got Allah you got Muhammad you got all of those other gods out there how do you know you're serving the true and living God Amen he's revealed it to you it's not something on the inside in the inside of your head but it's something on the inside of your heart amen well you know that could be psychology you can make yourself believe whatever you want to believe come on somebody but we realize amen amen that it is a chang life that vindicates there something else living inside of you beside you Glory Hallelujah something that change your Darkness into light something that changed your night into day am something that made your wrong right amen something that lives in you walks in you talks in you amen and possesses all that he promised that you would possess as we've heard the term before if you say that Beethoven is living in you and you can't play a lick on the piano then your testimony is not true because if be toan is living on the inside of you you would do the works of Beethoven you would be not only a a piano player but you will be a a composer of Music hello why because it's no longer you living but Beethoven living in you hello somebody so if Christ is living in you amen that's why he said the works that I do you shall do also why because I'll be living in you he said at that day you'll know that I'm in the Father the father's in me and I am in you there's no greater Revelation that an individual could ever have than that Jesus Christ is living in them or in you is that all right amen built upon divine revelation that's right Jesus said in Matthew 16 chapter flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you but my Father which is in heaven he has revealed this to you right come on somebody amen what is it is a revelation of who he was and Upon This Rock I build my church and the gates of hell can't Prevail against it the revelation of Jesus Christ in this hour Hallelujah not God yesterday in other words amen the reel ation of who God was and Noah's day won't help you God is not building the ark today Hallelujah the god that revealed himself even though it be the same God did not will not help you like he did amen the days of Moses god ain't asking you to put the blood on the door Post in the little anymore you're not coming out of that kind of an Egypt amen hallelujah it's still the blood of Christ not the blood of some other lamb but the true lamb of garden putting the blood on your doorpost of your heart amen is where God is asking you so not of a different hour what he was now the Bible express it it grows in it grow is growing in in his bride is that right to to the full statue and see this is where a lot of people are missing it they think as so many of us say well I'm just a s Save By Grace you better be better than you got to come better than that Hallelujah when you was a sinner saved by grace when you were saved amen hallelujah now you're no longer sinner CU you can't be a sinner and a saint you can't be righteous and unrighteous at the same time you can't be holy and Unholy at the same time the Bible said that Jesus Christ became our sin that we might become the righteousness of God I can accept him becoming my sin so therefore I must accept his righteousness wo come on somebody so now amen I am the righteousness of God you don't have to believe it but the Bible said the just shall live by faith amen amen hallelujah come on somebody so we realize by the grace of God with the bride is growing in into that full statue amen the virtues of God must be found in her now we're not talking and I have to be I have to be fully under so we're not talking because I said this morning everybody's got a Jesus every denomination every organization has a has a Jesus and that Jesus is based upon their Doctrine some cut him to pieces and says well he don't do the things he used to do no more the days of Miracles are passed come on y'all know what I'm talking about but that's somebody's Jesus they call on that Jesus right Paul said listen there come a many jesuses there was good be a lot of jesuses but he says I'm afraid you're not preaching the same Jesus I preach see so there is a scripture of Jesus that you and I must follow amen and according to Hebrews 138 he's the same yesterday today and forever he's a God that changes not Hallelujah now that's the Jesus you want to follow where you can have confidence in his word that whatever he did yesterday he'll do it today however he acted yesterday he'll act today that's the kind of Jesus you want to see Hallelujah not some Jesus that's been cut up by some theologians because they don't want to believe the whole word and the Bible said if you take one word out of it amen or you add one word to it he said the will be added to you and your name will be taken out of the Lamb's Book of Life y'all hear what I'm saying so you and I must recognize that you and I must stay with the word in order to see the real Jesus Christ now let's move on by the grace of God Amen because we're coming into the full statue of Christ you and I know amen we have heard many times amen people in the history don't even know what what what really went on and they can't understand how come the new Church Testament Church had to die they couldn't understand the the Dark Ages they can't understand amen how come amen this powerful Church on the day of Pentecost now has been scattered abroad and down in caves and you know running from the authorities and all of these kind of things they don't understand why many of them had that's why I sang that song where where is that old rugged Soldier you realize the cost amen of uh that it it it took for men to bring this Bible to us there was a time where sitting in such an audience like this preaching would have been unlawful it would have been a death sentence for you and I amen but God's grace hallelujah amen throughout the church ages God brought it made it possible for you and I to Feast on the word why because it's time for the real Jes Jesus Christ to be manifested again hello it's time for the real Jesus to be made manifested again so we look at this thing and you say well I'll say it like this the bride therefore the bride Amen in the Rapture will come forth and all of this has been pre-planned nothing is out of cadence nothing is out of order everything has been pre-planned did y'all y'all know that God by his omniscience and omnipresence you know and you know because he know all things he's everywhere y'all understand what I mean he's a being he's not something that's a myth he's not a a piece of cloud or something like that he is a person is that right and so you and I must recognize his authority over his word is that right it's always plead PL you think God didn't know amen God wasn't on Calvary amen men s being sacrificed hoping that somebody was going to believe in him but I hope somebody will believe this no ring in his hand no sir God knew exactly who would believe and who wouldn't believe the Bible tells us amen that he actually called 12 to be his disciples and he knew Judas was a devil he didn't say oh my God I didn't realize Judas was a devil he knew he was a devil sometime God has to call him Amen to fulfill his plan amen hello somebody you said what that can't be true it is true amen remember amen when when they Peter denied Jesus and that woman said hey you one of them how did she know she was in the mix she was part of it right she followed Jesus up to the point where God wanted her to follow so that at that time she could identify Peter right so those listen people when the pressure come you know where it's coming from now we look at this thing you say oh brother Brooks what are you saying the the Psalms had already talked about Judas how he would betray God he was locked into the scriptures come on somebody Mary wasn't an accident y'all understand me the Bible according to Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive Hallelujah she was locked into the scripture nobody knew who Mary was until Mary herself met the the angel Hallelujah and Mary then could find herself in the scripture Hallelujah every Christian supposed to find or be able to find themselves in the scripture oh come on it's the truth you either a Believer a m believer or non-believer Hallelujah all three of them are there amen come on somebody it's the truth anyhow amen so we look at the thing and you and I must realize amen that here God comes along and let me say it like this I got this in quotation in my notes I said the purpose the purpose for which you were born every man and woman in here you as Christians must come to know the purpose for which you were born oh you were born to be a doctor were you be born to be a lawyer were you born no I mean those things are secondary you were born to be Sons and Daughters of God that's the whole purpose if you missed that purpose you missed the very reason you were born you said well how can you conclude that how can you come up with that I can take you back to uh Genesis the whole purpose for God uh creating Adam was to have a man in his own image and his likeness Hallelujah that purpose Still Remains the whole purpose of God is to have a people in his own image and his likeness and because because of the Fall we came up looking like something else we look like the children of Wrath Hallelujah because of the fall but God's whole purpose amen was to have sons and daughters of God do what replenish the Earth Hallelujah will one word fall no sir because you got to realize amen because of sin amen we've got two kinds of people in here in the world is that right y'all know that's the truth remember remember the S seed the seed sore Parable there was a good man who went out and sold good seed and there was a bad man that went out and sold Bad Seed amen the good seed and the Bad Seed came up together hello you said I man that guy must be a devil and a lot of time he is he can't help it it all depends on the seed that's in you oh Lord hallelujah I don't want to go too much with that but y'all know what I'm working with you know how I can tell you you can tell you said but Lord who do I belong to I'll tell you one good one good examination of yourself even as a child a true son and daughter of God hates to sin we might come to a place we might fall to it all the time we might even not know God we don't even know God at a time there's a time we didn't know God but we hated it our friends could go out and have a good time and never felt guilty about it but there was something about you on the inside that made you feel bad about it and you was ashamed to tell it cuz you wanted to be part of the group oh I'm trying my best to keep myself together amen because I want you to realize amen that was a c gen of God on the inside of you trying to identify you and separate you from the others Hallelujah and then when you heard the voice of Jesus Hallelujah you heard the eagle scream and God will awaken you to the purpose that you were born and that to be a Christian one thing about true Sons and Daughters of God you can't get you can't get away from it amen you said well brother Brooks I back slide seven times in a day and why you don't stay back there something picks you up every time Hallelujah you say God forgive me help me Lord Jesus give me strength there's something on the inside that makes you want to go further with Goden woo Hallelujah now remember in this last day when the age of land to see you and the Bible called according to Revelations 3:18 the Bible said God called you to be gold tried in the fire a lot of us don't want them try those fires to tr us but you tried in the fire God got to go you that's the only real purification is that right the true purification comes by fire amen hello listen Noah right was justification amen the water but Noah comes right up out of the out of After the flood and he sin so it didn't cleanse him it got him Closs to the tribulation Hallelujah but it didn't changed the man inside Hallelujah come on sanctification when the blood dropped on the earth Sanctified it Hallelujah but men still were smoking cigarettes Hallelujah come come on somebody Christians like Luther Hallelujah but still had bad habits Hallelujah yeah they were still Christian but they just come up to sanctification but God said there's coming a fire amen is that right John said listen I there's one that comes after me he said his Sho lashes I'm not even able to lose but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire and see the whole world in itself must go through the same cleansing process before Jesus ever steep foot on the Earth again it went through the water of justification it went through the sanctification of the blood of Jesus Christ and it must go through the fire baptism and you know this world going to be destroyed by fire it's coming people it's coming so you and I must recognize Amen in order for Jesus Christ to come into your heart you must experience the fire baptism of the Holy Ghost oh come on somebody it's nothing but the truth so we realize by the grace of God you must come who you are now we look at this thing and we come to a place and and as a child you wonder why this happened to me why this happened to me why how come me you know you just looking at and you don't understand but as you grow older you began to mature and then you began to see oh this is why this happened this is why this happened this is why this happened amen and then it's just a part of maturing and then you began to appreciate the life so is it with a true born again believer amen you're born a baby in Christ you don't remain a baby hello I gave the illustration of that some time ago if if if I did if I were as a baby born never matured you know what I would look like a big old baby with a big old head right all my parts are unproportional yes but maturing molds you makes you it began to Define character Hallelujah is that what the face does it Divine it it it define character and so that's what maturing do would do for every Christian is to Divine to define the character that's in you now let me say this this is why we must Christ must be seen you understand me you've heard me say this many times demons don't occupy bodies that will not make let them made manifest y'all hear what I'm saying if a person is a drunker how would you know it he would possess that spirit and he'll begin to look like a drunk come on I I I I was raised up with alcoholics so I know what they look like and y'all hear what I'm saying oh it's the truth you take somebody there and all you got to do is listen to him talk one time you don't even have to hear him you don't have to see him smoke every smoker has a smoker's voice oh maybe y'all didn't know that from now on listen every smoker has a smoker's voice and you know it is it's amazing how as I said every demon wants to be uh made manifest and it is just what God want the Holy Ghost wants to be made manifest am I right am I right the Holy Ghost want to be seen in other words let's put it way Jesus Christ want to be seen in this world not in a church building in you okay this is not to Pi fun or to make fun so I want you to understand how do you know a child when it has Down syndrome that's a spirit that literally attacked their genes while they were being developed whatever sin brought it on we don't know hello like sin bring on blindness who did Sin nobody this is to show the glory of God y'all hear what I'm saying so every thing has a in I don't care if it's Chinese Japanese african-amer African whatever it may be every down synd child look alike y hear what I'm saying why because there's something manifesting itself they act alike they behave themselves hello now I used that only to say if it is a true Christian a true Christian must measure up to the word they will act like the ones that came before them they look like them they act like them they talk like them they have faith like them you know why cuz they're born Christians amen this is not a masquerade party this is not something that we put on Amen to look like a Christian it's something that comes from inside out am I making sense here the scripture tells us according to Romans 13:14 put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ and my question was how do you put him on huh how do you put him on let's move on Galatians says 3:27 for for as many of you as have been baptized unto Christ have put on Christ how do you put him on turn with me to Philippians please quickly I'm G to try my best not to be long I'm just moving I'm trying to move Philippians y'all believe the word amen see what I what I'm saying here tonight amen is that we going to make a Rapture if we're going to be translated you and I must understand the Bible says no un C thing is going to make it in no liar no no Gambler no whatever nothing unclean nothing nothing nothing so if if the unclean is not going to are not going to be there then then then what what what what must we do and understand that our sanctification is not because amen we thought we washed today our sanctification is the washing of the word it's God washing you listen You'll Never overcome anything in your life until God takes the desire away as long as the desire is there you have a possibility of being tempted but when the darkness is taken away the light is that right when the when the desire is taken away then you can I don't care if you smoked 30 years somebody can blow it in your face and you'll never want it anymore Hallelujah yes yes yes yes amen Philippians you love God Amen Philippians 2 please and I'm just going to read because uh and I want you to pick it up now beginning at the first verse if there be therefore any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any Fellowship of the spirit if any bows in in Mercy fulfill ye my joy that you be likeminded having the same love being of one Accord and of one mind let nothing be done through Strife of vain Glory but in loneliness of Mind Let each esteem others better than themselves look not every man on on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which also was in Christ Jesus and understand the word let amen and I'm I'm I'mma emphasize that again let is to give permission to is to give leway to so you're the only one that can let it happen amen right so oh God I want your mind but you're the one that determines on whether or not you get it or not because you are the only one you're the one that can let it happen right let this mind be in you that which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God now you're treading Upon A a situation or or something that people are afraid of now I'm going to read the scripture again because I'm going to tell you something I said like this if a horse have a Offspring what is it if a cow have a Offspring what is it if a dog have a Offspring what is it if God have Offspring I knew y'all get choked huh well then stop saying I'm a Son of God cuz God can't produce a dog God can't produce a hog out of him Jesus said I was the firstborn of my brethren then who is his Brethren hallelujah amen Now understand this you let him that doesn't make you the Elohim you're not the spring You're The Offspring oh come on somebody let me ask you was your parents monkeys oranger tangs y'all hear what I'm saying where did you come from both of your parents were human that's why you were born a human and if you're going to be reborn again again you must be born again then what are you born of born of the spirit of God that's why the Bible said you are a new creation old things are pass away and behold all things are come new now I'm working with some meat here now this ain't this ain't no milk cuz the just shall live by faith you can't reason this out you got to believe it and that's the Bible that's the Bible That's why Christians are so weak cuz they don't know who they are Hallelujah but those old Sanctified Holy Ghost F Christians at the gate of beautiful says Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I Thee what were they giving they were imparting God to that man Hallelujah that's all I'm saying you know denomination or they not going to bring you that why because everybody want to be over everybody else y'all hear what I'm saying amen but we're a body and I'm going tell you something if I stop my toe my head going to say ow my toe is important to me come on if you don't think your toes are important let somebody cut them off you love the Lord all I'm doing is listen read the book of Acts Paul says in the book of Acts he said if is it not written that we are The Offspring of God that's in your Bible look up Offspring and find it in Acts is it not written even in your poets who say We Are The Offspring of God well hello I got eight offsprings and they all look human my I'm bringing a point I'm trying to get you to see that a Christian is not just Christ like it's Christ in the man that makes him like Christ it's the life of Jesus Christ what do you think the Holy Ghost is the bible say that Holy Ghost Jesus said it is good that I go away he said because when I go away the comforter will come he said the comforter whom my father was send in my name now watch Jesus said I came in my father's name name that God going to send The Confidant in the name that I'm in and my my father's name is Jesus and so mine must be and so my Holy Ghost come in all right y'all got it y'all got it now Hallelujah it was the same life that was in Jesus is that the word amen all I'm saying the Bible said if that same Spirit be in you that was also in Christ Jesus huh as it quickened his body raised him from the dead come on if the Same Spirit as it quickened his body and raised him from the dead it was also Quicken and raised you from where the dead but you got to have the same Spirit the same life which is God himself Oh My My My God is a spirit and you can't see him so God had to be a God in Mor he had to put on a mask he come down as a son Hallelujah Lord don't get me wrong a lot of people well he came down and saw that means that heaven was bankrupt Heaven could never be bankrupt Hallelujah and when Jesus was praying he wasn't praying to himself he was praying to God the Father hello now figure that one out so let me move on I'm having a good time I hope y'all are why because you can see the reality this thing is a reality it's the Bible is a new book it's not something that's his hisorical and you know we don't need men to go in there and say well I think this is what it is it interprets itself God Said Amen to knowah it's going to rain did it rain God said he was going to destroy Egypt did he do it sir now I'm going tell you I've been to Egypt and egyp hadn't gotten over it yet they still in chaos Hallelujah come on and then they're going to try to tell us that they don't have no record of Moses ever being there I said well you don't have I said to myself you don't have to have record I can see he's been and gone Hallelujah come on somebody my point is it's just like so many Jews believe that Jesus body was stolen and there are people who still believe that today now we know better why because he's revealed himself to you and I right but you still can't stop those who want to believe a lie is that all right so when it comes to who he is to you this is what I'm working with every trial you go through and come through is to vindicate to you who God is to you you must come to know who he is cuz when the test and trial come you must realize that the steps of a righteous man are ordered by God ain't nothing coming my way amen by coincidence and whatever it is I don't care how bad it is if I am the cause of it God's still going to work it toward my good amen amen oh Hallelujah let me let me move on by the grace of God you love the Lord St John 17 please St John 17 beginning at the n9th verse God liken himself as Jehovah Eagle did y'all know that and if God is an eagle what does that make you Hallelujah and Eagles are the are the the top bird in the world right strong Birds their leaders conquer us you'll never seen a a a eagle with a Seely face he's always serious amen hallelujah why because he's about his father's business is that all right amen you take those Eagles amen they're able to fly and they are the only bird that can actually look the sun in the eye without going blind every other bird will break up and bus up and they can't even fly as high as an eagle y'all hear what I'm saying and a true Son of God can literally look the sun in the eye without going blind Hallelujah y'all better realize this because the word of God will either give you sight or it bring you to a blindness Hallelujah St John 17 you love God I hope you're being blessed amen I'm working with the divine revelation of Jesus Christ that's the subject message tonight divine revelation of Jesus Christ where is he today ah amen either amen praise the Lord that's where he's at he's in you amen amen I didn't know whether to give Adam that credit or whatnot but you know I thank God for his grace amen amen to know that we can truly identify where he's at the Bible say you you don't have to go to the east or the west or say over here in the desert and this and that no sir wherever the carcass is there will the Eagles be gathered Hallelujah wherever the bloody word is that's where the Eagles will be gathered Hallelujah they like fresh kill amen hallelujah so St John 17 amen beginning at the ninth verse he said I pray for them who is this Jesus Christ I pray not for the world but for them which thou has given me for they are thine now he said I pray for them who you give not the world I Pray For Those whom you've given me and all of mine are thine and thine are mine and I am glorified woo all that the father's given me can I say this there could be somebody that'll come up in life it's possible because they say everybody got to look alike and they can come up and say well I'm I'm your brother or I'm your son I mean or whatever but how would I be able to tell whether they are or Not by testing the blood right to see what DNA is there give it the blood test and then I can tell you whether you're mine or not now really I should know better but my point is that's how God knows whether you are here or Not by the DNA by the blood oh Lord why because we don't put blood on us but it it was never the chemistry that saved you it was the life that was in the blood see that's why the Lamb's blood couldn't save you all it could do was cover you why because a lamb's blood is not compatible to human blood so we need a human lamb amen oh my God Amen we needed a human lamb like I said amen we needed somebody who could interpret the painting Isaiah gave the the a painting you know he' be uh you know LED from Slaughter from Hall to Hall and you know with his stripes we heal he and but then John comes along and said there he is Behold the Lamb of God hallelujah what was he was an interpreter of the painting and that's how that's how God knows who you are by the blood hall right when I see the blood I pass over you it's not the chemistry now it's the life that's in the blood it's the holy spirit that was in that blood that comes back into you and it makes is compatible uh now he said I'm is that right in other words if my daddy I'm born I I'm take I took my daddy's DNA H he could have said to my mama that child ain't mine my mom said come on let's get a blood test right she didn't have to go through that but the point is amen if my blood test if I had a blood test and it came up exactly like his the LA say you pay up or get locked up y'all getting quiet on me but my point is it is the blood test and every everybody as I said earlier will have to go through the blood exam to see whether you be of God or not the Bible said the Lord knoweth them that are his woo so if there are those in the world Amen whose seeds were sown by the bad guy they're not Gods let's move on Amen all right let's jump to the 16 17th verse they are not of the world even as I am not of the world now if I am not of the world where did I come from where did you come from you said God said you're not of the world but where did you come from then I can tell you did you know you was in your mom and your dad your daddy's loans how many of y'all remember that you were there you were there you were there in your long in the Longs of your father and God blessed him with a a wonderful wife Amen to as a bed in ground and he brought forth the seed planted in her and you became the tree from the tree is that right amen so you understand this you either were in God in the beginning or you'll not be in the end in other words come on there's only certain seeds can come out of me one y'all hear what I'm saying amen I I I it is I'm trying to show you something here let's put it like this if if and I'm not God but if was and I was to have children I would have to find a bedding ground to bring forth children right and all the children that would be brought forth would be mine unless my wife slip up hello y'all know what I'm saying and brought forth something else right well that's something else ain't going to look like me it won't act like me why because it's not mine am but listen it is nothing but the truth I've seen people come up and me and my wife has had all these children and all of them practically grown and I've had people say you know what I don't know where they get that from yes you do the apple don't fall too far from the tree what it is sometime we forget we we weren't always saved and them children I see my children some act like my brother some act like my sisters some act like me but it's still in the tree line y'all hear what I'm saying so is it with the true sons of God there's only way to act like him amen oh come on I'm going Beyond where I wanted to go but I have to say it like this people say well my daddy had high blood pressure so it came to me did you ask for it it was a gift through your natural birth your Gene was weak because somebody else Gene was weak come on it was given to you even though you didn't want it now if your natural birth gives you gifts what about your spiritual amen come on somebody you're going to have to have something that look like God Amen hallu am I making sense you're going to have something that looks like him acts like him in some way so somebody will be able to identify you come on they always talk about oh I know you a Brooks man look at your head see cuz all my children got the same kind yeah they can't get away with it the head the nose whether they like it or not I gave it to them y am I making sense why y'all getting quiet on me am I going too long here let me move on let me move on okay let me move on by the grace of God just give me a few more minutes I'll be done verses 2226 I get car away I get under this anointing and I get all happy but listen and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one i in them thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has love them as thou has loved me huh Jesus Christ is saying that God loves us even as he loved him that's your Bible father I will that they also whom thou has given me be with me where I am that's all Jesus ever asked for father I would that they be with me even where I am I go away to prepare a place for you that where I am there you may be also see so all of this if I did where yes uh my children would say I came from my daddy right now they can't come back to me but they came from me but in this instances we came from God and we go back to him you said that can't be possible then why do you call Heaven your home if you've never been there h listen I'm going close on this you know the book of Acts 5th chapter 28th and 29th saying did not we straightly command you that you should not teach in this name and you heard me say this the name of Jesus Christ is not named or enough amen oh God has been so good what which one in this day you ought to say which one which God has been so good Hallelujah you speaking of Jesus Christ Allah y'all hear what I'm saying come on Amen people don't mind you saying what God is being they don't never cringe when you say God but when you say Jesus Christ they cringe right it's something about that name that the world don't like Hallelujah something about it and that that power that name the Bible said every knee must bow every tongue confess people is that name the world don't want you to mention if you're going to be politically correct they don't mind you saying God but when you start saying Jesus that's you you you identifying a certain one ah come on somebody it's true but the Bible says Amen in the book of Acts amen they forbid them amen to teach or to preach in the name of Jesus and here they said well uh Peter said amen whether you like it or not he said i' rather be God than man huh come on somebody he said we ought to obey God rather than man and neither is there salvation in any other there's no other name given under Heaven whereby a man must be saved but the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah I don't care what kind of school they ever gone through I don't care if they got ddds LD ddds amen there's only one name amen amenallah that God has given us every demon trembles that's why you don't see demons trembling no more cuz people say God hallelujah come on I'm not saying nothing wrong with wrong with saying God but we need to start say identifying who we talking about in this last name is that right that's what he said in the church AG he said I have a one good thing about you you kept my name huh huh come on and you better realize amen you can't call Jesus according to your own Revelation and get something from him you have to have a true revelation of who he is oh come on somebody remember the woman says lord said my my daughter is sick she called him what thy son of David he was the son of David to the Jews but not to this Gentile woman she said thou son of David he never answered her why because she was calling him according to the wrong Revelation Hallelujah that's why people don't get prayer answered they calling on him according to a denominational Revelation when he's revealed in his own word the same yesterday today and forever he's still God hallelujah and what happened is amen she We Come Along by the grace of God and and and then when she said Lord because he's everybody's Lord then he turned Hallelujah and then he rebuked her it is not lawful to give the children bread to dogs now let some preacher come up in here and call you a dog and you'll probably walk out Hallelujah but that woman humbled herself he said yes Lord but even the dog desired a Crumbs from the master table Hallelujah and Jesus said never have I seen such faith in Israel Hallelujah this time this hour your daughter is made whole amen amen because she called him Lord see you can't back up on God sometime God allows things to happen just to try to run you away but when you serious amen you stay like Peter I ain't going nowhere is that right except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life the Bible says 70 turned away then Jesus turned to Peter said will you go said how can I go anywhere Lord you have you're the only one not one of the ones you're the only one amen that has words to eternal life where can I go Hallelujah that's the true bride of Jesus Christ we're suffer it we don't care what kind of trial we're going to go through amen hallelujah what kind of test Lord you can't run me away Hallelujah y'all know what I'm saying a real child you have a spanker child amen they get those little spankings come on where do they go they don't run out the door they come back to Mama and Dad and grab your leg why where else I'm going to go I'm going go I know you love me you sping me I know you love me huh I know you love me amen ain't nobody else going to treat me like you do so let me make it right with you that's what that child is saying let me make it right with you ain't nothing new on the sun and I ain't going to be able to finish this but but there's nothing new Under the Sun uh The Squeeze coming the test is coming we look at Shadrach Meshach and abedo right the fiery furnace we look at Daniel you know Daniel was conspired against in the Kingdom of Babylon they couldn't find no problem with Daniel except Daniel and his God the scripture said there was no fault in Daniel everything Daniel did was right the Bible said there was no error he was so into God he made sure everything was just is Right Hallelujah so when they conspired against Daniel they said listen we know that he bowed down his God we know he prayed three times a day so let's let the king Let's Help The King make a decree amen that there's an image that he must bow to and Daniel said not so and I'm going let you I'mma prove to you I'm not bowing to your image come on you and I must realize there's an image being res erected right now and listen you're going to be brought to a place you going to either bow to it or suffer the consequences H that temperature will be heated up seven times hotter y'all hear what I'm saying you say oh brother not in this day
