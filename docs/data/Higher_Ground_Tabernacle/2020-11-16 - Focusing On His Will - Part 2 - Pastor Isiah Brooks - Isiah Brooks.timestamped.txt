[31:10] hallelujah hallelujah as we're standing
[31:13] we'll get right into the
[31:14] word of the lord appreciate every one
[31:17] of you who have come out to the lord
[31:21] to the house of the lord we'll try to
[31:23] finish up this morning's message
[31:26] we appreciate the holy spirit for
[31:30] being with us this morning we're still
[31:33] focusing on his will and god has allowed
[31:37] us to
[31:38] see what his will is uh for
[31:41] hundreds of years thousands of years if
[31:43] you want to say
[31:44] uh men has not known what the will of
[31:47] god
[31:48] uh was even for their own day and even
[31:50] when god tried to
[31:52] uh direct them by way of a prophet it
[31:54] seems like the people just didn't get
[31:57] get it but we realized today that we're
[32:00] at the end of it all the consummation of
[32:03] all things we're
[32:05] where time is no longer and uh
[32:08] god is no longer hiding himself he's
[32:11] revealing himself
[32:12] more so now to whosoever will if they
[32:16] desire to know truth
[32:17] god is obligated to bring that truth to
[32:21] them
[32:21] oftentimes when truth is brought to
[32:24] individuals
[32:25] they normally screen it through
[32:28] their theological t
[32:32] previous theological teachings and when
[32:35] they do that they miss god
[32:37] because god is not theology
[32:41] god is revelation as we stand we're
[32:44] going to ask that you turn with us to
[32:45] genesis the first chapter
[32:47] we're going to read there the 26th verse
[32:50] and then from that particular first
[32:51] verse
[32:52] excuse me that verse will we'll move to
[32:54] romans the 8th chapter
[32:58] genesis 1 26 which is uh familiar
[33:01] scripture
[33:03] and god said let us make man in our
[33:06] image
[33:07] after our likeness and let them
[33:10] have dominion over the fish and of the
[33:13] sea
[33:14] and over the fowl of the air and over
[33:16] the cattle
[33:17] and over all the earth and all over all
[33:20] every creeping thing
[33:22] that creepeth upon the earth it's
[33:25] amazing when god says let us make
[33:27] man one man in our image after our
[33:30] likeness
[33:31] and let them have dominion amen showing
[33:34] that in that one there was two
[33:37] amen so god is so good to us amen
[33:40] there was adam and adam and then after
[33:42] adam failed it was adam and eve
[33:44] amen according to genesis the fifth
[33:46] chapter amen romans 5
[33:48] please excuse me romans 8.
[33:52] god is so good to us we dealt
[33:55] uh this morning uh a little bit with the
[33:58] mercy seat and showing how that
[34:02] god had to drive uh
[34:06] adam and eve out of the garden after
[34:09] they had fallen
[34:10] uh because if they had partake
[34:13] or partook of the tree of life they
[34:15] would have had
[34:17] uh everlasting life amen in that sinful
[34:20] state but
[34:22] blood of jesus christ had not been shed
[34:24] yet so god had to
[34:26] run them out amen um because
[34:30] to be honest with you uh blood that's
[34:33] there when there's no blood on the mercy
[34:35] seat there's judgment
[34:36] and so therefore god had to drive them
[34:40] out of of the garden but now that the
[34:42] blood is on the mercy seat
[34:44] um we are now being driven uh
[34:48] back into the holies of holies or to
[34:51] that place where christ has
[34:52] or is the mercy seat romans 8
[34:59] we're going to read amen by god's
[35:00] gracious 26th verse of the eighth
[35:03] chapter
[35:05] we read down to the 30th verse likewise
[35:08] the spirit also helpeth
[35:10] our infirmities for we know that what we
[35:13] should pray for
[35:14] as we ought excuse me
[35:18] for we know not what we should pray for
[35:22] as we ought
[35:23] but the spirit itself maketh
[35:26] intercessions for us
[35:28] with groanings which cannot be uttered
[35:32] and he that searches the heart knoweth
[35:35] what is in the mind of the spirit
[35:38] because he maketh intercessions for the
[35:40] saints according to the will of god
[35:43] and we know that all things work
[35:45] together for
[35:46] good to them that love god to them
[35:50] that them who are called are they called
[35:54] according to his purpose
[35:56] for whom he did for no he also did
[36:00] predestinate
[36:01] to be conformed to the image of his son
[36:05] and he might be the firstborn among men
[36:08] and brethren
[36:09] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[36:12] he
[36:12] also called and whom he did call them he
[36:15] also
[36:15] justified and whom he justified them he
[36:19] also glorified
[36:25] what shall we say
[36:29] what shall we then say to these things
[36:32] if god be for us who can be against us
[36:36] let us pray father god we come before
[36:39] you once again we
[36:41] thank you for your holy grail we thank
[36:44] you god for being so good to us
[36:46] lord in a time like this in a time of
[36:50] struggling and a time oppressing
[36:53] in a time lord where it seems like the
[36:55] truth has been
[36:57] defeated but we know by your god by your
[37:00] grace
[37:01] this is the time that you normally show
[37:05] and prove yourself and father we thank
[37:07] you for
[37:08] this time in this day and lord i would
[37:11] not have
[37:12] wanted to live in no other time than
[37:15] this time
[37:16] i just believe by god by your grace lord
[37:19] you have made us for this hour and paul
[37:22] called us more than conquer us and that
[37:24] is what we are
[37:26] in christ jesus more than conquerors now
[37:29] we pray
[37:30] lord tonight that you bless the service
[37:33] bless the hearer that he will not only
[37:35] be a hearer
[37:36] but a doer of the word and father we'll
[37:39] be careful to give you the praise
[37:41] glory and honor in jesus christ's name
[37:43] we pray
[37:44] amen amen you may be seated
[37:47] and we know by god's uh
[37:51] by the scripture that god's will is
[37:53] perfect
[37:55] amen amen god will
[37:58] is perfect and we always want to
[38:02] walk in the perfect will of god
[38:07] amen he has what theologians call
[38:10] the permissive will but we understand
[38:13] that whenever you choose that route you
[38:15] always get in trouble
[38:17] so i think it's best that if we stand
[38:20] stay with the perfect will of god amen
[38:24] so that we
[38:24] will amen be glorified in him
[38:28] now as we said this morning amen that
[38:31] god intent and his uh purpose was to
[38:34] create a man
[38:35] in his own image and likeness and that
[38:38] is what he did
[38:39] now we know according to the scripture
[38:42] the first adam
[38:43] uh that god made is called the earthly
[38:46] adam
[38:48] right because he was of of the flesh
[38:51] part he was of that man the earth man
[38:54] but there was a second adam which we
[38:56] call jesus christ
[38:58] and the bible said not only was he uh
[39:01] from heaven but he was a
[39:02] a quickening spirit that means that he
[39:05] was one who could
[39:06] bring things to life and you and i
[39:08] understand and we know that there's only
[39:10] one life-giver
[39:11] and that is god himself so we understand
[39:15] by god's grace that when god came
[39:17] in the likeness of flesh amen he
[39:20] came down to redeem mankind
[39:24] and it could not have been a cousin or
[39:27] some strange
[39:28] distant fellow but it had to be one
[39:31] of blood kin it had to be a
[39:35] blood relative right so we understand by
[39:38] god's grace that
[39:39] we know that if it was a blood relative
[39:43] he
[39:43] who had to be the redeemer
[39:46] or kinsman redeemer amen he
[39:50] had to be a close king so we thank god
[39:53] for
[39:54] the grace of god because we know that
[39:57] jesus christ was the first fruit
[39:59] of his kind
[40:03] in in the way that we know jesus christ
[40:06] had his
[40:06] own body his body was made by
[40:10] god there was no flaws
[40:13] everything was perfect in itself but you
[40:16] and i we were born
[40:18] by the woman and because of that
[40:21] we have we we do experience
[40:24] death because you know there was a tree
[40:26] of life
[40:28] and there's a tree of death and so when
[40:31] the
[40:32] serpent and eve uh
[40:35] how can i say it when they united in the
[40:38] way that they did
[40:40] the woman traded places
[40:44] she became the tree of death
[40:47] and every man and woman born of a
[40:51] woman will surely die but the
[40:54] men those of us who are born of god
[40:58] will surely live so but there are times
[41:01] when we come to our place in life
[41:03] in this travel in this life sometimes
[41:06] there are times of perplexity you know
[41:08] sometimes their time of confusion
[41:10] sometimes there are times when you come
[41:12] to a place where you just
[41:13] really don't know what to do and which
[41:16] way to move
[41:18] understand by god's grace god has it all
[41:20] covered
[41:21] you and i must understand that nothing
[41:23] nothing nothing
[41:24] absolutely nothing happens in our lives
[41:27] by chance
[41:28] because the bible says that the
[41:29] footsteps of a righteous man
[41:31] are ordered by the lord is that right
[41:35] and even david said he's a lamp unto my
[41:37] pathway and a light
[41:38] unto my feet so we know by god's grace
[41:41] that god always leads us he's the great
[41:43] shepherd
[41:44] even in times when we don't understand
[41:46] he's leading us he's directing us
[41:49] and everything works just the way god
[41:52] wants them to work
[41:55] and but paul wanted to give us a
[41:58] scripture of consolation
[42:00] and that was in romans 8. he says
[42:02] likewise the spirit also heareth our
[42:04] infirmities
[42:06] for we know not what we should pray for
[42:08] as we ought
[42:10] but the spirit itself make it
[42:12] intercessions for us
[42:14] with groanings which cannot be uttered
[42:18] and he searches the heart knowing
[42:22] and knoweth what is the mind of god
[42:25] of the spirit because he maketh
[42:27] intercessions for the saints
[42:30] according to the will of god now when
[42:32] you see that kind of a thing
[42:34] it makes you know that even when you
[42:37] have shut down in your own
[42:39] spirit god is still working on your
[42:42] behalf
[42:44] amen because he is the master builder
[42:47] he is the one that's working in around
[42:50] and through through all of us and even
[42:53] when we
[42:54] know the the essence or the the
[42:56] seriousness of
[42:58] prayer and when we even fall to there
[43:01] god is always there to work it out for
[43:05] us
[43:05] that doesn't mean we supposed to become
[43:07] lazy christians
[43:09] hallelujah but this is for those of us
[43:11] who trip
[43:12] and fall sometime amen or stumble
[43:15] that means god when when when when he
[43:18] sees you in a position where satan
[43:20] has gotten you in a position when you
[43:24] can't pray or
[43:25] whether you want to pray or whatever the
[43:26] case may be but from the inside have you
[43:29] ever
[43:30] have you ever prayed and your prayer is
[43:32] so deep
[43:33] you don't even know the words to say but
[43:36] you just say oh
[43:36] lord have mercy oh lord help me
[43:40] and in those few words the spirit knows
[43:43] exactly what you're talking about
[43:45] even when satan who is the listener has
[43:48] no idea
[43:49] of what you're saying he searches the
[43:52] heart
[43:53] knowing what is in the mind of the
[43:55] spirit that because
[43:57] he maketh intercessions for the saints
[44:00] according to the will of god
[44:02] and we know that that's what paul says
[44:06] we know and sometimes you know like i
[44:09] said
[44:09] we're not here oh lord why me but we
[44:12] know
[44:13] all of us know those of us who are truly
[44:15] christians
[44:16] we want to do the perfect will of god
[44:19] amen i always tell people if i didn't
[44:22] have this old nasty flesh hook to me
[44:24] i would be perfect
[44:26] [Laughter]
[44:27] because the inside man is perfect this
[44:30] is the only part that hinders me
[44:33] right here and this old joker amen
[44:36] uh uh if you're not careful will sway
[44:39] your will
[44:41] away from god's will hallelujah
[44:45] and we know that all things work
[44:46] together for good to them that love god
[44:49] to them who are the called according to
[44:53] his purpose
[44:54] understand this every man don't receive
[44:57] a call
[44:58] that's right but there are those who
[45:00] receive calls
[45:02] and those who answer calls and when you
[45:05] answer the call
[45:06] god will respond to you but those who
[45:09] have been predestinated those who have
[45:11] been
[45:12] chosen those who have been elected
[45:15] amen to the call god amen
[45:18] will bring you to the purpose for which
[45:21] he called you far
[45:23] see we don't know what he called us for
[45:25] but he'll call us
[45:26] and then reveal to us as we go along
[45:30] his purpose for calling us is that right
[45:34] you think you take the seven church age
[45:35] messenger they didn't know who they were
[45:38] that's right it was way down the road
[45:40] when god began to reveal to them
[45:42] and perhaps luther never understood who
[45:44] he was but this last angel messenger
[45:48] whom god used it was his ministry had
[45:51] gone for a long time
[45:53] before he came to understand that he was
[45:56] actually
[45:57] revelations uh had something to do with
[46:01] revelation 10
[46:02] 7. he he
[46:05] he came to know amen that he had a
[46:08] spirit of elijah on him
[46:10] by way of his wife because his second
[46:14] wife wanted to know
[46:15] lord you know show me a sign show me a
[46:17] sign right
[46:18] and god showed her the word of god
[46:20] according to malachi 4.
[46:22] now for whom he foreknew
[46:26] right and for knowing it means he
[46:30] knows us and and these are the kind of
[46:32] things we need to meditate on
[46:34] because it's very difficult for some for
[46:36] us sometimes to think that he really
[46:38] knew
[46:38] us before and if he did
[46:42] how how was it understand
[46:45] god's thoughts are perfect so whatever
[46:49] and however
[46:50] he saw you it was imperfection amen
[46:53] he didn't see your earing he saw
[46:56] perfection amen he always see you
[47:00] in perfection hallelujah
[47:03] for he all knew us he also did
[47:07] uh he predestinated us to be conformed
[47:10] to the image of his son
[47:13] that he might be the first bond among
[47:16] many brethren so even that
[47:17] predestination and i'm not going to take
[47:19] too long here but i wanted to say
[47:21] amen predestination is to it previous
[47:25] beings before
[47:26] right and destin he knew exactly how far
[47:30] he was going to take you
[47:32] right you can't go no there are
[47:34] boundaries
[47:36] right you know we might want to go
[47:39] farther
[47:40] further but we can't go no further than
[47:43] what god has predestinated us to be
[47:46] some singers some musicians some this
[47:49] some that
[47:50] you know i heard uh uh uh a brother rich
[47:53] who told me a long time ago
[47:54] and i thought there was a marvelous
[47:56] thing that he said he said think about
[47:58] how great god
[47:59] is god knew exactly how many musicians
[48:03] to make
[48:04] how many physicians to make how many
[48:07] teachers to make how many artists to
[48:10] make
[48:11] he said every gift and calling of god
[48:14] was predestined
[48:17] and none of us had anything to do with
[48:19] it
[48:21] he knew exactly how many singers wish
[48:23] they could sing
[48:25] and how many people who who who love
[48:27] piano playing or whatever
[48:28] wish they could do it and it's not there
[48:31] hallelujah
[48:32] because those gifts were designed
[48:36] for individuals to have and think about
[48:40] it
[48:40] we don't ever seem to run out of them
[48:44] so for every age god has always those
[48:47] gifts but
[48:48] understand in all of in every age
[48:51] there'll
[48:51] always be somebody that seemed to
[48:54] supersede
[48:55] all of the rest all of the rest and it's
[48:59] nothing they've done
[49:00] and nothing you know you know whether it
[49:02] be an opera singer whether it be a piano
[49:04] player
[49:05] whether you know they have more of an
[49:07] effect
[49:08] on their age or their generation
[49:11] than any other
[49:14] but it doesn't make them any better it's
[49:17] just that
[49:17] it's just the gift that god has decided
[49:21] to give to them
[49:22] and those gifts were given to magnify
[49:25] god with even though we satan or the
[49:29] world
[49:29] use those gifts amen to glorify
[49:32] the devil y'all understand me they say
[49:34] the devil gave me a gift the devil they
[49:36] never gave you a gift
[49:38] every good and perfect gift
[49:41] comes from the lord and every one of
[49:44] those people who are using their talents
[49:47] to glorify god the devil will be judged
[49:50] for that
[49:51] because it's not something the devil
[49:53] gave them even though they would use it
[49:55] for him
[49:56] you love the lord amen so we understand
[50:00] by god's grace to
[50:02] be predestinated to be conformed to the
[50:05] image of his
[50:06] son that's what gets me yeah
[50:09] these trials and these tests that we're
[50:12] going through it's like we're going
[50:13] through a machinery
[50:15] something that's going to mold us and
[50:17] make us in
[50:18] to the you know to the image of god now
[50:20] realize that the clay
[50:21] the clay has no resistance
[50:25] if it's clay it moves at the master's
[50:28] hand
[50:30] hallelujah and that's the way god does
[50:32] with us
[50:33] we are the clay he's the potter we are
[50:35] the clay and many times when he putting
[50:37] the pressure on us to mold and to shape
[50:40] us
[50:40] those pressure points it's not a good
[50:42] thing you know you don't like it
[50:44] but remember we're being conformed
[50:48] we're being transformed we're being
[50:51] changed
[50:52] amen into the image and likeness of god
[50:55] see god's got a bride
[50:56] amen he has a bride and i don't care
[50:59] what the devil says
[51:00] the word keeps us just like
[51:03] the word predestinated us the word keeps
[51:07] us you are just as predestinated
[51:11] as jesus christ was amen amen
[51:14] mary you're going to have a son
[51:17] hallelujah
[51:18] mary mary wasn't the first one she was
[51:21] the first virgin being told that
[51:23] but isaiah saw it before mary knew it
[51:27] amen and no matter how many years it
[51:30] took
[51:30] for that that prophecy to come to pass
[51:33] it could not
[51:35] fall or it could not fail
[51:38] and when isaiah prophesied a virgin
[51:41] shall conceive
[51:42] god didn't have to go through a line of
[51:44] women trying to choose which one it
[51:46] would be
[51:47] god had already chose it was going to be
[51:50] married before the foundation of the
[51:51] world
[51:52] so is it with the bride of jesus christ
[51:55] god didn't have to go through a whole
[51:56] line of people to make a choice
[51:58] he knew your his choice his choice is
[52:01] perfect
[52:02] just like his will and you are the will
[52:04] of god
[52:05] made perfect manifested
[52:09] in this day that's how we are there's
[52:12] nothing the devil can do it he can't
[52:14] he can't stop this this will of god
[52:17] hallelujah he thought he could do it
[52:19] through death
[52:21] he thought if i could stop i could kill
[52:23] the people make them die
[52:24] i could keep them in prison hallelujah
[52:28] but once god pronounced life over you
[52:31] death has no hold hallelujah death can't
[52:34] even hold he couldn't hold jesus in the
[52:36] grave
[52:36] hallelujah is that all right you think
[52:39] about
[52:40] abraham and isaac and jacob hallelujah
[52:42] and all of them who have been
[52:44] in the ground for hundreds of years but
[52:47] when
[52:47] jesus rose they got up
[52:51] death lost his stain
[52:54] at calvary hallelujah and if we can
[52:58] continually to see that
[53:00] then no matter what satan comes excuse
[53:03] me
[53:03] no matter what satan brings before us
[53:06] we'll understand
[53:08] we are always in the will of god
[53:11] you understand me when you're under the
[53:13] blood
[53:15] you are always in the will of god
[53:19] why because satan can't come to you
[53:23] he can't come under the blood if he's
[53:26] under the blood he then becomes your
[53:27] brother
[53:28] hallelujah this is why it's so important
[53:31] in the presence amen once you stay
[53:35] in the presence of the lord hallelujah
[53:38] when satan comes amen to tempt you and
[53:41] and try
[53:42] you you must remind him satan i'm in the
[53:44] presence of the lord
[53:46] the lord is before me hallelujah amen
[53:49] when he tries to get you upset
[53:51] like the other day amen you must remind
[53:54] him
[53:54] i'm in the presence of the lord and the
[53:57] lord is before me
[53:58] in other words what you're trying to get
[54:00] me to do if i do it god is going to see
[54:03] it
[54:06] you understand me i can't do it i'm in
[54:09] the presence of the lord
[54:10] and the lord is before me that's how you
[54:12] keep that's how you keep him
[54:14] you keep saying about obey because
[54:16] that's the problem is
[54:18] eve and adam i don't know whether adam
[54:20] but they forgot
[54:22] who god was and even though uh uh god
[54:26] went through the garden
[54:27] adam adam we're out thou god knew where
[54:29] adam was
[54:31] god didn't have a lack of memory he knew
[54:33] exactly
[54:36] it's a strange thing is it that he
[54:38] walked in the direction that
[54:40] adam and he was
[54:43] he didn't care i can almost see him
[54:45] hiding behind the bush
[54:46] here's the bush and god says adam adam
[54:48] where are those
[54:52] lord here i am it wasn't like god didn't
[54:55] know what they were
[54:56] he wanted adam to understand where he
[54:59] was
[55:00] because now adam recognized through even
[55:02] the experience
[55:03] i'm in a place i've never been
[55:07] amen adam then knew from that point on
[55:11] he understood what it meant to be naked
[55:15] there was an experience that adam had
[55:17] never he always was clothed
[55:19] by the glory of god now he understands
[55:21] what naked is
[55:22] and then god says well who told you you
[55:25] were naked
[55:26] hallelujah and you say oh my goodness
[55:28] well
[55:29] it seemed like that was a mistake no sir
[55:32] no sir no sir
[55:33] god knew exactly what was going to
[55:35] happen this is why
[55:37] eve was the woman was made she was she
[55:40] was she was a weak of the vessels
[55:42] but god needed her a meant for his
[55:44] redemption plan
[55:46] hallelujah and god knew what adam was
[55:48] going to do
[55:49] that's why the lamb was slain before the
[55:51] foundation of the one
[55:53] that before earth started god had
[55:56] already in his mind
[55:57] knew what was going to take place and he
[55:59] knew it was going to be a lamb
[56:01] hallelujah
[56:03] you know god didn't go through the
[56:04] garden of eden said now which animal
[56:06] should die
[56:07] in adam and eve's dead he knew
[56:11] even the little lamb the first one that
[56:13] ever was slain
[56:14] god knew it was going to be that
[56:16] particular one
[56:18] you understand me so i'm trying to bring
[56:20] you to
[56:21] to understand that everything in your
[56:23] life as a christian
[56:25] everything whether it be good or evil uh
[56:28] however we judge it
[56:29] it still is in the will of god
[56:34] for example
[56:37] people say well jonah you know jonah was
[56:40] running from the presence of the lord
[56:42] jonah was in the will of god
[56:45] even though jonah did not know it
[56:48] he still was in the will of god god had
[56:51] already superseded him
[56:53] had already prepared a well for jonah's
[56:57] transportation
[57:02] amen sometimes we think we're out of the
[57:04] will of god and you're right there where
[57:06] god wants you to be
[57:10] elected of god being conformed into the
[57:12] image of god
[57:13] is that right oh you said well what
[57:15] about what about what abraham went down
[57:17] to egypt god said don't go down there
[57:21] don't go and that in his own will
[57:25] in his own will he went down to egypt
[57:28] anyway
[57:28] here is king abimelech right i think his
[57:31] name was that
[57:32] anyhow he sees he sees uh
[57:35] sarah and say oh what a beautiful lady
[57:38] right god knew and at the same time it
[57:42] looked like
[57:43] abraham was getting into trouble right
[57:46] because remember abraham's covenant was
[57:47] unconditional
[57:49] however whatever abraham did god had
[57:51] already put in
[57:52] an unconditional so god has could not
[57:55] curse him the only thing god could do
[57:56] with blessing
[57:57] so he goes down into egypt get into a
[58:01] king of immigrant
[58:02] territory he sees a biblical sees
[58:05] amen sarah as as a beautiful woman wants
[58:09] to marry her
[58:10] amen like any man would any king
[58:13] and now he's getting in trouble not
[58:15] abraham
[58:16] the king and god has to come to him and
[58:19] says hey
[58:20] hold up if you touch her you're going to
[58:23] die
[58:25] but lord you know i wouldn't yes i know
[58:28] you would not have done
[58:29] i know this you as a righteous man
[58:31] that's why i visited you
[58:32] visited you as in a dream so that you
[58:35] will know
[58:36] but let me tell you something just
[58:38] because i want you to know
[58:39] that you got to go to abraham
[58:42] [Music]
[58:44] ask abraham to forgive you you
[58:47] understand me
[58:48] as abraham for his forgiveness and have
[58:51] abraham to pray for you whoa
[58:53] lord have mercy but lord he was the one
[58:55] that lies
[58:56] you see what i'm saying when god
[58:59] justifies you
[59:01] who gonna lay any charge to you
[59:05] it doesn't give us the right to do wrong
[59:07] or to do evil
[59:08] but whenever we get in trouble god is on
[59:11] on the scene
[59:12] to bring us out of it and not only that
[59:15] god told abraham i won't bless you
[59:18] and going down to egypt god blessed him
[59:22] hey is that the truth hallelujah what
[59:24] was the king had to give
[59:26] abraham a i call it a tithing had to
[59:28] give him
[59:29] some of everything and now abraham is
[59:32] leaving out of egypt with more stuff
[59:33] than he had before he got there
[59:36] see that's the god i serve lord
[59:40] amen and you are what abraham
[59:43] see and brother branham said as god
[59:45] dealt with abraham
[59:47] god deals with abraham's seed in the
[59:49] same way
[59:50] amen amen who the devil don't like that
[59:54] one
[59:55] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[59:57] he also called
[59:59] whom he called them he also justified
[1:00:01] and whom he justified
[1:00:03] them he also glorified and what shall i
[1:00:06] say
[1:00:07] to these things if god before us
[1:00:10] who can be against us as long as
[1:00:14] god is for us no man no matter who he is
[1:00:19] they cannot prevail because when god is
[1:00:23] for us
[1:00:24] he becomes our battle axe he becomes our
[1:00:28] protector
[1:00:29] he he's our assurance
[1:00:32] that we shall prevail is that right
[1:00:36] we're winning in his presence amen
[1:00:38] hallelujah
[1:00:40] as i said this morning when we
[1:00:42] recognized that the sin
[1:00:44] that we first were born in has been
[1:00:46] totally
[1:00:47] uh uh done away with and then every time
[1:00:51] we make confessions to god
[1:00:52] see that's what the devil don't like he
[1:00:54] like for you you know to feel so bad to
[1:00:57] you can't confess and make right no sir
[1:00:59] i don't care whether it's small or
[1:01:00] whether it's great
[1:01:01] make right with god keep the blood of
[1:01:03] jesus christ over you
[1:01:05] amen because once the blood is on your
[1:01:08] side
[1:01:08] you're perfect you understand that as
[1:01:11] long as you're under the blood of jesus
[1:01:13] christ
[1:01:14] you're perfect and the reason why you're
[1:01:16] perfect
[1:01:17] is because he's perfect and brother
[1:01:19] branham said it like this god don't see
[1:01:21] your sins
[1:01:21] as long as you under the blood he only
[1:01:24] hears your voice
[1:01:25] but he sees the blood of jesus
[1:01:29] [Applause]
[1:01:31] oh my goodness see and you and i we
[1:01:34] understand by god's grace see
[1:01:35] if we could see how free we are the
[1:01:38] bible can't be wrong
[1:01:40] he whom the son is set free is free
[1:01:42] indeed and where the spirit of the lord
[1:01:44] is liv there's liberty
[1:01:45] so we're free we're free what from the
[1:01:48] bondage of sin and death
[1:01:50] literally free when christ is in you
[1:01:53] you're free from sin and death
[1:01:55] because the bible says as long as that
[1:01:57] seed is in you you cannot see him
[1:02:00] hallelujah am i crazy or something
[1:02:04] but the truth of the matter is we stand
[1:02:06] free
[1:02:07] whole before the lord we make mistakes
[1:02:10] that's what james said
[1:02:11] but the bible tells us also that if we
[1:02:13] confess our sins
[1:02:15] he is faithful and just to forgive us of
[1:02:17] our sins and to cleanse us from all
[1:02:19] unrighteousness
[1:02:21] and god do not run to the altar
[1:02:25] every time you make mistakes the bible
[1:02:28] said amen
[1:02:29] once and for all
[1:02:30] [Laughter]
[1:02:33] once and for all from the time you're
[1:02:37] saved to the time is finished once
[1:02:42] he saw it all even your tomorrow he saw
[1:02:46] it all
[1:02:47] hallelujah and he knows that in your
[1:02:50] heart
[1:02:50] because he knows that in your heart
[1:02:52] you'll make it right before you make it
[1:02:54] right
[1:02:57] hallelujah and understand the laws of
[1:03:00] sowing and reaping
[1:03:02] and this is one thing the believers must
[1:03:04] come to see
[1:03:05] not just in tithing and offering but in
[1:03:07] all of your life
[1:03:08] whatever you sow you shall reap all
[1:03:11] right
[1:03:12] in other words give him all oh
[1:03:16] i mentioned the other day when i was
[1:03:17] preaching on this samson
[1:03:19] you know gave god his strength god don't
[1:03:21] want your strength he wants your heart
[1:03:24] he wants you to love him love the lord
[1:03:26] with all your heart
[1:03:27] and lean not to your own understanding
[1:03:30] not your own will
[1:03:32] love him with all of your heart this is
[1:03:35] where i get a little frustrated with me
[1:03:38] because i want to love him with all my
[1:03:40] heart
[1:03:41] amen i hate it when my will gets in my
[1:03:44] way
[1:03:46] hallelujah hallelujah see
[1:03:49] you and i must understand when we give
[1:03:51] him all
[1:03:52] all of your i will that means we we have
[1:03:55] come to a place that we're
[1:03:56] totally dead and rotted
[1:04:00] and this is what god wants from us total
[1:04:02] death
[1:04:03] total death so much so to you rot
[1:04:06] because really in the law of sowing
[1:04:08] that's the only way we can live
[1:04:11] right two germ lives can come out of one
[1:04:14] seed
[1:04:15] the only seed of like the light that we
[1:04:16] want to come out
[1:04:18] of this is the life of christ right
[1:04:21] listen amen according to ii corinthians
[1:04:24] 9
[1:04:25] 6 through 80 says but this i say he
[1:04:28] would show it sparingly shall reap
[1:04:30] also sparingly and people say well you
[1:04:33] know god don't talk to me
[1:04:35] well how much do you talk to him
[1:04:40] you you put it in a little prayer you
[1:04:42] get a little answer
[1:04:44] right amen you've got to pray
[1:04:47] you got to give god all like our brother
[1:04:49] said pray without ceasing do you
[1:04:51] understand what that means if you pray
[1:04:53] without ceasing
[1:04:54] you you'll be fully overflowed with the
[1:04:57] response from god
[1:05:00] that's the communion that god wants
[1:05:03] that's what he wants but if he's fairly
[1:05:05] you know pray that's all you're gonna
[1:05:06] get
[1:05:07] right and he would showeth bountifully
[1:05:10] shall reap also bountifully
[1:05:14] amen every man accordingly has his
[1:05:16] purpose
[1:05:17] in his heart so let him give not
[1:05:19] grudgingly
[1:05:20] or necessity for god loveth the cheerful
[1:05:23] giver and you know that's what happened
[1:05:24] like i said even when it comes
[1:05:26] amen to the song service or when it
[1:05:28] comes to worship
[1:05:29] people grudgingly gives him you know i'm
[1:05:31] grudgingly you know
[1:05:33] oh don't let the pastor or the preacher
[1:05:34] or the song y'all raise your hand oh my
[1:05:37] goodness
[1:05:39] no they don't normally frown like that
[1:05:43] but you can almost feel it oh don't ask
[1:05:45] them to stand up will y'all stand up and
[1:05:47] give god the glory
[1:05:53] and then they don't give him the whole
[1:05:55] cup they give him a half a cup
[1:05:56] you know give him a half a cup you give
[1:05:58] him the whole cup but you see
[1:06:00] what people don't understand as you yo
[1:06:03] yeah
[1:06:04] every action even whether newton's law
[1:06:07] for every action is the opposite an
[1:06:09] equal reaction
[1:06:12] yes so when you see these things working
[1:06:17] and you think okay i'm going to give him
[1:06:18] that well that's all you're going to get
[1:06:21] see you see you you look at let's say it
[1:06:24] like this
[1:06:25] when you had blind bottom mayors who
[1:06:28] couldn't see
[1:06:29] didn't know where jesus was heard that
[1:06:31] was he he was in the crowd
[1:06:33] right he knew just screaming and cr
[1:06:37] screaming he ain't going to get his
[1:06:39] attention god don't care how loud your
[1:06:41] church is
[1:06:43] you can scream all you want to but when
[1:06:45] it comes from your heart
[1:06:47] that's a different story all those
[1:06:50] people were thrown in jesus
[1:06:52] but when blind by the man's cried he
[1:06:54] cried from his heart
[1:06:57] though son of david have mercy on me
[1:07:00] i can almost hear him and jesus turned
[1:07:04] you know what i mean it touched him do
[1:07:06] you understand
[1:07:07] his cry had to go to heaven and come
[1:07:09] back down
[1:07:16] because he was he you understand what i
[1:07:18] mean because he turned and says you know
[1:07:21] even when the woman with the issue of
[1:07:22] blood who touched me that kind of a
[1:07:26] thing
[1:07:29] oh my god we're talking about a serving
[1:07:32] of god
[1:07:32] and all god wants is this that little
[1:07:36] thing that beats in there
[1:07:37] is a place in there where god enthrones
[1:07:39] himself and god wants that space
[1:07:42] think about it god could have had a big
[1:07:44] hole in your heart
[1:07:45] right but it's a little pinhead
[1:07:48] right not that big come on we can't give
[1:07:51] him that
[1:07:52] that's all he wants just that little
[1:07:54] space in the heart to oper oh
[1:07:57] god it makes me ashamed of myself you
[1:07:59] know
[1:08:00] it makes me ashamed of myself with all
[1:08:02] that that he doesn't ask for
[1:08:04] half of your heart he doesn't ask for
[1:08:06] you know space just a little space
[1:08:09] that scientists finally found
[1:08:12] as a man thinketh in his heart so is he
[1:08:16] god help us help us help us
[1:08:20] whoo my listen
[1:08:23] and god is able to make all grace abound
[1:08:26] toward

[1:09:28] work
[1:09:30] [Applause]
[1:09:32] that's the will of god you understand me
[1:09:35] so we have the press to what the will of
[1:09:37] god we want the will of god
[1:09:40] to be made manifest in our lives
[1:09:47] he said it can't happen yes it can
[1:09:52] solomon who never asked god for anything
[1:09:57] but in his heart he wanted to know how
[1:10:01] to rule
[1:10:02] god's people and god broke forth a
[1:10:05] in a dream a dream
[1:10:08] and saw and showed and talked to solomon
[1:10:11] and saw and asked solomon what would he
[1:10:13] have i could i give you whatever you
[1:10:15] want
[1:10:16] and solomon says lord all i want
[1:10:19] to do is know how to rule your people
[1:10:23] even as you would in other words i won't
[1:10:26] love them like you do i want to rule
[1:10:28] them however i just want that
[1:10:30] i want to do it just like you would do
[1:10:32] it it touched
[1:10:33] god amen solomon
[1:10:36] not only am i going to let this happen
[1:10:38] to you but i'm going to give you
[1:10:39] whatever you want
[1:10:41] and he did you love the lord
[1:10:47] i read that scripture this morning
[1:10:50] just give me a few more minutes i read
[1:10:53] that scripture this morning where
[1:10:55] in luke where jesus was praying and and
[1:10:58] that
[1:10:59] that always get me father if thou be
[1:11:01] willing remove this cup from me
[1:11:04] what was he saying in his humanity it
[1:11:05] was it was it was tough
[1:11:08] you know a lot of us don't understand he
[1:11:10] felt it all
[1:11:12] right brother branham said he went to
[1:11:14] calvary
[1:11:16] alone he went there as a man
[1:11:20] he felt the smacks in his face he felt
[1:11:23] the spitting
[1:11:23] he felt the rejection and every one of
[1:11:26] us know what rejection feels like
[1:11:28] that's a horrible feeling ain't nothing
[1:11:30] like it
[1:11:31] but to know that i came into my own and
[1:11:34] my own received me
[1:11:36] not that's really hurtful and yet he
[1:11:39] felt
[1:11:40] all those things and under all that
[1:11:42] pressure and he
[1:11:43] never broke he never broke people
[1:11:47] he kept his eyes the bible said he set
[1:11:49] his face like a flint
[1:11:50] why it was revealed to him his purpose
[1:11:54] and his calling and he understood this
[1:11:57] is something that i
[1:11:59] i must do i must do
[1:12:02] i am the savior i am that lamb
[1:12:05] isaiah spoke of is that right he found
[1:12:08] his identity
[1:12:09] in the word and he stayed with it
[1:12:13] because it was his revelation hallelujah
[1:12:17] he stayed with it understanding the pain
[1:12:20] and sorrows that he had to go
[1:12:22] through come on think about it
[1:12:25] you and i we're going to go through
[1:12:26] something we must understand
[1:12:28] the pain and the sorrows that we're
[1:12:29] going to go through and yet
[1:12:31] lord not my will but let thine they die
[1:12:35] every christian it gotta suffer you're
[1:12:37] gonna go through something
[1:12:38] jesus said if they did it in the green
[1:12:41] they're gonna do it in the dry
[1:12:42] you understand me there is no way a
[1:12:45] christian you're gonna be a christian
[1:12:46] and not suffer
[1:12:47] one way or another it it must happen
[1:12:51] because that's that brings on growth
[1:12:55] persecution brings on growth to be
[1:12:58] rejected brings on growth it brings you
[1:13:00] to a place where you really
[1:13:01] know you come to know who you really are
[1:13:05] hallelujah i'm so glad and i know this
[1:13:07] sounds really wicked to somebody who may
[1:13:09] be
[1:13:09] carnal but one thing let's say it like
[1:13:11] this so it won't be offensive
[1:13:13] this coronavirus this covert 19
[1:13:16] has made me come to know more so
[1:13:20] on who i am i've seen god
[1:13:23] in this period greater now than ever
[1:13:26] before
[1:13:28] hallelujah and i know amen with all
[1:13:31] those who are
[1:13:32] he i could have said running and and and
[1:13:35] uh
[1:13:35] uh oh there's a word i want to use but
[1:13:38] anyway they
[1:13:39] they're leaving the message at a time
[1:13:41] like this
[1:13:43] but you see this is the beginning
[1:13:47] of what i call the beginning
[1:13:50] of the beginning because it's a
[1:13:53] beginning of a new world order
[1:13:56] and it's the beginning for the bride and
[1:13:58] her eternal
[1:13:59] affairs in life with christ
[1:14:02] time will be no more the revelation of
[1:14:04] god is finished
[1:14:06] is that right amen the jehovah of the
[1:14:09] old testament is jesus christ of the new
[1:14:12] the only thing is just a changing of a
[1:14:15] mask amen
[1:14:16] changing of mass we didn't understand it
[1:14:18] but god hid it
[1:14:20] all along he hid it in the lamb that was
[1:14:23] jesus
[1:14:24] he hid it in the in the red heifer that
[1:14:26] was jesus hallelujah he hid it in the
[1:14:28] dove that was symbolic of jesus
[1:14:30] all those symbols were symbolic of one
[1:14:33] god
[1:14:35] and in the way he would perform and do
[1:14:39] uh with the people throughout the ages
[1:14:42] we must yield to the will of god and god
[1:14:45] is going to bring us to the test
[1:14:47] this is what we don't understand i think
[1:14:48] i don't say it like that we don't
[1:14:50] but let me say it like this all the
[1:14:52] squeeze is going to come yes
[1:14:54] but what is it it is to press you
[1:14:58] it's to push you into a place where you
[1:15:01] must
[1:15:02] yield one way or the other right
[1:15:05] it it with the holy ghost
[1:15:08] you'll yield like peter crucified me
[1:15:12] upside down i'm not worthy to be
[1:15:15] crucified
[1:15:15] like my lord and on the other hand you
[1:15:19] can still
[1:15:20] act like peter before the conversion
[1:15:24] i don't know him cursed him to
[1:15:27] is that right cursed him three times
[1:15:30] before the crew i don't know him
[1:15:34] that's the unconverted man and that man
[1:15:37] peter unconverted and peter converted is
[1:15:40] going to be squeezed
[1:15:43] hallelujah yes sir
[1:15:47] but then when that squeeze comes you
[1:15:50] know
[1:15:51] wow hallelujah like i said i know
[1:15:55] my redeemer liveth that's what joe said
[1:15:58] squeezed out to nothing amen
[1:16:00] all it was was a big
[1:16:03] flesh with boils and everything else on
[1:16:05] it
[1:16:06] talk about rejection talking about
[1:16:08] nobody
[1:16:09] standing alone wife doesn't separate it
[1:16:12] from you pretty much
[1:16:13] children gone you all by yourself you
[1:16:16] and jesus
[1:16:19] but one thing about joel he knew no
[1:16:22] matter what i go through
[1:16:24] the covenant still stands
[1:16:27] that's all i'm saying no matter what you
[1:16:29] go through the covenants still stand
[1:16:31] and guess what job didn't know he was in
[1:16:33] the will of god
[1:16:35] what even in his suffering he was in the
[1:16:37] will of god
[1:16:38] in jesus suffering he was in the will of
[1:16:41] god in
[1:16:42] samson's suffering he was in the will of
[1:16:44] god
[1:16:46] people think because i suffer i'm not in
[1:16:48] the will of god no sir
[1:16:49] many times god bring you through the
[1:16:51] suffering
[1:16:54] those hebrew boys they were in the
[1:16:56] suffering daniel was in the suffering
[1:16:58] in the will of god in the will of god
[1:17:01] you mean to tell me god
[1:17:02] yes he will a lot of time we want the
[1:17:05] shortcut
[1:17:06] god don't never take your shortcuts he
[1:17:08] takes you through
[1:17:09] the longer way right seven days they
[1:17:12] could have been in in the promised land
[1:17:14] and he took him 40 years and the
[1:17:16] scripture says i think according to
[1:17:18] chronicles
[1:17:19] that god took him took them through
[1:17:21] there to
[1:17:22] so that they could know what was in
[1:17:24] their hearts that's either chronicles of
[1:17:26] deuteronomy i can't remember
[1:17:28] but the whole point is you and i know
[1:17:30] that this test
[1:17:31] these things that we're going through
[1:17:32] now what what happens what
[1:17:34] what is it revealing to you what's in
[1:17:36] your heart
[1:17:38] amen what's in your heart i thank god
[1:17:42] for it
[1:17:43] right think about paul who had been
[1:17:48] oh my goodness paul was applauding those
[1:17:51] folks
[1:17:52] yeah kill him kill him kill him hit him
[1:17:54] with another stone
[1:17:55] kill him right cheerleader for them
[1:17:59] stoning stephen
[1:18:01] i'll hold your coat get him you know
[1:18:03] that kind of a thing but you got to
[1:18:05] realize
[1:18:05] paul was still in the will of god
[1:18:08] hallelujah
[1:18:09] is that right brother branham said god
[1:18:11] used
[1:18:12] that as a driving force
[1:18:16] amen for paul because
[1:18:20] paul felt so guilty for being
[1:18:23] an uh uh there and
[1:18:26] as as stephen's adversary
[1:18:29] you know he was feeling so guilty that
[1:18:32] he was one who
[1:18:33] actually helped this thing happen
[1:18:36] he never got over it and that was the
[1:18:39] thing
[1:18:40] god would use to keep pushing paul
[1:18:44] you know making him feel like so
[1:18:46] unworthy
[1:18:47] oh how many times he was found you know
[1:18:50] stoned dead or three times i think it
[1:18:52] wasn't reservation you didn't tell me i
[1:18:54] gotta die again you gotta die again
[1:18:57] but you see it it just what he had to go
[1:19:00] through and
[1:19:01] and listen paul god didn't just leave it
[1:19:05] there
[1:19:05] paul had a thorn in his flesh too
[1:19:09] to keep him humble with the mighty
[1:19:11] revelation that he had of god
[1:19:13] god had to keep him humble hallelujah
[1:19:16] y'all understand what i'm saying
[1:19:17] a lot of times the more revelation you
[1:19:19] have the understanding of god that you
[1:19:21] have the more suffering you go through
[1:19:23] only to keep this boy this flesh
[1:19:26] in his proper place but no without a
[1:19:29] shout of god
[1:19:30] doubt amen you're in the will of god
[1:19:33] amen
[1:19:33] amen you're in the will of god you've
[1:19:36] been called out
[1:19:38] and called into and god has never lost
[1:19:41] one
[1:19:42] and he never will but both of them knew
[1:19:46] the will of god
[1:19:48] and when it came to paul when paul knew
[1:19:51] that he had to go down to nero's
[1:19:52] chopping block
[1:19:55] paul didn't say oh whoa it's me
[1:19:58] paul had done went through so much
[1:20:00] perhaps amen nero shock and block looked
[1:20:03] like a delight to him
[1:20:04] you understand me he had been stoned and
[1:20:06] beaten and shipwrecked and
[1:20:08] you name it paul they've gone through it
[1:20:10] can you imagine knowing that i'm getting
[1:20:12] ready to get my final exam
[1:20:14] my final test let me go remember they
[1:20:17] tried to keep
[1:20:18] paul from going to see nero but paul
[1:20:20] made every
[1:20:21] he pushed his way there because god told
[1:20:24] him you got to go before him
[1:20:28] and then i could see paul now laughing
[1:20:31] laughing at death oh death where's your
[1:20:34] staying o
[1:20:34] great where's your victory thanks be to
[1:20:37] god who
[1:20:38] giveth me giveth us victory
[1:20:42] through our lord and savior jesus christ
[1:20:44] it was given to him
[1:20:45] paul knew that paul understood he was
[1:20:48] worthy of death you know the law
[1:20:50] you know listen let me move on what do
[1:20:52] you look like
[1:20:54] what are you following what have we done
[1:20:57] you must choose your leader choose today
[1:21:00] choose life or death your choice will
[1:21:03] determine your eternal destiny
[1:21:05] and what you choose remember jesus said
[1:21:08] follow me
[1:21:10] and you and and you're invited tonight
[1:21:13] to do so
[1:21:14] and to follow him is to is to is to
[1:21:17] eternal life
[1:21:18] you must come to his terms that's right
[1:21:21] the word
[1:21:22] not upon the creed not upon the public
[1:21:24] not upon opinion
[1:21:26] not upon what anybody else thinks about
[1:21:28] it but
[1:21:29] on what god says about it and this is
[1:21:32] why people don't want to die to their
[1:21:34] will
[1:21:34] my mama was a baptist my daddy was a
[1:21:36] presbyterian
[1:21:38] my grandma was a lutheran whatever the
[1:21:40] case may be whatever worked for them
[1:21:42] then
[1:21:43] will not work for you now why because
[1:21:46] the will of god has
[1:21:47] changed and he's moving on up
[1:21:51] amen preparing his self of people
[1:21:54] for a translation you cannot
[1:21:57] make the translation looking like the
[1:21:59] world acting like the world
[1:22:01] thinking like the world the only those
[1:22:03] of us who make the rapture
[1:22:05] will be those who will allow the mind of
[1:22:08] christ
[1:22:09] let this mind be in you that was also in
[1:22:12] christ
[1:22:13] jesus that's right that's where we are
[1:22:17] right proverbs 3 5-7 trust in the lord
[1:22:20] with all thine heart
[1:22:22] lean not to thine own understanding in
[1:22:24] all thy ways acknowledge him
[1:22:26] and he shall direct thy path be not wise
[1:22:30] in thy own eyes fear the lord and depart
[1:22:34] from evil
[1:22:35] let me say it like this people none of
[1:22:37] us is worthy
[1:22:39] to enter behind the holies
[1:22:42] of holies none of us
[1:22:45] in ourselves could ever enter there
[1:22:49] it takes god it takes the holy spirit
[1:22:53] to prepare you and to rob you
[1:22:57] you understand me you have to be robed
[1:23:00] you must be in him and he must be in you
[1:23:03] robed to go behind that veil
[1:23:07] and to stay behind that veil because
[1:23:09] that's where god wants us
[1:23:11] to stay behind that veil when you stay
[1:23:13] behind that veil guess what it's
[1:23:14] communion with you
[1:23:16] and god alone that's when people
[1:23:20] really think you're crazy he's a strange
[1:23:22] fellow
[1:23:22] [Music]
[1:23:24] all he do is talk about jesus watch him
[1:23:26] here he comes again
[1:23:28] man i'm coming again that's right all i
[1:23:30] can tell you is i got jesus on my mind
[1:23:32] that's
[1:23:33] it take it or leave it whatever you want
[1:23:35] to do
[1:23:36] think about it but god wants our report
[1:23:39] to be a positive report not a negative
[1:23:41] no matter what we go through we must
[1:23:44] keep the report
[1:23:45] positive y'all understand me ten spies
[1:23:48] came back
[1:23:49] from canaan saying with an evil report
[1:23:52] report what
[1:23:53] god showed them told them what the will
[1:23:55] of god was i want you to go over there
[1:23:57] i want you the priest already preached
[1:23:58] to him go over there
[1:24:00] i want you to conquer everything
[1:24:02] wherever your feet
[1:24:04] wherever they land it's yours i've given
[1:24:06] you the land you got to fight for it but
[1:24:08] i've given it to you
[1:24:09] as long as you stay within my will as
[1:24:12] long as you stay within my word
[1:24:14] i fight every battle for you so is it
[1:24:17] today amen
[1:24:18] as long as you stay in the will as long
[1:24:20] as you stand the word god will fight
[1:24:22] every one of your battles
[1:24:25] it was only when it can broke the word
[1:24:28] and and men i think 300 men died in that
[1:24:31] instant dance
[1:24:32] hallelujah amen but once that was
[1:24:35] restored
[1:24:36] amen that was fixed amen the protection
[1:24:40] of god
[1:24:40] continued hallelujah but those spies
[1:24:43] came back they said we can't do it
[1:24:45] now we look at this and we say well how
[1:24:47] could they do that don't you realize
[1:24:49] that most of canaan
[1:24:50] was full of giants almost every one of
[1:24:54] those tribes
[1:24:56] were giants are related to them
[1:24:59] every time i know sharp they talk
[1:25:01] about giants
[1:25:03] and that's what those uh jews went in
[1:25:05] there
[1:25:06] and they saw those great big giants i'm
[1:25:09] not talking about seven footers i'm
[1:25:10] talking about taller than that
[1:25:14] and back in the day the normal man was
[1:25:15] short anyhow
[1:25:18] jesus was short but you look and
[1:25:21] you know if it wasn't so saul was one of
[1:25:24] the tallest of them all and god pointed
[1:25:26] him out
[1:25:28] right because most of the tall men in
[1:25:29] that day were giants
[1:25:31] so when when they went in there the the
[1:25:33] anakins and the
[1:25:34] and the canaanites and all those people
[1:25:36] out there they were big guys
[1:25:41] and you know what they weren't only big
[1:25:44] they had
[1:25:45] uh war material chariots made out of
[1:25:49] iron
[1:25:50] and you know that's kind of what it was
[1:25:53] and and in the natural
[1:25:54] eye how in the world can we do this
[1:25:56] we're coming out of egypt and we don't
[1:25:57] even have a chariot
[1:25:58] [Laughter]
[1:26:01] hallelujah but you see that ain't the
[1:26:03] way god fight
[1:26:05] not by power not by might but by my
[1:26:07] spirit said the lord
[1:26:08] god don't fight with your strength god
[1:26:11] fight with his strength
[1:26:13] he uses you is that right come on you
[1:26:16] think
[1:26:16] samson wouldn't have been able to kill
[1:26:19] what 600
[1:26:21] philistines with the jawbone of an ass
[1:26:25] you think that was samson's strength
[1:26:27] that was god's strength
[1:26:30] it's always god's strength
[1:26:34] is that right you must bring back a
[1:26:37] positive report never
[1:26:38] i don't care y'all help me you hear me
[1:26:41] say something negative
[1:26:42] correct me please help me because this
[1:26:44] is not a time to be
[1:26:45] negative it's positive everything with
[1:26:48] god is yes
[1:26:49] i don't care what we're going through
[1:26:50] financially physically
[1:26:52] whatever it's still god is good yes sir
[1:26:55] right the ministry of joshua was to be
[1:26:59] magnified before the people according to
[1:27:02] joshua 3 7. is that right
[1:27:04] and the lord said unto joshua this day
[1:27:06] will i begin to magnify thee in the
[1:27:08] sight of the of
[1:27:09] all your israel that they may know that
[1:27:12] as i was with moses so i'll be with thee
[1:27:15] this will say it to the people so you
[1:27:17] got to understand also
[1:27:19] amen this was a great day and then for
[1:27:22] the people to know
[1:27:23] that god was with them but instead we
[1:27:25] come back with a
[1:27:26] a bad report let me tell you something
[1:27:28] it does that we talk about the world
[1:27:30] council churches
[1:27:31] we talk about all of these things that
[1:27:32] are taking place these are the giants in
[1:27:34] the land
[1:27:35] hallelujah but we already know
[1:27:39] david was a giant slayer amen and
[1:27:41] understand my god is still a giant
[1:27:43] slayer
[1:27:44] i believe in the supernatural right

[1:27:49] you talking about have you so forgotten
[1:27:52] how god has brought you already where is
[1:27:54] your testimony

[1:28:03] we're more than able yes sir the lord
[1:28:06] brought us out of egypt
[1:28:08] the lord brought us through the
[1:28:09] wilderness god fed us
[1:28:12] god clothed us and you mean to tell me
[1:28:15] that you're going to fret at these
[1:28:16] giants
[1:28:17] he's still god you understand
[1:28:20] he's still god and god wants us to be in
[1:28:24] his will as powerful soldiers
[1:28:26] is that right put on the whole arm of
[1:28:28] god and that's what god is trying to
[1:28:30] tell us
[1:28:30] you didn't come for a picnic you came to
[1:28:32] fight amen
[1:28:35] i'm almost done you know
[1:28:40] the bible says in john 16 says in that
[1:28:42] day you should ask me
[1:28:43] nothing very very i say unto you
[1:28:45] whatsoever you ask
[1:28:46] in the father the father in my name he
[1:28:49] will give it to you how many all believe
[1:28:50] that
[1:28:52] hallelujah that's the word hear the two
[1:28:54] have ye asked
[1:28:55] nothing in my name ask and ye shall
[1:28:57] receive that what your joy may be for
[1:29:01] he gonna give it to you to do what to
[1:29:02] make sure your joy is full
[1:29:05] [Laughter]
[1:29:07] knowing that jehovah of the old
[1:29:09] testament is jesus christ is the new
[1:29:10] amen so there's the power in the name of
[1:29:14] jesus
[1:29:15] hallelujah oh i'm almost done
[1:29:18] let me hurry hear me hurry amen like i
[1:29:20] said philippians says let this mind be
[1:29:22] in you which was in christ jesus
[1:29:24] you've never seen jesus christ run
[1:29:28] from a battle amen you've never seen him
[1:29:30] fight
[1:29:31] hallelujah have you his battling was
[1:29:35] by god alone there were times he walked
[1:29:38] through
[1:29:39] through the crowds because there were
[1:29:41] times they wanted to make him king
[1:29:43] and it was not yet time for him to be
[1:29:45] crowned
[1:29:46] and he did things because he knew the
[1:29:48] word was not that was not
[1:29:50] time it wasn't time for that to take
[1:29:52] place
[1:29:54] but never did jesus say i'm scared
[1:29:57] i'm afraid even in the garden of
[1:30:00] gethsemane he said father i wouldn't
[1:30:02] this cup
[1:30:03] passed from me but he not one negative
[1:30:06] word came out of his mouth he never said
[1:30:09] lord
[1:30:09] i just don't think i can do it no he
[1:30:12] never said it
[1:30:14] he kept his words he kept he watched the
[1:30:16] gate of his mouth
[1:30:18] he made sure that every word came out
[1:30:20] that it
[1:30:21] lined up with the bible with his
[1:30:23] prophecy
[1:30:24] he said nothing contrary he kept this
[1:30:27] thing
[1:30:28] right in line with god hallelujah
[1:30:32] you know why i'm saying these things eh
[1:30:34] because if the divine nature is going to
[1:30:36] be in you
[1:30:36] these are the kinds of qualities that
[1:30:38] made it
[1:30:39] these faith virtues knowledge knowledge
[1:30:42] to know what he did how he did it
[1:30:44] the temperance the patience it took
[1:30:46] jesus to magnify
[1:30:48] all of those things throughout his life
[1:30:52] throughout his life and this is what
[1:30:54] made us know that he was crowned with
[1:30:55] divine love
[1:30:56] because on the day of his crucifixion he
[1:30:58] said father forgive them for they know
[1:31:00] not what they do
[1:31:02] who could forgive like that you're still
[1:31:05] hurting with pain
[1:31:06] beating blood is everywhere and you ask
[1:31:09] him for their forgiveness
[1:31:12] what a mighty man he was what a mighty
[1:31:14] lamb i call him the mighty lamb
[1:31:17] what about the lamb hallelujah
[1:31:21] hallelujah listen
[1:31:24] i know i've gone a little longer than i
[1:31:26] wanted to he said unless
[1:31:27] anything dies and rot life can't come
[1:31:31] from it
[1:31:32] unless a man dying rod in his own
[1:31:34] thoughts christ
[1:31:36] can't get into his heart when you're
[1:31:39] trying to think for yourself
[1:31:41] now if i walk up to the altar and say
[1:31:43] yes lord
[1:31:44] i'm a fine fella i'll take you i'll pay
[1:31:47] my tithe
[1:31:48] i'll do this he said you got to die and
[1:31:51] rot right there to your thoughts
[1:31:53] let the holy ghost takes over and just
[1:31:55] do whatever he wants
[1:31:57] to do with you get kind of messy with it
[1:32:00] that sounds horrible not sacrilegious
[1:32:03] but it's the truth it's the only way i
[1:32:06] know how to punch the thing
[1:32:07] out to make you understand it what was
[1:32:10] more of a mess than the
[1:32:12] dignified bunch of jews that day than to
[1:32:15] see
[1:32:16] these people coming out there with
[1:32:18] stammering lips
[1:32:19] you know what a stammering lip is
[1:32:22] he said other tongues and acting like
[1:32:25] drunk people
[1:32:29] and then he says that's exactly what
[1:32:31] they were doing
[1:32:32] they looked messy and he said are these
[1:32:35] men
[1:32:36] all full of new wine but after one of a
[1:32:39] kind of got up
[1:32:40] to himself and he says let this be known
[1:32:43] unto you
[1:32:44] and hearken to my words these are not
[1:32:46] drunk like you suppose
[1:32:48] it is but he went back to the scripture
[1:32:51] this is that that was spoken by of the
[1:32:54] prophet joel
[1:32:55] and it comes and it shall come to pass
[1:32:57] in the last days said the lord
[1:32:59] i'll pour out my spirit upon all fact
[1:33:01] this is what gets me
[1:33:03] if god is still pouring out of his
[1:33:04] spirit what kind of action should we
[1:33:07] have
[1:33:08] oh hallelujah what happened there these
[1:33:11] people were
[1:33:12] out of themselves there was nothing they
[1:33:14] were doing according to their own will
[1:33:16] they wouldn't have never acted like that
[1:33:18] but they allowed themselves to die and
[1:33:20] rot rotten the holy ghost was
[1:33:22] able to come in them you know that was
[1:33:23] so powerful to me you can't
[1:33:25] make a con covenant with god when god
[1:33:28] wants you to do something
[1:33:29] lord if you save me i'll do this and
[1:33:32] i'll do that he said that's your own
[1:33:33] thought you got to die to all of that
[1:33:35] you got to die to all that you can't you
[1:33:37] can't uh proposition god with anything
[1:33:40] come as you are you got to empty out so
[1:33:43] much so you're nothing
[1:33:44] i don't even deserve to be here but have
[1:33:47] mercy on me lord
[1:33:49] right you can't give god something that
[1:33:50] he gave you
[1:33:54] hallelujah i surrender all that's all
[1:33:56] you can do
[1:33:58] that's the way the church had was born
[1:33:59] first how many believe that god is
[1:34:02] infinite
[1:34:02] then he cannot change whoo that's right
[1:34:07] and if that was his idea of a church
[1:34:09] that at the beginning that's the kind of
[1:34:11] church he's have
[1:34:12] at the end he cannot change so how are
[1:34:15] you going to substitute
[1:34:17] shaking hands or sprinkling or some
[1:34:19] other little thing like that didn't
[1:34:21] happen right there each one of those
[1:34:23] apostles went right back to that
[1:34:26] after they they done all these holy
[1:34:29] ghosts and fear
[1:34:30] fell on them peter said can we forbid
[1:34:34] seeing that these are has received the
[1:34:37] holy ghost like we did at the same
[1:34:38] beginning
[1:34:39] and he commanded them to be baptized in
[1:34:42] the name of jesus christ
[1:34:44] that's right this thing is unexplainable
[1:34:48] now i'm stopping here
[1:34:50] but this thing is unexplainable you
[1:34:52] can't you can't fully explain it
[1:34:54] because god is revelation if you're
[1:34:56] gonna know him you're gonna know him by
[1:34:57] revelation
[1:34:59] hallelujah and that's the way it is
[1:35:00] today if you're going to know god i
[1:35:02] don't care how much word you read
[1:35:04] it's always good to read people yes sir
[1:35:06] it's always good to read
[1:35:08] you should never get tired of reading
[1:35:10] this
[1:35:11] satan will make you he try to get you
[1:35:13] but understand
[1:35:15] you want to read with the anointing you
[1:35:17] want the teacher of the teacher
[1:35:19] you want the writer of the writer to be
[1:35:22] in your company to be in your
[1:35:24] there to unfold like you said even when
[1:35:27] you when you go to scriptures and
[1:35:28] how god can you know once you understand
[1:35:31] the outfit of the maker he can
[1:35:32] begin to open your understanding with
[1:35:35] the message
[1:35:36] because understanding the message is the
[1:35:38] revelation of this
[1:35:39] but you still need to be in the spirit
[1:35:41] john was in the spirit on the lord's day
[1:35:44] you must be in the spirit to understand
[1:35:46] the message you cannot be a carnal mind
[1:35:48] and think you understand the message
[1:35:52] amen it's a spiritual thing spiritually
[1:35:55] given
[1:35:56] right when we as an organization
[1:35:58] denomination we did we compared
[1:36:00] scripture to scripture
[1:36:01] all that was good but people of god is
[1:36:04] more than that
[1:36:06] you've got to have the revelation of the
[1:36:09] word by the holy spirit
[1:36:11] he is the teacher and the bible said he
[1:36:13] will lead you and guide you into all
[1:36:15] truth
[1:36:15] you love the lord let's stand
[1:36:18] just to be in his will we want god's
[1:36:21] perfect will
