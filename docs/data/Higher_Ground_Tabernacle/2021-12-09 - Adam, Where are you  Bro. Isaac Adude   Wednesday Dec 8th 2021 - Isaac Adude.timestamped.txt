[30:56] chapter 7
[30:58] verse 1 to verse 14.
[31:18] jeremiah chapter 7 verse 1 to verse 14.
[31:24] and when the bible says
[31:26] the word that came to jeremiah from the
[31:29] lord saying stand in the gate of the
[31:31] lords of the of the lord's house and
[31:33] proclaim these words

[33:00] house
[33:01] which is called by my name and say we
[33:04] are delivered to all
[33:06] to do all these abominations

[33:14] of robbers in your eyes

[33:24] where

[33:28] and see what i did to to and see what i
[33:31] did to it for the wickedness
[33:34] of my people israel
[33:37] verse 13 and now because you have done
[33:40] all these works saith the lord and i
[33:43] speak unto you
[33:44] rising up early and speaking but you
[33:47] heard not

[33:50] verse 14 therefore will i do unto this
[33:53] house which is called by my name wherein
[33:56] you trust and unto the place which i
[33:59] gave to you
[34:01] and your fathers
[34:03] as i have done to shiloh
[34:07] the next chapter chapter 8 verse 5 to um
[34:11] to 7
[34:13] the bible says that why then is this
[34:15] people of jerusalem slid
[34:18] back by a proportion of backsliding
[34:23] they hold fast to see the refusal return
[34:26] i hearkened and heard
[34:29] but they spake not a right
[34:31] no man repented him of his wickedness
[34:35] saying
[34:36] what have i done
[34:38] everyone turned to this out up i mean to
[34:41] his course
[34:42] as the horse rushes into the bottle yeah
[34:46] the stork in the heaven knoweth her
[34:48] appointed time and the turtle and the
[34:51] crane
[34:52] and the swallow observe the time of
[34:55] their coming but my people know not the
[34:58] judgment of the lord
[35:00] we can jump to verse 19
[35:03] of the same chapter the bible says that
[35:04] behold the voice of the lord i behold
[35:07] behold the voice of the cry of the
[35:09] daughter of my people because
[35:12] because of them that dwell in a foreign
[35:14] country
[35:15] is not the lord in zion
[35:18] is not her king in her
[35:20] why have they why have they provoked me
[35:23] to anger with their craving images
[35:27] and with strange vanities the harvest is
[35:31] passed the summer is ended
[35:34] and we are not saved
[35:36] for the hurt of the daughter of the
[35:38] daughter of my people and my hurt
[35:41] i am black astonishment has
[35:44] taken hold on me
[35:46] is there no bombing gaelic
[35:48] is there no physician there
[35:50] why then is no where then is
[35:54] why then is not the health of my
[35:56] daughter of my people recovered
[36:00] amen we may be seated
[36:02] i mean i
[36:03] actually had another
[36:05] message that i wanted to bring
[36:07] this uh tonight but when i came to the
[36:09] office i was reading my bible and then
[36:12] the lord led me to bring this message
[36:14] so i kind of had like two hours to get
[36:16] ready for it so by the grace of god i
[36:19] pray that god will help me you know
[36:21] deliver everything you give me
[36:23] amen i will entitle it where are you
[36:26] adam or adam where are you
[36:28] amen because if we read in genesis
[36:30] chapter 3 verse 9 to 13 the bible says
[36:32] that and the lord called ed and adam
[36:35] and said unto him where are thou
[36:38] and he said i heard divorce in the
[36:40] garden and i was afraid because i was
[36:43] naked and i hid myself
[36:45] and he said
[36:46] who told thee that thou was naked
[36:49] has thou eaten of the tree where elf i
[36:53] thee that thou should
[36:55] not eat
[36:56] and the men say the woman whom they'll
[36:59] give us to be with me
[37:01] she gave me of the tree and i did eat
[37:04] and the lord said and the lord god said
[37:06] unto the woman
[37:08] what is this
[37:10] that thou has done and the woman said
[37:12] the serpent begotted me and i did eat it
[37:15] amen if we
[37:17] look uh in this chapter of genesis
[37:20] amen in other words it was a judgment
[37:23] you know god was judging adam and eve
[37:25] you know the word before god got judging
[37:27] them but if you read closely you'll
[37:30] under you'll see that adam and eve
[37:32] instead of repenting
[37:34] it meant they didn't repent but they
[37:35] were accusing one another i mean you see
[37:37] that adam was accusing the white uh i
[37:39] mean his wife and the wife and eve was
[37:42] accusing the devil i mean was accusing
[37:44] the serpent
[37:45] amen they were accusing one another none
[37:47] of them was able to uh uh accept what he
[37:51] did none of them was able to say that
[37:53] lord you know you're right we did this
[37:55] this was wrong and now we repent lord we
[37:57] pray that you forgive us amen none of
[37:59] them say that but one
[38:00] all of them wanted to show to god how
[38:02] good they were amen they weren't to say
[38:04] but lord i didn't respect your word but
[38:06] because you gave me this woman amen
[38:09] she's the one who led me to do this and
[38:11] the woman said lord lord i was good i
[38:13] mean if you didn't create the serpent i
[38:15] wouldn't do it amen none of them you
[38:17] know accepted you know whatever they did
[38:19] wrong but because they were under the
[38:21] grace of god and when god was able to
[38:23] give them grace
[38:25] i mean not to kill them because before
[38:27] that god told them that the day that you
[38:29] will eat from this tree that same day
[38:31] that that'll be the day that you guys
[38:32] will die but because they were under the
[38:36] grace because that covenant was under
[38:38] the grace amen god didn't kill them but
[38:40] god provided a way
[38:42] meant for them to leave but then after
[38:44] that you know in exodus chapter 19 then
[38:47] you will find out that that that is
[38:49] where the children of israel rejected
[38:51] grace amen this chose low over grace so
[38:54] now therefore everything bad that we're
[38:57] doing god had to judge them judge them
[38:59] according to
[39:01] everything that they were doing amen
[39:03] amen that's why you see that here
[39:04] jeremiah he's called he's talking to
[39:07] god gave that word to the to jeremiah to
[39:10] go tell the children of israel that you
[39:12] you have done something bad and you have
[39:14] heard the lord but none of you is coming
[39:17] to repent so therefore these are the
[39:20] cursing or these are the you know these
[39:22] are all the curses that will come to you
[39:24] if you don't repent amen you will see
[39:26] that god there is i think i think in
[39:27] jeremiah chapter 4
[39:29] and when god told them to come back you
[39:31] know to come back to them but they
[39:33] didn't repent but instead they went they
[39:35] make stones or they make gods out of
[39:37] stones and out of trees and they started
[39:40] to worship those gods and all those
[39:42] scenes you know were you know increasing
[39:44] in god's eyes and god couldn't you know
[39:46] god couldn't accept it anymore and then
[39:48] he gave that word to jeremiah to go warn
[39:50] the people of jerusalem to go warn the
[39:53] people of israel that you know this is
[39:55] the sin that you guys have done so now
[39:57] it's time to repent you have to repent
[39:59] but though that were though all of them
[40:02] were warned but none of them you know
[40:04] received those words and then none of
[40:06] them
[40:07] you know came back to the lord and then
[40:10] uh uh uh repented uh because if you read
[40:13] and i think in jeremiah chapter five you
[40:15] know god told jeremiah that if i even
[40:18] found if i found even one
[40:20] one servant or one person who uh who
[40:24] respects the word of god who follows the
[40:26] word of god i will spare the entire city
[40:28] amen but he couldn't find any because
[40:31] all of them they were you know all doing
[40:34] the same things that's why god you know
[40:36] gave this word and then god told them
[40:38] that you know since you guys don't since
[40:40] uh my people don't respect everything
[40:43] that i say to them amen i would do to
[40:45] them the same thing that i did to shiloh
[40:47] amen so now we have to find about what
[40:50] what did god do to shiloh will you find
[40:52] it in first samuel chapter 4 verse 7 to
[40:54] 10. when the bible says that and the
[40:56] philistines were afraid
[40:58] for the saint the goddess come into the
[41:01] camp
[41:02] and they said
[41:04] woe unto us for there has not been such
[41:07] a thing here here here too for
[41:11] will unto us who shall deliver us out of
[41:14] the hand of this mighty god
[41:16] uh these are these are the gods thus
[41:19] smoth the egyptians
[41:21] with all the plagues in the wilderness
[41:24] be strong and quit yourselves like man
[41:26] oh ye philistines
[41:28] that ye be not servants unto the hebrews
[41:32] as they have been to you quit yourself
[41:35] like request yourselves like man and
[41:38] fight
[41:38] and the philistine fought and israel was
[41:41] meeting and deflate every man into his
[41:44] den and there was a very great slaughter
[41:48] for
[41:49] their for their fail
[41:52] uh for the fellow of israel 30 000 foot
[41:55] men
[41:56] i mean if you read in this chapter in
[41:57] the beginning you'll see that
[41:59] you know israel were in the but there
[42:01] wasn't a battle they bottled between
[42:04] israel and the philistines
[42:06] but the thing that happened that the
[42:08] israel
[42:10] were sinning i mean they had those
[42:12] scenes that they didn't confess amen
[42:14] they were doing things that god was not
[42:16] pleased with but when the battle came
[42:19] they thought that well ever since you
[42:21] know where every time we bring the ark
[42:23] every time we fight god god always gives
[42:25] us victory so this will be the same
[42:27] routine so this will be the same god it
[42:29] will still give us our victory amen
[42:32] you'll see that the first before the
[42:33] before getting this arc amen they're
[42:36] starting fighting and then they started
[42:37] there was they were losing the fight so
[42:39] they went back to the city to take the
[42:42] the ark saying believing that god will
[42:44] still be with him but but they forget
[42:46] that their lives were not worthy you
[42:48] know of the
[42:49] their lives were not worthy of having
[42:51] the ark you know with them you know even
[42:54] though the presence of the lord was
[42:55] there but their lives didn't reflect
[42:58] amen the presence of the lord so when
[42:59] the lord came i mean when the ark came
[43:01] all the philistines were trembling all
[43:03] the fields and you know they were afraid
[43:05] because they know what god is able to do
[43:08] amen the philistine didn't deny what god
[43:11] has done to them before amen the first
[43:13] time even told them you know
[43:15] what god has done you know with them you
[43:17] know when what god has done to these the
[43:19] egyptians you know telling them that
[43:22] you know all the plagues and all the
[43:24] curses he sent to uh to pharaoh and his
[43:26] people but though those people you know
[43:29] they had they had the ark they had god
[43:31] between them but their lives were not
[43:33] worthy you know or in other words they
[43:35] had god was there but they didn't
[43:37] welcome god amongst them so god couldn't
[43:40] give them the victory they were looking
[43:42] for amen because god was not there
[43:45] because the people refused to to repent
[43:48] from their sins and they got used to god
[43:50] amen it was like it was like a habit
[43:52] amen every time we go to pray to fight
[43:55] and man we have the ark and we always
[43:57] have victory so this will be the same
[43:59] thing they did it yesterday they thought
[44:00] that you know it'll be the same thing
[44:02] but i forgot one thing that those things
[44:04] had uh uh i had a condition i mean their
[44:07] lives had to be their lives had to be
[44:09] ready first i mean their lives had to be
[44:11] prepared even to have that bottle to go
[44:14] to that bottle amen that's why you'll
[44:16] see that joshua and the others they were
[44:18] telling them that before you fight you
[44:20] have to get you have to be aware you
[44:21] know far from your wife you don't have
[44:23] to you know there are there were certain
[44:25] things that they couldn't do because you
[44:27] know before fighting amen because they
[44:30] had to keep themselves sacred in other
[44:32] words
[44:33] amen and then we see that that's the
[44:35] same thing sometimes with us i mean in
[44:37] the church amen people will come to
[44:39] church and man they think that god is in
[44:41] the church god god is always there when
[44:43] we invite him but by they come you know
[44:45] because god acted yesterday they think
[44:47] that the same god will act today amen of
[44:50] course god will act but first of all we
[44:52] have to look at ourselves first amen we
[44:54] have to look at the condition of our
[44:56] heart first if that god even he's worthy
[44:59] to come and dwell inside of us amen we
[45:01] have first to repent and then clear our
[45:03] life clean our lives you know and then
[45:06] god you know let god wash us amen
[45:08] because you will see that
[45:10] uh the first time god had the passover
[45:12] the children of israel had a passover
[45:14] amen god required moses to tell the
[45:17] children of israel to keep the living
[45:18] out of their homes amen he told he told
[45:21] them to keep those 11 i mean 11 7 i
[45:23] think seven days you know the seven days
[45:26] the 11 had to be uh uh um
[45:29] they couldn't
[45:30] they were not supposed to have the
[45:31] leaven inside of their home amen the
[45:34] living represents sin
[45:36] amen it was something sacred that god
[45:38] was going to do even god was going to
[45:40] save their lives and man in order for
[45:42] god to save their lives it meant their
[45:44] home had to be sacred first amen they
[45:47] had to get rid of all those sins that
[45:49] they was doing that they were doing they
[45:50] had to get rid of you know all the
[45:53] things that was going to stop god from
[45:56] doing whatever he was doing amen that's
[45:58] why you see that in matthew chapter 21
[46:00] verse 12 to 14 and when jesus was going
[46:03] to the temple and then he saw people
[46:05] selling stuff and you know the church
[46:07] wasn't it was not in order amen the
[46:09] church became a marketplace i mean you
[46:11] saw people changing money all those
[46:13] stuff the first thing before healing the
[46:15] people he started first to you know to
[46:18] uh um
[46:19] i mean to to kick those people out of
[46:21] the the place amen he started to put
[46:23] things in order first and then you will
[46:25] see that in verse 14 after doing all of
[46:28] that amen the bible said that and the
[46:30] blind and the lame came to him in the
[46:32] temple and
[46:33] and then he healed them amen before
[46:35] healing them he head first to put
[46:37] everything in order and when the bible
[46:39] says that and jesus went into the temple
[46:41] of god and cast out all them
[46:43] because they are all them that sold and
[46:45] bought in the temple and overthrew the
[46:48] tables of the money changers and and the
[46:50] seats of them that sold the sold
[46:53] and said unto them it is written my
[46:55] house shall be called the house of
[46:57] prayer but ye have made it
[47:00] again of a den of thieves
[47:02] and then and then verse 14 and the blind
[47:05] and the lame came to him in the temple
[47:08] and healed them amen jesus knew that he
[47:11] had to heal those people
[47:12] jesus knew they had to give side to
[47:14] those blind man but he couldn't do it
[47:17] you know it went those place when that
[47:19] place was not in order amen he couldn't
[47:22] do it because that place didn't receive
[47:24] god in other words that god wasn't among
[47:26] them amen that's why he had first to fix
[47:28] those things before god being there amen
[47:31] you will see the same thing you know
[47:32] with joshua and
[47:34] and
[47:35] joshua and i think i forgot the other
[47:38] uh soldier name who uh
[47:41] took uh i think a quote from um
[47:44] uh uh who took a quote that didn't
[47:45] belong to him i think i can't i can do
[47:47] something there amen amen they had the
[47:50] sin the sin was among them and then you
[47:52] know even though god gave the vision to
[47:55] joshua that none of them would lose
[47:56] their lives but since somebody in
[47:59] between them i mean his life was not in
[48:01] order to go fight amen they started
[48:04] losing their lives because you know
[48:06] something was wrong that's why you see
[48:07] that joshua when he saw that something
[48:10] was wrong he had to stop people from
[48:11] fighting amen and then fix first of all
[48:14] the scene that was between them amen and
[48:16] when the soul and when they killed the
[48:18] uh i think they can and it can when they
[48:21] kill aiken and then you know everything
[48:23] will solve amen you see the same thing
[48:25] came with jesus amen one is so uh
[48:29] when you went to that house where the
[48:31] young lady amen the young girl was was
[48:35] that younger died amen people the crowd
[48:38] was inside there when jesus said to them
[48:40] that this young girl is not dying i mean
[48:42] she didn't die she's asleep even people
[48:45] started laughing at jesus amen in other
[48:48] words that people was were not believing
[48:50] that jesus was able to raise that girl
[48:52] from i mean from the girls that raised
[48:55] raise raise her up amen by what jesus
[48:57] had to do jesus had to kick them out
[49:00] first and then jesus had to tell them to
[49:02] go out first to leave the room so that
[49:04] god will operate amen jesus amen had to
[49:08] tell them first of all amen
[49:10] but everybody in that house had to be in
[49:14] one accord amen everybody in that house
[49:16] had to believe in one thing everybody in
[49:18] that house even had to have one one
[49:21] purpose amen they all have to have one
[49:23] goal that you know of that girl being
[49:26] being uh
[49:28] resurrected amen that's why you see that
[49:30] the prophet said that when the church of
[49:32] god amen will come all united will come
[49:34] and then we'll be all united consecrated
[49:37] in christ amen every sin person that
[49:40] will enter into god's church amen that
[49:42] sin will be called out amen every wrong
[49:45] spirit that will be inside of the church
[49:46] that spirit will be called that why
[49:48] because the people will be all together
[49:50] amen having one purpose amen having one
[49:54] goal without god will be to serve god
[49:56] amen and that's why you see that every
[49:58] time that that jesus and all that every
[50:01] time that god wanted to do something
[50:02] good and then the sin was in the camp
[50:05] and he head first to clean that out
[50:07] first
[50:08] and then the prophet says that
[50:10] that uh it's proved that god is visiting
[50:13] the people today
[50:15] god is in his church trying to purge the
[50:18] thing take help the living out of it
[50:20] he's sending me he's sending messenger
[50:23] uh
[50:25] he's sending
[50:26] messengers uh messengers he's sending
[50:29] messengers he's sending signs and
[50:32] wonders and miracles and everything
[50:34] trying to prove that he loves them and
[50:37] he wants them to clean up get rid of get
[50:40] rid of uh get get rid of this here all
[50:44] this carrying on staying home on
[50:46] wednesday night from prayer meeting to
[50:48] look at this old silly stuff of all of
[50:51] an old woman
[50:53] from hollywood married four or five
[50:55] times and some guy that's uh
[50:59] and some guy that is run
[51:03] some guy that runs with half the woman
[51:06] on the worst on the west coast and who
[51:08] loves lucy's and and and all the things
[51:11] like that and you christian people stay
[51:14] home to see that to see that and stay
[51:17] away from the house of god it shows what
[51:20] kind of a spirit is in you amen the
[51:23] prophet says that here god is god god is
[51:25] trying to take that that spirit out amen
[51:28] god is trying to purge those those
[51:30] things you know out of the church amen
[51:33] because we have one purpose amen the
[51:35] purpose is to make the uh uh to be
[51:37] raptured and before being raptured amen
[51:41] god god will have first to clean up amen
[51:44] all the mess even god will have first to
[51:46] fix everything because that is the same
[51:48] thing that god told moses
[51:50] amen before the the the first exodus he
[51:53] told them he told moses to tell the
[51:55] children of israel to clean the house
[51:57] amen he tell the children of israel amen
[51:59] how to behave amen during those
[52:01] certainly those specific times amen he
[52:04] told the children of israel what to do
[52:05] he told them to apply the blood amen but
[52:08] before applying the blood they have
[52:09] first to take all the leaven out of
[52:11] their homes
[52:12] amen and also we are getting ready for
[52:15] our third exodus amen we are getting
[52:17] ready to be raptured and then the
[52:19] prophet says that before that happens
[52:21] amen three things has to happen first
[52:23] amen god has to send a prophet amen with
[52:26] a message and then god has to vindicate
[52:28] that message you know with the pillar of
[52:30] fire and then god has to give a token
[52:33] amen and then by before doing the amend
[52:36] our house has to be cleaned first amen
[52:38] the prophet here says that notice that
[52:40] the preparation of for his promised land
[52:44] uh for his promised land people know
[52:46] this he did first
[52:48] first he had had he had the people
[52:51] that that he made that he made a land
[52:53] for a land for them he had prepared a
[52:56] land for them and now he sent down there
[53:00] he sent down their preparation for it
[53:02] for the promised land people it was only
[53:05] for those who were predestinated to that
[53:09] promised land bright day
[53:12] and how he done it he sent a prophet
[53:14] with a message
[53:16] identified with the by a pillar of fire
[53:19] and gave a token
[53:21] that they could rest assured that it was
[53:23] right that's right it was her
[53:25] consolation amen and then we see that in
[53:28] our last days amen god did the same
[53:30] thing amen god sent us a prophet amen
[53:33] that prophet was vindicated amen and
[53:35] then god gave us the token which is the
[53:37] holy spirit amen but to receive those
[53:40] who by to receive that sign or to have
[53:42] the holy spirit amen inside of amen we
[53:44] have first to go you know through you
[53:46] know those cleaning period or the the
[53:49] cleaning you know steps with god you
[53:52] know god has to purge us first amen god
[53:54] has to amen take all those livings you
[53:57] know the living out of our out of our
[53:58] homes amen god has to clean us first we
[54:01] have to be worthy amen to be called
[54:04] christian amen we have to be worthy amen
[54:06] to be called a man christian because we
[54:08] see that the first time that that word
[54:11] was pronounced it meant
[54:12] it wasn't called you know but those
[54:15] people were not just regular people amen
[54:18] those people were not just people who
[54:20] were going and drink and smoke and and
[54:22] laugh and do all those stuff amen but
[54:24] those people it meant something in them
[54:26] was was particular even something in
[54:29] them you know made other people to see
[54:31] that these are christ-like amen these
[54:34] these people are behaving like christ
[54:36] amen these people are talking like
[54:38] christ these people are walking like
[54:40] christ amen that's why they were called
[54:42] christians amen that's why amen that's
[54:44] the that's what god you know want us to
[54:47] be that's where you know he want us to
[54:49] be amen to be those people amen who who
[54:53] are the light of the world amen who are
[54:55] the salt
[54:56] who will give to this world the the
[54:58] server
[55:01] amen who will give to this world the
[55:03] taste
[55:04] amen that this word is lost amen that's
[55:06] why you see that god was calling adam
[55:09] saying adam where are you where are you
[55:12] amen where are you i have planes i have
[55:14] plans that i have made for you amen
[55:16] where are you and then in this last time
[55:18] amen after all those sinning has
[55:20] happened after everything that we have
[55:22] done even god is still calling for us
[55:24] amen because we are the sons and
[55:26] daughters of god amen we are those adams
[55:28] amen in this life in this light a hand
[55:31] time and god is calling for us where are
[55:33] where are we amen but now this time that
[55:36] when god is calling for us it's not a
[55:37] time to go before god and start giving
[55:40] you know accusing another or to say the
[55:42] lord because i wasn't in a good church
[55:44] that's why i'm behaving like this oh
[55:45] lord because my my parents didn't
[55:48] believe in the message that's the reason
[55:49] why i'm here amen but god is giving us
[55:52] every one of us an opportunity amen to
[55:54] go before him and to repent even god has
[55:57] given us many opportunity to go before
[56:00] him when he's calling us adam where are
[56:02] where are you
[56:03] amen you have to come to him and say
[56:05] lord hear my lord i'm naked lord this is
[56:08] i did the exact same the thing that you
[56:09] didn't you told me not to do that's why
[56:12] i'm naked i mean it's not a time to go
[56:14] you know starting accusing you know
[56:16] people to say that lord if you give me a
[56:19] good wife maybe i will i could have you
[56:21] know kept the word or i'll be a good
[56:23] husband but lord but but you know it's
[56:25] now a personal time that you have to
[56:27] respond to god amen you'll be judged
[56:30] you know with the thing that you i did
[56:32] you know yourself
[56:34] i mean god is calling adam where are you
[56:36] amen somebody has to respond
[56:39] amen somebody has to tell him you know
[56:41] lord here i am i did this and you know
[56:44] this was wrong and i did it and lord i'm
[56:46] asking for your forgiveness
[56:48] and when the prophet says that the
[56:49] people is just
[56:51] afraid of this new birth that's all
[56:54] they're afraid to come to it
[56:57] because it'll straighten them up
[56:59] it'll make you quit playing bingo quit
[57:02] playing these slot machines
[57:05] it'll make you quit staying home on
[57:06] wednesday night from prayer meeting to

[57:28] it'll make you it'll make a man quit
[57:31] smoking cigarettes
[57:32] then being in in church as deacons
[57:36] then being in church as deacons it'll
[57:38] make the people quit lying stealing
[57:41] it'll do something for you it'll clean
[57:44] you up and give you a salvation that
[57:47] there is nothing in the world can expand
[57:50] it away from can expand can expanding
[57:53] the word from you
[57:55] because you
[57:56] because you know
[57:58] you were there when it happened yes sir
[58:01] you said that that's why the holy spirit
[58:02] when it comes to us that's what it will
[58:04] do but the sad thing is that people
[58:07] don't want it
[58:09] amen it's like it's like you know in uh
[58:11] uh thinking uh said second kings chapter

[58:18] that he knew he knew for he knew the
[58:20] king the king of israel he knew for sure
[58:22] that god was there
[58:23] but when he fell down he went to luke we
[58:26] went to bills about amen to get his
[58:28] healing amen and then god sent elijah
[58:31] telling him that why did you what did
[58:33] you have to go there amen did you not
[58:35] know that god is present amen did you
[58:38] not know that god is able to heal did

[58:45] down of your bed and then you will die
[58:48] amen god god has provided a way for us
[58:50] god has provided a way
[58:52] amen for our salvation but you'll see
[58:54] that people are trying to take a
[58:56] shortcut or people are trying to go to
[58:59] other gods or to doing something that
[59:01] god didn't prepare oh god he knew taking
[59:04] other route that god didn't provide him
[59:06] amen but god is calling us to go back to
[59:08] come back to him amen because he has
[59:11] good plans he has good things amen here
[59:13] you see that jeremiah is asking why amen
[59:16] why my i the daughter of you know why

[1:00:31] create you know and a lie and then come

[1:00:36] thing that the prophet says the amen
[1:00:37] when you being delivered from something
[1:00:39] and then you don't replace that thing
[1:00:41] with god amen that same spirit will go
[1:00:44] out and call seven out of the strong
[1:00:45] spirit amen come and dwell with you know
[1:00:48] in you amen but why you know why why we
[1:00:51] don't see those things anymore why you

[1:00:55] that god did in the book of acts why we
[1:00:57] don't see it anymore between us
[1:00:58] christians amen especially us who are
[1:01:01] called
[1:01:02] you know who we say that we have in the
[1:01:03] we we in the message amen we have
[1:01:05] believed you know the message of the
[1:01:07] hour we have all the gifts and
[1:01:08] everything but why don't we see all
[1:01:10] those things amen is god dead amen or
[1:01:14] but we know for sure that god is not
[1:01:16] dead but that has to mean that you know
[1:01:18] something is wrong with us amen before
[1:01:20] seeing those things amen we have first
[1:01:22] you know to fix ourselves first before
[1:01:25] it got started acting amen but you know
[1:01:27] that's what jeremiah was asking why
[1:01:30] amen he has told the children of israel
[1:01:32] that god was alive even the children of
[1:01:35] israel has seen you know god manifesting
[1:01:37] amen they were in egypt it meant god you
[1:01:40] know with pharaoh for 400 years amen god
[1:01:43] showed them the way god showed them that
[1:01:45] he was still there amen they were there
[1:01:47] in uh uh
[1:01:49] in the wilderness amen god showed them
[1:01:51] that he was still alive but when they
[1:01:54] get out when they got out of the
[1:01:55] wilderness amen they went back to their
[1:01:57] old behaviors amen they crossed they
[1:01:59] crossed the red sea amen all those
[1:02:02] children crossed the red sea and after
[1:02:03] joshua amen they thought that everything
[1:02:06] was going to be fine but down the line
[1:02:08] even they started repeating the same
[1:02:09] mistakes that their father was the
[1:02:11] fathers were doing amen they knew
[1:02:13] exactly what god has done to their
[1:02:15] fathers but the children came back and
[1:02:17] they started doing the same thing and
[1:02:19] now here uh jeremiah is he's asking
[1:02:21] himself about why
[1:02:23] he meant jeremiah you know found himself
[1:02:25] you know he said about lord i preached
[1:02:27] exactly what you told me to tell these
[1:02:29] people lord i say every word i repeated
[1:02:31] every word that you tell me to tell
[1:02:33] these people about why is there about
[1:02:37] about what about why you know about why
[1:02:39] there is not but by why the health of
[1:02:41] the daughters of my city my people is
[1:02:43] not you know he's not recovered why you
[1:02:46] know jeremiah you know was asking
[1:02:48] himself why because he looked at his
[1:02:50] life amen he looked at his life and he
[1:02:53] looked at everything that he talked to
[1:02:54] those people said lord myself i don't
[1:02:56] blame myself for not saying them
[1:02:58] anything lord i told them everything
[1:03:00] that you told me to do you know i tell
[1:03:02] them everything that you told me to say
[1:03:04] but why is there no bomb and kill it
[1:03:07] is there no physician there
[1:03:10] is there no god who can start healing
[1:03:12] the people is there no holy spirit who
[1:03:14] can fill up who can fill the church amen
[1:03:17] but why why my people is not being
[1:03:20] healed
[1:03:21] amen we have to answer to those
[1:03:22] questions amen everybody every one of us
[1:03:25] a man has an answer amen for why why
[1:03:28] those things it's not happening you know
[1:03:30] somewhere you let one spirit you know i
[1:03:32] don't know and i don't need to know what
[1:03:34] spirit but yourself you know amen if you
[1:03:36] go back to your life and you start
[1:03:38] starting your life amen you study your
[1:03:40] life you know how you first started you
[1:03:42] know when you first got the holy spirit
[1:03:44] and where and where you are now amen you
[1:03:46] will see that amen but for most people
[1:03:49] you know you'll see that when you first
[1:03:50] got the holy spirit amen you were all on
[1:03:53] fire amen amen you you know you were
[1:03:55] going to church every day and praying
[1:03:57] and reading the bible and studying the
[1:03:59] word amen you were burning the holy
[1:04:01] spirit was bending inside of you but
[1:04:03] after four years after receiving the
[1:04:05] holy spirit of four years instead of
[1:04:07] that fire increasing but now you think
[1:04:09] that that fire is decreasing amen the
[1:04:11] fire is being oh he's being
[1:04:14] amen that fire amen there is no room or
[1:04:17] there is no oxygen for that fire he
[1:04:19] meant to uh uh uh to burn as as he was
[1:04:22] supposed to burn that means that
[1:04:24] something is wrong amen that means that
[1:04:26] you know there is something wrong
[1:04:28] something is is to something is wrong
[1:04:30] that is keeping that fire from burning
[1:04:32] out
[1:04:33] amen we have to find an answer for it
[1:04:36] amen and then after finding the answer
[1:04:38] we have to go to god and say lord
[1:04:40] forgive us lord and we come to you lord
[1:04:42] and repent and then after that you will
[1:04:44] see god acting again
[1:04:46] amen and the prophet said that now i
[1:04:48] believe that we're living in in the days
[1:04:51] where
[1:04:52] otherwise in the uh we're living the
[1:04:55] days that uh
[1:04:56] the prophecy that the days that we're
[1:04:58] living in should cause the church to go
[1:05:00] completely into desperation
[1:05:03] i believe since the message this morning
[1:05:05] from god amen that message was a token
[1:05:09] i mean he said that since the message
[1:05:11] this morning from god not me
[1:05:14] i believe he ought to throw the entire
[1:05:16] congregation into desperation
[1:05:19] that we have played long enough we went
[1:05:22] we we've went to church long enough
[1:05:25] we've got to do something
[1:05:27] how is it that we can't see other great
[1:05:30] signs and wonders
[1:05:32] done on others
[1:05:34] and what about us what about us
[1:05:37] it should cause any state of desperation
[1:05:40] that we are determined that we are
[1:05:42] determined before god the signs of his
[1:05:45] coming should bring this entire
[1:05:47] congregation
[1:05:48] when we've read it
[1:05:51] when we've read it from the word the
[1:05:52] holy spirit has told us
[1:05:55] go at a certain place
[1:05:57] such and such such and such things will
[1:05:59] happen
[1:06:00] not tell us what it was but he will
[1:06:03] happen
[1:06:04] we go there it happens that way the
[1:06:07] newspapers pocket the magazines package
[1:06:11] show the picture of it come back here
[1:06:14] and see those great mysteries hidden in
[1:06:16] the bible opened us to us
[1:06:18] on the new fear that we never know
[1:06:21] before
[1:06:22] and perfectly blames in the coming of
[1:06:24] the lord jesus
[1:06:26] amen
[1:06:27] you know we have to we have to be in
[1:06:29] that state of desperation
[1:06:31] amen the church has to be in that state
[1:06:33] of desperation where
[1:06:35] you know you will say to god lord i
[1:06:37] rather you know if if you don't give me
[1:06:40] the holy spirit just kill me take me you
[1:06:42] know take my life away if you don't want
[1:06:44] to fill me with the holy spirit amen we
[1:06:46] have to be in that place it means like
[1:06:48] jacob amen he's so deaf coming to him
[1:06:51] and says the lord i will not leave you
[1:06:52] until you change my name amen this has
[1:06:55] to be the prayer of every one of us amen

[1:13:26] we're not you know those problems that
[1:13:28] were not supposed to be in the church
[1:13:30] amen why in a church there is sealed
[1:13:32] divisions and people you know these
[1:13:34] people not this brother not talking to
[1:13:36] this brother or this sister not talking
[1:13:37] to this history amen we were called to
[1:13:40] to a higher purpose amen we are called
[1:13:42] to a higher purpose we all call amen to

[1:14:10] common ground which is love amen that's
[1:14:12] what that's where we need to be amen
[1:14:15] that's where we need to be amen we asked
[1:14:16] ourselves why
[1:14:18] amen why my prayers are not being
[1:14:20] answered anymore amen why i don't feel
[1:14:22] god as i used to feeling amen why i feel

[1:14:33] we're just too afraid to go and do a dig
[1:14:36] a big study of our lives i mean
[1:14:38] sometimes we're just too scared to go
[1:14:40] and then and then think about you know
[1:14:42] what the things that we have done and
[1:14:43] think about you know why we have caused
[1:14:45] that spirit that holy spirit to be quiet
[1:14:48] amen you see that in the message i think
[1:14:49] the day of the prophet says that
[1:14:52] the prophet said that wherever the holy
[1:14:54] spirit left you amen that's the same
[1:14:56] place he will find you amen you just
[1:14:58] have to go back to that same place in
[1:15:00] other words that you have to repent you
[1:15:02] know that thing that you did that caused
[1:15:04] the holy spirit to go out or to fly away
[1:15:07] man you have to repent so that the holy
[1:15:09] spirit comes back amen wherever that
[1:15:11] holy spirit left you man that's the same
[1:15:13] place that we you have to go but you
[1:15:14] have to know where did the holy spirit
[1:15:16] left amen and then the only place to
[1:15:19] find any men is to go to god to to cross
[1:15:21] himself amen the only place to find a

[1:16:38] me so
[1:16:41] he looked

[1:17:11] praise grace
[1:17:15] [Music]
[1:17:24] i
[1:17:25] do
[1:17:26] not know
[1:17:28] [Music]
[1:17:30] just why
[1:17:32] he came to love me
[1:17:39] [Music]
[1:17:54] foreign
[1:17:56] [Music]
[1:18:06] to
[1:18:07] view
[1:18:08] the cross
[1:18:12] where
[1:18:13] jesus died for me
[1:18:19] [Music]
[1:18:34] he
[1:18:35] looked
[1:18:36] beyond
[1:18:38] [Music]
[1:18:46] amen
[1:18:48] god gave us this grace
[1:18:51] he meant that he wanted to sacrifice his
[1:18:53] only begotten son
[1:18:57] he meant to give us the life
[1:18:59] that none of us was worthy of
[1:19:03] amen he bled and died he suffered all
[1:19:05] the pains that we were supposed to
[1:19:07] suffer
[1:19:09] and when he took our lives he took our
[1:19:11] place
[1:19:13] it meant we were supposed to be the
[1:19:14] people were supposed to be on that cross
[1:19:17] crying for life
[1:19:19] crying for help crying for water
[1:19:21] he meant crying for somebody to take all
[1:19:24] those nails
[1:19:25] away from us
[1:19:27] but he took our place
[1:19:30] he went and died for us
[1:19:32] [Music]
[1:19:33] and then in return
[1:19:35] he's only asking us for one thing
[1:19:37] to accept him
[1:19:39] amen is not asking us for something that
[1:19:41] is harder or something you know that he
[1:19:44] knows that we can't do it but he's only
[1:19:46] asking us for one thing to accept him
[1:19:48] amen is only asking us to believe the
[1:19:51] work that he did for us
[1:19:54] amen that he's only asking us to accept
[1:19:56] the blood
[1:19:57] that is shared on calvary for us
[1:20:00] amen and we if we accept him he
[1:20:09] that calvary the sacrifice that was made
[1:20:11] on calvary it meant something inside of
[1:20:14] us will change
[1:20:15] amen because the prophet says that he
[1:20:17] has never seen somebody going to calvary
[1:20:19] and come back as
[1:20:21] he went
[1:20:22] something has to happen inside of you
[1:20:24] amen and that thing that has to happen
[1:20:26] depends on you it depends on your
[1:20:27] attitude amen you will either be cursed
[1:20:30] or you will be blessed amen there is
[1:20:32] only two things
[1:20:34] everything just depends on your attitude
[1:20:36] everything depends
[1:20:37] on the gift
[1:20:39] if you accept it or you don't accept it
[1:20:41] and the prophet says that the grace is
[1:20:43] grace when it's accepted as grace but
[1:20:46] that same grace becomes a judgment
[1:20:48] amen if it's not accepted as
[1:20:50] grace it's been if it's been rejected
[1:20:53] and when he came for his brothers
[1:20:55] they rejected him and
[1:20:57] and then he became a judgment for them
[1:21:00] amen and then he came for us gentiles
[1:21:03] and if we reject him it would become a
[1:21:05] judgment for us
[1:21:06] but now here he is he's asking us adam
[1:21:09] where are we
[1:21:11] amen it's a time where we can go to him
[1:21:13] and ask him the lord
[1:21:15] here we are lord
[1:21:17] lord i know i'm not worthy to be called
[1:21:19] your
[1:21:20] son but i know i'm not worthy to be
[1:21:21] called a christian because my life is
[1:21:23] not even worthy
[1:21:25] but i'm not even worthy to call your
[1:21:26] name because i'm i'm filled with you
[1:21:29] know bad things and bad spirit and
[1:21:31] things that you know that myself i'm
[1:21:33] ashamed of
[1:21:35] but lord but here i am because you're
[1:21:36] calling me
[1:21:38] and then you tell just be honest with
[1:21:40] you amen that's the only thing that he
[1:21:42] requires is honest
[1:21:44] amen to tell him that lord by myself i
[1:21:46] can't make it oh god but i need you lord
[1:21:49] i need your help i need you to hold my
[1:21:51] hand and to help me stand
