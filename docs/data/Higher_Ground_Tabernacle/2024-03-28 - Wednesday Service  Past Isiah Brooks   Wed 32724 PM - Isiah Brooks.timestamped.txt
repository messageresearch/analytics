[16:13] Lazarus Hallelujah he said I believe in
[16:15] the
[16:16] resurrection I believe in the bodily
[16:19] physical
[16:20] Resurrection I believe in the physical
[16:22] body return of Jesus
[16:27] Christ I believe that the his church is
[16:29] his representative on the earth
[16:33] now
[16:35] understand his church is a
[16:39] representative not representing
[16:42] yourself representing
[16:44] him why you can't just do what you want
[16:46] to
[16:48] do but the the the God of this evil
[16:52] age he makes us forget who we here
[16:57] representing
[17:00] but we're not children of
[17:03] Wrath has given us grace and
[17:06] mercy hallelujah hallelujah we're not
[17:09] vessels of
[17:10] Dishonor God has us vessels
[17:14] of Hallelujah Hallelujah he said listen
[17:17] I believe that his church is his
[17:20] representative on the earth
[17:23] now I believe that that church is washed
[17:26] BL of Jesus Christ
[17:29] and the church is a holy ghost filled
[17:33] Church PR
[17:37] Holiness to the very
[17:41] extremes he preaches it to the
[17:44] extreme say when you think that I'm just
[17:47] too
[17:51] hard the ghost fi
[17:56] Church extreme
[18:00] don't you think
[18:03] so hallu amen amen you love the Lord
[18:10] hallelujah hallelujah listen what he
[18:12] says he said God always sends his
[18:19] warnings that's
[18:22] Resurrection s his
[18:26] warnings hallelujah hallelujah just
[18:28] before the coming of
[18:30] Jesus he sent an angel down Out Of
[18:34] Heaven by the name of
[18:36] Gabriel so I want you to understand it's
[18:39] not just having the Holy
[18:41] Ghost but we have Guardian
[18:45] Angels that's why we still alive
[18:48] today God dispatched an angel to you you
[18:53] are born in this physical
[18:56] world hallelujah hallelujah and that
[18:58] Angel has always protected
[19:02] you even when you didn't see him
[19:05] protecting he's been
[19:07] there hallelujah hallelujah just before
[19:10] the coming of Jesus he sent an angel
[19:13] down Out Of
[19:14] Heaven by the name of
[19:17] Gabriel now minor Angels
[19:20] comes he said yes you see Angels
[19:24] everyone has a guardian angel according
[19:27] to the scripture
[19:31] he Jesus said that Angels always behold
[19:35] my father's face which is in
[19:42] heaven so you got somebody always
[19:45] telling on
[19:48] you whether it's good or
[19:51] bad your angel is telling
[19:55] him you see God has an order it's not
[19:59] like he doesn't
[20:01] know but he has an angel telling on
[20:06] you
[20:08] Hallelujah brother which what you're
[20:10] saying remember when the angel went
[20:12] before
[20:13] God said Lord you seen what they're
[20:16] doing down
[20:25] in God said
[20:27] been
[20:33] and
[20:36] wormwood
[20:38] Hall maybe Gabriel
[20:43] Michel God said no no no no no this one
[20:46] is for
[20:48] me you understand
[20:50] me sometimes God
[20:53] himself into the
[20:56] fire and your
[21:00] himself step down into
[21:06] the yes
[21:08] sir Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus that's
[21:13] right he said here some time
[21:17] ago a minister told me said
[21:21] brother there's no such a thing as
[21:24] seeing
[21:27] angels
[21:30] Angels don't lead the
[21:32] church the Holy Ghost leads the
[21:35] church I said that's right but we still
[21:39] have Angelic beings as Min
[21:47] Spirit sent from the presence of
[21:50] God he said well our church don't
[21:53] believe in
[21:56] that I said I don't know what your
[21:58] Church
[22:00] believes the
[22:05] teach you never
[22:07] alone and when you feel alone that is
[22:10] the inspiration of the
[22:13] devil and all of us fight that sometime
[22:19] or I'm telling you it is a Lie from
[22:23] Heaven because once you accept that
[22:26] lonely
[22:27] feeling
[22:34] Satan will have you looking for a
[22:39] companionship he he has a right demon
[22:42] for
[22:44] you y'all better hear what I'm saying he
[22:47] ain't going to get an angel to
[22:49] fellowship with
[22:51] you going to get some buddy
[22:55] demons and they going to come in
[22:57] fellowship with you
[23:00] Hallelujah and cause you to sin and
[23:02] cause you to get
[23:05] depressed everybody knows about
[23:07] it Hallelujah that's why the Bible says
[23:11] if you keep your
[23:13] mind on
[23:15] me I will grant
[23:18] you perfect
[23:21] peace hallelu
[23:24] Hallelujah help us Jesus new is that
[23:30] right he said well brother
[23:35] Bram Angels might have been back in
[23:37] Daniel's
[23:41] time but not since the Holy Ghost has
[23:45] come angs I said do you believe that
[23:49] philli had the Holy Ghost he said
[23:53] certainly I said well who was it to come
[23:55] him come to him who was it come to
[24:02] him told him to leave that great
[24:07] Revival having and go out into the
[24:09] desert to meet the
[24:15] Ethiopian no sir the angel of the Lord
[24:19] come to
[24:21] him the Holy
[24:24] Ghost believe Peter had the Holy Ghost
[24:30] yall hear what I'm saying I'm trying to
[24:33] get you to
[24:34] understand that this battle has been so
[24:38] victoriously
[24:40] won that whenever you need an
[24:45] angel
[24:46] God see fit to give a
[24:55] message but if you don't believe it God
[24:58] can't work with
[25:00] you hallelujah hallelujah but God that
[25:04] those things what I'm trying to
[25:06] say even the prophet of God said it like
[25:09] this your house can be so
[25:13] holy till angels will visit
[25:17] it if you keep your house holy and
[25:22] C it is an invitation for an angel to
[25:25] come
[25:27] visit
[25:29] hallelujah hallelujah glory to
[25:31] God he said oh he said how many believe
[25:35] Peter had the Holy Ghost he said all do
[25:39] well who was it that night when he was
[25:42] in
[25:45] jail to cut his head off the next
[25:50] morning they was having a prayer meeting
[25:52] down at John Mark's
[25:55] house who was it shine in there
[26:00] Fire

[26:08] touch Dr the shackles off of
[26:13] him Street Angel of the

[26:56] Christ we need to wake up and know that
[27:00] God is on our

[49:31] of odors which are the prayers of the
[49:34] Saints and they sung a new song saying
[49:37] Thou Art Worthy to take the book to open

[52:22] I better read this one more scripture
[52:24] Revelation 10 9-11
[52:34] and I went into the angel and said
[52:36] him give me the little book and he said
[52:40] unto me take it eat it and it shall make
[52:45] thy belly
[52:46] bitter but it shall be in thy mouth
[52:48] sweet as honey and I took the little
[52:51] book out of the Angel's hand and ate it
[52:54] up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey
[52:58] and as soon as I had eaten it my belly
[53:01] was
[53:02] bitter said unto me thou must prophesy
[53:06] again before many peoples and Nations
[53:09] and tongues and Kings that's the
[53:13] bride so I'll say this is also symbolic
[53:18] of the
[53:22] Passover because the Passover they had
[53:26] to eat the bitter
[53:27] herbs they eat the
[53:30] sweetness they had to eat the sweetness
[53:32] of the of the meat and things of that
