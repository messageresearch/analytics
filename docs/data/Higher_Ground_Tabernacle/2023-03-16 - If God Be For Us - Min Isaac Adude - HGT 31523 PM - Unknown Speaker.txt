happy to be here this evening you know to be in this house just to praise him and you know to to hear from him and to thank him for everything that he has done for us hey man let's go straight to the word and open our Bibles in the Book of Daniel chapter 3. we read the verse 15 and verse to the verse 18. Daniel chapter 3 verse 15 to verse 18. the Bible said uh now if he be ready that at what time you hear the sound of the Cornet the flute the ARP the suckbutt the Sultry and the in all kinds of music You Fall Down and Worship the image which I have made well but if you worship not you shall be cast the same hour into the midst of the burning fiery furnace and who is that God that's a delivery out of my hands verse 16 the Bible continue to see the Shadrach Meshach and Abednego answered and said to the king o NATO we are not careful to answer thee in this matter if a bit so our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us From The Burning Fire furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand O King but if not begin known unto thee O King that we will not serve thy Gods nor worship the golden image which thou has set up amen uh let's turn again to Romans chapter 8. Romans chapter 8 verse 28 to 34. Romans 8 uh 28-34 the Bible says and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose verse 29 for whom he did for new he also did predestiness for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to become to be confirmed to the image of Islam that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified in whom he justified them he also glorified verse 31 what shall we then say to these things if God before us who can be against us his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him so freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yet rather Daddy's reason again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us amen let's bar ahead father God we come Lord tonight Lord just to say Thank you Lord we come in your praise and so father God we just want to have a good time oh Father Lord if if the world of Father God can have fun or father doing all those things going to different games and things like that Lord Lord we all we also want to enjoy ourselves with father God in your Praises Lord that's why we pray oh Father God that you continue to be with us so father Lord that you take me out of the way father and you speak to your people Lord God lord we just pray O Father God that that you feel our hearts so father God with confidence so father God to know that you will always be with us Lord Lord we thank you Father we give you all the praise and honor in Jesus Christ and we pray amen good morning coming here because uh my dad my dad listens to all my sermons so yeah he doesn't speak English so when I when there is no interpret it's kind of hard for him to so yeah if brother John can come and help me out here foreign and people made fun of him they called him names if you went through all of them is the same God who's able to give us memories everything that we ask him because what we read in Daniel chapter 3. amen you see that the King was challenging the children challenging the children they had to stand up for they had to stand up for the god that they were sir the king as the story tells us that the king told them to worship that that gravity and if they don't do it there will be cursed into the Pharisees the Bible says that they respond and saying that the god that we served amen we believe that he will be able to free us from amen if he doesn't do it but we will never worship yourself even if he doesn't do it we will die still believe it meant that we serve a wonderful God Amen that we serve a God that will serve a God who hears our prayers that we serve a God who amen who listens to our prayers amen sometimes we take this thought and we read this scriptures we don't understand how big and how how big is our news amen Amen to
