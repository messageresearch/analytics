[46:17] travel I trust that uh both of them are
[46:20] listening to the word
[46:23] tonight Psalm
[46:25] 91 beginning at the first
[46:29] verse he that dwelleth in the secret
[46:33] place of the most high shall abide under
[46:37] the shadow of the
[46:43] Almighty I will say of the
[46:45] Lord he is my refuge and my
[46:49] Fortress my God in him will I
[46:54] trust surely he shall deliver thee from
[46:58] the snares of the
[47:01] Fowler and from the noisome
[47:05] pestilence he shall cover thee with his
[47:09] feathers and under his wings shall thou
[47:13] trust his truth shall be thy shield and
[47:19] buckler thou shall not be afraid for the
[47:23] terror by
[47:25] night nor the arrow that fth by
[47:30] day nor for the
[47:33] pestilence that walketh in
[47:36] darkness nor for the destruction that
[47:38] wasteth at noon
[47:41] day A thousand shall fall at thy
[47:45] side and 10,000 at thy right
[47:49] hand but it shall not come nigh
[47:53] de Only With Thine Eyes shall thou be
[47:57] behold and see the reward of the
[48:03] wicked because thou has made the Lord
[48:07] which is my
[48:08] refuge even the most high thy
[48:13] habitation one more scripture coming
[48:16] from Revelations the 20th chapter
[48:30] Revelations
[48:32] 20 beginning at the first
[48:35] verse and I saw an angel come down from
[48:39] heaven having the key of the bottomless
[48:44] pit and a great chain in his
[48:48] hand and he laid hold on the dragon that
[48:52] old serpent which is the devil and Satan
[48:56] and bound him a thousand
[48:59] years and cast him into the bottomless
[49:03] pit and shut him up and set a seal upon
[49:08] him that he should deceive the Nations
[49:12] no
[49:13] more till the Thousand Years should be
[49:18] fulfilled and after that he must be
[49:21] loosed a little
[49:24] season and I saw
[49:27] throne and they sat upon
[49:30] them and judgment was given unto
[49:33] them and I saw the souls of them that
[49:36] were beheaded for the witness of
[49:41] Jesus for the word of
[49:43] God and which had not worshiped the
[49:47] Beast neither his image neither had
[49:50] received the mark upon their
