[47:13] [Music]
[47:21] oh my God
[47:28] brother John was supposed to be my
[47:30] interpreter this morning but something
[47:33] came up so he's not here
[47:35] so uh
[47:37] I would try my best to go even slower
[47:40] than I usually am
[47:42] just to make sure that everybody
[47:44] understands him so that we all can have
[47:46] a good time and go out with something
[47:48] from the Lord
[47:51] hey man let's uh turn to John chapter
[47:53] 11.
[47:55] 17 to verse 28. it's a it's a familiar
[47:59] story that you know almost everybody
[48:02] knows either you go you go to church or
[48:04] not or you've been to Sunday school or
[48:07] not I mean you know about the Story of
[48:09] Lazarus how you know God uh Jesus called
[48:12] him out and he was
[48:14] amen the Bible says in verse 17th
[48:19] then when Jesus came
[48:21] he found that he had
[48:24] laying in the Crave four days already
[48:26] now Bethany was night unto Jerusalem
[48:29] about 50 for Longs off
[48:32] and many of the Jews came to Martha Mary
[48:35] to comfort them concerning their brother
[48:39] then Martha as soon as she heard that
[48:42] Jesus was coming went and met him but
[48:45] Mary sat still in the house
[48:48] I mean I love this Martha didn't wait
[48:51] for Jesus to come in the house
[48:53] remember she went to the meeting
[48:56] and then verse 21 the Bible says that
[48:58] then uh
[49:01] about the verse 21 the Bible says that
[49:03] then Martha that then said Martha unto
[49:06] Jesus Lord
[49:08] if Thou Art if thou has been here my
[49:12] brother had not
[49:14] but I know that even now whatsoever that
[49:17] we ask of God God will give it thee amen
[49:21] amen here Martha is proving showing her
[49:24] faith it meant that she believes that if
[49:27] the Lord Jesus was there when Lazarus
[49:30] was still sick amen Jesus was going to
[49:33] stop amen he was going to stop uh our
[49:36] death
[49:37] human Lazarus will not die if Jesus was
[49:40] there verse 23 says that Jesus says unto
[49:44] her thy brother shall rise again
[49:48] and Martha saith unto him I know that he
[49:51] shall rise again in the resurrection of
[49:54] the last day amen here she's talking
[49:56] about the resurrection of the Saints and
[49:58] the you know the end of everything but
[50:00] Jesus said unto her I am the
[50:02] resurrection and the life
[50:05] he that believeth in me
[50:07] though he were dead yet shall he leave
[50:10] and whatsoever leaveth and Believers in
[50:14] me
[50:15] shall never die Believers doubt this
[50:19] she saith unto him yet Lord I believe
[50:23] that thou art the Christ the son of God
[50:26] which shall come in the word in the
[50:29] world
[50:31] verse 28 and when she had said then and
[50:34] when she had said she went her way and
[50:37] called Mary her sister secretly saying
[50:41] the master is come and calleth 40.
[50:45] amen you may be seated
[50:48] and when this morning I have uh
[50:52] a little subject uh
[50:54] that we entitled Jesus the person of the
[50:57] Resurrection
[50:59] and then we'll try to teach a little bit
[51:01] uh about this verse of Saint John
[51:05] chapter 11 verse uh
[51:08] the of this uh Saint John chapter 11.
[51:11] amen here is talking about the
[51:13] resurrection amen because Lazarus was
[51:16] dead and and and and Jesus was called
[51:19] when Lazarus was yet still was yet sick
[51:22] but Jesus Took for long I mean the Bible
[51:25] says if you read the verse 5 it says
[51:27] that Jesus spent two days when he heard
[51:29] that Lazarus was sick instead of going
[51:32] straight to Lazarus Jesus didn't go
[51:34] straight to Lazarus I mean he was doing
[51:36] his own business and he was doing
[51:38] something else and he came when Lazarus
[51:40] was dead remember before we start uh as
[51:43] a background of my my my subject this
[51:46] morning I want to uh uh uh talk a little
[51:49] bit about the Trinity of God as Sons
[51:52] amen the Trinity of God the son because
[51:55] we know that the prophet says that God
[51:57] will come under three uh under three
[51:59] sons under three sons son's name I think
[52:02] that's how he goes I mean he says that
[52:04] the first one will be the son of the son
[52:07] of man the second one will be the Son of
[52:09] God and the third one will be the son of
[52:11] David then he says that between the Son
[52:14] of God and the son of David he has to
[52:16] come back again as the son of man so now
[52:18] we see here in John if you read in John
[52:21] chapter 1 verse one the Bible says that
[52:23] in the beginning amen let's go in and
[52:26] read it just to be sure the Bible says
[52:27] that in the beginning was the word and
[52:29] the Word was with God and the Word was
[52:32] God the saint was in the beginning with
[52:35] God as we preached it long time ago the
[52:37] Bible here the Bible is only talking
[52:39] about the beginning when the word
[52:41] started amen but thank God we had a
[52:44] prophet amen who had the spirit of an
[52:46] ego amen he was able to go back before
[52:50] the beginning saying that before the
[52:52] beginning before before God became the
[52:56] word amen he was a thought they meant
[52:58] that thought was was filling out the
[53:01] entire universe that thought was filling
[53:03] out the entire space amen but in order
[53:05] for him to create him and he had to
[53:07] condense himself amen into a form amen
[53:11] that that form that we call the logos
[53:13] the prophet said that the law goes amen
[53:15] it was it's like a white hallow amen
[53:18] it's a little form that Jesus I mean
[53:20] that God had to condense himself in that
[53:22] form Amen in order for him to start
[53:24] creating and then when he started
[53:26] creating that let there be light amen he
[53:28] started creating that letter be animals
[53:30] and and birds and sea and everything
[53:33] okay they told me just to slow it down
[53:37] it meant uh to be a letter be uh uh
[53:40] light and and everything it might that
[53:43] is when he became the word amen that is
[53:46] when John started recording that in the
[53:48] beginning was the word because before
[53:51] the beginning it wasn't the word before
[53:53] the beginning it was just a thought
[53:55] amen here it says that in the beginning
[53:57] was the word
[53:58] and that word was with God
[54:01] and the saint was in the beginning with
[54:04] God
[54:05] verse 3 says that all things were made
[54:08] by him
[54:09] and without him was not anything made
[54:13] that was made
[54:15] and in him was life
[54:17] Amen in John chapter 11 it says that I
[54:21] am the resurrection and the life and to
[54:23] be said that in him was life
[54:25] and the life was the light of man
[54:28] and a large soreness in darkness and
[54:31] darkness comprehended it not
[54:34] Amen in that beginning that was the word
[54:37] it was the word amen here it says that
[54:41] that word lived Among Us amen thou word
[54:45] amen became a man in other words he
[54:48] became the son of man Jesus Christ the
[54:51] prophet and he lived Among Us amen he
[54:55] ate with us amen he fellowship with us
[54:58] amen amen he he was sick sometimes amen
[55:02] he was hungry amen he became a man he
[55:05] became the son of man amen and then at
[55:08] the cross
[55:09] amen at the cross when Jesus died
[55:12] because if you read the Prophet The
[55:14] Prophet says that the spirit of God came
[55:17] to Jesus when Jesus was baptized amen
[55:20] that's what the Spirit came because the
[55:25] that that's that's when the spirit says
[55:30] amen amen that's what John said
[55:33] amen that that he saw the spirit of God
[55:37] as a dove a life
[55:40] amen coming down on him amen that was
[55:44] when the spirit of God came to him
[55:47] amen and that Spirit left him he said
[55:51] amen before before he died on the cross
[55:54] because he had to die as a man
[55:58] so that Spirit left him and when it went
[56:01] and that Spirit came down as the Son of
[56:03] God which is the Holy Ghost yes
[56:09] uh Son of God
[56:12] Son of God feasted you Son of God which
[56:16] is the Holy Ghost
[56:18] amen and he will come back as the son of
[56:21] David and the Millennium still reign as
[56:24] the King of Kings yeah
[56:28] amen so the prophet here says that who
[56:31] is the son of man the prophetic
[56:33] elephants in the message is it uh it is
[56:37] the rising of the son the prophet says
[56:43] and to be waved again we realize
[56:47] in the last day according to Luke
[56:49] chapter 17 verse 30.
[56:52] that in the sun day again
[57:00] in the day that the s-o-n of men will be
[57:04] revealed
[57:07] I mean
[57:09] or waved again over the people
[57:14] Now who is the son of man
[57:17] in the beginning was the word
[57:20] and the Word was with God
[57:23] and the Word was God
[57:26] and the Word was made flesh
[57:30] Among Us
[57:32] amen and that dwelling Among Us that is
[57:35] that that's the son of man it's the word
[57:37] being made flesh
[57:42] I mean
[57:44] yeah amen so now the Bible the Bible is
[57:48] telling us the entire Bible is telling
[57:50] us our three appearance of the son of
[57:52] man
[57:57] you see that the first time was with
[57:59] Abraham
[58:02] amen Abraham met him as a son of man
[58:07] amen remember when you went uh uh when
[58:10] you went when Sarah was in the tent uh
[58:15] amen amen amen God took himself a body
[58:19] created a body that he dwelt in jail
[58:21] remember
[58:23] and he went to visit he went to visit
[58:26] Abraham
[58:27] he might notice that before that
[58:31] amen you'll see that Abraham had Visions
[58:36] Abraham had had dreams Abraham Abraham
[58:39] heard the voice of the Lord
[58:43] amen but Abraham his body wasn't changed
[58:49] until he had to meet the behunters had
[58:52] to meet him the son of man
[58:56] amen and then as the prophet says that
[58:59] his back was turned against against the
[59:02] tent
[59:06] and when and when and when he gave them
[59:08] the promise of a son
[59:12] amen Sarah Sarah loved
[59:16] amen God was able to discern the the
[59:19] thoughts that was the the thought of
[59:21] Sarah
[59:25] amen but Sarah when when God told
[59:28] Abraham that why is Sarah laughing
[59:33] okay amen Sarah lied and said that she
[59:36] didn't laugh
[59:38] amen God was able even to kill Sarah
[59:42] right there in that same moment
[59:46] remember he couldn't do it because of
[59:48] Abraham
[59:51] amen you'll notice that Abraham's body
[59:53] and Sarah's womb was dead uh
[59:57] they are
[1:00:01] dead okay okay
[1:00:03] amen but when they met the son of man
[1:00:06] mechanism
[1:00:08] they had the promise amen of a
[1:00:10] resurrection
[1:00:13] to be brought back as young people
[1:00:21] amen right after that you'll notice that
[1:00:23] the Bible says that they went to a trip
[1:00:26] that they walked for miles and they went
[1:00:28] to that King Who Loved Sarah it's just
[1:00:38] amen that you find it in Genesis chapter
[1:00:41] 18 verse 9 and 14 I'm not going to read
[1:00:43] it okay uh
[1:00:48] uh Genesis 18 verse 9 to 14.
[1:00:54] and after and Jesus Jesus the second son
[1:00:58] of man
[1:01:01] amen you'll see that he was the son of
[1:01:03] man
[1:01:05] amen he revealed the secrets of the
[1:01:08] woman at the well
[1:01:12] amen he taught her about her great sins
[1:01:20] notice that every time that there is a
[1:01:22] son of man on earth
[1:01:25] a secret has to be revealed
[1:01:29] a secret has to be told
[1:01:32] amen with Abraham amen God told Abraham
[1:01:37] what Sarah was thinking
[1:01:40] and before he left
[1:01:43] amen himself says that shall I to
[1:01:46] Abraham my servant what I'm about to do
[1:02:21] so Jesus here you if you read and uh
[1:02:24] Jesus here the son of man
[1:02:28] amen amen he had to reveal the secret of
[1:02:31] the woman at the well
[1:02:34] he told her about all about her five
[1:02:37] husbands I'm pretty sure
[1:02:41] amen and when he died
[1:02:44] amen the Bible says that the day of the
[1:02:47] Resurrection
[1:02:49] he meant a resurrection happened
[1:02:52] he meant he died as one person
[1:02:56] amen but he rose up with many other sins
[1:03:02] amen that's another Resurrection with
[1:03:05] the son of man
[1:03:08] amen you will find it in Matthew chapter
[1:03:11] 50 verse Matthew chapter 27 verse 50 to
[1:03:14] 53 yeah
[1:03:20] and many bodies many bodies of the
[1:03:23] Saints slept a rose with him they called
[1:03:27] the senses amen so he promised in Luke
[1:03:31] chapter 17 30.
[1:03:35] at the day of the son of man
[1:03:38] amen everything that happens
[1:03:45] is supposed to be happening amen at the
[1:03:49] end of the day
[1:03:57] amen and God has to come as the son of
[1:04:01] man again for the Gentiles
[1:04:06] amen because their amen where Jesus came
[1:04:10] Jesus didn't come for the Gentiles
[1:04:13] amen Jesus came for his brothers the
[1:04:16] Jews
[1:04:17] amen but he had to give the Gentiles
[1:04:20] that same Grace
[1:04:23] amen he had to give them that same
[1:04:25] Revelation
[1:04:28] when he had to give them that same
[1:04:30] experience
[1:04:32] amen so he had to come back as the son
[1:04:35] of man
[1:04:37] the ministry of the son of man the
[1:04:39] minister amen so that's why you see that
[1:04:42] he sent us a prophet
[1:04:44] amen by the name of William Marion
[1:04:47] Williams
[1:04:49] he was a son of man
[1:04:54] because a prophet is a son of man
[1:04:58] amen a prophet is a son of man
[1:05:01] but he is the Son of Man by Jesus he is
[1:05:06] the son of man Jesus
[1:05:08] amen so he was a son of man
[1:05:12] amen revealing the son of man
[1:05:16] amen that doesn't make brother Branham
[1:05:18] the son of man assassins
[1:05:21] or he doesn't make brother Branham a god
[1:05:24] that is supposed to be worshiped or
[1:05:26] something yes
[1:05:28] amen but he was a vessel that God used
[1:05:37] Amen in order for God to accomplish the
[1:05:40] Perfection because God always works in
[1:05:43] three okay uh download Perfection
[1:05:47] amen and he's and and then through him
[1:05:50] amen the bride will have the rapturing
[1:05:53] faith
[1:05:56] amen through the sermons and through the
[1:05:58] messages amen the bride will have the
[1:06:01] faith amen for the resurrection
[1:06:08] amen amen because in first
[1:06:12] Thessalonians amen chapter four Iman is
[1:06:14] talking about the resurrection
[1:06:18] he meant the resurrection that is
[1:06:20] supposed to come
[1:06:22] amen amen you see that here that in
[1:06:25] every son of man Ministries
[1:06:30] you'll see that there is a secret that
[1:06:32] needs to be told that is to be revealed
[1:06:36] and there is a Rapture and I'm sorry
[1:06:38] there is a resurrection that needs to
[1:06:40] happen
[1:06:42] amen and here God also told us a secret
[1:06:47] the secret of the seventh seals
[1:06:51] amen if you notice that the seventh seal
[1:06:54] uh
[1:06:58] amen he was silent
[1:07:02] Amen in other words it was a secret
[1:07:05] and nobody can tell what's in the
[1:07:08] silence watching the silence
[1:07:10] and that secret had to be revealed to us
[1:07:16] that secret has to be told
[1:07:19] amen through the ministry of that son of
[1:07:22] man
[1:07:26] amen amen and and he says that because I
[1:07:30] leave
[1:07:31] you shall live
[1:07:52] amen because I'm alive you also will be
[1:07:55] alive
[1:07:57] amen because the bride is the word
[1:08:02] amen and the groom is also the word
[1:08:05] and one plus one equals
[1:08:12] you shall live awesome
[1:08:18] it was a certain death
[1:08:21] but because of Abraham across the
[1:08:24] Abraham God couldn't kill her
[1:08:27] man it wasn't that anything that Sarah
[1:08:29] did it wasn't but she wasn't dead but
[1:08:31] because of her marriage or something
[1:09:03] amen because God said that the day that
[1:09:06] you will eat from this fruit from this
[1:09:07] street that day you will die
[1:09:13] in order for him to redeem his bride
[1:09:17] I mean download the default
[1:09:21] he had to become equal to his wife
[1:09:26] amen so he also took that
[1:11:24] the Bible says that Jesus loved Mary and
[1:11:39] amen Jesus almost Jesus grew up with
[1:11:42] them
[1:11:43] amen he loved them so much
[1:11:46] amen by here Lazarus is sick
[1:11:50] and Martha sent people to go tell Jesus
[1:11:54] that your loved one is sick a mouth
[1:12:01] that the person that you love is sick
[1:12:05] as a human
[1:12:08] they tell you that there's someone that
[1:12:10] you love is sick
[1:12:12] amen you will stop everything and rush
[1:12:15] to that person
[1:12:17] amen you will cancel all the planes that
[1:12:20] you had and rushed to Aid that person
[1:12:24] amen by here with Jesus he was different
[1:12:33] but here he says that when he heard that
[1:12:36] he was sick
[1:12:40] he bought for two days in the same place
[1:12:44] so it looks like Jesus didn't care they
[1:12:47] said
[1:12:51] it looks like Jesus couldn't see the
[1:12:53] gravity of the situation
[1:12:57] amen here you see that the Pharisees
[1:12:59] they came to Mary and the sorry to
[1:13:01] comfort Mary foreign
[1:13:28] amen and some of them started to
[1:13:30] criticize Jesus
[1:13:33] that we thought that he loved this guy
[1:13:37] and we have heard about all the Miracles
[1:13:40] that he has done
[1:13:42] we have heard how we heal people
[1:13:47] but how come he couldn't do a single
[1:13:50] sacrifice for his for his loved one
[1:13:52] is
[1:13:56] amen but Jesus knew exactly what he was
[1:13:59] doing
[1:14:01] amen Jesus knew what the father told him
[1:14:06] he says that these things say it here
[1:14:10] and after he said unto them our friend
[1:14:13] Lazarus sleepeth but I go that I may
[1:14:16] wake him awake him out of sleep owns
[1:14:21] foreign
[1:14:27] 11. okay
[1:14:32] this is
[1:14:41] now here verse uh verse 15.
[1:14:46] the Bible says that and I am glad for
[1:14:49] your sakes
[1:14:50] that I was not there uh
[1:14:56] okay
[1:15:04] I am glad for your sakes that I was not
[1:15:07] there oh yes
[1:15:10] to the intent you may believe
[1:15:13] oh they they said
[1:15:17] it shows
[1:15:19] nevertheless let us go unto him
[1:15:24] amen here Jesus is saying that I'm happy
[1:15:27] that I wasn't there when he was sick
[1:15:33] because we serve the god that likes to
[1:15:36] show up sometimes
[1:15:40] we serve a God that likes to show off
[1:15:44] it meant sometimes you let the situation
[1:15:46] be become worse okay okay
[1:15:52] he likes when the situation becomes
[1:15:55] worse
[1:15:56] Amen to show off his power
[1:16:00] amen so now here Jesus comes amen Jesus
[1:16:03] knew that Lazarus was already dead now
[1:16:05] he's coming
[1:16:10] amen the Bible says that it was four
[1:16:12] days late
[1:16:17] according to the Romans law uh
[1:16:22] amen after three days the tomb shouldn't
[1:16:25] be open
[1:16:26] um
[1:16:30] to open the tomb after three days
[1:16:35] because the body has already seen
[1:16:37] corruption
[1:16:39] for me but Jesus here comes purposely
[1:16:42] after after three days the fourth day he
[1:16:45] shows up
[1:16:48] amen and then as we know Jesus that
[1:16:51] every word Jesus goes amen there is
[1:16:53] always noises
[1:16:57] the noises will reach the place before
[1:17:00] himself even goes to that place
[1:17:05] so this is the case here amen people
[1:17:07] already went to tell Martha that Jesus
[1:17:10] is coming before Jesus even showed up
[1:17:15] amen so now here you'll understand that
[1:17:18] Jesus didn't go to the house where
[1:17:20] Martha was
[1:17:25] the Bible said that Martha as soon as
[1:17:28] heard that Jesus was on his way amen she
[1:17:30] rose up
[1:17:31] quickly and went to meet Jesus
[1:17:43] said
[1:17:46] Lord if you were here
[1:17:51] my brother will still be alive
[1:17:58] [Music]
[1:18:09] amen she's showing to Jesus the faith
[1:18:12] that she had uh
[1:18:15] she's showing to Jesus that everything
[1:18:17] is possible to you
[1:18:20] amen that nothing is impossible
[1:18:24] amen so not Jesus she said Jesus here
[1:18:27] sees her faith
[1:18:30] amen and Jesus replied in verse 23.
[1:18:35] that thy brother shall rise again
[1:18:40] now Martha here she thought that Jesus
[1:18:43] was talking about the resurrection at
[1:18:45] the last days
[1:18:50] amen Martha here she thought that me and
[1:18:53] Jesus here is was talking about first
[1:18:55] Thessalonians chapter 4.
[1:19:00] amen but Jesus here was talking about
[1:19:03] the present time
[1:19:05] amen Jesus was talking about that
[1:19:08] situation there
[1:19:11] amen Jesus said to her that I'm not
[1:19:14] talking about the last the resurrection
[1:19:15] of the last day that I'm talking about
[1:19:17] this this time right here
[1:19:24] because I am the resurrection
[1:19:28] what we got our entitled from amen Jesus
[1:19:31] is the person of the Resurrection
[1:19:36] because you will understand that the
[1:19:38] resurrection is not an event
[1:19:43] amen but the resurrection is a person
[1:19:47] amen and that person is the Lord Jesus
[1:19:50] Christ
[1:19:51] amen Jesus says that I am the
[1:19:54] resurrection
[1:19:56] and I am the life
[1:19:58] and he that believeth In Me Is
[1:20:02] though he were dead a memory amen yet
[1:20:06] shall he live again
[1:20:08] amen now here verse 27 Martha and now
[1:20:12] she's punctuating everything that Jesus
[1:20:14] said with an amen
[1:20:19] amen she said yeah Lord I believe that
[1:20:23] thou art the Christ the son of God is
[1:20:29] we shall come into the world
[1:20:33] Amen so when you have a promise from God
[1:20:36] you see if it's available amen you
[1:20:38] always have to reply with an amen
[1:20:42] amen you always have to believe it
[1:20:45] you men have the faith like Martha
[1:20:49] Lord I believe that thou art the Son of
[1:20:52] God
[1:20:54] lord I believe that everything is
[1:20:56] possible
[1:20:58] Lord I believe that you are the person
[1:21:01] of the Resurrection
[1:21:03] Lord I believe that my brother should my
[1:21:06] brother will live again
[1:21:12] amen so when she said so
[1:21:15] she went her way
[1:21:18] party secretly
[1:21:21] to call Mary uh
[1:21:24] amen and here now I will stop a little
[1:21:28] bit there and try to um
[1:21:30] you see that here
[1:21:33] Mary and Martha represented the scents
[1:21:37] that were still alive
[1:21:44] who was already in the Tomb
[1:21:47] amen was representing the sins that are
[1:21:50] asleep
[1:21:53] and Jesus was representing the living
[1:21:56] word
[1:21:58] amen so here you have the sense dollar
[1:22:01] alive
[1:22:03] and you have the sense that are dead
[1:22:06] that are asleep
[1:22:08] and now you have the word
[1:22:11] amen because the Rapture
[1:22:16] amen is only for the bride
[1:22:20] the rapture
[1:22:22] it's only for the elected
[1:22:26] for the call out
[1:22:29] amen so now here the Bible says that and
[1:22:33] when she had said so
[1:22:36] she went her way party uh and called
[1:22:41] Mary her sister secretly
[1:22:45] Amen in other words it wasn't a public
[1:22:48] show I mean I'm not uh
[1:22:52] but it was in the secrets
[1:22:56] she went and called Mary Ellen and she
[1:23:00] says that the master is 4D
[1:23:55] because Mary was in the room with the
[1:23:58] Pharisees
[1:24:00] they met the Pharisees who did not
[1:24:03] believe in the Resurrection
[1:24:07] the Pharisees who did not believe in
[1:24:10] miracles
[1:24:12] the Pharisees who were there to
[1:24:14] criticize Jesus
[1:24:17] amen so Martha went to her
[1:24:20] in that room
[1:24:23] Amen in that chamber
[1:24:25] amen secretly to call her
[1:24:29] that the master is come
[1:24:32] and he's calling for you
[1:24:35] amen you see that the first sport was
[1:24:38] was was uh I'm pretty sure healing
[1:24:42] the second put was prophecy
[1:24:46] you see that those two pools it was a
[1:24:49] public show yeah
[1:24:53] healing and many people tried to imitate
[1:24:56] them
[1:25:04] they imitated the first pool
[1:25:07] they imitated the second Point
[1:25:09] amen but now the third one had to come
[1:25:14] amen which was not going to be a public
[1:25:17] show
[1:25:19] amen but he had to be a secret
[1:25:23] amen you had to go in the room
[1:25:27] and meet Jesus
[1:25:31] then you will have the Revelation
[1:25:33] amen because the third poor is the
[1:25:36] Revelation
[1:25:38] is the secrets amen so now here Martha
[1:25:43] she was working on that third pool
[1:25:47] she went in the secret
[1:25:50] Amen to call Mary amen she became the
[1:25:54] voice of the Resurrection
[1:25:56] amen Mary come out of this room
[1:26:00] it Mary come out of the Pharisees
[1:26:04] and go meet Jesus
[1:26:08] come out of my people come out of hurt
[1:26:10] my people foreign
[1:27:12] but in order for the resurrection to
[1:27:15] happen uh in I mean in all I mean
[1:27:22] amen Mary had to have that same
[1:27:25] experience that Martha had
[1:27:29] in other words hearing just what Martha
[1:27:32] said was not enough
[1:27:36] amen Mary also had to get out of the
[1:27:39] where she was and but he was
[1:27:43] making go meet Jesus personally
[1:27:47] amen go and be in contact with that
[1:27:50] person of the Resurrection
[1:27:53] amen so in order for the Rapture in
[1:27:56] order for the resurrection to happen
[1:27:59] amen you have to be in contact with
[1:28:01] Jesus
[1:28:03] amen it's the same thing with the Saints
[1:28:06] of all the scent of the Old Testament
[1:28:09] is
[1:28:12] some of them were prophets
[1:28:15] even some some of them were Warriors
[1:28:18] some of them amen some of them were
[1:28:22] preachers and some of them
[1:28:24] amen but you will see that but what they
[1:28:28] did or the the experiences that they had
[1:28:31] before
[1:28:33] is before amen couldn't get them
[1:28:37] couldn't help them to get out of the
[1:28:39] Tomb or to be resurrected
[1:28:44] but they had to meet Jesus
[1:28:47] amen they had to come in contact with
[1:28:50] the person of the Resurrection
[1:28:53] in order for them to rise
[1:28:56] in order for them to be resurrected
[1:28:59] again
[1:29:01] amen so you have to come in contact with
[1:29:03] him
[1:29:05] amen if you want to be among those
[1:29:07] people who will be changed
[1:29:10] even if you want to be among those
[1:29:13] people who will be resurrected

[1:30:40] that's about to happen
[1:30:44] amen and now here at this last time that
[1:30:47] this is the the end of the days
[1:30:53] amen it's a personal revelation
