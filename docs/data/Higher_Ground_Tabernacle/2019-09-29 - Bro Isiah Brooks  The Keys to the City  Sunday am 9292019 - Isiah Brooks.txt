[Music] what am I [Music] Oh God Oh Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] amen love the Lord it's gonna go right into the word as we stand we ask that you turn with us the First Samuel the fifteenth chapter we've been talking about another city another Kingdom another world another dimension but today I just kind of want to pause for a moment I would kind of like insert this into what we've been talking about if we can just tone it down just a little bit of slack out of ring first time year fifteenth chapter we're gonna begin at the seventeenth verse the reason why I I chose this message I was listening to perfect weakness perfect strength and I realized that we have a long way to go I think sometimes we get a little mixed up because we feel that we understand what brother branham has spoken or what the Word of God is saying to us but to my observation I see that we have fallen short the bride really needs a revival we're going to read the fifteenth chapter to 17th through the 23rd verse and I just want to say by God's grace um I'm a little pretty much heavy in my heart because of the circumstances and the situations in which I have encountered in the years that I have been part of this message and I really believe with all of my heart that this message or the people around the message should be on fire not lukewarm not cold but absolutely on fire for God and as we all can see that is not the case somewhere something has gone wrong and we know it's not the word first Sammy the 15th chapter beginning at the 17th verse and Samuel said when thou was little in thine own site was thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel and the Lord anointed the king over Israel and the Lord sent the on a journey and said go and utterly destroy the sinner the Amalekites and fight against them until they be consumed wherefore then this dog not obey the voice of the Lord but did fly upon the spoil and did evil in the sight of the Lord and Samuel and Saul said unto Samuel yay I have obeyed the voice of the Lord and have gone the way which the Lord sent me and have brought the Agag the king of emilich and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites but the people took of the spoil sheep and oxen the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice unto the Lord that God in Gilgal and Samuel said have the Lord as great delight in burnt offering and sacrifices as in obedient obeying the voice of the Lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hark and then the fat of rams for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry because thou has rejected the word of the Lord he also have rejected D from being king let us pray father we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for being so good to us and Lord we come before you as humbly as we know how we know that there is nothing we can do we're just here and I pray that you give us grace to move completely out of your way Lord Jesus we have been crying out for revival and only you can bring the revival be merciful upon us and give us the words that you would have us speak and your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated the subject of the matter the subject this morning would be the keys to the kingdom or the keys to the city kind of strange for me to read Samuel here or the story of what went on there with Saul and many of us are for me with the background of Saul Saul was chosen by the people Saul was a good-looking man a great man a man of statue but it was the first King in which Israel had after rejecting God as their King Samuel told the people that they were making a mistake and Samuel actually took it personally and he said unto the people I've been a good prophet I've not asked of you anything I've never charged you with anything and everything that I ever have received has been of God I've been a faithful prophet I have given you the word of the Lord an inspired of Samuel spli before the people they still chose Saul I'd like to say it like this you always would want God's choosing because we really don't know what we're doing and we're forever making mistakes but when God chooses there are no mistakes made nevertheless in one of the incidents God it told Saul when you go to battle against the Amalekites I want you to kill everything kind of familiar because God has told us that he wanted us to kill everything God has said unto us that he needed us to die and to rot our greatest battle is not the devil your greatest battle is yourself it is your greatest enemy and you must know that God wants him dead we must understand by God's grace that our actions speaks louder than our words and the prophet of God said that God hears the thoughts of your heart louder in heaven than on earth so we may be able to at the Christian but with God he sees exactly what's in our hearts I did come in this last day to play Church we have come to serve God and not with part of our hearts but with all of our hearts because God will not accept anything less than that God is not a God of religion he's a God of salvation and I want you and unterstand to understand that what God has given us in this last day we ought to be running up and down the streets shouting out what God has done there are millions upon millions of people who would love to have this message in their hands and God has chosen you he has given us the opportunity to eternal life you know John the Baptist was a covenant angel he wasn't just a prophet he was introducing a new covenant and when he introduced Jesus Christ he introduced grace and truth and the only way that you were going to be able to obtain this grace and truth you had to follow the leadership of John the Baptist because he pointed to grace and truth I said that so you can understand that William Branham was not just a prophet he was a covenant angel somebody help me here so that you understand that when he came forth just like John the Baptist he pointed to the sky and he said this is my lord this is the same one that was in the beginning and he pointed us to a covenant we understand it is unconditional to those who are elected and chosen by God from the foundation of the world but I think some time we take it for granted somehow we think God is going to pull us through a whole pull us through a pipe absolutely not you and I must work at our salvation grace would give us that that said all of that to get back to Samuel and Saul Saul was put under pressure and I'm gonna tell you something pressure is coming and is now and you must understand you're going to have to make a choice whether to obey God or not to obey God to follow the leadership of a man or to follow the Linnet leadership of God is that right and this is what Saul did so I forgot where God has brought him from see when you little and God makes you great that's awesome but sometime greatness seemed to get to our lines and when we allow ourselves to think of ourselves as being something when we're nothing you're in trouble hello and I'm gonna tell you something the people around what we call the bride or the message a more prideful than the apostolic s-- more pride for than any denomination I've ever seen because we got the message but that attitude will cause you to be left behind God is looking for humility he's looking for people who are humble help us Lord because that's what happened to Saul he got lifted up let me tell you something God means what he says and he says what he means never thing that you're going to get away with anything because God has chosen you whatever you sow you're going to reap that's just the truth I'm serious this morning because you know I realized this morning that somehow we get it in our heads that no matter what grace we've been justified before the foundation of the world as though we never sinned in the first place if you've got the seal of the Holy Ghost that applies to you until you get the seal of the Holy Ghost make your calling and election sure those kinds of a statements are only for those who are elected to make a rapture you understand what I'm saying in other words your life must qualify your life must vindicate you are the bride it's not just your words it's not because you believe in the Prophet millions died under the inspiration and preaching of Moses millions they believed or follow the Prophet but because of their disobedience it lost feel this message must be obeyed now think oh this grace grace has always been even in the time of law grace was still there God or not he's not going to excuse us not this day because to whom much is given much is required am i making sense if I'm getting is if God through my voice is getting you to even think about what you're doing some people and brother branham's explained it you can speak in tongues you can shout you can dance you can pay tithing you can come to church you can do all those works and still be lost hello you can clean Malachi's for is your prophet and you're right but we must obey the words in which he spoke because the wars in which he spoke was the words of God hallelujah God says well for this town not obey the voice of the Lord but this fly upon the spoil and did evil in the sight of the Lord what was the evil it wasn't the lamb or the goat or the little animals that was evil it was evil because God told him to kill them all it was evil because they disobeyed God it was evil cuz they chose their will over God's will here's somebody and whenever you choose to do your will over God's will it is evil hello somebody this is why you and I must die to self it's too much flesh we want a revival and gods are saying the only way you can get a revival is that you must die first you must die you must rot to yourself is that all right folks it's the truth just like I've been saying the only way that you're going to get out of here is through prayer you can read all the words you won't but without prayer prayers the fire you understand me you've got a call on the name of the Lord I know a lot of preachers have told you all kinds of things and i'ma tell you and that's why the Catholic Church is what they are now because of preachers twisting you know what I'm saying if you know the message if you listen to the tapes if you read the books if you read your Bible you'll know I'm preaching truth you'll know I'm preaching the truth but everybody else they don't line getting a big church big money big names big fame hallelujah I care about none of that I care because I know I will have to stand before God and give an account for what I say and do what you've heard which would you prefer would you prefer just a message that gonna make you happy and jump and shout anything but would you rather somebody tell you the truth we're talking about truth here let us not fool ourselves all of us know we need more Jesus and you and I need to know that this is the hour to get more of him because there come at a time when that door is shut you can call on the name of Jesus all you want to and brother man said you're getting nothing this is the time and guess what this is also the time where Satan is distracting us he's trying to get our minds on everything else but the rapture we come to make a rapture we heard the shout of the rapture we heard the voice of the algae our danger of the rapture we all a destiny and that destiny is to another city another place another Kingdom and only those who obey because he says if you love me you'll keep my Commandments this is not something we can pretend it is nothing that we can carry on and fake like is going to it's gonna be but you and I must understand amen there's something you must do brother looks what can I do what must I do and you must yield you must put your plate self in a place that says Lord I surrender not some but I surrender all and God if I don't know how to surrender all give me the grace revealed to me show me the way show me how to surrender all oh yeah yeah yeah because that is the only way we're gonna make a rapture God is looking for a bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh religion he's had those he's had religion for thousands of years he's looking for holiness hello is that okay listen the Bible says listen do you understand what you are doing rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft you know what witchcraft is rebellion that means to disobey God willfully is like witchcraft you've got a spell cast on you something is wrong with you because you don't fear God and Satan somewhere has cast a spell on you that's what it is stopping this oh stop it is mean you ain't they're so stubborn this means you got to do what you want to do is that right we preach don't wear high heel shoes you do it anyway we tell you not to wear tights wiener like dresses you do it anyway hello oh come on you don't have to say Amen but my pony is only holiness holiness see what we fail to see is that we are being affecting infected we're letting the germs of Hollywood make us sick and here God is taking us out of the pest house and now the devil is putting us back in there and we don't even realize amen that the hour of the coming of the Lord is really at hand and we get into our oh oh you can't tell me what to do and I'm gonna wear what I want to wear there's a lot of people in Hell with that attitude a lot of people oh that ain't necessary well let God be the judge the Bible says it is whether it be male or female if we dress in any kinda way that will cause a man or woman to lust up on us we have to either committed fornication or adultery whoo somebody shout with me this morning see what people don't understand is that most preachers are not gonna tell you and I'm coming message preachers you know why they're not gonna tell you because hoping an a hoping to get your favor they want your favor oh I got some good quotes here this morning brother BAM taught my favor he said that's bad when you think I'm going to invite a preacher and this preacher is gonna do this for me he said that's evil I got the quote no preacher if he's in his right mind he knows there's not one thing he can do for you cuz he can't even do it for himself here's somebody we all need help we all have to kill kill this thing which graph stubbornness is as the iniquity and idolatry iniquity is when you know to do good and you don't do it and the Dollar Tree is that you know what you're doing worshipping yourself you're gonna worship somebody you're gonna worship something because it's in you to worship and when you go contrary to the Word of God and you are in your mirror and you think and you look all good and you know the way you're dressing is not according to the word then you have taken the choice to idolize yourself over the Word of God I'm gonna give you something sweet in just a moment how do I go to the whole time but I want you to understand this is a serious time we're living in why we don't have a young people that's on fire because the elders are not on fire and I'm not talking about all I'm just saying we're we're just not on fire how can they want what you have when they look at you and see that you're not happy with what you had oh this church needs some fire the Bible says it took talking to so because thou has rejected the word of the Lord he has also rejected thee from being King do you think youuuu above it God can reject you from being Queen if he rejected him from being key he can reject you started out being king and God comes along because of his disobedience and his rebellion and his witchcraft spirit God rejected him and guess what is because he followed the crowd he followed the crowd everybody else is doing it why can't I that's what's happening if this message church does something over here oh it's okay and if this message church do it does something over here always okay well it's okay if they all doing with the message Oh nonsense we're not going to heaven by a group we're going to heaven each individual we are the Gentiles hallelujah we don't go by nation we go one person at a time is that right look how God that God His disciples he got a one by one you follow me you follow me you he could have collectively got him together but he called them individually this how God calls you you see what we fail to see is that when John the Baptist pointed out Jesus the scripture says some of the disciples followed Jesus some of them heard John and they followed Jesus think about it think about it that's just where we are now some follow Jesus and some still following John come and Jesus John said this man is greater than I am I'm not even wiser to unless his suit suit suit latches hey somebody and you and I have been directed to follow Jesus but listen it was John who was like a motor kiya you know of one of the Chamberlain's that actually told Esther how the king and what keying the King like and you and I we know what the King likes because we have had a message that would give us insight to what Jesus like he come for a bride if every age the bride has failed Jesus every age even the one that was in Pentecost failed Jesus is that right according to the message with brother I'm saying when Jesus came to impregnate her she was already impregnated with another man's seed you call that the deeds of the Nicolaitans she had already come to a place where she had been defiled and she could not bring forth a men the raw you seed of God but this age this bride age God selected a few people that will come and be obedient to his word no matter what the pressures are she's not going to fail him she's the only one and because of her and because of what she does in this age the resurrection takes place hallelujah hey and she will be bold in his bold and flesh of his flesh no matter what she don't care what the bishop said she don't care what the Pope says she don't care what the church says she's going to stay with the word and guess what signs and wonders will follow her hmm let me tell you something friends will cause you to fail if you listen and you don't even understand there are people who are anointed have been placed into your path to make you fail you share a brother busted' candidate remember the Prophet God told him listen don't go back that way and the Lord raised up another prophet a prophet deceived a prophet but she'd that prophet the first one knew what God said but the false the prophet who comes to him and says listen come on by my house we gonna have dinner whatever the case may be and I you a different way you don't even have to go back the way you came and God had already told the Prophet don't you do it now alright and that's what we do all Frieza said come on let's do this that do then does it don't do it don't tell me God ain't faithful God is faithful he'll tell you not to do something and then he'll bring you the challenge yeah yes he'll do it and when that child has come you better remember what he said because just as shoes you break the word you're in trouble hmm he gonna make sure you know you in trouble ooh what happened that prophet with the wrong wrong way and guess what a lion came up and devout killed him is that right the lion wouldn't even eat him hello somebody the lion would not eat eat eat the prophet cuz God wanted to show what disobedience would give you I'll let the devil come by and kill you and I'll let you lay there dead so other people can see that you're spiritually dead hello I don't know no no not consumed you remember sister so-and-so how she used to worship the Lord she don't do that no more remember brother so-and-so how faithful he used to be oh they don't do that no more what happened they've done something somewhere they've gotten from under the blood because as long as you under the blood Satan came do you no harm but the moment you step out from under the blood is that right brother man said he cannot come in to you you have to go out to meet him whoo hallelujah glory to God see yes we have been created and I believe this I believe this with all my heart that I have been created to be bride I have always gotten in trouble with preachers because I just don't put up with that nonsense y'all don't see how Hollywood has actually gotten into the message Hollywood is bad sometimes you go to church service and the women looked like they dressed like they going to a ball who somebody help me ain't nothing wrong with being beautiful but God said be careful for glamour oh Jesus and everybody's scared to say something except when they gossip in but they ain't gonna tell the person Oh sister you know I love you oh brother I love you don't do that don't do no no no they go say did you see have you noticed and that's the wrong way to spread it you understand me see we've got so many who impersonates so many Christians and you don't even realizing realizing that you are impersonating Christianity see without the Holy Ghost you still impersonate it you're just pretending to have it and you don't yellow I hope this is okay because if it's not I'm still gonna preach it because I want you to realize this morning that what we're following is serious it's not a church this is not about being chachi it's about being saved we come to the house for correction and a lot of people don't like this kind of preaching but we must this is the house of judgment judgment first cars at the house of God it must start here why because God want to see us repent he want us to see us change God is not here to send us to hell God don't send you to him you your choices sin you there people that used to be on fire think about now his worldly things and you don't even realize that Satan has snared you and the whole point behind him snaring you is to drag your soul into the hell is true hmm y'all heard me say this before I think you know how a lion or hyena allow you to grab something right especially especially a leopard a leopard I catch you and grab you and then he drag you and you know what he's doing he's dragging you home for dinner he's gonna devour you and if he doesn't devalue then he's gonna put you up in a tree for a later date you understand me and you and I must understand those things represents demonic powers and these demonic powers are after what you and I you and me is that right is that right program said it like that he said he said listen we had a time he said the lid is off of hell the lid he said demons are poor into this dimension hey somebody help me here that's why you having the babbles that you have now but I'm gonna tell you something the only way you're going to escape this dimension is to be Toby Oh big heart hey somebody help me here whoo hallelujah impersonating Christianity said your life will prove what you are by their fruits you shall know it and if you're trying to make yourself act sweet and humble and so forth then you are still outside the kingdom it's your own works then and that's where the church the people so-called the church have so miserably failed because it is in their own personal work that they feel that they merit the goodness and the grace of God by what they do and how they live but that has not one thing to do with it it is a gift of God you're old cautious to shine from you from hell and try to make you see or you would shine from hell rather we tried to make you live good and write your own conscious will try to make you live good and right a good citizen will do that and not necessarily be a Christian I've seen many men who even denied the name of the Lord Jesus were five people that means human human li look how much better man Esau was then and Jacob but he didn't have the conception to know that he had sold his birthright huh he did it and didn't even know he did it he had no conception he just saw the greatest thing ever what will you sell it for a new car a new house a new girlfriend a new boyfriend what are you selling it for you don't even know you may even be doing this amen and it could have been your life you just don't know because the devil is so deceitful he'll make you think you're right when your own did you know that I think it's in Jeremiah when when the people of God kept worshiping idols God said I'm gonna let that I don't become a liar and a snare to them they're going to worship that Idol and believe that's God and that's what happens if you're not careful you'll be worshiping the devil and don't even know it hallelujah is that Alright you said we're brother books I don't care what you say let me tell you something it is a known fact by way of the Prophet he said he said the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair and took upon them wise did you know that and you know what brother and say God never forgave them they were lost in the flood hello oh yeah you say what what do you mean I'm saying you guys going out there for them serpent chicks that we call them serpent chicks serpent chicks no serpent chicks don't even have feathers no more nothing to cover them they got religion Oh somebody help me here all churches have religion they cover themselves religion all come on somebody you seem naked smoking cigarettes and still saying praise the Lord and you'll go for that and you fail to see by God's grace he doesn't warn you of it and don't get mad at God when you get hooked because I'm going to tell you something the fish don't go for the hook he goes for the bait but when he goes for the bait he catches the hook and guess what there's an adversary on the end of that line look how much better Esau was with than Jacob you know how is that all right and don't make no difference Jake you're nice all had the same mama mama can't save you daddy can't save you nobody can save you but you but he didn't have the conception to know that that that he had sold his birthright he despised them and was rejected in the sight of God which was far more of a gentleman and a neighbor a man of works then what Jacob was Jacob men shy stir he was a shyster he was he was a god at thee he knows how to steal from you yet he was the one God used see II think the ones that always looked like they got it all together you and I must understand you must know who you are and let me tell you something just like I was telling a friend of mine the other day he goes to a denominational Church because I and I know he thinks I am just fanatical he thinks I'm in a cult and I told him the other day I said let me tell you something I'm not in no cult I say you know the difference between me and others I said I love God and I try to keep his word hello I said I don't care what it looked like and I gave him the scenario that the prophet of God talked about you gonna he said this man needed somebody to drive for him right and he was asking them questions if you're gonna take me up this mountain basically how you gonna drive up there in other words are you gonna ride on the curb are you gonna ride on the exit on the edge of it I told him I said you know what I'm the man that drives next to the curb I don't care how fanatical I look I really don't care people like me or they don't I'm beyond that my interest is getting to heaven in one piece absolutely and until you young people let me tell you you you you you oh now brother books you yeah you're supposed to serve God when you get old I was young God started dealing with me at the age of 12 probably beyond that I didn't know it was called at the time hallelujah I got baptized in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost at the age of 12 and it was the first time I heard the voice of God but I don't care what people you didn't hear the voice of God well you weren't there how would you know but I did and that same voice when I got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because when I got baptized at the age of 12 he said what is the name I'm a Baptist boy didn't know nothing about the Bible but I knew Jesus Christ was God hallelujah I knew that how did I know that he revealed that to me and when I heard that time he said what is the name I went from that time on every time I heard about Jesus and I kept hearing that voice what is the name what is the name and I sang unconverted Li I was on a gospel group coming on on television every week that's why I tried to tell you because somebody's saying gospel don't mean that they converted we were seeing gospel songs every Friday night we were there at the studio rehearsing for Sunday and afterwards we went to the club it was called the Fountainbleu y'all hear what I'm saying y'all understand me getting drunk right afterwards oh come on somebody did you know that those gospel groups would almost sometimes fight each other trying to steal each other song member oh yeah I saw it I was there I was a witness but they still saying thank God that I'm saying you understand me and if it happened then I wonder how many people in this message doing the same thing oh don't tell me people don't drink I know better hmm when the deep of the work the depth of the word is being coming forth they shouting and dancing like they got it all together but God is the all-seeing eye hmm you ain't getting the way God sees it all hallelujah he hear your very thoughts right now somebody help me here see I want you to understand that you and I the bride he chooses you because of your character is that right remember the little ranches story remember the rancher story he chose that girl because of her character she was different from all the other girls and if that story be true which I know it is God is gonna only choose you because of your character he is not going to tell you to be don't be unequally yoked and then he's going to unequally yoked himself it ain't gonna be so who is this okay here's he chooses a bride and that bride must reflect him it must reflect his character is that right the bobbies they were first called Christians at Antioch not because of the way they dressed it was because of the way of their character they walk like him they talk like him they act like him signs and wonders followed them just like they did Jesus Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he does not change not going to be too much longer but what I've tried to say is this it's something that must be born into and that is what what the domination ilysm has done to us remember even the prophet of God said to - to our jeffersonville Branham Cavanaugh Co the Philistines are upon you what was he saying the intellectuals are moving in you're getting called you don't even love the experience anymore listen to your tapes everybody won't service everybody won't service they don't mind the clap they don't mind the singing all my the women gifts are being is supposed to be operating God suppose be moving in the service where are they is the people are not sincere like they used to be it's the truth it's not that God's Word has failed we failed God word yeah I don't understand and no you must in order to enter the gate Peter call it an entrance that have been ministered unto you an entrance and you know what he describes the statue of a perfect man he basically tells you these virtues this character must be in you and guess what you can't even add it to yourself you know the Prophet God said it's victory you've got to go through some battles to get there guarding one say oh here's some brotherly kindness no you gotta ask for it and then when he gives it to you he's got to make sure it's been sealed did you know that every level of victory must be sealed God just don't let it go all the way up to the top and then seal it no sign every every level must be sealed and you're going to be tried and tested you know where we fail many of us patience and gotta put you in a panic put you in a mode of panic he don't put you in the mo but he'll let something happen to you and you get into this place of panic and then God done told you don't be anxious for nothing yeah but somehow you allowed yourself to slip why because there's a leakage there's not a complete seal their God is rattling your box mm-hmm see what people don't understand I don't care how people in this message have actually made a mockery of things and made things look bad you know they take doctrinal issues and they pervert them you know but we cannot be afraid of the truth the truth is the character of Christ must be formed in us and when are we going to have that done you think right at the moment when God said come on up hither you're gonna all Doce and go whoo I got it all it's not going to happen read the scripture read these great men of God look at Joseph how long it took for God to get him into a place where he was ready to sit on the right hand of the king it didn't happen overnight he had to suffer he suffered by his church brothers a lot of people when I ain't gone back to that church because they have been dissing that and they don't them you know I know people judge me my point is as long as I know I'm in the will of God nobody else starts matters hello when I know I'm in the will of God I'm gonna say that again nobody else's thoughts matter ourself for the rejection I'll suffer the persecution whatever I must go through I will go through see I'm determining by God's grace now it's not him that women thought he that run it but God who shows mercy I'm talking about the mercy of God that have actually put this in me to make a rapture if nobody else makes one hallelujah and that ought to be exactly your earnest desires I'm gonna make it if nobody else is that right Oh cuz come on the pressure is coming is that right and the Prophet God described that pressure as a darkness that was so dark you wouldn't be able to see your hand in front of you remember little sister he he types that out little sister don't be afraid there's a man here who can turn on the lights but he said it was going to be so dark you see that wasn't just something that happened and he didn't just throw that in he was trying to tell the bride of Jesus Christ there's a great darkness coming and this dark heavy y'all have you ever been anywhere that's really dark it produces fear but the Bible says perfect love casts out fear why weren't the little boy afraid the little boy wasn't afraid because he knew there was a man he knew the man that cut the light off can cut it back on hallelujah and that's how do with the believer we are not afraid because no matter how dark and how difficult our trials come we know at some point in time God knows how to cut the light on I'm almost done I love the people of God and I know people may not understand but I'm pressing like Paul says I'm pressing toward the mark of a high calling which is in Christ in Christ and I know that the only way I'm gonna make heaven is that those virtues are living in me living virtues living characteristic expressed that means is being expressed that's the only way I can make it there I'm sorry some of us didn't come at the early age you know emphasis or Smyrna we've come in the most difficult age which is Laodicea where people who are Christians can't discern the Spirit of God from witchcraft or from mediums they can't discern the difference oh I could tell you something now I except a well-known preacher I was in I was in Brazil and I could catch that was something wrong with this preacher spirit now I'm not going to call no names but this preacher could see that there was something different about me too and he just kept trying to get my attention so we were sitting down there on the pulpit and he was sitting in front of me and this man turned and he looked at me and his eyes was as red as that chair and I think this man thought he was gonna put fear in me tacky but when he saw I wasn't afraid because I called his ire and I let look at him like okay what's next I Know Who I serve people I know I don't I don't go places without God first then he turned back around and then he turned again to let me see is why I they turn back white yeah I'm like you know what and this man is a pastor picture and he's packing something that's not of God because you know why I say that because God will not interject fear this man was trying to make me fear him I wouldn't care if his eyes were to turn green or purple you understand me I don't experience facing demons it doesn't matter when you know God is with you my first time experiencing demonic possessed person crawling and you know and making snake sound and bird sounds and everything that's my first time experiencing that guess what I was heard I was so scared and all I could do was stand like this like Lord whatever that is please don't let it get me I'm laughing now but it wasn't 11 I wanted to run but there was no way I could but it was I was a young Christian right but then I saw God by the name of Jesus Christ cast that devil out so no matter how much they try to brush you the name of Jesus still watch it still works I'm almost gonna keep saying it but I just don't we must understand we're right at the end time y'all don't believe that huh don't you know that all the countries everybody is so unstable America used to be a country of stability where people can look over there and says hey we know where we like a friend of mine said last night we know where we can get some help now America needs some help we can't give help we need help and the whole world is falling apart people people people visit exactly the way the Bible said Bible said it would be marrying giving in marriage violence all over people killing their own children and without the Holy Ghost you don't know what you going to do that's the truth the Holy Ghost is the only thing that keeps us saying brother Branham said it like this is that the bride will be the only people who are saying everybody else will go insane and don't tell me you're not having mind battles like that the devil says oh boy you keep going you're going to lose your mind don't ever repeat that endeavor when he tells you oh you getting me I'm getting ready to go crazy don't you dare say that whenever you repeat those kind of thoughts you're opening up a door for him you have to say you are a liar I know you're not God you might I cannot lose my mind see don't ever let the devil push you up to this to start speaking negative things about yourself no sir the devil said you know you ain't gonna make it you don't ever say Who I ain't gonna make it you just have to say you right there are you not gonna make it you turn it right back on them you right you're not gonna make it I know where you going Oh Lord is too much but let me yeah in closing let me let me ask you a question because this Bible is full of character characteristics you're in here shaluinn type you're in here whether it be good or evil you're in here this Bible covers good and evil and you either good or you evil or you had a place like Jacob you hadn't flipped yet but you in here is that right you're either one like Eve and Eve amen was deceived she GGG she knew the word she quoted it but she let the devil smooth word promised her something and she went for the promise see you say well that's not well what was Elvis Elvis was like Eve he knew the word and he went out for the promise I give you a fleet of Cadillacs I'll make you rich I'll make you famous and she sold out for that hmm or you can be like Mary be it unto me according to your word I don't need an education to understand this message Oh somebody help me here I don't need the doctors of divinity to define what this angel just said he said what he meant any meant what he said be it unto me see I can't do nothing about it but you're the Creator be it unto me according to your word in other words you're giving God permission to do what's necessary to bring forth the Christ child hallelujah or you can be like Jezebel don't you know that even the world know the name Jezebel is bad do y'all know anybody in the world by the name of Jezebel and when somebody's called you as a bill they don't like it too well right because that's not a name or a character when I say Jezebel you're not thinking about a virgin Jezebel your mind go to one place you understand me that's what names and characters do then you can be a Rahab how many wanna be your hair oh come on you and I most of us were raised in Fame that right we were just that way but we heard this message and this is what I love about Rahab because not only did God give her her salvation but he also saved her household hallelujah it never mentions who they were because the promise was given to Rahab and Rahab promise was dill and whatever she stayed true to the word that's what I'm saying if you are a rehab stay true to the word and God will save your household whoo you can be like Mary at Simon's house I'll tell you what we don't have too many Mary's but we got a few in here you know Minoo one of our Mary's went home a rich rich brother rich had a Mary she'd be on that front row pulling and you could tell when she wasn't here hello but she didn't mind worshiping the Lord and God took her home that's all right she's still slinging that hair up there oh come on somebody worried about Mary at Simon's house can I say like this she went to church and she didn't care how her makeup messed up she went to sign was out and she didn't care of whether she snotted or anything else forgive me but that's the truth she didn't care she wept and she served the Lord and everybody else was what oh you know what they were doing watching her and she could care less how focus was not on the people her focus was on Jesus Christ alone and every one of us had come in this house with our focus on Jesus Christ and I don't care if not a percent of the church is not moving you ought to be worshiping God you ought to be throwing your hands up and saying thank you Jesus is that right you got to show God how much you love him is that right she didn't even have to say nothing he said what you want I love that see you can worship God in such a way and you never have to ask him for anything he'll ask you knowing what your answer is y'all tell me what y'all got all these kind of bills y'all can fix this and came fix that you start worshipping in God God start dropping that dropping some some some dollars in the pocket I know what I'm talking about hmm but you get into old Lord how I'm gonna pay that bill and how I'm gonna do this and the devil and rod you rob you of your prayer then rob you of your worship you come to church and you can't worship God and now you go back empty just like you came but when you worship God under those circumstances he said look at the devil I'll let you do this to them and they still love me they still worship me you become a job I've taken things from them and they still worship me that's what God was he won't worshipers under whatever the circumstance I'm a wash of God hallelujah and you know what happens it just makes him fall deeper in love how you say that in French deeper in love how you say deeper in love la more poor fall all right Allah more powerful deep hallelujah y'all understand me I'm a booster you can be you know one thing I love about self the Bible said when self was born when Seth was born men began to praise God you hear that the Bible said when self that means his life affected other men it wasn't just about him his life made others praise God up to that point they were not and let me say it like this God puts us in did I say that right or wrong God puts us in a position so that we can affect everybody else y'all heard what I was saying and I'm not finished with that you know I was working you know how that you know in this dimension we affect what whatever we do here affects the other that mentioned as well did y'all know that Amen is we must understand that we are still connected I came from God and I go back to God right I stand here and my theophany stands there right and whatever I'm doing is affecting him and sometimes he affects me hmm so you got to understand that that if we're setting in heavenly places however we are responding here we are responding there if you're living bad here that means somewhere you're not there or you can be at a half they have was a compromiser whatever Church did whatever Church say the church was the boss God is the boss that Stan I'm gonna read this one scripture coming from Ephesians two and ten for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works created in Christ in Christ there's no darkness and as long as you allow the world to pull you into this lust there this lust thing that they got you just hindering your walk and your growth in Christ just like you you've heard me say whatever bait you use to go fishing it's the kind of fish you're going to catch and if you go looking for catfish are those fish that's days on the bottom eating mud and everything else there's a certain kind of bait you use and that's what you don't catch a real godly man want a real godly woman and if you engage yourself because of lust yellow it will not last especially if love never takes over so by God's grace I want to say this we must understand that God never lust after you there are no fleshly desires the only thing that God sees and wants to see is character he wants to see himself reflected through us those are the currents of things that makes God happy for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them it is ordained of God that we should walk there one thing for certain I can't make you repent now brother Branham said he said you know what it's the altar call we all come on come on come on he said he never believed in it like that because it just brought too many up that means almost everybody that came up she didn't come up because really they were sincere and ready anyway they were coerced by me a real altar call he says no we're in the Bible he said but you know I'm not against it but you know where the altar call should be on your heart repentance come from here and the only way you gonna meet God is that God give you the grace to know how to repent feeling sorry is not repentance feeling sorry may be the beginning of it but it's when God has a hold of your heart that you're doing any and everything you just want to change you don't want to do it no more brother Branham lied at one time and he said I had to go to my cave cave and he said I prayed all day to God and I prayed Lord whatever you do don't let me do that again and he said until that thing lifted he stayed there until it yeah hello and he never did it again that's what you do you pray until it - you do it it leaves and you never do it again let's pray father we come before you we thank you for your grace in your mercy we thank you for being so good to us Lord you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves and Lord we're pressing Lord we're moving forward Lord and even though Satan has tried to hinder us him stopped us from reaching our goal we know Lord God there is no way that he can stop us we realize father that you have predestinated us unto these good works and Lord we are happy and excited because we know that every dark spot everything that's not right with you you will take care of them Lord because we're giving everything to you we're surrendering our whole life we're surrendering our mind our body and our soul we're surrendering everything Lord totally totally Lord and father I pray that you let your word have preeminence in my life let it be soar let it be Lord we have nothing else to live for other than to live for you bless your people here this morning may the Word of God go down deep in their souls may they see Lord God that you mean what you say and you say what you mean that none of us stands in a place where we cannot be rejected because Paul said I must be careful that I might become a castaway but all that he had done he knew not to take your love for granted and your grace for granted help us Lord bless us now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen pictures and photographs memories of old stories of every kind that have never yet been told and there's a picture in my kitchen that displays the supper see a picture that's been hanging there until now I had never seen how can he desire to have fearless with there must be something more within that only he gets I pray need your love please take the life I gave it all to me read it every day you come with [Music] overall - he made us walk that way as they reach their destination the

actually met the challenge ephesus faith you don't go all the way up each a smyrna now we're in the age we call the product is up to seven but at least we ought to see some brotherly kindness where's the brotherly kindness we've got to get to love we've got to have divine love where's the brother the kite you see them say where's the patience if God should take a rapture then how many of us are cool that's all I'm trying to get to I'm trying to get you to see that we spent too much time with all of these distractions and and we're worried about this world that's what the Bible said the cares of this world would choke that life we're so concerned it's nothing wrong with prospering but God said outward that you prosper even as your soul your soul prospers and all the other things that's what Jesus said Jesus says you can have all these things seek ye first the kingdom of God is righteousness and all these other things not seek the world first and in it and the righteous to God no God must come first and that's all we're trying to get us to see don't let us don't let the enemy deceive us the devil don't care how long you've been in this message if he can keep far [Music] the expression of the character comprised in you he's gonna do it he's gonna do it he'll let you go to church for 90 years live for 90 years help us laugh so quite [Music] yes [Music] Oh in closing saw
