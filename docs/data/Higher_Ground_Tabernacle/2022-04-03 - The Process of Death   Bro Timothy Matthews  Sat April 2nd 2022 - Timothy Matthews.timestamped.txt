[11:29] thank you amen
[11:30] god bless you all
[11:32] i wanted to share this um
[11:35] small
[11:36] song that i wrote
[11:38] um
[11:39] i believe this song was
[11:41] really an answer to a prayer i've been
[11:43] praying because i've been going through
[11:45] a lot
[11:46] these days and
[11:49] i just want you to notice that
[11:51] the key word in the song is the word
[11:54] restoration
[11:55] if you type or choices in google the
[11:58] word restoration is the action of
[12:01] returning something to a former honor
[12:04] place or condition
[12:06] so i believe
[12:08] that this song will be a blessing
[12:11] [Music]
[12:32] from eternity
[12:37] down to this lonely earth
[12:40] we've gone from the glory
[12:44] to be tested and tried out
[12:48] we never tries to bring despair we must
[12:53] go to our knees
[12:56] for the wings of a dove it will restore
[13:01] everything that's been destroyed
[13:04] that's why i believe
[13:08] and i received
[13:12] for the
[13:13] restoration is raining

[36:39] the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of
[36:41] the jews the same came to jesus by night
[36:44] and said unto him rabbi we know that
[36:46] thou art a teacher come from god for no
[36:48] man can do these miracles that thou
[36:50] doest except god be with him jesus
[36:53] answered and said unto him verily verily
[36:55] i say unto thee except a man be born
[36:58] again he cannot see the kingdom of god
[37:00] the word see there means to understand
[37:03] nicodemus saith unto him how can a man
[37:05] be born when he is old can he enter the
[37:07] second time into his mother's womb and
[37:09] be born jesus answered verily verily i
[37:12] say unto thee except a man be born of
[37:14] water and of the spirit he cannot enter
[37:16] into the kingdom of god
[37:18] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[37:20] and that which is born of the spirit is
[37:22] spirit
[37:23] marvel not that i said unto thee he must
[37:26] be born again
[37:28] brother
[37:29] we know that's jesus's first doctrine
[37:31] there it's one of the most important
[37:33] things maybe the most important thing in
[37:35] your christian walk is to be born again
[37:40] uh second corinthians chapter 5 verse 17
[37:46] another
[37:46] scripture we should all be familiar with
[37:48] here this
[37:49] afternoon
[37:59] second corinthians 5 17 reads this way
[38:02] therefore if any man
[38:06] be in christ
[38:08] he is a new
[38:09] creature or new creation
[38:12] old things are passed away
[38:15] and behold all things are become new
[38:20] last scripture in the book of acts
[38:22] chapter 2
[38:24] one of my favorite portions of scripture
[38:31] acts two we'll read verses one through
[38:32] four
[38:40] we know that the disciples walked with
[38:42] jesus for three and a half years there
[38:45] and saw the miracles and heard the great
[38:48] messages that were preached and the
[38:50] things that were said
[38:51] it's all the great events of god
[38:54] and yet jesus telling peter
[38:56] before pentecost when you are converted
[39:00] go strengthen your brethren
[39:02] we know they were not converted truly
[39:04] until they received the baptism of the
[39:06] holy ghost
[39:10] and when the day of pentecost was fully
[39:13] come
[39:14] they were all with one accord in one
[39:16] place
[39:18] and suddenly there came a sound from
[39:20] heaven
[39:21] of a rushing mighty wind and it filled
[39:24] all the house
[39:26] where they were sitting and there
[39:28] appeared unto them cloven tongues like
[39:30] as a fire and it sat upon each of them
[39:33] aren't you glad the holy ghost don't
[39:34] miss one person
[39:36] and they were all filled with the holy
[39:38] ghost and began to speak with other
[39:41] tongues as the spirit gave them
[39:43] utterance thank you for your patience
[39:45] and the word you may be seated
[39:49] hallelujah
[39:52] all right
[39:53] brother i'm just going to take off my
[39:54] jacket here
[40:00] all right
[40:04] i'd like to speak to you and of course
[40:06] i'm addressing mainly the young people
[40:08] this
[40:10] this afternoon
[40:12] i preach
[40:13] along these lines on pentecost and the
[40:15] holy ghost and the new birth
[40:18] sometime back and
[40:21] at a certain church and i won't name it
[40:23] and
[40:25] you would be shocked brother sister the
[40:27] amount of deacons
[40:29] and ministers that came up
[40:32] to receive
[40:33] the holy ghost
[40:36] but i don't believe you even and of
[40:38] course brother branham teaches it
[40:39] plainly and i believe
[40:42] every
[40:42] real christian should stand by this but
[40:44] you're not even allowed to stand behind
[40:46] a pulpit and minister the word of god
[40:48] unless you first had an experience with
[40:49] the pillar of
[40:50] fire and uh had deacons and and
[40:53] ministers coming up and never received
[40:55] the holy ghost brother this isn't even
[40:57] taught
[40:58] in most churches
[41:00] that this
[41:01] not the right way it's might be
[41:03] mentioned or
[41:04] or a phrase here about it or there was
[41:06] not even taught
[41:08] uh the way that this message brings out
[41:11] a new verse i'd like to speak to you
[41:12] this afternoon on the process of death
[41:20] believe the young people need to be
[41:21] encouraged i believe
[41:22] young people need to
[41:24] uh
[41:25] know how to fight and this and that but
[41:27] brother sister i believe a lot of
[41:29] things that come up in our lives and a
[41:31] lot of questions and problems could all
[41:34] be literally thrown right out the window
[41:36] if we just get born again a lot of the
[41:38] same things that we deal with over and
[41:40] over and over again another way i hear a
[41:43] lot of times people preach messages to
[41:45] the young people and they encourage them
[41:46] and they say almost like a pep rally of
[41:48] some sort and they get excited and then
[41:50] but brother just get the holy ghost and
[41:52] then you walk out with more victory than
[41:54] you had if you listen to a thousand pep
[41:56] rallies that week
[41:57] but you walk out with the holy ghost you
[41:59] have victory that lasts the rest of your
[42:00] life here on this earth
[42:04] so i'm going to preach on the process of
[42:06] death i have a little note here in the
[42:07] message why preaching in 1962 brother
[42:10] branham called the new birth a glorious
[42:12] mess
[42:13] he said the new birth brings a mess but
[42:15] it brings new life with it
[42:17] it's a mess but it's a glorious mess it
[42:20] brings new life
[42:23] the new birth experience brother sister
[42:25] is is is just that it's an experience
[42:28] it's not just shaking hands it's not
[42:29] just a good feeling it's not because you
[42:31] have a position in the church it's not
[42:33] because you're well good friends with
[42:35] the pastor
[42:38] it has nothing to do with any of that
[42:39] it's an experience with a living god
[42:41] making himself real to you i was
[42:43] preaching at the home church on
[42:44] wednesday
[42:45] brother brenham said the new birth was a
[42:47] revelation
[42:49] brother unless you have an experience
[42:51] god cannot reveal himself to you you
[42:54] must have an experience where god
[42:56] reveals himself to you and you know yet
[42:59] you're born again not because you had a
[43:01] good feeling run down your spine or
[43:03] because that you have a good friendship
[43:04] with the pastor or because that you have
[43:06] a position in the church but you know
[43:09] that you are born again by a revelation
[43:12] that god has revealed himself to you
[43:18] excuse me
[43:19] now
[43:20] uh this experience now i'm going to
[43:23] preach to you the prophets
[43:25] version
[43:27] of a new birth which is really the
[43:29] bible's version of a new birth
[43:32] and uh many people they have their
[43:34] pastors version their parents version
[43:36] their self-designed version they have
[43:38] satan's substitute but i want to ask you
[43:40] this afternoon does your experience
[43:42] match the bible
[43:44] does your experience match the word of
[43:46] god for this hour
[43:49] there's three main words that are
[43:51] associated that brother branham
[43:52] associated with the new birth the number
[43:54] one is mess
[43:56] the next word is change
[43:58] and the third word is death
[44:01] all those things must take place in
[44:02] order for there to be a birth and i want
[44:04] to tell you this afternoon that god will
[44:06] not fill a dirty vessel
[44:08] he will not fail you with the holy ghost
[44:10] and you've got to unconfess sin in your
[44:11] life
[44:14] all right this is where
[44:16] i got the title my message you must be
[44:18] born again preached in 1961 brother adam
[44:20] says yes to be born again you must go
[44:23] through a process of death that's right
[44:26] everything does
[44:28] well we know that a birth is is it takes
[44:30] three parts is that right water blood
[44:32] spirit justification sanctification and
[44:34] a baptism of the holy ghost
[44:37] amen you take a grain of corn if that
[44:38] corn ever accept expects to live again
[44:41] it's got to die first
[44:43] you got to die first you got to die die
[44:46] how to yourself die to everything so
[44:49] that you can be born again you've got to
[44:52] do that if you don't die you can't never
[44:55] live again
[44:57] brother people wanting to receive the
[44:58] holy ghost but never die to themselves
[45:00] they want to go on praising god but
[45:02] never have died to themselves and then
[45:04] they keep getting scrupled up in life
[45:06] they keep getting into this mess and the
[45:08] same going around around the same
[45:10] battles over and over again because they
[45:11] never died out to that old man brother
[45:14] branham actually he talked to sidney
[45:16] jackson he said he said when you receive
[45:18] the holy ghost he said it comes through
[45:20] he says it burns out the old man he said
[45:23] it goes from a place of dominion over
[45:25] your life he said it stands behind you
[45:28] at a place of influence brother that old
[45:31] man just don't go away it stands behind
[45:33] you trying to influence you to keep
[45:35] doing the same old things that you used
[45:38] to do and yet i got a holy ghost that's
[45:40] now inside of me that has dominion over
[45:43] that old man that can absolutely combat
[45:46] that old man that old nature that's
[45:49] trying to get me to do and go back to my
[45:51] old ways so we got to die to ourselves
[45:54] there has to be a process of death and
[45:56] that is what people do not want to do
[45:58] brother sisters they don't want to die
[46:02] that old man's got to die in order for
[46:04] you to live again now spiritually you're
[46:07] either going to die to your flesh or
[46:08] your soul is going to die but you got to
[46:10] die at some point
[46:12] brother if i died in my flesh now and my
[46:14] soul is resurrected into new life and
[46:17] eternal eternity becomes uh something
[46:19] that is now a part of me my i could
[46:22] never die
[46:24] but if i want to hold on to my old ways
[46:27] and my own life and my old tendencies
[46:29] then i can die now
[46:31] and i'm going to die in the flesh and
[46:33] i'm going to rot
[46:34] in the grave with no
[46:36] no hopes for eternal life
[46:39] so you're going to die at some point i'd
[46:41] rather die to myself now
[46:45] see the soul that sinneth that soul
[46:47] shall die
[46:48] you know when you take a this is from be
[46:50] not afraid 961 is one of my favorite
[46:52] quotes when you know when you know when
[46:55] you take a notion to meet jesus he will
[46:57] make you do some of the silliest things
[47:04] this ain't no catholic
[47:09] he'll make you do some of the silliest
[47:10] things
[47:13] he will just ruin all your prestige
[47:16] you think you won't squall and cry and
[47:19] boo hoo
[47:21] but you will if you want to see him
[47:25] brother anybody ever got desperate to
[47:27] see the lord
[47:28] you'll just do anything to see him
[47:32] blind bartimaeus he was able to scream
[47:34] and shout until he got god's attention
[47:37] there were many people willing to do a
[47:38] lot of things to get god's attention
[47:40] what are you willing to do this
[47:42] afternoon to get god's attention
[47:45] amen
[47:46] you will do anything to see him now he
[47:50] said you'll make you do some of the
[47:51] silliest things silly is having or
[47:54] showing a lack of common sense or
[47:56] judgment
[47:58] absurd and foolish
[48:00] it's used to convey that an activity or
[48:02] process has been engaged in to such a
[48:05] degree that someone is no longer capable
[48:08] of thinking or acting sensibly
[48:11] he'll make you act unsensibly in fact
[48:14] brother madam said that when the
[48:16] anointing comes and that revelation that
[48:18] stimulation he said it'll make a person
[48:20] act unseemingly
[48:23] it'll make them act different it'll make
[48:25] you do things you didn't think you would
[48:27] do
[48:28] it'll take the quietest person the next
[48:30] you know they're the loudest person in
[48:32] the church why they caught fire on the
[48:34] inside
[48:37] change that old nature those old
[48:39] tendencies to be quiet and shy
[48:41] brother bradham actually said that when
[48:43] they came out of the upper room he said
[48:45] when they went in they was afraid it's
[48:47] what he said he said when they went in
[48:49] they were they were embarrassed they
[48:51] were ashamed they were afraid they were
[48:53] fearful for their lives jesus never did
[48:55] tell him to go into an upper room jesus
[48:57] said go wait in the city of jerusalem
[48:59] but they got scared went up into an
[49:01] upper room shut the doors closed the
[49:03] shutters and everything else and while
[49:04] they was in there brother adam said they
[49:06] were fussing still fighting they were
[49:08] trying to get in one accord he said all
[49:10] of a sudden they got in one accord and
[49:12] the holy ghost came into those people he
[49:14] said all of a sudden they went from
[49:16] being shy and shameful and fearful they
[49:19] went to being bold brother adam said the
[49:21] courage of the lion of the tribe of
[49:23] judah came into the people
[49:27] and out into the streets they went
[49:28] stumbling and acting like they was drunk
[49:30] people speaking in tongues
[49:32] that's right that's right
[49:35] see
[49:37] palmer worm locust cankerworm
[49:38] caterpillar 59 there is no place in the
[49:41] bible i want you to notice this there is
[49:43] no place in the bible where that they
[49:45] ever receive the holy ghost without
[49:47] having emotions speaking with tongues
[49:49] and shoutings and praises of god and
[49:51] prophecies and manifestations
[49:55] no not there's not one place in the
[49:56] bible where they ever just shook hands
[49:59] or felt the nice feeling go down their
[50:01] spine
[50:04] or they were in the church for 30 years
[50:05] so somehow that means they got it
[50:09] there's no place where they ever receive
[50:10] the holy ghost without having emotions
[50:13] speaking with tongues and shoutings and
[50:15] praises of god and prophecies and
[50:17] manifestations
[50:19] a deceived church by the world 59 and a
[50:21] man or woman can never have new birth
[50:24] until their intellectuals and their own
[50:26] self is rotten
[50:28] dead
[50:29] die out at the altar
[50:32] and scream
[50:34] get all messed up
[50:38] to a place that the starch gets out of
[50:41] your collar and you are born again by
[50:43] the spirit of god
[50:45] i don't care if you squall
[50:47] speak in tongues jump up and down flop
[50:50] like a chicken with its head cut off you
[50:52] are bringing forth
[50:54] new life brother brad i'm saying i don't
[50:57] care what you do i don't care if you
[50:59] flop roll flip over i don't care what
[51:02] you do but if you're bringing forth new
[51:03] life i don't care what i have to do to
[51:06] get it as long as i can get it
[51:12] but you have to go through a process of
[51:13] death
[51:18] the new bird don't matter how messy it
[51:20] looks
[51:22] brother i remember
[51:24] years ago we was having a camp meeting
[51:26] and
[51:27] the way it just the whole altar was just
[51:29] i mean there was more it was so packed
[51:31] it was just the whole thing was filled
[51:33] almost halfway down the church with
[51:36] young people
[51:37] and
[51:38] i looked down
[51:40] and there was a sister that had been
[51:42] crying and snotting the way that brother
[51:44] branham describes here and when she
[51:46] looked up her hair was matted to her
[51:49] face
[51:50] she had tears coming down she had snot
[51:52] coming this way and she just didn't care
[51:56] because god was dealing with her brother
[51:58] when god begins to deal with you you
[52:01] lose sight of everything else around you
[52:03] you forget where you are you forget who
[52:05] you are
[52:07] and you find yourself in christ brother
[52:09] sister
[52:10] this is why people never find their
[52:11] purpose this is why people are unhappy
[52:13] in life is because they never find out
[52:15] who they are in christ
[52:20] no matter how messy it looks how much
[52:22] you have to bawl and squall and carry on
[52:24] at the altar or whatever you have to do
[52:27] how many this afternoon would say i'm
[52:30] willing to do whatever i have to do
[52:33] to get christ on the inside of this
[52:35] earthen vessel
[52:39] brahmana says all the unnecessary
[52:42] things
[52:44] that you think you wouldn't do it'll
[52:46] make you do it
[52:48] all the things you think are unnecessary
[52:51] all the things that people leave church
[52:52] over well if i have to do that i just
[52:54] ain't gonna do it that way so i'll go
[52:56] somewhere else or do something else
[52:59] all the unnecessary things that you
[53:01] think you wouldn't do it'll make you do
[53:04] it the word unnecessary means not needed
[53:08] it's not needed
[53:10] this is the way that the people teach
[53:12] the new birth today brother sister it's
[53:13] not even needed
[53:18] brother it's a necessity
[53:23] god didn't ask our opinion over it
[53:24] either
[53:26] it's not needed that's what unnecessary
[53:28] means not needed it's anonymous with
[53:30] optional
[53:32] it's optional
[53:34] unwanted more than is needed it's excess
[53:38] all those people at the altar screaming
[53:40] and crying bawling boohoo and snotting
[53:42] down their it's unnecessary it's
[53:44] unneeded
[53:46] it's excess it's more than what we need
[53:48] to be doing all that shouting and
[53:50] carrying on all that praising and
[53:51] worshiping god it's more it's more than
[53:54] what's needed
[53:56] since when did god leave it up to you to
[53:58] decide what's needed
[54:02] see it's unnecessary it's not required
[54:05] it's uncalled for
[54:07] see brotherhood says you you have pride
[54:09] and don't want to wash the lipstick off
[54:11] your face some tears might do that for
[54:13] you that's right but it'll make a messy
[54:16] look out of you
[54:18] but you'll come up from there a
[54:19] different person
[54:22] born of the spirit of god a new creature
[54:24] in christ
[54:27] brother i'll tell you that 120 in that
[54:28] upper room it wasn't an upper room
[54:30] anymore it became a birthing room that
[54:32] room became a birthing room brother i
[54:35] tell you today this building it can't
[54:37] even look the same after a while if you
[54:39] ever really get in the spirit and begin
[54:41] to let god get a hold of you this room
[54:44] will turn from just a regular old church
[54:46] room it'll turn into a birthing room for
[54:48] you
[54:53] he wants you
[54:54] god wants you can you imagine we have a
[54:56] god that made heavens earth the sea the
[54:59] land everything that there is on earth
[55:01] amen he's so powerful he's omnipresent
[55:04] omniscient he's all these things and god
[55:06] cares about you
[55:10] he wants you
[55:12] it's an individual
[55:14] and you must be born again and receive
[55:17] the baptism of the holy spirit or you're
[55:19] gone
[55:21] see you're just playing church
[55:25] without receiving the baptism of the
[55:27] holy ghost and being born again you're
[55:29] just playing church
[55:32] that's all you're doing you could play
[55:34] an instrument you can sing specials you
[55:36] can even preach you can do this or that
[55:39] but brother if you've never been born
[55:41] again all you're doing is playing church
[55:44] [Applause]
[55:45] well this ain't an hour to play church
[55:47] have you seen what's going on in the
[55:49] government have you seen what's going on
[55:50] in the world have you seen what's going
[55:52] on in the churches brother this ain't a
[55:54] time to play church this isn't a time to
[55:56] do any of that this is a time to get
[55:58] down to business with god this is a time
[56:00] to check up and see where we're at
[56:08] you're playing church you're just
[56:10] impersonating until you actually have an
[56:12] experience of being born again
[56:16] watch uncertain sound 61 and from the
[56:19] altar of abel came the cry of a lamb
[56:22] everyone remember cain brought it all
[56:24] made an altar abel made an altar
[56:27] they both made an altar but one did
[56:29] something by revelation the other one
[56:30] just did something
[56:32] that was by an old cardinal way of
[56:34] intellectual thinking
[56:36] from the altar of abel came the cry of a
[56:38] lamb there was death to pay the penalty
[56:40] blood was being shed and today when god
[56:43] just like it was in that day when he
[56:45] told cain cain was discouraged he said
[56:47] here's the best i can do
[56:49] brother the best you can do is filthy
[56:51] rags before the lord
[56:53] here's the best i can do you can take it
[56:56] or leave it mark can you imagine
[56:57] somebody's attitude like that with the
[56:59] lord here's the best i can do take it or
[57:01] leave it god
[57:04] do do anything you want to about it but
[57:06] that's all i can do about it that's what
[57:08] people are today brother they're so
[57:09] indifferent about the things of god uh
[57:11] if i feel like worship i will if i don't
[57:13] it's okay
[57:14] if i feel like praying i will if not
[57:16] it's okay if i get into the preaching
[57:19] it's all right but if not it's fine it's
[57:21] okay everything's fine everything's
[57:22] great
[57:23] everything's wonderful
[57:26] got a few dollars in my pocket
[57:29] don't have nothing too crazy going on in
[57:31] my life
[57:33] some people have to hit rock bottom
[57:34] before they finally get down to business
[57:36] with god
[57:37] sad but that's the truth
[57:41] see
[57:42] that was cain's attitude indifferent
[57:43] that's the way the modern christian
[57:45] worships today i go to church i help the
[57:47] preachers i pay my tithing if they got
[57:50] any social party i put my part in it and
[57:52] if they need a missionary offering i
[57:53] help in it that's good but that's not
[57:55] what god requires
[57:58] he's got to hear the sound of death
[58:03] he's got to hear the sound of
[58:06] death bless god what god wants today is
[58:10] you to die die to the things of the
[58:12] world and yourself hear a scream lord
[58:15] take me as i am
[58:17] that's what people don't want to do they
[58:19] don't want to come out of themselves
[58:22] they don't want to go beyond this flesh
[58:24] brother of adam said get out of these
[58:26] three dimensions and get up into the
[58:28] next one where god is
[58:30] this is why we don't get healed this is
[58:32] why we don't get the holy ghost this is
[58:33] why we don't get delivered from our sin
[58:35] this is why we don't break chains during
[58:37] service because we don't get out of
[58:39] these dimensions we're trying to worship
[58:41] god in the flesh we're trying to worship
[58:43] god in our intellectuals you can't
[58:46] worship god that way you got to get out
[58:48] of this place you got to get out of
[58:50] yourself and you got to enter into a
[58:53] realm beyond here
[58:56] that's how you get something from god
[58:58] then let a scream come out lord take me
[59:01] as i am
[59:06] that's what god wants he wants that
[59:07] sound of death
[59:10] that death rattle
[59:14] i hear the sound of dry bones rattling
[59:19] that death rattle
[59:21] of old man adam that's dying
[59:25] you ever seen a calf get branded
[59:27] i have
[59:29] brother that thing will kick and squirm
[59:31] and spit and go all cra
[59:34] but when it's done he knows who is pappy
[59:37] and his ma'am he is
[59:38] he knows who he belongs to
[59:42] well this is why
[59:44] we get
[59:45] these young people
[59:46] they're born
[59:48] into a church like this
[59:50] or somewhere else where there's a good
[59:51] gospel preacher that's preaching solid
[59:54] on the word of god the spirit of god
[59:56] present every service turn 18 leave and
[59:59] act like they never heard a word of it
[1:00:04] they never got this
[1:00:06] they never went through a process of
[1:00:08] death
[1:00:13] he wants to hear that old man die
[1:00:15] he wants to hear the sound of death
[1:00:18] that he might come in and take his place
[1:00:20] and rule you and be your lord
[1:00:23] you know that it's been reported that
[1:00:25] there's been people that have died
[1:00:27] and when they come back they have
[1:00:28] abilities that they didn't have before
[1:00:32] there's people that have died
[1:00:34] and have given testimony they didn't
[1:00:35] even know how to play a piano when they
[1:00:37] died
[1:00:37] came back to life and
[1:00:39] was able to play a piano
[1:00:41] brother you'd be shocked at dying to
[1:00:43] yourself what god will raise you up into
[1:00:46] you'll be shocked after you're done
[1:00:47] dying to yourself and the holy ghost
[1:00:49] fills your life and brings you up in
[1:00:51] newness of life you'll be shocked what
[1:00:53] god could do to you
[1:00:54] hallelujah
[1:00:57] you might have an ability you never had
[1:00:59] before you might start worshiping god
[1:01:01] like you never have before you might
[1:01:03] start witnessing on the street like you
[1:01:05] never have before amen you might be able
[1:01:07] to live it in your school when you go to
[1:01:09] school you might be able to live it at
[1:01:11] your job when you couldn't do it before
[1:01:13] you couldn't bring yourself to do it
[1:01:14] before but now that i've died and i
[1:01:17] resurrected in christ i can do things i
[1:01:19] wasn't able to do before i've been able
[1:01:21] to conquer myself i can conquer myself
[1:01:31] brother sister
[1:01:32] that's what god wants
[1:01:37] people don't bother i've said people
[1:01:38] don't want to get the birthright because
[1:01:40] they think it's a little unpopular
[1:01:43] they don't want to get down at the altar
[1:01:45] and cry a little bit go without a few
[1:01:47] meals something other are you willing to
[1:01:48] go without a few meals to get god does
[1:01:50] it mean that much to you
[1:01:52] i'll skip lunch dinner i'll skip as many
[1:01:55] meals as i got to until i get god
[1:02:01] that's the attitude brother sister
[1:02:02] that's the way to come to god
[1:02:06] but i said i've seen him at billy
[1:02:08] graham's chewing bubble gum walking up
[1:02:09] to line
[1:02:11] go back sit down until you're ready to
[1:02:12] be dead
[1:02:15] they think it's a little unpopular they
[1:02:17] don't want to get down at the altar and
[1:02:18] cry a little bit miss a few meals
[1:02:20] something another they don't want to do
[1:02:21] it a lot of the way a lot of you you
[1:02:23] know your makeup on they think they cry
[1:02:24] they might wash it off have to put it on
[1:02:26] again why and i don't mean to say that
[1:02:28] sacrament i hope it don't sound that way
[1:02:30] but that's the truth they just don't
[1:02:32] want it they don't want the new birth
[1:02:34] because the new birth is kind of messy
[1:02:39] it's like any other birth any birth is a
[1:02:42] mess i don't care where it's at if it's
[1:02:44] in a pig pan or in a barn or if it's in
[1:02:46] a pink decorative hospital room it's a
[1:02:48] mess messy means out of order brother
[1:02:51] battle said i hope the church gets out
[1:02:54] of order long enough to get saved
[1:02:57] i hope we can get out of order long
[1:02:58] enough to get the holy ghost i hope we
[1:03:01] can get out of order long enough to make
[1:03:03] a rapture
[1:03:05] [Applause]
[1:03:06] out of order
[1:03:08] and so it is the new birth a mess amen
[1:03:11] it'll make you do things you didn't
[1:03:12] think you'd do stand on a corner be the
[1:03:14] tambourine or sing glory to be to god
[1:03:16] hallelujah praise god glory to god why
[1:03:19] you'll act like a maniac
[1:03:23] you know what the word maniac means
[1:03:26] it means a person expressing symptoms of
[1:03:29] wild behavior
[1:03:33] brahma said that's the way they acted on
[1:03:35] the day of pentecost like a bunch of
[1:03:37] maniacs
[1:03:39] brother if satan can make you act like a
[1:03:40] maniac for his amusement
[1:03:44] that's all he does
[1:03:46] you go off start doing your own thing
[1:03:48] and satan just sits back just laughs at
[1:03:50] you
[1:03:51] boy he's just laughing brother and said
[1:03:53] that's exactly what he was doing when
[1:03:54] they saw samson
[1:03:56] that great man of god
[1:03:58] with his eyes out being led by a lad
[1:04:02] to make sport
[1:04:03] and there they are laughing at god's
[1:04:05] servant
[1:04:07] oh brother
[1:04:08] i tell you what you get the holy ghost
[1:04:10] satan ain't laughing no more
[1:04:12] satan can't laugh anymore because he'll
[1:04:14] be crying
[1:04:18] you'll act like a maniac
[1:04:22] how many can honestly say in your heart
[1:04:24] you know you hadn't got this
[1:04:27] what i'm preaching on this this
[1:04:29] afternoon
[1:04:30] and you can honestly say in your heart
[1:04:32] lord even if it makes me act like a
[1:04:33] maniac this afternoon
[1:04:35] i want the holy ghost
[1:04:40] even if i do something that's way out of
[1:04:42] my element
[1:04:43] lord if it's in your element
[1:04:45] i'll do anything lord
[1:04:47] i'll just do anything to see you
[1:04:49] i'll do anything to have you
[1:04:52] oh brother sister when we get like that
[1:04:54] i think god will do something for us
[1:04:56] i think that's when god steps in and
[1:04:58] says all right he's ready
[1:05:00] he's ready to die
[1:05:02] it takes a mess for life to come out
[1:05:04] unless anything dies in roth's life
[1:05:06] can't come from it unless a man dies and
[1:05:08] rots in his own thoughts christ can't
[1:05:09] get into his heart
[1:05:14] oh brother
[1:05:17] pentecost is our pattern brother sister
[1:05:21] but i said that's what's the matter with
[1:05:22] the church today they got too starchy
[1:05:24] too much pride
[1:05:25] too much too much pride
[1:05:27] that's a reason for the divisions in the
[1:05:29] churches
[1:05:31] that's the reason that pastor don't want
[1:05:33] to talk to this other pastor
[1:05:35] that's the reason that this one won't
[1:05:36] fellowship with this one
[1:05:38] so reason for most of the problems in
[1:05:40] the church is people have too much pride
[1:05:43] they got too much pride they ain't
[1:05:45] willing to do what god said in his word
[1:05:47] to do
[1:05:48] because then they would have to humble
[1:05:50] themselves under the hand of a mighty
[1:05:51] god and they ain't going to do that
[1:05:53] because they're almighty so and so
[1:05:56] and they're very important
[1:05:58] and what they say is very important what
[1:06:00] they think is very important what they
[1:06:02] don't realize is what they think say and
[1:06:04] do is not even important
[1:06:08] what are we six foot of dust
[1:06:17] but i want my experience to match the
[1:06:19] bible
[1:06:20] if that's how they acted on the day of
[1:06:21] pentecost brother sister that's how i
[1:06:23] want to act
[1:06:25] and in my experience i didn't act like
[1:06:27] that i need to go back and have another
[1:06:28] experience till i act that way and not
[1:06:30] only act that way but come up and be a
[1:06:32] different person
[1:06:34] because brother if we can do all that
[1:06:35] and go outside and talk against our
[1:06:37] brother
[1:06:39] hello
[1:06:41] go outside and
[1:06:44] messing around with the girls
[1:06:46] go outside and talk the same language we
[1:06:49] always did
[1:06:50] and brother we didn't get that
[1:06:51] experience
[1:06:52] we might have shouted and jumped with
[1:06:54] the rest of them we didn't get that
[1:06:56] brother sister you stay there until
[1:06:58] you're dead
[1:06:59] till you're dead to self and god
[1:07:02] reigns in the holy spirit into your life
[1:07:04] not just not just for that service but
[1:07:07] brother till he fills you
[1:07:09] with the holy ghost brom said samson he
[1:07:11] said that last great effort he said look
[1:07:14] he said the spirit of god filled every
[1:07:16] fiber of his name
[1:07:20] anybody ever felt that
[1:07:22] i have
[1:07:24] let me just say that service lasted
[1:07:25] about six and a half hours that day
[1:07:33] watch this in the message the invisible
[1:07:34] union of the bride of jesus christ 1965
[1:07:36] brother branham said the modern church
[1:07:38] don't want none of those screaming
[1:07:39] shouting blabbering tongue speaking acts
[1:07:41] 2 38 miserable children that jesus
[1:07:44] thinks they are
[1:07:46] you don't want him
[1:07:47] but he said that's the only kind that
[1:07:49] the word can produce
[1:07:52] and god's bound to his own word
[1:07:54] so guess what he can't vary from that
[1:07:57] he can't there's not a different
[1:07:59] solution for a new birth
[1:08:03] it's the only kind the word can produce
[1:08:04] what is it it's a death
[1:08:07] it's a death
[1:08:10] before there can be a resurrection there
[1:08:12] has to be a death
[1:08:15] we want to resurrect before we've even
[1:08:17] died
[1:08:22] you've got to die before a resurrection
[1:08:25] and a new life can come it's a birth
[1:08:27] brother branham told of the young girl
[1:08:30] you remember that brother brown when he
[1:08:31] was younger he wanted there was this
[1:08:33] young girl that he liked and she wanted
[1:08:34] to go to dances said he wouldn't go to
[1:08:36] dances want to go to the movie show and
[1:08:37] go to movie show he said i want to go
[1:08:39] here and there and you know i don't want
[1:08:40] to what do you do for fun
[1:08:43] how do you get any joy
[1:08:45] where do you get joy from where does
[1:08:46] your joy come from
[1:08:48] well i like to fish
[1:08:50] i like to hunt that didn't interest her
[1:08:55] brother adam said
[1:09:00] that he was having some meetings
[1:09:03] a couple days later that girl showed up
[1:09:05] at that meeting
[1:09:08] said and all of a sudden there was
[1:09:09] thousands that came to the altar
[1:09:11] screaming and crying and praising the
[1:09:12] lord and she was up there with him
[1:09:16] crying
[1:09:17] she said
[1:09:18] billy i want this and brother bottom
[1:09:22] said i took her by the hand i said
[1:09:24] i said sister
[1:09:25] you want to know what joy i have
[1:09:28] said this is the joy that i have here
[1:09:31] brother i said i get more joy in the
[1:09:34] presence of god that you could get in 50
[1:09:37] years in this life
[1:09:39] i get more joy in five minutes in the
[1:09:42] presence of the lord
[1:09:43] brother adam said if we could get so
[1:09:45] together this church bond our faith and
[1:09:48] our worship together he said in five
[1:09:51] minutes there wouldn't be one crippled
[1:09:53] person in our midst there would be one
[1:09:55] person in the holy oak but one would
[1:09:57] receive it there want to be one person
[1:09:59] needing deliverance that one day
[1:10:00] delivered how many wants to be delivered
[1:10:02] this morning how many wants a new birth
[1:10:04] this morning i say how many people are
[1:10:06] ready to die to yourself and be born
[1:10:08] again in christ glory to god you've got
[1:10:11] to have an experience like jacob did
[1:10:13] amen jacob grabbed a hold of that angel
[1:10:16] he said i'm not going to let you go
[1:10:18] until you bless me that's the attitude
[1:10:21] this morning brother sister you want to
[1:10:23] die you want a birth you're going to
[1:10:25] have to grab a hold of god this morning
[1:10:27] and say i'm not going to let you go
[1:10:29] until you bless me
[1:10:33] there's power in holding on
[1:10:37] i said there's power in holding on not
[1:10:40] just praying for a little bit until
[1:10:42] satan tells you you're done not just
[1:10:43] praying for a little bit till you get a
[1:10:45] tear roll down your face not just
[1:10:46] praying for a little bit i say you pray
[1:10:48] and hold on until you know that you're
[1:10:51] thoroughly convinced
[1:10:53] that you're thoroughly convinced that
[1:10:55] you've had a revelation that god has
[1:10:58] birthed you
[1:11:02] you've got to have that experience
[1:11:04] brother you've got to have an experience
[1:11:05] like miriam had
[1:11:08] when you see that your enemy is dead
[1:11:11] that's the experience you've got to have
[1:11:14] that's the experience you've got to have
[1:11:16] to go not let brother isaiah be the one
[1:11:19] playing the tambourine you'll go grab
[1:11:20] the tambourine from brother isaiah and
[1:11:22] say let me play that thing
[1:11:24] i just saw my enemies dead
[1:11:27] brother there was a death to self
[1:11:29] that's exactly what that type is brother
[1:11:31] sister the same thing that had stood
[1:11:34] over her and spit in her face and told
[1:11:37] her she was unworthy and she was this
[1:11:39] and that the same enemy
[1:11:41] that grabbed that whip and whipped her
[1:11:43] into stripes and blood pour it out and
[1:11:46] told her she was this and that
[1:11:48] that same enemy was drowning in a sea
[1:11:53] brother you can drown your enemy in a
[1:11:54] sea of blood this morning
[1:11:56] it's the same blood that poured out of
[1:11:58] emmanuel's veins on calvary's hill
[1:12:01] but i'm so glad somebody went to war for
[1:12:03] me
[1:12:04] [Music]
[1:12:06] somebody went to war for me
[1:12:09] when i couldn't go to war for myself
[1:12:11] when i couldn't fight for myself
[1:12:14] god sent down somebody to go to war for
[1:12:16] me
[1:12:17] his name was jesus
[1:12:19] he went to war for me so that i could be
[1:12:22] free
[1:12:24] so that i could be whole
[1:12:26] so i could tell everyone i know
[1:12:30] he thought i was worth saving
[1:12:35] he thought i was worth keeping
[1:12:39] when everybody else could only see the
[1:12:41] worst in me
[1:12:43] he saw the best in me
[1:12:47] he said brother tim you're quoting
[1:12:48] gospel songs i sure am
[1:12:50] they got a lot of truth in them
[1:12:52] i like it better a lot of these more
[1:12:54] modern songs let me tell you
[1:12:56] i like some of those old gospel songs
[1:13:01] i like them old slave songs too brother
[1:13:03] sister people that went through
[1:13:05] something
[1:13:06] people that had to go through things
[1:13:09] that birthed songs out of travail
[1:13:11] burst songs out of hardship you know
[1:13:13] that some of the best songs ever written
[1:13:15] came out of hardship came out of trial
[1:13:17] came out of testing the man that wrote
[1:13:19] it as well with my soul both his
[1:13:21] daughter and his wife passed away
[1:13:24] and he still sung a song called it is
[1:13:26] well with my soul
[1:13:29] why because he knew who his god was

[1:14:41] people
[1:14:43] friends influences right cell phones
[1:14:45] social media video games movies

[1:14:56] brahm said those things will be better
[1:14:58] than midnight to us

[1:15:10] born again well if i get that kind of
[1:15:12] experience i won't be able to do this or
[1:15:13] do that or can't go to this and do that
[1:15:15] well you see the devil will tell you
[1:15:17] that you're going to lose some good time
[1:15:19] you're going to lose some privileges but
[1:15:21] he's lying to you
[1:15:23] especially young people oh my you don't
[1:15:26] have to drink you don't have to smoke
[1:15:27] you don't have to run around in this
[1:15:29] place of amusement why the holy spirit
[1:15:30] is a million times better than all the
[1:15:33] devil could ever offer you
[1:15:36] anybody ever found that to be true
[1:15:39] i know i have
[1:15:41] i've always said you want to come to a
[1:15:42] dance come to church
[1:15:45] you want to go to a party come to church
[1:15:48] you want a drink come to church
[1:15:51] whether there's a wine that's full
[1:15:53] flowing full and free you don't even
[1:15:55] have to pay for it
[1:15:58] you don't got to worry about it running
[1:15:59] out
[1:16:02] god's got a free-flowing tap going on
[1:16:05] and it just keeps on giving and giving
[1:16:08] and the more you take in the more don't
[1:16:09] be like that little fish in the ocean
[1:16:11] thinks he's going to drink up the whole
[1:16:13] ocean
[1:16:14] well you just keep drinking
[1:16:16] and drinking and drinking
[1:16:20] i don't have it with me brother brown
[1:16:21] said i've been drunk
[1:16:23] for a long time
[1:16:28] there's something about being born again
[1:16:30] brother sister
[1:16:32] creates a well inside of you just keeps
[1:16:34] on bubbling
[1:16:35] keeps on flowing
[1:16:43] i remember the hour i got born again
[1:16:46] remember the hour that god began to fill
[1:16:47] me with the holy ghost
[1:16:54] anybody ever got to rock bottom
[1:16:58] i have
[1:17:04] let me tell you the way of the
[1:17:05] transgressor is hard brother sister
[1:17:12] i grew up in church my dad pastors the
[1:17:14] church a saying i song-led
[1:17:17] preached once in a while
[1:17:22] but somehow i had failed throughout all
[1:17:25] my years
[1:17:27] to truly let the holy ghost come in and
[1:17:29] abide
[1:17:32] not just to come in brother sister but
[1:17:34] to let him abide
[1:17:36] to let him become lord of your life
[1:17:40] everybody with me amen
[1:17:44] a lot of people want him to be the
[1:17:45] savior
[1:17:47] they don't want him to be their lord
[1:17:50] that means turning over rulership
[1:17:52] to jesus christ
[1:17:55] people don't want to do that
[1:18:01] brother i got to a place i was sat down
[1:18:04] from singing
[1:18:06] i was sitting in the pew
[1:18:08] i went from being one of the liveliest
[1:18:09] ones to being one of the deadest ones in
[1:18:11] the church
[1:18:12] i fell into a depression
[1:18:15] i came into a real dark spot
[1:18:18] and i came to a place in my life it was
[1:18:19] either i'm gonna just
[1:18:21] head right out forget everything i've
[1:18:23] ever been told learned or anything i've
[1:18:26] ever felt about god
[1:18:30] or you're going to go all the way with
[1:18:31] god
[1:18:32] you come to a crossroads in your life
[1:18:34] brother sister
[1:18:36] where you can't play church anymore
[1:18:38] you're going to have to make a decision
[1:18:42] it was a wednesday night
[1:18:46] i was sitting down
[1:18:48] next to mama
[1:18:51] be shocked what the prayers of your mama
[1:18:53] can do
[1:18:56] i was sitting there
[1:18:58] message was over
[1:19:01] i hadn't felt the holy spirit in months
[1:19:03] i haven't thought the lord speak to me
[1:19:05] in months
[1:19:09] all of a sudden the lord spoke to me
[1:19:12] right there that wednesday night
[1:19:19] and i
[1:19:20] knew i knew
[1:19:23] that i was going to leave that service
[1:19:25] different
[1:19:27] i walked up to the altar and i said
[1:19:29] dad
[1:19:32] i want the holy ghost
[1:19:35] i raised up my hands about five seconds
[1:19:37] into that prayer brother sister the holy
[1:19:39] spirit
[1:19:40] i felt it was like a
[1:19:42] but it felt like someone had a blow
[1:19:44] torch right over my head
[1:19:46] but it came into my body i felt it come
[1:19:48] it burst through my chest went all the
[1:19:50] way down into my feet
[1:19:52] i fell backwards onto the floor brother
[1:19:54] i laid there for about five minutes
[1:19:58] babbling something i don't know what i
[1:19:59] was doing
[1:20:01] when i got out of that church brother
[1:20:03] sister i wasn't perfect
[1:20:05] i wasn't the greatest human being that
[1:20:06] ever lived on this planet
[1:20:08] but i knew one thing
[1:20:10] i was going to be different
[1:20:13] i know i wasn't walking out of there the
[1:20:14] same person that i walked in there
[1:20:19] i'm here to tell you don't let the devil
[1:20:21] tell you you're not worthy
[1:20:23] don't let him tell you
[1:20:25] that you crossed a line with god don't
[1:20:27] let him tell you that you don't have the
[1:20:29] strength to make it because guess what
[1:20:30] i'm not counting on my strength anyhow
[1:20:32] i'm counting on the grace of almighty
[1:20:34] god that called me
[1:20:39] well that's how my fire got lit
[1:20:42] i've had a fire ever since
[1:20:44] have i had battles and trials yeah i've
[1:20:46] had battles and trials
[1:20:47] have i ever got sad again yeah i got sad
[1:20:49] again
[1:20:51] but there's something that holds on the
[1:20:52] inside
[1:20:54] [Applause]
[1:20:57] stand with me would you i'm talking
[1:21:00] about a process of death brother sister
[1:21:03] have you started that process
[1:21:06] are you willing to go through that
[1:21:07] process
[1:21:13] brother adam said oh there's people in
[1:21:14] eternity tonight
[1:21:17] out in house screaming
[1:21:21] if we could walk and pull open the gate
[1:21:22] like this and let you look down in there
[1:21:25] i'd never have to make much of an altar
[1:21:27] call they'd be screaming and climbing
[1:21:29] over one another for the opportunity
[1:21:33] you imagine someone that's in hell that
[1:21:35] knew they did wrong knew they never
[1:21:37] repented knew that they didn't get born
[1:21:38] again knew these things that we're
[1:21:40] trying to tell you now
[1:21:44] but i'm saying if hell could swing open
[1:21:46] its doors right now
[1:21:48] they would come crawling over one
[1:21:50] another
[1:21:52] i wouldn't even have to make an altar
[1:21:53] call
[1:21:54] they would just come running over
[1:21:56] sprinting crawling over one another
[1:21:58] trying to get
[1:22:00] to the service you won't go to
[1:22:07] what an opportunity we have
[1:22:09] this afternoon
[1:22:19] but they have passed beyond the veil
[1:22:20] beyond mercy now it's too far they can't
[1:22:23] never be redeemed they're going they're
[1:22:24] gone forever they will never
[1:22:27] never be redeemed
[1:22:28] they had the same opportunity that you
[1:22:30] have
[1:22:32] those people in hell
[1:22:34] that if the doors would open they would
[1:22:36] be crawling over one another they had
[1:22:37] the same opportunity that you have right
[1:22:39] now
[1:22:40] this afternoon
[1:22:43] now we could pretend that
[1:22:46] this is just a cute little service for
[1:22:48] the young people and
[1:22:50] we could walk out and oh that was so
[1:22:52] nice
[1:22:54] go do something fun
[1:22:56] i don't know
[1:23:00] or
[1:23:02] we could recognize the presence of god
[1:23:05] that is here with us this afternoon
[1:23:09] we could shake off all the devils that
[1:23:11] have been attacking us we can shake off
[1:23:13] all the formalism all the pride all the
[1:23:15] indifference
[1:23:19] we can come before the lord see i don't
[1:23:21] see him
[1:23:22] rather i see him all around this
[1:23:24] building
[1:23:28] what is he doing
[1:23:29] knocking
[1:23:32] knocking
[1:23:33] he's not pounding
[1:23:34] he's not trying to kick down your door
[1:23:36] he's knocking softly
[1:23:38] [Music]
[1:23:42] you say brother tim i don't you don't
[1:23:43] understand what i'm going through yes
[1:23:45] ma'am yes sir i sure do
[1:23:48] i sure do know what you're going through
[1:23:50] i went through the same thing
[1:23:52] i went through that process of death
[1:23:53] it's not fun
[1:23:56] fun comes later
[1:23:59] it's grueling it's hard
[1:24:02] brother sister being a christian is the
[1:24:04] hardest thing you'll ever do
[1:24:07] that ain't for the wake of heart it's
[1:24:08] not for the faint of heart it's not for
[1:24:09] people that couldn't hack
[1:24:11] all the crazy world out there no it's
[1:24:13] it's the hardest thing you'll ever do is
[1:24:14] be a christian
[1:24:17] because this is satan's eating
[1:24:18] everything
[1:24:21] that is portrayed around you everything
[1:24:24] that is displayed around you is of the
[1:24:26] devil
[1:24:27] the majority of it is all from the devil
[1:24:30] it's all the devil's work
[1:24:32] in other words everything outside of the
[1:24:34] church the family the word of god your
[1:24:36] prayer life
[1:24:38] is things that are trying to destroy you
[1:24:41] they're totally anti-god
[1:24:45] but you can receive a spirit
[1:24:49] not just any spirit the spirit of jesus
[1:24:51] christ can come into you
[1:24:55] this afternoon
[1:24:58] to combat that thing out there
[1:25:02] you might have walked and defeated
[1:25:04] brother you died of yourself this
[1:25:06] afternoon
[1:25:07] get the holy ghost you'll walk out with
[1:25:09] so much victory you don't know what to
[1:25:10] do with yourself
[1:25:13] you'll be ready to be a witness
[1:25:16] you'll be ready to tackle every devil
[1:25:18] that comes your way
[1:25:22] he's here this afternoon brother sister
[1:25:24] i felt him since i walked in
[1:25:29] don't waste your opportunity
[1:25:31] like those in hell wasted
[1:25:33] they had the same opportunity god isn't
[1:25:35] just if he didn't give everyone an
[1:25:37] opportunity
[1:25:38] he's giving us all an opportunity this
[1:25:40] afternoon
[1:25:41] you don't have to leave the same
[1:25:44] anybody ready to be different
[1:25:46] [Music]
[1:25:54] you wouldn't want to take their place
[1:25:55] tonight would you
[1:25:57] why not take the place at the right hand
[1:25:59] of christ
[1:26:00] to sit with him in heavenly places and
[1:26:02] with the saints and with the redeemed of
[1:26:04] the age to live in the blessed forever
[1:26:09] remember when jesus came walking on the
[1:26:10] sea towards the disciples
[1:26:13] and they thought it was a spirit so they
[1:26:15] got afraid
[1:26:19] then he
[1:26:20] said some very precious words brother
[1:26:21] sister
[1:26:24] he said fear not
[1:26:26] it is i
[1:26:28] be not afraid
[1:26:31] don't be afraid of god tonight this
[1:26:33] afternoon don't be afraid of god
[1:26:36] that presence you feel that spirit
[1:26:37] that's circling around you
[1:26:39] that's the presence of almighty god he
[1:26:41] thought enough of you
[1:26:43] to come down and make himself personally
[1:26:45] known to each one of you
[1:26:47] this
[1:26:48] afternoon but i could point out the
[1:26:50] people that god's trying to get to this
[1:26:53] afternoon
[1:26:56] are you afraid of god i want to ask you
[1:26:58] a question are you afraid of god
[1:27:00] is that why you've held off on so many
[1:27:02] of these things you're afraid of god
[1:27:07] it's all right to be afraid of what you
[1:27:08] can't see
[1:27:10] but brother when you've
[1:27:12] ever had that experience
[1:27:14] you'll see god everywhere you look
[1:27:18] most importantly you'll see god in you

[1:27:34] out to christ are you scared to be sold
[1:27:36] out
[1:27:38] are you scared to turn over all your
[1:27:39] heart to the lord
[1:27:41] don't be scared this afternoon
[1:27:44] the greatest choice you'll ever make is
[1:27:46] to allow jesus christ to be the king of
[1:27:49] your life
[1:27:50] greatest choice
[1:27:53] we'd be a fool to reject that
[1:27:57] we would absolutely be foolish to reject

[2:44:48] [Music]
[2:44:52] well i trust everybody it's been blessed
[2:44:54] i have been
[2:44:56] we thank god for god using our
[2:45:01] in such a special way
[2:45:04] you know even when you're praising god
[2:45:06] you can always pray
[2:45:08] if you don't if you don't have it you
[2:45:10] can pray to get it
[2:45:12] but when the anointing is here it's
[2:45:14] always here to destroy the yokes of the
[2:45:16] enemy
[2:45:17] and whenever you see the waters troubled
[2:45:19] like you saw today don't be afraid of it
[2:45:21] that's life
[2:45:22] you know satan will try to make you
[2:45:24] afraid
[2:45:26] you know even when someone jumps and
[2:45:29] knocks another you know the enemy might
[2:45:30] say see god don't love you god loves you
[2:45:33] it's always the enemy that's trying to
[2:45:35] destroy you or trying to stop you from
[2:45:37] going forward
[2:45:38] understand you have to press through a
[2:45:40] lot of things but that's okay
[2:45:43] that's all right
[2:45:44] when jesus shows up things do happen
[2:45:47] you know i appreciate the lord jesus
[2:45:49] christ for it's goodness and
[2:45:51] we thank god for all of you
[2:45:54] like i said i was gonna i was gonna
[2:45:56] speak on and i hate to destroy the
[2:45:59] anointing because everything is so good
[2:46:01] but uh we as young people need to come
[2:46:04] up with some ideas on how to
[2:46:06] not only do things that will bring us
[2:46:08] closer to the lord but things that we
[2:46:10] can do as a group
[2:46:12] one of the things that we
[2:46:14] and i'm going to let our
[2:46:17] wherever he is
[2:46:18] oh there he is amen i knew you were show
[2:46:21] up but not that short
[2:46:24] good come i'm gonna let you talk to him
[2:46:26] about that on things that we've been
[2:46:29] talking about doing and last year some
[2:46:31] of you all may not have been uh aware
[2:46:34] but some of the young people and myself
[2:46:36] went down to the park and we did some
[2:46:37] singing and some preaching um you know
[2:46:40] just a witness
[2:46:42] you know
[2:46:43] it can't hurt but it surely can help you
[2:46:46] it'll take away your shame
[2:46:48] and your embarrassment or whatever the
[2:46:50] case may be
[2:46:51] because it puts you out there and then
[2:46:53] now people know you're a christian
[2:46:55] and these things are not a mandate it's
[2:46:57] not a mandatory thing
[2:46:59] but hopefully we'll get a chance to do
[2:47:01] some of those things and who knows we
[2:47:02] might be able to catch some fish
[2:47:04] last year when we did go out
[2:47:07] some people were interested but where i
[2:47:08] failed i sat down and started talking to
[2:47:11] them and when i did that i lost the
[2:47:13] other
[2:47:14] crowd of people who were in their cars
[2:47:16] listening to the message
[2:47:18] so we learned through our uh uh
[2:47:20] experiences you go to fishing you catch
[2:47:22] some and because like we did last year
[2:47:24] we went fishing and we made so much
[2:47:27] noise the fish knew all about us so we
[2:47:29] didn't catch anything
[2:47:30] so by god's grace we hope to be
[2:47:33] fishermen of men don't be afraid of the
[2:47:35] holy ghost i used to be afraid of the
[2:47:37] holy ghost
[2:47:39] when i saw my mama jerking and carrying
[2:47:41] on and i'm thinking it looked like it
[2:47:42] hurt
[2:47:45] but sometimes what it is the joy of the
[2:47:46] lord is so wonderful that your body
[2:47:48] doesn't know how to respond to it and
[2:47:51] sometimes it act like uh like my brother
[2:47:53] you jump and just jump and you know
[2:47:55] that's one way but that's not the only
[2:47:57] way sometimes we cry sometimes we scream
[2:48:00] sometimes we just do things that like he
[2:48:02] said becomes a mess
[2:48:04] but i can tell you this
[2:48:07] so that you'll know
[2:48:09] there is no feeling
[2:48:13] ever you'll ever feel on this earth that
[2:48:16] will supersede what the holy spirit
[2:48:18] gives you
[2:48:20] you can try everything any kind of drugs
[2:48:23] any kind of immoral things you want to
[2:48:25] but i'ma tell you when the holy ghost
[2:48:27] strikes you it takes you to another
[2:48:30] level
[2:48:31] it puts you in a different place
[2:48:33] you know and as our brother timothy say
[2:48:35] get away from this third dimension let's
[2:48:37] take it higher
[2:48:39] i like when he i like that word
[2:48:40] dimension see because it helps me out
[2:48:43] because i understand that this thing
[2:48:45] here it takes god to take away your
[2:48:47] sadness it take away your your pain you
[2:48:50] know all of those things but we're gonna
[2:48:52] let our brother come i'm a preacher so
[2:48:54] he's still that anointing is still here
[2:48:55] so i'd be careful amen so
[2:48:59] we'll let a
