wedding to participate on on Sunday I really was blessed by you doing that uh you you really gave joy to me because I I saw your heart and I appreciate you very much all of you what a great sacrifice and we thank you for the love that you in concern that you had for the church here that you would travel that long distance being as tired as you were so I know you retired so and uh so we appreciate that and I was so happy to know that you guys was returning because you know you you I wasn't expecting it you know I was expecting you all to stay down there but God moved on your heart to come back and as I was told that the services were service was very very very good and I appreciate the love of God and all that he has done and shown uh through you um as of right now I need a touch from the Lord but we're going to give you my best and trust that the Lord will bless you and and all I Endeavors tonight that is to bring the word of God to you by the grace of God we ask that you turn with us to Ephesians the third chapter we begin reading there and um from there we'll ask you your turn with us too acts 11 26. Ephesians I said 31 I meant Ephesians speaking We Know Better Don't We Ephesians 3 14 through 21. thank you thank you those who prayed while I was attending my sister's funeral has been very uh taxing on me but nevertheless uh some great things came out of all of it and I do thank God for that um so I do appreciate your prayers for me during that time of bereavement if free Ephesians the third chapter 14 through 21 for this cause I bow my knee unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named that we would Grant that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breath and the length and the death and the height and to know that the love of Christ which passes knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in US he didn't say above us he said the power that worketh in US unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages World Without End Amen acts 11 and 26 and when he had found him he brought him unto Antioch and it came to pass that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church and taught much people and the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch let us pray our gracious father God we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy and all that you have done for us and is doing for us Lord we pray father God that your grace oh God would overshadow all things tonight and we pray that each and every one of us will be blessed and strengthened within Lord we commit this service into your hands and we pray father God that you're perfect and divine will will be done in all of us through Us in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I first entitled this message Bound by your name but when I when I said that I was working about not with my by my name but his name so I like to entitled Bound by his name and um you know when we think about a name we ask the question what is a name you know everybody have a definition of what a name is and according to one definition it is a word or set of words by which a person animal place or thing is known addressed or referred to I mean basically that's basically the way we think about names when we uh think about a name called Tommy uh you know we never reference it as to what does Tommy mean or David or any other name that may be common to us we never think about what we're calling that person brother Branham was one that sought out names and he said that names have meanings like Ricky and Elvis I think one is cat and the other one is a rat or something and he said you should never name your children those things because remember you know words have power and words produce character it's like if you call someone stupid long enough they'll become stupid it becomes a curse word or you call somebody dumb they'll become dumb because they'll believe what you're saying God for the revelation of this hour we must realize the day that we're living in we'll never press toward the mark we'll never try to scale the fences or Cross or leap higher uh than we did last year if we if we don't have a vision and the Bible said that the people without a vision they perish if you don't know where you're headed or what God is trying to bring you into you'll never strive to reach that Paul said I pressed toward the mark of a high calling which is in Christ Jesus so Paul understood that there was a pressing that he had to do and understand that was just in the Ephesus age where Paul says I'm pressing toward the mark but I fear that in this last days we're not seeing Christians pressing you know people are they've been entertained uh by what we call Christendom and they they have allowed themselves to uh uh uh uh how could I say it misunderstand uh what a Christian is sometimes people think a Christian is a person who believes in Jesus Christ and follow his teachings well there are many people who believe in Jesus Christ and follow his teachings but they're not even Christians uh what what constitute a Christian amen is when you're born again of the water and the spirit you know something has to take place it's not just I mean his disciples followed him for three and a half years but were they Christians potentially they were but they did not become Christian until they were born again you know so we know that by by by definition uh that we're a Christian can mean anything uh it reaches uh across every Banner of of of of of a political politics you know I I said like that because it's uh you know Methodist and Presbyterian and Baptist and you know you name all of the fragments of of Christianity and they all call themselves Christian but you know Paul said is Christ divided so you know in the Christian true Christian World Christ is not divided we are coming in a time when your life must Define what a Christian is it's got to be in a place where people don't it's not a guesswork it is something that they see something that they read something that they come to understand like in the book of Acts they were called Christians uh they didn't wear a sign or cross around their neck you know or or anything like that but they acted like Christ they walk like Christ they they did so many things like Christ the people uh call them Christians and and you gotta understand they demonstrated the word as Christ demonstrated the word your life is to Define what a Christian is not the name of your church or group affiliation many of these groups enlarges blaspheme the name of Christ by their life livings you see you you when you claim to be a Christian and you live otherwise and people say oh that's a Christian and your life is opposite of Christ it becomes blasphemous I mean that's what it is about the churches that we have for example our church is called Higher Ground and therefore if we stay on the same level all the time this church become Blasphemous we should always try to strive and reach higher Heights and deeper depths in Revelation and understanding of the word we should never stand still unless we become like everybody else right a Christian is to be the living Epistle of God the reveal word living that's what we are human vessels see they are to be God in flesh expressing and demonstrating the authority of the word that's just the definition of what I thought in my heart and mind according to the word of God what a Christian should be like because Bible said these signs shall follow them that believe it's not an organization it's not you know some large as I said but it is a body of Christ and and we know by God's grace amen that when it comes to the word of God we must learn how to how to live it according to the age that we're living in I mean you know we're Justified we're Sanctified you know we claim to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost but what is God requiring from the Christians today what is our criteria what is the ultimate goal for us and I'll tell you what it is it's divine love and we can't stop until Divine love is on on on display right uh you know because we understand love seeketh not our own love doesn't be disbelhave itself you know uh love is not Covetous or jealous or any kinds of things like that love is the greatest attribute of God matter of fact God the Bible said God is love and God so loved the world right that's when it gets so greater than love it becomes so I love that but here with brother Adam said he said love is the greatest weapon that God ever put into the hands of a man and through that you can't fool people see because love in itself like for example I think I I said this the other day when you say Amen that I love why do you love this woman and uh why does this woman love you and they say well uh they they provided me with this they did this for me they did that for me and you know I think they're pretty and all of those things that means nothing those things will fade away but when you come to love somebody and you say well I don't know why I just love them that's real I can't Define it because remember amen love can't be defined you know with the with the human tongue love cannot be defined I mean let's take eternity how will you Define eternity when eternity is operated by love it never ends it never cease you know this is what Paul said that one day we'll come to learn the breath the death the height you know all of these things because remember when we think we're reaching a wall God moves to all our father you see it never ever ends and you know it's amazing because our little brains our little Minds can't even comprehend it because we're so used to feelings and where sometimes we take that love we feel and we try to make God mushy and God is Not God is not a God I feel your love God is agape love amen it reaches Way Beyond the natural man the Bible said God Loved Us in that while we were what yet a sinner and to that that scripture in itself none of us could explain we can't understand it because when it comes to Sinners we find it difficult to love but God loved you love me while we were sinners he looked that kind of love look Beyond sin and see the man's need right it's like that woman that was caught in adultery what happened the world in its way of laws wanted to kill her but Jesus in love rebuke the elders and all of them when he could have really placed a harsh sentence on them but his grace and mercy wasn't just what the woman called an adultery the grace and mercy was also with the accusers and the word of God caused them to repent so much so they walked away Jesus said woman Wherever You Accuse us and she says Ah I have none he says well neither will I accuse you go and sin no more y'all understand me that's how love you know how can you forget how can you forget a man like that a man amen that you don't even know you just heard about him but he stopped your execution [Laughter] oh Jesus have mercy loving itself can't be explained even if you ask Daniel what happened how come those Lions didn't eat you I believe Daniel could say well you know I felt them close I felt them come up but there's something happening I can't explain it but something happened and and whatever was in the minds of those Lions they had to go back and lay down see because the law protected Daniel Hallelujah because in love there is no fear something came and captured Daniel fear kicked it out if he ever had any and wrapped itself around Daniel so much so that the Lions understood the master is here what about the Hebrew boys thrown in the Lion's Den I'm just giving you a little something I'm saying something here because if we don't recognize that we're approaching a day of persecution and you're going to need to know what love can do for you and the Hebrew boys and the Lion's Den what happened even the elements of the world fire understood when he stepped in y'all understand me because I'm coming to something she love steps into every situation that's why God said take no thought when they deliver you up into the council don't you prepare a message don't you even think about what's going to be said because in that moment love will step in Hallelujah the same God you've been worshiping in love through love and by love he himself will show up and the Bible said he himself will speak through you oh can you imagine we're bound folks and you and I must understand that's why it's so important that we live Christian lives we must have a good report people must know we are Christians in being a Christian you're going to suffer persecution they're going to be people that's going to try you amen things that you don't even understand why amen you're going through these things and I'll tell you why because God is approving you right because Jesus said amen when you suffer from my name's sake you are blessed so don't carry on like like the scripture says don't think it's strange when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing that the trying of your faith is more precious than gold but this call Paul said I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom listen now of whom the whole whole family in heaven Heaven is named we are bearing a name folks and this name is not just Jim or John but this name is the Lord Jesus Christ and that name Bears a certain character or characteristics you understand me because the Bible says according to Hebrews 13 and 8 he's the same yesterday the day and forever so if he's living and his name is living that means you must demonstrate God will vindicate every True Believer those who bear his name Hallelujah so you understand even when men mistreat you you've got to pray for them because if you don't pray for them God will judge them Hallelujah come on he even you know think about it here with Saul who never personally touched a Christian but he had orders to Kill Them All right on his way down to Damascus and here come God coming along he never knew he was going to meet him and listen if Paul had not been ordained to be the angel of Ephesus no doubt he would have been dead but because God had a purpose he had to stop Saul from killing more Christians and he says Paul says who are the Lord here you go body body who I thought he didn't say I'm Christians he said I am Jesus he gave the body of Christians the name Jesus it is hard for thee to kick against the prick see that's why I believe maybe that's what Paul got his Revelation from where the whole family and Earth of Heaven and Earth it is named after him because Paul had a personal interview the Bible says amen according to Saint Matthew 5 14-18 ye are the light of the world a city that is set on the hill cannot be hit so Christians if you're real you can't be hit according to the scripture if you are a real Christian you cannot be hid everybody see you neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a Candlestick and it's given light unto all that are in the house you're not supposed to hide it you don't you're not supposed to cover it or anything amen you I don't know whether this word fits but you're supposed to be a proud Christian I'm not a Paul that's what Paul said I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ because it is the power of God unto salvation so if you're not prideful and just say I'm not ashamed of it amen because listen you say oh brother Brooks what are you saying like I always say the suffering of this world cannot be compared to what Christ has in store for us let your lights so shine before men why that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven you see what I'm saying that's why it's important uh you know to to to to to understand that every trial is sent by God no matter what it is it may cut you off guard but just like I preached the other day they asked me to preach to a new church coming into the message down there in Sumter and so I I volunteered and was willing to do and and I I preached the message on reset because that's what they're saying the whole world is being reset so that's my message you know reset you understand what I've been doing in the I've been doing it wrong let's do it right now right so we I gotta reset much yes yes sometimes you make a mistake but you don't go on with it you reset it you back it up and try it again that's the way we do it amen thank God for the Amazing Grace Hallelujah as I would say thank God for the reset button Hey listen well God says listen Jesus said I think not that I come to destroy the law all Prophets I am coming out to destroy but to fulfill see that's what we've come to do fulfill all righteousness where in Christ in every way people of God fulfilling all righteousness laying down our lives for his life that he may live Lord give me Grace To Die completely to myself that Jesus Christ only will live that I have that testimony it's not I that live but Christ that lives in me that's what it's all about Hallelujah that all right but very merely I say unto you till Heaven and Earth past one jot or one little one kiddo shall in no wise pass from the law to all be fulfilled and what people don't understand the Fulfillment of the law it's the ceiling of the Holy Ghost it's the Perfection of Christ in you it ain't about your works it's about him his righteousness in you his love divine in you because whatever he conquers you conquered and whatever he fulfills you fulfill huh Hallelujah you love the Lord Paul said you know we got to work Jesus said we have to work he said because you know after a while it's the night we're coming we won't we won't be able to work Paul according to Romans 13 12-14 said the night is far spent the day is at hand this is what I this is what I'm trying to get the people to see the very season we're living in we've got to see it and I know you got to know it because the battles have been so intense everybody's fighting Satan is trying to say do you have the Holy Ghost or you don't have the Holy Ghost when you're going to get it and how you know you got it one thing for certain you must be alive and if you're alive it must be God in you because you came here as a dead man you can't hear you can kick a dead man and won't even grind but if you're hungering for more right Justice that means you're pregnant with something and it can't be the devil because the devil don't want righteousness the devil wants Holiness I mean God wants holiness right so it has to be the Holy Ghost in you calling for more God and the Holy Ghost Feast on the word that's how you grow by reading the word studying the word praying over it and letting that God in you grow to a maturity you can't say I love God if nothing you in you to love him you understand me the devil trying to deceive you and take away what God has already given you but the Bible said walk in the light as he is in the light Hallelujah is that right and while we're walking in that light understand when we come into adversities we've got to forgive one another Hallelujah and when you forgive one another God then takes you into a higher height and a deeper death he cleanses you from all your unrighteousness let us walk earnestly as in the as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness and not in chambering and wantingness and not in strife and it just listen listen this is no time to say oh God uh you know I'm gonna tell you what I'll say that let me say it this way this is the time to say Lord I have one desire like psalm 27. and that is to dwell in your presence everything will be added to you but you make sure you go there first right now we talk about light we're talking about coming into the light Jesus said I'm the light and you know uh then he says ye are the lights and as long as I'm in the world I am in the light I am the light and what was he saying like what do you mean light you think he was just glowing everywhere no it was his life that was contrary to the to to the norm his life was so God centered to everybody because see that he was a difference it wasn't in his clothing because he wore the same clothing all other Jews wore uh it was just life it was just love it was his ore it was his character it was how he loved on people he didn't care listen he didn't care if you hadn't taken a bath in 50 days he loved on you right he couldn't care if he was tattooed from head to toe he'd love on you he loved the sinner because he understood behind this Old Clay is a soul and that's what the devil is doing he makes Christians who are prejudiced but real Christians are not prejudiced I mean we we love Sinners we don't care how they come if they're willing to listen we're willing to give it Hallelujah the Bible tells us to put on the arm of light you know the armor the whole armor because the whole Army is light it's revelation yeah you know God in God's eye nobody is too dirty for him no no no no no people say well I don't understand too much God don't care matter of fact you're the kind he wants and you know it's amazing we we look at this because we're bound we say we got Christ in us and and back up from things no you cannot back up you got to go forward you got to do excuse me even as he would do how many of us would have gone to Legion a man naked and crazy beating himself with chains running everybody off but Jesus had an appointment with him you understand me God don't always lead you to a three-piece suit might be a garbage man or something it is so amazing you know my wife is has really been having a good time with the Lord and uh it's amazing because our next door neighbor Ruby has been conversing with them and you know we just doing good things and mainly her but today we I saw a purpose for all of that this man over here who has a church a bishop over here he was affiliated with the people who's next door and he comes over and we had a glorious time and the man was so happy he said I'm coming by your chair and he said I'm going to beat you before you get to mine but he was so happy that that we were Christians and and we United just like that he's from Liberia and it was amazing that that God I said listen it was the spirit of him this man and me who connected you know I I could care less of what he was believing but he had I knew the holy spirit that he had connected with mine and we had a good time and I can't wait to to talk with him you know I I know he saw brother random picture up there and everything else and you know but you know what he said nothing and it didn't change his Spirit at all you love the Lord the Almond like I said I'm gonna be long but you know when people put on the armor you know what it's for now you'll never see nobody out in the street just wearing Armor man how you doing man I went clean clean clean no people don't people wear armor for war it's uh you know of some some some sort of kind you know now we got football armor but it's there to protect the what body and the Bible said put on the whole armor of God right and you know I always thought it was just such an individual thing but it's not an individual thing we are the body of Christ and we are supposed to protect one another everybody is supposed to protect each other from what Satan himself because that's who our enemy is Bible according to First Peter 2 and 9 11 says but ye are chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people how many of y'all believe that's who you are amen that ye should show forth the Praises of him who have called you out of dodges into what this Marvelous Light how many of you have here and we sang this on I saw all the lie I saw ain't none of y'all most of y'all ain't never seen no life like because we're not talking about this scientific light we're saying revelation I saw the revelation of my day I saw the revelation of Calvary I saw the revelation of the blood I saw the revelation of Jesus now I know he's God now Paul he missed your life but my point is amen we sing those songs and we we're not even thinking about what we're saying but in reality you haven't seen the True Light until you see what the true light has made you that's the problem I was saying you know we forget the God in us for whatever reason we always want to think he's a Million Miles Away but Jesus said I'll be with you in you in you to the end of the age I see every move you make I see every thought that comes through your mind I I count Every Breath You Take see everything about us has already known there's no secrets with God about you he even knows the number of hairs on your head y'all understand me but you know what it what is we forget he's in there you know why because a lot of times we rely on feelings and how many times you've had your phone or keys in your hand and you didn't feel it in your hand but it was in your hand and you're looking for them whereby where are they hey that's in your head you know what I'm you understand what I'm saying even sometimes your senses lie to you and make you feel that God is not in there but when did God become your feelings God Is Not A Feeling and to understand him and to know him it comes by faith when pain is racking your body does that mean that God is not there he's there the Revelation is that he'll never leave me nor will he forsake me I don't know it it's sometimes we lose sight of who God is you know we say we don't believe in a trinitarian trinity but sometimes we treat him like one God is and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah right and now that same God in the person of the Holy Ghost there ain't nothing but one person in you and if you're dead it means that he's taking over your house we were one time alienated from the godhead we've obtained Mercy right now we find out that we're now pilgrims and strangers passing through is that right listen let me let me say it like this when that woman was called in adultery you know Jesus put them all to shame and and and and the Bible said when Jesus lifted up himself and saw none but the woman he said unto her woman where are those thine accusers have no man condemned thee now you got to realize Jesus preached a message so powerful in just a few words I can pull the scripture out of that no weapon formed against you shall prosper and those that speak against you to judge you you'll come to judge them I it's just it's so amazing and and to be justified as though you've never sinned in the first place all of that is in here and Jesus said if you don't have there's no accusers and that's what the Bible says who's going to lay in charge of God's select see but we we fail and that's why we don't have the joy because we let the devil come and accuse us and we believe his accusations when God has already said we are Justified as though we've never sinned in the first place now who are you going to believe God or the devil who's a liar this is revelation and as soon as you live this Revelation the devil will then begin to call you a hypocrite no you're no hypocrite because the life I live is not is not mine is his life and listen how can I be a hypocrite if my life is hid in Christ Jesus you're in a hiding place even brother Birmingham said God don't look at your mistakes that is so hard for us to comprehend I'm not talking about a man who's just but I'm talking about a Holy Ghost Field person amen when will we stop believing the devil's lies and that's why we can't go forward because the devil got you back here and God's trying to get you up here but as long as you believe his lies right I don't condemn you he says is that possible the Bible said blessed is the man whom God will not impute sin that means God won't charge you that that just didn't refer to Jesus Christ that that refers to all of the True Believers let me ask you a question with the mentality that you have the mindset that you've got and you allow anything to attack you how would you make a Rapture with your mind being condemned you can't do it he whom the son is set free is free indeed and where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty he took my place he took your place he became my sin I became his righteousness he gave it to me by choice by his election is that right then Jesus make again and that's the truth that's why people are not healed or delivered because they think well I'll do so much wrong how can God heal me well you still have a loss of Revelation all right when did God judge you like that there's a man born blind 30 years that who did who did Sin it says nobody and when it came to his time to be delivered he was delivered with the woman with the ancient blood who didn't stand there the Bible said nobody the Bible never said who sinned but she said within her heart if I but just touched the hymn of His Garment I'll be made whole see it was her confession her faith to believe that in my condition I can be healed she didn't wait on the crowd no doubt she had all kinds of Physicians telling her otherwise but with Jesus everything become possible you want to believe it let me ask you a question where when did Jesus Christ ever doubt the word never because he was the word and you can't you can't blame God uh for your unbelief you need to repent because we want God as a feeling God it's not a feeling in order to obtain God Is by faith I am the light this is revelation I'm trying to give you this is what I'm trying to tell you even because you're if I was sick and in their times I am sick but you know what you'll never know sometimes they're coming tired I might say something about like that but when I'm sick I still come in and preach I preach and by the time I'm done I'm fine it is still anointing that breaks the yolks I come to this house Amen to meet God and I need him I don't come here I just wallow in my sorrow it Grieves the Holy Ghost you know why because that is a true sign of unbelief why are you sad they were walking down the road to Emmaus wow you said they said well haven't you heard didn't you know CNN didn't tell you no it's just amazing he says where have you been drama and excitement that's going on around Jerusalem how did you miss this Hallelujah didn't even know they were talking to God and he just held himself letting him look stupid excuse me that word is not nice but you know what I'm saying he call him fool I can't do that but he did fools slow at heart why don't you believe all the scripture didn't you know these things and you got to understand Jesus taught them the scripture he taught them that he would die he told them that he would raise from the dead he told them all these things but because of their hardness of the heart because they were blood they couldn't see it think about it how many times God got to come to us and open our eyes to see things we need Untold is a zillion times but his grace that's what love does thank God for that and as long as his love don't give up on me I don't have to worry about it I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness did y'all hear that he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness that means you will always be in the light and as he break Revelation he'll give it to you because you will not be in darkness but shall have the light of life that all right listen and what people don't understand this light this light we call it light but it's really Revelation you know when when when when when when Paul says it in Galatians as far as many of you have been baptized into Christ have put him on it's a putting on it's a glory that comes with it Hallelujah and and this is what we need to learn how to do is put him on put on the whole arm of God everything Ephesians 6 11-18 says put on the whole arm of God that you may be able to what stand against the Wows of the Devil he's a tricky fellow right as individuals we put it on but as a church we ought to defend each other a real army has the same armor right for we wrestling or not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world and let me tell you something as long as you think God is an Aaron boy he's just gonna give you whatever you want you are your Revelation I was going to say something but it's right your revelation of God is not where it should be I know how to get something you know sometimes we just don't understand it but I've seen through scriptures when people get desperate and they really cry out to God he comes on the scene but if you get down there with your little Our Father's prayer and you didn't fall in half to sleep and all that nonsense ain't nothing happening you got to pray God give make me desperate but when you pray God make me desperate you better know what you're asking for but it's worth it it's worth it love make me desperate Brenda Lewis used to say make me desperate Lord that's more important than anything right now make me desperate I just don't want your feeling I know what you feel like when you come around me in church and other places I know but I'm not satisfied I want that inside More Than A Feeling something that I can't comprehend or Define but will live through me walk through me talk through me act through me everything about you I that's what I want and don't tell me it's not available is that right then he went on to tell us that it was just a spoonful he said if you get a spoonful of the ocean he says scientists have I have breaking it broken it down that everything in that Spoonful every little element in that spoon is in the ocean right so is it with God you say I'm Not Jesus but you got every element of him in you when you got the Holy Ghost you have every element in you healing is in you prophecy is in you everything that was in him is in you the word is in you we have people of God we should be bound to his name that I'll not do anything that's going to disgrace him I do not I do not anything amen that's going to bring reproach on his name I want to walk circumspectly as Paul said I want to live it amen y'all hear what I'm saying we should be bound to that name he still speaks in the message love whether it says not Christ when he was here on Earth let me just explain this as I tried last night talking about God's son Christ that the spirit dwelled in him the son can do nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing the father used the eyes of the son he used the lips of the sun now you use your eyes in your lips he said when you be when you brought listen when you brought before Governors and rulers and kings and so forth for my sake take no thought what you shall say for it'll be it be given to you let me tell you something if you would eat candy all day guess what gonna happen to you you gonna get sick if you eat wrong kind of stuff during the day guess what spiritually you're gonna get sick that's it it's whatever you eat if you're going to eat healthy which is the word of God you'll come out and feel good right I remember and I mean this lady going on to be the Lord she used to have it right sister Hattie I said I had it and I had it right I had it um oh I can't think of a last name we call her sister Hattie oh sister amen he lived right across the yard from the church but you can hear her coming 90 something years old she jumping coming through the door like that I used to look at her little feet coming through the door Joy and she said Minister Brooks Minister Brooks the other day I saw angels in the tree I believe she did when I came to this message out of all those people she was a one and only one that I could recall that loved on me and blessed me she was the one that told me about the The Carriage without the horses the car and I remember telling that to one of those Elders he said don't believe that ain't true that ain't true but it was true wherever she got it from she knew it was right and all I know is that lady was true holiness the bishop didn't like her because she used to be a preacher and he'd be preaching that word and misquoting that scripture and she'll rattle it back out right he didn't like her but she was full of God she carried that Bible right I mean she read that word didn't know nothing about this message we say we know the message but how often do we read our word [Music] there you go how can you love him that's what I told the Lord I said you got to increase this Lord all my studying you got to increase everything about you increase it increase it Lord increase it you love the Lord I'm almost done Psalms 19 14. it says let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight oh Lord my strength in my redeemer let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be accepted acceptable in thy sight in other words I don't want to say nothing I won't don't want to think nothing everything I do what's going on in my heart let it be acceptable I don't want none of the world in it just only pure Holiness Lord Hallelujah glory to God Psalms 49 1-3 says hear this all ye people give here all you inhabitants of the world I love the scripture both low and high rich and poor together he's covering everything my mouth listen to me my mouth shall speak of wisdom and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding in other words I don't care what you think about me I'm gonna remain a Christian I'm going to speak like a Christian I'm gonna talk walk everything I'm going to do whether you like it or not if you're rich you're poor if you're high you're low you're gonna know this boy is a Christian the word spoken must be his word flowing from our mouth and I'm closing on this because you and I must know the times and the season that we're living in no joke we were sometime in darkness and alienated from God but now God has redeemed us but of times and Seasons Brethren you have no need that I write unto you let me tell you something like this message people and call whatever you want to call them churches whatever folks are fighting and still going over doctrines they don't even know what they're doing and don't even know that Satan took the same word and it's killed a lot of folks by twisting it and and bringing us to into a bondage and God has set us free and we get so tied up on laws and rules and regulations where we can't even love one another we're more concerned about what somebody looked like on the outside than what's on the inside that ain't nothing but the devil call it what you want them to tell you that's what it is for yourself know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night and when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction comes upon cometh upon them as travaileth upon a woman with child and they shall not Escape no no no no but it says but ye now I wonder who is he talking to I'm as I know he's speaking to me now I don't know whether you're a ye tonight but but I'm a ye but ye Brethren are not in darkness that that day shall overtake you as a thief ye are the children of the light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of the darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch see that's what I'm saying and be sober watch what watch your surroundings watch everything everything that moves watch it but they that sleep in the night and they'd be drunken in the night for they that sleepeth in the night excuse me and they that be drunken are drunken in the night and this is where the conditions of the people are you're trying to get them to see that the coming of the Lord is at hand and we're getting ready to see it face something in this world we've never faced before as American especially we don't even know what the next move is but we know the next move see but what people people you know everything looks so so ordinary Satan got everybody oh ain't nothing happening it just looks so that's when you need to be watching everything like I try to tell people I said a snake can crawl right up on you and you'll never hear him smooth character but let us who our other day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for a helmet the hope of salvation for God has not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ who died for us that whatever we whether we awake or sleep we should live together with him amen I'm gonna close the day I've got I've got some other things but you know I look at this thing and I said Lord be helpful be merciful because I want to bear his name in honor I really do I want to bear his name in honor let's stand have a word of Prayer dear heavenly father God we come before you Lord humbly as we know howling Lord I Thank You for Your Grace I thank you for your mercy to whom shall we go if thou withdraw thyself from us to whom shall we go Lord you are the way the truth and the light and we know Lord God because of you we see what we see but father if there be anything in our lives that we're not seeing I pray that you Shine the Light give us a greater Revelation and understanding of what you are requiring for us truly I believe the saddest thing of this age will come to those who think [Music] they have done all you want them to do and they have believed everything you want them to believe but yet they don't know you this is what Paul said Lord not only did your suffering do I want to know you but I also want to know you in the power of your Resurrection father God you are the shepherd we're the Sheep lead us and guide us oh God into all truth Lord there must not just be a hero of the word but a doer of the word father help us now let Christ live in us to his fullest nor to his fullness Lord break and destroy the Yokes Hallelujah in my life personally Lord deliver me and free me from everything that's not like you Lord and I'll be careful to give you the praise Glory now Lord I have lived all these lives Lord all these years Lord declaring your name I've made a lot of mistakes I've come up short but Lord I I want to see a matureness in me granted father bring me Lord to that Capstone of love for I could love the unlovable Lord that I could love all that you love and hate everything that you hate help us now grant us victory in this hour Lord without you lord we're near nothing Lord without you we're failures Lord so we need you every hour every moment of the hour help us now Lord as we press our ways as Paul says pressing Lord toward that high calling in Christ in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] all the wires
