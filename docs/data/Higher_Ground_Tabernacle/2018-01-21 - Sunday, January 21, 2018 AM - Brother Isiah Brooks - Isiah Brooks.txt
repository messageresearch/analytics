[Music] we just thank God for His grace in its mercy amen appreciate your patience we stayed a little longer than anticipated they're in New Jersey only because the pastor got sick had to have an operation and then his assistant was afflicted with that bad flu you should have seen him he was wrapped from here the child and his old family got sick so you know how that sickness is going on we just thank you for your grace up and your understanding the brother needed somebody instantaneously and so he asked me and I felt there to say yes so anyway we so glad we're here we think God for the many blessings that took place I trusted you all were praying for us we this message we've reached a brother really was blessed by it his son was possessed with demons he went home prayed before the Lord had been went before his son the demons started screaming out his son I don't love you and I don't love my mom and dad I died and I told him I said when you see your children or your husband or your wife saying things that they shouldn't say you ought to say like Jove you don't sound like my wife bringing into question what's and who's speaking then when you see that you identified the devlins that you know you have no right to stay here so anyway he prayed over his son and immediately the devil left the atmosphere changed its son began to tell how he loved his mom no I really love you mom I really love you know so things went well one sister had been wondering whether or not she had the Holy Spirit and the Holy Ghost start preaching and everything she had been thinking and talking to about her friend they looking at each other so she stood up and said well I know I got the Holy Ghost now so God delivered and healed various people it was a real blessing there so I think God for your prayers and for the Troy holding down the fort those of you who were faithful during that time I heard and trust that yeah you all had a good time with brother Ben I knew that you would it was the last minute thing but you know I knew what he was going through and he needed you just as much as you needed him and I so thank God for our brother bed you know we don't proselyte but I've already told him a man he's welcome in this place those of you who know brother being know that they grew up under my ministry there in Lima Ohio we ordained him I knew him before he got married I didn't have that honor to marry him but I can't recall but nevertheless a man we're glad to see the kind of a preacher that he's turned out to be you love the Lord we love the Lord and we appreciate him I remind me after serve before the service and I needed to discuss a few things but I don't want to do it now because it might interfere with the message as we stand we are going to sing God as our man do time as we stand that wasn't done purposely I remember what the Holy Ghost what it means saying after I'm so glad oh yeah [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] ah hey I'm so glad I got in this army into time as we stand returned to Matthew so glad to see my brother Josh I love that man amen amen God is so good to us Matthew 16 beginning at the 13th verse how many I'll know you're blessed Amen sister grace I was so love of God I I feel like I'm uh out of all the years I've served him I'm coming to really see who he really is to see his love that that he gives me words cannot express my gratitude for what he's done and how he's done what he's done I wouldn't change nothing in my life even my failures was needful for me to love him the way I love him Matthew 16:13 219th I try to preach this message without crying when Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples saying who do men say that I the Son of Man am and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremiah or one of the other prophets he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and jesus answered and said unto Him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood have not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and I say unto thee thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it and I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven let us pray father we come before you this morning we thank you for your grace and your mercy we so thank you for your loving kindness toward us seeing that the day of your judgement it's fast ly approaching us this world will have no place to hide but your grace has found us and in you we find a shelter and in you we find rest and we're so for this morning for your amazing grace every day I wake I can see how your grace is becoming more and more amazing to me blessed a service in a special way forgive us for anything we may have said or done or thought that have not been pleasing in your sight let's just a kind of glory be seen this morning give us grace to not only see the word believe the word but most of all receded increase our faith until our faith become that perfect faith that will match that perfect love help us now in your name Jesus Christ we pray and you may be seated always good to see our brother Travis - he's been pressing his way we appreciate that I sometimes get he and his brother mixed up for whatever pairing reason but anyway I'm always glad to see them we it's important that we know who God is you know God is a mystery because there's a lot of people who think they know who he is and they don't there are those who think yet they know him but they only know him by way of an intellectual conception the only way that you ever really know him is by the Holy Spirit you must be born again the column I cannot proceed those things that are of God when you know God in the carnal mind you have a tendency to reason the word but when you know him by way of his Holy Spirit it is his Holy Spirit that not only speaks to you but interprets or tell you what he really means when God spoke to Peter at the time Peter didn't know that he was God sometime God allowed things to happen to us to bring that revelation that's hidden deep down in our heart to the surface here in his mind he may not have seen him but his his heart he knew who he was and it was the Holy Spirit job to bring that out it is the Holy Spirit job to bring out of you who is living in you the very character of Christ that is in you it takes the Holy Spirit to bring it to the surface we realize by God's grace God asked a question who do men say hi the son of man am I love the scripture because so many things happens here that if without the Holy Spirit we would miss it he was a man by the name of simon barjona Simon the son of Jonas who do me and say that I am understand when he asked that question nobody really had a direct answer some say that thou art he lied you some say there are you are Jeremiah some say you're John the Baptist and then Jesus said unto Simon who do you say I am now watch the term son a man is understood by the Jewish P that term subtle man he says who do you say this prophet is see he knew that they understood that he was a prophet but he wanted to know who which which prophet is this and when Peter said thou art the Christ Jesus oh I can't explain it I just feel it no doubt his expression you know was illuminated because understand he was a man plus God he was a God land he had emotions but it's amazed when your children all of a sudden get the revelation or a certain relationship you know it's like working with a math problem with your children and you're trying to get them to solve it over and over and they're making the wrong mistakes and all of a sudden it clicks and it's enough a wonderful thing when that page realized I've succeeded and now he sees the process and he understand you know the equation he came up with the right answer and so I know by God's grace Peter when he said Peter Peter said thou art the Christ see none of his other disciples understood who he was but here he was and then jesus said flesh and blood didn't reveal that to you he didn't even say I did it he said my father which is in heaven he has revealed this thing unto you guess what happens then Simon Peter name is changed that's why the promise God said when you've heard from this message when you hear this message you have heard from your theophany see we got a new name now even so he said I had no longer call you search but I'll call you bride but each one of us have a name and it will be a new name brother branham said is probably the name we had whoo-hoo before we came here so we realized by God's grace when that revelation came then God Jesus himself looked at Peter directly he said flesh and blood if not revealed this unto you but my father which is in heaven he had revealed this thing unto you and I no longer call you but I will call you Peter I'm changing your name because you have the revelation of Who I am see with this revelation that God has brought through Malachi for it not only identify who God is but also comes to identify who you are and so we realized by God's grace amen now Peter got something that's gonna really change him and even though he's not converted yet it's in the making hallelujah and many of us who were not converted yet we heard the Eagles cry we heard the message and it identified if I could say it like this is snatched you away it changed you just in a moment's time and no longer could you go back to where you used to be even though you didn't know where you were going you were like Abraham I don't know where it's going to take me but wherever it's gonna take me I'm going that's how it is with this message you got to know who he is probably God in the Philadelphia age he says he's and the Lord of glory once as a father he was surrounded by the angels the Archangels the cherubims the seraphim's and the whole host of heaven crying holy holy holy is the Lord God of hosts such was his holiness that no man could approach unto him but now we see him in the church sharing his own holiness with us wait a minute now because he just said this holiness was so powerful he was unapproachable but now this holiness is being shared somebody helped me him with us I know y'all looking for y'all holiness and you probably can't find it right now but the Bible says he became a sin that we might become the righteousness of God you gotta believe this thing it's not what you see is what he sees that's all that counts your holiness or your righteousness is that filter acts can I continue I'm taking because I'm enjoying this it's like when you eat a good piece of cake you don't rush through it if somebody know what I'm talking about such was the holiness that no man could approach unto him but now we see him in the church sharing his own holiness with us until in him we have become the very righteousness of God yes there he stands Jesus perfect everything lily of the valley the bright and Morning Star the fairest of ten thousand and Omega root and offspring of David Father Son and Holy Ghost all and in all Isaiah says 9:6 for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counsellor the mighty God the everlasting father the Prince of Peace in him is perfect fulfillment though once we extend him not now we love him with joy unspeakable and full of glory I gotta have more than one ain't man in the midst of the church he stands and we will seeing his praise for he the mighty Conqueror his hand over the church which is the bride for he I want to hear what he's saying the mighty Conqueror is head in other words he hears yo Conqueror the mighty Conqueror is hair over the church which is his bride he bought that bride he owes her ain't nobody gonna own me I want him to own me do what you want to want to do with me Lord she his and he is alone and he cares for her so I want you to know when the devil tell you God don't care for you he's a liar she is his and here's a long and he cares for her he is our king and we are his kingdom I like that King dumb right his eternal y'all heard that word eternal possession not something temporal that's gonna wear out eternal possession that means before you arrived you were here if you die you are here you understand me there is no way of getting away from him this thing is so well plan is it's just perfect and all you and I are responsible of doing is to believe an act upon the word that he's given unto us hallelujah hello let me say it like this it's even people said well you know I believe it but you believe if you truly believe Amen that you've been redeemed if you truly believe that you're free of sin if you truly believe that you are with and is of God you apart hello somebody you carry yourself like prophet of God said like that King son though I be in another country I know who my father is and we walk like a king i'ma talk like a king i'ma live like a king y'all understand me when you are king that means you are in control you never allow Satan to get you a place where you feel out of control you say that in Scripture yes it is when those disciples were on the sea winds began to dash against the boat throw off the sails broke up the oars and all of a sudden Jesus in the boat sleeping and they felt like they were so out of control - they actually accused God how if thou not that we perish what you talkin about God cares for you but what God wants to see us to do is we need to stop cowing down to the devil the devil had won nothing since Calvary God wins every battle and when the devil takes him and he's got you condemned and think he said all my he deserved to go to hell the blood of Jesus prevails God don't lose none but we've got a fight we must fight God has already fault can I say like this we must fight until we rest we are new creation that's my my message to this morning is anointed to fight we anointed to fight huh because he is the Lord of Hosts the Bible said when he shall return he shall return on a white horse that's after the rapture and we will be his mighty army you and I must understand that this bearer as a prophet of God said did not start in Eden he started in heaven when Lucifer thought he have a greater Kingdom than Micah Lucifer was then kicked out of heaven and it comes down and we we know him now as the tree of the knowledge of good and evil hallelujah he deceived Eve and what was that deception the promise she would not hold to all of the promises right now that's where he deceives us you've got to take exactly all of the promises every one of them even the devil said well it ain't gonna happen you know what I'm saying look at this thing that were you such a liar the Bible said all in the book peoples of faith the chapter 11 of faith he said they all died in faith hello they didn't even see it but they believed it hallelujah it may have taken two four hundred four thousand years for it to come to pass but what is 4,000 years to Eternity some of them if you had to open up their coffin and then they may have been just a spoonful of dust but on that resurrection morning everything that was missing came back together because I really with the grave perhaps like this hallelujah but when the price of resurrection struck him he came out like a strong man hey God good see we are new creation this is not some old creation patched up together like the devil making us feel making us remember all the bad things we used to do hallelujah making a stink that God hasn't changed you God did change when God gave you the Holy Ghost he changed you but if you don't believe that it can't happen you got to believe you got it you gotta know that you got it and then you gotta let him grow up in you hmm that's where you suffer for those who have cease from seeing suffers in the flesh you know what sin is unbelief those of us who know the truth we know the right things we know the word you understand me and that word imprison us that's where you suffer because your flesh want to do wrong but that word got you tired up and tangled up colony huh he got you into a place you came to roll and your friend says you know you but that's all right I'll suffer hallelujah I'm gonna make you suffer flesh like you made me suffer that's when you've ceased from your own belief because you know the word is right you wrong if somebody helped me you and I must understand and I'm a preaching a little message I'm working on now he meant new blood we don't have the same blood line we used to have hallelujah come on somebody my daddy is no longer Isaiah Brooks when I'm born again I'm born of heaven and my father's Jesus Christ hallelujah I don't have to take the traits of my daddy anymore somebody I don't care what my DNA might have high blood pressure might have diabetes my have all kinds of stress and everything in it but when I'm born again a brother picked yesterday because I say lightbulbs instead of lightbulbs I said that's just that oh southern accent coming out its alway will be lightbulbs to me but Amen we look at this thing is what brother was what are you saying when that new blood is that right am i preaching a message brother branham said when the Holy Ghost coming you you have a blood transfusion I don't have to see it I know it and when I got new blood it means that my new blood overrides the old and whatever generation of curses was in my blood and it may have maybe I was the next one day to get whatever but that new blood says not today not tomorrow not forever hallelujah Wow because there's no sickness in God you zero Brotherhood's what do you say you know brother branham said we didn't even know this did you you know I didn't I did not know that Jesus got sick at times and we don't even know what kind of diseases hit him but we know one thing oh y'all say he didn't get sick well let me ask you a question did he get tired the scripture says so and he got sick when he conquered everything I guarantee you those Devils was running as fast as they could away from him brother rich what kind of man is this at least we let me make him give him a Smith but he didn't even Smith you and I must understand this what we're talking about and oh yeah oh mercy I can't do that Lord for help me Jesus hey we look at this thing we talk about a new bloodline and this bloodline comes to fight and I don't know about you but I said here we are ready to put Satan under our feet am I going slow enough so you can understand we look at this thing he says all in this new blood there is no failures in new this new blood there is no losers hello but in this new blood it's dynamite power in this new blood there's simple militants hmm oh come on somebody see until the word convinced you who you are you gonna keep going around like some beggar bar we're not vagabonds that's Esau side will not wonder us we are who we are and you say I can't have that kind of faith will you need to only go cuz you too just shall live by his faith not yours not yours the just shall live by his faith not yours that's how God keeps me when my Eden seem to run out I said Lord I'm standing in your faith and when you stand in his way you become invincible God Jesus never cower down to the devil everybody he want that's what makes him perfect and what was it because he wouldn't move unto the Holy Spirit he said I can't do nothing except I see the father do it you know he was so surrendered to the Holy Ghost or the Holy y'all understand me I'm not preaching to gods I'm saying there's what God but you gotta understand a man that the Spirit is one that cannot be seen unless he's seen through you and I you and me and we look at this thing and Jesus said he said Lord don't you know that Lazarus sick he said yes I know but I can't do nothing Lord doesn't know legs get who was yes it's true but I can't do nothing all that power and the devil said what do you think they're gonna think about you Martha Mary and Adam took you away and fed you amen whatever you needed they were there for you and now you won't go and then they meant all of a sudden they come a news Lazarus is dead come in God breaks a vision remember he's a prophet bricks their vision he says now is time for me hallelujah programers is now sleeping they were he's sleeping so no so you can understand Lazarus is now dead hallelujah is that right you see people fall off on that because brother Balaam said don't you ever think I'm dead I'm always alive right he's true but there is a body laying in the grain that is dead no man no woman in Christ ever died we live forevermore but understand that when yo when your work is done on this earth because brother Brad will say God takes you then when you're done anyway let's move on so we look at this thing it's what brothers what are you trying to say I'm trying to save this by the grace of God it meant God has ordained us you and me you and I to be God on earth he's not looking listen God taking children but these children will be men and women these children that's going to make a rapture will have come to the full sketch of Christ is that the truth the probably God that's what happened to Israel amen they came justification sanctification but they wouldn't go all the way and even those who win into Canaan had to fight and fight and fight and at the end of the day Joshua kehm said lord give me my mountain position and it placed me in the position I've been ordained to be placed in I was thinking just this morning and yesterday I said I don't know what's gonna happen to those who are dentists and doctors nurses I don't know cuz ain't nobody gonna be sick over there I don't know what's gonna happen to that the companies that makes toothpaste and toothbrushes combs all that's scientific wewe don't need no to prosper there's no bacteria there's nothing that's gonna rot your teeth you won't need combs I'll be the winner blowing said it right in place I don't know how he's gonna do it but everything that man is made none of it will exist anymore I'm so glad you know we won't have to have have to worry about turbulence honey we're traveling to thought we'll think about it in there with it with them talk about the bloodline if science cos only see the way to the next level is through Jesus Christ they would stop this nonsense evolving from a monkey now look what they evolving into they won't take God's Way so now look what they've evolved into I don't I've been born to be a god I didn't say I was born to be God I said I've been born to be a god I am a son of God you are daughter of God hallelujah and we are ordained to make the world see that nothing can defeat us why do you think God put you and I in the garden of Satan's Eden hmm that's where the battle started on earth he defeated Eve hallelujah but this bride will never be defeated she's a Maruyama she's a supernatural Church and she was whipped the devil only in his own Eden like he defeated Eve in his in her Eden we are e we will defeat the devil the difference is our name has been changed from a fallen Eve to a risen Lord who is the Lord Jesus Christ we are now risen in a rising back into that position where you and I become the word and the word cannot deny the word hallelujah y'all understand me o people that's what I'm saying I try to tell people you know don't look at me you know what my point is this hear the word hear the word anyway let me leave that alone listen word amen we are a chosen and elected to fight I put the I am in front of it for a full reason I am chosen let's repeat this I am chosen and elected to fight I am God's mighty man ordained to win I am trying by the Holy Ghost to fight without fear I am Jesus Christ representatives with his faith to conquer I am his body his power his bride I am queen like Esther I cannot be denied I am the word I am God's weaponry they old in flesh I am that I am I hope y'all said that in faith the Holy Spirit gave that to me I thought it was a song but he says no have the people repeated you see because he showed me that even in an army we see I can say I'm brainwashed people well they brainwash people by making them say certain things to convince themselves that they are right you know you know you find people who are so brainwashed so they are charged a man with a machine gun if he wasn't brainwashed he fear with overtaking you understand what I'm saying am I right or wrong the Word of God came came to wash your brain clean your mind change your mind just like the devil does the job becomes to change your mind he comes to change your mind who but he says you are and you know you ain't never lose and if you believe it that's what you become then God is saying through the Word of God you are more than a conqueror now who you gonna believe you gonna believe the devil's lie are you gonna believe God oh stop being so human stop being so fleshly people the poor the ears whatever God said that's who you are it sound like I'm fussing but I'm screaming like an ego that's all this is just an important message to me and I'm trying to get over to you because let me tell you something you and I think you're going through trials you need to be ashamed of yourself you paint so hard I don't know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna tell you something I sound like concrete Kadri he must be up in the pulpit somewhere but nevertheless the point is it's gonna get rough rougher it's gonna get harder folks and you letting the devil take your joy with this little stuff distracting you like god don't care like God care if God can move a mountain he can move whatever you need to be moved you just need to wait and hold up have faith in God it was the faith that pleases him when God see you worrying and fretting about things he cannot move you just tied in with unbelief but when you have faith in God and you move and stand there not I can't go nowhere but I'm gonna hold on to what you promised then God will move for you is that right God put you to the test in this army you must be tried hallelujah amen even in the Army military you have what they call obstacle courses you're not there for a picnic you're learning you're training and you're learning how to be a good soldier and so they tried to produce it meant obstacles that things that you would probably go through in a real war so that you will know how to react to it cuz understand this to say the end of it when we've had our honeymoon with God we come back Amen to fight one more time and the Bible said the bride Jesus himself amen will calm down have everything we ruin a rod of iron brother he no grace in this now devil we know who you are God is already redeemed hears hallelujah and we know who you are you can't you see time we fail to see who we really are we've got to stop thinking this let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus let this mind be in you there was also in Christ Jesus and whose mind he had he had the mind of Elohim he had the mind of Jehovah he had the mind y'all hear me he had the mind of God and when we get the mind that was in Christ Jesus I'm putting this way we get Jesus mind but we get Jesus mind jesus said I came in my father's name like I asked a question the other day I said when you get the whole egos what do you get who do you get if that same spirit be in you that was also in Christ Jesus what spirit was in Christ that's exile that's that blows me away that's a powerful revelation because if you don't understand that what you think is that you getting the Holy Ghost plus a man's spirit that's why brother Branham said this is God ain't looking for us to have no nail-scarred hands he's not asking us to wear no long hair when I'm man you know me he's not asking us to wear robes like Jesus did hallelujah but what we get is a very nature and character of God that makes us walk like Jesus act like Jesus think like Jesus submit like Jesus a lot of people don't see that this war calls for a lot of surrender and the closer you get to your gold in this life the more you're gonna have to surrender y'all hear me Jesus surrendered in in God the God gasps M&E but think about it he had to surrender even more walking that road up to Calvary he they're in the garden and the Bible said an angel came and strengthened him he y'all hear what I'm saying and he walked in you imagine some of us can't stand when somebody talk about us one time but here to his face they calling him names they spitting in his face and the Bible said he opened not his mouth surrendering he had to be a lamb and this pressure when the squeeze come you gonna have to be a lamb God will require you to be a lamb you understand me if roses had instructor walk Rock twice people more than likely wouldn't would would not have a cut have to go through this but brother mmmm said because Moses struck the rock twice bop bop when God told him to speak to the rock but striking the rocks twice mean that Christ now had to be crucified twice and now here we are Christ in the last age is that right rejected brought into into judgment in 1956-57 redacted now we've got to suffer because Moses struck the right brought twice crucified afresh in this generation that's why the God would be a little harsh on this generation than any generation before it's gonna be seven times worse because God said o Capernaum caproni Los Angeles Los Angeles you the city was called by the name of the Angels hmm you understand me such a revival came out of Los Angeles shook the entire world miracles signs wonders dead raised eyes of the blind open ears stop unstopped Amen all kinds of miracles happen Miss America should be worshipping only one God and that should be the Lord Jesus Christ but instead Amen we allowed and listen you heard me say this truth before I'm gonna close in a minute yeah is only the church stay pure the judgment of God cannot fall it's when the judge when the church goes bad that's when judgment comes right start at the house of God in Ezekiel right started the house of God strong with the ancient of the days start with the old people because they know better and some of us amen and I don't understand it in this message how people let folks go on without the Holy Ghost I'm gonna keep preaching it I'm gonna keep telling you whether you do it or whether you get it or not is up to you I can't give it to you but I'm gonna keep preaching it because I know it is a sick law you can't make a rapture without the Holy Ghost I don't care how much you know this Bible you can probably out quote me but that don't mean you're saying that don't mean you gonna make a rapture you've got to be blood wash and blood filled you got to have God only inside of you listen I follow the Prophet that don't mean a thing millions died who fallen Moses two of them understood that Moses was just available that he lied I mean God was living in that okay I'm almost done just give you a few more minutes Ephesians finally my brother the sixth chapter you know the turn there but finally my brother be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of God you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil and I'm gonna tell y'all something you know what the problem with this so-called church that's supposed to be mighty right now we've got too many distractions everybody wants worldly ambition it's okay but Jesus must come first he will not take second place in your life he's not one that can do that He is God he's the only potentate you understand me he's the only authority he's the chief of all Chiefs he's the king of kings and the Lord of lords he's not gonna take second place third you might as well forget it he must be first you examine yourself is God first in your life he must be first he cannot be second you can't be first not even you you must come second or third y'all gettin quiet but I'm giving you something to think about I'm talking about a rapture and we had a place right now it could happen anytime and still be scriptural wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of this world of darkness and of those world against spiritual wickedness in high places and I'm telling you what we're fighting against we're not fighting against brother so-and-so and brother so-and-so and sister so-and-so sister so and so you know you know we said we follow the message up to that point because brother brother BAM said when somebody offend you you ought to have pity on them and pray for them because it is a spirit and it not your brother and it's not your sister but we'll hold that we'll hold to that fresh like they did it yeah they did it and they mean to do they meant to do it you know you don't know what somebody's going through and will judge them like we ain't never seen before treat it

the other day I said I want to interview one man when I get there there's a lot I want to talk to but I want to talk to Lazarus the man who laid at the rich man table I want to talk to him how did you you know I know he didn't keep himself I know God kept him but I want to know when he was going through it and you didn't have food how did you know that jehovah was right how do you know what is it in you that makes you know this message is right you ought to be so great for the god I want to ask him because the Bible says Amen me never have seen the righteous forsaken this day no I see big and brave I'm sure you read the scripture pastors you had to read that and yet you begging for bread where was God in your life at that time well I know what he gonna say he's in my heart that melody of Georgia though he's in my heart because I am here you ask me why sing and shout he's in my heart he's in my heart oh I notice what he's saying when he's in your heart nobody can't take it no trial no tribulation no persecution that's what Paul said who just separate me from the love of God nothing can do it if everybody Amen all of the world I want to walk away from this message and say it ain't real fair you wear because I've sold my soul to this thing if those who are the world consult sell their souls to the devil I can show give mine to God hallelujah and if this ain't right tell me where is it because the world is getting ready to be annihilated where is it destroyed rather where is this Elijah if he ain't here yet where is he where is that voice that's going to make us rapture ready if he hasn't come yet where is he y'all know and I know the church is the way they are they came make a rapture why because God uncaged him God caged everyone that wasn't here there's a binding now in a bundling those who are God he's binding them to him right y'all understand me we understand that what God is doing amen he's now uniting invisibly with the bride of Jesus Christ so much so they become one yeah once you unite with him this time you can't get away from it but look at all the others out there all these denominations and I'm gonna tell you something they've been doing it for a long time they've been joining themselves to to these apostles creeds and the Catholic Church and all of these things all let's come together and be one and they take that scripture out of context that ain't the one this God wants he wants one Holy Ghost you baptize with his spirit you understand me oh so much I wanted to say I'm have to cut it off but let me tell you something people of God he was crucified for you and I he conquered death hell and the grave for me and you and because he lives I live because he lives you live but that's Lea you understand me so you understand it you were the marriage doctor million dollars in his in his lap boy he in his mind he's already gone you know something have to me not long ago but I won't go with it I won't say no I'd say it like this a friend of mine and I won't call her name now I'm gonna go in full detail but a friend of mine gave me a bad check he gave me a good check but it became bad and on that check he had 150,000 dollars I looked at that check all my bills are paid I'm debt free I called my wife I said you're not gonna believe we both rejoice oh my and I look at the chick oh you know made a mistake here I'm still not catching it then I look again I'm the old man he gave me but I felt so good for that moment me and my wife we laugh a date oh my but what was it you know you you've found yourself oh I'm gonna live it out you know we know we were thinking in the righteous way but that's what people do when they get a lot abundance of money they live they do things they normally wouldn't do you know what I'm saying they go god this and buy that and oh the joy of just doing it you know having a shopping spree without worrying about you know whether it's gonna be too much mmm that's living in this world well let's stop living in this world and start living in that world brother and said the promise is all of the promises of God are ours we mean he said even if you can't get to but you need to get a stepladder so you can reach up to it and grab we need to stop living like we are redeemed and living like we are nipa tonnes because he said omnipotence is in you and you're part of an omnipotent we need to start living just try it try it try it God start speaking without you said what brother I'm the word you know I don't know all I know is that Jesus saw a tree that wasn't that wasn't producing anything and he cursed the thing from his roots you are a tree you must produce Christ you must cuz God is coming back for the fruit but not of Christ he must see the thing on display you love the Lord but you gotta fight for word but let me tell you how you fight you stand still you stop trying to do all the impossible that you know yourself you can't do but then when you stop getting in God's Way thing that's when God a move you understand me you say find me some scriptures Moses why are you crying to me even Moses realized what am I doing here it is God has given me the authority to do all of these things and I'm in my human flesh looking at something that's impossible for me to do God said why are you crying to me speak it Moses hello did he say to those children the disciples on the boat did you see your vision before you know they were the cry of crises the ship was getting ready to go down there are times they meant you need to speak and forget about the protocol but here was he was he was a Moses Amen Garden delivered and all of these plagues and everything all miracles if he just holy had the David of my mind of David at that time he would have went for but something disconnect he broke broke the connection and he cries out to God like God helping God says how can I help you when I'm giving you everything you need how can God help us more than he's already helped us and when ain't giving you the Holy Ghost that's the best gift he can ever give you he's giving it to you but what is it we don't use it I remember my brother you know he was bragging on his wife says oh my he just got a merit and says man she don't even use the mop she get on the floor with the towel and mop so like then here on my right he thought that was good I tell you how good it felt when he said that I'm saying okay and I had the choice to ride a horse or drive a car which one without you huh you got a big old mop there come on somebody how many people coming in your house trying to see how shiny your flow is okay about that most of the people walk right on it if you don't tell them to take the shoes off y'all understand what I'm saying here I'm trying to tell you you've got omnipotence you got the supplier you got everything on the inside of you and you crying out to God help me I've already given you you sure when brother was you gotta feel things let me tell you something I got it I put this way hair there are times I've spoken things and they come right to pass I didn't feel no goosebumps I didn't hear no order of us it was that I needed Jesus at the same time and I knew he was at me and so I allow him to speak through me oh come on so right there are things that are done by inspiration there are things that you know you need to do by knowledge you don't know why you need to do it or why you need to say it but you say it anyway and it comes to pass y'all hear me but we need to get in tune with God so much so that he can use you so that there's Satan and the creation can see that the manifestation think that's the sons of God is on the move you talk about a rapture they groan and wait to see you move once you and I move I'll move it nature go gets get excited it says now is the time hallelujah now is the time we can break up now hallelujah we can cause California to sing come out somebody we can cause earthquakes we can cause we can renew ourselves because the son of gods are being renewed that's what I'm looking for that's what I want I want nothing other than God to be seen through me lest an help us in our mind but you allow us these minds of us to be transformed that will stop thinking so Cano in condemning ourselves when you have already justified us lord help us it doesn't mean we don't confess nor but we do confess one of the things I wanted to say I have a daughter that's wayward really wayward
