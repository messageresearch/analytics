make a little announcement on next week as well uh for the children that are nine or 10 years old a little above round up to 14 uh we'll be having a little bible study and uh we'll be teaching them by the grace of God and uh for those who can make it we'll start at 8:30 to 9 uh in my office so for those who can come you're more than welcome by the grace of God I tell you I experienced such a wonderful thing in Lima the uh uh brother Craig's little boy five years old Not only was able to tell me the message who preached last week what song The Man sang amen right I mean a 5-year-old boy was able to carry on a conversation about the word of God and uh I've seen it but it's been a while since I've seen it and I really believe by the grace of God if we don't get the word to our young people now it's not so limited but for the most part those that's the age I'd like to have uh because I realize by the grace of God is later than what we think and uh we just want to get that word into the young people if you don't know what you're fighting against you're already consumed hello amen so amen you love the Lord well that's uh that's been the main thing and we will be having communion on this evening by the grace of God um I've got to get my email straighten out by the grace of God so you love God I do if you don't let's stand by the way with grace of God and we're going to go I want to I want to encourage you this morning I'm sure every one of every one of us are trialfree praise God yeah really if you hiding in the right place the word of God said I hide in the Cliffs of the rock amen amen till the storm of life is PED so if you're in the right place it is not affecting you amen you're watching the storm as it goes by amen let us turn by the grace of God uh to First Peter 4:12 first Peter 4:12 uh Brother Rich and I was fellowshipping the other day and he said something that struck me I had some other thought on my heart and mind I might Minister that this evening if the Lord with Terry uh but when it struck me it just really hit and I thought I he Brother Rich I said that's what I I believe God want me to minister on so let us turn to 1 Peter 4:12 everybody there beloved think it not strange concerning the Fier trials which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you but rejoice in as much as ye are partakers of Christ's suffering that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad also with exceeding Joy you love the Lord Daniel 3 I know y'all like that scripture Daniel 3:25 after Daniel we go to joob Daniel 3:25 he answered and said lo I see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God one more scripture job 23 and10 you ought to be encouraged already by now you see I realize by the grace of God we all are in major battles maybe you're not but I know I have been but it has been a real good battle especially when you come out as the winner job 23 and10 but he knoweth the way that I take when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold now if that's not good stuff amen we like to in uh uh entitled this message when tried in the fire father God we come before you Lord we thank you for your grace your mercy and your love without you where would we be and father I am just astounded at your love and your grace that you have had personally toward me and your people Lord you have not dealt with us according to our iniquities our sins your mercy and your grace have been our hiding place and Lord we hold the banner of love thank you for being so real to us and oh longsuffering patient merciful and kind Lord give us Grace oh Lord to continue to walk before you Lord bless each and every heart in this assembly in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen am man you may be seated we have heard many times about how God is going to test us of course Peter said think it not strange when you fall into fiery trial now we know that when we talk about fiery trials we're talking about calamities or trials that test the character because that's what you're being tested your character is the only thing that's being tested right now because remember the prophet of God said you won't take nothing else with you job said naked I came into this world and naked I returned but literally the only way that you can get into heaven you must have Christ's character so we know by the grace of God trials are going to come tests are go going to come is that right listen the word of God said don't even think it's strange it's coming whether you like it or not you can be on the Mountaintop today and tomorrow you'll be fighting in the valley but understand it it's a true known fact that everything grows in the valley only little things are small things or sometimes no thing grow on top of the mountain hello somebody so we realize amen by the grace of God that we must understand that we must arm ourselves that's why the Bible said put on their whole armor of God we are in a time where God is perfecting a church he called this church the Bride of Jesus Christ and I don't know about you but I don't mind being tried I don't mind the fiery trials as long as I know that the fourth man is in the fire as long as he's there I'm going to be all right one thing I love about um this thing this illustration with Daniel because the Bible tells me amen that in these Hebrew boys that were uh literally thrown in the fire they bands were loosed in other words when you are Tried by a fire or a test it should not put you into bondage amen amen come on somebody but the father fire is there to loose you from bondage amen because remember they were Bound by uh the Babylonians but the closer they got to the fire the fire in itself broke the bands and they were loosed Hallelujah so if your trial has you in bondage something is not quite right you have not amen allowed this fire to loose you now one thing I love about the grace of God is that God gives us the spirit of repentance amen see Satan can put anything on us he can cause us to fall and come short but that word repentance hallelujah amen will clear the Slate every time and all you and I have to do is confess and make known unto the Lord amen our sorrowful HHH Spirit our our desire to live right and to live holy and the Bible said the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses you from all unrighteousness Psalms 80 And1 it says give ear oh Shepherd of Israel thou that leadth Joseph like a flock thou that dwelleth between the cherubims shine forth and when I read that I thought my isn't that wonderful amen that we have a Shepherd amen that dwells amen between the uh cherubims there on The Mercy Seat Hallelujah and if the shepherd is between the cherubims the Sheep must be also amen because amen it is the glory of God now I thought to myself here God is perfecting uh and bringing up a Perfect Bride for Jesus Christ and here he calls this A Flock Joseph Joseph that leadth Joseph like a flock and of course Joseph was Perfection hello we're talking about Joseph down in in Egypt hallelujah amen uh we talked about Joseph amen being perfect amen and God was leading him uh and and we realize by the grace of God that's what God is doing now but where is he leading us you know the prophet of God said that there's a Time amen when mankind fell God drove uh them out of the Garden of Eden and he put a flaming sword there to keep them from the Tree of Life he said but those same cherubims those same angels are now driving us back amen into the holies of holies Hallelujah why it is where we came from it is where we're going to return Hallelujah so we look in Isaiah 40 And1 says he shall feed his flock like a shepherd He Shall Gather the Lambs with his arm and carry them in his bosom and shall gently lead those that are with young now that is a promise hello and God keeps all of his promises I don't know about you but I believe that there is no safer Place uh to be other than into a bosom amen of the shepherd is that right amen that's where Lazarus when he died he was found in Abraham bosom hallelujah amen and he was Sav he was sound amen and he was out without harm is that okay now I'm working with the shepherd just a little bit because we know that we call and claim ourselves to be sheep come on somebody amen and we are dumb creatures we don't know how to lead ourselves and every time we try to lead we make a mess amen you don't have to tell me amen Amen on that cuz I know flesh I know what human beings do and every time we try to lead ourselves we get in trouble you're not designed to lead yourself you literally need a Shepherd Hallelujah come on somebody hlj but there's something good about sheep because once they come to know who their Shepherd is no matter how many Shepherds there are in the field that sheep will only hear its Shepherd's voice David said the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want that means I shall not lack nothing I love it because you and I are still gleaning from the blessings of David now you and I listen if you're lacking that's your problem amen hello somebody if you're lacking that's your problem because David said who's in the old Testament I shall not want oh come on somebody so if you're wanting it's only because you didn't ask and if you asked and didn't get it it's because you asking a Miss to consume it upon your own lust Hallelujah but if you asking because there's a really need a real need God will furnish you so much so you like nothing there is nothing lacking in the shakina glory he said he maketh me lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Ste Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the path of righteousness for his name sake oh he leads you in the path of righteousness because you're good cuz you think you all of that come on somebody oh maybe it's your family inheritance you think amen that that's why no no no no it's only for his name sake don't you ever forget it you and I ain't nothing but a clog of dirt full of worms right without God Amen oh yeah amen listen in the message Supernatural the prophet God talks about the way of a shepherd with his sheep and he talks about how this custom or this thing is done in the Eastern countries and you know if you've ever seen it or witnessed it you find it so fascinating because in the Eastern countries for those of us who've gone down to the farmers market basically that's how their markets are I mean just in the street and you just have one street you know you don't have sidewalks and you know it's not like how they have it down here where the dogs want to stray but when when a Shepherd uh is leading his sheep it doesn't matter how much fruit and how how great the attraction is that sheep knows how to stay in line he says now the easterners put all their dainties out on the street even their meats and everything else lay on the streets and all their fruits and produce lay right on the street here's your store like this they keep their stuff back in there but you buy right off the sidewalk and there's no sidewalk it's just a street so everybody walks right in the street just right down the street the cobbler Stone streets and here come a Shepherd down on the street walking walking along and behind him a string of sheep a shitty block long now I want you to imagine that just place that in your mind there's only one Shepherd there's a sheep behind the uh uh in front a sheep behind the Sheep behind the Sheep behind the Sheep behind the Sheep one straight line and you mean to tell me dumb sheep know how to stay in line in order sir and we're supposed to be more intelligent than that and we don't know how to stay in a straight line here come the shepherd down the street walking alone come on somebody and them sheep right walking right by the produce and things and won't turn right or left I'm going tell you something a Shepherd amen he Shepherds sometimes times more than sheep he might have camels he might have goats he might have a lot of things right but I want you to know there's a different behavior when it comes to the Sheep let me preach all right so they kept their eyes on the shepherd moving right on through I thought oh god what the shepherd means not look right or left nor be tempted by this or that but walk in the footsteps of the shepherd they want to follow the shepherd I noticed one day while we were in a little British Jeep riding along there was a Shepherd that had a whole lot of animals up on the hill there and he was feeding them they were leading them and taking them places and in there he had sheep and in there he had goats and in there he had mes and camels and everything he was feeding them all they were all grazing and the shepherd was watching them I said my a Shepherd here means many things Shepherd is a gay Grazer but he said you know the strange thing is when night time comes you watch all those sheep go right straight to the shepherd the mes would stay out in the pasture the camels would stay out in the pasture and the goats would stay out in the pasture but said the Sheep all come straight to the shepherd when come midnight time why said because the Sheep are put up at night and kept safe oh Hallelujah he said Mr don't talk like that I can feel brother R right now he's getting ready to get exited he said Mr don't talk like that right now he said you'll make me start shouting right in the middle of the road see night times are coming many are grazing on the same thing but only the Sheep will he recognize see what I mean just the Sheep the Born Again many are called few are chosen he said oh I love him today don't you now he said talk about in the other message here he talks about it there in Shepherd of the sheep F he said what about the fell he said them sheep is so devoted to the shepherd to W pay they pay no attention to nothing but they follow him real sheep Born Again believers they're so devoted to the shepherd till they pay nothing else attention they follow him I thought oh God your church should be so devoted to you that the Temptations of the world has nothing to do with them they keep their mind on the shepherd the shepherd could make one step this way they'll go back this way and every sheep coming right behind the other one make the same kind of a step follow the shepherd oh to follow the footstep of the shepher that's it don't be tempted tossed about worried tempted here and down here and today you got the Victory and tomorrow you out of the victory follow the shepherd he's a leading so my sheep knows my voice and a stranger they will not follow amen thank you Lord hello that ain't just preachers that means the devil the devil has a strange voice why follow him then oh y'all quiet this morning it's all right but I'm preaching anyhow consider your ways and the grace of God that has been given you you know we've had it so easy you know oh the Bride of Jesus Christ is this and the Bride of Jesus Christ is that she is is she is but I find out that there's so many people who claim to be the Bride of Jesus Christ and as of yet have not the Holy Ghost listen even in Trials even in Trials we fail to seek the one that could help us when job was going through a lot of things he had his confidence and I'm G tell you something sometimes when you got uh going through things it's best to keep your mouth shut amen because the people who you think going to encourage you will condemn you nobody knows your heart like God job 35 and 10 and you know I don't know uh let me move on but none saith where is God my maker who giveth some songs in the night come on somebody I don't care how dark your night is there's one that can give you a song Amen now I don't know about you but there's been many times I've gone through things and God had drop down a song it didn't come from the radio or the TV or anything else it came from Heaven am encouraging me and what I do I join right in with that song well you think think it came from where where do you think it comes from it comes from Heaven he said he give you a song in the night amen who teaches us more listen you ought to be uh conc uh how put how can I say it God listen what he says in and then I go on who teaches us more than the Beast of the earth and maketh us wiser than the fils of Heaven now here God has made you in His image right he is our comforter he made us in His image and likeness he gave us and made us in the highest form of his creation amen a man in the image and and likeness of God listen and yet we find ourselves less connected than most beasts you said explain that to me even brother brandham said when he was in India and the earthquake was getting ready to come he said all of those birds moved away from the wall right and then brother bam goes on to say and he talks about the Great Earthquake he talks about the trials and tests that about ready to attest us and so many of us are still at the wall the world Wall come on somebody we still don't know how to pull ourselves away from the world and we find we see the thing coming and we failing to get away from it come on somebody now Birds got better sense or better connection because listen all a bird have is a bird brain but he has a sensory something that lets him know trouble is coming amen and we we you know it's like us you know we'll play with a snake until it bites us but listen we are once connected with God we didn't knows the mind of God we we didn't know where to turn and where not to turn where to go and where not to go learning Amen to be followers of the holy spirit amen because remember the Bible said they that are led by the spirit they are truly the sons of God Amen every age had that trials and so don't think you you you exempt and you're going to go through this thing without it so many of us want to be we say we're bride and you know I'm I'm just wondering you know what is being produced in your life that sounds kind of kind of tough but it it's it's good because you must examine yourself Paul says and see whether you be in the faith so you and I must examine ourselves to see whether we be in the faith right because every age must produce the seed that was sown for that age Luther produced his seeds Wesley produced his seeds Pentecost produced their seed but we're now in the bride age and you know our Prophet who was William brandham sold those seeds they've been sown a long time and we're now in Harvest God didn't call us to a a church anity hello somebody God didn't call us Amen to be just a large or a group we supposed to be a Powerhouse it ain't God's fault the word has been sown he just needs somebody who going to take it by faith and act upon it that's why I love brother brandham his example he said when he got saved he looked into all the drawers right he wanted to know all of his blessings he want to know this he want to know that he said and then if if it's if the draw is too high he said get you L and climb up on it all of the blessings that God Amen has set for us is for us but we've got to be willing Amen to die to ourselves search it out am searching this word out is not coming to knowing it intellectually but it's proving it and let it prove itself Hallelujah listen Psalms amen 12 and 6 says the word of the Lord are pure pure words nah come on somebody y'all understand with that it means it's pure that means it will produce what it says it'll do is that right as silver tried in a furnace of Earth purified seven times every Church age had to be purified it had to go through his fire and we're not exempt what is your trial what is your fire what are you going through it's not your enemy the fire is your friend it comes to take the draws out of your life oh the trial is not to consume you it's only to consume your thoughts it's only to consume your fears it's only to consume the darkness in your life it's not to consume you matter of fact the fire comes to set you afraid amen hallelujah amen Remember by the grace of God how the devil thought that he was going to get rid of the Hebrew Boys in Daniel and he thought that he had set the fire 7even times harder brother bandam said in this day the fire is set seven times harder you say oh my God yes you and I are our trials are greater than any other age and God chose you thank you Lord to throw in the furnace amen hallelujah amen but we don't have to worry you said what I prayed and and I haven't heard amen anything from God and and brother said that's what it was the Hebrew boys they prayed had all night prayer and they didn't hear one word from God but they would not bow hallelujah amen they kept the C they held on to it amen they held on to it and and and and when they held on to it it brought God down because what you don't see is what's happening Beyond the Veil amen God Illustrated that there's always Supernatural heal waiting to help you come on somebody amen Gabriel stood there with his sword drawn and says God let me go down is that what he said he said I CH just matter in just a moment's time Hallelujah come on wormwood stood up and said God let me go down I'll turn the world upside down you know I've done it before amen and God said no sir this is my brideu this is my battle Hallelujah he said I'll go down hallelujah amen come on somebody you say God listen they said that he came four days late but right on time God ain't never late h Hallelujah it was late for them but it was all time for God and that's how it is in your trial if you hold fast to your character God will come down and answer and you know what's so powerful about it even the unbeliever saw the power of God in Shadrach mesach and Abo's life so much so he said the fourth one looks like the Son of God see that's the kind of thing we looking at and right now we're living in the most active age ever all the Demons of Euphrates millions of chargers now amen you ain't got you're not fighting one demon you fighting a lot of demons you probably can't even count all the demons you're fighting Hallelujah but you tough Hallelujah hallel come on somebody the word that we got in us has already been proven Hallelujah amen I got a good quote for you in just a moment but let me say it like this you got to start resting Amen on the man of God yes sir that gave you the promise amen Abraham seed that's what we do amen right how you going to know you going to have this baby cuz God said so amen how you know you're going to overcome cuz God Said So how do you know you're going to sit in the throne with him cuz God said so it is a promise for I have God failed on any promise never and he never will you believe God it don't make no difference what you struggling with amen you say well I got some Financial EAS what is money God can make it for you without going through uh the printing press huh come on the Str don't listen let me tell you something just like I said last week you know uh in my earlier days you know praying and fasting the way I would do all the time you know I just kept in commune with God and you know one day I god I didn't even ask him for it I needed it I didn't ask him he said I'm G to give you some money today I said yes Lord and um you know I went throughout the day thinking somebody's going to knock on my door somebody was going to break it the mail man was going to bring it nothing on my way to church I still believed God it had rained that day prior to my getting to the church so I had to hold up at the little shop down the street as I walked up the hill to the church God said to me in such a time in such like did not I promise you some money today that's how it was I say yes s yes Lord he said look down and there was the money folded up come on somebody and I was real Pentecostal then hallelujah woo I had me a good time I got my money amen because God promised it see y'all I'm not ashamed of God I danced in the clubhouse I dance in the church I dance on your street I dance in your house if I get excited cuz you know what brother brownon was a scornful man when he was looking at those old Pentecostal women slanging their hair and everything else he said they done made my my house a a a juke joint I mean what they call a dance hall that's what he said he said and then the holy go said but if you had the victory they had Hallelujah and that's what's wrong with some of y'all y'all ain't got no Victory y'all looking at me like I'm the one crazy uh-uh I'm the one that ain't got my mind I got his if you if you got your mind you're crazy amen true it's the man who don't have his mind that's the one that's ins that's sane but if you got your mind you're the one crazy don't tell me that you're double-minded you don't know which way to go amen y'all got me started oh so look that's what James said he said a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways so you got to keep it clean slate clean in other words you've got two natures and you haven't fully been baptized maybe you got the Holy Ghost on your spirit and not in your soul you got two Natures working with you amen God trying to tell you right and the devil trying to tell you wrong you know who going to win the man in the soul if your soul ain't converted God can be in your spirit all day and you going to do what your soul says right Hallelujah that man in your soul got to die Hallelujah it must die in order for God to live in you yes sir up to that point you going to be wishy-washy With God all the time with God I spoke in Tong with all our Spirits you know the uh the Fire H that's all right all those things are good but you can't stop there you got to go all the way into the Shina glory of God that's your age cuz that's where perfect love is behind the veil is that all right amen listen when you are unstable double-minded listen what happens to you second Peter 3:16 he said as also in all his Epistles speaking in them of these things you know the things that should come how men would be in which are all some things hard to be understood we find that even in the message people can't understand what brother brandham said he didn't say you had to understand he said believe it amen but they wrestle with the same stuff well this don't go there and that going go there you keep on wrestling the problem is you're unstable which they are unlearned and unrest unstable rest and I said to myself what is wrong with people amen that ain't got no power no gifts no no signs no wonders and yet they want to correct the prophet oh lordy lordy lordy which they that are unlearned and unstable rest as they do also other scriptures where un their own destruction and somewhere you're going to have to Anchor your soul in this world or you're going to always be unstable that's right moving with every win of Doctrine is that right amen let me tell you about a man by the name of Reuben he was the first born of Jacob of Israel is that right the Bible said when Jacob began to put out his blessings he said Ruben Thou Art my first born my might and the beginning of my strength the Excellency of dignity and the Excellency of power now this is what he was supposed to be he said but unstable as water and anybody know water is very unstable come on Thou shalt not exceed Excel excuse me as long as you are unstable there is no way you going to excel in God the Bible said don't even think a double-minded man is going to get anything from God because thou wentest up to thy father's bed and then defileth thou it and he went up to my couch is that right for one little sin being unstable like that amen and that word word comes into a recklessness sometimes you don't even know what you're getting ready to do but you'll let Satan tempt you and try you into something amen and make you fall into something that will be Reckless I'm going say it again so you'll know where you are this is the mirror of the word amen hallelujah you don't want to be unstable Holy Ghost feel in the church today and and don't know what you believe on the outside listen but we're here to I hope you're being blessed this morning we're here to endure you know why I'm preaching like this a man said to me the other day a brother he said brother I preached at a person's church he said and I just fear that I was too hard I'm going to tell you something I told him like this I said this is not a time to think that you could ever be too hard I said that's what's wrong with the people of God right now they've had it too easy and everybody in their minds thinking because they believe something is going to be just that way no sir you got to be converted amen that's right it's not you accepting God it's God accepting you and without the Holy Ghost is you're not he's not accepted you fully yet oh Hallelujah glory to God James 1:12 said blessed is the man that endureth Temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the Crown of Life which the Lord has promised to them that love him if you love me you'll keep my commandment and that is the issue most of us we don't love him you say it with your mouth but your heart is far from it Hallelujah come on somebody now you can think this brother Brook's preaching all you want to but God is talking to somebody this morning listen saying it with your mouth is not good enough it is your actions your action that makes the difference hello amen let no man say when he is tempted I am tempted of God for God cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enti the devil didn't make you do it you did it your own lust and entice only because amen you haven't been truly born again that's it amen amen well brother I believe the message I understand oh that ain't got nothing to do it Paul said you can have all of that and still don't have it it's got to be a nature change come on somebody you got in a nature change you love your enemy you love the unlovable come on somebody why because you're in a secet secret place and is between you and God you in that place you have that undisturbed place undisturbed Faith oh my I don't know whether I'm Gonna Fall Away Today I don't know whether I'm going to keep this thing oh Lord Oh Lord I'm hanging on iin hanging on nothing it's hanging on to me I can't hang on if I had to hang on I would have let go long time AG go but this thing won't let me go Hallelujah and I don't want him to either amen then when lust have conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it finished bringeth forth death do not Heir my beloved come on somebody is that the word hallelujah amen coming from the message Resurrection he says and the best defense that we have in the blood of Jesus Christ isn't it doesn't it is thus said the Lord Satan here it's written and that's what we we how many times we read our Bible just like I said on the other day amen in order for you to remain healthy you must eat every day is that right you must eat the word every day consecrate yourself every day that's only way you're going to survive in this age if you've been skipping meals you going to become anorexic or binic come on somebody you've got to stay with the word every day give us this day our daily bread it must be given every day you must must eat every day in order to remain spiritually healthy and I'll talk to him at least once a week then you don't even know which way he's trying to lead you right I believe if you work at a job your boss man going to come in there every day almost and tell you what you need to do or give you a list of things that's going to carry you out through the week of the things that you must need to do and that's how it is with Jesus Christ is that right ain't no using us fooling ourselves we're Christians and we're not Jesus defeated Satan by the written word showing that it could be done the things it to that brings it to the baby Christian no matter how small how little whatever you can say it is written amen and some of y'all want me to forsake my job my job is correction amen that's what I'm here for I'm not here to give you a Rose of bed of e or whatever how they say it I come by the grace of God and the Bible said according to Revelations three Beales to repent amen that's what God wants amen want us to be zous to repent quickly do it yes sir now watch Jesus could have used this power but he didn't he used the word he said it's written men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God and he stood there uh three times and defeated Satan all three times three it's the confirmation of a witness amen he defeated Satan on his own ground with the word of God Amen and the weakest Christian here tonight can defeat Satan so you ain't got you don't have no excuse oh I'm so weak that's all right you still strong stronger than Satan amen and the weakest Christian here tonight can defeat Satan anywhere any place any time under any condition and listen what he said with thus sayith the Lord amen that's right you just believe it here God say so how do you know God said so and by his stripes I'm here what is confession confession is to say the same thing that what you what what's confession is confess is to say the same thing and say the same thing and the same thing and the same thing I don't care how climic changes weather changes it doesn't matter you say the same thing I don't care if your temperature come up to 104 with the stripes I'm Healed confess it believe it don't look at your symptoms the symptoms is the worst thing the enemy uh God has to fight against symptoms everybody says well I pray for but my hands know better what you think Jesus how he would have if if if Jesus when he cast out that that devil had that fell that had epilepsy y'all remember that and when he when he he spoke to that demon and Demon and told that demon to come out the Bible said he that demon took that fell and tore him and tossed him and everything right hey am man so but what if he would have looked at that thing oh my God is getting worse like we do and so many of us we look at our problems and we think to ourselves God can't fix it I don't mean no harm I don't know the god you serving but mine is the creator fixing it ain't a problem he created the thing [Laughter] Hallelujah and he can recreate come on now I want you to understand people look at this we we're not serving some amate God we're serving the only true Living God is that right now I want you to understand even in the prophets Ministry people receed new Hearts new lungs new everything there was a person a man that didn't have no eyes they received new eyes and wanted blue ones and got blue ones amen God come around and he amen straighten out cross eyes come on somebody amen that same God is living today he didn't leave when the prophet left he's still here waiting on you and I to believe it and act upon it but we don't want the test we don't want the trial Hallelujah we don't we don't like Devil screaming in our head unbelief but that's it that's it he's going to scream those he got the best of Peter Peter said Lord let me walk bid me come God said come the devil's screaming in his ears he's looking all around him amen looking at the waves hearing the wind the howling of devils and everything from hell and the Bible tells me he was just only one Arm's Reach away from the Victory and he took his eyes come on somebody he took his eyes off the promise and Jesus and he began to sing but one thing about when a saint began to sink they know who to call on he called on the name of Jesus and Jesus lifted him right on up I don't know how he got him back to the boat but in my mind he must have carried it Hallelujah I don't know exactly how it happened but I'm all so glad about it listen you blessed is that right the Bible says according to uh uh uh Psalms 1 blessed is a man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sth in the seat of the scor FK yesterday when I was just uh out in the in in in my uh area uh one car pass me called me a name then another car call uh going down the highway I don't know who it was it just sound like somebody I knew actually playing a joke on me but I straightened it out later but anyhow you know what if I would have reacted the devil told me now you ought to do this or do that I didn't do nothing I my sheep Hearth My Voice come on somebody because all I could think about if I had reacted the way the devil reacted me and 57 year old amen dealing with some four or five youngsters i' have been in trouble had God not come on the sea come on somebody but let me tell you something what is name calling somebody say hey dog don't call me no dog y'all hear what I'm saying and that's all we ought to say you listen you ought change your words don't even call your children kids no more call them doves or Lambs or something don't call them kid kids rebellious and I think that's why we got such a rebellious children everywhere come here kid my kids I ain't got no kids amen right Lambs produce Lambs amen doves produce doves goats produce kids and our Prophet told us names mean something that's right it might feel a little funny for a while calling him a little Dove and they acted all bad but you call him that any you call them that anyway that that atmosphere has to change sweet tea you don't have to be like that right amen blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity and whose Spirit there is no Gile but you know brother comes along and he tells us that that is the bride cuz it quotes that thing again in the New Testament it doesn't even talk about where there is no Gia he leaves that off he said blessed is the man whom God will not impute iniquity because you and I find ourselves with gu some Lord until God seal us right y'all hear what I'm saying amen everything you do H sometime I put it this way Paul says when I go to do good evil is always present and you know you have to check your motives right because if your motives for doing something is wrong guess what I don't care if that work turned out good it's gonna burn I got a good quote for you just don't worry about it it's coming if you don't mind me moving amen blessed is the man whom thou chose choosest and causes to approach unto thee that he may dwell in the courts we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house even of thy Holy Temple you said why why are you reading this because amen no man can curse that which God has blessed amen but you got to believe you're blessed amen that must become a revelation to you that you are truly blessed oh come on somebody come on somebody is that right now here's my quote he said without the baptism of the Holy Spirit let me read this first Psalms 84 and5 says blessed is the man whose strength is in thee whose strength is in thee not in you not in himself in him whose strength is in thee whose heart are the ways of them listen in the message amen Israel in Egypt he says without the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said you're lost you won't have to worry about getting to Heaven if there is nothing in here Supernatural the door can't unlock that means you can't get to heaven right you the door won't even unlock if it ain't Supernatural on the inside hello don't get quiet listen I want you to listen too though amen he said the doors can't unlock you could walk here and bump your head against it but if the spirit of God is in there isn't in there the spirit of God inside will un unhinge the door got to have the thing in here to unlock it Yonder that's right you've already judged just on what you think about Jesus Christ now now here he comes torn Riven tore to Pieces his soul went to God he blessed God blessed him and then watch this and then his soul returned back in the form of the Holy Ghost amen that comes into every believer who so Jesus Soul God oh come on somebody return see the Holy Ghost ain't just anything it is God it is the soul of God and if the soul of God lives in you will it not work its way out amen and his soul returned back in the form of the baptism of the holy ghost that comes into every believer to sanctify clean up the Mind clean up the heart leave a portion of the Holy Ghost in there here and there y'all hear what I'm saying ah if you ain't got it ought to make you want it blessed is the man that trusteed in thee I just got on a I just got on a real ride when I went into the blessed is the man blessed is the man whom thou chasen in yes sir hello when God chastise you don't you know you blessed the devil say you're cursed but God say you're blessed why because if he chasing you and you endure chastisement he said you're a son but if you get all mad and you want to get all upset and you want to just say quit he said at that point you still a bastard now that's the word of God don't look at me like I curse God said it amen blessed is the man who thou chastenest oh Lord and teacheth him out of thy [Applause] law now here it is blessed is a man that fearth the Lord that delighteth greatly in his Commandments oh I like this one and I'm GNA move on blessed is the man that heareth me and watches daily at my Gates waiting at the post of my doors come on y'all y'all know that's I'm going tell you you take a real good dog a real good dog if some them have in the house but anyway them dogs are hang right there by that door waiting for the master to come or go right that that that Master don't even He he'll hear the sound of that dog right from the outside of the door he know the dog is ready to LEAP on him before he gets out the door that's a good dog Hallelujah you said what dogs got to be like cuz God liking us as Gentile dogs I love the way dogs praise their masters you can beat them neglect them mistreat them and they'll still love you huh that dog is saying listen you got to be really cruel before he ever run away it's the truth I know I used to have I had four or five of them I I can't do that that no more no more no more no more but nevertheless my point is if a dog can love a master what about us loving the master that we'll trust him in all of his decisions is that right I want God to make my decisions my son said to me when he called me this morning from Miami because he's got a real good business deal two of them going at the same time one is in Austin Texas and the other one still is in Miami and he says Daddy he said listen he took me all I got he said because this one in Miami is looking real good to me you know he'll be the the owner of this place and and uh he said to me he said but you know what what right now I want the will of God he said I've been tricked and duped by the devil many times he said I don't need no distractions I don't need anything that's going to come between me and God he said and I want the church to pray that God's perfect will be done so don't forget to pray that God will close the door to the one that he doesn't want my son to have you love the Lord I hope our brothers ready I hope y'all going to sing for me this morning it ain't all over did y'all practice I know y'all thought y'all got out of it didn't you you see I want y'all to sing so we don't have to stop amen y'all to some me before the word then I had to say okay time but we don't have to have it afterwards right amen oh come on people let's I enjoy Jesus the thing that Disturbed me more than anything is when I fail him that's what bothers me the most when I fail God is that right is that all right can I just a few more minutes all right Hebrews 11:17 Say by faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son now I want to say this to you understand this that God will try you with the things that means the most to you that's right a sacrifice is not a sacrifice unless it's something connected or so much so it will be painful remember brother bandam talk about little blind Bas is it blind botus had his little uh cni ey sheep and blind B said to God if you heal my daughter is that right he said I give you this sheep and now we wouldn't have known this about except a prophet told the story amen and then you know he comes along and he says listen he said the priest said blind M you can't give this sheep to how you going to see H H this sheep has been loyal to you he said I didn't promise God a sheep I promis God this sheep see so understand if God did it to Abraham cuz God had Abraham Isaac was Abraham's sheep he was his his love his listen if God would have taken ISAC amen from Abraham there would not have been another reproduction of his seed Abraham would have been dead so it meant something there was a connection there had to be something given and I'm going to tell tell you something the greater the sacrifice the greater the reward amen hey God don't want some of your life he wants all of your life and that's the thing you and I that's the greatest of all sacrifice because most human don't want to give God all you want to give him some and some will not make it he must have all or none at all is that all right amen so blind Mount ofus offered up that Lamb with Thanksgiving not knowing that Jesus the true Lamb of God was going to pass his way Hallelujah let me say it like this see that's what you don't understand the prophet of God said it like this God will owe no man nothing if you give God God will give back to you with interest amen what an investment so what happens amen he gave his his last his his allseeing lamb and here come the Lamb of God blind B is in the marketplace and the crowd is shouting and roaring see that's what I don't understand even the Jews was excited about Jesus amen and then you know when it comes to us and you know it's like we we shut I don't know I I people say well you trying to Prime me we trying to prompt me I'm trying to get you some Joy amen you know cuz Joy don't joy joy there expression with joy come on somebody amen amen so anyway even the water who don't even know have a brain know what Joy is like that's right brother said he talked to that spring said what makes you so happy why are you bubbling like that Hallelujah is because the deer drank from you no because I drank for you no he said there's something pushing woo Hallelujah that's what makes me so happy it's something pushing amen so anyway he comes along and he said listen he comes along and and you know he's you know the devil didn't make it easy for him he didn't have his eyes anymore and and it doesn't say he was bumping up in things but you know he was having a rough time amen and all of a sudden he was standing there and the crowd coming he says tell me who is that what is all this racket going on see where Jesus is brother say wherever Jesus is there's a lot of noise amen anden he said what is this ra he said you know have you heard of Jesus of Nazareth the son of David he said uh Jesus the son of D he said he said is he said is that himo I love that is that him he got louder every time huh they say shut up by me shut up you're out of order it's not here amen amen see when you want something from God you can never be out of order oh Hallelujah is that him is that him thou son of David have mercy on me now y'all think your cell phones are fast but that that voice went to heaven woo woo before you could know it amen G brother said Jesus didn't hear all that noise he didn't hear blind bame's voice but that blind balus touched God that desperation touch God God sent a signal and Jesus turned woo see that's the way I like it I want to all be so in tune with the satellite up there till when he sends a message I'll turn I don't know exactly what to do 1 Peter 1 said the trials of your faith being more precious than gold that perishes though it be tried with fire might be found unto what praise though tried in the fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ when now amen cuz we're looking for the coming he's already appeared amen he's been here he is here but he's still coming the Bride of Jesus Christ must be tried oh my I've got so much stuff hallelujah amen hallelujah ain't God good to us amen now she must be tried without the Lord Jesus where would be let's we're going to stop here Daniel 12:10 Daniel 12:10 we're comeing to our day at the end the service in this evening you ought to be encouraged amen yes you being tried you're not the first the Bible said e even so only Temptation that ever been uh tried men are those that things that are common so don't even think you're the only one going through it you're not and what you going through ain't something new right it's old Devils old demons old Devils old demons doing the same thing they always have been doing is that right like Jesus can't change neither can they Daniel 12210 says many shall be purified and made white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand don't you understand that if you were Wicked you wouldn't even understand it hello oh come on somebody none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand I read a quote on the Holy Ghost let me tell y'all something people I don't know what you got only you know what you have but if you know you don't have it you better get it amen that's all I can tell you I can't tell you when how and where only God knows what that is all about but don't be foolish thinking that your outward works is going to Merit you heaven hello don't be foolish to think your outward works is going to Merit you Heaven nobody could have outdone the the uh Pharisees and Jesus said accept your righteousness exceed the righteousness of Pharisees you shall in no wise enter in and how are you going to do it right and go beyond that the only way your righteousness is can can supersede theirs is that you have the one in you that superseded them and that was Jesus Christ himself huh that was Jesus Christ himself Amen to have him in him that his soul in you is like having
