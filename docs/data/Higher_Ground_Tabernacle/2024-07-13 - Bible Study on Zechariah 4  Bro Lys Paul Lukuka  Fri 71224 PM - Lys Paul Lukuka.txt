open our Bible to the book of Zechariah um Isaac you can go to the Bible app and just go to Zechariah just let me know whenever you're ready chapter 4 Zechariah Chapter 4 Verse 1-4 so pretty much the entire chapter and let me know when you guys are ready then we'll we'll read it together Isaac Zechariah Chapter 4 Verse 1-4 we'll gu started let's read together uh and the angel that talked with me came again and wake me as a man that is waken out of his sleep and said unto me what seest thou and I said I have looked and behold a Candlestick all of gold with a bowel upon on the top of it and he seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees by it one up on the right side of the bow and the other uh up on the left side thereof so I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my Lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and I said no my Lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit um sayith the Lord of host who art thou oh great Mountain before zerubabel that shall become plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it more moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands the hands of zerubabel have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts has sent me unto you for who has despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubabel with those seven they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and from um to and fro through the whole earth then answered I and said unto him what are these two olive trees up on the right side of the Candlestick and up on the left side thereof and I answered again and said unto him what be these two Olive branches which threw the the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves and he answered me and said knowest thou not what this be and I said no my Lord then he said he these are the two anointed ones that stand by the lord of the whole of the whole earth may the Lord add uh blessing to to his word you may have your seat and like I said um if you guys have any comments you know feel free this is not just me here like it's let's make it a collective effort right we're just sharing the word of God together so um let's we just break down this chap this uh chapter one by one so um here we see that um there were like they they were um after being led into captivity in Babylon you know they they the children of Israel left the Captivity and they went back to to their to their Homeland and because the first temple was destroyed you know they wanted to rebuild the second temple and um so this is in the process while they're trying to rebuild the second temple this is a vision that God is giving to zerubabel um uh encouraging him you know um for the for the uh construction of the second temple and I just want to show like The Parallel between the ministry of zerubabel and the ministry of William brandham because they're very similar and um so the first chap verse says and the angel that talk with me came again and wake me as a man that is waken out of his sleep and said unto said unto me um what seest thou and I said I have looked and behold a Candlestick so this is the the the verse that we start breaking down so he saw a Candlestick all of gold with a bow up on the top of it and his seven lamps thereof and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are up on the top thereof and two Olive Tree by it one up on the right side of the bowl and the other up on the left side thereof um Isaac can you hide the Bible and project the just click on hide yeah there we go all right so this is the vision that U this is the image of the vision that um Zariah saw right you can see the two Olive Tree trees one on the left one on the right and then the the Golden Stick the Candlestick um uh with seven pipes and seven lamps and there's a Golden Bowl in the middle and those two tree uh trees on the left and the right they actually um pouring oil and that oil oil is what is bringing the fire to the U it's what actually helping um the Candlestick be on fire right and so um but let's let's break down what are those what are those trees what does this represent what does this mean you know and uh so if we go to the Book of Revelation chap chapter 22 verse 1-2 uh let let me know whenever you guys are there so first we'll break down the that that those two tree uh uh trees that um that Zechariah saw in the vision um so Revelation ch 22: 1-2 um it says and he showed me a pure River of Water of Life clear as Crystal proceeding out of the Throne of God and of the L and in the midst of the streets of it and on either side of the river was there the Tree of Life which bear 12 manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree um were for the healing of the Nations right so in the Book of Revelation we see that uh the we see the the the appearance of trees that that tree again right and then he but the thing the thing here is saying that it's it doesn't say it doesn't say trees he said the tree of life right but then they were on either side you know that that's one thing that I was at first I was kind of confused about you know I was I was like the vision is talking about two trees you know but here it's it's referring on either side right it's making it seem as if it's two but then he says the the tree of the tree of life right so um um that's so that's that's one place in the Bible where they reference that tree of life so if we go to Psalm 1 verse 1-3 there's another place again where that tree of life is being referenced uh so that Psalm is talking it says blessed is the man let me know when of you guys are there I don't want to go too fast right so because this is a collective U study so just let me know whenever you guys are there right amen so um blessed is the man I wish we had a second mic I could have someone else read um but blessed is just because if one person reads then without the mic people on the live stream won't be able to to to to hear right so blessed is the man that walketh not in the counil of the ungodly nor standeth you want to read no that doesn't work I just read slowly right the first verse bless blessed I'm reading the ASV translation blessed is the man who walks not in the counsil of the wicked nor stands in the way of Sinners nor sits in the seats of scoffers okay and verse two um just because you're reading a different version you know read right yeah just read there verse two but his Delights is in the law of the Lord and his and in his law does he meditate day and night right and verse three and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water Waters that bringeth forth his fruits in his season his Leaf ALS also shall not wither and whatsoever he does shall prosper amen amen um I love this scripture first of all you know because there's a blessing that comes with the man that meditate upon the word of God day and night right so blessed is the man that walketh not in the counil of the ungodly but his Delight is in the Lord um and his Delight he and in his La do he meditat day and night in verse three it says and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water you know it keeps on being on Revelation it was also planted by the rivers of water and here again you know David is comparing this man that meditates day and night he's like a tree that's planty by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he does shall prosper right so um something very interesting about this uh Psalm um if if you let's read again the third chapter and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water right the prophet I was reading a quote uh that's where I got all these things you know I it's not from myself it's from the message right so the prophet um says he says somewhere where it's like notice the difference it's multiple Rivers but one water right like rivers of water it doesn't say rivers of waters it's rivers of water I I might have that quotes here out read it and and he's he's saying that it's like it's like the same thing one Spirit you know you know multiple diversity of of gifts you know but then it's still the same Spirits you know let let just read cor Corinthians chapter 12 4-7 it says now there are diversities of gift but the Same Spirit right you remember we just read Psalm where it says by the rivers of water multiple Rivers but one water multiple gifts but it's the same spirit and there are differences of admin administrations but the same Lord right different sort of different Administration same Lord different multiple Rivers same water and there are diversities of of operations but it is the same God which worketh all in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to Pro profit with all you know following verse for by one is given uh for by one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit you know some people they might have the gift of wisdom other people you know they might have the word of knowledge but it's still the same Spirit right to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another the gift of healing by The Same Spirit to another the working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues and the following verse says um but all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit dividing to every man severly as he will right so this is main stream of water main source of water dividing you know different gifts you know different Rivers you know that's that's that tree that uh um that David was referring to you know the prophet say that that water is pretty much it just a a representation of saying that it's the same Spirit but multiple gifts you know and for by one Spirit it doesn't say by two by three by four Spirits by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be bored or free and have been all made to drink into one Spirit you know I love this verse because Paul keeps on emphasizing on one one body one Spirit you know a selfsame spirit you know so it goes back to just uh if we if I just read again that PM a tree planted by the rivers of water you know the scripture it's just beautiful and um so let's continue the study so Revelation chapter 4 verse4 says and run about The Throne were four and 20 seats and up on the seats I saw four I saw four and 20 Elders seating clothed in white rment and they had on their heads crowns of gold right so we already so we noticing that there's a tree planted you know by by the rivers of water right and then uh one on the left one on the right right and then now let's see what those those um what the those those uh tree means according to the prophet so in the message questions and answers on Hebrews Parts three verse 6 I mean paragraph 691 the prophet says now the four and 20 elders an elder is an overseer now notice there were 12 Patriarchs and 12 Apostles and they were sitting 12 on one side and 12 on the other they were the 2 and4 Elders which were the 12 patriarch Patriarchs on one side the Old Testament the 12 apostles on the other side the New Testament then Jesus say you you'll set on 12 Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel uh the next U uh paragraph he says now the foundation now the foundations look there is a there is even a tree in there and the tree on either side Bears 12 manners of fruit and they yield their fruit once a month which is 12 months in the year they render 12 manners of fruits every year as it goes by 12 is the worship number you see there's 20 and4 would be 24 12 Apostles and 12 picture they're sitting at the throne so this is just laying the foundation we're trying to understand what those two trees means and we seeing according to the prophet it's the Old Testament and the New Testament because the old patriarch Patriarchs they represent the Old Testament and the the the the 12 apostles they represent the New Testament and uh you know it's even clear here on on this qu the prophet says it is the Church age book The Prophet says it is Burning Brightly because it has plenty of oil which is it is getting from the two olive trees which stand on either side the two represent the old and the New Testament and of course the oil typifies the Holy Ghost who alone can give the light of God to the people right so only the Holy Ghost can give the light of God so this is beautiful so the only light we are receiving is coming from that that ball that's giving the the um that has the oil that and that ball is receiving the oils from the two trees so the the Holy Ghost is only a a product of the of the word of God right so it can only come from the Old Testament and the New Testament we don't want to receive any spirits that comes outside of the word of God right because now it even makes more sense why we should always stay with the word because the only source of inspiration is coming from only those two trees right the Old Testament the New Testament and that's producing the Holy Ghost and you know and uh giving the oil and the prophet says that's the only light uh that's the that's the only thing the only one that can give the light of God to the people the angel who spoke to Zechariah was as much saying this so this is now the prophet just making it plain for us to for us to understand that this is what you see means that the church cannot accomplish anything by its own might or power but by the Holy Ghost cuz you know those seven seven lamps represent the seven you know it's like the it's to the seven Church ages right and then the only light they receive is coming from those trees and coming from the Holy Ghost the the the the b in the middle so the only um the church can only accomplish anything by the Holy Ghost right you can never do anything by your own within your own power no wonder he says not by power nor by might but by my spirit sayith the Lord right so um the next uh quote says in the me the message of Grace uh the prophet says I turn and looked again and I screamed out oh God why would you have your servant know just then the spirit of the Lord came in and said Jesus of the New Testament is Jehovah of the of the old he only changed his m from Spirit to man that was confirming of course my message of him you know this is just to bring into Clarity because you you know this some places they talk about one tree the other place they talk about one tree that's it's like it's one tree is planted on the waters and then the same time it seems like it's two trees but the prophet is saying that it's Jesus of the Old Testament is Jesus Christ je Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the New Testament right he just changed his M from Spirits to men so it's the same tree it's the same God you know it just like it over there it was the Old Testament and here it's the New Testament right and so let's continue so um sorry so let's continue so in John chapter 10: 10 John chapter 10: 10 it says um the thief then he heard and said unto me okay so this this is just trying to show you the parallel between you know the the um the zerubabel and the the the ministry of Will William Brenham you know zerubabel he came to restore something that was broken the temple you know the temple was destroyed and zerubabel he was he came to restore the temple you know cuz the enemy they came and they destroyed you know cuz and and and we see that it's the same thing in the ministry of William Bram you his ministry shall restore us back to the faith you know you know what the caterpillar has has eaten you know I shall restore all those things right so ver uh John chapter 10: 10 we know that the Devil comes uh so the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy but I'm come that they might have life and that they might have it abundantly right so so and then the the message of Grace the prophet says zerubabel the prince with Joshua was the one that was to bring forth his this headstone he had laid the foundation he had took the people back to the foundation and I like he said in type right because the scriptures you have to this is a shadow these are types to you know for what what what we living right right now so zabel he had to take the people back to the foundation you know because like I said again you know they were the they were dispersed going to Babylon you know in captivity but now that they returned they wanted to work they the previous study that we did the other day I show in book of he guy is that ha guy or hagy the book of hey that like they were concerned that okay we have we have good clothes we know we have good houses but then the house of the Lord is not built you know so they wanted to build a house for the Lord they wanted to restore that that that Temple of the Lord right and then uh uh the prophet talks about The Headstone right and so he had to take the people back to the foundation in Ty so that was the ministry of zerubabel right and the prophet says that was in type now let's compare that with the prophet's Ministry Malachi chapter 4 5 Verse 6 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse curse right so there's been a Destro something has been destroyed or something has been perverted right something has changed because if you want to turn the heart back to where be it belong that means something change in the on the way right and uh and we saw that the enemy the enemy is there to to kill steal and destroy and if you study the seven Church ages you will see how throughout the the the church age how the devil has tried to destroyed you know that that that that seed of God you know destroyed uh uh the promise that that that God gave for for the bride right and um he tried to to change the word of God you know saying okay baptize in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost being bringing Trinity multiple doctrines you know that are again that's how you know how the devil operates his doctrines doesn't align with the word of God we just saw from that Vision that everything we receive is coming from the two trees the Old Testament and the New Testament that's why the prophet always tells us stay with the word you know because that's that's where we get everything and so Luke chapter 1 uh verse 11 it says and there appear unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense and when Zechariah saw him he was TR troubled and fear um fell upon him but the angel said unto him fear not Zechariah for thy prayer is heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son and th shall call his name John and um the next um verse he says and he shall go before him in the spirit of God in the spirit and the power of Elias to turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the disob disobedience obedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared prepared for the Lord and um I think most of you guys already know this you know uh this is just a repetition but like you notice that in Luke chap 1 verse1 17 maybe you can help someone on the live stream he says he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias to turn the heart of the fathers to the children right he did not say to turn the heart of the children to the fathers he just says the heart of the fathers to the children right but if but we just read Malachi uh chapter 4 that says he had two Mission this Elijah yet one was to turn the heart uh to turn the heart of the fathers to the children the second to the left to turn the heart of the father to the children on the right to turn the heart of the children to their fathers but then when the angel came to give Zechariah the the word for John the Baptist he did not mention to turn the hearts of the children back to their fathers because that Ministry did not belong to um John the Baptist that was for the later days you know for the ministry of William Bram right so to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and this is a pattern that happens in the Bible you know even Jesus you know in for instance in Isaiah 61 verse 1-2 the spirit of the Lord God is upon me hopefully I'm not going too fast right so the spirit of God the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord has anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captive and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of Vengeance of our God so right to conform all the all that morning so two missions that that that Jesus that that the Christ said to fulfill right to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of Vengeance of our God but then when Jesus uh read that scripture and said today this the scripture is fulfilled he only let just read and he so Luke Chapter 4:16-17 he says and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue of the on the Sabbath day and stood up for the for for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of The Prophet uh isah and when Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it's written it's written and he came to wait hold on it's written the spirit of the Lord you know so even Jesus had a habit of reading the word you know if Jesus could read the Bible we should also read the Bible and we should be able to identify ourselves in the word because that's what Jesus did he he wasn't just reading the word just for the S he he identified himself with the scripture he knew exactly where stood on the scripture you know the devil the devil will play with you if you don't know your position in the word you know so Luke 48:19 it says the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach the Deliverance to the captive and recovering of sight to the blind to set a Liber at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he just paused there you know and then he says again and he closed the book so he did not he didn't even finish the full chapter he just closed the book and he says and he gave it again to the ministry and said down and the eyes of all that were in the synagogue were fasting on him and he began to say unto them this day is the scripture fulfilled in your ears right so just to show you that that's the same thing that's happening with Malachi right the first mission was for John the Baptist and the second mission is for the later days um and going back to the restoring Ministry we just read earlier where the Prophet says that you know Zechariah his ministry was to restore uh uh uh back the people right and then we see in Joel 2:25 he says and I will restore to you the years that the Locust has eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you right and if you have a if you have a chance to listen to that message I think in the the prophet preach I will restore I think that's the message he explains this deeper you know explaining what the caterpillar means what the canker worm it's just the devil changing his form you know it's the same an it's the same insect but it's just in different manifestations right and then that insects try to eat from like you know to destroy the the people of God but then God promises us that he will restore just like with zobel that had to restore the temple this Ministry of the end time will restore us but to the Faith of Our Fathers right and so now um I'm almost done so let's go back to Zechariah Isaac Isaac can you project Zechariah 4:7 all right okay let's read that so who are thou oh great Mountain before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it right so we see here that zerubabel in his restoring Ministry he's crying with shoutings you know shoutings crying Grace Grace so there are three things happening he's first shouting and he's crying and what is he crying he's crying a message of Grace Grace Grace unto it this is exactly the ministry of the end time ministry you know first as you can hide it now I'll put so first the Thessalonians 4:16 says for the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the trumpet of God and the dead in Christ will rise first just in comparison with zakar right he's he's coming first with shoutings and here this says for the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout you know and with the voice uh with a shout with the voice of an archangel and with the trumpet of God now let's see what the prophet says about about that uh in the message of rapture paragraph 130 says three things happen uh a shout a voice a trumpet has to happen to happen before Jesus appears Jesus does all three of them he's descending there is a shout what is the shout now we understand the prophet is breaking out what is the shout it's the message going forth first the living bread of life bringing forth the bride that's how the the restoration happens if how zerubabel was restoring the temple you know we we are the Temple of the Living God you know the devil has come and tried to destroy us but we've received a first the shout the shout we received the message in the uh process of restoration the message going forth the the living bread of life bringing forth the bride right and um the in paragraph U 141 of the same message he says the first thing comes when he starts descending from Heaven there's a shout what is it it's a message to get the people together a message come forth first now lamp trimming uh time rise and trim your lamps that's the message you know get ready the is coming you know rise and trim your lamps what what watch was that the seventh not the sixth the seventh behold the bridegroom cometh rise and trim your lamps and they did isn't that what the message of William bham is about Jesus is coming get ready trim your lamps the bridegroom cometh you know rise and trim your lamps and they did some of them found they didn't even have any oil in their lamp but it's lamp trimming time right so Zechariah Chapter 4 zel in his ministry restoring the temple you know bringing forth The Headstone with the shoutings and we understand that the prophet tells us that the shouting is the message telling us to get ready the bridegroom is coming right and uh the the next um uh quote says uh this morning the message this morning to me the High the Highlight message of my entire Ministry this morning see a highlight message of my entire Ministry someday and and okay this is just in reference to the message the token right the prophet is saying that that is the highlights um of his ministry um someday I'll tell you how it come about I know that everything has worked for months and month up to that one message all right so um almost done then the next thing okay let's read Matthew 25:1 to4 then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be liken unto 10 virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps right they were wise and they took the they took oil in their vessels we understand that the only way the pro we just going back again to that quotes the prophet says that the only way the church gets the light is from the Holy Ghost right from that bow like the that Vision that the prop that zerob saw there was a bowl with full of oil and the prophet says oil represents the Holy Ghost right and so the only way you can meet the bridegroom you got to have the oil Right In Your Vessel and uh verse five it says while the bridegroom teared they all slumbered and slept so even those that had the holy ghost slumbered and slept cuz he said the Bible says all so the prophet says that so there are the foolish virgins and the wise virgins but all of them slumbered and slept so some somehow in the process this is beautiful because that's what happening in the church age you know like the devil got in the church so distracted you know and then and then we even see that the vision that the um the prophet the angel of God drew the seven Church how you could see how the light started getting deer and deer you know as as as the ages are going forward slumbered and slept but at the midnight there was a cry made so remember Zechariah says with shoutings crying so there is a cry in the restoration of Z zerubabel right and here also at Midnight Cry there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him so if that cry wasn't made imagine they were all sleeping the bride bridegroom would have come and they would have not been ready right so we needed a message to come forth First crying you know behold the Bri the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him that that's those are steps of the restoration and um and the prophet says um in the message the uniting time and sign like the wise men coming down from Babylon they screamed where is he born King of the Jews he's on Earth right now we've got to find him that's right I believe he's so close to coming that I can say behold the bridegroom cometh I hear the midnight right amen so he say I I believe I can say so now it's no longer you just reading what we just read the verse say oh behold the bright bright bridegroom cometh this is that messenger that same voice that we heard that the Bible is talking about be uh uh uh let just let just read that again hold on uh and at midnight there was a cry behold the bridegroom cometh that same cry is being said here in the message uniting time he's not even saying oh I I don't I don't think he said I can now say behold the bridegroom cometh I hear the Midnight Cry right amen we we're right at the end of the time my hour oh my the hour we're living in so the bre the cry has been made the message has gone forth right and then what message is he crying he's crying Grace Grace unto and then and another thing too it was at the midnight uh it was at the Midnight Hour right right that the message uh the cry went forth and it's the same thing with the prophet is saying by faith in the message by faith Moses um brother I tell you when Israel got ready at midnight they had everything they had in this world packed up and ready to go God send us a Revival like that we pack up everything and get ready to go the Midnight Cry is a coming go ye out to meet him you better have everything backed up you better not have nothing this world luring you back any strings to hold you down you know the first Exodus what did he do he brought them out of a natural land to a natural land the second Exodus he brought them out from a spiritual condition into a spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost now he's bringing them from the spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost right back into the Eternal land of the Millennium and the great Hereafter same Pillar of Fire it goes back again Same Spirit same body same pill pillow of fire the same pillow of fire that brought the children of Israel out of Egypt is the same that um that is the same that's bringing them from the spiritual baptism right back to Eternal land so that same pill fire that Rapture us right and um by the same anointed system he has to be anointed you know we don't just want any we want an anointed system the same God doing the same things and the same word you know it goes back again to same same God Same Spirit one word you know declare the first word declare the second one so that same word that decare the first word is the same word that's declaring the second one the same word declar the second one has declared the third one and here we see it among us right this is beautiful and uh as I said like I'll finish it with this uh last quot you know what was that he zeru Bell is shouting crying Grace Grace unto it so it's a message of grace and the prophet tells us in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I believe that we are now living in the last day I believe that this is the last message this message of Grace that God has given to his church and I believe that any time Christ could come so we know we know the prophet has told us that this message is the message of Grace you know and um so and then so that's pretty much the the study for tonight uh just emphasizing on you know breaking down the scripture and um going back just in summary you know for uh he said shall bring forth The Headstone therefore thereof with shouting crying Grace Grace unto it you know the prophet say those are types and we just broke it down according to the prophet what the shoutings means you know it's the message going forth crying what message the the bridegroom is coming get ready you know and then Grace Grace unto it know right amen amen you have to receive the message you know because Grace is only Grace if you receive it as Grace right and but pay attention here it says the this message of Grace that that God has given so it's not earned it's a gift we did not Merit you know we did no one earned this Grace you know it's been a free gift given to us by God and we have to receive it so thank you for um being any questions any comments all right all right uh thank you for um I hope this was a blessing and uh we'll just end with a quick uh prayer and then we'll go oh Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you so much father because you have been so thoughtful of us Lord Jesus father you could have just led us being destroyed Lord God just see uh watch The Devil destroying us but Lord you had a plan before the foundation of the world Lord all this was just part of your redemp Redemption plan father and we thank you because you've sent us your message Lord and not just that about you we thank you also because you've given us the grace to receive the word Lord to receive your message father I pray that you help us Lord to to to to get ready Lord because the me the the bridegroom is coming Lord Jesus Lord the Bible says that the Bride made herself ready Lord help us to be ready Lord to meditate on your word Lord and get you know the prophet says we just read here where he says that we need a Revival father but he also explain that a Revival is not bringing more people to the church a Revival father Lord is to get all the trash out of our Lives Lord father May you search our hearts Lord you know us better than we know ourselves Lord may you refine us Lord God and remove all the trash out of our Lives Lord and purify us with the blood of the Lamb Lord the blood of Jesus Christ Lord and bless us as we go on our ways Lord and
