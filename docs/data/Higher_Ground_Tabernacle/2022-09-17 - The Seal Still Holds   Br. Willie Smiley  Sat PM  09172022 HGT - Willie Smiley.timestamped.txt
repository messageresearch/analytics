[54:04] knowing brother sister brooks over 20
[54:07] years they
[54:08] you know i found out that i wasn't the
[54:10] only one that had a lot of kids
[54:12] you know when i met brother brooks and
[54:15] you know we had hair back then
[54:17] and uh now i'll have none
[54:20] and uh brother brooks told me earlier he
[54:22] said i ain't got that brave yet brother
[54:24] smiley
[54:25] just gone do it like you i said it'll be
[54:28] all right i wasn't brave either but i
[54:30] had to do something
[54:32] because uh i couldn't do the little
[54:35] realm thing and uh i had none at the top
[54:38] so
[54:39] i said well you know i hope it's all
[54:42] right but michael jordan made it popular
[54:44] to be bald here

[55:46] nowadays you know uh
[55:50] i was telling some of the saints i said
[55:52] that there was a time when i was kind of

[56:47] want to read a couple of verses out of
[56:49] that and we'll
[56:51] have you to be seated it's the from the
[56:53] 30th verse
[56:55] it says grieve not the holy spirit of
[56:57] god whereby ye are sealed
[56:59] until the day of
[57:01] redemption
[57:03] let all bitterness and wrath and anger
[57:05] and claim and evil speak and be put away
[57:08] from you with all malice

[57:13] heart of forgiving one another even as

[57:21] heavenly father we just come to give
[57:23] thanks and praise
[57:25] oh god uh for just this opportunity to
[57:28] be in the house of the lord
[57:31] tonight and uh we're just trusting that
[57:34] uh you speak to the hearts and the
[57:36] saints of god that have
[57:38] gathered out tonight lord not to
[57:41] just hear from a man but to hear from
[57:43] the throne of god
[57:45] uh feed your people help me to move
[57:47] myself to
[57:48] one side and we'll just be so careful to
[57:50] give you the praise glory now for all
[57:52] things
[57:53] is done and said in jesus name we pray
[57:56] amen amen you may be seated
[57:59] um
[58:01] it's real funny i was waiting on brother
[58:03] brooks in in the lobby of the hotel and
[58:07] uh i had been seeing all these different
[58:09] people
[58:10] uh out and uh one of the guys i guess he
[58:13] saw my bible and everything he asked me
[58:15] well you're gonna be speaking tonight i
[58:17] said well by god's grace and they were
[58:20] having a gideon gideon's uh
[58:24] convention
[58:25] gideon bible people
[58:27] and i said by the grace of god and i you
[58:30] know we was going on and
[58:32] and i i i didn't know what to expect
[58:35] cause i like i said i hadn't been up
[58:37] here but i told him i said you know
[58:40] the bible said whether two or three are
[58:42] gathered in his name they're he'll be in
[58:43] the midst
[58:44] and sometimes people like to preach the
[58:47] big crowds
[58:49] but i find that some of my finest uh
[58:51] sermons have been preached to small
[58:54] small congregations you know
[58:56] we we just we just
[58:58] my title before i get started is
[59:01] uh the seal still holds
[59:04] we we realize
[59:06] we're in uncertain times
[59:09] nothing nothing is certain we we used to
[59:12] have some form of idea about
[59:14] life we could you know maybe 30 40 years
[59:17] ago to try to you know put our life in a
[59:20] certain perspective
[59:22] and and go down a certain road and maybe
[59:25] you work on a job 25 30 years and
[59:28] and after 30 years you could retire but
[59:32] but times is changing now uh we we've
[59:36] just come through
[59:37] for the most part we've come through
[59:39] covet
[59:41] where that caught us all off guard
[59:44] but i believe that it did it never
[59:46] caught god off guard
[59:48] it but it caught humanity out it caught
[59:51] humanity of god and that for me what it
[59:54] really showed
[59:56] was was who who's the true believers
[59:59] because you know we find that and this
[1:00:02] this is everywhere
[1:00:04] this is everywhere uh uh what we find is
[1:00:08] people ain't in church now yeah we can
[1:00:11] go everywhere else this ain't my message
[1:00:13] but y'all bear with me for a moment
[1:00:15] uh uh
[1:00:17] we can do all sorts of things but we've
[1:00:19] lost the desire it seemed like to
[1:00:23] uh serve god
[1:00:25] we find when it comes down to go going
[1:00:28] to work is we find when it comes down to
[1:00:30] time to go feed our face and yeah and do
[1:00:33] recreational things but when it just we
[1:00:36] we've kind of lost something
[1:00:38] over the last couple of years churches
[1:00:42] ain't you know churches ain't what they
[1:00:44] used to be attendance ain't what it used
[1:00:47] to be
[1:00:48] and and i'm i'm just reminded of the
[1:00:50] scriptures the bible says as you see
[1:00:53] that they approach it you know
[1:00:56] fail not assembling yourselves together
[1:00:59] and and you know i'm glad that that you
[1:01:02] know i've been a christian since 1988
[1:01:05] and i just still have those same
[1:01:08] old-fashioned types of values uh brother
[1:01:11] browner makes a statement he says uh
[1:01:13] when a person gets filled with the holy
[1:01:15] ghost they can't hardly wait till the
[1:01:17] church door's open
[1:01:19] but but we we we kind of get we slow
[1:01:21] full and we're dragging and and we feel
[1:01:24] like well i'm gonna be all right i'm
[1:01:25] gonna go in the rapture that way
[1:01:27] somebody's deceiving you
[1:01:30] right and and you know
[1:01:32] uh the scripture says uh
[1:01:34] be not deceived and don't let no man
[1:01:37] deceive you
[1:01:38] and and and don't be deceived by
[1:01:40] yourself um
[1:01:42] uh we we gotta get ourselves in and
[1:01:45] rapture uh rapturing condition
[1:01:49] because we we can see the condition for
[1:01:52] the rapture
[1:01:53] is here
[1:01:55] 30 30 years ago
[1:01:57] the prophet of god he prophesied about
[1:02:00] pressure and a squeeze and things of
[1:02:03] that nature
[1:02:04] it's not coming it's here
[1:02:07] right it it slowly is gradually
[1:02:11] intensifying itself
[1:02:14] and and and this is the hour where so
[1:02:16] important i mean for us to
[1:02:19] really know who we are as individuals is
[1:02:22] is that right
[1:02:23] we you know one of the things i've i've
[1:02:25] uh found we've tried to build revivals
[1:02:29] on
[1:02:29] uh emotion
[1:02:31] and emotionalism and things of that
[1:02:33] nature but what i found is that just
[1:02:36] don't necessarily work we've shouted
[1:02:39] we've shouted in the meetings uh we ran
[1:02:42] around the church i don't know how to do
[1:02:43] that stuff a little as much as i used to
[1:02:46] because i'm a little bit older it takes
[1:02:48] a little bit for me to get out of the
[1:02:49] chair now
[1:02:51] you know i don't got kind of reserved to
[1:02:53] that
[1:02:54] you know but uh air 9 then uh god will
[1:02:58] give me faith to raise up it depends on
[1:03:00] what's being said
[1:03:02] but but you know there was a time where
[1:03:04] we we tried to build we've tried to
[1:03:06] build revivals and ministries on
[1:03:10] excitement and i hope this don't hurt
[1:03:12] nobody's feelings because
[1:03:15] i i i know the quotes and brother bannon
[1:03:17] say anything that's dead neat to be
[1:03:19] buried and and all of that and i i'm all
[1:03:22] for exciting preachers
[1:03:25] because i'm exciting too
[1:03:27] but you know i've matured by being in
[1:03:30] the ministry 30 years and i ain't saying
[1:03:31] that i know it all but but i've watched
[1:03:34] i've watched a lot of things i've
[1:03:36] watched a lot of things happen i've
[1:03:38] watched a lot of uh people come and i
[1:03:40] watched a lot of people go
[1:03:43] and so and so in in doing so
[1:03:46] it
[1:03:47] you have to ask yourself the question
[1:03:50] right uh um
[1:03:52] i believe brother banner makes a
[1:03:54] statement he says you know god will
[1:03:56] never save a man to lose a man
[1:03:59] i believe that
[1:04:01] just just maybe sometimes people go away
[1:04:04] from god don't mean they lost
[1:04:07] right you know sometimes we we have such
[1:04:10] an attitude around around church now
[1:04:14] you know where where we're not loving
[1:04:16] and we're not caring the way that we
[1:04:18] ought to be
[1:04:20] we we're very we're very judgmental
[1:04:23] and and i and i realized with judgmental
[1:04:26] because we're not walking in folk shoes
[1:04:30] see one of the things that i found
[1:04:31] brother brother branham makes a
[1:04:33] statement in the church age book he
[1:04:35] talks about brotherly kindness he said
[1:04:37] real brotherly kindness is is is you
[1:04:40] know kind of uh
[1:04:42] uh if i could paraphrase it is is
[1:04:44] walking in another man's shoes of
[1:04:46] putting yourself in the man's place on
[1:04:49] the matter
[1:04:51] right and see and until and until you do
[1:04:55] that
[1:04:55] you you you really can't judge the
[1:04:58] manner from the outside looking in
[1:05:03] right
[1:05:04] uh because
[1:05:05] placing yourself in the under the
[1:05:07] circumstances and the condition you
[1:05:10] might not be able to make it either
[1:05:13] is that right you know uh just for the
[1:05:16] most part of the year i've just kind of
[1:05:19] had this little thought on my mind and
[1:05:21] and the different places that we've gone
[1:05:24] i've i've kind of approached it and
[1:05:26] things of that nature
[1:05:27] uh uh we we realize that we're emotional
[1:05:30] creatures
[1:05:31] we're we're we're definitely in a battle
[1:05:34] we're not on a picnic
[1:05:36] this this is definitely not a game i'm
[1:05:39] finding that out more and more this let
[1:05:42] me tell you something the battle is real
[1:05:45] right the battle is real we're going
[1:05:48] through some some treacherous waters and
[1:05:51] and unfortunately just the best that is
[1:05:53] going to get this side of the rapture
[1:05:56] it's it's gradually gradually getting
[1:05:59] worse and worse
[1:06:01] uh all the time can we get a witness
[1:06:04] tonight it's it's getting worse and
[1:06:07] worse all the time so we we've gotta i
[1:06:11] guess uh uh enjoy the season that we're
[1:06:14] in
[1:06:15] uh be because it's it's only getting
[1:06:19] it's only getting worse
[1:06:21] i mean who would who would ever thought
[1:06:23] that
[1:06:24] uh uh um we would have saw a war
[1:06:27] over in the ukraine between ukraine and
[1:06:29] russia
[1:06:31] right but you know one of the things
[1:06:33] that i enjoy that in the midst of the
[1:06:36] the war
[1:06:37] that there are some people over there
[1:06:39] still holding on to god's unchanging
[1:06:41] hand
[1:06:42] having having faltered having haven't
[1:06:45] quit i was in a meeting with brother
[1:06:48] barry coffrey
[1:06:49] uh uh a while back early part of the
[1:06:52] year maybe
[1:06:54] and uh he he got direct contact with
[1:06:57] with some of the brothers and this was
[1:06:59] in the early stages of the war and uh
[1:07:03] you know people were dying and people
[1:07:05] were being blowed up and things and it
[1:07:08] was a sunday morning and he was in
[1:07:10] contact with the brothers and and and uh
[1:07:13] one of the brother was saying a lot of
[1:07:15] people were fleeing and the people the
[1:07:17] brethren was saying we ain't going
[1:07:19] nowhere we're gonna try to find
[1:07:20] somewhere where we could come together
[1:07:22] and give god some praise
[1:07:24] is that right
[1:07:25] amen that that takes something in in a
[1:07:28] war-torn country
[1:07:30] in in a time of of of trauma
[1:07:34] at a time of loss
[1:07:36] is that right
[1:07:38] amen to to be able to really come
[1:07:41] together
[1:07:42] and say you know what we instead of
[1:07:44] running we need to come together and
[1:07:46] give god thanks and pray
[1:07:49] because a lot of a lot of people under
[1:07:52] under
[1:07:53] tr and trauma is real
[1:07:56] right
[1:07:57] uh pressure is real
[1:08:00] you know they often used to say when i
[1:08:01] was a kid pressure buster pipe
[1:08:05] right
[1:08:05] i'm a living witness to that
[1:08:08] i'm a because because in the last few
[1:08:11] years
[1:08:12] you know i've gone through things that i
[1:08:14] just never could have even imagined
[1:08:18] 30 years ago
[1:08:20] uh uh as a young convert and as a you
[1:08:23] know a young pastor
[1:08:25] things that things that i've seen in the
[1:08:28] last four years
[1:08:29] man you couldn't even told me that
[1:08:32] right
[1:08:33] but you know i've i've gone through a
[1:08:36] lot of i've suffered
[1:08:39] through a lot of loss and it ain't easy
[1:08:43] right let's not i think i think we have
[1:08:46] this this view of
[1:08:48] christianity as far as i'm concerned
[1:08:50] that's not realistic
[1:08:54] we think it's just shouting
[1:08:56] and jumping and and running the eyes and
[1:08:59] praising the lord and exciting
[1:09:02] that's fine because you know you're
[1:09:05] you're you're in a meeting settings
[1:09:08] and you work yourself up because of the
[1:09:11] meeting settings and sometimes folk want
[1:09:14] to be impressive
[1:09:15] y'all don't preach with me the young
[1:09:18] fellas want to be
[1:09:19] impressive
[1:09:22] we we don't our finest and the young
[1:09:24] sisters they want to be impressive
[1:09:27] but that's not the back
[1:09:30] that's not the war the wars when you
[1:09:33] come home
[1:09:35] right when when you hang your fighters
[1:09:38] in the class
[1:09:41] and and you got to face the devil on the
[1:09:43] battleground
[1:09:45] right that's the real war
[1:09:47] when when you're when you're in a
[1:09:49] psychological and people don't hardly
[1:09:51] talk about this uh uh that much but but
[1:09:55] you know there's a psychological mental
[1:09:59] trauma
[1:10:01] right real real battles real things that
[1:10:04] people are facing
[1:10:07] and
[1:10:08] you know
[1:10:09] sometimes i wonder if we
[1:10:12] god is equipped but i wonder sometimes
[1:10:14] that we equipped to handle
[1:10:16] the the emotional side and the trauma
[1:10:20] that goes along with war
[1:10:23] y'all a lot of preachers
[1:10:25] right we we
[1:10:27] uh i've noticed something we we we
[1:10:30] approached the gospel i'm gonna move on
[1:10:32] but i'm just kind of setting this up and
[1:10:34] i ain't gonna be long
[1:10:36] but um um
[1:10:38] i just wonder sometimes are are we
[1:10:41] equipped
[1:10:43] um
[1:10:45] around the gospel because we
[1:10:48] we we try to base this thing on on being
[1:10:52] uh deep
[1:10:54] and preaching deep sermons and and and
[1:10:58] watching people suffer in church
[1:11:01] and to me you know i've i've changed a
[1:11:04] lot don't mean i i'm you know i don't
[1:11:07] say things to try to hurt anybody and
[1:11:10] ella push somebody down to elevate
[1:11:12] myself but i think sometimes when when
[1:11:15] we stand back and we we watch
[1:11:17] we watch um um christian them we we try
[1:11:20] to we try to pass everything off on the
[1:11:23] people like well just maybe they didn't
[1:11:26] this and just
[1:11:27] just maybe sometimes we weren't equipped
[1:11:29] to handle people's amen needs and
[1:11:32] problems
[1:11:34] and it's not it's not that things are
[1:11:36] not in the word but
[1:11:39] you know we i think we we've got we we
[1:11:41] got 66 books and we got a message
[1:11:45] right and and
[1:11:46] and
[1:11:47] because of that i think sometimes we we
[1:11:50] realize well you know this is our claim
[1:11:53] to fame well we got more than those dead
[1:11:55] birds
[1:11:57] y'all know our talk y'all know our
[1:11:59] attitudes as it relates to the
[1:12:01] nomination of people we don't put
[1:12:03] anybody in hell brother branham never
[1:12:06] did do that
[1:12:08] brother better never put these people
[1:12:10] with denominations in hell
[1:12:13] right it'll be it'll be people because i
[1:12:15] believe it's been people
[1:12:17] you know they might have been older
[1:12:19] people that would seal up on their
[1:12:20] pentecostal revival
[1:12:23] come on
[1:12:24] come on i believe that
[1:12:26] that'll never that'll never come to the
[1:12:28] word of god my my grandmother said in my
[1:12:31] church
[1:12:33] maybe once
[1:12:34] but i know she had a genuine seal of the
[1:12:37] holy ghost
[1:12:39] under the height of the pentecostal
[1:12:41] revival and i believe that when the
[1:12:44] resurrection takes place
[1:12:46] she'll be there
[1:12:48] i think i think i'll see her
[1:12:52] before i meet him i think i'll see her
[1:12:55] right uh uh so so
[1:12:59] you know
[1:13:00] but
[1:13:02] you know we're living we're living in an
[1:13:04] age where
[1:13:06] where i think we got to be spiritually
[1:13:08] equipped because it's it's unlike any
[1:13:11] age that we've ever lived in
[1:13:14] this age that we're
[1:13:15] because every everything from the time
[1:13:18] of adam down through the entire old
[1:13:22] testament
[1:13:23] right on down to seven church ages of
[1:13:25] the new testament and everything has
[1:13:28] been content condensed down to this age
[1:13:31] that we're living in
[1:13:33] this this layout of seeing age where
[1:13:35] where it's it's it's dark
[1:13:38] preach that now i need to get cell phone
[1:13:40] i got one and and will not leave mine
[1:13:43] home either
[1:13:48] but but what it has done it has made
[1:13:51] it the access into those other rooms so
[1:13:56] accessible
[1:13:58] where where you know back when we were
[1:14:01] coming up you had to
[1:14:03] really go out of your way in order to
[1:14:06] come in contact and get things that's
[1:14:09] right now at the push of a button
[1:14:14] amen so it's making it things so easy
[1:14:18] for our children
[1:14:20] you know i ain't against cell phones but
[1:14:22] sometimes i think parents when you go
[1:14:25] get your your children
[1:14:27] uh these phones with full access to
[1:14:30] everything i think you're setting them
[1:14:31] up for a drive-by
[1:14:34] is that right give them if they got to
[1:14:36] have a phone give them a phone but they
[1:14:38] ain't got to have access because she see
[1:14:41] when when when you give it to him like
[1:14:44] that then you can't monitor it
[1:14:47] you know the things that people do you
[1:14:49] know
[1:14:50] uh when ain't they think ain't nobody
[1:14:52] watching
[1:14:54] right y'all oughta preach with me
[1:14:55] somebody
[1:14:56] right access so so if it makes it makes
[1:15:01] this generation
[1:15:03] man uh really difficult
[1:15:06] just the pressures
[1:15:09] the
[1:15:10] the the need to keep up with the joneses
[1:15:16] he got a lexus then
[1:15:18] man then i'm gonna go get a mercedes
[1:15:22] no didn't he get a mercedes but i'm
[1:15:24] going to get a bentley
[1:15:26] y'all out of preaching with me come on
[1:15:28] that's that's just the the age that this
[1:15:31] satan is eating that's just the age
[1:15:33] that's just the
[1:15:34] look at the mindset
[1:15:38] and just look how the religious world
[1:15:41] uh uh has has propped up sin and placed
[1:15:45] sin because of
[1:15:46] and and i'm all for social media
[1:15:50] right but to a certain degree look at
[1:15:52] the detriment
[1:15:54] because everybody everybody's now has an
[1:15:57] opinion
[1:15:59] has an opinion about a lot of times
[1:16:01] things that they don't even fully
[1:16:03] understand they ain't even fully
[1:16:05] grasping and then you know uh we we have
[1:16:09] you know our young people feeding and
[1:16:12] you are what you eat
[1:16:15] is that right i think even me
[1:16:18] with my children i i think want to
[1:16:22] and and like you say hindsight is 2020
[1:16:25] and and you know you don't want to be
[1:16:28] considered legalistic and things of that
[1:16:30] nature and i eased up at a certain
[1:16:34] junction when my children became a
[1:16:36] certain age i thought that you know they
[1:16:39] grew up under my ministry
[1:16:41] y'all don't talk to me
[1:16:44] and and i just think that they they fed
[1:16:47] on
[1:16:48] enough word that that they could handle
[1:16:51] things and that they could rightly
[1:16:53] divide things they could
[1:16:57] they
[1:16:57] they could
[1:16:59] they they could
[1:17:01] you know as as
[1:17:02] as spiritual
[1:17:04] as spiritual as as i thought they were
[1:17:08] in church and around church i realized
[1:17:12] you know and and i'm saying this y'all
[1:17:14] just hold on for a minute
[1:17:16] y'all might not shout tonight but y'all
[1:17:18] gonna hear some word tonight
[1:17:20] i can guarantee you that much
[1:17:22] uh uh uh
[1:17:24] you know
[1:17:25] you you you would
[1:17:27] would have thought that they were but
[1:17:29] you know mentally they weren't developed
[1:17:32] enough that's right
[1:17:34] and even now
[1:17:36] sometimes at
[1:17:38] 30
[1:17:39] they mentally ain't developed enough
[1:17:42] y'all gotta talk to me somebody
[1:17:45] you know i'm 60 years old
[1:17:48] right i'm 60 years old and and
[1:17:51] you know i realize
[1:17:54] in certain areas i haven't grown i
[1:17:57] haven't developed
[1:17:58] preach the gospel preach the perfection
[1:18:00] of the word of god
[1:18:02] uh but that's a gift
[1:18:05] that's a gift that's god dropping you
[1:18:08] down something and saying i go out and
[1:18:10] express this
[1:18:11] right
[1:18:12] but but then sometimes you you
[1:18:15] you you sit back and and
[1:18:18] you know
[1:18:19] you you look at your life in the mirror
[1:18:22] of the word of god and then sometimes
[1:18:24] when you hear certain things and you
[1:18:26] analyze and you look at your life you
[1:18:28] realize well i'm in kind of rough shape
[1:18:31] rougher than i thought
[1:18:33] come on
[1:18:35] because every every you know
[1:18:37] every everybody you know
[1:18:42] it's easy to learn praise the lord god
[1:18:44] bless you
[1:18:46] hugs and and think right we walk a
[1:18:49] certain way we carry ourself away and
[1:18:52] and not just christianizing anybody but
[1:18:56] there's still a lot you just watch it
[1:18:59] are still a level of immaturity
[1:19:04] right
[1:19:05] uh we used to sing a song back home
[1:19:08] right
[1:19:09] it takes a lifetime
[1:19:12] right
[1:19:13] uh i think that's why they give people
[1:19:15] this lifetime achievement award
[1:19:18] for for
[1:19:20] not not just maybe one film you were in
[1:19:24] but for for
[1:19:26] years and years and years of
[1:19:28] accomplishments
[1:19:31] and and i think it it takes
[1:19:33] it really takes
[1:19:35] years and years and years and years and
[1:19:40] years amen to grow to a place where
[1:19:42] god's say man i'm pleased with that
[1:19:46] i'm pleased
[1:19:48] i'm pleased with with what i see
[1:19:51] because
[1:19:52] you know
[1:19:53] we
[1:19:54] we we we say we ready for a rapture
[1:19:58] but then it's such a such division
[1:20:02] right
[1:20:03] it's it's such divisions and we have all
[1:20:06] sorts of things that that's
[1:20:09] you know kind of in the way
[1:20:12] right
[1:20:13] that that we can't pass through a
[1:20:15] thinking man's filter
[1:20:18] right because only only only the world
[1:20:23] right everything else everything else
[1:20:26] get get hung up right but but you can
[1:20:29] pass the word through a thinking man's
[1:20:32] filter go back and read it now i'm just
[1:20:33] talking
[1:20:35] right
[1:20:36] glory to god
[1:20:38] and then so so
[1:20:40] i think w
[1:20:42] we've been emotional
[1:20:44] and i but but in our emotions i think
[1:20:47] sometimes is where i lose the battle i
[1:20:50] can i can talk about me
[1:20:53] in in the midst of
[1:20:54] of of sometimes i want to do i have
[1:20:57] spiritual
[1:20:58] ptsd
[1:21:01] because
[1:21:02] a lot of bombs has been shot at me a lot
[1:21:04] of a lot of things has been shot at me a
[1:21:07] lot of things that's been said about me
[1:21:10] over the years that
[1:21:12] uh sometimes i i just
[1:21:14] think
[1:21:16] you know i just think like wow god uh
[1:21:20] and and and it's it's no sense to me
[1:21:22] asking god well why me well why not you
[1:21:26] he said if i suffer in this flesh then
[1:21:29] arm yourself likewise
[1:21:31] and and unfortunately that wasn't really
[1:21:34] real to me
[1:21:36] until the last few years it's like
[1:21:38] man
[1:21:39] you know
[1:21:41] because because
[1:21:42] uh power without character is satanic
[1:21:48] see
[1:21:49] and and we we we
[1:21:52] i ain't gonna quote this right because
[1:21:54] things is coming i don't have the
[1:21:55] greatest memory uh anymore
[1:21:58] but um you know brother branham talked
[1:22:01] about
[1:22:02] uh the love of god and things of that
[1:22:04] nature and people feeling like well you
[1:22:06] know make just maybe god don't really
[1:22:08] love me but it's kind of like
[1:22:11] he was talking on the line of elective
[1:22:13] love is where i'm
[1:22:15] alluded to
[1:22:17] uh uh it and it's not that it's not like
[1:22:20] god is not gonna just allow us to go
[1:22:23] through things
[1:22:25] no he's gonna because because if if
[1:22:28] you're carnal
[1:22:30] you you you'll look at the dark ages and
[1:22:33] like
[1:22:33] like one fellow did like how could a god
[1:22:37] that's so loving
[1:22:38] allow all of these people to be put to
[1:22:41] death
[1:22:42] you you you can't really comprehend
[1:22:44] those things carnally
[1:22:47] right carly
[1:22:48] why would a god so love loving
[1:22:52] allowed these people mothers
[1:22:55] right
[1:22:56] babies cut out and
[1:22:58] the things that brother branham
[1:23:00] described in the churches book
[1:23:03] and but if you're carnal you would look
[1:23:06] at those events and be like how could a
[1:23:09] god
[1:23:10] but an elective love is not
[1:23:14] not that god is not going to allow you
[1:23:16] to go through things but god is with you
[1:23:20] in the midst
[1:23:22] is that right i i kind of i kind of like
[1:23:24] the song that that that marvin sapp
[1:23:27] saying never would have made it
[1:23:30] i'm starting to feel like something i
[1:23:32] don't know about y'all
[1:23:34] never could have made it
[1:23:37] without
[1:23:39] somebody know what i'm talking about
[1:23:42] i would have lost
[1:23:44] come on
[1:23:46] see i never see i wouldn't be here in
[1:23:50] iowa tonight
[1:23:52] if it wasn't for god
[1:23:56] because because i've been so low as a
[1:24:00] christian
[1:24:00] what i've been so low i've been so down
[1:24:04] as a christian and still preaching
[1:24:09] my world turned upside down and still
[1:24:13] preaching
[1:24:16] still still feeling good
[1:24:20] that's just the anointing on me
[1:24:23] but when no anointing is on me that's a
[1:24:25] whole nother story
[1:24:28] it it it shows that it had to be be
[1:24:31] something that that's greater than
[1:24:34] some humanistic something is greater
[1:24:37] than
[1:24:38] uh because in my in my emotions in my
[1:24:41] emotions i've wanted to quit
[1:24:45] emotionally
[1:24:47] right you said what brother brought him
[1:24:50] too
[1:24:52] when god when
[1:24:53] what was that
[1:24:55] when when god took his wife and his baby
[1:25:01] right we're talking about a prophet now
[1:25:03] we talking about a man with a greater
[1:25:05] gift than what i got this right a man
[1:25:08] that would a man that had discernment
[1:25:11] and and and saw all sorts of signs
[1:25:14] wonders and miracles went around the
[1:25:17] world seven times
[1:25:20] you know was used to
[1:25:21] break open the word of god
[1:25:24] right and this man in his emotions tried
[1:25:28] to commit suicide what
[1:25:30] y'all ought to preach with me up in here
[1:25:32] huh
[1:25:33] see we we
[1:25:35] we forget these things
[1:25:38] right but i preach appreciate the
[1:25:41] transparency
[1:25:45] all right
[1:25:47] because see you know if it's suffering
[1:25:49] like
[1:25:51] look at the many people that suffering
[1:25:53] in silence
[1:25:55] right
[1:25:57] amen
[1:25:58] when folk need to know you're not alone
[1:26:02] karen clark said you're not alone you're
[1:26:04] not alone you're not alone you're not
[1:26:06] alive
[1:26:08] you're not alone
[1:26:11] you're not by yourself
[1:26:14] see if somebody is somebody suffering
[1:26:18] around the corner
[1:26:20] somebody going through down the street
[1:26:24] some some somebody's you know going
[1:26:27] through something in their emotions
[1:26:29] somebody's feel like quit you're not
[1:26:31] alone
[1:26:33] you thank god for the transparency
[1:26:37] see we liking all this
[1:26:44] but to me that's a facade
[1:26:48] that's that's a facade even brother
[1:26:49] branham used to see that when when when
[1:26:52] the pentecostals would work up the music
[1:26:54] and things of that nature
[1:26:56] right but that's a facade
[1:26:59] because when you start stop jumping on
[1:27:01] one leg who are you
[1:27:07] where's your victory
[1:27:11] i'm still preaching y'all i'm gonna get
[1:27:13] the way i want to go you say how did
[1:27:15] this what this got to do with what he
[1:27:18] his subject
[1:27:20] it has everything to do with with where
[1:27:22] i'm going
[1:27:23] right because
[1:27:25] you don't want people to have this
[1:27:27] unrealistic
[1:27:28] uh view of christianity
[1:27:31] and be disappointed win the bride
[1:27:38] how much of that is real revelation
[1:27:42] we work people up into a frenzy and like
[1:27:45] i say i don't you know i want you want
[1:27:48] for preachers to preach however god give
[1:27:50] it to him right
[1:27:52] that that ain't even what i'm saying
[1:27:53] because i i like for people to be
[1:27:54] screaming and hollering and shouting and
[1:27:56] jumping on chairs when i'm preaching but
[1:27:59] after after you know almost 30 years of
[1:28:02] preaching
[1:28:04] man i'm i'm changing just a little bit
[1:28:06] it don't really move me the same way
[1:28:09] it it really don't move me the same way
[1:28:12] uh
[1:28:13] because you still see uh sick people in
[1:28:16] church
[1:28:19] right not not just
[1:28:21] not just physical
[1:28:23] but but on other realms people people
[1:28:27] are hurting
[1:28:30] right people people are hurting in
[1:28:33] church
[1:28:34] and and
[1:28:35] that to me is just as much important
[1:28:38] as the natural body
[1:28:42] because the bible says he worship of all
[1:28:44] things that we are prosper and be in
[1:28:46] health
[1:28:48] right
[1:28:49] and and
[1:28:51] having
[1:28:52] a healthy body is one thing
[1:28:54] but having a healthy mind and spirit is
[1:28:57] on a whole nother level
[1:29:00] right
[1:29:02] because because if we're not healthy
[1:29:04] there it affects our human body
[1:29:09] the human psyche
[1:29:11] it affects our our human body
[1:29:15] right
[1:29:16] so so we we want we want for me
[1:29:20] now this this you know to me this sermon
[1:29:23] is so personal
[1:29:25] it ain't even about nobody
[1:29:27] right it ain't even i'm just kind of
[1:29:29] sharing just a little bit of of what
[1:29:33] i've experienced
[1:29:36] over the last few years
[1:29:38] an emotional roller coaster
[1:29:42] right
[1:29:43] there there's times there's times where
[1:29:45] man i just didn't feel like but
[1:29:48] something down on the inside of me kept
[1:29:50] telling me to go ahead
[1:29:53] it was something that was greater than
[1:29:56] me
[1:29:57] taking me to church
[1:30:01] taking my emotionalist
[1:30:04] body to church say you got to go you got
[1:30:07] to go you got to go get on up put your
[1:30:09] clothes on get dressed the way that you
[1:30:12] that you always done
[1:30:15] get up and go
[1:30:17] god got a word for you
[1:30:22] in my emotions it's like man
[1:30:26] i'm drained
[1:30:28] i'm tired
[1:30:30] i you know i'm
[1:30:31] tired of folks
[1:30:35] tired of religious folk
[1:30:38] pretense
[1:30:40] right
[1:30:42] longing
[1:30:43] longing for genuineness
[1:30:46] but
[1:30:47] here's the thing though we have to we
[1:30:50] have to be careful trying to critique
[1:30:52] everybody
[1:30:54] because because everybody's going
[1:30:56] through on their own
[1:30:58] everybody's everybody's got that little
[1:31:00] something that they's going they're
[1:31:01] going through that they don't really
[1:31:03] want nobody to know
[1:31:06] right
[1:31:07] so
[1:31:08] you know you you you can't put you can't
[1:31:10] put it on that you just got to look at
[1:31:12] jesus christ
[1:31:15] right amen and like like i say
[1:31:18] just having this
[1:31:20] real emotional
[1:31:22] and you you'll never win that war
[1:31:26] you you're
[1:31:28] a reasoning battle
[1:31:30] and and why me
[1:31:32] and why it is
[1:31:33] and trying to have hindsight you'll
[1:31:37] never win that battle
[1:31:39] you'll never you you could never win
[1:31:41] look at eve
[1:31:43] e look at look look look eve had the
[1:31:46] perfect work the perfect interpretation
[1:31:49] of the word
[1:31:50] she didn't even have to keep what we got
[1:31:53] to keep
[1:31:55] right
[1:31:57] hey man but but she tried she tried to
[1:32:00] enter into
[1:32:02] an uh uh
[1:32:04] a battle with the devil on reasoning
[1:32:08] she lost it bitterly she lost it
[1:32:11] bitterly
[1:32:12] all
[1:32:13] all she had to do
[1:32:15] right and i'm saying something
[1:32:17] see if if we if we're going to be
[1:32:19] victorious in this hour it it can't be
[1:32:23] through our reasoning and imaginations
[1:32:27] and all of that you can't sit back and
[1:32:29] try to analyze and why this and you know
[1:32:33] listen i've had i had a whole church
[1:32:35] walk out and leave me
[1:32:41] and
[1:32:42] even challenging folk on what you preach
[1:32:46] knowing it was the word
[1:32:49] could you
[1:32:50] let me show you something look at look
[1:32:52] at the prophet samuel when when he he
[1:32:56] bringing the people the word they had
[1:32:58] victory
[1:33:00] israel israel was victorious
[1:33:04] right they had grace they had god and
[1:33:07] they missed
[1:33:08] god was speaking through a prophet but
[1:33:11] they got looking at
[1:33:13] the world
[1:33:15] said boy we want us a king
[1:33:20] we we want us king just we want to be
[1:33:24] like them
[1:33:25] and we got to be careful
[1:33:29] i know we got kirk franklin y'all want
[1:33:31] to talk to me i know all the artists i
[1:33:33] might be 60 but i'm i'm not antiquated
[1:33:38] come on i'm still young at heart
[1:33:42] you know i try to keep my young swagger
[1:33:45] and all that
[1:33:47] you know i mean i'm getting 60 but
[1:33:50] you you won't be able to tell it
[1:33:53] until i sit too long
[1:33:56] right i
[1:33:58] i try to try to i don't try to look like
[1:33:59] no antique box and all of that
[1:34:02] you know i try to keep up with it
[1:34:04] y'all young fellas y'all ain't y'all
[1:34:06] ain't doing that
[1:34:08] i stay right with y'all
[1:34:10] all right so i you got to say that
[1:34:12] brother bruce they kind of keep it with
[1:34:13] you you know they feel like you know
[1:34:16] i i enjoy that i enjoy the young swag
[1:34:19] too
[1:34:20] you know
[1:34:21] just but but we got we just have to be
[1:34:23] careful
[1:34:24] you know look at looking at all of those
[1:34:26] things
[1:34:28] that that we don't allow these things to
[1:34:30] kind of cross over
[1:34:32] is that right
[1:34:33] because because the prophet he was like
[1:34:36] could you imagine working with a group
[1:34:37] of people
[1:34:38] and then all of a sudden they say
[1:34:40] well we want another man
[1:34:43] we want another man to lead us like
[1:34:46] really
[1:34:49] watch watch the emotion
[1:34:51] the emotional battle he had
[1:34:54] right he was like wait a minute huh
[1:34:59] hold up
[1:35:01] and then and then you start questing and
[1:35:04] questioning yourself
[1:35:06] right and then you ask them
[1:35:08] you ask them the question
[1:35:11] have i have i ever stole
[1:35:13] have i ever slept with anybody wise
[1:35:16] have i ever
[1:35:17] cheated
[1:35:18] rob
[1:35:20] what is it
[1:35:22] it was nothing he did
[1:35:26] sometimes you can give people your very
[1:35:29] best
[1:35:31] and it ain't good enough
[1:35:35] you sweat
[1:35:37] blood and tears
[1:35:42] right
[1:35:43] but when it ain't good enough you just
[1:35:44] got to come to the grip to grips i'm
[1:35:47] good though
[1:35:50] huh
[1:35:51] when when you when listen you say well
[1:35:53] this don't mean nothing keep living
[1:35:56] this you know what i tell the younger
[1:35:58] generation keep having birthdays
[1:36:01] keep keep living
[1:36:03] right amen you know get married
[1:36:07] and all these different things and then
[1:36:10] in another 20 years you come back and
[1:36:12] talk to brother smiley about the battles
[1:36:15] that you've been in
[1:36:17] huh a lot of times folks folks think
[1:36:20] when they walk down the house looking
[1:36:22] good and they white well i was clean on
[1:36:24] my wedding day
[1:36:26] oh i was a little slimmer
[1:36:29] i had on all white that they forced me
[1:36:32] to wear
[1:36:33] but i was looking good big bridal party
[1:36:37] man me and my wife she
[1:36:39] whoo
[1:36:43] but 29 years down the line
[1:36:47] right
[1:36:49] and and and
[1:36:51] in in a battle of of
[1:36:56] all sorts of things
[1:36:59] right because it's real
[1:37:01] come on now
[1:37:05] see
[1:37:06] this this ain't
[1:37:08] the day you walk up up oh that ain't
[1:37:11] that the devil that you had that part
[1:37:15] it's it's when you get he'll even let
[1:37:17] you go on
[1:37:18] honeymoon but it's when you get home
[1:37:21] where he started to work but then
[1:37:22] sometimes i've heard of him
[1:37:24] starting right after they said i do
[1:37:28] i went to a wedding i went
[1:37:31] this was this was in my days when i was
[1:37:34] not a christian
[1:37:36] i went to a wedding
[1:37:38] or one of my best friends his sister
[1:37:40] married a guy that she
[1:37:42] she
[1:37:43] used to date he had got out of prison
[1:37:45] and all that they kind of got together
[1:37:47] and they got married and man we you know
[1:37:50] like y'all you know
[1:37:52] we throw down that night
[1:37:54] we danced we we parted i ain't always
[1:37:57] wear suit y'all so don't don't condemn
[1:37:59] me nobody
[1:38:01] right i i used to cut the food
[1:38:04] and and
[1:38:06] by morning
[1:38:09] by morning it was a wrap
[1:38:14] i'ma say that again y'all didn't get
[1:38:16] that
[1:38:17] by morning
[1:38:19] it was over
[1:38:21] they didn't even make it to the
[1:38:22] honeymoon it was done
[1:38:25] right
[1:38:27] but but what what that shows you what
[1:38:30] that shows you is the force
[1:38:34] the
[1:38:35] force
[1:38:37] i'ma say that again
[1:38:39] the
[1:38:40] force
[1:38:41] that's against marriage because the
[1:38:45] bible says they'll be marrying and
[1:38:47] giving in marriage
[1:38:49] why
[1:38:50] because there will be a force
[1:38:54] see
[1:38:55] listen there was a force in eden
[1:39:00] come on
[1:39:02] right
[1:39:03] because god watch this god created
[1:39:07] a masterpiece in in the garden of eden
[1:39:10] right that that was a union that that
[1:39:14] was a that was a oneness that was a that
[1:39:16] was a harmony go back to the oneness
[1:39:18] message
[1:39:19] in the garden of eden
[1:39:23] a perfect example of of of a union
[1:39:28] and brother branham's brother branham in
[1:39:30] the oneness message he talked he he said
[1:39:33] man when you can see father and mother
[1:39:35] and children
[1:39:36] all in one accord he said what a picture
[1:39:41] what what a what a picture
[1:39:44] you know the fan family what i call them
[1:39:48] y'all know what i'm talking about
[1:39:49] if you if you if you you
[1:39:51] african-american you just seen it on
[1:39:54] plenty of fans
[1:39:56] the husband
[1:39:58] you know the husband and the wife and
[1:40:00] the children
[1:40:02] standing in standing in front of the
[1:40:04] church
[1:40:05] you know they don't your sisters don't
[1:40:07] wear hats no more but they got the hats
[1:40:10] leaning
[1:40:11] with the gloves y'all don't know nothing
[1:40:12] about this if you young this is when i
[1:40:14] was coming up in the baptist church
[1:40:17] i remember the days when my grandmother
[1:40:19] used to go out with her hat tilted with
[1:40:21] her gloves and her pocketbook but you go
[1:40:24] out and you see you know the man and his
[1:40:26] and it was about family
[1:40:29] i'm telling it breaks my heart
[1:40:32] right it it broke my heart to see my
[1:40:35] family walk away from the world
[1:40:38] right
[1:40:39] because because i just thought that man
[1:40:44] let me tell you something i have a
[1:40:46] gifted family
[1:40:48] my children sing
[1:40:51] they play they don't play edit they play
[1:40:55] right good my son my oldest son is a
[1:40:58] tremendous musician
[1:41:00] he can preach
[1:41:03] right he's educating his intellectual
[1:41:06] his his his his way of thinking
[1:41:09] right
[1:41:11] uh
[1:41:12] my youngest two they play bass lead my
[1:41:15] baby boy one played a couple play drums
[1:41:17] my daughter
[1:41:19] has had a a full ride to college for
[1:41:22] singing
[1:41:24] her voice
[1:41:27] my other son
[1:41:28] you know he kind of looks slid back a
[1:41:30] little bit i want to say bachelor
[1:41:32] kind of went back a little bit
[1:41:34] sing
[1:41:36] right my wife
[1:41:38] sings and play
[1:41:41] that there was a time where where
[1:41:44] she got all the accolades
[1:41:46] everybody knew my wife for playing music
[1:41:50] when when it wasn't these guys
[1:41:54] come on
[1:41:55] when when you didn't hardly see
[1:41:58] a generation that can get on the
[1:42:00] instruments and do anything with them
[1:42:03] they call her
[1:42:04] can we get sister smiley to come come to
[1:42:07] the meetings and play for the meetings
[1:42:10] all of them songs that you hear of
[1:42:13] sister lewis and sister burrows and some
[1:42:16] of them brother brooke sing
[1:42:18] that that's my wife choreographing the
[1:42:21] music and all of that kind of stuff i
[1:42:23] think that's the right word
[1:42:26] right put putting the tunes in they they
[1:42:29] come up with the words
[1:42:31] uh a drop in the bucket
[1:42:34] brother brooks know what i'm talking
[1:42:35] about he sung that song that
[1:42:37] my wife never put that that that that
[1:42:40] tune and stuff to sister lewis knew cool
[1:42:43] right
[1:42:44] but they couldn't they right
[1:42:49] so kind of to see
[1:42:51] to see the
[1:42:53] the
[1:42:54] reality
[1:42:56] right
[1:42:57] the reality
[1:42:58] how much time that i got
[1:43:00] the reality
[1:43:02] of what
[1:43:03] war
[1:43:04] can do
[1:43:06] right
[1:43:07] there was a reason why brother branham
[1:43:09] preached spiritual amnesia
[1:43:13] right
[1:43:15] see
[1:43:17] the more and more i preach
[1:43:19] and grow and mature the more and more i
[1:43:22] realize what he preached
[1:43:25] had to be preached
[1:43:28] needed to be preached
[1:43:29] for the season that we're in
[1:43:33] right
[1:43:34] when when when people
[1:43:37] when people
[1:43:39] have gone through battles
[1:43:41] of
[1:43:42] such
[1:43:43] epic proportion
[1:43:46] right
[1:43:47] but but i like one of the stories he
[1:43:49] told about the young fella
[1:43:51] it's it's just
[1:43:52] sometimes getting them back in familiar
[1:43:54] territory
[1:43:57] right
[1:44:00] they got this young man and and you know
[1:44:02] they stopped off a little bit and
[1:44:06] he recognized something
[1:44:10] and and he started walking
[1:44:12] he started see they didn't realize he
[1:44:15] was coming to himself
[1:44:17] he was
[1:44:18] he was not like himself
[1:44:22] but but but when they pulled up
[1:44:25] god god was a sovereign god
[1:44:28] that story had to be told i felt i felt
[1:44:31] all glory on that
[1:44:33] that story had to be told
[1:44:36] so so that we could hear it
[1:44:39] a man that was struggling
[1:44:43] right that didn't struggle
[1:44:46] once upon a time didn't have the
[1:44:48] problems that he had amen once upon a
[1:44:52] time
[1:44:53] now struggling
[1:44:55] with his identity
[1:44:57] is that right and and the sovereignty of
[1:45:01] god
[1:45:02] right
[1:45:04] it could only be god
[1:45:07] putting him at the right place at the
[1:45:09] right time in the right season
[1:45:15] right
[1:45:18] the season was right
[1:45:20] the time was right
[1:45:22] the stop
[1:45:24] was on time
[1:45:27] huh cause they could have bypassed that
[1:45:29] stop
[1:45:31] and and if they would have bypassed that
[1:45:33] stop he probably never the rest of his
[1:45:36] life would have ever come to himself
[1:45:39] but because god is god
[1:45:42] and his word is everlasting
[1:45:45] amen god had predestinated for them to
[1:45:49] stop
[1:45:50] right when they stop
[1:45:55] right because god be working on both
[1:45:57] ends

[1:46:31] i don't care what it looked like i don't
[1:46:33] care what they saying
[1:46:36] it's it was based upon what he believed
[1:46:39] he knew listen
[1:46:41] son got off the train and he started
[1:46:43] walking
[1:46:46] and they were going to stop it
[1:46:48] show you how how god's
[1:46:50] how real god has got one one fella said
[1:46:54] don't
[1:46:55] let's just follow him
[1:46:57] let's just follow him
[1:46:59] see
[1:47:00] things start looking familiar to him
[1:47:04] like i know something about this place
[1:47:08] order my steps in your word dear lord
[1:47:16] god me
[1:47:18] every
[1:47:19] day
[1:47:21] god was ordering his steps
[1:47:23] going down a little path he would start
[1:47:25] remembering
[1:47:26] there's a little path over here
[1:47:29] that he probably traveled as a little
[1:47:30] boy
[1:47:32] that that
[1:47:34] him and daddy traveled daddy got his
[1:47:36] hand and they
[1:47:38] huh
[1:47:40] familiar
[1:47:41] things becoming more clear
[1:47:45] god walked them right home
[1:47:47] daddy stood out there daddy stood out
[1:47:50] that way boy y'all could say what you
[1:47:52] want to say i knew
[1:47:54] that my boy was coming back home
[1:47:57] uh
[1:47:59] that's the kind of god we sing the song
[1:48:02] all the time but we don't believe it
[1:48:04] what almighty god we serve
[1:48:09] but but
[1:48:10] give me 10 minutes and i'll wind up
[1:48:14] you know i i said all that
[1:48:17] for a reason to kind of maybe get who i
[1:48:19] thought
[1:48:20] a little bit
[1:48:21] uh
[1:48:22] like i say we we i've gone through some
[1:48:25] some real low times
[1:48:28] over the years preached
[1:48:31] operate sung
[1:48:31] because that's who i am
[1:48:34] that's what that that's what's familiar
[1:48:37] to me
[1:48:39] but
[1:48:40] you know one day i was i was i was just
[1:48:42] kind of
[1:48:44] listening to a tape sometimes sometimes
[1:48:46] that's
[1:48:47] you know you have to get away sometimes
[1:48:49] and i get in my car and i go for a ride
[1:48:51] sometimes i ain't even really going
[1:48:53] nowhere maybe might go to lunch throwing
[1:48:55] a tape
[1:48:57] and uh
[1:48:59] i was i was uh
[1:49:01] i was
[1:49:03] kind of low in the spirit
[1:49:05] but but god god is a good god
[1:49:08] let me let me let me let me let me just
[1:49:10] tell you something
[1:49:11] there's no way that you could journey
[1:49:13] with god
[1:49:15] and he won't feed you
[1:49:19] come on
[1:49:20] that there's there's no way that you
[1:49:23] could be on a journey with god
[1:49:26] amen and you got to be sit the way
[1:49:28] hungry
[1:49:30] huh
[1:49:31] amen you look at the prophet he
[1:49:33] journeyed with god god said you know
[1:49:35] what i'll sustain you just go over there
[1:49:37] by that brook
[1:49:38] and when that dried up don't worry about
[1:49:41] i got somewhere else you to go you ain't
[1:49:43] gonna starve with god
[1:49:45] right no matter no matter how much
[1:49:48] there's a drought we know what's been
[1:49:50] stored up
[1:49:52] is that right glory to god that that
[1:49:54] might be a drought for the world but
[1:49:56] that's not a drought for the bride
[1:49:59] we're still being inspired
[1:50:02] is that right
[1:50:04] that was a multitude that was traveling
[1:50:07] with jesus
[1:50:08] just amen feeding on the word of god but
[1:50:11] then they would get got naturally hungry
[1:50:14] into the disciples you know they was
[1:50:16] like man we better say need people
[1:50:18] back home it's a lot of folk
[1:50:22] you ever had a dinner
[1:50:23] now the wise know what i'm talking about
[1:50:26] the most embarrassing thing it is is to
[1:50:28] have a bunch of folks that feel like
[1:50:30] you're gonna run out of food
[1:50:32] huh
[1:50:33] uh
[1:50:35] as that when they looked around it was
[1:50:36] nothing
[1:50:38] they could they couldn't see nothing
[1:50:41] right jesus said why are you going to
[1:50:42] send the people back
[1:50:44] for what
[1:50:46] it's the sovereignty of god
[1:50:49] because because see it's totally
[1:50:51] impossible to travel with him and he
[1:50:53] don't feed you
[1:50:55] right look at the children of israel
[1:50:57] amen on the will of this journey he fed
[1:51:00] him
[1:51:02] right amen he he gave them food in
[1:51:05] season
[1:51:06] you know he he gave them what they could
[1:51:09] handle
[1:51:11] right they they got so lifted up
[1:51:14] they got so lifted up eating eating the
[1:51:16] manor but we we you know y'all know how
[1:51:18] people live we we just tired of this
[1:51:22] you know
[1:51:25] we we just it's so simple
[1:51:29] this this church folk for you brother
[1:51:30] bro
[1:51:32] that's so simple we just we just tired
[1:51:35] of
[1:51:37] this
[1:51:40] why you need the holy ghost
[1:51:42] because you ain't got it
[1:51:46] because you ain't got it
[1:51:49] right
[1:51:51] we
[1:51:52] we want meat
[1:51:56] and you know what god realized
[1:51:59] i'm gonna get i'm gonna give them
[1:52:00] something
[1:52:02] because sometimes
[1:52:04] watch this
[1:52:05] sometimes god gives us
[1:52:07] things that he know we ain't ready for
[1:52:10] it because we feel like
[1:52:12] we can handle it
[1:52:15] right god said i'm going to give them so
[1:52:17] much
[1:52:20] that they're going to be wanting to stop
[1:52:23] because they they they're going to
[1:52:25] realize you know what
[1:52:27] well we can't handle all of this
[1:52:29] come on y'all preach with me
[1:52:32] sometimes sometimes people around church
[1:52:35] we and one of the things i've learned
[1:52:38] over over the years is that we want we
[1:52:41] want these these so-called depths
[1:52:45] because they don't come down our street
[1:52:48] they stimulate us intellectually
[1:52:51] right
[1:52:52] but a lot of time because magog and god
[1:52:55] don't really necessarily deal with my
[1:52:58] life
[1:53:01] i'm mad with the world but i want
[1:53:04] everybody to amen preach magog and god
[1:53:10] right
[1:53:11] come on
[1:53:13] when you need to know how to control
[1:53:14] your temper
[1:53:16] you need to learn how to control your
[1:53:17] tongue
[1:53:19] right
[1:53:21] glory to god see i i've preached in
[1:53:24] meeting brother brooks and when you come
[1:53:26] out and you start preaching on certain
[1:53:28] things the whole place is shaking
[1:53:33] but then
[1:53:34] my wife say i do it all the time
[1:53:37] say then you start preaching on things
[1:53:39] and you start
[1:53:41] picking and meddling and after a while
[1:53:44] you can't hardly get a witness
[1:53:47] you'll be begging can i get a witness
[1:53:50] well you almost have to act like you're
[1:53:52] in the baptist church how many grew up
[1:53:53] baptists a little little baptist little
[1:53:55] pentecostal y'all know what i'm about
[1:53:59] [Music]
[1:54:01] folk perk up because you know
[1:54:05] i'm gonna close
[1:54:08] because when you when you when you're
[1:54:10] really dealing with with things that
[1:54:12] require
[1:54:14] change
[1:54:16] folk don't want that because folk good
[1:54:20] folk good with with being uh honorary
[1:54:23] and angry and and all of that but god
[1:54:26] ain't good with that
[1:54:28] god
[1:54:29] god is not good with it and so god
[1:54:33] shows you
[1:54:34] how to get from this place
[1:54:38] to where you need to be
[1:54:41] right
[1:54:43] because one thing i i learned about god
[1:54:45] i'm i'm i'm
[1:54:47] go to where i want to go and i'm gonna
[1:54:48] quit
[1:54:50] um one thing i've learned in studying
[1:54:53] the the reveal word is
[1:54:56] is that when a masterpiece is broken
[1:54:59] god quickly goes into action
[1:55:02] amen to fix the masterpiece
[1:55:05] why it's not god's desire for anything
[1:55:09] that's a man associated with him to be
[1:55:11] broken
[1:55:12] y'all ought to preach with me
[1:55:15] is that right come on
[1:55:17] to land ruin
[1:55:19] you just you just study the scripture
[1:55:22] with the tabernacle and all those
[1:55:24] different things they weren't ruined
[1:55:26] but amen god was identified in in that
[1:55:30] and so amen god's like listen man
[1:55:33] i'm i'm identified in this and so i'm
[1:55:36] not going to allow this to stay in that
[1:55:38] condition
[1:55:41] and and no matter how many devils
[1:55:44] or how long it takes
[1:55:46] amen i'm gonna work
[1:55:48] diligently
[1:55:49] to amen bring this thing back to full
[1:55:52] restoration
[1:55:55] come on
[1:55:56] that's scriptural
[1:55:58] man those things was torn down broken
[1:56:00] down
[1:56:02] right and and if anything is broken
[1:56:04] tonight
[1:56:06] god is
[1:56:08] because he will not allow it to stay in
[1:56:10] that condition see that's why brother
[1:56:12] brook that's why i don't even worry
[1:56:14] about my children and my family and
[1:56:16] things that's associated with me
[1:56:19] cause god will
[1:56:21] not allow it to stay in that position is
[1:56:24] that
[1:56:26] right god is strategic
[1:56:30] he he works
[1:56:32] i'm glad you know what brother brooks
[1:56:33] i'm glad this this scripture's in the
[1:56:35] bible his ways is not my ways
[1:56:38] see and because his ways in the way that
[1:56:41] he do does things is not the way that i
[1:56:44] would do things
[1:56:46] he can get the job done
[1:56:48] all he needs for me to do is get out of
[1:56:50] the way
[1:56:52] is that right
[1:56:53] man let me tell you something i've
[1:56:54] learned brother i don't fuss with nobody
[1:56:57] i don't argue with nobody i'm like hey
[1:57:02] this me right here
[1:57:04] hold my hands up
[1:57:07] i act ignorant
[1:57:09] you i fight with you for what
[1:57:13] why why how about what see one of the
[1:57:16] things that i've learned
[1:57:18] right one of the things that i've
[1:57:20] learned over the years
[1:57:21] gotta defend his own work
[1:57:27] god god is
[1:57:28] listen god can fight
[1:57:32] amen
[1:57:33] god can fight
[1:57:35] what
[1:57:49] he said boy stand still to see the
[1:57:51] salvation
[1:57:53] you and god told him he said you won't
[1:57:55] even have to fight in this battle
[1:58:00] you won't even have to sweat you won't
[1:58:01] have to work
[1:58:03] you just come in there and get the
[1:58:04] spoils
[1:58:06] huh
[1:58:08] won't he do it
[1:58:10] his his his god listen who would ever
[1:58:14] thought the way that god worked that
[1:58:15] thing out it would even work
[1:58:17] but
[1:58:18] god see
[1:58:21] we our problem is we try to interject
[1:58:24] self in our own human
[1:58:27] instrumentality and all that and we get
[1:58:29] it in a way and we make things worse
[1:58:32] i i learned amen you know just get out
[1:58:35] of the way even even with my youngsters

[2:00:09] don't heard enough word pieces though if
[2:00:11] they don't live a certain kind of life
[2:00:13] they know in the back of their minds
[2:00:15] somewhere if i don't get this thing
[2:00:17] together
[2:00:19] boy i ain't gonna make it i'm i ain't
[2:00:21] gonna kid myself on that
[2:00:23] that's right and and quietly they might
[2:00:26] be talking to god lord help me
[2:00:30] lord help me i'm in i'm in rough shape
[2:00:34] and
[2:00:34] i know it but
[2:00:36] see and that's how i talk to god i
[2:00:39] sometimes when brother brooks when i
[2:00:41] don't know what to say when i don't
[2:00:43] because i ain't no some people can get
[2:00:45] up here and really pray our father
[2:00:48] which out heaven
[2:00:50] they make that thing sound good
[2:00:53] huh
[2:00:55] i ain't never been that tight
[2:00:57] i sometimes sometimes all i can say is
[2:01:00] lord help
[2:01:04] you know
[2:01:05] i don't have a whole lot of words to say
[2:01:08] but god don't lord help me i'm i'm
[2:01:11] tangled up right now my emotions i'm
[2:01:15] lord you know i'm struggling right now
[2:01:17] just help me
[2:01:18] sometimes i i'll be walking and i'll be
[2:01:21] at work sometime
[2:01:22] and it's just a a
[2:01:25] a spontaneous response lord help me
[2:01:30] i'm struggling man i'm i'm going through
[2:01:34] i'm going through right now as a man
[2:01:37] see we can't we can't disconnect
[2:01:41] the man part from the god part in us
[2:01:45] right
[2:01:46] jesus didn't disconnect the man part
[2:01:49] from the god part because he went to his
[2:01:51] his
[2:01:52] his friend's uh uh
[2:01:55] uh
[2:01:56] weight or whatever and they said he
[2:01:58] cried
[2:02:00] that was the man part they cried the god
[2:02:03] pot said roll the stone away
[2:02:06] the man part cried
[2:02:09] the the man part grown with a headache
[2:02:14] the god part stood on the bow of a ship
[2:02:17] and said
[2:02:18] peace be still and and and everybody
[2:02:22] around the church folks say what man a
[2:02:24] man is this that even the winds and the
[2:02:27] waves obey him
[2:02:29] huh
[2:02:30] that's that's why that woman trying to
[2:02:32] argue with brother branham couldn't get
[2:02:34] it
[2:02:36] couldn't get it
[2:02:38] is that right because he cried
[2:02:41] then he spoke
[2:02:43] when you get tired of crying get up and
[2:02:47] speak to your situation
[2:02:52] is that right
[2:02:56] amen
[2:02:58] sometimes sometimes
[2:03:00] you know we crime makes us feel good
[2:03:05] it does
[2:03:06] it's an emotional response that's real
[2:03:09] that sometimes it's needed
[2:03:12] sometimes you just need to talk about it
[2:03:15] everybody wanna
[2:03:17] want you to hush it
[2:03:19] they be liking me to hush it
[2:03:22] you know don't talk about your family
[2:03:23] don't this just why not
[2:03:27] why not
[2:03:28] they ain't no different than anybody
[2:03:30] else family that
[2:03:31] they don't win away from the word of god
[2:03:33] come on
[2:03:35] they ain't angels
[2:03:37] i often told the church when when they
[2:03:39] was coming up i said i don't know what
[2:03:40] they're going to do when they get older
[2:03:42] and able to make their own decisions
[2:03:45] i see now
[2:03:47] i didn't know then
[2:03:50] i fell in the word but i always knew
[2:03:53] uh um you cause you can't take choice
[2:03:57] you can't take choice away from them and
[2:04:00] here here's something i'm gonna say this
[2:04:02] because i think we got young men here
[2:04:04] you know and young sisters listen when
[2:04:07] when you make the choices that you make
[2:04:09] about your life
[2:04:12] right don't get 20 years down the road
[2:04:14] and start looking back saying you know
[2:04:16] this and no you made that choice
[2:04:21] you made that choice
[2:04:23] just just
[2:04:24] move learn to move past it
[2:04:29] is that right you know hey
[2:04:31] well
[2:04:32] if my daddy wouldn't did this
[2:04:35] like really come on

[2:04:58] could get to get me here on time
[2:05:00] but but but i you know
[2:05:05] you got to be able to be responsible
[2:05:08] grow
[2:05:09] mature i'm you you because you you
[2:05:12] watching young people
[2:05:14] you you're watching young men make
[2:05:17] decisions
[2:05:19] and this is something i've i've said uh
[2:05:21] from the beginning of the year god
[2:05:23] dropped some things down in my spirit
[2:05:26] and and i had to take a a deep dive into
[2:05:29] my own life
[2:05:30] and and i realized
[2:05:32] now i did get married i have been
[2:05:34] married
[2:05:36] um for
[2:05:37] next week or be 29 years
[2:05:41] and and
[2:05:43] and i man i tell you what
[2:05:46] i wish i was a little bit more mature
[2:05:50] when i got married because
[2:05:52] you said well why you say that brother
[2:05:53] smiling because i went from
[2:05:55] i went from
[2:05:57] um
[2:05:57] living in a home
[2:05:59] when with no
[2:06:02] father figures
[2:06:05] i had i had my mother
[2:06:07] and she was operating
[2:06:09] out of position but doing the best that
[2:06:12] she could
[2:06:14] but
[2:06:15] as a woman she couldn't be
[2:06:18] male and female
[2:06:21] right
[2:06:22] amen
[2:06:23] but but by being a single mom even in
[2:06:26] bringing in a stepdad who didn't really
[2:06:29] fully understand
[2:06:32] his position
[2:06:37] it it
[2:06:38] really caused me to learn a lot of
[2:06:40] things that that weren't
[2:06:43] uh edified
[2:06:45] right because
[2:06:47] there's things that she didn't know and
[2:06:49] i'm not
[2:06:51] holding anybody responsible
[2:06:53] um i i just
[2:06:55] i made this statement and i don't say
[2:06:57] this to be smart enough it's just
[2:07:00] things that i look at now differently
[2:07:02] than maybe i looked at years ago
[2:07:06] uh
[2:07:08] you want young men to be responsible
[2:07:12] and most young men and i'm gonna say
[2:07:14] this because i'm 60 and i think i can
[2:07:17] say this
[2:07:19] and and i got children
[2:07:21] y'all age that i see here
[2:07:24] uh and i went through a lot i i sold
[2:07:28] drugs i was in gangs i fought i
[2:07:31] you know i did a lot of bad things
[2:07:33] before
[2:07:34] before my conversion
[2:07:38] but the problem of it was when i got
[2:07:40] converted
[2:07:42] there was no ministry there
[2:07:44] to to really shine the light on the word
[2:07:48] to anchor me
[2:07:50] as a young man
[2:07:53] before i took a wife
[2:07:55] because you know when we we were coming
[2:07:56] up everybody was fussing and arguing
[2:07:58] about their favorite doctrines
[2:08:01] that's right and and and we were we we
[2:08:04] as a generation were undernourished
[2:08:08] in the in the manhood category
[2:08:12] and see manhood is not just
[2:08:15] you know your masculinity
[2:08:19] right
[2:08:20] see uh
[2:08:23] real real
[2:08:25] maturity
[2:08:26] as a man is
[2:08:28] knowing who you are
[2:08:30] and being good with who you are
[2:08:34] right and and
[2:08:35] understanding
[2:08:37] on every level
[2:08:39] every stage of your life that you enter
[2:08:41] into
[2:08:43] what you're about to face
[2:08:45] because if you don't you're gonna make
[2:08:47] somebody's life miserable
[2:08:50] it's the truth anyhow
[2:08:51] come on i'm
[2:08:53] right
[2:08:54] it's
[2:08:56] this something you know i use myself as
[2:08:58] an as an example
[2:09:00] i made a statement and
[2:09:02] i thank god that i got married when i
[2:09:05] did
[2:09:06] right and i loved my wife and i got a
[2:09:09] beautiful family
[2:09:11] but
[2:09:12] i looking back i realized i was not
[2:09:15] ready for marriage
[2:09:18] right i wasn't
[2:09:20] my hormones were
[2:09:24] my hormones were
[2:09:26] and maybe even my bank account was okay
[2:09:33] but but mentally
[2:09:35] i wasn't stable mentally
[2:09:39] see
[2:09:40] and see we we got to we got to put
[2:09:42] things in order
[2:09:44] put things in perspective
[2:09:47] before we approach these things
[2:09:50] you got
[2:09:51] listen
[2:09:54] i had to ask myself a question the early
[2:09:56] part of the year
[2:09:58] who are you
[2:10:00] apart from
[2:10:01] just well i'm a pastor this
[2:10:05] back back back back let's let's let's
[2:10:06] take it back to the foundation
[2:10:09] right who are you apart from your name
[2:10:14] see in in these areas you got to be
[2:10:17] solid
[2:10:20] you you you see here's what makes the
[2:10:22] difference i i like the story that
[2:10:24] brother branham tells about the uh
[2:10:27] the
[2:10:28] the slave
[2:10:30] that fellow was solid
[2:10:34] he was he was so solid you couldn't move
[2:10:36] him you didn't have to beat him you
[2:10:38] didn't right the rest of the people you
[2:10:41] almost had to kill them to get something
[2:10:43] out of what they weren't solid
[2:10:46] they didn't have the kind of knowledge
[2:10:49] that was necessary
[2:10:51] so that they could function
[2:10:53] in surroundings that were different
[2:10:57] right
[2:10:58] but but
[2:11:00] whatever whatever this young man got
[2:11:03] a man uh it was his anchor
[2:11:07] and and the guy found out he was a king
[2:11:11] see and so if if if we're if we're kings
[2:11:16] and priests we gotta we gotta understand
[2:11:18] what that actually means
[2:11:21] the real true principles what does that
[2:11:24] really mean
[2:11:26] for me as a young man to
[2:11:29] that that office
[2:11:31] of king and priesthood
[2:11:33] right what does that really mean
[2:11:43] reception and we we dancing and we doing
[2:11:46] all of that and then
[2:11:48] five years down the line
[2:11:51] we are
[2:11:52] in an entanglement
[2:11:55] right come on
[2:11:57] cause she's not solid and this this goal
[2:12:02] when you educate it what does that mean
[2:12:05] you could you could you could be
[2:12:07] educated and not know yourself
[2:12:11] it's it's
[2:12:12] you know because we got a generation of
[2:12:14] of
[2:12:15] uh uh women that i'm a strong
[2:12:20] can i say it just the way they say it
[2:12:22] i'm a strong black woman
[2:12:26] you know you're strong white whatever
[2:12:29] you might be
[2:12:31] spanish or whatever i'm gonna put
[2:12:33] everybody in this here
[2:12:36] yeah
[2:12:36] but but really what what what does that
[2:12:39] really mean
[2:12:41] at the end of the day what what are you
[2:12:43] saying
[2:12:44] see we we so easy to gravitate towards
[2:12:49] uh terminology that don't line up with
[2:12:53] the bible
[2:12:56] see that's why we needed a ministry to
[2:12:58] take us back to the bible
[2:13:03] right we we needed malachi 4
[2:13:06] to take us back to the bible that's why
[2:13:10] we so messed up
[2:13:13] right because we we we gravitate towards
[2:13:17] uh
[2:13:18] terminologies
[2:13:20] that that's being influenced from the
[2:13:22] pits of hell
[2:13:24] baby mama drama
[2:13:26] that stuff didn't come along in our day
[2:13:30] baby daddy that's my baby daddy
[2:13:33] but we never said that
[2:13:36] we never said that kind of stuff
[2:13:38] see and now these things watch this
[2:13:42] these things become a culture
[2:13:45] all on their own
[2:13:47] y'all didn't come to preach with me but
[2:13:49] i come to preach
[2:13:51] i come to preach
[2:13:53] right
[2:13:54] we we don't realize how things become
[2:13:59] a culture
[2:14:00] and get a cult following yes sir
[2:14:10] i will give it to you based upon the
[2:14:11] word
[2:14:12] god god started from genesis perfect
[2:14:16] word perfect interpretation of the word
[2:14:19] then the serpent comes in you won't
[2:14:21] surely die right
[2:14:23] god starts at the day of pentecost he
[2:14:25] started the church he gave them the
[2:14:27] perfect interpretation of the word they
[2:14:30] preached christ set everything in order
[2:14:32] sent paul on the scene set everything in
[2:14:35] order they went along fine did not see a
[2:14:38] cup
[2:14:40] right
[2:14:41] and died and diluted the word
[2:14:44] what they started out with just a little
[2:14:46] sand
[2:14:48] right
[2:14:49] amen they went up to niacia with a
[2:14:52] little saying
[2:14:53] something that seemed you know
[2:14:56] it's a little inoffensive it won't
[2:14:58] really hurt much
[2:15:00] go back and study it this is what
[2:15:01] brother brethren taught
[2:15:04] but but it starts from a
[2:15:06] from a deed
[2:15:08] to a doctrine started from a white horse
[2:15:11] rider
[2:15:12] then to a red
[2:15:15] black pair
[2:15:16] right
[2:15:17] but watch how it starts
[2:15:20] right and then it gains momentum
[2:15:25] right
[2:15:26] it becomes a cult
[2:15:30] because
[2:15:31] and then watch what watch watch how
[2:15:35] broad the cult is now baby mama drama
[2:15:39] and watch how many followers are in it
[2:15:44] and and it's a thing
[2:15:46] it's a thing it's where you know
[2:15:49] nowadays
[2:15:51] they don't want marriage
[2:15:54] right everybody want to live and it used
[2:15:57] to be a shame
[2:16:00] to be caught sleeping around
[2:16:04] and if you got pregnant they sent you
[2:16:06] down south to the woods somewhere
[2:16:10] you went pridefully parading yourself
[2:16:13] all around town
[2:16:15] amen with a big belly no
[2:16:20] where's sally sue
[2:16:21] oh she went on a little vacation
[2:16:25] to anime house down down south somewhere
[2:16:30] wasn't no pride to that
[2:16:32] that was shame
[2:16:36] now you you walk in walmart anywhere you
[2:16:39] look
[2:16:40] everybody pregnant
[2:16:44] ain't nothing
[2:16:46] huh
[2:16:47] and then and then
[2:16:50] then we're wondering
[2:16:52] what we're raising up
[2:16:54] look at the generation that we're
[2:16:56] raising up and then every generation has
[2:16:59] gotten so far away from the word
[2:17:02] right because see when we were coming up
[2:17:04] brother brooks
[2:17:05] uh
[2:17:07] if if our parents didn't take cause our
[2:17:09] grandparents took us to church
[2:17:13] but we had some church somewhere now
[2:17:16] these kids ain't even getting no church
[2:17:20] huh
[2:17:21] they ain't getting no church you know
[2:17:23] what they getting they getting they
[2:17:25] getting the rappers ideologies and
[2:17:28] and you know all of these all of these
[2:17:31] different things and we look look what
[2:17:33] we a bunch of mass murderers
[2:17:37] on all sides black white you name them
[2:17:42] that they don't fear
[2:17:45] that's right right they don't have no no
[2:17:48] reverence no fear no nothing
[2:17:52] when we were coming up man you know we
[2:17:55] had a respect for our elders
[2:17:58] it wasn't in no grown folk conversation
[2:18:00] you got your lips slapped off
[2:18:04] and then we we talked to our kids about
[2:18:07] grown folk stuff where they're not
[2:18:10] capable of processing
[2:18:14] i wish i had time to preach
[2:18:17] huh
[2:18:18] they can't process these things
[2:18:22] right
[2:18:23] and and look at what state that throws
[2:18:25] them all let me tell you something
[2:18:27] man we need to come back to a lot of
[2:18:29] basics in a whole lot of areas
[2:18:32] right because if because if we don't
[2:18:35] if we don't i ain't talking about the
[2:18:37] world i'm talking about around the
[2:18:38] message
[2:18:40] because i ain't in the world i ain't in
[2:18:42] denomination i don't i don't really
[2:18:44] preach
[2:18:45] all that about denominations because i
[2:18:48] understand what brother brown did amen
[2:18:51] as it relates to denominations showing a
[2:18:53] position in place so i i don't
[2:18:56] necessarily i don't glorify
[2:18:58] you know calling them dead birds and
[2:19:01] this that don't do nothing for me
[2:19:03] what what what what
[2:19:06] what i try to do
[2:19:07] is amongst the people that god has
[2:19:11] raised me up to preach to bring them the
[2:19:14] unsearchable riches of jesus christ
[2:19:19] not not getting them worked up talking
[2:19:21] about a denomination
[2:19:24] right because if we teach them right
[2:19:26] they understand the positions
[2:19:29] of those denominations and how they came
[2:19:32] into being how god used them in their
[2:19:34] day
[2:19:37] they they yeah they living in a day gone
[2:19:40] by i already know all of them people
[2:19:42] ain't gonna be lost
[2:19:43] it's gonna be some loss
[2:19:45] just like it's gonna be some people lost
[2:19:47] it right around and revealed word
[2:19:49] that's true
[2:19:52] because you hold a book
[2:19:53] man please cause you was in brother
[2:19:55] brown and me don't that stuff don't
[2:19:57] impress me
[2:19:58] cause most of the people that that were
[2:20:00] in brother brown's meetings didn't even
[2:20:02] understand his ministry
[2:20:05] most of the preachers they didn't even
[2:20:07] understand his ministry he knew that
[2:20:12] he loved him anyway
[2:20:15] at the end of his ministry brother
[2:20:17] branham didn't even really have a poor
[2:20:19] pit to preach in they thought he was a
[2:20:23] lunatic
[2:20:26] right
[2:20:28] it wasn't for them it was for us
[2:20:37] but but i you know what i said a lot
[2:20:40] tonight
[2:20:41] and uh
[2:20:43] i'll say this
[2:20:46] uh
[2:20:47] in riding
[2:20:48] realizing
[2:20:50] you know
[2:20:51] i was just preaching my personal
[2:20:53] experience to a certain degree
[2:20:57] and being a man down and realizing that
[2:21:00] you know god's got me
[2:21:02] i was listening to a tape
[2:21:05] 1965 does god change his mind about his
[2:21:08] word
[2:21:09] and brother branham just
[2:21:12] you know for me and sometimes things
[2:21:16] don't don't mean to you
[2:21:18] the same way
[2:21:20] that it means to me
[2:21:22] and a word quicker to me might you might
[2:21:25] look at it like really
[2:21:27] that motivated you
[2:21:29] that caused the response in you
[2:21:31] that
[2:21:33] well let me tell you something when you
[2:21:35] down
[2:21:37] and you need
[2:21:38] something it don't take a whole lot of
[2:21:41] sentences
[2:21:43] sometimes it'll take two words
[2:21:46] to quicken
[2:21:48] something to elevate you and as i was
[2:21:50] going along brother branham he makes
[2:21:52] this statement because he had he had
[2:21:55] preached
[2:21:56] uh it's the rising of the sun that
[2:21:58] morning right and
[2:22:00] that night he was preaching
[2:22:02] uh
[2:22:03] does god ever change his mind about his
[2:22:06] word and and i like because brother
[2:22:08] branham was bringing a word in season
[2:22:10] it's deriving us a really powerful
[2:22:12] powerful message
[2:22:14] right i've read it several times and
[2:22:16] every time i read it i get more and more
[2:22:17] inspired
[2:22:19] uh
[2:22:20] and
[2:22:21] being inspired realizing you know what
[2:22:23] there's something that i got to get to
[2:22:25] the people that's needed
[2:22:27] right he said now i can't i can't say
[2:22:31] that i'll apologize for that
[2:22:33] long long message this morning but but
[2:22:36] it was i i didn't want to wear out your
[2:22:39] patience then come at it again tonight
[2:22:41] but i wanted to get that message to you
[2:22:44] and and sometimes as a minister you know
[2:22:47] you you want to quit because you don't
[2:22:49] want to wet people i don't i don't like
[2:22:50] to try to wet people out but sometimes
[2:22:53] you get so inspired and you realize so
[2:22:56] listen church let me tell you something
[2:22:58] there's a lot that really needs to be
[2:23:00] seen
[2:23:01] in the season that we're in because
[2:23:04] we're losing people this building should
[2:23:07] be full
[2:23:09] come on church
[2:23:11] this place should be
[2:23:13] should be full
[2:23:15] and and you see it all over the world td
[2:23:18] jakes everybody
[2:23:21] with with before covert them people was
[2:23:24] packing into places now
[2:23:27] emphasis everywhere
[2:23:30] you can hear echo in the balcony now
[2:23:33] right
[2:23:36] just just look at just look at where our
[2:23:39] young people are at
[2:23:40] i thank god for
[2:23:42] uh
[2:23:43] young men being inspired to stay with
[2:23:45] the things of god
[2:23:47] but there's so many
[2:23:49] more
[2:23:50] that don't have the same feeling
[2:23:53] right
[2:23:54] and it's definitely late
[2:23:58] huh
[2:23:59] but he says
[2:24:00] um but i want to give this message to
[2:24:03] you
[2:24:04] that you are part of this resurrection
[2:24:07] and let me tell you something church
[2:24:09] that statement don't mean nothing to you
[2:24:11] but when you down
[2:24:14] when you hungry for something
[2:24:17] and you get
[2:24:18] uh just a taste of something
[2:24:22] man
[2:24:24] it was like that statement
[2:24:27] it kicked open the door
[2:24:30] of the thing that was trying to cage me
[2:24:33] up
[2:24:34] right not a literal door
[2:24:37] a spiritual emotional door
[2:24:40] that was trying to uh keep me captive
[2:24:45] to my past
[2:24:49] right to hold me to hold me in my past
[2:24:53] to just bring me down and wail me and
[2:24:56] wail me and wail me and wear me and you
[2:24:58] ain't nothing and man yeah them people
[2:25:00] left you and man the doors closed and
[2:25:03] this and that
[2:25:05] and then he says but you know what
[2:25:07] you're part of something that's big
[2:25:10] wait a minute wait a minute wait a
[2:25:12] minute wait a minute wait a minute i had
[2:25:14] to stop
[2:25:18] because i'm driving
[2:25:20] and if you're a preacher you know what
[2:25:21] i'm talking about you get inspired
[2:25:24] amen
[2:25:25] you know see come different i'm built a
[2:25:27] little bit different i i i can i do i
[2:25:30] can do things different ways because
[2:25:32] this i've been doing this a little bit i
[2:25:34] can preach y'all for three hours
[2:25:36] and never really read y'all a quote i
[2:25:38] hope y'all don't get offended by that
[2:25:41] you know cause some people say you gotta
[2:25:42] quote them quotes
[2:25:44] well what you think i've been doing for
[2:25:45] the last two hours
[2:25:47] see the message is just not a quote
[2:25:52] right it's it's
[2:25:54] it's a combination
[2:25:56] of things brought together to present
[2:25:59] christ
[2:26:01] right
[2:26:02] and see i could do it how he leads me to
[2:26:05] do it
[2:26:06] because that's just how i'm built i
[2:26:08] don't just have to come up
[2:26:10] and just re re read
[2:26:13] i can be inspired because i know what's
[2:26:15] on these pages already
[2:26:18] and just let him use me
[2:26:20] and and
[2:26:21] let him speak to the heart because like
[2:26:24] i said it's so much that
[2:26:27] really needs to be preached
[2:26:32] to undo a lot of damages
[2:26:36] right to put salves on a lot of hurt
[2:26:39] because there's a lot of hurting people
[2:26:41] around the message
[2:26:43] right
[2:26:44] but but when i heard that you're a part
[2:26:47] because you know we want to be a part of
[2:26:49] we want to be a part of the end crew i'm
[2:26:52] quite sure you know i was i was young
[2:26:55] you know i wanted to be a part of the
[2:26:57] end crew
[2:26:58] you know coming up back in the day
[2:27:01] in one of those different inspirations
[2:27:03] and you you know you want to be
[2:27:05] you know you want to
[2:27:07] feel like you're important because
[2:27:10] these guys say that these guys are the
[2:27:12] important guys in this movie you want to
[2:27:15] be a part of all that i was in school
[2:27:17] high school and and
[2:27:19] you know you will you want to be down
[2:27:21] and you want you don't want to be called
[2:27:22] a square they probably don't even use
[2:27:24] that they write on you that's y'all
[2:27:26] telling my age or that with brother
[2:27:29] right
[2:27:31] but
[2:27:32] to know that i'm part of something
[2:27:34] that's eternal
[2:27:36] that means
[2:27:38] that that's like wake up wake up wake up
[2:27:40] wake up wake up wake up
[2:27:42] because it's it this is an individual
[2:27:45] thing if nobody going i'm going
[2:27:48] right
[2:27:51] when when he says when god says you're
[2:27:54] part of something you're a part of
[2:27:55] something
[2:27:57] right
[2:27:58] see it's not the voice i heard a brother
[2:28:00] say this today it's not the voice of a
[2:28:03] man it's a voice and a voice
[2:28:06] god used the voice
[2:28:08] see we we've made brother branham uh uh
[2:28:13] the everything but it's never brother
[2:28:15] branham never did this we done this
[2:28:18] brother brennan was always trying to
[2:28:21] point the people to the real man
[2:28:25] the mess the mess that we got going on
[2:28:27] around this message we did this
[2:28:31] men did this i'm i got to say we cause
[2:28:35] i'm identified
[2:28:37] you got to be identified in the glory
[2:28:39] and the shame
[2:28:41] but we've done this
[2:28:43] right that that's why when i listen to
[2:28:45] things i mean brother branham never
[2:28:47] that's that's why i got to be an
[2:28:49] individual thing
[2:28:51] right amen i realized wait a minute when
[2:28:54] i when i hit the tapes and read
[2:28:57] he's pointing me to christ
[2:28:59] but men is trying to point me to him
[2:29:03] i think it's important for us to see him
[2:29:06] initially
[2:29:08] in order to understand his ministry
[2:29:12] he came according to these scriptures
[2:29:15] here
[2:29:16] but
[2:29:18] what was his purpose all
[2:29:20] about amen
[2:29:22] come on
[2:29:23] where he came for what
[2:29:28] he's the voice what did he say
[2:29:31] what was it all about
[2:29:33] right
[2:29:35] y'all musicians y'all better come on
[2:29:36] over here cause uh i'll have to pump
[2:29:39] oxygen cause i feel good like paul
[2:29:41] preached all night i feel an all-nighter
[2:29:46] huh
[2:29:47] but but
[2:29:48] but i feel good i don't need a lot of
[2:29:51] people i just need i just need an
[2:29:53] audience
[2:29:55] i remember i remember a sister at my
[2:29:57] church she don't went on to be with the
[2:29:58] lord now
[2:30:01] and and we had had a real bad split
[2:30:04] and we didn't have that many folk and
[2:30:07] one sunday after surgery say brother
[2:30:09] smiley she said i noticed
[2:30:12] you preach
[2:30:13] you preach hard like
[2:30:17] the building full i i was like should i
[2:30:20] preach any other way
[2:30:22] should i shortchange
[2:30:25] the few
[2:30:26] because the many
[2:30:28] have walked away
[2:30:31] huh it ain't it ain't a church full of
[2:30:33] night
[2:30:34] should i give y'all any less
[2:30:37] tonight
[2:30:38] because the church ain't full
[2:30:43] no
[2:30:44] i will be robbing y'all
[2:30:46] if i did something like that
[2:30:49] is that right but
[2:30:51] he says and i'm i'm winding down he says
[2:30:54] and don't worry about it no more
[2:30:57] just rejoice over it there is nothing
[2:30:59] nowhere can separate you from it
[2:31:03] right nothing he says
[2:31:05] and i like this next statement he says
[2:31:07] uh you're eternally secured that's a
[2:31:10] powerful statement
[2:31:12] see the
[2:31:13] things that that
[2:31:16] when when we come down from shouting
[2:31:19] that we got to have in our spirit
[2:31:23] that'll carry us
[2:31:25] when we can't carry ourself
[2:31:28] right
[2:31:30] see i like what brother brandon talked
[2:31:31] about the two daughters i got all the
[2:31:33] daddy here but you can let daddy go but
[2:31:34] his daddy got all of me
[2:31:37] see i don't i don't let god daddy plenty
[2:31:39] time but he still had he said he still
[2:31:43] had me
[2:31:44] i got you now
[2:31:46] i i got you your feet might be dangling
[2:31:49] and everything but i got you
[2:31:51] see she didn't let go and fell on the
[2:31:53] floor cause i didn't have her hey y'all
[2:31:56] let her preach with me
[2:31:58] huh
[2:31:59] cause she thought cause she thought
[2:32:01] because she was bigger than you
[2:32:03] you know but she on the floor but i got
[2:32:06] you
[2:32:10] eternally secured in the kingdom
[2:32:13] of god when god has stamped his seal
[2:32:16] upon you
[2:32:17] you're to the end of your destination
[2:32:19] brother brother branham take takes and
[2:32:22] preaches this this seal and the breach
[2:32:24] message and different messages
[2:32:27] and and and trying to show that listen
[2:32:30] here's the important thing and you could
[2:32:33] never get away from you must be born
[2:32:36] again
[2:32:38] trying to get people
[2:32:41] i'm gonna make a real
[2:32:43] statement that might rub y'all the wrong
[2:32:45] way brother don't bother me i ain't
[2:32:47] scared of y'all
[2:32:50] because sometimes people say i'm in the
[2:32:52] message
[2:32:54] but they ain't in christ
[2:32:57] but then you could be in the message
[2:33:01] and be in the message
[2:33:04] i hope that didn't ruin go wrong now it
[2:33:06] depends on where you at
[2:33:08] in your understanding
[2:33:10] cause people think well look i don't
[2:33:12] know the name of this church
[2:33:14] and brother brook's my pastor and i'm in
[2:33:16] the message
[2:33:18] no you're not no you're not you're not
[2:33:21] no no you just
[2:33:23] you just associate it because you can be
[2:33:25] a part of a church by just paying your
[2:33:27] tithes and offering in your presence and
[2:33:30] not be in christ
[2:33:35] see
[2:33:36] and and because
[2:33:38] once you get in christ
[2:33:40] and the inspector
[2:33:42] shuts the door
[2:33:45] it i like brother brother branham says
[2:33:47] he says not from revival to revival
[2:33:51] he said the inspector shut the door
[2:33:53] you're in
[2:33:55] amen it's it's it's to your eternal
[2:33:59] destination
[2:34:01] i got you
[2:34:03] because once the inspector put his seal
[2:34:06] upon it
[2:34:07] he is responsible
[2:34:10] if
[2:34:11] if anything go wrong
[2:34:14] it it
[2:34:15] who
[2:34:16] who signed that
[2:34:18] go get him
[2:34:20] go get him we need to talk to him
[2:34:23] something so
[2:34:24] something didn't make it to his
[2:34:25] destination
[2:34:27] so
[2:34:27] someone packed right something was
[2:34:32] but he said the inspector i think a lot
[2:34:34] of times the problem is because we we
[2:34:37] like we get the devil a lot of credit
[2:34:40] right here good adversary the devil made
[2:34:42] me do it i like brother said no he did
[2:34:45] he did he did he did he said you just
[2:34:48] came out
[2:34:50] lusting for the things of the world
[2:34:53] that's all that was
[2:34:56] but you know what church tonight
[2:34:59] one thing i i'm certain of
[2:35:02] is is that god never save a man
[2:35:05] to lose the man god god is god is
[2:35:08] sovereign
[2:35:10] god is sovereign so this is why i don't
[2:35:12] i don't i don't worry about folk
[2:35:15] because if if if your name was written
[2:35:17] in the land book of life before the
[2:35:19] foundation of the world
[2:35:22] amen somewhere at some point
[2:35:25] and folk don't like for you to use these
[2:35:28] quotes no more
[2:35:29] if he got to lay you down
[2:35:31] in a hospital or something of that
[2:35:34] nature he gonna get you
[2:35:37] he gonna get you he can't lose you
[2:35:40] all that the father has given me they
[2:35:43] will come i never lost one
[2:35:47] i don't know that song
[2:35:48] right
[2:35:49] not one
[2:35:51] i like that i don't know who wrote that
[2:35:53] sister lewis or my mother-in-law but
[2:35:55] they never lost one
[2:35:57] just the song said just keep your faith
[2:36:00] believing
[2:36:01] because we something like we all know as
[2:36:03] one man
[2:36:04] my sister-in-law used to sing
[2:36:06] right but all that the father has given
[2:36:09] me
[2:36:10] they will come is that right let's get a
[2:36:12] little hand to praise let's stand to our
[2:36:13] feet tonight
[2:36:16] amen this is my head's for a word of
[2:36:18] prayer we'll turn it over to
[2:36:20] uh brother brooks today
[2:36:22] gracious father we just thank you
[2:36:24] we we praise you lord jesus
[2:36:27] um
[2:36:29] we we appreciate you
[2:36:31] i i know that this is an eternal word we
[2:36:35] can't tell it all
[2:36:37] and
[2:36:38] you know i
[2:36:39] i'm just wanting this hour i like to
[2:36:42] sometimes just get up and
[2:36:44] preach to my heart from my heart i know
[2:36:46] we got
[2:36:47] great teachers around the message of the
[2:36:50] hour men that can
[2:36:51] take the word and do a much better
[2:36:54] job than i possibly can
[2:36:57] but i just like sometimes to tell
[2:37:00] what i know about things in my own way
[2:37:05] um
[2:37:06] share things in a way that it will touch
[2:37:09] the hearts of the people
[2:37:12] we we could leave out of here
[2:37:14] lord realize you know what a lot's been
[2:37:17] said
[2:37:18] and uh my heart's been touched
[2:37:22] and it's things that
[2:37:24] i can go back and really look at
[2:37:28] it's it's so so much and i know
[2:37:30] sometimes we don't have enough time but
[2:37:34] it's things that
[2:37:36] we we
[2:37:37] need to work on with with
[2:37:40] these generations coming up they
[2:37:43] you know the bible even lets us know
[2:37:44] that there'll be a little bit wiser
[2:37:46] intellectually but a little bit weaker
[2:37:49] but
[2:37:50] we
[2:37:52] we've been given uh just perfect word
[2:37:55] and perfect interpretations and
[2:37:58] we want to be able to pass these things
[2:38:00] on
[2:38:02] so that
[2:38:03] every generation
[2:38:05] could look back to an original thought
[2:38:07] of god and don't do what what
[2:38:10] the
[2:38:11] other generations did
[2:38:14] uh
[2:38:15] we thank you oh god tonight we
[2:38:17] appreciate your father we pray that you
[2:38:19] just continue to have your way
[2:38:21] bless your people that have come out and
[2:38:23] pressing their weight gap strength in
[2:38:24] the body
[2:38:25] we just thank you and praise you for all
[2:38:27] things tonight in jesus name amen
[2:38:30] [Music]
[2:38:49] the only thing i'm sad about is that
[2:38:53] many people should have been
[2:38:54] here and i want to say to the brother
[2:38:57] you did just what god wanted you to do
[2:38:59] i mean even some of the ministers here
[2:39:02] the ones who were with me today know
[2:39:04] this you touched on things that we
[2:39:06] talked about
[2:39:07] even when it comes down to the
[2:39:09] fundamentals the
[2:39:11] church needing the holy ghost
[2:39:13] they need the holy ghost
[2:39:15] and it's a shame that we
[2:39:17] we
[2:39:18] we
[2:39:19] we we think we've got it
[2:39:21] and and that's the that's the deception
[2:39:24] on a lot of people's lives
[2:39:26] because they really think they have a
[2:39:28] arrived
[2:39:29] and you can't even pay them to come to
[2:39:31] church but
[2:39:32] but it's amazing what the enemy can do
[2:39:35] he can give you some overtime and
[2:39:37] everything else and
[2:39:38] you you cherish that more than you would
[2:39:41] being in the house of the lord that that
[2:39:43] in itself shows that something's really
[2:39:45] wrong
[2:39:46] but i'm not going to preach the man is
[2:39:48] really i don't think god could have said
[2:39:51] in anything i mean it was the lord from
[2:39:53] you know i don't know about but your
[2:39:55] experience helped me a great deal i mean
[2:39:57] it was god
[2:39:59] that's all i saw i i didn't i didn't see
[2:40:01] brother willie i saw god
[2:40:03] speaking to my heart
[2:40:05] and showing me and i mean just open up
[2:40:07] windows and open up doors and open up i
[2:40:10] can't tell you you know i can truly say
[2:40:12] that the person i came in as
[2:40:15] is not the same person that will leave
[2:40:17] out
[2:40:18] so there's been a change in me even if
[2:40:20] it's just by way of revelation but i
[2:40:22] know that revelation will bring forth a
[2:40:24] greater manifestation of christ in my
[2:40:27] life and i just want to thank you for
[2:40:29] letting god
[2:40:31] use you what you did tonight is not easy
[2:40:33] for preachers to do
[2:40:36] you know
[2:40:37] it's not easy for preachers to do and i
[2:40:40] want to say this that we're on the same
[2:40:42] page
[2:40:43] we're on the same page it's about jesus
[2:40:45] christ thank god for william branham and
[2:40:47] all that he's done we're not trying to
[2:40:50] take anything from him
[2:40:52] because if he wasn't for him we wouldn't
[2:40:54] be here right where we are now he had to
[2:40:56] do what he had to do
[2:40:58] now it's on us
[2:41:00] to understand what he was doing
[2:41:03] to understand his position as the
[2:41:05] brother said i'm going to say one more
[2:41:07] thing we were talking about sunday
[2:41:09] school and trying to get the young
[2:41:10] people
[2:41:11] when the squeeze or the pressure we know
[2:41:13] we are in squeeze it's gonna as he said
[2:41:15] intensify
[2:41:16] people don't even have no idea
[2:41:19] what we in for
[2:41:21] and our young children they have no idea
[2:41:25] ask them who is william branham
[2:41:27] ask him what his ministry was ask him
[2:41:30] the things these simple things that they
[2:41:32] should know
[2:41:33] have no idea
[2:41:35] ask them why our women wear long dresses
[2:41:38] ask them simple things they don't know
[2:41:43] and and that's the sad part you can't
[2:41:45] get these parents
[2:41:47] [Music]
[2:41:49] to even desire to do it
[2:41:52] but they'll give them
[2:41:55] a phone
[2:41:57] a ipad
[2:41:58] they give them all of that
[2:42:01] but they're not bringing them to christ
[2:42:03] that's what hurts me
[2:42:05] that's my heart desire
[2:42:07] to see people feel with the holy ghost
[2:42:09] and like our brother said it's so true
[2:42:12] so true so truth thank god for this
[2:42:14] message
[2:42:15] we all went through that emotional realm
[2:42:17] we all went through that
[2:42:19] but at the end of the day we know we
[2:42:21] needed more
[2:42:22] that's when christ could help
[2:42:24] when you know you need more but when you
[2:42:26] think you got it all i'm i have need of
[2:42:29] nothing god can't do a thing with you
[2:42:32] i love the lord brother i'm not going to
[2:42:34] go on i'm stirred i'm a preacher
[2:42:40] my god but i have been fed tonight and i
[2:42:42] trust you have been too
[2:42:44] it's been wonderful and we'll have our
[2:42:46] song leader come

[2:42:50] anything you you're welcome we we pray
[2:42:52] for you however
