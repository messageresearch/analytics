grace as we stand go right into the word of God we like to welcome all our visitors we thank God for all of you let us turn to St John the 15th chapter from St John 15 we'll go to St John 16 we know this is time where the world is celebrating [Music] Christmas we as Christians we take advantage of this time as we as we do Thanksgiving and time to really focus on your family thanks for all that God has done only the true bride of Christ knows the understanding revelation of the birth of Christ but we know without a birth There Is No Death and when there is no death there is no Resurrection so let's go to St John 15 26-27 but when the comforter is come whom I will send unto you from the father even the spirit of Truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me amen and ye also shall bear witness because ye have been with me from the beginning Hallelujah St John 167 nevertheless I'll tell you the truth it is expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if I depart I will send himto you amen let's just pray our Heavenly Father God we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for all that you do you have been better to us than we've been to ourselves father we pray Lord God that you bless the assembling today we're not here for form of fashion but we we come to collectively Worship You Hallelujah thank you Jesus Christ for being alive and well for you are the only true and living God thank you for that Revelation to know that you're no longer in the grave you're no in the M A Manger but you're now dwelling in the hearts of men we thank you for that this morning bless every heart in your name Jesus Christ we amen amen you may be seated I I believe this is the first time that that I can remember ever having to preach on what we call Christmas Eve yes that's what it is amen I get mixed up sometime but I trust by the grace of God that the message this morning will be a blessing to you I'm not here to uh criticize anyone because we've been we've been taught by Malachi 4 how to worship how to celebrate this time so I'm not against any of you who are uh doing and being led by God to to celebrate during this time but we also know uh that he Jesus wasn't born in the winter [Music] time and we also know that he was born in the time of the spring when when Lambs are born and we also we also know that the Magi came brother and told him that birth was the memorial of the birth of Jesus Christ we don't when it happened God has given us is that all right he was born in a time when people could [Music] travel as we could recall the scripture he was born at a time of taxing Hallelujah and we know by God's grace as brother Bram teaches us that the the the uh churchan or the churches was not included in the celebration of his birth uh because when the wise men went to Jerusalem looking for him and looking for the star he was not there and Jerusalem presented the organizations denominations Hallelujah but God Amen uh chose three wise men Hallelujah and we know that these Magi represented ham sham and Jeff Hallelujah which are the the three pure races that was on the earth at that time it represented all people the blood of Jesus Christ represented it was a representation for all people hallelujah anybody that wants to be saved could be saved through the blood of Jesus Christ it doesn't matter your inheritance where you came from how you got here the blood of Jesus Christ still works Hallelujah we've learned in this last day look look around oh it's it's a real hard time it's a it's a difficult time Hallelujah but we find out that when the world celebrates Christmas they they celebrate Christmas as if they're worshiping ba Hallelujah and we know that when the when the three wise men came bearing gifts to Jesus Hallelujah they didn't have no Creeds they had no dogmas all they had was their hearts and their hearts were pure Hallelujah when the M men came to worship him as I said there was no distraction there was no organization of they were all Left Behind in Jerusalem guess we found out that in Jerusalem they wanted to kill him as a baby Hallelujah and in Jerusalem they killed him as a man Hallelujah They Crucified him in the most holy city on earth Hallelujah is that right but in the midst of all of that there were those who had a revelation who the Christ child was Hallelujah you see God never leaves himself without a witness Hallelujah he was born in the natural in a place called Bethlehem I'm not going to just preach on the Christ child I'm going to preach on you amen because you and I according to the brother Bram must be born in Bethlehem Hallelujah in a spiritual Bethlehem why is little Bethlehem right in paragraph 140 brother says all you Bethlehem dwellers Hallelujah I call for men Warriors who are not afraid I don't care if there's 800 standing on one side and 10,000 on the other I want Warriors who will come with me and cut a hole through this line of unbelieving philistine the World Council of church Hallelujah has got garrisons around the world trying to make it Creed and feed the people there's a world there's a fountain opening the House of David Bethlehem for sin and uncleanness brother sin is unbelief in his word hallelujah why you preaching this because the true bride of Christ will worship God in spirit and in truth hallelujah she will not mix it with CED and dogmas traditions Hallelujah but she will worship the Lord Jesus a war Hallelujah he says who Warrior that can see the Millennium coming what Warrior can see this great Holy Spirit come in the form of Jesus Christ the literal Body of Christ to take over again he saids stand with me Hallelujah is that right stand with me let's cut a hole through this denominational Creed let's get in there he's crying for a good fresh drink a Pentecostal Waters original Pentecost not a bunch of carrying on screaming and holling Hallelujah here I mean a genuine Holy Ghost baptism that produces the life of Jesus Christ back into the person Hallelujah now that's what the birth of Jesus was all about to bring The Life of Christ back to the believer Hallelujah and every true Saint or Christian must be born Hallelujah you must have an experience in the manger of your heart Hallelujah is that right there must be a birth Hallelujah is that right now as I said the whole church Church world didn't even know that the Messiah was being born Hallelujah only those shepherds in the field and the wise men who still seeks him Hallelujah as I said we had ham and Sham and Jeff the three pure nations of the world and everything else is a mixture Hallelujah come on somebody car Calvary removed all the curses of man so much so that the blood stood for for every tongue and Nation Hallelujah that's why the devil has tried to kill him Hallelujah the devil killed uh killed uh Abel thought he was killing Christ Hallelujah you understand me but then come there came one in the image of ad by the name of Enoch who beat Death beat hell beat the grave Hallelujah and that's the day we're living in Hallelujah in the day that the Bride of Jesus Christ will defeat Satan death hell and the grave Hallelujah this is what the birth was all about out to restore Fallen Adam back to his original state Hallelujah so let's worship him if we're going to worship him we worship Him in spirit and in truth hallelujah we don't come in church with a stagnated spirit Hallelujah we don't come in here dry cold and form Hallelujah but you know when you got the Holy Ghost in fire you are the light of the world you are the ls of fire Hallelujah and no matter where you go fire is fire hallelujah amen glory to God fire is fire Hallelujah you don't come in here with a style of worship Hallelujah because you don't know which way the fire going to go when the wind blows the fire may go with it goes wherever the wind blows it Hallelujah glory to God that's what we've got to press through we've got to press through all of this Creed all of the Govern we got to press through the system everybody want to look good Hallelujah but God don't choose those kind God CH choose the the the bad kind he go for the scum of the earth Hallelujah he goes for the prostitutes he goes for the drug at he goes for the SC he goes for those who can't live right Hallelujah he goes for those who who knows that their heart is like a Manger their heart are filed y better hear me but God said that he'll cleanse the heart he'll give you a heart of Flesh he take away the Heart of Stone give you the Flesh and he said he put his spirit your spirit Hallelujah he will give you a word he will give you life and I don't mean just a pin up life Hallelujah I don't mean I don't mean he's gonna give you something that you got to patch up and those of us who's got patch up lives you ought to be tired of it we don't want patch up lives we want a new life we want the Life of Christ hallelujah hallelujah is that right turn with me again to Matthew 2 Hallelujah you love the Lord you see the greatest gift God ever gave man was locked up in Christ amen when they saw Jesus many of them thought he was a son of fornication when many when many of them saw him they saw a Nazarite a nazarine excuse me and they thought can anything good come out of Nazareth some saw him as be Hallelujah the prince of the Devils Hallelujah the y'all understand me but then there were those who had a [Music] revelation like Hannah and and and and the other Prophet amen who stood there in the temple waiting for the coming of the Lord hallelujah y understand me when he came he came as a baby Hallelujah but when he left he left as a man God a king Hallelujah hey he said the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt in him Hallelujah don't you understand on this journey we' be born as a baby as a son and daughter of God but we got to mature we got to go through some hard trials we've got to go through some tests and this is why Jesus J said if you love me take up your cross and follow me Hallelujah Christianity is not an easy way it's a tough way Hallelujah especially now in this day Hallelujah where the world is so dark Hallelujah but the darkness cannot cannot put out the light somebody help me here no matter how dark it is light of God will always penetrate somebody help me here because you must understand that we're living in a dark age we can no longer play Christianity somebody must show the real light of God hallelujah but when you stand up for Jesus you can expect somebody to persecute Hallelujah for those who live Godly in Christ we suff persecution I'm not talking from the world talking about people in the message persecute you because your life is Holy because you live a Sanctified life and because you love to worship God somebody help me here listen we're living in a time where the true Christians are Vanishing away amen hallelujah the church might be growing but there's only a few Christian left Hallelujah I pray God I'm one of them Hallelujah it said the first verse now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem Judea in the days of Herod the king behold there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem J Hallelujah now it it's no wonder the prop God had to go to the West because the word of God said that they saw the star in the east that meaning they were in the East but they had to travel Westward to get Jerusalem Hallelujah and so that angel told Brother bam you stay here in Jeffersonville I can't use you why because the star must travel to the West somebody help me here and it was in the west where God opened the seals it was in the west when the mighty angel came down it was in the west we began to see the open booku it was in the west Hallelujah but now that same message is now moving from the west back to the east east all the way back to the West somebody help me here so there must come a Revival an Awakening remember the prophet of God says before the coming of the Lord there will be a final outpouring of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah on the of Jesus Christ why you're not ready as you are I'm not ready as I am Hallelujah I need more of him somebody help me here I need more Dynamics in my life Hallelujah glory to God say but they they asked the question where is born King of the Jews Hallelujah they pointed to to a place in Bethlehem Hallelujah but I asked you this morning where is Born the king of Jews today Hallelujah he in the manger of my heart he's born in the manger of your heart Hallelujah say we have seen his star in the east worship him let me tell you something the best way to worship someone is to pattern who they are Hallelujah if you going to worship Michael Jackson dress like him you're going to act like him you're going to do everything like him so when people see you they going to say he's mimicking Michael Jackson what I'm saying hallelujah you have seen people mimic every Presley Hallelujah they look like him they talk like him they dance like him everything like Elvis Hallelujah but they're just Impostors and that's how it is in the message we have Impostors oh but when the real Jesus is's on the inside of the heart you don't have to act like it it will live it way through you Hallelujah the Bible says you know that they are my disciples Hallelujah why because these signs shall follow them what was Jesus say everything I did do everything I did they will do likewise Hallelujah it won't be fake it won't be a religion it won't be an organization only the pure in heart shall see God y'all better help me here he said in that day you know that I'm in the father father in me and I am in you Hallelujah the Bible says the world will not see me but you shall see me Hallelujah are you seeing him this morning Hallelujah not in somebody else you must see him in your life Hallelujah glory to God Amen in little Bethlehem paragraph 79 Hallelujah brother ROM says and the name Bethlehem means the house of God's bread he says now how fitting that is to Jesus how fitting that is to Jesus the bread of eternal life Christ in the is the bread of life we all believe that don't we how fitting Bethleham there the bread center of the world was the bread Center of eternal life that's why the king and that's why the king had to be born in there he said in St John 6:35 I am the bread of life that comes from Out of Heaven your fathers did eat Mana in the wilderness and all are day all dead but this bread if a man eat of this bread he shall live forever Hallelujah then Jesus is the bread of life so the bread of life had to come at of Bethlehem somebody help me here what bread are you living off of hallelujah we're not living off the bread that was in the Holy place but we're living off the bread that was in the holies of holies somebody help me here when the prophet of God went behind the curtain of time Hallelujah he saw what the bread produced he produced a race a super race another race race that was was was made and created in the image and likeness of Jesus Jesus Christ himself he created a holy race you hear what I'm saying this bread has the power to transform you to change you Hallelujah into the very image and likeness of God this is the greatest gift ever given Hallelujah it was just in his baby form when it was in the manger Hallelujah but we understand that when Jesus was baptized at the River Jordan God came down in the form of the Holy Spirit and he said this is my be with son in whom I'm well pleased to dwell in Hallelujah glory to God what happened to what happened then he had to Die For You Hallelujah somebody help me he had to Die For Me hallelujah what do you mean the bread of life Hallelujah is that right when the devil came to him and took him up on the highest mountain and said everything I own you can have Hallelujah Jesus says not so it's mine anyhow Hallelujah Satan you must Bow Down and Worship [Music] me somebody help me here because when he made that statement to Satan you was still in him Hallelujah we are joined as with Christ whatever is is our Hallelujah so Satan is not ruling over you Satan is not ruling over me we are the rulers of Satan the Bible say if you resist the devil he will free from you I didn't say he would run from you but he will flee from you why because the devil knows when you know who God is the greatest gift ever is the Holy Ghost In You hallelujah amen oh my God and I'm so happy that God does not give us the Holy Ghost because we Merit it as brother Ben says he gave us the Holy Ghost cuz he favors us you can't earn it you can't work for it you can fast 40 days and 40 nights that ain't it Jesus came to save his own somebody help me here you might be as bad as Jacob you might be a thief you might be a liar you might be a shy but if that seed is in you one of these old days God is going to make sure you wrestle with the angel and guess what you're going to overcome the Angel God will fill you with the Holy Ghost in his time in his season God makes all things beautiful somebody say you don't look like a seed of God to me it all depends on what you're looking at cuz outside you see a dead man this flesh is dead but inside there's a God living inside somebody help me here it's nothing but the truth hallelujah I fell the other day and I really hurt my leg but the Bible said with the stripes I'm Healed somebody say you need to go to the doctor and in myself I'm thinking I did go to the doctor Hallelujah but I went to Jesus and then the devil tried to escalate the pain he tried to increase the pain Hallelujah but I know by the message brother bam said when a demon is Cast Away those first three days hallelujah it's going to be all right but that fourth day I believe he says the devil will come back and make you think you your your pain is greater he that's a witness that you been heal Hallelujah you see those little things that we we we fail to is Lay right there to help our faith Hallelujah Jesus never fails Hallelujah I'm not going to be too much longer but I just had to say the things I said they brought him gold frankincense and myrr and we know that gold represents deity Frank represent a sweet smelling savior Hallelujah and the represents death y'all know what I'm saying and all three of these characteristics or attributes must be in a Christian Life you must recognize you are deity Hallelujah and in your prayer life you must bring forth the sweet smell and understand like Paul said I Die daily you got to die daily Hallelujah is that right listen what the prophet said what did the go represents he was a king he wasn't to be made King he was born King hello you're not to be made bride you were born bride Hallelujah is that right you born King you're born priest Hallelujah and many of us we fail to see that we are the blood of Jesus Christ by the spirit and the power is still in the blood Hallelujah we just got somebody we need somebody that's going to believe this thing not intellectually your heart let me ask you a question can you imagine how difficult was for Jesus to to go up Calvary the pain that he had to endure Hallelujah and all the while he had you in mind you understand me I forgot who who preached that message he preached the message on value uh and none of the Angels could pay for your worth Michael couldn't do it Hallelujah Gabriel couldn't do it worm wouldn't couldn't do it Hallelujah none of the chief Angels could pay for your worth you were worth more than all the Angels so in order for it to be an equal trade God himself had to come pay for your word and the devil will tell you you're not worth anything he's a liar because God came down you understand me he didn't send a second person he didn't s a third person but he himself came Hallelujah in Jesus Christ was the god Elohim the god Jehovah [Music] jeh he was your creator Hallelujah and he's still working on me somebody help me here he's still God can you imagine all this power that you have in you and you keep it bottled up because of fear because of Pride because of your feelings and feelings has nothing to do with it I don't have to feel it the word says so Hallelujah sometime we feel like I'm not healed yet when you pray for healing and you really believe it you are healed it's your hope that gets you in the way that gets in the way I hope I'm Healed I hope I'm hope he I hope he did it and you know what the devil are tell you you're not even worthy to be healed that's one time I know he tells the truth hallelujah cuz I'm not worthy and you're not worthy but his grace abounds his Mercy abounds y'all better hear what I'm saying glory to God oh my listen he goes on to say he was God Eternal King he was a king so they offered gold and they offered frankincense that's a perfume very costly the best that could be gotten y y'all know how I I taught on frankincense yall know Frankin grow in a real rough place and and you don't find a whole lot of trees of rank frankincense it grows in a rocky a desert Place Hallelujah that's what makes it so worthy a praise that's what makes it so costly hallelujah amen Jesus was in a desert Place y'all better hear what I'm saying there was nobody how they ever who stood with Jesus Hallelujah even when it came to crucifixion all of his disciples scattered Hallelujah and when he went to Calvary he went there as a man all by himself oh my but when they squeezed him when they pressed him Hallelujah like the word say he's the lily of the Val GL to God he's my opium he's what I get high off of somebody help me here when nothing else Works Jesus always do Hallelujah that's the truth hallelujah yes sir he was a sweet smelling savior unto God for he went by Healing The Sick and doing good gold because he was a king and that's that's the mindset we're still in Sinners our mindset we still think Sinners saved by grace that's true but we don't remain Sinners you can't be a sinner and a saint Hallelujah we've got to start moving upward he said we have been made Kings and Priests you ought to act like like a king somebody help me here you need to perform like a king and a king words are words of authority hallel not your words but the words of the book Satan knows the word and you use the word Satan has to go hallelujah hallelujah some of us we've lost our joy we've lost our joy a long time ago it's apparent all over your faces Hallelujah you let the devil take your joy now he's laughing at you like he did at Samson you say you Bri I can remember when you used to do stuff you used to pray so many times a day you used to has whatever you used to do I remember but look at you now Hallelujah where are you now you know what you're doing treading that old meal you're going around in circles just like Samson you have allowed him to take your seven Thunders away you understand me but in the midst of the persecution God was growing his habit back and sometime in your life you need to reach back and feel that hair you got to come to see that God Covenant has been restored to [Music] you your strength everything you are everything he made you but the problem is we don't want to get down we don't want to Humble ourselves but but Samson humbled himself Hallelujah he said oh Lord once more restore me once more give me that power I used to have once more Hallelujah if I've got to die with the Philistines give me the power I used to [Music] have oh we could have be a sweet smelling savior let me let me go back I'm sorry his life so pleased him that God breathed in his holy and Holiness and Beauty Holiness and Beauty but it was his own Holiness reflected in him that's what I'm talking about and if it was God's holiness reflected in Jesus that's what we need I think about this all the time and I tell it we know that either death or the Rapture and we know that we must be prepared for either or brother random have said it over and over and over again if you don't have the Holy Ghost you're lost amen I don't care how many message churches you've gone to I don't care how many preachers you've heard need the Holy Ghost and guess what I don't have to tell you whether you got it or not you know whether you have it or not Hallelujah but you need to be wise if you know you don't have it like the Bible says you need to be like Jacob I know I'm blessed but I got to meet the blesser Hallelujah is that all right now they gave mer gave him mer and also anyone knows that myrr is a very costly but bitter her and a lot of us we don't like to go through the bitterness we don't like to go through the hard times God I heard a young man the other day he said Satan Satan tried to get me mad at God it's like a ant on the floor raising his fist to me and telling me why every time you walk it thunders you shaking my universe you know what it's in my hand squish the ant I give Grace to him y'all hear what I'm saying I can say hey you just don't understand who you Ming with Ming you know what I'm saying that's the truth you know y'all think I'm crazy but I talk to Nature Hallelujah when I've gone out and y'all I don't care I'm going tell you anyway cuz maybe it might help somebody when a bumblebee or any kind of bee get around me I warn him before the judgment I do I said okay I'm a servant of the Lord so don't come to sting me and if you try you're going to die right I I've been in Guyana with with Brothers mosquitoes everywhere and I said listen I'm a servant of the Lord I dare you to bike me and you know I didn't get bitten now y'all think I'm crazy I know but I got some Witnesses Hallelujah I got Jesse Smith Jess I got cam Smith cam Smith and they all look like they had been plagued why why why you not like that I said cuz I talk to those things now y'all think I'm crazy but when brother brandom talked to the bees was he crazy those bees when he talked to that that that bull that was the anointing of God it wasn't my ability but I'm trying to tell you God did it for me and I believe if you believe the word that way God will do it for you Hallelujah I believe that Hallelujah you love the Lord one more scripture Hebrews 2 you love the Lord he's giv you the greatest thing he can give you giv you the greatest thing he can give you you don't put the Holy Ghost up on a shelf you you cultivate it and brother Bram said you feed the Holy Ghost when you're reading your word that's where you get your strength he quickens that word to you and your strength comes through the word hallelujah first verse therefore we ought to give the most Earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest in at any time we should let them slip for for if the words spoken by Angels were steadfast and every transgression and Disobedience received a just recompense of reward brother brand says that these Angels were Messengers you know every word and understand it says you know when you transgress there that word when you become disobedient to it there's a just recompense of reward hallelujah what shall we escape how shall we escape if we nect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him Hallelujah god listen when brother R was preaching and all the others were preaching under thato that was God right god with skin on him God also be bearing them witness fourth verse God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own [Music] will when when Peter was at the gate of beautiful Silver and Gold Have I None such as I have give I the that was God God speaking through Peter because Peter can't heal nobody you can't heal nobody I can't heal nobody there's only one Healer and that's Jesus Christ himself Hallelujah every believer must produce gold every believer must produce frankincense did you know that that that the incent before you get into the holies of holies Saint it's your prayer so my question is is your bottle empty if there's no prayer there's no incense so if there's no incense you have stopped the order of God Amen yes and M which is bitter he must die to himself in order to produce Christ in other words we must die to ourselves in order to produce Christ I have another quote I'm almost done coming for little Bethlehem 19 Prophet God says Jesus was God not a Jew remember the blood cell come from the male sex and he was not a man or Gentile he God created in flesh we're not saved by the blood of a Jew or the blood of Gentiles we're saved by the blood of God he was God nothing less he wasn't Jew nor Gentile created blood in him God created blood in him he was a Jew he a Jew or Gentile he said if he was a Jew or a gentile we're all lost he was God in flesh now let me say this I know we've thought about it many times this is why Satan does whatever ever he can do to keep us from breaking through into that Holy realm because he knows the life of the blood is the Holy Ghost and once that life is in you it's not the life of a Jew it's not the life of a gentile but it's the life of God that's what it keeping us away well brother brother I believe that message you know I follow brother brand but I'm going tell you something everybody that followed Jesus didn't make it to Pentecost many of them saw the healings many saw the deliverances and all of this stuff and and you know it's so amazing how people have brought cre and dogmas into the message and some men will tell their wives you don't need the Holy Ghost they told you a lie are you going to make it because I'm going to make it How am I'm going to rest on you making it you I'm going to put my salvation in you yeah come again you understand if Mary had to get there who was called the mother of Jesus she had like the prophet of God said she had to go to Pentecost and she staggered like a drunkard that's another thing we don't mind dancing in our form but we have a problem when God wants you to dance like he wants you to dance have you ever danced without a beat Hallelujah glory to God I mean really dance the Holy Ghost got you moving and you don't know which way you're going to go Hallelujah I was at this church in I was at this church in Arizona and I was really jumping and everything and I almost tripped and I said Lord if I fall they going to see for the first time a Holy Roller cuz I'm going to fall and I'm going roll and have me a good time brother R said he' never seen a Holy Roller I've seen him I've seen him yes they were those who did roll on the floor scared me half to death during that time I wasn't a Christian now let me move on I'm almost done see I I love this message he said now that is the Revelation Jesus Christ is God this is the exposition the Jehovah of the Old Testament is the Jesus of the new and no matter how hard we try you can't prove that there are three Gods but it also takes a revelation by the Holy Spirit to make you understand the truth that he is one y yall hear what I'm saying it takes a revelation for you to understand that he is one it takes a revelation to see that Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the new Satan crept into the church and blinded the people to this truth and when they were blinded to it it wasn't long until the Church of Rome stop baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah what are you saying brother those who are not baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ have been blinded by the age Hallelujah we must keep our eyes on the cross see the greatest gift that God could ever give you was himself right those of us who married and you get all these gifts from everybody you love those gifts but the greatest gift is your husband or your wife you understand me and none of us would tray our our husband or our wives any gifts given y'all hear what I'm saying that's why brother brandham said out of all the gifts if I had to make a choice he said I would choose Divine love I choose Divine love over speaking in tongues I choose over prophecy I choose Divine love over healings I choose Divine love over everything why because love conquers all and love is the only thing that will not fail div is the only thing that will not fail yeah I got to read this and I'm closing this is true I am closing I've said that several times don't mean to be a li but this is true when a fellow receive Christ as his savior everything is on the housetop but but before this man can come into the baptism of the holy spirit this person he must first have a sanctifying process he must have a testing time in his life all of you had it he has this testing time every Sunday cometh to God is first scored chased and if we cannot stand the chastisement then it shows we're not children of God we are bastards and not children of God the Bible says but if we can stand and the chastisement knowing that all things work together for the good of them that love God then we are Sons and Daughters of God then he seals us with the Holy Spirit until the day of our Redemption Hallelujah he says see that's that's the chastisement The Strain the things we go through Hallelujah is that all right with you is what we must go through you see what I'm getting at if you believe it then let let's live like it let's produce what we're talking about that's what I'm talking about right there let's produce what we're talking about because that we keep our minds on the church and on this organiz ation on this group and this woman and that man he says take your mind off of them they'll fail put your mind on Christ on his [Music] word he say let him be your example not a man amen brother Brooks ain't my example Jesus Christ is my example I hope you got the point you got to cut through all of this stuff the message is right but there's God there to be somebody here besides myself that want to see this thing produce what it says I'm tired of the religion I'm tired of the facade I'm tired of Christians who know they need the Holy Ghost too Pride to Adit it hallelujah it's a it's amazing that many of us followed this message and you still don't know him Hallelujah but that's why God came we celebrate Christmas but just like the prophet of God says he talked more about his resurrection than anything Hallelujah and you and I must understand that the very Life of Christ is now being transferred to the believer Hallelujah that's how we see him not in some other man but know that he's on the inside of you Hallelujah remember brother Bosworth when he was about ready to die brother brandom asked him when is your greatest moment of of time he said right down brother BR said you know that you're dying he said I cannot die Hallelujah I've been I've died long time ago but he said this is the best moment of my life because I know that in just a moment's time Jesus is going to walk through that door see that's the kind of assurance we want that's the kind of assurance we need and I said Lord I says Lord whatever you do don't let me die in shame Hallelujah don't let me die naked but let me be clothed in your righteousness Hallelujah listen what the prophet of God said in my I'm and I'm closing he said I know you get up from the altar crying and boohoo squealing and slobbering he said but it brings life it takes the starch out of you it makes you something that you ought to be it takes all the world and stiff neck out of you and today we just walk up and say I take Jesus for my personal savior he said that will never take the place of a new birth and women come to the Altar and forget where they are who and who's around them until they really die out and are born again all night prayer meetings and the power of the Holy Ghost back get back into the church again that's what we need today is good old time St Paul Revival the Bible Holy Ghost preached back into the power theity PR in the power of the Resurrection Hallelujah that's what he said Paul said I didn't come to you with words to wisdom your faith will be built upon the wisdom of men but I come preaching the power of the Holy Ghost be buil upon the holy spirit church needs that today and when the subtit and and when we substitute other and get classy and starchy and stiff we're losing the very secret and our locks are being shaved off he said exactly oh Thea knows how to do it she knows just what to do that came from where has thy strength gone we going to pray I want everybody to pray pray in your own way you need more God ask God for more you need the Holy Ghost for the first time ask God for you need healing you need Deliverance ask God you need God to straighten out your husband you need God to straighten out your wife ask God for it whatever you need you need God to help your children be shy in your asking we ask too little the greatest thing you can ask for is The Souls of your loved ones worth more than a million dollars ask how to write she'll
