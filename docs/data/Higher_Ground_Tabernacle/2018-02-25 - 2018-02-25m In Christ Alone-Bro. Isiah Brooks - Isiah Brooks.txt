stand in Christ alone I place my trust and find my glory in the power of the Cross in every victory let it be said of me my my source of hope is Christ alone I must stop right there but I'm gonna finish that song I think I drunk a little bit too much coffee but I don't believe in getting losing so we're gonna sing it after the serve as letter stand it goes with the message in Christ alone thank God for His grace thinking for His mercy amen what would we do without the Lord Jesus Christ as we turn to the scripture we're going to come from st. John 8 we're going to read 42 42 to 47 verses then we'll go to 1st John 2 ready to have our sister grace with us and then we'll have we'll go from Psalms to German we're gonna read a couple of scriptures so I hope you don't mind your standing a while we're getting at the 42nd verse jesus said unto them if God we're your father you would love me for I proceeded forth and came from God neither came I of myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech because you cannot hear my word you're not of your for ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it and because I tell you the truth he believe me not which of you convinced me of sin and if I say the truth why do you not believe me he that is of God heareth God's words yeah therefore hear them not because ye are not of God first John to my little children beginning at the first verse these things write I unto you that ye sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous two more scriptures Psalms 139 23 search me O God and know my heart try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in me and lead me in the way of everlasting Jeremiah 29:13 and ye shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all your heart and I will be found of you saith the Lord let us pray father we thank you for your amazing great we thank you for being so good to us Lord you are better to us than we are to ourselves Lord I prayed that this morning you will touch the hearts of all that needs to be touched Lord just don't allow us to feel sorry for our transgressions but give us godly repentance that we will turn from our wicked ways help us now O God keep us in your name Jesus and father we'll be careful to give you the praise the glory and honor and your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated I like to entitle this message in Christ alone it is important that we understand where we are in Christ we know that Satan is the god of this evil age this age above all ages are the most deceptive so we can't just take our salvation for granted when we look through the Word of God we realize Amen it's not enough to follow our individual but you must follow the individual that's following God as Paul said follow me as I follow Christ we have been commissioned in this last day when the Lamb of God who is Jesus Christ took the book out of him who sat on the throne and he was the only one that could take the book he was the only one worthy Adam wasn't worthy Moses wasn't worthy Joshua was with him worthy none of the Apostles or prophets were worthy to take the book that book according to brother Branham was the book of redemption Adam would have redeemed his wife if he could have the first Adam but because he became sin himself he had not the ability to redeem his wife but we find out by God's grace that second Adam who was Jesus Christ because he was perfect in all of his ways and he obeyed the full Word was able to redeem us not just all us but all that was lost in the fall he redeemed heaven he redeemed earth he redeemed every fallen soul he gave everybody privilege to be a part of this Redemption brother branham said it like this he said a party is not a party except it be received as a pardon you and I realize that there are two seeds we understand that there are the children of God and there are the children of the devil a child of the devil could never be a child of God except the seed of God being understand we all at one point in time were like the children of Wrath do y'all know what that means predestinated to be to experience the wrath of God as Jesus said unto the Pharisees what's going to cause you to repent in other words he understood there was nothing in them that could cause them to repent and you and I ought to be so grateful that we can truly repent you find out in the Bible no we're never son of the devil fully repented even when Jesus Judas betrayed Christ he felt sorry that was a repentance but he did not feel completely repented because the repentance that he had it going to God from God it was directed him to the right priests true repentance takes you to the person in which you have offended hello that's why the Bible said if you have an art against your brother of your brother finding you you go to your brother not to your neighbor so we realized by the grace of God amen those of us who have been born in this old flesh this old body cannot be be saved if I want to say it like that in the way that it is it has a day of redemption when God will change because of the way it is made it can never meet heaven standards but God has come along and he's quickened something on the inside of us you know everybody said well God is love you know the whole world says it and they fail to leave out the part that God is a consuming fire God is a judge God is jealous you and I ought to be so happy because the Bible tells us that Jesus Christ is our advocate that is someone who would speak on your behalf in favor of you it is a person who speaks or writes something in support of a defense that's why the Bible said when we don't know how to pray the Holy Spirit on the inside of us will pray for us now you and I must understand that Jesus Christ came to save all that was in him not outside in him there's only one way to be in Christ that is you must be born again brother Branham said well in what is the Holy Ghost he said don't care how long it takes in other words we'll stay until we eat up your heart Wow because you'll never pull it in an unclean heart see it doesn't matter if you shake and quake jump and shout cry all night long if your heart is filthy God could never fill you with this Holy Ghost God will not dwell in an unclean vessel hello it doesn't mean that you're not justified but justification will not meet the criteria of this day because God is not looking for Bane's he's looking for a full matured woman a church that's ready to be wedded a church that is willing and ready to be his bride you understand me no wonder David said search me O God and know my heart see you and I we don't know it but God knows it and the Bible said that heart is wicked is the sea for and only God knows how to be sea full it is and can't be your own heart will deceive you if God is not there to help and you must clean it up you cannot walk in a in a in a filthy way and expect for God and men to fill you why because you must be sanctified well I know the message well those who knew the message in Moses day went through justification and they were in the wilderness going through sanctification many of them didn't even make it why because they were much as long as you murmur your heart is not clean as clean as God wants but because you have been created to be the Amen to every word that's in the book is that all right I'm talking about bride I'm not talking about church that's the difference between us in the church the church is the cage of every unclean and hateful bird the bride is liberated she flies and she elevates she's elevated by the Word of God she is now sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus yet and still we have these difficult times in our French and because we do we have an advocate hallelujah you said Brotherhood's will I make it only those whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life oh brother books will not reach perfection those who are names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life because that's the age those who win justification age met their criteria those who are in the sanctification age met their criteria so how can we say we're in the bride age and we have not even come through sanctification hey somebody you and I have got to get more serious about this Bible in our lives hello then the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother Branham said that's just the beginning you're gonna be you're just starting and you and I must understand amen that there is a journey is this okay I'm gonna take my time the Bible tells us accordingly in Jeremiah if we seek the Lord with all our hearts we will be found of him and he will find us thank God for the God that has that quickening power that can go beyond your flesh that can go beyond your spirit that can go right into the soul and quicken that predestinated seed to you and I must understand that there was a quickening power that literally quickened the foolish virgins hello yeah they were alive but they never made it to maturity they made it to sanctification but they never made it to maturity i'ma say it again at least the foolish virgins were sanctified is that the truth it is and you have a quickened who were dead in trespasses wherein in time past we walked according to the course of this world we did it according to the Prince of the power of the air yes sir the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience aha come on somebody that this spirit this worldly spirit because I'm gonna tell you something you're gonna have one or the other you're gonna have one the spirit of the world or you will have this period on the Otherworld right you're gonna have the spirit of the underworld are you gonna have the spirit of the upper world you either came from Satan or you came from God hello is this serious or not how do you know what you're doing where are you because brother Branham said what are you whatever you're doing now here that's what you're doing there he just said there because there could be here or there among whom also we all had our conversation in time past where in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature whoa by nature if you still fulfilling the lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires of your mind by nature the children of Wrath even as others hello that means you're not you're not you haven't gotten anywhere I'm trying to save folks this morning because we just believe because we haven't seen the message and we've heard the message amen in is we've made it but there is a process that you and I must go through to complete this journey that's why the Bible says they'd better before us cannot be complete without us we are the children of the capstone and you and I must come come through perfect love and this is what the Prophet God said this is one of the this is the third pool that cannot be mimicked you can't act like you got it it's got to be real mmm see it's not a not to to Paul said it I'm gonna say it like he said it you can understand all mysteries and have not charity which is a headstone capstone it profits you nothing what does he mean by that your worship is in vain your religious in vain is that right hallelujah Paul said we ought to run this race with patience we are encompassed about with a greater cloud of witness in other words we have a people that have gone before us and they can they can say to us it's possible it can be done you know I love what brother Hodges say well we sometimes make it so complicated and it's not complicated no more than a child being born or conceived as long as that egg or that seed is quickened life is gonna form the child but a lot of time we won't let that you know I'm saying we're not some of us may not be quickened yet though we know the truth though we know it's right but we haven't gotten to the place where we've had an intimate relationship with Jesus Christ hallelujah when you and I are birth into this thing and you and I must be birthed into the message or I came into the left you must be born in this message and I don't mean going in a family that's been in a message I mean born in the soul you said brother books what are you saying being a pastor I have seen a lot of things happen to people under the umbrella of the message and I have seen them jump I have seen them shout I have seen them in various ways and then they come around and aid doing some weekly thing there are certain things God will not allow you to do once you truly born again when you truly born again God is not gonna allow you to commit fornication he's not gonna allow you to commit adultery he's not gonna allow these things to happen to you oh he said grieve not for the Holy Spirit and he also said don't you try to break that seal you endanger your soul when you go that far because the sin that you do you know sinning not only against God but your sinning against your body whoo hallelujah anyhow yeah you're not gonna get no preaching like that but here cuz I'm concerned it ain't enough to jump in shop because God sent a prophet I'd do that to the people of God millions died knowing Moses was a prophet and I'm gonna keep reminding us you say well that's all he talks about until we see the power of God in his place where the brendham said whatever soul sees you so that's the harvest you gonna reap I'm trying to plant seeds so God can come in one day and quicken all of us amen and the fog are to come down in this place in the the fire department or come around this building thinking its own fire that's what I'm talking about you say it can't happen is happening in in California and I'm not talking about Azusa Street I'm talking about a company some years ago amen a group of people was praising God only it happened twice to be to be sure to make you assure of it and I've got some witnesses still living who was there when the fire department came thinking that the building was on fire young people that God Amen save to the uttermost people who were in gangs right some of the women still walk like men it tried you know what I mean you know God it takes time to get get all of that out of here yay but yeah and still they are witness out that Holy Ghost he's the same yesterday today and forever see we are born in this world amen natural beings created in the in the in the bad image in an image of a falsehood if I can say it like that don't we be you know a sons in God sons and daughters of God we were born children a raft we had the appearance you know we look like serpents we act like serpents we did everything the Serpent's did we lie we still we cheated we did everything serpents did a would do but only inside of you was a real seed gene of God that's all God is interested in right he's only interested in that seed in you that he can quicken and bring to life to be formed and shaped in his image is that right listen but remember Satan was what was the Holy Ghost given for he said but you got the nature of the place your form from you've got the nature of the place you're from that's what I'm trying to say a roman comes over here he scratches his head a german comes over here an american comes over there goes over there why you've got the spirit of them countries you come from that's what make us so different to the world you from above you are born you're a citizen of another kingdom you believe it that's what the Holy Ghost is is to make you a citizen of the kingdom of God if you are citizen of the kingdom of God how does it make you act like God does in his kingdom now what does God do in his kingdom it's holiness righteousness purity of thought purity of mind power love going to be the lost right going to the loss healing the sick performing miracles going doing great things they to the world you look crazy and they say them guys are off at their heads but you are a citizen of the kingdom that right one more scripture you want to write it down John 12:24 let me quote it if a corner we falls into the ground except it died it cannot break forth another life and that's what Jesus did he died so he can bring forth another life and you must die you must die in order to bring forth this life of Christ I'm not saying that safe but we're working with rapture material hallelujah we want to be changed and raptured amen when Christ come and thought people were not so far from that day that's why brother Barron said escape here the quickly that's back then how urgent it must be now since that timing right one thing for certain when it's all over you as individuals will have to face God face to face this message will either bless you this morning or condemn you this morning hallelujah but to us there is but one God the Father of whom are all things and we in him and one Lord Jesus Christ by whom are all things and we by him the Holy Spirit said that's that's what it is we hear the things that we have jet we're justified as though we've never seen it before and God didn't clear the record folks that's to the people who's got the Holy Ghost that doesn't apply you you're reading somebody else's letter that's to the person who has the Holy Ghost because at that point the Holy Ghost is justified you he sanctified you and he's brown match out of your life and now he's living in the place that he built you for there's one body and one spirit even as ye are called into one hope of your calling one Lord one faith one baptism is that right so the water doesn't save you it's a baptism you must do it because he commanded but that's not the thing that save you the thing that saves you is when you're born again of the Spirit up to the new potential by one spirit are we baptized in to his body the word is in in him in in that's the word we're baptized in to him right did not Christ come amen - to save and to gather all all together those in heaven those in earth in him no not those only outside in him those who are in him those who are a part of his body those who have been baptized and filled with the Holy Ghost those who are spiritual and spiritually minded one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and we're in you all in Christ alone right but into every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ because we're in him we still have measures of faith in him is that all right Ephesians 1 I'm a hurry-up 3 through 7 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us with spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ not out but in right according as he have chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love hallelujah and how can you be blameless unless you have his love in you right his love makes you bearing this hallelujah we are accepted in the beloved in him and that's the Holy Ghost people hallelujah having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace where he have made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his glory grace you understand me so we realized by God's grace we we are in him is only in him that we'll take a flight like I said to the church down in IO city my God is like a magnet if that magnet piece is not only inside of you when he began to pull up you will not go anywhere even if you've got a piece of him in there if you bolt it down by some denomination or some organization or some ideology Amen it will not work because he that the Sun set free is free indeed then where the Spirit of the Lord is there's Liberty my thing is with too relaxed but too relaxed what will it relax it like a Bible says they're taking e is e is an ease over there in Zion that ease hallelujah hey man but you and I must understand if that spirit attack the early church if that spirit of tecna's Israel it will attack you oh you got it made oh we can rest only when we're baptized into him because this is the rest that's your Sabbath when you have finished the course amen coming to that place where you know that you know that you know that you know Amen that Christ is in you is that right and what is the whole purpose see we have seen these things we've seen God move in justification we've seen him move Luther and Westley we've seen a movement of God historically you know even even in the West Western are the Wesley's our revival they had miracles and science of miracles and sign is not something that just started in the church and it doesn't declare that you're saved you can prophesy still be lost right because I'm a preacher doesn't make I make me saved hallelujah you now understand we are saved by grace don't you understand my point is what we need to do is enjoy this grace by showing God how much we appreciate his grace by seeking his face seek my face while seek his faith face while he may be found is that right now the Spirit of God has worked under justification on the Luther sanctification on the Wesley baptism of the Holy Ghost on the Pentecost and where it it in the last day performing and doing the very same things that it did when he was it it was in Christ what is it the church and Christ has become one so what do you say is it used to be two but now God is making the two line y'all understand me in other words the fullness of Christ that's what the seals were all about to show us amen that God has poured all of himself into his bride there used to be some in the church but guess what happened they locked him out they kicked him out now the whole fullness of what was in them who they were the shock y'all understand that and then now the fullness of Christ is in his bride that's not some cliche it's not something that we're just saying it must be a reality as soon as they connect together that last link and that's what brother let him call us he called us the last link she'll go through the sky shouting up will come Wesley Luther and all the rest of them back in those days he that were first would be less and he that's last will be first and there will come the resurrection hallelujah we're at the end time listen that's what the Holy Ghost does the Holy Ghost by justification sees just a light shadow of it the Holy Ghost by sanctification a little deeper shadow of it the Holy Ghost by the baptism of it a deeper shadow now the Holy Ghost by the resurrection of it it's person being in him here forming signs and wellness like he did at the beginning glory going to call me a holy role in how you might as well get started now what was he saying see what we understand is that what Jesus what brother man was doing he was showing us that Jesus Christ that was once dead throughout the church ages you understand me had a resurrection the resurrection like Lazarus on the third the fourth day here a hero's right right the fourth age was what justification lad was come for right he comes up right but then Luther say Wesley said you must be sanctified take those grave clothes off harlot is that right all right it didn't stop there they took the grave clothes off all the Lazarus got his breath back and everything else but what was the next scene he was sitting at the supper table eating with Jesus and they want to kill him all over again so you look at this thing you see that this thing is a real a real event that is happening right now and it's a secret to the world everybody didn't know where Jesus was born they don't even know he was on the earth except those who were praying and believing that the Messiah was to come in that season right so we look at this response says listen in this day God has given you an I in Christ alone he has given you and either very mystery of God that was hidden before the foundation of the world we said God is in Christ but Christ was in God right now he says Ephesians 1 9 having made known unto us the mystery obvious what will according to his good pleasure with he have purposed in himself what was God's mystery what was the will of God I'll tell you if you take Genesis and you go back to Genesis and and you find out that God tells Adam the first thing he tells Adam when Adam becomes a a living being he says be fruitful and multiply it was right then God showed the purpose of his wheel not just Adam being multiplied but God was to multiply himself because on the day of Pentecost he brought forth his first children with first was 120 baby multiply three thousand daily multiply five thousand so it was God a creation of himself that's what we're supposed to be and the only way that ever happened we must have a spirit in us now the secondary holy goes that just give us emotional expression but a Holy Ghost that would change us from the inside out something amen that becomes so real to us that we forget our hadiya's we'll forget all of the things that we plan to do and we'll focus on what he wants us to do is that the Bible that's the Bible yes by great you saved and raised us up together and has made us to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the age to come he might show the exceeding riches of His grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus well for by grace are you saved through faith and not of yourself it is a gift of God oh my goodness folks it's a gift [Music] oh-ho I got to do this and that's why we messin up cuz oh you gotta do it ain't ain't no fasting in reality it ain't house ha how loud you scream is in my heart that melody of Jeor divine yeah is in my heart for I am his and he is mine you ask me why I sing and shout is in my heart it's in my heart she has to be a creation of God the creation of God is not in your liver it's not in your mind it's in your heart for by grace you're saved through faith that not of yourself it is it is the gift of God not of not of works lest any man should boast anybody can boast in here I know this sounds let me tell y'all something I'm really serious about it I really am and I don't know you know my way of preaching is not so popular the way it used to be because I used to think about you know just diving in there for the deep things of God and bringing it to the people and oh you know I became an actor in the message that's what they become some entertainer but Jesus never entertained anybody he went straight for the heart is that right he laid it out and then he left it up to the people to do whatever they had to do with it because you know why Jesus knew that all wasn't here but he understood it I laid that word out my people will hear my voice and that's what we're working with it's not it's not how well I can say it and you know articulate that's nonsense if God wanted that he would have gave us a property that had a DDD ldd but he took a prophet who only had a sixth grade and whatever education seven you know what I'm saying my point is this is when the Bible is so simple brother what I'm trying to bring to you is not complicated you know I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna give you one word to total surrender that's it total surrender surrendering everything and one thing about that you can't lie to God you can lie to yourself but God knows what's happening in your heart when Ukraine hmm oh my but we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath ordained that we should walk in them right you know what all day mean it means you enact amen it means to establish by law or to decree or to give orders right or to do or to distant or predestined that means God predestinated a people you and I to walk it to live it it's not because you desire to do it he gave you the desire to do it why because he knew that he gives you the desire to do it you do it see that's what I'm saying it still Christ alone everything that we do is because Christ ordained it to be so it's okay o Lord Ephesians 2:12 and 15 I got a few more scriptures but let me just going I'm not gonna be too much longer give me a few more minutes and at the time we were without Christ being alienated from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope without God in the world but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ for he is our peace he's mine I don't have to be afraid of going to hell hallelujah amen every disease that Satan put forth Amen at me or you God has given us a word and a blood that will conquer everything but you got to have faith you got a faith you got to put the faith there but it's there y'all believe that the Bible said all things are possible didn't that to them that believe all things what devil can hold me down except God's will be done there if God has put me to a test that's God's business I'll go through the test but at the end of the test gets up guess what you and I come out out as a winner hallelujah think about it if God is living in you every time you commit a bad Act you put in God through such a nasty thing he don't stay there that's why he moves off and watch you do whatever you're gonna do and if you don't have to repent he won't ever come back down I was there I must identify with him y'all believe that maybe I'm crazy you don't the people thought when brother Brandon was preaching that message that man then really lost his mind but the title of his message was the mighty God unveiled before us my and you think about yourself how would I don't fully understand it but I know wherever God is I am yo y'all choke though network but it's the truth because if your spirit is in me wherever he goes I go with him I may not see it I may not feel it but whatever God is doing in his holy spirit is in me I'm doing it with him uh y'all know how those mommy used to say you know that baby comes out and he's gonna either love pickles or he gonna hate him cuz when I was pregnant I just eat pickle pickle pickle pickle with some ice cream sometimes those baby come out they want some pickle and ice cream sometimes they don't want to have nothing to do with pickles and ice cream cuz momma over fed them pickles and ice cream you understand me it's what the mother whatever she does during her pregnancy will affect the baby ha because wherever she goes the baby goes my grandbabies most of them come out praising the Lord because of me now they come out prisoners because of their parents their prayers praise the Lord and I know Amen melody and she get all of that energy amen because I think she kind of might a shower with her morning if she shouted with any of the babies and she comes out with all that energy yeah I don't believe that but it's true whatever you do and they always told told my wife says whatever you do when you get pregnant don't you lay around do things because if you don't you lay around your baby will come out lazy that's true I'm telling you all of something here hallelujah you are energetic Amen a fellow was telling me the other day that during the time that he he was exercising a whole lot Amen and stuff like that anyway his wife became pregnant and said that baby is so energetic they can't holler do none with him but you got to understand those things do affect children whatever God is doing will affect us hallelujah Jesus even said father I have one request wherever I am I want them to be there too hallelujah amen so you and I must understand him and that we were there for the RAM said I was I was with John the Baptist and before them critics I've seen the Spirit of God descending I heard the voice of God say this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to dwell in yes sir I sure was identify with him that's exactly I was identified there at the grave of Lazarus when he raised up Lazarus I was identified the woman at the well when he told her her sins yes sir what do you say I was there how come that's why I can say a man that's why I can agree with it that's why I could say yes it did happen hallelujah I was there with Noah come on somebody with Noah preached 120 years I was there I don't need scientific proof because I was there the Spirit of God tells me I was there you said well what do you mean because it's no longer Twain is one hallelujah and with one body honey we were baptized by one spirit hallelujah and wherever that spirit is that's where we are that's why the Word of God said where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty because nothing can buy in God not to get hold of hallelujah nothing hey man can take his Liberty away because he is Liberty is that right he said listen I was with 120 in the upper room who was there were you there I was identified up there with them I feel religious he said oh my I was up indentified there I'm on one of them I was identified I got the same experience they had hey somebody I remember I was out doing our ministry one of the brothers my mouth is pretty dry drink a lot of coffee but anyway we we we were there at the prison ministry and I told the man about acts 2:38 I told him how I got the Holy Ghost he said you didn't get it like they did I said yes I did he said but didn't you you see the pillow did you see the fire and LexA fire he shut me up I did not see the lick of fires huh not being not bad he'd been but years later hey man we was under 10 meeting brother amen and all of a sudden a thunderclap that killer fire was like a whirlwind see it was I wouldn't the only one did you see it it was 300 of us in that's in it looked like a fire when the fire through the audience like that I couldn't turn I couldn't say nothing everything was filled but as I looked there was a fire right there in front of me hallelujah see nobody I felt like a wind just blew all the way through me hallelujah nobody can take that from me hallelujah I could see that man again I tell him I got it just like the Bible saying hallelujah I got it just like the Bible said hallelujah whoo yes down there South Carolina when we first had our 10th meeting we were just coming into the message Amen wasn't hardly any any black people are colored how do you want to say it was in the message amen and here we come home we shook what we shook Columbia South Carolina hallelujah we had the Pentecost just the Baptist to Catholic everybody got together get stirs went on the radio television whatever and held up brother branham book and said don't listen to these people they are preaching a false doctrine hallelujah but the more they preach that the more we grew harder to you hey Marian God did that you can go down there now they just celebrate it a few months ago a mana anniversary everybody remember him and we had prophecies that were accurate we had tongues and amen we was deeper had in our church with prophesy things and there being a paper the next day front page what the government was doing so you can't tell me these gifts don't work I've seen him work hallelujah I remember the time he come up the angel sang here the angel some down in Mullins one day they got it on recording the brothers supposed to be sending me the recording he said I've still got it brother Brooks I say send me a copy brother hallelujah the power God was so great amen the Angels the choir from heaven came and joining owners see it's real real why because when we came to the message we didn't know nobody's doctrine all we knew was what he said was right we believed it just the way it was we didn't have no idea what the thunders was we didn't even realize we were the thunders hallelujah Amen God was sponsoring through South Carolina and that's how all those churches are right now starting in Columbia South Carolina almost all you love the Lord oh it's real people is real hallelujah we saw eyes of the blind open there was a brother who had no eyes God gave him eyes you don't have to believe it it's true in him there's a sister who was born blind God gave her her eyesight her mama came back the next day because she wanted her eyes to be healed and God didn't give her her eyes her sight and then the mother got jealous of those sister and said well if you if you if you if I forgot how she said it but the point is she got jealous and told her I'm gonna report it to the bureau she blackmail her own daughter I saw that later on the television set one day amen I was just visiting you on the news and they were saying she's amazing being blind and yet she can do all these things that's because she could see she wanted her money you understand me she been both around all alive she's still one of the money to come in that's wicked though yeah it's wicked hehe but that was one of those things mama had something to do with it may God and give it repentance you love the Lord he said listen I was a witness the mighty rushing wind coming I witness dad I felt the power of God as it shook I was with them that spoke in tongues have you ever seen a blind person ride a bicycle no that's for the one who was doubting it she was caught riding a bike and she was not bumping up into anything you sure what do you mean brother how you know she was by and she was blind it was a family of blind people anyway you can't convince people all I can truly say is I know this message is real hey no matter what people say I know it's real it works hallelujah mmm he said I was there amen when when Peter then was in jail and the building shook at the prayer meetings and the building shook where they were setting I was identified there with them you know what I'm saying you know a lot of time you know when brother Branham talked about hey if people people look at us and and that's why I came settle for a dead church I can't settle for this calmness that's not message I don't know what it is but it's not message because we supposed to be above Pentecost it's gotten so bad that people try to tell you how to worship we have a guideline the only guideline that we have is that we're not to do rock and roll when it comes to worship you understand me y'all love the Lord see you and I must understand I'm identified with a group that knows he's unveiled I love brother Berto that knows he's the same yesterday today and forever that knows that this is not a fanaticism it's Jesus Christ is saying yesterday today and forever I'm identified with that group here yes sir they're called a bunch of here heretics yet a bunch of fanaticism on the count of the word of God I want to see some fanaticism in this place the fanaticism you know what fanaticism when you get to the place where you don't you shatter so much you don't even know winner stop you don't scream so much you know it's just beyond it goes beyond extreme but that's bring it to the balance you come in here not to be taught I am NOT a teacher per se I do know how to teach but I love to preach it is the preaching of the gospel it is the atmosphere that brings amen the power of God down Paul said I did not come to you with excellent specie I'm glad I'm not a teacher per se now that the pastor must be apt to teach I know how to teach you you want me to teach you something tell me what it what you want me to teach and I can do that by God's grace but my point is it is the power of God I try to bring in this place amen so the anointing can destroy the yoke but if you and I I'm not pulling for the I'm not in there no you're gonna be broken you're gonna hear this word and leave out just as Drive should come in I'm talking to everybody from the pulpit all the way back to the door we need God in this place I'm not like these message churches what they doing they drying up they're talking about what they got and ain't showing nothing there's got to be a people that want to see God who want to see him like I've seen him when I was first illuminated I want to see him know is that when God healed me from cancer you know you think you know the church would have went up in an uproar over praise the Lord take what let cancer strike somebody in here I hope not but when God heal you from it it ain't gonna be praise the Lord [Music] every denomination available every sound barrier you know and it's true and I'm closing I'm closing we my point is everything got to be in him in him you know I think that's why God just didn't leave John on the earth he brought John up come up hither see because there was a certain plane John had to be on in order for God to reveal himself to him y'all won't Revelation y'all really want God to unveil things to us I'm closing I know I know I know God is more than able to do that but it is there how could I say it I could imagine what you're going through without joy because the joy of the Lord is our strength and if you don't have joy you have no strength physical strength is not gonna beat the devil you got to have some supernatural strength and you and I must understand Lord restore my joy I said a lot of things this morning only to quicken or to make you think I want you to do inventory on yourself I can't do inventory you must know where you are I can't do it I take tally of myself every day throughout the day the devil can't tell me nothing when it comes to myself because I know myself you understand me my portion is this is what I said to the Lord on my way down here I says Lord not only me for some way are we gonna have to have us a service a funeral service a funeral service where all of us die to ourselves and I want God I said Lord you the only one that can orchestrate this service you can bring this on the scene I can't touch the people hard I can't go in there and make them see how serious a time it is but you are day me God sent me here you said what brother was what listen people I know I've been sitting here for a purpose I'm not imagining nothing I've seen God walk me through this thing and I have been sent here for a purpose and that purpose shall and will be fulfilled there is something that God is going to do for this church just prior to the rapture I know that and I am here for that purpose and I'm gonna preach what he tells me to preach and then you may not like it because it's not sounding good to you all who I know that you don't know nothing until what you've got in your head is in your heart that's when you know it it ain't your head that God is working with that's what the devil got a lot of people could deceive by their hair knowledge of this message it's not there that's not where God converts you it's in your heart you know that's the thing that made me know I needed more because when I was in the Pentecostal church I could sing at the shower I could dance but there are areas in my life I had no control of I felt like a city without walls no defense when this message came to me hallelujah oh it changed me hallelujah and even in my carriers I was strong not because I did it he did it oh you said my brother burns have you ever had any trouble in your life absolutely I've been just like David sometimes feeling like I'm gonna fit all by myself but at the same time God David cried out Lord deliver me and every time I've cried out to my god for deliverance he has to live with me that's all you got to do he's just that real he will deliver you how can you go before God at the end of the dancer's Lord I just need to deliver us and he gonna ask you why didn't you ask for deliverance why didn't you get delivered when you saw me there you knew I was there and I was there to deliver you ain't nothing too hard for God last and there's nothing too hard for God I want to be in him totally in him if I got to lose my mind to make it that way so be it walk the streets like a bomb so be it doesn't matter what he needs me to do I want to do just that y'all don't want to that's fine but all I could say is pray for me pray for me please because I see things in this Bible that I thirst for and I want it everything that he has shown me I thirst for it and I want it and I believe he's gonna give it to me yes in its time but I'll never give up on God because God has never given up on me y'all mind if I sing that song he's the Lord you maybe see that then just let me sing this song I gotta get I gotta do this God wanted me to sing it and the devil don't want me to in Christ alone we'll our glory though I could pry myself in battles one oh I been blessed beyond measure and by history alone I'll overcome oh I can stop and count successes like time I Munsey my hand but though the trophies could not equal to the grace by which I stay and in Christ alone I put
