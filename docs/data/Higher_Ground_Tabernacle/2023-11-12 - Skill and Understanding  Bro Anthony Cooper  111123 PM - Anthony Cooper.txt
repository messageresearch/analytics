my children was little he would have us come preach for him of course his family was little and all thato amen and now they they they're grown amen and I'm going to let him introduce his family but they have made my day we have a had a wonderful Fellowship not prolonging the time I want brother uh brother Cooper to have you know his Liberty and uh you know he has a special message I believe that he wants to impart it's of the Lord and we're trusting that each and every one of us will be blessed by i i i this is the only mic we have brother I don't have a callar mic I think I think they're afraid to give me one of those but by the grace of God come brother may the Lord bless our brother Cooper Hallelujah [Music] thank [Music] you it's always wonderful to be among the saints of God and uh as brother Brooks was saying we know each other for a long time and sometimes God have to keep things a certain way for a particular [Music] season I believe the season tonight starts tonight and it starts with you I know for [Music] years that You' have heard what the prophet has said but you have never heard about yourself and I want to share with you that you were with God before the world began and you had to leave heaven on Earth to come through predestination everyone that had to leave heaven to live on Earth had to be predestinated including Jesus Christ so if Jesus Christ had predestinated it means that you have to be predestinated amen amen so tonight I want to share with you why you were so mindful or why God was so mindful of you because your life reflects reflect the intent that God wanted see manifest on the earth and you here to bring that manifestation reality amen amen we amen so I want to invite your attention to Daniel Danel I going to maybe read from the from the eth verse or so and uh also and Daniel 9 so I want to let's start from let's start from uh Daniel the 8th chapter the 15th verse and the 17th verse says speak on this RSE keep this see and it came to pass when even I Daniel had seen the vision and sought the meaning behold there stood before me their parents of a [Music] man and I Heard a Voice uh sorry I heard yeah I heard a man's voice between the banks of Uli which said which called and said Gabriel make this man to understand the [Music] vision in the nth chapter the 21st verse and 22nd yeah while I was speaking in prayer it's good to think things to the Lord and prayers that right even the man Gabriel whom I've seen in the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly and touch me about the time of the evening oblation and he informed me and talked with me and said oh Daniel I am now come forth to give the skill and understanding let's bow head Heavenly Father we have just read portions of your word today tonight and do we just want you to come through the Office of the Holy Spirit and provide us with a content to the text that which we have read May the may you bring and give us the SCP understanding that we may be able to [Music] magnify and glorify your wonderful and holy name and may [Music] we be able to say on that day we have not returned onto the void but we have accomplished everything that thou has given us to do grant us God and receive glory and honor for thyself in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen amen amen amen amen you may be seated amen do you love him amen so I have a little thought that I want to share with you tonight skill and understanding like I said for 58 years you have been reminded what the prophets have said and sometimes these reminders even though it was inspired by God but there was still something that after he left that was still missing from from this message and we can see from the Bible that the son of man was the one that so good seeds he saw the word and the field in which he swed the word was the world this message have gone around the world the son of man he did exactly EXA what God wanted him to do the Earth was swn with the word of God but just like Daniel Daniel who sought God for the meaning of the vision he took it to God in prayer and God heard the prayer of Daniel and dispatch the man Gabriel So if you have to see Gabriel today you would see a man but he's still the Archangel of God it doesn't it does it doesn't matter of what he he looked like but pay attention to his message oh Hallelujah do you love him amen God knew that Daniel needed to understand the vision just like they true ministers today like Daniel a genuine minister of God given a true vision from [Music] God but didn't understand the vision of God but the son of man was not the only one the so seeds on the Earth when the enemy sow his seed he sold the seed so close to the to the wheat it look like the same thing yes sir oh hallelujah hallelujah but Jesus said we have you can you you can tell by you tell them by the fruits so we see that the son of man he s seed of the word and caus us to come out from our denominations come out from Men's ideas in different isms in this system of the world but the enemy would not leave what God has have done and just to have God get all the victory because Satan said in his heart I would exalt myself above the stars of God I said above the stars of God and you are the stars of God and Satan Satan have tried for 58 years to exalt himself above you amenu you know some who have hunted with William br you say they call him Billy so he Billy to them said if you love me you call me your brother so so some call him brother brandom and he was brother to them and some call him a prophet but to call him a prophet shows the blindness that is today because we have to see him as the manifestation of the word of God the word of God made flesh and we Are Witnesses of what God have done that God God have made his Word Flesh in our time oh h Hallelujah that was a wave Chief to let the devil know what he saw with he will see with you oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah do you love him he say malach said there has to be another Ephesians but the serpent seed could not understand predestination because God said those that I forew I justify so therefore we cannot justify ourselves God has to justify us that's the grace of God to us that we are Justified that means that when God look at us he sees someone that is Justified hallelujah amen amen those that he justified he script says he already glorified but between justification and the glorification of us there's a a middle part that you must do a sanctification amen amen sanctification Sanic is the prerequisite to receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the thing about it is this when we first come to God to give our hearts to God we had to repent that means whatever you used to do you don't do it no more but we have to understand that we were born in sin shaped in iniquity and come into this world speaking lies but God made a way of escape to overcome ourselves so sanctification is to bring our human Spirits in subjection to God's word God wants us to to work with him you know the scripture when he said let us make man in our image after our likeness and Jesus when was here he said be therefore perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect you have to be in the same image and likeness of almighty God and so doing because who was he talking to God who said let there be light and there was light didn't need no help when he when he told amen the waters to to to to to separate for the land appear here it needed no help when he created the birds of the air the creatures of the sea the fs of the air he needed no help but he needed help to make man he said God as powerful as he is would need help to make man now he didn't want to make mankind or a kind of a man he wanted to make a man amen amen he said let this man have dominion over everything that he have created it took Malachi 4 to come to let us know that we were with God before the foundation of the world but it didn't make much sense to us because we look at ourselves and remember the times that it wasn't so nice so how could someone like me be with God as holy as he is and I'm here on the earth doing things I'm not even proud of but Jesus said be therefore perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect then oh Hallelujah after the serent seed begin to spread his seeds on the earth it did not start with the word because God made man first with a thought of a word and he Express the word he made man let us make man after our own image and our likeness the serpent seed try to make you quotes you are not predestinated to be a quote you are predestinated to be the word that's why for 58 years the quotes didn't do anything it accomplished nothing all it did it made you erts on what the prophet said but it didn't make you into the image and likeness of almighty God so therefore you couldn't see yourself in the same way that God saw you he he said he leave them alone remember remember the this the the seeds and the tears he said let them alone let them grow together is that right let them grow together the time will come I will send some I will give some apost a prophets pastors evangelists and teachers to bring them into Perfection the the the the ministry of the fivefold minist the true fivefold Ministry is to perfect you only the vi Ministry have the understanding to know how to make man according to the pleasing of almighty God they're the only ones ordained to make you that when God sees you he see a perfect reflection of [Applause] himself so with all the quotes that was quoted I had to realize that there was something missing and I realize that what I needed was to be another Ephesians then Paul let me know that God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us this you and me he blessed us with all spiritual blessings so that means there's no blessing that we have not [Applause] received in other words God had nothing back from you and I that means the full counsel of God has been made available to you and I amen Ser is blessed with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ Malachi 4 came to introduce us to Christ we thought that malach came to introduce us from To The Man From Galilee but he and talking The Man From Galilee he too had to become Christ so what Malachi for came to do was to introduce you to yourself the person that is sitting next to you is a mystery of of God turn to the person on right and say God bless you am it's hard to it is hard to to think that you are a mystery of God you such a mystery that you yourself it takes God to hide the his own Mystery to the individuals that are the mysteries of God so how would we come to the understanding that we are the mysteries of God we need to have that understanding so God held that back and save it for the true fivefold Ministry see anybody can say that they they are a member of the F but they can't prove to you that you are a mystery of God because they want to promote themselves they can't promote you and leave theel out to promote themselves and blame you for not being a Christian some even say to be a Christian you should get 30 more people and bring them to church that's not what God said Jesus became the word while he was walking out of the river Jord and when the enemy came and show him all the kingdoms of the Earth he told him thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God because he understood his own [Applause] predestination hlu and oh hallelujah hallelujah I want you know that Amen Let me I'm trying to find uh okay okay I'm in the right book and I just found the scripture I want you to see the soul of Jesus Christ see many people know they have a soul but they don't know what it is and they don't even know the reason for having it but that's where God hit the mystery hu Isaiah is chapter 9 the six verse this see he said For unto us a child is born a son is given the government shall be upon his shoulders his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace when Philip asked he said show us the father and we suffice Jesus turned around happen with you so long a time and asked me to show you the father when you see me you see the father [Applause] amen before Jesus came on the scene Isaiah prophesied that seven 100 years before Jesus was even born Jesus was predestinated to to to Isaiah 9:6 one time some Jews send some people to to John um yeah John the Baptist he said are you that Prophet are you he that is that was to come oh oh glory be to God Amen Dodger and are you here and so they take a few oh I got Jews sent priests and Levi from Jerusalem to ask John who thou he confess and deny not but confess I am not the Christ they asked him are thou Elias he said I'm not thou that prophet he answered no no then they said to him who thou that we may give an answer to them that sent us what sayest thou of [Music] thyself he said I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness as said elas what John was saying whether they understood John or not John was saying I am the word of God prophesied by Elias recorded in the scriptures made [Applause] manifest Jesus asked what did you go to see The Reef shaking did you go out to see a prophet I say unto you much more than a Prophet this is he which is written I sent my angel before your face to prepare your way amen amen amen Jesus was saying that John was not a prophet he was much more than a prophet am another another one uh over in I think it's Romans yeah amen I want to show you amen okay let me go let me go I a quicker see I like the proof Pro what I'm saying by the word I'm not using quotes you you have some people take pride to be floating on the quotes I like to know that I'm locked in with Jesus I'm in Heavenly places with him amen oh my I'm trying to find something here amen okay yeah here we go amen okay oh in Isaiah 42 and the 6th chapter and the 6 verse 42 I the Lord I've called thee in righteousness and will hold th hand and will keep thee for a covenant of the people for a light to the Gentiles then when we go over to Romans 11 oh I got to find the name I need to we need to um we we we we got to get brother Brooks uh uh one of those lapel mics you can't hold them I and turn the page at the same time so somebody going to bless him with that amen oh do you love him look what it says here in Romans the the 11th chapter no and the 13th verse I speak to you Gentiles in so much as I am the Apostles of the Gentiles I magnify my office Paul was saying that he was the manifestation of the word of God made flesh in his day that was the Ephesians oh Hallelujah see there's one thing to be born of a virgin it's like seem like all things are possible if you come that way but you and I didn't come that way but when God can take someone the same way we came and made that person the Manifest of the word of God when the manifestation of the word of God come and speak the word to you is hearing that manifestation that gives you [Applause] Faith Hallelujah I need a I need a second amen amen in Paul before I get so now now that the true five full ministry is on the Earth but they have to wait until the Apostle the person that's in that office of an [Music] apostle okay come on the scene and begin to show them how the word can be made manifest in your [Music] flesh before you got here God had to place his word in you as your soul the mystery of God is veil in you but but is buried in your subconscious so you're not conscious oh what buried in you so God made it possible so what did he do he appointed a time for you to have a supernatural experience he said repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remissions of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost is unto you is to your children even them that are far off as many as the Lord that God shall [Music] go many have been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but they never seek to be baptized with the Holy Ghost you have to make the baptism of the Holy Ghost a priority in your life amen there's no safety being in the message I'm in I'm in the message and I know more than the Baptist the method and the pilgrim Holiness oh Hallelujah that God has a what call a provided way you have to seek for the baptism of the Holy Ghost Jesus said If any man that love me and have my Commandments and do them he will be loved of my father and we will come and manifest ourselves to him and take up our boat AB means resence you are the residence of God Amen come on Amen Hallelujah yes Lord if only I can get you to understand amen amen how important you are Amen to God if I can only get you to understand that you're so important to God that he went on the cross to release the spirit that was in him come back upon you Lord oh my Hallelujah Lord let's just make a presbyterian shout the Holy Ghost comes to you you don't want the Holy Ghost upon your flesh you don't want the Holy Ghost upon your spirit you want the holy ghost in your soul when the Holy Ghost hallu yes Lord yes Lord when when it makes contact with your with your soul a quickening spirit and quickens alive that which was dorant in you because it becomes alive it causes it to migrate from your subconscious to the consciousness of your mind that is the mind of Christ to know what to do with the word Jesus said the son can't do nothing of himself but whatsoever he see the father do it do it the S likewise when the mind of Christ is activated in you you would know what the father wants done I was saying to I was saying was fellowshipping with I was fellowshipping with brother books today I say how did Paul knew that he not only fought a good fight but he [Music] knew that his work was finished how do you know that what you how do you know that the work was finished Paul knew that he did everything that he could and he had the resolve the that what he did completes his mission from God he has confidence to know that he would go before God knowing that he has accomplished what his life the purpose for his life what God wants done he knew that he did it Hallelujah he knew when his work started and he knew when his book was finished we have to come to that place when we know it is finished we have to understand that we're not here by happen stance we're not here we are not a mistake I don't care how you came here the fact is that you here and there's something that God wants you to do otherwise you would not have had life there were almost a million other Hallelujah that could have taken your place but heed [Applause] you amen hallelujah yes Lord amen amen oh Hallelujah Glory thank you Jesus oh my praise God do you love him am that amen when you know that when you know that God has given you a work to do and you know exactly what it is that God wants you to [Music] do it makes all the difference in the world [Music] it doesn't matter what the critics say about you you know what you do please father oh one of the things that Enoch testimony was he pleased God if we can have the same testimony that what we do please our heavenly father it means that we are walking with [Music] God amen and because you walk with God he cannot leave you here on this earth oh Hallelujah hallu you have to understand your restoration to the word is the Redemption of Adam [Applause] let that marinade forlu you mean to say all that Adam had is not going to be restored to you this is the time of the restoration Hallelujah we got to go back to the word back to the Bible Back to Eden where is that Eden is a place where the word is made made flesh when we go back toen is because God's word and US becomes one that will be the day that we know that the father was in Jesus Jesus was in the father Jesus in you and you in him you have to understand I'm not saying there is no quot me I'm not saying there is a trinity if there is one you part [Applause] [Music] of oh my I want to I don't want to hold it too long but I want you to I want you to know I want to prove to you it's all right amen amen it's a little it's a little private joke that taking place with my family and brother Brooks amen Brooks this evening amen but God is love is amen I want here's what I want to share with you that you were with God before the foundation of the world cuz if you were with God before the foundation of the world there has to be a record of [Music] you now I told you when I began that I want to talk about you I want to be so bold to introduce you to yourself Proverbs 8 starting from 22nd verse it says the Lord possessed me in the beginning of way before his works of old that means when he said let there be light I was I already existed before he spoke the before spoke the I was set up from Everlasting from the beginning orever the Earth was I normally would ask you to read it cuz I want you to hear it from your lips cuz if you hear it and you said it you cannot deny it so let's read amen amen you got your Bibles with you I want you to find it because this is the time that you will be able to prove that you always did exist what I'm saying is if you were with God before his works of old you were holy I said you will holy so I want you to read go back and let's read again the 22nd verse chapter I want not read silently I want you to read aloud I need you to hear the words that's coming out of your mouth so let me hear it you're not saying it with confidence you almost embarrassed to say that God possess you stand up stand up maybe you too I understand yeah let's come on let's read amen amen the Lord possess me go ahead the Lord possess me in the beginning of his way before his works of old I was set up from Everlasting from the beginning orever the Earth was when there was no death I was for when there were no fountains bounding with water before the mountains were settled before the hills was I brought forth while go ahead Earth You mean before he made the Earth go ahead the highest part of the Dust of the world go ahead when he prepared the heavens I was there amen when he set a upon the face of death when he established the clouds above when he strengthened The Fountains of the deep when he gave to the Sea his decree that the waters should not pass his commandment when he appointed the foundations of the earth you I was by him as one brought up with him and I was daily his Delight rejoicing always before him did you see that did you see that you were there when he prepared the heavens you were his Witnesses you witness the creation of the heaven Earth and all that there so you see why he can ask you let us make [Applause] man oh my glory god is not asking you to do anything that you have never done do you know why you were his Delight daily his Delight God was delighted in you and he wants to be delighted in you now amen because God Pastor J as a fountain of thoughts he those thoughts that he had you expressed it when he said let
