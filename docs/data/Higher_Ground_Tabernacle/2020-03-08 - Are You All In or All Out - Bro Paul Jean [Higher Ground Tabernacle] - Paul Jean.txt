we have had good fellowship with him we know that by God's grace the Lord is soon to come how many all know that we have heard that so often but now we see prophecies being fulfilled we see the germ warfare and all of the things that are taking place you see nations against nations we see Kingdom against Kingdom we see families against families there's war and confusion everywhere and the Bible is right even though there been scholars people who have great education studied it with their DVDs and the LD DS yet they're teaching the people how to live in this world they're failing to teach them how to prepare for the world to come and just like you were somewhere before you got here there's another place there's another place you must journey to death is the only way out but to the believer death is just saw a horse and buggy that carries you to the next world which is the world that Jesus Christ promised us that we would go and I'm so grateful to know the Lord without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin there is only one Lord and saved and that's Jesus Christ your church can't save you your system can't save you your religion can't save you there's only one salvation and that salvation comes in the name of the Lord Jesus amen we're just gonna sing a quick love song and you have our brother come I want him to have Liberty in the blood of Christ my

behoove us to give you all the praise and glory in Jesus mighty wonderful name we pray amen [Music] thank you musicians may God bless you my name once again for the Paula Jean I'm from all the way from Boynton Beach Florida I come from a Haitian cultural church my father's the pastor and the whole church were sending their greetings once again I am 29 years old but I always think that I'm young and in the name of Jesus but I'm happy to be here um I do want to say that um I've heard but the Brooks Minister a couple of times and you know how I've seen them and no different convention and meetings but the person who he truly is he's a real Christian and you don't find people like that these days and we want to thank him and his wife in the church and the different churches to coming together may God bless you you and your family your wife and your church I came you know to be a blessing but it seems like what I'm giving I'm getting twice as much as receiving just from him so it's truly a blessing um if you have your scriptures which the Bible we're going to go to a couple of scriptures and first I want to go to the book of Deuteronomy chapter third 30 verse 15 to 19 Deuteronomy chapter 30 15 through 19 and the scripture reads of verse 9 from verse 15 it says see I have set before thee this day life and good and death and evil in that I come and heed this day to love the Lord thy God to walk in his ways to keep his Commandments and his statutes and his judgments that thou may us live and multiply and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it but if dying heart turn away so that thou will not hear but shall be drawn away and worship other gods and serve them I denounced unto you this day that ye shall surely perish and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land whither thou passes over the Jordan to go possess it I call heaven and earth to record this day against you that I have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that both died in thy seed may live our next scripture that we have is Matthew chapter 6 verse 24 Matthew chapter 6 verse 24 the Bible reads it says no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve God in man man he may have their seats may God bless the reading of this word I've been preaching for about several years I've been you know I started out kind of young preaching about wrong I want to say 21 22 and I usually don't get nervous I usually don't get nervous but we just trust God will have this way yesterday I was speaking to the young people and it's been an inspiration upon my heart that um that we need some real Christians to stand up into this day so my topic this morning my title the theme is are you all in are you all out are you all in are you all out um because I realized and everything that you do in life you got to be committed to do it you got to give your effort you got to be inspired you have the ambition to really serve God or whatever that you're doing you got to be the best at what you're doing if you're going to be the basketball player you want to be the best basketball player if you're going to college or you're going to school you want to be the best student so whatever that you're doing you got to be the best but to to be the best you got to put tons of effort and practice and hard work to be successful and when I look at certain athletes movie starting certain people I realized that whatever that they're doing they're fully committed in doing it when I look at just you know the celebrities of today would it be Nicki Minaj cardi B jay-z who Kanye West whoever Kim Kardashian or whatever that they're doing they give their best but I was like what about the people of God what about us as Christians how is it that we don't give our best to God because God gives us his best so that got me to thinking that for you to be the best first they got to be a decision got to be made to start off the Prophet said here in the time of decision paragraph 10 he says you know we've been forced to make decisions there is times when we have to come to a place where we got to say yes or no that's just human life there's a time where we cannot stand neutral and if God shopper me I don't believe that we'll be able to leave this church tonight or this morning in the same conditions that we did we came into if the Holy Spirit shall come and do his work among us then we are forced to say yes or no we cannot remain the same so to start off to begin with I want to establish a fundamental principle the first principle that God gave man was a choice every man that is born has a choice you have a choice to do good you got a choice to do evil but you got a choice and every choice has rewards and consequences but you have to make your own choice your own decision nobody can't force you he did you notice that in the Bible in Genesis chapter 3 but what started from chapter 2 that God told Adam that you can't eat from any tree any tree but he said this one tree don't eat of it well God simply cut a totem I command you and God could have forced them to not do it but he said you have a choice so when God made man he gave every man every color every race a choice that is the first fundamental principle about God he he gave man a choice I mean God doesn't force you to do anything you got the truth what do you want to serve God or not what do you want to do right or wrong it's a choice what I realized sometimes as human beings sometimes we don't like making choices choices some sources are hard to make sometimes you have to make a choice whether you're gonna leave a city to go to a different city or sometimes you have to decide already gonna leave this family and go to that family or or this job or that job or that school some choices are difficult to make the Prophet said here in 1955 Redeemer Redemption he said that's where every man has to come to point in life sometimes they have to make a decision he said you have to make a choice you had to make a choice whether you was going to have an education or not you had to make a choice who was going to be your wife there has to be decisions and choices made in life and this may be the night that you have your final call to make your choice whom you're going to serve maybe your final time laying here dad on the stretcher or your mother over there young lady it may be your final time to make a choice so everything that we do starts from choices making a choice the second principle that I have is when choices are made then commitment is essential so when you make a choice any choice in life whatever that you're doing that if you're going to school whatever that when you make a choice the commitment is essential Church i I never seen where as people want to be the best but they don't do nothing or put any effort and becoming the best I never heard somebody who was ugly beautiful I never somebody who was the evilly good he was wickedly smart it's either you're wicked or you're smart it's either you're good or you're not either you do right or you do wrong but everywhere every person has a choice principle number two you've got to make a choice when you make that choice your commitment is essential Church one of my favorite athletes was Kobe Bryant now I never liked the Lakers because I'm a Miami Heat fan from Florida but I just I when I watch Kobe Bryant there there was something about me he he had a pursuit of excellence and I'm like this man is playing a game he's just playing basketball but he was so committed and being the best basketball player because he believed that God ordained him to play basketball he believed that whatever that he did he had to perfect it and I'm like this is the mother who's playing basketball but what about us Christians today what about believers even when I'm going to school I realize sometimes I'm not the best but I have a in ambition or an inspiration to be the best what I realized watching through these different athletes and you know a lot of people like Michael Jordan and the reason that people want to be like Jordan because he was great because anybody he played against he beat them he was successful and we as human beings we love a story when we are successful when we are overcoming well we won't want me to one of us as on top and when I look at these people sometimes I get inspired I'm like these people are just playing a sport and in every sport there's a reward so that got me to thinking if man has a reward for a sport what about a reward for life God is the only person that I that I said it one time I mature I said God is the only person I can pay you per second once you make a choice to serve God he will pay you more than what you can ever expect he's the only person that will pay you overtime as long as you work a hundred percent you don't have to put in the twenty five year retirement as long as you serve god your retirement is forever but first you got to make a choice first you got to be committed you got to give your all your effort you got to put everything that you can and being the best person that God wants you to be so when I look at these people I'm inspired I'm like these people they they sometimes I even heard Kobe Bryant after a game that he lost he went back to the gym to go practice well how many times as a Christian we go in practice sometimes we don't like reading the word sometimes we're like reading the Bible we don't like praying you know we don't like making sacrifices for a god but yet we want God to give us this best but you know there's a even God has in him the supply and demand if you demand something you got to supply it with something first that means if you want to be the best student you gotta do homework you got to do extra time of studying you know you got a sometimes you got a skip certain meals just to prepare for this exam if we can do that naturally speaking if we can do that naturally in in our basic life what about in God what about being the best Christian that there is and it's not saying that you're gonna do it but God going to help you to do so my question is very simple as I told the young people last night whose team are you on and whose side are you on because sometimes in life we get stuck between whether we really want to serve God or we don't but I'm here to tell you you got to make a real choice you got to make a real stand you can't be in between you can't be neutral you can't be maybe there's no baby there's no neutral than God either you with God or you're not either you're gonna stay with the word or you're not either you are truly gonna serve Christ or you're not gonna serve Him but she got to make a choice I can't fortunately I made my choice and I'm glad that I made it but you got to be certain you got to be you got to be positive that you're making a choice and you're making the right choice but when you make your choice you got to give everything that you got into it when I look at these people they're giving everything that they got into it so if I'm going to serve Christ you best believe that I'm gonna give everything that I got into it I may not be the best singer but I'm gonna sing I'm gonna be that best musicians but I'm gonna play music oh I'm gonna do whatever I can to make sure that I'm serving him Church it like I told my turn back home I said you know what lazy workers don't get paid I said if you want to get paid for something you got to put in some work just like any job if you want something you got to put in some work you got to follow the rules but just like God if you want to be a Christian if you want if you want to see the promises of God in your life you got to put in some work if you want God to bless you with a million dollar house where you got to have enough faith to get a million dollar house if you want God they give you something you got to put everything that you got into it but first you've got to be and sometimes we struggle for commitment sometimes we tell God that you know God we're gonna serve you Lord if you do it is you know we're gonna do this for you we're gonna sing we're gonna we're gonna do whatever and then when God does it we don't hold up the end of our bargain but that's understandable because as human beings you know we have errors we make mistakes you know we're not perfect and God knows that we're not perfect but if we believe in him he will make us perfect but sometimes we struggle with these kind of things in our lives sometimes we start out really serving God and sometimes we know God when God is speaking to us even when we're not our church we know God is calling us to do something but instead of doing that we get relaxed we tend to do something else we try to keep our minds occupied because we don't want God to keep speaking to us Church there was a point of time where the children of Israel had to make a choice even when God saved them they still went back into Egypt and started doing foolish - sometimes God deliver us many years ago but later on we started doing things that we know God called us not to do sometimes we go places and do things that God knows that we're not supposed to do it and we do it anyways but you know what I love about God he's always gracious and merciful even when I'm wrong he will still help me to do right even when I'm not living the right way God will always help you to live the right way but you got to have the right heart you got to make a real choice decision a decision or choice got to be made so we need people to make a decision it is your decision nobody else can take it away from it but you got to make it you got to pick a side you got to pick a team and then let me tell you Christ is the best team because he is the winning team there is no other winner besides Christ because he's the only person that if I die he can guarantee that I'll raise up he's the only person that can guarantee that she might not even taste death there is no other religion there is no other power that is greater than God God is the only person that I can't change a sinner into a saint he can only he's the only person I can make you stop lying make you stop stealing make us stop lusting make us stop drinking stop smoking only only the power of God can do that but sometimes when God is wants to do something we refuse to do something else because our mind is not certain we're not committed isn't that crazy that God delivered the children of Israel through a river the children of Israel seen the Egyptians fall into the river sometimes in your life you know God's really safe there are sometimes you're in their car and you see a car accident that you know it only could be God to save your life you look at certain things and you realize he said thank you Jesus but I know that was you Lord I don't know that was you God I know that was you and instead of being committed and serving God we go right back doing the same thing foolishness all over again sometimes God delivered us from some for certain things and we go right back the next day and doing the same thing that he just delivered us from trust me I know I know what I'm talking about I've been there I know the struggle I know the conflict I was there but I had to make a decision and when he make a decision I like to say that you got to have some guts back home down south and in South Florida or in the south we get it we say that you got to have some balls that means you got to be firm I mean that means you got to be so inspired that whatever that you believe that you stay to it if I'm going to be a Christian I don't care what people say I'm gonna be a real Christian I'm gonna stand strong I don't care what the devil tells me he could say that I'm alive like yeah I was but Christ saved me anyways Church I work in the jail I seen people kill other people I don't see the criminals I don't see the most evilest of people on earth but you know when I go to work I always say God make sure that my life is reflecting you because I'm committed to excellence not in man not in a mate belief but I really want to see God and everything that I do and I try to be a honest person I try to be real I tell some of the inmates I like you know what I make mistakes I said I can easily go out and do the same thing that you did we can easily go out and kill people we can smoke we can drink but I said it's only the grace of God that keeps me but I said in my heart I want to make a real choice to never hurt my god Church it's not easy when you look once when you when you know that somebody is a murderer a killer and you still got to be kind of respectful let me tell you if you don't have a real God in you you're gonna have hatred to certain people but when I go to work I know God changed my life because I can treat everybody the same and then we even tell you that I told him when I go to work I said I treat everybody I don't have problems they're like what you don't have problem I know people who are twice my age twice my size I'm only 5 foot 4 maybe 145 pounds but I got us some time I got a command people who are 6 5 6 7 300-plus pounds 50 60 70 years and I got to be their boss you see when you are firm when you are committed by something you are the boss and as believes that a Christian sometimes I felt like we allowed the devil too much opportunity I don't want to get a devil for any opportunity so I stayed firm I I make sure that that wherever I'm going that I said you know what if this if there's not a God in the area let the God in my life be the one but I'm telling you got to be committed because I'm telling you when you see purple on the news when you see serial killers and there you don't want that got to be exporting them but they don't kill 710 people chuckle did he kill him in a spot but I'm fearless every minute sometimes I get scared Oh sometimes trust me sometimes I am scared but there's something in me that's stronger than being scared there's something in me that that that is that is just not powerful is just not boastful it's not big but it is certain I know that I'm a child of God I don't gotta guess I don't got to be maybe I know I'm a child of God and I know if God put me somewhere he put me there for our purpose and I stick to it I stand my ground I don't I don't allow people to lead me other places that it's not Christian like I said if Christ if Christ can't go then I definitely cannot go if Christ can't do what we do then I'm definitely then I ain't doing what you're doing because I'm committed I made a commitment I had to put some confidence some good I had to make sure that if I'm gonna serve Christ serve him completely don't be no 5050 maybe one day you're in church wind a yacht one day you're praying the next day you're not praying one day you believe God and next thing you don't believe God know you gotta make a choice you got to pick a side you got to pick a team either you're really gonna serve God or you're not sometimes us older people sometimes we we think that just because we're a Christian and after many years we are right I you know what I hate being average I hate being all right I don't want to become normal I don't want to be just a regular person doesn't mean that I'm trying to boast and show myself but I know God called me to be something greater I'm so inspired that I when I go places I don't want people to fall down and worship the goddess in my heart could I know he's a true Living God I know God saved me listen I grew up in the church miss my dad was a pastor and I was still living wrong even though he did right I was still living wrong I was still living my life I was doing whatever I wanted to do but when I made a choice to really serve God listen there are some things that you try to do and you want to do but you can't do it sometimes I understand that sometimes people really want to be saved people really want to be changed people really want to excel in God but it's sometimes it's like something that's holding them back and sometimes the devil will put us in our slavery mental slavery spiritual slavery that you can't be the great person that God called you to be because they've done this because they've done that as I turn my church I said wasn't Abraham a man of faith wasn't Abraham called a man of faith right he's okay he's he's associative around the whole road as the father of faith right but he's the father favorite didn't Abraham tell a lie so how can a person who told a lie still be the father of faith only with God only God can make you perfect with every mistake and flaw in your life he's the only person that anything that you've done even her honor he has enough power to change you from evil to good and he does it for free but first abraham was committed he believed God that he was I believe also called a friend of God think about that he believed God so much that even God had to call him like God you know what a friend you know certainly a friend that you have to trust to have friends and if God can trust a liar think about it God trust a liar to be the father of faith what about us today we know different that's why I don't have to walk around with my head down and and finish sad if God could do that for Abraham and he still got today he still can do it for me what about David Davis one of my favorite characters you know about David David was a king Psalm is a worshiper but David was also disobedient he also killed another man's wife and yet God said in the book of Acts he said David is a man after my own heart how do you call a killer a man after my own heart but because david has something in his life that even he know when he was wrong he still can say Lord I'm wrong I'm sincere Lord I ain't live in the right way but only you can change me to make me live right in my life there's some things that I do I'd be like Lord how how do you still in love there's certain things that we do in our lives that we start the questioning God sometimes sometimes we we start drinking and smoking and doing all kind of you know simple other people wise and different stuff like that and and we just think about it like God how how is it that you still love me not even that call do you call us your children sometimes the devil will come and we'll plant certain things in your minds that if you come to church they go and talk evil about you they're gonna say that you're a hypocrite and you say that that's really anywhere I go I say hypocrites are everywhere they're in church and out of church sometimes we ourselves are the biggest hypocrites because we say things that we know but that we sometimes we even don't even do but I was like you know what God is another person that can change a hypocrite to a saint God isn't one person that can make a liar to be honest only God but first you gotta make a choice in your heart listen I understand that some of us we might have different kind of problems some spiritual some mental some physical but you got to make your own choice you got to make your own stand you got to be committed to whatever side that you're gonna pick on whatever that it is I'm not I'm not here to abash you or to a discouraged I'm here to encourage you because listen I don't made some bad mistakes I'm sure brother Brooks don't make some bad mistakes but we still believe we still have an inspiration that we are born to be great I know that I'm called to be great in God every child of call every child of God is called to be great but the only way that you can be great is if you have a real God in your life and they have a real God in your life you got to have the holy spirit that's the only thing that will make you great the Prophet said here in God's preparation 1954 he says stay right where you're at till God says it don't shake at everyone see stay right there you know that even if you're a little out of the way if you're really in your heart be sincere and stand firm in on what you believe God will respect even God got to respect your own choice that's why he said whatever you say to your mountain not what God says but whatever you say to your own whatever that you believe in your heart if you really believe it God would give it to you but sometimes we we say certain we sometimes we say things and right when we say it we don't know don't believe what even when we say I believe I heard a story that says that a lady had a mountain ice out of her window and she said Mountain be removed that maybe look out the window she said hmm just as I'd expected you're still here and sometimes we do that sometimes we say god I'm gonna do something devil get out my way and when we look you say hmm you know whatever just as expected you're still here sometimes there's certain things in our life that we know that I would to be overcoming and we don't and we say just as expected you're still here sickness you're still here I thought I cast you out but you know what as expected you're still here but when you believe something when you're inspired you believe that impossible can be possible there's not a person in this water that that does not like a comeback story we like being the underdogs we like when things are kind of low when we're against all odds and we're able to be successfully able to succeed well I don't know about your life but maybe you may be against all odds maybe maybe the underdog maybe you you you may be at the point of your life where you do not know what to do but let me tell me help you out here make a choice to serve God he's the only person that he can stand for you when everyone else will fail you he's the only person when that when the devil comes to accuse you of every sin that he can stand and say that this person never sinned in the first place but first you got to make first you got to make a choice to pick him as your lawyer as your advocate your attorney because every man has a choice to decide who would offend you who would not and let me tell you we're getting to a point in in a day in this life that the way that we live this world will be judged when you want to hear it or not this world would be judged every man will have to face God some day a lot about you but that scares me that every man will have to face God but the reason that I'm no longer scared because I've made a choice to serve God in the first place so if I stand for Christ he Christ got no choice but to stand for me if you choose Christ Christ has no choice but to stand for you but first you've got to stand for him and when you stand you got to stand strong many of us we hate weak people weak-minded people anything I was a week in the next one that's that looks solved we don't like it that's almost like a human nature we don't we don't like seeing things that are weak but let me tell you what out Christ you will be weak without the Holy Spirit you will be weak but even in our weakness God is still strong even in our flaws God is still strong but first you got to be like every man every man has a choice to make trust me when the devil comes on a day of judgment the devil and his demons will have every foul every recording every word every action of what you the way that she lived like that is wrong before God everything evil and died bad as she did in your life the devil will put it before God and even your own life can either was set you free or what not set you free well prove that you serve God or you did it the devil may have his Case Files he may have his witnesses he may have evidence but if you have the right attorney if you have the right lawyer if you have the right advocate things can change when your case may look impossible it can definitely be possible Christ is the only person that can look the devil in the eye and said that person never sinned in the first place Christ is the only person that can make every evidence of evil in your life disappear but first you got to make sure that Christ is your advocate you got to make sure he's a lawyer you gotta make sure that he's the person that you can only count on because man can't save you we're living in the day where everybody's scared of something but the biggest thing to be scared about is death but if you have Christ you won't be scared you can look death in the eye and say that you can't even touch me until God says so see when you have faith when you have confidence you're bold you're fearless you're confident you can't walk with your head up not because it's you but because there's a God in you but she got to make a choice you got to make a decision if you want to be the best you got to put in effort to be the best I think I encouraged my church I said if you want to be the best husband put in a word to be the best husband if you want to be to come to the best man be the best man that God had called you to be and not what you think you want to be if you want to be the best Christian make sure that you do everything that you can to be the best Christian don't settle for second place there's no first second second first either your first or your in second either you're the best or you're not anything that you do in your life be successful be great but most importantly when you're serving God be the best that you can be in God come to every service if you can pray whenever you can fast read your Bible sing songs testify witness make sure that when people look at your life that they can only see Christ but it starts with making a decision and this morning a decision lays before you either you're gonna be all into God or not as the Prophet said here in one of these messages I think total deliverance paragraph 49 he said if you are a Christian God don't make halfway Christians God makes complete Christians God don't make half way preachers but their preacher can be half way and God makes his children Christians but sometimes they're half way Christian but it's not God's intention for them to be that way think about it it's not God's intention for you to be average god don't want them to be halfway Christians or halfway preachers compromising on either side he wants them to completely stand in the briefs what is he trying to say he's trying to say that if whatever that you're doing be the best he even got to the point when he said if you're gonna be the thief be the best thief Wow he said God will respect that anyways God doesn't like hypocrites that's one thing that God hates he's a hypocrite somebody who's pretending and they're not well I don't want to be a pretender I don't want to be a maybe Christian or maybe so I think so he could be she could be now I'm gonna be the real thing whenever you have the real thing you know you're certain that is real but when he got the generic brand sometimes it don't gave you the full effect of the real brand well if you want to be a real Christian it takes a spirit of God in your heart in your soul to make you a real Christian and that's what God calls man to be just like him with an own way to be like him to be like rice no know what to be like questions to have his Spirit of Christ in your life because Christ will make you just like Christ as I'm getting ready to close in a few minutes think about this right a kitten is what think about this kitten is what a cat writing small version of a cat right what about a puppy puppies a dog right so if nature can testify of the word of God right so the children of God can only be would the children of God can only be what y'all sure y'all sure is that the word is that true so if you're a child of God that means you're what hmm not me but your own mouth you testify that's true of what you see of what you hear what you understand think about that's that's just simple so when the devil tells you otherwise why would he listen to him in the first place the devil wasn't created to be God so I'm gonna listen listen listen smarter who's not God I can only be what God wants me to be and I thought that's my child of God if I'm truly a child of God I can only be one thing but eight just like God but first you got to make a choice you got to be committed then when you committed you got to be all in you got to give everything that you got you got to be as a herd in the south you got to be a hundred percent you got to be 100 you got to make sure that if you're serving God serve remove everything that you got if you're going to be the best child be the best toy that you're going to be the best student be the best student the best worker be the best worker whatever actually doing be the best because God doesn't require anything less but being the best but first you got to have a drive you got to have a motivation you got to have the inspiration as the musicians come you got to make a choice as God said in his word you cannot serve two masters Matthew 6 verse 24 either you're gonna serve God or you're not gonna serve God either you're gonna go all the way or you're not going all the way but there's no in-between there's no maybe there's no halfway there's no neutral so this morning what I'm trying to say I'm trying to say that you got to be fully committed into whatever that you're doing if you're going to be a thief please be the best thing that you can be but if you're going to be a Christian be the best Christian that you can be because every choice has rewards and consequences is it easy being a Christian of course not matter of fact God even told us you're gonna suffer persecutions people mean I like you they might talk evil about you they might even try to kill you and hurt you but he said that you will be blessed in this earth in this world and in the world to come things that man can't even dream about that God has in store for you but first you got to be committed every young person you got to be committed God says in his Bible he says children obey your parents if you want to be the best child Oh BAE your parent if you want to be the best student we respect the teacher be the best student you can be but I go above and beyond it if you want to be a Christian beep be sincere and be the best Christian that you can be because God has a reward that no man can even think of or what he's gonna reward you with but you got to be committed you got to give it everything that she got you got to be motivated you got to be inspired you got to be even if you don't only person on earth you would still a servant love God come on pastor Brooks [Music] that is my inspiration if I'm the only person on earth I still be a witness for God I don't care how many Devils that is or that is in this world I don't care on people who don't believe in God if God needs a witness he is it is me and people want to see God it is me because I am called to be great I was called and chosen to be like rice that is the motivation that is the goal of Christianity to be like Christ but a be like Christ it takes a decision it takes a choice is there anyone here this one I must make a choice if you do want prayer you can come for a parade on man but when you make your choice be real in your life be running your heart so if God you know sometimes I sometimes you know I really want to serve you Lord sometimes I know that your calling Lord I know your voice but sometimes I get caught up in myself but if you want to overcome and say lord help me to make the right choice okay this morning I want to make a choice to serve you forever serve you with all my heart serve you 100% and I told you God is the only person I can pay you a hundred percent of your wages full compensation full retirement and some Lord but first you got to give your whole heart to Jesus they don't matter if you're five ten fifteen fifty or seventy we can always give more to Jesus and that is the goal give God your best I'm getting ready to close give God your best don't be satisfied of being average average things are never really the best when we go to try to get our cars we try to get the best car when we get suits and clothes try to get the best clothing the best shoes the best food and we can't do that for the natural what about a spiritual God so if you truly want to be the best come serve God make a choice make a stand stay committed to it and do it for your heart as we all stand is there anyone this one.i wants to give their life to Christ Jesus anybody wants to make a real choice to serve God could I tell you there is no sweeter man than Jesus there's no person who can bless you like Jesus there's nobody who can take your troubles away like Jesus and nobody can't reward you like Jesus but first you got to make a choice in your heart if you want to make that choice if you made it stay strong stay firm don't let any devil any person any place anything they're spirits you from keeping your choice is there anybody here this one I wants to give their life to Christ you can raise your hand if you want may God bless you stick to your choice it might be hard it might be difficult it might be some pain but just like every race there's a reward at the end but you got to keep running you got to be persistent you got to stay strong every head bowed every eyes closed Lord gracious Heavenly Father we have some souls for this morning made a choice this morning to serve and Lord we pray that every man will make a choice to serve but that is the best choice that we can make Oh God Lord Jesus as we made our choices this morning help us to complete our choices in you Lord there are pain there awaits us many problems many trials many bad situations for Lord we're going to stay committed to you because we know that you are the only one that can take us through you don't only what I can take us out of every trouble help us overcome every trial every situation so lord has these Souls this one am i giving their lives to you lord let you play you still their decision in heaven right now and let it be complete and made a holy spirit make them to be a successful and a blameless and imperfect Christian in your sight Lord Jesus we accident let your Holy Spirit sweep upon this room evenly oh god help me in my witnesses god help us in our issues help us in our problems help us to be real Christians Oh God and may we live in such a way that you can get all the glory all the praise heavenly Father God let your Holy Spirit touch every heart confirm every decision and help us to make it all the way to glory Heavenly Father God we pray in your precious mighty one [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] ah [Music] day [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] I love with God speaks to me I don't have to try to figure it out it is what it is I don't know whether the Lord spoke to your heart this morning but I know the brothers preached last night and I said to myself I want to be the best Christian ever you know I read about Paul and James and John and all the rest of them that was their day this is our day and we have to decide you know by God's grace I didn't tell the man what to preach God told him what to preach and I know it spoke to my heart because I don't know I was telling somebody the other day I said one thing I know about the law of God you read what you saw and even when you do something that you don't need to do there's an action if the science is for every action there's an opposite and equal reaction to just get the science update we have to pay back whatever we put out right love that and when you thought the thought about supply and demand one thing I love about God how many y'all have never seen a movie necklace a raging you ever see the movie you know what ain't you living in but we know that movies are something that is recorded in time in this night vision you you're recorded right and some of us we didn't live in a time of Marilyn Monroe but we can pull a movie up and gas pot Marilyn Monroe Liz still acting the same way she did right we hear her voice we see her face we know her smile we know where she looks like we know how she acts and it's August recorded that's man's doing now how can we explain when God says he sees the all he's the all-seeing eye he sees everything every move you make every breath you take is being recorded so you won't be able to say lord I didn't do that God hit the button flash is on the scene everybody in the judgment will see your life the only way to escape that is to be washed in the blood of the leg hallelujah the only way that all of your sins could be done away with is through Christ hallelujah is that right he just don't did leave it but he casted in the sea of forgetfulness the plan of Jesus Christ but justify you as though you've never seen in the first place what a mighty God we serve that's why I serve Him you know God just don't erase it you know a lot of times a rage you remember till the way we used to do tell so in paper I think this now everything is computer now so back in the day we used to have up you know you're right with your pencil and you know your bet you have to make sure you got a good eraser sometimes that eraser doesn't it won't get it you won't erase everything because it leaves an imprint but God doesn't do that God doesn't be racing like that he doesn't leave an imprint there so some evidence that you used to do those things whoa he takes every bit of it away there is no evidence you understand me it's when God saves you he takes away everything everything you've ever done wrong he takes it away he puts it in a seal forget it that's why God calls us perfect you can never be perfect on your own but God says because of the blood of Jesus crime he has justified you sanctify you feel you and the Holy Ghost and when you get the Holy Ghost you do extra yeah I'll be something called weird but that's okay I can't help but to be Who I am you love the Lord I really enjoyed the Word of God I appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ and all that he's doing you know brother lies as a preacher too but you know we get him another time Nords wheel and you know I just want to I want to say by God's grace thank you for just being here and pulling on the Word of God it really got comfortable in here but I think God because you here God sees you here even though you may not see God with your own eyes he see you he hears your thoughts he knows you he brought you here you said I made the decision but God gave you grace to make the decision and I thank God for that grace I remember the time I used to be afraid I was afraid to be a Christian because I thought I could never live it excuse me and what I do live [Music] see nobody knows where I come from I know God has changed me I could I could not have changed myself and he's still changing me that's why I'm excited about this gospel because people need to know they can be changed my mother was a Christian I thought I had to work on it you know to me I thought I had to you know it's like a boy followed in his daddy's footprints you know in that sense I thought I had to work I thought I had I thought I had to change me you chose [Music] there were things in my life I thought I couldn't overcome in my life they tormented me but when Jesus come Jesus can change you my mom lived that life and I didn't know about the Holy Ghost I didn't know about it like I said I'd see her get happy and do things that scared me you know because I didn't understand but I know I've seen people at ballgames and they get excited not people popcorn over jump and scream in your ear and your ear rings like oh my god is still there you know but they get caught up into that anointing and before you know it they in midair when they realize what they've done they just jumped the Holy Ghost is the same way but it's a greater joy we can't help it we can't help it it's like putting popcorn on fire I can't help but to pop that's how it is with the people of God don't be ashamed of your inheritance if the all the other churches grow dead and no excitement don't let your joy right it's not even if you lose your joy doesn't mean you'll not say you know is that right they said restore to me unto me the joy I don't know what what what being what you go be a Christian and you're not happy I got to go to church again that's what my neighbor said y'all going to church you going to church again I said yeah come on and go with me he never has to be another question I enjoy Jesus I enjoy being saved I live my best I try my best to live a clean life I enjoyed that do you have trouble sometimes yes right it's like if you like if you like like cheeseburger every now and again until God take that likeness out of you you gonna go get you a cheeseburger now I'm putting this simple y'all know what I'm saying God has to take the desire of seeing out of you that's what James said as long as that desires in you you still in trouble right man is tempted not by God but he's drawn away of his own lust and enticed and as long as that's in you you gonna have problems but guess what they're still a deliverer God is still a deliverer and you got that knowledge was in you as a god I can't do it but you can take this out of me you say will God do it if you know children and you are his children we used to have a little fella and imma let you go I know y'all ready to go but let me just say this we used to have Joseph he's he's grown and got married and even got a baby and all that but Joseph was a whiner and he would want something and mom and me would say no and Jose would go out that room the old Powell and everything and he'd come back and please please please believe he's gonna get your attention yeah you know one day I grabbed my wife I said you better go get him the pot was about ready to ball over so is with God be that person of importunity keep knocking hallelujah until your answer comes do you get what you need your children if a natural man is gonna sucks I get everything shot out what about our spiritual father you love the Lord it's your choosing you can be a happy Christian or you can be the sad is your choice you can be victorious or you can be a failure your choice you know you don't do the whole work you don't pass the test that's it you love the Lord can we just pray one
