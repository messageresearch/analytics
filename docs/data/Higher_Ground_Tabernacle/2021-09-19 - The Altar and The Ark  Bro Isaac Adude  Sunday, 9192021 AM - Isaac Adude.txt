asked this morning lord during the service of the service prayer father you take the first place reveal the word [Music] this morning i will lean a little bit more towards the teaching i mean because i'll read more i haven't talked about diversity so my time should be here so i've and i will commune with you from above from above the mercy from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony of all things which i will give the commandment unto first john [Music] my little children these things right unto you that you see not and if any man sin you have an absolute head with the father jesus christ the righteous amen and he is the prophetication for our sins and not for us only but also for the sins of the whole world remember but we pray your father god that you bring into reputation jesus christ amen um says that and there i will meet thee and there i will meet with thee and i will communicate from above to mercy [Music] from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony of all things which i will give me in commandment unto the children in other words eve didn't need any order to meet god you need any kind of you know material to be in contact with god foreign [Music] which means to be aligned with god kissing me and the dream and because the law required death and then then the altar was in the holy in the holy place amen because passing because when you go uh in the holies of holy only uh the the chief priests were allowed to go there now the other court represented justification before the minister and the altar represented the sacrifice place where the punishment was put or expelled [Music] [Music] because jeremiah 31 33 after those days [Music] [Music] [Music] jeremiah it will no longer write this word or it will it will no longer write its laws into you know stones but in that time the laws of god will be written in the hearts of people amen jeremiah will be placed in the heart of the people then said he lo i come to the lord i come to you thy will oh god he taketh away the the first that he may establish the second what we are sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once more [Music] and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away but this man talking about jesus after [Music] he has perfected forever them that are [Music] for after that he had said before and in their minds without right there and their sins and the iniquities will remain will not remember no more now where remission of this is amen he offered his sacrifice once for all for our sins and then he said that after that god will his rise or his soul in our hearts you know nobody will have to be a teacher of others because everybody will know the word [Music] we and then in the i want you know they can't deviate between the altar and the holiest and the holy spirit they can't deviate between the alternatives [Music] where the church are to be holy that's the reason we have our days that we have uh uh and the lack of faith um the monk before you know that that's the reason why we have the lack of faith see that something is the holy monk before when the is a scientific scientific proof that we are at the and here the church is still daily outside here it was uh light from the candlestick on the light from the kind of scene amen amen they had to depend on that lie amen if the light had oil was the voice based on the light from the candlesticks those people were depending on the sun amen you see those people remember when the sun goes now those people become cool jesus himself amen you know the sun has to shine for 12 hours and then you have 12 hours of nights in life in the manner that was coming that was falling in the outer court that was a manner that people were going to eat for one day man that was a man image that people were waiting amen the holy spirit can fall you know to the righteous and the unrighteous [Music] and doing is kept in our hearts [Music] he amen and the prophet he's just wonderful but you haven't consecrated your life we amen even my children [Music] remember when jesus died on the cross the bible says that you read in the bible amen by him by rendering the bear on the shoulder amen he put the ark and the alter in the same room it meant to make a complete worship where you have the sacrifice and then you have the words together jesus christ is we had to he went to that place because if we read in uh uh uh a second chronicles of the syllogism the second chronicles chapter 26 chapter 4 16 to 20. is because he wasn't a but when he was wrong his heart was lifted to his disruption because if you read that story became a king when he was himself himself it took the place of the chief priests bible says i continued but when he was wrong his heart was lifted up to his destruction for he transgressed against the lord and wanted the temple of the lord osia the king and said unto him uh uh he belongs not unto him to burn his incense onto the lord but to the priest but to the priest the sons of aaron that are consecrated to burn instances go out of the sanctuary for thou has transparency neither shall they feed or die from the lord in his hand to burn instances and while he was brought with the priest the leprosy even rolls up in his forehead before the priesthood in the house of the lord from society into his heart the chief priest and all the priests looked upon him and behold with leprosy is god will be heard from god uh uh elijah man amen first king 1845 um come on is and until whom the word of the lord about the altar as the great as great as uh as greatest would contain two measures came here and said lord god of abraham isaac and israel let it be known this day the hell our god in israel and that i am thy servant and that i have done all these things as and i have done all these things sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they say the lord is the lord is the god the lord amen amen and then after that you put [Music] [Music] yes [Music] amen because i understand [Music] [Music] amen which was the baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ amen people started to sprinkle people for the baptism amen but when he came he had to restore it to the immersion amen representing the death and the resurrection of jesus of jesus christ and then he had to restore the mystery of the father who the sonship and the holy ghost and amen it's not three separate beings or the father is not the the son and the son is not the holy ghost and then there is no three people there is no three people in god or three persons in god but it's the same god amen manifesting himself amen as the father they don't compare amen as the son cometh and that's the holy ghost in the name of jesus christ [Music] [Music] you know in order for god in order for god to start you know dealing with people again you know in order for god to to to uh to start having you know uh in order for that relationship that was lost it meant to be restored and in the same spirit as elijah amen and in his name was william branham and he had the same spirit as elijah remember he restored all those things we're meant to restore the communion that that was between god and a human amen amen why an altar amen in the human body don't tell me [Music] amen you place in every place in those kidneys amen and then the kidneys what they do amen they take all the toxic things out amen they help us to get rid of the toxins you know all the toxins that's in the body and then spiritually speaking amen the toxins are are are the scenes that we deal with you know that we deal with every day they come in us to destroy us amen that's the same thing that the toxins do they destroy their bodies amen and all the medicine that we that we take amen all of them all of those medicines have has toxins toxins amen yeah and it's the same thing when we leave you know when we live in the world and whenever we see different things amen those things no come and then they destroy our bodies and the kid is that god placed in us amen represent also the altar amen because when we have done all the evil things amen we can go to the altar amen and go confess our sin amen and then it'll take all the impurities away from us it'll purify our blood again [Music] you know they do the work to purify the blood they have to come by and they that the altar is not a place where we have to go and justify ourselves amen the altar is not the place where we have to go and prove how righteous we are the answer is not a place where we we can go and prove to god how good we have been um [Music] that was against the word themselves adam saying that it's the wife that you give i don't want to see that the wife accusing the serpent used to suffer they weren't justifying themselves even none of them would none of them admitted amen the sin that they had committed amen when we go to the altar amen we have to go with the spirit with the spirit of making so the one the you know truly i haven't been the the you know the the best christian as i was supposed it meant to tell him how you need him amen for your justification and for your baptism of the holy spirit and then in closing i'll read matthew chapter 11 verse 28 the third amen here is jesus [Music] and our heavy lady and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn and learn of me for i am meek and loathing heart and you shall find rice unto your soul foreign for a long time don't have to get used to but it's something that you have to lay in a cave that you've been carrying for a long time [Music] amen that scene that you keep that that is not confessed amen that's you that you keeping inside of you for a long time i mean it's affecting your work with christ amen he's the only one who can give us rest amen he's the only one who can take up a heavy heavy burden hey man he's the only one who can take out he can who can take our seats is an open invitation come on to me oh you that heavy lady i will give you rest he had to render the veil a man to place the ark and the archer in the same place the ark and the and the altar the same thing amen because in the ark you heard the word and the altar you have the sacrifice and you can go and worship him and and ask for forgiveness remember why are we still keeping if we're carrying those burdens why are we still keeping beating ourselves amen condemning ourselves for what we have done that was wrong remember that same just same uh uh a thought of sin that you have committed amen you can't get away from it and to take the conscience because he can't force you to do something it has to come from you and then you have to open up your heart and let him in you have to open up your heart and say lord amen that's the holy spirit it may come unto me felicia or you that are labor in heavy ladies and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you so you don't have to go see a catholic priest amen you don't have to go see somebody to go confess
