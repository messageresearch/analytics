[0:00] in the days of Noah we find out that God
[0:03] raised up a prophet by the name of Noah
[0:06] and that prophet began to preach he
[0:09] began to preach now he prepared listen
[0:12] we didn't know we thought oh the ark was
[0:14] built for everybody to go in there but
[0:17] if you read and I think it's a book of
[0:19] Jude it tells us that Noah built the ark
[0:22] for the saving of himself himself in his
[0:25] family so God only had a room of rooms
[0:28] that was going to actually take care of
[0:30] eight think about it and he looked
[0:35] pretty crazy right now I'm not come to
[0:38] preach on the Prophet but I wanted to
[0:40] say this that that is the way we know
[0:43] God is soon to come because God will
[0:46] always raise up one man that the world
[0:49] will hate he hate they hated Noah when
[0:52] Moses came they hated Moses when Jesus
[0:55] came to him with all these churches and
[0:57] you Jesus thank you only one right jesus
[1:00] said except you believe that I am he you
[1:02] should likewise die in your sins
[1:05] so God always have a warning before
[1:08] judgment right when Israel got so bad
[1:11] amen and they became so hard-hearted and
[1:14] stiff-necked God raised up Jeremiah God
[1:17] raised up Isaiah and what did they do
[1:20] they kill the prophets is that right oh
[1:23] yes they kill the prophet they soul dies
[1:26] then they they song Isaiah in half and
[1:30] Jesus even rebuked it he rebuked the
[1:33] Pharisees and the Sadducees well there
[1:34] they said don't even say Abraham is your
[1:37] father you're the guys that put him in
[1:39] the tomb say your mom and your daddy put
[1:43] them in the tomb and you going there to
[1:44] garnish it right so we understand that
[1:48] true preachers whether it be 20th
[1:51] century preachers or a whenever whenever
[1:54] God has an anointed man the world do not
[1:58] want to hear what needs to be said or
[2:01] what he's going to say so the appearance
[2:05] of a prophet is one of the ways we know
[2:07] because when Jesus came on the scene who
[2:10] showed up before John the Baptist
[2:13] and John was able to introduce Jesus to
[2:17] the church world but did they follow him
[2:20] no because they thought John was a crazy
[2:24] man right whenever you come to try to
[2:27] tell people about Jesus and tell him
[2:30] that he's not a system but he's a spirit
[2:33] and he's a free spirit you understand me
[2:37] and that he and God is one they say you
[2:40] are off your rocker now let's go on
[2:43] you're gonna have scoffers and you know
[2:47] in this day you know I remember the time
[2:50] when it all switched in my earlier days
[2:53] you know when you had Jim Baker and
[2:56] Tammy Bakker and all of the PTL people
[2:59] everybody loved them and Christianity in
[3:02] 1977 was flourishing healing this
[3:05] message was flourishing anointed
[3:07] anointing was falling people being
[3:09] baptized and the name of the Lord Jesus
[3:11] Holy Ghost filled people being filled in
[3:14] miracles in signs and wonders and here
[3:17] comes Jim and Tammy and they messed up
[3:19] and the whole world saw the Christian
[3:23] fall and it was at that time according
[3:27] to way I could remember people began to
[3:30] disrespect Christianity and saw it as a
[3:34] racket saw it as a way of making money
[3:37] yes they saw the spirit of Judas and
[3:43] here it is in the midst of all of that
[3:46] God was pulling a bride out of chaos
[3:52] because at that time for myself I could
[3:57] see the hypocrisy I can see the
[4:01] showmanship I can see the that the
[4:03] Hollywood nasaw of this Christianity had
[4:07] become Hollywood and and so I saw her
[4:11] that I was there I went to PTL and I saw
[4:14] the performance I saw how they acted and
[4:16] and this what they were doing they were
[4:17] acting for the camera and as soon as the
[4:20] camera was off of him they were laughing
[4:22] and playing and having making jokes and
[4:23] everything else as soon as the man said
[4:25] camera they got back on the stage and
[4:26] they act
[4:27] holy I saw it with my own eyes and I
[4:32] knew at that time in my life that's not
[4:35] what I wanted now buying you many people
[4:39] were healed in that ministry so you'll
[4:42] know that the gifts and calling of God
[4:44] is without repentance God calls you he
[4:48] gives you gifts but it doesn't mean
[4:50] you're saved right you can never be sure
[4:53] your salvation on the gift if that be
[4:57] the case I might get to heaven before
[4:59] some of y'all because they say I can
[5:00] sing but can i base my salvation upon my
[5:06] singing that's foolishness
[5:08] oh but my brother Samuel make it before
[5:11] I would because he can play the piano
[5:13] and I can't see it doesn't work like
[5:16] that I'm coming in just a moment but I
[5:18] want you to understand that everything
[5:20] looked chaotic it looks like it's off
[5:23] course but it's not everything that's
[5:27] happening right now is happening
[5:30] according to the plan of God is that
[5:34] right you had to realize that God has to
[5:37] shake the world just to get his own out
[5:39] of it
[5:40] is that right when God sent Israel a
[5:44] mentor to Jericho Jericho had to fall
[5:49] the great city of Jericho
[5:52] they had walls which areas raced upon
[5:55] them is that right and what did God
[5:58] shake Jericho down for a family that was
[6:04] led by a prostitute is that right a man
[6:12] it was Rahab who saw them though those
[6:15] are men coming it was Rahab who hid them
[6:19] in her house she literally lied for them
[6:22] and God still justified her Oh somebody
[6:27] help me here but you see God had to do
[6:30] that just to shake everything when God
[6:33] get ready for you guess what he does he
[6:36] shakes your world and you don't have to
[6:39] ask him to
[6:40] he's your God and he's going to do it
[6:43] anyhow hello
[6:46] you said well what do you mean brother
[6:47] Brooks I'm saying this even when it came
[6:49] to Peter James John all of them God went
[6:53] on their job and say follow me he went
[6:57] by the tax collector follow me and they
[6:59] had to quit they had to he shook their
[7:02] world
[7:02] guess what Paul thought he had it all
[7:05] together and God shook his world when it
[7:09] was time for Paul assault become Paul
[7:12] God intervened right so what I'm trying
[7:16] to say is that every one of us has an
[7:18] appointed time and when that upon a time
[7:21] is right
[7:23] God don't care about what you getting
[7:26] ready to do God is interested only in
[7:29] you and his purpose in which he made you
[7:33] must be fulfilled right so let me move
[7:38] back to this cheer a sign of the coming
[7:42] of the Lord because the Bible says
[7:44] according to Genesis that people
[7:48] multiplied multiplied look at this this
[7:51] whole world is multiplying in spite of
[7:54] all of the abortions it's still
[7:56] multiplying it's like in Egypt when they
[8:00] were trying to kill all the male babies
[8:02] they still was producing them nothing
[8:05] could stop it because God has seed and
[8:08] that seed must be made manifest and no
[8:11] no no birth control no no nothing will
[8:14] stop the seed of God from coming right
[8:21] apostasy when people don't know the
[8:24] difference between God and the devil
[8:26] they have gotten so blind they read the
[8:29] scriptures but yet is still they think
[8:31] it's okay in other words everybody is
[8:33] right in their own eyes
[8:35] you know guarding or God guarding or
[8:38] judge that they already that doesn't
[8:42] matter but God's Word matters everything
[8:45] matters right let me move on as I said
[8:50] this earlier sheis people right
[8:52] everybody got a right I got a
[8:54] to do what I want to do right and then
[8:58] you know the world has gotten rid of the
[9:00] Bible churches have gotten rid of the
[9:02] Bible you very seldom see people carry
[9:05] the Bible even the church but it is what
[9:09] it is it is the age of insanity
[9:14] everybody's insane couple of y'all know
[9:17] it's the truth now y'all know the truth
[9:19] and I ain't gonna hit too hard but
[9:21] sometimes you see these people dressed
[9:23] outside and you think to yourself oh
[9:25] they must have left their clothing at
[9:27] home y'all know it's too right I mean
[9:31] the little bit of things that they wear
[9:33] and they expect for a man not to look
[9:37] but it is a natural thing
[9:39] that's why sons of God must turn their
[9:43] heads is that right
[9:46] because the Bible says are calling the
[9:48] revelations third chapter they'll be
[9:50] naked and they don't even know it whew
[9:54] as I said is the age of perversion is
[9:58] the age of fake news is the age of
[10:00] deception hallelujah and the only thing
[10:04] that will span as truth is God's Word
[10:07] and that's the thing that everybody's
[10:09] saying is a lie ain't none to that Bible
[10:12] is old-fashioned we got to revive it oh
[10:15] we don't revive nothing it revives us
[10:17] yeah yeah oh but see it's the truth this
[10:22] is why what is it that Muslims Hindus
[10:27] whatever you name it can have their
[10:30] Bible books in a Christian store but we
[10:33] can't have ours but because they don't
[10:38] want truth what is it that everybody
[10:43] gotta have books explain in the Bible
[10:48] let not your heart be troubled you
[10:52] believe in God believe also in me in my
[10:57] father's house are many mansions if
[10:59] there was if it were not so I would have
[11:02] told you I go to prepare a place for you
[11:06] Oh what comforting words to know that we
[11:11] will not remain here now you got to
[11:16] understand this catching away on this
[11:18] rapture that we're talking about it is a
[11:20] snatching or catching away or however
[11:22] you want to put it it is God coming down
[11:25] and changing your body from moral tool
[11:28] immortality hallelujah and right now we
[11:34] are now in the process of God doing that
[11:37] that's why God has to show he had to sin
[11:41] a word so that we would know how to
[11:43] prepare ourselves right or they said oh
[11:46] we're going to be changed in a moment of
[11:48] twinkling and I that's right
[11:50] but it's because you have already come
[11:53] up to that point where you could be
[11:54] changed no sinners no no no no no the
[11:59] Bible says no unclean thing shall enter
[12:02] that City so therefore there must be a
[12:04] message there must be a word that God
[12:06] can give us to change us from unclean to
[12:09] clean I go to prepare a place for you
[12:14] that where I am there you may be also in
[12:18] my father's house in other words in my
[12:20] father's Kingdom
[12:21] I have many palaces that's the way it
[12:24] works because I want you to understand
[12:26] that the bride of Jesus Christ is
[12:29] outside of Jesus the celebrities of
[12:33] heaven hallelujah amen he's the number
[12:39] one but we fall it right there with him
[12:42] right but lost you got to understand the
[12:45] Bible said the whole heaven and earth is
[12:46] named after him is that right and the
[12:50] Bible said his new name you and I will
[12:54] be given think about it think about it
[12:59] how did God when God changed his name
[13:01] from Jehovah to Jesus and how that
[13:05] Israel called upon Jehovah Jehovah
[13:07] Jehovah and they didn't get nothing to
[13:11] this day they still are not getting it
[13:13] because the power is in the name of the
[13:16] Lord Jesus Christ
[13:18] neither's their salvation in
[13:21] but there's no other name given among
[13:23] men whereby we must be saved but by the
[13:26] name of Jesus Christ being a Buddha
[13:29] won't do it being a Muslim won't do it
[13:31] you know you know you know it doesn't
[13:33] matter
[13:35] Christian science those things don't
[13:38] work the Bible said just shall live by
[13:41] faith now let me go on because you and I
[13:44] must realize that God has given us
[13:48] something and you must come to
[13:50] understand when God quickened his Holy
[13:52] Spirit in you when that was quickened
[13:54] now that yearning is in you more God
[13:56] more God more God right no matter how
[13:59] many times you fall no matter how much
[14:00] you fail you still crying out more god
[14:03] more god hallelujah why he put that in
[14:09] you you didn't derive it you didn't come
[14:12] by it by your own self yourself he
[14:16] placed that in you before the foundation
[14:20] of the world God was the one who
[14:22] switched on the switch some of us was in
[14:28] a club
[14:29] some of us was on the street we didn't
[14:31] know who we were like Peter James and
[14:33] John and all of them they didn't know
[14:34] who they were but then Jesus met him and
[14:37] when Jesus called him with what he said
[14:39] I knew you and you were with me before
[14:42] the foundation of the world
[14:44] that's your Bible and in Peter James
[14:46] John and all the rest was with him
[14:48] before the foundation of the world so
[14:50] were you why because we were in him sin
[14:55] what did sin do sin made us forget who
[14:59] we were and who we are where we came
[15:02] from and where we're going that's why we
[15:05] needed Jesus we needed somebody amen is
[15:08] that right let's put it this way he came
[15:13] out of Adam it was Adam who told Eve who
[15:18] she was she didn't know it but it was
[15:23] Adam said listen you came for me and
[15:27] unless you're born of my bone and flesh
[15:30] of my flesh and I
[15:33] I was here before you came you were made
[15:37] out of me and Jesus did the same thing
[15:42] we came out of him and we made all for
[15:46] him is that right
[15:47] the Bible said according to revelation
[15:49] in 3rd chapter he is the beginning of
[15:51] God's creation Alleluia and the
[15:55] scripture calls us what his brethren I'm
[15:59] coming why he's all Lord I can't hardly
[16:04] wait to get home but how can you call
[16:07] heaven your home if you never been their
[16:08] home it's a place that you've been there
[16:11] before
[16:14] yes and you and I must understand heaven
[16:18] is our home because that's where we came
[16:20] from jesus said I came from God and I go
[16:24] back to God you see only those who came
[16:27] from God from the beginning goes back to
[16:31] God it's a roundup we call it a
[16:37] gathering when the Feast of the trumpets
[16:40] but what he goes trumpet what was it
[16:44] doing it was literally calling people to
[16:47] a gathering a feast and then and the
[16:51] wedding supper in the sky the marriage
[16:54] supper excuse me is a feast that Jesus
[16:58] had prepared for all the redeemed
[17:02] that's your rapture he's oh I'm going to
[17:07] escape well that's true it is us in
[17:10] escape but when you escape is not you
[17:15] escaping from danger because at that
[17:19] point in time you have come into his
[17:21] very image and his likeness
[17:22] there's nothing can harm you but the
[17:26] rapture the changing of the body is to
[17:29] produce you with the body that can
[17:31] literally go through the sky through the
[17:33] air through the dimension because as we
[17:36] are flesh and blood the Bible says no
[17:38] flesh and blood can enter no we can't go
[17:41] this way God has to change this body
[17:44] like his own body
[17:47] his resurrection body y'all hear me
[17:50] because that's what he did when Enoch
[17:53] was translated you think Enoch went up
[17:55] to heaven in a flesh and blood body he
[17:57] couldn't do it you can go by so much
[17:59] fought so far up then you'll die from
[18:01] suffocation your freeze to death so he
[18:04] had to change his suit right and we said
[18:09] well Oh what about what about Elijah
[18:11] Elijah went up in a chariot of fire
[18:13] whirlwind and all did to God God had to
[18:16] change him is that right oh yeah because
[18:20] remember when he stood there on Mount
[18:23] Transfiguration he stood there Jesus
[18:25] Moses and Elijah stood there but Moses
[18:28] was there they say but Moses may have
[18:31] died but he resurrected because even the
[18:35] devil looked for him and couldn't find
[18:37] him hallelujah that's the part I like
[18:39] one of these days they'll look for me
[18:41] and I'll be gone see and we know by
[18:45] God's grace the glory of the Lord was
[18:48] done about Transfiguration who stood
[18:51] there Jesus only and basically was
[18:55] saying I'm the reason for Moses Moses
[19:00] was a shout and a type of me
[19:01] I'm the reasons for Elijah Elijah was a
[19:06] shattering type of me you see but he is
[19:09] the real one the true God nor three
[19:12] Tabernacles let us be a one for Moses
[19:15] let us be a one for Elijah
[19:16] that was me a one for Jesus and then
[19:18] unknown Jesus only ma it is God alone
[19:24] right now let me hurry up I'm taking too
[19:27] much time you and I must understand when
[19:30] we talk about the translation or rapture
[19:33] it is a in a process add to your faith
[19:36] virtue virtue knowledge temperance
[19:38] patience godly brotherly kindness right
[19:41] on up into divine love if you go to
[19:44] Peter you'll find out that is what Peter
[19:46] called the divine nature of God each one
[19:49] of those virtues that I have listed on
[19:51] that wall calls for battle
[19:53] you're battling it you're battling it's
[19:57] like the children of Israel who God gave
[19:59] that
[20:01] the land of Canaan and they had to kill
[20:03] all the Giants and if you don't kill the
[20:06] giant it will what about said if you
[20:09] don't kill and if you don't kill all the
[20:12] inhabitants of the land scuse me not the
[20:13] giant if you don't kill all the
[20:15] inhabitants of the land guess what they
[20:17] will become a thorn to your wet flesh
[20:20] and these virtues
[20:23] if you don't obtain these virtues you
[20:25] said all brothers I can't do it you're
[20:28] right you want to sit right you cannot
[20:32] add one cubit to your statue but there
[20:35] is a seed gene that God placed in you
[20:38] and when the preaching at the preaching
[20:41] of the word that see seed gene was
[20:44] quickened that's why you love the word I
[20:45] love it I love it I love it
[20:47] I want more of it more of it it's like a
[20:49] baby when it's born and give me more
[20:51] give me more
[20:51] right and as that baby eats it grows
[20:57] that's how it is with the word you don't
[21:00] have to mince our fake it eat it and the
[21:03] most of us are stuck in our growth
[21:05] because we're not reading our word we're
[21:09] not selling shipping we're not in there
[21:11] amen we're we're just laying in the
[21:13] presence of the Sun for God to ripen you
[21:17] because most of us Christians are too
[21:19] green yet and harvest this you know the
[21:25] we just golden has laid in the Sun one
[21:29] thing I know about the harvest time you
[21:32] know when it's when it's Winnett that
[21:34] wheat is green it stands with pride but
[21:39] as that Sun began to bake it it begins
[21:42] to brown down in prayer it drops his
[21:46] head that's how you know you're maturing
[21:48] when you learn how to pray when you
[21:51] start praying and stop being this and
[21:55] come back to this is that right because
[21:59] you got to realize amen that's the way a
[22:01] baby is born a baby stands straight in
[22:03] his mother's womb but when it's time for
[22:06] it to be born
[22:07] it goes into a prayer position hmm and
[22:12] that's the way it is
[22:14] at the time of this rapture ya ain't
[22:18] gonna be partying you're gonna be in a
[22:21] prayer mode yes people don't understand
[22:28] how powerful prayer is but when the
[22:31] foolish version asked give us up your
[22:33] oil then why I said you go pray up
[22:37] prayer is essential to making a rapture
[22:41] if you are a true bride why because
[22:44] you're constantly asking God for
[22:45] forgiveness and you're asking God for
[22:48] virtue you're asking God constantly lord
[22:51] give me patience lord give me God in His
[22:54] Lord give me brotherly kindness
[22:56] I need that Lord I need that and then as
[22:58] you ask God gives he anoints that spirit
[23:03] He pours water on the seed and it begins
[23:07] to grow you can't do it
[23:10] but the seed in you that's why the
[23:12] problems I said you have in that seed
[23:15] the potential everything you need for
[23:17] the rapture and what is God coming back
[23:20] for character what character the
[23:25] character of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[23:28] it must be in you and me right
[23:32] all this integrate did you know that
[23:35] that God is the god of the dead and the
[23:38] living
[23:39] there's coming a change and you and I
[23:44] realized amen that this change y'all
[23:46] better enjoy Jesus you know I get I
[23:49] can't get over these Americans and how
[23:51] we carry on like we're gonna have
[23:53] freedom of religion all for until Jesus
[23:55] come our country's getting ready to flip
[23:59] you barely enjoy these things like let
[24:02] the Prophet God said it's gonna be a
[24:03] farm memory oh I remember when brother
[24:06] Brooks was dancing in the spirit know
[24:09] you better enjoy yourself now because it
[24:15] ain't gonna be so easy down the road
[24:17] Christians are becoming less popular all
[24:21] the time
[24:25] the world don't want you anymore you in
[24:28] their way you remind them of their
[24:31] conscience they know that consciousness
[24:36] tell them is wrong and as a Christian
[24:38] you spend there as a witness to what
[24:42] they say they says is right you know
[24:45] it's wrong see that I want that they
[24:48] don't know because if they get rid of
[24:49] the Bible they don't have nothing to do
[24:52] to judge them or condemn them or
[24:56] accountability is the word I'm looking
[24:58] for
[24:59] they don't have to have accountability
[25:01] that all right verily verily I say unto
[25:04] you the hour is coming and now is when
[25:06] the dead shall hear the voice of the Son
[25:08] of God and they that hear shall live for
[25:11] as as a father have life in himself so
[25:13] have you given it to the son to have
[25:15] life in him and have given him authority
[25:19] to execute judgment also because he is
[25:22] the son of man Marvel not at this for
[25:26] the hour is coming into which all that
[25:29] are in the grave share hear his voice
[25:31] and shall come forth they that have done
[25:35] good unto the resurrection of life and
[25:38] they that have done evil unto the
[25:40] resurrection of damnation two different
[25:43] calls the first resurrection are those
[25:46] who are saved and redeemed the second
[25:49] resurrection are those who come forth
[25:52] for the white throne judgment and
[25:55] included in that is the foolish virgins
[26:00] among the sinners and that's when God
[26:03] said he will separate the sheep from the
[26:05] goat hallelujah is this okay so you
[26:12] understand by God's grace amen that
[26:14] we're the original right the original is
[26:19] how can I say it must be proven you
[26:23] can't say all I am of the original no no
[26:26] no no no no it's like somebody you know
[26:29] how they doing blood tests now to see
[26:30] who's the father God has done a blood
[26:35] test he knows who the father is
[26:38] right so you must understand amen the
[26:41] blood test is what tells the doctor who
[26:45] you belong to
[26:48] that's why when you become a Christian
[26:50] and you become you get filled with the
[26:52] Holy Ghost amen what is it it is a blood
[26:55] transfusion
[26:57] that's right the Holy Ghost really is
[27:00] just the life that was in the blood of
[27:02] Jesus we don't work with the chemistry
[27:05] anymore it is the life that was in the
[27:08] blood of Jesus right because that's what
[27:11] the angel said to Mary Mary said the
[27:14] Holy Ghost is going to overshadow you
[27:17] right and you will have a son and called
[27:20] his name Jesus so if the Holy Ghost is
[27:24] Jesus father then who's the father it
[27:28] was the Holy Ghost that overshadowed
[27:31] Jesus so the Holy Ghost must be the
[27:34] father he is that's why people don't
[27:37] understand he meant that the Holy Ghost
[27:39] of God in Christ all it is is Lord
[27:42] Father Son Jesus Holy Ghost it is in the
[27:46] church today right three offices God as
[27:51] a father he created everything he came
[27:53] down as a son he's still the creator but
[27:56] he created himself a body and the Bible
[27:59] says in him dwelt the fullness of the
[28:00] Godhead bodily but the same Holy Ghost
[28:03] that created everything is in that body
[28:07] so what's the difference if ilyinka if I
[28:13] linked a coca-cola from a plate a
[28:14] drinking from a cup it still coca-cola
[28:19] it's just the containment is different
[28:22] right and the Holy Spirit is Elohim
[28:25] Himself the self existing wine but does
[28:31] it take Jesus from being a man he had to
[28:33] be a man because God made himself a man
[28:36] he's the only one that can change you
[28:40] hmm
[28:41] is this okay I said it let me hurry up
[28:47] we know that when the angel of the Lord
[28:50] when he said the Lord Himself said is
[28:51] sin from
[28:52] heaven with a shout with the voice of an
[28:53] archangel with the Trump of God and the
[28:55] dead in Christ shall rise first and then
[28:58] we understand that all of this is still
[29:00] in process the voice Amen is the shout
[29:04] is the message that voice of the
[29:05] Archangel when when God came down ain't
[29:08] mental Lazarus and and Jesus stood there
[29:10] and he said I'm doing this for you not
[29:12] me but when he cried aloud to us come
[29:16] forth is that right a ladder's awakened
[29:20] and he came forth when Jesus was on the
[29:24] cross and he's kind of Father forgive
[29:27] them for what forgive them because they
[29:31] know not what they do when he scream
[29:34] with that loud voice the Bible says and
[29:36] gave up the ghost said the earth shook
[29:40] hallelujah what was he doing he was
[29:44] getting the attention of the other
[29:46] regions the other dimensions heard that
[29:49] voice is that right those that were in
[29:52] the grave something took place it shook
[29:55] amen that dimension and all of a sudden
[29:57] Abraham's soul and spirit came back to
[30:00] the dust that we was in let me tell you
[30:03] something and then they began to walk
[30:05] around read your Bible for 40 days 30 to
[30:09] 40 days where I was Abraham does where
[30:12] was Joel dust who knows where it was it
[30:15] doesn't matter where it was it was a
[30:18] resurrection that means if the wind had
[30:20] blown it to the four winds of the earth
[30:22] God had to take every piece that I saved
[30:24] us and bring it back together that's how
[30:28] God will do it I don't care for fish eat
[30:31] you when the resurrection comes the fish
[30:34] got to give it up because the
[30:40] resurrection means to bring back that
[30:41] which it which was he ain't get I'm
[30:44] sorry I know some of y'all might want to
[30:45] look a look better than all that it'll
[30:48] be only because it's a glorified body
[30:49] but you gonna still look like you my
[30:55] precious brother Simon Smith you know
[30:57] he's a little short so if I could just
[30:58] get a few more inches no God purposely
[31:03] made you short just like he make us
[31:06] all right amen Oh God have mercy so we
[31:10] realize you so how do you know because
[31:13] David said that when he descended and he
[31:16] began to us sin he approached the gates
[31:19] and he says open up the gates and let
[31:22] let the King of glory come in right
[31:24] y'all know the song they said who was
[31:28] this King of glory
[31:29] they said the Lord strong and mighty in
[31:32] battle he is this King of glory
[31:35] somebody help me and what happened all
[31:38] of the dares Saints arose but before
[31:43] they went into that big March well I can
[31:46] see him I don't know how to eat him but
[31:47] I I just I when we get there they could
[31:50] just replay it nevertheless when they
[31:53] got the Saints Abraham and Sarah and all
[31:58] of them walked around the city and
[31:59] everything Amen because that's what the
[32:01] Bible said the graves were open and many
[32:04] of them what they walked around people
[32:07] saw them I think over five hundred
[32:09] people saw the resurrection but where
[32:11] were they
[32:13] five hundred people became witnesses but
[32:17] where were they didn't show up on our
[32:20] Burien it they are upper room look it up
[32:24] five hundred people
[32:30] five hundred and out of all of that they
[32:35] get 120 in the upper room what happened
[32:38] to all those who seen signs and wonders
[32:41] of the resurrection
[32:44] think about it look at in America she
[32:48] saw signs and oneness dead raised as an
[32:52] a blind open all of these things and
[32:54] where are they now see what about the
[32:59] man ten lepers who was healed and only
[33:03] one came back to say thank you Jesus
[33:05] what happened to the nine you see is
[33:09] that's that's where we are the Bible
[33:11] said we're living in an age that is
[33:13] unthankful it's an unthankful a
[33:18] each the more God gives you it's just
[33:20] ain't enough give me more think they
[33:24] just not satisfied is that right
[33:28] you know instances that Christians have
[33:31] become too materialistic and we have
[33:34] lost our vision of why we're here we're
[33:38] here to make the devil know that the
[33:41] seed of God lives and we come to declare
[33:44] Jesus Christ in Satan's Eden we got to
[33:51] prove to him that we're not his children
[33:54] I was a little disappointed Sunday I
[34:01] thought everybody would come here
[34:02] hallelujah is Easter oh it didn't happen
[34:07] that way
[34:08] but you know I thought to myself I said
[34:10] Lord only God can get you excited and
[34:14] the joy of the Lord is your strength so
[34:18] when I don't see joy I know you're going
[34:20] through something but let us not lose
[34:23] the fire of God that he's given to us
[34:26] let it not just come to a simmer it must
[34:30] be on fire the Bible said Amen he
[34:32] listened is that right revelation said I
[34:35] would that you be hot or cold
[34:37] lukewarmness is a dangerous position to
[34:40] be in
[34:41] you got to be hot or you got to be cold
[34:44] and that right so you got to understand
[34:47] I'm always done for this session it
[34:50] understand this you and I must remember
[34:53] and I was telling the Lord us is Lord
[34:55] we've got to take our post we've got to
[34:58] take our stand we've got to come to this
[34:59] place where we where we were supposed to
[35:02] be right you've got to come up you can't
[35:06] just stay back here in the back you got
[35:08] to get on the front line
[35:10] you got to declare what you are and who
[35:13] you are is that right every age if a
[35:17] prophecy was given it manifested itself
[35:21] every age paul aid they manifested it
[35:24] all the way up
[35:27] Lutheran's manifested their age West
[35:29] man's manifested a age the pillar
[35:32] as manifested their age this is the word
[35:35] age where the whole word comes together
[35:38] right the Alpha and the Omega you are
[35:43] bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh
[35:46] but you know what I think a lot of times
[35:49] people say well when I get old no no no
[35:51] it must be manifested in this dimension
[35:55] when Jesus he you got to understand that
[35:58] Jesus did not only declare he was the
[36:00] Christ what was so great about him being
[36:04] crucified he wasn't the only one that
[36:06] had ever been crucified merely before
[36:09] him many even on that day was crucified
[36:13] but the thing that made him Christ and
[36:16] made him Lord was that he got up there
[36:19] was a resurrection he said you can
[36:22] destroy this body I can destroy this
[36:24] temple in and in in three days I'll
[36:26] raise it up did he come up he came up
[36:29] Wow because in the Bible it is written
[36:33] in the Psalms I will not leave his soul
[36:36] in Hell neither will I allow his flesh
[36:38] and men to see corruption is that right
[36:41] that's why this resurrection must take
[36:45] place
[36:45] is that right the Bible said if that
[36:48] same spirit being you that was also in
[36:50] Christ Jesus as it quick tan is body it
[36:54] will quicken yours it'll raise you up it
[36:58] doesn't matter how you die a an atomic
[37:02] explosion drown in the ocean burn to a
[37:04] crisp when God said come every portion
[37:09] of you will come back together and then
[37:11] what happens hallelujah whoa God crowns
[37:17] you see people don't understand we will
[37:20] get a crown but the greatest crown you
[37:22] and I will get from God is the glorified
[37:25] body
[37:27] that's the crown brother Balaam talked
[37:30] about that's the crown that glorified
[37:32] body whew
[37:37] anybody with me if I had a different
[37:41] body I'd be perfect
[37:44] but this that gives me trouble in my
[37:48] soul I'm right in my spirit I'm right is
[37:51] this get rid of this and give me a new
[37:56] one I'll be alright I know how you feel
[38:03] I know to see him I know it it's the
[38:05] truth I love brother mahashiv praise the
[38:09] Lord this this this this this see what
[38:14] you feeding on and what you're
[38:16] experiencing is it's the body word the
[38:19] bleeding body word of Christ it is it is
[38:22] it is the revelation of this power it is
[38:24] the revelation of this day and it can
[38:26] only be given to a special class of
[38:28] people everybody can't receive this
[38:32] there hear it and call it a name but for
[38:38] those who are truly of God it rings the
[38:41] bell that's that's it it's right you may
[38:48] not even be able to fully explain it but
[38:50] you know it's right listen I'm a close
[38:56] on this thought because I'm not done
[38:58] with this but I want you to understand
[39:00] because of the origin as we said Christ
[39:03] says Jesus said I came from God I go
[39:06] back to God right in that same way you
[39:11] and I must see ourselves we came from
[39:14] God and we go back to God
[39:16] hello where was Jeremiah before he was
[39:19] in his mother's womb he was with God
[39:24] Jesus even said God said I knew you
[39:27] Jeremiah before he was formed in your
[39:29] mother's womb and I sanctified you and I
[39:32] called you to be a prophet before the
[39:35] child was born that call that's what we
[39:38] call predestination
[39:40] Alleluia Jesus himself was predestinated
[39:43] did you know that you were predestinated
[39:47] God saw you coming that's why the devil
[39:50] wanted to kill you and he couldn't
[39:52] wanted to get rid of you and he could
[39:55] not why because God saw you here
[39:58] today Jesus was look how crazy it must
[40:03] have sounded when when Isaiah said a
[40:07] virgin shall conceive you know the
[40:09] people say you know he's off his rocker
[40:10] now he doesn't even promise out a lot of
[40:13] thing but house they're messing up now
[40:19] even Isaiah probably thought what in the
[40:22] world and why did I say that could you
[40:24] know what he didn't have to necessarily
[40:26] understand what he was saying he just
[40:28] said what God told him to say no doubt
[40:33] he went through his old life not seeing
[40:35] that virgin come to pass but one thing
[40:39] Isaiah knew God spoke it and it was
[40:43] something that he'd never had to recant
[40:44] from he said I'm saying we know the
[40:48] wraptor or the translation of this body
[40:50] God is getting ready to change us why we
[40:53] are experiencing the change right now
[40:56] little by little right
[40:59] little by little you don't see oh all of
[41:01] a sudden like it's boo no no no little
[41:04] by little you have seen changes in your
[41:06] life it may not even be in the very area
[41:09] that you wanted to be wanting to be the
[41:11] most but it comes it comes because
[41:14] sometimes God leaves that thing that
[41:16] torments you the most there until he can
[41:20] get you where he wants you to be in
[41:23] other words it becomes your thorn in the
[41:26] flesh like Paul's thorn in the flesh God
[41:30] always got something in you to keep you
[41:34] humble you get puffed up with this
[41:39] revelation God said he let you drop a
[41:45] fall a little bit so you can look up
[41:48] again any good he's good he's merciful
[41:55] and understand because we have a perfect
[41:57] Savior he will bring forth a perfect
[42:01] people I'm a closed on this scripture
[42:04] 2nd Timothy 4 6 to 7 Paul says for I am
[42:09] now ready to be offered in the time of
[42:11] my departure
[42:12] is at hand I have fought a good fight I
[42:15] have finished my course I have kept the
[42:19] faith henceforth there is laid up for me
[42:23] a crown of righteousness which the Lord
[42:26] the righteous judge shall give me at
[42:29] that day not to me only but unto all of
[42:33] them also that love his appearing who
[42:39] you love is appearing oh yes Lord I'm
[42:44] just going to closing that note we're
[42:45] finished the next time we come through
[42:47] and my thing is it this rapture there's
[42:50] changing of the body it's it's it's in
[42:53] motion it's in progress now it's it's a
[42:56] secret that the world has nothing knows
[42:59] nothing about and I say this and I said
[43:02] you know humble way organizations and
[43:05] humble are they can't tell you they
[43:08] don't know this and and it's in its way
[43:11] it's supposed to be because what in
[43:14] Revelation the third chapter they put
[43:15] Jesus out the door read it he said I
[43:18] stand at the door knock what else
[43:20] Laodicea the third chapter of Revelation
[43:23] is the only time that Jesus Christ is
[43:25] put out of his own church but there was
[43:30] always somebody that was going to open
[43:33] and God said him and he's never left
[43:36] himself without a witness
[43:37] lest an
[43:44] I'm just trying to encourage you keep
[43:47] you on the right path times are hard and
[43:50] we're pressing right pressing press
[43:59] toward the mark of a high calling this
[44:01] is the high calling there bill many
[44:04] people cram any Christian saved but all
[44:07] Christians won't be raptured we're
[44:11] working for rapturing we want rapturing
[44:13] faith we want that material that's going
[44:15] to take us up is that right
[44:19] Enoch was translated but Noah being a
[44:25] Christian had to go through the
[44:26] tribulation he was a type of the
[44:29] tribulation Saints they weren't lost but
[44:34] the Bible said to be cast into outer
[44:36] darkness and there'll be a lot of
[44:38] gnashing of teeth and wailing why cuz so
[44:42] many people are gonna say oh my god I
[44:44] wish I had listened why didn't I hear
[44:47] him why why why
[44:50] can you imagine what Jenna's and Jambres
[44:55] felt when they found themselves in the
[44:57] region of the loss can you imagine those
[45:01] ones who raised up against Moses and
[45:04] their earth swallowed them up and they
[45:08] failed into the midst of a fire think
[45:14] about it we have that opportunity we
[45:18] have one of those invitations you know
[45:22] Hollywood always try to mimic eight I
[45:25] think they call it the red carpet type
[45:26] thing they got all the celebrities and
[45:29] only those VIPs are invited see God got
[45:33] that too that's the real one but the
[45:38] only thing is the streets will be made
[45:40] of gold real gold transparent gold
[45:43] something that will not fade or break
[45:46] right
[45:47] and you and I must understand that we
[45:49] have been called to this great banquet
[45:52] in the sky it sounds like a fairy tale
[45:55] but
[45:58] come and go with me to my father's house
[46:04] blue to my father's house
