[50:08] song
[50:11] said in that Baptist Church
[50:14] but to sing that from the depths of her
[50:17] heart
[50:18] I came to love it still love it
[50:21] and you know for some reason every time
[50:24] I sing that song I see the Bride of
[50:28] crying
[50:29] into heaven
[50:33] God is good to us
[50:35] we thank God for his goodness and his
[50:38] grace
[50:44] without him we would be nothing yeah
[50:49] appreciate everybody who's come out to
[50:51] the house of God
[50:56] yes Lord amen
[51:00] you may be seated for just a moment
[51:04] some of you may not even know what I'm
[51:06] about to say or
[51:08] you may not have heard
[51:13] but there was a lot of rumors and things
[51:16] going on yeah
[51:18] among the Believers
[51:21] concerning uh brother Daniel
[51:25] yeah
[51:31] so I want to say this is every one of
[51:35] you this morning
[51:38] stop it now
[51:42] both of them and myself
[51:45] met the other day
[51:48] everything was cleared the um they both
[51:52] made right with it
[51:55] they both uh left out in peace
[51:59] and so did I yeah so I want to say this
[52:03] by the grace of God
[52:04] [Music]
[52:07] how can I say it um
[52:10] things will happen the show's wrong
[52:13] today you can't stop the enemy we all
[52:16] are flesh
[52:17] but one thing God commanded us to do
[52:22] I love one another
[52:25] and the Bible says this
[52:29] one of the disciples asked Jesus
[52:31] how often should we forgive our brothers
[52:38] and Jesus says no no seven times seventy
[52:44] um
[52:47] every time someone make a mistake yes
[52:55] you have to forgive them
[52:58] and the Bride of Jesus Christ knows how
[53:00] to forgive
[53:01] [Music]
[53:03] so I want to say to those who have been
[53:05] uh spreading the fire
[53:18] have Sanctified ears
[53:23] don't let nobody trust you
[53:27] when somebody bring garbage to you
[53:30] you tell them to keep that garbage
[53:34] y'all understand what I'm saying
[53:36] uh if we're going to move toward
[53:39] Perfection
[53:41] we must learn how to Bridle our tongues
[53:47] when things are come your way
[53:51] and you don't understand it
[53:55] join in with it
[54:01] is that right Satan is the midst of is
[54:05] in the midst of all confusion
[54:07] and whenever is broken
[54:11] it'll always bring chaos
[54:15] and the only reason why I'm saying what
[54:17] I'm saying
[54:19] it's because neither other brothers are
[54:21] here to say it
[54:23] but but it's going to say what he needs
[54:26] to say in in Des Moines
[54:30] excuse me I I was sitting Iowa City and
[54:34] I was and brother Danny is in Iowa City
[54:36] Iowa City and they're worshiping
[54:38] together
[54:39] so let's go on with God
[54:45] and for those of you who don't know
[54:47] you don't need to know
[54:52] that's just the way it goes don't tell
[54:55] nobody nothing is dead from this moment
[54:57] on
[54:59] if something else should pop up
[55:07] but not as nicely as we are handling it
[55:10] now
[55:11] [Music]
[55:12] this is a
[55:23] yeah you'll see God in action
[55:27] you know people we love each other
[55:30] it's it's human you're human
[55:33] you're going to make mistakes
[55:36] you're going to say things that you
[55:38] shouldn't
[55:39] saying we allow our emotions to get in
[55:42] is
[55:45] I'm not going in detail but I heard
[55:48] things that were blatantly lies
[55:52] and I was in the midst of it
[55:54] so I should know whether it was a lie or
[55:57] true
[56:00] nonsense this is nonsense anyway
[56:03] you love me well like I say all the time
[56:09] if you don't love me you won't make the
[56:13] Rapture
[56:14] because not only do are you supposed to
[56:16] love your brothers
[56:18] but you're supposed to love your enemy
[56:21] too
[56:22] so you got nowhere to run
[56:26] you love the Lord
[56:29] that's what the difference in the
[56:31] message is now
[56:33] in denominations
[56:35] we we were motivated by law
[56:41] offices since the head stone is
[56:46] we come into Grace

[57:39] whether he's that good to you but he's
[57:40] good
[57:44] very very good I can't even tell you how
[57:48] good God is to me
[57:50] we're coming from second chronicles
[57:56] second chronicles the 15th chapter
[58:11] we're going to begin at the first verse
[58:15] we have a long reading
[58:18] but uh be patient with us
[58:21] beginning at the first verse
[58:24] and the spirit of God Came Upon Azariah
[58:29] the son of obedience
[58:36] and he went out to meet ASA and said
[58:40] unto him here ye me ASA and all Judah
[58:44] and Benjamin the Lord is with you while
[58:47] ye be with him and if you seek Him He
[58:50] will be found of you but if you forsake
[58:54] Him He will forsake you yes
[58:59] [Music]
[59:11] now for a long season Israel hath been
[59:15] without the true God
[59:17] and without a teaching priest and
[59:21] without law well
[59:30] but when they in their trouble did turn
[59:33] unto the Lord God of Israel and sought
[59:36] him he was found of them may Los Angeles
[59:45] and in those times there was no peace to
[59:50] him that went out nor him that came in
[59:53] but great vexation vexations were upon
[59:58] all the inhabitants of the country
[1:00:01] security
[1:00:07] I'm going to read that fifth verse again
[1:00:10] to pay attention to it
[1:00:14] and in those times there was no peace to
[1:00:18] him that went out no door to him that
[1:00:22] came in but great vexations were upon
[1:00:25] all the inhabitants of the countries
[1:00:33] and Nations was destroyed of Nations and
[1:00:37] city of cities for God did vexed them

[1:00:52] hands be weak for your work shall be
[1:00:55] rewarded
[1:01:04] and when Acer heard these words
[1:01:07] and the prophecy of Obed the prophet he
[1:01:11] took courage
[1:01:12] and put away the Abominable Idols of all
[1:01:16] the land of Judah and Benjamin and out
[1:01:19] of the city which he had taken from
[1:01:21] Mount Ephraim and renewed the altar of
[1:01:24] the Lord that was before the porch of
[1:01:27] the Lord
[1:01:36] [Music]
[1:01:43] even in this time we see by God's grace
[1:01:48] there was a cleaning of the house
[1:01:56] and and we understand
[1:01:59] when it goes on to say and he renewed
[1:02:02] the altar of the Lord
[1:02:08] Prayer was reinstituted
[1:02:11] [Music]
[1:02:19] something yeah
[1:02:21] and he gathered all Judah and Benjamin
[1:02:24] and the strangers with them out of
[1:02:26] Ephraim and manessa and out of Simeon
[1:02:28] for they fell to him out of Israel in
[1:02:32] abundance and when they saw the Lord his
[1:02:36] God was with him

[1:03:03] conditions
[1:03:04] [Music]
[1:03:06] so they gathered themselves together at
[1:03:09] Jerusalem in the third month in the 15th
[1:03:12] year of the reign of Asa is
[1:03:18] and they offered unto the Lord the same
[1:03:21] time of the spoils which they had
[1:03:24] brought 700 oxen and seven thousand
[1:03:27] sheep is
[1:03:35] and they entered into a covenant to seek
[1:03:38] the Lord God of their fathers with their
[1:03:40] heart and with all their souls
[1:03:43] [Music]
[1:03:51] that whosoever would not seek the Lord
[1:03:55] God of Israel should be put to death
[1:03:59] whether small or great where the man or
[1:04:04] woman
[1:04:12] for those of us who truly understand the
[1:04:15] message
[1:04:19] even though this is in the Old Testament
[1:04:23] referring to us
[1:04:25] in the sense that God wants us to seek
[1:04:28] us seek him with all our hearts
[1:04:36] will put us to death
[1:04:41] and they swear
[1:04:43] unto the Lord with a loud voice
[1:04:46] 14 first
[1:04:48] and they swear unto the Lord with a loud
[1:04:51] voice and with shouting and with
[1:04:53] trumpets and with coronets
[1:05:00] [Music]
[1:05:02] and all Judah rejoiced at the oath for
[1:05:06] they had sworn with all their heart and
[1:05:08] sought him with their whole desire and
[1:05:11] he was found of them you hear me
[1:05:15] and the lord gave them rest round about
[1:05:20] [Music]
[1:05:22] it
[1:05:24] is
[1:05:29] [Music]
[1:05:39] and also concerning Marca the mother of
[1:05:43] Asa the king he removed her from being
[1:05:46] Queen because she had made an idol in a
[1:05:50] Grove and ASA cut down their Idol and
[1:05:54] stamped it and burned it at the brook
[1:05:57] key drawn
[1:06:14] [Music]
[1:06:28] [Music]

[1:07:25] foreign and
[1:07:27] and that Spirit has become your idols
[1:07:33] may God help us this morning
[1:07:36] but the high places were not taken away
[1:07:39] out of Israel
[1:07:41] nevertheless the heart of Asia was
[1:07:43] perfect in all his ways

[1:09:03] the scripture here Amen in second
[1:09:07] chronicles it it really uh
[1:09:10] stirred me
[1:09:14] because what I saw uh was the uh father
[1:09:19] the uh the Holy Spirit
[1:09:23] taking a people that was totally
[1:09:25] backslidden
[1:09:30] and Reviving their souls
[1:09:35] you know when we think about Judah and
[1:09:39] Benjamin
[1:09:41] Judah means praise everybody knows
[1:09:45] and and Benjamin means the son of the
[1:09:48] right
[1:09:51] when studying this
[1:09:54] I saw not only uh the Bride of Jesus
[1:10:00] from Israel too
[1:10:03] Israel now the word
[1:10:08] means the help help
[1:10:28] so we know by God's grace
[1:10:30] that God is trying to get us a a picture
[1:10:34] here
[1:10:36] it is
[1:10:41] his name has a purpose
[1:10:45] take these characters
[1:10:52] [Applause]
[1:10:55] one of the things that Judah and
[1:10:57] Benjamin was a guilty of and then the
[1:10:59] souls
[1:11:06] they have become worldly
[1:11:10] long season
[1:11:13] they had seen a move of God
[1:11:17] hallelujah so when it came into that
[1:11:21] place
[1:11:22] What God Says in Chronicles
[1:11:27] they which are called by my names
[1:11:32] [Applause]
[1:11:36] I will hear from heaven
[1:11:39] and forgive their sins
[1:11:42] she turned from their Wicked Ways
[1:12:03] he said the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:12:06] the sickest of all people
[1:12:10] I'm talking naturally
[1:12:12] alone spiritually
[1:12:16] and the worst thing about being sick
[1:12:20] and you don't know
[1:12:23] and people go a long time
[1:12:31] it becomes terminal
[1:12:34] and we don't want no terminal here we
[1:12:38] want to get it while it's there
[1:12:41] somebody the other day you know
[1:12:44] infections know how to hide
[1:12:49] they'll hide in the body
[1:12:55] the body begins to fight back
[1:13:00] on the surface
[1:13:07] so when when things happen
[1:13:10] and they began things began to surface
[1:13:17] because now you know there's something
[1:13:19] working bad in the body
[1:13:23] a place where you can fix it
[1:13:27] is that right
[1:13:29] disagreements is not bad
[1:13:36] and that's where we're here today we're
[1:13:40] here to fix it
[1:13:42] actions
[1:13:45] will help you today
[1:13:51] the Bible says that but whenever Israel
[1:13:55] would turn
[1:14:00] whenever they would seek him
[1:14:03] he would always answer
[1:14:07] foreign
[1:14:45] [Music]
[1:14:50] who
[1:14:56] ever thank God for the grace
[1:14:59] now I never said my subject
[1:15:03] the subject tonight
[1:15:08] [Music]
[1:15:17] [Applause]
[1:15:43] that happened even at my own house
[1:15:49] it had not my wife
[1:15:51] mode
[1:15:52] [Music]
[1:16:16] Hallelujah
[1:16:23] but it took something
[1:16:26] and before I knew it yeah I had a change
[1:16:30] positions
[1:16:31] I was once standing back uh
[1:16:39] I was moving forward yes
[1:16:45] and I'm thinking Lord
[1:16:47] I need more work

[1:16:53] don't want to be like Peter when your
[1:16:55] pressure comes y'all hear what I'm
[1:16:58] saying because you fight with the swords
[1:17:03] I'm going on now where I was in the
[1:17:07] scripture
[1:17:08] because uh remember Judah means praise
[1:17:15] it means a worshiper or servant of God
[1:17:19] you see all these connections
[1:17:22] because they were blood related
[1:17:26] um
[1:17:34] about the Lamb of God
[1:17:38] somebody said me a little thing that did
[1:17:42] this morning
[1:18:12] the poison has an effect
[1:18:16] but because of the uh whatever that is
[1:18:20] in that Lamb's blood yeah
[1:18:26] y'all hear what I'm saying so what I'm
[1:18:29] saying is the blood of Jesus you might
[1:18:33] get bitten
[1:18:36] but the serpent bite can't can't kill
[1:18:39] you
[1:18:46] the blood of resist the Venom of the
[1:18:49] bike
[1:19:05] [Music]
[1:19:28] no matter what Satan
[1:19:42] [Music]
[1:19:55] because your names were written
[1:20:04] you can stop the Bride of Jesus
[1:20:10] oh I've been cast down yeah
[1:20:13] but not destroyed and so let me say it
[1:20:17] like this so you could better understand
[1:20:21] because you have failures
[1:20:27] doesn't mean it's done
[1:20:31] father
[1:20:40] you understand me
[1:20:42] the Bible says it like this a just man
[1:20:45] falls seven times in a day foreign

[1:21:07] Hallelujah let me move on by the grace
[1:21:09] of God

[1:21:41] grace of God
[1:21:42] but the thing that got my caught my
[1:21:45] attention more than anything
[1:21:47] they made a covenant
[1:21:49] and I trust this morning you wouldn't
[1:21:52] make a covenant

[1:21:57] that they would
[1:22:03] [Music]

[1:31:06] say the other day it's been a couple of
[1:31:07] weeks
[1:31:08] they failed to write it all down
[1:31:11] but I was dreaming
[1:31:14] and it was in the evening time or so
[1:31:18] after lunch or whatever time that you
[1:31:19] want to find a little nap
[1:31:22] and I saw the the the the pyramid
[1:31:25] and in this pyramid I I saw those colors
[1:31:29] rainbow but they were doing it they were
[1:31:33] living
[1:31:34] and as they moved
[1:31:38] they were blending uh blending a
[1:31:41] blending the best way I can describe
[1:31:44] describe
[1:31:48] characteristics
[1:31:50] and when I came out of the dream
[1:31:54] something said the blending of these
[1:31:58] Natures
[1:32:00] there's only one character
[1:32:05] right so it's not seven gods
[1:32:09] or seven angels
[1:32:12] it's literally the very nature of God
[1:32:18] broken down in his Simplicity
[1:32:26] somewhat what God is like
[1:32:29] because the natural man cannot
[1:32:31] comprehend God
[1:32:34] broke it down
[1:32:36] Hallelujah is that right and the Bible
[1:32:39] says if these Natures these characters
[1:32:57] really
[1:32:59] seducing a lot of people

[1:44:28] [Applause]
[1:44:29] the desperation was given to her by
[1:44:32] Grace
[1:44:33] because God had a purpose in her
[1:44:36] teeth
[1:44:38] sometimes we don't even understand
[1:44:44] [Music]
[1:44:46] that's the grace and love of God
[1:44:50] hallelujah and she sought the Lord God
[1:44:54] and she suffered ridicule

[1:45:46] than to suffer
[1:45:49] patience
[1:45:53] like I said the other day
[1:45:56] God is something else
[1:45:59] he can take a little toy
[1:46:03] and work that toy

[1:47:52] that represented us
[1:48:02] without the Holy Ghost
[1:48:05] and that's the way we are to think about

[2:03:47] want to do such a thing
[2:03:54] Ephesians
[2:03:55] beginning at the first verse
[2:03:58] Paul the Apostle of Jesus Christ by the
[2:04:02] will of God to the Saints which are at
[2:04:04] Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ
[2:04:07] Jesus

[2:05:19] Blame before him in love
[2:05:27] having predestinated us unto the
[2:05:30] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[2:05:33] him according to the good pleasure of
[2:05:35] his will
[2:05:36] soon
[2:05:41] whether you realize it or not justified
[2:05:49] how you said
[2:05:52] our our
[2:05:54] security not for security
[2:05:56] once they've always saved
[2:05:59] I can't think of it took my mind
[2:06:02] but what a lot of people don't
[2:06:03] understand but if you truly is the bride
[2:06:05] of Christ
[2:06:09] you can't become unsafe
[2:06:13] why because predestinations
[2:06:21] y'all hear what I'm saying before you

[2:07:26] to himself according to the good
[2:07:28] pleasure of his will

[2:07:34] the praise of the glory of his grace
[2:07:37] wherein he have made us accepted in the
[2:07:40] Beloved

[2:07:51] on your spirits
[2:07:54] on your flesh
