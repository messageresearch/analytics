[37:18] bring your spirits
[37:34] we
[37:39] in the name of jesus christ amen amen
[37:47] john chapter 4 verse 46
[38:02] so jesus
[38:16] where there was a certain nobleman whose
[38:18] son was sick at capernaum
[38:26] when he heard that jesus was come out of
[38:28] judea into gambling
[38:59] jesus said unto him go thy way thy son
[39:06] and the man believed the word that jesus
[39:08] had spoken unto him and he went his way
[39:10] come
[39:11] on
[39:17] and as he was now going down my servants
[39:20] madame i told him saying thy son liveth
[39:22] he loved
[39:35] yesterday at the seventh hour the fever
[39:38] left me
[39:40] questioned
[39:46] so the father knew it was at the same
[39:48] hour in which jesus said unto him thy
[39:51] son liveth jesus
[39:58] this again the second miracle that jesus
[40:00] did when he was come out of judea into
[40:02] galilee
[40:05] may the lord bless the reading of his
[40:06] word
[40:22] the second miracle
[40:26] it's a sermon
[40:32] and i found that my spirit was more
[40:35] closer to this
[40:51] that's real among us
[40:57] if god did a miracle before
[41:00] based on something
[41:04] and if somebody
[41:19] by this this morning
[41:23] i just want you to read over in verse
[41:25] 52.
[41:30] then inquired he of them the hour when
[41:32] he began to a man
[41:43] i don't know why jesus did not heal the
[41:45] sun in the first hour
[42:12] and as we're living in the seventh hour
[42:26] the church cannot go through that
[42:31] [Music]
[42:48] [Music]
[43:09] all those things have to go away
[44:06] shall the
[44:41] [Laughter]
[44:48] redemption in its fullness that's sir we
[44:51] asked my brothers and sisters
[44:55] i want you to be with me
[44:58] in the sermon the second miracle
[45:02] brother
[45:30] the second
[45:48] [Music]
[46:08] apparently it was not a miracle but it
[46:10] was a miracle
[46:15] it was it was a miracle because
[46:17] everything that's out of order in
[46:18] ordinary is a miracle we may bless
[46:20] yourself yes my brothers and sisters
[46:40] now
[46:46] perhaps there are there's a hundred
[46:48] prayer cards in here tonight
[47:35] it doesn't mean that you can't be healed
[47:50] wherever you
[48:04] has
[48:18] now the
[48:31] you have to accept it
[48:42] there is no other reason for him to go
[48:44] back and die
[48:46] for the healing
[49:13] what remains depends on
[50:24] it was
[50:51] it depends on what you believe
[51:34] yes my
[51:48] atonement
[52:03] preach
[52:05] he says in paragraphs
[52:10] he talks about the the the woman who had
[52:13] her
[52:14] sick child
[52:30] you have to
[52:42] allow me to tell you that as a servant
[52:43] of god
[52:54] [Applause]
[52:57] when you take god by his word
[53:02] and if whoever i'll set them up
[53:08] it will always produce the same results
[53:10] every time
[53:12] every time
