about what it sounds good to me appreciated was my fault brother brother Isaac told me he wasn't gonna be hearing of my apology for the services being laid to letter to see everybody here today tonight or this evening god is good to us amen as we stand which is going to go right into the Word of God we won't be long this evening but you know I want to start with the scripture according to first Peter we're just gonna do let's just read Peter first Peter first chapter 2 through 9 and then we'll go down to Ephesians 2 and 10 first Peter 1 2 through 9 I know your brother John said he was coming so let's just pray that God give him safe trip it was raining pretty hard out there so pray that God would give him a safe trip up are you so good to us I know everybody get tired I do and I'm looking for the Lord to come at any given time he knows and that's the part that I love about the Lord nothing catches him by surprise and he's always there for us first Peter the first chapter will begin at the second verse amen elect according to the foreknowledge of God that the Father through sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of blood of Jesus Christ grace unto you and peace be multiplied blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in the heavens for you who have kept by the power of God through faith at the salvation ready to be revealed in the last time Ephesians 2 Ephesians 2:10 yeah what a mighty God we serve mmm I'm so glad to be one of them I don't know what to do but so Ephesians 2:10 for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them let us pray father we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy Lord and everything that you have done for us we pray O God that you'll bless the service in a special way forgive us of our sins and our trespasses that we have said or done anything Lord that have not been pleasing in that sight forgive us and cleanse us from all unrighteousness Lord there is nothing we could do as you as it was this morning we're totally dependent upon you speak through us Lord bless our hearts strengthen us in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated as we said this morning we were working with the keys to the city and I like to say by God's grace there are so many people that have no idea they have no idea that we must go to heaven a certain way we can't get into heaven being a creature that doesn't belong there and by the fall it it's shut the door of heaven to us God as I said in the beginning had in his mind an empire I love that Empire it's good seem like Empire seemed to be greater than just a kingdom because in an empire you have a king kingdoms in kingdoms kind of like the way Jesus says in my father's house there are many mansions and understand that these mansions are also cities because you and I as an individual we are a city and the Bible said we are a city that set upon a hill that cannot be hid you and I must understand that this process of God that what God is doing with us our minds cannot even fathom we can't comprehend the glory like the scripture said that God has prepared for us and to think by God's grace that Satan has blinded the minds of the people where they would trade in something that's medial that something means that that's little of nothing for the kingdom of God think about how he saw traded in his birthright for just a little meal and every time I think about this meal that Esau did eat I think about oatmeal something of that nature of that caliber he traded in and you know why he did it because he did not comprehend he couldn't couldn't understand the importance of his birthright but the bride of Jesus Christ she may have come in like a shyster but one thing for certain she understands the importance of the birthright and she is willing to do whatever it takes to get it the thing that I love about God is that he never gives up on us even though we stumble even though we fall amen he's already got it in the word the gesture falls seven times in the day and get up he already knew he already knows every mistake we're going to make but at the same time he comes along and he justifies us even as the prophet of God said he knew man can't keep a covenant it started in the beginning we never have been covenant keepers and so God himself had to give us an unconditional covenant this is what I love about it because no matter how many times we fall and come short he said get up get up keep going and I love that I love that about the Lord Jesus we were talking this morning about characters and we left off with a few characters of the Bible and I believe with all my heart in this Bible represent you somewhere every character in here was just that was yesterday it's still today why because God will take the spirit but he'll lead the man I mean take take the man but leave the spirit and save them does the same thing he takes the man but he leaves the spirit so it's one of those things where Solomon could truly say there's no new thing under the Sun and you and I must understand we must find ourselves in the scripture I don't mean no harm but this might sound a little strange but you know I like I like the story you know a Rahab and I like the story of the woman at Jesus's feet you know to me those stories are just because in those scenes you see such an intimacy something that took place in an in the supernatural that most people couldn't see and in when you especially the woman that Simon's how she she entered into this this this dimension where she came to recognize who she whose feet she was washing and I think that's what happens sometimes we come to church and we forget we come to wash his feet we come to fellowship with him is that right and we sometimes fail to see that Christ is the one who has brought us thus far I'm getting ready to read something in just a moment because every time and I have been guilty I have been guilty I was listening to the message perfect weakness perfect strength and I was just I can't let me say it like this flabbergasting I was just I was like God where are we where are we where is this bride where is this bride because it must be a manifestation Jesus Christ wasn't just a word he was the manifestation of the word he was a very vindication of the word Malachi 4 wasn't just in the Bible as the word that word had to live it had to be formed in human flesh is that right it's like Mary she was the part of the scripture Mary was a part of the script a virgin shall conceive but it couldn't just lay there on the pages it just wasn't gonna be there just darling on the pages somewhere in time it had to make manifest and it did the bride is not some kind of being made up by some prophet as a man the bride is a reality and she must manifest the characteristics of Christ now we understand why the prophet of God said there's only going to be a few that make a rapture he didn't say a few besaid he said a few that will make a rapture because people are not with this this world has been designed to distract you right it's kind of like when when the self release and woman and when a when a boy fell sick and she said to the to the drivers he said whatever you do in other words don't let nothing distract you keep your eyes set and keep going until we get to the man of God I think that's what we need to do keep your eyes focused until you reach the destiny and your destiny is Jesus Christ you can't believe and when I say believe on him I'm not talking about on Christ by way of a denominational explanation because you see none of them are right they are all wrong about brothers why you saying you right I'm not I'm just saying all organizations and denominations are wrong because they add and take away from the word you so all you mean brother we see you can be a denomination in this message and if you are you're not going to produce what this word says I'm not saying all denominations and all organizations are going to hell I could never say that because once I was there I'd look at those places as being a place where God sometimes preserved people until they come to the truth the Bible tells us according to st. John 14 if we believe on him as the Scriptures have says he that is identification believing on him as the scripture has said right now I must say something which is going to be quite harsh because remember E believe everything except when the devil taught interpreted one word wrong and she broke the scripture and it caused death to every one of us think about it what part of the word will we allow Satan to make us disbelieve because once you disbelieve guess what death sets in it's automatic it is an automatic my point is this how are we're going to come to perfection if we do not go the provided way we must go the provided way however God provides is the way we must go in order to have eternal life is that right we didn't know and we know for an example just how it is always is whenever there's our original there's always a copycat there's always something Amen that man will design to look like the very thing and winning and in reality it is not so what do you mean brother books you know in the days of Noah I wouldn't know how many people built boats thinking that it was going to work you see because you got to understand this thing was fascinating that this man will build an ark on top of the mountain where there is no water and he's keep preaching a lot of water is coming can you imagine the mockery and the jokes and everything that it would have taken place because of this thing but to see no one knew he heard from God and he knew no matter what mockery no matter how people made fun of him he had to speak to the pattern what sis didn't make to build such a huge rock with one door think about it what if something should happen how you going to escape you understand what I'm saying you know people made the market but you see no knew that he was this disart was salvation he knew that it was the only thing no matter how grand other boats may have been or how grand people may have built shelters he knew that this art was going to survive the storm that was coming and what I'm saying is he stayed with the word in spite of the pressure that was given to him he stayed with the word my thought is to say this as I was saying to other people I said how the scripture have laid there for so long you've heard some people preach about it the statue of a perfect man and all of these things and but how many people have emphasized fully that this is a must it's not a choice it must be so in order to enter into the city only the character of Christ will enter into the city and and my thing is this you say what do you mean it is a thing that God had excuse me has hidden and he's given to his own children his children it is because they are the only ones that can ever come into the perfect statue of Christ and when God comes to a you must be born again that is not an option the word lost shows that it is it has to be you don't have a choice there are penalties if this is not done and you say what do you mean what are you trying to get to just a moment because I want you to understand that when it comes to character cry you cannot do it no man can add one cubit to his statue right but my quick reasons why this means so much to me I used to be apostolic we - I used to dance we should speak in tongues run up and down the aisle see a miracle every now and again you understand me we thought we had it me we thought that was it right then you find over here people doing this and people doing that and and you just couldn't figure it out how they have the Holy Ghost they can do this and do that and still do that right then the message comes we didn't know we were naked we actually thought we were clothed and the message comes and he finds us naked right right but let's understand he said when the Son of Man come when he comes shall he find faith but he didn't it wasn't there everything we had was hybrid it had the appearance of the genuine but if he would hold it under the light it was kind of fit it looked like the real thing but it was manufactured not by God but by man and I fear that that's what's happening now in this message we have lifts it means persons this man is great and that man is great and they'll all get him for your convention and if you get him for your convention this is going to happen and it never happens they get excited they shout they praise God and they leave out the same way that came in and I don't mean no harm aren't we tired of that we want real we want real change we won't real word and the only way we bring real word is to go back to the real interpretation it doesn't matter how plain it may sound as long as it works but we've had the Philistines and they've come among us with the great swelling words and being more educated than others because they're more educated in others those who are illiterate and can't read or write and really pronounce words correctly or left on the own sideline and those are the kind of people that God can use is that alright see your life proves what you are that right and the Bible said by your fruits see people's well i i'm message and you know i'm a christian but they're no fruits you know love brotherly kindness long-suffering patience you know you have to almost push people to pray like i heard her brother say he he II thought the epistles was a brother he said he thought the epistles was brothers to the Apostles he didn't know that just shows you sometimes people because they don't know the Bible they don't know oh and if you trying to make yourself act sweet and humble and so forth then you are still outside of the kingdom now how many people we know that do that huh they act they act Christianity we had it you know even in Pentecost but we have it among us and I don't mean no harm because I'm a preacher I see things that other people don't see i I see it from the top level and you think to yourself these people are leading and guiding other people and they themselves need to be corrected who's going to correct him you know hear what I'm saying who's going correct them and the people don't understand these people is that the word the Bible said if the blind leader leads the blind they both fall in the ditch you know what we do we look over yonder instead of looking here that's why God has given us the message we need to read it we need to listen to it we need to bring it to the Bible hallelujah because the message make this Bible live hallelujah it is the revelation of this is that right in other words the New Testaments the revelation of the Old Testament and the message is the revelation of the new that's what it is they are the same they're showing to us that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he does not change that's one thing you can hold about God he doesn't change and if God doesn't change that mean his character doesn't change is that right in an all to be compatible to God you must come up to the kind of character that he is God ain't gonna stoop down to your character you got to come up to his character as we said today you know this morning Esau and he looked like he was the better man but it was Jacob see it's what's in the heart that makes you who you are is that right this is what the message of show listen is so true so true I've seen so much and I can't get it out like I really want to but let me say it like this it is the seed of God in you that brings the change and that seed cannot live until you die how's it everything other than that you sure what do you mean you can have the Holy Ghost on your flesh you can shout and dance you can have the Holy Ghost on your spirit hallelujah and likewise and currently sweet daddy what God looking for he looking for those who are truly born again that means it must get down into the soul where the seed is once the seed is quickening it was German ties it'll grow up into Christ and all you have to do is feed it water it and the image of Christ you you don't change it it changes you it pushes out all the darkness in your life Hitler logo becomes a struggle because the life in you is the the life that battles fights the darkness and pushes it out brings it to the surface and pushes it out Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever look look at look at the change in which God made with Peter huh that's why Peter can write add to your faith virtue this is the divine nature of God Peter didn't know what that was before the the day of Pentecost Peter was a fighter hallelujah Peter was a traitor he betrayed Christ come on that's real he did worse than Judas as far as I'm concerned he denied in three times Judas only had the one but it was the seed John that was only inside of him that made the difference he got a quickening he was up in the upper room where they were and however they died and riding up there and when the Holy Ghost came hallelujah Peter was never the same so he knew what was necessary for us to live this life and he knew he could right under the inspiration the divine nature of God the thing that gets me because they talk about the entrance and brother branham came in this last day and he preached the statue of a perfect man now what how many scriptures you how many preachers you hear constantly talking about that because we see that the bride of Jesus Christ is getting off course Holy Ghost hallelujah huh I want to tell you this it meant those Amen that's out outside of what we call how do we say the message you see more signs and wonders there than you do here you know why because at least they got what they have they believe it we've got the whole book we have the whole book that means everything in the book has potential to come alive Oh somebody help me here we've got the whole book but you see what hinders us is our old abilities because we think we can help God you can't help God see that's the thing every time you and I get in a position where we think we can help God you've messed up God needs somebody who really knows ain't no good God needs somebody that knows Amen that they can't do nothing without him that's what the pulse it ain't God that lives for this Christ that lives in me see Paul had come to that place he realized I can't help him he's the only one that could help but I need to be dead I need to come to a place where I have pushed out myself so that God can come in Oh help me Jesus I'm not gonna be long right a man she's the whole picture from Genesis to Revelation it's nothing wrong it's ellingham materializing so he can be touched feel and in the Millennium there is Eliam sitting on the throne see and that's right with all of his subjects around him that he protestin ated before the foundation of the world so you got to understand this whole thing is that now in this last day you are the Jesus Christ the world will see you are the Jesus Christ that the world would see if you allow your light to be here if you put it under a bushel if you cause you're like not to be seen then you are missing out on the opportunity in which God placed you here for we're not religion and we shouldn't wear a cloak of message but our word we supposed to be you understand me we don't need a religion we need action we need life we need the world of God to be live through us you and I should never stop until this happens we must allow that to happen and the point is is when you stop thinking you something and you can help you can help God we do it and if you're not careful you know even even as someone who can sing you think because you can do it look you know move your head and do a little something you're here you're gonna answer are you gonna make it better y'all know they do it if you not kept you'll do it you know sometimes you're on the piano whatever and whatever and I'm not I'm cracking on nobody I'm just saying we have to be careful that we're not trying to help the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit must lead us and we're not supposed to lead the Holy Spirit that's all I'm saying and that's where we have fallen because even though even among our ranks we figure if we could set the message in a certain way and reach a certain climax the people going to get excited and God is gonna be happy with it no because the people get excited and because the anointing fall doesn't mean that God is satisfied woo somebody help me here is that right brother we know what David did he put the rock on a different cart and they were singing and jumping and shouting and praising God like the real Pentecostals and then the man touched and what happened it brought death see anything all of that can still be a deception when Jesus come back he gonna look for those who stayed with the word am I making sense now to be perfect right this is what God is trying to tell us in all of you to be perfect that seed I put in you must be German ties and there is a law you must die and rot in order to live where do you Dyanne rot on your knees somewhere where you can pray and you can ask God to kill you you become Abraham and Isaac hallelujah you're bringing the sacrifice where God can slay you and understand when God gets you to that place where you ought to be slain guess what he says I have myself a sacrifice he then gives you his sacrifice which is Christ himself hmm oh my you love the Lord when we are insufficient perfect shrimp I permit weakness ourselves then we are subject to you to God's Spirit as long as we think we can do it then we can't do it but when we get to a place where we know we can't do it then we yield ourselves to God and he does it so then if it's us trying to do it will fail but if we'll just yield ourselves to God then God can't fail there's only one thing that God cannot do and that's fail he can he can do anything else but failed he cannot fail so as long as we're trying in ourselves and depending on our own abilities there you go and so far well you see you see you said what what do you mean that's why Paul said I did not come to you with excellence of speech I couldn't used some of these great Greek words on you I could have spellbound you he said but I didn't come with that with man's devices I came with one thing and that is the power of the Holy Ghost see that is what the message is it is to release the power of the Holy Ghost what was all Elijah a John is supposed to be on Elijah but but Elijah had to die to himself he had to die in rot to get with he God and you and I must die and rot to get with what he had that's the truth there's only we trying in ourselves and depending on our own abilities and so forth well we'll do nothing but when we get to a place where we know we're nothing then God can use us the important thing of important things that we must master now remember this especially you young preachers and lay members alike there's one thing that we've got to master why did he say that why did God allow him to say that because he knew that's where the problem would be he knew that if we expect to fulfill God's desire in our life that is if we have to master the thought of human ability if we ever get to a spot where we think that we can do it with our own internal intelligence and our own ability we've got to master that in such a way that when we get rid of the thing and lay it aside so that God can use us all human abilities and you know we do we have to be really careful on that that we are literally when I'm when I message calm or when God gives us a message we're not trying to intellectually design it we're trying y'all hear what I'm saying you and I are not here to impress people we're here to bring the word whether they like it or not right we want to project the very thoughts and words of God that's it it's all you not deep enough I'll tell you what when you get as deep as the word or too deep are far deeper than the word can take you then let me know because one word of the word is deep this is talking about brother the Bible says we all heard me say this the other night universe one verse created the whole world and all the universe in the beginning God created the heavens in the earth one statement created everything in all of eternity all that has been created is resting upon those that verse think about it it's holding everything together because God said let there be and think about it if you and I are creators little creators made off of the great God Elohim think about it if we get in the mind frame that we're going to die out to everything that God that God wants us to die out to rot so that we can he can live with us can you and I can't even fathom the things that God wants to do with this little bride everybody said well you know we just I don't know we were word word word let me tell you something the Bible said my word is spirit and truth spirit and life not letter you understand me I can remember this thing backward and forward and it'll do me no good until it's living it is the Living Word that brother Branham is talking about right it is the Epistle you are the Living Word you're supposed to be the Epistle you supposed to be written in a read of all men you and me when somebody who can't read they should be able to see God in you and it could be eight is that right those people didn't know Paul but they saw Jesus and Paul and they really believe if I could just get under the shadow of him I'll be healed that wasn't just given football that's for the bride of Jesus Christ I'm almost done look what he says when we expect him saying this guy he's a great person this is a great person I'll just lean upon him that's displeasing to God when you do that there are no great wands among us hello all have sinned and come short of the glory of God and when we began to give man God's glory you're in trouble he is displeased that's why these great meetings never accomplished anything because we give him in praise and glory when it ought to be gone to God all of it not some of it all if you believe the message that's what he says perfect strength perfect weakness he said it displeased God when you do that we must learn or lean upon God and God alone we mustn't trust the ability of ourselves or any man we must completely yield to God no ability I don't care whose it is we'll never be a beautiful in the sight of God see it looked like God is using them but at the end of the day where is the change where's the change people wherever the prophet of God went to a meeting there was a change and that same kind of a change must happen in us we must bring change is that right that's what he said he said the bride of Jesus Christ has the ability to change the atmosphere think about how sweet it was here this morning I don't know where anybody was blessed but I know I was there was such an anointing such a sweet anointing here I don't even know what my sister was playing but I got connected and all of a sudden the Holy Spirit just came over hmm I'm almost done I'm almost done this quote is the last because I want you to get over here understand and we're gonna make the city you cannot even depend upon yourself that right oh it's true I was the pastor in Lima Ohio and I didn't know this but the people said brother Brooks we so depended on you to bring the undaunted that's what they told me so even the Sony was an even when I it didn't go across when I was up there so leaning I knew when brother Brooks come it was going to happen who is brother Brooks and they were spiritually being depleted because they were looking at me instead of him that's why God moved me guarding on a chair his glory with no man and I always told us and listen don't put me nowhere where God will cause me to fall please don't do that to me because God will cause a minister to fall just to get the people's eyes back on him think about the people of God and being ministers follow more than one way you know it is not always sexually sometime they fall because they think there's something they begin to get lifted up and even though they could articulate and bring the Word of God you'll find out there's no power behind it huh cuz they're taking the glory that's supposed to be God's you can't do it I don't care if you're musician I don't care if you're singer I don't give you a preacher I don't care if your mother whatever you are when anything come good is God who did it and not you always give the glory back to God I'm almost done God has to get all of our abilities out of us before we can achieve his purpose you know sound easier said than done but God has to get all of our abilities now we understand where Paul says I count everything I've ever known as dung it's no good to me it's no good to this ministry I can't use it all I need is God right now right if he's got something for us to do and as long as we feel that we're going doing pretty good job out of it then we'll never be able to be used of God whoo I'm doing a pretty good job Hey that shows ain't nothing happening in your life there are no achievements because let me tell you something only God can make the flowers grow yeah you can pull all the kind of water you want on it and dung it and do everything else but if God don't give the increase it won't grow like I was saying the other day you know the rain comes to manifest to see that it's that is there and it also comes to bring maturity or whatever the seed is you love the Lord and I'll keep ministering on this because people if we're gonna make a heaven this got to change do anybody else know what I'm talking about I'm saying I got I got more changes more changes must be made in my life I mean y'all ready for heaven we can say that with our mouth but our lives gonna say something different we need all of Satan out of our lives is that right brother man don't say like this he said when the blood the power of the the fire of the Holy Ghost falls upon us it burns every demon out of us that's in the future home every demon out of us it doesn't mean you're not tempted but the fire is to kill every demon that's inside and from that the devil can come from the outside but on the inside is you're full of light let's tan to be like gee to be live G older [Music] once again [Music] [Music] all [Music] I'm sorry sisters I do scream sometime and I forget you appreciate everything you know people thought I believe with all my heart I just it's something happening I can't put the thing on it but I know God it's right now opening that door for those who want to change I believe that I believe that right now this is a time if you really want God to change you and to deliver you this is the moment because I believe down the road that day and that time is gonna be shut so this is the day this is the time God has been so good to us and it would be a shame for us to run this place and come short in the lateness of this day in this hour with God is bleeding it and sharing with the people and the Word of God is opening up in a different wave it's bringing us to avoid serious mind and more of a serious consciousness about what brother branham delivered he didn't come to tickle our minds and to give us this great revelation of things and what good is that gonna do us if we don't apply it if it doesn't this must become your life that's why the angel told John eat the whole book it means it must become your life and only God can do it we have you come sing brother one song and it would be everybody wanna be like oh that's all I want to disappoint best moment I have no other ambition I
