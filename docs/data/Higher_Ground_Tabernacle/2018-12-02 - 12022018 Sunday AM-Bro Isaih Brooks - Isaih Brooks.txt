TRANSCRIPT
========================================
is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her and happy is one that retain it her was that alright let us pray father God we thank you for your mercy and your grace this morning we thank you for being real to us we pray this morning that you your perfect will be done Lord anoint your servant this morning break and destroy the yokes of the enemy and father will be careful to give you the praise the glory in the honor feed your people this morning in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen we like you may be seated we like to give you a subject and we like to say by God's grace that God has already determined what the end of our lives will be he is a God that is perfect and therefore he cannot change his mind our days are numbered as I said the last time when we spoke it doesn't matter how many vitamins you take it doesn't matter how much anti-wrinkle cream you you put on your face because we all have been stricken now I'm not saying anything wrong with the cream I'm just saying no matter what kind of medication you may be involved as far as taking it is not science that prolong your days we know by God's grace that there is a living God you can't thirst after God except God put the thirst in you but the Bellamy verse says sometimes it takes a long time for son and daughter of God to realize that they are sons and daughters of God that's why you find some people who have may have lived about 90 years a sinner but just before they leave salvation is brought to their door you and I determines nothing god is already determinate he has determined the bounds of the ocean and the sea he has determined how far you got to go in this life he is already determined how much you're going to achieve and none of us can supersede what he has already determined you and I ought be glad because God gave us something that the world is looking for he didn't give it to you when you were born in this dimension but he gave it to you before the foundation of the world he planted a seed in you and that seed in itself his brother Jasper said last week has a time and a season it's going to spring forth I like to entitle this message and you'll see where I'm coming from in just a moment at the scent of water sound pretty strange but God liking himself to water water can be a life-giving force as well as a destructive force that is living in this world can live without water water is essential for living naturally and spiritually remember he told the woman at the well I know you're thirsty but you're really thirsting for something that is spiritual and not natural this natural water you're gonna have to come back to this oh well but the spiritual water that I give you will spring up into eternal life and you never thirst again - for a long time we never knew what never thirst again and I wondered what it meant but there is a time in your life as a Christian you are completely filled and when you are completely filled you never thirst again you'll notice a it's like drinking water when you drink water and you are filled up to Minette water you'll never thirst as long as you are filled and so is it with the Spirit of God I love this if I had a subtopic I would basically a subtopic this message planted among the trees because God liken us as trees look at Genesis you'll find that God when he was doing a be creating I'm a read it in just a moment Genesis 2 5 through 9 when he planted the trees he also planted Adam Genesis 2 5 through 9 and plant of the field before it was in the earth in every herb of the field before it grew for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there was not a man to till the ground but there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground and the Lord God formed man of the dust of the earth and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul he himself was a tree but he was a different kind of tree he was a tree that could talk he was a tree that could walk he was a tree that could clap his hand all right the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food The Tree of Life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil said what do you mean brothers I'm coming to it understand amen that the tree of life who was it absolutely was Jesus Christ and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil who was it he was Satan but God called them trees Adam was a tree Eve is a tree that right and we are the offspring and the fruit of that tree let me say it in a tree cannot live without water have you ever seen it it's amazing how trees can grow in some of the most strangest places you even find trees in the desert and that tree is designed to find water when no other animal would ever know where is that those roofs are so attracted it is literally drawn to wherever the water may be remember there was no rain all it was was a mist and God used that mist and he grew a beautiful garden see because those trees even knew how to take what was given to them and make life out of it that's in the natural what about the spiritual because you cannot even grow it takes water to literally push fruits out that tree can't produce a fruit without water it can't live without water it can't produce fruit without water hallelujah you said well you mean brother Brooks just bear with me in just a moment even in the scripture we find out that even nature nations are called trees Israel is called the fig tree hello and brother random preached the bride tree you are tree and you must bring forth fruit but you'll never be able to bring forth fruit if water if is not present now I'm speaking spiritual without the Holy Ghost you'll never be able to produce spiritual fruit you and I must realize that even Pharaoh himself was called by God a tree to whom thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden every tree bring forth of his kind you can't be me I can't be you but we all have the same life of God on the inside I hope some of y'all understand me Jesus walked by a tree it was a fig tree and it brought forth no fruit and that fig tree was cursed because it failed his purpose hello brother branham lack in his life he said let the Holy Ghost which is the water of God let it push out let it push out you keep drinking but let it push out and we'll come to church we'll sit here and then we act like we're something on the wall somewhere but the Bible the Bible tells me just at the scent of water it doesn't have to be an outpouring but just at the scent of water I don't want to jump but that tree Birds think about it just little bits of dewdrops we're due to a plan and I wonder what's happening at a time where God is pouring out his spirit well there's the evidence of that spiritual water it's not there to decorate the leaves but is there to penetrate that particular Pratt so that plaid can bring forth fruit so I can live you and I cannot live without the anointing hallelujah it is the anointing that destroys the yokes and as long as we fail to consecrate ourselves and bring us into a position where the anointing can come in we will soon dry up and wither away but all without it you'll never know your purpose you'll never know what you are until the anointing reveals what you are you said what what do you mean brother Brooks remember Aaron's rod Aaron's rod never bought it until it was placed in the Holies of Holies right under the water of God right in the presence of the anointing and once it was placed in there it brought it it bloomed and it brought forth almonds from that rod from that blooming front we now know that that rod was brought from almond tree the identity of that dad rod was now made manifest you said what do you mean brother was that's the Bible said it rains on the just trees it rains on the unjust it rains on the sweet unknown on the weak and it raised on the tail but you don't know what you are you know what the rain is you cry for it because every living creature needs water every living thing needs water but that water only manifest where you came from and where you're going a kind of a real tree what you are is all I want to get better thank God because if you hunger and thirst for righteousness the Bible says you shall be filled hallelujah this is what brother Branham says which was first is he which was first a sinner or a savior a savior for Savior is more powerful than a sin than sin which was first the healer or the sickness it couldn't be a it couldn't be a hill unless he was over the sickness it is a healer he can conquer the secret and faith is the victory that overcomes every curse of the devil faith is a victory faith in what not faith in your church not faith in your greed not faith in some man but faith in Jesus Christ who made the promise that's the victory what is it it is the victory see my almost feel crippled but faith is the victory I still feel sick but faith is the victory oh it's overcomes the world see when you climb when you can climb into God by prayer until you see the fees conquered unto you there is nothing that can hurt you then let me say that again when you can climb into God by prayer until you see the thief conquered under you there is nothing that can hurt you then you overcome you got 50 miles of elbow room you're sailing free then you who have been a drunkard and a slave to whiskey you would be a master over him then that old devil of alcohol that made you drink he's your master now but when you get faith I don't mean make-believe real thing he's your servant then you can lay down tobacco you women and men when it comes to a place to where you can get to that spot to where you have overcome it by faith you're the master then Oh somebody help me because you and I must realize amen what and who we are what tree you from hello what tree are you from you are from the Tree of Life hallelujah let me move on blessed is the man what people don't understand without the nona you never know who you are you'll never know your ability hallelujah let me put it in this way here was said uh-uh-uh David excuse me Samson and we find out that Samson had lost his identity until God had blinded him until God had made him a spectacle amen to the Philistines hallelujah but one day he found out that his anointing had come back see it is that's what about say a carnal mind cannot perceive the things of God ah because when you're born again you're born of another world you from heaven you're born Amen to see things that the natural man can't see blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the Lord and his law that he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of waters that means they meant by God's grace he has a strong a place where he can think oh you look at these Christians that a void of joy some of y'all look like y'all comatose this morning y'all just staring I could hardly hear Amen from some of you are you alright hallelujah Amen up from the tree of life when the tree the tree of life is full of joy I'll let you know that's the truth you know anyway let's move on thank you brother I love that move amen he was the only one thank you not the only one but you know me and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in season now come on where are you free where are your fruit like a herd of brother the other day you you you can't pluck up something that has never been planted huh you can't read roots from a tree that doesn't exist y'all know what I'm saying you and I must understand even if you don't search for that water you're gonna die because each and every one of us have been wounded by sin that right that's what David said as the heart painted for the water Brooks show my soul for the living god if you don't have a thirst you better get to God you need the thirst for God hallelujah unless you say I'm filled already if you filled already you know I tell you what I was telling the church the other day doubt in Iowa City I say here it is a great earthquake struck Alaska right by Anchorage right in that area encouraging all and brother branham said and I think was 1962 when the judgement struck the earth it went up that coast and it almost sunk Alaska you know by way of science they said that thought underneath there is locked and loaded and it is going to move see what happened just the other day is not the end of it it's just the beginning it has started our movement and eventually Amen and I really believe sometime soon California is gonna get the big one now if you are not how can I say it if that does not alarm you in a good way a way of Lord let me examine myself let me make sure I am filled and sealed with the Holy Ghost should California go down I'll go up if you're not ready yet when do you think you will be it oughta make you thirsty for more God hallelujah you know I'm not done with Jeremiah I just gave you guys a rest but there in Jeremiah Jeremiah tells about our day it was his day but it's a p-ting where the Christians had become so worried and the Christians had become so onion - to God that no matter what was being preached they wouldn't hear instead of them receiving the Word of God and enjoying the Word of God you know what they did they beat Jeremiah they put him in prison and eventually they killed him hallelujah and we see that even this morning there are those of you who would like you're not connecting you think I don't feel it I do feel it cuz I'm connected to him but let's move on I thought I'll throw that out because there are so many people in this message I want you to look around right now and judge within yourself where and how do we compare to the Pentecostal church on the day of Pentecost no let's go on how do we compare to those who we call shocked in the 1960s and excuse me 50s amen let's call 1906 the Zulu Street revival where do we stand in comparison now we are all saying yes we've got the truth but that ain't just that just not all it it's not truth his life job says and I love Joe because Joe was I like I like Joe because Joe was kind of like a spiritual scientist to me he saw everything out he looked around and he saw the trees he saw this he saw that he saw that everything had a chance to come back but he says oh but man where is man in there you understand me Joe 14 17 17 he said for there is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it was proud again and that the tender branch there uh will not cease so you understand that if you cut a tree down and that cut that tree is connected to some water vein it'll grow again it'll start all over it will not die in a sprout out branches of the sprout I'll leave and then because that water is supplying that tree with life and though the root thereof watch all in the earth and the stop there up die the ground get through the sit of water that's my subject it will bud and break forth bowls like a plant just give me a little bit kind of remind you what the man inhale says let Lazarus come and dip his hand in a little bit of water people he couldn't take that water the hell because water is a symbol of life and Lazarus was dead there's a give me a little bit of water and I have a revival see that's how it is with the tree give me a little bit of water and I have a revival that's why we need the anointing my brother Sam you know I really appreciate you don't owe me now call your name out yes I do because you an example as far as I'm concerned I'm not saying you faultless he goes to school but he finds time to come to church because you know what that's life liar amen we'll always find a place to find water somebody help me here hallelujah the roots will go down in the ground even though the ground may be solid but those roots will penetrate because it smells there's water somewhere is that right that's how it is with a deer hallelujah when a deer is wounded it's like I gotta call attached I gotta find where the water is there's a little bit of water somewhere if I could just have just a little bit I'll know I have a revival oh but the man diet and wasted away yeh man given up the ghost and where is he as the waters fell from the sea and the flood decay it and dry it up so man lie it down and rise it's not to the heavens be no more they shall not awake nor be raised out of their sleep hear what I'm saying listen without the spiritual water there is no awakening have you have a soul seeds all seized do not bud Oh cease don't come up it could be a Pinto be seed but all of them doesn't necessarily have life thing or they don't meet the quad vacations or conditions did you know that even among the pinto beans every one of them are elected and chosen by God God is number the man of pinto beans but he's nothing every tree he knows exactly where you are hallelujah is that right God comes along and you're not making the kind of fruit you're not producing the kind of fruit he wants what does he say he says I'm coming down and I'm gonna be a farmer to you and I'm gonna prune you bad and when God begins to cut off this and cut off but he's cutting it off so that life and that that that water that's pushing life through you will bring forth more fruit somebody help me here Oh glory to God you said what do you mean actor Santa water see I come to church and God don't always out boy over here but just a sin go out here feeling much better I feel revived hallelujah but we're not just wounding a set we want out poor job said looking man he's a tree but he's gonna lie down he's gonna fall he's gonna die everything has a resurrection what about man hallelujah and everything has a season like our brother said everything has a season you got a winner you gotta summon you got a spring you got a fall and every one of us must go through it hallelujah you know I've been told and I don't know how true it is but I've been told that a tree is it is at its original color in the fall but that tree is dying per se the life is leaving the whole of the tree but it's at that time it's most beautiful everybody go from coast to coast here in America up in the mountains down in the valleys to see the trees dying but they're not dad does he so have the appearance of being there that life goes we're down in the root of the tree and every one of us gonna have those moments we're gonna have those times we're gonna have those seasons where look like we don't even have enough strength to praise the Living God hallelujah but this too will pass every season has a number ties and dates and all of a sudden he moves back around from falling and you think old fall is pretty bad all my leaves are gonna and all I look like as a dad tree Emily's coming spring is coming oh come on somebody you know I was telling somebody I was born down in in South Carolina and most of the time you find people down there that's pretty happy and you got a lot of smiles why because we hardly ever have a winter hallelujah but when winter pass from this day when went to pass y'all know what I'm saying right now y'all lookin at me because y'all hate the cold cold brings attitudes it's the truth coal brings attitude coals take away Amen to smiles from the face I'm just waiting to some of y'all down here you know but that's what it does it takes it takes to smile you very seldom see somebody walking through the snow no you got a frown on your face you can't stand the condition and some of us spiritually goes to that you know you cold you know you're not hot oh god but I'm telling you now god has a Danis bring for you even in the springtime the birds sing that the trees they got new leaves and they show off but if they didn't have life if that sound didn't go that wouldn't go down to the to the root of the tree guess what when spring would come there would be no resurrection hallelujah is that okay see I want you understand that unbelief is the perversion of faith you can t believe you can't even go nowhere without believing that you are true son and daughter of God who brought it who brought unbelief there was no such thing as unbelief until Lucifer introduced it to the angels in heaven and daily Lucifer came down and introduced it to E and then he introduced it to us now we fight with the negative and the positive it's something to believe God is that right oh it's true I heard the prophet of God says Amen if faith is Dmitri he said we will have more faith in doctors then we will in God word God said with your His stripes you are healed you know if we really believe that the Prophet God said you'll never come into the prayer line perfect faith don't need a prayer line is not the within until you get there but the point is God wants us to have perfect faith because in order to have perfect faith you must have perfect life even Paul when it came he meant to the Christian or to the spiritual aspect of things he said for we have been planted together in the likeness of his death and I was meditating on then I says Oh Lord there's a lot of suffering in his death hallelujah so you what do you mean you got to understand there was a lot of suffering leading up to his death before he died there was a lot of persecution there was a lot of our rejection hallelujah there was a lot of afflictions and then placed on him before he died hallelujah and you and I must go through the same kind of a thing there will be a lot of friction there'll be a lot of suffering there'll be a lot of things we must go through but are you willing take up your cross and follow me you know I'm trying to get people to the Holy Ghost the real Holy Ghost not just fake thing that is religion and make everybody feel like you got it and you can't even love your brother or love your enemy hallelujah I'm not talking I'm time of the real Holy Ghost I'm not talking about this religious thing that you and I have adopted within ourselves and think that's it but every tree must bring forth of his kind Jesus was the perfect example of what a man should be and what the tree of life is you got to break through the barriers did you know winter is good for some seeds because winter will freeze that seed and that seed a man will eventually explode because of the ice and the moisture in it and when that seed explode it releases life because that seed there's a life in that seed that will break through the barriers hallelujah and you and I must break through the barrier of laodicea did you know that Laodicea is a barrier it will haul you it would keep you it will imprison you and then to slop the nisshin and being dilatory and all of these things it'll make you feel at ease in Zion but you've got to break through this thing you cannot allow oh god don't you understand people that the Lord is soon to come I can't say that enough whether you shout whether you - whether you run up and down this aisle means nothing because what God is looking for is life you think about it even though Jacob I bet he had he was a seed and Jacob had to do what wrath so he had to break through the barrier of all unbelief he had to harass you with the angel he had already the blessing but he wasn't he wasn't he wasn't he wasn't satisfied with being blessed you blessed but that that's nothing to be satisfied with until you see the life of your blessing you must see the Christ in you that's what matters and when that angel came by way of his prayer he said I'm not gonna let you go to you bless me hallelujah like the brothers say God likes to inconvenience you and I'm gonna tell you something now prayer has become an inconvenience to a lot of believe us I don't have time to pray hallelujah I have time for Facebook I have time for the iPad I have time for texting but I don't have time to pray hallelujah exactly right we need to repent your soul is at stake did you know brother brems at that foolish Rogers and the wise version was made out of the same material but the wise version they prayed until they got a while and it's joy somebody help me here she shall be called a tree of life you know that's what he was at the beginning she was a tree of life but when they said the prophet of God said she became the tree of death the tree of good and evil came by way of Eve hallelujah she joined herself to the start but and now she became what the serpent was and she spread her gospel hallelujah oh come on somebody that's what she did everybody or everything every that yoked herself himself to her became what what she was what about Mary at Simon's house see when you won't Jesus when you get just the scent of the water when there's a smell because that lady though she wasn't at the well her name was Mary and she wanted what she wanted life property God said when she got the Simon's house she elbowed her way she knew Jesus was over there somewhere she looked and she saw from a distance and she knew she had to push through the crop why because there was water over there and she was fasting for life hallelujah that woman a man who had the easier blood sick sick had to go to every physician there was wasted all her money she wanted to be healed whoa but Jesus Christ is the real healing spring he is a wily man that can fix it just right for you though that woman was buckled with pain amen she didn't walk like this but she was buckle and to be honest with you to him was the only thing she could reach sometimes a menu buckled because of pain hallelujah but I want you to know that same Jesus still handler he's got a hamster she said if I could just but touch the humorless comet what was it she smelt her way through there was something on the inside that directed I because she was a tree and she reached out and touched it you understand me oh how bad it could be how bad but I want you to know that God is a world a word a water a refreshing is that right because that deal once it was wounded it knew it the only way that I can survive is to make sure I stayed by the river of water if I stayed where water is why because they were healing purchase before hallelujah there's healing righteous in this water no matter how bad the room is that water will make the blood clot if I could just get it with all those minerals in it all those vitamins in it inner inner to work you know why I get a whole it'll keep me alive but it's if I get away from the stream you wound it you heard it you get away from this dream you're getting away from the source of life the thing that can really heal you is in Jesus Christ God don't care no difference between man is that right yeah Lord each one of us says whether we are white brown black or yellow we could transfuse blood to each other and save others life by blood transfusion did you know the greatest illness there is is death death is a sickness it is contagious you're born in it the doctors find a kill anybody got a kill oh come on somebody see that's what I'm saying he Jesus is to kill but God brought the inoculation he brought the cure but if you don't take the medication you're going to die somebody help me but in one shot of Jesus can make a man who's dead for days get up rotted wood whines all in it but before he died he was inoculated he had Jesus in Jesus and already told him if you drink of this water you'll never thirst again is that right he said I am the Living Waters people say what were you saying once you a transfer remember I preach the message last week or two weeks ago about the dimension we come from we're not from here we're from another dimension hallelujah and if you're from another dimension and I'm talking about heaven you cannot die eternal life wasn't given to you when you was born a baby in this dimension eternal life was given to you before the foundation of the world hallelujah come on somebody but let me say it like this when it comes to life you and I must know by God's grace except you accept the Lord as your life you cannot live and you know we fail to see why Jesus died Jesus the seed of God had to die had he not died you and I would have never come forth somebody help me that's why even Adam could not leave circumstances the way they were Adam knew he needed e for reproduction though she said I have a word from the Lord that I must bring forth of my kind he couldn't just do it on his own hello that's why you have male and female that's why in God he has is male and female and that Leila female is sat there to produce to bring of its kind all trees are not deciding you must have a male tree and you must have a female tree hello did y'all know that because you got to understand the bees sweet honey bees they know how to transform transport the problem they know how to bring this Germanisation together right and that's what God is doing when God design you he design you as a feminine part of him but you'll never be able to produce your kind until you get with the male you gotta get with Jesus Oh help me Lord job says how many I want to live again it's sad how many of y'all want to live again am i I know I'm not the only one in here in Johnny's a few of us in history hallelujah you must understand he I love being a Christian being a Christian is not easy just like being a tree is not easy and when you are planted the ground as a tree guess what you can't move it doesn't matter how the seasons change you came whoo I look at some of those trees it meant when those snow storms are coming I don't know how do you feel but all I could imagine if that was me standing there and I can't get out of the cold because I'm planted but that cold is important for my growth to come I need that cold just like I need the fall I need it I need those season changes did you know and then even the vegetables need a cold snap they say when they get adjust a little tip a drop in the temperature it makes the vegetables better so wheat that's right brother and so you and I must understand because if you don't get the cold you'll never be sweet you need it every one of these seasons are given to us it meant so that we as a tree can bring forth much fruit hallelujah I don't know what trees say and I don't know tree language one of these days I will because Jesus spoke to a tree and he says you can too he said if you say to this tree be that plucked up and move over yonder he said that tree must obey you so ever did the tree has ears to hear that you don't know nothing about hallelujah is that all right did you know that even when you did you can still hear God huh I mean if you down to the naked bone you can see here God that right Ezekiel said kidneys typos milk right that's what God said to zekiel and he Zika said God thou know'st it he said speak to these bones bring some water their spiritual wallet to the bones the bones had the fortune ezekiel stood up did you know that even the wind in the sea obey Jesus that's what kind of tree he is and don't you know that when you have become a real tree of God born again of God you have the same abilities hello somebody did you not know that when the straw was raining and the sea was beating against the ship ah those disciple says Lord carest thou not that we perish wake up jesus oh jesus could've easily said you wake up you are awakened but you're spilling sleep did not I teach you that everything is something to you we need an Adam experience we need that experience that Adam had when he called it the way he wanted to in it had to obey ah because there was no unbelief yet Adam said to whatever he wanted to say tree you'll love it too tall get a little shorter what happened was nature had to obey Him is that right even the wind he says hon can you turn the fan down Alan says okay peace be still win he don't like it you you you putting too much on to tell him saying but he had to did you not know what kind of tree you are you are tree of life and this life that you have has the ability to even create is that right he's all when the screams come I don't know what I'm gonna do I tell you what what Jesus did and it wasn't even a squeeze his disciple says rod we have toiled all day and we don't have no fish Jesus said cast your net on the other side all my life he said didn't L say cast it where did those fish come from those disciples had already proved that they weren't there but the ability of creation is in the mouth of the believer Oh somebody help me here is this okay the Bible said the law of the Lord is perfect converting the soul the testimony of the Lord is sure making wise the simple the statue of the Lord are right rejoicing the heart the commandment of the Lord is pure enlightening the fear the Lord is clean enduring forever the judgment of the Lord are true and righteous altogether more to be desired are they than gold real water real nourishment which would you prefer a mansion you can have all the mansions you want on this earth it ain't up at a dump anyhow hallelujah every mansion in this earth is a dump compared to the one God has prepared for you ooh well I spit all our time and our energy trying to establish something here instead of excavating our souls in God huh the Bible said that those trees that didn't have no root they perished but the seed that had root I take it all the way back to God because my root is in God Jesus is the root and offspring of David I take it all the way back to God that's why I can today because my root is in God and that root is like a tree planted by the rivers of water is that right oh lord help us Jesus just give me a little something as that song saying to hold on to give me something and you know what when it comes to God God is willing to give it but he must first inconvenience you hello think about the gold rush that's what the Bible says right the Bible says amen ah that in that day the gold rush people was travelling afar off facing all kinds of unseen danger because in their minds they had that vision that they were going to strike gold once they used to come in the church if you're not coming looking for gold and the Bible said that the Word of God is more precious thing going that gold can purchase anything you want seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and God would at all these things to you is that right you and I must realize that if you seek God and get his righteousness everything else will be added what we need now is what Jesus did Jesus was such a fountain of life even his spit was a cure he told that by man he said how many God will let somebody else do that to you what am I brought a little bit of mud up in here a little bit of dirt and spit innings and mix it as they come and let me anoint you can you imagine what that blind man was thinking we need her no doubt the devil says Oh him/her what did he just do what did he just do some of you would have said I'm out of here but Jesus you know blind people have a good hearing he could even hear him mixing it what are you gonna do with that you know what but he was desperate would you when you're desperate you don't care about the inconvenience when you test but you don't care what God does what would do to make it right he was definite I want to see and Jesus took that spin on that clay and just press it into his eyes think about it people of God hallelujah he said now you go wash in the pool of Siloam there and the Bible says that man went and washed came back seeing one place he said he came back seeing seeing me and less trees and so when quite right Jesus did it again for watching get to the second wheel it is amazing how when you're desperate you don't care when the voice speaks when the Tree of Life speaks to you Amen you're not you're not gonna do like naman all right why do you want me to dip in the Jordan there's so many rivers out here that's much more cleaner and that little wise servant say yeah but your leopard you bout as dirty as that River hallelujah you might as well what harm is it gonna do you to go dip seven times like he's saying right but see when you really want God you do whatever the words say if you really the tree if there's a ceiling you that seed would say just at the scent of water just at the scent of life I'll spring forth you love the Lord now we come to a time I'm about ready to close there are so many people I say it like this the Prophet God's let's put it this way I heard him just the other day he said God told him just to stand on the corner stand in this place and and he was going to come by brother Ram said I had stood there a long time you know how we are God's say just go somewhere sit there stand there and I'll be there he never tells you at what time but you want to see how how long you gonna wait come on inconvenience when he says listen I know this is your plane you got a catch but you keep walking I think about that all the time because I catch planes and I just wonder sometimes what would I had done hopefully I would have followed the voice like he did and he didn't tell him you know it didn't sound like brother bang just went here to there he had a walk keep on walking keep on walking like God tell you when you in prayer keep on praying keep on praying well I don't create an hour and that's enough keep on praying I don't pray to another hour that's enough keep on praying where should I stop praying like Jacob when the daybreak just before the daybreak that's when he got his victory he prayed all night he wrestled all night that's what happens sometimes you're not a so we're a through it unbelief we're a so tired we're a sewage sick asleep we're a sir with thoughts but you keep rascally God I ain't going nowhere till you give me that Holy Ghost I ain't going nowhere until I see that I'm healed I'm not going nowhere till I see that I'm delivered does make sense what kind of tree are you the Bible said bitter and sweet water King come out the same fountain you can't be holy and unholy is that all right Yuma I must stand by God's grace if you don't stay by the water you're wither and die that's why Satan has us all bound up for the traditions and thinking of salvation say brother but you shouldn't say it like that well somebody got to say it oh come on folks I'm not directing this at anybody particular I'm talking to the whole church unanimous I'm talking to me if I get to a place where I can't feel his presence just a little bit something's wrong there's been a breach something is going wrong somewhere if I get down in prayer and I don't ever make a connection something's wrong because I've been told that Jesus keeps all his appointments but God can come down and prove its present to you if you're not right in your heart and you know what I'm saying I'm talking to us now we're living in a time with God is soon to come what if this earth starts shaking here in Des Moines what would be your first thought what would be your first thought Oh Lord I'm gonna die and if that be the truth where are you going where do you think you're going if your life is not holy everybody here ought to examine yourself I examine myself every day I've lived a Christian life for a long time I know what religion is and I'm not interested the only thing I want to see is Jesus in me you love the Lord when it gets to the place where reading your Bible is boring you are in trouble they are hidden David said how sweet are their words unto my taste when it gets to the place that the word of God is not sweet to you what brother Bergson ain't never been sweet where you have never gotten it you never eaten it because this word when it's you eat it is sweet yeah I love it you ever need a word from God and all of a sudden something come up on the pages uh-oh boom that brother know what I'm talking about right somehow you can sometimes taste it when the preachers preach and all of a sudden he hears something and that revelation strikes you it seemed like it even goes into your mouth am I the only one with that experience it's sweet let's tan at the end of the day at the Covenant coming of the season we're all fruit trees bear fruit some lemons some limes some apples some oranges it's going to bear whatever is it do you understand me whatever verse in you will bear will manifest itself that's why it's so important that we don't let the season pass us by can you imagine what it's going to be like at the end of the day when the rapture is already taking place some of us sit in our corners some of us wishing that we had done better some of us wishing that we have prayed how you gonna hear the voice of God and you don't have prayer life hello how are you going to hear the voice let me say it like this did you realize Amen that they fell asleep on Jesus he was a man God the master son of David to come pray with me for for an hour come pray I need your support I need your help come pray with me an hour I got something I got a breakthrough I've got to break through this barrier I got to break through this up I've got it I've got to break through it cuz my will is not to do it but I don't need my will I need the Father's will but I need you to help me pray with me three he brought perfection pray and each time he came close to them he found that they were sleep in the hour of temptation they fell asleep this is what I called this hour right now I called the spirit of time this period of time the hour of temptation and is no time to sleep but you know what he said go on and sleep now I did it by myself [Music] let me tell y'all people something don't you wait for no prayer meeting don't you wait for your neighbor your brother or your sister oh come pray with you pray for yourself prevail for yourself let them speak but you stay awake why they coming after you they coming after you the devil is coming and if you fall in the sleet guess what's going to happen when they come is going you coming up in awakened in a startled way you don't you're disoriented you don't even know where you are and where you're going you don't need that you need God I can't I can't cause nobody in here to love God you gotta look God yourself something and you got to make you love it I'm willing to love it I don't know about you but I'm a saver year long time but you know what I still won't bore God I still can use bow of him are your perfect brother looks no not within myself but one thing for certain I know the tree that's growing in me that is it's perfect one day is going to overrule the sole flesh it's going to be a perfect tree and I'll be a branch or I'll be an offspring of the Tree of Life which will make me a tree is that right so I want you to understand amen Oh none but the righteous holy and all amen we're the ones who will embrace heaven but you think it's gonna be easy as you want it easy you want heaven to come by you by way of religion and it won't or if I just look right if I dress right if I come to church right if I do these things praise God I'm I'm gonna go sweep it through the city no you won't because they are more they're more religious people in this world than you and I are they live it they they do do everything right but listen the Bible told Nicodemus except you're born again except you're born again you cannot even enter or even understand the key let's pray father we come before you as humbly as we know how we thank you for your goodness we thank you for your grace Lord you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves we thank you for being all in all without you Jesus we would have nothing we pray this morning differently subject but may the people see spiritually what I was working with Lord until identity comes and we know who we are where we came from and where we go we'll never be able to produce what you would have us to produce Jesus break and destroy the yokes of the enemy you hear the thoughts of the people you see their hearts merciful people merciful Lord these are yours it was your blood shed for them Lord and for us be merciful to us Lord God have mercy if the people could just see and understand where they're standing lord I would say have mercy upon snow we want to move far away from having a name that we're living and we're dead [Music] only you know who we are give us grace Lord Jesus Christ's name we pray go by a heavy burden be me the load of guilt and shame then the hell of G and now I am no longer this he touched [Music] hello good sha that flood my soul something happen and now I know just so you know those of us who couldn't say amen and hallelujah glory to God that it is a spirit that keeps you from doing it because when you go out there you're gonna get loud you're gonna talk you're gonna fellowship and all of a sudden the tiredness and the sleep is gone he saying comes to church and he comes to keep you from entering in am I right or wrong mr. truth so that you'll know the next time you go to church and you see that all of a sudden you you all right until you get here then all of a sudden things start happening you you you're tired and weary and sleepy then you understand that's the spirit and you got an elbow your way into the presence of God I know I'm right so we must realize amen that we come to fight we come to battle and if you didn't get anything out of service this morning it's not my fault it's yours just a I with one blood-red table wash it for me and thou bid me come to the Olin Oh God come let's say neck verse again just ass and I blood wash it for me and then now it's me come

will be done in Jesus Christ's name we pray [Music]
