[43:50] Lord every name
[44:00] unless you come by our way Lord
[44:07] [Music]
[44:12] amen amen if you have your Bibles we're
[44:15] going to look back we'll be available
[44:18] one verse 1.
[44:24] like to speak to you again on the word
[44:25] we bring forth after his Kind part two
[44:28] of us
[44:34] a little bit further this evening
[44:41] refined here as it says in the beginning
[44:42] was the word and the Word was with God
[44:44] and the Word was God
[44:50] the same was in the beginning with God
[44:53] in verse 14
[44:56] and the Word was made flesh and dwell to
[44:58] mangas
[45:01] and we beheld his glory the glory as the
[45:04] only begotten of the father full of
[45:06] grace
[45:10] God bless you you can have your seats as
[45:12] well
[45:14] we also look in Genesis
[45:17] we fight here in Genesis 1 26. don't
[45:20] Genesis
[45:22] and God said let us make man in our
[45:24] image and after our likeness
[45:29] and notice what he says
[45:32] let them have dominion
[45:35] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[45:38] over the fall of the air sure
[45:42] over the cattle and over to all the
[45:44] Earth
[45:47] and over every creeping thing that
[45:49] creepeth upon the Earth
[45:52] so God created man to rule
[45:56] because Man was created in the image of
[45:59] God
[46:00] and we find in verse 27 God created man
[46:04] in his own image
[46:08] in the image of God created he him male
[46:11] and female created he them
[46:29] so we look here and we find again God in
[46:32] the aspect of creation
[46:35] so this first man was a spirit man Allah
[46:41] we found in Genesis 2 and verse 7.
[46:45] and the Lord God formed man of the Dust
[46:48] of the earth
[46:51] and he breathed into his nostrils the
[46:54] breath of life
[46:56] and now that Spirit Man
[46:59] became a living Soul
[47:04] now that Spirit man
[47:07] is now becoming a living Soul
[47:12] so God created all history
[47:22] and all the creatures were formed yet
[47:27] God saved the best for last
[47:31] see God had in the back part of his mind
[47:35] that he wanted something to resemble him
[47:39] he wanted somebody that would love him
[47:43] he wanted someone that will reciprocate

[1:14:55] nation of that's like manifestation
[1:14:58] visible to do glory to God let's look at

[1:15:03] don't know
[1:15:05] this is an electrician Church age
[1:15:07] doesn't miss actually at least
[1:15:10] how could God be created if he's a
[1:15:13] Spirit come on
[1:15:16] how could it be he's Eternal
[1:15:21] he never was created
[1:15:23] he never will be created
[1:15:26] because he was God at the beginning
[1:15:29] but he that is the beginning of the
[1:15:32] creation of God
[1:15:36] was Jesus Christ when he was made
[1:15:39] manifested
[1:15:41] manifest when God lived in him
[1:15:45] he is God's creation
[1:15:48] all the first and the last
[1:15:51] the amen the beginning of the creation
[1:15:57] [Applause]
[1:16:02] [Music]
[1:16:09] [Applause]
[1:16:18] the beginning of the creation of God
[1:16:23] that is who the Lord Jesus says he is
[1:16:28] but those words don't mean exactly as
[1:16:31] they sound too
[1:16:34] significations
[1:16:37] just take it in the way that they sound
[1:16:39] has made some people just
[1:16:41] [Applause]
[1:16:42] significations
[1:16:44] get the idea that Jesus was the first
[1:16:46] creation
[1:16:51] the creation of God
[1:16:53] making him lower than the godhead
[1:16:59] [Music]
[1:17:01] created all the rest of the universe
[1:17:06] whatsoever it contains
[1:17:08] he said but that's not right
[1:17:12] he says you know that that Lana with the
[1:17:14] rest of the Bible
[1:17:46] all things were made by him or without
[1:17:48] him was not anything made that was made
[1:17:53] he is the one that we find in Genesis 1
[1:17:56] 1.
[1:17:59] in the beginning God created the heavens
[1:18:02] and the Earth
[1:18:11] for in six days the Lord made the Heaven
[1:18:13] and the Earth
[1:18:36] surely we can see what those words mean
[1:18:39] now hello
[1:18:43] to have any other interpretation will
[1:18:45] mean that God created God foreign
[1:19:15] revealing who he is in this age
[1:19:20] don't sit down and he calls himself
[1:19:28] this is another creation
[1:19:32] he said this has to do with the church
[1:19:35] says
[1:19:37] this is a special designation of himself
[1:19:42] he is the creator of that church
[1:19:47] oh I love this next word I don't Jam
[1:19:49] says the Heavenly bridegroom
[1:19:53] Celeste created his own bride Ave

[1:20:52] he came down and created in the Virgin
[1:20:54] yeah
[1:20:57] the cells from which his body was born
[1:21:02] so we finally Colossians 1 18.
[1:21:07] he is the head of the body
[1:21:10] the church who is the beginning the
[1:21:13] firstborn of the Dead
[1:21:17] that in all things he might have the
[1:21:20] preeminence
[1:21:22] second Corinthians 5 and verse 17.
[1:21:28] therefore If any man is in Christ
[1:21:31] If any man is in Christ
[1:21:34] he is a new creation
[1:21:39] all things are passed away
[1:21:43] all those past habits
[1:21:47] all those past failures
[1:21:54] oh all the this discouragement

[1:22:52] distinct from the old one

[1:23:34] and he is the first of that creation
[1:23:38] Oh my he is God created in the form of
[1:23:42] man either I formed the norm and notice
[1:23:45] and now by his Spirit
[1:23:48] he is creating many sons unto himself
[1:23:54] God the Creator
[1:23:57] created himself
[1:24:00] remember a part of his creation

[1:25:05] creation of God because God is not a

[1:30:05] because the word is
[1:30:08] and if you are the words
[1:30:14] she says you'll be disagreeing with
[1:30:16] yourself
[1:30:19] you'll be defeating your own purpose
[1:30:25] we believe the words
[1:30:28] and because we believe the world
[1:30:31] then the attributes of the father
[1:30:35] begin to flow out in our lives
[1:30:42] since my daughter Rebecca here hello
[1:30:46] she doesn't look like me or something
[1:30:49] like that she's pretty and they've been
[1:30:51] and y'all say Amen it was that it's your
[1:30:53] amen yeah it's very beautiful
[1:30:56] blonde hair and blue eyes
[1:30:59] blonde but she acts a lot like her daddy
[1:31:04] she has some fire in her like her dad
[1:31:07] and uh the the food comes on pair
[1:31:09] so you look at her you may not know that
[1:31:11] she's my daughter
[1:31:14] but the attributes that are inside of me
[1:31:19] begin to flow out in her body
[1:31:23] begin to live out in her life
[1:31:26] and then you can tie us together
[1:31:30] and then you know that she's my dog
[1:31:34] oh what about the heaven
[1:31:38] oh you may not look like him now
[1:32:08] you know
[1:32:10] notice
[1:32:12] you can't make yourself different from
[1:32:14] what God intended you to me
[1:32:20] see I wouldn't mind
[1:32:23] problem being tall
[1:32:26] problem
[1:32:29] dark and handsome
[1:32:33] um
[1:32:37] hey boo
[1:32:39] but I'm short just be cool cute you just
[1:32:44] read uh
[1:32:48] yeah but I'm what God created
[1:32:51] how he created
[1:32:54] so you can't add anything to your
[1:32:57] stature
[1:32:59] Brother Rich God created you first Jews
[1:33:03] that create perfect the way that you are
[1:33:07] the Bible says you're fearfully and
[1:33:10] wonderfully made
[1:33:13] and many times we look in the mirror
[1:33:17] and we get mad at what we see it means
[1:33:27] this is the only way to change
[1:33:31] insurance
[1:33:42] so you can't make yourself something
[1:33:45] that you're not alone
[1:33:48] you can't make yourself prize
[1:33:52] you're not bride but you're choosing
[1:33:55] that's when that's right
[1:34:00] you're proud by his elections
[1:34:04] notice we find an Ephesians
[1:34:08] the Bible says
[1:34:13] you were chosen in God
[1:34:17] you were chosen in Christ
[1:34:20] and because you were chosen
[1:34:23] that's your predestination
[1:34:27] God can't separate you you're in the
[1:34:30] prepared
[1:34:33] say hallelujah
[1:34:36] notice
[1:34:40] God saw your shortcomings sure every
[1:34:42] conversation
[1:34:45] and he looked all over the world
[1:34:50] [Applause]
[1:35:14] to do
[1:35:15] God don't take a rose petalum says I
[1:35:18] choose them I choose them not I choose
[1:35:20] you not we used to do the perfect deal
[1:35:22] because it was right here
[1:35:24] she loves me she loves me not and ma'am
[1:35:28] get down to the last pedal news
[1:35:31] she loves me not uh
[1:35:35] no God loves you no Jerusalem and God
[1:35:38] chose you it dribbles it moves that's
[1:35:40] right oh and you're gonna display the
[1:35:43] very acts of God it was that immunity
[1:35:48] come on that's why you can overcome
[1:35:51] that's why you can be an overcomer
[1:35:55] cause you were predest
[1:36:13] the same way men choose their Brides
[1:36:16] today
[1:36:19] see the bride doesn't simply decide who
[1:36:22] she's gonna marry hello
[1:36:25] but no the groom decides
[1:36:29] John 15 and verse 16.
[1:36:34] you have not chosen me but I have chosen
[1:36:37] um
[1:36:39] see the chosen of the bride was purposed
[1:36:42] in himself
[1:36:44] [Music]
[1:36:46] and brother Brown tells us
[1:36:48] the heart purpose the
[1:36:52] Eternal purpose of God
[1:36:55] was to take a bride of his own Jews
[1:37:00] and that purpose was in himself it's
[1:37:04] reputation
[1:37:05] and being Eternal
[1:37:08] it was decree before the foundation of
[1:37:10] the world
[1:37:12] before there was ever a speck of star in
[1:37:15] us
[1:37:17] but for God was ever an object of
[1:37:19] adoration
[1:37:22] the bride was already in the Bible
[1:37:27] Church when you're having a bad day
[1:37:33] where you were at
[1:37:37] realize where you come from
[1:37:40] oh it'll make that day a lot better
[1:37:44] um
[1:38:17] the real you is eternal
[1:38:23] [Applause]
[1:39:12] that's why you're
[1:39:15] [Music]
[1:39:19] a Believer today
[1:39:30] [Applause]
[1:39:51] [Applause]
[1:40:20] a land he doesn't choose a a disfigured
[1:40:24] bride
[1:40:26] but she's perfect
[1:40:31] beautiful
[1:40:33] in all her ways
[1:40:35] oh my come on Brad
[1:40:40] look away from the mirror oh my God
[1:40:44] look at your Perfection
[1:40:46] this is the real you right here
[1:40:49] when you line up with this right now
[1:40:53] you're lining up with the Real views
[1:40:59] Oh Glory to God
[1:41:02] so we're predestinated unto a doctor
[1:41:05] hello
[1:41:08] and each and every one of us here
[1:41:10] tonight
[1:41:12] are on free moral ages
[1:41:19] so
[1:41:21] God do not twist anybody's arm to be
[1:41:24] here tonight
[1:42:04] [Music]
[1:42:08] this is not our Destiny church
[1:42:11] this life is not our destination
[1:42:14] we're only passing through
[1:42:17] oh but we're headed back to our
[1:42:20] destination
[1:42:23] because we were chosen
[1:42:27] because he had foreknowledge of it
[1:42:38] [Applause]
[1:42:40] to be conformed Into His Image
[1:42:44] it takes us right back to Genesis
[1:42:49] the spoken word is
[1:42:55] we are predestinated
[1:42:58] to be conformed I had to confirm it in
[1:43:02] His image
[1:43:04] oh praise God
[1:43:07] praise the Lord His Image you saw him
[1:43:11] so there's people today
[1:43:15] I don't believe in predestination
[1:43:18] it makes God seem unfair
[1:43:23] so that row right there is my family
[1:43:27] and when I leave tomorrow
[1:43:31] I'm taking my family with me
[1:43:34] so don't get mad because you're not
[1:43:37] invited to come hello
[1:43:40] come on you're not part of my family
[1:43:45] you're not even gonna think about it
[1:43:47] that I didn't invite you man
[1:43:50] and that's the same way we go
[1:43:54] because we're his family
[1:43:57] he's gonna invite us to come
[1:44:01] and it's not for everybody it's in the
[1:44:03] purple but all that the father has given
[1:44:11] [Music]
[1:44:35] that word knowledge that word to no
[1:44:38] means to have a relationships
[1:44:43] you had a relationship in the mind of
[1:44:46] God
[1:44:48] and it was before the foundation
[1:44:53] chosen in him
[1:44:55] and see God knows your heart
[1:44:59] and brother Brown would tell us
[1:45:02] that he had to sing Christ
[1:45:05] he had to send Christ he had
[1:45:09] to redeem those thoughts he had to send
[1:45:13] Christ to redeem those thoughts
[1:45:21] so that's why we're here
[1:45:24] because we've been redeemed
[1:45:26] because we were thoughts
[1:45:29] because we are the word that is coming
[1:45:31] foreign
[1:46:04] [Music]
[1:46:11] foreign
[1:47:11] to do stands in his election
[1:47:15] is
[1:47:21] but Jacob
[1:47:23] have Allah see God knew hello
[1:47:39] would desire the birthright
[1:47:43] um
[1:47:52] sorry to see in church age
[1:47:57] well the BAM says
[1:48:00] he said first of all we know most is
[1:48:02] surely
[1:48:04] that the purpose of God stands in
[1:48:07] elections
[1:48:11] and as we said earlier
[1:48:14] you are the heart purpose of God the
[1:48:20] Eternal purpose of God
[1:48:23] and that stands not in your election but
[1:48:27] it is
[1:48:35] purpose to bring forth the people
[1:49:14] foreign man oh I'm gonna say it again
[1:49:17] and connect with you
[1:49:19] come in the condemnation
[1:49:24] she can never be in judgment
[1:49:28] because
[1:49:35] oh sons of God
[1:49:38] Daughters of God
[1:49:40] therefore there now is no condemnation
[1:49:45] for them to walk in the spirit
[1:49:51] so the word of God
[1:49:54] is bringing forth
