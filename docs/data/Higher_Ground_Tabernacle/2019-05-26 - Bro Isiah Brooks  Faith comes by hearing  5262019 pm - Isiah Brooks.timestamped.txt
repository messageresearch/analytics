[0:00] [Music]
[0:04] I'll try by God's grace to finish the
[0:08] message we started this morning we
[0:12] talked about faith come by hearing and
[0:19] we talked about the prayers of Jesus
[0:21] being answered if anybody can get a
[0:26] prayer through I believe the Lord has
[0:29] gotten a prayer through as we stand
[0:37] we're just going to read Romans 5 and 9
[0:43] and then we'll read Romans 8:30 which
[0:48] offered me your scriptures glad to see
[0:51] our brothers up I was just telling the
[0:54] church this morning I was gonna have to
[0:56] hire a musician from down there I don't
[1:01] know how it's gonna work with God but I
[1:03] thought man they got more than enough so
[1:07] we'll see how the Lord works amen I
[1:08] don't know whether that's possible or
[1:12] not but you know we we'd love to see him
[1:15] come up whenever they do Romans five and
[1:19] nine so that we'll understand that we
[1:24] are saved by his life not by yours by
[1:31] his life it's his life we are to make
[1:35] manifests Romans 5:9 says but much but
[1:40] much more than being now justified by
[1:45] his blood we shall be saved from wrath
[1:48] through him for if when we were enemies
[1:51] we were reconciled to God by the death
[1:54] of his son much more being reconciled we
[1:58] shall be saved by his life and not only
[2:03] so but we also joy in God through our
[2:06] Lord Jesus Christ by who we have now
[2:10] received the atonement Romans 8 and 30
[2:18] we'll read all the way down to the 33rd
[2:20] verse moreover whom he did predestinate
[2:24] them he also called and whom he called
[2:28] them he also justified and whom he
[2:32] justified them he also glorified what
[2:37] shall we say then to these things if God
[2:41] be for us who can be against us he that
[2:45] spared not his own son but delivered him
[2:48] up for us all how shall we not with him
[2:52] also freely give us all things who shall
[2:56] lay in a charge or anything to the
[2:58] charge of God's elect it is God that
[3:02] justify it let us pray
[3:04] father God we come before you we thank
[3:07] you for your grace and your mercy we
[3:09] thank you for being so good to us Lord
[3:12] God we pray that you give us grace to
[3:14] move completely out of your way and we
[3:17] pray father that you break and destroy
[3:19] the yoke to the enemy anoint your
[3:21] service server tonight
[3:23] anoint the ears and hearts of those who
[3:25] have come to receive that when the word
[3:28] of God comes Lord will be able to bring
[3:30] forth the manifestation of a hundredfold
[3:33] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you
[3:37] may be seated
[3:42] when we talk about a hundredfold some
[3:44] time we get a little discouraged because
[3:47] your hundredfold might be a thirty your
[3:51] hundredfold might be a sixty
[3:53] he said he gives some 30 some 60 and
[3:56] some 100 but whatever it is is that it's
[4:02] your full potential
[4:03] those whoever he's ordained to bring
[4:06] forth or 30 that's all you're gonna be
[4:08] able to bring forth and those who are
[4:10] deign to bring forth 60 that's all
[4:13] you'll be able to bring forth and those
[4:14] who God ordained to bring forth a
[4:16] hundred will but should I get jealous
[4:19] over 30 or 60 or if I'm a third should I
[4:23] get jealous of a sixty or a hundred no
[4:26] it's all I'm supposed to bring forth
[4:30] you and I ought to be thankful by God's
[4:32] grace that God has called us to this
[4:35] marvelous light
[4:37] we read in Jeremiah this morning I'm
[4:39] just gonna recap a little bit God said
[4:42] he hadn't expected in for us and he
[4:45] wanted us to know Amen that if we seek
[4:48] Him and seek him he said you and I will
[4:51] find him when we should search for him
[4:54] with all of our hearts and so I believe
[4:57] with all of my heart that God has placed
[4:59] that in us I said this morning that we
[5:02] are the call of God in other words God
[5:05] called us we didn't call God God chose
[5:09] us we didn't choose God
[5:12] so therefore God makes no mistakes when
[5:15] it's called with his call he makes no
[5:17] mistake it was so funny this morning in
[5:20] mind with the interpreter I I thought I
[5:22] had a French speaking interpreter and I
[5:25] thought about you speaking Swahili and I
[5:29] was wondering why some of the rich
[5:30] people were looking all strange and I
[5:33] had no idea but I thank God a man
[5:36] somebody got something this morning but
[5:44] by the grace of God Amen we made it
[5:47] through this morning and I trust by
[5:48] God's grace that God will anoint us we
[5:52] talked about the rejection we said by
[5:55] God's grace that Jesus Christ has
[5:57] provided a way for us we know it has
[6:00] always been Satan's tool to invent
[6:04] something beside the way of God and to
[6:08] get people to believe in it and we
[6:11] showed by God's grace that there's only
[6:13] one provided way as it was in the book
[6:17] of Genesis Cain and Abel made a
[6:20] sacrifice unto the Lord Abel's sacrifice
[6:23] was accepted because it was God's
[6:26] provided way and we showed that Cain
[6:29] built a system he watched Abel and no
[6:34] doubt he thought that Abel's sacrifice
[6:36] was a disgusting one Amen nobody likes
[6:41] to shout and cry and scream and holla
[6:43] and praise God
[6:44] anymore they figured that it's just not
[6:47] necessary but that is God's chosen way
[6:52] that the people of God will enjoy his
[6:55] presence and they would empty out and
[6:58] forget about themselves and came this in
[7:02] disgust thought he could build a system
[7:05] that God would accept but outside of
[7:09] Jesus Christ there is no other way to be
[7:13] saved
[7:14] jesus himself declared that I am the way
[7:17] the truth and the life if any man coming
[7:21] to me he hid come unto me he must first
[7:23] come by me I am the door is that right
[7:26] we showed by God's grace that what the
[7:29] problem he is with the people of God
[7:31] today is that we have these barriers of
[7:35] unbelief and I show by God's grace house
[7:38] sham God who was a judge of his time
[7:41] Amen slew over six hundred Philistine
[7:44] men with an ox gored a stick that you
[7:50] normally punches the ox in them and to
[7:54] make it go forward and he took that out
[7:56] scored and he literally destroyed six
[8:00] hundred Philistines that took faith and
[8:04] you and I must understand that we're not
[8:08] here to live off of our own faith there
[8:11] is a mental faith there's a faith that
[8:13] you're born with it comes with the
[8:16] territory but there is a supernatural
[8:19] faith and that's why the Bible said the
[8:22] just shall live by his faith you and I
[8:25] will fail every time because we as as as
[8:30] creatures of time we always have our ups
[8:33] and our downs but faith in God if God's
[8:36] faith is steady his steadfast is what we
[8:41] call the Shekinah glory it is his faith
[8:45] and sham God amen in the Old Testament
[8:48] was able enough to have faith in God see
[8:52] the Bible said he that cometh to God
[8:54] must first believed that he is God and
[8:56] that he has a reward
[8:58] of them that diligently you and I are
[9:01] being tested by faith hello Sumati and
[9:05] Brennan said faith and love are twins if
[9:09] you have faith you have love if you have
[9:13] love you have faith amen because you got
[9:16] to realize they are all in the same seed
[9:21] love is in the seed of God faith is in
[9:24] the seed of God but it takes watering it
[9:28] takes thing in the presence of the Sun
[9:31] in order for these virtues in order for
[9:34] this character
[9:35] amen to push his way out of you is that
[9:38] right
[9:39] the probably God said if we drink and
[9:41] drink and drink and drink he said the
[9:43] Holy Ghost will push out push out push
[9:45] out push out that's right is nothing we
[9:49] do the only thing we do is drinking it
[9:51] in you understand me all you do is stay
[9:55] in the presence of God and you will crow
[9:58] it ain't is ands or buts about it the
[10:02] reason why we don't grow or mature the
[10:05] way we should be maturing is because we
[10:07] failed to stay in the presence of God in
[10:11] the presence of God God the by said is
[10:14] fullness of joy is that right and at his
[10:18] right hand is pleasures forevermore so
[10:22] when you are in the presence of God you
[10:24] do not get bored oh I didn't finish like
[10:32] I wanted to finish this morning but
[10:33] hopefully I'll be able to see to do it
[10:35] this evening
[10:35] I'm gonna read this quote by God's grace
[10:38] coming from the message amen God's
[10:41] Commission commissioning Moses this is
[10:44] important I didn't read it all but I'll
[10:46] try my best to go through it you see God
[10:50] is good to us isn't he hmm let me back
[10:54] it up here sorry I read the wrong quote
[11:00] I was reading the wrong cool move
[11:03] further down you love the Lord
[11:09] here it is I ended up with it so we make
[11:13] mistakes but you mustn't look at that
[11:18] it's not your mistakes because you're
[11:22] always going to have them Superman I can
[11:29] say like that because we don't have no
[11:30] sisters tonight but we feel we feel like
[11:35] because of our mistakes when I'm not
[11:37] maturing about you you're mistaken
[11:40] the only man that did not make a mistake
[11:43] was Christ himself Paul made a mistake
[11:47] that right all um did all of them did
[11:51] but it wasn't the mistakes but you see
[11:55] it's because you're always going to have
[11:59] him but you see it's following his rules
[12:02] following what he said do stumble and
[12:06] falling doesn't have one thing to do
[12:08] with it a great true servant if he
[12:11] stumble if he gets he'll get up again if
[12:14] he wobbles God pulls him right back in
[12:17] the path as long as he's in the path of
[12:21] duty but if he's off the path of duty
[12:23] God's not obligated to him but as long
[12:27] as he's in the path of duty God is
[12:30] obligated to him knowing that he's just
[12:34] a man or woman he's obligated to that
[12:37] person as long as they're in the path of
[12:40] duty and that's what it is sometimes we
[12:43] think God don't know that we're flesh
[12:44] and blood he's the one that made you now
[12:49] the church is engaged to Christ for the
[12:53] wedding the wedding has never been
[12:56] performed yet it will be at the wedding
[12:58] supper of the Lamb so we see that the
[13:01] church is now engaged like a man engaged
[13:04] to his wife what does he do while
[13:07] they're engaged
[13:08] he's just be storing all kinds of things
[13:11] sending her presence making her feel
[13:14] good well that's what Christ is doing to
[13:17] his church he's sending us gifts of the
[13:19] Spirit how could we be engaged the
[13:22] and when you when you're denying these
[13:24] gifts exist it's the very love tokens is
[13:28] God's token to the church jesus said so
[13:31] these signs shall follow them that
[13:34] believe now keep those things in mind
[13:37] the church must believe every word every
[13:41] promise every I order and claim it for
[13:44] themselves and exercise themselves in it
[13:51] you know what exercise it means when
[13:54] certain things come your way you work it
[13:58] you work with it you push your faith
[14:03] hallelujah amen exercise you know you're
[14:06] doing push-ups they're not easy
[14:08] hallelujah but you're working on
[14:10] something to build more muscles that
[14:12] right that's how it is with God when
[14:15] trials comes and tests come you work it
[14:19] you keep saying I am more than a
[14:22] conquerer hallelujah through clothes is
[14:25] that right he's made me thus this this
[14:28] stone will not be victorious over me
[14:33] hallelujah it will not get the victory
[14:36] imma keep pressing I'm gonna keep moving
[14:38] that's exercising why because God is
[14:43] with me get you will imagine if Sam God
[14:46] kills 600 men do you ever think he got
[14:50] tired oh yes he did he had to but every
[14:57] moment he that Tod feeling come on here
[14:59] come the Holy Ghost the anointing of God
[15:03] was on him so much amen
[15:04] he didn't have time to feel tired but no
[15:07] doubt that was there he's a physical man
[15:13] you understand how many times you and I
[15:16] have been under the anointing and
[15:17] they're nodding it's so heavy on you you
[15:20] keep pushing you keep pushing now the
[15:23] moment a moment of split moment of
[15:26] tiredness come on you but that anointing
[15:28] is so great it keeps you moving
[15:32] hmm now
[15:35] Church is engaged to Christ for the
[15:38] wedding let me drop down alright
[15:45] so now those things in mind keep them in
[15:47] mind the church must believe every word
[15:49] every promise every high order claim it
[15:52] for themselves and exercise themselves
[15:54] in it if I was engaged to a girl and I
[15:58] was a single man I sent her some things
[16:00] an engagement ring and she wouldn't wear
[16:03] it then that shows she doesn't believe
[16:06] me she doesn't want to be my bride and
[16:10] if guys says it's Church the gifts that
[16:13] he promised and they refused him and say
[16:16] they're not so they don't want to be the
[16:18] Bride of Christ y'all understand me they
[16:22] I spouse to some other lover and not the
[16:25] Christ the bridegroom
[16:27] so the real church keep the promise and
[16:30] keeps all and accept the gifts that God
[16:33] sends them now you say what do you mean
[16:36] I'm saying cutting through all the
[16:38] unbelief
[16:39] we have people Amen in this message who
[16:41] said we don't need that anymore we are
[16:44] beyond that now but how can you be a lot
[16:48] beyond that if that's what God sent you
[16:51] 5 identification of a true church you
[16:55] must every church must have gifts in
[16:58] there y'all understand me we could never
[17:03] be beyond because when Rebecca met Isaac
[17:05] she wore everything Isaac sent to her
[17:11] and in order for us to meet Christ we
[17:15] must have every stone every stone in
[17:20] that in that that help headband
[17:23] hallelujah if one stone is missing we
[17:26] will be labeled as a prostitute so we
[17:31] would say I'm trying to tell you it's
[17:33] not what the preachers say is what the
[17:35] Prophet says so you can understand if
[17:39] the preacher is preaching the world
[17:40] that's not agreeable to what he said you
[17:43] don't believe the preacher you believe
[17:45] what he said
[17:48] you understand me if I preach something
[17:51] that's not agreeable with the word of
[17:53] the hour today you have no you do not
[17:56] have to receive it why because you I'm
[18:01] not the interpreter God has sent us the
[18:05] interpreter I'm just trying to resound
[18:08] what he sounded Lord of God it got good
[18:12] now the first human being he said listen
[18:15] now so we keep that in mind and the
[18:19] church says his gifts and God says his
[18:20] gift and empty doesn't that means she's
[18:23] exposed to some other lover now the
[18:25] first human being fellowship themselves
[18:27] from being a scuse me this fellowship
[18:30] themselves from believing God by
[18:33] believing his word and listening to a
[18:35] lie of the devil now that's the first
[18:39] thing that this fellowship his wonderful
[18:41] Union out of an e in a position to never
[18:45] not never die in a position to never be
[18:48] old to never be sick to never have a
[18:51] worry you said I sure wish I could be
[18:54] like that he said I Got News for you
[18:56] you're in that same position God places
[19:00] that to every creature on earth in the
[19:02] same position you understand me so we
[19:07] can't go back and said well I wish they
[19:10] would have done it better no you
[19:12] wouldn't have done it no better than
[19:13] they did why because it was all a plan
[19:16] of God
[19:17] now as sinners we have a choice we that
[19:20] we make to be either remain a sinner or
[19:23] a saint is that all right we have a sure
[19:28] foundation as I said this morning
[19:31] faith is not feeling oh I just feel it
[19:34] you don't feel faith faith is a
[19:36] dimensional thing that goes down to the
[19:39] soul and in the soul is either faith or
[19:42] unbelief hallelujah if you're waiting to
[19:45] feel it you don't have it why because
[19:49] faith is a substance faith is just as
[19:52] real as this tambourine I can explain
[19:55] this but faith cannot be explained you
[19:58] got it you don't know how I got it but
[20:01] you got it
[20:02] and the Bible tells that that faith is a
[20:04] gift so when God gives you this gift
[20:07] hold on to it it doesn't matter if no
[20:10] one else believe you know you got it
[20:13] y'all hear me like I said this morning
[20:16] when God calls you nobody can hear that
[20:20] call for you
[20:21] I don't care everybody standing next to
[20:24] you when God calls you only you can hear
[20:27] the call and therefore because you can
[20:31] hear the call you respond hmm think
[20:35] about it
[20:36] we here we are the bride of Jesus Christ
[20:39] we've got more power we got more
[20:42] authority and we got more assurity than
[20:46] any age ever we look like it's Samson
[20:50] and we say what a great man of God well
[20:53] you are in a greater position than
[20:55] Samson huh but the Bible tells me that
[20:59] Sampson with the jaw jawbone of an ass
[21:03] through a thousand Philistines
[21:08] hallelujah and in shâm god only slew 600
[21:13] but the Bible tells us that one man one
[21:17] converted man one true soldier of God
[21:20] who can put a thousand to flight
[21:23] hey we look at men at the demons that
[21:26] were loosed out of the river Euphrates
[21:28] amen under under the world wall-to-wall
[21:31] excuse me and and we say oh my God look
[21:34] at all these demons but think about it
[21:36] you can put ten thousands of light so
[21:43] really they're not as great as they
[21:44] think they are think about it you said
[21:50] what do you mean let's take for example
[21:52] wormwood one wood is one angel but one
[21:58] would had the authority and the ability
[22:01] to cause the ant alluvion flood one
[22:05] angel through the world into chaos
[22:11] hello is that right he did it
[22:15] he moved the scientists in a way that
[22:18] they did it but it was wormwood the
[22:20] spirit behind the ant eluvian flood
[22:27] think about it brother madam said when
[22:30] Jesus was on the cross all he had to do
[22:33] was move one finger one finger and it
[22:39] would have been over now the same power
[22:43] in Jesus is now in us but it takes faith
[22:49] to cut through all of this unbelief and
[22:53] you said oh the unbelievers in the world
[22:55] know we have intellectual Giants in this
[22:59] message that have took taken away the
[23:02] very power and the authority of the
[23:04] world away from us in such a subtle way
[23:10] they tell us when we mature we don't
[23:14] need God in that way yet when we get
[23:18] sick many of them are running to the
[23:21] hospital many of them are seeking out
[23:23] doctors hello and I ain't God I don't
[23:26] have anything against doctors but show
[23:30] me in the New Testament where they ran
[23:32] to the doctors oh you know what they did
[23:36] they prayed when Peter James and John
[23:39] were thrown into prison what did they do
[23:41] they pray they didn't even go get a
[23:43] lawyer hallelujah they prayed and God
[23:47] answered their prayer he's the same
[23:50] yesterday today and forever holiday but
[23:54] we've got to get rid of his reasoning we
[23:56] got to get rid of all this dust there's
[23:59] darkness that saved in his place among
[24:01] us we've got to get back to the original
[24:04] the just shall live by his faith like I
[24:08] said it's not your faith you living by
[24:10] is his faith and his fate is the Holy
[24:14] Ghost his faith is God because by faith
[24:19] see we look at by faith like it's a
[24:22] thing no no no but faith is a person in
[24:25] the beginning God created hallelujah
[24:30] so by faith faith itself is a person and
[24:33] that person is Jesus Christ I'm not
[24:36] talking about the stuff you're born with
[24:38] at the first I'm calm at the second
[24:40] birth brings about a supernatural faith
[24:43] because it is God
[24:46] and we must work with it we got to
[24:50] exercise it that's why God let these
[24:52] storms come upon us he don't want us to
[24:54] give up sometimes you lose you you might
[24:57] fall you might stumble but you get back
[25:00] up why because it's in you to whip the
[25:03] devil is in you to defeat Satan God will
[25:09] not be satisfied till he see you defeat
[25:12] the devil you're his sons daughters
[25:17] whoever he will not be satisfied until
[25:20] he see you if he's Satan how did Jesus
[25:24] tell was tested after 40 days of fasting
[25:28] here the devil comes hallelujah he did
[25:32] signs and wonders amen afterwards but
[25:34] what was he to do he first had to defeat
[25:38] the devil before he could go anywhere
[25:41] else
[25:41] ah and how did he defeat the devil not
[25:45] with his feelings not with his emotions
[25:48] he defeated the devil with his word
[25:51] hallelujah he could have said be God and
[25:54] the begone
[25:55] and the devil would have vanish but he
[25:57] said with his words he spoke the word
[25:59] remember I told you the bride must be
[26:02] combative you must combat you must fight
[26:06] onward Christian soldiers marching as to
[26:09] war with the cross of Jesus going on
[26:12] before you must fight back God didn't
[26:15] put us in this age to fall down and
[26:18] faint and give up he put us in this age
[26:22] because he knew the bride would put the
[26:24] devil under his feet her feet amen
[26:28] that's where we are we have a sure
[26:31] foundation our foundation is in God it's
[26:36] in Christ is that right Paul said I have
[26:39] laid the foundation and there
[26:43] said no man ever lay another foundation
[26:45] because there is no other foundation
[26:48] outside of Jesus Christ you and I must
[26:52] build our house upon that rock
[26:55] hallelujah Jesus Christ himself he's the
[27:00] same yesterday today and forever
[27:03] that's what brother Branham did he sure
[27:07] did his foundation wasn't built on the
[27:10] Baptist Church nor was it about been
[27:12] built on the Pentecostal church it was
[27:15] built upon Jesus Christ being the same
[27:18] yesterday today and forever that means I
[27:21] can count on him anytime hallelujah
[27:25] that's why he said the bride of Jesus
[27:27] Christ can defeat the devil anywhere any
[27:31] place any time it doesn't matter where
[27:34] he pops up you have the ability to
[27:37] defeat him because if God is living in
[27:41] you he's not fighting you he's fighting
[27:44] the God that's in you and the God that's
[27:46] in you spells out victory but he don't
[27:50] want you to know that that's why that's
[27:54] why you know job was going through those
[27:56] situations and here God put him through
[27:58] the DES and I said to you this morning
[27:59] said get up from there girdle up throw
[28:03] mine that's what's wrong with us
[28:05] tighten up this mind of yours wrap it up
[28:08] and tangle it up in the Word of God
[28:11] right going up be a man stand up he said
[28:18] no I'm saying fight get out there to
[28:23] know that God is behind you is that
[28:26] right the Bible said the angel of the
[28:28] lord encamps about them that fear him
[28:31] not fear his enemy
[28:33] fear God you reverence God and God will
[28:36] respect you hallelujah
[28:39] there's not a man in the world that has
[28:42] ever stood on the Word of God and God
[28:44] let them stay hang there I don't care if
[28:47] they don't even believe this message if
[28:49] they stand on the Word of God God will
[28:52] come because it's his word and God is
[28:56] going to stand
[28:57] his word and he's gonna bring that word
[28:59] to pass if you believe it there's so
[29:01] many people in there that have been
[29:03] delivered and been healed they've been
[29:05] don't know nothing about God's and a
[29:07] prophet but they stood on the word with
[29:09] these stripes we are healed God will
[29:14] defend his word Oh somebody help me here
[29:17] Oh Lord listen hearken unto me according
[29:22] to isaiah 40:8 Oh Jacob and here Oh

[29:32] we worry about anything else he's the
[29:35] first in the last Oh help us Jesus he
[29:39] said my hand has also laid the
[29:41] foundation of the earth and my right
[29:43] hand has spanned the heavens when I
[29:45] called unto them they stand up together
[29:48] he said everything whenever I call for
[29:51] them they stand up
[29:53] he's there together but because the
[29:57] whole heaven and earth is named after
[29:58] him ain't God good to us oh he said in
[30:02] Isaiah's cry he said what shall I cry he
[30:05] said all flesh is like grass you can I
[30:08] have no confidence in this hey don't you
[30:12] ever think that this thing this thing is
[30:14] gonna stand in the time of trouble
[30:17] better bad dog come your way you can try
[30:21] to be fearless but this flesh is going
[30:25] to quake and shake yeah and if that word
[30:31] is not in your heart as it should be you
[30:34] gonna get scared afraid but when that
[30:39] heart when that word is in you guess
[30:41] what happened it overtakes you it will
[30:45] cast out the fear is that right oh you

[31:42] when you are in line or in the duty God
[31:45] is obligated and God was obligated
[31:49] because the Prophet was on his way to to
[31:52] pray for that sister and God was
[31:54] obligated to protect him God is
[32:00] obligated ooh

[34:09] motions we don't already see me into the
[34:12] book do y'all know who won we know who
[34:17] won Hey Oh what are you saying Brooks I
[34:20] don't know all I can tell you is that
[34:22] when John says behold the Lambs why I
[34:25] was there I was in there this Sydney out
[34:30] of over the New Jerusalem I'm part of
[34:34] that she said brothers how do you know I
[34:37] know he battles for me he fought for me
[34:40] he won the victory for me he whipped the
[34:43] hell for me that I might not go there he
[34:46] went there for you I have faith I can
[34:50] believe that I received that and
[34:52] therefore I can't go there you gotta
[34:57] believe you bribed somehow your faith
[35:00] his faith must kick in and tell you you
[35:03] I bribed I used to wake up every morning
[35:06] because the Prophet God said if you
[35:08] don't have the Holy Ghost he said you
[35:10] ought to confess it every day thank you
[35:12] for the Holy Ghost thank you for the
[35:14] Holy Ghost even if you don't feel it
[35:16] thank you for the Holy Ghost and I'm
[35:18] gonna tell you something I used to say
[35:19] thank you Lord for being bride thank you
[35:22] Jesus for being bride I don't know but
[35:24] one day it clicked and no devil can take
[35:30] that from me
[35:33] hello no devil can take
[35:37] from me think the blood of Jesus Christ
[35:46] is powerful enough to save me he is my
[35:51] brother
[35:53] he's more than a walk and he has you
[36:01] think God didn't see all the mistakes I
[36:03] was gonna make after he saved me
[36:06] brother Bentham said even in our
[36:08] peculiar ways God still gave us the Holy
[36:10] Ghost he knew every bit of the things we
[36:14] were gonna do after you get it he do any
[36:17] mistake you were gonna make you heard
[36:19] what I said I read it you go make
[36:21] mistakes you love the Lord the Bible
[36:32] said faith is the substance of things
[36:34] hoped for but the evidence of things not
[36:36] seen for is and you know in the end
[36:39] those in those places we're brothers not
[36:41] these senses that we have we have five
[36:43] senses and a brother was yeah it was
[36:45] wonderful he was giving a testimony
[36:47] because I think you remember brother
[36:49] Samuel brother Samuel was here you said
[36:51] his dad always told him he has six
[36:53] senses and so in while he was in school
[36:55] they had text and the FS on the test how
[36:59] many senses yeah he said I knew I had
[37:01] five he said but my daddy taught me six
[37:03] so I just knew I was gonna be the only
[37:05] one with the right answer he was the
[37:08] only one that failed with O equals six
[37:13] I said the brother you knew you was
[37:15] right right Wow because faith is the
[37:17] sixth sense
[37:18] oh the Prophet couldn't have brought it
[37:20] no greater than that because just as you
[37:23] can see and you can hear and you can
[37:25] speak you know you you know that these
[37:27] senses are real do you got him you don't
[37:29] have to worry about it you got him
[37:31] that's how real faith is you work that
[37:34] sense like your sight like your hearing
[37:36] like your all of those other you work in
[37:38] it's there for you to work it's to
[37:41] exercise it are the new you ask use
[37:45] musicians they got gifts they can play
[37:48] but it didn't come overnight
[37:51] they had to work it they had to
[37:53] condition their hands craps and all they
[37:56] had to push over it
[37:59] stretching trying to reach those keys
[38:02] but now it's just like wow they exercise
[38:06] it because they knew the gift was in a
[38:09] godsend you storms amen in each storm
[38:12] one might be a lion the end the storm
[38:14] might be a bear but don't you forget
[38:16] Goliath is coming and because you
[38:19] whipped the bear and the end and then I
[38:21] lion that means I have the ability to
[38:24] whip the liya God promotes us as we gain
[38:28] ground in faith he promotes you yes you
[38:33] think your test is going to be over
[38:34] after you beat Goliath Oh
[38:37] David was just beginning you know the
[38:41] story he had all things he had to deal
[38:43] with right he the local ayah there's
[38:46] over then God brought it closer to his
[38:48] heart became a brother saw you
[38:53] understand me
[38:54] you might whip the devil on the outside
[38:56] with the world a me but now God don't
[38:58] bring your batter into the church now
[39:04] you got a fight hallelujah
[39:07] oh and you know what David saw that and
[39:10] he says oh my god I cut the non did I
[39:13] cut his garment love forgive me forgive
[39:16] me Lord
[39:16] David had a right he could have killed
[39:19] Saul but he didn't and he repented just
[39:24] by cuz he cut sauce garlic think about
[39:27] it it didn't hurt sauce flesh just his
[39:33] garment and we can't even repent when we
[39:35] hurt somebody's feelings hey is your
[39:39] test is what God putting you through and
[39:43] guess what he knows you can do it stand
[39:47] up Carville your minds be the bride of
[39:51] Jesus Christ hallelujah is that all
[39:54] right you and I must understand him and
[39:56] this warfare is complete that means God
[39:59] has already done it for you and me
[40:04] I was telling the church tonight though
[40:06] you know I don't like mint this morning
[40:08] my English ain't all that good but I
[40:10] trust that you understand it anyway when
[40:14] we come to the word God gave us
[40:18] God gave us a sword we don't have just
[40:24] the sword hmm
[40:26] he gave us the King sword you know what
[40:29] the King sword
[40:30] it is the revelation of this word it's a
[40:33] sharp sword the message that we have
[40:36] will divide you it will cut you up
[40:40] it would divide your flesh from your
[40:42] spirit and your spirit from your soul it
[40:46] will allow you to see where the devil is
[40:49] hiding hello it will divide your faith
[40:53] in your hope and your charity hallelujah
[40:59] it will show you if you've got hope or
[41:01] whether you got thing is that right a
[41:04] man this message is so perfect amen and
[41:08] it's there to operate on you and me let
[41:13] him operate let go and let God have his
[41:16] way you've got to fight your way just
[41:21] ain't no better ease here it is we've
[41:24] gone through tests and trials like it's
[41:25] the worst thing we ever had in our lives
[41:27] and nobody getting their heads cut off
[41:30] hello nobody's going to the guillotine
[41:33] nobody is Amen going in and then let me
[41:36] that like they did in the medieval days
[41:38] rose to people on the fire they snatched
[41:41] babies out of women's bellies and young
[41:44] I mean Christians were tormented for a
[41:49] thousand years tormented and they were
[41:53] tormented why to do what to make sure
[41:56] this gospel kept going we were in their
[42:02] minds because had they failed we would
[42:05] have not been here but because they
[42:08] pushed because they continued because
[42:11] they press through all those obstacles
[42:13] and that just shall live by his faith
[42:17] it was his faith that caused them to run
[42:21] toward the Lions hallelujah it was their
[42:25] faith about said they'd thought nothing
[42:27] of their lives and that's where God
[42:31] wants us to be we must come to a place
[42:33] where we think nothing of our lives then
[42:35] everything about us must be Jesus Christ
[42:38] well I'm not gonna be long just give me
[42:42] a few more moments few more minutes
[42:44] hmm you look at this thing it says all
[42:46] brother books are you sure listen I do
[42:49] not want to be like Matthew says Matthew
[42:52] 15 says the people draw nigh unto me
[42:55] with their mouth and honor me with their
[42:57] lips but their heart is far from me
[43:01] many Christians they come right here
[43:05] everywhere they go they come and and
[43:07] then oh I just oh and their mouth they
[43:10] sound good but then when they by
[43:11] themselves when they're not how well
[43:14] they're living it hmm in vain in vain
[43:19] they do worship me teaching that further
[43:22] doctrines the commandments of men and
[43:24] and I've heard this is so true look how
[43:27] the devil as I said this morning the
[43:29] devil says use the Word of God is off
[43:31] all you got to do is receive the Lord
[43:34] Jesus into your heart and you become a
[43:37] Christian what a lie huh oh all you got
[43:43] to do that they were Peter said if men
[43:47] and brethren what must we do he said
[43:49] repent cheat when you repent and that's
[43:55] what the problem is they say oh I got
[43:57] Jesus in my heart and dr. changes they
[44:01] don't think they have to change they've
[44:02] received Jesus they believe Jesus and
[44:04] now tell you the devil does too the
[44:07] Bible said the devil believes and
[44:08] tremble but there must come a change
[44:12] Oh think about it the change must come
[44:20] because if life is in you it will
[44:23] produce life is that right it'll make
[44:27] you bird
[44:30] you know how this oh I'm trying the bird
[44:32] I'm trying the life you just like I said
[44:40] keep eating keep reading keep praying
[44:42] keep that whatever God that'll teach you
[44:45] listen keep with sharing the scripture
[44:51] with me and I've been thinking about it
[44:52] ever since but let me tell you something
[44:54] when you fast you fast for yolks to be
[44:55] broken mmm you know you don't fast to
[44:59] get faith faith come out here in the
[45:02] Word of God not by fasting you fasting
[45:06] because of other people not yourself you
[45:08] fasting that God will break the yolks
[45:11] hmm you know what people don't
[45:14] understand is that it's even fasting and
[45:16] things like that have been misplaced hmm
[45:20] you know people that all communion all
[45:22] praise God come you communion it's not
[45:25] eating bread when I commune with
[45:28] somebody I'm talking with them
[45:30] I'm fellowshipping and if you come to
[45:32] communion and you're not fellowship with
[45:34] God what you're doing you're lying
[45:37] communion is to say me and God has been
[45:39] fellowship it's not bread and told I
[45:45] mean bread and unwind
[45:47] those are symbolic symbolisms of of what
[45:50] you've been doing with God and the body
[45:52] of Christ because you cannot commune
[45:55] with God if you can't commune with the
[45:57] body of Christ oh that's a big one in
[46:01] there you love the Lord I'm gonna
[46:09] closing just a bit y'all just bear with
[46:10] me brothers I know y'all tired too but
[46:13] I'm so glad you came in the message
[46:17] oneness the Prophet God says no one can
[46:19] believe here it is no man no woman can
[46:24] believe the devil's lies until they have
[46:27] disbelieved God's truth a shout somebody
[46:33] no one can believe the devil's lie until
[46:38] they have disbelieved God's truth
[46:46] [Music]
[46:48] and y'all knows the truth in order for
[46:51] us to believe the lie we must first push
[46:54] away the truth if God say you deliver
[46:57] and the devil said you're not delivered
[46:59] you must first push for where your
[47:01] deliverance in order to believe that
[47:03] you're not delivered hallelujah is this
[47:13] okay listen let me read this quote the
[47:18] Word of God is sharper than a two-edged
[47:20] sword even a discerner of the thoughts
[47:22] of the heart and what it can only be
[47:25] handled by one hand a sword is dominant
[47:30] it has nothing in it unless it's handled
[47:34] by a hand and when I hand of faith can
[47:38] pick up God's Word it'll do the same
[47:40] thing Jesus did the works that I do
[47:43] shall you do also maybe you can cut just
[47:48] a little maybe you got a weak hand of
[47:51] faith you can cut enough off to say well
[47:54] I can see enough daylight to see if I'm
[47:57] saying but choose me but what about the
[48:00] other promises if you got a strong hand
[48:03] of faith pick up the full word of God
[48:06] and cut right on through every darkness
[48:09] amen until the light of God shines in
[48:12] and look face to face with God standing
[48:16] on his word amen she had many hindrances
[48:20] this poor little woman did she had many
[48:24] hindrances but her faith didn't have any
[48:28] no no hello she had him but a faint
[48:33] didn't know no she had heard faith had
[48:36] took a whole she heard and her faith had
[48:39] took a whole now they might have said to
[48:42] this her you know you are Greek you know
[48:46] you never get nothing because there's a
[48:48] segregation you see and you never get
[48:51] nothing here but did she pay attention
[48:54] to that no sir she had
[48:56] faith and that faith was all she needed
[49:00] because she know that that was the Word
[49:03] of God standing there she had faith and
[49:07] some of them might have said to her but
[49:09] wait a minute
[49:10] her own nation her own church might have
[49:13] said now wait a minute the days of
[49:16] miracles is past don't you go down there
[49:18] there that days of miracles is past but
[49:22] something another about faith it has a
[49:26] source that don't pay attention to that
[49:28] it just don't notice it she had done
[49:33] picked up the word he is the word she
[49:36] had the faith to hold it she she walked
[49:38] on they might have laughed at her well
[49:41] everybody else was going to laugh at you
[49:44] because your daughter would be just as
[49:46] sick next year and she is this year
[49:48] she'll still have the devil she'll be
[49:51] just a sick but she didn't pay any
[49:53] attention to that faith had a whole you
[49:57] be you'll be put out of your church if
[50:00] you ever go there in one of that just
[50:04] remember they put you out there s
[50:08] communicate you that didn't mean
[50:10] anything to her faith on every excuse me
[50:14] faith went on over the top of that and
[50:17] she was determined to get to Jesus see
[50:21] that's what I'm saying
[50:22] they told me brother Brooks if you go to
[50:25] another one of your those meetings we
[50:27] gonna put you out I said will you put me
[50:30] out there just like that she gots a sane
[50:37] idea to forgive me long but this the
[50:39] truth what do I care you don't have
[50:42] shame I'm gonna be put out of your
[50:44] church and that was a that was the best
[50:46] thing they could have said to me
[50:47] and then one day I said well I'm gonna
[50:49] tell the bishop I say go tell the bishop
[50:51] you don't push me in a corner now I
[50:55] might look a little timid or whatever
[50:57] but not not not when you push me in the
[50:59] corner that's a different story
[51:01] anyhow amen and because I mean many
[51:06] people left that system but nevertheless
[51:10] it was God working God's Word cannot be
[51:13] questionable you can't question God's
[51:17] Word if God says that that's what he
[51:20] means don't blame God if it ain't
[51:23] happening is your thing hmm and if it if
[51:29] it ain't happening to you maybe God
[51:31] don't want it to happen to you at that
[51:32] moment because when God wants it to
[51:34] happen he gives you the faith for it to
[51:36] happen
[51:37] to make it happen your faith is the only
[51:40] thing that can do you any good you'll
[51:43] believe your faith in God see what I
[51:45] mean without faith it is impossible is
[51:50] that true you can't you can't please in
[51:53] oh I can't see him I don't need to see
[51:56] him
[51:56] with my natural eyes I can't see him but
[51:59] I know he's just as real as I am how do
[52:04] you know you saved what did God do to
[52:08] you did you feel a mighty rushing wind
[52:11] did you see the pillar fire did you see
[52:14] the pillow cloud did you hear the angels
[52:17] singing that has nothing to do with it
[52:29] when God saves you something happens in
[52:33] the heart and it never stays dormant
[52:39] when it happens guess what happens so
[52:42] you'll know you're saved you start
[52:44] hungry you want more of God
[52:49] you get disgusted when you make mistakes
[52:53] that means you alive something in you is
[52:56] living and feeding so your best bet is
[53:00] to take the Word of God and feed that
[53:02] new birth that thing that's in you you
[53:04] feed it till it break loose in you yeah
[53:08] that's when you know you got something
[53:11] like I said here before a dead man don't
[53:15] say I'm hungry a dead man is dead
[53:22] ain't nothing about a dead man
[53:24] is hungry but when you hunger and thirst
[53:30] guess what the best sign that that you
[53:33] are live when you are hungry and
[53:35] thirsting for what righteousness God
[53:38] said you shall be filled
[53:41] now do you believe that I believe that I
[53:46] have faith in Him and that's what I keep
[53:49] telling God I said God I trust you you
[53:52] know me you made me you created me you
[53:56] know my beginning my ending my uprising
[53:58] am i setting down when I go in where I
[54:00] go out you know me what can I do to hide
[54:04] from God
[54:05] there ain't nothing the Bob said even
[54:08] the darkness is like to God he sees
[54:10] everything he knows everything and
[54:13] that's what I tell him I talked to him
[54:16] just like that I said oh shoot know me
[54:19] ain't nothing I can do to hide from you
[54:21] but then you know what the part of my
[54:24] heart that won't smoke won't you more
[54:25] than anything else in spite of all my
[54:28] failures you know and I'm trusting you
[54:33] because he that begun the good work in
[54:35] you is faithful to complete it we worry
[54:38] about things that we don't we shouldn't
[54:39] worry about because the battles have
[54:41] been fought and the victory has been won
[54:43] before Paul even died he said thanks be
[54:46] to God who gives me give us what the
[54:50] victory he gave it to you it's already
[54:53] yours but you know we rely on our
[54:57] sisters is this the same visa five oh I
[55:01] gotta feel it I would tell you thing
[55:04] about gifted people when you got
[55:07] discernment it's a good thing but it
[55:10] could also be bad because just like you
[55:13] pick up on God you also pick up on the
[55:16] devil you understand me
[55:19] and guess what you say oh I want to do
[55:22] this up but you got to be careful
[55:24] because Satan can disguise himself he
[55:30] can almost feet and come out come to you
[55:32] and feel like feel oh it's the Holy
[55:33] Spirit who I felt goosebumps hey brother
[55:37] what I'm saying
[55:38] if a body rushing when he struck you he
[55:40] said you know how do you always Oh guy
[55:42] he said no let's see what it does for
[55:44] you after it struck you that's how you
[55:49] did it
[55:50] oh one more quote number let you go it
[55:54] takes a mustard seed faith to be with
[55:57] God we don't know do y'all know what
[56:01] perfect oneness is it's God in you
[56:07] that's it perfect oneness
[56:13] now the first man and his first woman in
[56:16] the Garden of Eden was in perfect
[56:18] harmony with God so much that God could
[56:22] come down at any time he desired and
[56:25] talked lip to ear with Adam and Eve
[56:28] that's what I loved about brother
[56:29] Branham it made no difference whether he
[56:31] was hunting walking whatever he was in
[56:35] such a condition that God could come
[56:37] down and talk to him now people that's
[56:40] the way we supposed to be it's not him
[56:44] that he's the perfect one in me the
[56:47] interest is made and he's gonna oh no no
[56:49] you got to become like that your
[56:52] communion must be that way your
[56:55] fellowship must be that way you
[56:57] understand me so it is a family I'm
[57:02] reading into you in just a minute
[57:04] so much that God could come down at any
[57:06] time he desired and talk lip to ear with
[57:09] Adam and Eve now that is perfect oneness
[57:12] God and His creation God speaking lip to
[57:17] ear with Adam and Eve and they were so
[57:20] perfect in harmony with God till they
[57:22] were one with God God and his family was
[57:26] one and man in his family a correct good
[57:30] noble obedient family is one with
[57:34] another any family and if there's
[57:36] something in the family that moves them
[57:39] apart then it's not right the family's
[57:41] broken somewhere they should all be one
[57:45] father with mother mother with father
[57:48] children with parent parent with
[57:50] children all in the
[57:51] agreement and when you see that you'll
[57:54] see one lovely picture the God's purpose
[57:58] that's God's purpose and his purpose as
[58:01] father supreme was to be one with his
[58:04] family earthly family Adam and Eve and
[58:08] the only way that they could be one with
[58:11] the family or with God was because God's
[58:13] nature was in them right God's nature
[58:19] was in them so that made them with God
[58:22] nature in them then with each other and
[58:25] God they become all one isn't that a
[58:27] beautiful picture God in his family
[58:30] father over all supreme no death no
[58:33] sorrow no heartache no no no nothing
[58:36] just joy and speak for never to be sick
[58:39] never to have a headache just one with
[58:42] God what a picture because the very
[58:44] nature of God was in these people and
[58:47] therefore what they did they fathered
[58:50] just just in line with God and God with
[58:53] them made them one that's why the devil
[58:57] don't want the nature of God in you
[58:59] that's why he's putting so many
[59:01] distractions in our way because he knows
[59:05] once the fullness of the nature of God
[59:07] is in you you want with him you hear
[59:10] from him live to hear God talks to you
[59:14] when he won't talk to somebody else he
[59:18] knows if you reach that level you become
[59:21] a powerhouse when that lady said to the
[59:31] Prophet god William burn we don't have
[59:33] nothing to do with you her husband said
[59:38] well my wife is now spoken she haven't
[59:40] been speaking like since she got in
[59:42] there he said that ain't your wife
[59:43] that's the devil huh
[59:47] it's powerful when the devil knows your
[59:49] name that means you didn't put her will
[59:52] heat him you didn't rob some havoc in
[59:54] his kingdom right
[59:57] he said that ain't that ain't your wife
[59:59] that's the devil and this is what he
[1:00:02] said
[1:00:03] he said he went to grab that lady
[1:00:05] he said and he was like god is great he
[1:00:07] had put his foot on one thing to snatch
[1:00:09] his hand away he said she had the power
[1:00:12] of ten men and he said that was demonic
[1:00:15] power he said what about the Holy Ghost
[1:00:18] power in you if demons can cause that
[1:00:22] what about the Holy Ghost power and no
[1:00:32] matter how tight that debt that lady
[1:00:33] grabbed him huh the devil had to come
[1:00:35] out amen that's see what you see Jesus
[1:00:41] prayed in John chapter 11 of 17 11 says
[1:00:44] to you who put down these son let's go
[1:00:47] go he says listen Jesus prayed that the
[1:00:50] church and he would be one like he and
[1:00:52] the father was one that's the church we
[1:00:55] as members of the body of Christ would
[1:00:57] be one together like that like he and
[1:01:00] the father are one
[1:01:01] and at that day we will know that he was
[1:01:05] in the father and father in him and he
[1:01:08] in us that together we were one what a
[1:01:11] union a oneness that will be to see God
[1:01:15] in his church till every member is just
[1:01:17] perfectly in harmony with each other and
[1:01:20] God now come on we got a long way to go
[1:01:26] that the church that Jesus has come
[1:01:30] that's the church that Jesus is coming
[1:01:32] from for that when his that's when his
[1:01:36] prayer will be answered that we will be
[1:01:41] one and it's the only grounds of
[1:01:44] fellowship that God has ever laid down
[1:01:46] for himself and his church is the
[1:01:48] oneness of himself in the people that's
[1:01:51] the only grounds of fellowship and the
[1:01:54] only way that you can have those grounds
[1:01:57] is by Union to be united with him
[1:01:59] forever just like when you unite with
[1:02:02] your husband the woman to unite with her
[1:02:05] husband it is a vow unto death
[1:02:08] now when then when you unite with God is
[1:02:11] the same thing that the church unites
[1:02:14] with Christ it until death we part and
[1:02:17] then if you
[1:02:18] never sinned or do anything wrong you'll
[1:02:21] be eternally United with God and the
[1:02:24] only death can excuse me and only death
[1:02:27] can take you away from God and not
[1:02:29] physical death but the sin of death sin
[1:02:32] is death and that takes you away from
[1:02:35] God so to be united with him in the
[1:02:38] spirit of his power is eternal life
[1:02:40] you're eternally united with God oh I
[1:02:45] want to get to that after a bit United
[1:02:48] eternally with the eternal God perfectly
[1:02:52] in harmony with him perfectly United
[1:02:56] together a church that all both God and
[1:02:59] His Church is one you nine it together
[1:03:03] you understand me
[1:03:05] so I say all of this John says a loud
[1:03:10] voice I heard a loud voice saying in
[1:03:14] heaven now is salvation come and
[1:03:17] strength and kingdom of God and the
[1:03:21] power of Christ for the accuser of our
[1:03:24] brother is cast down which accused them
[1:03:27] before our God day and night listen they
[1:03:32] overcame by him by the blood of the Lamb
[1:03:36] and by the word of their testimony and
[1:03:39] they loved not their lives unto death
[1:03:44] they overcame no tests no testimony no
[1:03:55] tests no testimony
[1:04:00] you know God could have made your Moses
[1:04:04] put the stick in your hand say go tell
[1:04:08] Pharaoh we got an easy compare yeah we
[1:04:15] got it easy
[1:04:16] can you imagine what that you can't do
[1:04:19] that without faith you cannot do that
[1:04:22] kind of a thing without the leadership
[1:04:24] of God
[1:04:25] and to know how wicked and evil Pharaoh
[1:04:27] was and then you coming up there
[1:04:30] threatening him
[1:04:33] with all of his entourage all of his
[1:04:35] bodyguards all of his army about him and
[1:04:38] you saying let my people go that man no
[1:04:44] doubt if you had been him you were to
[1:04:46] say you know we got a nut there's
[1:04:48] something wrong with this man yeah but
[1:04:52] he failed to see that inside of Moses
[1:04:56] was a God failed God was there he wasn't
[1:05:00] dealing with Moses nor the Prince of
[1:05:02] Egypt no longer was he dealing with the
[1:05:04] Prince of Egypt here was Moses now our
[1:05:08] King that right
[1:05:12] not just the king of God I'm gonna make
[1:05:14] you God over Pharaoh and that's what I'm
[1:05:18] trying to say folks those were shadows
[1:05:20] and tights
[1:05:21] those were things that God did to
[1:05:24] increase your faith and brother man said
[1:05:27] I was there I was there I was there and
[1:05:30] if brother Brandon was there so with you
[1:05:31] and you got to take those scriptures
[1:05:34] when things come your way and you can't
[1:05:37] seem to get over fine you were get that
[1:05:40] is in here God would give you what you
[1:05:44] need for your right now circumstance and
[1:05:47] you find that word and you hold on to it
[1:05:50] if you've got to confess it every day
[1:05:53] until it happens right with the stripes
[1:05:58] I'm healed extra-extra with the stripes
[1:06:01] I'm healed
[1:06:01] because he thought he had faith he
[1:06:03] didn't have it but he had to confess it
[1:06:05] confess it confess it even though people
[1:06:07] laughed at him extra answer with the
[1:06:09] stripes I'm healed he had to confess it
[1:06:13] confessing confessing and then God came
[1:06:15] on the scene is that right look at the
[1:06:18] latest Amen that that that all infidel
[1:06:20] says are you know up on the hill we
[1:06:22] thought that the Salvation Army had that
[1:06:24] moved up in up there said oh that one
[1:06:27] had a big order and I think the other
[1:06:29] one had cancer something going on in her
[1:06:31] stomach she couldn't eat hallelujah her
[1:06:35] husband said when I come over honey you
[1:06:36] know you still believe in that said but
[1:06:38] honey that man was able to tell me
[1:06:40] things that nobody else could have told
[1:06:43] me it had to be God Jana
[1:06:46] coming and date but they had to be
[1:06:48] tested whenever you say I believe
[1:06:52] something and God is gonna send the
[1:06:54] tests and you got to hold on to what you
[1:06:58] believe
[1:06:59] cuz if you move you got to start it all
[1:07:02] over again
[1:07:03] hello you got to know no matter how
[1:07:06] strong it seems and no matter how
[1:07:09] pressing it looks you hold on to God's
[1:07:13] unchanging head if God has said so it
[1:07:17] will come to pass no matter how long it
[1:07:19] takes and the Bible said that night the
[1:07:22] angel the Lord visited the city whoa I
