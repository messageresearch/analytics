your testimonial [Music] it's good to be in house Lord tonight hi I'm one of them that needed the grace of God when brother Branham said that the word is our defense I got to have a defense because I make mistakes daily I need the grace of God I I'm one of them that was raised up in a message church sitting on a message pew we all preached about cutting our teeth on the message pew that was me but I found out that being raised up in a message doesn't do me any good it's when that restitch message is raised up in you and that word of God comes and it begins to change you that's when it does something I was 29 years old I had quit the church and decided I didn't want anything to do with it I was gonna marry a good woman but didn't know anything about the message so she wouldn't bother me with it so that's what I did got married sit at home on Sundays watch cars go around in a circle watch men cook a little football around on Sundays while the saints of God were glorifying God at church I was sitting at home but one day my wife come home and she said who's brother brown and I said I don't know no brother Brown she said yeah you know that picture that your mom and dad's got on the wall and I said oh you mean brother branham and she said yeah that's what they said brother branham she said your mom said to tell me about brother Branham and so I talked her for a little bit and brother Wayne Lawson you may know him he came and talked to her took her through Daniel Malachi all the way through the scriptures she accepted the message so now I'm sitting there with I'm sitting there with the my worst nightmare was the wife going to church and begging me to go I resisted for a few years and one day I was I was buying houses and fixing them and selling them I knocked on the door of a house there was a preacher that lived there I was gonna try to buy the house it was a message preacher lived there led me to the Lord at his coffee table after all them years that I thought that God had forgot about me because I had forgot about him but he was still waiting he was still waiting for that one day he was still waiting for that one preacher and he was still waiting for my heart to be tenderized at a coffee table that's my testimony and sure God bless you surely appreciate the Lord Jesus daily John be a man we appreciate brother I think God for His grace and His mercy amen I didn't know which way he was gonna go I thought well now if you preach well praise the Lord [Laughter] but we thank God for His grace in His mercy amen you love the Lord thank you sir thank you that's Stan that just shows you you can't hide from God God got your number and he knows where you live amen amen so we appreciate the Lord and the song service brother Keith hadn't done it in a while but he did a good job the Lord really blessed and you know we appreciate our brother Samuel as well you know come out during this time of schooling it still comes to play so you know I appreciate that and all of you will come out on Wednesday nights a real blessing as we turn to 2nd John the first chapter 2nd John the first chapter I have been just bathing in the grace of God and we appreciate the Lord Jesus our brother when he first got up here he talked about the grace of God and you and I must know that you won't make it without the grace of God it is the grace of God that has brought us thus far and I truly thank God it'll be a second John please second John there's only one chapter of this we'll begin reading at the first verse of this second John the elder unto the elect lady and her children whom I love in the truth and not I only but also are they that have known the truth for the truth sake which dwelleth in US and shall be with us forever grace be with you mercy and peace from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ the Son of the Father in truth and love love that Hebrews 10 please surely God is you know that the devil must really feel stupid at times with all of his efforts he may cause us to stumble he may cause us to fall even sometime crawl but he can never stop us all right he must feel pretty stupid and you know what wait till he discover that those who thought he was sitting to hell they're not there and they will never be there it's so amazing I marvel at him because for some reason he has in his mind that he can still outsmart God and that's what gets me Hebrews 10 we're gonna read the 38th 39th verse now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall not have my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not a bill who draw back in unto perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul let's pray father God we come before you we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us forgive us and cleanse us Lord from all unrighteousness Lord I pray Lord this morning or this evening Lord God that you would break the yolks of the enemy open up Lord the revelation of your dear son Jesus Christ to us and father we'll be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated sometimes the Holy Spirit give me word to speak and sometimes I'm struggling with what the subject would be because to me it just seems like I have so many thoughts coming through my mind and just when you need God the most is when he comes through I would like to entitle this message the revelation that is only given to the elect lady the revelation that is only given to the elect lady I think God for our brother Vincent we had such a wonderful fellowship on Sunday the word was extraordinarily good which is always good you know it makes me no different if a man preach and he stutters while he's doing it I'm enjoying it as long as it is the word and I would like to sub topic topic this message the faith of Jesus Christ when we look at this elect lady we understand by the message that this lady is a special lady this is a lady that God has already ordained to be bride and as John is writing you see by God's grace that she's given a lot of mercy and a lot of grace and most of all God wants her to have peace you can't have peace in God until you realize and recognize who you are in God and understand the sacrifice that have already been made in God's plan he's not writing the script as he goes but you and I must understand that this script has been written and was written before the foundation of the world God put this message or this word in stone he put it in the heavens he put it in the book what we call the Bible and now God has placed a fourth book and that is in the heart of the believer where God said that he will no longer just write it on tables of stone but he would write it in the fleshly hearts of men so you and I must understand that this thing that that God has started can never be overturned and the scripture says that no matter what it looks like all things work together for the good of them that love the Lord and those who are called according to the purpose of God what is faith faith is when you believe that is not your beliefs gives me that is not is not based upon proof it's something that you know that you know that you know that exist or that is there or that will happen even though you don't have any proof you know you say well what do you mean brother Brooks and believing God brother Branham said do you know what how did God make the earth this earth that you're sitting on this morning people don't want to believe in faith how did God make the earth he spoke it amen you see he spake and the world can't come into existence and this world this morning is the spoken word of God and he believed his own word here it is watch it and if God and you and you and offspring of him God is in you he will believe his own word though it can't be seen felt taste or anything you believe it see what I mean for God in you will believe his own word is that right then you don't look at things you see you look at things that God said that's why Abraham was able to call those things that be not as though they were now you and I cannot scientifically explain how we're going to make a rapture most of us can look within ourselves and see the thoughts and see the failures but if God has ordained you to make a rapture or a translation or catching away there is no way you can miss it you hallelujah is not by power is not by might but by my word said the Lord and you and I must realize that you if you and I have been chosen before the foundation of the world to be the elected lady of this hour there is no power out of hell that can make it a make God I'll know it because God never made a mistake when he chose you is that Alright faith is important the Bible said without faith is impossible to please God is that right the Prophet God tells us that faith is a revelation I love this because you cannot become you can't be bribed if you don't even believe that you are you must believe that God has chosen you to be bribed being bribed can never be guesswork it must be solid it must be something that has been revealed to you is that right come on somebody this message is ordained to reveal to the bride of Jesus Christ who she is is that right Mary who was a virgin did not know who she was but an angel came down and told Mary you are scriptural you are the very bride that God chose to bring forth his son hallelujah ha at the experience with the angel Mary knew who she was is that right it took away all fear and Mary didn't see no signs there was no wonders but the preacher the angel preached if I could say like that gave Mary the word of the call there's a salutation from God and from that day on Mary knew though she didn't feel it she didn't see it she didn't smell it she didn't taste it but she understood by revelation that she was a bride of the Virgin chosen to bring forth the Christ child is that right and the angel gave her Scripture and told her listen you won't even have the ability to name him his name will be called Jesus is that right so you said what do you mean brother Brooks even when God chose you most some of us were sinners some of us were church members Baptist Memphis presbyterian whatever you were but when you came to this message the angel change your name from church to bride see but faith is important to have it you see what I'm saying because faith is something that only God can give you you can muster it you can't fake it faith is something it is a revelation that God puts in your heart you see it even though you can't explain it you got it even though no one can see it it's yours because you have it and God gave it to you is that right it's like when God you say to Bob says by faith Abel see it was God who helped Abel it wasn't able intellect it wasn't because he was he was Adams son it was because God by election chose able to give him the revelation is that right now he gave kena an education he told Abel I mean Cain if you do what Abel says if you do what Abel did I'll grant you you know you know we I give you what he got he has but God knows those who are elected can only receive the revelation for there our Cain couldn't receive it because it wasn't give it to him to receive it oh yes it's the truth when God has elected you you can't stop seeing him if you tried hallelujah is that right you can be a blind man and see him right Amen just like it was Amen when Jesus came on the scene that old blind prophet came around he says oh I'm gonna see him what it was faith something that was revealed to him and though his natural eyes could not see he could see with the spiritual eye is that right and when Jesus and Mary came into the temple all of a sudden he saw him right that's what faith does it can make you see things that others cannot see hallelujah and when you can see those things that other people can't see it makes you act upon it now you can't see still when you see God moving no it's the truth the Bible said by faith Enoch think about it I love Enoch because the Bible said he was translated he pleased God listen you got to understand that Enoch lived in at a in time like this day wicked man hallelujah all kinds of perversion was going on in the time of Enoch and by faith because he was elected by God to see that revelation and God took that man and built a pyramid that even scientists today don't even know how it was built but I'm gonna tell you how it was built cuz God had the blueprint hallelujah just like God had the blueprint for nose day is that right and God gave Enoch the blueprint he fallen through with it and right now still today they say Christians are dumb people but we're the most intelligent people in the world because we least know that there is a God and we know his name hallelujah but you can take a man with a doctor's a degree of divinity or whatever and he still don't know God is one hallelujah amen but Enoch heard the voice of God and he walked with God and y'all heard me say this many times amen Enoch Amen you know you know she scripted the scriptures is silent you know but you got to understand those people lived for for hundreds of years and it was by word of mouth and Enoch had to have had a sacrifice you say brother what do you mean because the Bible said without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin and in order for able to be rich to be remitted God had to there had to be a lamb before before Adam and Eve a man could be forgiven of covered there had to be a lamb and before Enoch could walk with God there had to be blood because blood is the only thing that covers your sin it is the only thing that justifies you before God hallelujah but either also had to have faith in the sacrifice hallelujah we didn't know job he men offered up sacrifice the way he did what he did because brother Branham tells us he often have sacrificed for his children hallelujah what was it that revelation if I can say like that is generational is that right it is an inheritance that God gives you and I you and me because of who we are Oh help me Lord oh god help me you said what do you mean William Brennan whose father was a drunk whose mother was a half Indian hallelujah but he was elected chosen before the foundation of the world and he received the revelation of who Jesus Christ was in an age of intellectualism and all he had was a seventh grade education hallelujah y'all better human to hell see because in election don't care where you were born who was your mother who's your father in this in this dimension somebody help me because God knows them that are here he'd know where you came from and he knows where you're going hallelujah and guess what he says my sheep hear is my voice is that right the bow said by faith Abel by faith Enoch by faith Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord hallelujah you think Noah was looking forward no grace was looking for him hallelujah you wouldn't look what is that right brother grace was looking for you and God had a time for my brother's deliverance his salvation hallelujah he didn't know he had a gene seed in there but God knew he had one hallelujah but he couldn't come until he picked up his wife it was all about her brother God had to do you that way in order to see what I'm saying who can who knows the mind of God who knows the mind of God mm-hmm he outsmarts the devil with his own his own tricks right he thought oh I let this brother go out there backslide and everything else I'll fix him and here God unite she'd was seen and the dev I had no idea hallelujah is that right that's the way God works at hallelujah oh come on somebody see it's it's that elected elated that received the revelation of who she is for her day I'm not talking intellectually I'm talking about the heart because that's the Bible it's not to be written upon the head it's the heart hallelujah you understand me that's where the Bible is it's in the heart somebody help me here Matthew 16 says when Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples saying who do men say that I the Son of Man am the whole whole of Israel are those who follow jesus knew he was a prophet even the Sadducees and the Pharisees knew he was a prophet but the problem was they didn't know who the Prophet was he wasn't just a regular prophet and that's what he wanted his disciples to see his elected lady come did he not he said John follow me Peter follow me he called them by man he brought them in to him but back directly pointing and bringing them is that drawing him that's how God did us he baptized all of the churches and the religious people and he found you and me hallelujah and he did not call them because they were already perfect hallelujah hey man Jesus look like he was a gangster nothing yeah that being sacrilegious to think about it he went and got the mess of the mess the thugs of the religious people tax collectors you know I'm saying fishermans y'all know how sailors are Peter what cursing wasn't some foreign thing from Peter Casillas are known to cars somebody help me here so he was a man with bad language bad temper and everything else all of them had something going on Holly and you know that's who God chose think about it put it in your day he was Jesus walking with a group of nobodies and you know they probably thought Luke hadn't lost his mind you mean to tell me you a physician and you go follow that man educated hallelujah think about it I'm trying to bring it to our day because every one of us I know you even myself when I when God saved me people thought I was out of my mind and you know what they were right I'm still crazy about Jesus hallelujah so you and I here goes as listen but jesus said I want you to know you you and that's the way it is now God wants you to know who he is once that revelation breaks to you oh my god is nothing can take it away is that right brother Branham said there many times he exhausted exhausted exhausted you know the mercies of God he said but it's grace I could never exhaust it will never hurt her but there are many times I tried the mercy but Grace has always been with me grace will always be with the Elector lady because she is lady elected grace hallelujah don't understand me grace is unmerited love and every one of us can say amen to that that God has loved us even when we were fallen even when we come short is that right even when we lie come on O God has been there and he said but whom say ye that I am Simon Peter said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and jesus answered and said to him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood have not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven he understand me he took it from at the natural level and brought it into a spiritual level right because he said listen when he says my father has revealed it unto you he's basically saying there's a greater me hallelujah there's a part of me that is spiritual that gave you this revelation without giving you a handbook or some book to read you understand me you can read the message all you want to but if your father which is the Holy Ghost don't quicken it to you you will never see it there is somebody y'all better help me now because I feel like shouting I can shot the next 20-30 minutes now you know but we must understand having the revelation of Jesus Christ within you produces something that is supernatural that right that's why he said these signs shall follow them that believe see it brings a surrender and all and and obedience with joy you mean tell me I got to do this no you don't have to do it but I feel good when I'm obeying God somebody help me I feel bad when I don't obey it but when I know that I'm in the will of God and I'm feeling and I know that he's directing me in a certain way it puts a joy in my soul is that right and you and I must understand and all I believe all of us say but that ain't what we're working with we're working with making a rapture hmm see what I'm saying hey brother battle has made it clear everybody under this message will not make a rapture whoo it's obedience it's God who has selected you to make a rapture and if you have been selected to make this rapture you will be obedient y'all hear me oh come on let me break it down brother branham said the foolish virgins and the wise version five wise five foolish and they were cut from the same material there ain't enough of one material we cut from and that is this message Oh somebody found me a little bit see because Allah people don't understand anything because we know you know the message all I love knowing you're here won't help you it's knowing it here is that right oh I'm coming by the grace of God because you got to understand that's what Jim was saying my brethren counted joy when you fall into divers temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience the trying of your revelation of who you are and who he is worketh patience is that right brother Brendan said when when the Lord took my wife and took my my son my daughter and took my daddy and took my mama he said my brother's flower was still a fresh only on his grave when all of these things were taking place and he said at that moment the devil came in says why are you following him see you don't preach healing and you don't did this and that the other hey but what about you huh you didn't did you know you don't gave him all your life but he don't care and he says you know what he sounded good he was right with his accusations hallelujah but something he said when all of the reasoning broke he said there was something steered there that's what I'm saying when the devil is tried to talk you out of this word and talk you out of Jesus amen something hose you hallelujah and that's what that his friend says bill ah how did you make it up you know uh I forgot how he said it now but anyway he said I didn't keep it it kept me that's the point this message keeps you oh that's that that's a lot brother when you see you can't go nowhere that God got you stuck like a magnet honey Oh God is that all right he said listen but let patience have a perfect word that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing right I was talking with a brother the other day I say these virtues that God trying to develop and make us grow up into you see so many people in the message ain't even studing about the virtues you don't mean they said well we don't need those you need those in order to make a rapture because God is only coming back for his character nothing more nothing less he don't care nothing about whose family he was born into he wants you in his family and these virtue after your faith not to strip all of these and guess what they're going to be tempered they're going to be chained up challenged challenged they will be challenged but you're gonna do all God I didn't get it today maybe tomorrow no sir I am right I am the elect lady it's not by power it's not by mind but it's by his spirit said the Lord and God who started the good work in me shall complete it that must be your attitude it has to be it can't be war with me I'm lost no sir if you truly given your heart to the Lord you cannot be lost you may not be considered bright but you cannot be lost and go to hell if you really gave your heart to the Lord because Jesus said he was the man confessed with his mouth believe in his heart that Jesus Christ is Savior that becomes your salvation and you have passed from death unto life you cannot cut that scripture out hallelujah God amen world is perfect hallelujah and God will bring to pass everything he said that's why I believe I am right I may not be living it now but before he comes I'll be right hallelujah he'll make everything right but it's no time to be double-minded will I make it up will I not make it here's I'm brought in my bride am I not bride mi Christian what man in his right man mine will submit to the thought that he's going to hell the only where you can go to hell as a Christian is that you believe that God's blood it ain't good enough hallelujah oh oh but there's still power in the blood somebody help here here and still power in the blood call it a god and it washes away all my sins is that right the Bible said he the blood shed was done once and for all that means when God shed it it was what yo now yo before your now in your present your future God took care of it by the blood who and it's still power in the blood ain't no use of being double-minded because of your double minded james says you will get nothing from God hallelujah let's let's have had that one mine hallelujah let's have the faith of Jesus Christ come on somebody think about it description you know what the faith of Jesus Christ is is that was delivered unto the same the faith the virtues the character hallelujah the Lambs nature is that right the prophet of God said Jesus Christ conquered Calvary with that lamb nature of sweetness and meekness hallelujah you and I you are all ER when you fuss you out of order when you argue you are the order when you scream and holler that's what the devil wants us to do hallelujah because it takes you out of the leaves nature and when that lives nature is out of you God pulls back hallelujah because the dog can only fellowship with the lamb hallelujah and so you and I must understand he meant that that nature in order for us to grow you got to be like Jesus when they railed him and mocked him and calling him and whatever they did he kept his mouth shut don't open your mouth never say say this don't say it the devil say do this don't do good walk away keep it shut because God is working on his building and that building is you think about it he they whipped him all night long for you and I for you and me is that right they whipped him and he didn't say a mumbling word he could have cost him all I had to do was move his finger like the Prophet said ten thousand eight it was about him but it was written of him not to open his mouth like a dumb sheep he allowed himself to be sheared by because the nature of God was in him and God believed his word and God obeys his word and no matter what God's Word must be obeyed it must become living Paul said with living epistles written in read of all men this message must be lived has to be lived and God has chosen you and me to live it so let's just die die to ourselves you gotta say god help me Lord yeah you say Lord whaat even Jesus when he got to a place where he seemed like he couldn't go any further he said Lord why his doubt forsaken me is that right because see brother branham said like this he said Jesus went the Calvary as a man he didn't go as God he went as a man because of you and me hallelujah he bared our suffering he bared our friction when they slapped him he slapped us when they cursed him they cursed us what are you saying if his nature is in you you can endure it you understand me it's proof it is proven already tested it won the victory it killed him he rose from the dead hallelujah he took that blood and he will I ended up in to help him come home and what did the angel say when he went to the gates when he says Oh gates be lifted up because the king of glory he whooped the devil he went the hella me whip the devil for you and me and he carried the purchaser prize that blood back up then says here it is this is the power in which I won the battle but was it it was the life of God Satan didn't understand it he wasn't just a man but the Bible said in him brought the fullness of the Godhead bodily in Christ Oh God dwelt the fullness of the Godhead in him is that right then brother branham comes along said all that was in God he poured it into Christ all that was in Christ he poured it into his church his bride that means a very life of Christ supposed to be on display hallelujah Paul had it so much so when the sons of Skiba tried to mimic Christianity hallelujah what happened to them they were filled with Devils but they said Paul I know Peter I know but who are you see but when you got the life of God in you amen even the devil know you know you by name and if the devil know you by name Jesus know you by name it's just okay here coming from the message scape here to come hither he says all but brother God always have indicates himself by being in the camp with supernatural signs and wonders God always make himself known he's supernatural and he cannot be anything or work anyway but through supernatural do you see it oh how I just love it now he said show me a miracle here's the first one in my life me that's how I know God lives he changed me and I know if he changed me he can change somebody else but this is a miracle I'm a walking talking miracle and so are you if you don't have no other testimony that one will always work hey man why because it was Christ who changed you you couldn't have changed yourself no man can add one cubit to his statue hmm hallelujah God electing you chose choosing you to receive this revelation of this hour look what he went through to get it to you hmm he hid it in a seventh grade seventh grade educated prophet Kentuckian prophet hallelujah he didn't have the Boston accent or the New York accent he had the Kentucky accent hallelujah and you know God hid that in simplicity ha because he came into an intellectual age God hid it in a dumb man I hope you don't mind me saying that but the problem the truth of the matter was God took that man and outshine every preacher of his day nobody could touch him why because he had God failed on the inside but it wasn't just him God brought that same anointing back to the bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah that's right as God was mainly the Prophet God was to be veiled in his bride Oh somebody help me here whew you know the Lord he said I want you to notice from Cain lineage was religious and he was just as religious as Abel was he was just as sincere as Abel was he was just as fundamental as Abel was but there went but here where the difference was he didn't have the revelation see that's been it all alone Jesus cry I said in Matthew 16 when he came down from the Mount of Transfiguration I believe it was and he said who does man say I the Son of Man a.m. hallelujah that is the revelation not in a 2000 year ago Jesus for the Jesus of today he's just in a different body but he's the same yesterday today and forever he cannot change that's what I love about God hallelujah he's identified by his word whatever he said yesterday he means it today and it will always be the same hallelujah and if they got the Holy Ghost yesterday you can that meet you in the air today and how you know you got the Holy Ghost cuz in a bring a change hmm come on somebody is like turning on the light switch the Bob is there you can't see nothing but the BA but turn that light on then you see the supernatural hallelujah and that's how God is hallelujah once the light is turned on in you it would draw people will be able to see it you don't have to wear it they will see it not like something wrong with wearing it hallelujah but it is God who you want people to see hallelujah it's okay but here where the difference was he didn't have the revelation that's been it all alone Jesus Christ said in Matthew 16 when he came down from the mountain of Transfiguration I believe it was he said what who do men say I am the son of man he's it all said thou art the Prophet once a year so and so he said but who do you say I am Peter said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God do you know what Peter was saying because you know the Jews understood that when the Messiah would come it would be God Himself is that I say I said it his name will be called Emmanuel which means God with us the government will be upon his shoulders so P understood when he called him and said thou are the christ cut Peter no the Jews can only believe in one God hallelujah and if he called him the Christ which is the Anointed One he was calling him God in flesh that right now listen I'm going on I'm almost done in a little bit I didn't plan to be long but I want you to understand by God's grace that if we are elected my point is this I don't criticize but I'm learning how to feel sorry when people don't see if I see is because God ordained it to be so is God's mercy and God's grace but when other people can't see it they can't see you can't snap a blind man and say why can't you see right she is God who gives that sight you and I can't give it hallelujah you understand me those other disciples did not have the revelation Peter had at that time but God eventually gave it to her why because jesus said it is given to you to know the mystery so I don't worry about the revelations I need to make a rapture because it was given to me and that my his appointed time for me it's gonna flood in my soul you might get it before me but you ain't going nowhere without me ah because I'm gonna get it just like you it was ordained by God not by power not by might but by my spirit hmm whew greater than Solomon he's now they had two ways of knowing whether a man was right first they had a law they're the Ten Commandments but if a prophet prophesied a dreamer dreamer dream they had another way of finding it you know we know that was the year my theory no matter how good it sound they had a way of supernatural God always vindicate himself don't forget this see God vindicates himself by supernatural and that's been throughout all the ages hello when brother Brad was going through the seven churches how did he know who was who and what was what because the true believers always had supernatural following even in the dark ages that little bloodline he followed the bloodline because wherever the blood is there is supernatural things going on that's why these message people you know they come around in the town that don't want to kill you they want to make you starchy they want to make you an intellectual group that's death with a capital D is that right Bob because wherever God is is that right the Prophet God's wherever Jesus is there is a lot of noise but they say Shh oh no sure make your noise you might as well start it up here because over there it's gonna be full volume yeah the hard that's right brother full volume upon this rock I build my church what was it the revelation of who Jesus Christ is it wasn't Peter and it wasn't just Jesus it was a revelation of who he was hallelujah and that same thing is today it wasn't about William Branham it was who he was housing is the revelation of the prophet of who he was not the man but was in the man hey somebody if you miss that you miss Jesus he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah when they closed him out of the church where did the word go right to revelations the third chapter I stand at the door and knock he said but they wouldn't open up to me those organizations and denominations refused me but they didn't understand that the me wasn't the man it was Jesus hiding himself in simplicity that's why when God comes in you and people mistreat you in a unit mistreating is God they're mistreating you love the Lord now he's hidden in his bride hallelujah and guess what just like the age didn't see Jesus they didn't see William read him they won't see you either only those who are elected to see Christ and you will see it he's the same yesterday today and forever you can be right there or they say oh he's a nice brother he's a nice sister I think he's a little fanatical but he's all right I guess don't even know that's Jesus manifesting himself and don't ever be ashamed to be a Christian don't you ever drop your hair because you're in this message I don't care what they say about William Branham I don't care how they get high you know what they say about his name they did the same to Jesus they said Jesus is a devil he was born in fornication halle-loo he's the son of BL about you know what I'm saying it was bad to blind the unbeliever and everything that has been done in the way of this prophet has been said and done to blind the unbeliever but we don't look at flesh and blood' hallelujah we can see when nobody else can see Oh somebody help me here oh he said listen this is where I want to hear it the devil because the devil you know because you know we're not producing maybe we're not don't you understand even in a field of corn all corn do not ripen at the same time some ripen fast some ripen slow summers like mid or whatever but the point is it's still corn and if it stay there long enough it's going to ripen under normal conditions y'all know what I'm saying so you look at this thing so what do you mean brother I'm trying to tell the elect later I got it oh if God just helped me to Sunday I've got Wu but anyway if the Lord would just you know let us see that this is harvest time harvest that means you got to ripen you don't have an option but brother branham told her how to ripen lay in the presence of the Sun hallelujah lay before those tapes lay before that book lay before your Bible let God be tall the greening you're out of you don't don't get upset with God working on you if the Potter wanna beat you and make you over give let him do it whatever he do for me I'll be satisfied whatever he do for me I'll be satisfied that's my prayer I don't have to like what he's doing but I'm glad he's doing it oh oh Lord I love this I love this some time ago I made it making an altar call for the round said I love John 5:24 he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me has eternal life and shall not come into the judgment but had passed from death unto life he that believeth now listen no that's pretty deep I need y'all to listen no that's pretty deep but when you believe no man can call Jesus of Christ only by the Holy Spirit and when you have the Holy Spirit then you have believed on the eternal life and have eternal life right he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me has eternal life and shall not come into the judgment but has passed from death unto life preparation making ready so what are you saying when a man or woman really believe in their heart and accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior if they die today they're saying whoo that may not be all message but its word hallelujah it is to true you say prove it to me the thief on the cross nobody likes going there hallelujah but what did he do but believe and have faith that Jesus was the Lamb huh that's all Abraham he was the lamb was revealed to him it was revealed it's the sharing of blood it's for the remission of sin and this lamb has taken your place and because the lamb tooks Abel's praise the Bible said his voice still lived and cried out from the grave see a lot of time we want to put people in here because we don't understand it I'm gonna tell you something you can be totally insane and have the Holy Ghost and make heaven oh come on somebody let me ask you a question election is more powerful than that hmm election would cover every problem y'all hear me you said what do you mean Solomon died a backslider with Solomon be there saw mister real man died in war was he saved oh they knew your God yo I tell you what this is what I love about it God really have a little favor owed to you he favors you did you know he favors the elect lady come Peter denied him three times Judas one time and Peter was given the key look at all the mess David did and yet God loved him still we're not giving a license to sin but whatever we do whenever we do it the blood prevails God cleanses us from all unrighteousness I can see him I have faith because God is the only way I'll make it a rapture is that I believe in what he did for me was enough hallelujah is that right what Jesus did for me is enough not what I do is what he did and how I know he favored me because he opened my eyes to this message he said blessed is the man that's the book of Revelation blessed is the man I'm blessed you're blessed come on you will have troubles oh yes you are and you're gonna be tried and you're gonna be tested oh yes you are you might fall sick but all it doesn't matter when it's all over right you're gonna have battles in between a and B but at the end of B you eternal the devil won't like that he that's what about that many other flick scenes of the righteous but God delivers them out of them all the devil can he hates you brother cuz that word cannot come back boy and when you've gone through inflictions you gotta say God you said you will deliver me out of this I can't remain because I am a righteous man what does a righteous man a man that does right all the time no he knows what being right is but he has the ability to repent when he's wrong somebody help me here is that Alright you and I must realize by God's grace because what God has done for us the Bible says no weapon jaw even as a sword way down the road he's that no weapon formed against you shall prosper none and you got to realize you've made a lot of mistakes and the devil got you on record but his record don't even account hallelujah when his under the blood of Jesus ain't nothing being held against you but you can remember it but God cannot hallelujah yeah the stable of say you favored you directed your chosen hallelujah it doesn't mean that you when you see grace you know like I said I had y'all listen go listen to the message of grace I'll tell you what it it changed me it did something you know I've heard that message many time but this is the season you know because we're pressing folks we're in the air it just seemed like a season where we're making a lot of mistakes well maybe I'm the only one but nevertheless it is so much pressure it's so much everything out there seem like you falling and making mistakes every day your God forgive me Lord I didn't mean to think like that love forgive me oh I didn't mean to say it that way it's constant hallelujah but you doing that only because you're covered by the blood if you wasn't covered by the blood you wouldn't care about it but because you're covered by the blood you stream out Lord deliver me help me Jesus Oh glory to God give me a few more minutes hallelujah so I'm sixteen nine through eleven says therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoices my flesh also shall rest in hope for thou will not leave my soul in Hell neither without suffer thine Holy One to see corruption thou will show me the path of life and in the presence of full and he see me in thy presence is fullness of joy at the right hand there are pleasures forevermore Jesus did you know he had to believe that he believed this so much he said if you destroy destroy this temple in three days and I raise it up they thought he was talking about Solomon's Temple he was talking about his body MA because this scripture says he ain't gonna remain there ah neither will I let his flesh see corruption come on and neither will I leave it's all in hell he descended well in hell for who you he knew he was gone there did you know he would go he knew he was going to hell when Jesus he knew he was going to hell because the scripture said he was going but he also knew that he went go stay there [Laughter] he knew he was going down that for who you and me he went to hell for you and me that's why we can't not go to hell because he's already went there for us hallelujah he is our lamb he is our refugee a refuge he is our leader oh that's why it's so good to receive the Holy Ghost because when you receive the Holy Ghost it does God accept in you and when you accept you you are accepted it doesn't matter what anybody said oh you ain't smart enough to go to heaven you ain't holy enough to go to heaven you ain't righteous enough to go to heaven it doesn't matter what you say I'm accepted hello it's like being accepted in Harvard or Yale somebody might think that they're better than you they deserve to get there but it doesn't matter the boy has already met they don't sit my level level of acceptance and ain't nothing you can do about it right that's how it is with God I hope I'm not hanging to like acting out of I can't help it I'm really full of joy why because the devil is defeated me defeated you love the Lord you see even Peter began to preach it it showed in acts 2 I'm gonna read it to 30 26 to 36 about how God would not leave his soul in hell is that right and how God would raise him up and and that therefore being by the right hand of God how God will just you know he was sent down the Holy Ghost by Jesus Christ and then Peter began to say therefore let all Israel know assuredly that God has made that same Jesus whom you have crucified both Lord and Christ think about it folks brother Branham was preaching this for a long time until he was out there I think he was hunting and he saw those three rainbows all three of them coming together he said they were moving like they were living he said they were live because it was God and he said Jehovah of the Old Testament it's Jesus you gotta know this thing and if you are Dane you will see it it doesn't come by studying it comes by believing have faith is that right the Lord of God I'm gonna stop but you know what I want you to realize by God's grace when this vision according to Rebecca was given he said Habakkuk says now this vision is for the appointed time it's coming but when it comes it won't carry let him that read run if there be a time you and I should be running more toward God this is that high if there's a time when we should be praying as much as we could possibly pray this is the time right oh listen because he said it ain't gonna wait on you it's not waiting on you it's coming and it will not wait if anything you and I need to be pressing and saying God have mercy strip me kill me whatever it takes to make a rapture for these Christ to be seen in us and what I'm saying is that don't mean that God is gonna fill you up and then have you raising the dead yeah yeah I don't want you to think that God is building you into that kind of a Superman God is building you into a character right and people say oh when I make the wraps I got this from my brother and I love this he said listen the rapture is not just for your escaping Oh Lord sin the rapture because I'm tired of suffering oh the rapture says be the cake is ready it's done right now hear them saying and when you get done God is ready to move is that right is that right he said listen I can't even move to the righteous is out of Sodom I'm a signifier it's prophesy it is known but I can't work until he out of there and God cannot have a wedding supper until the bride has made herself ready when you and I become ready don't worry about it he's gonna have to help us you know what I'm saying you see you said what I mean because God said he were gonna cut this time sure that means he's gonna turn the heat up a little bit to help you to get done he gonna turn the heat up right it's time to but just you we're moving too slow you know because we've been slugging for a long time it's all it's time for slugging to stop so god don't turn the heat and where the pressure gonna come from the same pressure same place that came it's gonna come from the political realm and the religious realm because what they were setting the stage up for the crucifixion and that's where our pressure will be coming from political realm and religious realm and so I'm going to tell you this everything they said about Jesus wasn't true so they're going to be lies toll on you just like they were told on him mmm they're gonna be people that gonna make a case oh lord help me Jesus you got to realize they meant that God has it all under control and guess what they gonna understand they're stoning you and you smiling like Stephen y'all understand me that's bride material that's elected that's chosen I love Stephen because Stephen makes me see what I am to become the character I am to become I can see Jesus but now I see Jesus and his name was Steven I love it that's you the revelation of the hour you are God in you you you and I must exemplify Jesus Christ if we want this message to materialize and to become real in us we must have faith in it and believe it no matter what it looks like Abraham you saw old man you back then got twice pumped over you know to me but Abraham said nevertheless God said so and at that appointed time Sarah looked at Abraham who you looking good over there was happening changes began to make yeah I heard brother barely say something almost exactly what I just said I'm not being blasphemous all or whatever he see God looking like oh yeah all of a sudden you know this beautiful woman she's transformed and that was an example like I try to tell people they don't agree with me I said well when God sounded out those seven thunders in that blast if I said in Revelations there was a blast there was one thunder you know and when that happened but the venom was translated people said oh no yes he was he said I was caught up now his flesh wasn't up there but something he connected with that took him there because the Bob said no flesh and blood shall enter in he comes back down God brought him back where he was he took a trip like Paul come back down to the earth and brought us these seven seals and in these messages he said would give us raptor in-phase what is Raptor in faith other than Raptor in grace it is the grace of God that gives you the faith to believe the word for your day who Jesus is and most of all who you are in relation to him there's all to Jesus we don't care you we're gonna stone you cuz you being a man make it yourself car but what they didn't understand it was God making himself a man and that's what he's doing now God making himself a man or woman however you want to put it call her bride but she takes his character she takes his strength she takes his nature and she becomes him only by the grace of God only by election right you love the Lord [Music] keeping me alive [Music] it's keeping me alive your song [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] challenge you hallelujah [Music] I am the God who healeth thee if you have affliction tonight know that the flick shion's of the righteous are many but God
