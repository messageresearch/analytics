[55:54] [Music]
[55:56] friend.
[55:58] Hallelujah. Can't nobody do me like
[56:02] Jesus.
[56:03] Hallelujah. God is good to us. Amen.
[56:07] Amen. And we thank God for his amazing
[56:16] grace. We started on a
[56:18] message on
[56:21] Sunday going beyond this dimension
[56:27] and we were trying to tell the people
[56:32] that we need to go higher in God.
[56:39] The first place in the first
[56:43] place we must learn to know who we are.
[56:47] I believe once we come to know who we
[56:51] are we will become an invincible
[56:55] army. Those are the words of our
[56:57] prophet. Amen.
[56:59] And I believe within our
[57:01] hearts, in order for us to go any
[57:05] further, we must first recognize our
[57:09] freedom. If you don't feel
[57:12] free, you're in
[57:14] bondage and you can't do what God wants
[57:17] you to
[57:18] do. But when you know that you
[57:22] know, amen, that you're
[57:24] free, then nothing can hold you back.
[57:28] Amen. Amen. Amen. Let's read by the
[57:31] grace of God as we stand.
[57:35] First Corinthians 8 and six.
[57:46] But to us there is but one God, the
[57:51] Father of whom are all things. Amen. We
[57:55] in
[57:56] him and one Lord Jesus Christ by whom
[58:00] are all things and we by him.
[58:16] Hebrews 2,
[58:19] we'll read 8 and 10.
[58:24] The important point or place in the
[58:28] scripture I want
[58:30] to emphasize tonight is that we are in
[58:35] him.
[58:37] Hallelujah. Amen. We are in him.
[58:44] Yes. Hebrews 2
[58:48] 8 through10.
[58:50] Thou has put all things in subjection
[58:53] under his feet. Hallelujah.
[58:58] For in that he put all in subjection
[59:00] under him, he left nothing that is not
[59:04] put under him. Amen.
[59:11] But now we see not yet all things put
[59:14] under him.
[59:20] But we see Jesus
[59:23] who was made a little lower than the
[59:25] angels for the suffering of death,
[59:28] crowned with glory and honor that he may
[59:33] that he by the grace of God should taste
[59:36] death for every man.
[59:53] Let us pray. Father God, we thank you
[59:55] for your grace and your mercy. We thank
[59:58] you for being so good to
[1:00:00] us. You are the only living
[1:00:03] God and we thank you, Father God, for
[1:00:06] giving us the grace and the mercy to
[1:00:10] know you.
[1:00:12] It is so
[1:00:15] wonderful knowing you because I know you
[1:00:18] know us.
[1:00:20] You know our down sitting.
[1:00:23] You know our getting
[1:00:25] up. You know when we go in and we go
[1:00:29] out. You know the beginning of our
[1:00:32] days and you know the ending of our
[1:00:35] days. For you are God. And we worship
[1:00:38] you tonight. We thank you for your word.
[1:00:42] Hallelujah. We thank you for being so
[1:00:44] good to us.
[1:00:46] Lord, we stand here
[1:00:49] tonight expectation
[1:00:52] to hear from you in your lovely name
[1:00:55] Jesus Christ. Speak to our hearts in
[1:00:58] Jesus Christ's name. Change us from
[1:01:02] glory to glory, Lord. Hallelujah. and
[1:01:05] we'll be careful to give you the praise,
[1:01:08] glory, and honor. In Jesus Christ's name
[1:01:10] we pray.
[1:01:13] Amen. Amen. You may be seated.
[1:01:18] So, I decided by the grace of God to
[1:01:22] be here on
[1:01:24] Sunday because of um our brother
[1:01:30] Keith passing on to be with the
[1:01:33] Lord. I have a powerful testimony I'd
[1:01:36] like to
[1:01:38] share, but I will share that on Sunday.
[1:01:44] I saw him a little
[1:01:46] while before he went on to be with the
[1:01:50] Lord. Hallelujah. You love the Lord.
[1:01:56] The Bible says in that 10th
[1:01:59] verse, for it became him,
[1:02:04] of whom are all things,
[1:02:09] and by whom are all things. Amen.
[1:02:13] and bringing many sons unto
[1:02:17] glory to make the captain of their
[1:02:19] salvation
[1:02:23] perfect suffering.
[1:02:26] So I want to bring this in a
[1:02:29] way that you understand though you be
[1:02:33] free it doesn't make you free from
[1:02:35] suffering
[1:02:37] because the Bible
[1:02:39] said that Jesus learned his obedience
[1:02:44] through the things in which he
[1:02:47] suffered and we can enjoy the joy of the
[1:02:50] Lord, the joy of the peace of God and
[1:02:54] the blessings of
[1:02:55] God. But we must
[1:02:58] realize in order to come to
[1:03:02] perfection you must
[1:03:04] bear your greatest enemy as the prophet
[1:03:07] of God
[1:03:08] says is you. It's not the devil, it's
[1:03:13] you. We now understand that better. Now
[1:03:18] we must understand if our lives are hid
[1:03:20] in
[1:03:22] Christ in Christ. Brother explained that
[1:03:26] he said being under the blood, God don't
[1:03:30] see
[1:03:31] us but he hears that
[1:03:34] voice. I love that because if we can
[1:03:38] understand we are truly free.
[1:03:41] We let our flesh dictate to us. We let
[1:03:44] our flesh condemn
[1:03:46] us. The Bible says there is no
[1:03:50] condemnation to walk not after the flesh
[1:03:52] but after the
[1:03:53] spirit. So if you are walking after the
[1:03:56] spirit of
[1:03:57] God, you should not allow the devil to
[1:04:00] live in you because you're full of his
[1:04:03] holy
[1:04:04] spirit. Christ lives in you
[1:04:08] who is the hope of glory.
[1:04:11] Hallelujah. Glory to God. You love the
[1:04:13] Lord. We must understand having a good
[1:04:16] conscience
[1:04:18] means that we really believe the
[1:04:21] word. You understand me? Having a good
[1:04:25] conscience is also being able to hear
[1:04:28] the
[1:04:29] word because everybody can hear the
[1:04:33] word. Just a simple in just a simple
[1:04:37] message. Everybody can't see Acts
[1:04:41] 2:38 though it is right there in the
[1:04:43] book.
[1:04:45] But those who have a good conscience,
[1:04:48] those God has given a good
[1:04:51] conscience. They are able to see the
[1:04:55] word. They act upon the
[1:04:59] word. Really simple. I told a brother
[1:05:02] one time, "If you really want the Holy
[1:05:06] Ghost, the real Holy Ghost, follow Acts
[1:05:11] 2:38. Repent, be baptized in the name of
[1:05:15] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[1:05:18] sins. You shall receive the gift of the
[1:05:21] Holy Ghost." Hallelujah. But you got to
[1:05:25] repent. You can't get it without
[1:05:28] repenting. Hallelujah. And that means
[1:05:30] you you're
[1:05:32] determined to turn
[1:05:34] around for God to change your life that
[1:05:37] you presently
[1:05:39] live to a life of
[1:05:43] godliness. Now coming from the
[1:05:46] message, God provided place of worship
[1:05:52] 1965 0425.
[1:05:56] Hallelujah. Paragraph 155.
[1:06:02] No.
[1:06:08] Okay. Now remember in Christ
[1:06:12] we are flesh of flesh,
[1:06:15] bone of his bone.
[1:06:18] When God wounded Christ at Calvary,
[1:06:21] he was wounded for me and
[1:06:23] you. We are flesh of his flesh
[1:06:27] and bone of his bone, body of his body,
[1:06:32] name of his name,
[1:06:35] bride of him. See, we are in him. We are
[1:06:39] flesh and we are his flesh and his
[1:06:43] bones. Do you understand that? That
[1:06:47] means if God going to see, he's seeing
[1:06:50] through your eyes.
[1:06:52] He's walking in your shoes.
[1:06:55] Hallelujah. That's right. When you are
[1:06:58] unified with
[1:07:00] God, you become the very living
[1:07:03] temple of the Holy
[1:07:05] God. Now, I'm not trying to mess with
[1:07:07] your
[1:07:08] mind. This is this must become a
[1:07:12] reality. When this becomes a reality, it
[1:07:15] is when you know then no weapon formed
[1:07:19] against you shall
[1:07:20] prosper. Hallelujah. It doesn't matter
[1:07:23] what Satan brings to you. You know that
[1:07:26] God has full control,
[1:07:29] not the God that's in heaven, the God
[1:07:32] that's in you.
[1:07:34] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And God has
[1:07:38] already raised us up
[1:07:43] potentially. The quickening power that
[1:07:46] raised us from a life of
[1:07:49] sin. It changed our
[1:07:51] being. It has the potential. It has
[1:07:55] potentially raised us up in Christ
[1:07:59] Jesus which the resurrection will bring
[1:08:02] us in the full
[1:08:04] [Applause]
[1:08:05] maturity. You can't do it. God is Christ
[1:08:09] in you that's bringing you fully into
[1:08:13] maturity. Little by
[1:08:16] little. Hallelujah. We're possessing
[1:08:19] this
[1:08:20] land. He says, "Now remember, we died in
[1:08:24] our own
[1:08:27] name and raised in
[1:08:30] his will no more of our
[1:08:34] own." of which that great name of Jesus
[1:08:39] Christ which the Bible said over here in
[1:08:42] Ephesians
[1:08:45] 1:21 that both families
[1:08:49] in heaven and in
[1:08:50] earth is named after that
[1:08:53] name that whether that's where God puts
[1:08:58] his
[1:08:59] name that's the family name in
[1:09:02] heaven that's the family name on
[1:09:07] earth. Do we you
[1:09:10] see you got to go beyond
[1:09:14] even what I'm
[1:09:16] saying that that the word is a spirit.
[1:09:20] The word is
[1:09:22] life. And you can't listen to this with
[1:09:25] your head. You must listen with your
[1:09:28] heart. Is that right? For the Bible
[1:09:31] said, "As he
[1:09:33] thinkketh in his heart, so is
[1:09:36] he." If you if you in this third
[1:09:40] dimension and that's all you
[1:09:43] know, you you're not going to get
[1:09:47] anywhere. Some people don't know that
[1:09:50] God is there or here unless they feel
[1:09:54] him. I don't have to feel God.
[1:09:58] Some people think if I don't see him, I
[1:10:02] don't have to see him. I don't have to
[1:10:03] taste him. I don't have to smell him. I
[1:10:06] know he's here because his Bible says
[1:10:09] so. And the Bible also tell me he's so
[1:10:12] much here. He's living in me. He's
[1:10:16] living in
[1:10:17] you. We must
[1:10:19] focus if we're going to see a rapture.
[1:10:26] The bride will have no spot, wrinkle or
[1:10:29] blemish. That means she believed the
[1:10:31] word for her
[1:10:32] day. She really believed the word for
[1:10:35] her
[1:10:36] day. She focuses on the word for her
[1:10:40] day. Hallelujah. Your
[1:10:43] focus creates your reality.
[1:10:48] You understand me? Whatever you think
[1:10:50] you are, that's who you are.
[1:10:54] Oh, come on. If you think you are a
[1:10:56] failure, that's what you
[1:10:59] are. Hallelujah. If you think you are a
[1:11:02] hypocrite, that's what you are.
[1:11:05] But if you believe and know that you are
[1:11:07] son of God,
[1:11:10] hallelujah, and understand the
[1:11:12] scriptures, as I said last
[1:11:15] week, as far as the east is from the
[1:11:19] west, Psalm
[1:11:22] 103:12, Hallelujah. As far as the east
[1:11:25] is from the
[1:11:27] west, so have he removed our
[1:11:31] transgressions from us. Oh, it's the
[1:11:35] truth. Why are you
[1:11:37] burdened? Because as long as you are in
[1:11:40] this flesh, you're going to make
[1:11:42] mistakes.
[1:11:44] But God got you covered. Hallelujah. The
[1:11:48] blood of Jesus Christ has washed me, has
[1:11:52] cleansed me. It justifies me. It
[1:11:56] sanctifies me. It fills me with his Holy
[1:11:59] Spirit. See, I've got to say this. that
[1:12:03] Jesus Christ must become your all in
[1:12:06] all in order for you to make these
[1:12:11] transitions. We do not have a different
[1:12:14] Holy
[1:12:15] Ghost than they had on the day of
[1:12:17] Pentecost. We do not have a different
[1:12:20] Holy
[1:12:21] Ghost that God gave William Brandon.
[1:12:25] Hallelujah. That same spirit,
[1:12:29] that's what the Bible said. If that same
[1:12:32] spirit dwells in you,
[1:12:36] hallelujah. Hallelujah. It will quicken
[1:12:38] your mortal body.
[1:12:41] Hallelujah. You've got to walk in
[1:12:43] freedom.
[1:12:44] Oh, come on, somebody. Forget about your
[1:12:47] flesh.
[1:12:49] And think about the inner man.
[1:12:52] Hallelujah. You got to think about the
[1:12:55] inner man. What is the inner man doing?
[1:12:58] What is the inner man saying?
[1:13:01] What does the inner man what does he
[1:13:03] want from you? What is it? Hallelujah.
[1:13:07] What he wants is for you to walk with
[1:13:10] him. That's what it's all about. Calvary
[1:13:13] came to restore
[1:13:15] relationship. Calvary came to restore
[1:13:19] fellowship. Hallelujah. Calvary came to
[1:13:22] produce his own that they may do exactly
[1:13:26] the things he did when he walked on the
[1:13:29] earth. This is the last age. There's not
[1:13:33] coming
[1:13:34] another. And God has chosen
[1:13:37] you because he believe and know. You
[1:13:41] see, God has faith in his own
[1:13:43] word and you are his word. Hallelujah.
[1:13:47] And he knows that you're going to make
[1:13:50] it
[1:13:51] even when you don't know.
[1:13:54] Hallelujah. Is that all right? Isaiah 65
[1:13:57] and 24.
[1:13:59] How many times? How many times we fail
[1:14:02] to pray?
[1:14:05] Amen. Amen. And God still answer prayer.
[1:14:10] You didn't even pray about it.
[1:14:12] You thought about it. Y'all been hear
[1:14:15] what I'm saying?
[1:14:16] Amen. And God still gave it to you.
[1:14:20] Hallelujah. We love to pray, but prayer
[1:14:23] don't save you.
[1:14:27] This is all about election.
[1:14:30] Y'all better hear what I'm saying.
[1:14:33] As I say, we're favored.
[1:14:38] We're favored. I don't care what I go
[1:14:40] through. I'm favored.
[1:14:44] That's right.
[1:14:46] Peter cursed God three times.
[1:14:49] Hallelujah.
[1:14:50] Is that right? He cursed three times. I
[1:14:53] don't know the man.
[1:14:58] I don't know the man. Hallelujah.
[1:15:02] And then Judas.
[1:15:04] One time.
[1:15:06] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Think about even
[1:15:08] the things. And I I'm not telling
[1:15:11] anybody to go out and sin
[1:15:14] because if there if you sin, there is a
[1:15:16] reward.
[1:15:18] Hallelujah. You going to be spanked. God
[1:15:21] is going to deal with you son and
[1:15:24] daughter. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But
[1:15:26] you got to realize that God still have
[1:15:29] more mercy on
[1:15:31] you than he does to sinner. The Bible
[1:15:34] says, "If it had not been for the
[1:15:36] mercies of
[1:15:37] God, it would not be Hallelujah." Isaiah
[1:15:43] 25:24, "And it shall come to
[1:15:47] pass that before they
[1:15:49] call, I will answer. And while they are
[1:15:53] yet
[1:15:54] speaking, I will
[1:15:56] hear." Hallelujah. Y'all believe that? I
[1:16:00] believe it with all my heart. How many
[1:16:03] times God has answered my prayer
[1:16:07] while I was speaking?
[1:16:11] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But you got to
[1:16:13] free yourself from
[1:16:15] condemnation. That is the biggest thing
[1:16:17] that we hold. Satan holds on us. We make
[1:16:21] a mistake and then he brings a
[1:16:24] condemnation. But you got to
[1:16:27] believe. The scripture says there is no
[1:16:31] condemnation.
[1:16:33] Y'all better understand what I'm saying.
[1:16:35] When you allow yourself to be
[1:16:38] condemned, that means you're allowing
[1:16:40] yourself to feel
[1:16:41] lost. How can you feel
[1:16:44] lost when God has saved
[1:16:47] you? Hallelujah. God didn't save you to
[1:16:50] lose
[1:16:51] you. Hallelujah. Like I said, the word
[1:16:54] will correct you. But it's not here to
[1:16:58] condemn you. Hallelujah. It is God who
[1:17:02] justifies. Who shall lay any charge to
[1:17:05] God's
[1:17:06] elect? Y'all better understand it. God
[1:17:08] said, "I justify
[1:17:10] and those whom I
[1:17:12] justify, I glorify."
[1:17:15] Who's going to lay any charge to God?
[1:17:18] Hallelujah. Nobody can do it. Even the
[1:17:21] devil tried to to do that in front of
[1:17:23] God with his long
[1:17:24] list. Hallelujah. Long list and with all
[1:17:28] that he present before God.
[1:17:31] In God's list, there is nothing.
[1:17:34] Hallelujah. Why? Because everything has
[1:17:36] been washed
[1:17:38] away. Satan has no
[1:17:41] evidence to condemn you
[1:17:44] with you under the blood.
[1:17:47] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And as that song
[1:17:49] say, under the blood.
[1:17:53] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, we we we we
[1:17:55] pity ourselves. Why?
[1:17:58] You're the true queen of heaven.
[1:18:01] You understand
[1:18:02] me?
[1:18:04] Generation. This generation is going to
[1:18:06] take her
[1:18:07] rapture. I don't know about you, but I'm
[1:18:09] making
[1:18:11] that. Hallelujah. And now that Keith has
[1:18:14] gone on home. I'm looking forward to
[1:18:16] seeing him again.
[1:18:20] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. St. John 14 1-6.
[1:18:26] Amen. You love the Lord. No
[1:18:29] condemnation. People come to condemn
[1:18:31] you, you tell him a
[1:18:34] liar. You are a liar. But the Bible
[1:18:38] said, "No weapon shall be formed against
[1:18:39] you shall prosper and nobody in the
[1:18:43] judgment will be able to judge me."
[1:18:47] Hallelujah. You know why? I was judged
[1:18:49] with
[1:18:50] him. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. When Jesus
[1:18:54] was
[1:18:54] judged, our judgment upon
[1:18:57] him with his stripes we are healed.
[1:19:01] I'm not a sick Christian. Somebody help
[1:19:04] me. I'm not a sick Christian, but I'm a
[1:19:07] healthy
[1:19:08] Christian. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Not
[1:19:10] just in my flesh, but in my
[1:19:14] soul. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. How you'd
[1:19:16] say that, brother? Because God conquered
[1:19:19] it all.
[1:19:21] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Every
[1:19:24] sickness, every piece of death,
[1:19:27] everything Satan could put on him.
[1:19:31] And guess where? Guess what? When he was
[1:19:33] conquering the devil, I was in
[1:19:36] him in
[1:19:37] him. Listen, if we could see what I'm
[1:19:40] seeing, it's on another plane. So, what
[1:19:44] do you mean, brother? Just like Jesus
[1:19:46] said, as a man thinks, he said, "If a
[1:19:50] man look upon a
[1:19:52] woman, he took that same thing that was
[1:19:56] the law and took it up
[1:19:58] higher." You understand
[1:20:01] me? And what Jesus did, he said those
[1:20:05] things, he put
[1:20:07] everybody on the same plane in the same
[1:20:12] pot.
[1:20:14] You better hear what I'm saying. But God
[1:20:16] has a remedy.
[1:20:18] [Laughter]
[1:20:21] He is the one that's going to take He is
[1:20:23] taking us
[1:20:25] higher. The world can't see
[1:20:28] Jesus. But it's necessary for you to see
[1:20:34] Jesus. You are the mystery of
[1:20:38] God. Christ in you.
[1:20:42] Amen.
[1:20:44] Hallelujah.
[1:20:48] Let not your heart be troubled.
[1:20:52] You believe in God,
[1:20:54] believe also in me. And we always say
[1:20:57] that at
[1:20:59] funerals, don't let your heart be
[1:21:04] troubled. Y'all understand what he's
[1:21:05] saying? In other words, don't let it be
[1:21:09] troubled.
[1:21:11] Let me say that again. Don't let it be
[1:21:13] trouble.
[1:21:16] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We we we don't
[1:21:18] we don't get
[1:21:20] depressed when somebody die. We don't
[1:21:22] grieve like we're sinners
[1:21:26] grieve. Oh, we cry. We're broken. It
[1:21:29] hurts, but we move on
[1:21:32] up because we have a greater
[1:21:35] hope.
[1:21:37] Hallelujah. We can serve. We can see it.
[1:21:40] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:21:43] Now I I can say it like this. If Abraham
[1:21:47] was be was able to see a
[1:21:49] city was building and make of God.
[1:21:53] You mean to tell me you can't see your
[1:21:54] loved ones over
[1:21:58] there? Abraham saw a
[1:22:01] city builder and maker was God. He was a
[1:22:05] different dimension people.
[1:22:08] Hallelujah. He had a different
[1:22:12] vibration. Y'all better hear what I'm
[1:22:13] saying. He was on a different frequency.
[1:22:18] And real
[1:22:20] Christians, they walk on that in that
[1:22:23] frequency. That's why God calls us
[1:22:27] peculiar. That's why God said you are
[1:22:31] strangers. That means you are strange to
[1:22:34] the
[1:22:35] world. Amen.
[1:22:39] I don't mind being strange.
[1:22:43] In my father's house are many
[1:22:46] mansions. If so, I would have told
[1:22:50] you prepare a place for you.
[1:22:53] You know, brother Brandham said, "Those
[1:22:55] mansions are palaces. In my kingdom, my
[1:22:59] kingdom." Hallelujah. And if I go and
[1:23:01] prepare a place for
[1:23:03] you, I will come again and receive your
[1:23:07] command. And where I am, there you may
[1:23:10] be
[1:23:12] also on
[1:23:14] earth. Don't believe there's another
[1:23:18] dimension. Jesus just said it.
[1:23:22] I'm going to prepare a place for
[1:23:24] you that where I am, there you might be
[1:23:28] also.
[1:23:30] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He told
[1:23:32] Nicodemus, "You can't even see what I'm
[1:23:34] talking about unless you be born again.
[1:23:38] You got to come up
[1:23:40] higher. Let the Holy Spirit take you
[1:23:44] higher. Shake up the bands of worry and
[1:23:48] fear. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to
[1:23:51] God." You know, when you worry, you get
[1:23:53] sick.
[1:23:56] And where I go, you know.
[1:23:58] And the way you know,
[1:24:02] Thomas said unto him,
[1:24:05] "Brother, brother, you got to understand
[1:24:07] Jesus was talking from another dimension
[1:24:12] because he's telling Thomas, you
[1:24:15] know, you know, but Thomas had a he had
[1:24:18] a theophony." You know what I'm
[1:24:20] saying? He said, "You may not know now,
[1:24:22] but you know."
[1:24:26] Hallelujah.
[1:24:28] right? Whether thou goest, and how can
[1:24:31] we know the
[1:24:33] way? Jesus said, "I am the way, the
[1:24:37] truth, and the life, and no man cometh
[1:24:40] unto the
[1:24:41] father but by me." Amen. He wasn't
[1:24:46] dealing with flesh and
[1:24:47] blood. Hallelujah. When we go up, we do
[1:24:51] not go up in flesh and blood.
[1:24:55] We go up as a
[1:24:57] theophony. Y what I'm saying? Flesh and
[1:25:01] blood cannot enter into that kingdom.
[1:25:05] We go up. We shed this old body.
[1:25:08] Hallelujah. Stepped in some something
[1:25:10] called
[1:25:12] theophony right places us in heaven
[1:25:17] where we should be at the moment.
[1:25:21] At the
[1:25:23] moment. Glory. That's why Paul says,
[1:25:27] "You going to know me and I'll be known
[1:25:30] as I've
[1:25:31] known Paul's basically saying it's going
[1:25:33] to be the same
[1:25:35] me but a better me."
[1:25:39] Hallelujah. Don't you want a better
[1:25:43] me? No more pain, no more sorrow, no
[1:25:47] more sickness.
[1:25:49] Hallelujah. There'll never be another
[1:25:51] cloudy day.
[1:25:54] I don't know about you, but I know it
[1:25:58] exists. Hallelujah. Glory. People say,
[1:26:02] you know, serving Jesus Christ is a
[1:26:06] fairy tale, but this is the best fairy
[1:26:09] tale I know. And you talk
[1:26:13] about we shall live
[1:26:18] forever. Hallelujah. Is that all right?
[1:26:21] Just so you understand, by the grace of
[1:26:23] God, the Bible says, "For by grace are
[1:26:26] you
[1:26:28] saved and that not of yourself, it is a
[1:26:32] gift from
[1:26:33] God." If you don't have the grace or you
[1:26:37] don't have the faith that he that he
[1:26:38] gives out, you need to ask him
[1:26:42] for am I out of my
[1:26:44] mind. No, I am not. I'm gonna read a
[1:26:47] prayer by brother
[1:26:49] Brandon. Amen. Coming
[1:26:51] from looking at the unseen.
[1:26:56] That
[1:26:57] is year 590410.
[1:27:03] Paragraph two. Paragraph.
[1:27:06] He said, "Almighty God, the creator of
[1:27:09] heaven, the creator of heaven and earth
[1:27:12] and the author of everlasting life
[1:27:16] and the giver of every good and perfect
[1:27:18] gift.
[1:27:20] to thee, oh Lord, who raised up Jesus
[1:27:23] thy son on the third
[1:27:26] day for our consolation that we might be
[1:27:31] reconciled to
[1:27:32] thee being justified by
[1:27:35] faith, believe in the story. We pray
[1:27:38] that you would raise us
[1:27:42] tonight, your children to a higher
[1:27:45] heights, deeper
[1:27:48] depths, eternal
[1:27:51] presence. May we recognize thee,
[1:27:54] Lord. May new faith come
[1:27:57] tonight. Something that will just set
[1:27:59] our soul. Hallelujah. They're burning
[1:28:02] with old fashion Pentecostal fire.
[1:28:05] Remember those Lord
[1:28:08] tonight who are weak and feeble knees,
[1:28:12] feeble hands. We pray that they will be
[1:28:15] strengthened tonight by thy presence of
[1:28:19] thy
[1:28:20] spirit. Bring those wondering ones back
[1:28:23] to the
[1:28:25] fold and all of those Lord who has never
[1:28:29] yet accepted thee as their personal
[1:28:33] savior this the night that they'll
[1:28:37] settle it once for all
[1:28:41] [Music]
[1:28:44] and then Lord remember those who are
[1:28:47] sick and
[1:28:51] afflicted may we have a resurrection
[1:28:56] tonight new
[1:28:58] hopes new faith grant it Lord speak to
[1:29:03] us through thy
[1:29:04] word, further weight in the name of
[1:29:07] Jesus Christ, thy son, we ask
[1:29:11] it. Amen. Amen. A higher height,
[1:29:16] a deeper depth of his presence.
[1:29:19] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He didn't say
[1:29:21] just
[1:29:23] word. His presence.
[1:29:27] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. 2 Corinthians
[1:29:29] Corinthians 4:16.
[1:29:42] Are you there?
[1:29:44] For this cause we faint not.
[1:29:48] But though our outward man perish,
[1:29:53] our inward man is renewed day by day.
[1:30:00] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. If it if if Paul
[1:30:02] can say
[1:30:03] that his outward man, he's getting
[1:30:06] older. He's perishing. Hallelujah. But
[1:30:10] he said, "Listen, something's
[1:30:13] happening that the flesh has no control
[1:30:16] of
[1:30:18] it." In other words, I'm being
[1:30:21] renewed every day, day by day, one step
[1:30:26] at a time. Hallelujah.
[1:30:30] Listen. And he said, "For our light
[1:30:31] affliction,
[1:30:34] which is but for a moment,
[1:30:37] workketh for
[1:30:39] a far excellent uh more a far more
[1:30:44] exceeding eternal weight of glory.
[1:30:48] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. While we look
[1:30:52] not at the things which are seen,
[1:30:56] but at the things which are not seen,
[1:31:00] And as I said the other
[1:31:02] day, what you see is not
[1:31:05] real. It is the unseen things that are
[1:31:09] real. Hallelujah. Whether or not you see
[1:31:12] it or not, but the angels of the Lord
[1:31:15] are
[1:31:22] encounter with every whenever two or
[1:31:25] three are gathered
[1:31:26] together in his name on one
[1:31:30] occur. The host of heaven is right
[1:31:33] here. Amen. To make it come to pass.
[1:31:36] Whatever, whatsoever you ask in my name
[1:31:40] believing it, it shall be given unto
[1:31:44] thee. That's the Bible.
[1:31:48] We got to believe that.
[1:31:52] Help us Jesus.
[1:31:55] Israel,
[1:31:57] one thing, Israel believed in one God.
[1:32:01] You know sometimes even even the
[1:32:03] believer don't know that they sometimes
[1:32:05] think Jesus is
[1:32:06] too or God is father and then you got
[1:32:10] Jesus. You understand me? They don't
[1:32:11] understand
[1:32:13] that Jesus Christ is the housing of
[1:32:17] God. Hallelujah. And he calls us
[1:32:19] brothers and sisters. So therefore we
[1:32:22] must be the housing of
[1:32:24] God. Is that what he said? Paul said
[1:32:27] know you not that you are the temple of
[1:32:28] God.
[1:32:30] He didn't say gods. He said
[1:32:33] God. But there's only one God. He made
[1:32:37] the heavens. He made the earth. He made
[1:32:39] the universe. He's made everything that
[1:32:42] you can
[1:32:43] see. Even those things that you cannot
[1:32:46] see. He's the maker.
[1:32:50] Hallelujah.
[1:32:51] As I said,
[1:32:53] as you believe God in your heart,
[1:32:58] that's his strength.
[1:33:01] If your faith is weak in your heart,
[1:33:04] then God is weak to you.
[1:33:07] That's it. But if you got the faith that
[1:33:10] God has given
[1:33:11] you, which is the faith of the Lord
[1:33:14] Jesus Christ,
[1:33:16] Jesus believe his own
[1:33:19] word. Hallelujah. God will correct
[1:33:23] you. Brother, didn't you not ask for
[1:33:25] three
[1:33:27] squirrels? You asked for three
[1:33:30] squirrels. Why do you settle for less?
[1:33:33] If you ask God for something, don't back
[1:33:36] up from the devil.
[1:33:38] believe God. Possess your land.
[1:33:44] Well, it must not have been God's will.
[1:33:45] That's the
[1:33:48] devil. Hallelujah. That's really the
[1:33:50] truth. You just don't know how to wait
[1:33:53] on God and
[1:33:55] believe. You don't God can't lie.
[1:33:59] And if you have the faith of a mustard
[1:34:01] seed, you can say to a mountain be thy
[1:34:03] move.
[1:34:05] That's the word.
[1:34:09] Hallelujah.
[1:34:11] Deuteronomy 64-5.
[1:34:15] Yes, sir. If we're going to go higher,
[1:34:16] we got to think the
[1:34:19] word. Let the mind that that would be in
[1:34:22] Christ, let it be in
[1:34:23] us. My thoughts doesn't matter. My
[1:34:27] feelings doesn't
[1:34:29] matter. What somebody else has told me
[1:34:31] doesn't matter.
[1:34:34] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Elijah believed
[1:34:37] God so
[1:34:38] much. He spoke
[1:34:40] it. He said, "It will not rain
[1:34:44] until I call for it."
[1:34:47] Hey, somebody. And it didn't rain for
[1:34:49] three and a half
[1:34:51] years. H y'all hear what I'm saying? And
[1:34:54] if we got the spirit of Elijah, which is
[1:34:57] Elisha, we've got to double portion.
[1:35:02] You got to talk to this thing with
[1:35:06] authority. Not like a little baby
[1:35:08] learning how to be a
[1:35:10] king. Hallelujah. You are kings and
[1:35:13] priests.
[1:35:14] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Deuteronomy 6:14
[1:35:19] here. O Israel. The Lord our God is one
[1:35:22] Lord.
[1:35:24] Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
[1:35:27] all thine heart, with all thy soul, and
[1:35:31] with all thy mind. That's what makes it
[1:35:34] work.
[1:35:36] Hallelujah. You love the Lord. In your
[1:35:40] heart, not your head. Hallelujah.
[1:35:44] Hebrews 8,
[1:35:45] please. We'll read 8 chapter 8th chapter
[1:35:48] 10th and through the 13th verse.
[1:35:55] See, see, see what people don't
[1:35:57] understand why it's so important. Get
[1:35:58] the Holy
[1:36:01] Ghost. I don't care how you scream and
[1:36:03] holler at the altar.
[1:36:06] God waiting for you to surrender.
[1:36:10] Yeah, you surrender. You understand me?
[1:36:12] We can do all that. That's good. But at
[1:36:15] the end of the day, he ain't going to
[1:36:16] move until you
[1:36:18] surrender. And let me tell you
[1:36:20] something. If you know what I'm talking
[1:36:22] about, While you're praying, God is
[1:36:25] telling you everything you need to
[1:36:29] surrender, everything you need to
[1:36:31] confess.
[1:36:33] Am I am I making up
[1:36:37] something? He talks to you. And if you
[1:36:40] follow his instruction, you'll come to
[1:36:42] the
[1:36:43] victory. But he
[1:36:45] knows when you want to halfway give him
[1:36:49] something until you give it all.
[1:36:55] Y'all know y'all know what I'm saying?
[1:36:58] 8:10
[1:36:59] through13. That's why so many people
[1:37:01] don't have it because they're not
[1:37:02] willing or they're not willing to give
[1:37:05] up this
[1:37:07] world. They got too many riches. That's
[1:37:09] what's wrong with us. We've got
[1:37:11] too like the rich young ruler. I can't
[1:37:15] give all of this up and follow
[1:37:17] you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I might end
[1:37:20] up like you. Where's your house?
[1:37:22] You know what I'm saying? Your clothes
[1:37:24] are tattered. What? What? What? You want
[1:37:26] me to give up all of this?
[1:37:29] Listen, I'm going to tell you something.
[1:37:31] Where the devil trick people,
[1:37:34] they still think they going to take all
[1:37:35] them riches with
[1:37:39] them? You can't even take the clothes
[1:37:41] that they wrapped you in when you're
[1:37:45] dead. You rot and die in there. And
[1:37:47] that's how you ride up. Your clothes
[1:37:50] going to ride up. And I heard that,
[1:37:53] brother. Your casket going to ride up.
[1:37:55] Hallelujah.
[1:37:57] Yes, sir. That's why God gave us
[1:38:01] clothes. Paul said, I want to be
[1:38:03] clothed.
[1:38:05] And what do I want to be clothed with?
[1:38:06] His
[1:38:08] virtue. His character.
[1:38:11] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And if I got his
[1:38:13] character, he's going to give me a white
[1:38:15] robe.
[1:38:18] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I will not
[1:38:20] appear before him naked.
[1:38:24] Hallelujah. As that song say, step by
[1:38:26] step will make this journey.
[1:38:30] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. For this is the
[1:38:33] covenant. 10th verse. For this is the
[1:38:35] covenant that I will make with with the
[1:38:37] house of
[1:38:39] Israel. In those days, said the
[1:38:42] Lord, I will put my laws into mine.
[1:38:46] and write them in their hearts, and I
[1:38:49] will be to them a God, and they shall be
[1:38:52] a people.
[1:38:54] Be to me a people, and they shall not
[1:38:57] teach every man his
[1:38:59] neighbor, and every man his brother,
[1:39:01] saying, "Know the Lord. For all shall
[1:39:05] know me from the least to the greatest."
[1:39:08] What is he saying? All is going to have
[1:39:10] the Holy Spirit.
[1:39:13] Oh, and I will be merciful to their
[1:39:17] unrighteousness. In their sins, in their
[1:39:20] iniquities will I remember no more. And
[1:39:22] how many of us know what iniquity is?
[1:39:25] When you know what to do, you do it
[1:39:28] willfully. It ain't the devil made me do
[1:39:30] it.
[1:39:34] And God still have mercy on
[1:39:37] you. Because because before your
[1:39:40] iniquity, he suffered for your
[1:39:43] iniquity. What a mighty
[1:39:47] God. No condemnation. You got to
[1:39:50] realize, you got to stop allowing the
[1:39:55] devil. Hallelujah. For I will have
[1:39:59] mercy to their
[1:40:01] unrighteousness and their
[1:40:03] sins and their iniquities will I
[1:40:05] remember no more. In that he said a new
[1:40:09] covenant heath made the first old. Now
[1:40:13] that which decayth and waxes old is
[1:40:16] ready to vanish away. What is the new
[1:40:19] covenant? Brother said it's
[1:40:22] unconditional. It's not what you do. is
[1:40:25] what I've done for
[1:40:26] you. Why do we allow
[1:40:30] ourselves to get in a place of
[1:40:34] depression when we didn't choose
[1:40:36] ourselves?
[1:40:40] Hallelujah. Let me run
[1:40:42] on. Let me read Ephesians quickly,
[1:40:46] first chapter. I'm almost done. The
[1:40:49] third to the 8th verse.
[1:40:53] The Bible said, "Blessed be the
[1:40:55] God, father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:40:58] who have blessed us with spiritual
[1:41:00] blessings in heavenly places."
[1:41:03] Christ accordingly has he chosen us in
[1:41:06] him?
[1:41:09] in him before the foundation of the
[1:41:11] world that we should be holy and without
[1:41:14] blame before him in love having
[1:41:17] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:41:21] children by Jesus Christ to
[1:41:23] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:41:26] of his
[1:41:27] will of the glory of his
[1:41:30] grace wherein he have made us oh I love
[1:41:33] this
[1:41:34] right I love this made us accepted
[1:41:38] in the beloved. I didn't earn
[1:41:41] it, but I was accepted. You didn't earn
[1:41:45] it, but you was accepted. Y'all forgive
[1:41:48] me. I'm licking my lips like crazy cuz
[1:41:50] I'm so thirsty. Forgive me. In whom we
[1:41:53] have redemption through his blood, the
[1:41:56] forgiveness of sin according to the
[1:41:59] riches of his grace. Wherein he have
[1:42:01] abounded toward
[1:42:03] us all wisdom and prudence.
[1:42:10] I'm going to quit. It's this. Calling
[1:42:13] Jesus on the scene is what we need to
[1:42:15] do.
[1:42:18] Sometimes we're not where we should be.
[1:42:21] But he is helpful. You know, we talk
[1:42:24] about Jehovah
[1:42:25] Gyra. We he can furnish me with a house.
[1:42:28] He can furnish me with a car. He can
[1:42:30] furnish me with with a job. But he can
[1:42:34] furnish you with faith.
[1:42:38] Amen. That's what we need.
[1:42:41] We need
[1:42:43] faith. Perfect faith, the kind that will
[1:42:46] not
[1:42:52] waver. Brother Brandham said that Jesus
[1:42:54] had undisturbed
[1:42:56] faith. No matter how bad the news
[1:43:01] was, he never was shaken.
[1:43:05] He didn't go out of control.
[1:43:08] Don't get me wrong. He was in full
[1:43:11] control at Lazarus's grave. He
[1:43:14] wept. Y'all hear what I'm saying? So,
[1:43:16] ain't nothing wrong with crying, but he
[1:43:18] knew who he was and he knew what he was
[1:43:21] coming to
[1:43:22] do. Hallelujah. Let's go to Mark the 9th
[1:43:25] chapter 19-24.
[1:43:29] Hallelujah. You love the Lord here.
[1:43:33] Jesus is dealing with some devils that
[1:43:36] needed to be cast out
[1:43:39] and his disciples were not able to do
[1:43:40] it.
[1:43:42] Starting at the 19th verse,
[1:43:45] he answered him and said, "Oh ye, oh
[1:43:48] faithless
[1:43:50] generation, how long shall I be with
[1:43:53] you? How long shall I suffer you?
[1:43:57] Bring him unto me." And they brought him
[1:44:01] unto
[1:44:02] him. And when he saw him straight away,
[1:44:06] the spirit teared him and he fell on the
[1:44:10] ground while
[1:44:12] forming. If we had seen
[1:44:15] that, we would jump
[1:44:19] back and we would call him Jesus. Jesus,
[1:44:23] Jesus,
[1:44:24] Jesus. Y'all hear what I'm saying? But
[1:44:28] all that calling
[1:44:30] would be under under the spirit of
[1:44:35] unbelief. In the light of
[1:44:38] God before Jesus could even
[1:44:42] speak, the devil shows
[1:44:45] off. And it was all what he was trying
[1:44:47] to
[1:44:48] do is produce
[1:44:50] fear. Y'all better hear me. Cuz fear is
[1:44:55] torment. The first time I saw demons
[1:44:58] cast out of a
[1:44:59] person, I had just come to the
[1:45:02] message and I was
[1:45:07] scared. Amen. That girl crawled on the
[1:45:11] floor like a serpent,
[1:45:14] eyes red as fire making sounds like
[1:45:18] birds. And she switched over to
[1:45:21] pigs. And I'm standing there
[1:45:25] shaking. and they say, "Close your
[1:45:27] eyes."
[1:45:29] She was headed my way.
[1:45:32] I didn't know the message like I know it
[1:45:34] now.
[1:45:36] But I kept my eye.
[1:45:40] I'm being honest. I kept my eyes on her.
[1:45:45] There was another brother who kept his
[1:45:47] eyes on her, too. So when brothers
[1:45:51] prayed for that
[1:45:53] woman, something came out of her.
[1:45:57] And it went by me. And that brother
[1:46:00] said, "Oh,
[1:46:03] Jesus. I'm just telling you, it ain't
[1:46:06] nothing to play with, but it's
[1:46:09] real." Amen. It didn't scare Brother
[1:46:13] Simmons. So the next time we had a
[1:46:16] situation like that, I wasn't
[1:46:19] there. Brother Simmons said, "All who
[1:46:21] don't believe
[1:46:26] and the whole church emptied out.
[1:46:33] At least they were honest.
[1:46:37] But listen,
[1:46:39] let's move on. See what I want you to
[1:46:41] understand.
[1:46:42] These they face the same thing we
[1:46:47] face. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And he and
[1:46:51] they bought him unto him.
[1:46:54] 20th verse. And when he saw him,
[1:46:56] straightway the spirit tear him fell on
[1:47:00] the ground and wallowed for me.
[1:47:04] And he asked his father, "How long is
[1:47:07] how long is it
[1:47:09] ago?" Sisters came upon
[1:47:13] him and he said of a child.
[1:47:17] So you understand what Jesus did? He
[1:47:20] literally ignored the performance of the
[1:47:25] demon and he addresses the
[1:47:28] father. How long
[1:47:32] is the father says often time it have
[1:47:35] cast him into the
[1:47:38] fire to destroy him. But if thou can do
[1:47:44] anything comp compassion on us and help
[1:47:49] him. And Jesus said, "If thou can't
[1:47:53] believe, all things are possible to him
[1:47:57] that
[1:47:58] believeth." You got to continue to
[1:48:00] believe. Even if the devil doesn't move
[1:48:03] right then, you got to believe that what
[1:48:06] has been said is done.
[1:48:11] And straightway
[1:48:13] the father of the tribe child cried out
[1:48:17] and said with tears,
[1:48:20] Lord, I believe.
[1:48:23] Help thou my unbelief.
[1:48:27] As simple as it
[1:48:29] gets. If your faith is not to the
[1:48:33] level, my
[1:48:36] unbelief. At least the man knew
[1:48:38] something wasn't quite right.
[1:48:44] Ask God for more faith. Lord, help me. I
[1:48:49] believe,
[1:48:52] right? But help thou my unbelief.
[1:48:57] Hallelujah. You understand me? So, we
[1:49:00] must
[1:49:00] understand that sometime we are
[1:49:02] confronted with situations.
[1:49:06] faith, but it's not
[1:49:07] enough. It's not
[1:49:10] solid. Y'all understand what I'm trying
[1:49:12] to say? So, you have to ask God, help my
[1:49:18] How do you know you don't have it?
[1:49:21] See what happened. boy wasn't that demon
[1:49:25] kept quiet
[1:49:27] until Jesus presence
[1:49:30] and then he really acted
[1:49:33] up and that's what the devil does with
[1:49:35] our
[1:49:36] children that's what we pray for they
[1:49:39] get
[1:49:40] worse and then we think oh my
[1:49:43] god we feel v we feel we feel um um
[1:49:48] defeated
[1:49:51] don't back up
[1:49:54] Stand your
[1:49:55] ground. You can act up all you want to.
[1:49:59] But the word of God has come to
[1:50:02] you. You got to
[1:50:04] go. Stand there. I don't care how bad it
[1:50:08] get. Stand there. You are little amateur
[1:50:12] God. You're Messiah. The word of
[1:50:15] creation is in your
[1:50:17] mouth. However you think in your heart,
[1:50:20] that's what you'll be.
[1:50:22] If you can see yourself free, the devil
[1:50:24] says you ain't no you you you're a
[1:50:26] hypocrite. You listen you got to put the
[1:50:29] word with his stripes I'm healed. God
[1:50:32] has settled my debt. You have nothing
[1:50:35] over me. God justified me as though I
[1:50:39] was never sin in the first
[1:50:41] place. You cannot hold me. You are not
[1:50:45] charged me. Hallelujah. No accusation,
[1:50:49] nothing.
[1:50:50] Amen. God has set me free
[1:50:54] and he's given me the authority. That's
[1:50:57] what he said. After which the Holy Ghost
[1:50:59] has come upon
[1:51:00] you receive power. God said that power
[1:51:04] is the authority of the almighty
[1:51:07] God. We got to do it people. We got to
[1:51:11] keep it. We got to keep pressing
[1:51:13] forward. I'm going to stop here by the
[1:51:16] grace of God. Perhaps Sunday I'll
[1:51:19] continue. It would be the will of the
[1:51:22] Lord because there's so much I'm trying
[1:51:24] to get us to
[1:51:26] see. Faith without works is dead.
[1:51:31] We're the bride of Christ. I believe
[1:51:33] that with all my heart. Brother said,
[1:51:36] "One man can't make bring a
[1:51:39] revival. It takes the
[1:51:43] people. And if you want to see God come
[1:51:45] in this place like he wants,
[1:51:51] Hallelujah. Right. You got to start
[1:51:54] saying Lord, not my will but thine be
[1:51:57] done. Whatever your word say is what I
[1:52:00] want to
[1:52:01] be. My heart, oh
[1:52:04] God. Make me more like
[1:52:07] thee. That's it. Let us
[1:52:11] stand. Hallelujah.

[2:06:34] So we just thank they do have that site

[2:06:41] make sure you you you let them know that
[2:06:44] you go to Higher Ground
[2:06:46] Tabernacle. Maybe that might bear some
[2:06:49] influence on Joyce. One thing she did
[2:06:52] say to me the other night, I told her I
[2:06:54] would loved her and she she hugged me,
[2:06:57] which I know Keith would not have
[2:06:59] allowed that, but she did in a a
[2:07:02] righteous way, a respectful way. My wife
[2:07:05] was there and she actually told me that
[2:07:08] she loved me. And that's that's that's
[2:07:13] saying a lot. And she said it in front
[2:07:15] of all her children. So they say I'm
[2:07:19] part of the family. can't get rid of me.
