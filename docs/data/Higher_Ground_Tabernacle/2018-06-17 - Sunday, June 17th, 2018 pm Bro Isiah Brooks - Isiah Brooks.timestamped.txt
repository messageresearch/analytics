[30:02] [Music]
[30:23] [Music]
[30:27] I know bees coming back for me as we
[31:10] stand go right into the word of the Lord
[31:12] excellent job my brother appreciate you
[31:18] I I started to this message on Wednesday
[31:23] and of course like I said I detoured
[31:25] this morning on another thought about
[31:28] the force of your words or the power of
[31:30] your words and last Wednesday we
[31:33] preached and ministered on thank you
[31:37] glad to see how Sister Carrie always if
[31:41] I don't say it I know you need to know
[31:43] what I do appreciate your coming amen
[31:46] [Music]
[31:48] always and always to see the seer family
[31:56] we appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ and
[32:01] we thank God for His goodness and like I
[32:04] said we ministered on that thought what
[32:06] time is it the time is now I wanted to
[32:09] basically I was basically trying to show
[32:12] us exactly where we are pretty much in
[32:14] history there's no way that I can cover
[32:16] everything but by the grace of God you
[32:18] know that you and I are in such a
[32:20] delicate place right now we're right at
[32:23] the end of the Gentile age expiring on
[32:28] us and we're right at the the the
[32:32] breaking of the atonement for the Jews
[32:35] and so therefore it puts us in this real
[32:40] a sensitive place because the Bible said
[32:43] when we are translated when that rapture
[32:45] takes place no man know the day nor the
[32:48] hour are we do realize by God's grace
[32:51] that we do know that Jesus Christ knows
[32:54] the day in the hour right when he took
[32:58] the blood of the Lamb or his blood and
[33:00] laid it upon the altar there in heaven
[33:03] we know that that that it God told him
[33:07] exactly what the day in the hour would
[33:09] be so we realized that there is now a
[33:12] man who knows and that man is Jesus
[33:14] Christ so we think are for His grace I
[33:20] read to you last week was Matthew 24:32
[33:24] 2:35 when I was talking to dr. turn
[33:26] there but I was talking about the fig
[33:28] tree and how it put forces branches and
[33:30] all of us know that the fig tree is a
[33:32] type of Israel that's why the world
[33:35] think about how small that place is yet
[33:38] the whole world encompasses it you know
[33:42] they they troubled with Israel and it's
[33:45] because of the jealousies and it goes
[33:47] all the way back amen to Jacob and Esau
[33:52] brothers fighting one another so we know
[33:57] that God is Isaac and you know we
[33:59] realize we know that God is in all of
[34:03] this we know it as we let's just turn to
[34:08] Scripture please revelations
[34:14] in 13 through 14 people say that America
[34:17] is not in in the scripture but we
[34:26] realized that America it's in the
[34:28] scripture she is that beast that came up
[34:32] like a lamb and she turned into a dragon
[34:35] and she began to speak powerful words
[34:41] and she gave her her her strength over
[34:45] to the woman to that Catholic Church and
[34:49] we understand by God's grace it is a
[34:52] sensitive topic nowadays you can get
[34:54] really in trouble by talking about these
[34:56] things because everybody would like to
[34:58] hear no evil see no evil speak no evil
[35:02] it's like an ostrich you know trying to
[35:04] hide from the predator and got his head
[35:08] in the hole and all of everything else
[35:10] is exposed but in his mind he think he's
[35:13] hiding when in reality he's just given
[35:16] the the predator a good target and you
[35:20] know you know we we look at this thing
[35:21] and we said well earth looks what are
[35:22] you trying to say and I'm saying as I
[35:25] said this morning the greatest weapon
[35:28] that you and I can have at this time
[35:30] outside of the word it's prayer prayer
[35:32] is is the thing that you and I must
[35:35] allow ask God to help us in keep us
[35:38] connected with him because it's those
[35:41] who have prayer lives that will escape
[35:43] this own coming judgment why because
[35:46] we're watching and that's what Jesus
[35:48] said watch and pray revelations 9
[35:52] beginning at the 13th verse we read the
[35:59] ninth verse of the 13th verse in the
[36:02] fourteenth verse and then we'll go to
[36:04] another scripture here and the sixth
[36:08] angel sounded and I heard a voice for
[36:11] the four from the four horns of the
[36:14] golden altar which is before God saying
[36:17] to the sixth angel which had the trumpet
[36:18] loose the four angels which are bound in
[36:22] the great river Euphrates one more
[36:27] scripture first John first John many
[36:33] people
[36:34] know that we are actually in the book of
[36:36] Revelation and we're about ready to wind
[36:39] it up the next great event for the bride
[36:42] of Jesus Christ is the rapture we're not
[36:46] looking for an eighth angel or some
[36:50] great leader we receive our messenger
[36:53] for our our he has introduced us to
[36:56] Jesus Christ and now we are being wedded
[37:00] and some of us are already married to
[37:02] him but and we're producing we come here
[37:06] to produce Christ to show that Jesus
[37:09] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[37:11] forever amen
[37:13] first John 5 and beginning at the
[37:16] fourteenth verse and this is the
[37:18] confidence that we have in him then we
[37:22] ask anything according to his will he
[37:24] heareth us that's important if you ask
[37:28] anything according to his will he
[37:31] heareth us yeah he didn't put no
[37:35] stipulations on there other than let it
[37:38] be according to his will alright he
[37:41] heareth us and if we know that he hear
[37:45] us whatsoever we ask we know that we
[37:49] have the petition that we desire of him
[37:53] and God's Word can't change as you heard
[37:57] me say this morning he can't change his
[38:00] word can't change what what people don't
[38:03] understand is it well if he can't change
[38:05] then while we're not sacrificing bulls
[38:08] and goats and bullocks and all that
[38:10] because in Jesus Christ all of those
[38:13] sacrifices were made in him he was the
[38:17] red heifer I could be the helper because
[38:20] he knew his bride was in him he is the
[38:23] red helper he's the goat
[38:25] he's the lamb right he's the turtledoves
[38:28] all of those offerings that were made in
[38:32] the law was fulfilled in Christ Jesus
[38:37] hallelujah that's why that's why the
[38:39] Bible said we have only one potentate I
[38:42] love that word is just sound powerful to
[38:44] me Amen
[38:46] let us pray father we thank you for your
[38:49] grace and your mercy we thank you for
[38:51] our your goodness you have been so good
[38:53] to us and Lord we thank you right now
[38:56] this evening we just pray father God
[38:58] that you would bless Lord are your
[39:00] people keep us and guide us and we thank
[39:04] you for everything you've just been
[39:06] better to us and we have been to
[39:08] ourselves it's been a wonderful Father's
[39:10] Day and I thought Lord that you know we
[39:13] would have the second service so I could
[39:15] show we could prove father you are the
[39:17] greatest of all fathers truly you're the
[39:20] only father Lord and we pray that you
[39:22] bless each and every heart here in Jesus
[39:25] Christ's name we pray amen
[39:27] you may be seated I also wanted to say
[39:31] it's it's almost over
[39:34] you know one of the things that you know
[39:37] you and I must understand that time has
[39:40] gone on for a long time and people have
[39:42] thought to themselves you know well the
[39:44] Lord tarry but you must understand that
[39:47] God has a set time and you and I we
[39:50] don't know that time but when he is like
[39:52] death nobody knows really when they're
[39:54] going to die but no matter how well your
[39:57] heart beats you may not even have a flaw
[40:00] in your heart but if God pulls your card
[40:02] you're gone is that right it's all
[40:08] depends on what God has decided for you
[40:10] right it's not who understands how a cow
[40:15] right can eat grass
[40:19] and produce white milk and yellow butter
[40:23] none of us understand the process of
[40:27] that and none of us understands even the
[40:31] process of death but we do know one
[40:33] thing that if we die in Him will rise
[40:36] again and this Christian story if I
[40:41] could say it like that is becoming
[40:43] obsolete to the world and it's not
[40:46] something that we didn't know was going
[40:48] to happen the Bible speaks of it
[40:50] constantly about how the world would
[40:54] evil seducers shall wax worse and how
[40:58] that unbelievers and make-believe
[41:00] would really take over the world as it
[41:02] was in the days of Noah and you and I
[41:05] know by God's grace when it comes to
[41:07] Christianity it's not a properly thing
[41:09] not even among Christians because when
[41:13] you are serious about being a Christian
[41:15] most Christians tell you it's not
[41:18] necessary but the Bible says Amen broad
[41:22] is the way that leads to destruction
[41:24] straight and narrow is the way that
[41:26] leads to eternal life and a few be that
[41:28] find it you ought to thank God that you
[41:31] a few you're part of the few is that
[41:35] right
[41:35] I really believe with all of my heart
[41:37] because people say I follow a messenger
[41:41] I I follow the message that doesn't
[41:44] guarantee you nothing the thing that
[41:49] Jesus told Nicodemus you must be born
[41:51] again see you've got to have the power
[41:55] of God on the inside of you right your
[41:58] religion your faith whatever you might
[42:00] want to call it I believe there's
[42:01] Christians and everything I'm a nation
[42:03] but you must understand that in this
[42:05] hour God is calling them out God is
[42:08] calling them into a place so they can
[42:11] die to all the creeds
[42:13] all their dogmas all of the things that
[42:15] men have placed in them that is
[42:17] erroneous and Antichrist God is trying
[42:21] to get a word in them so they could see
[42:24] and understand that they are to be
[42:26] presented before God as a chaste bride a
[42:29] woman without spot wrinkle or blemish
[42:32] right and this is why we must watch the
[42:36] word the word we must keep our eyes
[42:39] focused on Jesus Christ that Satan in
[42:43] his cunning craftiness won't come along
[42:46] and seduce us you understand me
[42:49] because we look at this things and what
[42:51] brothers what are you saying
[42:53] I'm saying by the grace of God we have
[42:55] come to a place and and remember it is
[42:58] in the third chapter of revelation that
[43:00] the bride takes her rapture right and
[43:03] you and I must understand that things
[43:05] overlaps you got the fourth seal you at
[43:07] the fifth seal you got the sixth seal we
[43:09] know by God's grace these things that
[43:11] are taking place right now
[43:13] it's significant it is showing a sign it
[43:16] is telling us Amen that God's coming
[43:18] it's not we see all of the things
[43:21] Matthew talked about wars and rumors of
[43:24] wars famines and pestilence you was a
[43:26] brother once we've had that all along
[43:28] but never ever have we had it on the
[43:30] scale in which we have it now so you and
[43:34] I must know that if that be the truth
[43:35] that means God is at the door
[43:38] 1948 Israel became a nation Bobby says
[43:41] when you see the fig tree blooming and
[43:43] putting forth her buds know that the
[43:46] time is not he said then you began to
[43:49] see earthquakes in places and diverse
[43:51] places and that means many of places
[43:53] then you began to see Pressly's and wars
[43:55] and you know and i know that the whole
[43:58] world has a spirit of destruction
[44:01] everybody wants to fight everybody wants
[44:04] to walk everybody have a right everybody
[44:06] is trying to conquer somebody hallelujah
[44:10] and the Bible said that's exactly will
[44:12] it is the Sun he said but don't worry
[44:14] that is just the beginning of Sorrows
[44:16] that means it doesn't get better it gets
[44:19] worse understand me in the days before
[44:23] in those day only a souls were saved in
[44:26] the days of lot only three souls were
[44:29] saved in the days of Enoch only what so
[44:32] was saying hallelujah
[44:34] millions of people lost their lives
[44:36] because they would not surrender to the
[44:39] Jehovah God's voice so we know by God's
[44:43] grace Amen that Israel is the
[44:46] combination one of the things that God
[44:48] has done in this last day and and and
[44:51] people are not excited but I am we
[44:54] didn't understand where exactly but our
[44:56] trunk place was placed are in in in
[44:59] God's economy and now we see that this
[45:02] man has placed Israel in her position
[45:05] just like Cyrus did amen when they have
[45:09] been listen because 70 years expired
[45:12] hallelujah and God anointed a Gentile
[45:15] man amen to Hotel Israel that they could
[45:19] go back home hallelujah now mind you
[45:23] every Israelite that was in Babylon
[45:26] not go back home hallelujah which shows
[45:29] him and everybody in the message will
[45:32] not go to meet God hallelujah some
[45:36] people love the world just the way it is
[45:38] hallelujah
[45:39] but God has anointed of people a man to
[45:43] see and hear and to understand the
[45:46] Caesars and the times because God said
[45:49] to those who are walking in the light
[45:50] you are children of the light and you
[45:52] will not walk in darkness and this thing
[45:55] will not catch you unaware ah because
[45:58] you're children of the light you can see
[46:01] the times you can see amen that how can
[46:04] this world get any any worse than and
[46:07] what it is but it will a live but even
[46:11] as a bride or the devil is building his
[46:14] kingdom there is a building of the bride
[46:16] the God has a people that he is focused
[46:19] on and God is working in her with her
[46:24] hallelujah he will see her through why
[46:28] because the word says so understand him
[46:32] and even the prophet of God says him and
[46:34] then when God give us that final
[46:36] outpouring and how many all know we got
[46:38] a final opponent hallelujah realized
[46:41] this there is coming another final
[46:45] outpouring and the prophet of God says
[46:48] it will fall on the just and the unjust
[46:51] it is going to fall and all the
[46:55] denominations is going to fall on the
[46:57] ride but the denomination will think
[47:00] that they are actually having a revival
[47:02] but at the time there will be receiving
[47:05] the mark of the beast but the bride will
[47:10] begin she'll be receiving the mark of
[47:13] Christ Jesus in her forehead hallelujah
[47:16] so you see we're at that day and time
[47:18] Amen that many people don't know about
[47:21] what we're talking about millions of
[47:23] people would love to understand and to
[47:25] know but guess what
[47:27] just as God blinded the Jews so had the
[47:30] Gentiles be blind yet amen
[47:33] so has the Gentiles be bright was
[47:36] blinded God said in this age layer the
[47:39] seer would be
[47:40] blind naked and don't even know it
[47:43] hallelujah why because she is the only
[47:46] Church age looking at think it's still
[47:48] the chapter third chapter of Revelation
[47:50] she is the only church age that's put
[47:53] Jesus Christ out hallelujah then they
[47:57] talk about Jesus they sing about Jesus
[47:59] but they don't know it is another Jesus
[48:02] because Jesus Christ is the word he is a
[48:06] God that changes not hallelujah and
[48:09] everybody have a revelation of what who
[48:11] Jesus is but the real Jesus is the word
[48:14] of God made manifest let me move on so
[48:19] we now know his rel has been in holding
[48:22] on 40 years a little bit more Harvey
[48:24] long amen
[48:25] 1946 1948 whichever you want to
[48:28] calculate it but therefore she's been
[48:30] there hallelujah
[48:33] she'sshe's just a man I believe
[48:35] celebrated her time are 70 years of and
[48:39] realized by God's grace at 70 years of
[48:42] the generation - hallelujah so we're now
[48:45] it's really right in line with us seven
[48:49] years seven church ages and understand
[48:52] we working with seven Sabbath which is
[48:55] seven Church ages right but just right
[48:59] after that seventh him and you got to
[49:01] realize Amen there was a little space
[49:03] there and that space a man was right
[49:08] just before the atonement and in that if
[49:11] I got it correctly we realized that God
[49:13] is getting ready to do a work remember I
[49:16] preached and I told you about the grace
[49:17] of God we've seen God do right America
[49:21] America and the world have how could I
[49:24] say it the world at large is without
[49:26] excuse God did more in our age with his
[49:33] ministry than he did in his own when he
[49:35] walked the earth you had all robbers you
[49:38] had Billy Graham you had all of these
[49:40] people right you had William Branham you
[49:43] had all kinds of captain cooler all of
[49:46] these people different ones working
[49:48] under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit
[49:51] with signs and one
[49:53] does hallelujah fulfilling joy your sons
[49:57] and your daughters shall prophesy nobody
[50:01] but what did we do in America in 1956 we
[50:06] shut the door
[50:09] hallelujah we closed the door amen -
[50:13] revival and the prophet of God said that
[50:15] year was America's last year to repent
[50:19] and they would not repent God brought
[50:22] Billy Graham God brought all of us God
[50:24] brought William Branham off the scene
[50:26] back to America but she would not repent
[50:30] hallelujah
[50:32] remember God gave Jezebel space to
[50:35] repent and she would not God gave Israel
[50:38] space to repent and he would not God has
[50:41] given America repented a space to repent
[50:44] and she will not hallelujah
[50:47] now what God is doing he's literally
[50:50] hand picking those who would be willing
[50:55] to repent and come into his word
[50:58] hallelujah you got to realize this right
[51:02] no I was in the arc for seven days
[51:05] before the rain fell seven days and can
[51:16] you imagine how it must have been
[51:18] knowing that the judgment is getting
[51:20] ready to strike and everybody's laughing

[51:25] happen and it's fake he's been in there

[51:31] happened whoo but they didn't know in
[51:34] God's time he had one more day all right
[51:37] and when the rain fell amen there was no
[51:40] way of changing their minds that's why I
[51:44] tell everybody that everybody in Hell is
[51:46] a believer but it's too late you and I
[51:54] must
[51:55] and that this message we look like Lulu

[53:15] time and we're at battle you know we're
[53:17] in the battle everybody who's really a
[53:20] Christian note that we are in intense
[53:22] battle even if you don't have the line
[53:25] to turn back Satan is trying to slow you
[53:28] down in every way that he can he's
[53:31] trying to slow you down

[53:49] nobodies and make somebody out of them
[53:54] can you imagine
[53:56] Pharisees and Sadducees what they gonna
[53:58] think when they see that little one
[54:01] woman they were getting ready to stone
[54:02] for adultery hallelujah
[54:05] sitting among the holy people think
[54:09] about it you think about your neighbors
[54:12] you think about your work huh uh uh
[54:13] [Applause]
[54:15] friends and all Amen that one day
[54:18] they're seeing you sitting among what we
[54:20] call the Rye that's if they don't repent
[54:26] can you imagine with all of those
[54:29] skeptics Amen fell in the ant eluvian
[54:33] day went down into hell and didn't find
[54:35] nor there the man who they thought crazy
[54:40] was absence here we had a time that they
[54:48] talked about rebuilding the temple Oh
[54:51] all right listen let me tell you
[54:53] something this that was the name I was
[54:54] trying to think of the other day I met
[54:56] Gershon Salomon in the year 2000 where
[54:59] my wife and I went over there in
[55:01] Jerusalem beautiful time I understand
[55:04] why people want to stay there I'm
[55:06] telling you if you can afford it it'd be
[55:08] a lovely thing time to go and and visit
[55:11] because they talked about presence of
[55:12] the Lord if you've had any kind of
[55:15] experience with God as soon as you get
[55:17] in the country you feel him there
[55:19] seriously
[55:20] takes away all fear and stress they
[55:24] can't get out of there they can't get
[55:26] out of that place they stayed they they
[55:28] stuck by that by the Holy Ghost and you
[55:31] look at and they're getting ready to
[55:32] rebuild and the world don't want it to
[55:36] happen and God says it will be and God
[55:45] or the man by the name of Trump - to do
[55:48] this now he may have all his errors and
[55:51] all his faults but so does every
[55:53] president and all I can say to you by
[55:58] the grace of God is that one thing I
[56:01] know it took a lot of boldness a lot of
[56:04] courage and some unction from God to do
[56:08] heat it ain't backing up people he's not
[56:12] backing up like I said this morning we
[56:16] don't have to fear God our man we don't
[56:19] fear man
[56:20] I understand I don't care who he is how
[56:23] powerful he is your God is greater than
[56:27] any man if he's not a Christian you take
[56:31] the approach you take the attitude what
[56:35] o earth can this uncircumcised
[56:37] philistine do for to me hallelujah for
[56:42] those who need green cars for those who
[56:44] reach citizenship so it doesn't matter
[56:46] what but laws have been passed God has a
[56:50] way you should never give up on God and
[56:54] what God can do for you
[56:59] hallelujah surely if God can make you a
[57:03] citizen of heaven he can make you a
[57:04] citizen of America whatever you choose
[57:09] I'm trying not to get excited but we're
[57:13] living in a time when they rip
[57:14] rebuilding there now for what I
[57:17] understand they're training the temple
[57:19] guards Alleluia you know what the temple
[57:23] guards they were the guards that who
[57:25] guarded the temple because inside of the
[57:28] temple was the Queen and the king that
[57:31] was the Holies of Holies
[57:33] oh come on somebody realize that mercy
[57:37] sea represents you is that right
[57:43] because you're the one that the devil
[57:45] always wanted I will ascend into heaven
[57:48] I will exalt myself above what the stars
[57:51] of God you're the one he always wanted
[57:56] God's wife
[57:59] is that right you saw I proved that
[58:01] that's why the serpent went 3e he was
[58:05] expressing Lucifer's thoughts
[58:10] hallelujah but my god and your God hear
[58:17] your names in the Lamb's Book of Life
[58:20] before the foundation of the world
[58:23] I like that message brother Simmons
[58:25] preach he said meet me in Jerusalem
[58:27] hallelujah
[58:29] will you meet me there let me move on
[58:34] Gershom Solomon said he was in that
[58:38] six-day war and he said it was only a
[58:44] few of them he said there's no way they
[58:45] should have won he said but brother
[58:50] Brooke she said when that tank hit me
[58:52] that tank a tank
[58:53] humming tank rolled over him now he
[58:55] lives he lives hey roll over him he
[59:00] should have been dead he said but the
[59:03] pillar of fire he said there was a light
[59:05] come to me and spoke out of that light
[59:07] and said you will not die because I have
[59:11] a special work for you to do it was in
[59:16] that law where the Assyrians said there
[59:19] were angels there were more men than
[59:21] there were I think they had what they
[59:23] call it a larger effect don't you fear
[59:26] Lord open up the eyes so he didn't like
[59:29] see and that's what God wants us to see
[59:32] their lure of us than it is of them I
[59:36] was able to set just think about nothing
[59:39] about that I said Lord I was sitting
[59:41] there who who should know who this man
[59:44] is
[59:44] I was sitting right there with this man
[59:48] who had seen God in a way face to face
[59:53] and if you own this
[59:56] and amen when the pillar of fire come to
[59:58] you and speak to you directly that
[1:00:02] proves your prophet or some kind hello
[1:00:07] check the scripture whoever he may be I
[1:00:12] had the opportunity of sitting at his
[1:00:15] table and he looked around and he says
[1:00:17] oh my god is that God is getting ready
[1:00:19] to do something there's seven preachers
[1:00:21] in this room he did something for me
[1:00:25] saying these things because it's almost
[1:00:27] over
[1:00:30] we're the time where people I'm telling
[1:00:33] you it's okay to plan it's okay to look
[1:00:35] forward to the future but the greatest
[1:00:38] thing a man can do is to make sure his
[1:00:40] anchor holds and grips the solid rock
[1:00:43] because when God says that's enough it
[1:00:47] doesn't matter what you have invested in
[1:00:50] in life it's gonna all crumble am I
[1:00:54] making sense listen when I said this
[1:00:58] morning how this Gentile age when God
[1:01:03] has promised to do great things for us
[1:01:06] right and you and I must understand that
[1:01:10] it's not just bringing us I would haird
[1:01:16] knowledge but it's also preparing us the
[1:01:19] Bible said at midnight there was a cry
[1:01:21] made go ye out to meet him so that means
[1:01:25] they were in somewhere and they'd leave
[1:01:27] from wherever they were to go meet him
[1:01:29] right so they left where they were maybe
[1:01:33] their nomination may be on the street
[1:01:34] maybe in a club wherever they were they
[1:01:36] had to leave out of that place to go
[1:01:39] meet him right and the Bible said they
[1:01:42] had oil and extra oil that's Matthew 25
[1:01:45] just having Christianity is not enough
[1:01:47] to make a rapture you may be saved I
[1:01:50] don't want to just be saved I'm dry I
[1:01:53] want to make a rapture
[1:01:55] I want the oil on with the extra oil
[1:01:57] whatever it takes I don't want my light
[1:02:01] to go out and that's what's happening
[1:02:04] the winds of destruction are blowing and
[1:02:07] they're trying to pull out every light
[1:02:09] that they can every Christian light if
[1:02:12] you find that your life is somehow
[1:02:14] dwindling you need to get to the altar
[1:02:16] you need more fuel on the fire
[1:02:19] hallelujah you need a revival because
[1:02:22] you don't need your light to go out at a
[1:02:25] time like this almost over understand
[1:02:39] there was one thing just before the
[1:02:42] destruction of Sodom and the Bible said
[1:02:46] as it was in the days of Sodom as it was
[1:02:47] in the days of Noah so shall it be at
[1:02:49] the coming of the Son of Man
[1:02:50] we found a prophet three men coming by
[1:02:56] Abraham's house hallelujah three minutes
[1:03:00] coming by Abraham house and you know
[1:03:03] whatever how you want to call them but
[1:03:06] all I know is that when Abraham saw them
[1:03:09] he said Lord
[1:03:11] hello Rd and that's what it is the
[1:03:14] revelation of the Trinity is one not
[1:03:18] three gods one God manifested in three
[1:03:21] offices now y'all know that one day
[1:03:24] you're gonna have to be proven a lot of
[1:03:29] people don't even know how important it
[1:03:30] is to be baptized in the name of Lord
[1:03:32] Jesus Christ but when you are baptized
[1:03:34] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:35] it proves that you're no longer of the
[1:03:38] Catholic Church because the Catholic
[1:03:40] Church was the first to who actually
[1:03:42] brought that in and whenever you baptize
[1:03:45] in that Trinitarian baptism you still
[1:03:47] are Catholic she is your mother
[1:03:51] y'all understand me because you say oh
[1:03:55] I'm not deep you deep enough for that
[1:03:57] and if you just got the baptism you
[1:04:00] gonna have to prove that you really
[1:04:01] believe that when she comes with her
[1:04:04] pressure oh you say it doesn't matter it
[1:04:07] does I've worked in prisons and because
[1:04:10] we baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:04:12] Christ we could not have service yet
[1:04:16] they gave it to the Muslims
[1:04:20] why because the Muslim is a branch off
[1:04:23] of that they all related now they know
[1:04:26] that it's true
[1:04:28] they have married did you all know that
[1:04:30] in their worship they call it lady
[1:04:35] Fatima they even have rosaries
[1:04:40] they look like nuns don't they
[1:04:43] okay case is dismissed so I want you to
[1:04:47] understand all of this stuff is tied in
[1:04:49] because you understand that the thing
[1:04:51] that we ought to watch is not it's not
[1:04:54] to us uh what's that word um uh yeah he
[1:05:01] said watch the purple curtain oh I I
[1:05:05] wish I could show you this picture how
[1:05:07] they have in service with the Cardinals
[1:05:09] and and the Pope in in all of us and I'm
[1:05:12] not preaching just on the Pope because
[1:05:13] they down my organization is this is bad
[1:05:15] this is me and and you must understand
[1:05:19] they're literally how she said bedecked
[1:05:21] and purple and dictum and and and in
[1:05:23] scarlet and with the golden I got a
[1:05:25] picture of it I'm embarrassed culture
[1:05:28] with the golden cup oh it's just amazes
[1:05:32] me and my point is it is so simple
[1:05:36] people who didn't pass it all or it
[1:05:39] we're not against people they're good
[1:05:43] people in every system but it's the
[1:05:47] system that's why the church at large we
[1:05:50] don't have the supernatural power we
[1:05:52] supposed to have why because a house
[1:05:55] divided can't stand and left his Baptist
[1:05:59] Presbyterian all of them everybody that
[1:06:02] feel about Holy Ghost supposed to be
[1:06:03] united by that spirit but but systems
[1:06:07] keeps us away from one another but
[1:06:12] they're coming to squeeze it's gonna
[1:06:15] break every barrier down hallelujah
[1:06:18] it's gonna come a time when they start
[1:06:20] boycotting the true believer Oh Lord
[1:06:22] y'all i'ma tell you is closer than what
[1:06:24] you think you're gonna be so glad to see
[1:06:29] a real Christian you won't care what
[1:06:30] brand they wear
[1:06:31] that's the word of your prophet
[1:06:34] hallelujah somebody that's gonna call on
[1:06:37] the name of gene oh you you made it ha
[1:06:40] ha you ain't gonna ask where you go
[1:06:44] who's your pastor what Saul believe you
[1:06:48] gonna be so scarce true believers would
[1:06:51] become scarce because all those who are
[1:06:54] faking it will become part of the system
[1:06:56] and when they do they will receive the
[1:06:59] mark of the beast preacher who would say
[1:07:03] that I'm gonna join in with this Union
[1:07:05] because as Lisa to give the people a
[1:07:08] place to worship brother and say that's
[1:07:10] exactly what they're gonna say and he
[1:07:12] said and they won't know that they
[1:07:14] receive in the mark of the beast is that
[1:07:19] right is that what Nimrod did he forced
[1:07:22] unity and that's what this world will do
[1:07:25] force unity and the Bible said adds when
[1:07:28] they come to that place where they said
[1:07:30] peace he said then sudden destruction
[1:07:32] will come is this okay I'm trying to
[1:07:36] finish now you realize hey men by God's
[1:07:39] grace that all six those trumpets were
[1:07:41] sounded under this is what it was when
[1:07:45] you and I understand that the six seven
[1:07:48] seals when those seals were open the
[1:07:51] Prophet God said those trumpets sound
[1:07:52] between a fifth and a sixth seal and you
[1:07:57] know I didn't know that but that 60o
[1:07:58] revealed that that trumpet sounded and
[1:08:01] it gathered the Jews together
[1:08:04] it was Hitler Starlin and Mussolini that
[1:08:08] drove them why why did the Jews have to
[1:08:11] suffer so much because at Calvary when
[1:08:15] Herod says what he said you take
[1:08:18] Barabbas or you take Jesus and the Jews
[1:08:22] says we take Barabbas and let jesus
[1:08:25] blood be on us and our children that's
[1:08:29] why the Jews have a hard time because of
[1:08:31] what their forefathers said remember I
[1:08:34] said words have power
[1:08:37] words have force is that right remember
[1:08:41] even when that tribe of a guy which try
[1:08:42] to lost they all came out of Egypt
[1:08:45] they always at the Jordan right and and
[1:08:48] and and God told him said go over there
[1:08:50] and conquer right the land ten of the
[1:08:53] spies came back with bad reports saying
[1:08:56] that we could not we couldn't because
[1:08:58] there were giants in the land is that
[1:09:00] right and then those tribes cursed
[1:09:02] themselves and God said because you said
[1:09:05] you can't go over because you can't said
[1:09:07] you can't do this you'll remain here and
[1:09:10] your children will to see never say what
[1:09:15] you can't do the Bible said we can do
[1:09:17] all things through Christ I'm almost
[1:09:20] done not done but foolish virgins that's
[1:09:24] where the tribulation comes in how many
[1:09:26] all know that remember amen when when
[1:09:29] Jesus was born and Herod said go kill
[1:09:34] all the children and the Bible said the
[1:09:36] cry of Rachel was heard Rachel crying
[1:09:40] for her children see because what
[1:09:42] happened the raw you'll see who was
[1:09:44] Jesus he was dead angel came back Knight
[1:09:48] said get out of the city and go down
[1:09:50] into Egypt why because there's a
[1:09:53] slaughtering angel coming by hallelujah
[1:09:56] like the bride escaping and all the food
[1:09:59] is left behind all those children heads
[1:10:02] bashed up against the wall and
[1:10:03] everything else trying to find the royal
[1:10:06] seat
[1:10:08] hallelujah oh come on somebody
[1:10:10] remember amen that's what the Prophet
[1:10:13] God said he said even now he said they
[1:10:15] will come when they come to destroy the
[1:10:17] bride will go up but it is a foolish
[1:10:21] that will see the same time that Moses
[1:10:25] and Elijah is released they will be here
[1:10:28] to see that they will know that mr.
[1:10:31] rapture they will know they've got to
[1:10:34] suffer for the name of Jesus and think
[1:10:37] about it no more anointing for them
[1:10:41] there's no anointing no holy goes for
[1:10:44] them
[1:10:45] yeah that's here I could quote it that
[1:10:52] gray
[1:10:52] tribulation comes at the same time why
[1:10:56] because the Bible said that that old
[1:10:57] Antichrist that old beast that old devil
[1:10:59] he's going to kill everything that
[1:11:01] called themselves God anything that
[1:11:05] relates to God who really is a child or
[1:11:07] a son or daughter of God he's going to
[1:11:09] kill it and that's me and Jew and
[1:11:10] Gentile this okay so you and I know Amen
[1:11:22] that we're living in a time it's about
[1:11:25] there shall be light that's the
[1:11:27] only reason that things they're making
[1:11:28] us see things that we can see that
[1:11:29] there's like this word this message
[1:11:31] caught causes us to see who the
[1:11:33] Antichrist is when some people think is
[1:11:36] an Arab and some people think it's China
[1:11:38] and some people think is a nation it's a
[1:11:41] man and what we do not see is that he's
[1:11:45] ruling things right now and the world
[1:11:48] don't see it Pentecostals eating it up
[1:11:50] like like nothing falling right into it
[1:11:55] Carles and people oh my god
[1:11:58] the mark is now happening right now and
[1:12:01] if anybody if you choose your
[1:12:03] denomination over the Word of God be
[1:12:06] careful

[1:12:31] me grace to always stand on the truth of
[1:12:33] the word you know I mean I don't want to
[1:12:35] go astray I don't want to go off nowhere
[1:12:37] people say well you know you don't know
[1:12:39] much I know enough to get to heaven and
[1:12:41] that's all that matters

[1:16:08] such a fearful state there won't be
[1:16:10] somebody nobody appeared then ah oh I

[1:16:24] truth it's almost over
[1:16:26] I'm so glad about election I love
[1:16:30] election cuz election takes me and brick
[1:16:33] before I was born God elected me he
[1:16:36] elected you he chose you you know and
[1:16:39] you know when you're elected how do you
[1:16:41] know because you know you're different
[1:16:43] no matter how I ran from God for a long
[1:16:46] time I did I got into a lot of trouble
[1:16:49] because I ran from God I got scars right
[1:16:52] now cuz I ran from God but at the time
[1:16:54] when God finished with me I was saying
[1:16:57] yes lo whatever you will be done is that
[1:17:01] right oh yes because he cannot let you
[1:17:04] go he said I never lost one hallelujah
[1:17:08] I'm so glad that I have a shepherd - who
[1:17:11] will chase you when you give up he
[1:17:15] doesn't ooh is that right
[1:17:21] look at all the stuff
[1:17:22] for him did and I can't saying that in
[1:17:24] Abraham but one thing I know is he you
[1:17:27] know like I said when Abraham put his
[1:17:29] wife on the line like that and said you
[1:17:32] know say it you say to say you my sister
[1:17:34] and that man was gonna take her he was
[1:17:37] gonna take her now I don't know what I
[1:17:39] can do that you know but Abraham did it
[1:17:42] and and and God never spanked him for it
[1:17:46] why because it was an unconditional
[1:17:49] covenant in other words instead of
[1:17:54] spanking Abraham God defended him no
[1:17:58] weapon formed against you shall prosper
[1:18:01] even those who stand at the judgment you
[1:18:04] would judge them that's the word it's
[1:18:12] not that you didn't do wrong God said
[1:18:14] unconditionally I have justified you
[1:18:20] they shall be mine saith the Lord I love
[1:18:22] that so I love that they shall be mine
[1:18:24] but anyway I'm almost done you and I
[1:18:27] must understand Amen that God when God
[1:18:31] he does times and seasons and that's
[1:18:33] what Daniel said Daniel said blessed be
[1:18:36] the name of God for ever and ever for
[1:18:38] wisdom and light our hears and he
[1:18:40] changes his times in the season he
[1:18:43] removeth kings and set it up kings he
[1:18:45] giveth wisdom unto wise and knowledge up
[1:18:48] to them that North under no
[1:18:49] understanding he revealed the deep and
[1:18:52] secret things he knoweth what is in the
[1:18:54] darkness and the light dwell it with him
[1:18:57] I thank thee and praise thee o thou God
[1:19:00] of my father who have given me wisdom
[1:19:02] and light and has made me known unto me
[1:19:06] excuse me and it's made known unto me
[1:19:09] now what we desire of thee but thou has
[1:19:13] now made known unto us the King's
[1:19:15] matters you understand me
[1:19:18] so we realized to a man that God used
[1:19:21] Daniel to interpret dreams go all in
[1:19:25] your life
[1:19:26] that's what preaching does does the
[1:19:28] preacher don't know what you're going
[1:19:30] through but God knows and he can get
[1:19:32] right in there where you think you
[1:19:33] hiding hallelujah
[1:19:36] I'm glad he's able to do that I want him
[1:19:39] to show me where on the era I don't want
[1:19:41] to come up to God I want all my scenes
[1:19:44] to go before me I don't want nothing
[1:19:46] coming behind me what's that you got
[1:19:48] there that trail about it I don't want
[1:19:50] nothing I wanted a hug go before me
[1:19:52] because get a catch too Blair I'm almost
[1:19:59] done I keep saying that but it's true
[1:20:01] but of times and season brothers you
[1:20:03] have no need that I write unto you for
[1:20:05] yourself know perfectly that the day of
[1:20:07] the Lord so cometh as a thief in the
[1:20:09] night for when they shall say peace and
[1:20:11] safety then sudden destruction cometh
[1:20:13] upon them as travail upon a woman with
[1:20:15] child and they shall not escape did
[1:20:18] y'all know that they say that since that
[1:20:20] our volcano erupted there in in in
[1:20:25] Hawaii that damn Yellowstone is now
[1:20:29] making some noise and mount st. Helen
[1:20:34] and you got to realize if these things
[1:20:37] go off forget about America will be
[1:20:42] plunged into Ice Age but you got to know
[1:20:46] also that it's not the way it's going to
[1:20:47] happen but supposedly not supposedly but
[1:20:52] win California drop you say God will do
[1:20:56] such a thing
[1:20:57] ask those people who were in Capernaum
[1:20:59] Capernaum who would not hear the gospel
[1:21:03] right ask those people who are now under
[1:21:07] the Dead Sea that's Sodom ask them that
[1:21:12] God means what he said he meant what he
[1:21:14] said hallelujah and he said well I can't
[1:21:18] understand I heard a man say the other
[1:21:20] day on this thing he said it was they
[1:21:23] were dealing with earthquakes and stuff
[1:21:25] that happened in Jamaica and this man
[1:21:27] was who was doing a mission work and he
[1:21:31] said with all he said you are servant of
[1:21:33] God you're doing God's work he said no
[1:21:35] he said God did this
[1:21:38] now they blame the earthquake on God
[1:21:43] let's go back to the original who caused
[1:21:46] all this noise who caused all the earth
[1:21:49] to quake
[1:21:50] who calls death who calls amen it was
[1:21:54] the devil but you see people blame the
[1:21:58] death bring things that the devil does
[1:22:00] on God if there was no sin when we would
[1:22:04] be living in paradise

[1:28:30] gonna have a baby the last sign to the
[1:28:33] Gentile was discernment
[1:28:36] that's why brother Brendan had that
[1:28:38] discernment we won't get we won't see
[1:28:41] another gift like that one in a million
[1:28:44] it doesn't come all the time and that
[1:28:47] was the mystery of the Seventh Seal to
[1:28:49] afford Gentile prophet to come with such
[1:28:53] a discernment
[1:28:54] what was it Christ in the man we don't
[1:28:57] worship him hallelujah
[1:29:00] like I try to tell people y'all don't
[1:29:02] understand this thing is simple but you
[1:29:05] never hear Rebecca said Oh Isaac you
[1:29:08] should have heard what Eliezer was
[1:29:09] talking about I mean he'll he either
[1:29:12] talked to me the whole time and I tell
[1:29:15] you what it was so good but what did he
[1:29:17] talk about he talked about Isaac but
[1:29:22] you'll never hear Rebekah saying that
[1:29:24] can you imagine
[1:29:28] as soon as she saw Isaac she leapt off
[1:29:31] the horse
[1:29:31] there are did the camel you understand
[1:29:37] me that camera represented the whole
[1:29:39] egos right so I'm closing it's all
[1:29:43] almost over we know now that America is
[1:29:53] standing for the Jews but according to
[1:29:56] prophecy she's going to turn will it be
[1:30:01] in the next election we don't know but
[1:30:06] everybody
[1:30:07] curse the Jews is cursed of God and
[1:30:10] everybody that blessed the Jews is
[1:30:12] blessed of God you and I know that evil
[1:30:17] is multiplying people have become
[1:30:20] knowledge lawlessness is ruling our
[1:30:25] schools our churches you can go to
[1:30:29] church looking like anything they don't
[1:30:36] care they just want members and money
[1:30:40] and they won't tell the people it
[1:30:43] matters you know I look at things and I

[1:31:06] know and I've seen a lot of things a lot
[1:31:09] of transitions a lot of things a lot of
[1:31:10] people attitude change toward God my
[1:31:13] wife and I my daughter and I was looking
[1:31:15] at something on the YouTube and they was
[1:31:17] really saying some nice songs and
[1:31:18] praising God and Holly nobody's moving I
[1:31:21] could remember when that Holy Ghost was
[1:31:24] so fresh even in the Apostolic Church
[1:31:25] when one when the Holy it was like ways
[1:31:28] the Holy Spirit come it would get so
[1:31:33] milky milky cloudy oh yeah thank God for
[1:31:40] a prophet who said it was the same
[1:31:41] anointing and people lived the life now
[1:31:51] it's difficult to find cuz pleasure our
[1:31:57] enemy y'all know the enemy easy living
[1:32:00] have made Christians so doughy mushy and
[1:32:04] saw we can't hardly take a little
[1:32:08] persecution you can't take
[1:32:11] tribulation yeah y'all know true but you
[1:32:17] know what the word I thought God said
[1:32:19] girdle up to launder your mind pull
[1:32:21] yourself together
[1:32:22] dust yourself off Zion you've fallen in
[1:32:26] the dust get up from there acknowledge
[1:32:29] who you are
[1:32:30] speak your deliverance speak your
[1:32:33] victory
[1:32:34] yes David said yes you uncircumcised
[1:32:37] philistine you come with your sword you
[1:32:40] come with your armor you come with all
[1:32:41] that but I come in the name of the Lord
[1:32:43] and I'm gonna take your head off not
[1:32:46] tomorrow
[1:32:47] this day that woman's will you know that
[1:32:54] later whose baby had died and and then
[1:32:57] she says whatever you do servants it
[1:32:59] don't she don't know pause don't stop
[1:33:02] for nobody you know what I'm saying when
[1:33:03] you kept with faith grabs a hold of you
[1:33:05] don't stop for nobody no stop signs no
[1:33:11] yield sign
[1:33:11] nothing nothing don't stop for nobody
[1:33:13] because everybody don't believe like you
[1:33:15] believe hallelujah right and when you
[1:33:20] get sick and you won't you won't God to
[1:33:22] heal you sometime it's best not to tell
[1:33:24] nobody and if you're gonna tell somebody
[1:33:27] to tell somebody that you know that's in
[1:33:29] favor of your victory I don't hear
[1:33:34] people say well you see they read what
[1:33:35] your soul you read what kind of nonsense
[1:33:37] is that and then when they get sick they
[1:33:39] said Oh Lord I don't know what's going
[1:33:41] on yeah it ain't me then reap what you
[1:33:44] sow where see but anyhow to make a
[1:33:46] long story short I'm closing for sure
[1:33:50] you can stand to help me out you can say
[1:33:56] so that you'll know by God's grace that
[1:33:58] we're living in a time and it's almost
[1:34:00] over what you what there's nothing you
[1:34:04] can do you can't do nothing to live this
[1:34:06] life preach it and tell people about it
[1:34:09] but I found out in my day when we heard
[1:34:12] this message it swept our little town
[1:34:14] and our little city Amen it went through
[1:34:16] the Baptist Church the Methodist Church
[1:34:17] different everybody and guess what all
[1:34:19] of those different churches that did not
[1:34:21] agree with us did not agree with
[1:34:23] themselves
[1:34:24] they came together and unified
[1:34:26] themselves and they had a big town
[1:34:28] meeting and they said whatever you do
[1:34:30] don't let nobody give you one of these
[1:34:32] books what was it it's a message book
[1:34:37] all those churches people who believed
[1:34:40] in women preachers those who didn't
[1:34:42] believe in women preachers they United
[1:34:44] to stop us don't you understand that's
[1:34:47] the best thing they could have done
[1:34:49] because all the little eaglets in that
[1:34:52] system heard about it
[1:34:53] hallelujah because when you start
[1:34:56] Fanning the fire it gets bigger
[1:34:59] hallelujah and the next thing you know
[1:35:01] we had a big church people deacons and
[1:35:05] preachers we need even help to have four
[1:35:06] officers we already had them all ready
[1:35:08] ready ready ready gifts every gift
[1:35:12] operated blind eyes deaf ears open
[1:35:20] salvation we've seen it all that God
[1:35:25] still reigns but you see we were real
[1:35:29] serious then whatever the message said
[1:35:33] is what we believed we didn't have time
[1:35:36] to reason it we didn't have time to push
[1:35:39] it off into another age or another day
[1:35:41] we saw it in the word we believed it and
[1:35:44] we act upon it but now we're so educated
[1:35:47] we got all of these these cliches and
[1:35:51] we've learned so many of the deep things
[1:35:54] of God and all is done it's cooled us
[1:35:58] off hadn't brought no change what
[1:36:01] changes is laid in you and nothing wrong
[1:36:03] with the deep things it's good to know
[1:36:05] who you are but how do you know when you
[1:36:07] know who you are you fight like you know
[1:36:09] who you are David knew who he was and to
[1:36:13] everybody else he looked like a little
[1:36:14] boy but he knew he was a warrior for God
[1:36:17] he knew with God on his side he can
[1:36:20] defeat that giant and every true
[1:36:23] believer believes that no matter how
[1:36:26] Satan attacks you no matter which way he
[1:36:29] comes at you you know that you are been
[1:36:31] laid an overcomer
[1:36:34] hallelujah and you know it
[1:36:37] sometimes you got to stand by yourself
[1:36:40] hallelujah
[1:36:41] you go over here and try to tell them in
[1:36:43] a brother/sister a revelation of what
[1:36:45] God is giving you and they can't see it
[1:36:47] it wasn't meant for them to see it God
[1:36:49] gave it to you and he's wanting you to
[1:36:51] use what he's given to you right oh my
[1:36:55] is that's the way it is
[1:36:57] Gentiles every man for himself
[1:37:03] God don't call us as a group he don't
[1:37:06] call us as a nation how are you I wish
[1:37:09] to God I could say everybody in here
[1:37:11] gonna make a rapture but I can't say
[1:37:13] that because it's an individual affair
[1:37:16] and only God knows your heart hallelujah
[1:37:21] and like I say because you say I believe
[1:37:23] that brother Branham is a prophet I
[1:37:25] believe in the pill of fire that means
[1:37:28] nothing to God if you haven't been born
[1:37:30] again mirror has fallen Moses and
[1:37:35] millions died because they wouldn't take
[1:37:39] heed to what Moses said hallelujah and
[1:37:42] the light figure the same now God is
[1:37:46] raising up a people who's gonna put on
[1:37:49] the whole armor God who's gonna fight
[1:37:51] who's gonna use their words with power
[1:37:54] hallelujah is that right the Bible said
[1:37:57] when he came riding on that white horse
[1:37:58] said the sword was in his mouth he came
[1:38:02] to conquer hallelujah and that's what
[1:38:05] the bride has come to do come we come to
[1:38:07] conquer where say to me fall this riders
[1:38:11] be designed she is designed not to fall
[1:38:15] she believes every word like Paul said
[1:38:17] how to perform and only God knows but
[1:38:19] one thing for certain we will not leave
[1:38:23] out of this place ragged hallelujah we
[1:38:27] will not bring disgrace to God's name we
[1:38:31] will beaten that Maruyama that's
[1:38:33] supernatural army y'all know that's the
[1:38:36] truth the devil a man in those ages
[1:38:38] those for church ages he released his
[1:38:41] horses his red his white horse his red
[1:38:43] horses his you know and all the way down
[1:38:45] to the pale and all that and God loosed
[1:38:48] his man hallelujah he
[1:38:50] since Eagle he loosed his ox yes he
[1:38:53] loses man he looses four beats this is
[1:38:56] what I tried to tell you the other day
[1:38:57] and every one of those four be stuck
[1:38:59] together
[1:39:00] the Bible never turned they always went
[1:39:03] forward no I'm not running I'm going
[1:39:07] forward you're honest damn it all went
[1:39:09] to Barrow Oh what you got a fight like I
