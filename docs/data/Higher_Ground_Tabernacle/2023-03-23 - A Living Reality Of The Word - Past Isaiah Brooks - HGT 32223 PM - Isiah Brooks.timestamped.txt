[28:41] we're gonna call up other teeth she has
[28:43] a testimony amen
[28:45] [Music]
[29:04] do you remember when we used to have
[29:06] testimonies at every service
[29:10] all right
[29:12] this morning I was having a meeting with
[29:16] a
[29:16] brother that does not attend this church
[29:18] but one that I normally see he would
[29:22] probably tell you that he's saved and
[29:25] I know he's prayed and wanted what God
[29:29] has for him nights when he could not
[29:32] sleep but this was not about him only
[29:35] the fact I was with him this morning
[29:38] and I got a call from a man that I used
[29:41] to work with he was the owner of a
[29:43] company
[29:43] was there for about 21 years and I've
[29:46] been gone for three years and you might
[29:49] say well why would he contact you and
[29:52] it'd probably go back to the day that
[29:54] his wife was taking him to the hospital
[29:57] emergency up in Wisconsin and he they
[30:01] called and he said I don't think I'm
[30:03] going to make it to the church but he
[30:04] said would you pray with me he says I
[30:06] think I'm getting ready to die we prayed
[30:09] and God and spared his life and he's
[30:12] still
[30:13] alive today working
[30:16] so this morning just
[30:18] to bring you up to speed quickly he had
[30:22] learned a lot yesterday evening that he
[30:24] had covered
[30:26] I wasn't with him just in case you're
[30:30] concerned but he he had a confirmed case
[30:33] of coven
[30:34] by the time you get up this morning he
[30:36] had a a blood pressure of 140 is that
[30:40] high brother Isaac a little bit a little
[30:43] bit High
[30:44] but he said that the pain was incredible
[30:48] and he asked me if I'd pray with him and
[30:52] pray for him and I told him I was with
[30:54] someone but I would pray as soon as we
[30:56] got done there and
[30:58] did and his wife was taken into the
[31:02] doctor just uh trying to figure out if
[31:05] there's anything else they should be
[31:06] doing
[31:08] and
[31:10] he he said by the time I got there my
[31:12] blood pressure was down to 120. and he
[31:17] said he said no medicine was going to do
[31:20] what God did when you prayed this
[31:22] morning so I just thank God for that
[31:25] opportunity why would he why would he
[31:27] call I mean it's been two and a half
[31:29] years since I left the company why would
[31:31] he call
[31:33] and so every little bit even that run to
[31:37] the hospital that he thought he was
[31:38] going to die two and a half years ago
[31:42] so I thank God for that uh
[31:45] I got to tell you when the prayer
[31:47] happened it wasn't just saying words it
[31:49] wasn't saying a prayer
[31:52] and there was a very clear
[31:55] Oneness with the Holy Spirit and he led
[31:58] me and showed me what to claim scripture
[32:02] and one one of the scriptures was in 30
[32:05] Epistles of John the second verse
[32:09] and John the Lord said I wish that you
[32:13] would be healthy
[32:16] and prosper in all things
[32:20] as you prosper in the spirit
[32:24] in the in the word
[32:26] and so I think we've got to understand
[32:29] that
[32:30] we should be moving mountains we should
[32:34] be the sun should be stopping
[32:37] we have to have the power that the holy
[32:40] spirit is going to lead us into what he
[32:43] has for us
[32:45] and not what we wanted to say a few kind
[32:48] words
[32:49] amen
[32:51] okay amen I appreciate the opportunity
[32:53] and praise God for the next opportunity
[32:59] [Applause]
[33:00] hey man
[33:02] let's sing a couple songs before the
[33:05] password come up or the the most
[33:08] important part of the night

[41:27] the word of God
[41:29] praise the name of the Lord
[41:32] glad to see everybody here tonight
[41:35] and uh
[41:37] we started a little message on Sunday
[41:41] morning on the
[41:43] meaning of Calvary and
[41:45] we told you basically we'll be running
[41:47] kind of like a series
[41:50] that I trust by the grace of God this
[41:53] what was ministered to you on
[41:56] Sunday you still have it in your mind or
[41:58] in your heart
[42:00] because it's so important
[42:03] that we find our place in him
[42:11] we need to know that there's a meaning
[42:13] there's a reason
[42:15] for us being here
[42:17] you know thank God that the Lord don't
[42:20] have us
[42:22] trapped in a fishing Bowl
[42:25] like some fish
[42:27] and all we would
[42:30] basically do is
[42:32] eat and swim around that little jar
[42:36] I don't know how the fish feel but I
[42:38] know
[42:39] how I would feel
[42:41] if I knew that I was made to be free
[42:45] and I was in prison
[42:47] and I know those little animals know and
[42:50] I'm not getting on anybody who's got a
[42:52] fish tank
[42:53] but I'm just saying
[42:56] freedom is a beautiful thing
[42:59] and God intend for all things to be free
[43:03] as we stand let us turn to the scripture
[43:06] amen according to Colossians 1 and 25
[43:13] 1-25
[43:20] you know why
[43:22] don't want anybody to think bad because
[43:24] I go to the zoo but I won't say the zoo
[43:27] is the perfect will of God for animals
[43:31] but nevertheless that's the way the
[43:34] system is work working and so we'll just
[43:37] go with that by the grace of God
[43:40] because one thing that God offers a
[43:42] Christian and that is true freedom
[43:45] and the Bible said he whom the son is
[43:47] set free is free indeed
[43:49] and where the spirit of the Lord there
[43:51] is Liberty
[43:53] I I questioned that
[43:57] not the accuracy of it
[43:59] but what does it mean
[44:02] see every scripture should have that
[44:05] question behind it
[44:07] what does this mean what is the
[44:10] revelation of being free
[44:12] and mean and free indeed
[44:16] definitely free
[44:19] Colossians 1
[44:21] 25-27
[44:25] here Paul writes whereof I am made a
[44:28] minister
[44:30] according to the dispensation of God
[44:34] which is given to me for you to fulfill
[44:37] the word of God
[44:40] even the mystery which have been hid
[44:42] from ages and from Generations
[44:46] but now is made manifest
[44:49] to his Saints
[44:51] remember he didn't say to his saint
[44:54] was that Saints
[44:56] to whom God would make known what is the
[44:59] richest
[45:00] of the glory of this mystery among the
[45:03] Gentiles
[45:05] which is Christ in you
[45:08] the hope of glory
[45:11] let's pray dear Jesus
[45:14] our heavenly father
[45:16] our Heavenly brother
[45:18] praying Lord and King
[45:20] we thank you for this time and
[45:22] opportunity to approach your throne
[45:25] and father we would not be able to do
[45:28] this had not it been for your dear son
[45:30] Jesus Christ in the blood that has been
[45:33] shed for the many sins
[45:35] Lord we thank you today tonight and we
[45:38] pray that you look beyond our faults and
[45:40] see our needs
[45:42] cleans us from all unrighteousness fill
[45:45] us and refill us with your Holy Spirit
[45:47] until we come to the perfect statue of
[45:50] Christ until we come to the unity of the
[45:53] spirit
[45:54] until we come Lord and be one totally
[45:57] one with you
[45:58] in your name Jesus Christ we thank you
[46:00] for all things
[46:02] amen
[46:03] you may be seated
[46:08] in working with the scripture the
[46:11] meaning of Calvary the first thing we
[46:14] must do is go back to the beginning
[46:19] even prior to that we understand that
[46:22] God had a plan in his mind in this plan
[46:26] that he had could never fail
[46:28] because it was God
[46:31] we call these this plan or plans we call
[46:36] it the thoughts of God
[46:38] and God uttered those thoughts and those
[46:41] thoughts became words and those words
[46:43] became a living manifestation of the
[46:47] reality of God
[46:48] and the Bible said that everything God
[46:50] spoke
[46:51] was made
[46:53] those invisible things that would not be
[46:55] possible for us to see God made them
[46:58] visible
[47:00] in his own creation he condescended
[47:03] into a lower state
[47:05] into a third dimension like what we live
[47:08] in
[47:09] so that we can feel so that we can see
[47:11] and so we can touch
[47:13] even in the time of of Adam and Eve they
[47:17] had something that we didn't have before
[47:18] the fall
[47:20] because not only did they were able to
[47:23] hear the voice but they were able to see
[47:25] The Voice
[47:27] and so we realized by grace of God the
[47:30] voice in itself was a man
[47:32] and the Bible said he walked in the cool
[47:35] of the evening
[47:37] he was the same man that took that
[47:39] little lamb and and uh basically uh slew
[47:44] it uh for the saving of Adam and Eve and
[47:47] wrapped them in bloody coats Amen to
[47:51] protect them from the Judgment of God
[47:54] so we realized by the grace of God that
[47:57] God has always dealt with man
[47:59] mankind is the highest order of his
[48:02] creation
[48:03] because man was made in His image and
[48:06] his likeness
[48:08] but we realized by God's grace but man
[48:10] fell
[48:12] and when he did fall he marred the image
[48:16] he was no longer in complete image or a
[48:19] complete likeness of God
[48:21] and so therefore be he was he was
[48:25] deformed
[48:26] from being the Son of God
[48:29] to the son of man
[48:32] and we became Sinners when Once We Were
[48:36] Saints
[48:37] but let me go on to say that my subject
[48:41] tonight would be a living reality of the
[48:45] word
[48:46] we realize and we do believe that God in
[48:49] his word is one
[48:51] and when God ever speaks something it
[48:54] may take a time for it to come to pass
[48:57] but it'll never fail
[48:59] the Bible said that the word of God will
[49:01] never return unto him void
[49:04] you know we've been taught by the
[49:06] prophet of God that we have to wait on
[49:08] God and wait for God
[49:11] because the Bible tells that in his time
[49:14] he makes all things beautiful
[49:17] and no matter what you desire the Bible
[49:20] said whatever you saw whatsoever you
[49:23] desire and pray
[49:25] believing that you shall receive it it
[49:27] said he said
[49:28] it shall be given
[49:31] but I just want to illustrate a few
[49:33] little things that to to kind of build a
[49:36] platform of where we're going tonight
[49:40] there was a time in history where
[49:42] there's a Prophet by the name of Isaiah
[49:46] and according to Isaiah 7 and 14 he
[49:49] prophesied
[49:51] by way of vision a virgin
[49:55] conceiving
[49:56] and bringing forth a son
[49:59] And that son would be called Emmanuel
[50:03] meaning God With Us
[50:06] and it took hundreds of years
[50:09] before that prophecy ever came to pass
[50:14] and but because it was the word it had
[50:17] to come to pass
[50:20] Isaiah 7 14 found a Virgin by the name
[50:25] of Mary
[50:26] and it's amazing
[50:29] because I'm sure there were plenty of
[50:31] virgins in that day but there was one in
[50:34] particular
[50:35] that was ordained and elected by God to
[50:39] bring forth the Christ child
[50:42] and
[50:44] even if the angel would have thought
[50:46] that it should be a different version
[50:49] he couldn't bypass the will of God
[50:53] and he
[50:55] one day Mary
[50:57] doing her regular chores
[51:00] there at the well
[51:02] an angel appeared to her
[51:05] and no doubt she was frightened
[51:08] but one thing I love about this Angel he
[51:12] a true angel of God will always stick
[51:15] with the word
[51:17] and this Angel basically told Mary this
[51:21] thing that is in you
[51:23] is of the Holy Ghost
[51:26] showing that you know she was the very
[51:29] Chosen One
[51:31] that Isaiah 7 14 had prophesied about
[51:36] now think about this hundreds of years
[51:38] later
[51:40] when the mass of men and women
[51:44] calling themselves Christians
[51:47] many have died looking for this virgin
[51:49] and you know after a while
[51:52] it comes to a place where people stop
[51:54] looking
[51:55] it is in those times
[51:58] when most people when you least expect
[52:00] it
[52:01] that's when God shows up
[52:04] and here God tells a woman
[52:07] evidently she was a real Christian or
[52:09] Jehovah uh witness can I say it like
[52:12] that in the true Jehovah Witness since
[52:15] uh believed in God
[52:18] kept herself clean
[52:20] but I wonder did she know the scripture
[52:25] because when the angel said you're going
[52:27] to bring forth a son or bring forth the
[52:29] child she says how can this thing be
[52:33] I don't know no man
[52:36] right so she had to have a little
[52:39] thought going on in her mind but she saw
[52:42] where she was getting nowhere
[52:44] because never in the history of man
[52:47] had a virgin ever conceived
[52:50] so the only way she could conclude this
[52:52] conversation with the angel
[52:55] she had to say be it unto me
[52:58] according to Thy Word
[53:01] right you're the one prophesying it I
[53:04] believe is God so let God make it come
[53:07] to pass y'all hear what I just said
[53:10] you're the one prophesying and the
[53:12] prophecy of God is God
[53:15] so let God bring it to pass
[53:18] right
[53:19] think about it
[53:21] how in the uh scripture according to
[53:24] Hosea how it's written amen that thou
[53:27] shall call my son out of Egypt
[53:30] and hear Moses that scripture refers to
[53:33] Moses where Moses had not yet been born
[53:38] but there's a young child that was born
[53:41] and that child was called Moses
[53:44] and he was born a man in Egypt in the
[53:46] Royal uh vicinity of things and God took
[53:50] a peasant child a child that would have
[53:53] been a Slave
[53:54] and moved him up the ranks and mentally
[53:57] became the man that was next to be
[53:59] pharaoh
[54:01] king of Egypt you see God works in
[54:04] mysterious ways and usually when God is
[54:07] working
[54:08] nobody sees it
[54:10] the enemy is totally blind to what God
[54:14] is doing but yet God is doing it
[54:17] and we find out that Moses became a
[54:21] living reality of the word that would
[54:24] prophesied
[54:25] and the thing about it is he himself had
[54:29] to come to learn who he was
[54:31] amen he didn't realize he didn't know
[54:34] even though he had a mother that told
[54:36] him that he was the deliverer he himself
[54:38] had to come to the realization that he
[54:42] was the chosen one that God had had
[54:45] ordained him to be the deliverer of
[54:49] of the children of Israel and you know
[54:51] what God didn't just drop it in his laps
[54:55] Moses had to suffer
[54:58] Hallelujah think about it he killed An
[55:01] Egyptian in defense of Israel
[55:04] ran as a fugitive
[55:07] from Egypt he didn't look like a
[55:10] deliverer to me
[55:11] not at that time now where did all of
[55:15] this education what did it do for him
[55:17] here he is he's lost his throne and no
[55:20] doubt he probably thought at some point
[55:22] in time God would raise him up
[55:25] to be the Pharaoh but that wasn't God's
[55:27] plan
[55:28] see when God does something man is not
[55:31] in the picture it's all God and God fix
[55:35] it in such a way that no man can get
[55:38] Glory
[55:39] that's right and Moses became the very
[55:43] living reality of the word y'all hear
[55:46] what I'm saying and I'm let me cut it
[55:48] like this it's not enough to say I'm
[55:50] bride
[55:51] there must come an anointing there must
[55:54] come a realization there must come in a
[55:57] Living Word living in you
[56:00] that will declare who you are ah not
[56:05] that you declare who you are the
[56:07] anointing
[56:09] the work that God has for you and me to
[56:12] do will declare Who We Are
[56:15] amen think about it
[56:17] in First Kings 13 and 2 it is prophesied
[56:21] that a son shall be be born unto the
[56:23] House of David and his name Shall be
[56:25] Called Josiah the
[56:27] and Josiah was born
[56:29] and Josiah amen became a king at the age
[56:32] of 12. now you think about this it
[56:37] looked pathetic that God would take a
[56:40] little child such as Josiah
[56:42] but you see God don't care about your
[56:44] age
[56:45] God is concerned about whether you would
[56:48] yield to him
[56:49] see he looks for vessels amen that will
[56:52] yield to him in spite of
[56:56] all oppositions
[56:58] he needs a vessel that will say all
[57:01] things are possible
[57:02] y'all hear what I'm saying that's what
[57:05] he's looking for he need to find people
[57:07] who know that God is God
[57:11] Hallelujah
[57:13] and Josiah became the very reality of
[57:16] the prophecy of first king 13 and 2.
[57:21] see I get excited oh I get excited
[57:28] [Applause]
[57:32] that we're not bribe
[57:35] but we know that God is in control
[57:38] we've got to go through our sufferings
[57:40] we've got to go through our teachings
[57:42] we've got to go through our ups and down
[57:44] towels and our failures Hallelujah but
[57:47] the purpose of God will and shall ever
[57:49] stand
[57:51] Hallelujah
[57:53] the word prophesied became a living
[57:57] reality
[58:00] Eve within herself and I want to call
[58:03] her Eve because I call her Adam you
[58:05] might not know who I'm talking about
[58:07] but before he fell before uh Eve fell
[58:11] her name was Adam
[58:13] so you had to Adam Mr Adam and Mrs Adam
[58:17] but she was a very prophecy in her life
[58:21] she was the one amen God used Amen in
[58:25] type and Shadow
[58:27] to show Calvary and what would be done
[58:30] that that her her husband
[58:34] who's Jesus Christ or whose name was
[58:36] Adam was sacrifice all
[58:40] his whole Kingdom
[58:42] all of his possession everything he
[58:45] owned
[58:46] as a man he sacrificed it for her who
[58:52] was a sinner
[58:54] right he could have allowed her to
[58:56] remain a sinner
[58:58] but because he took her unto himself
[59:02] it was by his blood
[59:04] you say Adam didn't shed no blood yes he
[59:07] did
[59:09] was she conceived
[59:11] amen she conceived by Adam's blood
[59:14] somebody help me here
[59:16] and because of that
[59:19] her life was spared do y'all hear me
[59:23] what do you mean because that's exactly
[59:26] what happened
[59:28] at Calvary
[59:30] and is exactly what happens now
[59:33] if you're going to be saved you have to
[59:36] be saved by the second Adam's blood
[59:40] who is none other than Jesus Christ
[59:43] Hallelujah think about it
[59:47] he was a very Prophecy of the Bride to
[59:50] come
[59:51] that's why brother Branham basically
[59:53] said we're not like Eve but he's saying
[59:56] we're not like her because we're not the
[59:59] ones that are here to disbelieve the
[1:00:01] word
[1:00:02] we are here to believe the word
[1:00:05] Hallelujah in the shadows and types of
[1:00:08] Rahab and Ruth right even Mary they were
[1:00:13] the word of their day
[1:00:15] Hallelujah the prophecy of their day
[1:00:21] that one day God would have a bride
[1:00:24] Hallelujah is that right
[1:00:27] and you and I must understand by the
[1:00:29] grace of God Amen Mary signify amen the
[1:00:34] virgin of the Bride because she was not
[1:00:37] handled by any man
[1:00:40] it was all God
[1:00:42] and so is the bride this day is all God
[1:00:46] God is the one who impregnates you
[1:00:50] Hallelujah and it's by his choice wasn't
[1:00:54] by Mary's
[1:00:55] it was by his choice because God chose
[1:00:59] you and I before the you and me before
[1:01:01] the foundation of the world
[1:01:05] amen hallelujah to do what be his bride
[1:01:10] but he could not bring that to pass
[1:01:13] until there had been a blood sacrifice
[1:01:17] [Music]
[1:01:18] because Adam and Eve have brought a
[1:01:21] Chasm a breach
[1:01:23] Hallelujah there was a separation and
[1:01:26] God Amen could not connect to human
[1:01:29] beings anymore in the way that he did in
[1:01:32] the Garden of Eden before the fall God
[1:01:34] is a holy God God is a righteous God and
[1:01:38] the only way that God could ever do it
[1:01:40] there had to be some innocent blood
[1:01:42] there had to be a sacrifice it couldn't
[1:01:45] be a lamb it couldn't be a goat it
[1:01:48] couldn't be a bull even though these
[1:01:51] things were in types and shadows of the
[1:01:54] Jesus Christ to come it had to be a man
[1:01:58] Hallelujah not just any man Hallelujah
[1:02:02] God didn't send the second person he
[1:02:05] didn't send the third person the meaning
[1:02:07] you understand me he said well what do
[1:02:10] you mean the whole book from Genesis to
[1:02:13] Revelation is a love story
[1:02:16] that God is trying to Anchor Into the
[1:02:19] Heart of his believers
[1:02:22] this is the mystery
[1:02:25] throughout all the churches they're all
[1:02:27] all of the Old Testament
[1:02:30] Israel had no idea what they were doing
[1:02:32] when it came to the sacrifices they were
[1:02:35] just obedient
[1:02:36] they were just obedient to the law there
[1:02:39] was no deep revelation of what they were
[1:02:41] doing
[1:02:41] they had no idea that all of that
[1:02:44] sacrificing and washing of pots and and
[1:02:47] slaying of little doves and you know the
[1:02:49] escape goat and the red heifer and all
[1:02:52] that they had no idea that they were
[1:02:55] prophesying by way of works
[1:02:58] that there's coming a messiah
[1:03:01] Hallelujah there's coming one that would
[1:03:04] take
[1:03:06] the death penalty
[1:03:08] for the one he loves
[1:03:12] he loved her so much
[1:03:14] that's what the Bible said God so loved
[1:03:16] the world that he gave his only begotten
[1:03:18] son that whosoever believeth in him
[1:03:20] should not perish but have everlasting
[1:03:23] life he put the whole salvation plan
[1:03:28] in the hands of Jesus
[1:03:31] in the real Lamb of God
[1:03:34] you know people don't know
[1:03:37] what Jesus went through
[1:03:39] they have no idea
[1:03:41] even people who claim to be in the
[1:03:43] message has never thought about Calvary
[1:03:45] other than it was a historical event
[1:03:49] but in order to understand this love you
[1:03:51] need to understand his suffering that's
[1:03:54] why Paul said it I just don't want to
[1:03:56] know him in the power of his
[1:03:57] resurrection but I want to know him in
[1:03:59] his sufferings
[1:04:00] what did he suffer from me
[1:04:03] why did he suffer for me because he
[1:04:05] loved you
[1:04:07] and he knew that was the price he had to
[1:04:10] pay
[1:04:11] like Adam knew that was the price he had
[1:04:14] to pay to keep e
[1:04:16] Jesus knew that was the price he had to
[1:04:19] pay
[1:04:20] to keep his bride
[1:04:24] he suffered
[1:04:25] with his stripes we're healed
[1:04:28] he was bruised for our iniquities and
[1:04:32] the chastisement of his peace was Upon
[1:04:35] Us y'all hear me he became our sin that
[1:04:39] we might become his righteousness what
[1:04:42] is he trying to get to us that you are
[1:04:45] free
[1:04:47] right up
[1:04:49] when Adam did that
[1:04:52] he saved Eve
[1:04:58] the only thing is he couldn't go no
[1:05:00] further than that
[1:05:01] because he was a man
[1:05:04] but the second Adam was more than a man
[1:05:08] he was God
[1:05:09] and the Bible said in him throughout the
[1:05:12] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:05:17] can I say it like this in him was king
[1:05:20] and queen
[1:05:22] man that's right the first Adam he had
[1:05:26] male and female he was King and she was
[1:05:29] Queen
[1:05:31] Hallelujah and they were the rulers of
[1:05:34] this Earth
[1:05:35] until they fell
[1:05:38] but there's no failure in this bride
[1:05:41] because God has ordained its soul
[1:05:45] hallelujah it's not by power it's not by
[1:05:49] your might but it's by his holy spirit
[1:05:51] it's not him that willeth nor is it he
[1:05:55] that runeth but it's God who shows Mercy
[1:05:57] amen you know I was listening to that
[1:06:00] Hallelujah I was listening to that
[1:06:02] message today God rich in Mercy
[1:06:05] and I was like Lord I need your mercy I
[1:06:09] love your grace but I need your mercy
[1:06:11] too right
[1:06:13] because the Bible said to him that
[1:06:16] knoweth to do good and do what does not
[1:06:18] to him it is sin amen hallelujah that
[1:06:22] precious lamb of God
[1:06:24] our Victory is in Christ
[1:06:28] every battle he fought what do you mean
[1:06:30] brother brooksie what we see Christ we
[1:06:33] see Christ just in in the New Testament
[1:06:36] in Jesus
[1:06:37] but Christ was an Adam
[1:06:40] Christ was in Enoch
[1:06:43] Christ was in Noah
[1:06:45] Christ was in Moses Christ was in Joshua
[1:06:49] and every battle they fought and every
[1:06:53] battle they won it was not human flesh
[1:06:57] that got the battle it was Christ it was
[1:07:00] the Living God working through those
[1:07:03] vessels making his word come to pass
[1:07:06] they were the very living reality of God
[1:07:10] if people could only see it
[1:07:16] all of our victories one is ours
[1:07:21] one
[1:07:23] everything he won everything Victory
[1:07:26] every victory that Jesus Christ won
[1:07:28] that's why Paul said we're more than
[1:07:31] conquerors why because Christ has
[1:07:33] conquered everything
[1:07:35] all we got to do is accept the trophy
[1:07:39] Hallelujah I like the way David said
[1:07:42] this according to Psalm 27 3-6 now I
[1:07:45] want you to I want you to understand I'm
[1:07:48] preaching something here but I want you
[1:07:49] to understand there's a reality to what
[1:07:51] I'm trying to say
[1:07:53] there's a meaning
[1:07:54] you know even my wife and I we're just
[1:07:56] discussing things on our on our way here
[1:07:59] and and you know she has a desire to get
[1:08:01] close to God I have a desire to get
[1:08:04] closer to God and we we agree that we're
[1:08:06] basically going to help each other
[1:08:09] you know in
[1:08:11] than we have before
[1:08:13] see because we understand the season we
[1:08:15] understand the times and as much later
[1:08:18] than what you think and it's at this
[1:08:21] time when people look look like look
[1:08:23] like the message is dead pretty much
[1:08:25] it's not no sir
[1:08:28] mm-hmm
[1:08:30] Hallelujah you see it's like when
[1:08:32] Ezekiel Saw those Dry Bones they look
[1:08:35] real dead
[1:08:37] yeah that's right they weren't dead
[1:08:40] they were still alive
[1:08:41] but you see they were in a different
[1:08:43] dimension
[1:08:44] y'all hear what I'm saying amen and when
[1:08:47] when God Ezekiel said to the Lord Lord
[1:08:50] can these Dry Bones live
[1:08:52] when God said to Ezekiel can these Dry
[1:08:55] Bones live you think he said Lord thou
[1:08:57] know it
[1:08:58] [Music]
[1:08:59] you see what I'm saying now if he had
[1:09:01] looked with his natural eyes it would
[1:09:04] have been impossible and that's what
[1:09:07] people are looking at now perhaps
[1:09:09] they're looking at the message as a
[1:09:10] whole saying it's impossible for those
[1:09:12] people to be what they declare to be
[1:09:16] it's not impossible but that's the way
[1:09:19] God wants it to look it's almost like
[1:09:22] when God Sampson was there defeated by
[1:09:25] the Philistines
[1:09:26] eyes blocked my poked out and
[1:09:29] malnourished and didn't know where he
[1:09:32] was but God Amen was in control
[1:09:36] Hallelujah there was no way Samson could
[1:09:39] lose the battle
[1:09:41] yes sir God raised him up to defeat the
[1:09:44] Philistines and there was no way
[1:09:47] uh Samson was going to die without
[1:09:50] defeating the Philistine even if it
[1:09:53] means his own death y'all hear what I'm
[1:09:55] saying so that's the way his attitude
[1:09:58] was I know God is God and brother
[1:10:01] bedroom said when he felt back then felt
[1:10:03] those locks he said now the anointing
[1:10:05] has returned Hallelujah
[1:10:12] at least a super anointing and that
[1:10:15] anointing has already returned but you
[1:10:19] and I must awaken to it Hallelujah
[1:10:25] you know what I mean this ain't nothing
[1:10:28] in senses but see we have a covenant in
[1:10:31] his unconditional Covenant it's a
[1:10:33] covenant of the seven Thunders a
[1:10:35] covenant of the seventh oh come on folks
[1:10:37] it's real
[1:10:40] this is no I'm not preaching Doctrine
[1:10:42] I'm telling you what is the reality of
[1:10:44] the word
[1:10:45] somebody gotta hear it somebody has to
[1:10:48] receive it and somebody's going to
[1:10:50] perform it
[1:10:52] Hallelujah and I'm so glad to say I'm
[1:10:55] one of them
[1:10:56] Hallelujah if you look for him you will
[1:11:00] see him is that right the Bible said he
[1:11:03] will appear to them who loves his
[1:11:05] appearance appearing is that right he
[1:11:08] will manifest himself to those who love
[1:11:11] his appearing that I don't know about
[1:11:13] you I love his appearing Hallelujah I
[1:11:16] don't have no problem with William
[1:11:18] Branham hallelujah what people say well
[1:11:21] see people what do you mean didn't you
[1:11:24] not know
[1:11:25] that that was the appearing
[1:11:29] that was God and a man
[1:11:31] the world missed it
[1:11:33] they saw a little Kentuckian who
[1:11:36] couldn't speak English clearly or
[1:11:39] properly but in that man
[1:11:42] was the Living God they mocked John the
[1:11:45] Baptist he didn't go to school he wasn't
[1:11:48] a theologian but one thing about John
[1:11:51] that was greater than all of them he was
[1:11:53] able to identify the the Messiah amen he
[1:11:58] called him the Lamb of God
[1:12:01] and the Pharisees and Sadducees called
[1:12:03] him the devil now which one had a better
[1:12:06] understanding
[1:12:08] who
[1:12:10] am I stirred up yes I am
[1:12:14] in Psalms 27 3-6 he said though a host
[1:12:18] selling Camp about against me my heart
[1:12:22] shall not fear amen the war should rise
[1:12:26] against me and this will I be confident
[1:12:30] y'all better understand that scripture
[1:12:32] is also a prophecy you better believe it
[1:12:35] amen just like the prophet said you know
[1:12:38] these scriptures some scriptures have
[1:12:40] compound meanings
[1:12:43] like I called by my son out of Egypt
[1:12:46] what was God doing bringing Israel out
[1:12:49] of Egypt
[1:12:50] but then there was a The Real Son of God
[1:12:52] who was Christ Jesus who was in Egypt
[1:12:55] and he was called out of Egypt
[1:12:59] we we must understand that this thing
[1:13:02] that that that that that's laying it
[1:13:05] looked dormant
[1:13:06] but
[1:13:08] but what is he talking about
[1:13:11] what does this mean
[1:13:14] it sounds like a squeeze to me
[1:13:16] it sounds like a a time where where
[1:13:19] there's going to be a lot of trouble
[1:13:22] Hallelujah and and David is trying on
[1:13:25] the inspiration trying to give us a
[1:13:27] focus one thing I have desired
[1:13:31] that will I seek after
[1:13:34] that I may dwell in the house of the
[1:13:36] Lord all the days of my life to behold
[1:13:39] the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in
[1:13:42] his Temple One Thing
[1:13:44] there's only one thing and that is to
[1:13:47] come into a pure perfect statue of
[1:13:49] Christ
[1:13:50] because I know if I come into the
[1:13:53] perfect statue of Christ when he calls
[1:13:55] me I'm going to hear him
[1:13:57] Hallelujah I might have to suffer
[1:14:00] there's one thing I desire I don't
[1:14:03] desire riches I don't desire Fame I
[1:14:05] don't desire wealth I don't understand a
[1:14:07] great big house I don't care about those
[1:14:09] things the only thing I desire
[1:14:12] amen
[1:14:14] is that is to be in His image
[1:14:17] to be the very literal manifestation
[1:14:22] of the word prophesied about the bride
[1:14:26] let everybody be what they want to be
[1:14:29] he said for in the time of trouble
[1:14:34] [Music]
[1:14:37] is that right what trouble he ain't just
[1:14:39] talking about laws but with that atomic
[1:14:42] bomb began to fall
[1:14:44] before one drop I'll be taken you will
[1:14:48] be taken God would hide Us in his
[1:14:51] Pavilion in the secret place of his
[1:14:54] Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall
[1:14:57] shut me up upon a rock what is that rock
[1:15:01] that revelation of Jesus Christ who he
[1:15:04] is and who I am
[1:15:06] my life is hid in him your life is hid
[1:15:09] in him
[1:15:10] amen why do we worry like we do
[1:15:14] huh have the Holy Ghost and everything
[1:15:16] and the devil try to tell you you don't
[1:15:18] have it normally when he tells you you
[1:15:20] don't have that means you got it
[1:15:22] huh
[1:15:23] the devil ain't never told me the truth
[1:15:27] and my thing is if he
[1:15:30] if he profit from from it
[1:15:32] right yeah well I won't say he never
[1:15:33] told me the truth because there are
[1:15:35] times he told me you ain't nothing but a
[1:15:36] hypocrite well that was true
[1:15:38] but he failed to see I was wearing a
[1:15:40] coat that come
[1:15:43] that caught somebody help me here I was
[1:15:46] covered by the blood
[1:15:50] hiding
[1:15:52] I believe that's where I'm at
[1:15:54] I believe that
[1:15:56] now shall my hair be lifted up above my
[1:15:59] enemies
[1:16:00] round about me no matter what comes my
[1:16:03] way you're not going to get me to drop
[1:16:05] my head in sadness and sorrows therefore
[1:16:08] what I offer his Tabernacle what
[1:16:10] sacrifices of Joy I will sing yeah I
[1:16:15] will sing praises unto the Lord
[1:16:18] that's what the devil hates
[1:16:21] when he saw Peter James and John into
[1:16:23] prison and they began to sing amen amen
[1:16:28] I don't know what they're saying but I I
[1:16:31] I I I I I I I I can almost hear him
[1:16:34] Satan's mad and I'm so glad
[1:16:38] he missed his soul he thought he had
[1:16:45] amen you see the devil don't like your
[1:16:49] praising God and really when you're
[1:16:52] going through trials and you begin to
[1:16:53] praise God that means there's something
[1:16:56] that's settled in your soul
[1:16:58] amen amen you have an understanding of
[1:17:02] who you are
[1:17:03] [Music]
[1:17:05] the Bible says Jesus with joy
[1:17:09] he saw Calvary and he set his face like
[1:17:11] a flint
[1:17:14] he knew where he was going he understood
[1:17:16] where he was going he knew the purpose
[1:17:19] for which he was going
[1:17:21] and that purpose was you and me you and
[1:17:24] I however you want to say it in the
[1:17:25] English way
[1:17:28] right you and I must understand we must
[1:17:31] know amen we cannot let him down people

[1:17:46] messenger you know living dying buried

[1:18:01] message amen listening to it it won't do

[1:18:35] and feast in order to feed you got to
[1:18:38] pull it to end take it in
[1:18:40] right
[1:18:42] here he says in the 32nd uh
[1:18:48] quote how you want to put a paragraph he
[1:18:50] said they're hanging that precious life
[1:18:53] that know nothing but love and doing
[1:18:56] good
[1:18:57] hung there between the heavens and earth
[1:18:59] lifted up there stripped naked
[1:19:03] embarrassed y'all know that the world
[1:19:06] when they put Jesus on the cross they
[1:19:08] got a little linen cloth cloth around
[1:19:10] him that was not reality that is not
[1:19:13] reality he was naked
[1:19:15] do y'all know the feeling of
[1:19:18] right it's terrible
[1:19:25] I just remember when one of my grandsons
[1:19:28] was looking on my camera and saw me with
[1:19:30] my I had taken a before and after
[1:19:32] picture and I had my shirt off
[1:19:34] and I felt like I was Nate I was just I
[1:19:37] was so upset with him
[1:19:40] you know my kids don't see that of me
[1:19:42] that's just how private I am
[1:19:46] and and when they when when he he
[1:19:48] thought it was funny it was showing his
[1:19:50] sister that I want the running High
[1:19:53] my God my children hadn't seen this
[1:19:57] and you show oh God I'll never forget it
[1:19:59] it was so whoa it was it the feeling I
[1:20:02] received was terrible but you know
[1:20:06] Lord help me Jesus
[1:20:08] I don't want to talk too much about it
[1:20:10] because I feel it all over again
[1:20:14] tripped and naked you wouldn't know
[1:20:16] embarrassed to what you what God would
[1:20:19] hang in there I know
[1:20:23] the crucifix has a little thing like
[1:20:27] they had something around him but they
[1:20:29] never did that that's just to put on the
[1:20:32] cross or the all artists put it there
[1:20:36] they stripped his clothes from him he
[1:20:38] had on a road and and they tore it off
[1:20:41] of him and gambled of it he was
[1:20:44] embarrassed to the utmost now can you
[1:20:46] imagine that Jesus Christ took our
[1:20:49] embarrassment how can we ever be
[1:20:53] embarrassed of Jesus Christ how can we
[1:20:56] allow ourselves to be ashamed to be a
[1:20:59] Christian when he took our shame he
[1:21:02] bought our embarrassment and we ought to
[1:21:05] be if I could say it like this proud to
[1:21:07] be Christians happy to be Christians
[1:21:10] never let the devil ever make you feel
[1:21:13] like you some second-class citizen
[1:21:15] because you be you are a Christian let
[1:21:18] me tell you something real Christians
[1:21:20] are real men and real women
[1:21:24] huh yeah to be a Christian is not easy
[1:21:28] you're carrying a cross with you all the
[1:21:31] time but you can focus because you
[1:21:34] realize he carried the cross for us he
[1:21:37] did it for me like the song said
[1:21:40] personalized his his suffering he did it
[1:21:44] for me
[1:21:46] took my shame upon his back for all the
[1:21:49] Crimson flood every time every time I
[1:21:54] think of him oh I I just get excited
[1:21:57] Hallelujah
[1:22:00] Something in My Heart gets stirred is
[1:22:02] that right stripped his clothes from him
[1:22:04] he had on a robe and they tore it off of
[1:22:07] him gambled for it he was embarrassed to
[1:22:11] the utmost he said yet being y'all know
[1:22:14] what I'm saying so embarrassed but there
[1:22:16] was nothing he could grab to clothe
[1:22:18] himself but he had to be stripped
[1:22:22] yeah being God had to stand and sin and
[1:22:26] spit in his face yet the very depths of
[1:22:29] modesty had to die before the public
[1:22:32] stripped naked
[1:22:34] such a fact it took upon him till he
[1:22:37] separated the water and the blood that's
[1:22:39] what they said Solomon said that Jesus
[1:22:42] Christ literally died from a broken
[1:22:44] heart he said that is the evidence when
[1:22:47] the water and the blood separates they
[1:22:49] said that is the evidence of a broken
[1:22:52] heart
[1:22:54] can you imagine his own creation
[1:22:56] crucifying
[1:22:58] and everybody that turns away from Jesus
[1:23:02] Christ you crucify him afresh
[1:23:06] doing it all over again
[1:23:09] Hallelujah think the poet were well
[1:23:13] expressed it when he said
[1:23:15] mid-rending rocks and dark and skies My
[1:23:19] Savior bowed his head and died but the
[1:23:22] open Veil revealed the way to heaven
[1:23:25] Joys and endless days
[1:23:36] joy and endless days Calvary means
[1:23:39] something means more than we can express
[1:23:44] sure
[1:23:46] when it looked like I'm just a failure
[1:23:49] when Satan is tempting me and going at
[1:23:52] me the only thing I can draw upon is
[1:23:56] Calvary
[1:23:57] he died for my sins and another
[1:24:00] scripture when the word of God according
[1:24:02] to Revelation said no man was worthy
[1:24:04] amen no man was worthy Paul wasn't
[1:24:07] worthy Peter wasn't worth it James
[1:24:09] wasn't worthy none of the Old Testament
[1:24:11] saints were worthy to take the book only
[1:24:14] one perfect lamb One Man Without spot
[1:24:18] wrinkle of blemish and that was Jesus
[1:24:20] Christ himself
[1:24:22] Hallelujah hey not even William Brandon
[1:24:25] was worthy he was a great prophet but he
[1:24:29] was a he y'all hear what I'm saying but
[1:24:31] he was created
[1:24:33] this God I'm talking about
[1:24:36] had a portion of him
[1:24:38] that was not created
[1:24:41] he was God many I said see it like this
[1:24:44] before William Brandon was he was he was
[1:24:48] the I am before Moses he says I am
[1:24:53] Hallelujah before you and I I am he's
[1:24:57] the I am sure he had to do it
[1:25:00] the veil hung between man and God
[1:25:03] and that opening Veil revealed the way
[1:25:05] to Heaven's Joy endless days Calvary
[1:25:07] means something means more than we can
[1:25:09] express sure living he loved me dying he
[1:25:13] saved me barely carried my sins far away
[1:25:17] y'all hear what I'm saying these words
[1:25:19] are
[1:25:24] once you're saved truly saved you always
[1:25:28] saved uh
[1:25:31] uh true
[1:25:33] some might be a penny some might be a
[1:25:35] nickel some might be a dime some might
[1:25:38] be a quarter some might be 50 Cent and
[1:25:40] some might be a dollar
[1:25:42] but they all God's change
[1:25:44] and he used them the way he wants to use
[1:25:46] them and let me tell you something
[1:25:48] there's not a man woman or child that I
[1:25:51] want to see lost
[1:25:53] not one I don't care if they're in in
[1:25:56] maximum security in the prison
[1:25:59] maybe they're not murdered many people
[1:26:02] but I tell you what there's not one in
[1:26:05] that maximum security that I want to see
[1:26:07] lost
[1:26:13] people say well how can I forgive him
[1:26:15] well how can God forgive you
[1:26:18] you say you God God on the inside and
[1:26:20] you don't have forgiveness you are a
[1:26:23] liar
[1:26:24] because God will make you forgive if you
[1:26:27] got him he will torment you
[1:26:32] y'all know what I'm saying
[1:26:33] he'll make
[1:26:35] you until you make it right or have a
[1:26:37] torment to come you know what I'm saying
[1:26:39] he'll keep saying that you know you need
[1:26:41] to make it right you know you need to
[1:26:43] make it right you know you need to make
[1:26:44] it right
[1:26:46] yeah I'm talking from experience
[1:26:49] stubbornness can never overcome Jesus
[1:26:54] huh
[1:26:55] see it's been condemned now right right
[1:26:58] sin has no more hold when it's screamed
[1:27:02] at the cross it's finished when he
[1:27:05] screamed at the cross is finished it's
[1:27:07] finished sin died now it's dead it's
[1:27:12] done with it's powerless it's lifeless
[1:27:16] think of it people that sin the enemy to
[1:27:20] him human being is dead and lifeless it
[1:27:24] has no more effect it can't no wonder
[1:27:27] the sun shut off his vision the Stars
[1:27:30] would not Shine the Earth turned black
[1:27:33] it was all being redeemed
[1:27:37] y'all hear what I'm saying now it's dead
[1:27:40] it's buried it's lifeless now you better
[1:27:42] remember these things these things were
[1:27:45] being uttered by the holy spirit amen I
[1:27:48] believe it it's dead it's buried it's
[1:27:52] lifeless
[1:27:53] it has no more life in it then it must
[1:27:57] be buried what was buried the body of
[1:28:00] God was buried for it was the sin
[1:28:03] offering
[1:28:04] Hallelujah it was a burnt lamb it was a
[1:28:08] bird it was burned by the fire of
[1:28:10] iniquity that sinless lamb that no no
[1:28:14] sin that God who no no wrong his life
[1:28:17] had been given and the the there hung
[1:28:21] the sin offering amen amen buried he
[1:28:24] carried my sins away he must be buried
[1:28:27] the body the sin offering was must be
[1:28:31] back y'all hear what he's saying while
[1:28:33] we worried about it he took it upon
[1:28:36] himself
[1:28:37] you've got to believe that if you are a
[1:28:40] true Christian is powerless to you
[1:28:44] because you're covered by the blood
[1:28:47] Hallelujah that's why many after a while
[1:28:50] would walk one by one to this fool to be
[1:28:54] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ why
[1:28:56] something has to to something has took
[1:28:59] place that spirit that came out of that
[1:29:02] body when it scream is finished has
[1:29:05] condemned sin in our bodies and we must
[1:29:07] bury it to be remembered no more I'm so
[1:29:11] glad that it is it y'all hear what I'm
[1:29:13] saying you said what do you mean that's
[1:29:15] what we do that's why we're buried in
[1:29:18] the name of Jesus Christ he was buried
[1:29:21] in his name he
[1:29:23] so we are buried in symbolism so that we
[1:29:27] can say never again will sin reign in
[1:29:30] this model body
[1:29:33] Hallelujah it doesn't mean you won't
[1:29:35] make mistakes but he will not ring
[1:29:38] he'll not be king he'll not imprison me
[1:29:41] again he'll never be a slave to sin
[1:29:44] again why he whom the son is set free is
[1:29:48] free indeed that's what Calvary was
[1:29:50] about to set you free this is what the
[1:29:53] Holy Ghost is about to give you power
[1:29:55] over sin to put Satan under your feet
[1:30:00] hallelujah we're living beneath our
[1:30:03] privilege we've got the power in the
[1:30:06] name of Jesus y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:30:08] we've got the power
[1:30:13] when anything is buried it's hid it's
[1:30:17] out of sight
[1:30:19] and buried he carried my sins away
[1:30:21] God can't see all sins no more for they
[1:30:24] are buried they are buried where in the
[1:30:28] sea of forgetfulness think of a sea of
[1:30:30] forgetfulness God cannot remember them
[1:30:33] no more because they were both dead and
[1:30:35] buried it cannot be even remembered no
[1:30:38] more they're out of God's memory
[1:30:41] so we'll be praying Lord remember what I
[1:30:43] did God said when
[1:30:45] I don't remember
[1:30:48] why we
[1:30:50] when God Has Lifted the burdens
[1:30:54] we must have a reality that he has
[1:30:58] totally set us free he said you are free
[1:31:00] indeed that's a revelation
[1:31:06] what a tragedy when Jesus died
[1:31:10] right what a tragedy amen when Adam
[1:31:13] sinned
[1:31:14] Hallelujah but the sad and the Glorious
[1:31:17] thing about the tragedy of Jesus Amen in
[1:31:20] his tragedy he conquered death Hell In
[1:31:22] The Grave right there was a time in was
[1:31:27] fellowship with God can you imagine
[1:31:30] I wouldn't know what I'd do if I didn't
[1:31:32] have somebody to pray to and I wouldn't
[1:31:34] know what I'd do if I didn't have
[1:31:36] somebody who would answer
[1:31:37] Hallelujah God proves himself every day
[1:31:40] to me
[1:31:41] Hallelujah he talks to me I don't know
[1:31:44] y'all can call it your conscience all
[1:31:46] you want to all I can say is the Lord
[1:31:48] talks to me
[1:31:50] amen hallelujah a tragedy is an event
[1:31:53] causing great suffering destruction and
[1:31:56] distress such as a serious accident
[1:31:58] crime or natural catastrophe is that
[1:32:02] right and I'm telling you it caused all
[1:32:04] of that
[1:32:05] yeah
[1:32:06] yeah
[1:32:09] I don't know what all Adam could see
[1:32:12] when they sinned but he had to do it
[1:32:16] but you know sometimes God keep us blind
[1:32:19] to the reality of things
[1:32:21] what it was going to be like and you
[1:32:23] know what one of the most horrific
[1:32:24] things that happened
[1:32:26] in Adam's life
[1:32:28] God just didn't kill him right off
[1:32:31] you know he didn't die just right off
[1:32:33] but he saw the death
[1:32:35] of his son
[1:32:37] for the first time
[1:32:40] Adam witnessed death to mankind
[1:32:43] and don't don't you know what I'm saying
[1:32:45] when he saw Abel the way he was
[1:32:48] you and I can't imagine what he felt
[1:32:51] because all he could think perhaps was
[1:32:53] I'm to blame
[1:32:58] yeah
[1:32:59] that's if he didn't catch the Revelation
[1:33:01] when God said to that serpent because of
[1:33:03] what you've done right
[1:33:07] amen now with man before he sinned I'm
[1:33:10] closing but don't you miss this
[1:33:13] when man sinned he separated himself
[1:33:16] from God
[1:33:18] and cross the great Castle
[1:33:20] and put himself in death on this side he
[1:33:24] left there was no way back exactly there
[1:33:28] was no way for him to get back but then
[1:33:31] when he did God accepted a substitute
[1:33:33] which was a lamb or a goat or a sheep or
[1:33:37] something for blood which Adam which
[1:33:39] Adam spoke of or able excuse me spoke of
[1:33:42] on the other side of the chasm on that
[1:33:46] side
[1:33:47] see that's that's that was the
[1:33:48] difference when ape will die
[1:33:52] when he died you know he was more like
[1:33:55] like on the law Lord Revenge me
[1:33:58] you know
[1:34:00] but this the the true Lamb of God says
[1:34:03] the father forgive them
[1:34:05] for they know not what they do
[1:34:07] see it's just so amazing how God in
[1:34:10] contrast you know reveal those things
[1:34:13] and and then we we look at ourselves now
[1:34:15] I'm gonna tell y'all he when Jesus's
[1:34:17] father forgive them for they knew not
[1:34:19] what they do he spoke the truth
[1:34:22] they did not know
[1:34:24] just like sometimes we do things and we
[1:34:26] don't understand we don't have the
[1:34:28] knowledge we don't have the Revelation
[1:34:30] or understanding how wrong we are when
[1:34:33] we do certain things oh my God and God
[1:34:36] say forgive them Lord
[1:34:38] hmm
[1:34:40] when man is in and separated put it back
[1:34:42] on the chasm there's no way back but
[1:34:45] then when he did God accepted a
[1:34:47] substitute which was a lamb or a gold or
[1:34:50] sheep or something for blood which Adam
[1:34:52] spoke about being able spoke of on that
[1:34:55] side
[1:34:56] he's a son of God
[1:34:59] spring from God he
[1:35:01] an inheritance
[1:35:02] of the Earth he can control nature he
[1:35:06] can speak into existence
[1:35:09] why he's a Creator himself he he's an
[1:35:13] offspring of God y'all understand me you
[1:35:17] hear what it's being said now these
[1:35:19] words must be lit they must come to life
[1:35:22] there must be a reality to what I just
[1:35:26] read these words were inspired by the
[1:35:29] holy spirit for the bride to catch not
[1:35:33] to hear with her ear but to receive in
[1:35:35] her heart
[1:35:36] Hallelujah but when he crossed he he
[1:35:39] separated his sonship he's a sinner by
[1:35:42] Nature he's under the hands and Dominion
[1:35:45] of Satan everybody that's not born again
[1:35:50] is under the Dominion of Satan is in
[1:35:53] there is ruling them
[1:35:56] huh God took a sacrifice
[1:35:59] a chemical in a of the blood but the
[1:36:02] blood of bulls and goats did not divorce
[1:36:04] sin it only covered sin if God if you
[1:36:08] got a red spot on my hand and covered it
[1:36:11] with white the red spot is still there
[1:36:14] see it's still there but God sit down
[1:36:17] from heaven a bleach from for sin it was
[1:36:20] the blood of his own son that when I
[1:36:22] would confessed I will confess sin drops
[1:36:26] into God's bleach y'all come fast sins
[1:36:30] dropped
[1:36:33] into the blood God's bleach try to find
[1:36:37] it again the coloring of sin goes back
[1:36:40] to the mediator and down through the
[1:36:43] time until it hits the accuser Satan and
[1:36:47] lays on him to the day of judgment
[1:36:49] every sin confess
[1:36:53] ions
[1:36:55] Hallelujah
[1:36:57] is that right Jesus Paid the price for
[1:37:00] our sin
[1:37:02] and because he paid the price he had a
[1:37:04] right to say hey satan this is yours
[1:37:07] he gives it back to Satan
[1:37:09] amen what happens to the son he becomes
[1:37:12] he he he becomes imperfect fellowship
[1:37:15] with the father again
[1:37:17] standing on the other side of the chasm
[1:37:18] this is why it's so important to receive
[1:37:21] the Holy Ghost and if you need a Revival
[1:37:23] ask God for the Revival if you need a
[1:37:26] refilling ask God for the refueling but
[1:37:28] don't stop until your relationship
[1:37:32] has become so needed to God
[1:37:35] that you you'll be able to stand as
[1:37:38] Jesus did and say I and the father are
[1:37:40] one you say brother that's a blasphemy
[1:37:42] no it's not Jesus prayed father how
[1:37:46] would they be one even as We Are One
[1:37:50] he prayed that you think it's going to
[1:37:52] come back forward absolutely not there
[1:37:55] are those who God has chosen
[1:37:58] that will come into such a Unity with
[1:38:00] God they would talk like him they would
[1:38:03] walk like him there's Miracles that like
[1:38:05] him healings and delivers and raise the
[1:38:07] dead you name it that ain't for tomorrow
[1:38:10] that's for today
[1:38:12] Hallelujah
[1:38:17] Hallelujah
[1:38:19] just as the Clorox or the ink can never
[1:38:23] be seen ink no more because it broke up
[1:38:25] and sent back again
[1:38:27] and when confessed and sin is confessed
[1:38:31] and been dipped into a a man or woman
[1:38:34] that's been dipped into the blood of
[1:38:35] Jesus Christ it kills all symptoms
[1:38:38] every molecule of sin goes back to the
[1:38:41] devil and lay on him to the day of
[1:38:44] judgment
[1:38:45] where his eternal destination will throw
[1:38:48] into the Lake of Fire and the chasmus
[1:38:51] bridge and never to come in remembrance
[1:38:53] no more and a man stands Justified as a
[1:38:57] Son of God he says simplicity
[1:39:03] you'll never have nothing in heaven
[1:39:05] that's going to remind you of what you
[1:39:07] were when you on Earth
[1:39:08] there won't be a sign there says this is
[1:39:11] where Isaiah Brooks used to live
[1:39:13] nothing of the thought everything would
[1:39:17] be so perfect before God and guess what
[1:39:19] though we are fellas brothers and
[1:39:22] sisters you won't remember my faults
[1:39:24] either
[1:39:26] everything will be wiped away Hallelujah
[1:39:28] everybody will be called clearing holy
[1:39:31] holy holy
[1:39:35] Hallelujah
[1:39:39] let me let me um use this particular
[1:39:43] scripture in our clothes
[1:39:47] we'll we'll continue on this by God's
[1:39:49] grace on Sunday
[1:39:51] John 14 19 21.
[1:39:57] we we've got a real if you see the
[1:39:59] meaning of Calvary it'll make your life
[1:40:02] more meaningful
[1:40:04] and if you see what what he did for you
[1:40:08] and he's given you words
[1:40:11] like I said last week if somebody you
[1:40:14] give your wife a bouquet of flowers says
[1:40:16] here
[1:40:17] no words are being said
[1:40:20] first of all she's going to wonder what
[1:40:21] that's for
[1:40:23] but if you say here honey I love you I
[1:40:26] was thinking about you today and you
[1:40:28] know I thought about how beautiful these
[1:40:30] flowers are and your eyes beautiful to
[1:40:32] me as these flowers you know I mean you
[1:40:34] mush it up
[1:40:35] it's going to really make her feel good
[1:40:38] and she won't forget it
[1:40:40] right and sometimes like I heard a
[1:40:43] brother say if you if you was a farmer
[1:40:45] and you don't know nothing about
[1:40:47] women and you don't know nothing about
[1:40:48] how to talk to women and all you know is
[1:40:51] uh uh uh the language of cows
[1:40:55] but you can't call her Daisy
[1:40:58] she won't understand that yeah
[1:41:04] tweet is Daisy
[1:41:05] you got to be a little more romantic
[1:41:08] right so if you don't know any words to
[1:41:11] say what do you do you go find you a
[1:41:13] card
[1:41:14] that can express your feelings right God
[1:41:18] has ordained poets
[1:41:20] people who have a gift of poetry they
[1:41:24] can put it in such short terms that will
[1:41:27] say everything you know some cars people
[1:41:30] saying you don't throw away
[1:41:32] you keep them a long time
[1:41:34] right
[1:41:35] oh I'm sorry y'all don't do that but
[1:41:39] some cars you don't throw away
[1:41:44] you always go back
[1:41:46] you know it's always good to keep a few
[1:41:49] so you can go back and remember
[1:41:52] yeah I am yeah I think I'm talking junk
[1:41:55] I know what I'm talking about
[1:41:57] he said to get a little while and the
[1:41:59] world seeth me no more
[1:42:01] but ye see me because I live
[1:42:05] ye shall live also
[1:42:08] wait a minute wait a minute can I say
[1:42:11] that again because let me ask this let
[1:42:13] me ask what does this mean
[1:42:17] you see this
[1:42:19] he just for meaning
[1:42:20] otherwise the the word of God will be a
[1:42:24] history book to you
[1:42:25] or it'll be uh something for yesterday
[1:42:29] no no no no this word is the same
[1:42:32] yesterday today and forever
[1:42:35] so while he's saying this let me
[1:42:38] understand it he says yet a little while
[1:42:40] and the world seeth me no more but ye
[1:42:44] shall see me because I live ye shall
[1:42:48] live also
[1:42:51] so he's telling us that there is a
[1:42:54] season there is a time where the world
[1:42:58] can't see him they don't believe in
[1:43:01] miracles no more they don't believe in
[1:43:03] Jesus no more they they don't believe in
[1:43:05] the Bible being real they don't believe
[1:43:08] it but there are those who can see him
[1:43:11] they know that the Bible hasn't changed
[1:43:13] they understand that Jesus is not in
[1:43:15] heaven alone but he's inside of me they
[1:43:18] know that he walks and they talk and we
[1:43:21] have conversations with him he's real as
[1:43:24] real as this Destiny see we see him
[1:43:28] it's a blessed thing to see him because
[1:43:31] remember in his day everybody didn't see
[1:43:34] him there are people who saw the natural
[1:43:36] man called him a desert devil
[1:43:39] but then there were those who really saw
[1:43:41] him like the woman at the world come see
[1:43:44] the man who told me about it's not this
[1:43:47] the Messiah right there was a man a
[1:43:50] Roman soldier and all of the Romans and
[1:43:52] everybody didn't see him but he was a
[1:43:54] gentile who says my son and my daughter
[1:43:57] is sick all you got to do is speak the
[1:43:58] word you understand me he saw him that's
[1:44:02] how it is today everybody don't see him
[1:44:06] I don't care how religious you claim to
[1:44:08] be
[1:44:09] it doesn't guarantee you sight
[1:44:12] right the man was born blind 30 years
[1:44:16] and was part of the Pharisee Church
[1:44:19] never could see until Jesus came his way
[1:44:23] Hallelujah then we found out who had the
[1:44:26] who really was blind
[1:44:28] it wasn't the blind man that was blind
[1:44:31] the blind man was the one who could see
[1:44:33] but it was a religious people who were
[1:44:35] the blind
[1:44:37] so is it today
[1:44:38] [Music]
[1:44:42] they were so blind they didn't
[1:44:44] understand the scripture
[1:44:46] y'all hear me y'all hear me this blind
[1:44:49] man say say whatever you want to say
[1:44:52] is it not have you ever seen anybody
[1:44:54] evil do the miracles of god
[1:44:56] but he said like
[1:44:57] like paraphrasing that
[1:45:00] I want to say they got so mad at him
[1:45:03] he said one thing I could truly say to
[1:45:05] you is once I was blind but now I see
[1:45:09] huh whatever you want to say however you
[1:45:12] ever you won't say it call me Holy
[1:45:14] Roller whatever all I can tell you is I
[1:45:17] was once blind but now I can see
[1:45:21] Hallelujah
[1:45:23] and God did the same thing today he sent
[1:45:25] a little Kentuckian by the name of
[1:45:27] William Branham and he blinded the whole
[1:45:30] generation
[1:45:31] pretty much
[1:45:34] they couldn't see God in a man
[1:45:37] amen right
[1:45:38] they didn't see it
[1:45:42] but there are those who can see
[1:45:45] I mean they don't worship the man but
[1:45:46] they worship the god of the man who is
[1:45:49] Jesus Christ Paul said follow me as I
[1:45:51] follow Christ
[1:45:55] that's one thing I don't understand why
[1:45:58] people think that prophets are perfect
[1:46:00] read your Bible that should show you you
[1:46:02] don't read your Bible
[1:46:05] they're men just like everybody else
[1:46:09] and ain't nobody in here perfect it's
[1:46:10] God in you that's perfect
[1:46:13] and you and I must understand by the
[1:46:14] grace of God is God in you if the
[1:46:17] perfect God is in you you're perfect
[1:46:21] Hallelujah at that day you shall know
[1:46:24] that I am in the father and my father
[1:46:26] and you and me and I and you he that
[1:46:29] have my Commandments and keepeth them he
[1:46:32] it is that loveth me
[1:46:34] amen don't tell me you love God it won't
[1:46:37] keep his Commandments
[1:46:38] and he that loveth me shall be loved of
[1:46:41] my father and I will love him and will
[1:46:44] what manifest myself
[1:46:48] to him
[1:46:52] [Music]
[1:46:54] what more scripture we'll let you go
[1:46:56] Acts 17.
[1:47:07] this is where we'll probably pick up on
[1:47:09] Sunday
[1:47:12] acts 17 28-30
[1:47:15] for in him we live
[1:47:19] and move
[1:47:21] and have our being
[1:47:23] as certain also of your own prophets
[1:47:26] have said
[1:47:27] we are also his offspring
[1:47:31] for as much then as we are The Offspring
[1:47:34] of God
[1:47:35] we ought not to think that God that the
[1:47:38] godhead is like unto gold or silver or
[1:47:41] stone gravened by arts and man's device
[1:47:46] we you know rebuking them now
[1:47:48] because you know in those in that age
[1:47:50] people had all kinds of statues and
[1:47:54] stuff
[1:47:55] and he was the Living God Jesus Christ
[1:47:58] walking among them and they they
[1:48:00] couldn't see that the true image of God
[1:48:02] is in the image of a man God in man man
[1:48:06] and God is that right
[1:48:09] he said well God ain't no man yes he is
[1:48:11] he is a man
[1:48:13] when when Moses says Lord I want to see
[1:48:15] you
[1:48:17] all he saw was the back of a man he
[1:48:19] didn't see a pillow fire he saw a man
[1:48:23] and when God revealed himself Amen to
[1:48:26] Abraham he was a man call him
[1:48:28] Melchizedek right
[1:48:32] and if he was we are in the image of God
[1:48:34] we he was it was the man image wasn't a
[1:48:37] monkey or nothing like that
[1:48:40] and the time of this ignorance God
[1:48:43] winked at
[1:48:44] but now commanding all men everywhere
[1:48:48] to repent
[1:48:50] let me tell you something in closing
[1:48:53] you're not careful
[1:48:55] you'll be a worshiper of yourself
[1:48:59] many people worship themselves
[1:49:02] and anytime you get to a place that your
[1:49:05] will is greater than God
[1:49:07] you're worshiping yourself
[1:49:13] that's why Jesus said Lord father not my
[1:49:16] will
