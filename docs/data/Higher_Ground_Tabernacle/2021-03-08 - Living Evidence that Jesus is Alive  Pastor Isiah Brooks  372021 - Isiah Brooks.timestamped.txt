[36:57] grace and his mercy
[36:59] excuse me

[40:26] [Music]
[40:40] can he do
[40:52] [Music]
[41:14] praise the lord for his goodness
[41:16] revelations please
[41:18] it's pretty warm in here is that me
[41:22] okay this morning i was cold and today
[41:26] i'm hot
[41:27] that's all right i'm living
[41:31] we thank you brothers for everything
[41:34] we're going to go right on into
[41:35] revelations 10.
[41:36] we're going to finish up the service uh
[41:39] this thought on
[41:42] the evidence that really stirs me i
[41:45] the more i think about it
[41:48] you know the more i it becomes a reality
[41:51] in my life it makes me want to live
[41:53] better
[41:54] it makes me want to watch things and
[41:56] watch my ways and
[41:58] i can't explain it to you but i just
[42:00] know that it just makes me want to be a
[42:02] better christian
[42:03] i know what the lord has done for me i
[42:05] do i realize that
[42:07] you know we really won't fully
[42:08] understand until we get on the other
[42:10] side
[42:11] but just to know that all that he has
[42:13] done you know i think about his
[42:14] crucifixion just that
[42:16] in itself and none of us have suffered
[42:18] the way he suffered
[42:20] so we should never complain though we do
[42:24] think about it and god is merciful to us
[42:27] even while we're complaining because he
[42:30] realized we're just mere worms
[42:33] in this flesh there's no glory in it
[42:36] your body your flesh always bring you to
[42:38] a disgrace
[42:40] right it embarrasses you right it does
[42:43] mine
[42:44] mine embarrasses me sometimes my mouth
[42:46] goes
[42:47] like what
[42:50] i'm even shocked at the things that i've
[42:52] seen here and
[42:53] it's just the way it is but god is still
[42:56] merciful
[42:57] i'm so glad we're not living under the
[42:59] law i'm thanking god for
[43:00] his amazing grace revelations 10 please
[43:05] we're not going to keep you long i know
[43:06] every time i say that i usually go a
[43:08] little longer but
[43:09] we're going to keep it short because
[43:10] we've got communion service tonight
[43:17] i learned something the other day and i
[43:18] believe it's true
[43:20] i was looking uh at this thing and
[43:23] i wasn't aware that uh
[43:27] jesus came into jerusalem
[43:30] on april 6 around that time or somewhere
[43:34] in that time but i
[43:35] think if i got got it correct he died
[43:38] april 7th
[43:40] and um i'm just i was just thinking
[43:42] brother brandon was
[43:43] born on april 6 and he
[43:46] as a as a memorial he was born on a day
[43:49] that jesus was born and it just struck
[43:53] me
[43:54] that god my lord died in the same month
[43:59] that he was born in and i'm thinking oh
[44:03] my goodness so
[44:04] if he was born in that month now y'all
[44:06] might think i'm producing a new doctrine
[44:08] he died in that month and in that month
[44:11] was the resurrection
[44:14] y'all hear what i'm saying and brother
[44:16] adam always liking the resurrection
[44:19] to the time of easter because he said
[44:21] that is the time
[44:22] things come back to life oh people it
[44:25] could be
[44:26] closer than we think i know a lot of
[44:29] people think it's all crazy and insanity
[44:32] but it wouldn't bother me none as long
[44:35] as i'm in it
[44:37] revelations 10 beginning at the first
[44:39] verse
[44:41] and i saw another mighty angel come down
[44:43] from heaven clothed with the cloud
[44:46] and with a rainbow was upon his head and
[44:49] his face was as it were the sun
[44:51] and his feet was as pillars of fire
[44:55] and he had in his hand a little book
[44:57] upon opened
[44:59] and he set his right foot
[45:02] upon the sea and his left foot on the
[45:05] earth
[45:06] and cried with a loud voice as when a
[45:08] lion roared
[45:10] and when he had cried seven thunders
[45:12] uttered their voices
[45:13] and when the seven thunders had uttered
[45:15] their voices i was about to write
[45:18] and i heard a voice from the heavens
[45:20] saying unto me
[45:22] seal up those things which the seven
[45:24] thunders uttered
[45:25] and write them not and the angel which i
[45:28] saw stand
[45:30] upon the sea and upon the earth lifted
[45:32] up his hand
[45:33] to heaven and swear by him that liveth
[45:35] forever and ever
[45:37] who created heaven and the things that
[45:39] therein are
[45:40] and the earth and the things that
[45:42] therein are
[45:43] and the sea and the things which are
[45:46] therein
[45:47] that there should be time no longer but
[45:50] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[45:52] angel when he shall begin to sound
[45:54] the mystery of god should be finished as
[45:56] he had declared to his servants
[45:58] the prophet let us pray father we thank
[46:01] you for your grace we thank you for your
[46:02] mercy
[46:03] we thank you for everything that you
[46:05] have done for us and everything that
[46:07] you're doing for us
[46:09] father we just pray that you continue to
[46:10] open our hearts and our understanding to
[46:12] your word
[46:14] lord we don't want to be just a hearer
[46:15] but make us also a doer
[46:18] and father we'll be careful to give you
[46:19] the praise glory and honor in jesus
[46:21] christ's name we pray
[46:22] amen you may be seated
[46:26] i don't really think that people are
[46:28] going to understand
[46:29] what lays lies before us
[46:34] when we talk about heaven when we talk
[46:37] about
[46:38] a place where there is no sin where
[46:40] there is no
[46:42] storms of life where there is no
[46:45] uh confusion you know no animals are
[46:48] there to hurt you and
[46:50] there is no snake to bite you when we
[46:53] think about a place where
[46:55] it's just blissfulness we can't seem to
[46:58] comprehend it well i can't
[47:00] because every since i've had knowledge
[47:03] to know
[47:03] right and wrong i've had seen i've seen
[47:06] a lot of wrong
[47:08] i've experienced a lot of hurt i've seen
[47:11] a lot of rainy days and i've seen a lot
[47:12] of cloudy days
[47:14] and god knows how i enjoy sunny days
[47:17] but here in the morning you don't get
[47:19] but a certain percentage of those days
[47:21] but
[47:21] when they do come it makes me appreciate
[47:25] the real sunny days and think about how
[47:28] that when we get over yonder
[47:30] there'll never be a cloudy day were you
[47:33] mr cloud
[47:34] no not this guy
[47:38] but you know you you look and you know
[47:40] we we we forget
[47:42] that all of our efforts is worth it
[47:45] all of the suffering everything that we
[47:47] go through is worth it
[47:50] james described this life as a vapor
[47:54] you know it's here and it's gone and i
[47:56] can remember when i was a little kid
[47:58] and it seems like yesterday you know
[48:01] uh and it's amazing how time rolls by
[48:05] fast i look
[48:06] at these teenagers and these young
[48:07] people and how they so enjoy your youth
[48:09] you better
[48:11] it's not coming around a second time
[48:13] until you translate it
[48:16] so you got to understand you know things
[48:18] like this do happen and they're coming
[48:20] this is part of this perverted life
[48:22] and all of these things have occurred
[48:24] because of one thing
[48:26] disbelieving god's word
[48:30] we call it sin i want you to take note
[48:33] once at something
[48:37] we've always talked about job and i get
[48:40] into my message in just a moment i'm
[48:41] just being inspired to say these things
[48:44] we're getting we talk about job and the
[48:46] thing that we always talk about job
[48:48] is job's troubles but let's go before
[48:52] the troubles
[48:54] look at the kind of life this man lived
[48:57] where the whole city honored and respect
[49:00] him
[49:02] they knew he was a godly man and
[49:05] whatever he touched
[49:06] it flourished everything he did
[49:09] god amen blessed it
[49:14] and the reason why is because this man
[49:16] was a faithful
[49:17] servant of the lord god has no respect a
[49:20] person
[49:22] and if we could just find the
[49:24] faithfulness of job
[49:26] you and i would find out that god would
[49:28] give such an increase
[49:30] everything would overflow right
[49:34] and i think sometimes we we think that
[49:36] we can prosper ourselves and
[49:38] anytime we feel that way we're going to
[49:40] find out that
[49:41] that way is not the right way god
[49:44] is the one that causes the increase he's
[49:47] the one that prospers
[49:49] everything is that right you take for
[49:52] example
[49:52] even jacob as though he though he was a
[49:54] scheister he was still
[49:55] the elected of god and he had a promise
[49:58] he had a covenant from god
[50:00] and even before before he was ever
[50:02] converted he was a christian now
[50:04] but before he was converted god blessed
[50:07] him
[50:08] you understand me and i'm going to tell
[50:10] you this even before i was converted god
[50:12] blessed me
[50:13] and you know what i knew it was god
[50:17] and and and jacob knew it was god too
[50:20] now that god gave him the understanding
[50:22] of reproduction and how to do it with
[50:24] the sheep and
[50:25] the goats and whatever the case may be
[50:27] god prospered here
[50:29] even in his erroring ways
[50:35] now when god comes along and he did
[50:37] bless joseph
[50:38] i mean excuse me jacob and jacob wrestle
[50:40] with the angel now he's got a new name
[50:42] israel and how can god not bless him
[50:44] don't you understand
[50:46] god is still blessing israel huh
[50:49] he's still blessing him we wouldn't have
[50:51] computers like we have we wouldn't have
[50:53] these little
[50:54] texts all these things that we have you
[50:56] know these people
[50:59] and i don't know whether they could ever
[51:01] get within themselves as if
[51:03] it's their ability but they only have
[51:06] that blessing
[51:07] because of the blessing that was given
[51:08] to abraham
[51:11] now if they have blessings because of
[51:13] the blessings of abraham
[51:14] what about us hello
[51:18] don't tell me god don't bless in times
[51:20] of trouble
[51:21] i could take you down to the story of
[51:22] moses
[51:24] and we could find that the children of
[51:25] israel was in goshen
[51:27] and while egypt was plagued with plagues
[51:30] they were having a good time y'all
[51:32] understand me
[51:34] no evil came not their dwelling place
[51:38] now i'm saying all of these things
[51:40] because
[51:42] i want to encourage us for those of us
[51:44] who've not
[51:45] pressed into the holies of holies
[51:48] we need to make that our main objective
[51:52] we need to refocus you want to see the
[51:54] power of god
[51:55] in this place you want to see the the
[51:58] anointing of god and the visitation of
[52:00] angels in this place
[52:01] then we've got to press on hallelujah
[52:05] because i believe i i don't have to
[52:07] believe it he spoke it to me
[52:09] if we're going to see this we've got to
[52:11] keep on pressing
[52:12] until we get to that final place that's
[52:15] behind the veil
[52:17] now you can't fool yourself that you're
[52:19] there
[52:20] because behind the veil there's no rain
[52:23] there
[52:24] there's no cloudy days there's no
[52:26] confusion
[52:27] there's no evil everything behind the
[52:30] veil
[52:31] is heaven you see so
[52:34] this is what we're pressing into now
[52:36] this is not something man can do
[52:39] but i know one thing he said we have not
[52:41] because we ask not
[52:44] and that's where the devil is confusing
[52:45] people well i thought
[52:47] yeah you got the holy ghost but you got
[52:49] to mature you got to grow up into christ
[52:53] that's the way brother abraham said we
[52:54] must grow up into christ and that's what
[52:56] paul said
[52:56] we must grow up into christ we know that
[53:00] is the full statue of christ
[53:02] right the perfect statue of christ that
[53:04] we find in peter
[53:06] now we realize like i said we need we
[53:10] are the people who god has chosen
[53:12] to make the invisible god visible
[53:16] no man had seen god at any time until
[53:19] jesus came along
[53:21] and he told philip when you see me you
[53:23] see the father
[53:24] well he wasn't talking basically about
[53:26] his house but
[53:28] in in in in some ways he was trying to
[53:31] show him
[53:32] the god that's behind me has become
[53:34] visible
[53:35] through me i am the very evidence
[53:39] that this god lives right
[53:43] now we realize how we read that quote
[53:45] just at the end of service
[53:47] how that all that was poured he all that
[53:50] was
[53:50] that god us he poured into his cry into
[53:53] christ
[53:54] and all christ all christ was poured
[53:56] into the church
[53:57] and the holy ghost now the enemy the
[53:59] enemy's got something
[54:01] so you got to understand that when you
[54:02] get the holy ghost when god comes into
[54:04] you like that
[54:05] now the enemy got something to work with
[54:08] until then he plays
[54:10] with you
[54:13] he plays with you and i don't know
[54:15] whether you ever heard the story about
[54:17] the mouse
[54:17] and the cat and how the mouse amen was
[54:21] always chasing the cat until one day he
[54:23] was up on the table and he
[54:25] tripped and he fell into some wine
[54:28] and once he got out of that that glass
[54:31] of wine
[54:32] he said where is that cat what was it
[54:36] he was stimulated something changed him
[54:39] he was no longer afraid of the cat
[54:43] and that's how it is with a true
[54:45] believer when that holy ghost comes you
[54:47] say that's not true yes it was
[54:49] though peter looked like he was a heroic
[54:51] man in the end
[54:53] we found out that peter was really the
[54:55] main coward
[54:56] of all the 12. hallelujah
[54:59] but once the holy ghost came upon him
[55:02] peter stood up on the day of pentecost
[55:04] and declared this is that see it's
[55:07] something how the holy ghost
[55:09] transform us this is what we want we
[55:12] don't want
[55:12] religion brothers i'm going to try my
[55:15] best to hurry because i know you're
[55:16] sacrificing i know you're tired but just
[55:18] give me a few minutes
[55:20] and you know i'm saying that to help you
[55:22] wake up so anyway
[55:23] we know how the enemy tried to fan you
[55:25] fannie fan i've been there done that i'm
[55:27] not picking
[55:28] all i'm saying is that you know we the
[55:31] enemy is
[55:32] he's always working at us he's always
[55:34] trying to stop our ears to what's being
[55:36] said
[55:37] so we realize by the grace of god amen
[55:39] that if that be the truth
[55:41] this logos this logos that we we know
[55:45] was jesus christ right he was god
[55:49] in word form coming out of god
[55:54] veiled god has always been veiled matter
[55:56] of fact lucifer
[55:57] used to be a veil he was a covering
[56:01] cherub
[56:03] did you know that if anybody knows
[56:06] or have any idea of what god likes he
[56:09] knows
[56:11] he knows god's worship that's why he can
[56:13] pervert it that's why he can pervert
[56:15] everything
[56:16] because he knows what god likes and he
[56:19] goes just contrary
[56:21] to god you see what i'm saying so we
[56:24] know he knows but look at lucifer
[56:27] he's a jealous god he's more jealous
[56:31] than god
[56:31] is and his jealousy is evil
[56:35] you understand me and lucifer will take
[56:38] the things of god pervert them
[56:40] and make people worship him in a way
[56:43] that god
[56:44] chooses to be worshipped and you say
[56:47] explain that to me
[56:48] because when it comes to the world
[56:51] though they worship in a perverted way
[56:54] they give their whole being
[56:57] that's all god asking for that we give
[57:00] our whole being to him our body our soul
[57:04] and our spirit now
[57:08] we look at this and we say well
[57:11] if we are the word in which we are
[57:16] we are the word of god made manifest
[57:18] today
[57:19] everything you see is the word of god
[57:21] made manifest
[57:23] god created everything by his word and
[57:26] the bible tells us that the most
[57:28] important things of god's creation are
[57:32] the things that you cannot see
[57:35] and yet we put so much value on the
[57:37] things that we can see
[57:39] hallelujah none of us like growing old
[57:42] but who care if you grow old and you've
[57:45] got god on the inside
[57:47] because that's eternal that can never
[57:50] grow old now we said this morning
[57:54] amen the essence of the godhead is the
[57:56] essence
[57:57] of the essential being of god
[58:00] it is the supreme being
[58:04] right and if that be the case but the
[58:07] man who described it like this
[58:09] he calls it a chinese um laundry ticket
[58:13] and and when you put your laundry in
[58:16] he the actually
[58:19] tears the ticket in part and give you a
[58:22] part of it
[58:23] and your ticket is the only piece of
[58:25] ticket that's going to match this ticket
[58:28] his part and that's the only way you're
[58:30] going to get your laundry
[58:32] can i say it like this it's the only way
[58:34] you're going to get the inheritance
[58:36] of god is that your part that you
[58:39] possess matches his part in which he
[58:43] possesses
[58:44] it makes one and one makes
[58:47] two but that two makes a whole is that
[58:50] correct so this is what god is looking
[58:52] at see
[58:52] we're not denominational we're not some
[58:55] religious
[58:56] group of people that's gone off the end
[58:58] but we have a vision
[59:00] and the bible said without the vision to
[59:01] be prepared because you don't know where
[59:03] you're headed
[59:04] we are a new creation holy is that the
[59:08] bible
[59:08] the bible says we are a new creation and
[59:10] this new creation
[59:12] no man on earth has seen since
[59:16] jesus
[59:18] y'all hear what i'm saying you say well
[59:20] what do you mean
[59:21] i'm gonna tell you what jesus
[59:24] never sinned amen
[59:28] you'll never see him amen in a place
[59:30] amen where people could gossip
[59:32] about him and it be true
[59:35] everything every piece of gossip came by
[59:38] way of lies and falsehood
[59:41] y'all hear what i'm saying so i'm saying
[59:43] to you by the grace of god
[59:45] when brother branham described it this
[59:47] part that you and i have
[59:49] he called it omnipotent
[59:53] amen you understand me now how in the
[59:56] world we can have
[59:58] omnipotent and fear everything
[1:00:04] you know i'm not just talking to you i'm
[1:00:05] talking to those who listen to the
[1:00:07] youtube
[1:00:08] because fear is a is a spirit of torment
[1:00:12] and the bible said that perfect love
[1:00:15] casts out fear amen and the problem with
[1:00:19] fear is
[1:00:20] most of the time we fear when we feel
[1:00:23] like we have lost control of a situation
[1:00:27] and the truth of the matter is if you
[1:00:30] had left home
[1:00:31] the way you're supposed to leave home
[1:00:34] acknowledge the lord in all your ways
[1:00:36] the bible said he will direct your path
[1:00:39] and therefore fear would have no place
[1:00:41] for you
[1:00:43] because you have given unto the lord
[1:00:46] your whole day
[1:00:48] and the bible said the footsteps of a
[1:00:50] righteous man are ordered by the lord
[1:00:52] brother said what happens when two
[1:00:54] omnipotents meet we've read this before
[1:00:57] when god and man comes together two
[1:00:59] omnipotents
[1:01:00] something's got to shake whatever you
[1:01:04] say
[1:01:04] with the creator this is what i love
[1:01:06] hallelujah
[1:01:08] whatever you say with that creative
[1:01:11] power of omnipotence of god
[1:01:14] knowing that he he's promised it and he
[1:01:17] said
[1:01:17] it in his word it creates a power
[1:01:20] that goes out yonder and brings
[1:01:24] things to pass things that is not
[1:01:28] it makes them as though they
[1:01:31] are because two omnipotents have met
[1:01:35] god ain't talking about your fleshly man
[1:01:38] he's talking about the inner man
[1:01:40] that man that had been changed that man
[1:01:42] had been born again
[1:01:44] hallelujah you know you see people
[1:01:46] trying to
[1:01:47] operate the gifts or operate god in them
[1:01:50] you can't operate god
[1:01:52] intimate god in you if god ain't in you
[1:01:55] you see you can you could hold uh a gay
[1:01:57] i say i i got gasoline and you got the
[1:02:00] the container of gasoline in your in
[1:02:02] your hand and it ain't in your car
[1:02:03] you can get in your cr that car you want
[1:02:06] to it ain't going nowhere
[1:02:08] until you put the gasoline in the car
[1:02:10] you got it
[1:02:12] but you got to put it in the right place
[1:02:14] put it in the tank
[1:02:17] put it in the heart amen and when it's
[1:02:19] in the tank
[1:02:20] two it's gonna fire up hallelujah
[1:02:24] right amen says we're on our road where
[1:02:28] to the promised land
[1:02:29] journeying with what the evidence
[1:02:32] our joshua has come back glory and we
[1:02:35] have the evidence
[1:02:37] for once we were in sin and trespasses
[1:02:40] but we died to the things of the world
[1:02:42] and we are buried with him and raised
[1:02:45] him with him
[1:02:46] in his resurrection y'all understand
[1:02:49] that
[1:02:50] and what happened when he raised in
[1:02:51] resurrection he said all power
[1:02:54] in heaven and earth is given unto me
[1:02:57] now maybe i'm seeing it wrong because
[1:03:00] the power of god said all that was in
[1:03:01] god he poured it in christ and all that
[1:03:02] was in christ he pulled it into his
[1:03:04] church
[1:03:04] so therefore if he he rose with all
[1:03:06] power i did too
[1:03:08] that's where the scripture comes in all
[1:03:10] things are possible to them that believe
[1:03:13] all things not some all uh-oh a-l-l
[1:03:16] things are possible to them that believe
[1:03:19] now i don't know about your faith but
[1:03:21] mine is increasing
[1:03:24] i see changes happening in my life and
[1:03:26] i'm happy about it because i know i'm
[1:03:28] not doing it
[1:03:29] he is one of the things i
[1:03:32] made meant to mention this morning i
[1:03:34] failed to do it
[1:03:36] brother branham in the message the
[1:03:39] supernatural
[1:03:40] he doesn't say it directly but if you if
[1:03:42] you got ears to hear
[1:03:44] he said in paraphrasing
[1:03:47] if you don't have a prayer life you are
[1:03:51] denying the power thereof
[1:03:53] you're living a godly life but denying
[1:03:57] the
[1:03:58] power the power of god you know how the
[1:04:00] scriptures go
[1:04:01] amen they they they and i thought oh my
[1:04:05] god
[1:04:05] i've never seen it that way because
[1:04:08] that's where the power lay
[1:04:10] lie it's in in prayer
[1:04:14] that's where it is that's why the devil
[1:04:16] don't mind you looking like
[1:04:18] living right but if you're not gonna
[1:04:19] take the power
[1:04:22] a prayer to live that day through
[1:04:25] hallelujah you just got a image of a
[1:04:28] godly life
[1:04:32] you're like a car without gasoline
[1:04:37] oh that message is so powerful i want
[1:04:40] you to all go listen to it and then
[1:04:41] come and share your thoughts with me so
[1:04:44] i can say hallelujah anyhow
[1:04:47] it's really good i'm telling you it's
[1:04:49] really really really good it's one of
[1:04:51] those kind brother keith that you just
[1:04:53] chew on and you
[1:04:54] know how we do sometimes you get with
[1:04:55] messages take off oh a week and
[1:04:57] something just to get through it
[1:04:58] i mean you go over and over and every
[1:05:00] time you go over it you get something
[1:05:02] good out of it
[1:05:03] to me it was so it was speaking directly
[1:05:07] to me
[1:05:09] and i know that it'll speak to you for
[1:05:12] once we were in sin and trespasses but
[1:05:14] we died to the things of the world
[1:05:15] and we are buried in him and raised with
[1:05:18] him in
[1:05:19] his resurrection and now we are up above
[1:05:22] the things
[1:05:23] passing from death unto life we're
[1:05:25] living in it
[1:05:26] the evidence y'all understand me that
[1:05:29] holy ghost
[1:05:31] is not only just a witness but it's the
[1:05:33] evidence
[1:05:34] and it's this evidence you you don't
[1:05:37] have to look
[1:05:38] far look hard to find it it's not
[1:05:41] looking like uh easter egg hunt or
[1:05:42] needle in the haystack
[1:05:44] amen the bible says that you're a city
[1:05:46] that sits on the hill
[1:05:48] that cannot be heard that's the evidence
[1:05:52] when somebody can swear at you and you
[1:05:54] can still smile and say bless you
[1:05:59] right when god
[1:06:02] you know the thing is we haven't had any
[1:06:04] physical abuse yet
[1:06:08] we haven't had anyone to slap us in the
[1:06:10] face yet
[1:06:11] you heard i said i say yeah we don't
[1:06:14] know what's coming
[1:06:16] but what will be your response to that
[1:06:19] y'all hear me we need more god and i
[1:06:22] think we just really need more prayer
[1:06:24] to keep the fire going oh yes
[1:06:30] hallelujah you know i
[1:06:34] you know don't forget to pray for me
[1:06:37] you know because you know you can you
[1:06:39] know when you have discernment it could
[1:06:41] be good and can be bad
[1:06:42] and when i say that every every
[1:06:44] christian has discernment
[1:06:46] and sometimes i don't know how yours
[1:06:48] kick in but sometimes i hear words i
[1:06:50] hear people talking
[1:06:52] and that's the kind that gets me
[1:06:54] sometimes because i can hear
[1:06:56] and i can't explain it people of god it
[1:06:58] turns on every now and again
[1:07:00] but you know it's so amazing you hear
[1:07:02] these things and you're looking right at
[1:07:03] them like
[1:07:04] but i can hear you and and the thing
[1:07:07] about it is never positive
[1:07:10] you know and you know sometimes the
[1:07:12] devil turns it on so you can hear what
[1:07:14] they say
[1:07:15] so they can he can see the response but
[1:07:18] it's okay
[1:07:19] and i say the devil but you know jesus
[1:07:20] heard negative thoughts too
[1:07:22] when they were calling him bears above
[1:07:24] and when they were saying negative
[1:07:25] things about him
[1:07:26] he heard it right and he kept moving on
[1:07:31] he didn't just get all
[1:07:32] mad and say how dare you say that about
[1:07:34] me or think that
[1:07:35] see you and i must understand those
[1:07:37] things will happen
[1:07:38] and sometimes the devil said well that's
[1:07:40] you no it ain't
[1:07:43] that thought came from somewhere
[1:07:47] well i'm living above that and already
[1:07:49] raised up from that
[1:07:51] don't taste the fir don't taste the
[1:07:52] first fruit of his resurrection
[1:07:54] that's it now i say this because
[1:07:58] what if some don't believe and that's
[1:08:00] the thing because everybody followed the
[1:08:02] message don't believe they believe the
[1:08:04] message
[1:08:06] that's true they followed moses and
[1:08:09] everybody
[1:08:10] didn't believe moses they heard his
[1:08:12] preaching
[1:08:13] but everybody didn't believe his
[1:08:14] preaching in fact they turned away from
[1:08:17] his preaching and followed somebody else
[1:08:19] who they thought was deeper
[1:08:22] hallelujah and what happened it got them
[1:08:25] deeper
[1:08:30] the earth swallowed them up yep
[1:08:33] now now people of god i know i'm taking
[1:08:36] my time but i'm trying to hurry at the
[1:08:37] same
[1:08:38] time because we must realize amen how
[1:08:41] many of us believe that no weapon formed
[1:08:43] against us shall prosper
[1:08:45] we must believe that
[1:08:50] i think it was uh was i think it was
[1:08:53] brother isaac i wish i would he was here
[1:08:55] to confirm what i want to say
[1:08:57] because there was a time when he was in
[1:08:59] class
[1:09:00] and the class that he wanted they
[1:09:02] weren't offering it to him
[1:09:06] and somehow through prayer and believing
[1:09:11] god switched it around and made it
[1:09:14] happen
[1:09:16] you know he's so he's so he you too amen
[1:09:19] yeah yeah yeah
[1:09:20] that's that was you too amen so uh and
[1:09:22] there's two accounts i think yeah you
[1:09:24] two brother brother samuel i wouldn't
[1:09:26] yes i forgot about that and um
[1:09:29] my point is is that whenever god has
[1:09:33] a situation already planned for you
[1:09:37] and something gets in the middle or
[1:09:39] begin to obstruct it
[1:09:41] you don't throw your hands up
[1:09:44] you don't do that that's one of the
[1:09:47] things he tried to teach moses
[1:09:49] i told you to go this way that's the way
[1:09:51] i intended for you to go
[1:09:53] i don't care what kind of instru
[1:09:55] obstruction you have
[1:09:56] i told you to go it ain't up to you to
[1:09:59] figure out how i'm going to do it
[1:10:02] and when god put the pressure on him
[1:10:05] said moses you got the power it's right
[1:10:07] in your hand
[1:10:09] you got it people it's right in your
[1:10:12] hand
[1:10:13] more more than that it's in your heart
[1:10:16] hallelujah and when you backed up
[1:10:18] against the red sea all you need to do
[1:10:20] is learn
[1:10:21] yo these these things that pentecostal
[1:10:24] people can't do
[1:10:25] speak it
[1:10:30] the devil ain't a creator and the only
[1:10:32] way
[1:10:33] you can speak it is that the creator is
[1:10:35] in the inside
[1:10:36] and if the inside of you has a creator
[1:10:39] and you speak his word
[1:10:40] it has to come to pass why because two
[1:10:43] omnipotents have met
[1:10:46] two omnipotents is that right when god
[1:10:49] when the lord has
[1:10:50] said that he is his will for you to
[1:10:53] prosper
[1:10:54] how are you gonna let the devil cheat
[1:10:55] you out of prospering
[1:10:58] where is hard times has nothing to do
[1:11:01] with you
[1:11:02] in the covenant that god has given you
[1:11:04] because your covenant is unconditional
[1:11:09] i can't even tell you how many times
[1:11:13] you know i needed money this is just a
[1:11:16] real small thing but
[1:11:17] needed money for something
[1:11:21] and when i made up in my mind i'm not
[1:11:23] going to worry about it ever since
[1:11:26] then god has been pouring out a blessing
[1:11:31] you know can i say it like this lord
[1:11:32] without being wrong
[1:11:34] he would even throw me in a bundle and
[1:11:36] then give me a tip too
[1:11:40] always giving me more than enough for
[1:11:43] the moment
[1:11:44] for the time that's what he does
[1:11:47] hallelujah
[1:11:48] and i'm talking to these college people
[1:11:50] when you come to a place where you're
[1:11:51] running short you ain't running short
[1:11:53] god want a testimony
[1:11:54] [Laughter]
[1:11:56] he's going to open doors for you don't
[1:11:58] ever doubt him
[1:12:00] he's got you there he's going to take
[1:12:01] you through
[1:12:03] relieve that believe that and you'll see
[1:12:06] it come to pass i promise you you'll see
[1:12:09] god will make a drunkard give you a
[1:12:10] thousand dollars
[1:12:14] huh don't ever doubt him because he's
[1:12:18] jehovah jireh
[1:12:20] that's what the israel people say lord
[1:12:22] i'm hungry we we're hungry
[1:12:23] well i don't okay i'm gonna bring you
[1:12:25] some manna right
[1:12:26] then they weren't satisfied oh lord we
[1:12:29] need meat i'm giving you meat
[1:12:32] those rebellious people and god still
[1:12:35] was a father to them
[1:12:39] they asked and god gave it to them y'all
[1:12:42] understand what i'm trying to say
[1:12:44] you are true true living epistles of the
[1:12:46] lord
[1:12:47] i believe every one of us are true
[1:12:49] epistles of god
[1:12:50] whether you believe it or not i believe
[1:12:52] it there is no way you come to church to
[1:12:54] hear this kind of preaching
[1:12:57] and there is no life in you the devil is
[1:12:59] a liar
[1:13:02] you're going to make this rapture you
[1:13:05] just got to believe it
[1:13:06] never let the devil make you think
[1:13:08] because of your goodness your way
[1:13:10] oh lord i just ain't you know i'm not
[1:13:13] worthy
[1:13:13] tell me when you worthy and then i'll
[1:13:15] like learn how you did it so i can
[1:13:17] become worthy
[1:13:18] none of us are worthy that is the bible
[1:13:21] hallelujah
[1:13:22] none was worthy not one paul
[1:13:26] no jonah no
[1:13:29] moses no none of them only one
[1:13:33] was worthy and that's jesus christ
[1:13:37] so don't let a religious spirit get on
[1:13:39] you and condemn you
[1:13:41] god has taken that guilt consciousness
[1:13:43] away from you should have by now
[1:13:49] listen putting on the whole arm of god
[1:13:51] he
[1:13:52] had the whole armor of god on not so
[1:13:55] much as the high priest dressed
[1:13:57] but he had something inside of him
[1:14:00] that's what got
[1:14:01] me cause all my life almost for some
[1:14:05] reason
[1:14:06] this armor i envision on the outside and
[1:14:09] not the inside
[1:14:10] the armor is inside hallelujah
[1:14:14] the arm of god comes inside the spirit
[1:14:18] spiritual hidden power of god that the
[1:14:22] intellectual eye doesn't see
[1:14:25] at all and what is it the character and
[1:14:28] the virtues of god
[1:14:31] amen you're going to let her talk to you
[1:14:33] like that yes i
[1:14:34] am because you know what
[1:14:38] i'm in the holies of holies i'm shut out
[1:14:41] to that nonsense
[1:14:43] brother are you gonna let him talk y'all
[1:14:45] know y'all don't know what i'm talking
[1:14:46] about
[1:14:46] but let me tell you something whenever
[1:14:49] you try to move
[1:14:50] forward with god satan is gonna bring
[1:14:54] some loved one
[1:14:58] there or your boss man or your teacher
[1:15:00] he's going to bring
[1:15:01] somebody to try to trip you
[1:15:05] y'all hear what i'm saying to make you
[1:15:07] fall backwards instead of going forward
[1:15:09] but understand every time you make a
[1:15:11] commitment to god
[1:15:12] i'm going to do better i'm going forward
[1:15:14] i'm oppressed into the holies of holies
[1:15:17] the devil said let try you try you try
[1:15:21] yeah he done brought you out of egypt
[1:15:22] but you ain't getting into that promised
[1:15:24] land
[1:15:25] hallelujah and you got to tell them no
[1:15:28] son you got to tell them listen
[1:15:29] the one that brought me out of egypt is
[1:15:31] the same one that brought me through the
[1:15:33] wilderness he brings me through the
[1:15:34] wilderness and i'm crossing over into
[1:15:36] canaan and not only that
[1:15:38] i am going to get my mountain
[1:15:41] yay and when i get my mountain you'll
[1:15:43] know because i'll be there
[1:15:46] looking down right so what houses you
[1:15:50] gonna build me
[1:15:51] that's what he asked heaven is my throne
[1:15:54] and the earth is my footstool
[1:15:56] where is the house that ye build under
[1:15:58] me and where is the place of my rest
[1:16:01] you know what i love the scripture
[1:16:02] because i think it was david who said
[1:16:05] lord
[1:16:06] how can we offer anything to you
[1:16:08] everything we've ever offered unto you
[1:16:10] is yours
[1:16:11] everything we offer is what you gave us
[1:16:13] to offer
[1:16:15] y'all understand me you got nothing to
[1:16:17] offer god
[1:16:18] everything you have came from god
[1:16:22] and this is the thing that gets me when
[1:16:23] i realize that god is everywhere
[1:16:27] y'all hear me god is here you know you
[1:16:29] can't you may not be able to see him but
[1:16:31] god is here
[1:16:32] when you get in your car god is there
[1:16:34] when you're by yourself god is there
[1:16:37] when you're in your thoughts he's there
[1:16:40] you can't get rid of him he's there
[1:16:44] you know and even now scientists cannot
[1:16:46] understand the complexity of our bodies
[1:16:50] they look at it and just show you how
[1:16:53] dumb scientists are
[1:16:55] they can't do it themselves
[1:16:59] what god has done and then they say
[1:17:02] it's evolution something just
[1:17:05] happened what
[1:17:09] now you can't get no dumber than that
[1:17:12] and there's a scientist
[1:17:13] listening to me today i said it
[1:17:17] you can't get no dumber than that
[1:17:20] to think that this thing just happened
[1:17:22] what just happened
[1:17:24] there's always a cause and effect your
[1:17:26] laws tell you that
[1:17:31] who calls this they still trying to
[1:17:34] understand the human body
[1:17:36] they don't know all about it and even if
[1:17:39] they dissect it to the
[1:17:40] to the last little cell or whatever the
[1:17:43] smallest part of you
[1:17:44] they still can't find life
[1:17:49] not even in a leaf they can't do it
[1:17:52] i've seen movies and they think it's all
[1:17:54] in electricity that ain't life
[1:17:57] electricity is just a cause
[1:18:01] of what life is
[1:18:07] well god is fire let's see if you put
[1:18:09] some fire on the inside
[1:18:15] oh ain't got good
[1:18:18] you know when we understand this and i'm
[1:18:20] closing i'm closing because i said i
[1:18:22] would
[1:18:25] this is the part that i wanted to say
[1:18:27] also this morning
[1:18:29] i may have said it just a little bit
[1:18:34] but there are times when david and
[1:18:37] myself become one
[1:18:40] when there's a giant before me
[1:18:43] i likened myself to a fearless david
[1:18:48] i really do and when i'm losing a battle
[1:18:53] and i know listen i have to say son
[1:18:56] stand still
[1:18:59] you know but when i say son stand still
[1:19:02] i'm saying like lord don't let the
[1:19:03] rapture come till i get this right
[1:19:07] you know and and and when i when i look
[1:19:10] at these characters
[1:19:11] because i look at that later this
[1:19:12] morning i preached on she says i'm that
[1:19:15] kind of a woman
[1:19:16] i'm a shunamite woman what made her
[1:19:20] impersonate that what made her
[1:19:23] feel connected right
[1:19:26] now these people what you don't
[1:19:28] understand christ was in moses
[1:19:31] christ was in joshua christ was in all
[1:19:34] the great men of god
[1:19:36] and every one of them had a function
[1:19:40] something and i just you know what i you
[1:19:42] know
[1:19:43] uh uh this is this is what i love
[1:19:48] when when when uh what what's the one
[1:19:50] that went with judah
[1:19:51] i can't think of a name now well
[1:19:55] okay let's just go to rahab huh
[1:19:59] tamar yeah you know i have something
[1:20:01] about i like tamar
[1:20:04] i really like tamar because you know
[1:20:07] what she went
[1:20:08] out of her way don't feel bad i couldn't
[1:20:11] think about it either
[1:20:13] but my thing is tamar went out do you
[1:20:16] understand
[1:20:17] you talking about a virtuous woman
[1:20:20] who's never lived a life
[1:20:24] as a prostitute but would
[1:20:28] dare to go out of her comfort zone
[1:20:32] to disguise herself as a prostitute
[1:20:37] to make sure she get what she wanted
[1:20:40] now where did that inspiration come from
[1:20:45] don't tell me it came from the devil no
[1:20:47] no no no no
[1:20:48] that was an inspiration because brother
[1:20:50] brown said god works on both ends
[1:20:52] and because judah was so stubborn and
[1:20:54] didn't do want to do the will of god
[1:20:56] which was the word
[1:20:58] god made it happen
[1:21:01] you understand me and then when god
[1:21:04] blessed tamar
[1:21:05] she comes up with twins huh
[1:21:09] and even out of the mouth of judah he
[1:21:12] said you are a more righteous woman than
[1:21:14] i
[1:21:14] am so you think that was not god
[1:21:18] calling her righteous because of what
[1:21:20] she did
[1:21:22] why did not god
[1:21:26] when it came to esau and jacob
[1:21:33] never was really punished
[1:21:37] you think you think sarah i think was
[1:21:38] there uh
[1:21:42] would have been punished not you know
[1:21:45] who i'm speaking on
[1:21:47] but she was not punished and she was
[1:21:50] she helped jacob shyster
[1:21:54] [Laughter]
[1:21:55] esau rachel
[1:21:59] rebecca i knew it was amen help
[1:22:03] shyster and god never
[1:22:06] ever mentioned about getting her
[1:22:10] for doing what she did what was it
[1:22:13] god had already spoke to her and told
[1:22:16] her
[1:22:17] that jacob would be the ruler of esau
[1:22:22] and she knew that her husband was about
[1:22:25] to die
[1:22:26] it was a blessing time this is time of
[1:22:29] the blessing
[1:22:30] and she watched carefully
[1:22:33] because of what god she didn't know how
[1:22:35] god was going to do it
[1:22:37] but she was waiting and guess what
[1:22:41] god holding the prophet's eyes
[1:22:45] so god is like working together with her
[1:22:50] see god does things you can't define him
[1:22:55] and he's working with her and here was
[1:22:57] the prophet deceived
[1:22:59] and and giving jacob all the blessings
[1:23:02] esau gets mad with him he runs away
[1:23:05] because he know esau had a temper
[1:23:07] probably would have killed him
[1:23:09] right he goes over to his uh
[1:23:12] brother-in-law
[1:23:13] his uh wife his mother's brother's
[1:23:16] house you know and and what happens
[1:23:20] he gets a little spanking but isn't that
[1:23:23] wonderful by god spanking him he says
[1:23:26] here
[1:23:27] here here
[1:23:30] he's a just god he's a merciful god
[1:23:34] what i'm trying to say unto us people of
[1:23:36] god we're the bride of jesus christ
[1:23:39] we make mistakes
[1:23:42] but god could never put us away
[1:23:45] he can't you're part of him
[1:23:49] all the scripture shows he could never
[1:23:51] put
[1:23:52] us away he only divorced israel because
[1:23:55] that part of israel was never his
[1:23:59] but when it comes to the true seed of
[1:24:00] god he can never lose one
[1:24:04] and so when we look at this thing yes
[1:24:06] we've made a lot of mistakes i have
[1:24:08] and i say to god i say to him today
[1:24:11] i don't know how you're going to do it
[1:24:15] but i'm that bride and i
[1:24:18] am going to witness and i am going to be
[1:24:22] evidence that this message is 100
[1:24:25] right i'm going to be evidence
[1:24:28] that william branham was your prophet
[1:24:30] i'm gonna be
[1:24:31] evidence that jesus christ is the same
[1:24:34] yesterday today and forever
[1:24:36] i'm gonna be evidenced that there is a
[1:24:39] rapture in me
[1:24:41] you hear me nothing can stop that
[1:24:44] absolutely
[1:24:45] nothing and what god has determined and
[1:24:48] ordained
[1:24:49] nothing can stop it hallelujah and we
[1:24:52] ought to be excited
[1:24:54] to know that god has chosen us for this
[1:24:57] last
[1:24:57] moment as the evidence of his
[1:25:00] resurrection
[1:25:02] we're going to put a licking on the
[1:25:04] devil quickly and then get out of here
[1:25:07] and i am so happy and that's why i
[1:25:10] believe
[1:25:11] god led me to that message the
[1:25:12] supernatural i want everybody to listen
[1:25:14] to it
[1:25:15] not just one time listen over and over
[1:25:18] and over again i trust you

[1:31:15] chapter
[1:31:27] beginning at the 23rd verse
[1:31:33] for i have received of the lord that
[1:31:35] which also i delivered unto you
[1:31:39] that the lord jesus the same night in
[1:31:42] which he
[1:31:42] was betrayed took bread and when he had
[1:31:46] given thanks
