[0:00] God's word is God and so when we receive
[0:04] the true word then we're receiving God
[0:07] yes I'd like to carry on with my thought
[0:09] this morning I'm taking a slight uh
[0:12] change in Direction but I'm building
[0:14] upon what we studied this morning let's
[0:17] turn our uh to our Bibles here in
[0:19] Revelations chap 3 uh verse 14 I just
[0:24] want to read one verse there and I want
[0:26] to preach tonight on the amen and uh
[0:29] this morning morning I was dealing with
[0:31] the promised land that those those
[0:34] ancient landmarks were territorial
[0:36] absolutes and so I want to deal with uh
[0:40] our absolute in this hour Revelations 3
[0:45] verse 14 everybody love the Lord amen
[0:49] you're very familiar with this this is
[0:51] directly to our age and unto the angel
[0:55] of the Church of the Le oans write these
[0:58] things say the
[1:00] amen I want you to notice Jesus Christ
[1:03] in red writing is calling himself the
[1:07] amen the faithful and the true witness
[1:11] the beginning of the creation of God I
[1:13] want to read it one more time and unto
[1:15] the angel the Church of the leans write
[1:19] these things saith the amen the faithful
[1:23] and the true witness the beginning of
[1:26] the creation of god let's bow our heads
[1:28] Heavenly Father we we thank you for the
[1:30] worship we thank you for the word we
[1:33] thank you for your spirit God we just
[1:36] thank you Lord for all that you've done
[1:38] God your grace is so wonderful and
[1:41] father we ask dear God you just bring us
[1:44] into more dimensions of that Grace this
[1:46] evening God we commit our souls to you
[1:49] now in Jesus holy name amen you have
[1:53] your seats how many appreciate the grace
[1:55] of God Amen the Bible said no man will
[1:58] boast we are depending upon the grace of
[2:01] God I want to once again preach this
[2:04] evening on the uh the amen and Jesus is
[2:08] Calling himself here the amen and I
[2:11] looked at the definition where with some
[2:13] a word that we use at least Christians
[2:16] we use it every service we say it in our
[2:19] conversations and we know amen means so
[2:22] be it but another definition means firm
[2:25] or faithful it means uh surely
[2:30] truly of a truth it it means so be it
[2:35] and uh it was custom in the synagogues
[2:38] and Christian assemblies in the days of
[2:40] old that after they had offered solemn
[2:43] prayer to God the others responded amen
[2:47] and thus made the substance of what was
[2:50] uttered their own so when the word of
[2:53] God goes forth from the pulpit and you
[2:55] say Amen then you're saying you're
[2:57] taking the substance of what was said is
[3:00] saying that's mine so when you say God
[3:03] Is A Healer you say amen and say that's
[3:05] mine that's mine when he says he's the
[3:08] Savior that's mine he's my husband my
[3:11] breath my sunshine my all in all and you
[3:14] amen and you say that's mine I claim it
[3:16] ain't that wonderful and then the nation
[3:19] the individual could aim in the word or
[3:22] even the nation of Israel would amen the
[3:25] word and what they were saying is the
[3:27] nation would confirm the Covenant by
[3:30] saying amen they were saying I receive
[3:32] the Covenant how many ever heard that
[3:34] brother bam said that this Grace
[3:36] Covenant is an unconditional Covenant
[3:38] amen amen well you got to remember it is
[3:42] unconditional but the part of the
[3:44] Covenant the Covenant is an agreement
[3:47] yeah so you say well if it's
[3:48] unconditional why isn't the lost you
[3:50] know just God just saving them well you
[3:53] got to accept it amen and upon the basis
[3:56] of agreeing and saying amen then it
[3:59] becomes yours
[4:00] and it's an unconditional Covenant to
[4:02] you how many receive that Grace tonight
[4:05] notice this in Jeremiah 11 just to use
[4:08] an example of the word amen in Jeremiah
[4:13] 11:1 he says the words that came to
[4:16] Jeremiah from the Lord saying hear ye
[4:19] the words of this Covenant and speak
[4:21] unto the men of Judah and to the
[4:23] inhabitants of Jerusalem and say unto
[4:26] them thus sayith the Lord God of Israel
[4:29] curse said be the man that obeth not the
[4:31] words of this Covenant which is
[4:33] commanded your fathers in in the day in
[4:35] which I brought them forth out of the
[4:37] land of Egypt from the iron furnace
[4:39] saying obey my voice do them according
[4:43] to all which I command you and so shall
[4:45] you be my people and I will be your God
[4:48] and that I may perform the oath which I
[4:50] have sworn unto your fathers to give
[4:52] them a land flowing with milk and honey
[4:55] as it is this day then answered I
[4:57] Jeremiah and said so be Lord amen I
[5:01] received the Covenant that you promised
[5:04] to my fathers once again when you said
[5:06] amen that response is making what is
[5:09] uttered theirs am it's important to amen
[5:13] the word of God notice in Deuteronomy
[5:15] chapter 27:15 as I just kind of start
[5:18] building here Deuteronomy
[5:22] 27:15 he says cursed be the man that
[5:24] maketh any Graven or molten image or an
[5:28] uh an abomination unto the Lord the work
[5:31] of the hands of the Craftsman and
[5:32] putteth it in a secret place and all the
[5:35] people shall answer and say Amen cursed
[5:38] be he that sth light by his father or
[5:41] his mother and all the people shall say
[5:43] Amen cursed be he that removeth his
[5:46] neighbor's landmark and all the people
[5:48] shall say Amen cursed be he that maketh
[5:52] the blind to wander out of the way and
[5:54] all the people shall say Amen cursed be
[5:57] he that prefer judgment and it goes on
[6:00] cursed be he that lith with his father's
[6:02] wife cursed be he that layth with any
[6:05] manner of Beast cursed be he that lth
[6:07] with his sister curs to being as layth
[6:09] with his mother-in-law or smidth his
[6:11] neighbor taketh the reward of the
[6:13] innocent and and they all said amen
[6:17] because they were saying we believe it
[6:19] we receive that amen isn't that right
[6:22] then brother Brandon makes an astounding
[6:25] uh statement to me it was he said uh
[6:28] amen
[6:30] he said many times an absolute is the
[6:33] last word and we call the amen amen so
[6:37] brother random said the word amen is an
[6:40] absolute yes sir amen can you believe
[6:43] can you believe that amen and I brother
[6:45] brandom gave many examples of an
[6:47] absolute because I'm dealing with the
[6:49] amen tonight Jesus said I am the amen
[6:52] and brother brandom said a ship is on a
[6:55] Raging Sea and it may have a a sail and
[6:59] it's at the mercy of the wind and he
[7:02] said if the waves go to crashing and
[7:04] there's enough water he said it could
[7:06] sink the ship he said it drops thousands
[7:09] of pounds of metal called an anchor and
[7:13] he said it'll drop beneath the ocean and
[7:15] it'll Connect into a great Mountain
[7:17] under the water and he said the waves
[7:19] will hit it the waves will strike it but
[7:22] it cannot sink it because it is anchored
[7:25] in a mountain under the water amen ain't
[7:29] that right right so an amen is like a
[7:31] solid rock that I'm tied to an amen is
[7:34] an absolute that when everything is
[7:37] falling apart and the world is falling
[7:40] apart I have an anchor I have an
[7:43] absolute let the world pass away but I'm
[7:47] anchored in the Son of God he is my amen
[7:51] he is my sovet he is my
[7:54] finality ain't that wonderful brother
[7:57] ROM said that job was connected to that
[8:00] same absolute when I was talking about
[8:03] him this morning when the devil
[8:04] Unleashed his his his uh Powers upon job
[8:09] job never moved because the birth
[8:12] sacrifice was his absolute even if they
[8:15] said you're a secret sinner he said I've
[8:17] come the provided way even if he said
[8:20] your God hates you and you've lost
[8:22] everything if the devil lied to he would
[8:25] stand upon that
[8:27] unmovable we'll never survive this age
[8:30] unless we have an
[8:32] absolute is that okay how many have an
[8:35] absolute of the Soul talking about
[8:38] driving down a state it is our absolute
[8:41] the sacrifice was job's absolute he hung
[8:44] his soul on it all hell tried to move
[8:47] him but could not how many love the Lord
[8:50] amen because he was anchored in a
[8:53] promise of God called the burnt
[8:55] sacrifice but you know the Bible says
[8:57] all say all oh the Bible said all the
[9:01] promises of God are yay and amen amen it
[9:05] isn't just our sacrifice healing is good
[9:08] for you peace is good for you love is
[9:11] good for you anything in the word of God
[9:14] it is yay and it is amen but you want to
[9:17] watch what your absolute is I've seen
[9:20] many come into my assembly and their
[9:22] absolute become some social Gathering or
[9:26] sometimes if you're not careful the
[9:27] pastor can become the ACT abolute if
[9:30] you're not careful there's there's uh
[9:32] different your girlfriend or your
[9:34] boyfriend or your mother or whatever it
[9:37] may be you must make sure you have the
[9:40] right absolute and Jesus said I am the
[9:43] amen I am the absolute and right I'm the
[9:47] final word the Bible is the amen the
[9:51] Bible is the absolute brother R told a
[9:53] story that he used to go with a little
[9:55] girlfriend before he got married and he
[9:58] said that they were good people Nazarene
[10:00] people and he said it's Daddy and him
[10:03] her daddy and him uh used to talk
[10:06] scripture all the time and he said that
[10:08] he invited him over and said why don't
[10:10] you come spend a night with me brother
[10:12] Bill and so brother Venom came to his
[10:15] house the women went upstairs and the
[10:17] father laid on the floor downstairs and
[10:20] they would go around about baptism in
[10:22] Jesus Christ's name and brother brandom
[10:25] said one night they talked till about
[10:26] one and he said I went to sleep on it
[10:29] and he said ' I dreamed I was uh the man
[10:32] told brother brandom he said I dreamed
[10:34] that I was building he was a
[10:35] construction worker a building in New
[10:38] Albany and he said a man left me a
[10:40] blueprint and he said he went to Florida
[10:43] and he had on the blueprint a certain
[10:45] bay window and I said that man don't
[10:47] want that bay window there so I just
[10:49] left it off and when the man come back
[10:52] he said I will not pay you for the
[10:54] building until you tear it down and
[10:56] rebuild it according to the blueprint he
[10:58] said what you make of that brother
[11:00] brandom he said there's a creek right
[11:02] down here it isn't very far and that man
[11:04] went and was baptized in Jesus Christ's
[11:07] name because it was an
[11:10] absolute and he was showing just by a
[11:12] simple illustration that to a
[11:14] construction worker the blueprint is the
[11:18] absolute his ideas doesn't matter
[11:21] anyone's opinion doesn't matter he's got
[11:24] to build it according to the
[11:27] blueprint everyone love the Lord am
[11:30] brother Brandon talked about the North
[11:31] Star thank you so much the North Star he
[11:34] said it hangs in the heaven any Hunter
[11:36] he said your your uh uh North Star is
[11:40] what guides you your compass it points
[11:43] to the north star and he said that is is
[11:46] an absolute to get your bearing and this
[11:49] is what he said that was so beautiful to
[11:51] me he said an absolute takes away all
[11:54] fear amen amen see you wouldn't question
[11:58] the North Star
[11:59] am you wouldn't question am I going the
[12:02] right way if if if you see the north
[12:04] star with Assurance you can get your
[12:07] bearing and say I know that I arrive to
[12:09] my destination because it isn't going to
[12:12] change it's something that will always
[12:14] be men will change anes will change
[12:18] cultures will change but the absolute
[12:20] will not change and he said so he said
[12:24] it settles it we're anchored it takes
[12:27] the fear away and that's what I want to
[12:29] do this morning is to show you when
[12:31] we're standing in faith in God's word it
[12:34] takes away your fear and you can stand
[12:37] like joob had that right brother the ROM
[12:40] said a red light in traffic is an
[12:42] absolute as simple as it may sound he
[12:45] said if there were no red lights it
[12:47] would be total chaos he said but when
[12:49] they come and that red light says stop
[12:52] you stop or you going to pay the price a
[12:55] that right and brother bom said uh and
[12:59] of a baseball game he said could you
[13:02] imagine the confusion if there was no
[13:04] umpire he said and everyone would be
[13:06] just arguing it back and forth but there
[13:09] has to be an authority there has to be
[13:11] something that when he speaks whether
[13:14] he's right or not everyone's got to
[13:16] submit to the absolute is that wonderful
[13:20] another place brother Ram said the
[13:21] Supreme Court was an amen it was an
[13:24] absolute he said it is the final end of
[13:27] all arguments he said the court will
[13:30] make a decision you go no further than
[13:33] that decision you may not agree with
[13:35] their decision but you will not go any
[13:38] further because they are the absolute as
[13:41] the Supreme Court can I carry on and so
[13:45] we find that there are Baptist doctrines
[13:47] there are Lutheran doctrines there are
[13:49] Pentecostal doctrines there are
[13:50] Methodist doctrines Pilgrim Holiness and
[13:53] they've got all kinds of the uh uh
[13:56] Creeds and denominations and the people
[13:58] are in utter confusion yeah but
[14:01] nonetheless God calls himself the
[14:04] amen he says this in Isaiah chapter
[14:08] 65:6 I have quite a few quotes if this
[14:11] is all right in Isaiah
[14:14] 65:16 you may be familiar with this
[14:16] scripture and he who blesses himself in
[14:19] the
[14:20] Earth shall bless himself in the god of
[14:23] Truth and if you break down that word
[14:26] truth and Define it it is the god of the
[14:30] amen and he that swear in the Earth
[14:32] shall swear by the god of the amen
[14:35] because the former troubles are
[14:37] forgotten and because they are HID from
[14:39] my eyes brother benam said this in the
[14:41] Lan church he said he is the god of the
[14:44] amen he never changes he does never
[14:47] change he says it it stands fast he does
[14:51] it and it's done forever none can take
[14:54] from what he does none can add to it so
[14:58] let it be amen so let it be he said
[15:00] aren't you glad you serve that kind of
[15:02] God you know you can know exactly where
[15:06] you are with him any time all the time
[15:10] he is the amen God he will not change
[15:14] you know where you stand with God you
[15:16] know who God is what he done when he
[15:19] redeemed you and you don't have to worry
[15:21] about it changing on you his grace will
[15:24] be right there for you this healing will
[15:26] be right there for you and that Wonder
[15:29] the amen means the last word brother bam
[15:33] said it's an absolute I've used it many
[15:35] times it is the last word and he said it
[15:38] is the ultimate it means you reached the
[15:43] end there is no other court of appeal it
[15:46] goes as far as God and it
[15:50] stops can I carry
[15:52] on so I ask you and I and now we're
[15:55] going to go in a little deeper the word
[15:58] is our absolute yes let me go further
[16:02] amen is it the sealed word or the
[16:05] revealed
[16:07] word because there's a
[16:10] difference because every denomination in
[16:13] this city has a Bible amen but where
[16:16] will it put them in the
[16:18] Rapture is it truly their absolute
[16:20] though they quote for from it and
[16:23] brother bam said this uh that God the
[16:27] interpretation of the the word comes to
[16:29] the prophet how many believe that Bible
[16:32] said God at Sun Dr times in div diverse
[16:35] manner spake to the fathers by the
[16:37] prophets and the Bible said that no
[16:39] Prophecy of the scriptures of any
[16:41] private
[16:42] interpretation therefore it is a sealed
[16:44] book and we have no thought coming we
[16:47] have no comments coming it takes God who
[16:49] wrote the book to interpret the book A
[16:52] that right so yes the written word is an
[16:57] absolute but the reation of the word and
[17:00] the manifested word and the Vindicated
[17:04] word is absolutely an absolute in this
[17:08] house notice this Jeremiah the Lord said
[17:12] I have put my words in your mouth so let
[17:16] me ask you where is the absolute yes
[17:19] Lord is God's word the absolute amen God
[17:22] said I put my words in that prophet's
[17:24] mouth he said it in the days of Joel
[17:27] that the word of the Lord came to Joel
[17:29] he said the word of the Lord came to
[17:31] Jonah the word of the Lord came to Micah
[17:34] the word of the Lord came to Zephaniah I
[17:36] want you to know the word of the Lord
[17:38] came to Jesus amen and and he had the
[17:41] authority of the Prophet when they said
[17:43] you are a man and you're making yourself
[17:46] God it was God making himself man and he
[17:50] said you are Gods to whom the word of
[17:53] God came God looked at Moses and said I
[17:56] have made you a god unto Pharaoh why was
[17:59] he a God because he was packing the
[18:02] absolute to the people God always let me
[18:06] say more specifically yes the word is
[18:09] the absolute but notice the revealed
[18:12] word the Vindicated word is the absolute
[18:16] to the hour amen I want you to notice
[18:18] Abel's revelation God Vindicated God
[18:21] Vindicated Noah God Vindicated Moses god
[18:24] Vindicated Elijah Mount Carmel God
[18:27] Vindicated the prophet and God will
[18:30] always vindicate his absolute is this
[18:34] okay in other words God will get the
[18:36] last word in other words that God uh man
[18:39] will deny God's word but God will
[18:41] vindicate his absolute ain't that right
[18:44] remember the time that Jeremiah
[18:47] prophesied that that uh the children of
[18:50] Israel would go into captivity for 70
[18:52] years and then hananiah the prophet came
[18:55] and said oh no God will break the Yoke
[18:57] of Babylon in two years years and
[18:59] Jeremiah surprisingly said amen and he
[19:02] said but I want to say something the
[19:04] prophet that prophesies peace which was
[19:07] Hanah he said that Prophet will be known
[19:10] after what he says comes to pass so in
[19:13] other words that what Hanah said was
[19:15] according to the scripture but it was
[19:18] not an absolute because God did not
[19:20] vindicate it remember the words of
[19:23] Samuel it was not Samuel's words it was
[19:26] God's words and God's words is an
[19:29] absolute and God would not let his words
[19:31] fall to the ground ain't that right
[19:34] we're in a world of religious confusion
[19:37] in the days of Jesus it was religious
[19:39] confusion and some of the Sadducees said
[19:43] there is no resurrection and Jesus
[19:45] looked at him and said you do Heir
[19:47] concerning the scriptures and the power
[19:49] of God you're off on both of them and
[19:53] they had a Bible that they boasted on he
[19:56] called them blind leaders of the blind
[19:59] though they possessed the Bible amen now
[20:01] notice God Vindicated his message when
[20:05] Jesus said if you don't believe me
[20:08] believe the works for the works testify
[20:11] that I am the absolute in this day amen
[20:14] is that right that's right notice he
[20:16] said uh it was Nicodemus said no man
[20:18] could do this except in these Miracles
[20:21] except God was with him Jesus perceived
[20:24] their thoughts in many places the Bible
[20:26] said the word of God discerned thoughts
[20:29] is this all right now remember the
[20:32] scripture that I read in the Old
[20:34] Testament brother Ram said this in the
[20:36] late oan Church age he is the god of the
[20:39] amen he never changes what he does never
[20:42] changes he says it and it stands fast
[20:45] and it's done forever none can take or
[20:48] add to it he said aren't you glad you
[20:51] serve that kind of God it is Dependable
[20:54] it is reliable it is unmovable it is
[20:57] unchangeable come on it is the amen it
[21:01] is the absolute you can hang your soul
[21:04] on it and hang your children's Souls on
[21:06] it God interprets his own words he said
[21:10] let every man be a liar and mine be the
[21:12] truth how many believe the word of God
[21:15] Amen means finality amen means so be it
[21:19] the book of Romans was closed with the
[21:21] word amen First Corinthians was closed
[21:25] but amen Second Corinthians Galatians
[21:28] Ephesians Philippians Colossians first
[21:31] Thessalonians second Thessalonians First
[21:33] Timothy second Timothy Titus Filman
[21:36] Hebrews first Peter second Peter first
[21:39] John second John Jude and Revelation and
[21:42] the very last word of the Bible is amen
[21:46] so be it amen it's mine I receive it the
[21:51] amen The Authority the last word how
[21:55] many believe that brother R said it is
[21:58] reached its end he said I am the amen
[22:03] here's another one brother R said
[22:04] Hallelujah here is Jehovah the old the
[22:07] god of the amen here is Jesus of the New
[22:10] Testament he is the god of the amen amen
[22:14] here o Israel the Lord your God is one
[22:17] he said there it is again Jehovah of the
[22:19] Old Testament is Jesus of the new he
[22:21] said notice the New Testament does not
[22:23] reveal another God it is a further
[22:25] revelation of the one and the same God
[22:29] Jesus Is God and the father they're one
[22:32] there is one God and his name is the
[22:34] Lord Jesus and in this last age in the
[22:37] in the Ephesus age he said these things
[22:40] right he that holds the Seven Stars and
[22:42] walks in the midst of the golden
[22:44] candlesticks in the second age he said
[22:46] these things are he the first and the
[22:49] last which was the dead and alive again
[22:52] in the third age he said these things
[22:54] sayith he with the sharp sword with two
[22:56] edges in the fourth age he said these
[22:59] things saith the Son of God whose eyes
[23:02] are as flame of fire and his feet as
[23:04] fine brass in the fifth age he said
[23:06] these things have he with the seven
[23:09] spirits of God and the Seven Stars and
[23:11] the sixth age these things say he that
[23:14] is Holy and he that is true that has the
[23:16] Key of David he said that openeth and no
[23:19] man can shut and shut and no man can
[23:21] open but in the seventh age which is the
[23:24] last age he said unto the angel of the
[23:27] Church of the L of he has right these
[23:29] things sayith the amen am in the seventh
[23:33] age he was coming to the end yes he was
[23:36] coming to the finality amen and brother
[23:38] randam said notice it is not revealed
[23:41] unto the church ages until the
[23:44] denominational ages have run out and
[23:47] time shall be no more it's only revealed
[23:50] after the denominational ages have run
[23:53] out that's the reason the thing is
[23:55] scrupled up they pick up a little
[23:57] Doctrine they run over here and say this
[24:00] is it another picks up another Doctrine
[24:02] runs over here and says this is it each
[24:05] one builds denomination until we got
[24:07] hundreds of denominations but still in
[24:10] the midst of it all he said in all the
[24:13] confusion the people are wondering what
[24:16] is truth amen and in the seventh age God
[24:19] reveals himself as the amen amen Jesus
[24:23] is giving himself this description in
[24:26] relation to the last age
[24:28] the days of grace are winding up his
[24:31] look from the first century right
[24:33] through the 20th and all these things
[24:35] concerning the ages but before he
[24:38] reveals the characteristics of the last
[24:40] age he gives us one final look at his
[24:43] gracious Supreme deity this is the
[24:46] Capstone revelation of
[24:49] himself thus saith the
[24:53] amen Jesus is the soet of God it stands
[24:58] for finality it stands for approval amen
[25:02] it stands for prevailing promise it
[25:05] stands for unchanging promise listen it
[25:08] stands for the Seal of
[25:13] God how they want to be sealed by the
[25:16] amen you see what the message is it's
[25:19] more than just another message he said I
[25:22] like that it means whatever he said is
[25:24] final yes it means whatever he said in
[25:27] the first stage second in all the ages
[25:29] his own true church and about the false
[25:32] Vine is exactly right and it won't
[25:34] change it means what he started out in
[25:37] Genesis he will finish in Revelation he
[25:40] has to because he is the amen now we can
[25:43] see again the devil hates the Book of
[25:45] Genesis and the Book of Revelation he
[25:47] hates the truth he knows the truth will
[25:50] prevail he knows what his hand will be
[25:54] he fights that but we are on The Winning
[25:57] Side I mean the Believers of his word
[26:00] only are on the amen
[26:03] side you love the Lord can I carry on a
[26:06] little further I know this is a lot of
[26:08] reading but I think it'll bless you
[26:10] brother B said the Baptists have their
[26:11] Creeds and dogmas and it's based upon
[26:15] what they call the
[26:17] absolute and you can't shake them they
[26:20] say the apostolic days and miracles are
[26:22] over and there is no baptism of the Holy
[26:25] Ghost subsequent to believing yes
[26:29] and they will hold the absolute and
[26:31] argue to you in your face this is the
[26:33] absolute then brother bam said the
[26:36] methodus based on the word says there is
[26:39] no water baptism sprinkling is not
[26:42] baptism and sanctification is the
[26:45] baptism of the Holy Ghost so they hold
[26:48] up the absolute and they say
[26:50] sanctification is the Holy
[26:52] Ghost and brother the B said the Church
[26:54] of Christ he said they major on
[26:57] regeneration ational baptism and too
[27:00] many cases go down wet Sinners and come
[27:03] up uh or dry Sinners and come up wet
[27:05] ones and they claim their Doctrine is
[27:07] word based and then he said go right
[27:10] down the line to the Pentecostals this
[27:12] coming out the church ages do they have
[27:13] the word give them the word test he said
[27:16] they'll sell out for sensation every
[27:18] time if you if you can produce a
[27:21] manifestation like oil and blood and
[27:23] tongues and signs whether in the word or
[27:25] not whether properly interpreted from
[27:27] the word and the majority will fall for
[27:29] it so brother R now is just those are a
[27:32] couple examples but the list goes on and
[27:34] on he says what is happened to the word
[27:37] the word has been put aside but now in
[27:40] the seventh age God says I'm going
[27:43] against you all and I'm going to skew
[27:45] you out of my mouth for this is the end
[27:48] listen seven out of Seven Ages have
[27:51] esteemed men's word above his word and
[27:55] so this is the end and I'm spewing you
[27:57] out he said it's all over and I'm going
[28:00] to speak I'm here in the midst of the
[28:03] church the amen of God faithful and true
[28:06] and will reveal himself by my Prophet
[28:09] revelations 10:7 in the days of the
[28:12] voice of the seventh angel when he
[28:13] begins to sound the mystery of God will
[28:15] be finished as he declared to his
[28:17] servants the prophets he said there it
[28:18] is he's sending a Vindicated prophet he
[28:22] is sending a prophet almost after 2,000
[28:25] years someone who will be far from
[28:27] organization and education and World
[28:29] religion as John the baptism old he will
[28:32] hear only from God he will have thus
[28:35] sayth the Lord for he will speak for God
[28:38] he will be God's mouthpiece he will as
[28:41] it's declared in Malachi 4:6 will turn
[28:43] the hearts of the children back to the
[28:45] fathers he will bring back the elect of
[28:48] the last day and they will hear the
[28:50] Vindicated prophet and give the exact
[28:52] truth as it was with Paul he will
[28:54] restore the truth as they had it and
[28:57] those El with him in that day will be
[29:00] the ones who truly manifest the Lord and
[29:02] will be the body and be his voice and
[29:06] perform his works and he said do you see
[29:09] it because once again God always
[29:12] vindicates his act salute so the
[29:15] denominational ages had their chance to
[29:18] talk but in this last day Jesus said I
[29:21] will talk for myself and he does it by a
[29:24] mouthpiece for the brand is not God for
[29:27] the brand is of my fall and the spirit
[29:29] is speaking through him and the
[29:31] Believers are receiving it and when they
[29:34] receive it they are receiving their
[29:37] absolute do you believe that God is
[29:40] vindicating his absolute every doctrine
[29:43] that brother ROM preached was word-based
[29:47] amen every Doctrine he preached was
[29:49] word-based and then notice people say
[29:52] well brother renam went crazy and uh and
[29:55] you know just went off on his Doctrine I
[29:57] want to ask ask you if he went off in
[29:59] his Doctrine why did God Amen in
[30:03] amen how was it that thousands times
[30:06] 10,000s of discernment was 100%
[30:10] accurate how was he never
[30:12] wrong why was God vindicating a
[30:18] lie the Lord am why is there a picture
[30:22] today in the Library of Congress pull it
[30:25] up on the internet Library of Congress
[30:26] William Mary and brandham and he's
[30:28] hanging there how many hear their
[30:30] picture at the Library of
[30:33] Congress well there's a good reason why
[30:36] it's in there you just don't get your
[30:37] picture hung in the Library of Congress
[30:39] amen the only supernatural being a to be
[30:42] photographed on film why did God
[30:45] vindicate him if he was a false prophet
[30:48] and then the cloud people now are really
[30:51] attacking the cloud the seven angels the
[30:54] first time brother brandham ever speaks
[30:56] of the Seven Angels was in a message
[30:58] called standing in the Gap and brother
[31:00] brandom shows look this is Christ and
[31:03] mean and God just showed it to him and
[31:05] he begins to expound the Seven Angels
[31:07] were descending with the message and
[31:09] he's going on and on and he then
[31:11] preaches his sermon but at the end of
[31:14] the sermon it's astounding a man falls
[31:18] dead in the congregation by the name of
[31:20] brother Wayne and brother Bram says
[31:22] settle down he walks down off the pulpit
[31:25] prays and a dead man is brought back
[31:27] back to life again why did God Amen act
[31:31] if he was telling a
[31:35] lie oh just Amen in your own word amen
[31:39] do you believe
[31:41] that how many believe that with all
[31:43] their heart if then the message is the
[31:47] Vindication of God if it is the amen
[31:51] message then we need to be very careful
[31:54] how we handle Holiness yes
[31:58] because brother random says if a woman
[32:00] wear that which pertaining to a man or
[32:02] vice versa it is an Abomination if a man
[32:05] look upon a woman in such it's an
[32:08] Abomination a that right and brother R
[32:11] makes several statements like this he
[32:13] said some of those women on the platform
[32:15] their dresses above their knees notice
[32:17] they're wearing dresses are cut so tight
[32:19] it shows every form and every move they
[32:22] make until their underneath clothes is
[32:23] sh them through their dresses it's as
[32:25] bad as shorts bikin
[32:28] or anything you Pentecostal blind lean
[32:32] preachers how long will God suffer you I
[32:35] don't know he God God be merciful to
[32:37] your blind eyes and give you eyes s amen
[32:41] so is this just for the ROM's opinion he
[32:43] was just kind of hard in this area he
[32:45] preferred or capitalized upon this area
[32:48] or was it Jesus Christ the
[32:50] amen here's another one he said notice
[32:53] he said you say brother bandom I don't
[32:55] wear shorts I wear slacks he said that's
[32:57] worse yeah the Bible said of a woman to
[32:59] put on that which pertained to a man is
[33:00] an Abomination and the Lord and God
[33:02] doesn't change and you wear those little
[33:04] old skirts sticking of skirts so tight
[33:07] that you're going down the street until
[33:09] it looks like the skin is on the outside
[33:11] you call yourself Holiness
[33:14] women look who he's talking to you're
[33:18] not talking about them out there is that
[33:20] the way a daughter of God would
[33:23] act well see now if you don't look at
[33:26] the message as an absolute
[33:28] then you can just pick and choose that's
[33:30] right but if you see what's behind the
[33:33] message you will see the amen that's
[33:36] trying to get us Rapture Ready is this
[33:39] okay Amen brother bam said it again uh
[33:42] world is falling apart today years ago
[33:44] we used to find people in deep sincerity
[33:46] and worship and today it's become a
[33:48] bunch of Glamour in Hollywood and he
[33:50] said train music women on the platform
[33:52] with their clothes so tight and enough
[33:54] the skin on the outside almost dancing
[33:56] around the platform no sincere almost
[33:58] making outright ridiculous shame and
[34:01] professing
[34:02] Christianity I wonder if our offerings
[34:04] haven't become a stink in the nostrils
[34:06] of God here's another one he said you
[34:08] walk down bob hair Jezebel said don't
[34:11] know it's what th say the Lord means
[34:13] walk out here with a skinned looking
[34:15] dress and don't know you're guilty with
[34:17] committing adultery every day with
[34:20] hundreds of
[34:23] men that's not my absolute I'm just
[34:25] reading the absolute amen
[34:28] How could somebody argue when God comes
[34:31] down and amens at every
[34:33] service when he discerns and said now to
[34:36] show you it's not me God comes down and
[34:38] we're waiting on him and God comes and
[34:41] does what men cannot do and we look in
[34:44] the face of God and take it lightly yes
[34:48] I'm not trying to be a legalist preacher
[34:49] but this is the word and we M we amen
[34:52] the word brother B said the Holy Spirit
[34:55] punctuates every word of God
[34:58] with amen he said if a man has the
[35:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost he will amen
[35:03] the word he said true Faith always
[35:06] admits the word is right if your faith
[35:09] don't punctuate every word of God with
[35:11] amen then there's something wrong with
[35:13] your
[35:16] experience once you recognize it as God
[35:19] then you say I accept it Lord on your
[35:23] terms amen takes all the fear
[35:26] away the word is our absolute yes but I
[35:30] want to balance the statement now is
[35:32] this okay yes brother Brenham says this
[35:35] he is my absolute he is my stand here is
[35:39] my tist there's where I stand and if
[35:42] I've got the wrong thing God will not
[35:45] confirm it that's
[35:47] right if you've got the right thing God
[35:49] is obligated to confirm it there you are
[35:52] and the proof of it's the proof of it
[35:54] God is obligated to prove it's right or
[35:56] he'll have nothing to do with it ain't
[35:59] that
[35:59] wonderful I want you to notice now if I
[36:03] can go just a little further brother
[36:05] randam was talking about the pillar of
[36:07] fire that Paul met and he said that
[36:09] Pillar of Fire became Paul's TI poost
[36:11] and brother benam said the same Pillar
[36:13] of Fire has reappeared doing the same
[36:15] Works in this age and he said Brethren
[36:18] don't sleep don't you see that's the
[36:20] same God Among Us Now proving himself
[36:23] the same yesterday today and forever
[36:25] listen to this he said that is my
[36:30] absolute well brother Craig I thought
[36:32] the written word was this is a sealed
[36:35] book without Jesus Christ coming and
[36:36] saying his part amen and this Revelation
[36:41] is Jesus Christ the final word amen when
[36:44] all the men had their days to speak now
[36:47] God comes down and God speaks you say
[36:50] the Bible is my absolute not the message
[36:52] the message is the Bible made manifest
[36:54] in this day and we can go and show every
[36:57] scripture that God said it would be here
[37:00] this is the manifestation just like just
[37:03] like Peter said this is
[37:05] that this is the manifestation of what
[37:08] Jo preached and I'll say this is that
[37:12] Malachi 4 Luke 1730 Revelations 10
[37:16] Revelations 18 it goes on and on and on
[37:20] this is that you say brother Craig that
[37:22] was 50 years ago a message is to the
[37:25] entire age I was it born in 1963 but I'm
[37:29] still enjoying the same blessings and
[37:31] Revelation because it's to the age isn't
[37:35] that right but said that the word was
[37:37] led to each age then it goes on further
[37:40] to say that God in a pillar of fire met
[37:43] Moses at one time and he said uh Moses
[37:46] he said knew he was chosen this is what
[37:48] brother random said but he didn't have
[37:50] an
[37:51] absolute that's what he said and he said
[37:54] one day on The Backs side of the desert
[37:55] he had lost the vision God appeared in a
[37:57] burning bush bush and told him I'm
[37:59] sending you down to deliver my people
[38:02] and he said I don't speak well and and
[38:04] so forth they won't believe me he said
[38:06] what is in your hand and he said it's a
[38:08] serpent he said cast it down he threw it
[38:10] down and it became a serpent he picked
[38:12] it up it became a stick he said he was
[38:14] giving him the Assurance of vindication
[38:17] when God gives an absolute he vindicates
[38:20] the absolute
[38:22] always always say always always he
[38:25] vindicates the absolute always so Moses
[38:29] had went down he threw down his stick
[38:32] according to the word of the Lord and
[38:33] Jades and jambre impersonators done the
[38:36] same thing that God told him to do and
[38:39] Moses he didn't start crying and say it
[38:42] failed he had an absolute and he stood
[38:44] right there and said I did exactly what
[38:47] God required and as he waited Moses
[38:49] serpent started gobbling out the
[38:52] impersonator serpents amen the brother
[38:55] vom said this Moses followed his
[38:57] commandment he stand and watched the
[38:59] glory of God he was tied to his absolute
[39:03] and he stood still amen and when the
[39:05] serpent swallowed up the other serpents
[39:07] he was tied to his absolute now the
[39:10] enemy in every way will try to get you
[39:13] away from that
[39:16] absolute we need an absolute the pope
[39:19] right now is the most popular man that
[39:22] has ever been Israel is becoming
[39:25] isolated we are more in danger nuclear
[39:27] war than ever Sodom is on a on such a a
[39:31] just a tsunami they're just rising and
[39:34] the Christian is being silenced
[39:37] communism is infiltrating every end of
[39:40] the world we need an absolute it's
[39:42] getting dark and they're going to shut
[39:44] down these churches and we need an
[39:47] absolute something Vindicated something
[39:50] that we can have Assurance here that
[39:52] we'll stand in the face of its darkness
[39:54] and say God will be here God promised it
[39:58] we won't Buckle we won't back down we
[40:00] are anchored in a solid rock though the
[40:04] waves roll and though the persecutions
[40:06] come we have a Vindicated absolute a
[40:10] that right Satan discredits it he esteem
[40:13] lightly esteemed it the values it and he
[40:16] said the devil get you in a place where
[40:18] you don't know what to do remember you
[40:20] are tied to an
[40:23] abute that same Pillar of Fire that was
[40:26] Moses at absolute is the same Pillar of
[40:29] Fire today and it's our absolute it's
[40:32] the same Christ can you say amen Amen
[40:35] brother bam says something pretty
[40:37] amazing he says the shunamite woman when
[40:39] her baby died she went she got her her
[40:42] little mule or whatever it was and she
[40:44] went up to see the prophet and he said
[40:47] you know God has hid this from my eyes
[40:49] and when he said is all well she said
[40:51] all is well he said why he said this the
[40:54] woman's absolute was the prophet
[40:58] and he said the prophet's absolute was
[41:00] God and she could not say all this well
[41:04] she wasn't moved even at the death of
[41:06] her son because she knew God was in the
[41:09] prophet and the word comes to the
[41:11] prophet ain't that wonderful see the
[41:14] written word is infallible but men's
[41:17] interpretations are not right that's the
[41:21] problem so God's got to interpret itself
[41:23] because he's the author of it amen now
[41:26] remember Paul on the road to Damascus he
[41:28] was a student of the written
[41:30] word but he did not know the absolute
[41:34] until he met the pillar of fire and that
[41:37] Pillar of Fire he was still in Gross
[41:39] Darkness even though a student of the
[41:41] written word but it took light shined
[41:44] upon his path to bring him to the
[41:46] revelation of Jesus Christ he that right
[41:50] he came in contact with the living
[41:52] absolute amen and Christ was Paul's
[41:55] absolute it changed his life and and
[41:57] brother randam said that Paul became
[41:59] tied to that absolute for the rest of
[42:01] his life he said when he met God
[42:03] Vindicated by the word it settled it for
[42:06] the rest of his life he said because he
[42:08] seen God manifested and it was proven
[42:11] God by the word in the shape and the
[42:13] form and the audable voice of what it
[42:15] was this is okay he was tied to it there
[42:18] was something real he know it and nobody
[42:21] could take it away from it it was an
[42:23] absolute Assurance they stoned him three
[42:26] times but he was tied he had a shipwreck
[42:29] but he was tied they put him in prison
[42:32] his old men turned against him but he
[42:34] was tied to an absolute and so much he
[42:37] can look at death right in the face of
[42:39] say death where is I still oh grave
[42:42] where is I victory in so much he could
[42:45] pray and God refused to heal it and he'd
[42:47] say my grace is sufficient his faith did
[42:50] not waver he knew his grace was
[42:53] sufficient he was tied to the absolute
[42:56] that whatever come come he had Assurance
[42:59] amen the shite woman's absolute was the
[43:03] prophet The Prophet's absolute was God
[43:06] and Paul said follow me as I follow
[43:09] Christ because he was the mouthpiece to
[43:12] God we had no thoughts coming Ain that
[43:15] right brother R makes this statement he
[43:17] said I've got to come to one final
[43:19] absolute and he said oh here it is let
[43:22] let me back up he said now I'm not
[43:24] trying to assert Authority conduct an
[43:26] order 196 63 he said any man has two
[43:30] heads he doesn't know how to go God
[43:32] never did have two heads to his church
[43:35] he's always had one head he always dealt
[43:37] with every generation as we studied it
[43:40] through the scripture through one
[43:41] individual because you got two men they
[43:43] got two opinions I want you to notice
[43:46] every one of us in here have a different
[43:47] fingerprint every one of us in here have
[43:50] a different nose every one of us in here
[43:53] we think different and so we can look at
[43:55] the same absolute and come with two
[43:57] totally different conclusions and
[43:59] disagree because every man thinks he's
[44:01] right in his own eyes so God has to come
[44:04] down and interpret his own word uh and
[44:08] vindicate it to prove that this is my
[44:11] interpretation said it's got to come to
[44:13] one final absolute and that's the word
[44:15] the Bible as the pastor here of the
[44:17] church he said my absolute is the word
[44:20] and I know you Brothers kind of look at
[44:22] me as an absolute as long as I follow
[44:25] God you follow me
[44:27] as I follow
[44:30] Christ so I ask you that he follow
[44:34] Christ
[44:35] am I read you one I know I'm reading a
[44:38] lot but I thought it might bless you
[44:39] tonight brother said this now when the
[44:42] angel of the Lord speaks there's nothing
[44:45] that can stand before it it is an
[44:48] absolute he said my faith I know it's
[44:50] going to happen there's no need of
[44:53] saying anything more about it it's got
[44:54] to happen and if a person had been dead
[44:57] in the grave for 20 years and he would
[44:59] say go down and speak I would believe
[45:01] all Heaven would shake out of its orbit
[45:03] before that prayer would be refused to
[45:05] be answered God will do it and that's
[45:08] when it's really thus sayith the Lord
[45:11] how many believe this message is thus
[45:13] say the Lord God Vindicated it it was
[45:15] just like the boy at Finland brother vom
[45:18] was up on that mountain looking at a
[45:19] tower and he saw some cars and some
[45:23] ambulances down at the bottom of the
[45:25] hill and in that day they couldn't do
[45:27] anything until the parents got there and
[45:29] they said it looked like there had been
[45:30] an accident and brother randam and they
[45:32] drove down the hill when they got there
[45:34] you know the story Gordon Lindsay walked
[45:36] out and it was a boy car hit two boys
[45:39] and threw his body against the tree and
[45:41] crushed him brother ROM had this Vision
[45:43] two years before and then Jack Moore
[45:45] went and looked at him and come back
[45:47] crying and said brother brandom you
[45:48] ought to go look at this boy brother
[45:50] said I can't do it I got kids at home
[45:52] and pretty soon brother random went and
[45:54] they said pull the sheet back and he
[45:55] pulled it back and there was the boy and
[45:58] he said something looked familiar about
[46:00] the boy and he said he turned and
[46:02] started to walk to the car and that same
[46:04] hand that turned him around this morning
[46:06] turned him around at this scene and he
[46:09] said he turned and looked and all of a
[46:11] sudden something sometimes God's got to
[46:13] turn us around sometimes God is right
[46:16] there and he's got to tap us on the
[46:18] shoulder to get our attention and so he
[46:21] had to get the prophet's attention cuz
[46:23] he's like you and I we never would have
[46:25] saw him except God didn't turn us
[46:28] around he stops he looks at the boy he
[46:31] looks at the crowd he looks at the Rocks
[46:34] he looks at the trees and the wind
[46:36] laughing in the rain and he said
[46:38] something is familiar and he walked back
[46:40] and said show me that boy again and they
[46:42] pulled it back and all of a sudden the
[46:45] spirit of the Lord revealed to him this
[46:46] is the one I told you about two years
[46:48] prior yesen that wonderful and he said
[46:51] there was Jack Moore there everything
[46:53] was written in the Bible he said what
[46:55] was it an a absolute the father had
[46:58] showed me what would take place and
[47:01] there was no fear standing there
[47:04] absolute sure he'll
[47:07] rise amen right there in front of
[47:09] thousands people were saying this is
[47:11] that Prophet there were there's about
[47:13] 300 rather that was making fun of him
[47:16] and he said uh they he said but he
[47:18] didn't fear he said what was it the
[47:21] absolute listen to what he said the
[47:23] vision
[47:25] amen amen then he brings it to the word
[47:28] he said uh I do what the father says he
[47:31] that believeth me the works that I do he
[47:33] should do also there's your absolute he
[47:36] said he said I said death you can't hold
[47:39] him no longer am God has spoken amen
[47:45] come back and give him up and he said
[47:47] that boy raised and looked around and
[47:49] the people went to fad he said it was
[47:51] signed by the mayor of the city and the
[47:53] Republic what is it an absolute that
[47:57] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[48:00] and
[48:02] forever when those seven angels come
[48:04] down and form the face of Christ brother
[48:07] brandom said brother brandom said Paul
[48:09] when he met the pillar of fire knew that
[48:10] it was God's absolute and he said God
[48:13] come down at the river and he knew the
[48:15] same and then when brother bam said the
[48:17] seven angels come down and he said they
[48:19] met him and science took the picture he
[48:22] said it's a paradox but it was an
[48:24] absolute he said it tied me tight into
[48:27] Jesus Christ winding his life into me he
[48:31] said that seven angels was an absolute
[48:34] why because it was the word Revelations
[48:37] 10 1-7 is this all right God was
[48:41] completing the Plan of
[48:43] Redemption so God amened his own word I
[48:47] want to say this we know what we stand
[48:50] on every word of God is
[48:53] true but it takes God to interpret and
[48:56] tell us what is and when God interprets
[48:59] it and vindicates it and gives it to us
[49:02] it is our absolute I'll Stand Here
[49:04] Without Shame before you this end time
[49:07] message that your pastor preaches is the
[49:09] absolute to this age it is Jesus Christ
[49:13] revealed again in Holy Spirit form in
[49:16] Bride form amen and God was saying men
[49:19] have spoken up now I'll come down and
[49:22] speak Let It Be Your
[49:25] absolute let TI your soul upon have
[49:29] complete confidence in because it will
[49:32] change your body at the day of the
[49:34] Resurrection it'll raise the dead those
[49:36] that had confidence in the word
[49:39] throughout the ages it'll raise them
[49:41] from the grave at the day of the
[49:42] Resurrection I'm so confident that this
[49:45] word is sent from God I know that it'll
[49:48] put you into a in in an immortal body
[49:51] it'll put you in a glorified condition
[49:53] and you'll escape the wrath to God if I
[49:56] did believe that I wouldn't preach it to
[49:58] my church I wouldn't preach it to my
[50:00] family I wouldn't do it myself but I
[50:03] brother man said we must be convinced we
[50:06] must be concerned and once we're
[50:09] concerned and convinced we can hang our
[50:11] entire life on and we can stand there
[50:14] and wait and know with assurance that
[50:16] though in the darkest hour and it may
[50:18] get very dark in the darkest hour no
[50:21] matter what comes if we can't pay our
[50:23] bills if they shut our churches down if
[50:26] they kick us out of our houses we can
[50:29] stand there just like Moses and said I
[50:31] have fulfilled his
[50:33] word he can't fail he will be here amen
[50:37] I'll give you word because thou H has
[50:40] kept the word of my patience I will keep
[50:42] thee in the hour of Temptation that
[50:44] shall come upon the whole world to try
[50:46] them that's God's word keep this word
[50:51] live this word amen don't take any of it
[50:53] lightly it's Holiness it's standards
[50:57] applying the token you follow it to the
[50:59] letter they said brother brandom they
[51:02] said will people do Miracles he said
[51:04] Moses has done the Miracles he said the
[51:06] other people followed that's what he
[51:08] said we believe in the Miracles we've
[51:10] seen too many not to but what I'm saying
[51:12] is this Faithfully follow the messenger
[51:16] as you believe that he's the messenger
[51:18] of Christ isn't that wonderful and so I
[51:21] don't want I don't want to be
[51:23] misunderstood when when because some
[51:25] people will say oh the Bible is my
[51:28] absolute not the message they don't know
[51:29] what they're saying because this message
[51:32] is the Bible we wouldn't be following it
[51:34] we wouldn't follow one bit of
[51:36] it but it's the word manifested for this
[51:39] day therefore it's our absolute amen God
