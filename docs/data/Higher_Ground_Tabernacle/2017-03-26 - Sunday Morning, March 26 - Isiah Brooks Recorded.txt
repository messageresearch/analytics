turn to uh numbers 14 we're going to read numbers 14 uh beginning at the 133 through the 19th verses and um everybody there amen and Moses said unto the Lord then the Egyptians shall hear it for thou broughtest us this people in thy might from among them and and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land for they have heard that the Lord art among his people that thou Lord art seen face to face and that thy Cloud standeth over them and that thou goeth before them by day in a pillar of cloud and in a pillar of Fire by night now if Thou shalt kill all the people as one man then the Nations which have heard the fame of these will speak saying because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the land which he swear unto them therefore he had slain them in the wilderness and now I beseech thee let the power of my Lord be greater be great according according according as thou Hast spoken saying the Lord is longsuffering and of great Mercy forgiving iniquity and transgressions and by no means clearing the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation pardon I beseech Thee the iniquity of this people according unto the the greatness of thy mercy and as thou has forgiven this people from Egypt even unto now am turn with me to Luke please first chapter we'll begin reading at the 76th verse 76- 79 Luke 1 and thou child shall be called the prophet of the highest but thou shall go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways to give knowledge of Salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins Through The Tender Mercies of our God whereby the day spring from on high have visited us to give light to them that sat in darkness and in the shadow of death to give our to guide our feet into the way of Peace amen one more scripture Revelations 22 and4 Revelations 22 and 4 you there and they shall see face and his name shall be in their foreheads father we come before you Lord as humbly as we know how and we thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord we thank you for being so good to us for allowing us to have a wonderful day a day that you have you've ordained to be so and I thank you Father for ordaining us to be here for father we have come for a purpose and that purpose is to reflect you to make the world know that you are God and that you the same yesterday today and forever bless your people this morning forgive us of our sin cleanse us from all our righteousness and unrighteous unrighteousness and we pray father that you would give us Grace Lord to move completely out of your way that you would have preeminence here this morning in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen you love the Lord you may be [Music] seated surely I think about the goodness of the Lord Jesus and I'm always thinking about how unworthy I am to stand before you all it is only by the grace of God I think about how this is such an evil age and I was listening to that this morning and a little bit last night and and brother brandham goes on to say say how this age is so deceitful he said out of all of the ages the Christian ought to be on her on on their toes because Satan is so smooth he knows how to deceive he's very good at it if there's such a thing but the point is that he is profession professional at what he does we know that that the devil is nothing to play with the Bible call him wiser than Daniel and we realize Amen in this age there are going to be a many Christians who missed the Rapture because they thought they were Christians and that is the job of the enemy to make people believe that they're Christians uh when they're not amen this is the age of worship worship man worship images wor worship of themselves the Bible said they will be lovers of themselves and more lovers of pleasure than lovers of God Amen so we find out that Satan has achieved basically most of the things that he sought out to achieve and y'all remember when uh brother long was here I I believe in this uh message here he talked about how Satan still believed that he's going to outsmart God I mean he really believes that he's going to outsmart God regardless to what the word say he is a god of science so we believe that Satan thinks by way of science he's going to achieve his goal and become god well in this age we know that Satan is God over this world y'all understand me the Bible tells us and our Prophet says that Satan is the God of this evil age we want to say that we uh by God's grace need to always take inventory Satan is here to deceive you but don't allow yourself to deceive yourself right call black black and call white white amen uh uh don't settle for H lukewarm life the Bible said that we ought to be hot or cold I want to entitle this message beholding his face and you know I I thought about how brother Chris brought some thoughts and I was just so excited because I sat there and I thought about how that everybody is uh uh uh how would I say attacking uh the face of the Lord and when God came down his seven angels and and and and and and brother bradam uh told us after the picture was taken God told him to turn the picture to the right and by doing so we saw you know the face of what we call the hofman head it looks so much like that and um brother bam said that was his Lord and it is not only his Lord but it's your Lord it is truly a great manifestation of what we call the son of man now I wanted to go back by God's grace to the second Exodus which was there in in in in in in in in E uh Egypt uh we in Genesis how God Called Moses and see Moses is a a very important Prophet uh he he is to the Gentiles as well as to the Jews mainly to the Jews because he was a Jewish Prophet but they were in bondage and Moses was chosen by God and and you know the Bible doesn't tell us much about his parents but basically give us names on who they were and we find out that Moses the Bible said that he had chose to suffer uh uh with the children of Affliction than to be called Pharaoh's daughter I I feel the same way uh because I had rather be in a little place like this then to be in h a mega church uh like Egypt and be lost now God had dealt with Israel in such a Mighty way Moses was one of the first to talk with God face to face I know that Adam and Eve saw him and they talked to him but since the fall Moses was one of the first uh to talk with God now Enoch you know he seen him cuz the Bible said he walked with God and so Moses the Bible stresses that Moses talked with God face to face amen that means Moses was here and God was here right amen and so when I thought about that I thought about how important this was because or this is you see because even in the holies of holies the cherubims are not looking in the opposite direction but they are both beholding the glory of God face to face they are those who are watching over the uh uh uh laws and the grace of God The Mercy Seat all of that and these cherubims are looking face to face when I thought about that I thought about Paul who was the uh First Church message Angel and he was a prophet and I thought about William bradam who was a a a prophet of our day and uh how could I say it Paul looked toward William brandham and William brandham looked toward Paul and both of these angels or Messengers were set in place to God the mercy SE hallelujah hallelujah even so Paul said except if an angel and I wonder why he used that word Angel see if an angel come and preach something other than what I have preached he said let it be a curse and then William bradam comes along and said except an angel preach what Paul preached because I have preached what Paul preached amen let him be a curse amen so you see it's like they are alpha and omega now we realize amen that Jesus Christ is Alpha and Omega but in order for God to to to do something he's a spirit the Bible said no man have seen him at any time so what God does is that he enails uh he he veils himself Amen in something that mankind can see him amen hallelujah because you and I have never seen Holiness Hallelujah but there is a reflection of Holiness that comes by through Us by him so we realize amen that Moses came down out of the mountain having seen God face to face so much so his whole face was illuminated is that right Hebrews said that God that Moses veiled himself thank God because if Moses had not veiled himself where would we be had the people seen God hallelujah but the glory of God was so upon Moses that Moses veiled himself and what did it do it veiled Israel they saw Moses but they didn't see God y'all hear what I'm saying oh it was availing because it was the law but his grace is an unveiling this is why the prophet of God preached a message the unveiling of God because now it is Grace come on somebody remember Moses wanted to see God he had seen all kinds of Miracles he saw the Red Sea open he saw God curs Egypt he saw the pledge fall but Moses says Lord I've seen all of your acts but Lord I want to see you y'all hear what I'm saying Moses had talked to him and everything else but Moses wanted to see God listen every bride member wants to see God we have seen healing we have seen deliverances we have seen all his acts but we want to see God Amen God said to Moses no man have seen my face and live and I often wondered because remember now God is a god of immor he changes his mask right but now because you got to realize that when Moses went down to Egypt Moses became the face of God right yeah he sure did Moses became the face of God but Moses wasn't interested in his face he was interested in God's face Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying because remember amen God told Moses when you go down to Egypt I'm going to you will become as God unto the Egyptian Hallelujah not that Moses uh uh physically became God he wasn't working with his physical he was working with the spiritual aspect of Moses and Moses God would have never said that to Moses except that God knew that he had a plan to step into Moses Hallelujah because remember Moses was a man with God it wasn't God who broke the word it was Moses who smoked the rock twice amen but all the other times God walked with Moses but the day has come hallu God said I won't no no longer just be with you I will be in you amen wo come on somebody so we realize amen Moses saw what God said okay Moses I'm G let you see my glory I'm G let you see some of it but not all of it right you represents the Law right this back of ours is the only thing that has no protection if a man want to kill you he goes for the part that you can't where you can't see You're vulnerable in your back hello and and basically that represents law because I'm going tell you something law brings death so God showed Moses that part of him there was no freedom in the law there was no life in the law and every man that had the Lord died amen only the elect came out of thatall and it was only God could give the elect Grace yes sir amen y'all hear what I'm saying but everything else I don't care if they were born of this tribe and born of that tribe and born listen they all failed to complete the law and the Bible said by one breaking one word you're guilty of them all so even though Paul bragged and he said he goes on and he says listen I'm blameless only by Grace Paul y'all hear what I'm saying he said I've done all the laws right and what God says your works is as filthy rags amen but he was being he was down on the level of those who who was accusing him and blaming him so Paul condescended and said listen I'm speaking foolishly huh and I'm I'm telling you something I'm speaking foolishly but if you want to go there I'll go there with you I'm a Pharisee of all Pharisees oh come on somebody I studed under gah I am blameless nothing in my bloodline defiles me they have kept every order but if Paul had not met Jesus amen come on somebody he would have been lost he would have been all right but when Jesus came it changed from law unto Grace cuz no man can be justified by the law see remember God did a great work with Moses and Moses was a shadow and a type of what God was going to do because this is the Third Exodus in this Exodus we realize amen that this Pharaoh that's over the world is worse than the pharaoh of Egypt because everybody knew who Pharaoh was but in this age people do not know who the real slave master is it's Satan sir oh Lord impersonating himself as an angel of Light think about it on the river of Jordan if they the people would have understood who that was that John introduced them to Hallelujah remember now John had disciples and he constantly preached that the Messiah was coming and he told them that when he does come I will know because the Bible he he said I've had a vision let's put it this way I've seen the dove of God laying upon Him Hallelujah and the Bible said when Jesus came to the river of Jordan oh John said oh my God you would come to be baptized of me I'm not even worthy to unlash your shoes but then Jesus being the word says this must be done because all of the scriptures must be done and the lamb had to be washed yes sir before he could be sacrificed Hallelujah so we realize amen that if they only knew that this face wasn't the first time it ever appeared on Earth I'd say that in just a moment John amen was a a a a a mighty one so much so that Jesus said there have never been a prophet like unto John up until this day but that was that day and some people may not may have disagree with me but there's been a greater than John since then John the Baptist was a covenant Angel and John Elijah is a covenant Angel not only is this Elijah of our day was a covenant Angel but he was the one that God uses to perform the ceremony what ceremony a marriage ceremony he was the one that introduced like Isaac did Rebecca to excuse me that uh uh Ela re introduced Rebecca unto Isaac he was the in between see we would the know Isaac except uh elear came after us come on somebody he came looking for you am you didn't look for this message this message came looking for you beholding his face I wondered like I said why they were attacking the cloud and I've told you my testimony I don't know what my age was but was in the 60s E I remember that and and here was a white man com in my neighborhood with the Life Magazine I was child I didn't KN I knew nothing much about God but this man came and and like I said before he was a white man which the only white man that came in a black neighborhood at that time was the insurance man and the Milkman any other man would get Jack up jack up uh beat up so and everybody knew if it was a thing when a when an insurance man got ready to quit he made sure he brought the man who was going to take his place with him so that you would know this man is taking my place the word would get out y'all understand me so Milkman too I say all of that to say I don't know who this man was one of these old days I know him and I'll be honest with you sometime I wonder was that brother Brandon the reason why I say that and not to glorify myself because he preached in South Carolina Colombia at an Assembly of God Church there could have been somebody inspired all I know is this man was dressed in a black suit white shirt and dark I just know I remember that but my point is we were playing kick football me and some brothers friends and thise this man came and he had the magazine in his hand he said come here boys I want to show you something he said the Lord is soon to come well I was raised Baptist I knew a little something and and and he says listen the Lord is soon to come he said I want to show you and he opened the Light magazine Amen to the cloud he said can't you see his face in the clouds none of the other boys could see it wow amen I said I can see it I see it that man closed the book he said not not one word other than he closed the book and walked away and I never seen that man again and I never seen that magazine again until I came to this messag amen see so I know when they began to attack that and said some kind of science see what I mean science always trying to take the place of God you know I don't care about quantum physics Hallelujah without the word amen quantum physics would not have existed amen so anyway you look at these things and you say oh what are you talking about Brother Bruce I'm saying when when when when when brother Chris began to speak on that picture I began to see things I've never seen before and you know I thought that's right face to face face to face see but if you can't see the face in peace am then you're not part of the picture amen that's what God said to me he said if you I said it again right there he said if you cannot see this picture this face in peace you are not part of the picture Hallelujah and I thought what and then the brother said listen which is true I never saw it like this before he said the Angels were just the outside of the p and I have seen that picture I'mma show it to you right now this picture now and in this picture you can see faet Amen in the makeup of this Frame seven angels oh come on somebody Hallelujah there are faces in this picture and when I I used to see it all the time I said oh I see this I see that oh look at that face look at this face and not realizing that what God was doing is not only just showing you who he is but who he's made up of without us hallelujah amen that's why they can't be made perfect amen we had both eyes we had Paul we had uh H William Bradley amen right amen come on somebody amen the truth of the matter is oh my God thank you brother didn't even know the truth of the matter is every Paul and and and and and William Bram was the only two prophets amen they were seers Hallelujah yes but after the seers go off the scene you go into God's intelligence amen oh my God Amen see see that's why God had to bring us a word to do what renew our minds bring us back into his intelligence and not the intelligence of a man this is why brother Brandon constantly said I am a son of man revealing the son of man now I'm off my notes but I'm going off what what I what God listen so you look and I thought that's right brother brandham I've heard him say I was looking for that quot couldn't remember where it was brother brandham said amen that this one that stood in the midst of the golden candlesticks were likened unto the son of man and he said it was the bride amen well I seen it I remember seeing it years ago I couldn't F figure out where it was then brother Chris show I said oh my god I've been looking for it because you know if you go into the search if you put it just right it just won't come up but when he said Eve was in the image of Adam I did everything but jumped out of my seat cuz now I can see is that right listen the prophet of God says she becomes him it brings us back to one image amen not the image of a woman but the image of a man and now she's in him and that's how come we saw Adam alone amen that's why on Mount Tri Transfiguration you didn't see male and female you saw Jesus only Hallelujah but we were there oh God W help us Lord that's why Paul said my life is hid in Christ Jesus I don't want my life to be seen I wanted to die everything about me Must Die it must R Hallelujah I want to be able to stand like Paul said it's not I that lives but Christ that lives in me I'm on my way up folks not down I'm on my way up and I tell you what I thought that oh this last few days was a battle of oh my God you know and Satan said you know you're not going to win you might as well just give up I'm like give up on what you know the devil he run he talk too much you know I mean he goes along and you're listening almost some somewhat right but he always make the mistake of saying the wrong thing amen and then when he says what he says like that like he told the prophet of God just give up God don't care see what I'm saying when he went there I said you Expos now devil Hallelujah I know this is you glory to God y'all hear what I'm saying because I'm going tell you something in all my suffering in all my trials and all that I've ever gone through he's the only one has ever been there perfectly he was there when I wasn't there y'all understand what I mean so you look at this thing you say well brother Brooks how come listen it was so important that people understood who knowah was because only eight Souls caught the Revelation right and the Bible tells us that Jesus himself after he was crucified went down into the region of the lost and preached to the souls that were in prison in the days of what the anel luian days what was it they missed the son of man they missed God they missed the face of God because they saw Noah's face but it wasn't Noah preaching it was God in Noah preaching and they met miss it that's why they couldn't see Jesus they were looking too much at his face but his face will either Enlighten you or blind you Hallelujah come on somebody and the same face that we have seen in 1963 when God took it and listen brother Brandon said he was looking right at the thief that he pardoned am Hallelujah come on somebody and God comes in that same way and he looks down us that's why Moses said Lord these people you brought out of Egypt don't slay them they're full of mistakes Lord but have mercy on them have mercy otherwise the people going to mock us and say the god that they so-called serve has now killed them all amen is that right that would be the pressure of the foolish virgin y'all say you're Christians and look God done left you the Bible says according to Exodus 33:11 and the Lord spake unto Moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend and he turned again into the camp but his servant Joshua the son of nun a young man departed out out of the Tabernacle Hallelujah W come on somebody now what is it about his face I often know listen character is known by a person's face most of the time you can find some who can deceive you but most of the time you could look at a man you could either tell where he come from where he is and perhaps where he's going you ever seen somebody that's mean you don't even have to talk to them it's just that their face gives them away you look she look mean and nine time out of 10 she is oh it doesn't matter how nice they can be on the surface but when you push or switch that switch and me then you'll see oh I see why she looks like that right it is that character that dominating thing that pushes through some of us got scars but scars do tell where you used to be you can't get rid of it's engraved in your flesh now my point is if God is able to I can I put it this way see God can take all of that and transform it amen so much so that people won't even see your scars they'll see the illumination of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah come on somebody listen he said hide not thy face from me this what psalms 27 says when thou sayth seek my face my heart said unto thee thy face Lord will I seek what was he saying I'm going to seek his character amen Hallelujah come on somebody I'm going to seek his face Hallelujah because Jesus said when you see me you see the father he wasn't talking about this Paul said we no longer know man after the flesh we don't even know Jesus Christ after the flesh we don't know William bradam after the flesh come on somebody it ain't about wearing Bel buckles and cowboy shoes and hats it's character it's what was reflected through him that God was reflecting to us amen that we might see Hallelujah is that true amen oh absolutely remember amen the Bible tells us that in the day I think it was Nebuchadnezzar who built the image belzar Nebuchadnezzar whichever one it was but they were they were Phar Kings or pharaohs or whatever you call them but my point is they built an image to Daniel Amen how would we have known that image was the image of a prophet and that Prophet was Daniel the man thought so much of Daniel he thought Daniel was God and he wanted the people to worship the image of Daniel and Daniel himself would not bow Hallelujah the same pressure that we get from message people that wants us to bow down to the enies of William Bram amen because they think he's God but it's not the image that we're looking at amen we are seeing a image that God has brought through the man amen oh come on somebody he's taking us higher Lord don't worry about your false folks listen not one of us can make ourselves perfect you can't make yourself bride bride has already been chosen and if you believe that you're bride you completely you keep believing that and you keep believing like Abraham I don't care how bad it looks to me in my life he promised me Perfection he promised me a son and I'm going to have that son conditions in your life right now means nothing it is the promise that God has given unto us that we must look at amen the devil will get you looking at how bad a condition you're in and you can't make it he's a liar from the beginning how you can't make it when you're already there you ought to say yeah devil but you can't make it he trying to tell you what you can't do right so you say well what do you mean this is what was so beautiful nobody know before we just start oh in a twinkling of an eye we going to be caught up to meet him that's all oh I'm a Christian and so I confess the Lord and no matter what I'm going to be caught up to meet him and we forget that the scripture said the Bride made herself ready Hallelujah come on somebody that is a process and that process we know because God showed his face thank you Lord and gave us instructions and entrance into what his divine nature amen I got to go back there because without the divine nature you go nowhere amen am it's his divine nature look what brother R says he says see the picture the other day how he turned that picture sideways there let me tell you something this Bible is not a history book even though history is in it it's not all history it's not something of the past people say oh I want to live in the Bible days you are in the Bible days I want to tell you where you are you are in the Book of Revelations y'all hear me oh with the Book of Revelation yes because remember brother bandam said after the seventh angel message sound he said immediately the Rapture take place and I was saying that to my wife I said how long is immediately God knows we've spent a lot of time in that word so we're closer to it yes sir than we ever have been this is why God preaching what he preaching these are not my thoughts these are his thoughts God is looking for character he's looking for somebody amen who's willing to press through all of this stuff amen but how you going to do it if you don't identify the devil if you don't know the devil you and I know everything about what we need to know about the devil cuz he runs the same scheme on us every time he doesn't come a second way another way he runs the same tactics and we need to start writing down how how he works with us and gets us to a place of Temptation or gets us to a place of falling amen he ain't GNA change his ways he knows how to do it and one of the first thing he does is make you feel alone lonelyness Hallelujah he caught Eve alone and that's how he catches you and us when we feel alone that's why Jesus said you're never alone I'm always with you yes Lord so it got to be the devil that makes us feel that way amen huh and that's his look if you listen all of a sudden you're end up fellowshipping with the wrong Shepherd y amen y'all hear what I'm saying now let me move on he says listen see the picture the other day how it turned that picture sideways there and the Very picture of the Seven Angels being lifted up tur it on to the right side and there is the face of the Lord Jesus looking down to the Earth again who was the face of Jesus you said brother Brooks I told you earlier I said that face had been seen before and I ain't going to read all of it but I'm going tell you something that face had to be the same face that MDC had he was made after the order of MDC if I had a tith detergent in a certain box with a certain label and I made one after the order of that it would be the same tied box with the same writing with the same everything you say that can't be true well I'll tell you what Ezekiel said after the the Bible the Bible tells us that Jesus sended into the low region right and there he said he led captivity captive is that right now we realize one thingl is that when he descended and brother brandham D dramatizing he knocked on the door of paradise Abraham comes and he looks through the people he said that's the one amen come on somebody he was able to recognize his face he said that's the one I seen Amen in the cool of the that's the one amen Ezekiel said oh my God that's the one I see he was the will in the middle of the wh see they identified who he was Lord hello J said that's the one I see when I was on the a he oh Lord you see what I'm saying so when Jesus was made Jesus he took on the order of mzc even though the body itself wasn't mzc his life his eternal life he was born with being God amen now many of us may may not be able to see it but all I know is that we are in the face of God amen amen hallelujah it's amazing because it doesn't matter on how he cloaks himself he cloaked himself and here he was God of imorph going down to a woman at the well amen see the seed of God will always recognize him no matter what he looks like she said we know when the Messiah come he's going to tell us these things amen and then when he said I am he listen it was one of the few times Jesus told his the person whom he was talking with I am he amen and she ran to the city and said come see a man who told me everything that I know all about me what was it she didn't see the a man dirty with dirty clothes on and she didn't see a man perhaps look worn out she saw Behind the B amen she recognized this got to be God Amen y'all hear what I'm saying what is it beholding him face to face you got to go beyond the veil of William Bram and see who was behind that then you'll have respect for the word you'll have respect for the message sir because you'll understand the message wasn't brought by a man it was brought by God Amen Hallelujah he said listen oh he said them Church agents he said I can understand why Jesus standing there with he said I couldn't understand while Jesus was there amen with a white white uh over his head and he was a young man I I look took it back to the Bible see what was it God impersonating himself or put it this I I get there when I get there you said well no God doesn't yes he does he impersonate himself through you thank you Lord remember brother BR talk about the drama and how God acts things out he does and he act himself out through US amen I got a quote for that too see he goes on and he says listen standing Jesus standing there with a white over his head he was a young man I took it back in the Bible and it says he came to the Ancient of Days whose hair was white as wo Jesus was only 33 and a half years old at his crucifix so he had to act out or impersonate the judge who he really was amen hallelujah that sounded all right for Theologian see wait wait wait wait wait let me go back up he said Ancient of Days whose hair was white as will Jesus was only 33 and a half years old at his crucifixion I called up brother dck Moore Theologian he said oh brother Brandon that's Jesus in his glorified stage said after his death burial and Resurrection he turned to that that sounded all right for a theologian but it didn't go good it didn't hit that something and I went up there and I started on the first church age there the Holy Spirit revealed it now you got it right on your church agents I guess the books will be out pretty soon now uh uh the full details of it and it shows that Jesus was judged there's a white wig that they used to wear put a wig on and wear it as a Jud England still does it when you got supreme authority come on somebody what was it that's why the scripture said he was the only potent C it wasn't brother Brandon's face with a a wig on it it was the hin head it was Christ and right now people are now trying to say he all counter colors now who cares about what color he is he'd be porked and striped to me I don't care I still want to see him and then look at his face a million and more years just look at him oh Jesus which was the listen let me go on see there he is with them Angels the message which was the SE seven breaking of them Seven Seals that reveal serpent seed and all these things and it showed that it is H his very covering the seven angels was his very covering hallelujah oh my God it's supreme authority he is supreme and he is wigged or covered the Bible said that he changed his countenance or he changed himself in morphe the word comes from the word Greek word IM Mor which means a Greek Act that plays many parts today he is one thing and in the next ACT he is something else he was God the father and in one act God the son in another act then God the Holy Ghost in This act see there he is his word is still Supreme and he's living in the last days hallelujah Ecclesiastes 8 And1 says who is as a wise man and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing a man's Wisdom maketh his face to shine and boldness of his face shall be chained what you say Moses the wisdom of God overtook Moses so much his face did Shine and when God's wisdom takes you over there is a glorious shine about you now you don't see many Christians with that kind of shine anymore but there are those who do have it Hallelujah listen Psalms 34 is this okay Psalm 34:1 16-19 says the face of the Lord is against them that do evil to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth is that right he was looking at the thief that he was going to Pardon but the one that he wasn't going to Pardon he didn't look that way amen hallelujah so God's facei is against those who do evil the righteous God that's why people don't understand it they attack the cloud not understanding the face of God and because of that amen God will turn his face from them the Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and save such as be of a right Spirit many are the Affliction of the righteous but the Lord delivered him out of them all Hallelujah beholding his faith you so brother was what I'm going to do I don't understand how people go back to these other churches I just don't I don't what the highest form of truth right now outside of this message is the Pentecostal move and look look where they are now IAB bar all over the place and you know what if the people in this message are not careful that same thing is going to be written over them too see because everything that came out of Egypt was not Israel amen amen amen and everything that come out of denominations praise God is Not bride amen help us Lord woo you got to have a spirit like uh Joshua and Caleb Hallelujah you didn't see Moses the man you saw God behind the ve and brother brandham said this butt ain't no butts it is the prophet of God that interprets God or God interprets his word through the prophet amen Amen brother B say you don't even have a thought coming first Corin Ians 13: 8-13 listen charity never fails but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish come on somebody we've seen it we've seen the watch of the holy spirit amen among people but they had no charity for we know in part we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is part shall be done away listen God allowed us to get away with part of it but that which is perfect has come which God has now delivered to us through the prophet of God he's looking for a perfect man Hallelujah am I making sense Peter said amen if we do all of these things we shall never fall nor be un baren so the Perfection of of of what God is looking for is not your own abilities it's God in you amen which is a hope of glory oh so many people around this message amen what they don't understand the prophet God said listen the devil can get you off on just the least little thing he got you because remember it was people who not only identified brother brandom as a prophet but they went on to worship him where you think they're going brother brandom said when you worship me you make me Antichrist amen hallelujah so it doesn't make see the devil don't care it's just one little one little Mis mishap amen that's all it takes one and people don't understand they well brother BRS what what are you what are you preaching I'm not trying to tell you that you got to take this picture and hang hanging up on your wall for safety yall understand me there's no power in this this is a reflection of him oh Hallelujah you don't want this reflection you want him amen amen yeah some people think I made a a messy sin because I don't have it hanging up I will in due time but I'm sure not going to put it up because somebody else want me to put it up y'all understand me they do that but he ain't got the cloud where's the cloud I got him he's in me people come in I tell you what it's just the way people are taught they think something really spiritual about it you know what I mean St you I'll be you be people probably bowing down just like they did to the serpent on the pole [Music] y'all hear what I'm saying Paul warned us about those kind of things folks that's what I love brother Brandon for he was not so super spiritual that he didn't act act like a man or be a man amen that's what's so beautiful about this message brother Brandon went fishing he went hunting he laughed he joked he carried on just like men do amen he didn't ride where no wife robe a man like the Catholic priest like you got to bow down and kiss my hand no he was just a man who God used not only that guess what he made mistakes amen hello and you know what he didn't hide it he put it on record so you can see he was a man yes sir oh help us Lord Paul said when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish thing yes watch children play they play one moment they mad one moment they lie on each other they cheat on each other they do all kind of stuff why they're children but when you grow up those things that were things that you did as a child must move out way amen what what you think Paul talking about he's not talking about growing up amen naturally he's working with a spiritual application yes sir amen right for we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face Hallelujah face to face face to face how many people you know have this face you understand what I'm saying because we know what this face ISU we're not oh Lord have mercy I don't you know I look at people and I think what's wrong with folks am I crazy am I the only one that's seeing it the way I see it that's why I was so glad when Chris Long came and he began to minister I'm like oh there it is that's exactly how I see it and it began to break other things open to us so many of us are so afraid you don't have to be afraid you know if I was born a cow cow or calf or whatever I never have to be afraid of being big one one day you know it's in the jeans it's going to mature me you ain't maturing yourself God's maturing you the footstep of a righteous man are ordered by the Lord and don't you know the Bible said the Lord knoweth them that are his when you are in darkness God knew that was you everything you've gone through God ordained it ah you don't like it he didn't say you had to like it amen but everything you've gone through has been for your benefit because you want to make Heaven amen yes Lord and God knows what it takes sometime we depend on too much other stuff and God won't Total Lean on him lean not to your own understanding but acknowledge the Lord in all your ways and he will Direct your path we see through a glass Darkly how can you IM you know what I'm saying brother B said that little fellow had never seen a mirror before and he was up there up the stairs and his mom and Mom and them downstairs and he walked up the stairs and he saw the mirror and he goes and the mirror way back he started smiling the mirror smile all of a sudden he said oh Mama that that's me you think he was just telling you a story there was a parable behind that folks he was trying to tell you that when you look into the mirror of the word you will find your identity hallelujah it's the word that identifies you I'm going beyond my time this morning listen let me finish this and then just this scripture here and we'll pick up this evening but now see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as I am so God had to make you know who you were and who you are before the foundation of the world he had to tie you back into him and show you your face Hallelujah yes sir amen he had to come and show you who you are where you came from where are you going hallelujah amen not because sin is not who you are this is not who you are it's the inner man who you are hallelujah hallelujah and you must understand am me it to it takes the word because sin broke it took away brother I'm said it's struck us and we gain amnesia for 6,000 more years men have had amnesia and even coming through all the law they look through the glass Darkly Darkly Darkly Darkly amen then Grace came and brought Perfection hallelujah amen hallelujah Abraham seed think about it and now about his faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity and we are the age that God has chosen to Crown with charity and you can never know you've got charity until you suffer because if you got Divine love you gonna suffer am oh me s yes Divine love came by way of Jesus Christ and he did what suffer amen but the Bible said the many many are the afflictions of the righteous but God delivered them out of all of them you love the Lord well by God's grace we'll start with part whatever this is four or five whatever but we'll start this evening uh uh basically kind of working a little bit with the son of man and and and what God is doing in us right you need to know what see if you don't have a picture or you know it's one thing I know about people who build buildings they have Blueprints and by that blueprint that man can see exactly what he's working with right right and normally amen he can read those plans and constructed exactly the way it is there now of course the building is bigger than the blueprint but without the blueprint there would be no building right so what did God do he brought a man uh filled with the spirit of Elijah which was the spirit of God the Holy Ghost and laid out the blueprints of God Amen concerning you yes how to build a perfect man amen amen hallelujah glory to God Amen that's where we are amen so your trials are not in vain your test is not in vain amen the Bible said in your p po patience possess e your soul so what do you do you wait you stand still you don't move until God moves no matter what you're going through he's still God Amen and if you could just wait till he comes you'll be okay cuz he'll fix everything that's wrong amen you Lord you love the Lord amen hallelujah let me see if it's in here got a song that came to me lily of the valley let me find it feel my
