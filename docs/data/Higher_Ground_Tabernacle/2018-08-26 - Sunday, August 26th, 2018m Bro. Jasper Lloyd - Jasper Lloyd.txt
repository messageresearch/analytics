Bibles if you mind if you don't mind and let's get right into word into the word amen amen so I brother said remember our sister Brooks and all the children and my little flock back home we bring you loving greetings from there and they're sick this morning all of them I've got a philip and Timothy and little Abigail sneezing and coughing and even trying to get get over it so y'all if you don't mind lift the prayer as a family man as we try to do what God has called us to do amen second samuel is where we want to read our scripture this morning and Sam you chapter 23 so if we want to read

wins tonight so I know it it it pulls easy here amen and so you all just pull and say Amen and I'm a short winded preacher but I like when I hit the devil to make sure I hit him odd good amen amen we don't want to go 12 rounds we just wanted to be knocked out a man in first couple of rounds amen second samuel chapter 23 and we'll just read let's just read verse 13 through 17 so that you all can be seated amen if you have its amen amen and three of the thirty chief went down and came to david in the harvest time unto the cave of a deulim and the truth of the philistines pitched in the valour of griffin him and david was then in a hole and the garrisons of the philistines was then in bethlehem and david longed and said old that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem which is by the gate he men and the three mighty men break through the host of the Philistines drew out the well from the will of Bethlehem that was by the gate and took it brought it to David nevertheless he would not drink thereof but poured it out unto the Lord and he said be it far from me O Lord that I should do this it's not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives therefore he would not drink it these things did these three mighty men let's borrow his father we thank you this morning o God for allowing us just to be able to enter into your house father we thank you just for the thought this morning that we could get up and arise O God and as David said I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord we are glad this morning to be here under your presence Lord we feel you're 19 we feel your presence in this place your God moved me out of the way I'm just oh god a little clay but thou art the Potter mold me O God move my lips o god and father may your word be spoken to your children father may you O God answer the desires of their heart father me your word go forth o God in power in spirits and in demonstration one word from you O God will make all the difference bless us O God as we sit under the light as we sit under your word Lord that our hearts would burn within us to know what you want to say this morning o God we give you praise Lord we give you the glory may all things that's done O God part to you O God to the divine Savior Lord me everything done point to you that everyone here under the sound of my voice will lift up their hearts will lift up their hands and give you praise that it would give them faith O God O Lord God bless us this morning in Jesus name we pray amen amen you may be seated hallelujah amen I want to use for just a topic this morning give the King what he desires a man give the King what he desires and just a background this text before we give the main text of what we want to share I like to look at the three characters in the story that surrounds David during this time and I just thank God that when we leave and go home then we're not going home sad amen I don't know about you but all that God has done I'm not about to leave here with my head hanging down how many got the victory Amen and what God has done for us amen it doesn't take much you know you don't have to beat and scrap and cry and do all of that just remember what Jesus have done for us the victory that you have in Christ Jesus amen you realize how much power you have against anything that comes against you amen and you know I just want to look at these particular characters and I hold that protect perhaps before we get into the text here and I believe we do that we have these kind of people here amen not the boys me and I can't make it and I don't know what I'm gonna do amen you need a revelation if that's your thoughts amen so but just as a way of encouraging you I'm thankful that God surrounded David with some money man amen and you know if you're gonna go to war don't need and taking anybody thinking you're gonna lose just leave them home but how many know that we already have the victory I feel like preaching already but I just want to get into the text here in the Bible says and with just background and just verse 8 if you look a man one of the mighty men that the Bible gives a caption to his name was Ladino the Bible says in verse 8 that he lifted off his spear against eight hundred whom he slew at one time Amen now I know that that just looks like that's pretty hard to do sweat slaying 800 but how many know the Bible says that one can chase a thousand how many you believe that amen so a man that's and in the Bible you know and the Hebrew translation of the his name adeno means heart amen hard and solid that's what God wants he wants you to have a hard mindset a rock-solid mindset made up your mind you convinced your concern amen the Bible says that Jesus said his face like a flint he said I must do the work that the father given me work while his day for night come no man can work Amen in a sense we can say that Jesus was hard-headed Amen even the church was hard hit him many times they would take the church and persecute him and beat him and whip him and tell him don't speak in his name Amen don't talk in his name and they would take the beaten take the weapons go right out the door and bring the name of Jesus amen hallelujah so amen the church has to be hard-headed in a sense Amen no matter what they say man I'm gonna stay with the word no matter what they say to me I'm gonna believe the word how many believe the words hallelujah amen all right and then this next character in verse 9 I've caused him Aliza the son of dode old aho Heights one of the three mighty men of David the Bible says of him when they defied the Philistines they were gathered together to battle and the men of Israel were gone away but you know the word Aliza means God has helped how many you believe that God has helped amen the Bible's that now I know I said God has helped there's a different not God is going to help you this morning God has helped amen by His stripes we were healed by what Jesus done on the cross you are already healed not I'm going to be delivered I have been delivered whatever it is that I want God to do he's already done it he's waiting for my faith to catch up to what he's already done hallelujah amen y'all ought to give God praise come on put your hands together give God praise yes Amen I'm not gonna be that long but I just I just want you to catch these a little day sometimes people oh I want God to do something if you can just recognize he's already done it oh my all right Ellie's a God has helped a man not it's a good thing to know that you can't do it alone no you can't do it alone we cannot do it with alone you know you can't even live this word alone you can't live this word by the letter Amen because a letter killed but the Spirit will pick up that word and bring it to life amen amen God has helped now remember that these are the men that God surrounded David with God has given you help already there's something there's somebody even there's somebody around you don't believe amen this one doesn't believe but don't worry there's somebody that will believe if that word goes on good ground it'll bring forth Amen God will not be without a witness he'll have someone that'll have faith it might be short and small and not with big muscles Amen but they got faith hey man God has helped God has helped amen all right he rolls and smote the Philistines until his hands were weary amen and and but his hands clayvin to the sward I like that hey man yeah you're not the only one tired I'm tired too oh oh brother I'm so tired and I'm so weary amen we all get weary sometimes everybody get a little tired I I don't want to deal with this and I don't want to and the people are so mean that's all right we all get weary but keep your hands on the squad amen I get tired just like you I get weary amen I feel like people won't believe all is preaching you're doing amen 27 years of preaching the gospel but I cannot put that slaw down amen if they don't believe I'll keep that squad until God come by and do something because God is faithful do you believe that God is faithful yes he is he arose amen amen even though he was wearing kept the Swart Amen I want to say to you don't give up don't give up why do people give up so soon amen is you must never give up you want a good great peak striving till you get a good grade don't say well it wasn't for me is for someone else no it's for you hallelujah yes don't give up don't give up may be long it may be a hard battle it may test every fiber in your body it may seems like everybody else is getting their blessing and you're not getting yours but just stay right down oh my god don't give up Amen people give up don't write people off either don't write people off you witness to someone seems too old they don't get it and before you know it four or five people think all nobody's getting it their name now everybody thinks all know about is getting it and for you know what that spirit get on the whole church and everybody think nobody can be saved but God still can save God still can deliver and God can still open up the ears and make the deaf man hear how many believe that say men hallelujah yeah don't give up don't give up and that's what God wants to know don't get in that don't get under that spiritual hole well these people are gonna die big episode blind and nobody can say I think God I can see know if they're blind you got to get in the shoes and become blind with them oh yes no oh no but I can't be blind I can see no if they're blind amen they can't see I'll tell you become blind like on me you can't help anyone until you can get the same shoe size look like them like them become a part of them feel their infirmities and then God will transfer the Spirit of God into that body hallelujah oh my I hope I hope we're not too loud here they might run us out of here but I get stirred up when I think of how powerful God's Word is a man do you love him amen we not gonna be long here but that let's just go just to another carrots these three characters in this last one I want to look at in verse 11 and after him was Shama so you had a dino who was hot amen and you had le Eleazar who God has helped and now we have Shama many times people only get a revelation of half of his name sham yep y'all know what a sham is let me know what a sham is bogus and sometimes people get half the word and they think this is a sham this is bogus it doesn't work and that's what Chama name means in the natural it means astonishment loss and sometimes the devil will hit you so hard you think I've lost everything but in the spiritual Shama has a different meaning in the spiritual Shama means the Lord is dead so just when you think you lost it just when you think he's not there he's actually there oh I love a man it seems like God isn't there Amen but just remember he's jehova shamma I will always be with my bride I will always be I will never leave you nor forsake you and I like both of those I mean I you know sometimes people can leave you and forsake you but I'm glad that he won't leave me and nor will he forsake me and that that means a hope you know it means something when people won't forsake that means God says I'm always identify with you I'm not gonna stand over here and say oh I don't know who I don't know who that is no he's gonna identify that's my brother I'm not gonna leave you and neither will I forsake you I'm going to be identified with you how many believe God is present not atmosphere is a little bit higher here and it feels how many feel good in here this morning Amen can we turn a corner and we bought done it everybody all right can we go a little farther Amen I want to just break into this little piece of the right now I'm just getting to the text but this is where I want to get to and I hope God has someone I believe you do I don't believe he would send me this far hey man I can feel the faith in here amen but I want now this say Lord open my eyes now let's peel into this little verse here just for a moment to see what God was sending us a little short ball hitting me and always father say to you the Bible says here amen in verse 14 David was in a hold and the garrisons of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem and that is a kind of sad situation here David's in a cave and the Philistines over in Phil's in Bethlehem that shouldn't be are you with me and the Bible says that David long how many are longing David long to Bob say he'd long he said oh that one would give me a drink now I'm sure badwater just think now their water they were in a cave but David wanted a certain kind of drink alright you know maybe somebody would come hand him a soda I'll take a soda but the Bible says he long from a drink from the well of Bethlehem it was a different type of dream coming to know what I'm talking about yes it was a clear crystal springing a man drink that you had to get from way down in a will so now we have a conflict here what David is warning they could not supply where he was God had positioned his servant in a hole we couldn't get out and then he made him thirsty for something that will fill his quickened thirsts until he said oh I long for a drink I don't know about you but I'm longing for a drink I can't drink anything and if they won't feel me and I'm tired of drinking soda pop soda pop soda pop suddenly after Sunday's soda pop soda pop soda bomb you know people are satisfied with soda pop how many no there's nothing like a good old fresh good old fresh drink from water from the well of Bethlehem was they're hungry said I must have that drink can you imagine look who are we talking about here now everybody think women don't everybody put on your thinking cap think about we're talking about David how many know David you know David you know King David you know the warrior you know he was a fighter how many know he was a fighter how many know he could fight listen are we talking about these three mighty men but you know how many know they wasn't comparing to david we're talking about the little guy that for a bear amen we talked about a little short guy at the back come up and hug him but david had enough law that his bear hug was bigger than the Bears back home amen we talked about Amanda Amen slew a lion amen and what the Bible says he took his mouth and open it up you realize how much power it takes to do that you allow so much character it takes to do that when you're not paying attention and the people all shouting and all getting carried on and you mess around and you pull too hard and you rip the sheep but I believe it took power and character to a man to pull that lion's mouth open delicately strong powerful but humble and character not to do something so somebody else can see it but to do something to save the life of the sheep when nobody else is looking and to pull it up delica lee strong but humble and pull the sheep out tap the little blood mark there and throw him on his shoulder and go on back to the flock and I love that's how Jesus did for us he didn't just rip us I know he ripped the devil and pull us out gentle in and heal those scars and those bruises and all those temptations and trials and listen I'm so thankful for the blood I got to go here just a moment but how many thank God for the blood listen to blood not only cleanses you but it purifies your mind amen and the blood is sprinkle on your conscience so you don't walk around feeling guilty about the evil you done not only does he save your soul but he purifies your conscience I'm not a sinner I never was a sinner I actually what a mean I before I came here I was somewhere else a man how you thank God for the great Shepherd delicately pulling you out of the enemies sometimes people don't you know you got to go deeper it's more than the blood the blood purifies your conscience from dead works to serve the Living God listen you can't serve God without a peel conscience you can't serve God did the devil counsel remind you all you know what you did last year you know what you did last week you know what you did last night don't you know but the blood of Jesus sprinkles your conscience when I confess my sins he is just to forgive me of my that's the scripture but the other part of us say he cleanses me from them he forgives you but he cleanses what he has to do is not only forgive you but it has to clean your conscience because if your conscience still thinking about it won't be long you be right back but if he purges your conscience when the devil called the old man you don't know what he's talking about hallelujah is somebody ought to give God praise Amen let's give God praise amen let me get back hey man I didn't mean to go all there but the Holy Spirit went there so I had to go where he goes amen but David here Amen desired a drink and here's what I want to leave in your heart and in your spirit how many believe God has spoken already Amen I don't just work the following bad ground which is good graft and feel good grounding too much good grounding a man I feel good solid faith ground here and I want to leave this revelation with you when I Drive home I mean well it's too far to drive but when I fly back home I want to make sure that I said what God told me to say I want submit to you this morning that we all have desires and I'm by finishing will pray whatever you feel you won't got to do so but I want to say this to you young and old you young people the Bible says King David long for a drink the same Holy Ghost that came and struck the word said to this little human body go tell the people that I'm thirsty we are so concerned about what we won't we are so concerned about what we need there's nothing wrong children you've got to live in this world you've got to go to school you got to get a good education you got to get a good job and there's no use working unless you're gonna make all the money make as much money as you won't make as much money as you can get all the house you won't get all the possessions you want how many know what I'm talking about people want things they want oh god I want you to give me a I want a good husband I want a good wife I want good children Lord give me this Lord give me that but I submit to you this morning that is something that God wants a great God the one that you never thought wouldn't need anything the King needed something and God needs something this morning I tell you this morning that Jesus Amen is thirsty is that the word let's look at it just quickly st. John for watch the Bible says ha we've had a great revival let's go get the master some food and get him something to eat amen but the Bible says Jesus was thirsty amen are you with me how many believe Jesus got thirsty you mean God can get thirsty Sri can there it is laying over there the king is thirsty who could wet ever devil and get anything he wanted but I believe he was trying to draw it from somewhere else you can't do it all you you win every battle God want somebody else to get an experience I know you saved I know you a thankful what God has done for you but God want us to get so thirsty until he begins to draw a testimony out of somebody else oh my god there he is sitting there look like he had it all together great revival and What did he say give me a drink what you asking me a for drink I mean you know you know the story the well is deep and you asking me you know people think that now they think oh I can't do it and saying oh God is so great God give me everything God give me and God said will you go for me no Lord I believe you died for me but will you give your life for me Lord you are worried I'm not worried I know that but I'm thirsty I'm hungry how many you see that picture now you can't get cross that angel without that revelation right there you're gonna have that word is belayed in your spirit and you're gonna have to do something with it amen don't shy away from me now we're in another place right now if you can see what I'm looking at God is calling people don't want to go they want to brag about other people that went are you hearing me now David long for a drink I'm gonna try to move out the way now how many you've got the revelation I'm you got a revelation I mean you can see what God is asking of us I you want a good husband you want a good wife you want all your children to be lined sometimes God pushes things back just show you that I didn't bring you here so you alone could be happy you're never gonna be happy in this life enjoy Des Moines trying to get up get out and move back out and come come home I love it's a beautiful place it's not so busy you know I don't know how y'all but it just looks beautiful to me this looks like it's enough space you know places are clean the restaurants that I went to brother Keith and brother Isaac brother Keith are sitting together we just felt like it didn't it didn't even care you just you just hope we just all brother just you know and people you know even living at what in the world but that's way it ought to be don't come this far and be ashamed of your brother and sisters people need to see Jesus and the only way they can see him is through you a man system God is thirsty God is thirsty for someone to come to the will that needs a drink oh don't worry don't don't be too see don't think people are not thirsty don't think people oh I got a good job and I've got a good education for my children are doing good and all life is beautiful life isn't that beautiful you got to look beyond that you know the story y'all know the story you know people take these little cigarettes with the filters on them oh I smoke less they want more yes you know when people act like oh I got it all no really they don't have nothing they want more you won't be satisfied until God feels the innermost being of your soul to God takes every gene of your body every facet and the Holy Spirit amen the healing virtues of God begin to flow to your own body that you will be ashamed of lay hands on the sick knowing that it's not your hands but it's gone in a surrendered vessel that understands what word has been restored to us you can walk right up to cancer and look at it I tell that demon get out of there oh my you can walk up to aids and say aids is nothing against the power of God you can walk to a person say you can't hide God sees everything amen that gosh and see we can't do it without that we can't do it without God's help but God has restored the help to the church God has restored every gift to the church they're not gone they're still here amen and when you need God to put you in the right place God will put you in the right place God will tell you it's over here it's over there gotta go way back way back reminded testimony of a little young lady she married uh Samara brother brother his wife had died and he still had some children remarried and when he married she was my precious little daughter and I never forget she said pastor I I knew that was what she wanted her own children she had never had her own children and I just felt in firming this I just kept feeling that trying to feel that you know cuz you know in you know you've got to really be serious about this thing God's not gonna hear you until you serious you just be talking and I felt that she wanted all children nothing wrong with she had to care for other children but they weren't hers they didn't come through her body this had been married long years not kept staying before God Lord I know it and she was just she was a beautiful she's glides like a child she'd come to church a man and sit she would sit she was sick come on that side she coming in is properly and she was just enjoy the word just sit there one minute us it was a smaller group a man she was homely and she would just sit there and staying to where she'd come from miles just to come hear the word and that word got she got hungry enough she got desperate enough and I had to wait till she did because sometimes God want to know how bad you want [Applause] here come the Holy Spirit amen in a session we had we had a little private her and her side she brought a husband up amen I brought another brother in we begin to pray I didn't hear come God God comes down in the building overshadows these field of people here children's in the back room and there the Holy Spirit reveals something that was done in the family that was not confessed and when the Holy Spirit that said that's it and they begin said oh you talking about that that's something I'd done years ago so yeah but you didn't make it right you've got to confess that and get that under the blood very

call of God is greater and they won't grab to that and all of a sudden I started seeing how small and how Paul calls it dung all this stuff I strived for all this education Paul was smart and educated amen then I'm been small and educated by write four books of the you can't write no books in the Bible but for a man how many know what I'm talking my but God used that education to lie him a man to
