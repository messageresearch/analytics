[54:10] and bomb and said by myself have i sworn
[54:13] say the lord for because thou has done
[54:16] this thing and has not withheld thy son
[54:19] thine only son
[54:20] that in blessing will i bless thee and
[54:24] in multiplying i will multiply thy seed
[54:27] as the stars of the heaven and as the
[54:30] sand which is upon the sea shore and thy
[54:33] seed shall possess the gate of his
[54:36] enemies
[54:37] amen lord ed blessings to the reading of
[54:39] his word we may take our seeds
[54:43] amen for um
[54:45] for a short time we just want to speak
[54:47] on this uh
[54:48] this title possessing the enemy's gate
[54:51] amen
[54:54] i want to focus on the last part where
[54:56] he says
[54:58] and thy sea shall possess the gate of
[55:01] his enemy we see god was making a
[55:03] covenant with abraham
[55:05] because god noticed every time he made a
[55:07] covenant with men
[55:09] men always failed
[55:11] men were not able to hold or
[55:14] keep the end of the deal then god said
[55:17] not this time
[55:18] this time around i'm swearing by myself
[55:22] you don't have to do anything
[55:24] but i whatever i say it is up to me and
[55:27] i'm going to get it done amen and there
[55:29] is nobody else who's higher than god
[55:31] himself that's why he swore by himself
[55:34] amen he said man you have failed enough
[55:37] now this time around my covenant with
[55:39] you it is not going to fail because i
[55:42] have sworn by myself
[55:43] and he says thy seed shall possess the
[55:46] gate of his enemies this was a promise
[55:48] to abraham and all he said that was
[55:50] going to come after him amen
[55:53] so he decided to make the covenant by
[55:55] himself it says despite abraham's
[55:57] shortcomings you know abraham made a lot
[55:59] of mistakes he had a lot of failures he
[56:02] made a lot of shortcomings but god said
[56:04] despite all of that i'm going to stand
[56:07] with my word i'm going to stand by my
[56:09] word and i will keep my covenant and he
[56:11] made it for abraham and his seed that
[56:13] came after him
[56:15] all of isaac and his descendants that
[56:17] promise it was to them amen
[56:20] so they knew that there is no enemy
[56:22] that's going to stand upon before them
[56:25] because they had this promise that they
[56:27] shall possess the gate of each and every
[56:29] enemy of them amen
[56:32] we know abraham he fought he went uh he
[56:34] went for lot when lord was uh
[56:37] was kidnapped by those ten kings and he
[56:40] went he trained the men in his own house
[56:42] but he went after 10 kings in their
[56:44] armies and overcame them while he was
[56:46] standing on god's promise he knew that
[56:48] god was able to come through for
[56:50] whatever he has said so he was not
[56:53] scared of anything abraham he just
[56:55] trained the man the local husband in his
[56:58] house and they went to fight kings they
[57:00] knew victory was certain because god's
[57:03] covenant never fails amen
[57:06] and he carried all the promise down
[57:08] through the israelites we know the
[57:10] israelites they always want why god was
[57:12] always on their side they could have
[57:14] lost some wars but we know
[57:16] they want the battles because that was
[57:19] god's covenant to them
[57:21] we read in the bible of
[57:23] a man called shamga
[57:27] he was there and they were being taken
[57:28] advantage of by the fearless times and
[57:31] he was right there over and over their
[57:33] harvest were being taken
[57:36] and after some time he looks at his
[57:38] family the prophet of god talks about it
[57:40] he said he looks at his wife he says his
[57:42] wife is starving she's skinny he looks
[57:44] at his daughter he sees the daughter is
[57:46] starving and then he realized he said
[57:48] but wait i'm a son of abraham
[57:51] we have a promise that we are supposed
[57:53] to possess the gates of all our enemies
[57:57] not some gates but all the gates so he
[58:00] knew that that promise was going to keep
[58:02] him amen so when he saw 600 philistines
[58:06] they were right there he said i don't
[58:08] care enough is enough today is the day
[58:12] i'm just going to stand upon god's
[58:14] promise i do not know how i'm going to
[58:16] overcome i do not know how this is going
[58:18] to come to pass i'm just going to go in
[58:21] my might and i know god will take care
[58:23] of me
[58:24] that's why he took the closest thing
[58:26] that was to him and ox god and he went
[58:28] after 600 philistines and he slew all of
[58:31] them
[58:32] why because he was standing on god's
[58:35] covenant he was standing on the promise
[58:38] of god amen amen he realized that he had
[58:41] abraham's blood flowing in his veins and
[58:44] he said i know god is duty-bound
[58:48] to keep his word amen
[58:50] the prophet god tells us that we we are
[58:53] sons of abraham we are the seed of
[58:55] abraham so because you are a seed of
[58:57] abraham that covenant pertains to you as
[59:00] well
[59:01] amen it doesn't matter what the enemy
[59:03] how long the enemy has kept you taken
[59:05] advantage of you
[59:06] made you live under your own privileges
[59:09] if you just realize that that promise
[59:11] that you shall possess the gates of your
[59:14] enemy walk out god's word is going to
[59:17] keep you amen god's word is going to
[59:19] sustain you god's word is going to give
[59:22] you victory amen
[59:24] and we know in galatians chapter 3 verse
[59:26] 27 says for as many of you as have been
[59:29] baptized into christ have put on christ
[59:32] there is neither jew nor greek neither
[59:34] is
[59:35] born or free there is neither male nor
[59:37] female for you are all one in christ
[59:40] jesus
[59:41] and if ye be christ then you are
[59:43] abraham's seed and heirs according to
[59:46] that promise so if you are in christ and
[59:49] you have accepted christ as your
[59:50] personal savior
[59:52] you are abraham's seed so that covenant
[59:55] pertains to you you gotta hold it on
[59:57] tight because that is your inheritance
[1:00:00] it is yours that you are supposed to
[1:00:03] possess the gates of the enemy and god
[1:00:05] saying in blessing i will bless thee so
[1:00:08] no one can curse that which god has
[1:00:10] blessed amen because god's word always
[1:00:13] come to pass god is not a man that he
[1:00:15] should lie neither is he a son of man
[1:00:18] that he should repent whenever he speaks
[1:00:20] the word it comes back only to him after
[1:00:23] he has accomplished that which he sent
[1:00:25] it out for
[1:00:26] amen amen so we gotta know
[1:00:28] as long as we are alive we're gonna have
[1:00:30] battles in our lives we're gonna have
[1:00:33] we're in a constant battle until we die
[1:00:35] sometimes we lose wars sometimes we fail
[1:00:38] but if we just remember that god's
[1:00:40] promised aid we shall possess the gates
[1:00:42] of all the enemies amen all those gates
[1:00:45] so we might lose a war but we know we
[1:00:48] will win each and every battle amen
[1:00:50] because we are more than conquerors how
[1:00:53] can we be conquerors and we are not
[1:00:54] winning anything amen so we got to stand
[1:00:57] on god's promise you know that each and
[1:00:59] every battle that comes our way we will
[1:01:01] overcome we might lose today and say
[1:01:04] i've lost this war but keep on get get
[1:01:06] up and keep on going that's right amen
[1:01:08] because there's a promise that says many
[1:01:10] other afflictions of the righteous but
[1:01:12] god shall deliver out of them all not
[1:01:15] some of them but out of them all and the
[1:01:18] prophet of god gave us a definition of a
[1:01:20] righteous man a righteous man is not
[1:01:22] someone who never done wrong but it's
[1:01:25] someone who when he falls he gets up
[1:01:27] and keep on going so whenever you feel
[1:01:30] like you have lost one walk do not let
[1:01:32] do not fall in despair
[1:01:34] get up and keep on going
[1:01:36] we have a promise of overcoming the
[1:01:38] battle we have a promise to win each and
[1:01:41] every battle that comes our way amen
[1:01:43] so we know god keeps his word and we are
[1:01:46] heirs to abraham according to his word
[1:01:49] according to his promise so if you are a
[1:01:52] descendant of abraham by faith
[1:01:54] spiritually your name is written in that
[1:01:57] covenant
[1:01:58] it says
[1:02:00] your name right there you are going to
[1:02:02] live in this age and that covenant
[1:02:04] pertains to you so when you are right
[1:02:06] there you gotta claim the benefits of
[1:02:08] that covenant you say lord i'm having
[1:02:11] these battles
[1:02:12] where is my possession where is me
[1:02:15] overcoming those enemies because your
[1:02:17] name is in that covenant god has to make
[1:02:20] sure that comes to you amen so it
[1:02:22] doesn't matter how many trials what how
[1:02:24] many battles you face you know we are
[1:02:26] promised that we are more than
[1:02:28] conquerors
[1:02:29] hallelujah
[1:02:31] so
[1:02:32] every trial comes before any victory
[1:02:34] there is no victory without fighting
[1:02:37] there is no you cannot be a conqueror
[1:02:38] without fighting a battle the prophet
[1:02:40] god says
[1:02:41] they come at time first that they had to
[1:02:44] come a trial
[1:02:46] there's always trials it's always
[1:02:48] darkest before day in nature
[1:02:51] and you'll always have trials before you
[1:02:53] have victory if there is no war there is
[1:02:56] no victory
[1:02:57] so for you to claim into that identity
[1:03:00] that god has given you that you are a
[1:03:02] modern conqueror you gonna know that
[1:03:04] their trials coming your way it doesn't
[1:03:06] matter what they are but you know that i
[1:03:08] am promised to be more than a conqueror
[1:03:11] so if i walk and i overcome this trial
[1:03:13] that i'm facing i know there is victory
[1:03:16] that's certain for me because god has
[1:03:18] promised it and he has won that victory
[1:03:21] for me already
[1:03:22] and he said abraham would never possess
[1:03:25] the gate of the enemy until he was tried
[1:03:28] first and you'll never possess the gate
[1:03:31] of that enemy until you go through the
[1:03:33] trials
[1:03:34] some through the waters some through the
[1:03:36] flood some through deep trials but all
[1:03:38] through the blood
[1:03:39] god leads all his children so you must
[1:03:42] first be tried because when you are
[1:03:44] being tried you are being perfected into
[1:03:47] the stature of christ amen you just
[1:03:50] cannot be perfect without going through
[1:03:52] any trial because we know that our
[1:03:56] that our perfection comes through our
[1:03:58] suffering our perfection comes through
[1:04:00] our trials why we will come through it
[1:04:03] you know when gold is being purified
[1:04:04] they put it in the fire that's how they
[1:04:06] can tell it's real gold because it burns
[1:04:09] all the impurities and then at the end
[1:04:11] of the day
[1:04:12] when the when the god panel when he
[1:04:14] looks at the gold and he sees his face
[1:04:16] in the he can say this is pure gold it
[1:04:19] has been tried in the fire but if it is
[1:04:21] in pure gold when they put that
[1:04:23] temperature that gold false gold will
[1:04:26] burn up amen but we know we are the
[1:04:29] children of abraham we are god's
[1:04:31] children we know we will walk through
[1:04:33] the fire that fire will not harm us it
[1:04:36] will not burn us but it will only purify
[1:04:39] us when we come out at the end we will
[1:04:41] come out victorious we will come out
[1:04:43] better than we were before amen because
[1:04:46] god always keeps his promise
[1:04:49] and god gave us prayer
[1:04:51] which is what we overcome by
[1:04:54] some at one point prophet god says
[1:04:56] prayer is the most powerful weapon that
[1:04:59] god placed in the hands of man
[1:05:01] so prayer
[1:05:03] we can approach god 24 7
[1:05:06] with our needs there is no restriction
[1:05:08] to say at this time god does not have
[1:05:10] customer service that that that ends at
[1:05:12] 5 p.m no
[1:05:14] his
[1:05:15] line is open all the time
[1:05:17] go to him in prayer and he is there to
[1:05:20] supply your needs he is jehovah rapha he
[1:05:23] healed all our diseases he is jehovah
[1:05:26] jireh he supplies all our needs so when
[1:05:29] you come to him in need and say lord
[1:05:31] your covenant says that i shall possess
[1:05:34] the gates of my enemy is this enemy
[1:05:36] that's troubling me give me the strength
[1:05:39] and might so i can go and overcome the
[1:05:41] enemy god is able to give you that
[1:05:43] victory amen because he always stands in
[1:05:46] his word and he said if my people who
[1:05:49] are called by my name if they humble
[1:05:51] themselves and pray he said i will hear
[1:05:53] from heaven
[1:05:54] not only does he hear but he will hear
[1:05:57] and he will answer that prayer so you
[1:05:59] know that god has an ear open for you
[1:06:03] you are his child he is not going to
[1:06:05] shine you away
[1:06:06] because he is there for you prophet god
[1:06:09] says the greatest weapon was ever put in
[1:06:11] the hands of man is prayer it even
[1:06:14] changes everything it even changed the
[1:06:17] mind of god one time
[1:06:19] god told his prophet to go up and tell
[1:06:20] the king he was going to die and the
[1:06:22] king turned his face to the war and said
[1:06:24] lord i beseech you to consider me
[1:06:27] i've walked before you with a perfect
[1:06:29] heart i need 15 years more and god
[1:06:32] granted
[1:06:34] the king his prayer he granted his
[1:06:37] request and he gave it to him what more
[1:06:40] you and me
[1:06:41] bought by jesus
[1:06:43] precious blood that he spilled on that
[1:06:45] cross if we come to god in prayer he
[1:06:48] can't supply your needs if you come to
[1:06:50] him he can grant your request knowing
[1:06:53] that god will answer your prayer when
[1:06:55] you come to him amen so that's why the
[1:06:57] bible says pray without ceasing
[1:07:00] amen because that's where you get the
[1:07:02] strength
[1:07:03] you just don't
[1:07:05] spend two weeks you're not praying then
[1:07:07] you just come and you pray this one time
[1:07:10] and you wake up a warrior now you gotta
[1:07:12] pray without ceasing you know when when
[1:07:16] when uh jesus and the disciples were on
[1:07:18] the boat you know he came there and he
[1:07:20] said peace be still why he was coming
[1:07:22] from praying in the mountain that's
[1:07:24] where he got his strength these
[1:07:26] disciples they would they were not
[1:07:28] prayer warriors they didn't know what
[1:07:29] was going on before then so
[1:07:32] pray praying gave jesus the solid
[1:07:36] foundation of the miracles that he had
[1:07:38] he was god in himself but he kept on
[1:07:41] praying constantly
[1:07:43] so we need to pray and stand upon god's
[1:07:45] promises amen amen when it comes to
[1:07:49] anything that god has promised he says
[1:07:52] brother brown says take the initiative
[1:07:53] and stand right there god made the
[1:07:56] promise he is obligated to his promise
[1:07:59] as long as you are abraham's seed he has
[1:08:02] got to answer that amen
[1:08:05] god has to answer that why because you
[1:08:07] are abraham said so you got to have that
[1:08:10] faith to know that with this faith
[1:08:12] whatever i ask for i am going to receive
[1:08:15] it because you know god
[1:08:18] is not a man that he should lie whatever
[1:08:20] he says in his word he's got to give it
[1:08:22] to you
[1:08:23] so the more you use your faith the
[1:08:25] stronger it gets
[1:08:26] faith is like muscles the more you use
[1:08:29] it the more bigger they get the more
[1:08:32] confident you get so there's always a
[1:08:34] fight between there's always a battle
[1:08:36] between faith and doubt
[1:08:40] and faith the more you feed faith the
[1:08:44] bigger it becomes because the bible says
[1:08:47] faith comes by hearing and hearing by
[1:08:50] the word of god it does not say faith
[1:08:52] comes by having heard the word not that
[1:08:55] you have heard and then you already have
[1:08:57] faith no you constantly keep on hearing
[1:09:00] the word of god and faith comes by that
[1:09:04] the more you use it you are growing your
[1:09:07] your um
[1:09:08] your faith muscles and you know whenever
[1:09:11] you come across a situation you're able
[1:09:13] to overcome
[1:09:15] those enemies gates why because you are
[1:09:17] using your faith
[1:09:18] god is helping you to build it up and
[1:09:21] you know there's nothing that can stand
[1:09:23] in your way amen
[1:09:26] we know we have both good and evil
[1:09:28] within ourselves
[1:09:30] the thing that you feed most is the one
[1:09:32] that overcomes the other that's right so
[1:09:34] you have faith and faith faith and doubt
[1:09:37] exist but we know we are children of god
[1:09:39] we only have faith on the inside but if
[1:09:41] you don't feed that faith
[1:09:43] doubt will overcome you
[1:09:45] you will not be able to overcome that's
[1:09:47] why we have to stay focused and make
[1:09:50] sure we are focusing on the word of god
[1:09:53] and not being distracted by the things
[1:09:55] of this world
[1:09:56] because those things will
[1:09:58] deem our focus and we end up looking at
[1:10:00] those storms of life like peter did and
[1:10:02] he lost his faith because he was not
[1:10:04] focused on the word the word of god said
[1:10:07] to him come
[1:10:08] he was alright as long as he was looking
[1:10:11] at the word but as soon as he turned
[1:10:13] away and started looking at his
[1:10:14] circumstances that's when doubt started
[1:10:17] overcoming his fear his faith and he
[1:10:19] started drowning and he said lord help
[1:10:22] me please and then he was able god was
[1:10:24] jesus was able to redeem him and save
[1:10:27] him
[1:10:28] so we got to make sure
[1:10:30] we stay our focus on the word that's
[1:10:34] where our faith comes from amen we keep
[1:10:36] on hearing that word
[1:10:38] keep on listening to those tapes keep on
[1:10:41] reading that bible that's where our
[1:10:43] faith comes from that's where our
[1:10:45] strength comes from hallelujah from the
[1:10:48] word of god you know the word the other
[1:10:51] time when you're saying the word carries
[1:10:53] the same authority as the person who is
[1:10:55] spoken
[1:10:57] when jesus said let there when god in
[1:10:59] the
[1:11:00] at the creation of the world he said let
[1:11:02] there be light
[1:11:04] light had to be there why because the
[1:11:06] word that he had spoken had the same
[1:11:08] authority as god himself amen many times
[1:11:12] when people at when people tell you oh
[1:11:14] uh can you go do this and that you're
[1:11:16] going to ask first who said that
[1:11:18] because your action is going to detail
[1:11:21] is going to be determined how fast you
[1:11:23] carry out that action is determined by
[1:11:25] who said it
[1:11:27] if it is someone of a higher authority
[1:11:28] you know you would do it right then
[1:11:31] if it is your friend you do it in your
[1:11:33] spare time you're like okay i'll do it
[1:11:35] when i get time if it is someone who's
[1:11:37] probably lower than you you have a
[1:11:39] decision you might not even do it
[1:11:41] but when i when god said let there be
[1:11:43] light there is no higher authority than
[1:11:45] god himself so light had to be there
[1:11:50] so we we noticed that when jesus was
[1:11:52] walking on the earth in his three years
[1:11:54] of ministry
[1:11:55] he was the word made flesh so that was
[1:11:57] the same as god speaking he was using
[1:12:00] the word to possess the gates of the
[1:12:02] enemy he overcame satan after his 40-day
[1:12:05] fast why by speaking the word because
[1:12:08] that word has authority so he was using
[1:12:10] that word to overcome he was using that
[1:12:13] word to win his all of his battles
[1:12:17] amen because that same word that says
[1:12:19] men shall not leave by bread alone and
[1:12:21] he overcame satan is that same voice
[1:12:23] that said let there be light is that
[1:12:26] same voice that when demons were being
[1:12:28] cast out from the layman from the blind
[1:12:31] man and they would run away because they
[1:12:34] understood the authority that was in the
[1:12:35] word and that authority in the word it
[1:12:38] was possessing all the enemies gates so
[1:12:41] that's why you and me when we stand on
[1:12:44] that word we know that word it still has
[1:12:47] the same power to overcome to
[1:12:50] same power to possess all the gates of
[1:12:53] the enemy because that word has never
[1:12:55] failed that's why we got to keep on
[1:12:57] eating the word because we become what
[1:12:59] we eat the more we eat the word the more
[1:13:02] we become the word so when we speak it
[1:13:05] is like the word that is speaking and we
[1:13:07] know we can possess the gates of the
[1:13:09] enemy with the faith that we get from
[1:13:12] hearing the word
[1:13:13] amen so jesus performed all these
[1:13:16] miracles using the word he possessed all
[1:13:18] the gates of the enemy possess the gates
[1:13:21] of sickness possessed the gates of all
[1:13:23] the people who were afflicted
[1:13:25] because we know he was a hundred percent
[1:13:27] man and he was a hundred percent god
[1:13:30] amen
[1:13:31] you know when he when they were at the
[1:13:32] waters when they were at the sheep when
[1:13:34] he was sleeping
[1:13:36] and the calm the the storm came the
[1:13:39] satan said this is my time to get him
[1:13:42] but he didn't know whom
[1:13:44] whom that was he didn't know the kind of
[1:13:46] power that was lying in jesus the
[1:13:49] prophet of god said the devil said we
[1:13:51] got him now he's asleep
[1:13:54] we'll drown him he was a man tired and
[1:13:57] weary laying on the back of that boat
[1:13:59] there with a pillow somewhere sleeping
[1:14:02] but brother when once he arose and put
[1:14:05] his foot on the braille of that boat and
[1:14:08] looked up and said peace
[1:14:09] be still the winds and the waves obeyed
[1:14:12] him why that was more than a man
[1:14:15] speaking that was god in that man
[1:14:18] so you gotta know to call jesus on the
[1:14:21] scene when you have storms of life
[1:14:23] coming your way
[1:14:25] you know he just has to say peace be
[1:14:27] still why he will overcome he will
[1:14:30] possess those gates by the power of the
[1:14:32] word he has done it before and he will
[1:14:35] never fail
[1:14:36] amen
[1:14:38] so whatever he said
[1:14:40] it has to go it has to come to pass
[1:14:42] because god's words never fail
[1:14:45] in psalms the bible says whatever it
[1:14:48] says thy word or lord is established in
[1:14:50] the heaven so everything has to be
[1:14:52] established in the heavens first before
[1:14:55] it happens here on earth
[1:14:57] so
[1:14:57] when a child of god is going through any
[1:15:00] situation you know that there's
[1:15:02] something else that's going on in heaven
[1:15:04] we are not just bound we are only
[1:15:06] confined to to these dimensions but we
[1:15:09] know there's something going on
[1:15:11] when job was going through his trial he
[1:15:13] did not know that there's a conversation
[1:15:15] that had gone on between
[1:15:17] god and satan he did not know that but
[1:15:20] something had already happened in the
[1:15:22] heavens that was affecting his life
[1:15:25] while she was here on earth
[1:15:27] so
[1:15:27] when he was there
[1:15:29] he is struggling his um
[1:15:31] his his kids are dying all his cows
[1:15:35] ghosts and whatever everything was being
[1:15:37] taken away from him he did not
[1:15:39] understand what was going on he knew he
[1:15:41] was getting in at trial but
[1:15:43] in the heavens it was already
[1:15:45] established god had already said i know
[1:15:47] my servant job he will never
[1:15:50] ever forsake me my servant job he will
[1:15:53] always stand for me so whatever he went
[1:15:55] through god's word was already
[1:15:57] established in the heaven it had already
[1:16:00] been said so job had no other option but
[1:16:04] to overcome each and every trial that
[1:16:06] came his way amen he had no other option
[1:16:08] but to overcome each and every
[1:16:10] temptation that came
[1:16:12] hey man so we know everything happens in
[1:16:15] heaven first before it happens on the
[1:16:16] earth the prophet of god says sometimes
[1:16:19] we watch things going on here on earth
[1:16:21] but there's something going on in heaven
[1:16:24] all the same time
[1:16:25] we might not be able to see it but it's
[1:16:28] going on anyhow
[1:16:30] amen
[1:16:31] we all know of
[1:16:33] the story of michaela and ahab
[1:16:36] they were right there and michael was
[1:16:38] prophesying and he had he had said a
[1:16:40] word and god had to make sure that comes
[1:16:43] to pass
[1:16:44] they had a conversation in heaven
[1:16:46] although people here on earth ahab maike
[1:16:49] and uh zedekiah and all of those they
[1:16:51] had the showdown going on there was a
[1:16:54] conversation that was happening in
[1:16:55] heaven and god was saying
[1:16:57] what shall we do so that
[1:16:59] the word of the prophet comes to pass
[1:17:02] and he had to send one he had to send a
[1:17:05] lying spirit to go and anoint these
[1:17:07] prophets so that the prophecy of elijah
[1:17:11] would come to pass
[1:17:12] so
[1:17:13] things were already happening in the
[1:17:15] heaven but on earth they could not see
[1:17:17] it so if we know but we know that
[1:17:21] jesus our god he is the mass of
[1:17:23] everything that happening that's
[1:17:25] happening in heaven
[1:17:26] everything he's
[1:17:28] saying everything in his word he said
[1:17:30] about us it is only for our good because
[1:17:32] in jeremiah he says i know the plans
[1:17:35] that i have for you
[1:17:36] plans for you to prosper so it is
[1:17:39] nothing but only for you and my good
[1:17:42] you know those three hebrew boys when
[1:17:45] they were up there in um when they were
[1:17:47] about to be thrown in the fire there was
[1:17:49] a conversation that was going on in
[1:17:51] heaven
[1:17:52] gabriel said let me go go say no
[1:17:55] not this time
[1:17:57] the three hebrew boys they were just
[1:17:59] praying they did not know what was going
[1:18:01] on they just had their faith they were
[1:18:04] just standing on god's word that says
[1:18:07] thou shalt serve no other god and they
[1:18:09] said you know what even if god doesn't
[1:18:11] even hear us we are not going in even if
[1:18:14] he doesn't come to save us we are just
[1:18:16] going through we are not going to fail
[1:18:18] him then god heard it and there was a
[1:18:21] conversation that was happening in
[1:18:22] heaven and he worm would say you know i
[1:18:25] once destroyed the earth in the days of
[1:18:27] noah i can go with water and quench out
[1:18:29] the fire god said no you are not going
[1:18:33] this one i am going alone and he came
[1:18:35] down and he possessed the gates of
[1:18:38] those of shadrach meshach and abednego's
[1:18:41] enemies
[1:18:42] so we know whenever we are having a
[1:18:44] trial whenever we are having a situation
[1:18:47] to handle there is a conversation that's
[1:18:49] happening in heaven
[1:18:51] god is dispatching angels god already
[1:18:54] has a plan that's there to deliver you
[1:18:57] god already has a plan in place so that
[1:19:00] you can be delivered so that you can
[1:19:02] possess the gates of the enemy amen all
[1:19:05] you just have to do is stand on his word
[1:19:08] and he will let it come through because
[1:19:10] remember he has a covenant with you if
[1:19:13] you're a seed of abraham he has a
[1:19:15] covenant with you
[1:19:16] that you shall possess each and every
[1:19:19] gate of the enemy
[1:19:21] amen so you know
[1:19:24] that in the heavens there is a plan
[1:19:26] that's already set so you are not going
[1:19:28] to fail amen you are not going to come
[1:19:31] down as a as a loser you are not going
[1:19:33] to come down as a coward but you will
[1:19:35] come through as a conqueror you will
[1:19:38] come through as a victor because jesus
[1:19:40] said i have lost
[1:19:42] none of them that you gave me so he will
[1:19:45] make sure he will come after you he will
[1:19:47] leave the 99 to follow you the only one
[1:19:50] that has gone astray or to follow you
[1:19:52] the one that has
[1:19:54] that is being troubled he will leave
[1:19:56] everything to come and follow you
[1:19:58] because we know that one soul is worth
[1:20:01] ten thousand worlds so he is not going
[1:20:04] to let you go he's going to get ahold of
[1:20:06] you he will have a conference for you
[1:20:09] because why you are a seed of abraham
[1:20:11] and he has a covenant so he has to make
[1:20:13] sure that that covenant stands he has to
[1:20:16] make sure that that covenant it comes to
[1:20:18] pass
[1:20:20] because you are a seed of abraham so
[1:20:22] whatever you are dealing with whatever
[1:20:24] situation you are dealing with just hang
[1:20:27] in there
[1:20:28] help is coming there is a conference
[1:20:30] that is going on god is saying what
[1:20:32] shall we do look at my son look at my
[1:20:35] daughter this is happening to them he is
[1:20:38] already sending angels to say go help
[1:20:40] him go deliver him
[1:20:42] go possess the gates of the enemy and at
[1:20:45] the end of the day you will come through
[1:20:47] victorious so you should not rely on
[1:20:50] people but you rely and stand on the
[1:20:52] word of god
[1:20:54] because if you rely on people what are
[1:20:56] you going to do when people
[1:20:58] everybody walks out on you what are you
[1:21:00] going to do you'll be stranded but if
[1:21:02] you stand on the word of god you will
[1:21:04] never leave you
[1:21:06] the word of god is god himself he said i
[1:21:09] will be with you even in you till the
[1:21:12] end of the world so i don't care if
[1:21:14] everybody else walks out on me so long i
[1:21:17] am holding on to the word
[1:21:19] you know of elijah
[1:21:21] he was going to starve but there was no
[1:21:24] man there was no person who was coming
[1:21:25] to help him god had sent a he sent a
[1:21:28] ravens that came with food and fed him
[1:21:31] for three years
[1:21:33] so you do not need to rely on people
[1:21:36] because when you rely on people and they
[1:21:38] help you out you're going to give that
[1:21:40] glory to those people you're going to
[1:21:42] give glory to that person who helped you
[1:21:44] but god is a jealousy god he just wants
[1:21:47] all the glory to himself
[1:21:49] so
[1:21:50] rely on the word of god god will always
[1:21:52] come through for you
[1:21:54] amen in psalms 23 uh david said thou
[1:21:57] prepared a table before me in the
[1:22:00] presence of mine enemies
[1:22:02] thou anointes my head with oil my cup
[1:22:06] run it over
[1:22:07] run it over he gives you more than you
[1:22:10] need he has more than enough hallelujah
[1:22:14] he is el shaddai the all-sufficient one
[1:22:18] it means god of plenty it means he is
[1:22:21] more than enough so all we just need we
[1:22:24] need to be patient he will give us our
[1:22:27] hearts desire because he said in his
[1:22:29] word he is able to do exceedingly
[1:22:32] abundantly above all that we could ever
[1:22:34] think of
[1:22:36] so we if we stand on the word of god we
[1:22:39] know god will never fail us
[1:22:41] if we stand with man
[1:22:43] man can fail us
[1:22:44] men can walk out on us but god he is
[1:22:47] that friend who walks in when everyone
[1:22:50] else is walking out is that friend who
[1:22:52] is willing to help you when no one else
[1:22:55] is willing to help you
[1:22:57] if you cry and say lord save me just
[1:23:00] like you saved peter the bible says
[1:23:02] immediately jesus saved him so if
[1:23:05] whatever you are going through you just
[1:23:07] cry and say lord
[1:23:09] help me
[1:23:10] lord
[1:23:11] save me immediately he is going to save
[1:23:14] you because he says i have lost none of
[1:23:17] them that you gave me so he's not going
[1:23:19] to let you get lost in a battle he's not
[1:23:22] going to get you lost in a trial or in a
[1:23:24] temptation he's going to come and he
[1:23:26] will save you
[1:23:28] so for every victory you got to fight
[1:23:30] you got to come out more than a
[1:23:32] conqueror you gotta fight more than one
[1:23:34] battle for you to be a conqueror for you
[1:23:36] to be a warrior it means you have
[1:23:38] overcome more than one battle so we
[1:23:41] gotta be they stand on god's word the
[1:23:44] three hebrew boys they stood on god's
[1:23:46] word and when they came out of the fire
[1:23:49] not even one hair of on their head was
[1:23:52] burnt why because they stood on the word
[1:23:54] of god
[1:23:57] daniel he was cussed
[1:23:59] in the den of lions that had been
[1:24:00] stabbed for so many weeks but because he
[1:24:03] was standing on the word of god
[1:24:05] he came out he possessed the gates of
[1:24:07] his enemies and he came out everyone
[1:24:09] marveled how did you do this why because
[1:24:12] he was always praying and he was
[1:24:13] standing on the word of god amen god
[1:24:16] never fails you
[1:24:18] god always comes through for you amen
[1:24:21] so if you rely on him god is the master
[1:24:24] strategist
[1:24:26] he is a five-star general
[1:24:28] that he has the best strategy that there
[1:24:31] is so you know you will never fail
[1:24:33] because you have the five-star general
[1:24:35] on your end whatever he says do
[1:24:38] you do that
[1:24:39] amen whatever he says
[1:24:42] go do you go do that
[1:24:44] don't ask me any questions just go
[1:24:46] because you know he's the master
[1:24:48] strategist whatever he says it has to
[1:24:50] come to pass
[1:24:51] amen i heard this story one old man who
[1:24:53] was carrying a bible and people asked
[1:24:55] them why you carrying that bible do you
[1:24:57] even know how to read it he says i don't
[1:24:59] know i don't know how to read it and say
[1:25:00] why carrying it he says because it's the
[1:25:02] word of god and they said so why carry
[1:25:05] it if you can't read it and he says well
[1:25:07] i believe it from cover to cover why
[1:25:10] because it says holy bible so i believe
[1:25:12] it so i might not understand everything
[1:25:15] that that is in the word but i still
[1:25:17] believe it because i know the word of
[1:25:19] god never fails and it is there for me
[1:25:22] it is what will keep me
[1:25:25] and god we serve our god who is a master
[1:25:28] strategist you know in the days of noah
[1:25:31] he
[1:25:32] commissioned noah to go build an ark
[1:25:34] with using gopher wood
[1:25:36] that had never happened before and
[1:25:38] people criticize noah see how can you
[1:25:42] build an arc using golfer wood
[1:25:45] it's it it's a it's a wood that is
[1:25:47] porous that when it gets into water it
[1:25:49] sucks in all the water and it made
[1:25:52] absolutely no sense and we know in these
[1:25:55] days they were more scientifically
[1:25:59] way ahead of us right now
[1:26:01] and then it just it was just ridiculous
[1:26:03] it made no sense why are you building an
[1:26:06] ark with golfer wood but god he was the
[1:26:08] master strategist
[1:26:10] he knew that he told noah to to to boil
[1:26:14] that that uh gofferwood in the evergreen
[1:26:17] tree sap that pitch so when it was
[1:26:20] laying in the it sucked in that pitch
[1:26:23] that evergreen tree pitch
[1:26:25] and then when it came in
[1:26:26] into all those pores it was as light as
[1:26:30] light as could be but it was as strong
[1:26:32] as steel
[1:26:34] god knew what he was doing no scientists
[1:26:36] in those days could figure that out but
[1:26:38] god had already
[1:26:40] had already that figured out there was a
[1:26:42] master strategy so that
[1:26:45] noah could survive the storm so that
[1:26:47] noah could survive the flood that was
[1:26:49] going to come so it did not make sense
[1:26:51] but god's strategy it came out
[1:26:55] they say there's an approximate of three
[1:26:57] 3.8 million animals that were in the ark
[1:27:01] i do not know if there was any ark or
[1:27:03] any ship that was going to be able to
[1:27:05] to contain or house all those animals
[1:27:08] but because it was god's plan it was
[1:27:10] god's strategy he made he had everything
[1:27:13] measured to the t he knew that if you do
[1:27:16] this it is going to come out and in the
[1:27:19] same time he was giving us he was
[1:27:20] showing a type
[1:27:21] of the deity of human beings that when
[1:27:24] we
[1:27:25] you are a wood when you lay in the
[1:27:27] presence of god and you allow god to
[1:27:30] suck in within you you will become as
[1:27:32] strong
[1:27:33] nothing can stand before you
[1:27:35] it doesn't matter how many
[1:27:38] floods of life that come for you it
[1:27:40] doesn't matter how many storms are
[1:27:41] coming your way you will never drown you
[1:27:44] will never sink why because
[1:27:46] you are god's master plan you are right
[1:27:49] there when you allow god to feel in
[1:27:51] yourself the other time brother ben was
[1:27:53] preaching on how we have to be empty and
[1:27:55] willing for god to fill us so we got to
[1:27:58] be that god forward we allow god to fill
[1:28:00] us in with his life and when he fills us
[1:28:03] in we know we will be solid and we can
[1:28:06] crush each and every wave we can crash
[1:28:08] through each and every storm nothing can
[1:28:11] stand why that was god's strategy god
[1:28:14] knew what he was doing amen so it
[1:28:16] doesn't matter what storm it is a storm
[1:28:18] of disease comes your way a storm of
[1:28:21] depression a financial storm you got a
[1:28:24] work place storm
[1:28:26] family storms that's going on it doesn't
[1:28:28] matter internal storms
[1:28:30] god has already if he is in your life he
[1:28:33] has you sealed he knows you will float
[1:28:36] on all those storms you will float on
[1:28:38] all those floods and nothing will sink
[1:28:40] you god will keep you he said i've never
[1:28:44] lost
[1:28:45] all of them that you've given to me so
[1:28:47] he has kept you he will keep you if you
[1:28:50] just stand on his word and say what you
[1:28:53] do
[1:28:54] and say
[1:28:55] and do what he says you do amen because
[1:28:59] god we know we serve a god who is a
[1:29:00] master strategist amen
[1:29:02] so you might not understand what he's
[1:29:04] doing but just do it anyhow he knows
[1:29:06] what he's doing he is the five-star
[1:29:08] general that's in our corner amen
[1:29:11] hallelujah we know he led moses and the
[1:29:14] children of israel
[1:29:16] they were just going they did not know
[1:29:17] where they were going then they realized
[1:29:20] we in front of us there's a sea at our
[1:29:22] right these mountains at our left there
[1:29:24] is a mountain and desert and behind
[1:29:27] pharaoh's army is coming they had no
[1:29:29] idea what was going on
[1:29:31] and the egyptians thought wow
[1:29:34] their god is really a poor strategist
[1:29:37] but god knew what he was doing he was
[1:29:39] setting a trap so he could annihilate
[1:29:43] all the egyptians all the pharaohs army
[1:29:46] and everything but when the israelites
[1:29:48] were looking they started crying lord
[1:29:51] what are we going to do moses forgot
[1:29:53] even the miracles that god had done
[1:29:55] through him
[1:29:57] and he is standing right there he has
[1:29:58] nothing to say but god said just stand
[1:30:01] still and see the hand of god when you
[1:30:04] open that sea and the children of israel
[1:30:06] went when pharaoh's army tried to follow
[1:30:09] they were all flooded why because that
[1:30:11] was the result of god's master plan so
[1:30:14] his plan for your life never fails just
[1:30:17] know he is the master he is the master
[1:30:19] strategist he will never fail you
[1:30:23] he made gideon to win a battle
[1:30:26] with only 300 men something that had
[1:30:29] never happened before he gave them a
[1:30:31] strategy and that strategy worked
[1:30:33] although it looked ridiculous or it made
[1:30:36] no sense but god knew what he was doing
[1:30:39] the walls of jericho fell by a shout we
[1:30:42] have never heard of any walls falling by
[1:30:45] shouting but god knew what he was doing
[1:30:48] and they just circled around and all
[1:30:50] they did was shout and they got victory
[1:30:52] why they were listening to god's
[1:30:54] strategy they were listening to what god
[1:30:56] has said
[1:30:57] and samson we know samson killed
[1:31:00] a thousand philistines with a job on
[1:31:02] from an ass
[1:31:04] this is because why he was using god's
[1:31:07] strategy
[1:31:08] in george's 15 15 it says
[1:31:13] samson
[1:31:14] he had a new job on
[1:31:17] i used to think that it was a dried-up
[1:31:19] job and that he just found wherever that
[1:31:20] was he was lying but then the bible says
[1:31:24] he found a new job on can you project um
[1:31:28] georges 15 15 if you can please
[1:31:39] judges chapter 15
[1:31:41] it says that um
[1:31:44] samson he saw when he was being attacked
[1:31:47] by the field by the philistines he saw a
[1:31:50] new job on so i was just in when i was
[1:31:53] starting i was just thinking
[1:31:54] how a job of of a dead animal that's
[1:31:58] laying right there how can it become new
[1:32:01] how could it be new and if it's from a
[1:32:04] dead animal that's dead and gone if it
[1:32:07] is lying there
[1:32:08] then it should have come from a dead
[1:32:10] animal and it cannot be new but the
[1:32:12] bible says it was a new job on so god
[1:32:16] made that job on for him
[1:32:18] he knew that samson was going to need it
[1:32:21] he opened the way he knew that samson
[1:32:23] was going to need to possess the gates
[1:32:26] of his enemy and he says and he found in
[1:32:29] a new job on of an ass and put it and
[1:32:32] put forth his hand and took it and slew
[1:32:35] a thousand men there with it
[1:32:37] so god made a custom-made job on for
[1:32:40] samson
[1:32:42] because he knew samson was going to need
[1:32:44] that victory he knew that samson needed
[1:32:46] to possess the gates of his enemy so he
[1:32:49] laid he laid that job on right there and
[1:32:52] when samson picked it up that was a
[1:32:55] predestinated weapon that he had to use
[1:32:58] for him to overcome amen and he was
[1:33:01] under god's commission to possess all
[1:33:03] the gates of the enemy and he slew all
[1:33:05] those 1000 philistines and he brought
[1:33:08] victory into the camp of the israelites
[1:33:12] because he was acting on god's
[1:33:14] god's commission
[1:33:16] so now faith is a personal revelation
[1:33:18] that god gives to you to overcome
[1:33:20] whatever battle you have god gives you
[1:33:23] faith to come out of it god gives you
[1:33:25] faith for you to get healed that's a
[1:33:27] custom-made weapon no one else has the
[1:33:30] same revelation as you have for whatever
[1:33:32] situation you have so don't listen to
[1:33:34] men listen to what god is telling you
[1:33:37] because whatever he's telling you that's
[1:33:39] that weapon he has created to see you
[1:33:41] will overcome through that
[1:33:43] so and he allows you to come through him
[1:33:47] anytime 24 7 when he rant when he rent
[1:33:50] that curtain that went into the holy of
[1:33:52] holies he was opening up making free
[1:33:55] access so that you and me we can walk in
[1:33:58] at any time of the day whenever we are
[1:34:01] in need we can walk in through into the
[1:34:03] holy of holies and he will give us
[1:34:06] victory and he can give us our harsh
[1:34:08] desires
[1:34:09] if only we have faith to know that he
[1:34:12] can do it for us so all these people
[1:34:14] were talking about god delivered them
[1:34:16] because they were abraham's seed they
[1:34:19] had abraham's blood running in their
[1:34:22] veins what about you and me amen
[1:34:25] at temple of jesus christ we are housing
[1:34:28] jesus inside of us when you receive the
[1:34:30] holy ghost you are housing jesus
[1:34:33] himself within you if he did it for them
[1:34:37] then why can't he do it for you
[1:34:39] why can't you overcome and possess the
[1:34:41] gates of your enemies god can give that
[1:34:43] to you
[1:34:44] because you are abraham's seed through
[1:34:48] jesus christ and you have him dwelling
[1:34:50] in within you
[1:34:52] amen amen
[1:34:54] we know
[1:34:55] 2 000 years ago
[1:34:57] jesus came down and he was the promised
[1:34:59] seed of abraham that jesus that god gave
[1:35:02] to abraham although isaac was just a
[1:35:04] shadow isaac was there he was the seed
[1:35:07] of abraham but jesus was
[1:35:09] promised son that god was promising to
[1:35:10] abraham
[1:35:12] you know he possessed the gates of satan
[1:35:15] by the word when he was tempted by satan
[1:35:18] on all counts
[1:35:20] satan will come and try and tempt you
[1:35:22] with the word
[1:35:23] because he knows
[1:35:25] if you are a matured christian you do
[1:35:27] not even have the thirst for alcohol
[1:35:29] he's not even going to bring that to you
[1:35:31] but he's going to bring you the word and
[1:35:34] try to to to confuse everything on do
[1:35:37] about the word with you that's what he
[1:35:38] did with eve
[1:35:40] he came and he just changed the word
[1:35:42] because he knew that's that's where they
[1:35:43] were standing on when he came to jesus
[1:35:46] he tried to misconstrue the word and
[1:35:48] says you are the son of god if you do
[1:35:50] this
[1:35:51] you can create bread but jesus knew he
[1:35:54] says no this is not my time yet and he
[1:35:57] overcame he possessed the gate of the
[1:35:59] enemy by saying the spoken word amen
[1:36:02] amen
[1:36:03] and we know the one final time he did
[1:36:07] possess the gate of the enemy was when
[1:36:09] he went on the cross of calvary
[1:36:13] that was the greatest victories of them
[1:36:15] all
[1:36:16] when he walked right there
[1:36:18] we know when he was in the garden of
[1:36:19] gethsemane and he was thinking he was
[1:36:22] right there he was going
[1:36:24] he was undergoing through a lot of
[1:36:26] stress
[1:36:27] and he was praying until they say he had
[1:36:31] a he had sweat of blood
[1:36:33] his flesh was telling him
[1:36:35] i can't do this
[1:36:37] but in his spirit he knew if i don't go
[1:36:39] then who is going to go
[1:36:41] he knew there was victories to be worn
[1:36:44] he knew there was you to be healed
[1:36:46] he knew there was you to be delivered
[1:36:49] there was you to be saved that's why he
[1:36:51] was there he said lord if i could let
[1:36:54] this pass pass me by but while she was
[1:36:57] right there he saw you
[1:36:59] he saw you he saw me and then he said
[1:37:01] but nevertheless
[1:37:03] let your will be done i will go through
[1:37:06] and i will do it because he had you
[1:37:08] and me on his mind and he said i am
[1:37:11] going to
[1:37:13] come through and possess the gate of the
[1:37:15] enemy one last time
[1:37:17] once and for all and it is done that's
[1:37:20] why when he pressed through he was
[1:37:22] beaten and he went through all that
[1:37:25] but then when he came to the cross of
[1:37:27] calvary and he said it is finished what
[1:37:29] was he talking about he was talking
[1:37:31] about all your battles he was talking
[1:37:33] about all your situations all your
[1:37:36] sicknesses all your depression
[1:37:38] everything you were going to go through
[1:37:39] he said it is finished amen and then
[1:37:42] when he said it is finished and then he
[1:37:44] died afterwards that was not the end of
[1:37:47] the story we know he went down
[1:37:50] into the gates of hell and he went down
[1:37:52] to possess those gates and the prophet
[1:37:55] of god says but one day one glorious day
[1:37:58] the royal seat of abraham born of a
[1:38:00] virgin when he walked earth he was a
[1:38:03] true seed of abraham
[1:38:05] he possessed the gate of sickness of the
[1:38:07] people he possessed the gate of
[1:38:09] affliction all in the garden of
[1:38:11] gethsemane in the court that morning he
[1:38:13] possessed the gates of temptation he was
[1:38:15] tempted to let go but he said no i am
[1:38:18] going to go through because he had you
[1:38:20] and me on his mind
[1:38:21] and he died down at the cross
[1:38:24] hell taken his pressure sold the bible
[1:38:26] said his soul descended into hell
[1:38:28] that's exactly right he captured his
[1:38:30] soul and took him down there but brother
[1:38:33] on that third day he possessed the gates
[1:38:34] of death hell and the grave and rose up
[1:38:37] the third day
[1:38:38] and overcome it all he took sickness he
[1:38:41] took death hell and the grave and
[1:38:43] everything
[1:38:44] and he jerked off that that gate and
[1:38:46] tonight you and me we are more than
[1:38:48] conquerors while his seat shall possess
[1:38:50] the gaze of the enemy
[1:38:52] he possessed each and every gate he
[1:38:55] conquered every sickness he conquered
[1:38:57] every sin so there is no sin that can
[1:39:00] trouble you there's no sickness there's
[1:39:02] no disease that can trouble you why
[1:39:03] because he conquered everything he
[1:39:05] conquered hell he conquered the grave
[1:39:08] and he possessed that gate of them all
[1:39:10] and we are in him more than conquerors
[1:39:13] you know death has a stinger
[1:39:16] so it went and it stung him when satan
[1:39:18] was trying to kill him you know a b when
[1:39:21] a b stings once that's it he doesn't
[1:39:24] have more than one stinger so death lost
[1:39:27] its thing when it
[1:39:29] when jesus overcame it so now death does
[1:39:32] not have no hold on you
[1:39:34] sickness does not have no hold in you
[1:39:37] satan have no hold on you he cannot do
[1:39:40] nothing to you why because jesus took
[1:39:42] that sting away so satan can buzz around
[1:39:45] as much as he wants but he is as
[1:39:49] he is as harmless as harmless as could
[1:39:51] be he can do you no harm because jesus
[1:39:54] possessed the gate he took away that
[1:39:57] stinger so that when satan comes to you
[1:39:59] he is powerless he cannot do nothing to
[1:40:02] you he says but you know what when one
[1:40:04] of them beats every anchor he's stinging
[1:40:06] real deep he pulls that singer out and
[1:40:08] brother when he sucked his stinger into
[1:40:10] that flesh that wasn't a man he anchored
[1:40:13] his flesh in emmanuel and when he did he
[1:40:16] pulled that stinger out
[1:40:18] i tell you abraham said now he can buzz
[1:40:21] and make a noise but he does not have no
[1:40:24] sting
[1:40:25] one of them coming to his death said
[1:40:28] oh death where is thy sting
[1:40:30] grave where is thy victory but thanks be
[1:40:34] to god who gives us the victory through
[1:40:36] our lord jesus christ amen so satan he
[1:40:39] can buzz he can make a big noise he can
[1:40:42] fuss he can pull you to the hospital put
[1:40:45] you into the hospital tell the doctor
[1:40:47] standing right there morning and crying
[1:40:49] but you look at them right straight in
[1:40:50] the face and say death where is thy
[1:40:53] stinger
[1:40:54] amen because when he came he possessed
[1:40:57] the gates of all the enemies he
[1:40:59] possessed all of them so all you and me
[1:41:02] have to do is just to walk right
[1:41:04] straight through them because he did it
[1:41:06] for you and me so
[1:41:08] he gave us the victory all we just have
[1:41:10] to do is walk up
[1:41:12] claim it and say it is in god's covenant
[1:41:15] and god will give the victory god will
[1:41:17] be able to heal you god will be able to
[1:41:20] take you out of depression why because
[1:41:23] he stands on his word
[1:41:24] his covenant never fails amen so we
[1:41:28] gotta use and stand on the word to
[1:41:30] possess all the gates of the enemy amen
[1:41:34] let's stand up on our feet
