[11:34] we appreciate the Lord Jesus for being
[11:38] good to us appreciate our brother these
[11:42] powerful playing
[11:48] appreciate our brother Frank for doing
[11:50] such a great job he's getting better all

[11:59] I'm know he's getting the American
[12:00] accent I mean that's wonderful God is
[12:08] good to us as we stand always good to
[12:13] see brother Neil remember the mic and
[12:16] all we love you appreciate all of you I
[12:21] am in expectation of a change a change
[12:28] of the body we know that by God's grace
[12:32] we are fighting the last battle and I'm
[12:40] so glad to be part of it most people
[12:45] don't even know that time is up and
[12:49] everything is winding down a winding out
[12:53] but Satan is a busy adversary he knows
[12:58] how to distract us and make us think
[13:01] that we have a lot of time time to spare
[13:05] but the Bible according to Zechariah I
[13:08] believe says when the vision has been
[13:09] made plain when it's made clear let him
[13:12] that read it run not walk run and this
[13:17] is a time amen we ought to be putting
[13:20] forth our best effort now we can't save
[13:23] ourselves but we ought to show God just
[13:26] how much we appreciate his salvation
[13:29] Romans four please we're gonna run point
[13:32] Romans four and then from there to
[13:34] Hebrews six Romans four beginning at the
[13:39] 13th verse we'll read down to the 25th
[13:42] verse and then we're gonna do Hebrews
[13:45] 6:13 2 through 21
[13:49] we still have been studying the Hebrew
[13:51] series I will encourage every one of you
[13:54] who have access to the messages to
[13:57] really listen it has been a quite a next
[14:01] and I have not finished or completed
[14:04] what I've been studying I've read the
[14:06] book I've in the past but it seemed like
[14:09] God has anointed the pages or the words
[14:12] on these books on this book these
[14:14] subjects I am grateful for the grace of
[14:25] God Romans 4 beginning at the 13th verse
[14:31] for the promise that he should be the
[14:34] heir of the world was not to Abraham or
[14:38] to his seed though the law through I'm
[14:45] sorry let me read that again for the
[14:47] promise that he should be the heir of
[14:50] the world was not to Abraham or to his
[14:52] seed through the law but through the
[14:54] righteousness of faith but if they which
[14:57] are the law be heirs faith is not is
[15:00] made void and the promise made of none
[15:03] effect because the law worketh wrath for
[15:07] there is no law but for that where no
[15:09] law is there is no transgression
[15:11] therefore it is of faith that it might
[15:14] be by grace to the end of the promise
[15:16] might be sure to all the seed not to
[15:20] that only which is of the law but to
[15:23] that which also which is of the faith of
[15:27] Abraham who is the father of us all as
[15:30] it is written I have made thee a father
[15:32] of many nations before him whom he plead
[15:36] even God who quickeneth the dead and
[15:40] calleth those things would be not as
[15:42] though they were who against hope
[15:45] believed in hope that he might become
[15:47] the father of many nations according to
[15:50] that which was spoken so shall thy seed
[15:53] be and being not weak in faith he
[15:56] considered not his own body now did when
[16:00] he was about an hundred years old
[16:02] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb
[16:06] he staggered not at the promise of God
[16:08] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[16:11] giving glory to God and being full
[16:14] we persuaded that what he had promised
[16:18] he was able also to perform I love that
[16:21] and therefore it was imputed to him for
[16:24] righteousness imputed means to be
[16:27] charged to him now it was not written
[16:29] for his sake alone that it was imputed
[16:32] to him but for us also to whom it shall
[16:36] be imputed if we believe on him that
[16:39] raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead
[16:42] who was delivered for our offenses and
[16:45] was raised again for our justification
[16:49] that's about four or five services right
[16:52] there Hebrews 6:13 through 21 God is
[17:03] more than able I want to say that the
[17:08] meetings this weekend has been canceled
[17:10] because of the weather conditions but
[17:13] we're going to reschedule them so bear
[17:16] that in mind I don't know how bad the
[17:19] weekend as a whole will be but the
[17:24] meetings with brother Andrew has been
[17:25] counseled he had to cancel his flights
[17:28] coming because we're coming in on on
[17:33] Friday but we will if the law permit and
[17:37] weather permit we will be having Sunday
[17:38] service twice here all right let's start
[17:43] Hebrew 613 to 21 when God made promised
[17:48] to Abraham because he could swear by no
[17:50] greater he swear by himself saying
[17:54] surely blessings I will bless thee and
[17:57] multiplying I will multiply thee and so
[18:01] after he had patiently endured he
[18:03] obtained the promise for men verily
[18:06] swear by the greater and oath for
[18:08] confirmation is to them and in of all
[18:11] strife wherein God willingly willing
[18:14] more abundantly to show unto the air of
[18:17] promise the immutability of his counsel
[18:19] confirmed it by an oath that by two
[18:22] immutable things in which it was
[18:25] impossible for God to lie we might have
[18:28] strong consolation who have fled for
[18:30] refuge to lay hold upon the hope set
[18:33] before us which hope we have as an
[18:36] anchor of the soul both sure and
[18:39] steadfast and which interest into that
[18:42] within the veil for me excuse me the
[18:46] forerunner is for us entered even Jesus
[18:49] made an high priest forever after the
[18:52] order of their kids are dead let us pray
[18:56] father God we thank you for your grace
[18:58] and your mercy Lord we steal Oh God
[19:02] working with the man Christ Jesus Lord
[19:05] we know that there are so many things
[19:08] and so many facets that we could use
[19:10] Lord under this topic but I pray father
[19:13] God that what would be ministered
[19:16] tonight will be such a blessing to the
[19:18] people that they will walk out of here
[19:20] or tonight knowing that they have been
[19:23] set free totally free whether it be
[19:27] visible now our non not visible we know
[19:31] by faith Lord God we we obtain these
[19:34] things and so we thank you Father God
[19:37] for the finish and complete work of your
[19:40] salvation that has been brought to us
[19:43] through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[19:45] father we thank you for your grace and
[19:47] your mercy in Jesus Christ's name we
[19:49] pray amen you may be seated I know a lot
[19:56] of us were in great expectation for
[19:58] anticipation and expectation for the
[20:01] weekend but the airline's called well he
[20:07] called the airlines because I I called
[20:09] him and he called the airlines and they
[20:11] told him that because of the storm that
[20:13] was coming that he would more than
[20:15] likely not be able to make his flight so
[20:17] we didn't want him to be stranded or put
[20:20] in a position where he loses his ticket
[20:23] cuz we want him to come and so by God's
[20:26] grace he was able he takes me back I'm
[20:29] talking about brother Andrew takes me
[20:32] back and said that he was able to keep
[20:34] his tickets and he just got to make some
[20:37] future arrangements by God's grace we
[20:40] will keep it in that order in which we
[20:43] already presented it in and hopefully by
[20:47] God's grace we'll be able to follow it
[20:51] through when that date and time come God
[20:54] is good to us and all I could think
[20:57] about today even today because I know
[21:01] some of us have been really going
[21:02] through some tremendous battles if you
[21:05] haven't been going through tremendous
[21:07] battles well perhaps I say it like this
[21:09] I have been going through my battles and
[21:11] perhaps some of yours too
[21:12] but nevertheless amen we know that God
[21:15] is more than able I serve a God who is
[21:19] real and if you expect to serve God in
[21:23] in this light without battles without
[21:27] disappointments without God telling you
[21:30] why you are mistaken because God is not
[21:34] going to always tell you why things
[21:36] happen but we do want know one thing and
[21:39] that is that God has is answering our
[21:42] prayer we ask God Lord let us be just
[21:47] like you and so therefore God the Holy
[21:50] Spirit is working on your behalf it
[21:53] happen to perfect you amen Paul says one
[21:57] thing I love appalled Paul says I have
[21:59] learned how to be content in whatever
[22:05] state I find myself in now you gotta
[22:09] realize that Paul went through a lot of
[22:11] things matter of fact he had been killed
[22:14] three times and resurrected three times
[22:16] now I don't know about you but one time
[22:19] would have been enough for me
[22:20] nevertheless Paul says I have been dead
[22:23] they told me I was dead and God raised
[22:26] me up to kill me again and raised me up
[22:28] to kill me again so you got to realize
[22:33] hey man that we go through hard tires
[22:35] and hard tests and Paul had to go
[22:39] through those particular situations
[22:41] because and then God wanted to keep him
[22:44] down low Paul God even gave Paul a thorn
[22:49] in his flesh historian historian says
[22:52] that it was his eye because remember
[22:55] when he
[22:55] the pillar of fire on the way way to
[22:57] Damascus amen that light blinded him and
[23:01] he from that point on he had an issue
[23:02] with his I read according to the Word of
[23:05] God there were those who said to Paul
[23:07] listen we would give you Paul said you
[23:09] would have given me your own eye he
[23:12] would have plucked them out and who you
[23:14] would have given them to me you
[23:15] considered me as the Lord Jesus himself
[23:17] so you see Paul that Christ was such has
[23:21] such oneness amen even then that the
[23:24] people thought like they do today
[23:27] he was Jesus but Paul says listen is not
[23:31] I I'm not Jesus I'm just here to reflect
[23:34] him I want you to understand that I can
[23:37] I am nothing and everything that I have
[23:40] achieved has been because of Jesus
[23:43] Christ I have a subject tonight
[23:46] perfectly in love with us you know
[23:51] because a lot of times we think that
[23:53] that we judge God like a man and we
[23:57] think that God falls out of love with us
[24:00] God can never fall out of love with you
[24:04] that's why Paul said who shall separate
[24:08] us from the love of God see what gonna
[24:10] separate us who can separate us nothing
[24:13] can separate you from the love of Christ
[24:16] once you are in Christ
[24:19] oh come on somebody now we talked about
[24:22] going beyond the veil of your flesh
[24:25] because this is why I read our Abraham
[24:29] the Bible tells us that Abraham had a
[24:31] promise from God
[24:33] and Abraham was old when the promise
[24:36] first came and he was older when God
[24:41] came to fulfill the promise because when
[24:44] God made the promise to Abraham Sarah
[24:46] wounds was dead that means her
[24:49] reproduction system was no longer
[24:52] working had it even been working it
[24:55] still would have not been any good to
[24:58] Abraham because it worked when she was
[25:01] young but we find out that God withheld
[25:05] children from Sarah nothing was wrong
[25:09] with Abraham
[25:09] remember cuz Abraham was able to produce
[25:12] Ishmael with Hagar but when it came to
[25:17] Sarah how something was wrong with her
[25:19] so when God changed her when God brought
[25:23] her back
[25:24] amen to a young person y'all believe
[25:26] that Amen we know what the world says
[25:29] she was old 97 years old I 80 something
[25:31] years old you know old grandma but there
[25:34] was a mystery in there that God hid from
[25:37] the eyes of the wise and the prudent
[25:40] matter-of-fact Amen God showed that
[25:43] there's something had taken place with
[25:45] Sarah because there was a king in Egypt
[25:49] that loved Sarah at first sight and
[25:52] wanted to marry her and God had to
[25:55] interrupt the situation amen because
[25:58] Abraham who was the father of Nations
[26:01] lied to the king and said this is my
[26:04] sister now he there's no such thing as a
[26:07] little white lie a lie is a lie no
[26:10] matter which color it comes in so you
[26:13] got to realize by God's grace amen that
[26:15] this is a lie yes she was part his
[26:18] sister but he needed to say this is my
[26:22] wife now think about the kind of a man
[26:24] because I want you to understand that
[26:26] because you saved doesn't mean you don't
[26:29] make mistakes and because you are
[26:31] elected doesn't mean that you don't get
[26:33] in trouble
[26:35] hallelujah but who's gonna lay any
[26:37] charge to God's elect no one now let me
[26:42] go on by God's grace because some of
[26:43] y'all faces are scaring me you and I
[26:46] must realize by God's grace that we are
[26:49] in a position that you must learn and
[26:51] you must know who you are he's a God
[26:56] Savior or he didn't he's a God is in you
[26:59] or he's not right you must know because
[27:03] Jesus said in that day you'll know that
[27:06] I am in the father the father's in me
[27:08] and I am in you hallelujah
[27:11] but God so loved the world this is what
[27:14] I love about it because you know we're
[27:16] living in an age now where people say so
[27:18] love or so hate that's a new phrase so
[27:22] putting so
[27:23] before because there's a time when you
[27:26] would not have been able to get away
[27:28] with that type of language but in this
[27:30] day it's a soul and I always think is
[27:33] this the age that God is so loving us
[27:37] because this is the age that is the most
[27:39] wicked the most evil age of every age
[27:42] and there is nothing you can do to
[27:46] deliver yourself there's nothing you can
[27:49] do he meant to save yourself
[27:52] oh come on somebody you and I must
[27:54] realize by God but yaha we must go
[27:56] beyond this veil hallelujah
[28:00] you said why are you saying it like that
[28:02] there is a veil and we're talking about
[28:05] a heavenly veil but right now we're
[28:06] talking about a fleshly veil this veil
[28:09] that you're working with is the flesh
[28:11] this flesh a man is condemned this flesh
[28:15] is the flesh that keeps you from seeing
[28:19] in the other dimension if you didn't
[28:22] have this flesh you would be standing in
[28:25] your theophany and in your theophany you
[28:28] would know all things but why are you in
[28:31] this flesh it veils the Angels that are
[28:35] now sitting in this place it veils the
[28:37] presence of the Lord Jesus Christ you
[28:39] don't know that the Bible said were two
[28:41] or three are gathered in his name there
[28:44] he is in the midst but you and I can't
[28:47] see him because of this fleshly veil
[28:50] because this veil amen hinders you it
[28:54] stops you from being the kind of person
[28:56] you want to be hallelujah it stops you
[28:59] from being holy sometime it stopped you
[29:02] from being sanctified sometime it is
[29:04] your greatest enemy hallelujah but when
[29:09] it came to Abraham Abraham was ninety
[29:13] something years old and the Bible said
[29:15] he considered not his own body
[29:17] hallelujah he did not care about the
[29:21] veil that he was living in his faith was
[29:24] able to go beyond that veil and call
[29:27] those things that be not as though they
[29:30] were y'all understand what I'm going
[29:32] with
[29:33] this veil right now is getting older
[29:36] mine is it's getting older that the
[29:38] wrinkles and the hair is falling out and
[29:40] everything else but beyond this veil
[29:43] beyond this veil they meant there is
[29:46] another world Amen that has been didn't
[29:49] been been built for you and I but while
[29:52] I'm in this veil I'm not gonna live
[29:55] according to the veil is that right the
[30:01] Bible says there's no condemnation to
[30:03] those who walk not after the flesh but
[30:05] after the spirit
[30:06] hallelujah so it is our ability there is
[30:10] an ability that you and I must tap into
[30:13] our how can I say lion let me say right
[30:15] there is a way for us to walk in the
[30:18] spirit and not in the flesh
[30:21] hallelujah for an example if the doctor
[30:24] says you've got cancer hallelujah
[30:28] hallelujah but your soul says I am Who I
[30:34] am perfect is that right
[30:37] even the prophet of God said if you can
[30:40] vision yourself as perfect or if you can
[30:44] vision yourself as being healed all you
[30:47] got to do is walk walk into the vision
[30:51] walk into what you see and it will come
[30:54] to pass hallelujah that's the world that
[30:58] you and I must learn how to live in the
[31:01] Bible says we are now living in heavenly
[31:04] places in Christ Jesus who you but this
[31:10] veil is what we are allowing we are
[31:13] allowing this veil to blind us to keep
[31:17] us from seeing the promises of God
[31:19] hallelujah but when a promise is made
[31:23] the inner man says yay to the Word of
[31:26] God it doesn't go by the veil or in it
[31:31] doesn't work amen according to this
[31:33] dimension it works according to the
[31:36] dimension that we're now sitting in
[31:38] which is in that sixth dimension Oh
[31:41] glory to God that's what happened to
[31:44] Abraham and the Bible tells us that
[31:46] Sarah receives
[31:49] you see because one thing about one
[31:52] thing about seeing somebody else stands
[31:54] in faith it seemed to help you pull up
[31:58] amen into a position where you can have
[32:02] faith yourself you say explain this to
[32:04] me
[32:05] David who had the faith of God not only
[32:09] did he have the faith of God but his
[32:11] faith was so alive
[32:13] it was anointed and here was those other
[32:18] Israelites who was afraid of Goliath but
[32:23] once they saw David defeat Goliath it
[32:27] quickened their faith and they ran after
[32:30] the Philistines hallelujah that's why
[32:33] it's so important to know where you're
[32:37] standing I love this because the Bible
[32:41] tells us that we have an anchor of the
[32:44] soul can I say it like this most of us
[32:48] fail because we believe that God has
[32:52] charged us with some kind of sin we feel
[32:58] defeated we feel like a hypocrite
[33:02] because we're forever thinking that God
[33:05] works according to our standard but the
[33:10] Bible said that in that while we were
[33:12] yet sinners Christ died for us is that
[33:16] right now I'm not telling you this is
[33:19] what the Bible said shall we continue in
[33:21] sin that grace may abound god forbid but
[33:25] let me ask you something when Peter had
[33:28] denied Christ and swore three times is
[33:32] there anywhere in the Bible he repented
[33:37] no there is not in there hah
[33:40] cuz God had already justified him God
[33:43] had already seen what he was gonna do
[33:45] God had already told him what he was
[33:47] gonna do hallelujah and God to show you
[33:51] that the devil had nothing over Peter
[33:53] when Jesus raised from the dead he told
[33:56] his disciples whatever you do go get him
[34:00] God didn't say you grabbed
[34:02] did you won't be the speaker on the day
[34:05] of Pentecost God never took away his
[34:08] commission he kept his commission in
[34:12] spite of his failures hallelujah
[34:15] yeah you wouldn't say look at David
[34:18] David you know in Bathsheba but God
[34:21] never took the kingship away from David
[34:24] and David repented so I want you to
[34:30] understand don't you think you're gonna
[34:31] do sin and I can't get away with it but
[34:34] the one thing about those who are chosen
[34:35] and elected by God when you do sin God
[34:38] gonna spank you just ensures your name
[34:43] you get it but he can't destroy you
[34:47] hallelujah
[34:48] you'll get it but he can't put you away
[34:51] somebody help me here here hallelujah
[34:54] because you gotta realize by God's grace
[34:56] we have an anchor of the soul what is
[35:01] that your faith in the work of the
[35:04] resurrected Lord Jesus Christ because
[35:07] the Bible said he has gone beyond the
[35:10] veil and because he's gone beyond the
[35:13] veil we have an anchor of the soul
[35:15] because when he went there you and I
[35:18] went there too hallelujah come on a
[35:23] promise oftentimes you know you feel so
[35:29] rejected and you know what I think to
[35:31] myself I says you know God can keep you
[35:33] in every thing he wants to keep you in
[35:36] but sometimes he just doesn't he just
[35:38] won't do it he lets the devil do
[35:42] whatever he wants to do sometimes right
[35:44] to see whether you gonna get up to see
[35:49] whether what you're going to do in your
[35:53] situation and the Bible tells us that we
[35:57] all say in all things give things but we
[36:01] have a little problem and you know what
[36:03] we do you understand me we fail to see
[36:09] that it's all under control god don't
[36:14] beat Satan is not perfect but God is you
[36:20] understand me listen it is that flesh
[36:23] y'all know it is it right am i right on
[36:26] this and your body is to think this
[36:28] thing that keeps you from praying from
[36:31] worship from serving the Lord like you
[36:34] want to hallelujah let's call it
[36:38] all-night prayer and your flesh is
[36:42] already says no and it gives all kind of
[36:47] excuses why you can't right but you see
[36:50] that's nothing
[36:52] I'm not prayers not hard cuz once you
[36:55] get in the spirit you don't even know
[36:56] your time you lose time but I'm not
[37:00] gonna call an all-night prayer but I
[37:01] just thought I'd throw that one out you
[37:03] and I must understand the veil is what
[37:07] keeps us from seeing God face to face
[37:11] hallelujah it's true even in this church
[37:15] if God is in here why can't we see him
[37:19] he's here the angel of the Lord is here
[37:24] is that right you and I must understand
[37:28] because you are God's property he cannot
[37:32] afford to leave you alone he will never
[37:36] leave you alone even when you're doing
[37:40] wrong he's standing right there watching
[37:42] you oh nothing but the truth
[37:45] he didn't come over there oh well eyes
[37:49] though he didn't know he was right there
[37:52] he saw it and God is right there you
[37:57] said I don't he's just as they're just
[37:59] as shoes is you breathing he's there
[38:03] hallelujah the veil is what keeps us
[38:05] from seeing the angels at their position
[38:08] this morning or this even is standing by
[38:10] the seats and we don't even know that
[38:13] when you wake up God is standing right
[38:14] there by your bed and he's right there
[38:19] when you say Lord I pray later he's
[38:23] right there
[38:24] hallelujah but this veil keep
[38:27] less from seeing him this veil is what
[38:30] keeps us from seeing him we are here
[38:33] behind the veil and that veil is the
[38:35] flesh and we are sons and daughters of
[38:38] God we're in the presence of God see you
[38:40] K you can't get out of the president of
[38:43] God once you in the presence of God you
[38:46] understand me I'm talked about in Christ
[38:48] when you're in college you're always in
[38:50] Christ hallelujah now if you walk out to
[38:54] the flesh he stays up on the limb but
[38:56] let me tell you something is he still in
[38:58] you he don't just leave he said he could
[39:02] even I'll never leave you nor will I
[39:05] forsake you but the anointing the
[39:09] election doesn't change you understand
[39:13] me it doesn't matter I want to say it
[39:17] that right way we make mistakes all the
[39:19] time my children make mistakes all the
[39:21] time but no matter how many mistakes
[39:23] they make they're my children
[39:25] so is it with the sons and daughters of
[39:28] God no matter how many mistakes you make
[39:31] amen
[39:32] you still God's children let me ask good
[39:35] question
[39:35] I know many times I said like this when
[39:38] I first got saved that's all praise God
[39:40] when I get the Holy Ghost I'm gonna be
[39:41] perfect but you know I thought I'd never
[39:44] make mistake
[39:46] and when I did it was devastating hello
[39:53] and I failed to see that was what the
[39:56] blood was all about remember I said last
[40:00] week that that word comforta is the same
[40:05] word advocate and the Bible said we have
[40:09] advocate with the father so the
[40:12] confident is that advocate he's that
[40:14] jury he's that georgy the attorney who
[40:17] stands in your behalf every time you
[40:19] make a mistake so that you can
[40:21] understand he's never lost a case so
[40:29] every time you make a mistake that real
[40:32] are true sons and daughters of God gonna
[40:34] say Lord forgive me hallelujah they're
[40:37] not gonna wait for the next day they're
[40:39] go right there
[40:40] very next moment Lord forgive me I'm
[40:43] sorry you understand me
[40:46] that's the working of the real Holy
[40:47] Ghost help me Jesus so you and I can
[40:52] understand you said well brother what
[40:53] are you saying
[40:54] maybe this is not deep enough but I'm
[40:56] gonna tell you something my thing is
[40:58] this if we can get a hold to who God is
[41:02] and what God has done for us here to
[41:04] take away your days of sadness you
[41:06] realize that this we should never
[41:08] be sad we should always be in the joy of
[41:10] the Lord first of all we must always
[41:13] trust him and when we find ourselves in
[41:16] situations valleys that's what David
[41:18] said that though I walk through the
[41:20] valley of shadow of death I'll fear no
[41:22] evil that man a man was in the Old
[41:25] Testament we're in the new we're here
[41:28] with Christ in us not just with us in us
[41:31] and you and I must we must understand
[41:35] that every time Satan takes our smiles
[41:37] and bring him to his foul he accuses us
[41:39] before God every time you love the Lord
[41:45] we're sons and daughters of God we're in
[41:48] the presence of God oh my angels of God
[41:51] are encamped about those who fear Him
[41:53] y'all believe that we're in the presence
[41:55] of Lord and a design kept about us it's
[42:01] true whether you know it or not that's
[42:05] why our behaviors should be different
[42:08] all help us Jesus I'm gonna say
[42:12] something in just a moment did you not
[42:15] know that the behavior how could I say
[42:21] it the behavior of Christ is this person
[42:29] the behavior of Christ is his person
[42:35] because his person has only one way of
[42:40] behavior and his behavior is holiness
[42:46] whatever falls on the holiness that is
[42:49] the behavior of Christ so for us to say
[42:53] that we
[42:54] Christ on the inside and the behavior is
[43:00] not there then we ought to examine
[43:02] ourselves as Paul say and see whether we
[43:05] be in the faith
[43:07] help us Lord oh we got to pray nowadays
[43:13] that your faith don't fail because right
[43:16] now that's what's happening with a lot
[43:18] of people their faith is failing because
[43:19] they don't understand that once let me
[43:22] say like this once saved is always saved
[43:28] that's the truth if God saved you you
[43:34] can never be lost if God saved you you
[43:42] can never be lost and how God seals that
[43:47] in you by he seals that promise of
[43:51] salvation in you by the Holy Ghost
[43:55] that's why we call it the seal of
[43:58] promise remember last week I think I
[44:04] talked about this but remember the
[44:07] preacher who ended up becoming a
[44:09] drunkard and he says oh I don't know I'm
[44:12] not gonna preach anymore and he started
[44:15] drinking over a case and he got sick and
[44:18] he died we in our minds what is it oh I
[44:22] know he back slid and I know he's going
[44:24] to hell no he had a Savior no he had a
[44:34] savior and that Savior was Jesus Christ
[44:37] and do you think that God didn't see
[44:41] what he was going to do before he saved
[44:45] but God saved him anyhow holy lord have
[44:49] mercy and just like what God does what
[44:52] God did when he did wouldn't we think
[44:54] that's what God does when he what when
[44:55] you won't repent is like a parent if you
[44:58] don't repent go in your room if you
[45:01] don't say I'm sorry go in your room oh I
[45:03] must spank you right
[45:05] somehow judgment is coming but it's for
[45:07] your own
[45:08] good right and so God when he can't get
[45:11] you to repent he puts you to sleep a lot
[45:13] of people don't understand I said many
[45:16] other righteous and how they die and God
[45:19] allows them to fall asleep to keep them
[45:21] away from the evil that is to come that
[45:24] means they were going to get worse right
[45:27] I'm so glad y'all so enthused and happy
[45:29] tonight I almost don't know what to do
[45:34] pulling on the gift praise God
[45:36] hallelujah
[45:39] but you and I must realize by God's
[45:41] grace that God is so good to us that you
[45:45] and I must understand that when God
[45:48] brings you into the Word of God no
[45:52] matter how many mistakes you make and
[45:55] I'm not giving you excuses I'm not
[45:57] giving you away but you get the Oh a
[45:59] praise God I might as well do what I
[46:00] want to do well that shows you're not
[46:02] saved because a real son and daughter of
[46:07] God's divine as Ernest will is to do the
[46:10] perfect will of God hallelujah you get
[46:14] these people and so many I'm in the
[46:16] message and don't understand Amen that
[46:18] you just can't do what you want to do
[46:19] it's oh praise God I got the Holy Ghost
[46:22] huh you can't do it you can do it but
[46:27] God gonna spank you if you are a son and
[46:30] daughter of God that's the thing now if
[46:32] you're not a son and daughter of God he
[46:34] lets you go on do what you want to do
[46:38] because there's nothing he can do for
[46:41] you if that makes sense but a real son
[46:45] and daughter of God the Bible said God
[46:47] chasing those whom he loves thank God
[46:52] for the chastisement of God hallelujah
[46:56] see that veil keeps you from the living
[46:59] living the way you we should and I when
[47:02] I heard that I thought Lord i'ma write a
[47:03] song Lord I want to live the way I
[47:05] should because you know I just want to
[47:08] see God and I had it in my head and I
[47:10] lost it but anyhow maybe gotta bring it
[47:12] back but my point is all of us need to
[47:16] live the way we should right if the holy
[47:21] is here and the holy ghost mean people
[47:25] of the age go by to live it how can we
[47:29] come with an excuse there is no excuse
[47:33] right let me move on to something here
[47:38] thank God for His grace talk about
[47:42] veiled right now we look at this thing
[47:45] we said when I Paul had to understand me
[47:47] did Paul ever make mistakes I'm sure he
[47:49] did Paul was a man and you think about
[47:53] it you say Paul calls a lot of Saints to
[47:55] blaspheme the Holy Spirit and yet God
[47:59] spared him why because the elected of
[48:04] God cannot blaspheme the Holy Ghost they
[48:08] can't do it why because they were
[48:10] justified before the foundation of the
[48:13] world you'll never hear a true son and
[48:17] daughter of God blaspheme the Holy
[48:20] Spirit Paul says nay and all these
[48:26] things and listen I've suffered a lot of
[48:28] things I've gone through a lot of things
[48:29] I've heard dr. something to go and come
[48:31] to this now we talked about going on to
[48:34] perfection we talked about all the
[48:36] doctors that we go through baptism and
[48:38] repentance and all of these things and
[48:40] understand all these things were good
[48:42] when we were going through them your
[48:45] church order doesn't save you only the
[48:51] blood of Jesus Christ can save you and
[48:56] understand all your works doesn't save
[48:58] you you're not saved by works you're
[49:02] saved by the grace of God all of your
[49:07] religious traditions in order to go to
[49:11] perfection you've got to recognize that
[49:13] those things are true but you've got to
[49:15] press toward the mark of a higher
[49:17] calling because none of those
[49:19] traditional things can save you
[49:22] none of it brings you to perfection you
[49:25] understand what I'm saying all of the
[49:28] do's and the don'ts
[49:29] all the little legalism you can be as
[49:31] legal as you want to you can do it all
[49:33] right and still be lost
[49:36] your righteousness must supersede the
[49:40] righteousness of the Pharisees you know
[49:43] what that is that is the Holy Ghost
[49:46] hallelujah and that Holy Ghost is given
[49:50] to those who are elected and chosen by
[49:52] God to receive it woo
[49:58] listen we have a place that God has
[50:02] already prepared for us to go to and if
[50:06] you're counting on your own
[50:07] righteousness to get you there you're
[50:10] going to miss it we can only depend on
[50:14] the righteousness of God can I take you
[50:16] back to the Garden of Eden it came to
[50:19] Abel we saw what Cain did Cain you know
[50:24] he he had all of the the flowery things
[50:27] and all of the vegetables and all of the
[50:29] farming things he had all of that in a
[50:31] row and it no doubt it was so beautiful
[50:33] you know like some of our churches out
[50:34] here look so beautiful and they think
[50:36] because they're fabulous and they're
[50:37] beautiful God is gonna accept him God
[50:40] only accept the blood washed y'all hear
[50:43] what I'm saying you gotta be washed in
[50:45] the blood and here was evil amen
[50:48] Abel didn't have nothing to show for
[50:50] nothing
[50:51] in fact his church service was a mess he
[50:55] was over there hacking the nikkor that
[50:57] make of the lamb he meant to sacrifice
[51:00] it unto the Jehovah God or the unseen
[51:02] God he had a revelation that there was
[51:05] nothing he could do to save himself and
[51:08] once everybody recognized that that
[51:12] there's nothing I can do to save myself
[51:15] you're in a right a good position you're
[51:19] in the place where God wants you to be
[51:21] because he's the only one that can save
[51:24] you hallelujah is that right
[51:26] the Bible says salvation is of the Lord
[51:30] you can't even judge a man by the way he
[51:33] acts because you don't know what God is
[51:36] gonna do for that person yet later you
[51:39] don't know if we would have looked Jacob
[51:45] and Esau we would have known
[51:48] listen no way Jacob could be the right
[51:53] one cuz Jacob was the shyster Esau was
[51:59] the good boy
[52:00] Esau I like to say like this he saw
[52:03] prepared a meal that his dad was all
[52:06] always happy with Esau wasn't the best
[52:09] preacher he looked good but he sold his
[52:15] birthright that's what I was trying to
[52:17] tell the people the other day some of us
[52:19] we don't even realize that selling your
[52:21] birthright doesn't have to be over
[52:23] Cadillac like Elvis did it could be
[52:26] something really small did y'all know
[52:30] that
[52:30] a lot of people will miss the rapture
[52:33] because of their families because they
[52:35] love their families more than they love
[52:37] God you can't love nobody more than you
[52:42] love God hallelujah
[52:47] a million will lose you said all brother
[52:50] it is true let's move on so when it
[52:57] comes to saving you the blood of Jesus
[53:00] Christ it's the only thing that can save
[53:02] you religion is good it's good to be a
[53:07] part of a church but the church can't
[53:10] save you salvation only comes by the man
[53:14] the man Christ Jesus he's the only one
[53:19] that can save you and you said what
[53:21] brothers what are you trying to get you
[53:23] get us - I'm trying to say not only am I
[53:25] saved but I've been saved
[53:28] like like Hebrew says unto the uttermost
[53:32] not to the almost the uttermost beyond
[53:36] I'm say beyond that Paul said I'm more
[53:39] than a conqueror you are more than a
[53:42] conqueror why because Christ Jesus
[53:44] conquers for you he's your brother Luke
[53:52] what are you well I'm trying to you know
[53:54] if we don't fall in love with Jesus
[53:56] we're going to miss it a lot of time we
[54:00] think because we can do ours our
[54:02] religious services to the Lord it's okay
[54:04] no it's not okay this thing is between
[54:06] you and God
[54:07] it's between husband and wife hallelujah
[54:11] her husband and bride or whatever my
[54:14] point is Amen I love for Jesus Christ my
[54:17] supersede our love for ourselves
[54:20] you can't even love yourself more than
[54:23] you love God and back to the flesh back
[54:27] to the veil back to this thing right
[54:30] here that we got to go beyond right oh
[54:34] come on you say ah let me say it like
[54:36] this you won't be the only one it
[54:39] doesn't justify you but Jonah says I
[54:44] ain't going to preach ain't gonna preach
[54:47] for Nineveh no I ain't goin God says
[54:51] okay we see that see about that you
[54:53] understand me and God allowed him to go
[54:56] the opposite way thinking thinking he
[55:01] was in his own mind I know what I'm
[55:03] gonna do and God took the very thing he
[55:06] thought he had control of and which that
[55:09] thing back around and here was now Jonah
[55:11] in the belly of a whale and God had to
[55:14] put him there just to get him to repent
[55:18] sometimes God has to put you in
[55:20] predicaments certain stack circumstances
[55:22] is it haha that's not where I want you I
[55:25] want you to go to Nineveh now imma show
[55:28] you how the man's disposition was way
[55:30] off key because we find out that when he
[55:33] got the Nineveh and preach he got mad
[55:35] with God because God saved him save
[55:38] Nineveh and Jonah gets mad God puts him
[55:42] under a place where the heat was of the
[55:44] day and put him on the gorge and the
[55:46] gorge went down and he got an attitude
[55:47] with God then he didn't make that gorge
[55:50] he God came and gave him shelter and
[55:54] that's what we do we have a problem with
[55:58] this veil because we think that this
[56:01] veil is something but let me tell you
[56:04] something when the life leaves out of it
[56:06] you're gonna realize it's nothing it's
[56:10] nothing but a hoe it's nothing but a
[56:12] thing that Lucifer allowed
[56:16] I put it this way help pervert to keep
[56:18] you and I from seeing heavenly things
[56:21] you said well old brother what are you
[56:23] saying
[56:23] you can even be on the battlefield of
[56:25] God and still be blind hmm
[56:30] [Applause]
[56:32] right says Lord open up gazes eyes he
[56:37] was in battle he seeks Amen that the
[56:40] enemy has a a mark more power than he
[56:44] does and that's what a lot of people
[56:45] think oh my god I just don't know what
[56:47] to do I can't overcome what you talking
[56:50] about the Bible said the aid of the Lord
[56:52] and kappab out those that fear and the
[56:54] Bible said God amen builds a wall of
[56:57] fire about you how can the devil touch
[57:00] you he can't because you're under the
[57:03] blood of Jesus but I'll say a flash
[57:07] blinds us to the reality of who we are
[57:10] this is why the prophet of God had to
[57:12] come so that we could see that we're not
[57:15] something other than God with rotation
[57:18] off of God we're piece of him hallelujah
[57:21] and the same power and the same ability
[57:24] that God has in him is within us but our
[57:28] vailed the sole flesh hinders us from
[57:31] seeing reality the doctors have no power
[57:36] over you nothing else power God said he
[57:41] whom the Sun is set free is free indeed
[57:43] and where the Spirit of the Lord is
[57:46] there is Liberty your mind blinds you
[57:48] blind in the mind that's where most of
[57:52] us are we can't believe that we're new
[57:55] creatures because of our veil help us
[57:59] Jesus but the Bible said we're new
[58:02] creatures in Christ I take the word I
[58:05] accept the word I don't have to be able
[58:07] to explain it I believe it because
[58:10] that's what he says I'm a new creature
[58:13] all things all things are passed away
[58:16] and behold everything has become new
[58:18] Holly I don't look back because they
[58:21] meant why are you looking back that man
[58:24] a woman's supposed to be dead by your
[58:28] tree is that right
[58:29] I think that was one of the things that
[58:32] Rome used to have used to punish people
[58:34] with thieves and Liars or whatever
[58:37] because what they would do is tie a dead
[58:39] man to his back and he had to walk with
[58:42] that dead man live with that dead man
[58:44] and eventually the dead man killed him
[58:47] by just inch the worms eating up a dead
[58:51] man and you can't get free it's like
[58:53] living in hell it's all right to see it
[58:55] that way it's the truth it's the truth
[59:02] and that's what happens to us when we
[59:05] don't have enough Holy Ghost it's like
[59:07] living in torment that means it a nicer
[59:10] way but that's the truth people say
[59:15] brother Brooks up but I'm trying to say
[59:18] that's the truth
[59:20] you and I don't want to be living in
[59:23] that position when God has made us free
[59:26] the joy of the Lord is our strength ha
[59:31] ha
[59:31] you gotta is his joy he gave us not that
[59:35] we got joy of our own he gave us his joy
[59:37] therefore it's our strain am i making
[59:44] sense oh god help us Lord you love the
[59:57] Lord see when the word quickens you we
[1:00:02] walk in the light it's such a beautiful
[1:00:06] light is that right but how are you
[1:00:09] walking in the light except the word
[1:00:11] quickens you the word was quicken you
[1:00:15] you can read this Bible all you want
[1:00:17] like I said the other service it lives
[1:00:19] but you what you can't read it
[1:00:22] intellectually and expect for you to get
[1:00:23] anything you gotta be prayed up you got
[1:00:26] to be in the spirit to understand the
[1:00:29] spirit you want to read this Bible
[1:00:33] hadn't even prayed you got to pray Lord
[1:00:36] open up the word give me revelation let
[1:00:40] it come off the pages live for me
[1:00:43] that's when God will open up things
[1:00:46] hallelujah but if you don't you think
[1:00:49] the con of mine is going to understand
[1:00:50] it just like a theologian trying to
[1:00:52] understand the word this is not an
[1:00:57] intellectual Bible this Bible was
[1:00:59] written supernatural and supernatural
[1:01:03] you must understand the supernaturally
[1:01:05] that's the only way right the Bible said
[1:01:08] you know if your kind of mind cannot
[1:01:10] understand those things are that of God
[1:01:12] they are spiritually discerned and
[1:01:14] therefore you've got to have the author
[1:01:16] of the book inside because the author
[1:01:19] know what is written he's the one that
[1:01:22] can explain it to you without that
[1:01:24] you're just trying to learn God in your
[1:01:27] mind and God was never meant to be
[1:01:29] learned in your mind he's the God of
[1:01:32] your heart that's why people are the way
[1:01:37] they are you know we're not even
[1:01:43] thinking about reflecting holy ego so
[1:01:45] reflecting God and that's supposed to be
[1:01:47] our walk every day reflecting the Lord
[1:01:49] Jesus and everything we do we ought to
[1:01:51] be reflecting the Lord Jesus but like
[1:01:55] I'm saying like this was in you what is
[1:01:59] being reflected right because whatever
[1:02:03] is being reflected from you is what's in
[1:02:07] you ye are the lights of the world city
[1:02:10] that sits upon a hill if the light of
[1:02:13] God is in you that light is being
[1:02:15] reflected if the light of God is not in
[1:02:19] you
[1:02:19] darkness is being reflected so you said
[1:02:23] well what do you mean brother books let
[1:02:24] me say it like this there are places
[1:02:26] where the Sun can shine and there are
[1:02:29] places where you can go and you can stay
[1:02:31] right underneath the shade right but God
[1:02:34] didn't intend for us to be under the
[1:02:36] shade he intends for us to be in the
[1:02:38] presence of the sign o Lord I know this
[1:02:41] is elementary but I've got to get it
[1:02:43] over because if we can get to this place
[1:02:46] where Paul says now there is no
[1:02:48] condemnation to those who walk not that
[1:02:50] of flesh but after the spirit is that
[1:02:51] right he goes on to say that God not
[1:02:54] only did he call us but he justified
[1:02:57] and he glorified us that shows that even
[1:03:00] from the foundation of the world God
[1:03:02] said us free and if we can't how how can
[1:03:06] I say like this it's it's just difficult
[1:03:08] for me to say what I'm trying to say
[1:03:09] because it's a revelation my point is
[1:03:11] this when we're free we're free so why
[1:03:17] would we feel how if you fearing hell it
[1:03:22] means that something's wrong with your
[1:03:24] experience a true born-again believer
[1:03:27] will not fear hell or going to hell
[1:03:32] because a true born-again believer knows
[1:03:35] that he can't go why he has an anchor
[1:03:43] his lash might be here but it's so love
[1:03:46] is behind the veil y'all understand me
[1:03:49] that's where I'm at my soul is over here
[1:03:52] and I have a anchor I have a connection
[1:03:55] amen
[1:03:56] a lot oh come on somebody I'm getting a
[1:03:59] little boo it's good to me Oh your
[1:04:05] brother looks are you crazy
[1:04:06] we're all just getting ready to go into
[1:04:08] a little bit of physics but we have a
[1:04:10] straight line a line connecting me here
[1:04:13] and there hallelujah and that anchor
[1:04:18] will always be able to pull me up
[1:04:21] when I die I don't go down I don't care
[1:04:25] how much this precious may Oh God I go
[1:04:28] up because I have an anchor there's a
[1:04:32] soul over there there's a man over there
[1:04:34] that's in my image and that image is in
[1:04:40] crisis image you understand hallelujah
[1:04:43] I'm in heavenly places right now
[1:04:45] in Christ Jesus and so are you of you
[1:04:50] born again you love the Lord I'm gonna
[1:04:58] go back to that mediator because I don't
[1:05:00] think we catching it
[1:05:01] I really don't listen you know when you
[1:05:06] go to the you got you at you you've got
[1:05:09] to go to court
[1:05:11] hey and you gonna worry you're gonna
[1:05:12] worry because I want to make sure I got
[1:05:14] the right attorney
[1:05:15] he's gotta be shrewd right right because
[1:05:20] I'm really I'm guilty and he's got to be
[1:05:23] shrewd enough he's got to know his
[1:05:25] business to get me out of this you gonna
[1:05:30] find that lawyer you're gonna find him
[1:05:33] because what he has a reputation he's
[1:05:36] got a good reputation that he whenever
[1:05:39] he becomes the attorney he knows how to
[1:05:41] work the system and he knows how to get
[1:05:43] you free you know we do have attorneys
[1:05:45] like that you can be as wrong as all
[1:05:47] get-out but they'll know how to work it
[1:05:49] to get you out free and you don't have
[1:05:53] to gamble with this attorney cuz this
[1:05:56] attorney hasn't fixed it so that he's
[1:05:59] not only the attorney but he's the jury
[1:06:02] and he suggests so we realize y'all
[1:06:07] don't y'all didn't let me tell y'all
[1:06:09] something what happened to me years ago
[1:06:11] when I was in Lima Ohio I was way down
[1:06:14] there in Amish country and an 18-wheeler
[1:06:17] got in front of me and that and the
[1:06:21] light was Green when I saw it but by the
[1:06:24] time the 18-wheeler cleared the
[1:06:26] intersection it was red and I was right
[1:06:29] behind the 18-wheeler where the police
[1:06:32] stopped me and I thought no no you can't
[1:06:38] and I mean he gave me a big ticket I
[1:06:41] said oh no I'm gonna fight this boy imma
[1:06:43] fight this T I did not know that I was
[1:06:47] going down to Mayberry y'all some of
[1:06:54] y'all in the world maybe that's when one
[1:06:57] man is the officer the office of the
[1:07:00] judge the jury what man holds all those
[1:07:06] offices and I went in there that man
[1:07:08] bout laughed at me hello did I did I win
[1:07:12] the case
[1:07:13] no you understand me and that's how it
[1:07:17] is with Jesus we're
[1:07:23] determine how it all goes out one man I
[1:07:26] think y'all get the picture now
[1:07:29] because you got to realize that's the
[1:07:31] way it is with you and when you know
[1:07:33] you've got such a system on your behalf
[1:07:36] working for you there's no way you can't
[1:07:43] get out of the situation it's already
[1:07:46] fixed y'all y'all remember Mayberry's
[1:07:52] our weight that's the way it is
[1:07:54] one of those little towns you're going
[1:07:56] this and where's the judge on the judge
[1:07:58] where's the sheriff I'm the sheriff
[1:07:59] where's the police I'm the police I gave
[1:08:05] you the ticket oh yeah so how you gonna
[1:08:09] win you can't you can't and that's how
[1:08:12] it is
[1:08:13] see the Lord had fixed that thing up
[1:08:16] that's why people to understand Calvary
[1:08:17] they think camera oh the Lamb of God he
[1:08:20] just died and hope somebody's gonna
[1:08:22] believe in him no show
[1:08:24] God doesn't run his program like that
[1:08:26] God knew before the foundation of the
[1:08:29] world who all would believe in him and
[1:08:31] the Bible said he wrote their names in
[1:08:34] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:08:38] foundation of the world that means I
[1:08:40] cannot be lost my name is already in the
[1:08:44] book so how do you know because I'm here
[1:08:47] now I am a vindication that my name was
[1:08:51] in the book because I'm believing the
[1:08:54] message of the hour today he knew I
[1:08:58] don't know thousands of the millions of
[1:09:00] people in this world they were gonna be
[1:09:02] one by the name of Isaiah Brooks you got
[1:09:05] to put your name in there there was one
[1:09:07] that would hear his voice because the
[1:09:10] Bible says my sheep heareth my voice and
[1:09:13] a strain that they will not follow so
[1:09:17] what what are we worried about well Oh
[1:09:21] none of us like to be naked none of us
[1:09:24] like to be destitute nobody really likes
[1:09:27] being poor but if it takes that to
[1:09:30] glorify Jesus Christ why not
[1:09:37] why not when you know that this is just
[1:09:42] only temporary when you know that when
[1:09:45] you die everything is leveled out you
[1:09:47] don't have nothing you ain't packing
[1:09:48] nothing with you when you know that your
[1:09:52] true identity is not in this flesh but
[1:09:55] in the one to come the real you this is
[1:09:58] not the real me
[1:09:59] maybe the yarn is veiled that's the real
[1:10:03] me inside but understand that the real
[1:10:08] me is sitting right now in heavenly
[1:10:12] places in Christ Jesus so when you die
[1:10:17] you ain't got a world Lord I'm seeing
[1:10:20] I've got so many things oh my god huh
[1:10:22] Lord I'm about ready to die what's gonna
[1:10:24] happen to me that's nonsense
[1:10:31] you don't have to fear death
[1:10:33] when you truly say if you really believe
[1:10:35] that his blood cleansed you if you
[1:10:38] really believe that his sacrifice was
[1:10:40] enough hallelujah it's not the blood
[1:10:43] plus it's the blood you need the blood
[1:10:50] pressure religion or blood plus your
[1:10:52] righteousness because your righteousness
[1:10:54] and my righteousness is like filthy rags
[1:10:55] y'all I can't tell you and I know some
[1:10:58] of y'all think I'm not gonna worry about
[1:11:00] what you think but i'ma say it like this
[1:11:02] you gonna need it cuz I'm telling you it
[1:11:06] ain't gonna get no easier it's getting
[1:11:09] ready to get rough far more rougher than
[1:11:11] it is now and you're gonna need where
[1:11:14] you're gonna need to know that you're
[1:11:15] standing on solid ground ain't about
[1:11:20] what you're gonna do you say well what
[1:11:22] do you mean brother let me say it like
[1:11:23] that Peter denied Jesus three times
[1:11:25] cursed about it and God still had him
[1:11:30] preaching on the day of Pentecost Moses
[1:11:36] killed the man how many of y'all would
[1:11:40] have followed Moses exile from Egypt and
[1:11:45] God used him to be that one of the
[1:11:48] greatest
[1:11:49] it's ever lived huh think about it think
[1:11:54] about everybody seem like they did
[1:11:56] something David you know what he did and
[1:11:58] David was not only a an adulterer but
[1:12:01] David a man killed people just killed
[1:12:03] him slaughter he had so much blood on
[1:12:07] his hand God says you can't you can't
[1:12:09] build my temple you got too much blood
[1:12:10] in your hand you should hold
[1:12:16] Brotherhood's what are you saying
[1:12:17] what I'm trying to say is this in order
[1:12:20] to maintain your joy you've got an
[1:12:22] already maintain your freedom you
[1:12:27] understand what I'm saying in order to
[1:12:28] maintain your joy you got to realize
[1:12:30] that this is just a whim this is
[1:12:33] something that's gonna pass this is like
[1:12:34] to say this too will pass it's going to
[1:12:36] pass but while it's here I'm gonna
[1:12:39] glorify my god huh
[1:12:41] the Peter James and John thrown into
[1:12:43] prison why me Lord whatever that's
[1:13:01] wasn't that kind of song and you know
[1:13:03] that's what we do some bad something
[1:13:05] come and guess what we do that garden
[1:13:08] failed us God hasn't failed us the
[1:13:12] trying of your faith is more precious
[1:13:15] than gold let's pray that your faith
[1:13:18] fail not let's show the devil a man an
[1:13:21] enemy miserable y'all think I don't have
[1:13:23] trials I got more stuff goin coming at
[1:13:25] me now than ever you know I felt like
[1:13:27] you know you see those old kind of
[1:13:28] movies and they know how to kung-fu or
[1:13:30] whatever they call that stuff to be
[1:13:31] doing fighting enemies they flying
[1:13:33] through the air and everything else and
[1:13:34] they still whipping them I got so many
[1:13:40] Devils coming at me it's okay
[1:13:42] cuz I got the real Superman on the
[1:13:45] inside and that's Jesus Christ you love
[1:13:49] the Lord oh it's gonna calm but right
[1:13:52] now the greatest battle ever fought you
[1:13:55] gotta know who you are in your heart in
[1:13:56] order to feed the devil in this
[1:13:59] lest an and the powers in whose name
[1:14:05] nobody named but Jesus Christ at the
[1:14:09] name of Jesus every knee shall bow every
[1:14:12] tongue shall come fast I can tell you
[1:14:17] know then I could never get tired of
[1:14:19] that name Jesus even when I hear
[1:14:21] sinister if they glorifying Jesus it
[1:14:25] makes me feel so good even when they
[1:14:27] said oh you know God has been good to me
[1:14:29] and I know I'm like oh yeah I know he
[1:14:32] has you know God is good to everybody
[1:14:35] sinner and Saint people eat at the table
[1:14:38] don't even bless their food don't even
[1:14:40] know that poisoning could be in it
[1:14:44] and God spared them lives their lives
[1:14:47] because he's protecting them you and I
[1:14:52] are so blessed we think about how God in
[1:14:54] his in his eye I don't even know whether
[1:14:57] I got the message over tonight all I
[1:14:59] know is I tried to reach it like he
[1:15:01] wanted me to preach him but you know
[1:15:03] when it comes to the simplicity of the
[1:15:05] word we have come to a place we can't
[1:15:07] can't handle it
[1:15:09] somebody said well you know I heard
[1:15:13] somebody say this not long ago said it
[1:15:16] was it was the man he he drank milk and
[1:15:22] and the lamb he drank milk but when it
[1:15:28] comes to the ego he that's all he eat is
[1:15:30] meat well
[1:15:34] Jesus was a lion in a lamb he drank milk
[1:15:40] and he ate meat and a man drank milk he
[1:15:47] eat me Embree he's a combination of all
[1:15:53] but a lot of time people just just the
[1:15:57] simplicity is the thing that's gonna get
[1:15:59] you you know you say brother what are
[1:16:01] you saying I'm trying to say like when
[1:16:03] when brother Branham came when he was
[1:16:06] here and when God used him in the way he
[1:16:08] used this is ambition his desire was for
[1:16:12] people to see Christ see Jesus more than
[1:16:14] anything don't look at me I want you to
[1:16:16] see Jesus because he's the one could
[1:16:18] save he's the one that healed he's the
[1:16:20] one that delivers and as long as you
[1:16:22] stay with the word of God you will see
[1:16:24] Jesus sir because now he's unveiled he's
[1:16:31] in a group of people right now with
[1:16:34] their intent or their desire to show
[1:16:38] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:16:41] today forever if that's not your
[1:16:44] ambition I think a lot of time we want
[1:16:47] to just live and you know get houses and
[1:16:50] cars and find clothes and all that is
[1:16:53] good the witnessed earth began to burn
[1:16:56] with fire all that's going just like in
[1:16:59] the Philippines I saw on the news the
[1:17:01] other day
[1:17:02] I turned I excuse me volcano has erupted
[1:17:05] people house is being destroyed I wonder
[1:17:08] how much money and time they put in
[1:17:10] building that house and just you know
[1:17:12] one moment and it's gone
[1:17:14] do y'all think you you understand when
[1:17:17] California goes off and we don't know
[1:17:19] whether we go to be here or not but I
[1:17:20] really believe that we will for a moment
[1:17:23] because I believe that at the time
[1:17:25] California goes off it will also be the
[1:17:27] resurrection of the dead because there
[1:17:31] was a great earthquake when Jesus rose
[1:17:33] from the dead and I believe that great
[1:17:35] earthquake that's mentioned in the back
[1:17:37] of Revelation also is the great rail our
[1:17:40] earthquake that you and I will
[1:17:42] experience when the dead is raised and
[1:17:46] you saw a brother books ha what's gonna
[1:17:48] happen when all these see when that when
[1:17:51] the world is in such a chaotic condition

[1:17:58] never know parties will be disappearing
[1:18:02] and you know you say well well I heard
[1:18:04] some I said it's gonna be a lot of I

[1:18:09] of them

[1:18:13] encourage everybody to know that you
[1:18:15] wanted them I'm not gonna believe
[1:18:16] anything I told the devil the other day
[1:18:17] I said you know what devil I've come too
