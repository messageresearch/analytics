[35:58] amen amen beginning at the 14th
[36:01] verse of Philippians
[36:05] 3 it reads I press toward the mark of
[36:08] the prize of a high calling of God in
[36:12] Christ
[36:17] Jesus let us therefore as many as be
[36:21] perfect be thus minded and if anything
[36:24] ye be otherwise minded God shall reveal
[36:28] even this unto
[36:40] you nevertheless where to we have
[36:42] already obtained let us walk by the same
[36:45] rule let us mind the same
[36:53] thing amen amen
[36:57] 17th verse Brethren be followers
[37:01] together of me and mark them which walk
[37:04] so as ye have us for an
[37:15] example let us pray father God we thank
[37:18] you for your grace and your
[37:21] mercy we thank you for your goodness and
[37:24] all that you have done for us Lord at at
[37:27] the end of the
[37:29] day you will be all that we would
[37:32] have even
[37:34] as job said naked we came into this
[37:38] world but father God your
[37:41] Prophet said that we will not leave out
[37:44] here
[37:46] naked that we will be closed by the
[37:48] character of
[37:50] Christ and even as Paul desired it
[37:54] Lord he desired to be clothed upon
[37:58] so Lord this is our Earnest
[38:01] desire to be in a
[38:05] position where your mercy and
[38:08] Grace would clothe
[38:10] us and
[38:12] therefore we will appear before
[38:15] you clothed and not
[38:18] naked we ask these things in your name
[38:20] Jesus
[38:22] Christ am amen you may be seated
[38:27] we appreciate everybody here
[38:31] tonight you know I'm the kind of
[38:34] person if I could have church every
[38:36] night I
[38:39] would nor when I say things like that it
[38:42] it makes people
[38:45] nervous I'm just getting ready for
[38:49] heaven you won't have no dismissal
[38:53] there and like I always hear those old
[38:56] folks say
[38:58] every day will be like
[39:02] Sunday and we'll never have to say
[39:07] goodbye I like to entitle the message
[39:11] tonight the worth of your
[39:14] soul I think often
[39:17] times we we we get so
[39:20] busy uh with our everyday
[39:25] lives and we forget get the
[39:29] cost what it took for us to be
[39:34] free get the person who freed
[39:38] us think about it Jesus said if you be
[39:43] afraid ashamed of
[39:45] me in this adulterous
[39:48] generation he said I will be ashamed of
[39:50] you before my
[39:53] father so you have a
[39:55] choice you either testify and praise God
[40:00] for the Lord Jesus
[40:02] Christ or you find yourself ashamed of
[40:06] him and I'm sure many of
[40:09] time you have left conversations with
[40:14] others feeling like you could have added
[40:16] more to
[40:19] it exed the Lord
[40:24] more one of the things that I do want
[40:26] people to understand in this
[40:28] life is that I am a
[40:31] Christian if they don't know anything
[40:34] else about
[40:35] me I want my neighbor to know I want the
[40:39] people at the grocery store to know
[40:41] wherever I go I want them to
[40:45] know I am a
[40:47] Christian not by putting writings on my
[40:52] back but by the life that I live
[40:57] what is your soul
[40:59] worth many of us we we we we we have no
[41:04] figure to put in that to answer that
[41:07] question
[41:08] with so I hope by the grace of God I'll
[41:12] be able to answer that a little bit for
[41:15] you in the way that God thinks of
[41:19] you first of
[41:21] all the worth of Jesus
[41:25] Christ is invaluable
[41:29] because Jesus Christ was God in
[41:33] flesh and we will spend
[41:36] eternity thanking
[41:38] him for what he's
[41:41] done and what he will be
[41:43] doing in
[41:45] eternity let let me say something to you
[41:49] something struck me in my
[41:51] studying that I had never seen
[41:55] before that God
[41:58] put
[41:59] eternity in
[42:06] me not when I was
[42:09] [Music]
[42:10] saved but this
[42:13] eternity has always been in
[42:18] me when I was
[42:20] born it was
[42:23] there and if I should
[42:25] die it be
[42:28] there for all of
[42:31] us that are truly seeds of
[42:36] God here we are in a natural Fallen
[42:44] body with with with a a a peace of
[42:54] Eternity and even though that eternity
[42:57] is in
[42:59] us we'll never come to understand it
[43:04] all Hallelujah think about it that when
[43:08] you were born you were born with the
[43:11] attribute of God in
[43:14] you Satan wanted to rule
[43:19] you he wanted to own you
[43:27] and in in
[43:29] reality he was the God of this
[43:32] world and you were his
[43:35] property but the truth of the matter is
[43:39] you were God's
[43:41] Property before you was his
[43:44] property and you only became his
[43:48] property because Adam forfeited his
[43:53] rights to you
[43:57] could not redeem
[44:00] you only one could redeem
[44:04] you and that was God
[44:08] himself thank God for
[44:11] Calvary the man who paid the
[44:14] price Jesus Paid that price at
[44:18] calary and when he paid that
[44:21] price he took back the title de
[44:27] in other words he he claimed his
[44:32] ownership and that was you you
[44:35] understand
[44:37] me God had
[44:40] trees
[44:41] flowers and everything like that those
[44:45] things even exist in
[44:48] heaven hallelujah hallelujah but you see
[44:51] what God came
[44:53] for he he he he came to pay the price
[44:58] for you and for me he came to redeem his
[45:03] sons and
[45:06] daughters now you got to see what I'm
[45:09] talking
[45:10] about your
[45:12] soul to God is
[45:19] priceless now I'm read a quote by
[45:21] Brother Bram in just a
[45:24] minute but think about it when Jesus was
[45:28] suffering for your
[45:31] sins the Bible said with his stripes we
[45:34] will
[45:37] heal meaning that all that he went
[45:42] through was for
[45:44] you and me y understand me how can we
[45:51] forget what he's done for us we sing
[45:54] that song how can I forget
[45:57] done for
[45:58] me because if we could REM
[46:02] know what he did for us that's why
[46:06] brother brandham
[46:07] says every believer needs to go to
[46:12] Calvary you need to see what Calvary is
[46:15] all about you need to understand that no
[46:19] other Mortal man could have done what he
[46:25] did Feed Me From
[46:29] Slavery see you got to understand your
[46:32] benefits a lot of times people are
[46:34] Christians but they don't understand the
[46:37] benefits of being a
[46:39] Christian when you are a
[46:41] Christian you have been born
[46:45] free right before you was a Christian
[46:49] you were slave to
[46:50] sin whatever the devil told you to do
[46:54] you did you was in bondage
[46:57] many times you didn't want to do it but
[47:00] you did it anyhow Hallelujah but only
[47:03] the
[47:04] price only the blood only the power of
[47:08] the blood could break the
[47:11] chain
[47:13] slavery as our brother preached Jubilee
[47:16] to set you
[47:18] free the Redemption
[47:22] cost was the total of sum
[47:26] all
[47:31] creation think about it nothing on
[47:35] Earth could measure up to that
[47:40] cost not to redeem
[47:43] man not to redeem man nothing could
[47:46] redeem man nothing on
[47:49] Earth because through sin everything had
[47:53] become
[47:55] defiled think about it
[47:57] the animals didn't sin but yet they must
[48:01] die Hallelujah the
[48:06] weather but yet it must
[48:08] change from life to
[48:11] death summer winter spring and
[48:16] fall these four
[48:19] seasons amen amen is a is a um
[48:23] reflection
[48:27] of the fall of
[48:29] Man brother Bram in the Oneness of of
[48:37] unity
[48:40] 1958 January
[48:45] 28th paragraph
[48:51] 154 he said this is a great
[48:55] moment this moment will be will will
[48:58] seal the
[48:59] destiny no doubt of
[49:03] many he One
[49:06] Soul worth 10,000
[49:11] Worlds how great is this
[49:15] moment I thought about
[49:18] that and and no way I'm going to go
[49:20] through all the the the the the the the
[49:23] many people that are living in the world
[49:25] today come on
[49:29] and these figures doesn't account for
[49:31] those that have come and
[49:36] died but I'll say it in a roundabout
[49:42] figure India has 15 billion
[49:51] people China has about 14 billion
[49:58] United States has
[49:59] 345
[50:03] million Indonesia has
[50:06] 283
[50:09] million now now think about that and
[50:12] each one of those
[50:14] souls are worth 10
[50:20] worlds even your mind can't even
[50:22] calculate
[50:24] it there is no dollar
[50:29] system that can pay for the souls of
[50:33] these
[50:36] people but I want you to
[50:39] understand Jesus died for the
[50:44] world can you put that in your
[50:47] mind I'm talking about every
[50:51] soul from the beginning to the
[50:55] end his blood paid for
[50:59] it now they they're not all
[51:03] saved yet when the blood of Jesus struck
[51:06] the
[51:10] ground his blood Justified Every
[51:14] Soul Hallelujah huj and the reason why
[51:17] people are not
[51:19] saved because they will not
[51:22] accept what Jesus did on Calvary
[51:28] hallelujah hallelujah but his blood was
[51:31] rich
[51:33] enough to pay the entire
[51:37] bill y'all hear me think about it his
[51:41] blood was so
[51:43] powerful that the souls that trusted in
[51:48] him
[51:51] innumerable is that right John said I
[51:54] saw a number that no man can
[51:58] number y Understand Me by One Man by one
[52:05] blood he paid the price for
[52:09] all think about
[52:11] it Hallelujah no gold no
[52:16] silver pay for you Hallelujah but
[52:20] precious blood of
[52:22] Christ Hallelujah the blood has never
[52:25] lost his power
[52:28] it never
[52:30] will one of the things that I love about
[52:33] this it makes my mind just go like
[52:37] wow amen and if you can't include
[52:40] yourself in one one of those
[52:44] numbers number that cannot be
[52:47] numbered somewhere you got to be in
[52:49] there
[52:51] somewhere I I got I must be in there
[52:55] somewhere
[52:58] hallelujah hallelujah thank God for the
[53:01] grace of
[53:02] God hallelujah hallelujah we must
[53:07] remember that we did nothing to earn the
[53:11] robe of

[53:18] wedding and he had a por at the door
[53:23] [Music]

[53:36] my sheep will hear my voice and a
[53:40] stranger they will not

[53:48] me called me to a
[53:53] wedding he somebody it called me to a

[55:35] shall follow me all the days of my life
[55:40] now I don't know about you but I believe
[55:42] that that's the only reason why I'm here

[56:59] took D his position
[57:02] away Hallelujah God so honored
[57:06] [Music]
[57:07] David that he literally calls himself
[57:11] the son of
[57:12] David Hallelujah but what was that God's
[57:17] goodness and
[57:19] mercy following David this is why he
[57:23] said I will dwell in the house of
[57:29] Hallelujah huj is that all right that's
[57:32] that's about
[57:33] you we make our

[58:25] counted the men of
[58:27] Israel against the desires of
[58:31] God hallelujah did God just cast him
[58:36] away God said you going to get a
[58:38] spanking for
[58:39] that look at God look at him look at he
[58:43] said I'm I'mma let you choose what what

[59:02] me the spanking right because we like
[59:04] going outside seem like that that's more
[59:07] more of a punish than anything
[59:11] else but David said God said do you want
[59:16] the men men to judge you do you want men
[59:20] to judge
[59:22] you or do you want me to judge you
[59:26] says

[59:56] but David
[59:57] understood that God was God is that
[1:00:01] right God tried him with the lion God
[1:00:05] tried him with the bear God tried him
[1:00:09] with Goliath and I love this whenever
[1:00:12] you place in a
[1:00:14] trial the trial is not just for
[1:00:19] you the trial is to give God the
[1:00:24] glory Hallelujah
[1:00:26] come on somebody think about all the
[1:00:29] people that were stricken with
[1:00:32] cancer and God healed
[1:00:35] them they had to
[1:00:37] suffer but the
[1:00:39] healing was for the
[1:00:42] unbeliever and the make
[1:00:44] believer so that they would know that
[1:00:47] God is
[1:00:48] God understand me the Bible said every
[1:00:52] knee shall bow every tongue shall
[1:00:55] confess to the glory of God the Father
[1:00:59] you understand me Jesus Christ is
[1:01:02] Lord what about
[1:01:06] Shad it wasn't just for
[1:01:09] them it was the it was for the king of
[1:01:13] Babylon he was confused he didn't know
[1:01:17] God God declared himself through those
[1:01:20] young
[1:01:21] boys hallelujah what about
[1:01:24] Daniel wasn't all about Daniel the
[1:01:28] persecution That Came Upon Daniel was
[1:01:32] also for the
[1:01:33] king that he may be able to
[1:01:37] receive or conceive in his mind that no
[1:01:41] matter how many gods they
[1:01:43] worship Daniel's God is God hallelujah
[1:01:48] and God will do the same thing for
[1:01:52] you sometimes we
[1:01:54] suffer so others can see
[1:02:00] and hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:02:02] glory to God thank God for the power of
[1:02:06] God Romans three
[1:02:11] please don't be so
[1:02:14] selfish with your
[1:02:19] testimonies because that's why God send
[1:02:21] you through
[1:02:22] trials so you can testify
[1:02:26] done for and you don't have to
[1:02:28] necessarily just always testify to
[1:02:30] Christians testify to somebody who's not
[1:02:33] a
[1:02:34] Christian you say well what that what
[1:02:37] would that do for
[1:02:38] me
[1:02:40] RAB
[1:02:42] heard about what God did in is in
[1:02:47] Egypt heard it somebody was
[1:02:52] testifying
[1:02:54] Hallelujah and were
[1:02:57] testifying Hallelujah something struck
[1:02:59] her
[1:03:01] heart what about the Queen of
[1:03:03] Sheba somebody traveling through the
[1:03:06] land of
[1:03:08] Sheba
[1:03:09] testify about what was happening over
[1:03:12] there in
[1:03:14] Israel and it struck her
[1:03:17] heart so much so she says I got to
[1:03:21] see this God that Israel is serving come
[1:03:25] on somebody
[1:03:26] see that's what I'm talking about you
[1:03:28] don't know where the seed is
[1:03:31] laying and sometime all it take is a
[1:03:34] testify a
[1:03:37] testimony and the devil said no no no no
[1:03:41] the reason why you won't testify because
[1:03:44] you forgotten the
[1:03:46] cost you have forgotten your
[1:03:49] cost what it took for God to free
[1:03:52] you and it's a selfish thing if you
[1:03:56] don't want to see somebody else
[1:03:59] free hallelujah hallelujah none of us
[1:04:02] deserve this but it's just the grace of
[1:04:06] God Romans 3 10 through
[1:04:10] 12 as it is written there is none
[1:04:14] righteous no not
[1:04:19] one there is none that understande it
[1:04:23] there is none that seeketh after God you
[1:04:26] say I sought the Lord no you
[1:04:28] didn't God called
[1:04:31] you God pulled on
[1:04:33] you many of us would have remained in
[1:04:35] the world if God hadn't gotten our
[1:04:42] attention God knows how to get
[1:04:45] you the Bible said they're all going
[1:04:49] astray excuse me they go they all going
[1:04:52] out of the
[1:04:54] way they are all together become
[1:04:58] unprofitable there is none that doth
[1:05:02] good not
[1:05:05] one so when you get ready to judge
[1:05:07] somebody
[1:05:09] else think of this
[1:05:12] scripture No not

[1:13:32] all that is in me bless His holy
[1:13:36] name now maybe I'm
[1:13:39] wrong but I have been crying out for
[1:13:43] such a
[1:13:44] fire till I can't help myself to testify
[1:13:48] and the praise God Wherever I
[1:13:53] Go you understand me I don't want my
[1:13:57] life to be seen

[1:14:15] every
[1:14:18] day y'all know what I'm talking about
[1:14:21] and sometime we let our schedules
[1:14:25] be so
[1:14:26] tight that we can't get on our knees and
[1:14:29] pray before God like we
[1:14:32] should listen what he said the second
[1:14:35] verse bless the Lord oh my soul and

[1:15:27] honest with
[1:15:29] ourselves that's how I've overcome a lot
[1:15:31] of
[1:15:32] things I stopped blaming the
[1:15:34] devil and I said God that's
[1:15:38] me I've done this thing because I like

[1:22:21] said I could have done better
[1:22:26] amen amen Romans 2 I'm almost
[1:22:32] done we're not jumping and shouting but
[1:22:34] you ought to
[1:22:38] be it's the same
[1:22:41] word I've just you you I just don't have
[1:22:43] the uh
[1:22:46] [Music]
[1:22:48] Charisma I'm not comparing
[1:22:52] either but you got to have joy Jo in the
[1:22:58] word Romans 2
[1:23:03] 3-4 because I'm going to tell you
[1:23:05] something I I
[1:23:06] realize our judging each
[1:23:09] other in the wrong way has been the
[1:23:12] greatest hindrance of
[1:23:17] all
[1:23:19] as As we judge one
[1:23:22] another especially if it's the wrong way
[1:23:26] that judgment is going to come
[1:23:29] back Romans 2
[1:23:32] 3-4 and think thou this oh
[1:23:36] man that judges them which do such
[1:23:40] things and doest the
[1:23:44] same that thou shall escape the Judgment
[1:23:47] of
[1:23:48] god so let's put it this way
[1:23:57] cuz a lot of us a lot of us sin by
[1:23:59] looking at things on TV or your
[1:24:04] phone
[1:24:06] look so nobody can see you do
[1:24:12] that but God sees
[1:24:18] it and you might see a brother or
[1:24:21] sister doing something less than that
[1:24:25] and you judge them for doing that
[1:24:27] whatever they may be
[1:24:29] doing not realizing you're doing the
[1:24:31] same thing and
[1:24:35] worse because God said if you have
[1:24:38] pleasure in those that do those
[1:24:41] things you're just as
[1:24:46] guilty is that the truth all right think
[1:24:49] about it or fourth verse or despises
[1:24:53] thou the riches
[1:24:55] of his goodness and forbearing and
[1:24:59] longsuffering is that what he saying
[1:25:01] this is what he's saying the holy
[1:25:05] spirit is has
[1:25:07] goodness he he's
[1:25:09] forbearing he's
[1:25:11] longsuffering hell with
[1:25:15] you and therefore we must be
[1:25:18] forbearing we must have long
[1:25:21] suffering hallelu we must have goodness
[1:25:25] to those who are
[1:25:27] overtaken those who are coming
[1:25:31] short what if a woman comes here and she
[1:25:35] gets saved baptized in name Jes
[1:25:37] CH but she comes she still got a makeup
[1:25:42] on still wearing a
[1:25:44] jewelry you know whatever you know what
[1:25:47] most of us will do without with that
[1:25:49] woman we going to go over there and try
[1:25:52] to clean her
[1:25:55] Hallelujah you you didn't catch the
[1:25:59] fish but you want to clean the
[1:26:02] fish like I always tell people go clean
[1:26:05] go catch your own
[1:26:08] fish when you catch when you go witness
[1:26:10] to somebody and they come in here you
[1:26:14] have a right to walk them through
[1:26:16] salvation
[1:26:18] Hallelujah but how long had it taken you
[1:26:20] to transform
[1:26:24] hear what I'm saying well you said I was
[1:26:26] born in the
[1:26:27] message but it doesn't mean you didn't
[1:26:29] slip on pants every now and
[1:26:37] again am I telling the truth it's the
[1:26:40] truth but we want people to Justified
[1:26:44] and into the
[1:26:48] headu people that born
[1:26:52] babies and if we saw show them love
[1:26:55] instead of
[1:26:56] judgment they would
[1:27:01] change that's what God wants us you're
[1:27:03] God on Earth you are the God on
[1:27:07] Earth we supposed to show his compassion
[1:27:10] his suffering his
[1:27:13] forbearing Hallelujah his
[1:27:16] goodness people supposed to see that
[1:27:18] through
[1:27:19] us that's you're the only God they going
[1:27:22] to see
[1:27:25] reflection of the Bride reflection of
[1:27:27] the groom what I
[1:27:31] right as he is this is what we supposed
[1:27:35] to be on
[1:27:38] earth Hallelujah you forget your
[1:27:43] worth hallelujah hallelujah almost done
[1:27:46] Psalm 27 I'm almost
[1:27:50] done I'm talking to me and you and
[1:27:52] everybody else in here this is for me as
[1:27:55] well because I'm
[1:27:58] learning God had to correct me the other
[1:28:00] day on something I
[1:28:03] said not individual but but the way I
[1:28:05] was
[1:28:07] thinking Hallelujah
[1:28:09] forgetting that we
[1:28:12] all are saved by
[1:28:14] grace washed in the
[1:28:16] blood some people brother B say it take
[1:28:19] them a long time to wake up to the fact
[1:28:21] that they're bride
[1:28:25] but we can't just look at them like we
[1:28:26] do
[1:28:28] Jacob and say no way Jacob could be
[1:28:31] God's we know we can say there's no way
[1:28:33] that Jacob can be God's
[1:28:37] son we look at Esau and say look how
[1:28:39] good he he he come to church every day
[1:28:42] he's always on time he's preaching for
[1:28:45] his dad and bring some powerful
