[12:48] we stand we're gonna get right into the
[12:51] word of the Lord God is good to us we
[13:03] are going to be coming from the
[13:09] scripture according to Isaiah 55 Isaiah
[13:12] 55 and 11 and then we'll run to Matthew
[13:17] the fifth chapter and the 18th verse
[13:22] isaiah 55:11
[13:41] before we read that let's read Isaiah 53
[13:45] and 553 and five for thy maker is dying
[13:53] husband every time I read that I get
[13:55] excited for thy maker is dying husband
[13:59] the Lord of Hosts is his name and
[14:02] Diadema the Holy One of Israel the god
[14:06] of the whole earth shall he be called
[14:09] for the Lord have called thee as a woman
[14:12] Forsaken and grieved in spirit and a
[14:16] wife of youth when thou was refused by
[14:19] God for a small moment have I forsaken
[14:23] thee but with great mercy will I gather
[14:26] thee as he have 55 and 11 it reads so
[14:37] shall my word be that goeth forth out of
[14:42] my mouth it shall not return unto me
[14:46] void but it shall accomplish that which
[14:48] I please and it shall prosper in the
[14:52] things where the two I sent it one more
[14:57] scripture Matthew 5
[15:05] Matthew five and we read the eighteenth
[15:12] verse for verily I say unto you till
[15:19] heaven and earth pass one jot or one
[15:23] tittle shall in no wise pass from the
[15:27] law till all be fulfilled
[15:31] let us pray father we thank you for your
[15:35] grace and your mercy we thank you for
[15:37] being so good to us we pray father god
[15:41] this tonight that your perfect will be
[15:44] done and Lord we'll be careful to give
[15:47] you the praise glory and honor in your
[15:50] name Jesus Christ we pray excuse me amen
[15:54] you may be seated I don't have a cold or
[16:01] anything it's just to Chris needs God is
[16:09] good to us and we thank God for His
[16:13] goodness and its grace as we said
[16:15] earlier we just appreciate everybody
[16:17] being here tonight trying to pick up
[16:22] where we left off talk about preparing
[16:24] to go to a different Kingdom a different
[16:28] world I can't seem to get it out of my
[16:30] heart and my thoughts because we
[16:32] realized the day in time that we're
[16:34] living in and we realize that we're
[16:37] living in the last days no matter how
[16:39] people may think of their minds we know
[16:44] that this these days are as the
[16:47] scripture says call the last days the
[16:52] thing that I really love about the Word
[16:54] of God the Bible says not one word
[16:56] should come back void everything that
[16:59] has gone out of the mouth of God it must
[17:01] be accomplished God said he was gonna
[17:04] have a bride in this day and that's
[17:05] exactly what he's gonna have we realize
[17:08] it's not going to be a lot of people
[17:09] even though there are perhaps millions
[17:12] of Christians but millions of Christians
[17:14] will not amen make a rapture because we
[17:18] realize that
[17:19] these Christians are composed of three
[17:21] kinds of believers
[17:22] you have the believer to make believer
[17:25] and the non-believer and there's always
[17:28] been that way it has always been that
[17:30] way but and we believe by God's grace
[17:33] that we are talking to the bride of
[17:34] Jesus Christ who is the believer so many
[17:38] times people do not understand that as
[17:41] we said this city is not our home this
[17:44] place is not a home even Abraham who is
[17:48] our father said that he was looking for
[17:50] a city whose builder and maker is God
[17:54] the only way that you can actually make
[17:56] heaven is that you got to go beyond the
[17:59] camp in other words Jesus Christ it's
[18:02] not own organization he's not a
[18:04] denomination he is the word the Bible
[18:07] says in the beginning was the word the
[18:08] Word was with God and the Word was God
[18:11] he is the word of God when Jesus came he
[18:15] was not part of anybody's organisation
[18:18] or denomination matter of fact in the
[18:20] scripture they asked him where did he
[18:23] get his authority from because they
[18:25] wanted to know what school he had gone
[18:27] to had he been under Gamaliel something
[18:29] like that but Jesus didn't go to school
[18:32] neither did John the Baptist because
[18:34] they were a product of the word and we
[18:37] know that the Word of God does not come
[18:39] by education or the understanding of the
[18:41] word of God doesn't come by education
[18:43] the Word of God come by revelation and
[18:46] the Bible says according to the
[18:48] scripture we realized that this
[18:51] revelation is the revelation of Jesus
[18:54] Christ and who he is amen
[18:57] because Peter Jesus asked Peter at one
[19:00] time who do men say I the Son of Man am
[19:03] of course Peter said thou art the Christ
[19:06] just going into the scripture the Son of
[19:09] the Living God because at first he asked
[19:11] he responded with you know some say that
[19:14] all your Jeremiah you know John the
[19:17] Baptist one of the prophets
[19:18] then Jesus wanted to define that bring
[19:22] it down narrow it down so he could
[19:23] understand that Peter you have a
[19:26] revelation and I want to hear this
[19:27] revelation Jesus knew he had it but he
[19:31] asked Peter so that Peter could
[19:32] understand
[19:33] and what is revelation here's some time
[19:35] you don't even know you have a
[19:36] revelation until something is preached
[19:39] or something has said user you know
[19:41] that's just the way I believe it
[19:43] so yes Peter where you know who do men
[19:46] say that I am he said thou art the
[19:48] Christ the Son of the Living God now it
[19:51] doesn't sound like much but everybody
[19:53] knew that Jesus was not only he he was a
[19:56] son of God he was a he was a prophet
[19:58] exactly right
[19:59] those who followed him knew that he was
[20:02] a prophet and the Prophet although in
[20:04] those days were called the son of man US
[20:06] than a man Ezekiel was a son of man
[20:08] Jeremiah was a son of man it was another
[20:10] term for prophet but Jesus wanted to
[20:13] find out and make Peter know that there
[20:16] was more to him than just a prophet he
[20:18] was the king prophet he was the chief
[20:20] prophet but he wanted him to know that
[20:22] there was more to him than just that and
[20:24] then when Peter said thou art the Christ
[20:27] you see that was a revelation he was a
[20:30] Jew that only believed in one God and
[20:32] they knew Christ was anointing and
[20:34] Christ was God amen and when he
[20:37] announced that he said thou art the
[20:39] Christ the Son of the Living God
[20:41] then Pete then jesus said unto Peter
[20:43] flesh and blood have not revealed this
[20:45] unto you but my father who is in heaven
[20:48] amen
[20:50] he has revealed this thing unto you is
[20:52] that right that revelation of John 10:30
[20:55] I and my father one was a revelation
[20:58] Amen that the Pharisees and all tried to
[21:02] stone him and wanted to kill him for
[21:04] that because they said hold up you being
[21:06] a man making yourself equal with God
[21:09] hallelujah but what they failed to see
[21:12] it was that not he was a man making
[21:14] himself equal with God it was God who
[21:17] was making himself a man and so you and
[21:20] I must realize by God's grace that he
[21:22] according to the book of Revelation the
[21:24] third chapter Jesus Christ was the
[21:26] beginning of God's creation hello that
[21:30] means he was the beginning of God
[21:32] creating himself in human flesh
[21:35] hallelujah and now God is doing the same
[21:39] thing hallelujah
[21:41] is that right remember when God created
[21:44] Adam Adam was a little God
[21:46] he was an amateur God and God told Adam
[21:50] amen you have dominion over everything
[21:53] and I'm just gonna tie this these
[21:55] thoughts him into what we left off with
[21:57] because I want you to understand I said
[22:00] again Adam did not replenish the earth
[22:03] with the true sons of God when in the
[22:07] days of Noah it was a high breeding of
[22:10] the sons of God that replenish the earth
[22:13] this is why God and then could kill
[22:16] everything or destroy everything because
[22:19] it was not all sons of God
[22:22] remember Enoch was the one who walked
[22:25] perfectly and the Bible said that he was
[22:27] found not and of course nor the Bible
[22:30] said that he was perfect in his
[22:32] generation meaning that he was perfect
[22:35] in his genes he did not mix his seed
[22:38] with the Serpent's all right so
[22:41] therefore at the end of the day only
[22:44] eight souls were saved in Noah day think
[22:49] about it perhaps when perhaps when Noah
[22:51] began to preach he had a thousands of
[22:54] people cuz you know people like new
[22:56] stuff more than like the 8000 he had a
[22:58] mega church but as the time when odd and
[23:02] the nerd the word began to become common
[23:04] to the people they began to drop off
[23:06] drop off drop off drop off it got so bad
[23:09] to the people who once believed began to
[23:12] mock him hallelujah like it is now those
[23:16] who once believed the message is now
[23:18] mocking the message but they fail to see
[23:21] that every word of God must come to pass
[23:25] it cannot fail no matter how long it
[23:29] takes God's gonna have a bride we are on
[23:33] a journey is that right and we must
[23:36] understand that we have no continuing
[23:39] City everything changes is that right
[23:42] think about it kingdoms have changed
[23:44] there was a time when Egypt rule he was
[23:49] nothing now you got to dig feet many
[23:52] feet just to find the ruins of Egypt
[23:55] hallelujah
[23:56] think about it Rome one time rule
[24:00] no more Persia ruled every Kingdom has
[24:04] to fall this kingdom it doesn't matter
[24:07] how United they become and this is
[24:10] what's happening now just like it was in
[24:12] the days of Babel when when Nimrod got
[24:15] all of these people together and they
[24:17] formed and began to build this big old
[24:19] temple this big old alanya man or
[24:21] whatever it was trying to build
[24:23] themselves up into heaven trying to
[24:25] escape the judgment of God because they
[24:27] said if it floods again we are out we
[24:30] will build a tower so high that the
[24:33] flood it had to be pretty high
[24:37] hallelujah because you got to realize
[24:39] that the floods even count are covered
[24:41] Mount Ararat so you got to realize that
[24:45] man they would have had to really build
[24:47] in the Bible said if God had not come
[24:50] down they would have built into the
[24:54] kingdom into that place where God was is
[24:58] that right so you must understand that
[25:00] it was not natural mortar it had to be
[25:03] something supernatural hallelujah
[25:07] because you got to understand that those
[25:09] Twin Towers look down at the clouds and
[25:14] they were not in heaven you understand
[25:17] me and understand that there's more than
[25:18] one heaven okay but we realized by the
[25:20] grace of God God has the can to come
[25:22] down says I must stop this unity except
[25:26] these people would build that build into
[25:29] heaven
[25:29] so you said what do you mean it's the
[25:31] same thing now people are trying to you
[25:34] know find colliders and you're tapping
[25:37] to the unseen and now they know it's a
[25:38] dimension and they want to open up a
[25:41] portal and all these kind of things but
[25:43] it's not nothing new Under the Sun
[25:47] according to Solomon everything that has
[25:49] been has already been everything that is
[25:52] now has already been so there's no new
[25:55] thing people think the reason why people
[25:58] think amen that we have have superseded
[26:01] we're supermen or super women because
[26:04] they fail to see that in the days of
[26:06] Noah those people were far more advanced
[26:08] than what we are hallelujah we did not
[26:12] come here by way of cavemen
[26:15] hallelujah amen we were created by the
[26:18] Almighty God with the intelligence of
[26:21] God is that right because you got to
[26:25] realize that if even after the fall men
[26:28] began to build what school did they go
[26:30] to no but they were intelligent they
[26:33] were able to tap into science
[26:35] they built building it was the first
[26:37] civilizations and all of these things
[26:39] music and music instruments and all of
[26:42] these things that we have to go to
[26:43] school to learn but there was no teacher
[26:46] there see because they were just fallen
[26:49] from the intellectual part of God and
[26:52] they knew things that perhaps didn't
[26:55] even know why they knew these things but
[26:57] they knew these things and they built
[26:58] these things and and and and and it was
[27:01] an intelligence situation you say what
[27:03] do you mean and some of us know these
[27:05] things but I'm just trying to lay a
[27:06] foundation because Amen who taught those
[27:10] people how to build the Sphynx who
[27:13] taught those people how to build a
[27:15] pyramid in which we can't do now who
[27:18] taught those people and then how they
[27:20] meant to embalm bodies that last for
[27:24] thousands of years it wasn't somebody
[27:26] out from outer space unless you're going
[27:30] to heaven talking to God it was God it
[27:34] was what we have you see what I'm trying
[27:35] to say is the intelligence are the
[27:38] education in which they had all came
[27:41] from God when we get over there there'll
[27:44] be no more schools and no more anything
[27:46] like like we've got here no more science
[27:49] anything of what we got here everything
[27:51] that we're looking at came by way of the
[27:53] fall and God is going to destroy it all
[27:55] and start all over when we get into New
[27:59] Jerusalem the new hit city
[28:00] we won't need somebody writing
[28:02] instructions on how to do things
[28:04] everything will be led by God you say I
[28:08] don't believe it let me say like this
[28:10] who taught the Robin how to build the
[28:13] nest they didn't go to school how do
[28:19] they know cuz usually when the when they
[28:23] get a page the parent flies off and go
[28:26] somewhere else
[28:26] or they come you know
[28:28] it's always a spreading out but somehow
[28:31] that knowledge is there and one thing I
[28:35] love about is that they don't build
[28:36] modern houses that Robin Ness is the
[28:40] same as has been from the time God made
[28:43] them hallelujah and he still works
[28:48] hallelujah
[28:50] think about it think about an eagle's
[28:51] nest can you build an eagle's nest but
[28:54] that eagle has oh he's a superior race
[28:58] then he can build a man a nest without
[29:03] and you have no idea on how he does it
[29:08] hello y'all understand what I'm saying
[29:10] what I'm saying is if that knowledge is
[29:13] the thing that makes you period then the
[29:14] Eagle is more superior than the man it
[29:18] ain't knowledge Solomon said listen I'm
[29:21] gonna tell you something the food dies
[29:22] in the same way the intelligent died the
[29:25] same way the fourth die they have to
[29:28] give up the ghost and you and I must
[29:31] understand him and the only intelligent
[29:33] being ever is God himself
[29:38] hallelujah there's no continuing City
[29:40] everybody gonna die like I said this
[29:43] body is a body of death I don't care
[29:46] when that baby comes in you drop that
[29:48] baby and that baby
[29:49] it's amazing how God designed it because
[29:53] man when he was first created stood
[29:55] upright he was a tree he didn't lay down
[29:57] he didn't then he stood straight up amen
[30:01] and that was God's intent that man would
[30:04] stand straight up like trees now I know
[30:08] I'm saying some things but I'm trying to
[30:10] get right back to Adam because Adam
[30:12] didn't do it and God destroyed the earth
[30:15] in those day hallelujah is that right
[30:18] and when the second Exodus came guess
[30:21] what happened everything that was not of
[30:23] God was destroyed that right now we're
[30:27] getting ready to enter into the third
[30:29] Exodus why what happens to all those who
[30:34] die in Christ we go to a place that call
[30:38] that used to be called paradise now
[30:41] call under the office it's in the sixth
[30:44] dimension and why is God preserving them
[30:47] because when we leave here we go into a
[30:50] supernatural body that's called a
[30:53] theophany hallelujah
[30:55] now that the Omni body is what we call
[30:57] the word body it is the body that Jesus
[31:00] had with his flesh chief because of the
[31:04] fall we bypass our theophany and when we
[31:07] bypass out the apne amen our theop knees
[31:11] had to go somewhere God didn't create
[31:14] your yoke theophany when he was born
[31:16] your theophany was there before you got
[31:18] here hallelujah and so you got to
[31:21] understand and then those theophanies
[31:23] must go somewhere and they are in a
[31:25] place we call heaven the Bible said your
[31:30] angel stands before the Lord
[31:32] what angel your theophany if you are
[31:36] elected and chosen by God you have
[31:38] representation in heaven already that's
[31:41] why jesus asked him saying give answer
[31:44] this question how can the Son of Man be
[31:46] on earth and in heaven at the same time
[31:48] so I ask you the question how can you be
[31:50] on earth and in heaven at the same time
[31:54] hallelujah why because God gave you a
[31:57] spiritual body Oh somebody help me here
[32:01] because Paul said if this earthly
[32:03] tabernacle be dissolved I have a
[32:06] building understand your house is a
[32:09] building it is where you reside is the
[32:12] way you live
[32:14] hallelujah said I don't believe it close
[32:16] your eyes then if you close your eyes
[32:17] you can see that there's something
[32:19] trying to look out of it that is what
[32:21] you call your spirit and soul hallelujah
[32:24] that is a being only inside of this
[32:27] house
[32:27] that's why when this house God is not
[32:30] over you just moving to another place
[32:33] hallelujah so your theophany is there
[32:36] the Prophet God said when he went beyond
[32:38] the curtain of time he saw you all there
[32:41] hallelujah is that all right you said
[32:44] well I don't know about that well let me
[32:46] ask you a question when when when when
[32:48] when Jesus was on Mount Transfiguration
[32:50] and Moses and Elijah who had died
[32:53] hundreds of years already
[32:55] a past stood there talking with Jesus
[32:59] Christ on Mount Transfiguration how
[33:02] could they be dead and alive still
[33:04] what about Samuel who the Witch of Endor
[33:08] called up for Saul and when he called
[33:10] when he was called up there was Samuel
[33:13] and then dressed in his prophets garment
[33:15] so you say what brothers what are you
[33:17] trying to say I'm trying to say it meant
[33:20] that we are traveling and we're
[33:22] traveling to a city like Abraham says
[33:25] Abraham said I look for city whose
[33:28] builder and maker is God hallelujah when
[33:33] Jesus said Amen in Saint John 14th
[33:36] chapter I go away to prepare for you a
[33:38] place that where I am there you may be
[33:41] also understand no flesh and blood
[33:45] enters into that city nothing that
[33:47] defiles we're into Internet city
[33:50] everything that's in that city has to be
[33:53] holy and it has to be original
[33:56] hallelujah nothing man-made nothing
[33:59] unoriginal will be there everything
[34:02] every thought every thought that God had
[34:05] in his mind about that city will be
[34:07] there and nothing more and nothing less
[34:10] y'all understand what I'm saying Amen
[34:13] you sure what brotherhood's uh-uh
[34:14] I was born in 1956 hey the Bible asked
[34:19] Jeremiah where were you I mean Joe where
[34:22] were you
[34:23] Amen when the sons of God shouted and
[34:26] for joy where were you and then God
[34:29] tells Jeremiah I knew you before you was
[34:31] formed in your mother's womb so Jeremiah
[34:34] had to be somewhere before he even came
[34:38] into his mother's womb I know there's a
[34:41] sounds strange but I'm gonna tell you
[34:42] something
[34:42] sign science fiction tried to mimic
[34:45] things and it may sound like it's
[34:47] fiction but this is reality hallelujah
[34:51] did you know Jesus existed before he was
[34:54] formed into Mary's womb oh come on
[34:58] somebody
[34:59] hallelujah he when he was born into
[35:02] marriage knew he wasn't he just all of a
[35:04] sudden became the Son of God in the mind
[35:06] of God he was already - so
[35:08] of God he was the Lamb of God the Bible
[35:11] said before the foundation of the world
[35:13] the lamb was slain for us not some bleep
[35:18] bleeding lamb a real man innocent man a
[35:21] holy man hallelujah a substitute who was
[35:25] Jesus Christ himself he died for your
[35:28] sins before the foundation of the world
[35:31] anyone was before the foundation of the
[35:34] world somewhere you had to be there it
[35:37] wasn't a blank space
[35:38] it said Gaza will I hope when I
[35:41] sacrifice somebody will have pity and
[35:44] then when they have pity
[35:46] I'll put their names on the Lamb's Book
[35:48] a lot no your neighbor on the name last
[35:51] book of life before the foundation of
[35:53] the world in other words God saw you he
[35:56] knew you he knew you were coming to this
[35:58] age God didn't do a little shuffling
[36:01] okay oh let me see you want to go here
[36:04] what do you will go there no sir the
[36:06] Bible said we were predestinated
[36:09] hallelujah to come in this age and
[36:12] because we have been predestinated in
[36:14] this age we have come to do one thing
[36:17] and that is to declare that Jesus Christ
[36:19] is the same yesterday today and forever
[36:23] hallelujah when it comes that's why you
[36:27] can't help but you can't help but to
[36:29] listen to the gospel
[36:30] hallelujah can try to run from it like I
[36:33] did
[36:33] ah when I was a young boy I'm saying ok
[36:36] that's for you that's for you that's for
[36:37] you and God says ah
[36:39] Uncle Sam is calling you and I got
[36:44] spanked oh yes when I ran from God God
[36:49] chased me caught up with me and they get
[36:52] back home boy you know better than this
[36:54] at the day at the end of the day when
[36:57] God finished with me I was like ah
[37:00] surrender hallelujah he meant what God
[37:06] said I will not lose one hallelujah
[37:11] is that right remember Amen when Jonah
[37:13] tried to run from his predestinated
[37:16] mission and guess what God did cut him
[37:20] off short cut him
[37:23] sent him to Nineveh amen
[37:25] on his way to Nineveh he didn't realize
[37:27] he was in the will of God hallelujah see
[37:29] a lot of time you think I'm grown
[37:31] hallelujah and you don't even know that
[37:33] you're in the will of God when you go
[37:35] the wrong way at least that's the way
[37:38] Jonah thought he was going the wrong way
[37:40] and God used that all things work
[37:44] together let me is that the truth why
[37:46] because his word cannot go board it
[37:50] cannot come back to him boy whatever God
[37:52] has appointed for you to do you're going
[37:55] to do it God would change the whole
[37:58] elements for you to make sure it's done
[38:01] because his word is him he is his word
[38:04] the word is God hallelujah so he can't
[38:08] come back boy yeah Jonah said I run
[38:13] thank God rocked the boat brought in a
[38:16] stockroom yes he did see y'all got to
[38:19] understand these DS saying that the
[38:21] people who have out in the world God had
[38:23] already done it man he shook that boat
[38:26] amen and sent the storm and Jonah had to
[38:29] confess I'm the one hey you got to
[38:33] understand sometime when you running
[38:34] from God God will cause your whole
[38:38] everything to mess up until you repent
[38:41] until you say it's me Lord I'm the
[38:43] reason why everything is going bad Jonah
[38:48] said I'm the one throw me overboard
[38:50] hallelujah God said that's exactly what
[38:53] I want you gotta realize God knew that
[38:55] Jonah was gonna be thrown overboard why
[38:57] he had already prepared the fish and as
[39:01] soon as he drew up I was thrown into the
[39:04] waters he meant he was the whale ah
[39:07] because hundreds of years later Jesus
[39:13] had to refer to Jonah Jonah was
[39:16] important for jesus' conversation in the
[39:20] future you see you got to understand
[39:24] everything of the Old Testament was
[39:26] important because of the conversation we
[39:29] would have about them to increase our
[39:32] faith is that the word the Bible said it
[39:35] is the
[39:35] of God that increases your faith and all
[39:39] these things people had to go through
[39:41] they went through for you and me
[39:45] hallelujah some things we could draw
[39:47] from is that Alright yes would and God
[39:52] knew that Nineveh idol-worshipping was
[39:57] worship of a fish God hmm so here come
[40:04] Jonah out of the mouth of nineveh's fish
[40:09] God that's why he fell down and worship
[40:12] Him they worshiped the fish y'all give
[40:19] me give me grace upset I'm trying to
[40:21] listen here he was he comes out and he
[40:23] walks out I don't know how he looked I
[40:26] don't know where he had seaweed all over
[40:28] him or whatever but by the time he hit
[40:30] the ground he started preaching you know
[40:33] don't say God knows how to make our
[40:36] change our minds hallelujah so let me
[40:39] move on by the grace of God even so Paul
[40:42] God knew he was going to use Paul right
[40:45] so I want you to understand what my
[40:47] subject is till all be fulfilled and you
[40:52] and I have a role to play we've got to
[40:54] do it they may God said there was going
[40:56] to be a bride here guess what he said
[40:59] she'll be supernatural
[41:01] that means size is gonna follow her
[41:04] she'd have the mind of Christ hallelujah
[41:07] she'll be so sold out she'll believe
[41:10] everyone in this word oh she won't say
[41:13] oh that was for yesterday's because she
[41:15] realized that Jesus Christ is the same
[41:18] yesterday today and forever whatever he
[41:20] did yesterday he can do it today and
[41:22] whatever he do today he can do it
[41:25] forever he's a God that change is not
[41:29] hallelujah I love this because I was I
[41:32] think we were here when brother get a
[41:36] Caleb said this it really stuck with me
[41:39] he said just to know he said all of this
[41:41] is the is the Word of God but it's not
[41:44] just enough to know the Word of God you
[41:46] must know the will of God for your day
[41:49] see Jonah in a boat what time was the
[41:53] will of God but God is not requiring us
[41:57] amen to build a boat on ark that's not
[42:02] the way you get the heaven now right oh
[42:04] you know Moses a except you put the
[42:07] blood on the doorpost and the little God
[42:09] and asking us to go slay some lamb but
[42:12] one time that used to be the will of God
[42:14] it is the word and there was a time it
[42:16] was the will of God but God was on
[42:18] because once the real Lamb of God came
[42:21] all those things were just shadows and
[42:24] types so that you can get an idea or
[42:27] understanding of what Jesus Christ a
[42:29] real Lamb of God was to do when he came
[42:32] here is that right cuz they said to
[42:34] Jesus what have you come to do have you
[42:36] come to destroy the law he says no I
[42:38] have not come to destroy the law I have
[42:41] come to fulfill the law he was the
[42:44] fulfillment of everything here Jesus
[42:48] Christ was shadowed in Noah's Ark right
[42:53] there were three floors to the ark
[42:56] that's right
[42:58] justification Saint Legation baptism and
[43:01] Holy Ghost
[43:01] there was only one door to the ark that
[43:04] was Jesus he said I am that door I am
[43:07] that way If any man enter in he must
[43:10] come by me hallelujah and it was that
[43:14] art Amen that that that that literally
[43:17] saved Noah's family and the same gospel
[43:23] that saved Noah's family was the same
[43:26] gospel that condemned the world is that
[43:29] right the same gospel that Moses
[43:32] preached saved millions right
[43:35] potentially and we know that the same
[43:37] gospel amen
[43:39] destroyed right so you got to understand
[43:42] him in all of those shadows and types
[43:45] Amen foot was for our understanding I
[43:47] was learning our ammunition our paths it
[43:51] was what God allowed us to see so we'll
[43:54] know what is right and what is wrong so
[43:56] we realized by God's grace amen that
[43:59] Jesus had to go out of the city in order
[44:02] to be
[44:03] crucify he wasn't crucified in Jerusalem
[44:05] it was outside of the gate hallelujah
[44:09] Amen showing that he was free right he
[44:13] wasn't something tired up he wasn't a
[44:16] part of an organization he wasn't a part
[44:18] of a denomination he was the word and if
[44:21] you and I going to be saved and make a
[44:24] rapture we must come outside of the gate
[44:27] revelation I think 17 or 18 had come out
[44:30] of her my people and be not partakers of
[44:33] her what sin if you stay there you will
[44:37] receive the plagues that's getting ready
[44:39] to strike the earth how do you think
[44:41] about it Paul had a hard time amen
[44:45] but Paul persecuted the church think
[44:48] about it you've got a murderer as a
[44:51] pastor wasn't the first one Moses was a
[44:56] murderer too and he passed it two
[44:59] million people MO or more is that right
[45:02] and here was Paul Amen who helped kill
[45:05] stealing he literally cheered the he was
[45:08] part of the group he was the one who was
[45:11] instigating stole him stone him
[45:14] clapping you know what I'm saying and
[45:17] yet God used this man you think gossip
[45:21] oh man he's got some smoke I think I'm
[45:23] gonna choose him to be the Angel of the
[45:25] church no sir God had already chosen
[45:28] this man cuz I'm caught in the
[45:30] revelation he had seven stars in his
[45:32] hand and Paul was one of them before he
[45:35] was ever manifested Paul was already in
[45:39] the hand of God hallelujah and so is it
[45:43] with us before we are ever manifested we
[45:46] were already a part of the bride of
[45:48] Jesus Christ hallelujah time cannot
[45:51] change this no devil can stop it
[45:55] hallelujah
[45:56] hey man they tried to kill us off they
[45:59] men through through through the Dark
[46:00] Ages by burning us to the stake and
[46:03] crucify us upside down and cutting our
[46:06] heads off have you ever read the foxes
[46:07] Book of Martyrs all kinds of stuff this
[46:10] discharge that was in the name of the
[46:13] church did Holly
[46:16] but the problem crease Jesus Christ
[46:19] right move right on because they failed
[46:22] to see that the church had to go into
[46:26] the ground like any seed hallelujah
[46:29] hey man and during that time of smyrna
[46:31] where all those was being crucified and
[46:33] killed and butchered and everything they
[46:36] didn't understand they had what we call
[46:39] and you and i know the four beasts one
[46:41] of them was the ox
[46:42] right and so they bore that opps and
[46:45] that art a man is the spirit of
[46:48] sacrifice hallelujah we can look back he
[46:51] said we don't know how they did it well
[46:53] they didn't do it on the old it's not by
[46:55] power it's not by might but by my
[46:58] experience it has always been by this
[47:00] you go get victory tonight it'll never
[47:03] be your own strength it'll never be what
[47:06] you think you can do it's always the
[47:08] power of God that gives you victory
[47:10] hallelujah always understand Amen that
[47:15] even then those people you don't think
[47:17] you you you know I can't imagine when
[47:19] they were thrown to the Lions they
[47:21] didn't run away from the Lions they ran
[47:23] to the Lions it was an inspiration going
[47:26] on there
[47:27] hallelujah didn't Paul didn't run from
[47:30] the charcoal chopping block he said I've
[47:32] got to go see Nero hallelujah
[47:35] why because Paul said if this earth the
[47:37] tabernacle be dissolved I've got one oh
[47:39] I love it Paul wasn't the same no sure
[47:43] he said listen I fought a good fight I
[47:45] have finished the course I have kept the
[47:48] faith
[47:49] his father is laid up for me a crown of
[47:52] righteousness the Lord the righteous
[47:55] judge would give me at that day not only
[47:58] me but all that love his appearing
[48:01] do you love his appearing here what when
[48:04] did he do when did he appear in 1963
[48:07] they are trying to figure it out
[48:09] amen but here was a seven angel come
[48:12] down from heaven amen and developed a
[48:14] cloud that went far beyond what clouds
[48:17] can make hallelujah and then when we
[48:20] turned it to the right it was the face
[48:22] of Jesus Christ hallelujah it was what
[48:24] we've been looking for that's what Jesus
[48:27] said the Son of Man will come in the
[48:28] clouds hallelujah
[48:30] but one of these old days he's literally
[48:32] coming hallelujah in body form but he
[48:34] came in his appearing fall and what was
[48:37] he doing he was preparing the bride for
[48:40] a rapture it wasn't just any kind of
[48:43] message it was a secret coming
[48:45] hallelujah and it was a message that God
[48:48] was giving his bride to do what how to
[48:50] prepare herself for the world to come
[48:53] hallelujah we have here no continuing
[48:57] City but all the yonder hallelujah is a
[49:01] city that's internal Holland is that
[49:03] right because the Bible said the kingdom
[49:05] of God not only can it not be shaken but
[49:08] it cannot be moved why because it is God
[49:12] hallelujah when you're sick and tired of
[49:15] this whole life and you love the
[49:18] appearing of the Lord Jesus better than
[49:21] you love the food on your table or your
[49:24] wife or your children then there's a
[49:27] crown laid up for you not a crown of
[49:30] gold to put upon your head but a body
[49:34] y'all heard me not just a crown to put
[49:38] on your head you know everybody we
[49:39] thought oh I need my crown not a crown
[49:42] but this crown a man is like the
[49:44] crowning of a tooth hallelujah he covers
[49:48] the real thing and you and I must
[49:50] understand that this crown Amen is your
[49:53] body
[49:54] hallelujah a body Amen that's what free
[49:58] from pain glory crown in the glory of
[50:02] God
[50:02] crown in the immortal tality of Jesus
[50:05] Christ
[50:05] see that's what lead up for you right
[50:09] not just a theophany a glorified body
[50:14] that's your crown that's the real crown
[50:17] I'm not saying you won't have any crowns
[50:20] like those 24 elders had they had that
[50:23] but you got to understand they also had
[50:26] a glorified body - hallelujah because
[50:30] when Jesus Christ rose from the day
[50:32] hallelujah the Bible said the graves
[50:34] were open and those that slap rose from
[50:38] the day God understand me has happened
[50:41] before and is gonna happen
[50:43] hallelujah when the people least
[50:46] expected hallelujah remember when they
[50:50] rose from the dead there was a great
[50:52] earthquake and you're not know it's
[50:57] coming like they say when California
[50:59] fall not if it's going to fall and they
[51:03] said that that our fault is locked and
[51:06] loaded and don't you realize Amen that
[51:10] when it falls it's not going to just
[51:11] shake and just you know according to the
[51:14] prophecy it's going to go and it's going
[51:16] to fall right into the sea that ocean is
[51:19] going to swell up a tidal wave it's
[51:21] going to come far into the Salton Sea
[51:24] hallelujah and what you don't understand
[51:27] is that Arizona will then have a beach
[51:30] line Oh
[51:34] people don't understand I always tell
[51:36] people you see these Mountain something
[51:38] push those mountains up and whatever
[51:41] push them up one day is going to bring
[51:43] them down
[51:44] hallelujah amen so we are in a place
[51:48] right now that you and I must first
[51:50] understand that there is something going
[51:53] to take place and without it without
[51:55] this message without the knowledge of
[51:58] how to prepare yourself you won't make
[52:00] it he ain't coming back for just a
[52:02] nominal Christians because nominal
[52:04] Christians are hybrids they mix with
[52:06] creeds and dogmas they mix with all
[52:09] kinds of stuff
[52:10] amen that and they said well you know we
[52:11] don't have to do that in the Word of God
[52:12] and the Word of God declares it but they
[52:14] said well my church don't do it so we
[52:16] don't have to do it that is Satan's lie
[52:19] hallelujah Romans 4:17 said listen as it
[52:23] is written have made their father Toma
[52:25] and Abraham before him who he believed
[52:28] even God who quickened the dead and call
[52:30] those things that be not as though they
[52:32] were that is such a revelation cuz
[52:36] you're calling those things that be not
[52:38] as though they were oh you know oh I am
[52:41] so weak because the Bible said when you
[52:43] weak he's strong those negative things
[52:46] should never come out of your mouth
[52:48] because when he you a weak he's strong
[52:52] hallelujah is not by power not by might
[52:55] but by my
[52:56] Piron saith the lord hallelujah and you
[52:59] and i must understand amen and we be
[53:02] Abraham's seed we must speak as gods now
[53:07] we ain't V God we are not Elohim but we
[53:11] are children of God and if what God is
[53:14] going to have a child it's gonna be a
[53:15] god right we'll call a mature God's
[53:18] Messiah as however you want to say it
[53:20] that's the way we are anointed ones it's
[53:27] not the body the human flesh does make
[53:29] you is it's the Holy Spirit that's on
[53:30] you
[53:31] you said holy mountain well the only way
[53:33] I'll haunting and be holy is that the
[53:35] holy God is on the mountain if there's a
[53:37] holy man it means that the holy God is
[53:39] in the man ain't nothing holy about us
[53:42] it's God with us right so you and I must
[53:46] understand Amen that listen eight God
[53:49] will try it and see whether your faith
[53:53] is true or not he told Abraham you gonna
[53:56] have a son hallelujah and God waited to
[54:02] Abraham himself was not able to produce
[54:07] Sarah was her moon was already dead but
[54:11] God waited another period to - Abraham
[54:14] was dead - he wasn't able to reproduce
[54:17] all of his glands were all dried up and
[54:20] everything else
[54:21] it was then God brought forth Isaac
[54:25] hallelujah but the Bible said that
[54:27] Abraham staggered not at the promise of
[54:30] God I'm going back to it if God said he
[54:33] was gonna have a baby
[54:35] that's exactly right no matter how much
[54:37] the trials happening the trials came
[54:39] when those trials came I can almost hear
[54:42] Abraham said it's gonna happen how do
[54:44] you know because God said so and he that
[54:48] comes to God must first believe that he
[54:50] is God and that he's a reward of them
[54:53] that Jill is a secant he's gotta be God
[54:55] I was telling my grandson there today
[54:57] I'd say he's God that means nobody else
[55:00] is greater there's nobody above him and
[55:03] he said if there be one if there be
[55:06] another I don't know him hallelujah
[55:09] and we serve a God that cannot lie Oh
[55:13] somebody help me here so why do we fret
[55:16] oh I got all these problems problems if
[55:19] the same God that created the heavens
[55:21] holding the Sun in His grace holding the
[55:24] moon in this place holding the stars in
[55:26] his grace and he ain't God yet
[55:29] hallelujah because God is God and at the
[55:33] same time he can take care of you think
[55:37] about it God had to show Moses who he
[55:40] really was
[55:41] Moses has seen a lot of things in Egypt
[55:43] he had seen frogs he saw fleas
[55:46] he saw all kinds of hailstones and
[55:48] everything else he saw the acts of God
[55:50] but one day God blow Jesus Lord I want
[55:54] to know you better I want to see you who
[55:56] who you really are you you understand me
[55:58] it's not enough to see miracles signs
[56:01] and wonders you'd need to know God and
[56:03] God said okay I'll show you Moses Who I
[56:06] am
[56:07] but see this this rock here he's got a
[56:09] cleft he I want you to hide yourself in
[56:10] the cleft of the rock when you hide in
[56:13] the cleft of the rock
[56:14] that's when God's going to reveal
[56:16] himself to you hallelujah and he says
[56:19] Moses you can't see my face he didn't
[56:22] know why God Moses couldn't see his face
[56:25] because the law represents the backside
[56:29] of God hallelujah but the face
[56:33] represents grace and in this day God
[56:38] reveals to us his face but in Moses day
[56:41] he could only see the backside and Moses
[56:44] head when he passed by me he was a man
[56:47] hallelujah and that's what he saw he saw
[56:50] God Amen a more fake God coming into a
[56:54] place and putting on a man is that right
[56:56] the Bible said God in Christ was the
[56:59] fullness of the Godhead bodily
[57:01] that means everything that was in God in
[57:04] God he poured it into Christ and
[57:07] therefore everything is in Christ he
[57:09] pours it into his bride that's what we
[57:12] call the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is
[57:15] not some separate God it is God but when
[57:18] you got the real one that means the same
[57:20] character that was in Jesus supposed to
[57:22] be
[57:23] yes hallelujah understand this God is
[57:26] gonna only marry character and the Bible
[57:30] said that Abraham staggered not at the
[57:32] promise is a God am I making sense
[57:35] he never fret he didn't know how God was
[57:38] gonna do it but he knew he was going to
[57:40] do it that's when God said hey I'm
[57:42] giving you the son now I want you to go
[57:44] sacrifice him any man you know how the
[57:48] movie saying oh how you gonna do this no
[57:51] Abraham staggered not at the promise of
[57:54] God he never worried he never fret he
[57:57] just got his son and all the equipment
[57:59] he says let's go up on this mountain
[58:01] why because Abraham knew what he used to
[58:05] be he was an old man and perhaps stooped
[58:08] shoulders and everything else and God
[58:10] had transformed his body he is Sarah
[58:12] into a new being which was a shadow in
[58:15] the type of the resurrection hallelujah
[58:17] a newbie you think of 90 old woman could
[58:22] have a baby and then go down there to
[58:25] Egypt and the King said whom I eat that
[58:30] a beautiful grandma no she was the
[58:33] prettiest woman in Egypt and he saw
[58:35] Abraham with that lady
[58:37] and that's when Abraham said Oh Sarah
[58:39] you gotta tell him that you're my sister
[58:41] cuz he find out that you're my wife he's
[58:44] gonna kill me
[58:45] you think that Keane was gonna kill uh
[58:48] uh uh hey with him over old woman no she
[58:52] was beautiful how because she was the
[58:55] type of the change that God is gonna
[58:57] take it do us hallelujah hallelujah I'm
[59:02] looking for the change that's all I'm
[59:05] saying
[59:05] when they crown him king of kings and
[59:08] Lord of lots I gotta be there
[59:11] hallelujah is that right the Bible says
[59:14] Amen is Zechariah 14 and 9 and the Lord
[59:17] shall be king over the all the earth in
[59:19] that day shall till there be one Lord
[59:22] and his name is one now how can he

[1:00:25] where's the food where's the water we
[1:00:27] need meat I'm tired of this bread see
[1:00:29] they enjoy eating and God said listen

[1:01:45] sometimes we think our lives are so so
[1:01:47] so bad we can't even
[1:01:49] I don't know Amen what this a woman that
[1:01:51] Jericho was thinking may have but maybe
[1:01:55] she had down days and thinking oh there
[1:01:57] is no way I could ever you know be mount
[1:01:59] to nothing I'm a prostitute I live up on
[1:02:01] the wall I see who come I know all the
[1:02:04] news I know who come I know who go
[1:02:06] everybody know me but inside I'm empty
[1:02:09] until one day she heard about a real God
[1:02:13] she heard it meant thoughtlessness
[1:02:15] listen the children of Israel was in the
[1:02:18] wilderness for forty years and that
[1:02:21] rumor or that saying of what how either
[1:02:24] got whooped by Moses was still living
[1:02:27] hallelujah and she heard the report she
[1:02:30] had never seen it she didn't never seen
[1:02:33] Moses or anybody but she believed that
[1:02:36] this God that destroyed Egypt was the
[1:02:38] true God so when those spies came in and
[1:02:42] needed a place to stay here she comes
[1:02:45] do you realize that God had planted her
[1:02:48] there she was seed and God planted her
[1:02:53] dad y'all better hear what I'm saying
[1:02:55] it may sound Elementary and you may say
[1:02:57] oh I don't heard this before you better
[1:02:59] hear what I'm saying because you've got
[1:03:01] a real one day you're gonna cut you're
[1:03:03] gonna need to know who you are these
[1:03:06] stories that you're hearing now is only
[1:03:09] to build your faith on who you are and
[1:03:10] what God will do for you hallelujah eat
[1:03:14] something that I'm preaching a mentor
[1:03:16] tickle your ear I'm trying to get you to
[1:03:18] understand that God is in your favor and
[1:03:20] you got to do what God wants you to do
[1:03:24] they said nothing happens by chance you
[1:03:28] didn't happen to be born in the family
[1:03:29] he was born in hallelujah God chose it
[1:03:33] to be so all the hard trials and tests
[1:03:36] you go through God did that but he had a
[1:03:41] greater plan for you hallelujah how do
[1:03:45] you think a country bar from South
[1:03:47] Carolina gets all the way up in Des
[1:03:50] Moines Iowa and he hates coal whether
[1:03:54] you think that this was my choice ha ha
[1:03:59] God chose it
[1:04:01] he told me his will I came because of
[1:04:03] his with her not mine
[1:04:05] right so you got to understand when it
[1:04:07] comes to God he'll plant you and push
[1:04:10] you and move you where he wants you to
[1:04:11] move and when he gets you that then
[1:04:13] he'll operate I have things done amen
[1:04:17] hallelujah
[1:04:19] is that Alright amen the stampers are
[1:04:25] not here but I think about our sister
[1:04:30] chapels who how they connected I never
[1:04:34] forget that because I assisted Alana had
[1:04:36] broken her arm and she was at the Oscar
[1:04:39] to get it fixed and I think they saw
[1:04:41] sister Shepherd or sister shop I saw
[1:04:43] them passing out books are they were I
[1:04:45] don't forgot I have a story but the
[1:04:46] point is it was too timely because they
[1:04:49] were looking for a place and they
[1:04:51] thought about moving back a to
[1:04:52] jeffersonville somewhere and then when
[1:04:54] she came and they connected they've been
[1:04:56] coming ever since not explained that
[1:04:58] were to be give me the odds that that
[1:05:00] happening how God was timing everything
[1:05:06] and he's doing the same thing in your
[1:05:08] life now so let me go ahead on remember
[1:05:11] the Bible says are calling the first
[1:05:13] Peter 5:6 tr8 humble yourself before
[1:05:16] therefore unto the mighty hand of God
[1:05:18] that he may exalt you in due time
[1:05:22] now how many y'all we remember Samson
[1:05:25] was raised up to destroy the Philistines
[1:05:28] that right even at his birth it was told
[1:05:31] that God was raising him up to destroy
[1:05:34] the Philistines but what happened to
[1:05:36] Samson he fell in love with with Delilah
[1:05:39] Delilah and by falling in love with
[1:05:41] Delilah he became a failure but in the
[1:05:44] mind of God God had already spoken it
[1:05:47] how is this thing gonna be now he's
[1:05:49] blind he's on a wheel now grinding huh
[1:05:54] going in the same circle like some of us
[1:05:56] are doing same circle a man the devil
[1:05:59] making mockery out of you hallelujah he
[1:06:02] know what you used to be and now you
[1:06:04] have no testimony because you have
[1:06:06] failed God looked like it's all over but
[1:06:12] one thing that
[1:06:13] this thing I love is that God gave him a
[1:06:17] covenant and he's given the proud of
[1:06:20] Jesus Christ and unconditional covenant
[1:06:22] meaning is not what you do it doesn't
[1:06:25] mean matter how many times you fail it's
[1:06:28] what I've done for you already
[1:06:30] hallelujah no body could take Samson's
[1:06:34] place God raised him up hallelujah
[1:06:38] something happened on the inside of his
[1:06:40] heart and he realized he still had the
[1:06:42] Covenant when he felt back there and
[1:06:44] felt those seven locks hallelujah
[1:06:45] hallelujah and he said let me die with
[1:06:49] my enemy who I loved that scene and he
[1:06:52] pushes those pillows and the Bible said
[1:06:55] he ended up in the Hall of Fame corner
[1:06:57] Hebrews he did he kill more Philistines
[1:07:00] in his death and he did in this lifetime
[1:07:02] hallelujah and see you gotta understand
[1:07:05] the word cannot come back boy whatever
[1:07:09] God speaks out of his mouth it must come
[1:07:13] to pass no matter what a man just give
[1:07:16] me a few more minutes listen the devil
[1:07:20] he's he'll understand he's on the defeat
[1:07:22] of Jesus right and if you are the skin
[1:07:26] of the feet he's under you you
[1:07:32] understand me
[1:07:32] amen just come to him trust him as your
[1:07:35] physician and let him inoculate you now
[1:07:38] from temptations that's what we need a
[1:07:43] dose of the Holy Ghost that right you'll
[1:07:45] be tempted of course but a good strong
[1:07:48] plant don't have to be spraying it's
[1:07:51] strong and powerful its resistance
[1:07:55] throws off the evil parasites and that's
[1:08:00] the way a good strong Christian he can
[1:08:02] overcome all temptation ah he can
[1:08:06] overcome all temptations because it
[1:08:10] overthrows all the things of the world
[1:08:13] now it's not you but it's Christ in you
[1:08:16] that's why you got to get the Holy Ghost
[1:08:18] great is he that is in you than he that
[1:08:21] is in the world hallelujah and as long
[1:08:24] as you can recognize this God is in you
[1:08:27] oh you more than a conquerer hallelujah
[1:08:31] yeah
[1:08:33] remember when he ascended on high see
[1:08:36] you're raised with him you're in the
[1:08:40] body and you're with Christ right now
[1:08:42] seated in heavenly places if you're the
[1:08:46] skin like I said at the bottom of the
[1:08:48] feet every devil is underneath you
[1:08:50] that's right exactly the church where is
[1:08:53] the head is the body is with it and if
[1:08:56] we be buried and if we be buried died
[1:08:59] buried in Christ then we raise with him
[1:09:02] in his resurrection and set in the
[1:09:05] heavenly places in Christ Jesus with
[1:09:07] every fire of hell under us you
[1:09:11] understand me
[1:09:12] so you can understand Adam was supposed
[1:09:16] to have dominion and because he failed
[1:09:20] he lost his dominion over the earth
[1:09:24] Adam had the power to command the wind
[1:09:26] you say well where you get that from
[1:09:28] because Jesus according to the Bible was
[1:09:31] the second Adam and when the width and
[1:09:34] the wave began to blow the second Adam
[1:09:37] which was a which was the real the real
[1:09:39] of the other
[1:09:41] of the type he said peace be still and
[1:09:44] his disciple says what manner of man is
[1:09:47] this that the wind and the sea obey well
[1:09:50] that's the same thing out of hand before
[1:09:52] he lost it
[1:09:53] hallelujah hey man you said oh Jesus
[1:09:58] created bread well of course you know in
[1:10:00] the Garden of Eden didn't have bread but
[1:10:02] whatever
[1:10:02] Adam command whether it be wind whether
[1:10:05] it be animals whether be plant whether
[1:10:07] be trees whatever it was it had to obey
[1:10:10] because God has set him there as the god
[1:10:13] of the earth he was a reflection like
[1:10:17] Jesus was of the invisible God
[1:10:20] hallelujah so now who are you what are
[1:10:24] you what did you come to do see God God
[1:10:29] ain't playing and what we must
[1:10:30] understand that these things must happen
[1:10:32] now we can't get ahead of God but when
[1:10:35] he comes out we need to be ready you
[1:10:38] understand me
[1:10:39] everywhere
[1:10:40] of God should be you should be eating
[1:10:42] his Bible and eating this word like like
[1:10:44] like he's gonna come the very day you
[1:10:46] know me
[1:10:46] why because you eat the word there's a
[1:10:49] season that this word is gonna live
[1:10:52] you're not eating all of this word for
[1:10:53] you to just get fat God has something
[1:10:56] that he's got in mind for you and I to
[1:10:58] do it's the truth it's all Brotherhood's
[1:11:03] when you say look at that woman met
[1:11:05] Jesus at the well she had a better
[1:11:07] revelation than the doctors of divinity
[1:11:09] in Jesus's day they called him a devil
[1:11:11] but when God came their Jesus stood
[1:11:14] there and told that woman you have five
[1:11:15] husband the one you God is not your own
[1:11:17] she says surely we know that when the
[1:11:19] Messiah comes he's gonna tell us these
[1:11:21] things she had a knowledge that the
[1:11:23] Messiah would be a prophet and would be
[1:11:25] able to discern the very thoughts
[1:11:26] intents of a heart and the Bible says
[1:11:28] she dropped her water pot and she ran
[1:11:30] toward the city and say come see a man
[1:11:32] this a woman in her testimony had a
[1:11:35] whole city come out and they believed
[1:11:37] her testimony hallelujah now what are we
[1:11:41] doing y'all understand me
[1:11:45] this lady hadn't even gone to Pentecost
[1:11:47] but she met Jesus and believed that he
[1:11:51] was the son of God he was the Messiah
[1:11:54] because the Messiah is another term for
[1:11:55] son of God he was the son of God come
[1:11:58] see this man it's not this a prophet
[1:11:59] that Moses spoke ah now see what I'm
[1:12:03] saying y'all look like y'all so alive I
[1:12:08] [Music]
[1:12:11] know you're tired so let me hurry you
[1:12:18] got to understand the resistance I'm
[1:12:19] coming now you we can look and he says
[1:12:22] Oh Moses he didn't panic yes he did
[1:12:26] when Pharaoh army came after Moses he
[1:12:29] was trapped do you think that God is not
[1:12:31] going to trap you God gonna put you in a
[1:12:33] position where you don't you won't know
[1:12:35] how to get out of it when the World
[1:12:38] Council of Churches and everything come
[1:12:40] after you they know whether you can run
[1:12:42] they got too many things they got heat
[1:12:45] things you can show you when you're
[1:12:46] running through the woods they got they
[1:12:49] got all kinds of stuff you know make
[1:12:51] sure you leave your phone home
[1:12:54] you gotta understand they know where you
[1:12:57] live they know where you're going and
[1:12:59] people don't understand that's coming
[1:13:01] what we call it like that Jews had a
[1:13:03] holy cause this one coming it won't be
[1:13:06] over there it'll be all around the world
[1:13:08] yeah that's why the Liberals are moving
[1:13:11] they're moving and getting into place
[1:13:13] y'all don't understand what you see in
[1:13:15] something you sing this country change
[1:13:17] and you gotta understand their who
[1:13:19] becomes the enemy the Christian okay
[1:13:24] y'all can wake up it is the Christian
[1:13:27] who's going to become the enemy our
[1:13:30] Bible talks about kids they already
[1:13:33] calling this Bible a hate book the real
[1:13:39] Christians will stand for the truth even
[1:13:42] if it costs their lives oh just listen
[1:13:46] to something other day where Muslims say
[1:13:48] they would be so proud to die for Allah
[1:13:50] I'd love to see a Christian that says
[1:13:52] they didn't really mean it you know we
[1:13:56] try to go the easy way the least the way
[1:13:58] of existence resistance rather but God
[1:14:02] has a resistance amen coming in your way
[1:14:04] to do what try you hallelujah Oh Judas
[1:14:10] thought he was doing something when you
[1:14:11] betrayed Christ maybe he thought Jesus
[1:14:13] will say no I'm not the one he made a
[1:14:15] mistake no Jesus acknowledge who he was
[1:14:20] he wasn't afraid of the pressure he
[1:14:22] wasn't afraid even though he knew he was
[1:14:25] going to Calvary knew he was going to be
[1:14:27] crucified he still acknowledged it and
[1:14:30] he went ha he was prayed up he knew that
[1:14:35] word spoke of his day and his hour
[1:14:38] how about you he was aware all OH

[1:14:44] us will become martyrs trouble as well

[1:14:54] want to call it but it's gonna be
[1:14:55] everything against you
[1:14:57] politics the world is falling apart
[1:15:02] pestilence did you all know that that
[1:15:05] there is a disease coming
[1:15:08] it will eat the flesh of the people
[1:15:10] why'd they yet live and the only people
[1:15:13] that will escape this would be those who
[1:15:16] are filled with the Holy Ghost we got
[1:15:19] fresh eating diseases right now every
[1:15:24] time every every so often you got a new
[1:15:26] development of some kind of virus
[1:15:28] killing people they got another one
[1:15:30] moving call call it's caused by some
[1:15:33] kind of bug or something I don't know
[1:15:34] but my point is we fail to see that this
[1:15:37] is this is this is science doing all of
[1:15:39] this stuff if you don't believe that you
[1:15:43] believe in evolution everything that's
[1:15:49] been perverted everything that's been
[1:15:50] hybrid amen you know swapped up and this
[1:15:53] and that the other has been called by
[1:15:55] people in the laboratory and listen
[1:16:00] people is oh it's going to happen again
[1:16:02] and what we fail to see is that these
[1:16:04] people are now insane and if you know ho
[1:16:09] my god I thought oh Lord I thought when
[1:16:12] I was here I said Lord you know the
[1:16:15] morning can come up with some bad stuff
[1:16:17] you know but when I when I was in
[1:16:19] Arizona
[1:16:20] I saw something they should have locked
[1:16:22] him up everything was naked
[1:16:25] everything was naked are y'all so quiet
[1:16:32] because I want you to understand you got
[1:16:34] to be prepared now you think you think
[1:16:37] this God is trying to tell you something
[1:16:39] and you know brother books done studied
[1:16:40] and he done he don't even try to get
[1:16:42] something y'all I'm telling you if
[1:16:44] anybody know that this message is from
[1:16:45] God I do do you think I would play with
[1:16:48] God no absolutely not
[1:16:51] and God is trying to get a message over
[1:16:53] and I just trust that you're here
[1:16:56] because I'm gonna tell you something
[1:16:57] something is moving in both ways people
[1:17:00] are dying spiritually and some are
[1:17:01] waking up
[1:17:03] that's just all to it now I want you to
[1:17:06] know that this world council of churches
[1:17:08] and everything that's moving the Bible
[1:17:10] said these have one mind and shall give
[1:17:12] their power and strength unto the Beast
[1:17:16] hallelujah and everybody know who the
[1:17:19] Beast is they used to we understood
[1:17:22] the Beast was the church that said on
[1:17:24] seven hills but now the denomination's
[1:17:27] has smooth that thing out they have
[1:17:28] joined back into that and they don't
[1:17:30] know they have become the daughters of
[1:17:31] the holiday right and is you and me who
[1:17:35] know the truth that these people will
[1:17:38] come after you oh yeah it's going to
[1:17:41] happen whether you like it or not it's
[1:17:44] going to happen the Bible says and they
[1:17:47] shall make war with the lamb and the
[1:17:49] lamb shall overcome them huh
[1:17:51] what lamb not just Jesus us we are the
[1:17:55] body of Christ we are what we call the
[1:17:57] lamb hallelujah and they're going to
[1:18:00] what what the Bible said the one who
[1:18:02] overcomes if you overcome you're going
[1:18:04] to be tried but if you overcome right
[1:18:07] he said if you suffer with me you're
[1:18:09] reigning with me right y'all say oh you
[1:18:14] strong but you got to understand the
[1:18:16] devil said to God says listen let me
[1:18:18] take touch Joe flesh he had already
[1:18:21] taken his wife his family and all these
[1:18:23] children and Catalan everything he had
[1:18:25] he said but there's one more thing I
[1:18:26] want to try them on let me trust his
[1:18:28] flesh skins for skin what will a man
[1:18:31] give for his life I'm telling y'all when
[1:18:35] I was in the hospital that time and it
[1:18:36] seemed like I was having a heart attack
[1:18:37] that pain was the greatest pain I ever
[1:18:39] had in my entire life and I wanted it to
[1:18:42] stop so bad I if I would have given
[1:18:45] anything they would have asked me for
[1:18:46] and I yeah I'm telling you y'all think
[1:18:52] y'all no pain you've never suffered pain
[1:18:55] pain will drive you out of your mind and
[1:18:58] you just want it to stop now I know why
[1:19:02] they peel them things off like that and
[1:19:04] skinned people folks we have no idea the
[1:19:08] kind of man you think you are it to it
[1:19:10] these people who can take that kind of
[1:19:12] pain must be trained to take it y'all
[1:19:16] hear me we look at there in the time
[1:19:19] when they were killing people in there
[1:19:20] in the Dark Ages and everything else and
[1:19:22] we said how could they give up Christ
[1:19:24] let somebody put you in a rotisserie
[1:19:27] with the fire underneath you and turn
[1:19:30] you as you cook that's what they did
[1:19:33] don't save me
[1:19:35] Mazhar still living just in different
[1:19:38] people hallelujah
[1:19:40] you said what do you mean why do you
[1:19:41] think Hollywood get their inspiration
[1:19:43] from they don't get it from heaven they
[1:19:46] get it from demon power that experience
[1:19:49] and seeing these things happening and
[1:19:51] they're coming again and what have they
[1:19:53] done to our generation they have made
[1:19:56] them bloodthirsty I just read the other
[1:20:00] day where this man killed his wife and
[1:20:02] four babies for babies yesterday a day
[1:20:08] before that these young people saw their
[1:20:13] friend get killed stabbed teamed up
[1:20:17] stabbed and you know what instead of
[1:20:19] helping him you know what they did they
[1:20:21] filmed it don't tell me that that's not
[1:20:26] insanity that's insanity a friend the
[1:20:31] Bible said a friend a real friend will
[1:20:33] stick closer than a brother is that the
[1:20:39] truth for all people of God you know you
[1:20:41] did it we all bear worship there was a
[1:20:44] really bad you know they they sacrificed
[1:20:46] their children bear worship now but they
[1:20:50] legally have set up clinics right
[1:20:54] we call them abortions but that's
[1:20:57] nothing but bail worship sacrificing
[1:21:01] their children the same spirit that was
[1:21:03] it and you know they doing it legally
[1:21:04] now they're trying to pass a bill that
[1:21:07] you can bought the baby all the way up
[1:21:09] to the ninth month
[1:21:10] what is that people it's a devil now
[1:21:13] manifesting himself and you go speak out
[1:21:17] against that you've got to realize amen
[1:21:21] just like the devil is increasing God is
[1:21:24] still working on his people and he will
[1:21:26] have a bride and I'm gonna tell you
[1:21:28] something the only way you've been able
[1:21:30] to come to this this age it must be by
[1:21:33] divine love hallelujah is that right
[1:21:36] because about said love conquers all
[1:21:42] I'm almost done now straw from heaven
[1:21:45] open this is what people to understand
[1:21:47] you got you to this army this is a
[1:21:49] training place a place that God is
[1:21:51] training you you just thought you just
[1:21:53] don't you just don't just get in his
[1:21:55] army you got to be trained because he
[1:21:58] would need comes back on the white horse
[1:22:00] and people understand it's a real deal
[1:22:04] they don't even understand why these
[1:22:06] fine saucers and everything they see and
[1:22:09] they don't even have no idea they think
[1:22:10] of some kind of aliens or something God
[1:22:13] have mercy it's all in the Bible I'm
[1:22:17] almost done and I suffer from salt I
[1:22:21] excuse me and I saw heaven opened and
[1:22:23] behold a white horse and he said upon
[1:22:26] him was called faithful and true and in
[1:22:28] righteousness l he the judge and make
[1:22:31] war
[1:22:32] his eyes were flame of fire and on his
[1:22:36] head were many crowns and he had a name
[1:22:39] written that no man knew but he himself
[1:22:41] and he was clothed with a vesture dipped
[1:22:44] in blood and his name is called the Word
[1:22:47] of God and the armies which were in
[1:22:50] heaven followed him upon horses clothed
[1:22:52] and fine living white and clean just
[1:22:56] like the man said well I'm probably a
[1:22:57] god brother branham you know you said
[1:22:59] you saw a horse up there hello I'll be
[1:23:03] riding the horse will you be one what a
[1:23:10] fine one I don't know how he's getting
[1:23:12] in how he's moving but I'm on him
[1:23:14] and people said well I don't know about
[1:23:17] all of that well I can go to Ezekiel and
[1:23:19] I can show you this lion you know ox
[1:23:23] heaven is what people understand it's
[1:23:25] another world it's another dimension
[1:23:28] it's not something fictitious it's real
[1:23:32] mmm I'm still gonna actually think oh
[1:23:34] how did God do it the Bible said God
[1:23:36] grabbed him by the hairs of his head and
[1:23:37] took him up y'all gotta understand
[1:23:44] people who you know that is so
[1:23:45] ridiculous no it's not Jesus Christ had
[1:23:49] a body after his resurrection he walked
[1:23:50] through the wall that's the kind of body
[1:23:54] see that's what why we yearn we're not
[1:23:56] just yearning to be Christian when
[1:23:57] you're earning to go back to where we
[1:23:59] came from I know it sounds for tshis but
[1:24:03] real hallelujah I'm done because when
[1:24:12] Jesus comes he comes with his vengeance
[1:24:15] and the Bible said that he he's
[1:24:18] accompanied by by those who are in white
[1:24:21] robes and people God we come back after
[1:24:25] the world has been burnt over how many
[1:24:28] y'all believe the world is gonna be
[1:24:29] burnt over it's true they didn't believe
[1:24:33] the flood was coming but it did you know
[1:24:36] what I guess think about how Pharaoh
[1:24:39] when he first saw Moses he like laughed
[1:24:41] at it yo God said well let my people go
[1:24:45] are you serious
[1:24:46] you future till you know and you coming
[1:24:50] back and talk to them me Pharaoh
[1:24:52] I'm Pharaoh yeah but I'm telling you I
[1:24:55] got a message from God and he said let
[1:24:58] my people go see you see how ridiculous
[1:25:01] that looked he didn't come with some
[1:25:03] great army he was with his donkey and
[1:25:06] his wife and his son Hershey and they
[1:25:10] come and he mocks up there this is I
[1:25:15] [Music]
[1:25:17] love it because it looks ridiculous to
[1:25:21] the intellectual mind and God simply
[1:25:24] just humbles himself and he looked to
[1:25:27] the intellect it looks foolish you know
[1:25:31] but that's how faith works faith works
[1:25:35] not with reasoning if it was reasoning
[1:25:38] it wouldn't be faith all right it is
[1:25:42] somehow you believe it even though you
[1:25:45] can't explain it because you know God
[1:25:48] said so and it's going to happen in
[1:25:51] closing we can stand let me ask you a
[1:25:54] question
[1:26:04] when it comes to the resurrection I'm
[1:26:11] excited
[1:26:16] most of my children that I had on there
[1:26:19] God gave me the names of all of my
[1:26:21] children before they were born back
[1:26:24] there we didn't even have or use which
[1:26:27] was I would say they can have but we
[1:26:29] didn't know whether it would be boy or
[1:26:31] girl other than what God said I didn't
[1:26:36] ever miss them all every name we had for
[1:26:41] our children match the gender we never
[1:26:45] had to change then why God did that I
[1:26:48] don't know but I know one thing he saw
[1:26:51] them he knew them before they came and
[1:26:56] just like he knew them he knew he knew
[1:26:58] us and you and I must understand that
[1:27:02] this is not some kind of chance rock and
[1:27:04] roll guys he didn't gamble that I hope
[1:27:08] these people believe but he knew that
[1:27:10] you would believe and to be a Christian
[1:27:14] in this day I mean a real Christian
[1:27:16] ain't talking about no churchgoer I'm a
[1:27:18] real Christian born-again lives has
[1:27:21] changed seeing miracles because the
[1:27:23] Bible said these signs have followed
[1:27:25] them
[1:27:28] you couldn't believe and let's go up
[1:27:30] with the faith you could not have come
[1:27:34] to God because to be real most of us
[1:27:37] when we were out there in pleasure it
[1:27:39] was pleasure we enjoyed it until God
[1:27:43] starts shaking up our system and when he
[1:27:48] began to shake your world then you began
[1:27:51] to wonder where is his God and if he's
[1:27:53] really that was all God and you and I
[1:27:58] must understand Amen God is calling and
[1:28:00] God is desiring let's not fail and I
[1:28:07] know if you're a bride and you're not
[1:28:10] straight with God then you holding up my
[1:28:12] truth don't hold up a true
[1:28:20] because you know we can't make it
[1:28:21] without it we can't now God is not gonna
[1:28:24] leave one is that right Moses says when
[1:28:27] Pharaoh says leave something floating
[1:28:28] said I'm not gonna leave one I'm taking
[1:28:31] everything everything that God said I
[1:28:33] had I'm not only taking that which is
[1:28:35] mine I'm taking some of yours too so you
[1:28:39] and I must understand that we're going
[1:28:42] up brother
[1:28:43] can you imagine yeah we tell me we have
[1:28:46] good services but they gonna crown him
[1:28:48] king of games they go crown him Lord of
[1:28:51] lords and if you love God you know you
[1:28:56] want to make sure you go to that
[1:28:57] coronation you want to be there I think
[1:29:03] about that sometimes and all I could do
[1:29:05] is see rockets going through not
[1:29:08] man-made rockets people we're so happy
[1:29:14] with social stuff we just show you
[1:29:17] there's no other way what else we gonna
[1:29:20] do oh I can't miss him he deserved every
[1:29:25] bit the honor the praise everything that
[1:29:30] we've grown has been and I tell you what
[1:29:35] if I had not gonna try out
[1:29:37] life like in this life like I have I
[1:29:40] would love him I appreciate it so much
[1:29:44] every day I do you love the Lord let's
[1:29:49] just pray father God be thinking right
[1:29:52] now for the grazing we thank you for
[1:29:55] this time
[1:29:56] fellowship ground the word father I
[1:29:58] don't know but you know whose hearts
[1:30:01] have been touched

[1:30:09] preach it
[1:30:11] try to you
[1:30:13] will bless the heart of the heat Lord no
[1:30:17] let us do I hear Lord just thinking it
[1:30:20] was a good service but I prayed that the
[1:30:22] word active quickened that spirit
[1:30:27] quickened machines and the word more
[1:30:29] than me may blossom into the very image
[1:30:32] of your son Jesus Christ
[1:30:35] Lord it may seem like it's so
[1:30:37] far-fetched like you can't
[1:30:40] but every time I look at a tree often
[1:30:45] [Music]
[1:30:49] it's all about you we thank you Father
[1:30:53] God how you do things you gather the
[1:30:56] little drops of rain put them all
[1:30:59] together

[1:31:05] please help us now change the speed
[1:31:09] unite ourselves together not just
[1:31:11] physically but spiritual not help us to
[1:31:15] increase our prayer lines help us to
[1:31:19] increase our studying that you might
[1:31:22] live to us help us now give us
[1:31:27] understanding of our identity what we
[1:31:30] come to
[1:31:32] I'm a rush through things Lord wasn't so
[1:31:35] much I I pray father
[1:31:38] help us now blessed is an obligation a
[1:31:42] special way Jesus Christ amen
[1:31:49] [Music]
[1:32:20] it's live
[1:32:25] [Music]
[1:33:06] that's right
[1:33:09] [Music]
[1:33:16] [Applause]
[1:33:18] I'll sing
[1:33:20] [Music]
[1:34:08] with the world
[1:34:15] it's like when Jesus was looking looking
[1:34:19] with John the Baptist Elijah
[1:34:23] had already gone I mean
[1:34:28] a lot of people think
[1:34:31] the world
[1:34:33] it's great or they will but what people
[1:34:38] don't understand is is that that that
[1:34:41] final rate will only manifest who it
[1:34:46] what you want
[1:34:48] the week will be week there will be
[1:34:53] nature of the individuals that's why
[1:34:59] we're crying out
[1:35:02] perhaps if there be a to sing of God
[1:35:05] that that seed will be quickly bringing
[1:35:07] Christ
[1:35:08] [Music]
[1:35:10] because rain doesn't change the sea it
[1:35:14] only makes what we are expecting and
[1:35:18] it's true we're expecting a fresh of
[1:35:21] knowing won't be no great revival like
[1:35:25] Nora Roberts and I'm kilogram Tommy
[1:35:28] Hicks and all those great evangelists a
[1:35:30] god it's gonna be big to the Gentile
[1:35:35] store if you look at the Gentile stories
[1:35:39] always work and you and I must
[1:35:46] understand this is an individual thing
[1:35:48] you think oh god gonna see when God
[1:35:51] comes and that's what people understand
[1:35:52] he could be so sick gonna pass right
[1:35:55] through but the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:35:59] she's awakening I know people say what
[1:36:03] she's always
[1:36:05] that's every man's opinion but limit
[1:36:08] when I say awaken I mean to fortune is
[1:36:11] she heard the cry she came out of
[1:36:14] organization came out of denomination
[1:36:17] but folk that's not good you got to go
[1:36:20] into into Christ that's the only way you
[1:36:23] gonna make a blood of Jesus Christ must
[1:36:25] be applied and you got to be seen not
[1:36:29] some habit mixed with denomination and
[1:36:32] word it's got to be all you love the
[1:36:39] Lord
[1:36:40] I trust somehow the Word of God reached
[1:36:45] it's really a serious time I can't tell
[1:36:50] you how stupid he is but God talked to
[1:36:51] him
[1:36:53] I talk to him
[1:36:56] and I know by God's grace that I'm
[1:36:59] pressing
[1:37:01] God is delivering all my bad habits
[1:37:04] that's why
[1:37:06] [Music]
[1:37:08] ow
[1:37:13] in my breakfast I've been testifying of
[1:37:17] it not in hope it is crazy
[1:37:22] all of us has to be pleased rod revival
[1:37:25] is getting all the traction
[1:37:29] that's what God is doing now he's trying
[1:37:31] to get all the trace because he can't
[1:37:32] deal with you fully until attractions
[1:37:37] out of you're not standing you're not
[1:37:40] born again not saying there's not life
[1:37:41] and you know life is in you in order to
[1:37:43] go to maturity push back to life all the
[1:37:47] trash you love the Lord you love the
[1:37:52] Lord

[1:37:57] list

[1:38:25] [Music]
[1:38:39] [Music]
[1:38:50] [Music]

[1:39:02] bought the Holy Ghost of our city be
[1:39:05] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you
[1:39:10] shall receive
[1:39:13] that is the it's the only original
[1:39:18] Baptist
[1:39:21] while I was baptized father
[1:39:25] well those are just titles go back and I
[1:39:28] know you feel it says in the name of
[1:39:31] nanp that names name of the Father and
