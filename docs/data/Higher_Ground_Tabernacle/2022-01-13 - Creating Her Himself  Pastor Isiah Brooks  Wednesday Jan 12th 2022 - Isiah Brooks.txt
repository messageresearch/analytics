all measureless and strong redeeming grace [Music] [Music] yes sir [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen amen glad to be in the house of god again i was in such a rush i rushed out without my jacket i feel a little strange but i think i get through it god is so good to us and we appreciate uh all of your prayers while we were away we had a wonderful time there in arizona and the weather wasn't so bad either wasn't as hot as i thought it would be but it wasn't as cold as it was here so we thank god for what he is doing and what he has done um that's just saying what a mighty god we serve amen [Music] oh what a mighty god hallelujah [Music] oh oh i will [Applause] [Music] hallelujah the sacrifice [Music] is is [Music] is amen as we stand let us get right on into the word of the lord and we ask that you turn with us to isaiah 56 the lord is a faithful god and i'm glad for his faithfulness um i'm glad i that i have nothing to do with his new creation i was thinking and i spoke this message when i was out in arizona just a second part of excuse me what i preached here last dealing with the gold frankincen and myrrh and i was thinking to myself if when it comes to our wives if we had to design them you know uh back in the day i wonder what they would have looked like or what kind of character they would have because even after you get married you find yourself trying to mold your partner into what you want her to be and vice versa so even when you get married you're not uh joined together in such that you are both equally satisfied maybe at the beginning you're thinking that but as you stay with each other for a while you'll find out that you know she's looking at you where there's you know with with eyes of improvement and and we look at them with the eyes of improvement so i just thank god that this new creation that god is doing i we have nothing to do with it because perhaps some of the things that we would maybe think would be uh good would not be good but being that god is perfect he knows how to create a perfect vessel for himself and i love that i love that uh i was talking with a young man today and we were talking about why god had to have a contrast i said well if something is perfect you can't go beyond perfection in order to what show what perfect is because there is no such thing as more perfect so in order to show god you had to condense in into a place of contrast something that is opposite uh of what he is in order to for us to see the glory amen and i just told him i said you know all of the sufferings and things we go through now uh it's all because of the place that we're going to you would not even enjoy heaven without the suffering here and this is why paul said that the suffering of this world can't be compared to that place in which god has prepared for us and but we understand that because we suffer and because we go through the things that we're going through it's just preparing us and it's putting our our joy in in such a place where the joy would be will be eternal it'll never die it'll never condensate it'll never go down and then up it will always be there and i'm thinking the longer we there the better it's going to be so let us turn let us read here isaiah 56 and 8 and who wouldn't want to go to heaven the lord god with gathereth at the outcast of israel said yet will i gather others to him besides those i am in the right place am i no i'm not i said isaiah i meant psalms 56 forgive me psalms did i say that right i don't know but that's what i want psalms 56 excuse me psalms 56 i did that before 8-13 thou telleth my wonderings put thou my tears into the bottle are they not in thy book when i cry unto thee then shall my enemies turn back this i know for god is for me and god will i pray his word praise his word and in the lord will i praise his word and god have i put my trust i will not be afraid of what man can do unto me thy vows are upon me oh god i will render praises unto thee for thou has delivered my soul from death will thou not deliver my feet from falling that i may walk before thee in the light of the living isaiah now 25 isaiah 25. isaiah 25. you love the lord 25 8-13 he will swallow up death in victory and the lord god will wipe away tears from off all faces and the rebuke of his people shall be taken away from off the earth for the lord hath spoken it amen and it shall be said in that day lord this is our god we have waited for him and he will save us this is the lord we have waited for him and he will be glad and rejoice in his salvation for in this mountain shall the lord the hand of the lord rest and moab shall be trodden down under him even as straw is trotted down for the dongheel amen let us pray father god we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for your goodness and we thank you for all that you have done for us father you've been so good to us and lord i just want to thank you for your amazing grace we pray lord god tonight that your perfect will be done and we'll be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated when we think and sometimes it's very hard to comprehend what god is doing because we don't know what perfection is we know god is perfect but our minds is still limited to understanding what that is we all strive for perfection we want to see uh perfection in us but even in our best effort in the flesh perfection cannot be achieved it's only in the spirit part of you perfection can be achieved because remember this flesh is imperfected it's imperfection it's imperfection if i could say it in in in in its uh in its glory if there's such thing as imperfection being glory it's the height of what imperfection has produced what sin has produced is what we are we are the manifestation in our natural selves we are the manifestation of what disobeying the word can do it is a manifestation of failure and falling and you know pain and agony and all of these things that that that came by way of the fall we understand that god was going to do a great thing you know we've seen the greatness of god um basically in in uh uh throughout the history of of mankind we saw what moses did we saw what joshua did we've seen those things because they're written in the book and we believe it we've become a part of that and it's become a part of us and we see those things and we still see uh such heroism uh in these great leaders and sometimes within our minds we think that these people did this uh of their own but let me tell you the truth of the matter none of them could have achieved anything without the grace of god everything has been achieved by mankind uh toward god is uh by by god giving us grace and that's what david was talking about lord how can i offer anything to you everything i ever have everything you've ever given me everything that i got everything everything if i offered it to you it's only because you gave it to me otherwise i would be empty i would have nothing and you know but yet god looks at those things in the way that we offer them as if they're ours to offer and really they are because he's given them to us to offer but the greatest thing that you and i can give god or offer unto god is a living sacrifice i think holy and acceptable and you know praises are good shouting is good dancing is good being faithful to church is good but all of those things should be only fruits of holiness it's god in you producing these things not not works only because we understand what working salvation will get you most of the time when you're working salvation you're like cain trying to produce a religion to that so much so that god will be accepted will accept you and and none of us have been able to do that the bible says even our righteousness is as filthy rags when you come into the real revelation of as i spoke the last time when you fully come into the real revelation of what grace is it really takes away the condemnation don't get me wrong every person every man every woman who's born of god and when we come to a place in our faults makes us air away from the word of god we automatically repent we automatically say father forgive me we automatically say lord this is uh forgive me i didn't mean you know we make sure amen our father know that these things that we have just done was not intentional amen now uh the thing that gets me and and i fully understand i think god really helped me uh in a quote that i actually uh found today and it has read it before but it just seemed like god turned the light on um because if if we're going to be like the pentecostals or like the the methodist or like the ones prior to pentecost then basically we've not gone anyway where uh because god has something new and i know this sounds strange but it's beyond all of that and you know because we got to understand that what god is doing is not making a patched up life if god wanted to do something patched up when it came to mary he would have allowed joseph or he himself would have done something to make mary part of the creation of god and really mary was not she literally was just an incubator it was god amen who prepared himself a body it was god who created the blood it was god who uh uh fashioned himself into the womb of mary and mary was just a carrier of the word right otherwise amen we jesus uh the second adam would have been faulty but he had a new body he was a new creation he was different from the first adam and so much that the first adam was earthly but the second adam was the quickening spirit and the bible said it was the lord himself amen it was god who created all of that and so in reading and understanding that we must understand that there is something there's a new order of the bride it's a new order of the church it's it's not the same we can't allow ourselves to be entrapped amen with the old order expecting god to rapture us it's got to we must come into that place where we are as the scripture says a new creation not a patched up not something amen that's some parts of some old and some new no it must be as it says a new creation we can't comprehend it i'm telling you i cannot but i believe it amen and i believe that when the message came when when god in in 1963 opened up the book to us it made us see that we were no longer in that lay under that layer to see in spirit because the laodicean spirit put jesus outside the door she didn't want headship she didn't want the change oh i'll see in the rapture they're saying that but you can't see a god in the rapture until god has created you into something new amen hallelujah those old pentecostals who had what they had amen they'll be there because that was the light of their day but for those of those are pentecostals who did not want to go forward whether it be pentecost together be methodists whether it be whatever amen because they fail to move forward amen they will remain amen amen it doesn't mean they're lost but they will be will remain because they fail to walk in the light as he is in the light that's what the bible says walk in the light has he is in the light is that right hallelujah and we'll have fellowship with one another and the blood of jesus christ will cleanse us from what all unrighteousness see so you've got to walk as god walks you got to move as god moves you got to understand as god understand and you know and i know that once you start on a dark path in the with the light that light in front of you is revealing to you different areas different steps all the way until you get where you need to go [Music] and that's what the message have come to do lead us in our walk to open up our eyes to the steps that we're supposed to take amen coming from a quote there and i'm gonna read that and then i'm gonna come back to the word of god uh uh in in scriptures dealing with the gold and the frankincense because it's very important that we understand that this is the material in which god was really made out of he used it in symbolism but he used it so that you can see and have an idea of the kind of character and the kind of fragrance and the kind of suffering and the kind of things that you must go through in order to prove that your bride this is testing time you did not come here amen for a picnic you came to suffer you came to prove to satan that you're different from the eve yes you understand me so you and i we understand that there is a bride that has been ordained not to fall amen amen thank you lord and you and i must understand what that means what does that mean we have been ordained because you and i know that by the grace of god the squeeze the pressure and understand this everything must come in his season it will not come before it it will come exactly as god described it would come in other words you cannot plant seeds in the harvest time you understand me if with the sun don't be the same sun it is so hot it will kill everything amen so you have to plant it in a different season and you got to reap it in a different season and this is harvest time hallelujah wearing that seed must come into a matured place and that that seed understand in order for to ripen it must be in a position where the sun will ripen it is that the truth because i tell you the sun itself doesn't change the seed as you heard me say the sun only reveals what's in the seed as the word of god doesn't change your seed it only reveals what's in you and as that sun began to bake all the greenery and things out of you amen then you'll began to see the beautiful golden and you know what i know as hot in harvest time the wheat always bow itself it's only the tares that will stand straight but in the harvest time the wheat in itself will bow and that's how it is you find the picture well i'm the right you don't even know what prayer is you don't know how to bow to god you don't know how to humble yourself to god amen in harvest time the wheat knows how to humble themselves but now in this later church age he says but now he's standing in the midst of the church as he stands there revealing who he is in this last day he calls himself the author of creation of god this is another creation hear what i'm saying this is another creation because when we think about the author of the creation of god we're thinking about everything but no there's another creation that's going on now this has to do with the church this is a special designation in other words a special design of himself amen you understand me hallelujah he is the creator of the church the broad the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride y'all understand me amen so you got to have the holy ghost in you the creator in order for him to create in you that's what paul says grow up into him it's the creator inside creating himself in you and as the spirit of god he came down and created in the virgin mary the cell from which his body was born i want to repeat that he created the very cell in the womb of mary for that body it was not enough for the holy spirit to simply give life amen to a human ovarian supplied by mary that would have been sinful mankind producing a body that would not have produced the last adam amen of himself it was said lo a body has thou father prepared for me god not mary god the father prepared the body provided that body mary was the human incubator and she carried that holy child and brought him to birth it was god man amen he was the son of god he was the new creation amen man and god met and joined he was the first of a new race so what are you saying it's good you have a fight between the black dog and the white dog or the bad nature and the good nature but the bad nature must be starved to death it's got to die when the christ come only the good nature must reign he's not going to choose or uh um no the the good dog or the good nature must kill out the old nature as we grow y'all better hear what i'm saying as we grow we have a battle between the two but there comes a day that the good nature must conquer why because the good nature is your true nature it is the nature that you were supposed to be born with before the fall it was a fall that brought the bad nature amen so everything you say what brother how could that be well let me say it like this brother branham said it like he said in the future home when that holy ghost and fire comes that holy ghost and fire burns this world up kills all the demons off of it you understand me and he said just like the earth must receive her fire baptism he said every believer must receive their fire baptism so we've got a baptism to receive amen we've got a fire to get from god that's going to kill that old dog amen that belongs to the devil oh come on somebody it's a new creation it's not a patched up job and we've got a place to go we've got a destiny to make hallelujah that's the difference that's why the seals that's why he said the holy ghost yesterday it won't work for today because that was just the beginning of something but they failed to answer the knock at the door y'all understand me and he said if you answer my knock i'll come into you and sup with you hallelujah i fellowship with you i will explain to you what i'm doing in you i'll lead you step by step see that's what it's about we can't just stop well i've been born again yes no i heard somebody what do you say about brother brooks you're preaching a progressive ah salvation well that's the way it always been from egypt to the wilderness from the wilderness to the canaan from the catalan to the mountaintop progressively they had to move to achieve what god ordained them to achieve and only a few caught the revelation because they had a a different spirit we can't stop here we can't say oh when the squeeze come we go listen when the squeeze comes you're supposed to be prepared you understand me god can't cannot lie if it's a new creation it's a new creation and you and i are battling with this damnable nature that we think that we've got to deal with until jesus come yes we'll deal with it but we'll keep it under our feet it's got to die the effects of that devil must die and you say well how how can you prove it because the victory of the of the of the true uh true qualities of god will cause your body to change from mortal immortality you give no space for the devil in this flesh don't do that don't tell me it's not possible because with god all things are possible to them that believe amen and we've got to believe this what makes this message different from all the others if it's not going to bring about a different change we've had the shout we have to speak in tongues we have prophecies we've had all those things and all those things were good and of god but let me say it like this rebecca received all those gifts from isaac but she wasn't satisfied until she and ozzy became one hallelujah and she changed from bride to wife hallelujah you love the lord see it was a god man he was a son of god he was a son he was of the new creation man and god met and joined he was the first of a new race he is the head of this new race colossians 1 18 and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the first born first born from the dead that in all things he might have what preeminence in the church not in the building in you preeminence that gives the black dog no rule the bad nature if i could say it like that evil must stop here y'all understand what i'm saying and the holy ghost in you is to conquer that evil that's in you amen amen i don't know about you but i want all of it i don't want to apostle christ give me everything i am to receive from him i'm not afraid to die i want to die that christ may live in me what is this what is this life what is it isaiah brooks that's nothing you understand me what is isaiah brooks i mean he was born here and will die there what is that but jesus christ is the almighty god and those that are born of him is he born is born of eternal life that's the substance my heart desire to to allow to occupy amen dwell i need him to dwell you need him to dwell hallelujah tell me at what place did jesus ever let satan whip him not even at calvary the devil really thought he was victorious but he just played in god's hands and even as he places us under a lot of suffering he realized i think that's it the bible said darkness comprehended it's not satan can't have a revelation of what god is doing he is so blind he plays into god's hands when he thinks he's afflicting us and making us worse and think he's can you can't ball god out of us you can't burn god out of us you can't hang god out of us you can't do nothing once god is in there he's in there and no matter what the devil does he can't get rid of him yeah i understand he seemed like he would understand listen he thought oh i'm killing all these christians in the in the early days you know what i mean he thought burning him the stakes and you know letting our lions he had no idea he was planting a crop he didn't know the seed had to go down in the ground in order for it to come up it's because of what he did that john saw a number no man could number amen hallelujah there's a harvest of the seed of christ that was just like god promised to abraham look at the stars so said your cp look at the sands of the sea on the seashore so shall your seed be but the bible said if that seed abides alone it will prosper nothing but once you bury it once you kill it and it rises again it will bring forth of its kind and let me tell you something that's what we're supposed to be that's what we are we can't allow ourselves to be religious we must be transformed we must be here and every day we need to pray for transformation god changed me oh god we can't change ourselves but by your grace you can change us we know it's not by words but we know your grace can change us change me oh god hallelujah amen goes on and says and he was the head of the body of the church who is the beginning of the first born from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence second corinthians 5 17 therefore if any man be in christ he is a what new creation all old things have passed away y'all understand that amen pass away gone amen amen but why do we yet struggle with old things oh things supposed to be gone this is a new creation he's talking about oh come on people you got to see what i'm talking about if we don't see this we can't go any further we got to go beyond these walls and be beyond what we call message that's not as long as it's standing still it is not message it must progress into him it must transform into him it has to amen amen the very character of the very life of christ must be in individuals and i'm going to tell you something everybody won't get what i'm talking about my but i know what i'm seeing i know what it is amen and i know that we must press like paul says i pressed toward the mouth of a high calling which in christ jesus let everybody else false let everybody else contend with each other but you stay with jesus keep your eyes on christ keep your eyes on the shepherd let him lead you let him guide you because when it's all said and done every man must give an account for himself it's hard but it's good this is what you call good pain yes so colossians 1 18 and he is the head of the body of church of the church the church who is the beginning of the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence second corinthians 5 17 therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creation all things have passed away behold all things have become new there you can see that though man was of the old order this is the prophet or creation now in union with christ he has become the new creation of god amen listen ephesians 4 24 says and that ye put all that you put on the new man without the god is created in righteousness and true holiness the new creation is not all creation made over it is cut it or it could not be called a new creation this is exactly what it says it is new creation it is another creation distinct from the old one amen y'all understand me the new creation in other words look nothing like the old man i read to you tonight amen there in in psalms and in isaiah how god talks about tears and tears is very important and more important than i ever knew they were before how many all can just cry when you want to i doubt it i know actors can do it because they've learned how to you know swing their emotions in certain ways for it to happen but the tears that god is bringing us through are important the bible said he hates a proud spirit a proud spirit but a broken and contrite spirit the bible says god loves right so we showed you and this is one of the things i don't have my pictures with me i left them there and uh and i forgot to copy and make other copies but one of the things that caught my attention i looked right at it of course i talked to you about the frankincense tree there's a frankenstein street there's a murder tree and then of course you've got gold and i showed you that in that day gold was the least expensive it was frankincense myrrh and then gold nowaday gold is very important it's very expensive and and i understand why the switch is because it's deity and this is the age of deity so deity is far more expensive more expensive than gold and myrrh because gold and myrrh i mean excuse me myrrh and frankincense amen were types of christ and so was uh the the gold but when it came to frankincense frankincense and myrrh they both um the south uh east of africa uh uh uh uh ethiopia and places like that but mur uh frankincense is found in if i got it correctly in in in one place and that's uh uh uh arabia and and it grows in such hot in the harsh condition very dry and very desert-like condition but in reading they said uh frankincense tree the tree itself has the ability to grow out of a rock now put your spiritual ears on and in order to extract frankincense from uh the tree you have to cut it you know like whip it slice it and these uh licks or slices you know uh they call them wounds and out of the wounds the sap comes out which is frankincense and when it comes out it looked like golden tears see one thing about jesus the bible said with his stripes we will be healed and see those those those uh that that frankincense when it comes out like a liquid what it does it it's it it pretty much solidifies it crystallizes and when it crystallizes it literally heals the wound it doesn't get rid of the wound because once you chip it off the womb is still there i mean those scars excuse me it's still there though the womb has been healed but the scar it leaves a scar and it shows that that's the way christ is with his stripes we're healed and he's been wounded and brother branham says when we see him we'll recognize the nail-scarred hands though the scars the wounds have been healed the scars will remain and so was it with the military it's it's it's related to the frankincense tree it grows in harsh conditions but in order to get the sap from the mercury you can't just slice it you got to dig deep you got to cause a real wound you got to go beyond the bark of the tree in order oh god have mercy and so that's how it was when they pierced jesus they went beyond in order to get the life of the tree outside of him and it brought forth what life in his death amen and the word myrrh means death and you know what i know it was one of those herbs that used to help embalm it was it was a take away myrrh was the scent or the perfume to take away the smell of death oh come on somebody that's the holy ghost that sweet smell that takes away the sin of death amen and one of the things that all three of these elements are have in common is that in order for them to produce they must be wounded or beaten gold is something that i said to you and i'm saying this now because you got to understand when you go through trials you must understand what god is trying to get out of you sometimes you know with gold you find gold on the river streams or whatever but to find the mother lode you got to dig deep and then when you find the mother lode you you find this goal and the golden itself is okay it's wonderful we're shouting we'll carry on but it's not done yet it has to be processed and this gold must be beaten you understand me bride of jesus christ what did he say hear this voice answer my call in revelations 3 you'll be gold tried in the fire in other words you cannot be bribed without being beaten amen god must beat and beat and beat but you must understand the gold in itself yields to the master's hand it'll never fight back it'll yield because in itself it knows that what god is doing he's beating all out of the draw all out of the darkness all all the sin out of us that we might reflect him amen this is our day don't get discouraged because the worst is not here yet it's during the squeeze you're going to be beaten in such a way you never thought it would be but you come to prove that you're not like the eve amen and that you're not part of satan's edom because no matter what you go through you realize that you're going through the refiner's fire amen and when you come out you're going to be like pure gold [Music] it's in you but you don't know it's in you that's why the prophet god said the bride will be at her breast best when she's under pressure and the worst thing for us now amen he said the greatest of all enemies is easy living god is going to change that why because you just said i can't do it you can do it the first if she fell excuse me because god had taken her out god had taken her out before the tests but while jesus was going through the beating you were there when they mocked him when they scold him when they spat in his face what was it that was gold deity in service to die for you and i but you were there with him male and female and we didn't know it until like the murder when it was time for when he had already died they pierced him in the side and when they pierced him at his side in his side who comes out with the blood of jesus christ and the bride showing that even in his death he was able to produce life hallelujah and what do we have what do we do to deserve it no we're just like the thief on the cross he did nothing to observe it he was elected he was elected and chosen amen to receive eternal life he didn't have to do nothing and that's the way grace started and that's the way grace ends hallelujah we're so legalistic we just don't can't even enjoy our salvation because we're worried about how god gonna handle it don't you worry god has already handled it think about it putting your name in the labs book of life before the foundation of the world and do you think that you can do something now to take it out nothing god doesn't make bad choices hallelujah am i making sense you say well brother brooks what are you what are you what are you saying and i'm trying to prepare us because understand these trials and tests that we can't going through we must overcome amen overcome the lust of the flesh the lust of the pride of life and you know lust of the eye but oh brother hooks how am i going to do it by grace ask for his grace stop trying to do it ask for the grace of god to take you through it you understand me let me ask you a question samson picked we preached oh samson picked up those gates of gaza and he carried them off do you think that man that was man's strength that was god's anointing that was the grace of god that caused him to defeat those philistines then and even at the end amen y'all understand me and what is it that we fail to do we fail to call on god when trials come and tests come often time we wait till it gets real bad and we say jesus but the bible says acknowledge the lord in all of your ways and he shall direct your path but we're the one it's not god we fail him like i was discussing this with the brother the other day i said do you don't you realize bathsheba was supposed to be david's anyway he had 500 and god was going to give him another one you say oh what no he got in the way and god then worked it toward his own purpose see if he had only waited on god god would allow uriah to be killed when he was in in service for god but he got in the way took the man's wife now you've got god working on your health to bring that to pastor because let me tell you something solomon could only come through bathsheba amen but what about jacob and esau huh god had already told a rachel what jacob was going to and he's uh he saw and jacob was going to be the ruler she got in the way and then jacob had to have to serve his uncle for seven years 14 years and only if he had only they had waited for god says lord it's time to for the blessing and you need to talk to your servant he would have done it but you see what happened when you get in the way it only causes your suffering to last longer god will bring you to that purpose he's going to fulfill his purpose in you but don't get in his way let go and let god do it all you see what i'm saying it's god god has a purpose god has a plan but we sometimes try to jump jump the gun like we can't wait on guard that's the same thing saul did i can't wait on samuel as soon as he jumped in front and he got in trouble caused him his life on earth y'all understand me calls him his position because we have to wait on god listen you can't manipulate god you can't bargain with god you can't flatter god you can't do nothing god is sovereign and in his own time he'll make all things beautiful i feel like shouting john tonight but i'm a whole now i'm a hold on you yet holding on yes i'm yet holding on amen let's hear romans 8 17 please i hope you're being blessed tonight people of god this is not something i can't you remember i don't know how you prayed for the holy ghost and god gave it to you but there was such an urgency and there was such a desperation that you kept praying until god gave it to you and you didn't know at what point in time he was going to do it but he came through anyhow you don't stop there and just like you pray for that you need to continue to pray for the virtues of god to be created and made in you baptism is a baptism at the baptism not the baptism you don't stop till you come to that completion the true manifestations of sons and daughters of god we look at brother brandon we say well where he was well what about you a lot of people well you know the prophet raised people from the dead what about those brothers down there in jeffersonville who prayed for that woman and god raised her from the dead that gift wasn't just given to the prophet it was given to the believers look throughout the church ages when there was no no prophet on the scene they still prayed and people was raised from the dead amen that was the life of christ i'm saying he's the same yesterday today and forever and there is something that's not being right right now that we make to need to make right we need to repent from our unbelief i'm so tired of this religion that we got called the message because that's just what we've made it brother you better be careful you're going to be no i don't have to be careful because it's true and every message produced twins there is a real one and there is a fake one and guess what fake always outgrow more are the bonds woman children than the they are the free and because your church i tell you why oh my i just can't hardly stand it sometime when i'm at the house and i get to a place i'm like god i don't even know what to do right now i know what i'm looking at and i know where i need to be and how to get there i only know that only your grace will take care of me but because i thirst for it it encourages me because he said if you thirst for righteousness you shall be filled and that's what i bring back to god lord you said if i thirst for your righteousness you will feel me romans 8 17 let's go to the 16th verse for the spirit itself bear witness with our spirit that we are the children of god not the letter the spirit bears witness if children then heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we what suffer with him that we may also be glorified together so suffering is part of christianity for him now i'm not talking about suffering because of you done said the wrong thing and then did the wrong thing evil stuff that's not not that's not even part of the kingdom it's talking about suffering for the name of jesus christ how people hate you because you're a christian set traps for you because you're a christian that's what suffering for jesus christ is about and jesus said when you suffer for my name's sake you blessed amen god is real i'm not gonna keep you alone but i just had to drop throw this in at you because i want you to understand the process in which we're going through that's why god those three wise men ham shem and jethro brought those three gifts to jesus it was there in a mystery even as a child but those same herbs those same things that they brought was present there to bury him and it was what deity now on display philippians 1 29. like i said i won't keep it too much longer god is good to us and and understand people you can't i can't none of us can do it but he can he said if you have faith to believe you've got to have faith to believe it you don't have to see it faith is not what you see god will bring it to sight once it comes to pass but faith is going to believe that which is impossible and called those things that be not as though they were that's what you do yes sir stop looking at this oh nasty flesh and flesh of yours it's going to fail you you're on a journey and you must understand the journey is going to be tough god don't lead you into these smooth places god leads you the harder way amen 40 years in the wilderness when he could have been there in seven days or so he takes all believers the harder way you really trust god think about it james said that this life is nothing but a vapor it doesn't take long for you to grow old you think god just thank god you don't have a bug's life you know me but god at least given us life where we can just see and enjoy and in these things but understand the suffering comes with it and it's wonderful when you realize that no matter what i go through he's always there he said i'll never leave you nor will i forsake i believe that i get blessings from god i don't even know why and how and yet he'll bring it through anyhow you see talks to me and i'm like you know yeah you don't have to say well should i pray sometimes god talks to you and says time to pray or come over here and pray yes he'll anoint you to pray and if you've got a praying place where you pray he'll be there before you get there you won't even have to struggle to enter in he's already there oh jesus help me lord i'm almost done philippians 1 29. for unto you it is given in the behalf of christ not only to believe on him but also to suffer for his sake having the same conflict which you saw in me and now here to be in me now think about it paul says listen don't you even think you're going to get away from being from suffering because paul says listen god raised me up to suffer that's what he did he spoke i'm gonna show paul what do you need to how he's gonna suffer for my name's sake did paul suffer absolutely way beyond anything we have encountered thus far and he suffered he says now you need to arm on yourself see let me tell you something as long as we compromise as long as we don't stand for jesus we're going to have a smooth ride but stand stand for righteousness and holiness and you'll see the devil really rise up and you and i need to know when life is too good for us something's going wrong when there is no conflict ain't nobody getting in your face about jesus something's not right because you and i are supposed to be here to shine of light he said now ye are the light of the world and it's somebody in this day people in this they need to see real christians folks people who are not ashamed of him people who don't mind declaring him amen one more scripture and i'll let you go first peter this is a beautiful situation and i i'm not satisfied this is why i'm preaching this i'm not satisfied with what i am right now you understand me the manifestations that i see coming out of me it's i'm not satisfied i am not to be a tree of good and evil god said make the tree good or make it evil somewhere the tree of evil must die it must rot he said either make the tree good or make it evil that's jesus and we got to work at it you say work in prayer you labor in prayer that's where your labor comes in and that's why satan is basically trying to steal it away from you completely then god will give you grace every now and again just get down and break through for a little while but that's not the way it's supposed to be the bible says pray without season and i don't care whether you feel it or not you're supposed to stay in prayer first peter 4 16 yet if any man suffer as a christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify god on this behalf you know what i'm saying it's like when peter james and john were thrown into prison they didn't go like oh what was b what's going on they praised god because god found them worthy to suffer for his name's sake when somebody called you a holy roller or like a brother say they say you two straight say praise the lord for too straight because that's the way god wants us he rather is too straight than the crook to be cricket god don't want either he wants black or white he doesn't want the gray areas that's a plus that's a compliment the straight and narrow way and the bible said only a few be that find it for the time has come that judgment what must begin at the house of god and if it first begin at us what shall the end of the theme that obey not the gospel of god and if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear huh so you got to understand this is the house of god if a preacher is preaching to you and you don't he don't come and stop beating that goal we don't like it but the bible instruct us to in beat the gold we have to bring the hammer sometimes and it's all good does it feel good no but it will get all that nonsense out of us the lord is soon to come folks it really he he you know we about and you know i think a lot of people think we're going to see a great number ain't going to be no great number you just make sure you're one of them you can't have what other christians are doing that's none of your business do what you're supposed to do be faithful to the lord you love the lord amen this is where the judgment is and as i said these beautiful things that god allow us to see in the scripture is for our own good that we might see that jesus said if you're going to follow me take up your cross meaning there's a crucifixion for you as well huh brother madam says in letting off the pressure he said this body that we're going to exchange it for the blood don't pulsate it the holy spirit does and it can't it can die it it's it can't die it's immortal eternal and it can't die what a promise in other words we won't have to worry about that red stuff one of these old days because the holy spirit himself would be your blood he is the one that will continue to pump whatever needs to be pumped and i don't know how it all worked but he said flesh and blood will not enter and so you and i must understand that's why even there there's no blood there the people up there ain't living off blood they're living off of him huh you say what do you mean brother let me tell you something even the sun when it's all over won't have no use he said there would be no sun right he's not in the city the land the light of the lamb will be the light of the city and the sun in itself amen was there to do what manifest of to uh express the death resurrection of jesus christ and now we've come to that complete place in christ the real light the light before the sun was ever created will shine through glory [Laughter] did y'all know that there was a light before the sun and that light was god and that light itself would shine throughout eternity i can hardly wait and i don't care really what i might suffer to get there as long as he's with me i'm okay whatever it may be people and that must be your attitude and when things seem to go in places and directions that you don't understand it's okay to pray lord show me the way because sometimes god wants it to be that way well you say well wait a minute wait a minute brother wait a minute let me say it like this which uh brother and i was thinking about it and talking about it i said you know jonah thought he was going to run and god had already prepared the well he thought he was doing something and all he was doing being fallen right into hands of god because here he was on the boat of idol worshipers and before it was all over they were worshiping the god of jonah amen then god jonah goes into the belly of the well this revival every revival he revives it and he goes to nineveh and brother battle said he went to nineveh to for the bride of christ that wicked city that city amen that seemed to be and that's a gentile city you understand me that wicked city with cocaine and all kinds of drugs and immorality was reigning in the midst of that mess god had his pride that old devil god used his own used the devil's instrument to to save souls because there in nineveh they worshipped the fish god and god put joan on the inside of [Music] and everybody repents hey and i know that sounds like some story out of awful hollywood program but it's reality so don't you ever unders underestimate god never underestimate god and when you ask him for anything you believe you're going to receive it no matter how long it takes no matter how long it takes he promised i got a testimony but i can't tell it right now something i prayed for some time ago and god just brought it and then the other day he said remember when you pray for this god is faithful you just got to trust him wait on him people it's worth the wait and don't you think that wasn't going to tempt you to not wait huh but let me say it like this in closing once you realize everything is by grace then you the devil can't put it in your face that because you did this and because you did that god ain't gonna bless you that is a lie god blessed you already and he ain't coming back and cursing you you understand me so so you can understand what i'm talking about if you're working with your works and you think that because you've been this and you've been dead and because oh you merited something let me ask you when the devil when you're on your deathbed and satan comes with that great list of things you've done wrong and everything that he's bringing to you is right you did it how are you going to get out of it how are you going to escape his accusations the only the only shield of faith that you have to wore him off will be grace that it was given to me he died for me he paid my price i could not have done it he did it everything i deserve everything i deserve every evil thing i deserve satan god took it off me and he put it on you you're the one you're the one i'm free and i'm welcoming heaven i'm welcoming the angels and everything else because my life is here under the blood let's stand it's always been grace men want to rule other men and they use laws to do so laws are only put in place for the transgressor but if god has set you free you're free from the law of sin and death oh god help us we're such blessed people and i think the the more we realize how blessed we are you'll find out that the joy of the lord follows all of that amen [Music] i've never seen a prisoner i've never seen a prisoner serve time and then they give him a shorter time and he walks out that gate they say one thing they tell the prisoners never look back because if you look back that's a sign you're going to return [Music] why would you look back a place that had you in prison why would you want to look back at that as soon as you look back that means you're going to return you keep your eyes straight keep going forward and never look back to where you once was keep moving forward people because as sure as you look back that means you're missing something that once was and and there's something in your heart that you got to deal with otherwise and that little something will pull you back in that's what happens but they say the person that ever goes out and look back a relative told me that they told them never looked back and they said they did not look back once they got out of there on the back and they never had to go back there keep your eyes on jesus at this time you got to understand when the pressure comes squeeze comes the only friend you might end up with is jesus himself because your relatives are going to betray you that's what you that's what the word says and and you've got to understand if they do thank you jesus you got to understand that god ordained them to do so if you don't have the right understanding of what's happening you're going to be so broken how can they do that to me you think how jesus felt when judas kissed him how did he feel as a man when he saw that his own disciples scattered like sheep but the words say they would and they did never thought about it they just fear made them react in the way they did and that's what will happen once fear drop on the nations it will take control and that's why the bible said perfect love cast out fear so let us pray tonight gracious father we come to you as homeless we know how we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy most of all we thank you for your presence when we walked in the place we could feel you here lord you know i love it when it's like that i love to feel your presence i love to know that you're with us oh god you don't have to do that but thank you father thank you for all that you've done for us and thank you for those who have sacrificed themselves to come out tonight i pray that the word that has been spoken will find good ground that it will grow and mature into that new creature put on christ put on christ that means we have a little something to do with allowing you to do it thank you jesus give us the right mind the heart to thirst for holiness and righteousness lord we appreciate you tonight let that perfect will be done in jesus christ's name we pray amen [Music] he that knoweth to do good and doeth not to him that is sin amen though we be under grace we know the good things to do shall we continue in sin that grace may abound the bible said god forbid so understand there's a balance to it all and god will bring us to that balance that don't mean i'm just going to sit down here and say god you do it no that's not the way it works praise god amen oh hallelujah what a day that will be amen oh there is [Music] no more clouds in the sky no more tears [Music] [Applause] [Music] golden shores oh what a day glorious day that will be that will be when by jesus i shall see when i look upon his feet [Music] leads me through the promised land oh what a day glorious day that will be there'll be no sorrow there no more birds to be no more sickness [Music] and forever i will be with the one who died for me oh what a day glorious day that will be oh what a day that will be when my jesus i shall see upon his face who want to save me by his reign and when he takes me by the hand and leads me through the promised land oh what a day glorious day that will be once again amen oh what a day that will be when my jesus shall oh see i look upon his face the one who saved me by his grace when he takes me leads me through the promised land oh what a day glorious day that well that's brother troy to come up amen close
