[9:30] that's all right and I believe brother
[9:32] Brooks are we doing another uh second
[9:34] offering for the brothers again so the
[9:36] first offering will just be the offering
[9:38] for the church and the ties and
[9:39] everything and the second one will be
[9:40] specifically for the visiting Brothers
[9:43] as just a token of appreciation for them
[9:45] sacrificing you know it's not about
[9:46] money but by the grace of God that's how
[9:49] sometimes we have to show affection in
[9:50] this day and age but praise the Lord

[48:19] atmosphere and the the presence of the
[48:22] Lord you create that remember you're not
[48:25] a responder
[48:28] God didn't make you to respond to his

[49:17] a CD of that I want one for when I go
[49:20] amen that was just the meetings have
[49:22] just been so good amen we're going to
[49:23] turn to the word tonight 2 Samuel
[49:25] chapter 23 three if you have your
[49:40] Bible 2 Samuel chapter
[49:45] 23 amen I'd like to minister and and
[49:47] we're going to continue just not it not
[49:50] exactly in the same way that we
[49:52] ministered on uh the morning service
[49:54] yesterday amen but uh but along the same
[49:57] characters and and I believe that the
[49:59] word is so rich amen and and we could uh
[50:02] we we we just want to be blessed by it
[50:04] tonight I'd like to minister to you
[50:06] tonight on the making of a mighty man
[50:09] and when I say man I don't mean it in
[50:11] the sense of gender but I mean it in the
[50:13] sense of Sons and Daughters of God the
[50:15] making of a Mighty Man 2 Samuel chapter
[50:20] 23 verse
[50:21] 8 these be the names of the Mighty Men
[50:25] whom David had the taconite that sat on
[50:28] the seat Chief among the captains the
[50:30] same was adino the eite he lift up his
[50:34] spear against 800 whom he slew at one
[50:40] time that's
[50:42] awesome my goodness we could stop right
[50:45] there is this a fairy tale is this
[50:49] Disney some artificial movie no this is
[50:53] real these were real things that
[50:55] happened in Sons and Daughters of God's
[50:59] lives amen and if I pronounce some of
[51:01] these names wrong you forgive me you
[51:03] might pronounce them different but it
[51:04] says in verse n and after him was
[51:07] Eleazar the son of Dodo the ahite one of
[51:11] the three Mighty Men isn't that
[51:13] something you can be the son of a Dodo
[51:16] and still be a mighty
[51:20] man
[51:24] hallelujah amen
[51:29] it says he was one of the three notice
[51:31] the language here when it says one of
[51:33] the three now to catch you up to speed
[51:35] David is going to have an army we can
[51:38] say that in this Army to be in David's
[51:40] Army you were in the Under the Umbrella
[51:42] of the army of David and it would be an
[51:44] awesome thing to be a soldier in David's
[51:47] Army but within that Army there's going
[51:49] to be categories of men now notice this
[51:52] this is how the writer of Samuel puts it
[51:54] we're going to bring this in a type in
[51:56] the new test Testament but he was going
[51:58] to have an army but within that Army he
[52:01] was going to have 37 what the Bible
[52:04] denotes in their life and calls them
[52:07] Mighty Men not just ordinary man not
[52:11] just an ordinary Soldier but for some
[52:13] reason the character in these Men's Life
[52:16] the Bible records that they were 37
[52:19] Mighty
[52:20] Men and then within that 30 mighty men
[52:24] that David is going to have there's even
[52:26] a deeper class of Excellence called the
[52:29] top
[52:31] three amazing now we know all these
[52:34] things were types and examples as
[52:36] brother John so clearly laid out tonight
[52:38] to this uh this morning that there would
[52:40] be types and examples that the that we
[52:42] could bring today you believe that you
[52:45] can extrapolate things in the scripture
[52:47] and they have a manifold purpose and
[52:48] meaning what's amazing is that he has
[52:50] this top 30 then within that top 30 he's
[52:53] going to have the top three Mighty Men
[52:55] now notice what elzer was it says he was
[52:58] one of the mighty one of the three
[53:00] mighty men with David when they defied
[53:02] the Philistines that were there gathered
[53:04] together to battle and the men of Israel
[53:06] were going away he arose and smote the
[53:09] Philistines until his hand was weary and
[53:11] his hand clav unto the sword the Lord
[53:14] wrought a great victory that day and the
[53:16] people returned after him only to
[53:18] spoil and again and after him was shama
[53:23] the son of age the herit the Philistines
[53:26] were gathered together into a troop
[53:28] where there was a piece of ground full
[53:30] of lentiles the people fled from the
[53:33] Philistines but now who
[53:36] fled
[53:38] Israel this is the rest of the army
[53:41] they're retreating they're running the
[53:44] Bible says but he stood in the midst of
[53:46] the ground and defended it you see when
[53:50] everybody else is running and retreating
[53:51] a mighty man says I'll Stand My
[53:54] Ground Hallelujah
[53:57] you see brother bham said you have to
[53:59] fight for every inch of ground that you
[54:01] gain but you also have to fight to keep
[54:04] the ground that you gain sometimes the
[54:07] fight is not gaining new ground it's
[54:08] holding what God's already given you the
[54:11] Bible says that While others were
[54:12] fleeting verse 12 says but he stood in
[54:14] the midst of the ground and defended it
[54:16] and slew the Philistines and the Lord
[54:18] raw a great Victory three of the 30
[54:21] Chief went down and came to David in the
[54:24] Harvest Time unto the cave of aulum the
[54:26] troop of the Philistines pitched in the
[54:28] valley of refraim and David then was in
[54:29] a hold and the Garrison of the
[54:31] Philistines was then in Bethlehem David
[54:33] long and said oh that one would give me
[54:36] drink of the water of The Well of
[54:37] Bethlehem which is by the gate and the
[54:40] three not the
[54:42] 30 not
[54:44] everybody but there was a choice that
[54:47] was made by three the Bible says that
[54:50] the three Mighty Men broke through the
[54:53] host of the Philistines and Drew water
[54:55] out of the well of Beth that was by the
[54:57] gate and took it brought it to David
[54:59] nevertheless he would not drink thereof
[55:01] but poured it unto the Lord and said be
[55:02] it far from me oh Lord that I should do
[55:04] this say it's not this the blood of the
[55:06] men that went in Jeopardy of their lives
[55:08] therefore he would not drink it these
[55:10] things I love that these exploits these
[55:14] accomplishments these things did these
[55:18] three Mighty Men neishi the brother of
[55:21] joab the son of zeruya was Chief among
[55:23] three he lifted up his spear against
[55:25] three UND and slew them and had notice a
[55:29] name among three but he wasn't in the
[55:31] top
[55:32] three verse 19 was he not most honorable
[55:36] of three therefore he was their Captain
[55:39] how be it he attained not unto the first
[55:44] three it didn't say anything about his
[55:46] last name or because he was unfortunate
[55:49] because he wasn't born in a certain
[55:51] family or his daddy wasn't a pastor or
[55:53] this but it was a personal decision and
[55:56] a personal choice that God said this man
[55:59] attained and this man did not notice he
[56:02] says and he attained not unto the three
[56:06] notice what it says in verse 20 and
[56:08] benayah the son of jodia the son of a
[56:10] vant men of cabil who had done many acts
[56:12] he slew two lionlike men of Moab he went
[56:15] down also and slew a lion in the midst
[56:16] of a pit in the time of snow and he slew
[56:18] an Egyptian a goodly man now goodly if
[56:21] you look that word up in the Hebrew it
[56:23] doesn't mean good in the sense of good
[56:24] or bad it actually means the English
[56:26] word
[56:28] huge he slew a huge man and the Egyptian
[56:32] had a spear in his hand and he went down
[56:33] to him with a staff and pluck the spear
[56:35] out of the Egyptians hand and slew him
[56:36] with his own spear these things did
[56:38] benayah the son of Joda and had the name
[56:41] among three Mighty Men He was more
[56:44] honorable than the
[56:46] 30 so he was in a deeper class than the
[56:49] 30 but he attained not to the first
[56:54] three David sent him over his guard
[56:57] ashel the brother of job and it goes on
[56:59] down to list these men here if you have
[57:00] your Bible just one more scripture we'll
[57:02] have you turn to Mark chapter
[57:06] 4 you love the
[57:10] Lord I hope you're not sleepy
[57:14] tonight Mark chapter 4 a man we'll just
[57:17] begin reading and go through this and
[57:19] have you be seeded Hark and behold verse
[57:22] three there went out a sewer to sew it
[57:24] came to pass as he sowed some fell by
[57:26] the wayside and the fouls of the air
[57:28] came and devoured it up some fell on
[57:30] Stony ground where it had not much Earth
[57:32] and immediately it sprang up because it
[57:34] had no depth of Earth but when the sun
[57:37] was up it was scorched and because it
[57:38] had no root it withered away some fell
[57:41] among thorns and the Thorns grew up and
[57:43] choked it and it yielded no fruit now
[57:46] fell on good ground and did yield fruit
[57:49] that sprang up and increased and brought
[57:53] forth some 30 and some 60
[57:56] and some 100 verse 13 and he said know
[58:00] ye not this Parable verse 14 the S Seth
[58:03] the word these are they by the wayside
[58:05] where the word is sown but when they
[58:07] have heard Satan cometh immediately and
[58:09] taketh away the word that was sown in
[58:11] their hearts these are they likewise
[58:13] which are swn on Stony ground who when
[58:15] they had heard the word immediately
[58:17] received it with gladness so sometimes
[58:20] reaction is not enough many people react
[58:23] to the word it says and he had and he
[58:26] have no root in themselves and have no
[58:28] root in themselves so endured but for a
[58:30] Time afterward when Affliction or
[58:32] persecution ariseth for the word's sake
[58:34] immediately they are offended these are
[58:37] they which are sown among Thorns such as
[58:39] hear the word and the cares of the world
[58:41] the deceitfulness of riches and the lust
[58:42] of other things entering in choke the
[58:44] word and notice what it says and it
[58:46] becometh
[58:48] unfruitful these are they which are sewn
[58:50] on good ground notice such as hear the
[58:53] word and receive it and and bring forth
[58:58] fruit some 30 fold some 60 and some
[59:05] 100 amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord
[59:09] we just stand here again tonight in in
[59:12] need of you Lord and in in need of you
[59:16] father Lord how we need you tonight God
[59:19] it come and break the word Lord to these
[59:22] people to meet their need Lord for
[59:24] father you're their father you're not a
[59:26] Shepherd Lord on the hillside who's not
[59:28] concerned about your people Lord but
[59:30] you're concerned father and you care
[59:33] Lord may you feed them great Shepherd of
[59:35] the sheep Lord you and you'll feed them
[59:38] Lord because that's who you are you're
[59:40] the shepherd you're the great Shepherd
[59:42] Lord and I pray that you would just take
[59:43] every life Lord may we consecrate oursel
[59:46] just now father to be used in your
[59:48] service Grant it Lord Jesus we ask in
[59:51] your name amen you can be
[59:54] seated the mark s of a Mighty Man Mark
[59:58] chapter uh 4 as we've just read is such
[1:00:01] an an an amazing thing and I believe
[1:00:03] that there's a word that you keep
[1:00:05] reading about and you keep hearing in
[1:00:07] this Parable and it goes throughout uh
[1:00:10] this entire example that he he keeps
[1:00:13] repeating this word fruitful or not
[1:00:16] fruitful I believe that one of the most
[1:00:18] essential parts of a Christian in a
[1:00:20] believer's life is that we bear fruit
[1:00:23] from our life not the fruit of our
[1:00:25] opinions what we think or or what we
[1:00:27] want but that we can bear the fruit of
[1:00:30] the word and what's amazing that of all
[1:00:33] these grounds that we have we have
[1:00:35] different classifications we have the
[1:00:38] good ground then we have the Stony
[1:00:39] ground and the thorny ground and and God
[1:00:41] gives these different examples and
[1:00:43] what's amazing is that all the Earth
[1:00:46] received the seed all the Earth heard
[1:00:49] the word all the Earth even some had a
[1:00:51] reaction to the word and reacted and the
[1:00:53] Bible says a non with joy received and
[1:00:56] and was glad and rejoiced but you know
[1:00:58] what was so amazing out of all of these
[1:01:01] types of Earth there was only one
[1:01:03] difference between the good ground and
[1:01:06] the rest of the ground is that while the
[1:01:08] other types of Earth or Humanity had the
[1:01:11] ability by cognitive understanding to
[1:01:14] hear the word and reason with the word
[1:01:16] and sympathize with the word and rejoice
[1:01:19] in the word the difference was is that
[1:01:21] the good ground didn't just hear it but
[1:01:23] they had the ability to produce produce
[1:01:26] what they hear in their
[1:01:28] lives and God says this is the good
[1:01:31] ground that that is fruitful friend
[1:01:33] there is nothing more satisfying as a
[1:01:35] Christian that your life Bears the fruit
[1:01:38] of the word Jesus said every branch that
[1:01:41] beareth not fruit he purges it and every
[1:01:44] branch that beareth fruit he purges it
[1:01:45] that he may bring forth more fruit and
[1:01:48] he takes away the branch that doesn't
[1:01:50] bear fruit what is the the the symbol
[1:01:52] that we keep hearing that our lives are
[1:01:54] fruitful as Christians and God says
[1:01:57] there are different categories that some
[1:01:59] bring 30 fold and some bring 60 fold and
[1:02:02] some bring 100 fold and friend let me
[1:02:05] tell you tonight I'm afraid so many
[1:02:07] people have settled and been content
[1:02:09] bringing 30-fold Christianity in their
[1:02:12] lives but I believe I am preaching to
[1:02:15] somebody tonight that says oh God I
[1:02:18] don't just want to stop with 30f I don't
[1:02:20] want to stop with 60 fold but something
[1:02:23] inside of me says God I want be a h
[1:02:26] hundredfold i want to be a mature
[1:02:29] Christian a fruitful Christian
[1:02:32] Hallelujah I believe I'm preaching to
[1:02:34] people that can say like Paul this one
[1:02:36] thing I don't speak as though I've
[1:02:38] attained or that I'm already perfect but
[1:02:41] this one thing I do I forget yesterday I
[1:02:45] forget what happened last week and
[1:02:48] something inside me is pressing
[1:02:51] me and he said I must press towards the
[1:02:55] mark
[1:02:57] of the high calling in Christ
[1:03:00] Jesus not just a calling not just to be
[1:03:03] called but he's going to say there was
[1:03:06] something special that God while he
[1:03:08] called some and while some came on the
[1:03:10] race and while some received the word
[1:03:13] there was going to be a generation of
[1:03:15] people that wasn't satisfied with just a
[1:03:18] calling but they said I have something
[1:03:21] inside of me that presses towards the
[1:03:23] High Calling
[1:03:26] you set a goal and say Lord I I just
[1:03:28] want to be here I I want to find myself
[1:03:30] in this place but what's amazing is when
[1:03:33] God gives you that Victory you're not
[1:03:35] satisfied there and you set a greater
[1:03:37] goal and say I want to go deeper Lord
[1:03:39] and when I find myself in that place I'm
[1:03:42] not satisfied there I want to go deeper
[1:03:44] Lord I want to go higher
[1:03:47] Lord oh friend listen to me there have
[1:03:50] been men who have literally shook their
[1:03:53] generation there have been men
[1:03:55] throughout the ages that we could say
[1:03:57] were Mighty Men of God they were
[1:04:03] extraordinary they were
[1:04:05] special something about their lives they
[1:04:08] made an impact on people there are some
[1:04:11] people if I could say this tonight and
[1:04:13] and I I want to say it this way that
[1:04:15] there's some people who are in a greater
[1:04:17] class of a Christian now now let me say
[1:04:19] it so that you understand it more
[1:04:21] correctly there are certain Christians
[1:04:23] who are more effective yes and their
[1:04:26] life than others certain Believers that
[1:04:31] something about them they have an impact
[1:04:34] on the world around them and listen
[1:04:37] friend this isn't by any many Mighty Mo
[1:04:39] and God chooses and blesses some but I
[1:04:42] want you to understand that the High
[1:04:44] Calling is a choice that the individual
[1:04:48] has to make
[1:04:50] themselves it is a personal choice that
[1:04:53] that person chooses not just to be glad
[1:04:56] with salvation not just to be glad with
[1:04:59] justification and filled with the Holy
[1:05:01] Ghost but something in them says Lord I
[1:05:04] want to be a weapon to tear the devil's
[1:05:07] Kingdom down I want my life to be a tool
[1:05:11] in your toolbox oh
[1:05:14] god oh I can't stress this enough this
[1:05:17] is a personal
[1:05:19] choice the prophet of God said the voice
[1:05:22] said listen to me William brandom you
[1:05:24] chose
[1:05:28] you
[1:05:29] chose he keeps stressing that this was
[1:05:32] your choice you chose the harder
[1:05:36] way this isn't something I forced upon
[1:05:39] you this isn't something I pressured you
[1:05:41] into but something in your heart said
[1:05:44] I'll choose to take the way with the
[1:05:47] Lord's despised
[1:05:50] Feud this was your choice and because of
[1:05:54] that a great portion of Heaven awaits
[1:05:56] you oh this is the victory in love
[1:06:01] divine it is a personal choice that you
[1:06:05] must make and it's not the easy way the
[1:06:08] High Calling is not the easy way let me
[1:06:11] say when you see what you would term a
[1:06:13] successful believer that didn't come
[1:06:15] just by coming to church and listening
[1:06:17] to the word oh that's good and that's
[1:06:20] okay but I'm afraid so many times we are
[1:06:22] umbilically attached to a pull pit and
[1:06:25] we never see the vision of God for our
[1:06:28] personal life I'm going to preach
[1:06:30] tonight whether y'all want to hear it or
[1:06:32] not I believe that God is calling men
[1:06:36] and God is calling women to say God use
[1:06:39] me if you can use anything Lord you can
[1:06:43] use
[1:06:45] me oh take my hands and my feet Touch My
[1:06:50] Heart Lord speak for me if you can use
[1:06:53] anything get Glory out of my my life get
[1:06:57] Glory out of my life
[1:07:02] Lord
[1:07:04] hallelujah character is not a gift the
[1:07:07] prophet said it's a
[1:07:09] victory and that's why some have it and
[1:07:12] some don't because some choose to fight
[1:07:14] the harder way and some don't amen I
[1:07:16] believe that there is a difference in
[1:07:18] the kingdom of God and what you can
[1:07:19] inherit and what you attain what must we
[1:07:23] do to inherit eternal life you see
[1:07:26] there's nothing you can do that is a
[1:07:29] free gift of God it is something God
[1:07:32] says freely you have receed so freely
[1:07:34] give salvation is the free gift of God
[1:07:38] but that's not the same spiritual
[1:07:40] Excellence is attained amen if by any
[1:07:44] means I might attain until the
[1:07:46] resurrection of the Dead not as though I
[1:07:48] had already attained Paul says or or or
[1:07:50] we're already perfect but I follow after
[1:07:55] if I may apprehend that for which also I
[1:07:58] am apprehended of Christ Jesus Brethren
[1:08:00] I count myself not to have apprehended
[1:08:02] but I press toward the mark for the
[1:08:05] prize of the High Calling of God in
[1:08:07] Christ
[1:08:10] Jesus let me say this and when it start
[1:08:13] simple it is an awesome thing to be
[1:08:18] justified have we forgotten how awesome
[1:08:21] it is just to be saved
[1:08:26] oh I know that's not enough and you've
[1:08:27] got to press on into the Holy Spirit the
[1:08:29] baptism of the Holy Ghost but have we
[1:08:31] forgotten how awesome it is to know my
[1:08:35] sins which were many have all been
[1:08:38] washed
[1:08:41] away have we forgotten how awesome of a
[1:08:44] thing it is for God to justify oh friend
[1:08:47] justification is not and I'm afraid so
[1:08:50] many people have only got the mental
[1:08:52] intellectual understanding of this you
[1:08:55] see brother Ram said justification is
[1:08:57] not when you you take a man who's
[1:08:59] accused of murder and he's a murderer
[1:09:02] and you take that man and he goes into
[1:09:04] the courtroom and the justice system
[1:09:06] looks at him and says yeah you did it
[1:09:09] yeah you're a murderer you committed the
[1:09:11] crime and you know it yes sir yes sir I
[1:09:13] know I did but I'm going to choose to
[1:09:16] have mercy on you and I'm going to
[1:09:18] forgive you
[1:09:21] forgiven now listen so many people this
[1:09:25] is is their model of justification and
[1:09:28] it doesn't
[1:09:29] work you know why because while the
[1:09:31] court says that man's Justified why the
[1:09:34] court says that man has been forgiven
[1:09:37] when the man walks out of the courtroom
[1:09:40] he's plagued with the conscience because
[1:09:42] he knows who he
[1:09:46] is and he's plagued with the guilt and
[1:09:49] he's plagued with the sin and though the
[1:09:52] court says you're free and you're
[1:09:54] Justified he won't walks out with the
[1:09:56] guilty conscience of a murderer and he
[1:09:58] knows he committed the sin and he knows
[1:10:00] he's condemned and though they gave
[1:10:02] Mercy to him friend this is not
[1:10:05] justification the Bible says that the
[1:10:07] worshipper in the Old Testament though
[1:10:09] he would all for the sin sacrifice yet
[1:10:12] when he left there he was plagued with
[1:10:15] the Consciousness that he was not a
[1:10:17] different
[1:10:20] person he was he was forgiven he was
[1:10:22] atoned for but he knew that there was a
[1:10:24] nature in inside of him that Comm
[1:10:26] allowed him to commit the sin in the
[1:10:28] first place and the Bible says for if
[1:10:30] the sacrifice of Bloods and goats could
[1:10:32] have atoned and freed this man they
[1:10:35] would have continually been offered
[1:10:38] today but it could not but the Bible
[1:10:40] says that the worshipper under this
[1:10:43] atonement the worshipper once
[1:10:46] purged is free from the conscience of
[1:10:50] his sin Hallelujah because that man
[1:10:53] doesn't get looked at what happens when
[1:10:54] God justifies that man is when the court
[1:10:57] system looks at a man who the devil says
[1:11:00] is a murderer and the judge says you're
[1:11:02] not a murderer you were trapped into it
[1:11:06] you never did it in the first
[1:11:09] place
[1:11:11] Hallelujah and brother random said a
[1:11:13] revelation drops inside that man's soul
[1:11:16] and something tells him I am righteous
[1:11:19] through the righteousness of Christ
[1:11:25] something tells him I'm I wasn't born to
[1:11:27] be a murderer I wasn't born to be a
[1:11:29] drunk man I was born to be a Dwelling
[1:11:32] Place of almighty
[1:11:36] God oh friend listen to me you weren't
[1:11:39] born to be on a bar stool that's not who
[1:11:41] you are you weren't born to be a sports
[1:11:44] star that's not who you are you're a
[1:11:47] pilgrim and a
[1:11:50] stranger you're not from here oh let me

[1:12:00] different
[1:12:02] language you thirst for different things
[1:12:05] the world can't satisfy
[1:12:08] you let me say You're an Alien
[1:12:12] here and there's a burning desire in
[1:12:14] your heart view the land oh I'm longing
[1:12:19] for

[1:12:58] is the world had given them
[1:13:00] Nebuchadnezzar took those Jewish boys
[1:13:03] and he renamed them at a very young age

[1:13:09] identity and your name speaks of your
[1:13:12] origin your name speaks of who you are
[1:13:15] and who your daddy is and where you came
[1:13:17] from and where you come from reveals

[1:14:05] were he tried and they had forgotten
[1:14:08] their identity they had forgotten who
[1:14:10] they were Shadrach you weren't Shadrach

[1:14:15] name a b too Shadrach your name was

[1:15:31] Hallelujah that's what happens when God
[1:15:33] justifies a man a revelation that only
[1:15:36] God I want to stress that only God can
[1:15:39] give that Revelation you can mentally
[1:15:42] try to get your hand around it and say
[1:15:43] I'm forgiven I'm forgiven I'm forgiven
[1:15:45] Lord I believe your blood and I accept
[1:15:46] your blood I accept your blood but that
[1:15:48] conscience always bother you brother
[1:15:50] Brandon said when God justifies a man
[1:15:53] you're justified by faith
[1:15:55] and he said it's a revelation that drops
[1:15:58] in your
[1:16:00] heart and listen to me friend when the
[1:16:03] preacher sermon couldn't help you and
[1:16:05] Mama's praying couldn't help you and it
[1:16:07] seemed like nothing was going to stop
[1:16:09] anything nothing was ever going to get
[1:16:10] your attention and when your friends and
[1:16:12] your loved ones were praying for you and
[1:16:14] nothing seemed to move you but when God
[1:16:17] said it's time to reach down and save
[1:16:20] you let me tell you nothing in Hell
[1:16:23] could stop it from coming forth
[1:16:26] because Christ looked at you and said
[1:16:30] Lazarus come
[1:16:32] forth and a man who had been dead in
[1:16:35] sins and
[1:16:37] trespasses something pulled him out of
[1:16:39] the
[1:16:41] Grave oh nothing can stop the plan of
[1:16:44] God let me say that again nothing can
[1:16:47] stop the plan of God no weapon formed
[1:16:50] against you shall
[1:16:51] prosper no device or plan of the devil
[1:16:54] that he can put on your
[1:16:57] life if you're an elected son or
[1:16:59] daughter of God Jesus said all the
[1:17:01] father has given me will come to me and
[1:17:05] I won't lose
[1:17:08] one cuz they're in the palm of my
[1:17:12] hand oh you love the Lord am oh it's an
[1:17:16] awesome thing to be justified it's an
[1:17:19] awesome thing to be saved it's an
[1:17:21] awesome thing to be Sanctified because
[1:17:23] what does San what is justification do
[1:17:26] when you're Justified you realize you're
[1:17:27] not from here you're a King's
[1:17:30] son you're you're from another country
[1:17:34] and so what does it cause you to do
[1:17:36] causes you to say if I'm a King's son I
[1:17:38] want to dress like a Kings son and I
[1:17:40] want to live like a King's son and I
[1:17:42] want to sanctify my vessel to look like
[1:17:45] where I'm from because I don't speak the
[1:17:47] same language as the world I don't speak
[1:17:50] ESPN I don't speak all these things that
[1:17:52] the world chases after those things
[1:17:54] don't satisfy me they don't move
[1:17:57] me but I say like David you're my
[1:18:00] portion Lord David said in the Book of
[1:18:03] Psalms chapter 82 I think it is all my
[1:18:06] Springs are in you
[1:18:08] Lord imagine that David said all my
[1:18:11] Springs in other words everything that I
[1:18:13] thirst for in life I find it in
[1:18:18] you
[1:18:21] Glory
[1:18:22] Hallelujah Hallelujah it's an awesome
[1:18:25] thing to be Sanctified but it's an even
[1:18:27] greater thing when God fills that vessel
[1:18:30] with his own Zoey life and you become
[1:18:33] what Paul called a new
[1:18:37] creature I said a new creature whoever
[1:18:41] is in Christ is a new creature Jesus
[1:18:44] Christ was the beginning of the new
[1:18:46] creation and when a man is Born Again by
[1:18:49] the spirit of God he is the continuation
[1:18:52] of that new creation of the same life
[1:18:55] with the same
[1:18:56] power let me tell you something when
[1:18:58] you're in Christ you're not an American
[1:19:01] you're not a Canadian you're not black
[1:19:03] you're not white you're a new
[1:19:06] creature Hallelujah and you're not
[1:19:09] subject to the spirit of the country
[1:19:11] you're from you're subject to the spirit
[1:19:14] of
[1:19:17] Christ
[1:19:20] hallelujah oh we got to get to our
[1:19:22] sermon tonight
[1:19:26] what separates these men as the Bible
[1:19:29] says if I could go through some things
[1:19:31] tonight and I would call them you can
[1:19:33] write these down if you want the marks
[1:19:36] what are the marks of a mighty man what
[1:19:39] denoted these Men's Life as we said
[1:19:41] David had 30 and then on top of the 30
[1:19:43] in a deeper category he had the top
[1:19:46] three but what made these men what
[1:19:48] denoted their life what was the
[1:19:51] characteristics we could say what were
[1:19:53] the marks of a mighty man one mark of a
[1:19:57] mighty man is that his core and his
[1:20:01] center of his
[1:20:03] being is the presence of the
[1:20:07] Lord his core and his center of his
[1:20:11] being is the presence of the Lord turn
[1:20:14] to Psalms chapter 51 quickly if you have
[1:20:16] your Bible here we go back to David
[1:20:18] right where we left
[1:20:20] off Psalms chapter 51 you love the Lord
[1:20:23] Jesus oh his word just so
[1:20:26] awesome
[1:20:28] my his coron is Center notice what David
[1:20:31] says and David is going to be a mighty
[1:20:33] man he's going to be the captain of this
[1:20:35] host of Mighty Men and their King and
[1:20:38] notice as we as we see this
[1:20:40] characteristic in David's life we're
[1:20:41] going to find something out about who
[1:20:43] David was as a
[1:20:46] person and it says here in Psalms
[1:20:48] chapter 51 David comes on down and we
[1:20:51] know he's been exposed by Nathan as
[1:20:53] we've ministered and David starts to
[1:20:55] pray this prayer and then David in the
[1:20:58] middle of this prayer says something
[1:21:00] very interesting and don't skip over it
[1:21:02] and and think of the song and we we can
[1:21:04] sometimes make things cliche and lose
[1:21:05] the purpose and meaning of why he said
[1:21:07] it but he says here in verse 11 cast me
[1:21:11] not away from thy
[1:21:14] presence and take not thy Holy Spirit
[1:21:18] from me now we know David was not born
[1:21:20] again in the sense that we are born
[1:21:22] again Jesus said in Mark 7 John chap 7
[1:21:25] he that believeth on me shall out of his
[1:21:26] belly flow rivers of Living Water but he
[1:21:28] spoke of the spirit which had not yet
[1:21:30] came yet this is Elementary Jesus had
[1:21:33] not yet ascended his he had not sent the
[1:21:35] comforter so David was not born again in
[1:21:38] the sense that he had the Holy Ghost
[1:21:40] living in his soul but David knew what
[1:21:43] it was like to commune and fellowship
[1:21:47] and speak to
[1:21:48] God he knew that that he knew about the
[1:21:52] the spirit he knew about the presence of
[1:21:54] the Lord Lord and David at a very young
[1:21:56] age experiences this presence and David
[1:21:59] comes to this area in his life and he
[1:22:01] prays and he says cast me not away this
[1:22:03] word cast is the same as we would take
[1:22:06] as when a father kicks a child out of
[1:22:08] their house and this is actually the
[1:22:11] term that David is using because of what
[1:22:13] he's feeling and David says cast me not
[1:22:16] away from thy presence oh
[1:22:19] Lord and take not your Holy Spirit from
[1:22:23] me now why would David even fear this in
[1:22:26] his life why would David pray cast me
[1:22:29] not away from thy presence and don't
[1:22:33] take your Holy Spirit as we said on the
[1:22:36] Saturday morning this was not a poem
[1:22:38] that's right this was a cry of
[1:22:41] desperation it was like a child begging
[1:22:43] his father Oh Daddy please don't kick me
[1:22:46] out that's what David was saying I know
[1:22:49] I've sinned I know I've fallen but you
[1:22:51] don't understand please don't do that to
[1:22:54] me
[1:22:55] please don't cast me away from your
[1:22:57] presence please don't take your Holy
[1:22:59] Spirit from me you know why because
[1:23:02] David starts remembering back in his
[1:23:04] mind and David's memory goes back to
[1:23:06] when he was a little boy and now David
[1:23:09] is realizing that God put David in the
[1:23:11] house of Saul for a
[1:23:14] reason because David was going to have
[1:23:16] the unique ability to grow up in the
[1:23:18] house of Saul and spend many many many
[1:23:22] weeks in Saul's house watching how Saul
[1:23:25] operated as a king watching how Saul was
[1:23:27] as a person watching how he handled the
[1:23:29] Affairs because God had a man in
[1:23:31] training and David remembers all this in
[1:23:34] his memory and he goes back in his mind
[1:23:36] and God is training said David in this
[1:23:39] time of his life because God is
[1:23:40] literally telling David David I want you
[1:23:43] to learn what you're never to
[1:23:51] become you're not to ever become a soul
[1:23:55] because you're David he never said Saul
[1:23:57] was a man after his own heart but
[1:23:59] something about David God said he's a
[1:24:01] man after my own heart and David goes
[1:24:04] back in his memory as he's there
[1:24:06] confronted with his own guilt and his
[1:24:08] own failures and his own mistakes and
[1:24:11] David remembers Saul and David says I
[1:24:13] remember another time and there was
[1:24:16] another king and his name was Saul and
[1:24:19] here's the prophet Nathan and there was
[1:24:21] a prophet to Saul his name was Samuel
[1:24:25] and David saysi remember in my mind
[1:24:28] watching and it seemed like it seemed
[1:24:31] like Saul you know he Saul s Saul Saul
[1:24:34] lived such a very different life as
[1:24:36] David watched you know to Saul the
[1:24:38] presence of God didn't really mean that
[1:24:41] much you know for some people the
[1:24:43] presence of God really doesn't mean that
[1:24:46] much the presence of God to them and to
[1:24:49] fill The Spirit Well yeah if I can then
[1:24:51] good if I don't it's not that important
[1:24:53] it's not a IAL to my life David was very
[1:24:57] different and it seemed like you know it
[1:24:59] didn't really bother Saul seemed like
[1:25:01] David could remember Saul and I remember
[1:25:04] Time and Time Again David said when we'd
[1:25:06] go to battle and and Saul would would
[1:25:09] leave he he'd get you know 80% Victory
[1:25:11] and leave
[1:25:12] 20% and it seemed like he was always
[1:25:15] content and that was always okay with
[1:25:18] Saul to get some victory but not all
[1:25:21] Victory you know live half in the world
[1:25:23] half in church
[1:25:27] you know for some people they're
[1:25:28] comfortable
[1:25:29] here brother said they live in very in
[1:25:32] degrees of
[1:25:33] sanctification they never press on
[1:25:35] friend I don't know there's not a more
[1:25:36] uncomfortable place to be than sitting
[1:25:38] on the
[1:25:40] fence and some people are uncomfortable
[1:25:42] because they're on the fence brother
[1:25:44] random said many come out not many go
[1:25:45] into amen and David remembers as Saul so
[1:25:49] many times Saul would go to battle and
[1:25:51] Samuel would come and say why have you
[1:25:54] disobeyed the voice of the Lord didn't
[1:25:56] he tell you to destroy everything then
[1:25:59] why do I hear the bleeding of Sheep
[1:26:02] amen if I told you to kid to get rid of
[1:26:05] everything and to kick out everything
[1:26:06] why do I still h a television in the
[1:26:08] background why do I still see those
[1:26:10] Hollywood films and movies in your life
[1:26:13] come on
[1:26:14] Saul isn't it important to
[1:26:19] you you know this is the amazing thing
[1:26:22] and I would have stopped to say this
[1:26:23] this is the amazing thing I'm read
[1:26:24] realizing as as I grow in Christ is that
[1:26:27] no matter how hard you preach to some
[1:26:29] people they'll never
[1:26:31] change let me say this the ultimate sign
[1:26:34] that my body will change in a body
[1:26:36] change is that I have the ability to
[1:26:38] change now my life under the preached
[1:26:43] word and these people that are unmovable
[1:26:46] and unchangeable I fear for you in
[1:26:48] Rapture
[1:26:50] time and it seemed like sa was always
[1:26:53] content with this and he was was always
[1:26:54] okay and he would always come up with
[1:26:56] and he would always come up with this
[1:26:58] excuse and this reason oh me and the
[1:27:02] people you see there safety in
[1:27:05] numbers he had the attitude of oh lord
[1:27:07] it's all of us are guilty you know I
[1:27:09] mean don't blame don't don't single me
[1:27:10] out Lord and then when God would be
[1:27:13] displeased and the presence of the Lord
[1:27:14] would depart you notice what Saul would
[1:27:16] always say Saul would always say Samuel
[1:27:18] pray for me isn't it amazing his entire
[1:27:21] experience was only through a prophet
[1:27:24] and he never had an experience for
[1:27:28] himself are you with me tonight and
[1:27:32] David said I remember I remember time
[1:27:34] and time and time and time again I
[1:27:37] watched and Saul would just go on and on
[1:27:39] and Sam would come and samel would
[1:27:41] rebuke him and he would tell him Saul
[1:27:43] get right Saul you don't understand but
[1:27:45] this was the Saul
[1:27:47] Center always came with half Victory and
[1:27:51] the problem was he was okay with it
[1:27:57] David
[1:27:58] says but I remember it didn't always
[1:28:02] stay that way it didn't just go on and
[1:28:05] on and on and on and on and on David
[1:28:07] says Lord I remember after you warned
[1:28:11] him time and time again there came a day
[1:28:14] when Saul sat out of his own mouth the
[1:28:16] presence of the Lord as
[1:28:21] part pray for me he goes to the witch of
[1:28:23] indor he can't speak to the Lord because
[1:28:25] the spirit has left
[1:28:29] him David could not imagine a more
[1:28:32] terrifying
[1:28:34] thing and for the believer there is
[1:28:37] nothing you fear
[1:28:39] more than the presence of
[1:28:47] God there's nothing you fear more than
[1:28:51] the presence of God because you love it
[1:28:53] so much
[1:28:55] and you thirst for it so much it is who
[1:28:57] you
[1:28:59] are you can't be satisfied by the world
[1:29:02] it doesn't quench your thirst there's
[1:29:03] only one thing that quenches The Thirst
[1:29:05] of the believer and that's the presence
[1:29:07] of
[1:29:08] God he is your portion he is what keeps
[1:29:12] you going day by day by day oh the drunk
[1:29:15] man he takes his alcohol the poe head he
[1:29:18] takes his pot the drug at it takes his
[1:29:21] drugs because brother Isaiah that's all
[1:29:23] he's
[1:29:24] got that's all he's got that his all his
[1:29:28] joy and all his happiness is contained
[1:29:31] because that's all he's got so he is
[1:29:35] going to get everything he possibly can
[1:29:37] because it's the only joy and the only
[1:29:39] happiness do you realize friend this is
[1:29:42] all you've
[1:29:43] got Oh
[1:29:45] Glory this is all we've
[1:29:48] got this is who I am I love coming to
[1:29:51] church I love worshiping the Lord I love
[1:29:54] talking to the Lord because it's all
[1:29:57] I've
[1:29:58] got and if it's all I've got I'm going
[1:30:00] to give him everything that I
[1:30:04] have you see Saul this didn't really
[1:30:07] bother him and Saul David says I
[1:30:09] remember and
[1:30:10] eventually eventually left him but David
[1:30:13] says Lord please don't do that to me
[1:30:17] because I'm different than Saul Saul
[1:30:19] could live without the presence of God
[1:30:22] but for David David said it's my life
[1:30:25] you see the mighty man of God is marked
[1:30:27] because his core and his Center is the
[1:30:30] presence and the communion with
[1:30:33] Christ David revealed who he was in
[1:30:36] Psalms chapter 27 when he said one thing
[1:30:40] have I desired of the Lord in other
[1:30:43] words David could say if if you're
[1:30:45] seeking to to build a nice home and and
[1:30:48] I have riches in this world well that's
[1:30:50] okay but but I can't relate to you cuz
[1:30:52] that's not who I am if you're seeking to
[1:30:55] you know to be some celebrity or or to
[1:30:57] be known in the world or to have some
[1:30:59] social status David could say you know
[1:31:01] if you're chasing Hollywood and chasing
[1:31:03] Beauty and chasing women and chasing all
[1:31:05] these other things if you're chasing a
[1:31:08] life of worldism David could say I I
[1:31:11] just can't relate to you because there's
[1:31:13] only one thing I want out of this
[1:31:18] life oh does anybody feel that way
[1:31:21] tonight there's only one thing I W Lord
[1:31:25] one thing have I desired and David said
[1:31:27] and that will I seek after to dwell in
[1:31:31] the presence of God in the secret of his
[1:31:34] Tabernacle all the days of my
[1:31:40] life this is what marks a mighty
[1:31:43] man as we said on Saturday morning one
[1:31:46] of the marks of a mighty man is that he
[1:31:48] has victory in his private life not just
[1:31:52] his public life but God had to get
[1:31:54] victory in David's private life are you
[1:31:56] awake tonight he had to get victory in
[1:31:59] David's private life because God said
[1:32:01] David it's not so much who you are on
[1:32:04] the outside but I want truth to dwell on
[1:32:06] the inside amen you see a lot of people
[1:32:09] can shout and a lot of people can sing
[1:32:11] at church but they're a very different
[1:32:13] person when they're all by themselves
[1:32:16] but you are who you are when nobody else
[1:32:19] is
[1:32:20] watching The Mark of a mighty man is
[1:32:23] that he is a giant
[1:32:27] slayer one of the marks of a mighty man
[1:32:30] is that he's a giant slayer you see
[1:32:32] David was not the only Giant
[1:32:35] Slayer oh y'all didn't know
[1:32:38] that we love the story of David and
[1:32:41] Goliath but you see David was going to
[1:32:43] have men that surrounded his life and
[1:32:46] these mighty men would be giant Slayers
[1:32:49] notice this in 1 chonicles 20 you don't
[1:32:50] need to turn but it says it came to pass
[1:32:54] after this there was what there arose a
[1:32:56] war at gazer with the Philistines at
[1:32:58] which time saachi the hasite slew sypon
[1:33:03] that was of the children of the Giant
[1:33:05] and they were subdued oh yall preach on
[1:33:07] that right I mean that was some probably
[1:33:08] Sunday school lesson this morning was
[1:33:11] probably teaching on saaki and cpii
[1:33:15] right we all got pictures of saaki
[1:33:17] killing
[1:33:20] CPI there was war again verse eight for
[1:33:23] the there was war again with the
[1:33:24] Philistines and elhanan the son of jir
[1:33:27] slew Lami the brother of Goliath Lami
[1:33:32] not llama Lami he slew Lami the brother
[1:33:37] of
[1:33:38] Goliath who spash spear staff was like a
[1:33:41] Weaver's beam and yet again there was
[1:33:43] where gath there was where there was a
[1:33:45] man of great stature whose fingers and
[1:33:48] toes were four and 26 on each hand that
[1:33:52] guy had a lot of fing fing and
[1:33:56] Toes six on each foot he was also the
[1:33:59] son of the giant but when he defied
[1:34:02] Israel Jonathan the son of shimya
[1:34:06] David's brother slew
[1:34:09] him you see courage breeds courage
[1:34:14] amen and these men had to catch a
[1:34:16] revelation for themselves that if David
[1:34:19] could do it and if God could use David
[1:34:22] God can use
[1:34:24] me
[1:34:26] Hallelujah if God could use David to
[1:34:29] kill a giant he could use my life
[1:34:32] too you see what I'm afraid of is that
[1:34:35] we have a tendency in humanity to raise
[1:34:37] up a hero in our mind but fail to see
[1:34:39] the reality of God in our own life I'm
[1:34:42] going to be real careful when I say this
[1:34:44] but I think so many times we have gods
[1:34:46] and heroes of our own imagination and we
[1:34:49] Crown a minister or some spiritual
[1:34:51] person and they win all of our battles
[1:34:54] and they have all the victories and we
[1:34:55] watch all the Miracles and in the
[1:34:57] message so many times this has been the
[1:34:59] problem we have crowned Kings and
[1:35:03] heroesall and we fail to see that God
[1:35:06] has a vision for
[1:35:09] us are you with me here tonight there's
[1:35:12] a natural tendency inside of humanity
[1:35:15] towards idolatry that's why a little boy
[1:35:17] wears Superman pajamas and Batman
[1:35:19] pajamas and he wants some Superman or
[1:35:21] some Batman some of y'all might still
[1:35:23] have him on tonight Lord help us but
[1:35:27] there's something inside of him when
[1:35:29] he's even young that he wants a hero he
[1:35:31] wants someone he can look to brother
[1:35:33] bandam says this in the Ephesian Church
[1:35:36] age uh let me find my place here he says
[1:35:40] Paul saw it coming notice listen very
[1:35:42] close I wish I could have put this on
[1:35:43] the screen Paul saw it coming but he
[1:35:46] warned them about this subtle priesthood
[1:35:48] that would come in and take over with
[1:35:49] this false Doctrine he knew they would
[1:35:52] implement a way of worship that
[1:35:56] excluded the
[1:35:58] people from any part in the Holy Spirit
[1:36:02] Ministry and even right today among
[1:36:05] those who claim to be free and full of
[1:36:08] the spirit there is not too much freedom
[1:36:12] in the
[1:36:14] Ley and the best we can see is a few
[1:36:19] preachers with inspired preaching
[1:36:24] while the flock just sits there and
[1:36:27] tries to absorb
[1:36:30] it I thought that was my job brother man
[1:36:33] I thought I come to church and you know
[1:36:34] the minister he waits on God and he
[1:36:36] speaks to God and he carries God in his
[1:36:38] briefcase he comes out here and he gives
[1:36:39] us God and we all rejoice and say amen
[1:36:41] and we absorb
[1:36:44] it I'm telling you what sippi and and
[1:36:49] Lami learned a different lesson they
[1:36:51] learned that while there was great men
[1:36:52] like David that courage Brad courage and
[1:36:55] there was other men who said if God
[1:36:58] could use my king he can use my
[1:37:01] [Music]
[1:37:05] life brother renom said this is a far
[1:37:08] cry from Paul who said when all come
[1:37:11] together all have the leading of the
[1:37:14] spirit and all
[1:37:16] participate in spiritual
[1:37:20] worship oh give the Lord a hand clap of
[1:37:22] praise tonight
[1:37:24] [Applause]
[1:37:29] hallelujah oh
[1:37:31] Hallelujah brother Ram says the best we
[1:37:34] can see is a few preachers with inspired
[1:37:38] preaching oh friend what you must pray
[1:37:40] tonight is to say God take that inspired
[1:37:43] preaching and Inspire my life
[1:37:46] Lord if you can use anything Lord you
[1:37:50] can use me
[1:37:55] you see it's a complex leader that will
[1:37:59] squash the other giant Slayers in his
[1:38:04] ministry it is a complex man who wants
[1:38:07] to squash the other gifts because they
[1:38:09] intimidate and challenge his own
[1:38:12] position and we have seen this over and
[1:38:14] over and over again but I believe I'm
[1:38:17] preaching to men and to women tonight
[1:38:20] that say God you have a plan for my life
[1:38:22] where's my giant where's my giant I
[1:38:26] don't need to wait on a man of God or a
[1:38:28] sermon he is greater he that is in me is
[1:38:31] greater than he that's in the world I
[1:38:33] can do all things through Christ who
[1:38:36] gives me
[1:38:39] strength hallelujah
[1:38:43] hallelujah verse 20 turn to second
[1:38:45] Samuel if you have your Bible still open
[1:38:47] there turn back there 2 Samuel 20 you
[1:38:50] love the Lord amen
[1:38:56] 2 Samuel chapter 20 we're just skipping
[1:38:58] over a lot of this just to save time
[1:39:00] knowing it's the evening service and
[1:39:02] some of you are tired but we want to get
[1:39:03] to this 2 Samuel 20 and notice what he
[1:39:06] what he talks about here and I'm sorry
[1:39:08] it's uh second Samuel
[1:39:14] 23 the Bible says in verse 20 and Ben
[1:39:18] bah the son of jhoda the son of a
[1:39:21] valiant man of cabil who had done many
[1:39:24] acts he slew two lionlike
[1:39:28] men man I've seen some big guys in my
[1:39:31] time but I don't think I've ever called
[1:39:33] anybody lion
[1:39:36] likee ever looked at him said man that
[1:39:38] guy's lion like he's so big he's lion
[1:39:42] likee but there was something about this
[1:39:44] man that the Bible said he was like a
[1:39:46] lion and notice who they're from the
[1:39:48] Bible says they were lion like men of
[1:39:51] Moab who is Moab
[1:39:53] children of Moab ancestral Affair
[1:39:56] between lot and his daughters brother
[1:39:57] brandom typed and the Bible types the
[1:39:59] entire through the scriptures is a type
[1:40:01] of the flesh this is the flesh he says
[1:40:04] he slew two lionlike men of Moab he went
[1:40:07] down also and slew a lion man he had it
[1:40:11] out for
[1:40:13] Lions he slew a lion in the midst of a
[1:40:17] pit in the time of
[1:40:21] snow I know some some of y'all are
[1:40:23] looking like
[1:40:25] okay this is not your ordinary Bible
[1:40:28] verse but let me present something to
[1:40:30] you tonight unordinary men don't create
[1:40:34] ordinary Bible
[1:40:36] verses but you see there's something
[1:40:38] very off something very different about
[1:40:42] these Mighty Men they're very different
[1:40:45] than everybody else you see when other
[1:40:47] kids when David was a little boy and
[1:40:48] other kids were playing Xbox and p uh
[1:40:51] Playstation and all these other things
[1:40:52] David didn't find any interest in that
[1:40:54] David was praying as a little boy teach
[1:40:56] My Hands to
[1:40:58] War David was wrestling Bears and Lions
[1:41:01] as a as a teenager because there was
[1:41:03] something different about his life he
[1:41:06] knew he was
[1:41:09] unique and the Bible says that he goes
[1:41:12] into a pit in the time of snow and he
[1:41:15] slew he slew a lion in the midst of a
[1:41:18] pit and the time of snow could you
[1:41:20] imagine when this man goes into a pit
[1:41:23] now now what's what's amazing is that uh
[1:41:26] he comes before this great pit and
[1:41:28] there's this great Lion now this this
[1:41:30] lion is one of the most fearsome
[1:41:31] creatures in the
[1:41:33] world I actually read a book a man wrote
[1:41:36] about about all this with with this man
[1:41:37] B it was so good that the lion is one of
[1:41:40] the most dangerous creatures and bayah
[1:41:43] goes before this pit and he sees this
[1:41:46] great big lion and he decides to jump
[1:41:52] in you see normal people go the other
[1:41:56] [Music]
[1:41:57] way I can imagine some of y'all in a
[1:42:00] testimony would come to church and say
[1:42:01] oh I've got a testimony to tell brother
[1:42:04] I got to tell a testimony I was out in
[1:42:06] the woods and and I walked across this
[1:42:08] great pit and there was an African lion
[1:42:10] in there reaching for me and he couldn't
[1:42:12] get to
[1:42:13] me praise the Lord he delivered me
[1:42:24] but you see a mighty man is very
[1:42:26] different a mighty man thinks different
[1:42:29] he acts different he loves a good
[1:42:32] challenge and the Bible says this mighty
[1:42:35] man of God look down at that lion and
[1:42:38] jumps inside the pit I heard the man say
[1:42:41] you can tell when he comes out of the
[1:42:42] pit of Bah comes crawling out and he's
[1:42:44] got blood dripping from him and he's got
[1:42:46] marks all over him and flesh hanging
[1:42:48] from him and he's Victorious and he
[1:42:50] looks his clothes are tattered and torn
[1:42:52] and oh he just looks busted up and
[1:42:54] someone says if you think he looks bad
[1:42:56] you should see the
[1:43:00] LI cuz he tore that lion from one side
[1:43:03] to the other because he believed that if
[1:43:06] God could take David who was my king and
[1:43:09] David said with his bare hands he slew a
[1:43:12] lion then God can use me
[1:43:22] too and he goes down into this pit he
[1:43:24] kills this lion in a time of snow and
[1:43:27] the Bible says that God makes him David
[1:43:29] made him his
[1:43:31] bodyguard I'd imagine that a man who
[1:43:34] goes into a pit in a time of snow and
[1:43:38] kills a lion I'd want him to be my body
[1:43:40] go too heard the man say imagine when
[1:43:43] when David was going through resumés
[1:43:44] this man says oh I can bench press 900
[1:43:46] pounds this man says oh I can lift a car
[1:43:48] and throw at 30t this man he comes to
[1:43:50] the next resume and this man says oh you
[1:43:51] know I can shoot a gun and hit a Target
[1:43:53] at 700 yard he comes to bayah I went
[1:43:56] into a pit and killed a lion in a time
[1:43:58] of snow and David said that's my
[1:44:06] man you see he had a choice to walk the
[1:44:08] other way he had a choice to take his
[1:44:11] fear in his life that he had from when
[1:44:13] he was a little boy he had a choice to
[1:44:15] always run from it his entire
[1:44:18] life he had a choice to be like
[1:44:20] everybody else around him and live like
[1:44:24] everybody else but there was something
[1:44:26] he determined in his heart and said I'm
[1:44:28] not going to be like everybody I'm not
[1:44:30] going to be the normal I am unnormal and
[1:44:34] I'm going to jump into my pit and face
[1:44:37] my
[1:44:38] fears word
[1:44:40] hallelujah because this man was a mighty
[1:44:43] man of God he slew an Egyptian verse 21
[1:44:46] look in your Bible he slew an Egyptian a
[1:44:49] goodly man which means huge so he kills
[1:44:51] a giant and the Egyptian had a spear in
[1:44:52] his hand he went down to him with the
[1:44:54] staff plucked the spirit of the
[1:44:54] Egyptians hand and slew him so he had
[1:44:56] Victory I love this a mighty man of God
[1:44:59] has victory in three categories he had
[1:45:02] victory over Moab which is the flesh he
[1:45:05] had victory over an Egyptian which is
[1:45:07] the world and ultimately they'll have
[1:45:10] victory over his
[1:45:13] adversary the Bible says your adversary
[1:45:15] is like a lion going to and fro the
[1:45:17] Bible says but they overcame him by the
[1:45:21] blood of the lamb and notice by the word
[1:45:25] of
[1:45:27] their
[1:45:28] testimony not what God did through a
[1:45:30] prophet not what God did through a
[1:45:32] preacher but they overcame him by their
[1:45:34] own personal
[1:45:40] testimony David finds himself in 2
[1:45:42] Samuel 23 look over there just just a
[1:45:44] few verses back we're not going to be
[1:45:46] too much longer I'm do I still have your
[1:45:48] attention
[1:45:49] tonight 2 Samuel chapter 23 verse 9 11
[1:45:53] says let me let me find my place David
[1:45:56] was in a hold verse 14 David was then in
[1:45:58] a hold and the Garrison of the
[1:45:59] Philistines was then in Bethlehem and
[1:46:01] David longed and said oh that one would
[1:46:04] give me drink of the water of The Well
[1:46:05] of Bethlehem which is by the gate and
[1:46:08] the three Mighty
[1:46:10] Men broke through the host of the
[1:46:12] Philistines and Drew water out of the
[1:46:14] well of Bethlehem that was by the gate
[1:46:15] and took it and brought it to David you
[1:46:17] know what's so amazing about these men's
[1:46:19] life because one of the marks of a
[1:46:21] mighty man is that he has the ability to
[1:46:24] discern the anointed man of his
[1:46:30] age now listen very close this was not
[1:46:33] King David this was not David the
[1:46:37] accepted this was not David the
[1:46:39] worshiped this was not David the exalted
[1:46:41] this was David the
[1:46:44] Renegade brother bam called him a
[1:46:46] renegade he was on the Run running for
[1:46:47] his life had just a few men he's living
[1:46:50] in a cave running for his life and the
[1:46:55] Bible says that is at this time that
[1:46:57] David starts to long now notice he
[1:46:59] doesn't go out and broadcast this to the
[1:47:01] whole Army he doesn't walk out and go
[1:47:04] man my mouth is dry I wish somebody
[1:47:08] would give me a drink from the water of
[1:47:11] Bethlehem hint
[1:47:15] hint he doesn't broadcast the desire
[1:47:17] because the king doesn't broadcast the
[1:47:20] desire of his heart to everybody
[1:47:23] but there are certain people who are
[1:47:25] living close enough to David that they
[1:47:28] know what he wants done with his
[1:47:32] word there is certain men these three
[1:47:35] men something about them knew this was
[1:47:38] the desire of the king's
[1:47:41] heart and these men stood for this
[1:47:44] Renegade not when he was accepted you
[1:47:46] see brother John there was no reward in
[1:47:49] standing with David when he was King
[1:47:51] David when when everybody accepted him
[1:47:54] when everybody loved him when God had
[1:47:55] Vindicated him when God had proved him
[1:47:59] there was no Victory saying oh out I'll
[1:48:01] stand right by your side King David but
[1:48:03] there was Victory when God when when you
[1:48:05] looked at a man who was hated and
[1:48:08] despised and rejected and said I'll
[1:48:10] stand by that man amen let me tell you
[1:48:14] something friend there's only a reward
[1:48:16] and those who stand for the truth
[1:48:18] because the truth is rejected by the
[1:48:20] world but I choose to say I discern that
[1:48:24] God sent an anointed vessel in this age
[1:48:27] and though he's a renegade and though
[1:48:29] this message is hated by the world I'll
[1:48:32] take the way with the Lord's despised
[1:48:35] [Music]
[1:48:39] Feud cuz the Mighty Man discerns the
[1:48:42] anointed vessel for his age before he's
[1:48:47] publicly made
[1:48:49] known one of the marks of a mighty man
[1:48:53] and I'm going to I just I've been
[1:48:55] waiting to get to this part because it's
[1:48:56] so close to my heart one of the words of
[1:48:59] a mighty man is that he isn't
[1:49:06] Fearless I know you think that that's so
[1:49:08] strange you know I would think a mighty
[1:49:10] man you know a great mighty man of God
[1:49:13] he would be Fearless he would be so
[1:49:15] courageous a mighty man of God is Not
[1:49:18] Fearless but he faces his fear
[1:49:23] d uh David says even though I walk
[1:49:25] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:49:26] death I will fear no evil for you with
[1:49:28] me your rod and your staff they comfort
[1:49:30] me second Timothy 1 God has not given us
[1:49:32] the spirit of fear but of Power of Love
[1:49:36] of a sound of mind the Lord is my light
[1:49:37] and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the
[1:49:41] Lord is the stronghold of my life of
[1:49:43] whom shall I be afraid you see the
[1:49:46] mighty man of God depends on the words
[1:49:50] fear not can I have just about just 15
[1:49:54] more
[1:49:56] minutes sometimes a preacher preaches
[1:49:58] and he's just trying to get to something
[1:50:00] this is where I wanted to get
[1:50:03] to the mighty man of God is marked by
[1:50:06] this that he depends on these words
[1:50:09] child fear
[1:50:12] not I seen a video and just was so
[1:50:14] profound what this man put together in
[1:50:16] some of the with sayings and I and I
[1:50:19] think he had audibly and I just wrote
[1:50:20] him down most Christians listen very
[1:50:23] close I'll repeat this twice most
[1:50:25] Christians never have the luxury of
[1:50:27] hearing the words fear not because they
[1:50:31] never attempt anything great enough in
[1:50:34] life to Merit the
[1:50:38] command are you
[1:50:41] here most Christians never hear the
[1:50:44] words fear not because in their life
[1:50:48] they were satisfied with mediocris
[1:50:52] they never attempted anything in their
[1:50:55] life that challenged them to a place to
[1:50:57] where they needed to hear the words of
[1:50:58] their father don't
[1:51:05] fear most people spend their life
[1:51:08] fearing the wrong things I'm not telling
[1:51:10] you to be a man without fear but you're
[1:51:12] to fear the right things that Solomon
[1:51:14] said uh that the beginning of of the
[1:51:16] fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[1:51:18] wisdom you're to fear the right things
[1:51:21] let me say this Don't Fear the attack of
[1:51:25] Satan you say oh brother Matt that's so
[1:51:28] opposite I mean you know I'm just
[1:51:29] praying Lord oh protect me God I'm so
[1:51:31] afraid the devil's going to attack my
[1:51:33] life I'm so afraid he's going to attack
[1:51:34] my family you're fearing the wrong
[1:51:37] thing as a mighty man of God Don't Fear
[1:51:40] the attack of Satan are you ready but
[1:51:44] rather fear that you never make Satan's
[1:51:47] hit list
[1:51:52] amen I know your brain just shifted
[1:51:55] around like what did he just
[1:51:59] say Don't Fear the attack of Satan but
[1:52:02] what you should actually fear is that
[1:52:03] you live a life so
[1:52:06] small the devil don't even know who you
[1:52:08] are Matt Watkins who's that he ain't
[1:52:11] disrupting nothing I've never even heard
[1:52:12] his name you're to fear a life that you
[1:52:16] so depend upon others and you never
[1:52:19] attempt anything for the kingdom of God
[1:52:22] you're
[1:52:24] friend I'm trying to inspire somebody
[1:52:26] tonight this isn't about a message
[1:52:29] that's just filled with ministers but
[1:52:31] there's a body there's a Ley that has a
[1:52:34] position and they have a place and they
[1:52:36] have a role and God needs you in
[1:52:42] action fear that you never make the
[1:52:44] devil's Hit List Don't Fear The Unknown
[1:52:48] but rather fear that you never get to
[1:52:50] find out what's beyond the
[1:52:55] unknown don't fear a life of dark
[1:53:05] trials don't fear a life of dark trials
[1:53:09] tests but actually fear a life of
[1:53:15] complacence fear a life
[1:53:20] easy fear of life
[1:53:23] that's just
[1:53:26] normal don't fear dark tribes you know I
[1:53:29] just came through last August the
[1:53:31] darkest trial I've ever been through in
[1:53:33] my life without unparalleled to anything
[1:53:36] I've ever faced thought I'd faced dark
[1:53:37] trials till last August last August we
[1:53:40] were having special meetings at our
[1:53:42] church
[1:53:44] and we had uh Friday Saturday Sunday
[1:53:47] meetings there with brother Donnie
[1:53:48] Reagan and different ministers were
[1:53:49] coming through and and uh I in my life
[1:53:53] only 30 years old 30 years young and
[1:53:57] I've never had health issues uh blessed
[1:54:00] by Health entire family no hereditary
[1:54:02] issues of health or any major
[1:54:04] complications always could see well
[1:54:06] could smell well could feel well could
[1:54:08] hear well but on August uh right at the
[1:54:11] end of August I woke up uh Friday
[1:54:13] morning on the beginning of the meetings
[1:54:15] and something was different I felt like
[1:54:17] something was in my ear and my right ear
[1:54:20] and I and I and I I felt like maybe
[1:54:21] something was stopping up or maybe like
[1:54:23] a you know like a coat or something and
[1:54:25] uh and so it just seemed like I almost
[1:54:28] like something was clogged in there so I
[1:54:29] kept you know fill in my ear to feel if
[1:54:31] there was anything in there and it
[1:54:33] seemed like as the day went on it got
[1:54:35] worse and it all it got to the point to
[1:54:37] where if you take your hand over over
[1:54:39] your ear do that right now just take
[1:54:40] your hand over your ear and talk you can
[1:54:42] actually hear uh it sounds muffled you
[1:54:45] sound the muffling that's what it
[1:54:47] sounded like but without my hand of
[1:54:48] course and and it just felt like you
[1:54:51] know it just got worse and I told my
[1:54:52] wife I said you know I got something I
[1:54:54] don't know what it is so I'll go in and
[1:54:55] I went to the GNC and got those anybody
[1:54:57] ever took those ear
[1:54:59] candles anybody ever done that man it is
[1:55:02] amazing what can come out of your
[1:55:06] head I mean it's amazing and so I took
[1:55:09] this ear candle and man I did one and
[1:55:11] all this wax came out and I thought oh
[1:55:13] there was the problem and then I I did
[1:55:15] another one and all this wax came out I
[1:55:17] mean it was so much not to gross you out
[1:55:19] but I actually took pictures of it I
[1:55:21] just I couldn't believe it I I could not
[1:55:23] believe it I thought for sure you know
[1:55:25] that was the that was the deal well that
[1:55:27] didn't help it seemed like it just got
[1:55:29] worse went to service that night and led
[1:55:31] songs and well when I got out uh uh
[1:55:34] there at the from leading songs it I had
[1:55:37] such a such a piercing uh uh sound like
[1:55:40] a a a ring just a loud sharp ring
[1:55:44] tonius and and and and you know the the
[1:55:47] hearing just seemed like it was real
[1:55:48] muffled and and could barely hear you
[1:55:50] know and so we have two doctors for in
[1:55:52] our church and I I texted one and said
[1:55:54] can you meet me after the song service
[1:55:56] and he had is you know the thing they
[1:55:57] look at in your ear and so he sat me
[1:55:59] down in the back and he looked and he
[1:56:01] said oh it's probably something you know
[1:56:02] uh I think he said conductive or
[1:56:04] something in your ear that's actually
[1:56:06] blocking he looked and he said he said
[1:56:08] you know that's strange he said there's
[1:56:09] nothing in there said your ear just as
[1:56:10] clean as a whistle he said um he said
[1:56:13] you know um he said I don't know uh
[1:56:16] that's from that ear
[1:56:19] candle he said you know there's nothing
[1:56:21] in there any he said um he said can you
[1:56:24] can you hear this and he took his he
[1:56:25] took his finger and he went like that
[1:56:27] and just rubbed it together and if you
[1:56:29] do that right beside your ear you could
[1:56:30] hear it and he said can you hear that I
[1:56:32] said yeah I can I can hear it but it's
[1:56:33] muffled said okay he said I don't know
[1:56:35] what it is he said but I'm going to put
[1:56:36] you on steroids and on uh three or four
[1:56:39] different decongestive things and he
[1:56:40] said just on Monday go see the ENT and
[1:56:43] and I'm sure you'll be fun well Saturday
[1:56:46] uh I woke up and it was worse um
[1:56:49] Saturday night after the song service
[1:56:51] when I got got done all I heard in my
[1:56:53] ear was a loud ring I went totally deaf
[1:56:56] couldn't hear nothing just couldn't
[1:56:58] could do this and couldn't hear nothing
[1:56:59] I could take my finger and stick it in
[1:57:00] my ear and you could hear your finger I
[1:57:02] couldn't hear nothing like it was like I
[1:57:03] was almost numb and so I you know I
[1:57:06] begin to just um worry and that night um
[1:57:11] at about 3:00 in the morning or so
[1:57:12] whatever time it was woke up to use the
[1:57:15] restroom and when I got out of out of
[1:57:17] bed I literally put a foot on the floor
[1:57:20] and the next thing I know I I thought I
[1:57:22] hit a wall because I just came to an
[1:57:24] instant stop and I realized I was on the
[1:57:26] floor and I looked up and I could see in
[1:57:29] the dark there in the ciling fan and the
[1:57:31] entire world was just moving just as
[1:57:33] fast as it could and I I tried to think
[1:57:36] man what is happening I tried to stand
[1:57:38] up and when I stood up I would fall back
[1:57:40] over on on the floor and I was just
[1:57:42] rolling around started to becoming
[1:57:44] fearful I thought I was I be honest I
[1:57:46] thought I was passing away I have some
[1:57:48] heart attack or something this is what
[1:57:50] it feels like and I almost screamed out
[1:57:52] to my wife to yell out but then I I
[1:57:55] realized it's dizziness it's vertigo and
[1:57:58] so I I crawled and I crawled to my
[1:58:01] living room and I crawled up on the
[1:58:02] couch and as I was looking everything
[1:58:04] was just spinning around and spinning
[1:58:06] around and I just would close my eyes
[1:58:08] and I'd open it and still be spinning
[1:58:09] around listen friend if you've never
[1:58:11] experienced that I promise you have no
[1:58:15] idea no idea you could only imagine what
[1:58:18] what it's like this extreme vertigo it's
[1:58:20] just like the feeling when if you ever
[1:58:21] been spunner around and spun around and
[1:58:23] when you first stop you the world is
[1:58:25] going like this it's that same exact
[1:58:26] feeling but it never gets straight again
[1:58:30] and I began to get nauseous like seasick
[1:58:32] and and and vomit like I was on a boat
[1:58:35] because everything was just moving and
[1:58:36] rolling around and my I just laid there
[1:58:39] for hours finally fell back to sleep
[1:58:41] thinking you know you sometimes you
[1:58:42] think you wake up and feel better woke
[1:58:44] up and it was just as bad my wife walks
[1:58:47] in and I said I've got to tell you
[1:58:48] something something's different I don't
[1:58:49] know what's happened I don't know if I
[1:58:51] need to go to the ER so I called the
[1:58:52] doctor he said that's vertigo you know
[1:58:55] um there's nothing really you can do
[1:58:56] about it so anyway it got worse and and
[1:58:59] and and actually on Sunday morning
[1:59:01] service I uh my wife drove and I
[1:59:03] couldn't drive of course and and I just
[1:59:06] uh was helped into the the sound booth
[1:59:09] and I laid down on the back floor
[1:59:10] because that's all I could do just to be
[1:59:12] part of the service no one knew about it
[1:59:14] from my family my dad and mom they had
[1:59:16] prayer for me brother Donnie had prayer
[1:59:17] for me seemed like you know that the
[1:59:19] devil was just so fighting and and and
[1:59:22] it and it just seemed like it would it
[1:59:24] was getting worse and I can't even
[1:59:25] explain to you how I'm not doing this to
[1:59:27] have pity by no means I know people have
[1:59:29] have had a lot worse than that but uh
[1:59:32] but it just got worse and then by that
[1:59:34] night I had totally lost my balance and
[1:59:36] there I don't know how to explain that
[1:59:38] to you other than I lost my balance and
[1:59:41] you know it's amazing the things you
[1:59:42] take for granted in your life that work
[1:59:44] on autopilot and you don't even think
[1:59:47] about taking a step and and it working
[1:59:49] but when you lose that and you and and
[1:59:51] you and you stand somewhere and you fall
[1:59:53] from one side to the other and you can't
[1:59:55] stay upright it's very
[1:59:57] scary and so you know the night wore on
[2:00:01] and and and and we did a my wife did a
[2:00:04] maneuver called the hallpike maneuver
[2:00:05] that can help with vertigo and you take
[2:00:07] your head and lean yourself back and you
[2:00:09] look at an object and when she did that
[2:00:12] and she laid my head back and I looked
[2:00:14] at our piano she jumped backwards and
[2:00:16] she said are you doing that on purpose
[2:00:19] and I said doing what she said you don't
[2:00:21] know what you're doing and I said no she
[2:00:22] said it looks like you're having a
[2:00:24] seizure I said I'm not having a seizure
[2:00:26] she said your eyes are going like this
[2:00:27] just as fast she said I can't even make
[2:00:29] them out they're just
[2:00:31] moving that's where the vertigo comes
[2:00:33] from everything's
[2:00:34] moving so the next Monday I uh that
[2:00:37] Monday I went to the uh the ear nose and
[2:00:40] throat doctor and and just got helped in
[2:00:42] and he took me to the back and they did
[2:00:44] a hearing test anybody that's ever done
[2:00:45] a hearing test will be familiar with
[2:00:47] this but they take you into a soundproof
[2:00:49] room and the audiologist uh is in the
[2:00:52] the back and he's he's in the room and
[2:00:53] he speaks to you audibly and and they
[2:00:56] put on these almost like earbuds uh very
[2:00:58] different but like earbuds in your ears
[2:01:00] and they give you a clicker and they
[2:01:01] give
[2:01:02] frequencies of sound like a uh like
[2:01:09] w you click every time you hear the
[2:01:11] sound the frequency goes higher and it
[2:01:13] goes less and lower and lower so my left
[2:01:15] ear man I'm just click click click click
[2:01:17] click click click click he says okay I'm
[2:01:18] going to say 20 words in your left ear
[2:01:19] repeat what I say I said more 20 for 20
[2:01:22] said okay Mr Ro I'm going to test your
[2:01:23] right ear and click when you hear a
[2:01:27] noise no clicker couldn't hear nothing
[2:01:30] not one he comes back on and he says uh
[2:01:33] Mr Watkins said I'm GNA say 20 words if
[2:01:35] you can say anything even if you think
[2:01:37] you hear what I'm saying I never heard
[2:01:38] nothing I almost thought the machine
[2:01:40] wasn't working and so he comes in and he
[2:01:42] opens the door he says um he says the
[2:01:45] doctor will see you just in room three
[2:01:46] so I went in there all the doctor comes
[2:01:49] in and he says well I have good news and
[2:01:51] bad news he said um the bad news is is
[2:01:54] that you have sudden sensored neuro
[2:01:56] hearing lws affects 5,000 humans in the
[2:01:59] uh United States of America and he said
[2:02:01] um it is an uh idiopathic which
[2:02:05] medically speaking that means that they
[2:02:07] don't have an explanation it just
[2:02:10] happens they don't they can't explain it
[2:02:12] they think he said what we believe is
[2:02:14] you have an audio nerve that goes from
[2:02:15] your brain to your ear and he said and
[2:02:19] that nerve sits in a bone and he said in
[2:02:21] a virus attacks the nerve and the nerve
[2:02:23] swells because it's in a bone it dies
[2:02:26] nerves don't regenerate you're deaf in
[2:02:28] your right ear you'll never hear again
[2:02:30] and he said um he said you have what's
[2:02:33] called we have we have bad hearing loss
[2:02:35] we have devastating hearing loss then we
[2:02:37] have profound hearing loss and he said
[2:02:39] then we have just no hearing at all he
[2:02:41] said your decimal chart on my left ear
[2:02:43] was very good the right ear was just a
[2:02:45] flatline he said you're deaf and he said
[2:02:48] and it's incurable there's no remedy
[2:02:51] there's no surgery no amount of money he
[2:02:53] said uh there's nothing we could do he
[2:02:54] said he said it's a it's a virus nerves
[2:02:56] don't regenerate he
[2:02:58] said um you know he said there's he said
[2:03:01] the good news is that people live can
[2:03:02] live mostly a normal life with a
[2:03:04] bilateral hearing which was hearing on
[2:03:06] one ear he said a hearing aid wouldn't
[2:03:08] do you any good hearing aids only
[2:03:09] amplify bad sound you don't have any
[2:03:11] sound and he said for some reason uh
[2:03:13] we've had studies and tests and he said
[2:03:16] he said when a person has vertigo and
[2:03:18] they have worse than 60 60 I think it's
[2:03:20] 60 decimal you could Google gole this
[2:03:22] it's all over the I had already Googled
[2:03:23] a lot of this before I went and he said
[2:03:26] when it's worse than 60 decimals and
[2:03:27] there's vertigo he said the recovery is
[2:03:30] zero we don't have a statistic he said
[2:03:33] sometimes when you have maybe 40%
[2:03:34] hearing loss you can through steroids
[2:03:36] and a trial of steroids he said you
[2:03:37] could over you know a few weeks you can
[2:03:39] get some hearing back he said nothing we
[2:03:42] could do he said we could put you on a
[2:03:44] trial of steroids you know just to do it
[2:03:46] he said and then you'll come back in 3
[2:03:47] weeks and basically that'll be for us to
[2:03:50] tell you there's nothing else we can do
[2:03:52] for you we release you as a patient
[2:03:53] makes us not liable blah blah blah and
[2:03:56] you know uh he said you know so we're
[2:03:57] going to do
[2:03:59] that I was devastated can I speak honest
[2:04:03] can I be
[2:04:05] transparent I was real low as low as I
[2:04:08] can get anybody that studies
[2:04:10] personalities I'm a very uh optimistic
[2:04:13] person a popular sangin and and very
[2:04:16] upbeat takes a lot to get me down and I
[2:04:19] remember laying there on my couch and
[2:04:20] the vertigo he said the ver vertigo
[2:04:22] would go will go away he said you may
[2:04:24] have to do Rehabilitation for your
[2:04:26] balance and to learn how to basically
[2:04:27] walk again and walk correctly he said
[2:04:30] that'll go away he said but everything
[2:04:32] in Balance happens in the ear it's
[2:04:33] amazing what you hear is what gives you
[2:04:36] balance and he says that he says that um
[2:04:40] you know that that you know we'll see
[2:04:41] you again in three weeks so I go home
[2:04:43] and you know I was laying there on my
[2:04:44] couch and just that's about all I could
[2:04:46] do was confine just totally
[2:04:48] debilitating and I was praying and
[2:04:51] praying just asking the Lord you know
[2:04:52] not understanding you know you you
[2:04:54] sometimes go through these things and
[2:04:56] you just don't understand say you know
[2:04:58] life was so normal and life changes just
[2:05:02] like that wow it's amazing how quickly
[2:05:04] you just take something for granted and
[2:05:06] you know the devil starts attacking your
[2:05:07] mind and you'll never hear your kids'
[2:05:09] voices again correctly and how you
[2:05:11] should hear them and you know you'll be
[2:05:13] this that and the other and he told me
[2:05:14] he said socially your life is going to
[2:05:16] be be worse and I knew that that was
[2:05:18] true we went to a men's meeting there
[2:05:20] and brother Barry had there in Tennessee
[2:05:22] and I hated going to the cafeteria
[2:05:25] because I couldn't hear anything when I
[2:05:26] got when I was oneon-one I could hear
[2:05:28] but when I got into a room with a lot of
[2:05:29] people people would talk to me and and
[2:05:32] the other thing is that you lose is you
[2:05:33] lose sound localization you only
[2:05:35] localize sound in other words if you
[2:05:37] hear something a phone would ring two
[2:05:39] ears is required to know where that's
[2:05:40] coming from so my phone would ring and
[2:05:42] my wife would have to tell me go get it
[2:05:44] she would tell me where it's at and CU I
[2:05:46] didn't know I would walk walk in and I
[2:05:48] would call for my wife and she'd say
[2:05:50] she'd have to tell me she learned
[2:05:51] learned to say I'm in the girls' room
[2:05:53] because for me it sounded like she was
[2:05:54] here in the in the bathroom in the
[2:05:56] kitchen in the dining room I couldn't
[2:05:57] tell where anything was coming from I
[2:05:59] sat down on the table with six brothers
[2:06:00] and a brother said Hey Brother Matt and
[2:06:02] I literally went like
[2:06:03] this and I looked at every single one
[2:06:05] till I found the person looking at me I
[2:06:07] said hi did you say hi he said yeah okay
[2:06:09] because I didn't know honestly who said
[2:06:11] it and uh and it was so just so
[2:06:14] depressing and and I laid there on my
[2:06:17] couch and I remember I was just praying
[2:06:19] and and asking the Lord have read some
[2:06:20] you know uh some things brother brandom
[2:06:22] had a healing thoughts book and just
[2:06:24] some things I was reading and read some
[2:06:25] little devotional from Spurgeon and and
[2:06:27] you know and a brother had called me and
[2:06:29] I I don't want to be too much long is
[2:06:30] this okay just a few
[2:06:33] minutes so I I I was laying there and I
[2:06:36] do one thing I do on the side is I help
[2:06:38] churches when and not just churches but
[2:06:40] different businesses do Media Solutions
[2:06:42] so I'll go in and set up the live stream
[2:06:44] and video cameras and different things
[2:06:46] so I did this for a church and uh and
[2:06:48] the church had called me the brother
[2:06:49] called me I wasn't there in church being
[2:06:51] Wednesday night I was home and uh and he
[2:06:54] said brother mat he said you know he
[2:06:55] said can you get on and look at our
[2:06:56] stream make sure everything looks good
[2:06:58] if there's any suggestions for
[2:06:59] adjustment so I said sure I could do
[2:07:00] that I was laying there on my couch and
[2:07:03] and as soon as I tuned in the pastor uh
[2:07:05] was up there and the pastor right when I
[2:07:07] tune in the first words out of his mouth
[2:07:09] he says well you all know brother Bill
[2:07:11] here at the church so he's a very quiet
[2:07:14] brother and assuming he doesn't Minister
[2:07:16] he doesn't speak he said you know and he
[2:07:17] and he he just comes and he goes and he
[2:07:19] says but the Lord has used him and you
[2:07:20] know that this church knows how the Lord
[2:07:22] has used him and given him something uh
[2:07:24] from the Lord a message from the Lord
[2:07:26] and it'll be for somebody in a specific
[2:07:27] situation and he said and and you know
[2:07:30] we've seen that happen he said brother
[2:07:31] Bill approached me three months ago and
[2:07:33] he gave me just a little sticky a
[2:07:34] notepad and he said it had a message on
[2:07:36] it so I took that message back and I
[2:07:38] read it and I thought well Lord you know
[2:07:41] thank you for whatever that is and what
[2:07:42] it's for and he said I just put on my
[2:07:44] back office and he said I just committed
[2:07:46] it to the Lord he said well brother bill
[2:07:47] came to me tonight and said brother I
[2:07:50] don't want to offend you but that note
[2:07:53] was not for you the Lord told me tonight
[2:07:56] that note's for somebody else they may
[2:07:59] not even go to this church but you must
[2:08:01] read it
[2:08:04] tonight my one ear was
[2:08:10] listening I was tuned
[2:08:14] in and and he said so I'm going to read
[2:08:17] it he said for whoever use for he said
[2:08:18] I'm going to read it then we're going to
[2:08:19] go to our scripture we'll leave it at
[2:08:20] that' this is what the note says when
[2:08:23] you don't understand what's happening
[2:08:25] and you can't control it don't fear
[2:08:28] don't move don't be Hasty just be still
[2:08:32] and wait on the Lord he's
[2:08:37] moving and you know you hear things like
[2:08:39] that but something about it spoke
[2:08:42] directly to my soul I begin to weep and
[2:08:45] cry and and just cry and just think Lord
[2:08:48] thank you that I feel like that message
[2:08:50] was so for me yeah and my wife you know
[2:08:53] I called her and I called her crying and
[2:08:54] tell her and she said well you know
[2:08:55] what's wrong I said no I said I'm having
[2:08:57] Joy I said that it was just accident you
[2:08:59] know I happen stance I don't believe it
[2:09:01] was it was the Lord and I and I happened

[2:11:40] and the man the a all just came back on
[2:11:42] he said that's amazing he said Mr
[2:11:44] Watkins you heard some of those noises
[2:11:45] you didn't hear them all it's not as
[2:11:47] good as your left ear he said but but
[2:11:48] it's incredible he said I want to try
[2:11:50] something I'm going to coming loud he
[2:11:52] said but I want to try I'm going to
[2:11:54] speak those 20 words it's called your
[2:11:55] discrim your your ability to
[2:11:57] discriminate a sound from a word he said
[2:11:59] what people don't understand is that you
[2:12:01] have tiny little bitty hairs not the
[2:12:02] hairs you see but inside your inner your
[2:12:04] middle ear he said you have tiny little
[2:12:06] hair follicles that are microscopic
[2:12:08] sound waves actually pass over those
[2:12:10] hairs and they vibrate send vibrations
[2:12:12] to the brain and that's what turns sound
[2:12:14] a whoosing of noise into discernable a
[2:12:17] bird a person speaking a sound of a car
[2:12:20] and he's said when this happens to
[2:12:22] people those hairs die he said so even
[2:12:24] when people get noise back he said I
[2:12:25] want to make sure you can discriminate
[2:12:27] words I said okay he said I'm going to
[2:12:29] say 20 he said if you can hear anything
[2:12:31] even if it sounds like you you hear a
[2:12:33] word and it may not be correct say
[2:12:34] whatever you think it is he said 20 I
[2:12:36] got
[2:12:40] 18
[2:12:43] hallelujah praise the
[2:12:46] Lord my God is
[2:12:49] awesome he can and move
[2:12:53] Mountain keep me in the
[2:12:56] valley hide me from the rain you know
[2:13:00] what
[2:13:01] happened I go from that and and and I go
[2:13:05] back into the doctor he said the
[2:13:06] doctor's going to be excited he's going
[2:13:07] to want to see this I go to the doctor
[2:13:09] he walks in he says well you proved me
[2:13:11] wrong he said amazing he said now Mr
[2:13:14] Watkins he said I'm going to be honest
[2:13:16] with you he said your hearing is not
[2:13:17] great he said it's it's better than it
[2:13:20] was he said in fact if we were to put a
[2:13:22] hearing aid in your ear you'd have
[2:13:23] perfectly normal hearing like anybody
[2:13:25] else he said it's it's amazing he didn't
[2:13:27] call it a miracle of course being a
[2:13:28] doctor uh he he just said he said it's
[2:13:31] amazing he said he said it's quite
[2:13:33] amazing he said that you know these
[2:13:34] things don't regenerate he said somehow
[2:13:36] you have some hearing back he said you
[2:13:37] have about 40 decimals back which sounds
[2:13:40] like a lot but it wasn't that great
[2:13:42] through the grace of God through since
[2:13:44] that visit my hearing's gotten better
[2:13:46] and better better and better amen to God
[2:13:51] is God's
[2:13:53] awesome and today I I still have a very
[2:13:56] slight tontis ring that I live with at
[2:13:58] all times I believe God who started a
[2:14:00] work can finish what he started and I
[2:14:04] don't have I don't have perfect hearing
[2:14:06] so if you've said something to me over
[2:14:07] this weekend in my right and I didn't
[2:14:09] respond it was simply because that I
[2:14:10] it's hard for me to hear a whisper still
[2:14:12] on this side but I can hear and I'm so
[2:14:16] thankful it it it it it it it calls me
[2:14:19] to come to this place in my life as I
[2:14:21] close I'll close on this that you're not
[2:14:23] to fear a life of dark
[2:14:27] trials and let me say this so many times
[2:14:30] we because we believe in a rapture we
[2:14:33] believe in a body change but sometimes
[2:14:35] if we're not careful we disconnect from
[2:14:38] this life's
[2:14:40] reality don't fear dark trials don't
[2:14:44] fear tribulation don't feel sorrow you
[2:14:47] know why and I hope this doesn't disturb
[2:14:49] you it's only a matter of time before it
[2:14:52] comes your
[2:14:55] way I know that's a stark reality but
[2:14:58] that's life Jesus said in this world you
[2:15:02] will have
[2:15:03] tribulation but fear not amen I overcame
[2:15:07] the world I overcame this world
[2:15:11] Hallelujah don't fear a life of dark
[2:15:13] trials and tests because it's only a
[2:15:15] matter of time before they come
[2:15:21] a mighty man of God doesn't spend his
[2:15:23] life fearing the wrong things but he
[2:15:25] fears the right things he doesn't fear a
[2:15:28] life of dark trials and tests but
[2:15:31] actually he fears a life of ease and
[2:15:35] complacency and spiritual
[2:15:40] laziness one of my greatest fears in
[2:15:43] life and I'll say this as we're closing
[2:15:45] one of my greatest fear in life as I
[2:15:47] thought on this and I begin to think of
[2:15:51] the Gospel that we have and the truth
[2:15:53] that we
[2:15:54] have and let me say this friend as
[2:15:57] brother bam said and I'll repeat it this
[2:15:59] is a bloody gospel it
[2:16:02] is there have been lives whove literally
[2:16:05] stood and gave their entire life for
[2:16:08] this
[2:16:08] Truth for this truth that we have there
[2:16:11] have been people burned at Stakes there
[2:16:13] have been people ran over there have
[2:16:15] been people torn asunder there have been
[2:16:18] people torn apart the Bible says torn
[2:16:20] asunder of whom the world is not
[2:16:25] worthy when I begin to think about this
[2:16:27] that there have been people who have
[2:16:29] literally given as the prophet said some
[2:16:31] will be given a crown on that day
[2:16:33] because they have given their lives but
[2:16:35] some will be given a crown because they
[2:16:37] have striven for everything in their
[2:16:39] life I don't want my life to be named as
[2:16:41] a life who sat on the sideline and
[2:16:44] watched everything go by but I want to
[2:16:46] say Lord let me strive let me press let
[2:16:49] me run this race with patience that
[2:16:52] you've set before me don't let me be a
[2:16:54] complainer and a grumbler and a mumbler
[2:16:57] and oh Lord why does this happen and why
[2:16:59] does that happen let me say like job
[2:17:02] though you slay me yet I'll serve you oh
[2:17:05] you're better than life oh
[2:17:09] Lord there have been people who have
[2:17:12] literally been burning a steak for this
[2:17:14] gospel deny Christ or I'll take your
[2:17:17] child I'll take your husband I'll take
[2:17:19] everything you have and I'll burn it
[2:17:21] down with you inside of
[2:17:23] it you say brother matth that sounds so
[2:17:26] harsh that was a reality for your
[2:17:28] brothers and your
[2:17:31] sisters and my greatest fear in life my
[2:17:34] greatest fear in life is that I run my
[2:17:37] entire race and I come before that day
[2:17:40] and those people and I hear the story of
[2:17:42] Jon of Arc and I hear the story of
[2:17:45] polycarp and I hear the story of these
[2:17:48] Martyrs of the faith who stood the test
[2:17:50] of time and who stood their trial of
[2:17:53] death there Gethsemane what I'm afraid
[2:17:55] we in the message fail to realize is
[2:17:57] that every age came through a Gethsemane
[2:18:00] yes there had to be every age had to
[2:18:02] come through the pressing of the olives
[2:18:04] every age had to come through their
[2:18:06] trials and we say oh I'm so glad I
[2:18:09] didn't live in that age of Jon of Arc
[2:18:10] and of polycarp and of all these Martyrs
[2:18:13] I'm so glad I didn't have to give my
[2:18:14] life what you fail to realize is that
[2:18:17] the spirit that attacked them is a
[2:18:19] Confluence and a mixing of all those
[2:18:21] Spirits together that are in this age to
[2:18:24] attack you and the only way they
[2:18:27] overcame was not by human ability but
[2:18:30] because God released an anointing for
[2:18:32] the believer that met the challenge of
[2:18:35] their day let me tell you friend this
[2:18:37] word is enough to meet the challenge of
[2:18:40] the
[2:18:40] [Applause]
[2:18:43] devil
[2:18:44] hallu every age had their Gethsemane and
[2:18:47] every gay age had their dying out and we
[2:18:51] think somehow we've slipped and missed
[2:18:53] ours and then somehow we'll be spared
[2:18:56] and we'll just live lives and live happy
[2:18:57] and get rich and you know get everything
[2:18:59] and be raptured and all live happily
[2:19:01] ever
[2:19:03] after my greatest fear friend is to
[2:19:05] stand before
[2:19:07] polycarp to stand before those Martyrs
[2:19:10] and they tell me their
[2:19:12] story and then they look at
[2:19:15] me and they say what do you do
[2:19:21] tell me your
[2:19:22] story what did you
[2:19:26] overcome my greatest fear is that I'll
[2:19:28] have to look them in the eye and think
[2:19:30] over my life and think really what have
[2:19:33] I done all I've done is Grumble and
[2:19:36] complain and argue with my brother and
[2:19:38] my sister and fight and fuss complain
[2:19:41] about bills and complain about little
[2:19:43] things that don't mean I have any value
[2:19:45] at
[2:19:47] all oh life seems so small sometimes
[2:19:52] my greatest fear is that I have to that
[2:19:54] my entire life has been crowned as the
[2:19:56] prophet said with a crabby Spirit upset
[2:19:58] and and mad about everything and fly off
[2:20:00] the handle over everything oh friend it
[2:20:02] ought to shake us tonight God has not
[2:20:05] called us to be normal God is looking
[2:20:07] for a unique class of people that will
[2:20:10] be to say I'm not as satisfied to be the
[2:20:13] top 30 something inside of me says I am
[2:20:16] an elected family member of
[2:20:18] God and I want to press towards the Mark
[2:20:21] of the High
[2:20:22] Calling oh I have heard of Christians
[2:20:24] long ago they were brought before a
[2:20:27] tyrant's throne they were told that he
[2:20:29] would spare their life if they would
[2:20:31] just renounce that wonderful name of
[2:20:34] Christ but one by
[2:20:39] one they chose to
[2:20:42] die That Wonderful Name of Christ they
[2:20:47] would not
[2:20:49] deny and like like a great Angelic choir
[2:20:52] sing can you almost hear it friend can
[2:20:55] you almost hear their voices ring I
[2:20:58] pledge allegiance to the

[2:21:04] strength with
[2:21:06] all that I am I will seek to honor his
[2:21:12] command I pledge
[2:21:14] allegiance to the lamb I refuse to Live

[2:21:27] refuse to live a defeated life and
[2:21:30] carnality I refuse and I say God make me
[2:21:34] an overcomer that is granted to sit with
[2:21:36] you on your
[2:21:37] throne let me face my giant let me face
[2:21:41] my
[2:21:42] lion give me my Mountain as Caleb
[2:21:46] said not what God did for somebody else
[2:21:49] in another age or another time but let
[2:21:51] me stand before those Martyrs and say by
[2:21:55] his grace by his
[2:21:59] Mercy I made
[2:22:04] it oh Lord

[2:22:13] Lord father as I think of
[2:22:16] this those men and those precious women
[2:22:21] those precious sisters and brothers
[2:22:24] elected family of God who sealed their
[2:22:27] life with their own
[2:22:29] testimony who chose they didn't it
[2:22:32] wasn't forced upon them but they made a
[2:22:35] choice they made a conscious choice to
[2:22:38] say I'm not going to be like everybody
[2:22:41] else I've been ordained by a Divine
[2:22:45] Purpose I have been ordained by a Divine

[2:23:47] women I believe you're stirring a
[2:23:49] generation of men and women Lord who
[2:23:51] look at these things in the world in the
[2:23:53] word and they say that's my
[2:23:55] identification that's who I am that is
[2:23:58] my identity that is my DNA that is my
[2:24:02] life and Lord I want to surrender my
[2:24:05] life just now I want to raise my hands
[2:24:08] and surrender and say if you can use

[2:24:56] don't let me be found when you've given
[2:24:58] me so much don't let me be found
[2:25:01] satisfied and
[2:25:03] content to be an absorber of the word
[2:25:06] but to be a doer not to be satisfied
[2:25:09] with 30 fold or 60 fold but I want to
[2:25:12] produce the fruit of aund fold in my
[2:25:16] life oh yes
[2:25:18] Lord oh Lord Lord don't let me stand
[2:25:21] that
[2:25:23] day my greatest fear Lord to stand that
[2:25:26] day amongst those believers who came
[2:25:29] through so much even our own Prophet
[2:25:31] life was given life was rejected by his
[2:25:34] entire family as the devil began to tell
[2:25:36] him you've given your entire life to
[2:25:37] this thing Lord he gave so much how much
[2:25:40] more we oh God to give ourselves every
[2:25:42] day as a Living
[2:25:46] Sacrifice don't let me stand that day
[2:25:48] Lord and have to fumble around my words
[2:25:52] to give a
[2:25:53] testimony but I believe you're calling
[2:25:55] Overcomers Lord you've made me realize a
[2:25:58] long time ago there won't be any
[2:26:00] survivors out of Lady OA there won't be
[2:26:02] any survivors who make it we asked the
[2:26:04] question is anyone going to survive the
[2:26:06] storm no no one will there will only be
[2:26:09] Overcomers there will only be people who
[2:26:11] have a determination in their heart to
[2:26:13] say I am a mighty man I'm a mighty woman
[2:26:17] and God has given me this ability to not
[2:26:19] live based upon my past to not build up
[2:26:23] a life based on past failures but to
[2:26:25] build a life based on past victories to
[2:26:28] say I'm going to do this one thing I'm
[2:26:30] going to forget what happened yesterday
[2:26:33] because his Mercy is new every single
[2:26:36] morning I'm going to forget those things
[2:26:39] in the past and I'm going to press
[2:26:40] towards the mark of the High
[2:26:44] Calling
[2:26:46] Christ I have heard how Christian
[2:26:52] long
[2:26:54] ago they were brought
[2:26:57] before a tyrant's
[2:27:01] throne they were
[2:27:03] told that he would
[2:27:06] spare their Liv if they would
[2:27:12] renounce the name of Christ oh but one
[2:27:17] by one they chose CH to
[2:27:22] Die the name of Christ they would not
[2:27:28] deny like a great oh
[2:27:32] Angelic
[2:27:33] choir
