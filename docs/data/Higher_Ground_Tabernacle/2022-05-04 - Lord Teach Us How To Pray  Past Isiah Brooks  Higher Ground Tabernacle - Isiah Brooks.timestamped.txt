[0:00] kind of like the same setup the catholic
[0:02] church is you know pentons and paying
[0:04] for you know uh uh dolanses and all of
[0:08] those kind of things and remember by
[0:10] god's grace all of these things did come
[0:12] by way of babylon
[0:15] when israel when jesus and i'm skipping
[0:17] now but when jesus came uh to israel
[0:20] they were in such a mess
[0:23] in their way of worship
[0:26] uh so much so that when jesus came into
[0:29] the temple
[0:30] he whipped them out of the temple and he
[0:33] scold them
[0:35] and said
[0:36] my house
[0:38] is not for a house
[0:40] or a den of thieves
[0:43] but my house should be called
[0:45] the house of prayer
[0:48] and so here we go to that word again
[0:50] prayer
[0:51] what does it mean
[0:53] prayer is just really a communion
[0:56] and it's not like we think it is and we
[1:00] definitely worked in those areas where
[1:02] we think prayer is god give me this give
[1:04] me that
[1:06] lord i need this i mean he's not your
[1:08] aaron boy he's god
[1:11] many times because of our approach
[1:14] because of the way we you know the
[1:16] protocol however you want to say it we
[1:18] approach a king
[1:20] with as if god
[1:23] owes us
[1:24] stuff god don't owe us anything
[1:28] but we'll come to him as though he owed
[1:32] us
[1:33] how often we
[1:35] talk to god in fellowship with him
[1:41] he's something we know he's available
[1:44] because he's jehovah gyra
[1:48] wrong approach
[1:50] the
[1:52] kingdom of god and its righteousness
[1:56] and all of these things these other
[1:58] things will be added
[2:00] but we want god to add before the
[2:02] kingdom
[2:03] which is more important
[2:06] the kingdom that's right
[2:09] let thy kingdom come
[2:12] thy will be done
[2:15] right
[2:16] so and when we come to a place
[2:20] where our lives are so intertwined with
[2:24] god
[2:27] because what we've done
[2:29] we make church an idol
[2:32] we sometimes make jesus or not jesus a
[2:35] idol
[2:37] and that's not what he is he's
[2:40] this is to the believer an outstanding
[2:43] thing
[2:44] before the father there was no such
[2:46] thing as prayer
[2:49] they say lord i pray you're going to
[2:50] stop by today
[2:52] no
[2:53] the bible said and he walked in the cool
[2:55] of the evening god did
[2:57] his visitation was on a daily basis
[3:01] and we know by god's grace as far as we
[3:04] understand
[3:05] amen that this communion with god it
[3:07] doesn't even tell us
[3:09] what they talked about
[3:12] but one thing for certain
[3:14] it was like heaven on earth that's right
[3:17] amen
[3:19] it was a complete communion with elohim
[3:21] himself
[3:23] adam both male and female was engulfed
[3:27] in the love of god
[3:29] and they were clothed with his glory
[3:32] prayer came into play when men began to
[3:35] drift away from the presence of god
[3:41] they were one
