[48:18] love

[48:28] [Music]
[48:33] [Music]
[48:38] oh
[48:40] [Music]

[49:08] mercy seat
[49:11] showers are great

[51:01] [Music]

[52:57] who would me
[53:02] [Music]
[53:11] hallelujah
[53:13] [Applause]
[53:15] it's been a year since i saw that song
[53:17] but i found it
[53:20] in some of my papers and i thought well
[53:22] i'm going to sing that song
[53:23] amen
[53:25] can't do it in justice when it comes to
[53:27] our brother randy's
[53:29] one of those songs he wrote he saying it
[53:32] really well
[53:34] as we stand that has turned amen to
[53:36] ephesians the first chapter
[53:39] we thank the musicians for playing for
[53:41] us
[53:42] i thought we had
[53:44] a new position tonight i
[53:47] heard a play that i hadn't heard before
[53:50] when he wasn't here
[53:57] we appreciate you and we appreciate
[53:59] everyone here tonight
[54:02] i don't know about
[54:04] you and how you're dealing with
[54:05] circumstances
[54:08] uh we all have a thing that comes up in
[54:10] our lives
[54:12] and i know that brother samuel had no
[54:14] idea what i was going to be preaching on
[54:17] uh but all of the songs in which he sang
[54:19] was very appropriate and very in line
[54:23] the very thought that god
[54:25] has for me to
[54:27] preach tonight
[54:29] um this has been a real battle in my
[54:31] mind
[54:32] things today because all of us
[54:37] and desired
[54:38] you know we fail to see that our
[54:40] perfectionism of christ is not our home
[54:43] in all of our struggling we must
[54:45] understand that we must in order for the
[54:48] token for before in order for the blood
[54:51] of jesus christ to be able to must
[54:53] accept
[54:54] and often times we find ourselves
[54:57] not accepting
[54:59] what god does we don't willfully do it
[55:02] but we do it
[55:04] still god's mercy
[55:06] but let us read ephesians one
[55:09] we're going to read the second and the
[55:11] third verse
[55:12] grace be to you and peace from god our
[55:15] father
[55:16] and
[55:17] from the lord jesus christ blessed be
[55:21] the god and father of our lord jesus
[55:23] christ
[55:24] who have blessed us i really want you to
[55:27] hear that
[55:28] who have blessed us
[55:30] with all spiritual blessings
[55:32] in heavenly places
[55:35] in christ
[55:36] according as he had chosen us in him
[55:40] before the foundation
[55:42] of the world that we should be holy
[55:44] without blame
[55:46] before him
[55:57] 8.
[56:14] are you there
[56:18] we're going to be getting a meeting at
[56:20] the
[56:23] 30th verse of the chapter
[56:28] and it reads
[56:30] and philip ran thither to him
[56:34] and heard him read
[56:36] the prophet isaiah's
[56:38] and said
[56:40] understand this thou what thou
[56:42] readeth
[56:44] and he said how can i accept some man
[56:47] should guide me
[56:50] and he desired philip that he would come
[56:53] up
[56:54] and sit with him
[56:57] the place of the scripture which he read
[56:59] was this
[57:02] he was led as a sheep to the slaughter
[57:06] and like a lamb dumb before the shearer
[57:09] so o open he not his mouth
[57:13] and in his humiliation his judgment was
[57:15] taken away
[57:17] and who shall declare his generation
[57:21] for his life is taken from the earth
[57:25] and the eno eunich uh answered philip
[57:28] and said i pray thee of whom speaketh
[57:30] this prophet this
[57:32] of himself or some other man
[57:36] then philip opened his mouth and began
[57:39] the same scripture and preached
[57:42] unto him
[57:44] jesus
[57:45] let us pray
[57:47] heavenly father we thank you
[57:50] for your amazing grace
[57:52] we thank you for being so good to us
[57:55] father you have been better to us than
[57:57] we have
[57:58] been to ourselves
[58:01] in this day and time we so thank you
[58:03] lord for all
[58:04] that you have done for us
[58:06] and the accomplishment that you have
[58:09] done through
[58:10] your dear son jesus christ is
[58:13] still a wonder to us all
[58:16] that through the blood of an innocent
[58:17] lamb
[58:18] you brought the cure
[58:20] to mankind and we thank you father and
[58:23] we accept
[58:25] the blood of jesus christ
[58:27] as our saving grace
[58:29] and we pray father god that you bless
[58:31] each and every heart here tonight
[58:34] that we may see god and see the grace of
[58:36] god in a different way
[58:39] that we will leave this place tonight
[58:41] amen
[58:42] with faith and not fear yes
[58:45] help us now lord god you know our makeup
[58:48] you know us better than we know
[58:49] ourselves
[58:51] and father we ask that you give us what
[58:52] we stand in need of
[58:54] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[58:57] you may be seated
[59:05] on tonight i like to just take my time
[59:08] but
[59:09] but hurry up
[59:11] um
[59:12] we we're living in a time where
[59:15] uh everything seemed to be falling apart
[59:20] there is no real security in this world
[59:24] uh when it comes to
[59:27] friends i think the
[59:29] best friend that any of us could ever
[59:31] have would be jesus christ
[59:35] the thing that i love about the lord is
[59:37] that
[59:39] his sacrifice was a perfect one
[59:43] and we know that there is no salvation
[59:45] in any other
[59:47] outside of jesus christ
[59:50] no matter how the theologians try to
[59:52] dress it up and
[59:54] how they try to water things down
[59:57] now they're saying these so-called
[1:00:00] christians that there are other ways of
[1:00:02] going and making heaven
[1:00:05] but we like to say tonight that jesus
[1:00:07] christ is the only true
[1:00:12] god i love the way he has done things
[1:00:18] god didn't just take a handful of things
[1:00:20] and throw him out there and then began
[1:00:23] to choose
[1:00:24] what he thought would be the best thing
[1:00:26] to do
[1:00:28] but we understand by god's grace that we
[1:00:30] are the very living thoughts of god
[1:00:34] and no matter how imp
[1:00:36] perfect you may think you are
[1:00:39] if god has chosen you to be perfect in
[1:00:42] his mind he's never seen you
[1:00:44] being otherwise
[1:00:46] we are
[1:00:48] a blessed generation
[1:00:51] and i love the lord because
[1:00:53] he left so many things on record for us
[1:00:56] to see
[1:01:00] the thing that really encourages me
[1:01:02] is because the bible said he's already
[1:01:04] blessed us
[1:01:06] and the only way that you're going to be
[1:01:08] blessed is that you accept your
[1:01:10] blessings
[1:01:13] the bible said he blessed us
[1:01:16] with all spiritual blessings
[1:01:22] where
[1:01:24] in heavenly places
[1:01:27] in christ
[1:01:28] that's the key
[1:01:29] not in the flesh
[1:01:31] in christ amen
[1:01:34] and often time we
[1:01:36] fail to see
[1:01:39] that jesus christ has done all that he
[1:01:41] could possibly do
[1:01:44] you say i want to be healed well i can
[1:01:46] tell you 2 000 years ago he paid the
[1:01:48] price
[1:01:50] but it's up to you to go by the grocery
[1:01:52] store to pick it up
[1:01:54] it's there for you
[1:01:57] he's already done those great things
[1:01:59] that you want him to do
[1:02:01] but oftentimes we
[1:02:03] take god
[1:02:05] and we make him human
[1:02:08] and we call ourselves to think in that
[1:02:11] way
[1:02:13] that god sometimes get weak
[1:02:16] and sometimes we think that god runs out
[1:02:19] of supplies
[1:02:22] god can never run out of supplies
[1:02:25] he is so much god he's
[1:02:27] all and in all
[1:02:29] right he's through all he's in us all
[1:02:33] and you know there is no way to escape
[1:02:35] him
[1:02:38] because everything that he made
[1:02:40] he made within
[1:02:44] the thing that i'm trying to get to
[1:02:45] tonight
[1:02:46] is to understand the perfect perfection
[1:02:49] of your perfect sacrifice
[1:02:52] in other words there's not a problem you
[1:02:54] can go through that the sacrifice of
[1:02:56] christ cannot solve amen
[1:03:00] no matter what it is
[1:03:03] the power of jesus christ has already
[1:03:05] been released to us
[1:03:08] but if you don't know how to harness it
[1:03:10] it
[1:03:11] you wouldn't know what to do with it
[1:03:13] that's right
[1:03:14] for example electricity just did not
[1:03:17] start with billy uh uh uh uh
[1:03:20] huffington billy graham
[1:03:23] benjamin franklin
[1:03:25] it was always here
[1:03:28] but he had to learn how to
[1:03:31] harness it
[1:03:33] and by doing so he
[1:03:35] helped produce or
[1:03:37] came to understand what a light glove is
[1:03:41] that's how it is with the holy ghost
[1:03:44] everything you need
[1:03:46] god's got it
[1:03:49] we need not fear because
[1:03:51] this is what the spirit of laodicea is
[1:03:54] putting on everybody
[1:03:55] fear
[1:03:57] what's going to happen tomorrow what's
[1:03:59] going to happen today
[1:04:00] when is this going to happen when is
[1:04:02] that going to happen and this is going
[1:04:04] to happen then
[1:04:06] and if we're not careful
[1:04:09] fear will catch
[1:04:11] the bible says perfect love cast out
[1:04:14] fear
[1:04:15] amen
[1:04:16] there is no fear
[1:04:18] in god
[1:04:21] i was thinking
[1:04:23] about our salvation
[1:04:25] earlier today and i i my mind went to
[1:04:29] boaz
[1:04:31] and when ruth went to boaz and laid
[1:04:35] down at his feet showing that she
[1:04:37] surrendered her life
[1:04:38] to him and that's how it is at calvary
[1:04:40] you must come surrender your life to him
[1:04:43] that's right
[1:04:44] and boaz told ruth don't worry about the
[1:04:47] thing
[1:04:48] from this point on i want you to rest
[1:04:52] because i'm going to take care of the
[1:04:54] rest
[1:04:56] and i often think how we say we've gone
[1:04:58] to calvary
[1:05:00] we laid our burdens down but i think
[1:05:02] some of us picked them back up
[1:05:05] and i think this is where we're having
[1:05:07] struggles
[1:05:09] because when we lay our burdens we give
[1:05:11] our cares to christ we supposed to leave
[1:05:14] them there
[1:05:16] we don't have to worry about what god
[1:05:19] will do he said he'll do it
[1:05:22] he said if you ask anything in my name
[1:05:25] believing that you shall receive it it
[1:05:27] will be done unto you
[1:05:30] think about it
[1:05:34] if we understand the book the bible
[1:05:38] we'll find out that we come out as a
[1:05:40] winner amen
[1:05:42] in all of the drama in all of the
[1:05:45] settings of this bible
[1:05:48] there's only one winner
[1:05:51] and that's jesus christ
[1:05:52] amen and jesus christ amen conquered
[1:05:55] death hell and the grave
[1:05:58] hallelujah
[1:06:00] in one battle
[1:06:02] and when he rose amen he said all power
[1:06:06] in heaven and earth is given unto me
[1:06:10] amen and then he goes on to say after
[1:06:13] which the holy ghost has come upon you
[1:06:15] you shall receive power
[1:06:18] that power is the authority of the word
[1:06:23] hallelujah but you must learn
[1:06:26] how
[1:06:27] to work the word
[1:06:30] this word only works by faith
[1:06:33] it doesn't work by science
[1:06:36] y'all know how it is
[1:06:38] i said like this my neighbor was
[1:06:40] teaching me uh how to hunt
[1:06:43] and he gave me a rifle and he showed me
[1:06:45] how to load the rifle and showed me how
[1:06:48] to empty the rifle and showed me how to
[1:06:50] shoot the rifle and you know what i'm
[1:06:52] saying i learned
[1:06:54] by his illustrating to me on how to do
[1:06:56] it
[1:06:57] but when it came to pulling the trigger
[1:07:00] i didn't use his finger
[1:07:02] right
[1:07:04] you understand me i didn't use his focus
[1:07:07] i had to focus
[1:07:09] and i used uh
[1:07:11] his instructions in order to
[1:07:15] shoot
[1:07:16] right you understand me
[1:07:18] so what i'm trying to say is that god
[1:07:21] has given us the instructions of the
[1:07:23] word amen but he's not going to do it
[1:07:25] for you
[1:07:28] he's already done it
[1:07:29] but he's told us how to make the word
[1:07:33] work
[1:07:35] by faith faith where in him
[1:07:38] that everything he said he will do he
[1:07:42] will do amen
[1:07:45] think about how
[1:07:47] great israel was
[1:07:50] under the
[1:07:52] law
[1:07:54] and they sacrificed
[1:07:57] animals
[1:07:58] we we we we perhaps can't even a number
[1:08:01] the animals that were sacrificed during
[1:08:03] the time that israel reigned
[1:08:07] because every family had to bring forth
[1:08:09] a lamb or a goat or bullock or doves or
[1:08:14] and think about the millions of people
[1:08:16] that had to bring animal sacrifices
[1:08:20] and yet
[1:08:23] those sacrifices were not perfect
[1:08:26] amen the thing that made them imperfect
[1:08:29] is because they were animals
[1:08:32] and the thing that made jesus christ
[1:08:36] sacrifice perfect is because he was a
[1:08:39] man amen not just a man he was a god man
[1:08:44] and the blood of
[1:08:46] his body is the blood that remits our
[1:08:49] sins
[1:08:50] and cleanse our consciousness
[1:08:54] from unrighteousness to righteousness
[1:08:57] hallelujah think about it
[1:09:00] we're talking about a perfect sacrifice
[1:09:03] and when you realize how perfect your
[1:09:05] sacrifice is you don't have to fear
[1:09:09] is that right
[1:09:10] pilate who was a roman uh soldier or
[1:09:13] whatever he was he says i find no fault
[1:09:18] that right and the roman soldier amen
[1:09:21] who who
[1:09:22] was there the crucifixion he had to
[1:09:25] testify
[1:09:26] this got to be this must be the son of
[1:09:30] god amen
[1:09:32] why
[1:09:35] the bible said he was led to the
[1:09:36] slaughter
[1:09:38] a lamb
[1:09:41] a perfect lamb
[1:09:43] that had no blemishes
[1:09:45] he went from
[1:09:46] one courthouse to the next
[1:09:49] where they would judge this man and see
[1:09:51] what was there that the bible said he
[1:09:53] was dumb
[1:09:55] he wouldn't even open up his mouth
[1:09:57] now i want you to understand what i'm
[1:09:58] trying to say here
[1:10:00] jesus didn't do this only for himself
[1:10:04] but he did it for the generations to
[1:10:07] come amen remember the bible says who
[1:10:10] shall thee declare his generation
[1:10:13] jesus knew he had a family he had
[1:10:16] sisters he had brothers
[1:10:19] is that right
[1:10:20] oh come on somebody
[1:10:22] he knew
[1:10:24] that his death
[1:10:26] would bring about his offspring
[1:10:29] because he understood that he wasn't
[1:10:31] just a man
[1:10:33] the bible said the second adam was a
[1:10:35] quickening spirit
[1:10:38] we call it the holy ghost because that's
[1:10:40] the only quickening spirit we know
[1:10:44] but then jesus said amen after his death
[1:10:47] after which the holy ghost what was he
[1:10:49] saying when you become born again
[1:10:52] when that seed in you is quickened
[1:10:54] you shall have authority what kind of
[1:10:57] authority
[1:10:58] my authority
[1:11:00] we don't have somebody else's authority
[1:11:02] we have his authority because it is
[1:11:04] christ in you the hope of glory he's the
[1:11:07] one who's doing the work
[1:11:15] remember moses
[1:11:19] in genesis
[1:11:22] when they were about to make an exodus
[1:11:25] moses told them to put the blood on the
[1:11:27] doorpost and the lentil and this was
[1:11:29] just
[1:11:31] a pascal lamb a regular lamb if you want
[1:11:33] to say that irregular lamb
[1:11:35] and you know born from the lamb
[1:11:39] but that blood in that lamb
[1:11:43] had the power to keep the deaf angel
[1:11:47] away
[1:11:48] y'all understand me
[1:11:50] and if this blood of a natural lamb had
[1:11:54] the power to keep the death angel way
[1:11:57] what about the blood of the true lamb
[1:11:59] of god not only does it has the power to
[1:12:02] keep death away but it also has the
[1:12:05] power of resurrection
[1:12:06] [Applause]
[1:12:07] hallelujah
[1:12:09] now i'm sure
[1:12:11] i hope that some of you got what that
[1:12:13] token what the token meant
[1:12:16] see
[1:12:17] the token is the sign
[1:12:19] that the blood has been applied
[1:12:23] hallelujah
[1:12:24] you say my brothers how do you know that
[1:12:27] the blood has been applied because i
[1:12:29] have changed
[1:12:31] oh that put it this way he has changed
[1:12:34] me
[1:12:35] right
[1:12:36] oh my that's how you know i've never
[1:12:39] seen the real blood i've never seen the
[1:12:42] red stuff i've never seen the chemistry
[1:12:45] but the light of the blood
[1:12:49] how can you explain the supernatural
[1:12:52] washed
[1:12:53] all
[1:12:54] my sins away
[1:12:58] that the price
[1:13:00] that have been
[1:13:01] been paid
[1:13:03] required of god rather jesus paid that
[1:13:06] price by shedding his own
[1:13:09] blood let's get elementary now let me
[1:13:12] tell you something
[1:13:13] here is the devil's lie and whenever the
[1:13:16] devil comes to you with something that
[1:13:19] is not the word it is a lie amen
[1:13:23] if the devil says you are lost when you
[1:13:25] have already applied the blood you've
[1:13:28] given your heart to jesus is that right
[1:13:31] the bible said if you confess with your
[1:13:33] mouth
[1:13:34] if you believe in your heart that jesus
[1:13:36] christ is your savior he said the bible
[1:13:39] says you pass from death unto life
[1:13:41] is that right so when the devil comes to
[1:13:44] tell you that you are lost you must tell
[1:13:46] him you are a liar amen
[1:13:49] can i say it like this my price have
[1:13:51] been paid
[1:13:52] that means i don't have to pay nothing
[1:13:56] wait a minute now
[1:13:58] what do you mean you don't have to pay
[1:14:00] nothing that means i can fast i can pray
[1:14:04] i can go to church every day i can buy
[1:14:06] tithing i can do all of those religious
[1:14:08] works and still be lost
[1:14:11] because it is not all those religious
[1:14:14] works that saves you
[1:14:16] it is the blood of jesus christ it is
[1:14:19] the grace of god and it will never
[1:14:21] change amen amen
[1:14:24] but see the devil say because you didn't
[1:14:25] do this you didn't do that you're going
[1:14:27] to be lost
[1:14:29] god never saved a man and then lost law
[1:14:32] uh allowed him to be lost
[1:14:36] i'm trying to tell you something
[1:14:38] because oftentimes we don't have joy
[1:14:41] our souls because we're always trying to
[1:14:44] fix it
[1:14:46] you can't fix it that's right you came
[1:14:48] in here broke
[1:14:50] and the only person who can fix it is
[1:14:52] jesus
[1:14:54] hello you say brother brooks prove that
[1:14:57] by the word
[1:14:59] show me where the thief on the cross
[1:15:01] fixed it
[1:15:04] the only thing he could do was confess
[1:15:07] that jesus christ was his savior the
[1:15:10] only thing he had to offer was his soul
[1:15:14] he recognized his savior his savior
[1:15:17] became his perpetuation for his sins at
[1:15:21] that moment he would
[1:15:23] of god is that right because jesus says
[1:15:26] this day
[1:15:27] amen see
[1:15:29] this day amen not after you do all your
[1:15:32] works and your repentance and all of the
[1:15:34] things that that religion put on you
[1:15:37] this day you'll be with me in paradise
[1:15:39] and remember god can't change it
[1:15:43] however he
[1:15:45] had it in the beginning that's how it
[1:15:47] that's the difference
[1:15:49] that's the difference between us and the
[1:15:51] early church
[1:15:52] they knew they were saved
[1:15:55] and they knew they were saved not by
[1:15:56] their works
[1:15:58] that right
[1:16:00] they were saved by what their faith
[1:16:03] in the
[1:16:04] sacrifice that's right
[1:16:08] when you have faith in the sacrifice it
[1:16:10] will produce works
[1:16:12] amen why because i love him i work
[1:16:16] not because i'm afraid of him
[1:16:21] hallelujah is that the scripture the
[1:16:23] bible says okay you don't believe me the
[1:16:25] bible says if you love me keep my
[1:16:27] commandments
[1:16:29] that's it
[1:16:30] loving god
[1:16:32] that's what makes you come to church
[1:16:33] that's what makes you pay your offering
[1:16:35] that's what makes it's not religious
[1:16:37] rights
[1:16:38] if you're doing it for those purposes
[1:16:40] and those reasons you're not gaining
[1:16:42] anything
[1:16:43] it's got to be loved
[1:16:46] i love him because he first loved me
[1:16:53] hallelujah
[1:16:56] see
[1:16:57] he shed his own blood he did that so you
[1:17:00] say well how can that be you know
[1:17:02] because mary was his mother and joseph
[1:17:05] was his father and i'm gonna tell you
[1:17:06] something that's a lie
[1:17:13] there was not one drop of joseph's blood
[1:17:16] and not even one drop of mary's blood
[1:17:19] if it had been married in joseph blood
[1:17:21] he would have been contaminated
[1:17:23] but the bible said a body
[1:17:25] a body he prepared that means god
[1:17:29] prepared the
[1:17:30] the germ
[1:17:31] and the egg
[1:17:34] mary was just an incubator
[1:17:37] that's why when they jesus called her
[1:17:40] woman he never called her mother
[1:17:45] and he corrected her
[1:17:47] when they were in the temple
[1:17:48] they found jesus and mary said
[1:17:52] your father and i we've been looking for
[1:17:55] you
[1:17:56] and then jesus said correcting her
[1:17:58] because the word always correct error
[1:18:01] know ye not
[1:18:03] that i be about my father's business
[1:18:05] amen that's right
[1:18:08] not joseph's business
[1:18:11] not mary's business my father's business
[1:18:15] if any type of human blood
[1:18:18] that had fallen human blood would have
[1:18:20] been part of him the sacrifice would not
[1:18:24] be pure and he would not have been a
[1:18:26] perfect sacrifice
[1:18:28] but he was
[1:18:31] god created you said god did that yes he
[1:18:33] did just like god created the first adam
[1:18:36] god created the second adam
[1:18:38] god created the first out of the dust
[1:18:40] out of the earth god created the the the
[1:18:43] uh the second adam in the dust
[1:18:49] oh that's all you are that's just us
[1:18:52] right and he told the devil he says
[1:18:54] listen
[1:18:56] because of what you've done
[1:18:58] you will be eating dust until then
[1:19:02] is that right what is dust that's why
[1:19:04] you get sick satan has a right to your
[1:19:07] physical body
[1:19:08] you're the dust that he eats
[1:19:11] you the dust and cancer gets in
[1:19:13] tuberculosis and all of these things
[1:19:15] you're the dust
[1:19:17] hallelujah but guess what you have the
[1:19:20] authority and the power of the word amen
[1:19:24] to kick him off
[1:19:25] kick him out stop him from eating
[1:19:30] hallelujah
[1:19:32] the token is the token
[1:19:34] it's christ
[1:19:36] as a person together see and that's the
[1:19:38] thing
[1:19:42] death truck lazarus
[1:19:46] lazarus dead for four days eaten up by
[1:19:49] death
[1:19:51] and the voice of the resurrection by the
[1:19:54] authority
[1:19:55] of god himself
[1:19:58] lazarus come forth
[1:20:00] now i tell you what i i would love to
[1:20:03] have seen
[1:20:04] how that display how that played out
[1:20:07] how everything in that cave amen went
[1:20:10] together and you know backwards or
[1:20:12] whatever however it happened i would
[1:20:14] have loved to have seen that that that
[1:20:17] event with my natural eyes
[1:20:20] but however it happened
[1:20:23] when they
[1:20:24] lazar came out tied up hopping like a uh
[1:20:28] uh just hopping to get forth and then
[1:20:31] they said lose the man and let him go
[1:20:33] you know what he did not have to take
[1:20:35] any medications
[1:20:37] you know what they said go feed him
[1:20:40] it's about that
[1:20:42] it's about dead people once god quickens
[1:20:44] you to life all you want to do is eat
[1:20:46] but i'm not eat the word
[1:20:48] amen
[1:20:49] oh yeah
[1:20:51] that's right it's the holy spirit
[1:20:54] his life in you
[1:20:56] working
[1:20:57] his own life through you
[1:21:00] and it's for the rich
[1:21:02] the poor
[1:21:04] or for whosoever will receive it
[1:21:07] now remember
[1:21:09] the token is your fair now i'm talking
[1:21:11] about the holy ghost which is the token
[1:21:14] it is the thing that god gives you that
[1:21:16] will open the gates of heaven remember i
[1:21:19] told you jesus is the door and jesus is
[1:21:22] the key and without jesus being in you
[1:21:24] you don't have the key amen see you
[1:21:27] can't get into heaven without jesus
[1:21:29] being on the inside
[1:21:31] of you
[1:21:33] so life
[1:21:36] that life was in that blood
[1:21:39] hallelujah now that life is in me amen
[1:21:42] now that life is in you amen and the
[1:21:45] only way this life will not work for you
[1:21:47] is that you doubt that the light is
[1:21:50] there
[1:21:51] that's why i keep telling you the holy
[1:21:52] ghost is not a thing it's not a second
[1:21:55] person it's not a third person it is the
[1:21:58] person amen is that right because the
[1:22:00] bible told mary this thing that be in
[1:22:04] you is of the holy ghost amen told her
[1:22:07] that god was the father of jesus amen
[1:22:11] who helped me jesus
[1:22:14] hallelujah
[1:22:15] so why should i worry
[1:22:17] why should you fret
[1:22:19] when god has made this sacrifice so
[1:22:24] perfect
[1:22:25] that he is the judge
[1:22:28] is that right he is the jury
[1:22:31] and he's the attorney
[1:22:35] he
[1:22:36] is that right the bible said we have not
[1:22:39] a high priest that cannot be touched by
[1:22:42] the feelings of our infirmities right
[1:22:44] hallelujah why do you think gee god
[1:22:47] became man so that he can know what
[1:22:50] you're suffering he can know what you're
[1:22:52] going through he can know these things
[1:22:55] and then when you come to him amen he
[1:22:57] can be touched
[1:23:00] you never want to go before a judge that
[1:23:01] can't be touched
[1:23:03] that's why some people put on the
[1:23:05] theatrics
[1:23:08] that's why they do the crying and the
[1:23:10] solving and all of that hoping that
[1:23:12] whatever they would say through their
[1:23:13] confession would touch the judge
[1:23:16] you want a judge of compassion
[1:23:19] and jesus is that judge of compassion
[1:23:23] right now
[1:23:24] and the reason why he is right now
[1:23:27] because of the blood of jesus christ
[1:23:28] being on the mercy seat
[1:23:31] oh lord he said well it ain't on the
[1:23:33] mercy seat it's on this one i don't know
[1:23:35] about yours but it's on this
[1:23:37] hallelujah
[1:23:38] you love the lord
[1:23:40] amen when i think about what god has
[1:23:42] done
[1:23:44] let me jump to something i want to read
[1:23:46] this before i go any further
[1:23:49] one thing about jesus christ that really
[1:23:55] made me thirst
[1:23:57] more to to be like him
[1:24:01] there was nothing that
[1:24:02] disturbed him
[1:24:05] you know not even when they came to him
[1:24:07] running mary and martha you know had you
[1:24:10] not been here my brother would not have
[1:24:12] died you know jesus didn't
[1:24:17] go
[1:24:17] hysterical
[1:24:20] he kept his peace
[1:24:23] and you know you think about the time
[1:24:25] when
[1:24:26] the ship was being tossed to and fro
[1:24:32] he was so his faith was so undisturbed
[1:24:34] that no matter how bad the sea was
[1:24:37] tossed in the boat
[1:24:39] he didn't even think much of it
[1:24:42] not enough to even awake him
[1:24:46] and then his disciple
[1:24:49] calls out master
[1:24:52] carrot thou not that we perish who what
[1:24:56] think about what he just did
[1:24:59] he accused god
[1:25:02] for not caring
[1:25:03] and we all do it
[1:25:05] and we've all done it
[1:25:08] we somehow think he doesn't care when
[1:25:10] god does care
[1:25:13] how much more can he show you
[1:25:15] he cares
[1:25:19] if he didn't care he may have left you
[1:25:22] in under law instead of grace
[1:25:24] but he brought you in a time where the
[1:25:27] headstone comes down crying grace grace
[1:25:29] i'm going to give this generation some
[1:25:31] extra grace now i don't know about you i
[1:25:34] need it
[1:25:35] amen
[1:25:39] he said you've never seen our master
[1:25:41] excited about anything
[1:25:44] standing by that grave
[1:25:46] you know of a dead man he was just as
[1:25:49] calm
[1:25:50] as he was when he sat on that mount and
[1:25:54] looked over jerusalem
[1:25:56] standing on the trouble i like that
[1:26:00] he's got his trouble
[1:26:02] under his feet
[1:26:04] you understand that it doesn't mean
[1:26:06] trouble is not going to come
[1:26:08] and it doesn't mean that trouble is
[1:26:10] going to last always but one thing for
[1:26:13] certain
[1:26:15] you can put your feet on your trouble
[1:26:18] you can become lord of your troubles
[1:26:21] don't let your troubles become lord over
[1:26:23] you
[1:26:25] whirring with with with all kinds of
[1:26:27] stuff and you know it's a it's amazing
[1:26:30] because i've worried at times and didn't
[1:26:32] know i was worried
[1:26:35] and how do you know that because your
[1:26:36] body is going to react
[1:26:40] issues in your body will occur amen come
[1:26:43] upon you when you worry because your
[1:26:45] body bodies are not meant for worry
[1:26:48] that's right cancer high blood pressure
[1:26:51] and and diabetes and all of these
[1:26:54] diseases these demons that come to eat
[1:26:56] up your flesh
[1:26:58] right that's their job
[1:27:02] standing on your trouble
[1:27:06] and and in a ship
[1:27:08] within troubled seas
[1:27:10] and the waves tossed about and he was so
[1:27:13] completely rested in god until he never
[1:27:18] paid
[1:27:19] any attention to it enough to wake up
[1:27:23] always undisturbed
[1:27:26] faith
[1:27:27] and he says faith is this is what i want
[1:27:30] i can't say i've gotten that perfect
[1:27:32] faith like
[1:27:33] it's there but i need to learn how to
[1:27:35] make it manifest you understand what i
[1:27:37] mean it's like having ammunition but
[1:27:39] don't know how to use it
[1:27:41] god give us a grace give us revelation
[1:27:44] on how to use it and use it properly
[1:27:48] one of the things that causes
[1:27:50] undisturbed faith is trust
[1:27:53] trust
[1:27:54] trust
[1:27:55] trust
[1:27:57] and trust amen is is is when you it's
[1:28:01] how can i say it
[1:28:03] when you have put assurance in something
[1:28:05] an assurance in something that that uh
[1:28:09] it could be a matter of life and death
[1:28:11] but i'm sure
[1:28:13] that god is going to come through
[1:28:16] i can't explain it i don't even know how
[1:28:18] to say it but i know what i'm feeling
[1:28:21] now we find
[1:28:22] here that he the reason that we can be
[1:28:25] undisturbed hallelujah yeah i said jesus
[1:28:29] now we can be undisturbed
[1:28:32] because it was given to our father
[1:28:35] abraham and his children
[1:28:38] and god who who who who who made the
[1:28:41] promise swore by an oath that he could
[1:28:45] could confirm it and keep it
[1:28:49] and that he has done
[1:28:51] see when you get jesus on the inside you
[1:28:54] got the whole book amen you got every
[1:28:57] promise in here in the inside but you
[1:29:00] need to learn how to tap into it by
[1:29:03] faith
[1:29:04] and faith will call those things that be
[1:29:06] not as though they were amen hallelujah
[1:29:09] remember john ryan
[1:29:12] extra extra read all about it i'm healed
[1:29:15] blind is a bat
[1:29:17] but he knew that the word was right he
[1:29:20] knew what the prophet prophesied over
[1:29:22] him was right and even though he
[1:29:24] couldn't see he had to learn what faith
[1:29:27] was amen he had to connect faith with
[1:29:30] his mouth and his mouth convec connected
[1:29:33] to his heart and once it struck his
[1:29:35] heart the revelation opened his eyes
[1:29:38] extra extra read all about it i'm healed
[1:29:42] hallelujah i know it works when i had to
[1:29:45] walk with that foot limp like that
[1:29:47] running and everything else after that
[1:29:49] little stroke i had it meant i know it
[1:29:51] works amen amen god straighten it up for
[1:29:54] me
[1:29:56] let me tell you something if you you
[1:29:58] confess it
[1:29:59] believe it
[1:30:00] don't give up on it it has to manifest
[1:30:04] you have no idea angels are waiting for
[1:30:06] your service
[1:30:07] amen they're waiting for your service
[1:30:11] i can remember the time
[1:30:12] there was a sister amen they told her
[1:30:15] that she needed to have an abortion
[1:30:17] because her baby had spina bifida
[1:30:20] and that is when the spine uh the back
[1:30:23] in the back doesn't close up or some
[1:30:25] sort of thing like that
[1:30:26] and uh and she came to me
[1:30:29] i said sister you believe that lie
[1:30:33] i say don't believe the lie of the devil
[1:30:35] i don't care if the doctor saw it he may
[1:30:37] have seen it on his screen but no no no
[1:30:40] no that's not what jesus said amen
[1:30:43] hallelujah
[1:30:45] thank god she did not have an abortion
[1:30:48] because that baby came out perfect
[1:30:50] [Applause]
[1:30:52] what was that faith
[1:30:54] faith will move a mountain
[1:30:58] hallelujah
[1:31:01] i remember when my wife had our first
[1:31:03] baby she was
[1:31:04] real slow and coming and my wife had
[1:31:06] gone through this thing for a long time
[1:31:08] and
[1:31:09] she she called a sister from the church
[1:31:11] and
[1:31:12] that sister came to the church and came
[1:31:14] to my house to pray for my wife and all
[1:31:16] she did was drop her head boom
[1:31:19] and the pains was
[1:31:21] on
[1:31:24] faith
[1:31:26] moved amen
[1:31:28] hallelujah y'all understand what i'm
[1:31:30] saying
[1:31:31] listen people of god
[1:31:33] faith brought me here
[1:31:34] somebody's faith all right amen and
[1:31:37] faith brought you here amen amen
[1:31:40] right
[1:31:41] oh it's nothing but the truth hallelujah
[1:31:44] turn with me to jeremiah 29.
[1:31:50] people say they love god and can't even
[1:31:52] produce love come on somebody and love
[1:31:54] you know how can you say oh i just love
[1:31:56] you and ain't got no joy
[1:31:59] what's wrong with folks
[1:32:02] insulting insulting
[1:32:04] [Music]
[1:32:08] everybody go through trials
[1:32:10] everybody go through disappointments
[1:32:12] hallelujah
[1:32:14] but jesus told mary and martha
[1:32:17] did not i say
[1:32:19] if you believe it you shall see it
[1:32:22] that's it
[1:32:23] if you believe it you shall see it and
[1:32:26] let me tell you something if god shall
[1:32:29] say no to you why do you think he
[1:32:32] doesn't know what he's doing
[1:32:35] god answer is always perfect that's
[1:32:38] right amen
[1:32:39] oh we love the yeses yes lord yes lord
[1:32:42] but listen the footsteps of a righteous
[1:32:45] man they are ordered by the lord
[1:32:48] that's why the bible said in all things
[1:32:51] give thanks
[1:32:54] yes
[1:32:55] truly truly we should never be defeated
[1:32:59] by lack of faith
[1:33:04] faith
[1:33:07] can literally alter the hand of god
[1:33:11] amen
[1:33:12] hezekiah says lord i don't want to die
[1:33:18] when the word of god had already been
[1:33:19] spoken but he sat his face against that
[1:33:22] wall and he cried out to the lord and
[1:33:24] the lord gave him 15 more years
[1:33:27] hello god let me tell y'all something
[1:33:30] we we need to understand amen that god
[1:33:33] amen understands everything about you
[1:33:36] the problem is we don't understand
[1:33:38] everything about us
[1:33:40] that's right the reason why
[1:33:43] because sometimes we like small children
[1:33:45] we want it our way
[1:33:47] i don't want it my way i want it his way
[1:33:51] and i think that ought to be everybody's
[1:33:53] thought
[1:33:54] his way is the right way
[1:33:57] right
[1:34:00] moses could say well lord it would just
[1:34:01] take seven days three days or however to
[1:34:04] get over there to the promised land and
[1:34:05] you've taken us 40 years
[1:34:09] but god had something else in his mind
[1:34:13] that's what we don't understand he is
[1:34:15] the future
[1:34:17] he knows that he sees it and he must
[1:34:20] manipulate sometimes our own will to
[1:34:23] make it his will to bring us out just
[1:34:25] right all things work together for the
[1:34:28] good of them that love the lord
[1:34:34] when god gave us his life
[1:34:37] he couldn't have given us nothing better
[1:34:39] that's right
[1:34:41] jeremiah 29
[1:34:44] i'm going to tell you something what's
[1:34:45] going to help us
[1:34:47] sincere prayer
[1:34:49] you and i must pray more amen hallelujah
[1:34:52] but you know prayer is not always asking
[1:34:55] god prayer often times is
[1:34:58] worship when you get down in there and
[1:35:01] you start worshiping him and you forget
[1:35:03] about you
[1:35:04] and all about him
[1:35:06] you're getting ready to go somewhere
[1:35:08] you say that's not scripture yes it is
[1:35:12] the woman at simon's house
[1:35:15] she never came to him she didn't bow
[1:35:17] down to him and start saying lord i want
[1:35:19] this i want that i want this i want that
[1:35:22] what did she do
[1:35:23] she went into automatic worship
[1:35:26] she went into crying she went into
[1:35:28] worshiping him she went into rubbing
[1:35:30] washing his feet and drying with her
[1:35:31] hair and it wasn't and then jesus said
[1:35:34] woman what would you have me to do
[1:35:37] he knew it he knew what she wanted and
[1:35:39] then but she wanted him to know she went
[1:35:42] into worship let me tell you something
[1:35:44] if you get into worship you might get
[1:35:47] what you want
[1:35:50] is that right that's what we do my kids
[1:35:52] will do it
[1:35:53] you know what they haven't done in a
[1:35:54] long time but when they were younger
[1:35:56] they did it
[1:35:57] whoo daddy this daddy this dad and he
[1:35:59] said well what what did you want what do
[1:36:01] you
[1:36:02] you know they're up to something
[1:36:05] right but they gave you the right
[1:36:07] protocol
[1:36:10] see that's the thing god already knows
[1:36:12] but sometimes he wants to see really
[1:36:16] do you love me
[1:36:18] you know there's a he's a king and
[1:36:19] sometimes we forget he is a king that's
[1:36:22] right he is the king king of kings and
[1:36:26] sometimes most of the time we don't even
[1:36:28] approach him like a king
[1:36:30] but you know what even as children as a
[1:36:33] child of the king you still have to give
[1:36:35] reverence where reverences due
[1:36:37] respect you can't just walk in there
[1:36:40] like daddy no no no no there are
[1:36:42] protocols
[1:36:44] even in the natural
[1:36:46] way of life
[1:36:48] a way of approaching a king
[1:36:54] you know
[1:36:55] is it like when you go before a judge
[1:36:56] you're not gonna go what's up judge
[1:36:59] you know what he's gonna say throw him
[1:37:00] out
[1:37:09] he said well brother brooks how i know i
[1:37:11] got the token here it is what were you
[1:37:13] before
[1:37:15] and what are you now
[1:37:18] see
[1:37:20] let's read this
[1:37:22] jeremiah 29
[1:37:24] 10.
[1:37:29] i hope i got this right
[1:37:32] hallelujah
[1:37:34] yes
[1:37:36] let's go to the 11th verse sorry
[1:37:39] for i know the thoughts that i think
[1:37:41] toward you saith the lord god
[1:37:45] thoughts of peace
[1:37:47] and not of evil
[1:37:48] to give you an expected end
[1:37:53] then shall you call upon me and ye shall
[1:37:56] go and pray
[1:37:57] unto me and i will hearken unto you
[1:38:03] and ye shall seek me and find me
[1:38:06] when ye shall search for me with all
[1:38:11] your heart amen amen
[1:38:14] you understand that's how you find him
[1:38:18] when you search for him with all your
[1:38:20] heart he is the center of attraction
[1:38:23] amen
[1:38:26] and sometimes you got to go through
[1:38:28] barriers to get to him
[1:38:31] like the woman who washed his feet
[1:38:33] mary had to go through the religious
[1:38:35] barriers to get to jesus
[1:38:39] you think about the woman who had the
[1:38:41] shooter my woman who had a dead baby
[1:38:43] there dead baby boy
[1:38:46] and she would not accept see that's what
[1:38:48] i'm saying
[1:38:49] she was she was not accepted i was
[1:38:51] telling somebody the other day i said
[1:38:53] that's what's wrong with this this we
[1:38:56] who call ourselves the bride somebody
[1:38:58] died and we just say they're dead and
[1:39:00] they're done we never seek god to see if
[1:39:03] it's the will of god for this to be
[1:39:06] mary and martha amen they sought god and
[1:39:09] here it was lazarus dead for days and
[1:39:13] they said they just couldn't accept it
[1:39:18] something in them drove them to god
[1:39:20] because they knew that jesus could
[1:39:22] change the situation
[1:39:24] and when you know that something looks
[1:39:26] so dead there's not no way it could come
[1:39:29] back to life people that's the time you
[1:39:32] you you say no
[1:39:34] i'm going to seek god until god changed
[1:39:37] the matter because he showed me find you
[1:39:39] a scripture in the word and go with that
[1:39:42] scripture before god that's how you do
[1:39:44] it
[1:39:45] you become part of the book
[1:39:49] faith never accepts no for an answer
[1:39:55] yeah sometimes the people say well
[1:39:58] you know i got to fire you
[1:40:00] how are you going to let somebody fire
[1:40:02] you without giving a fight
[1:40:04] and you know god gave
[1:40:06] you that job
[1:40:08] it's your dude and say hold up
[1:40:11] god gave me this job yes
[1:40:13] and if god gave me this job and you fire
[1:40:16] me
[1:40:17] you're gonna have to deal with god
[1:40:19] they're gonna look at you like you plum
[1:40:21] crazy but you are for jesus
[1:40:24] you understand me you need to put some
[1:40:26] fear into the hearts of these
[1:40:28] unbelievers
[1:40:30] come on somebody
[1:40:33] yes that's the way i look at it god give
[1:40:36] me a job i don't care how rough it is i
[1:40:38] don't have to walk off of it
[1:40:43] y'all looking at me like i'm crazy
[1:40:45] but the truth is if god tell me to leave
[1:40:48] that's a different story
[1:40:50] because he gave it to me he told me to

[1:40:56] leave

[1:41:26] part
[1:41:28] jesus even said lord i wouldn't let this
[1:41:30] cup pass from me
[1:41:32] there's a human part that always wants
[1:41:35] to run from troubles i just heard this
[1:41:38] today
[1:41:41] but faith says i'm not going nowhere
[1:41:45] you think you think the devil wasn't on
[1:41:47] david's track when david saw goliath
[1:41:52] and let me tell you something the closer
[1:41:54] he got the bigger goliath look
[1:41:58] hallelujah from his distance amen
[1:42:00] goliath may have looked somewhat like
[1:42:02] him but the closer he got to the problem
[1:42:05] the bigger the problem was but you know
[1:42:07] what he didn't count down
[1:42:10] do you know what he said this day i'm
[1:42:12] going to take your sword and i'm taking
[1:42:15] your head off
[1:42:16] that's the way faith works
[1:42:21] i'm almost done
[1:42:22] but i know i'm telling you the truth
[1:42:29] luke 16 14 please

[1:44:06] i don't have the strength to do it
[1:44:07] sometimes and sometimes when you fall

[1:44:35] we all do it we all go through it you
[1:44:37] may not say a word but i know we are why
[1:44:40] because you're made of flesh
[1:44:44] you're made of flesh oh brother books
[1:44:45] what about the prophet he wanted to run
[1:44:47] too
[1:44:50] sure he did
[1:44:51] god told him today you go out there and
[1:44:53] act like elijah in the wilderness if you
[1:44:55] want to say you'll lose your wife and
[1:44:56] everybody else
[1:44:58] yeah
[1:44:59] human the human part of us that's not
[1:45:02] god
[1:45:03] but the inside

[1:45:06] is where god dwells
[1:45:10] all right 16 14
[1:45:12] hallelujah glory to god
[1:45:16] i hope i got that right
[1:45:20] amen
[1:45:24] i don't think i do
[1:45:26] let me uh
[1:45:27] maybe it's 14.
[1:45:31] well anyway that i wrote the wrong
[1:45:33] scripture down somewhere
[1:45:37] oh yeah yeah sorry 1616 is what it is
[1:45:44] the law and the prophets were until john
[1:45:48] and since that time the kingdom of god
[1:45:52] is preached
[1:45:53] and every man presseth
[1:45:56] into it
[1:45:59] what is press
[1:46:01] you don't just walk into it
[1:46:03] it's not easy
[1:46:05] you got to keep pressing why because you
[1:46:07] got opposition
[1:46:09] don't you understand we're living in the
[1:46:11] most evilest age ever
[1:46:14] and all of those demons of you euphrates
[1:46:16] is trying to keep you from your goal
[1:46:19] if it wasn't for predestination you
[1:46:22] wouldn't make it
[1:46:23] if it wasn't god on your side standing
[1:46:26] for you
[1:46:27] in this age you would not make it
[1:46:31] it is the holy spirit that keeps you
[1:46:34] moving and keeps you moving and keeps
[1:46:36] you moving even when you don't feel like
[1:46:39] it he keeps pushing you right
[1:46:42] like our brother said even when you
[1:46:44] don't feel him he's working
[1:46:47] even when you don't see him he's working
[1:46:50] he's a waymaker
[1:46:51] that's one of my favorite songs now amen
[1:46:54] and i've been a favorite for a long time
[1:46:56] but you know there are times when you
[1:46:59] think to yourself lord where are you
[1:47:02] he's there
[1:47:03] always will be there
[1:47:05] because he said i'll never leave you nor
[1:47:08] will i forsake you and in my closing
[1:47:11] i want to tell you something
[1:47:15] all you need is in jesus name amen amen
[1:47:19] everything amen
[1:47:21] it's today tomorrow whenever
[1:47:24] when you need something you can't
[1:47:25] accomplish you can't do it you can't
[1:47:27] overcome it whatever the case may be you
[1:47:30] call on the name of jesus that's what
[1:47:32] david said the name of the lord is a
[1:47:34] strong tower and the righteous run it in
[1:47:37] and they are saved
[1:47:39] hoax that's it
[1:47:41] you say oh brother brooks oh brother
[1:47:43] brooks let me tell you something one
[1:47:46] thing about faith faith has no time time
[1:47:49] limit
[1:47:52] we don't know how long it took for the
[1:47:54] world to be created
[1:47:56] but by faith jesus did it
[1:47:58] and they can call it the big bang all
[1:48:01] they want to we don't know when the big
[1:48:03] bang took place but it took place
[1:48:06] and you are the manifestation of the
[1:48:09] word of god spoken
[1:48:12] hallelujah
[1:48:13] amen and to think
[1:48:16] to think
[1:48:18] guarding he's not dealing with size
[1:48:21] and i thank god he's not jesus was a
[1:48:23] small statue of man
[1:48:25] you know everybody got him looking so
[1:48:26] pretty he ain't a pretty bad the bible
[1:48:28] said he wasn't good to look at
[1:48:31] there was no beauty found in him that's
[1:48:32] the bible is that right but let me say
[1:48:34] it like this
[1:48:36] think about it as big as that sun is
[1:48:41] you have the authority
[1:48:43] to stop it
[1:48:47] joshua did it right son stand still
[1:48:52] and if you put yourself within the sun
[1:48:54] you would not even be able to be seen
[1:48:57] you'd not even
[1:48:58] expect
[1:49:00] but that god in you
[1:49:03] that little place in you amen has given
[1:49:05] you the authority of heaven and in earth
[1:49:08] that's what he said all power in heaven
[1:49:11] and earth is given unto thee and jesus
[1:49:13] said i'm giving you that power when you
[1:49:16] receive the holy ghost
[1:49:19] that's it
[1:49:21] that's it everybody looking let me tell
[1:49:23] you something i'm closing
[1:49:25] when this squeeze comes because it's
[1:49:27] coming and let me tell you something we
[1:49:30] don't have to fear nothing
[1:49:34] y'all believe that in the spoken word
[1:49:36] amen
[1:49:37] y'all believe that god has made us
[1:49:38] little
[1:49:41] oh creators on somebody
[1:49:43] do you think
[1:49:45] you being the bride god is not going to
[1:49:47] take care of you even in those christ
[1:49:48] those times of crisis
[1:49:51] food shortage is coming it is coming
[1:49:54] they already announcing it
[1:49:57] but you know what the truth of the
[1:49:59] matter is
[1:50:01] when you in your hiding place
[1:50:04] when you're in christ
[1:50:06] who is christ but the prince of peace
[1:50:10] and he said if you keep your mind on me
[1:50:14] i will grant to you perfect peace
[1:50:18] this is what we should be looking at god
[1:50:21] where is my perfect peace
[1:50:26] and every one of us know
[1:50:29] the mind battles we go through during
[1:50:31] the day
[1:50:33] we wish we could just shut them off
[1:50:36] at
[1:50:36] will but it doesn't happen that way
[1:50:40] and let me tell you something the only
[1:50:41] way they can shut that off is that you
[1:50:45] disconnect yourself
[1:50:48] with your problems
[1:50:50] and begin to glorify god
[1:50:53] you glorify god you thank god don't even
[1:50:56] worry about the storm because you're in
[1:50:57] the cleft of the rock
[1:50:59] you're in a safety place and god ain't
[1:51:01] going to forsake you nor will he leave
[1:51:03] you
[1:51:04] just go ahead and praise god
[1:51:06] let god know how much you love him
[1:51:09] that's what he want to see right he
[1:51:11] wants you to he want to see like we say
[1:51:13] god has unconditional love well he wants
[1:51:16] to see your unconditional love for him
