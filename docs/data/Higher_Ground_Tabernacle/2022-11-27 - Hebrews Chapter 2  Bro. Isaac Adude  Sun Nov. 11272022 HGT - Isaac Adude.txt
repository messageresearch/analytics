in Jesus Christ [Music] amen he met this morning we'll open our Bibles in the book of Hebrews Hebrews chapter 2 it was when we read from verse 1 to verse 4. amen when I was doing my Bible study just getting ready for the service my hookers verses amen I tried to find a way out to title my sermon this morning but I couldn't find a way because subsided to do most of them so we'll be we'll be talking about the book of Hebrews chapter 2. from by the grace of God will go from verse 1 to verse 18 which is throughout the service center but against all um show how you know what Paul was expressing not only about it this girl it's I mean let's read uh Hebrews chapter 2 verse 1 to verse 4. when the Bible says therefore we ought to give the more Earnest Heat to the things which we have heard let's say any time we should let them sleep the man is for if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast and every transpiration and Disobedience received they're just recompense of reward foreign how shall we escape if we neglect so create salvation which at first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that hurt him amen verse 4 God also bearing them weakness both with signs and wonders and with diverse Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will because Paul says therefore we ought to give the more Earnest Heat to the things which we have heard less at any time you should let them sleeps for if the word spoken by angels it's not Angels here it means all the profits you see the results amen because uh if you go to the first chapter of of Hebrews the first verse you will see how Paul was explaining it for me um and he says therefore if the word spoken by Angels or prophets was steadfast and every transpiration and Disobedience received are just recompense of the world and let's uh bow our heads again father God again will come before Eternal Grace Lord we just ask you father God to come and help us Lord I pray for the Lord that you help me to be so sensible to the holy spirit so that could say exactly and only what you want me to say this is Lord we have read your word Lord we pray father God that you come and teach it to yourself in Jesus Christ and but this morning as I said we'll be talking about Hebrews chapter 2. it might work all through the entire chapter and we see wherever God will lead us amen because if you read all the books of Hebrews yeah but you'll understand that Paul was there is one thing about Paul that he was exalting Jesus Christ all an example from Hebrews chapter 1 to the last chapter I forget what chapter it is exalting Jesus he was talking about Jesus I mean he was talking about how Jesus died on the cross for us he was talking about how Jesus became a high priest he talked about so many things about Jesus and so many interesting if you have time just go and do a study on these books it shows those interests you see boats and and and planes and stuff like that is we'll find out on our own way out but no I received a clear message from the Lord there is no other way out there is amen and that was to go into the ark the only way for you to be saved was to go into that Ark the soulmate but as the Bible tells us that they didn't go they didn't uh receive what Noah told them so all of them perished amen we see the same thing with Moses reality obey God and and to do exactly what God told them to do that of Israel about that great land about the promise of the that God gave to Abraham Israel the children of Israel about that that lane that that with milk and honey amen even sent spies and they went to spy on the country and they came back with the fruits they came back with testimony saying that God is truly I mean what God Said is is right and it's truth and and these are the fruits but yet instead of serving God that's the only true God that wanted to serve an Idols amen they rejected everything Moses tell them even though they saw all the Miracles they're so bread coming down from heaven says there's some meat coming down from heaven this year there's so water coming coming out of the of a rocket they sell all those impossible things that a human a human mind couldn't comprehend but but still they rejected that word they walked in the desert for I don't I don't remember how many years and and still their clothes were not destroyed his own his own mind they were seeing Miracles every day they had experiences with the Lord every day of their lives amen they were receiving cooked bread from Heaven every day but still instead of believing what Moses was telling them even instead of trusting the Lord they wanted to build their own Idol his own preference amen they wanted to go back to Egypt so all those old people and and parents of that time they all missed the line they didn't go in um that's what Paul here is telling us in verse 1. it says that we are to give the more Earnest here to the things which we have heard Lester at any time we should let them sleep amen verse 2 he says that for if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast amen and every transgression and Disobedience received a just recompense of reward amen the angel the word that was spoken by the prophets were steadfast it amen the words that were spoken by the Angels they were true that amen all those prophecies that came to pass and everyone who neglected those prophecies and those warnings amen they all perished amen they all were punished amen they all received amen amen according to their actions amen because because the Bible says that that God puts a Watchman on top of the tower plus [Music] amen amen he's there to see and to watch over to see if there's a danger coming to warn the people inside of the city amen and this watch means amen there are prophets and and and Servants of God Amen God places them there to see the the oncoming danger is it said something else to warn us about the things that are coming to warn us about the destructions that are coming you see that if you read the Bible will tell you that those who will hear those warnings and Truth to neglect it and obviously this is so it's up to you now to take it to to take that word and and apply it I see a woman it's now your job to take that word and live by itself she used to reject the word even your blood will be on yourself amen you won't be there blaming God for not saving you or for doing something wrong amen because God gave you the word of Grace I will give you the warning of Grace and you chose to refuse it is the prophet says that Grace is Grace when it is received as Grace am I talking about the the the the the the age and how people are being multiplied and and how all the Prophecies of the Bible are being fulfilled but alone telling us that it's a time to check our lamps it's a time to make sure that we do have the oil imagine make sure that he was serving the true God when he came back he started telling his church that we've been wrong we've been doing things the wrong way we have to follow them we have to live like them they have the true love is they serve the Living God he had that experience amen and every one of us have to have that experience the prophet says that that experience of the back of the desert experience how you met God and when and where Edgars who you were before and what you were doing before now you're a complete new man amen he has placed all those Watchmen to take care to uh uh warn us about the the dangerous amen he says the profit says that Israel had to uh in the in the message the uniting time and sign uh paragraph 59. he said that Israel had to turn down the message first and when they turned down the message the National Life United itself together other nations look and today they have turned down the message of the Lord Jesus and they have turned it down and now the time has come to where communism is uniting the world together against the church see it has to be that way now it's hard to say that they had first to reject that message they have first to reject that warning that's exactly that's the same thing that people are doing today is it a mentioned amen people are rejecting the message amen people are rejecting the warnings amen people are choosing what to hear amen people are choosing what kind of message they want to hear amen if you bring the message of repentance they will say we passed that age and we're no longer there is preach about the Holy Spirit they'll tell you we need some meats and we need some grown-up stuff even the ABCs of the words amen people are rejecting me and that's when destruction comes amen and when you start to reject the message and they all perished amen we have the entire Old Testament to tell us about these stories that every time the message of warning was rejected even these people had to pay for it because you will see today people are concerned about other stuff please that is coming up and listening about the new movies are about to be produced people are concerned about what's the next show what's the next game and they are neglecting the very same thing that can save them they are more concerned about worldly stuff they spend their entire week about you know on these things and not having time for God not having time to open their Bible and read it not having time to listen to the message amen if you see someone who only speaks about the word his friends will say well this man is boring that is everything that he talks about it and then he only talks about God and only talks about the word amen but in that first church that was the same that was exactly what they were talking about amen people were talking about God from morning to night before Paul was preaching for hours amen the apostles they were preaching for hours they were fellowshipping for hours [Music] they saw all their goods and they all brought it together the money and they live in the in that same place that communion in life but today you hear a preacher preaching for an hour and 30 minutes you call it too long when you see people yawning a church and people going back and forth am I telling me it's launched it's lunch time yeah I have some better things to do I have to go to work and there is no that love that first love has been forgotten amen we have to go back to it man how long has you been since you nailed by your bed and prayed amen when was the last time you even spent even 30 minutes with God just praying foreign am I staying entire chapter and doing a study about that man how long has it been how long has it been since you last talked about Jesus your friends since you last witness to someone how long has it been they probably said don't you put a tape and after 10 minutes you fall you fell asleep amen we have to go back of how we when we first receive this message when we were first Saved amen we were happy to hear about God we're happy to talk about it yeah man we were happy to testify about it but where are we now amen that's what Paul was talking about she said he was saying that take heed to These Warnings make sure that you take it to heart that's right amen the prophet says that take heat um your work who was made a little to lower uh who was meant a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crown him crowned with Glory and Honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man is for for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons under glory to make the caption of their salvation perfect through suffering Perfection amen Jesus was made lower than angels for a time for a period of time it was made nowhere By Angels Amen to redeem every man amen to give the man a home in heaven made lower than Angels you feel the sickness amen amen to be to be a marketed Amen to go through Calvary that's why he became a man made leader made a little lower than Angel for a time being different amen and then after day was crowned with Glory and Honor yeah amen by the grace of God of God should taste death for every man I thank God Amen that is when that is how we treat the Sun up we treat the son of man and how God treats the son of man amen the way we treat the son of man amen sometimes we make fun of him amen we call him names well we say he was born in a manger it was mistreated amen people call them all kinds of names amen he had to go through all these things amen so that by dying on the cross amen he will be but we have the power so that by dying on the cross I mean he will have that power to save you so that by dying on the cross he will test there for every man amen he would taste death for you and me when he knows exactly what is going on it's exactly amen he's able to feel your pain is able to feel your sickness how we could only stop just for a minute it says that uh who are you anyhow what does that job you got means that little house we own me what does that little look that you have now you young men with shiny slick hair straight shoulders he said by blessed be the Lord you've got a soul that's born again you live forever and ever because he become you yeah you through his grace might become him and make a place for you if if that's why it was made little lower and a little lower than Angels it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all by whom all things in bringing many sons into Glory but you do chose to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings when he became us so that we can become him amen he became homeless so that we might have a home amen he was made sick amen so that we might be healed amen he was made soon that we might be saved amen he took your place he died on the cross foreign he says that all power has been given to me you will see that even though people were insulting him [Music] to die on the cross and they who are Sanctified are all of One song for which cause he is not ashamed to call them Brethren um am I talking about Jesus amen and who are Sanctified am I talking about you and me amen and he's so happy and proud to call us his brothers a man through suffering um he became one with us amen that's that's when you know that was the plan of redemption this is themselves they had to pray for their own sins Elijah couldn't come and die for foreign [Music] foreign amen through suffering he didn't have to go through it when people weren't making fun of him at the cross I'm saying that if you are truly the god that you talk about that you've been telling people this is truly the son of man that you've been telling people if you really did all these Miracles that the Bible that that we have heard amen speaks the prophet says that he had the power and the ability to do exactly that is so that we can become together amen and we have to thank him for it now verse 14 and verse 15 of the same chapter amen the Bible said Paul here says that for as much for as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood and she don't prescribe he also himself likewise took part of the same yeah he got more participate remember that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage for as much as the children are partakers of flesh and blood amen amen let me go set them free you went with the key and they say come promise land that God has promised us amen that Resurrection morning he had to die him and in order to set them free to take the key of death from the devil doesn't make it there now death is no longer a punishment for Christians he's no longer a prison death is only a resting place we adore to the next to the next Dimensions because foreign is yeah lift up your head or your gates for the king of King is Coming amen God is the king of kings it's really what they want amen chapter verse 14 and 18. verse 14 to verse 18. Paul says that for verily he took not on him the nature of angels that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God I thank you foreign foreign [Music] he might be merciful and faithful in things even so that he can sympathize with you when you are attempting because it knows exactly what it takes to overcome that Temptation he knows exactly what temptation is exactly what sickness is amen he overcame all this that that the reason he become this that is the reason to become this is that he might be sympathetic with with you amen with who you are amen have your ups and downs and your little ins and outs evil and your Temptation gets so great you can't hardly stand it he knows how to sympathize with you he says to make intercession he says to love you and there you go and there you go straight he won't forsake you will still come after you and knock at your heart amen there is not there is not a backslider in the building that uh uh about what no uh there is not a backslider in the building but what no that God knocks at his heart daily now as long as you are a model on this Earth a man is able to feel what you're feeling even though Temptation gets so hard that you can't take it anymore amen one situation gets hard and you can't you can't stand it anymore I know that God is there with you you may know that God is always by your side they may know that God is there amen that you're not alone you're not going through it alone because he had to go through the amen the Bible says Paul says yes for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched by the feeling of our infirmities so now let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace find Grace to help in time of needs we have in high priests amen that can't be touched with the feelings of our infirmities foreign man because he says that I'm going back to I'm going I came from the father and I'm going back to him he went back to the original form of being that pill of fire that led the children of Israel of fire that protected the children of Israel of fire that has appeared today this is that same Jesus Christ amen that same Jesus who appeared to Paul amen he's able and he's willing to show to show himself to you images ask him to do so amen he will show himself to you he is willing to forgive us from all our sins a man is willing to save us Amen to to save us to heal us from all our sickness and when he became that he became a high priest may he give that sacrifice his only himself as a Land once and for all sacrifice I mean what you have to do is just go and clean even go and claim your forgiveness no need to bring another sacrifice amen himself he offered himself he meant to save you to wash you from your sins amen so that we can inherit or the promise given to the city of he says that Jesus in the spiritual is the lily of the valley and when you get to such a place you can't stand yourself no more when you get to such a person you can't stand yourself no more and life means nothing to you amen the prophecy that God has got the shot of opium for you of the valley you know there is is all your troubles amen all of them is gone away you don't have to get drunk on Whiskey you don't have to get drunk on this and whiskey to ease your trouble because they will come right back again but come again get a drink of opium from the lily of the valley what may if you leave if you die if you if you're this or that or the other Adventure um nothing separates you from the love of God that's in Christ that will save you from from from darkness that will bring light to your life [Music] when we seek amen when things are not going well we can just go to him and ask him to give us that shot Elizabeth is all your problems it will give you solutions to all your problems give you answers to all your questions amen just that shot juices lord I can't take this on my own anymore say Lord I can't do this on my own anymore foreign died on the cross for you and me he became a man for you and me amen he went through all those pains for you amen he left all his glory on the before you and meant to be marketed he meant to be given vinegar instead of water today you can be saved amen so that today you can be happy that's why Paul was expressing to uh the Hebrews he was telling them that Grace because the Hebrews they were born in the law that's why that's the only thing they knew was the law yeah when Paul was telling them that the law is only a policeman imagine show you how worse of a Christian you are the law will show you how bad you are amen by here is the grace amen here's the grace that Jesus Christ died for you amen that same Grace he gave Peter who denied him three times Peter who rejected him who denied him we want to be called his followers remember that morning of the Resurrection amen when he gave the message to the women he says that go tell my my disciples and Peter yeah specifically but amen he named the name of Peter specific moment amen that this is the grace of God Amen that he has been forgive foreign in that place amen the Bible says amen for in him for in that he himself has suffered being tempted and he's able to secure them that are attempted uh Verse 18 he'll listen to is Amen to sympathize with you so whenever you have a situation that you can't handle hey um I know that God knows exactly what you feel something amen it's like the song that we're saying uh uh bring it there am I because Jesus knows what you feel basket you say it's like the most he had to go through that same thing in order to be happy to be able to save you even in closing I read the prophet he says the Hebrews chapter 2. paragraph 147. he says the Bible says he ascended on high and give gifts unto men is there was an atmosphere hung over the Earth there was an atmosphere hung over the Earth [Music] an atmosphere of Darkness of Gloom of death and weary an atmosphere the prayers couldn't go up couldn't come up because your atonement wasn't made by he broke the veil he opened up the way he broke the veil of sickness he broke the veil of sin is he broke the veil of weary and he broke the veil of depressed he broke everywhere and made the highway for the wayfaring man walking up the King's Highway amen he had to do it for you and me Amen to give you the the that first uh that priority they meant to open up that line of Prayer in Minnesota When you pray because that's why you had to break that Veil that's why he had to break that shadow of death of Darkness of death that was hanging over in the atmosphere you can directly go to him instead of When you pray God will hear it and God will give you what you need that's why Paul was trying to explain the Hebrews this is that you no longer abide on the law amen but he was introducing Grace to them yes this is the grace Jesus died for you amen this is the grace Jesus took your place amen this is the grace for us Jesus died for every one of us Jesus took our place amen he suffered all these things Amen to give us the power to overcome death I mean he had to be sick to give us the power to be healed and then he had to become sin Amen to give us the power to be safe amen the Grace has been given to us amen we have to take it as Grace because there is a prophet says that Grace is Grace sin just go to God and open up your heart and confess so you sin you have the Forgiveness you may know that that Grace is not an eternal thing amen because that Grace when it is rejected when he becomes a judgment will be judged but the same word that we are reading right now people will be judged by this book amen the same book that brings us Grace image of same book brings judgment to others so you have to be on the right side where the grace of God is supposed to take you have to claim that Grace amen God bless you can come [Applause] amen praise God Amen sing amen In The Presence of Jehovah amen [Music] amen let's let's sing this
