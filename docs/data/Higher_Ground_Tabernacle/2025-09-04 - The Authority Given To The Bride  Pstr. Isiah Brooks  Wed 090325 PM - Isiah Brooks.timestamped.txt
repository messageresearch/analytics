[17:17] I

[17:20] [Music]
[17:23] Brothers, can you open up your prayer,
[17:24] please?
[17:30] I just want to thank the Lord. Amen. For
[17:33] Amen. Just a little testimony before I
[17:36] Amen. Pray. Amen. Just want to thank the
[17:38] Lord for was a couple weeks ago I uh um
[17:42] one of our vehicles, my daughter's
[17:43] vehicle, uh all of a sudden went into
[17:47] drive and it would just smack it. It hit
[17:49] something. So almost right away I knew
[17:52] it was a transmission and uh so an old
[17:55] car when you have to change a
[17:57] transmission it can get pretty expensive
[17:59] and sometimes worth more than the car.
[18:02] So I you know just I just asked the Lord
[18:05] and just uh you know something that we
[18:07] can afford or whatnot. And of course you
[18:09] look on Google and those places and they
[18:12] tell you it's three to $5,000 easy you
[18:15] know to replace a transmission.
[18:18] Yeah, that was a lot, you know. So, you
[18:20] know, I just, you know, I I don't
[18:23] typically worry about things too too
[18:25] much. So, I just kind of put it in the
[18:27] hands of the Lord and called the uh
[18:29] brought it to the the the station. Um,
[18:32] and he called me the next day. He says,
[18:35] "I can't believe it. I got a
[18:36] transmission for $850. We can put it in
[18:39] for total of $1,800." I said, "Do it."
[18:44] Amen. And so I thank the Lord for for
[18:46] those, you know, just little things. God
[18:48] blesses you. Amen. I could go on. I
[18:51] mean, every day at my work, I'm over my
[18:53] head and in things to do and and
[18:55] responsibilities, but the Lord just sets
[18:58] the path straight and I end up the day
[19:00] I'm like, I got it all done somehow. So,
[19:04] I just thank the Lord for those kind of
[19:05] things. Amen. Praise God. Amen. He's a
[19:09] Hallelujah. He said in the revelations,
[19:11] I think it's revelation, he says, will I
[19:13] find faith at the end. Amen. And he also
[19:17] says he loves the angel of the Lord's
[19:19] loves that song only believe. Amen. So,
[19:23] Amen. That's what we ought to do. Amen.
[19:25] Let's just bow our heads.

[19:29] you, Lord. We give you praise. We give

[30:58] &gt;&gt; Let's give God a round of applause.
[31:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Diego did a good job.
[31:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
[31:09] When the brother texts me and asked
[31:11] could he do it, I'm like wonderful.
[31:14] The more the marrier.
[31:17] &gt;&gt; So I I appreciate him. And so whenever
[31:20] you do it and you want to break out with
[31:22] a song,
[31:24] &gt;&gt; you know what I mean?
[31:29] &gt;&gt; By God's grace, uh,
[31:33] you know, I love the African songs even
[31:34] though I don't understand.
[31:37] So that's what I'm saying.
[31:39] whenever God want use you in that way.
[31:42] So we appreciate the Lord Jesus.
[31:46] I have a testimony as well similar to
[31:48] what our brother you know I I spent a
[31:52] lot of money like you said
[31:54] from my 2017 car and
[31:58] and I had already said I'm done putting
[32:01] money down this thing and something was
[32:04] leaking. I don't know what it was. It
[32:05] looked clear. So, I went down in the in
[32:07] the garage and I kind of swiped my
[32:09] finger. It was kind of sticky. I thought
[32:10] it was some kind of oil. I don't know
[32:13] what it really was. And uh I just turned
[32:16] it up a little bit. Um because uh I
[32:21] wanted to know what it was so that if I
[32:22] had to sell it, I would tell the person
[32:25] to whom I would sell it to the problems
[32:28] that existed.
[32:30] But then I I I even went yesterday
[32:32] looking around for a car and I thought I
[32:35] don't see nothing I like.
[32:38] But I said to the Lord, I I prayed. I
[32:40] said, "Now, God," I said, "Uh, you've
[32:43] done so many things for me, and I know
[32:44] you can fix this leak, whatever it is."
[32:47] So, I took it to the shop today, and
[32:50] they told me it was going to do cost me
[32:52] $80 to do a diagnostic.
[32:55] And uh they did the diagnostic and
[32:57] couldn't find no leak.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, somebody.
[33:02] There was a leak,
[33:04] &gt;&gt; but they couldn't find no leak.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; And then when I got to the place,
[33:10] they've got a new guy there. He saw me
[33:13] come in. He said, uh, either he said,
[33:16] "Praise the Lord," or "God bless you." I
[33:18] looked at him and he just grinning. He
[33:20] said, "I want you to know we didn't
[33:22] charge you anything."
[33:27] &gt;&gt; Not only did God bless me because they
[33:29] told me they were going to charge me
[33:30] $80. And I said, "Well, that's fine.
[33:33] That's fine." But God says, "No."
[33:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; And I was walking. While I was walking
[33:39] after um he told me there was no leak,
[33:43] God reminded me that I prayed that he
[33:45] would heal the car
[33:46] &gt;&gt; and God did just.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:49] &gt;&gt; I I believe this is the hour and the
[33:53] day. I'm sorry we don't have an
[33:55] interpreter, but this is the time that I
[33:57] believe God wants to do something with
[33:59] the bride of Christ. Amen.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; This is the adoption time. This is a
[34:03] time that we are to be made manifest.
[34:06] But the only way that we can do this is
[34:08] that we must believe.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:11] &gt;&gt; We've gone with this message for years
[34:13] now.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; But somehow we got to ask God to give us
[34:16] the grace.
[34:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; To hold fast to the word and really
[34:20] believe it like we ought to.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; Uh as we stand, pray for my wife. She's
[34:26] not feeling well today. She's just
[34:28] overwhelmed. tired and um had to do
[34:32] school today. So
[34:35] otherwise she would have been here. But
[34:37] I saw it over and I said, "Honey, if you
[34:39] don't feel like it, you know,
[34:45] you don't you don't have to come." She
[34:48] has some things a particular item on the
[34:51] stove that overcooked, right? You know
[34:54] what that means, right?
[34:56] But by the grace of God, I knew that was
[34:58] a sign she was well tired. So, Acts 4
[35:02] and 12,
[35:05] I do my best. I'm going to go as slow as
[35:08] I possibly can so that those of you who
[35:12] don't understand English as well, you
[35:14] may be able to get something tonight.
[35:21] It was a surprise to me. um
[35:25] that there was going to not not anyone
[35:27] going to be here. So, but by the grace
[35:29] of God, God works all things according
[35:32] to his will. Acts 4:12,
[35:36] neither is there salvation in any other
[35:40] for there is none other name under
[35:42] heaven given among men whereby we must
[35:47] be saved.
[35:50] Amen.
[35:52] Acts 8
[36:01] and it reads, "But ye shall receive
[36:05] power,
[36:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; after that the Holy Ghost is come upon
[36:09] you, and ye shall be witnesses unto me
[36:13] both in Jerusalem, in all Judea, in
[36:17] Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of
[36:20] the earth."
[36:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us pray. Dear heavenly father
[36:24] God, we thank you for your grace and
[36:27] your mercy. We thank you for being so
[36:30] good to us. Lord, you have been better
[36:32] to us than we've been to ourselves. And
[36:35] Father, we thank you, Father, for your
[36:37] presence. Most of all, we thank you for
[36:39] your saving grace. We thank you, Father,
[36:42] for being our atonement. We thank you
[36:45] for the blood of your dear son, Jesus
[36:47] Christ. It is in his blood that we
[36:50] trust, in his word that we trust. And we
[36:53] thank you, Father God, for all that you
[36:55] do for us, giving praise, glory, and
[36:58] honor to your name. In Jesus Christ's
[37:01] name we pray. Amen. You may be seated. I
[37:04] want to say on last Wednesday when we
[37:08] preached uh here, no I didn't preach.
[37:11] I'm sorry. Thank brother Miss Paul
[37:14] preached. It was such a blessing to me.
[37:17] I was I was extremely tired and I didn't
[37:20] realize that I was fighting something.
[37:22] It was uh some kind of bug something
[37:25] because my wife was fighting too. Um
[37:29] Amen. So, uh this new suit that I have
[37:32] on, it was given to me. Okay. So, that
[37:35] you know, but I I just want I felt a
[37:39] need to say that. But anyhow, in all
[37:42] that we do, we must understand by the
[37:45] grace of God. Amen. That God is always
[37:49] in control.
[37:51] I was uh really had to preach down there
[37:55] on Thursday night. And honestly, I've
[37:57] traveled from the United States to South
[38:00] Africa from af out of the out of the
[38:03] plane into the pool pit preaching three
[38:05] to four hours. And I never was as tired
[38:08] as I was on Thursday in South Carolina.
[38:13] Didn't know what I was going to do. I
[38:15] knew I had to minister. I felt the
[38:17] uncction to do so. But physically
[38:20] everybody saw how fatigued or tired I
[38:23] was.
[38:25] Nevertheless, I went forth and God did
[38:27] bless.
[38:29] On Friday night, uh they had a different
[38:32] minister, Jimmy. Uh he is from uh Zambia
[38:37] and he ministered a great service by the
[38:40] grace of God. And um
[38:43] after service they had a friend of mine,
[38:46] her name is Hannah Ojar. I have known
[38:49] her uh when she was a little or young
[38:52] girl just getting married maybe a year
[38:54] or two. Um I knew her father who was uh
[38:59] a precious pastor there in Trinidad who
[39:02] was also a friend of mine. Let me jump.
[39:06] She is very gifted. You know dreams,
[39:08] visions, you name it. The Lord uses her
[39:11] in a mighty way. her husband is the
[39:13] pastor uh where she where they reside
[39:17] and they work together going on
[39:19] missionary trips and sponsoring uh
[39:22] missionaries whether they be from
[39:24] Africa, whether they be from South
[39:26] America. God has blessed her to do so.
[39:29] So anyway, I was inspired after all of
[39:32] her testimonies. Her testimonies were uh
[39:35] phenomenal. I, you know, hopefully
[39:38] she'll come here one day with with uh
[39:40] with those testimonies. At least I
[39:42] invited her. Um um so I went after
[39:46] service and I asked her to lay hands on
[39:48] me for those of you who may have a
[39:50] problem with that. She laid hands and I
[39:54] said, "Pray for me." And um I said, "I'm
[39:57] not going to even tell you what to pray
[39:59] for." But anyway, she prayed for me and
[40:02] the next morning my throat was healed. I
[40:05] was so swollen back there. I could
[40:07] barely, you know, see anything back
[40:09] there. It was just swollen
[40:12] and everything. But God healed me.
[40:15] &gt;&gt; And so I was able to testify because I
[40:18] wanted to, you know, with with the
[40:20] healing, I wanted to make all the
[40:21] skeptics know
[40:23] &gt;&gt; that what God was doing to this, this
[40:26] lady is a very wonderful sister clothed
[40:29] in humility. She's not trying to be a
[40:31] pastor or preacher. she just let him go
[40:33] and let God.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; And so anyway, we had the greatest
[40:38] meeting and I mean, we've had many uhh
[40:43] tent meetings down there, and I can't
[40:45] remember when I first started, but I
[40:47] feel and believe that the one we just
[40:50] had was the greatest of all. uh because
[40:52] we had people delivered, we had people
[40:55] receiving the Holy Ghost and most of all
[40:58] we had people who were saved, got
[41:00] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[41:02] Christ. Uh it was and every message were
[41:07] were geared toward the sinner, the
[41:09] visitor. So anyway, we was really
[41:12] grateful uh for that in in the name of
[41:15] Jesus.
[41:17] Liy of the belly,
[41:22] let your sweet aroma
[41:25] feel my life.
[41:30] Rose of Sharon,
[41:33] show me
[41:36] how to grow in beauty
[41:40] in thy sight.
[41:45] Fest of 10,000.
[41:50] Make me a reflection
[41:53] of your life.

[42:13] night.

[42:48] before.
[42:51] Oh

[43:04] right.
[43:12] Oh, day star shine down on me.
[43:18] Let your love shine through me in the
[43:22] night.
[43:30] Lord, I want to see a witness.
[43:35] I'm sorry.
[43:38] Master of deceit.
[43:48] Groping in the darkness.
[43:53] Haunted by the years of past.
[43:57] [Music]
[44:04] But when I see you standing near me,
[44:10] shining with compassion in your eyes.
[44:22] Oh day shall shine down on me.
[44:28] Let your love shine through me in the
[44:32] night.
[44:37] Hallelujah.
[44:38] Oh,
[44:40] lead me Lord. I'll follow
[44:45] anywhere you open up the door.
[44:55] Oh,
[44:58] let your words be to me.
[45:02] Show me things I never seen
[45:07] before.
[45:09] [Music]
[45:12] Oh,
[45:14] and Lord, I want to be a witness.
[45:20] You can take what's wrong and make it
[45:23] right.
[45:31] Oh day stars shine down on me.
[45:37] Let your love shine through me in the
[45:41] night.
[45:48] Oh,
[45:50] lead me, Lord. I follow.
[45:54] Anywhere
[45:56] you open up the door.

[46:11] Show me things I never seen before. Oh.
[46:19] Oh.
[46:24] And Lord, I want to be a witness.
[46:30] You can take what's wrong and make it
[46:33] right.
[46:41] Oh, take the dying down on me.
[46:46] Let your love shine through me in the
[46:50] night.
[46:57] Oh
[46:59] Jesus, shine down on me.
[47:03] Let your love shine through me in the
[47:08] night.
[47:14] Oh
[47:17] Jesus, shine down on me.
[47:21] Let your love shine through me in the
[47:26] night.
[47:29] Amen.
[47:33] God is good to us. Amen.
[47:36] Appreciate the Lord.
[47:38] like to entitle this message
[47:41] given authority to the bride.
[47:47] I'm learning something.
[47:50] And I'm learning that we have
[47:54] been saying for years
[47:57] that we trust God.
[48:01] We believe God.
[48:04] But when it comes to problems,
[48:08] we seem to have a hard time
[48:12] trusting him.
[48:16] We know that the trials come to test us
[48:22] to see whether we believe or not.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; And to say that you believe and then the
[48:29] trials come and you falter and fail is
[48:34] just evident that you don't believe.
[48:39] Revelations 10:7-8
[48:42] it says, "But in the days of the voice
[48:45] of the seventh angel, when he shall
[48:48] begin to sound the mystery," not
[48:52] mysteries, and I've heard that uh quoted
[48:57] wrong so many times, but there is one
[49:00] mystery of God should be finished
[49:05] as He had declared unto his servants the
[49:08] prophets.
[49:10] So even though there are multiple
[49:12] mysteries in this message, there is one
[49:15] major mystery
[49:18] that God wanted to reveal to us.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; And and that mystery
[49:24] is himself.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; And the voice which I heard from heaven
[49:29] spake unto me again. Now listen to this.
[49:33] and said, "Go and take the little book
[49:35] which is open in the hand of the angel
[49:39] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[49:43] earth."
[49:45] Now, the mystery of God
[49:48] and then he tells him, "Go take the
[49:50] book." It's a continuation
[49:54] of what this mystery of God
[49:57] &gt;&gt; is about.
[50:00] And we find out according to the prophet
[50:02] of God that our names were placed in the
[50:06] lamb's book of life
[50:09] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. So
[50:11] that lamb book is a part of the mystery
[50:17] &gt;&gt; of God.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; Y'all understand what I'm saying?
[50:22] Ah, I like to say it here because when
[50:25] God created Adam,
[50:29] this is a mystery.
[50:31] He created him male and female.
[50:39] [Music]
[50:48] and a female with
[50:51] a feminine nature.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Both Adam both Adams responded to the
[51:02] name when called.
[51:07] In other words, when God would call Adam
[51:13] both male and female
[51:18] would respond because
[51:21] &gt;&gt; according to Genesis 5
[51:24] &gt;&gt; their name one name their name
[51:29] &gt;&gt; was called Adam
[51:34] understand this is a mystery
[51:37] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham brought it out so
[51:39] clearly throughout the message
[51:43] They shared the authority together.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; They were co-equal.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[51:54] &gt;&gt; They were both They were the God of
[51:57] Eden.
[51:59] [Music]
[52:00] Hallelujah.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[52:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. They were the god
[52:07] &gt;&gt; and they were the ones to teal the
[52:10] ground,
[52:11] &gt;&gt; teal the soil.
[52:13] Just read. They were the one
[52:17] &gt;&gt; who were going to teal the soil.
[52:21] Uh
[52:23] cultivate.
[52:28] The cultivation
[52:31] &gt;&gt; was not by the sweat of their brow.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; Was not by physical labor.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; The cultivation was by the spoken word.
[52:46] Is that right?
[52:48] Not only did they govern the earth,
[52:56] &gt;&gt; but they had power over the atmosphere
[53:02] atmosphere.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; They regulated
[53:05] the temperature.
[53:09] Amen.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[53:12] &gt;&gt; They had control over nature.
[53:18] And they both were without sin
[53:26] during this time.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; And we don't know how long the reign
[53:31] was.
[53:33] [Music]
[53:34] But Adam
[53:37] was the God of this earth.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Now understand what I'm saying.
[53:44] could not have been God on the earth
[53:48] had there not been a God above the
[53:50] earth.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Had there not been a God above the
[53:54] earth. Um,
[53:56] Adam was the God of this earth
[54:00] &gt;&gt; and Elohim was the God of all
[54:06] &gt;&gt; until
[54:08] the female Adam
[54:12] was beguiled to believe Satan's lie.
[54:21] Her nature was changed
[54:24] and the wonders of Adam was separated,
[54:30] broken
[54:32] &gt;&gt; until Adam took her back.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; He became the sacrifice of his wife.
[54:45] could not restore himself,
[54:51] nor could he resto restore his wife.
[54:57] Because of her uh fall,
[55:02] &gt;&gt; she became the mother of all living.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is why we needed a second
[55:15] Adam
[55:20] to restore what the first Adam could not
[55:22] do.
[55:25] [Music]
[55:32] needed a perfect blood.
[55:36] We needed someone without sin
[55:41] who would believe all of the word
[55:46] keep all of the word.
[55:50] It was the second Adam
[55:54] that was able to fix
[55:58] what the first Adam broke.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the perfect blood.
[56:07] Hallelujah. Amen.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; I I want to say it like like I'm getting
[56:10] ready to say it.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Because of the blood of Jesus,
[56:17] &gt;&gt; he is now restored. Eden,
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Eden, Eden
[56:22] &gt;&gt; is now restored.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; The earth is restored.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Heaven is restored.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Everything that was broken,
[56:35] the first Adam,
[56:37] the second Adam has restored.
[56:42] We have not yet come into that
[56:44] manifestation of all things.
[56:50] Calvary was enough
[56:54] &gt;&gt; because the second Adam
[56:57] when he was crucified
[57:01] &gt;&gt; before he died.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said it's finished.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; This second Adam
[57:13] was the beginning of God's creation.
[57:19] He was to establish a new race,
[57:27] a people that would come on the earth
[57:32] and would be exactly
[57:35] the kind of man and the kind of woman
[57:43] that God had in his mind.
[57:48] from the beginning.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Hey, when we get to heaven, I'm jumping.
[57:55] It
[57:56] &gt;&gt; It's a beautiful thing.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; What God is doing now,
[58:03] the time
[58:05] of the fall,
[58:08] at the time of the restoration of all
[58:10] things,
[58:13] God is collecting his seed.
[58:17] is collecting his sons.
[58:22] God is collecting his daughters.
[58:26] God is collecting all of the family of
[58:29] God.
[58:34] Glory to God. Glory to God. If Adam had
[58:37] not sinned,
[58:40] &gt;&gt; all of his all of his offspring
[58:45] all of his offspring, all of his
[58:47] children
[58:49] &gt;&gt; would bear the name Adam.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; So the second Adam,
[58:56] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Because of his victory,
[59:00] &gt;&gt; all of his children
[59:03] bear his name.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because in Ephesians 3
[59:11] &gt;&gt; 14-1 17
[59:15] the Bible said for this cause
[59:18] I draw my knee unto the father of our
[59:20] Lord Jesus Christ
[59:30] of whom the whole family in heaven and
[59:33] earth is
[59:35] named.
[59:38] Hallelujah. That he would grant you
[59:42] according to the riches of his glory
[59:44] &gt;&gt; to be strengthened with might by the
[59:47] spirit in the inner man.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; That Christ may dwell in your heart by
[59:53] what? Faith.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; That we be rooted and grounded in love.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Because you got to realize
[1:00:05] the second Adam
[1:00:08] was the king of love.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; I like to say it like that because he
[1:00:14] come for his queen.
[1:00:17] The queen must be the queen of love.
[1:00:20] Hallelujah.
[1:00:22] She must be bone of his bone and flesh
[1:00:25] of his flesh.
[1:00:28] Hallelujah.
[1:00:30] the age that we're living in,
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; God is bringing us into
[1:00:39] little by little
[1:00:42] conquering the enemy.
[1:00:46] Little by little, we're literally going
[1:00:49] back
[1:00:51] to where we had fallen from.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:55] But right now,
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; the Bible says according to St. H first
[1:00:59] John,
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; now are we the sons of God,
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; and it does not yet appear,
[1:01:10] and we shall be like,
[1:01:14] and we know that we'll be just like him.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; An apple bring forth apples.
[1:01:22] An apple tree bring forth an apple tree.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; An orange tree bring forth oranges.
[1:01:35] Understand me.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; And God bring forth God.
[1:01:40] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; We the devil don't want us to know
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; who we really are.
[1:01:49] He makes us look at this flesh.
[1:01:53] This flesh is condemned.
[1:01:56] Hallelujah. This is this has never been
[1:01:59] really
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; truly the true image of God.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because you got to remember
[1:02:08] when mankind was first created,
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; he was created spirit.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Speak.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; And then God formed man.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Then God formed man
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; out of the dust of the earth.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Understand that by the grace of God. So
[1:02:29] what are we returning back to?
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; We're returning back to a man and a
[1:02:36] woman
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; that's going to truly
[1:02:41] every word of God.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:47] Amen.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; We are created
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; and ordained to believe the word
[1:02:54] for this day.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; And I mean all of it.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; We didn't come to be coward.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; We we the bride
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; will not lose users.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; But the Bible tells us
[1:03:15] that we are more than conquerors
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; through Christ Jesus.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you what, we believe
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; that we are God's chosen people.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; We believe
[1:03:34] that we stand before God as a changed
[1:03:36] virgin.
[1:03:41] We believe that the power and authority
[1:03:44] of the word
[1:03:48] given to us
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; according to acts 1 and8
[1:03:55] to acts 1 and8
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; where the bible says
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; you shall receive power
[1:04:06] which the holy ghost has come.
[1:04:09] We believe
[1:04:11] Hebrews 13:8
[1:04:14] Jesus Christ
[1:04:16] is the same yesterday,
[1:04:19] today and forever.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; If he heal the sick yesterday,
[1:04:25] heal the sick today.
[1:04:28] Do it yesterday.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; He delivers the people today.
[1:04:34] So he changes character.
[1:04:38] of a prostitute
[1:04:42] in her,
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; a real daughter of God
[1:04:48] today.
[1:04:50] The eyes of a blind man
[1:04:54] today
[1:04:56] doing it today. Hallelujah.
[1:04:59] Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[1:05:01] We believe what the word says.
[1:05:06] And we believe it
[1:05:08] piece of message
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; upon the things you've heard.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; St. John 17
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; 22- 26 26.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; And the glory which thou gavest me,
[1:05:31] I have given them that they may be one.
[1:05:37] even as we are one,
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; I in them, thou in me,
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; that they may be perfect in one,
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; and that the world may know,
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; that thou has sent me
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; and has loved them as thou has loved me.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Now, watch this.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; The world may know that you sent me.
[1:06:03] Hallelujah. Now, how will they know?
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Because you've been sent.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; And if you've been sent by God,
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; they will see God in you.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; He said, "Father,
[1:06:18] I will that they also whom thou has
[1:06:22] given me be with me where I am."
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; That they may behold my glory which thou
[1:06:30] has given me. For thou loveth me before
[1:06:34] the foundation of the world.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; What are you reading, Brother Brooks?
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Reading that were in the lamb's book of
[1:06:43] life.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Why would you say that?
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Because it is the lamb
[1:06:51] speaking these things.
[1:06:54] Hallelujah.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; St. John 17.
[1:06:58] Jesus is speaking things
[1:07:01] that has one time been a mystery.
[1:07:04] You hear what I'm saying? Even his
[1:07:06] disciples didn't understand it,
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; but he was laying it out for the bride
[1:07:13] of this day.
[1:07:16] She'll know
[1:07:18] she was with him before the foundation
[1:07:21] of
[1:07:24] she needs to know.
[1:07:27] All the love hear her.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Like he loved him.
[1:07:33] Why?
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Because when Jesus
[1:07:36] the firstborn of God creation
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; was male and female.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Just like in the beginning,
[1:07:48] first Adam
[1:07:50] created the first Adam
[1:07:53] male and female and in Jesus Christ.
[1:07:57] was male and female. Hallelujah.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; I open up the the womb or the side of
[1:08:03] Adam.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; The first
[1:08:10] Amen.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; But the second Adam
[1:08:14] hadn't fallen.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Somebody help me here.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; God didn't bring out a Eve.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Adam second Adam. Jesus Christ.
[1:08:23] He didn't bring out an Eve. He brought
[1:08:26] out another Jesus.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; He brought out another Christ.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; He was born of his bone,
[1:08:36] flesh of his flesh.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; He kept the word. She kept the word
[1:08:43] also.
[1:08:46] They thought it was just blood and
[1:08:47] water. They thought it was just blood
[1:08:50] and water flowing from his side.
[1:08:54] Hallelujah. But they did not understand
[1:08:58] what God was doing.
[1:09:00] He was building a bride.
[1:09:03] Hallelujah. Out of blood, water, and
[1:09:06] spirit.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. And these three
[1:09:10] agree in one. Hallelujah.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; That's what he was doing.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; And right now,
[1:09:18] light of Jesus Christ
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; is learning about his authority.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Because if she can see his authority,
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; she'll be able to see her authority.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Come on. There was not a demon in hell.
[1:09:36] Jesus. Hallelujah. God didn't care if
[1:09:40] they were blind.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; He didn't care if they were lame.
[1:09:45] Hallelujah. He didn't even care if they
[1:09:48] were dead.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not even death.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Could hold that body down
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; when Jesus called for it.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Somebody help me here.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; That's the authority of the bride.
[1:10:04] God revealed to you that you can pray
[1:10:07] for somebody.
[1:10:11] All you got to do is speak the word.
[1:10:16] Amen.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is that right?
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; When Jesus When Jesus walked down to the
[1:10:23] tomb of Lazarus,
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He knew exactly what he went
[1:10:28] down there to do.
[1:10:31] He told those disciples of his that
[1:10:34] Lazarus was sleeping.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; He didn't understand them.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Those who are in Christ Jesus
[1:10:45] We can never die.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; We might go to sleep.
[1:10:52] Body may lay in the grave for a long
[1:10:55] time.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; It may even rot into dust.
[1:11:01] Hallelujah.
[1:11:03] But the real you and the real me.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When we leave this body,
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; we're like Paul, we said we know
[1:11:15] Whatever that could be dissolved, we
[1:11:18] have a building.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This this this you you
[1:11:24] real you
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; is covered by this oinful body.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; These old days,
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; God is going to call for his children.
[1:11:36] Hallelujah. God will call for his
[1:11:38] children
[1:11:41] and they will have to get up
[1:11:44] on somebody.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. You say, "Well, what
[1:11:47] do you mean, brother Brooks?"
[1:11:52] If Jesus had not called Lazarus by name,
[1:12:01] Amen. But he calls you by your name.
[1:12:06] One of these old days, I believe he's
[1:12:09] going to call
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It doesn't matter where you
[1:12:16] are.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter if they put you in the
[1:12:20] fire and burn you up.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Every element,
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; every element
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; that represents you
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; don't have to come back together.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Y'all understand me? Amen.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Even when Lazarus was raised from the
[1:12:36] deadlines
[1:12:48] got jealous of him.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; The Pharisees got jealous of him in
[1:12:53] order to put him to death.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; But when God call us
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; from the grave,
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; death has lost his whole.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; This is why Paul,
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; he understood who he was.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; He understood he was facing death.
[1:13:18] Brother Brandham said he laughed in the
[1:13:20] death face.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Paul laughed.
[1:13:24] in the face of death.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; You know why?
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Because Paul didn't have to conquer
[1:13:31] death.
[1:13:37] You don't have to conquer death.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we fall asleep,
[1:13:49] we don't have to worry about whether we
[1:13:51] going to get up.
[1:13:54] The Bible said the same spirit
[1:13:58] you that was also in Christ Jesus
[1:14:02] quickened his body
[1:14:05] quicken your body.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Glory to Jesus.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; God Jesus prayed
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; in St. John
[1:14:18] that God would give us the glory that he
[1:14:22] had with the father before the
[1:14:24] foundation of the world.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; And Jesus gave us that glory.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; And I was just thinking, Lord, what was
[1:14:32] the glory
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; that a man
[1:14:37] can live like God?
[1:14:40] Somebody help me here.
[1:14:42] The glory of Jesus Christ
[1:14:45] could not be something separate from
[1:14:47] God.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; It had to be God.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; And in Jesus, the Bible said, dwelt the
[1:14:56] fullness.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Godhead body.
[1:15:01] So the glory of God in Jesus Christ was
[1:15:06] the very nature of God.
[1:15:10] the very of nature of God.
[1:15:14] God was in Christ.
[1:15:17] Y'all better hear me.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; God was in Christ.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the fullness of the
[1:15:23] Godhead was in Christ.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:28] And listen what brother Brandham said.
[1:15:31] All that was in God
[1:15:34] into Christ.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and all that was in Christ
[1:15:40] born into his church.
[1:15:45] Hallelujah.
[1:15:46] See the glory of God
[1:15:49] nature of God.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; No nature, no glory but glory as high as
[1:15:57] God's glory.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He is God. Say Jeremy.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Glory to J. You love the
[1:16:06] Lord.
[1:16:08] Amen.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we allow
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Satan
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; to really scare us.
[1:16:15] Hallelujah.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; And when fear is driven away,
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; his faith will take control.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Y'all understand me?
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; And I say it like this.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; They looked at Jesus and let me read it.
[1:16:32] Let me read it.
[1:16:33] Matthew the 8th chapter beginning at the
[1:16:35] 24th verse.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; And it says, "Behold,
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; there arose a great tempest in the sea
[1:16:47] in so much that the ship was covered
[1:16:50] with the waves, but he was asleep."
[1:16:53] Speaking of Jesus,
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; and his disciples came to him,
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; "And awoke him, saying,"Lord, save us.
[1:17:02] we perish.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; And he said unto them, why are ye
[1:17:07] fearful?
[1:17:09] Oh ye of little faith.
[1:17:13] Anytime you're fearful,
[1:17:16] your faith is not where it should be.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Then he arose and rebuked the winds and
[1:17:23] the sea, and there was a great calm.
[1:17:27] Amen.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; But the men marvel, saying, "What manner
[1:17:32] of man is this
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; that even the wind and the sea obey?"
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "The disciples
[1:17:45] right here did not have the complete
[1:17:48] revelation
[1:17:50] of Jesus Christ."
[1:17:53] Hallelujah.
[1:17:54] No man can calm the sea.
[1:17:57] Hallelujah. No man can stop the war
[1:18:00] waves.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; No man can stop the wind.
[1:18:05] He said at that point in time, at that
[1:18:08] point in time,
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; it was not a man
[1:18:14] who stopped
[1:18:17] the wind and the storm
[1:18:21] sea to a calm. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:18:24] See, that's the problem. Whenever you
[1:18:27] see Jesus as a man,
[1:18:30] you're going to have problems.
[1:18:32] Hallelujah. Even Paul said, "You don't
[1:18:36] know him no longer
[1:18:39] know him no longer
[1:18:41] after the flesh.
[1:18:44] Know him after the spirit."
[1:18:48] If those disciples had known him after
[1:18:50] the spirit,
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; then it would have been known.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Though the body rested,
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; though the body rested,
[1:19:01] God never sleeps nor slumber.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on somebody.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And often time
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; we allow our flesh
[1:19:12] to describe us.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; We allow our flesh
[1:19:18] to describe us.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; No need to fear.
[1:19:25] We can see now
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; the Christ.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; That's what brother Brandham brought.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, the mighty angel
[1:19:35] came down
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; and put one one foot on the land and one
[1:19:40] foot on the sea,
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; And all we see is a man."
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I want you to understand that
[1:19:48] was more than a man.
[1:19:50] That was God.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But God used an image.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; That we might be able to understand.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; It wasn't an angel.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; You understand me? That angel, he didn't
[1:20:06] have wings.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was a man
[1:20:12] and he was showing to us
[1:20:15] and the authority of the bride.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:20] Given to him
[1:20:23] conquered the land and the sea,
[1:20:27] conquered politics,
[1:20:30] our world that through Calvary.
[1:20:32] Hallelujah.
[1:20:34] You understand me?
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; So what are you saying?
[1:20:38] You hear fearing
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Thaw
[1:20:42] simple faith
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; just simple.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; It's not some great
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; it's real simple.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; All we had to do is believe God.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; I didn't care whether people thought
[1:20:57] what they thought about me asking that
[1:20:58] sister to pray for me.
[1:21:02] I knew she had a gift of faith
[1:21:04] that heals
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; and I used it
[1:21:11] for
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; some people stumble when a sister is
[1:21:16] gifted.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, see how y'all get quiet?
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Y'all think the sisters are just gifted
[1:21:21] to wash dishes.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Are you out of your mind?
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; In the New Testament,
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; prophetist
[1:21:34] Huh? It's the truth.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; And if we are the New Testament church,
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; those gifts are supposed to be among us.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, y'all scared.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; I just want to see God's will be done.
[1:21:54] I want to drive all these fears away
[1:21:56] from people
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; and all these traditional nonsense.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Traditional things
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; that has nothing to do with God
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; or this message.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Now talking about the
[1:22:13] when you when you why fear when you have
[1:22:15] the seal of the Holy Ghost.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; And what is the seal of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:20] but Christ himself.
[1:22:25] Jesus Christ
[1:22:27] conquered it all for us.
[1:22:31] Amen.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Have faith in him.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Rest in him
[1:22:37] and his promises.
[1:22:40] He said like this. The Old Testament
[1:22:45] had to naturally conquer everything.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right?
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; They had to conquer Jericho.
[1:22:57] Hallelujah. Is that right?
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Joshua who had to conquer
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; and God gave him the grace.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Showed what a man could become. Amen.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; If he trust in God,
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; you don't have to see a vision. When you
[1:23:14] know God is God,
[1:23:18] you speak the word and believe it.
[1:23:23] No literature.
[1:23:25] Joshua didn't have no literature. He
[1:23:28] didn't have a book. He didn't take
[1:23:32] was the God that he was.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he understood that God
[1:23:40] was in the battle.
[1:23:43] I want you to know tonight.
[1:23:52] Hallelujah. I don't have to fight.
[1:23:57] He's done it all for me. He's done it
[1:24:00] all for you.
[1:24:02] You know what God showed me? I believe
[1:24:03] it was the Lord. I learned how to rest
[1:24:08] in the cliff of the rock.
[1:24:10] Hallelujah. Let the storm come,
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; but find your resting place.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; God is your battle.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; God is your warrior.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; God is your conqueror.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; You need to rest in him.

[1:24:49] when he was on earth.
[1:24:51] He conquered and possessed every gate
[1:24:54] the enemy had.
[1:24:57] The royal seed
[1:25:01] by the word
[1:25:04] conquered it.
[1:25:06] conquered the gate of of sickness for
[1:25:08] us.
[1:25:11] That's what he come to do.
[1:25:13] He remembered his sick people
[1:25:18] and the devil would tell you God is not
[1:25:20] mindful of your being sick.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; But he died on Calvary for your
[1:25:25] sickness.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what he come to do.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; He remembers sick people.
[1:25:34] He conquered that gate.
[1:25:36] You don't have to conquer it.
[1:25:39] He conquered it.
[1:25:42] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; The other men had to conquer their own
[1:25:44] gate.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; But you don't have to conquer.
[1:25:51] He already conquered.
[1:25:54] He conquered the gate of sickness.
[1:25:56] And what And what did he do when he
[1:25:59] conquered the gate of sickness?
[1:26:05] saying that he would whatever you ask on
[1:26:08] earth
[1:26:10] whatever you bound on earth
[1:26:14] bind it in heaven
[1:26:16] give us the key to the gate
[1:26:19] understand me he gave us the key to the
[1:26:22] gate
[1:26:26] it's funny it's strange
[1:26:29] I had a dream just last
[1:26:35] And God just answered my dream.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you,
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Jesus is the key. Jesus is the door.

[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; but your king is resisting.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; If you resist him

[1:28:20] through the third day he got up
[1:28:25] that he visited us?
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; And he said, "This promise

[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; promise,
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; set promise,

[1:28:52] said if I don't have the Holy Ghost yet,
[1:28:57] it's yours.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; It's yours for the asking.
[1:29:01] The devil comes and tell you
[1:29:04] it's not for you. He's a liar.
[1:29:08] Resist that.
[1:29:11] He say you're not worthy. forgive not
[1:29:15] for tell you you're not worth
[1:29:19] a gift
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; because the Holy Ghost
[1:29:25] I must merit

[1:29:37] says if you repent
[1:29:40] baptize in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:29:45] He says, "You shall receive the gift of
[1:29:47] the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:50] Put the word on the devil. Back him up
[1:29:53] in the
[1:29:55] don't let him steal your joy.
[1:30:00] Take your life from you.
[1:30:03] He will give you
[1:30:06] more than you wanted."
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; This is a Listen,
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; because they are of the natural sea.
[1:30:21] See, talking about Israel and all, they
[1:30:25] had to conquer their enemy.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; But God conquered the enemy for all of
[1:30:30] us.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; I don't know what it was like,
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; but when Jesus rose from the dead,
[1:30:45] And those graves were open.
[1:30:50] Amen.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; I don't know what it was like.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; But one of these old days,
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; I'll see it for myself.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Whether I go to the grave or
[1:31:06] not,
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; I know when he gather them
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; and when he called them,
[1:31:13] I'll be one in the number.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; And now we are more than conquerors.
[1:31:25] That's what he said.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Not, oh, I'm barely making it. We're
[1:31:29] more than conquerors.
[1:31:31] We'll just walk right up right into it
[1:31:33] as as an inheritance.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; He wants us to walk into it
[1:31:40] as an inheritance
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; more than conquerors.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Now we are dealing with defeated
[1:31:45] enemies.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; You think the devil got something? He is
[1:31:53] a lying roaring lion.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; He's toothless.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Toothless. No teeth.
[1:32:03] He has no authority.
[1:32:06] You give him. Hallelujah.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; He's already defeated.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; See, we forget.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; We forgot.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; He's already defeated.
[1:32:18] You have to defeat him. Jesus Christ
[1:32:21] defeated him.
[1:32:26] Hallelujah. Amen. Maybe you might have
[1:32:28] to remind him.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; You are defeated.
[1:32:35] Not by me.
[1:32:37] Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[1:32:43] If you want to get really personal, if
[1:32:45] you really want to get personal with
[1:32:47] him, let him know
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; who Jesus is to you.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; I said he's not only my redeemer,
[1:32:58] my husband.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I want you to know devil.
[1:33:06] We are one.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Nothing you can do.
[1:33:11] Stop the move of God.
[1:33:20] Amen. And you must believe that. I don't
[1:33:23] care how grim it looks.
[1:33:25] You may have a red sea in front of you.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; You may have a red sea in front of you.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; But God done,
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; God done conquered the sea already.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, absolutely.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; A bad storm come up and you trapped in
[1:33:46] your car.
[1:33:48] [Music]
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Speak to the storm.
[1:33:53] You act like the storm is your God.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; You're God of the storm.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; You are the God of the storm.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what Jesus was trying
[1:34:07] to tell him.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Be of little faith.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; You are the God of this storm.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Make this storm obey you.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Speak to the storm. Come on, somebody.
[1:34:21] Amen. Remember the storm?
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; Brother was in caught in the storm.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; And then the Holy Spirit
[1:34:33] was teaching him
[1:34:35] for his adoption. Y'all hear me?
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Speak to the storm.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; Whatever you say,
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; the storm will obey.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. That ain't just chicken food.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; That's for the eagles.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; When when when the devil comes in like a
[1:34:57] flood,
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; the spirit of the Lord will always lift
[1:35:01] up a standard.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we must get quiet.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; So God, we can hear the voice of God.
[1:35:11] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; He's going to work it out for you,
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; but he wants you to work it out.
[1:35:18] He wants to work it out through you.
[1:35:20] That's the best way.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Everything is defeated.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "I wish I was twice my
[1:35:31] size."
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Now maybe I'll feel twice as good.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; We are disputing with the conquered
[1:35:40] enemy.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Disputing
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; with the conquered enemy.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Arguing with the conquered enemy. No
[1:35:47] wonder Paul could say when they was
[1:35:51] building a block to chop his head off,
[1:35:53] he said, "Oh death,
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; where's your stain?
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Oh grave,
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; show me where you can make me squirmer
[1:36:03] and scream.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Grave, where is your victory?
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; You think you'll mold me out there?
[1:36:14] I point you to the empty one who who won
[1:36:18] over there.
[1:36:22] I am in him
[1:36:24] and he'll raise me up at the last day.
[1:36:29] A defeated enemy.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm almost done. Royal seed
[1:36:35] of Abraham. Now, the natural could not
[1:36:38] point to that.
[1:36:42] But the royal sea can conquer
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; already conquered.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; For he had gone before us
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; and conquered every great gate for us.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, he has. Amen.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Let me tell y'all something. Now, this
[1:36:57] is came to my mind.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; When I was a boy,
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; I was in the seventh grade.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; And I had three guys jump me. They beat
[1:37:07] me.
[1:37:09] mistaken identity.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; They threw me on the ground. They kicked
[1:37:15] me. They stomped me. Whatever they could
[1:37:17] do to hurt me, they did it.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; But they didn't know I had a brother.
[1:37:27] Hallelujah. And my brother
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; caught each and every one of them
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; and conquered them.
[1:37:38] Amen.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; And then after he conquered them,
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; he called me.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; He told one guy, "Don't you move till I
[1:37:47] come back."
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; We about 15 minutes away from that
[1:37:51] place.
[1:37:52] 15 minutes away. When I got back down
[1:37:55] there, that guy was still there
[1:37:58] shaking in his shoes.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; And I wasn't a violent man. Even though
[1:38:03] I had blood streaming down from my face,
[1:38:07] I believe that was the time my brother
[1:38:08] got so angry with me
[1:38:11] cuz I was feeling sorry for the guy.
[1:38:17] You know, he's crying, his nose running,
[1:38:21] all of that. He said, "You better beat
[1:38:23] him." My brother
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; told me I need to beat this guy.
[1:38:32] I swung at the guy
[1:38:34] deliberately not wanting to hit him.
[1:38:38] My brother was about ready to beat me
[1:38:39] after that.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; He was so mad with me. Instead of
[1:38:46] punching me, he punched the guy again.
[1:38:48] Boom.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; Oh my god. Y'all understand what I'm
[1:38:54] saying?
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; See, the battle had already been fought.
[1:38:59] The victory had already been won.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; The guy had already been conquered.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; What was I supposed to do?
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; He was already defeated.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; And I was satisfied.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; They never messed with me again. Never
[1:39:17] ever ever
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; bothered me again.
[1:39:25] And it's sad to say all three of them
[1:39:26] died young.
[1:39:29] right after high school
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; and often wonder sometime
[1:39:35] what that was all about. Let me hurry
[1:39:38] up.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; I'm almost done.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; The royal seed now the natural seed
[1:39:43] could not point to that.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; But the royal seed can conquer already
[1:39:47] conquered.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; For he has gone before us and conquered
[1:39:52] every gate for us.
[1:39:56] Are you hearing it?
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing it?
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; He conquered every gate.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; That means no matter what you're going
[1:40:05] through,
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; it means no matter where Satan's
[1:40:09] strongholds are,
[1:40:12] he already conquered.
[1:40:16] Amen. Not only did he conquer sickness,
[1:40:20] he conquered sickness, he conquered
[1:40:22] temptation,
[1:40:24] he conquered every enemy, he conquered
[1:40:26] death, he conquered hell.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He conquered the grave and
[1:40:32] rose up again. and 2,000 years. Here he
[1:40:36] stands among us
[1:40:39] afternoon
[1:40:41] identifying himself,
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; the mighty conqueror.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Do y'all hear what I'm saying? Amen.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; When brother Brandon was here,
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; I'm done. But when brother Brandon was
[1:40:55] here,
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; it wasn't the man that was the
[1:40:57] conqueror.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; It was Christ Jesus who was the
[1:41:01] conqueror. His
[1:41:05] job, William Brandham's job
[1:41:08] was to be able to reflect
[1:41:12] the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; being alive
[1:41:20] as the mighty conqueror.
[1:41:24] How blessed we are
[1:41:27] and we know the devil is already
[1:41:30] conquered.
[1:41:33] That's right. I don't care what you're
[1:41:35] going through.
[1:41:38] The devil is defeated.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; And you have to remind that devil, he's
[1:41:43] defeated.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; Just like Joshua
[1:41:49] needed needed that grant.
[1:41:52] Needed that grant and he didn't worry
[1:41:55] about it.
[1:41:58] See, when you know the devil is
[1:41:59] defeated, you don't worry.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; You let go and let God have his way.
[1:42:10] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Let me read this
[1:42:13] last quote so you
[1:42:16] he said coming from who do you say this
[1:42:18] is?
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said it like this.
[1:42:23] There's only one thing that you can put
[1:42:25] confidence in
[1:42:30] and that's the word
[1:42:33] and the word is God.
[1:42:37] Get that revelation. Amen. If that
[1:42:40] revelation could truly strike you in
[1:42:42] your soul,
[1:42:48] whenever you need God, we go back to the
[1:42:51] word. Hallelujah.
[1:42:54] And he says, "And the word anointed
[1:42:58] makes the Messiah.
[1:43:00] [Applause]
[1:43:05] The anointed word of the hour.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; Beautiful. They miss it. The word.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me go on with this. This
[1:43:16] other one here
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; is still the word.
[1:43:21] The word is God.
[1:43:23] God in every age
[1:43:26] has allotted much of his word.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; And in there, watch what he said. Did he
[1:43:34] sent a prophet
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; and the word of the Lord comes to the
[1:43:38] prophet?
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; The prophet reveals it to the audience
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; and the audience believes it
[1:43:50] quite understand what he's saying.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you believe it, that
[1:43:57] puts you into the bride.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.

[1:56:57] [Music]
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; We have a testimony from brother Rashid.
[1:57:02] Amen.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; God bless you church. Um it's a pretty
[1:57:13] quick testimony. um past couple of
[1:57:16] months of my life. Um we started a
[1:57:19] little Bible study just a couple of
[1:57:21] people here and uh we've been reading
[1:57:23] our Bibles like every Tuesday and Sunday
[1:57:26] and then sometimes on Friday uh you know
[1:57:29] just you know reading the word and
[1:57:31] having a good time and I was really
[1:57:33] thinking because I look at my life and
[1:57:36] I'm seeing all these tests and trials
[1:57:38] and all these different things come
[1:57:40] about my way. all these lies go in my
[1:57:42] head and I really think I thought to
[1:57:44] myself like God why is this happening to
[1:57:46] me? I feel very lost, you know. And um I
[1:57:49] realized that this these few months that
[1:57:52] I've been getting trials and tests is
[1:57:55] the months that I've actually grown the
[1:57:57] most in my faith. And I've learned
[1:58:00] literally more than I've ever learned in
[1:58:02] these few months. And I'm just realizing
[1:58:04] it now. And um now that I think about
[1:58:07] it, I just want to thank God for giving
[1:58:09] me those trials and allowing me to, you
[1:58:12] know, be where I am today. Because if I
[1:58:14] hadn't, you know, have had that Bible
[1:58:16] study, if I hadn't have had that lesson
[1:58:18] that I've learned and just in everyday
[1:58:21] life, I wouldn't be here where I am
[1:58:23] today. And so I just want to give God
[1:58:25] the glory for that.
[1:58:37] Yeah. Uh we have a special meeting this
[1:58:39] weekend with brother Ben
[1:58:43] um Saturday and Sunday. Saturday at 6:00
[1:58:45] p.m. and Sunday our regular service.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; So as we are getting this message, we're
[1:58:50] going to sing this song.
