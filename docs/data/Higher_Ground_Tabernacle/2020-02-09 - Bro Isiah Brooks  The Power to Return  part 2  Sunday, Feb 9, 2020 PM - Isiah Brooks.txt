further Troi to maybe we need to check and see if we have some kind of mole something coming through because every time I get in the pulpit I have runny nose the other night I walked out and everything stopped so we might need them yeah sir I think so yes sir [Music] having children here we don't need that for sure you love the Lord you know I tell you what I so enjoyed that as we stand let's go right into the Word of God glad to see the Columbus here amen I know the enemy fought you this morning but that's okay brother you was here yeah we all have those moments I know what it's like when you're tired in the air-conditioned everything is just right it is what it is ah but I tell you I I admire people who really press their way out to the house of God in spite of the things that they may have the hurdles the things that they have to go through you know it is this time that I have my most babbling I guess in the evening time because you know you expect people if they really enjoy the word they come back I know that's how it is at a restaurant in the natural sense they come back and I don't know about you but I've been times I've been sleepy but it didn't stop me from eating and so you know we we look at the natural and the spiritual and that's why I say some of the things I say because I know some people have excuses but not all and and my thing is is that prioritize things they must do that put God first everybody I love the Lord and I know it's quite difficult sometimes for everybody because everybody is going through things and everybody have difficulty I was thinking I'm mrs. to Naomi is she okay okay I'll call her amen I figure she must be working or something but God knows amen in it's always good to see her sometimes I'm not here to sew so that's how it works sometimes Amen she misses me and I miss her but by the grace of God we want to ask you to turn with us to Genesis 8 and Ecclesiastes 1 Genesis 8 22 we're gonna pick up where we left off by God's grace Genesis 8 22 while the earth remaineth seedtime and harvest and cold and heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not cease now we're dealing with seasons and we're talking about the the circuit that the earth is on and how it moves around the Sun everybody have their scientific idea on how it all works but I'm just gonna go by way I see the Bible talk talking about it one more scripture Ecclesiastes 1 2 through 11 you love the Lord I how can you how can I say it when it comes to trials and temptations and things I know that as a prophet of God say the greatest battle is fought with in your mind and when the Lord brought that through a brother branham we realized that is no joke you know it's you almost rather have a physical battle at least you know where you're at you know where your opponent is but sometimes this mind the battle that we have in our mind it's can be overwhelming and therefore you know we must at all times put on the whole armor of God you got to put on the helmet of faith because without that faith believing all of God's Word Satan has already defeated you and once he conquers they had the body is done with so we realized by God's grace we're in a tremendous battle but we must keep focus understanding we're on a journey and that's the way it was with Abraham he was on a journey let me go ahead on with the scripture so we can have you sit down Ecclesiastes 1 beginning at the second verse vanity of vanities saith the preacher vanity of vanities all is vanity what prophet half a man of all his labour which he taketh Under the Sun one generation passes away and another generation cometh but the earth abideth for ever the Sun also arises and the Sun goeth down and hey thenis to his place where he arose the wind go toward the south turn it about unto the north a whirl it about continually and the wind returned it again according to his circuits remember returning all the rivers run into the sea yet the sea is not full unto the place from whence the river cometh thither they return again all things are full of labor man cannot utter it the eye is not satisfied with seeing nor the ear filled with hearing the things that have been is that which shall be and that which is done is that which shall be done and there is no new thing under the Sun is there anything ware of it may be said see this is new it had been already of Oh which was before us there is no remembers of former days neither shall there be any remembers of things that are to come with those that shall come after let us pray father we come before you we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us we thank you Lord for all that you've done for us those beautiful songs that you sang this evening Lord to touch my heart touch my soul songs of Hope songs of faith songs of praise songs of worship Lord we thank your father for ordaining those songs to be sung tonight truly blessed my so bless each and every heart tonight give us words to say and we will speak them for you Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated so we see by God's grace that we're going home this is the whole point about what God has done we can see many times about what Jesus did on Calvary and you know as denominational we didn't understand revelation so we thought that all Jesus came to do was just to save us but Jesus came to redeem us now we didn't even understand personally what Redemption draws and that means to bring back or buy back that which was already the owners and so we realized by God's grace that even though we're coming into the knowledge of who we are we had no idea that we had an existence somewhere somehow in the mind of God now we we don't understand how God see things and how God does things in the way that he he does them because God is infinite God is eternal and not evolves with God in God's thoughts they're perfected thoughts they don't did not block builders are building blocks they actually come into mind in a way that God can understand everything at one time understand the body is so intricate that the systems of the of the natural body tool even man and scientists are trying to find out how it all works they're even trying to build androids and things of that nature to see if they themselves can create a man and it is amazing how men tried to disregard God but yet and still they like to be like him they want to be God think about some of the great men of oh how they wanted to be God you say Hitler you said you know Pharaoh you talked about Herod and all these great so-called men who thought they were God and my question is where are they now but the God in which we serve amen has so designed this thing in such a perfect way that nothing is spilled nothing is lost nothing amen is forgotten everything is remembered the only thing that is forgotten is our sins once they're placed underneath the blood of Jesus Christ Solomon was a wise man and he talks about things because how he came to conclude that there is nothing new Under the Sun I don't know it's not like his life was Infinite his life was in time and he was born and he died but in all of his research he came to one conclusion and that conclusion was to fear God and he keep his Commandments because Solomon knew that somehow though we lead this world we had to return and we had to stand before God that was going to judge us so we realized Amen that even after this life is not all over you're going to have to stand before God in a way that either you holy you're righteous or you're filthy you're going to stand before God one way or the other I shall thank God that God did not leave his plan up for chance this salvation of God is not chance it is perfect it is so designed that God knows exactly the moment that you're going to be saved he knows exactly the moment that you're going to come excuse me into the knowledge of your salvation understand by God's grace when we talk about redeem we talk about redemption we talk about belonging to God we have been God's property before we got here so let's let's go on by God's grace I said all of those things so that you can understand that everything is controlled by God not Satan everything is controlled by God Satan has no control even when God Satan does anything he must first get the permission from God you understand me even though Satan no doubt has thought in his mind that he was outsmarted God but we find out that God was using him for his own purpose let me let me move on so that's why the scripture says it's not by power it's not by might but by my spirit saith the LORD right and Paul says power make your calling and election sure see when you make it sure that means that nothing can break it that means nothing can stop it no matter how many times you fall no matter how many times you come short no matter how many mind battles you have you are sure of your salvation it is like a revelation that can't be moved it cannot be moved or it cannot be altered it is steadfast it is an anchor night like the bouncer we have an anchor of the soul so you got to understand when you sure remember I talked about Walt Disney this morning and I said huh Walt Disney had that sure thing I'm gifted if you don't even believe I'm gifted guilty gifted you understand me I have something in me that keeps declaring to me that I can do this you understand me and in a book I said no matter how many times he failed he kept moving until the inspiration struck the very time that God had ordained see that was for Walt Disney nobody could have done the Mickey Mouse but Walt Disney and from that point on he became a billionaire even to his death is that all right see you got to be sure of it no matter what your heart says Amen you understand me because I was in organization denomination they tried to claim me you need to come back to the place you were saved but I knew a word that I was not saved by an organization I wasn't saved in the organization the only way only place I could be saved that would be in Christ y'all hear me so it's nothing in me to return back to that organization like there is nothing in Moses to return back and then to Egypt once he left Egypt the understanding he knew he was on a mission he knew he was on a journey and he was being lured by the pillar of fire and every one of us are on a journey remember I said this morning though we be cut differently we're all stones cut from the same rock and we have different cuts so therefore we can't compare ourselves one with another we are precious in the sight of God is that right even according to Moloch I'll fall he said I will make up my jewels without just any kind of stone we're jewels in that day I will make up my jewels now I'm saying all these things is because the jewels of God has never been lost hallelujah he has always kept his jewels in a safe place call it the Lamb's Book of Life if you want to but he's always knew where his jewels were and he had an appointed time to gather them is that right so you can understand the Bible says that Israel would be scattered abroad because of their transgression but God says I'm going to have mercy on them is that right even david says lord if your people if they should humble themselves if they'd to turn toward the temple if they should pray he said Father forgive them see that's the where and when when God began to put pressure on Israel through Hitler Mussolini and Stalin amen they didn't know that prophecy was being fulfilled they didn't know that God was getting ready to take them back to Jerusalem but they had to return because God said they must be there when the Messiah comes yes you time saying see God put that hardship and Bela Benton called it the tender hand of Jehovah now if that's the tender hand you do not want to get him upset yeah the tender hand of Jehovah drove them back and you remember in that time in 1946 I believe it was 48 and then during that period of time they asked the Jews why did you come did you come back to Jerusalem's and die and they said no we come to see the Messiah now think about it of people who was almost driven to extinction but yet there is something in their heart that made them know no matter what we've got to suffer Messiah has promised and we're going back home to see the Messiah remember I was told in this morning about Jacob and when Jacob Rossler and Penuel you know 10 UL means the face of God it means amen that that here was a man coming into a place where he would not only see the face of God but the vision of God now it sounds like this is what happened in our day because when the several angels came and made that mysterious cloud it was the face of God not only did that face of God all those seven angels come down but it gave us a vision it made us see where we will hear it see everybody's thinking that the rapture is coming is that right even in Elijah's day you had the false prophets or the school of prophets who knew that that day was coming to rapture even though that they weren't part of it they knew that religion was going to be caught up hallelujah and so is it in this day we know that there's coming a rapture hallelujah so it was the face of God or that sees God you see everybody don't see God and they look at that picture like something's wrong with it there's nothing wrong with the picture even though you don't acknowledge it as the face of God it is anyway hallelujah even the prophet of God said that's my lord now he would know that because he was caught up now a lot of people want to argue about it but that's alright because it was at this place when Jacobs name was changed hallelujah and it was at this place your name has changed you're no longer call the church you called the bye hallelujah you love the Lord now in the message Amen returned in Jubilee Amen he says I think of a person ever is sure in their heart and has something that faith can ankle on they should never cease no matter how many times they're defeated they should continue on you understand me it doesn't matter how many times you're defeated get up the Bible says the just man falls seven times in a day and he gets up see there's a scripture that I love it I love the scripture as a 6111 says for as the earth bring forth her bud and as the garden causes things that are sown in it to spring forth so the Lord would cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations hallelujah so what are you saying think about life in a flower God causes it the lily he doesn't have to spin or toil God brings it God gives him the life God gives him the strength God causes it to happen who educates the chickadee the little chicken in the shell who educates him who tells him you've got to pick your way out God causes it hallelujah and guess what God makes the shell thin enough so that he can crack it hallelujah but don't you crack it he'll die hallelujah and see that's how it is you and I must understand that in order to bring forth the birth that God is calling this fall we've got an answer with an angel we've got the whole Lord the God until he blesses us all help us Jesus see God is causing his thing what makes you yearn for God what makes you not quit why you won't just quit oh I'm tired I'm gonna quit and every time you come to that God says where you going where are you going what you gonna do is there anything out there for you nothing sorry your own but God said I never leave you nor will I forsake you and somewhere somehow you get like Samson in your bedroom and says I'm tired of the Philistines hallelujah Lord let me die in battle you understand me so that's the way it goes you know because we talk about the power of return you can't do it brother Bell tells us he said everything to make a rapture is in the seed it in you except the seed be in you it's not by your power it's the seed power it's the power of the seed it's the power of the juror all we need to do is get in the presence of God and let the German be quicker hallelujah I marvel at nature once seeded song but you get an ear or two years or three ears of corn and all of those chords was in that one seed hallelujah and though they're beyond the same chuckle on the same car not every corn is the same size not even every corn is the same shade of yellow or whatever color it is they diverse but they're saying can I say it like this but they're from the same blood save the life of the favorite corn that went in the ground real cause is it the blue real causes it to come up scientists still don't know how it works they can make everything look so so so natural but they can never discover life why because God is life you understand me so I'm coming to the place to say that if Christ is in you cast your down your burdens cash your worries away it is he christ in you that is falling you that is making you that is developing you into the person that you are now you said brother what do you say I'm saying we're coming around again that same ride that the prophet of God saw the first that that's saying Elvis's bride that lost before him he saw everything in preview he saw even Miss America and you know we are in that day time right now right oh she's rockin and she's rolling and she's doing all kinds of filthy business to to what rock and roll and to in the name of Christ but it was at that time God was bringing another bride around somebody help me here it was at that time that God was shaping up a virgin bride unto Him y'all better hear me listen what he says then and all at once I heard it coming again and coming up this side come the same bride that went around this away here cutting them little ladies again each one of them was dressed in the National Guard from where they come from like Switzerland and Germany hallelujah and so forth each one wearing that kind of God all along here just exactly like that one at the first and here they are here they was coming walking onward Christian soldiers marching as to war and when they all passed by the interview stand where are we standing so that you understand the question was there are some people who don't have long hair that's only in this world I don't know how it's going to look but it all will be long it will be everything that Satan put on us thorns thistles whatever you want to call it everything that's bad that this world calls to come upon us because of the fall will be taken away it will be God don't make no mistakes so we go on and I'm not saying that somebody said that I'm just saying you and I must understand that that that that returns he what was it they were marching wrong with Christian soldiers marching as to war and when they are passed by the preview and stand where we were standing you said what brother works I'm gonna tell you something I'll never forget when Joseph Hamrick was preaching here and here he was preaching about revelation in the second that war would last why we should fight and Jesus coming in on his horse hallelujah I'm right there all of a sudden I fell into a vision I saw myself and it seemed like the camera just zoom right in on me and I can tell you like this my hair was a little different than what it is now I'm not saying it wasn't curly but it was because I have no problem curly I love you're not I'm saying I have no problem with where God has made me but I know one thing it was blowing in the wind that's what I remember yeah I'm serious it was on my shoulder which my hair in the natural could do that when a user have some but nevertheless you know I saw me and I'm telling you something folks let me tell you something the colors the color of skin color is so different than what we will perceive it because I'm gonna tell you something all of nature has perverted everybody what what we call light is not right there what we call black and brown the color is so different it's a perfection of right a perfection of black a perfection of brown whatever color you are all sin has taken away I'm telling you there ain't no braces in heaven teeth were perfect I know what I saw y'all I know some people don't want to believe me but I'm telling you I saw and and all I can tell you is that I saw I saw colors that really kind of hard to describe but one thing I know for certain when sin is taken out from us will with such a beautiful people amen and I'm telling you everything is in its perfect order we're coming again you don't believe me but the Bible said that even when Jesus rose from the dead they couldn't recognize him why he was in his glorified body come on somebody so you said well what are you saying see I got to make it I'm part of that you said I'm saying there is no listen there is no and I can tell you something I see the color white and there's no way to describe it because it was such a pure white my sisters I saw my sisters amen imitating the color the color was soul I can't explain it but everything there was no blemishes there maybe on God would judge me for what I'm saying tonight and do you think how rich my soul salvation to tell you a lie I'm telling you what I saw none of y'all worth that I'm not here to impress nobody ain't nobody here worth me losing my soul you understand me so what I'm trying to tell you is that what we go through here is nothing nothing can compare to the glory that shall be revealed in us nothing hallelujah you love the Lord oh it's the truth they passed by and gestured they started going right up into the sky this other one went up to a brink at the heel and whit down like that these started marching right up in the sky and when they went to marching I noticed a couple little girls in the back looking like they might be or some kind of foreign girl like Sweden and Switzerland or somewhere and they started to look around and don't don't get don't get out of that step see and you got to say well what do you mean brother see that's what's happening we're right in this message and people are getting out of step hallelujah that moving away from the Holy Ghost and moving away from the very thing that had caused them to go up this is not a religion this is not a cult this is not some man-made thing this is God from heaven farming and shaping individuals into his very image his image hallelujah that's why I say you know when you predestinated something in you tells you when you right and wrong you don't even need education to know when you ride alone give you God gives you the Holy Ghost immediately you know what's right and wrong right from wrong excuse me is that right that's exactly right the prophet of God tells us when he was in Africa and he began to preach and those natives who was naked nobody told him they were naked but the Holy Ghost came and they went running out covering themselves hallelujah when you got the Holy Ghost you don't have to preach on clothing don't wear this don't do this don't with no he's got the real thing he will teach you how to dress he'll make you feel uncomfortable nobody has to tell you that hallelujah is this okay I want you to know we're going around we're coming right we're coming we're the last age we're the last one and we're moving around the circle now we're moving around the corner right we're not in a straight line and we're moving around the corner and our next move is up hallelujah everybody else has been previewed everybody else is gone before the charge how do and God is already condemned them literacy is condemned hallelujah she's received the mark of the beast but it was at that time the prophet of God thought oh my god is this all my ministry has test has brought forth is this it I think he said inherit in a distance a little marching coming on onward Christian soldiers marching as to war remember I shared everything has to come everything has to return and you see this whole thing after the fall we went to the dust because God said since you did this you must return to the dust but because of Jesus Christ God has come in and bound the breech you understand me before the breach everything was holy everything was righteous everything was pure but because of the fall amen because of the fall amen there was a breach there was a gap where man and God could no longer commune but because of Calvary hallelujah because of Jesus Christ because of God's grace given to us now the bridge had been been the breach have been bridged hallelujah now we can cross over now we can finish the course of going home hallelujah is that right it was kind of like Jacob when he was in that position when he saw he didn't know how the breach was going to be be brought together but he didn't see that God was working on both ends hallelujah God has softer he thought if I give Jake if I give he saw all of this and given that maybe his heart would be softened but what he did not realize was God that had God had already softened he saw his heart and he saw was ready to receive it now I showed you by God's grace it's got a return everything everything you look in the Bible return return return every time Israel fell he says return return return amen you see people who even now they want to return to the old paths right and then they have the old cowboy days let's go back no no no I'm not talking about that I'm talking about this hallelujah God don't go back as he goes forward hallelujah and we'll Road our journey back to Eden hallelujah he said all brother what are you trying to say when the seals were open we came to understand that God has brought us back to either you gotta believe that that means that if I speak if I am a true son and daughter Adam which is Christ amen I can speak it and it has to obey me that's the realm God wants us to operate in not like fallen sons and daughters we're not just sinners saved by grace that used to be but when we got born again we're not born sinners anymore we're born Saints the sailor was the old man the saint is a newly way back hallelujah is that right think about it I'm gonna try to hurry up because we got communion think about it I'm rushing a little bit that's okay but think about it when Adam and Eve excuse me we Cain and Abel offered unto the Lord in the message glorified Jesus he tells us that listen he said those both of those boys was finding or trying to way look they were looking for the the way back what did they want to do they wanted to get back into the Garden of Eden they knew that sin kicked them out and they wanted a revelation they needed something because you see you think that King was just trying to be a smart aleck Oh King was trying his best to please God that's why he was so upset he put all of his strength into pleasing God and he was rejected you understand me there everything he knew to do he did did you see that's not how the house of God is built the house of God from that moment was built upon revelation that's why Jesus said Amen the gates of hell shall not prevail against this it is built upon Revelation and it started with Abel and when Abel called the revelation it was blood that has been God's method of communicating with his people from the Garden of Eden has always been revelation it will always be revelation his cries revealing himself in you and through you that's how you know you're saved when you know that you've been changed hallelujah you're not the man you used to be you're not the woman you used to be I'm not that man I may not be what I want to be a ought to be but I'm on my way see that's where God is working and you got to realize you can't quit you can't give up I don't care if he gets stagnated you get here you get down into yourself everybody goes through these little valleys I go through them you know sometimes you think and you stand the next thing around you look like something's going wrong but guess what all of these things are ordained by God God don't look like an itchy was it old and I didn't know that I didn't realize they were gonna do this no he knows it one thing I love about God he loves on you even when you failed it still loves on you and I love that about God you wanna me God don't care I think about that woman at Simon's house how God went there the Lord Jesus went there and let that lady just wash his feet and everything else is doing what kind of woman you see but he never saw a prostitute he saw a daughter see that's how God looks when he finds you he doesn't see you as this outward share he looked beyond that and he's listening to your heart and see that representation and he he handles you accordingly go come on somebody see and you know nobody knew that that Simon had a party so that Mary could come that was Mary's party she he didn't know she she couldn't afford one so Simon had it and she came in there free honey and got the benefits of the party younger me so you see a lot of things God would do just to make his word come to pass and God told Mary since you've done this your name will go out and fame somebody help me is it right everybody preaches about her think about it King as a believer he is trying to find grace with God and came built an altar and the altar is a church a place of worship and King built an altar not only that Cain brought full and offering and their sacrifice and not only that became worship God a worship the Lord hallelujah is that right listen he said you can belong to a church you can go to the altar and pray pay your tithes and and duties appeal duties and tithing to the church make spiritual sacrifices kneel on your knees confess your faith in God and still be lost oh my god I really look at Lucifer the devil sometime and I say you know what you had a right you had a way you could have entered in if you wouldn't have been so stubborn in Cain God told him if you do what your brother Abel did you'll be a ruler over him and he was too dumb no forgive me he just didn't get it he had no revelation of what it was you see that's what's wrong with people when they're so intellectual they have to process it and it is not logical they make it makes no sense to them and they refuse it and don't even understand that they own the inspiration of the devil faith is not logic face can faith cannot be processed faith is but you know I look at this cuz every time I hear the court like this you know people's like oh can that be me oh it can't be you when you hear a quote like that you reject it yeah people don't say when you hear a quote you can do this you can do this you can do this and you can do this and still be lost that's not talking to you is it I don't hear that not for me I hear that for others maybe but it when it comes to me it doesn't ring the bell it moves on yes sir so that makes you know who you are but if you can suck that in like oh that's me you need a birth or some increase of faith he was trying to find life again he was trying to get back to the Garden of Eden but you gotta realize he could not go back there because that was not his origin his origin came by way of the serpent and not by the Son of God only Abel could go back because he came from the Son of God who was Adam you understand me that's what Judas could not go to to Pentecost he could not receive Pentecost because that's not where he came from understand Pentecost was not for the servants it was for the sons if you was a slave and he was born under the master in other words if you were born under denominationalism got him me let me put it this way so you can understand me if you were born a Baptist born a Pentecostal born and you were born you understand me under that seed there's no way you can go free that's that's Leviticus there's no way you can go free that's God didn't give us a denomination of seed God gave us a seed of him himself so Jubilee was for us because we would use spiritual Jews therefore when the word the bell rang when we heard the trumpet and then we could go free but we were going to we were going back home back to the place we came from see everything has to return back to where it come from is that right and let me say like there's a verse I confess headach to come by spiritual revelation it had to who told him where did he get it from see is something about the seed of God God will always give you the revelation you need to make it always it ain't a base about how good you are right oh how much fader well I got no Thomas didn't have much at all and yet God revealed himself to Thomas y'all see what it's election I'm working with God deals with election and the elect now let me hurry up before I forget because I can't I'm not gonna be able to finish all this anyway it's not like I'm anyway upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it what that little thing that you sure of no matter what you know that's why I put it this way that's why when when all these crazy doctrines came through in my time it never swept me off my feet you know why because there was a surety there was something that I knew that I did not have to be a part of that to be bribed or to be saved I can name the doctrines but it's not important you know all of those doctrines basically have ran shipwreck but you've got to come to meet Jesus Christ for yourself you got to have that sure thing no matter how many mistakes I make how short I come I'm still the bride of Jesus right not the power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord right so you gotta understand listen let me tell you something there is no doctrine around here that is going to influence me and tell me that I'm not the Bride of Christ you understand me about no doctrine out here told me that you know who told me Jesus himself hallelujah now understand this now so you don't get confused because your bride doesn't mean you his wife a wife Amen must have intimacy right because remember Mary was espoused to Joseph she was only white potentially she was his bride but when you out his wife something happens that's why he says the bride has made herself ready and then you see over in the other chapter of Revelation she's become life but if I all God I'm right and by but you being tested remember the little country girl throwing out the water in the backyard there was somewhere there watching her all the time the Holy Ghost is watching you all the time to see whether you measure up on whether you're flirting with with someone else are you being true to him somebody help me it's the truth and you and I must understand because you've been chosen oh I'm the brother cousin everybody I'm the bride but being bride is not just the finished product there must be a union Rebecca will supply but she met Harvick and there's a union you got to be United United time and science this is what we've been trying to tell people these virtues the fire of God must come and burn all this trash out of our lives you got a whiff li let him do it because God is a gentleman hallelujah he comes and he burns all these things and then you know what happened he begins to build himself in you hallelujah God can't sit on his throne if there's filth he can't do it like you've heard me saying God don't share he's not a deduct that the heart is this heart is not a duplex so you and I must understand listen this is not hard people it really isn't because it's not your work it's his work you don't have to wrestle with it it ain't about you is about him the thing is what we need to learn how to do is says Lord not my will but thine be done every day every moment of the day we ought to say Lord not my will but thine be done and the more you allow yourself to surrender to him the more he gets it in a place where he would completely fill you with himself am i speaking something that I don't know about he told the prophet of God you've got to be more sincere don't you know even with the Holy Ghost you have the ability to fight huh remember brother Branham had the Holy Ghost and God told him if you don't move away when I tell you to move there's a man coming around there and he's gonna measure the tree and measure everything and he's gonna you're gonna end up fighting him if you don't move at this point in time do you think the Prophet had the Holy Ghost the air he had it but the Holy Ghost is telling you your virtue and everything else is gonna be tested right here if you don't move and go out west you gonna fight this man even showed him how he was gonna beat him up huh but that's not the character he wasn't finish test the test he went through hallelujah come out it's the truth in him he had to be tested he had to be tried he had to learn how to be God's voice no matter what how many of us wouldn't walk keep walking but Lord I got a plane to catch keep walking how many of us would have been submissive to that voice like that knowing we were going to miss our flight he told him don't always did the Indian Africa which one he was supposed to go to but he failed to go Billy Paul says daddy you better obey the age of the Lord he didn't do it he count amoeba and he almost died what was he doing being trained sometimes we mess up and we don't do what God said doing he allow an affliction or something to strike us and immediately when it happens we know why it happens and all he's doing is thanking us and telling us the next time do it the way I say do it that's God why he's perfecting us he's bringing us into the place we should have been before the fall we were there you don't remember I don't either but we were there when because we are there we are turning back into the very image that God we needed Jesus we needed Jesus amen that would guarantee us another body he's sin was judged and he became our sin that we might become the righteousness of God hallelujah oh my let me let me let me let me let me say these things and I'm gonna I'm gonna go ahead and move on to everything must return come back to its original state come back to the place it was born remember we we hear about the the Joseph's story little Bethlehem and here was Herod says no I want everybody to go back to their homeland where they were born and we're gonna take up taxes it was cruel it wasn't like they had a plane or jet it wasn't like they had an air-conditioner car a man here was married almost like nine months pregnant whatever time she was she was full enough to be dis comfortable riding on a donkey in Jerusalem from that from from Jerusalem to Bethlehem around the mountains and everything is bumpity bump bump bump right fees right out there could've robbed him everything put them in harm's way but God had to get them to Bethlehem own somebody help me I'm about ready to scream and shout maybe this is something you don't really know but my point is God had to turn them around when they didn't even know what God was doing you understand me it looked cruel it looked hard why would God do this for us to us but what was waiting on her was a manger that had already been built you said built yes it was in the wall it was a cave in the wall it wasn't a little shack built out of straw and tick or whatever it was in the wall but that that that that particular manger was meant for Jesus Christ to be born in no other manger because it was written in the scripture out of Bethlehem see you say well brothers I don't let me tell y'all something this is what I try to tell people you in a place you didn't know your gonna ever be there but when God takes you to a place there's something he's got for you there's a turning point there's something God is doing but sometimes people fail to see it because everything don't go smooth it will not go smooth when God does anything is always the rough way it's always the harder way but in that hard way if we can open our eyes and see what God is doing for us spiritually it will turn you around and let me say it God took Joseph and Mary there so that Mary could good birth to Jesus and that's why God brings you into a mess sometime just so that he can be born in you in you but you got to come back to the place she was birth come back to your homeland come back to this place Amen that God made birth himself in you right so I'm gonna leave that right there there you got a return why because even larger ministry was the ministry of return and he larger returns five times right and so you got to understand his ministry it's it's what we cut what I call the ministry of resurrection because in his ministry there was a resurrections taking place hmm and we understand that the Ministry of Elijah is the ministry of Jesus Christ the spirit of Elijah is Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ comes in this day to do what bring a resurrection now here is the old testament saying that get up out of the ground they go into the that the dimension under the altar but it ain't done yet they must return they have to return but they cannot return until we complete our work you understand me they cannot be completed without us they cannot go back home until we have been established as the life of God right and then when we go up we stay up there for three and a half years having a wonderful time with Jesus I'm gonna sit at the Welcome Table but that ain't my home and neither it is yours is that right we must return back to the earth where it all started but it will be a new earth you said all brothers I don't know about that yes remember when the Dove left the ark the dog came back to the heart because because the still was water on the earth but when that water basse wouldn't settle down and and she came back with her olive leave and they let us stay there for seven more days and sent her back out you know his male and female right she didn't leave there by herself these two were one and so they go out and don't return hi back to a new Rob back to a new earth back to a place they had never seen before everything was fresh everything looked like it was set just for the dog all unclean things were done away with huh so is it this new world that we're coming back the same world the same earth but a different world you understand me it we must return but the only way we can return is that we were with him before the foundation of the world ain't no use of being worried I don't think you'll find corn in the cornfield worried about bringing forth corn right you know when cows have babies they don't go to the doctor they don't get a checkup what makes them know how to do it it's something in them right you and I must understand that if you got that thing in you which is Christ you don't have to worry I know it gets hard sometimes sometimes we get so disappointed maybe it's just me maybe it's just me I'm the only one I guess but I'm gonna tell you something life is full of disappointments many of the flexions are the righteous but God delivered them out of all of them hmm and you and I must understand if you don't trust God who you gonna trust who you gonna lean on I wish I could tell you that that revelation how can I say it without saying it wrong then let's just put it this way election got you covered because election is what brings grace to you election is what brings mercy to you election is what brings forgiveness to you without that you'd be just like everybody else election is what opens your eyes you understand me it's all God is what I'm trying to tell you but let me say it like this in closing so we can get into our communion if you are truly elected you're moving right now by the Spirit of God you understand me whatever God is doing in this hour you're part of it and if you are elected no matter how short you come your earnest desire is to do the perfect will of God that's what I claim to be the Holy Ghost if your earnest desire is to do the perfect will of God that is the Holy Ghost you love the Lord I'll finish this the next time I don't know I'm enjoying it but anyway Lester hand and we'll go right in the communion service glad to see I brother Troy back I apologize brother we we forgot to announce the communion service but the Lord placed on my heart that we would have it and so that's why I text you you look like you had a wonderful time down there so good good good good I'm glad to know that hallelujah you love the Lord what can I say I I marvel at the grace of God I marvel at him because I personally don't even know why he he he have so much mercy and grace on me but I'm glad about it just to see that God brought us it and he's kept me in I can tell you many times he he ran roblox for me he put things in my way he he just he's awesome and sometimes you'll see me cry because I can't help it because I realized that he chose me and I'm so happy about that we're going to be coming from the reading of first corinthians the 11th chapter you know what i'm preaching will nowise make you lazy hello and what I'm preaching in nowise will make you lazy if you're catching the revelation in the way is being preached you know to set your soul afire you're not gonna sit back on a bench and say well I'll wait till he come no you're going to be about your father's business right you think well Lord well Lord well you know but think about it every time I'd see Christians who think they ain't got nothing I think about that woman with the issue of blood who were basically crawling just to touch the hem of His garment through a mob through a crowd of people she could have been trampled but she had a vision and she knew that if I just touch the hem of His garment so pain and flick shion's and all of that stuff you and I must press through to meet Jesus coming from the 11th chapter of first Corinthians starting at the 23rd verse well I have received of the Lord that which also I've delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do any members of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the new test in my blood this Dewey as often as you drink in every members of be for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are George we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world well for my brother and when you come together to eat tarry one for another If any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together under condemnation and the rest I was said in order when I come we ask brother coming lead us in a song why I go and prepare for the toy to come in assist us in the name of the Lord [Music] getting close to thee oh let it be let it be [Laughter] Oh a closer walk with thee Oh granny Jesus is my [Music] [Laughter] walking close to thee [Applause] lady [Applause] [Music] let it be Oh [Music] is my Oh [Music] let us free fathers become before you as we break this bread we break Lord it touches my heart every time I read the scripture and you say do this in remembrance of me Lord we thank you for Calvary we thank you for the sacrifice that you made for us Lord and we pray Lord God that you have recourse here tonight if there be any sick and afflicted we pray Lord Jesus that you would heal them bless them strengthen them in your lovely name and we take this communion Lord in your honor thank you Father God for being all that you are to us [Music] Oh [Music] I love you and I live my vow to shampoo take [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you [Music] you [Music] half of the same man he also took

it's so amazing how when Jesus appeared to the eleven disciples in the upper room it transformed everybody it took away all doubts even doubting Thomas was no longer doubting Thomas because he came to a place where he believed and that's how it is when God moves and I know he will it's going to take every doubt every spirit of unbelief away from the bride of Jesus Christ he said brother books I don't believe that she has any problems well I remember the time brother Branham said the bride hasn't even had or revived me and I believe right now that God is going to do a great supernatural thing with us just prior to our transmission and I'm looking forward I'm watching and praying every day because we need more we need more we got the word we be more of the anointing we need more of him amen so I know he's going to give us what we all need he will return just like he's got us returning he's going to return and looking forward to seeing his return even [Music] open the floodgates even let me pray let it read well open the floodgates of Aramis yeah let it rain Oh [Music] anyway [Music] mmm lady Oh Lord open the floodgates [Music] let it breath I don't remember the rest of that song but I do like that part because we can always meet another shower right you love the Lord we appreciate everybody coming being with us tonight I don't know whether my brother has a song ever got dismissed by God's grace we just appreciate everything that God is doing I hope the message got over today I just you know our fumble sometimes when when I'm trying to get something I'm excited about it but I'm trying to stay in that tone where you can understand me so sometimes I and I don't know where this all come from I feel like I'm doing and orchestrating a song but that's something even new to me but by God's grace we know that God has already has a well planned out for one of these old days we got to find ourselves going up I believe that we are in the last phase in the last like they say three seconds I believe it was a five how many seconds it was two seconds away from the color alone in this time whatever that is that's how close we are they say it's no longer midnight we just close to that two seconds three minutes to midnight they say two seconds but all of the things that are happening we ought to look up and keep watchful most of all we want to see Christ in us every day that's about a word of Prayer father God we come before you once again we thank you for your goodness we thank you for being so good to us Lord you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves father I say that in my prayer because it's so true Lord every day as I look at myself and see how short I come within myself it give me the opportunity Lord to thank you for this grace this great grace that you have given it to us though there is no way that we can make it without your amazing grace we thank you for the blood of Jesus Christ that was shed for our remission of our sins we thank you for the life of the blood that you have placed within us that we will qualify for the gates to open for us when we come to the end of our journey knowing your God that most of us if not all of us will return to the dust from which we came but father there are some of us hallelujah that we'll never see that part of this cycle will be changed from glory will be changed from law total immortality in the moment in the twinkling of an eye and father we thank you right now for your precious love that you have shoulders will continue to keep us in your love in Jesus Christ's name we pray [Music] you [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
