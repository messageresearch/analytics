we thank you for answering or open the world speakers especially in Jesus Christ we pray amen amen I was in motion to get them to reapportion the Scriptures I would still not feed me the book of Matthew chapter 16 the early portion of the world Matthew chapter 16 amen Matthew chapter 16 verse 13 and every goes word amen when Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the Son of man came and he said some say that thou art John the Baptist and some eli's ordered Jeremiah or one of the prophet and Jesus Saturday for whom say ye that are and Simon Peter answered and said thou art a Christ the Son of the Living God and jesus answered and said unto Him blessed are thou Simon Simon bar Jonah for flesh and blood are not revered on the D but my father which is in heaven and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and a gate of Hell shall not prevail against it an hour gave on the deed a key of the kingdom of heaven and once they were - a burn on earth shall be bound in heaven and was what - and loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven in law a blessing to the reading of his word plea be seated amen now from this portion just word I just do encourage the sins on subject code inspiration and saying Jesus when he came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples say who do men say that I the Son of Man and the disciples are giving deaf opinions say some say what do you wear or a say who Jesus was say some say you are John the Baptist others say Elijah or Isaiah Jeremiah I want the Prophet that was the opinion of others what was saying about Jesus you know Jesus being the Word of God we've seen the opinions of others were speaking every word of God what was saying concerning the world but Jesus turned to them ask them because how do your personal revelation so he turned to them an example who do you see what what is your conviction what do you know about me what do you see a an ordinary was talk no could see anything no was speaking there was talk in the shell and know who come out but we see that in the scriptures we see that the Bible said but Simon Peter Anthony said thou are the Christ you add another one you had a son of the Living God you are God in flesh you are God manifested in this out but Jesus unless a blessing a doubt now why Jesus call Peter blessed because it is Peter cash in Revelation and the only way you can catch a revelation of God's Word you have to be blessed so you see that what Jesus say in the word a blessing a down some about journal for flesh and blood I'm not reveal it unto you I'm not an inspiration is a special influence of the vanity upon human flesh so you see as God Tommy done in a special way because Peter were blessed that is like who see oh go go open his eyes to catch the revelation and church the son that if you are not blessed to see it you will never see it so you see that is what Jesus was emphasizing the pita hey who do you say I am actually the question and broblem said in a message yeah you're him he made this statement either you see salvation is not passed upon what somebody else think it is what you think of him is it divine healing isn't based on what criticisms or what the judge says it based upon your best fit in the inspire world and how you inspire to believe that that bring the result it is her inspiration but the world now what does it hallelujah and take note the world is our inspired this word is inspired because according to the scriptures in a Bible of 2nd Timothy chapter 3 verse 16 the Bible said our scriptures hallelujah it's the soul it's the field but our scriptures is getting by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness so the Word of God before the foundation of the world is already being inspired hallelujah and take note and in this word is inspired they take you to be inspired to K the inspired Word so the one of them is complete but it's the human being that is what techno before Peter who gets the revelation of the word God how to inspire him some of our inspiration you can never get the inspire word so it that God will not give of your eyes before you can catch the revelation of this word and that is where Christ because Christ the world and they're bad with their hoarding we'll move on the inspiration on the power of the Holy Ghost and I write that one of the other inspiration and they see inspiration again from God they write the word the same inspiration have to come upon you before you can catch the revelation of this world or earth you will never see it hallelujah and so you see that is why Peter through the scriptures the producer we realize that we in the Bible you do not read it like who asked newspaper because it had been a wisdom of the Holy Ghost and hidden things from the wise and the prudent and result of its source that will a hallelujah so you see it thank God because you don't take no church it is God how to open your eyes the word do understand the scriptures they were cannot understand it hallelujah is it all structures as given by inspiration and n was reinterpreted by inspiration and then the skirt just be compared with scriptures hallelujah and that is what church if that inspiration hit your life then it will cause it will go and price and price gotta be pay and sometimes it causes separation in homes hallelujah because it take inspiration it will cause separation homes because many people will not honest in you so now in their homes their families their relations they don't understand what you are talking about its what if Gregor said sometimes this cost - lettuce it sometimes it causes separation hoops sometimes it causes separation in touches sometimes after separation enlarges in all walks of life sometimes between husband and wife hallelujah he said by a lack feet he has a lot of mistake like a half but this one time he was really inspired he stood up quickly said thou art the Christ what a statement thou are the Christ and Jesus said blessed are thou for flesh and blood have not revealed it unto you but the father which is in heaven not that no church has a son that you can never see the world that is well aunts many people the question what I couldn't bring you to this message because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and now in order in nineteen supply the full word came down and a Babel because a new book what in spiritual you have to see this message what I click draw you to this message because let me tell you is somebody taught you in to add somebody ask and talking out of it his summary is really people add Shambhala influencial of head and when somebody pair you into it some okay you out of it hallelujah so you see church that is what what actually draw you to this message it has to be an inspiration it have to be a regulation or as you are on a plane church and you'll be confuse because they were disorder inspire the word is inspired before the foundation of the world and Jesus press is the word and Christ is a message of this out so I take an inspiration of God to come upon you and church you hardly bless you have them in a program of God in our case the revelation of this message hallelujah so we see that where Jesus had blessed a does some but Journal because no man can teach you this nor me make sure to you that is what even when a preacher preaches he don't know how God convict hot he just preached and he goes come down take the world because Emma Tecna hula girls were inspired Word of God in your heart and I see has to be there and a power of God of Thunder everything I see before your eyes can be open for cash the word hallelujah and when you cash it then no one can take it from you hallelujah os you're going to be playing Church you'll be wondering and it is true and so how long you stay in the message here is I can be ball right in a message but take an inspiration they take a revelation and inspire revelation and now tech note is it an upon this rock I will build my church and a get of Hell cannot prevail there you are inspiration inspired revelation and how he was inspired standing there in front of the Messiah who was the world thou are the Christ they were flesh and blood and reveal unto you but upon this rock and not Church what is it upon inspiration problems that you see it upon inspiration of the Lord Jesus Christ through his word I will build my church and they get of Hell cannot prevail he said though it shows that gift of hell will be against and that is well they get of hell is always against the message they always against the world because a full truth Jesus Christ act of eNOS age and they get of hell and against the world the revelation of the world but then the church is celebrating the fight against it they're gonna go against that but techno judge is your inspire and you state the revelation he wouldn't fight but I can never they can never prevail hallelujah amen because the Bible said when I L met them in like a frog but a spirit of talk with the revelation of the world will rest a standard against hallelujah so church is sooo how to be inspired to cast a spy a word every night spire Church he will never see it and why Jesus said that gate of hell is against free time dealers pokers word is happening today that is where the good of her I give this message Friday anyway Tommy in churches can Amin brightest cestus men estas hallelujah because it had to be a revelation to you the other see for yourself do you if you don't see it yet your place is the author hallelujah your place is Auto areas their reasoning out and he still wondering what it is to or not if he not stable yet the other ask God hallelujah a man so you see a church if Ferguson is upon the inspiration of Jesus Christ which the world I will be my church and the get of Hell will not prevail against it it's a dirt it shows that all depths of hell will be against it but they can never prevail they cannot prevail said God said when I animate come in like Ephraim and say ah going just speaking because it's a revelation however is a standard so go and do it he said when all the gates of Thamud it's pressing against that little church and the church is individual it's a car I want is an owner get of hell is pressing against another church as I a big another Church hallelujah another church yet and will never prevail because she is going right on she'll keep pressing the back and change that is father act with a question what I couldn't bring you to this message what I didn't bring you well Arthur coalition to countless message and you say you believe it no tellin what you say untouched them on that you breed a message hallelujah so because you say you believe that gate of hell is against you he will flood all means to make you lose coffee in the world the mayor doubts to make you reason out but the Word of God has no reason it's not intellectuals hallelujah amen there is no reason that their intellectual not afraid or taught us the importance of revelation but that spirit where true believer can never be over emphasized if the revelation means more to you that the heart she realized is that I'm not talking about revelation to you I'm talking about our regulation and it's a tremendous in commanders are important to the church they said do you remember Marty succeed why you say to us that this body opposed to all day standing day when Jesus said who do you see what do you think ever the world what do you see the world is heaven stock no cou talk what do you say it means when I come to the one of the expression is there a good effect it's a personal individual offense that is how God to have grandchildren it's you Nebraska the treasure came a same way hallelujah he said dear member martin 16 refer your back to the scriptures the teller is an individual because were all stock the cooling talked bowing as an equation what people think of me they are all speaking they were all talking because what i'm a year and today italy simply in this message i will talk in every supernatural wherever god while my soul said well I better stop looking you I wish they're talking the same thing ever all the miracles but barometer or say left in out of history the other pressing things go today and you have to catch the revelation but what do you see hallelujah what do you think of this message they have been following all the years what do you say this message is to you hallelujah it's the work and she washed hallelujah amen hallelujah he said Ye ma ma t 16 where Jesus actually disciples are questioned whom do men say listen of me and he says some say da John the Baptist some say are you live some say you're the prophets and said but whom you see and not take much when jesus said blessed are Thou Sabbath by Jordan flesh and blood and I reveal it unto you but my father which is in heaven and are Peter and upon this rock I will be my church and I get of Hell cannot prevail hallelujah upon the revelation so the church is built upon Revelation and I take note he said when a man is inspired and he read the inspired Word and I do in spiritum together a gift result so you see church is you know inspired and you read the word you are never the result you have to be inspired to guess the regulation of this inspire world and what Jesus has fakin by hearing and hearing by the word the word is a revelation show you how to be inspired then if they inspire we'll get into you a hallelujah so every night inspired you will never see it that is what I mean tha said if you're inspired and you read a inspire work they every result then today there's no doubt hallelujah there's not that behavior even inspired then you catch this by a word then people think you are crazy then people with no wonder I told you what you believe and for all these years what changed your life they don't understand it because they forgot to us is the inspire world and you be described then you come together Church you can let a visceral life hallelujah then at the border your life nothing but on you if you're inspired nothing bored on you you don't want to what this what that it is happy you recommend is very purple see don't bother

complete control [Music] [Music] we see I [Music] as our brother continued we just want to say by God's grace I know the Lord spoke all of us I know I heard from God and I just think we were here earlier today pray [Music] and that brother was nowhere to be found God I believe in all my heart and I know not not just believe but I know that God and every hard I told you just last week to listen to enticing spirits cuz that's what's happening to the people anointed but with the wrong being taken as a week from the word instead of bringing us clothes anything that takes you away from the word is not of God especially nowadays I could care less about what it may be but God is not looking for excuses I was thinking how we really need and you know everybody knows that I've been really praying for revival in this church because we need a revival one thing I know that if we're going to find the right position in Christ it must come by if I love we must learn how to say the right thing if you're not going to speak positive about a brother or sister you shouldn't speak at all I've heard the Word of God I know it's true I was talking to her brother in South Carolina today and we were saying the same thing that this brother preached today about how in a lot of places a lot of right things are being said but there are no there's no inspiration there's no life and this is what I was trying to say on Sunday morning when I came in to this auditorium when I came in here tonight I felt what I felt I got very jealous for the Lord Jesus cause God is worthy of all praise and and I wasn't gonna freak and will never preach again if I come in a place and the power of God is not already in here we gonna sing and praise God until he comes because I'm not gonna try to preach ever again without the inspiration here already sometimes I come and it's already here I love it that way but without the anointing because it is the anointing that breaks and destroy the yokes all of us got yokes right now something let it be small but it be great we know that the little fox is all in the mind these things we ought to be praying and asking God to to deliver us from people God he's exactly what he says and he says what do you mean they're the only people that's gonna make a rapture are those without spot wrinkle or blemish those love overcome is that right blessed is the overcome it is a battle but you lost over God and the only way you're gonna overcome is by the inspiration and the revelation on the message for the hour we're gonna pray and I want everybody to pray your own prayer amen let your heart be the altar that's where it really is right now let us pray father God we come before you we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for this message this word that you've spoken god I was so less from A to Z from the beginning to the ending everything never said tonight was amen amen amen oh God even in my life Lord in their their their much space law for improvement and father you know my earnest desire and that is the beam in your perfect wheel at all time I want to be able to hear you and I want to be able to listen and I want to be able to be guided and directed by you and I want the mind of Jesus Christ to live in me destroying kill everything about me that's not what you would have it to be Lord I've lived I've seen all that I need to see in this life but father I'm trying I'm dying to live again that I might live in the world to come I believe that's all of us while we realize that there's only a few that's gonna make it cause so many people are being misled taken in different directions instead of drawing close to you Father we allowing Satan to take us farther away Lord you said to me today greater is He that is in us than he that is in the world but you also said Lord that there are many that this scripture is not working for because you're not in them and Lord you need to be in us we need to be in you an order form description to make itself many things help us now that will die and rot to ourselves may this night be a turning point for all of us Lord may we die to ourselves and focus our minds and thoughts on your ministry law work in this church this place where you have appointed us and planted us in Lord there are many who should have been here tonight but they're not because of spirits enticing spirits spirits that are making people feel like they have more time and then they really have lured like he said tonight you said we can't be a half-wit Christian we must be a hundred percent God you know my heart if no one else desire Lord I do I know there are others because we have come here tonight to hear you and Lord we have heard I pray my lord even as songs of Solomon beloved as mine and I am his I pray father God that you give us a hundred percent let the word that was planted the seeds that were sold tonight bring forth a hundred percent of you father we thank you right now we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy in Jesus Christ's name [Music] I Oh into the tail be free in spirit scream as I [Music] I know the word about a day that I'm led by the spirit they are the but wherever you need me our Father even something as I needed to say [Music] yes [Music] Hey ah do you running [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes Hey it's me beep me Oh ah dear [Music]
