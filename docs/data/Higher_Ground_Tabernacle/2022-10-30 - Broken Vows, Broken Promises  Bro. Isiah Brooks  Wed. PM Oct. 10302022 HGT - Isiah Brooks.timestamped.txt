[25:54] Remnant according to the election of
[25:57] Grace
[26:03] in this particular scripture
[26:06] particular Paul was concerned about the
[26:09] Jews
[26:12] and he was telling the Romans church
[26:18] that in spite of God shutting off the
[26:21] Jews
[26:25] that among them that God has a remnant
[26:31] all Israel is not Israel Israel but
[26:36] those who

[28:41] filled with all the fullness of God is
[28:53] I really want you to take note at this
[28:55] particular passage
[29:01] now unto him that is able to do
[29:05] seedingly exceeding abundantly above all
[29:09] that we ask or think according to the
[29:12] power that worketh in US
[29:20] [Music]
[29:26] amen remember he said according to the
[29:29] power that worketh in us
[29:34] not

[30:20] and as we journey
[30:24] toward that wonderful place called
[30:27] Heaven
[30:29] Lord we've come to trust you have to
[30:33] foreign
[31:05] we will
[31:08] happen
[31:19] special
[31:20] amen
[31:29] my service or sermon this morning
[31:36] is a very serious one
[31:39] which all of the word is
[31:42] seriously serious
[31:45] this has
[31:48] a burden on me
[31:49] [Music]
[31:51] um
[31:52] yesterday uh Fellowship helped me
[31:56] in a mighty way yeah
[32:00] but I'd like to entitle this message
[32:05] broken vowels
[32:12] no doubt each and every one of us
[32:16] have made a vow or a promise to the Lord
[32:22] and we failed to keep it
[32:27] but one thing about God
[32:31] he never makes
[32:41] and in the world there are two major
[32:44] Spirits
[32:46] one is
[32:52] conservative
[33:00] and to be honest with you they're both
[33:02] wrong
[33:06] God do does give us Liberty
[33:09] Liberty but our Liberty is found in the
[33:12] word of God
[33:17] on the side of the conservatives
[33:21] is all about law
[33:24] and we know that the law will kill you
[33:28] it's not given to us to free us
[33:34] the law always places Us in bondage
[33:40] that's what's happened to us here in the
[33:43] message
[33:45] we know that it's not law
[33:48] but we've done what the Liberals have
[33:51] done
[33:54] Grace a disgrace
[33:59] Hallelujah man don't be afraid
[34:02] it's real assistant why we understand by
[34:06] the grace of God
[34:09] that the grace of God is not to be used
[34:15] a cloak for sin
[34:20] Paul said
[34:22] shall we continue in sin
[34:27] that Grace May abound
[34:30] he said
[34:37] a vow is column Sodom to solemnly
[34:41] promise to do a specific thing specific
[34:52] when you make a vow
[34:54] you have made a promise
[34:58] and a promise you promise is something
[35:01] that you assure someone
[35:05] right
[35:07] whatever the promise is
[35:14] right you would do everything you would
[35:17] give everything that you have within you
[35:22] to make it happen please
[35:26] but being human it don't judge me man
[35:30] we break our promises
[35:34] sometimes deliberately
[35:38] and sometimes unattentionally
[35:41] but nevertheless
[35:44] because we are fairies to begin with
[35:47] songs
[35:53] we can't keep the promises
[35:57] that we make to others
[36:00] even to ourselves
[36:03] how many times we vowed foreign
[36:40] I believe that we
[36:44] waiting some prayers
[36:49] Hallelujah that we ought to be about our
[36:52] father's business
[36:55] this is why I'm preaching the message
[36:58] this morning
[37:00] because we need to be realigned
[37:05] Hallelujah yeah somehow we've allowed
[37:10] ourselves to get out of alignment um
[37:19] we must get back in alignment
[37:23] in order to keep the path straight
[37:38] it's a very
[37:40] part of the material see in particular
[37:43] material that God cut the pattern
[37:46] pattern out of out from do do our uh
[37:54] it is the same material
[37:58] but it's used for different
[38:01] works
[38:04] and I trust
[38:07] that if we are the remnant
[38:10] we are the brown
[38:17] chosen to you
[38:20] and you can flip that backwards
[38:25] there's a portion of the word
[38:29] and God has ordained for his brother
[38:31] cannot
[38:35] because
[38:38] hallelujah amen you see the message came
[38:41] to free us
[38:43] not to place Us in bondage
[38:47] Hallelujah
[38:50] the message came to free usage to place
[38:55] Us in boundaries
[39:02] by his promises
[39:06] amen maybe everything he's promised to
[39:09] me
[39:12] come into fruition
[39:15] but one thing for sure
[39:20] because I know his promises are yay
[39:25] all of his promises for the bride is
[39:34] that scripture
[39:36] now unto him that is able to do it
[39:40] exceedingly
[39:42] abundantly
[39:45] above all that we ask or think
[39:49] some power that worketh in US
[39:55] according to the power that worketh in
[39:58] US
[40:00] you don't have the power in you
[40:03] cannot work
[40:06] it will not work
[40:08] I was thinking on yesterday
[40:11] the beauty of pregnancy
[40:15] and God would take a journey
[40:19] and in that germ he can next with the
[40:22] egg of a woman
[40:26] needed for that being to grow
[40:32] your life
[40:36] the liver is there
[40:39] the liver is there the Heart Is Dead the
[40:43] arms are there the eyes
[40:56] everything
[40:59] everything the bride needs
[41:02] one is in the The Germ seed
[41:07] yeah
[41:10] on the inside
[41:12] the only thing that's necessary yeah
[41:20] it does that make sense
[41:23] but if there is no life
[41:26] if there is no seeds there really is no
[41:30] pregnancy
[41:32] you understand what I'm saying
[41:34] so you can't expect
[41:37] Christ manifested in you
[41:41] if he's not there
[41:48] I'm not speaking religion
[41:52] [Music]
[41:55] I'm speaking about a systems
[42:03] [Music]
[42:05] I'm talking about what Jesus said
[42:08] Nicodemus
[42:12] who have been employed
[42:17] who only knew his church

[56:20] when we got knowledge now
[56:24] then we had then
[56:27] and when the enemy comes in like a flag
[56:31] the spirit of God raises a standard
[56:33] against it
[56:35] a lot of time we don't understand what
[56:38] the standard is that means
[56:45] is that right and the Bible said if we

[59:40] a bomb that won't go off
[59:46] I don't believe God gave me drugs
[59:52] guts

[59:58] it's a bomb that won't go off it
[1:00:01] is

[1:00:13] okay amen
[1:00:17] an explosion it won't explode
[1:00:20] because really really it's good I think
[1:00:24] about what we've got in this church
[1:00:30] you hear what I'm saying
[1:00:32] we could do for for this Iowa's this Des
[1:00:36] Moines Iowa
[1:00:40] the only way this could
[1:00:43] happen
[1:00:44] families before the church Hallelujah
[1:00:57] you know I shouldn't have to tell y'all
[1:00:59] to teach your children
[1:01:02] because the Bible said April parallel
[1:01:13] that's the word
[1:01:17] you understand where I'm going company
[1:01:19] now we know by God's grace
[1:01:24] with all of the knowledge
[1:01:28] all of science
[1:01:30] there's one thing that holds us fast
[1:01:34] and that is because he predestined
[1:01:37] destiny
[1:01:40] Hallelujah
[1:01:42] things around us
[1:01:51] you got to prove
[1:01:53] that you didn't come from Satan's either
[1:02:01] you got to prove it
[1:02:03] is
[1:02:05] Malachi 4 prove it
[1:02:08] is
[1:02:13] that right making sure that the proof
[1:02:16] was there
[1:02:18] and the only way that God can prove
[1:02:21] himself
[1:02:33] I'm sorry
[1:02:35] I don't want to be just a church
[1:02:39] I have not been called to be a
[1:02:42] systematic way of religion
[1:02:44] systematically
[1:02:46] [Music]
[1:02:48] in my heart
[1:02:52] I literally
[1:02:58] because I know the potential of this
[1:03:00] church
[1:03:03] but one thing for sure I can't do
[1:03:07] and brother
[1:03:11] says
[1:03:18] that's something that you should already
[1:03:19] know Hallelujah
[1:03:24] you love the Lord
[1:03:31] and when we keep when we say our vowels
[1:03:36] unto the Lord
[1:03:38] we must keep them
[1:03:44] this message
[1:03:46] is not just science I say just science
[1:03:51] God has proved himself by science
[1:03:58] we know by God's grace
[1:04:08] Miracles have happened
[1:04:17] but that's not the ultimate the ultimate
[1:04:22] of what God is looking for
[1:04:27] who can keep
[1:04:37] one of the things that he did
[1:04:45] I don't know whether there was a
[1:04:46] ceremony
[1:04:48] but one thing for sure
[1:04:52] when Adam said you're bone in my bones
[1:04:59] ceremony
[1:05:10] we must believe the word every day
[1:05:13] we can't lay it down and said
[1:05:17] [Music]
[1:05:20] yeah
[1:05:22] what do you mean brother
[1:05:32] see I said believe it that's something
[1:05:35] you should know
[1:05:37] that God must be the
[1:05:41] leaders
[1:05:48] Hallelujah that God never breaks a
[1:05:51] promise
[1:05:54] can I get an amen
[1:05:56] God never breaks a promise
[1:06:00] if you truly believe
[1:06:03] never break a promise
[1:06:07] God cannot
[1:06:10] failures all the time but he cannot
[1:06:13] failure
[1:06:16] how many of you have heard the story of
[1:06:18] blind
[1:06:22] according to the prophet Brian Baltimore
[1:06:24] has had a little lamb like the
[1:06:27] professors
[1:06:36] why
[1:06:47] he promised God
[1:06:49] if you save my wife
[1:07:02] we take the treasures of our hearts
[1:07:09] what I will do in replay
[1:07:13] instead of Hallelujah
[1:07:18] But Here Come the enemy
[1:07:20] yeah when Blind by the Mayors went to
[1:07:23] sacrifice his Lambs
[1:07:26] the priest says
[1:07:30] you can't sacrifice
[1:07:33] Daniel
[1:07:36] I'll get you another one
[1:07:38] um
[1:07:43] [Music]
[1:07:50] can offer that to the Lord
[1:07:56] I didn't tell
[1:07:58] him
[1:08:00] I told God
[1:08:06] healed
[1:08:13] about it
[1:08:17] when God blesses us the things that you
[1:08:21] we we so desires promises to him
[1:08:26] I'd be faithful at church
[1:08:46] isn't that amazing
[1:08:49] and we fail to see that God brings the
[1:08:51] tests
[1:08:53] who comes first in your life
[1:09:05] Ecclesiastes five I'm not going to keep
[1:09:08] you alone
[1:09:12] no we started late
[1:09:14] enthusiastes five I didn't come to make
[1:09:18] a shout I came to make you think
[1:09:25] Ecclesiastes five it is
[1:09:37] for he has no pleasure in food
[1:09:43] paid that which thou has vowed I
[1:09:46] completely
[1:09:47] better is it the thou should not vowel
[1:09:53] and not and not pay because
[1:10:13] it's got to be love affair that we have
[1:10:17] people man
[1:10:19] the Lord
[1:10:21] you know what we'll do we'll raise our
[1:10:23] eyes why
[1:10:27] within your heart you know you don't
[1:10:30] love him like you should
[1:10:37] one thing about love you can't break it
[1:10:38] in peace
[1:10:43] love is
[1:10:45] the one it it stands the test of time
[1:10:57] I
[1:11:02] don't know
[1:11:07] I can go down a list
[1:11:09] all the good things he's done for me
[1:11:13] that's not the reason I love him
[1:11:16] I honestly love him because he put his
[1:11:19] love in me
[1:11:22] had he not put his love in me
[1:11:28] am I making sense
[1:11:32] Ephesians 5 23 everybody knows Ephesians
[1:11:37] for the husband is the head of the wife
[1:11:41] even as Christ is the head of the church
[1:11:45] he is the savior of the body
[1:11:47] [Music]
[1:11:50] therefore as the church is subject unto
[1:11:53] Christ alone
[1:11:56] let the wife be to their own husbands in
[1:12:00] everything
[1:12:04] now not everything is you know you gotta
[1:12:07] you have a balance to that because I
[1:12:09] didn't balance if your husband tell you
[1:12:12] to do something wrong
[1:12:17] and you do it you just see it
[1:12:31] when it comes to the word of God
[1:12:34] your husband tell you something wrong
[1:12:36] foreign
[1:12:41] absolutely absolutely more I'm sorry
[1:12:44] Brothers I just bust your system up
[1:12:47] there
[1:12:52] if he tells you to do something that's
[1:12:55] evil see if the
[1:12:58] you tell him to do it himself the family
[1:13:02] man
[1:13:04] and if you don't like it tell your
[1:13:06] pastor is
[1:13:13] hello
[1:13:16] he has no right
[1:13:20] husbands they Marie love your wives even
[1:13:25] as Christ also loved the church
[1:13:28] and gave himself for it
[1:13:32] Hallelujah Brothers
[1:13:37] you know that's a powerful scripture
[1:13:40] and husbands this is why you
[1:13:43] why are you praying
[1:13:45] yeah
[1:13:47] give me that love for my wife

[1:14:04] oh come on you get married
[1:14:08] for better for worse foreign
[1:14:25] you forgot your promises
[1:14:32] the devil that comes to break up the
[1:14:35] institution of marriage
[1:14:42] that's why he hate the church because he
[1:14:45] understands that the church is the Bride
[1:14:47] of Jesus Christ
[1:15:01] thank God Roger that's when Grace comes
[1:15:05] in
[1:15:09] oh
[1:15:11] Brothers
[1:15:13] ancestors hello do we give each other
[1:15:16] the kind of Grace we supposed to give
[1:15:18] each other

[1:15:33] also love the church himself

[1:26:09] the blood of Jesus Christ

[1:26:18] again when we fail to take heed
[1:26:23] upon the word of God

[1:26:47] you love the Lord
[1:26:49] I'm coming to some of y'all I'm coming
[1:26:51] right now just where I'm needing
[1:27:03] I read there in just a moment
[1:27:06] but it tells us
[1:27:08] ually
[1:27:11] Simon's house
[1:27:14] and she took
[1:27:16] all of her money
[1:27:25] now she
[1:27:27] is
[1:27:28] that she was
[1:27:30] gained by
[1:27:33] and she
[1:27:36] is
[1:27:38] see God saw her heart do you have views
[1:27:42] he saw her sacrifice do you have used on
[1:27:45] sacrifice he saw what was really only
[1:27:47] the inside of her life
[1:27:51] and when she
[1:27:54] uh
[1:27:55] the oil was
[1:27:57] taken to
[1:27:59] feet
[1:28:02] did you know that there was a
[1:28:04] woman
[1:28:08] let me say it like this this morning
[1:28:10] just to see the problem with us is that
[1:28:13] we allow the critics
[1:28:21] but Mary could care less
[1:28:24] [Music]
[1:28:25] critics Hallelujah
[1:28:32] in her worship
[1:28:38] and she knew that Jesus Christ was the
[1:28:41] only one that could give her that is
[1:28:46] here but then there was another critic
[1:28:49] yeah we are not critical and his name
[1:28:51] was Judas
[1:28:55] and you know what you've been studying I
[1:28:57] never saw it like this
[1:28:58] [Music]
[1:29:00] was a thief

[1:29:09] there was more than one thief on the
[1:29:11] cross yeah
[1:29:15] Hallelujah Jesus Judas was a thief
[1:29:20] and when he complained about using such
[1:29:23] a great oil
[1:29:25] the faith of Jesus
[1:29:31] he had his own interests
[1:29:35] he didn't care about uh uh uh he was
[1:29:38] looking at the money what kind of money
[1:29:41] would bring in Hallelujah
[1:29:44] you know even Jesus Is Awesome
[1:29:48] never did Jesus called Judas a thief
[1:29:55] y'all hear what I'm saying and see what
[1:29:59] we think sometimes is that when we steal
[1:30:01] from God
