Jesus Christ's name we pray my intent was to call you back God is good to us one thing I love about our you may be seated just for a moment I brother zekiel be ministering to us and when he told me he was coming down that's it just kept coming to my mind and you know I had some thoughts that I've wanted to administer tonight but look like so many things kept getting in the way you know and then I was sitting at my desk and the Lord said I'm sinning brother Ezekiel so I took the Lord's witness when he came in the door he came in like a preacher but we appreciate him and I say that he's one of the most harmless people I've ever met in my life he's got some powerful testimonies I don't know how God is gonna lead him but I know the last he was here we had a wonderful time with him sharing with us and he brought brought almost all of his family I know what it is to travel with a bunch we've had our days we've had fun though we had a lot of fun but I trust that God would bless them and bless their family for just being back up for daddy it means so much for daddy to know that his kids and families are behind him you know I know some of us are tired and sleepy I've had a rough day today and I was back there struggling with sleep and then I looked over there and somebody else was struggling with sleeping it's okay we're here and I started laughing almost uncontrollably but I know by God's grace it's just the Lord I know what it feels like but it's so good to be at the house alone I think that sometimes we do things and we don't realize amen the impact but you know I appreciate the Lord I think our brother if we're gonna ask him to come and we want him to just let go and let God have his way I trust all of us have listening ears and a receiving heart amen what a mighty God [Music] [Music] [Music] god bless you brothers there does my little nervous but always for the will of the Lord I come in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I invite you all to there's this boar hitch pray the Lord to help us Heavenly Father I give you the honor Lord you the grace Lord because you are Almighty Lord I give you thanks Jesus cousin it's for you Lord and we do all the things Jesus give you the things for each one of us that made a here Lord we could overcome all the arrows of Satan the Lord but it was for you because you please it was it was your pleasure Lord to have us here Lord in this evening Lord the brothers and sisters that couldn't make it today Lord I just ask you to be with them Lord protect them from all arrows Lord they're coming from Satan Lord tourist named Jesus and I ask you Lord to come Lord and visit us in this place Jesus coming this benches Lord this chairs are there not vacant that they're vacant Lord Saint angels Lord God I ask you Lord to take control of me Lord use my lips Lord use my eyes use my hand to use my ears Lord and everything that I say Lord it's just because we want to get closer to you Lord let us receive what we came for Lord and this evening Lord for your blood Lord we ask you in the name of Jesus Christ Lord to be with us I'm a little nervous we may come to help you so let me give you a couple of scriptures and we're gonna go through her Buse 1111 6 six uh first Corinthians 10:13 James one first John five six and revelations 22 7 we read her views then we might be City her abuse 6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that comes to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that deep digitally sick him might be seated brothers it's been in my heart for quite a bit of time I come in the name of Jesus Christ talk about faith in doubt see brothers uh I come to talk to you how God send the Prophet and not to look at the Prophet to look at that man that was talking through the Prophet our faith brothers we just think stop for a second and see where we get this close our eyes and for a second and see where is our faith that meditating God right now for one second close your eyes and meditate where is my faith am i that puppet of the Lord I'm out of that populace Satan see God God gave was the faith for one reason brothers we have to have love we believe in something that we can't see but we can fill him you know when the Prophet uh William I bring him came he came for one reason to get us out of the lines of Satan but he came for this reason to to show us how to escalate higher now he did not come to chose to play Church it's not time to play Church no more brother and sisters it's time to believe with our heart because this second that comes next it's not promised for us I don't know about y'all but I know something I want to see each one of y'all in that rapture when that magnet comes I want to see each one of y'all rejoicing themselves we made it I wanted I want to see Moses I want to see each one a nope Sadr I could name them all I want to see the Prophet my question right now are we playing church or do we come to church just to take and heat that seat because as we can see there's a lot of chairs empty but I see angels I see angels sitting down see brothers uh if we read Hebrews 11 or the chapter it talks about Moses Abram aram talks about Zara talks about Noah and it goes but now let's put ourselves in that versus by my faith I was able to overcome the drugs by my faith I was over to overcome and have that brother heal we have the sickness because we want to cuz Satan comes with that doubt and tells us you're not gonna get heal just because you think there's a god you're not gonna get healed that's the doubt that Satan's work see brothers what I want you to understand this evening I want you to understand that when God was crucified they got him off the cross he's a life but what the Satan has is doing in us he has us looking for them nails to go and nail him back in that cross no that's not what we're supposed to do we're supposed to love let's live the gospel of sight the gospel is from Satan brothers Oh cuz brother didn't come to church today cuz brothers he's not well dressed brother this sister this sister has a skirt this and sister has some this and this God does not want to hear that brothers God wants to hear this brother it's doing this wrong but I'm gonna get on my knees and pray for that brother I'm gonna get on my knees and ask God to help him overcome that by the faith brother by your faith by your faith by your faith by your faith we can move mountains how do you think that the prophet heals it was to God but his face had to come up and he had to love that person how can I pray for somebody that seal how can I pray for one of my brothers or sisters if I don't know my knees won't don't pray cuz that prayer he ain't gonna pass his roof see brothers I believe in a real god I didn't used to believe in a real god I used to hate God but I love him with all my heart now now I can't take all the pain that he took but I sure will die for him and it's easy to say this word I will die for him but when we're in that moment we will will you do it I'm a little nervous brother I'm still not I'm still not starting okay it's I'm burning warming up only lujah I don't know how much time I don't see your cloud so I don't have one so by the faith brother says but without faith it's impossible to please him it's impossible see brothers this bench is they're here for a reason we've got to come with this desire we've got to come with that desired and open our heart the ear of the heart not this year the ear of the heart and learn how to forgive and there's no sickness that could overcome us I lifted already brothers I had a stroke I had a stroke and God took that away from me God heal me what was it it was by the faith that I had in my lord that little boy right there Samuel he's 2 years old he was dead and the helicopter going to San Antonio takes us but I never complained see God made us not to complain but to glorify His name see we gotta find the trick the Satan guys all the time all the time when a bowling cane good and the bat in the in the cross of Quarry that good and the bat right now Satan comes is the good and the bad we've got to cut with the holy spirit they strengths brother I'm not a puppet of Satan no more it is written that's how we're gonna cut it that's how we're gonna cut it brother it is written Satan you don't have power upon me we cannot be a puppet of two gods we cannot be a puppet of two it has to be one because then strings so get all tango which one do we put Taurus which one do we belong it's very easy brothers to come and take a bench and sit down the team in that cross when Jesus died he died for one purpose died for you he died for each one of us I had stopped and think did Jesus rejoice himself when they were about to crucify him when he was carrying that cross was he happy he was brother because he knew before the foundation of this world that we belong to him so why not get ourselves if let's forget about the profit for a minute for one second because this is what the message has now message believers we are so tied to the Prophet let's not be tied to the Prophet let's be tied to Jesus Christ because he's the one that's going to save was the Prophet it's already done his job he already dong his job in this earth how annoyed each drop brother of blood in a sigh of fifty three four he said by His stripes I was healed by H drop of blood I was here let's not mixed it let's not mix that blood that powerful blood with the things of this world let's love each other you see the brother of the sister struggling you see that brother that sister they turn back don't judge them have faith and go and remind him go and remind him when he was glorifying God because what if it was us that fell you know what if you fall ninety nine times get up a hundred and one time in his name let's stop judging brothers and let's get them let's get this message get this message this word let's get them together because it's only one this let's not try to divide them like a lot of us do it by our faith brother by our faith we could go to hospitals we could go anywhere and by the faith that we have of God that took on took and paid for all the sickness just by our faith seeing the way that brother struggling seeing the way that person is struggling you know a lot of the times we go to the store and we see this man sort of sit or women they don't take a bath what do we do oh man it's a demon that there's possessing them by our faith let's slow them let's slow unlike Jesus loved us really brothers let's love them what do we do a lot of the times oh he just wants it for drugs okay let's take off our shoes for a second and let's go in their shoes remember God pray for you God pray for you God paid for each one of us by our faith brother is very powerful I'll keep on saying faith but it's for a reason before we receive the when God built this body it was two things it was first the eyes and we could see you could hear we could smell we could taste and then what came their faith and doubt how many have hurt hurt that and that message experienced team there's a heart I don't know if you could see it but I could see it do you half of that heart we give it to Satan and we put doubt in it and half of that half is hate and doubt what if the other half it's faith and love but what if we take a little bit from Satan's part and then when he ain't looking come and take a little bit more Bible says you should not steal but you know what I would steal from Satan because I don't want to go with him it's time to grab ourselves of that word it's time to stop looking who's some back of us God has some control everything brothers I might not make no sense but you know what God has something for you don't come and try to see where I'm at who I'm mad or whatever because by the time y'all finished trying to look I'm already done here look what God has to tell you because I came in one in one purpose in his name I stopped working today I told my boss I told him you know what I gotta go visit my brothers and they Moi's but what about your hours I don't care about this job I care about my brothers so I came over here see brothers when there's faith in us we could overcome a lot of stuff let's don't let's leave there's two kind of fates okay there's the kind of faith that you know if you go pay your light bill they're gonna cut your life that fate could stay I'll give that to Satan I won the faith that's something that I can't see but I'm gonna see him a reward of believing in him that's why I wanna see brothers we have cancer we have diabetes we have this and this and this and this and this because we want it let's hear it again because we want it because we let Satan come and put that in us I believe this word I believe with all my heart brothers in the name of Jesus Christ I believe it by His stripes I was healed now we got a gain or faith and give it back to Satan it is true brother I'll come and talked to y'all about this Bible about the word I don't come and put ideas to my mouth and and try to teach you all this no I come and say well the Bible tells me who wants who wants to be all the time see that stroke hit me I think it's already like six months ago I laugh cuz Satan Satan thought he had overcome but I gave sayed him back I got him and stopped on him every single day I get him and I this is what I do in the mornings I get up thank you Jesus I get up Satan you gonna stay right there in the name of Jesus it is written brothers see when God permits Satan to come and hit me with that stroke first thing I did I said Oh Lord yo or Lord that's the way I was talking thank you thank you Lord if you want to take me in this time I just want you to make sure I'm ready to go my son my 15 year old boy his pressure came up to 189 in 128 else you know for a stroke too but I never complained the next day my son my my two year old had rotavirus he was dying from the inside out but I never complained I glorify Him and I said God let's put a little bit more of my faith I believe in you I believe in you I believe in the real God see when I make that that impact with Jesus I don't live no more but you live in me you take control me I don't want to I don't want to take control myself on my life I want you to come and take control me so gain my faith he did by the glory of God we're all through here I don't have a cane what Satan wanted me to be walking like this you know what I give it back to saying I'm sorry that I walk over there and over here that's that's the way I do it brother I don't know why God calls me like that but that's the way he gets me you know here I'm already started sweating so that's a good signal got his good brother now I could preach in Spanish and they lujah let's go to first Corinthians 10:13 see a lot of the times we think that God puts things in our lives he never does god never accounts and put tests in our life that's what the Bible says right here I mean you want to read a brother you got a Bible you want to read first Corinthians 10:13 can you put it up here brother you want to read it somebody want to read it so god never puts a temptation towards brother he never does the temptations we put them ourselves when we have that doubt on God we always have about and I guarantee right now when we go ahead and get out of this building Satan is gonna come he always does that's his job that's his job right there brothers but what if we get them get them back let's get them back you ever plan to get Satan back let's give them no temptation - there's given that temptation to come to try try to test us it's hard right it's hard to tell Satan come and test me now because he comes and hits us right where it where it hurts us more but you know what let's get that that sort and let's poke him on the ribs to see if he gon run with a reading is see when God when Jesus came and fast for 40 days and 40 nights what did he get Satan with it is raining you should not tempt your God that's the key that we have let's stop calling all them demons we go in the shower what happens I've got to go to Walmart quick oh don't go out psychos you're gonna get sick you calling them spirits brothers give that back to Satan give it back to him he don't have power in it what the prophets orders I believe in the real prophet I used to hate William R Brown I used to hate my dad okay he preached and I try to kill my dad for that reason can he preach of their men or the prophet of the last age but now I believe with all my heart I believe with all my heart that he came to show us because we're so busy on this flesh so that's why God sent him to get us out let's not try to go back and nail Jesus back in that cross let's give their nails back to Satan give him back to him comes back with them nails here or you got you got the flu you got diabetes you got cancer you got so so so so no we don't have it we don't have it brother unless you want a demon in you I believe the word with all my heart bros I really do how many believe in the word when it comes to you give it back to Satan by His stripes we are healed there's no temptation there's no sickness that could drop us brothers we hear it that brother is over there this brother is over here this brother had this this brother this and this and this and that sister this and this don't get close to that sister because she has the flu don't get close to that brother because he had the flu what have you said down by that brother and pray for that brother and give him that love instead of being scared or that demon that is trying to possess that brother and it what the prophet see brothers the Prophet came and prayed but he had a love first he had to love them you don't matter what sickness it was that spirit had a leaf that body right there and then we still had that power brother just because the Prophet is slain right now don't mean that that power stopped no we still had that power because we're gods we're gods brothers hallelujah how many believed there were gods if you don't know how to fight Satan kick him kick him punch him do whatever you have to do poor get him away from you because he comes for one thing he wants to do destroy you he wants to take you to hell that's not where I belong that's not what y'all belong I'm for reals brother I want to see each one of you I want to see each one of your brothers when that magnet comes I want to see you up there with him so we have something against our brothers let me put it so simple there's some hate towards the brother sister that rapture of God calls us and we're going on that beautiful cloud are you gonna get off are you gonna get off because you hate that brother they love him right now we got the chance got his real brothers got his real he's here right now he's passing through our veins I was talking to the preacher I tell him you know the bride King have not even a little wrinkle in his and her vest let's make sure we don't have that wrinkle let's dink back how many times have we talked about brothers how many times have we said things about brothers and sisters now let's stop and think is that what God wants how many times have we prayed for a brother instead of talking about them Jesus didn't come for that the Prophet did in common and sat in in gospel about that brother God God don't like that brothers Jesus don't like that Jesus wants us to be clean not only from the inside but from the outside too if I pass a cup through mute excuse me for saying that word mute I pass it through in there and I put it right here and I put your favorite drink in there are y'all gonna drink it which I'll get that cup and drink out of it I guarantee no no none of us will do it it's the same we're cups Jesus wants to drink off of that Cup that's why we gotta clean ourselves how how are we cleaning ourselves right here this is the answer but not only of this but we got to read this and let that faith because we're we're not seeing we're not seeing him we're not seeing Jesus so how can we have that faith we can't see him or you could just feel that asmath fear of God you know how many times have y'all sit down by the your bed and pray and you feel him come and talk to you he's a life he's not dead like a lot of people try to put them dead on that cross the temptations brothers the temptations are from Satan times we get tented and whittle cone Church I got a car my car is breaking and I passed through the Chevrolet to the fort that's a good temptation right there but I'm I'm on my way to church that's the traps of Satan he puts things like that not only that with our own families oh I can go to church because my son is sick I can't go to church because my pants are wrinkled you know there's a brother he went and minister somewhere and he said lord I want to make it with my family to go to church too there are hours for me and when he got there he had about 15-20 minutes still he made her to church see I come back and tell y'all we are God's anything that we asking his name it should be given to us but for that we have to have that faith and not only ask it from right here because this is the domination this is the Catholic from right here out ask it from your heart anything that you ask you should have it if you want to tell you like you you ought to get a Cadillac too but why ask for a Cadillac when you could ask for more understanding you know that this thinks of the world let it be let's ask for more understanding more to feel ourselves for we could take another step and get closer and a little closer I want to go see the brothers that they're fought for we could be here I know I know I know some of y'all has stopped and thought eh what is moses' like I want to go see Moses I want to go see my brand I want to go see how Abel is none of y'all had thought about it what they suffer what they suffer for we could be here not only that brother by their faith you think when Moses left he hurt that voice goes by your faith and when he had to go back when he had to go back knowing that he was going to be killed by his faith he went but yet we want to be followers of Moses and then look back to fight our own does not be that lets not be that brothers see Moses had a good faith brother the Prophet had a good faith and so-and-so had a good faith what about our faith where are we at where are we sitting it no fantasy let's leave that fantasy of sight it's not a fantasy time no more you see how thick this paper is hardly any thickness in it that's how far we are from the rapture it's a prophet preach that the rapture was around the corner now imagine how close it is it's over fifty years when he died I don't watch TV but I hear all these things that are happening around the world and a lot of the things earthquakes that's one of the things that the Bible said it already occurred now the prophets face why is it sitting in Montana how many have seen the prophets face in Montana brother can you pop out of a take a United States map there it's not a coincidence it's not a coincidence the Prophet preached upon California that was going to sink and he has to happen now right now one brother puts it why did Jesus put their face in Montana facing toward California now this was formed before in the foundation of the world I'm telling you I believe in the real God brothers I don't come here to to have fantasy my fantasy times are over or already the Prophet brother sisters it's really finished he already finished see as you can see right here that's the prophet's face right there looking towards California how many knew about this just one brother here see this little bitty things what does that has to do with this it has to do a lot because that's truly me that God send the right man to this earth to awake us from the death just look at that face up your honor and look at this face the same faith brother now why is it looking towards California why did the Prophet had to come and prophesied that California was going to sink I have that faith that it is going to sink I know it's going to sink it has to now Billy Paul Billy Paul is to see this Billy Paul is 98 92 years old I believe how many years more does he have now this is off the message this is something that the Prophet prophesied he spoke to to Billy Paul and told him that his side should see this occurred but now Billy Paul is 90 something years old that's why I ask you brothers where are we sitting at and we playing Church are we focusing in that cross every time we tell Satan - apart from us get closer to that cross every time we believe this powerful message we're getting closer now don't try to come and eat all the message to get closer over there because you are parting yourself from it you have to let it come as God gives it to you because there will become religious y'all ready tired if y'all want me to stop just put them scissors on in James let's go to James 1 and as verse fine 6 she uh about seven eight years ago my hand was broken an ancient came and fell on my hand I don't have no surgery how many no mechanic here what to take a engine out with the whole transmission and the chassis and the tires and everything there's four bolts on the bottom you take them boats and the struts and all that and the whole thing comes off I was doing that in the jack stand it was raining at the moment you have been raining Jack Stan moved that engine came and smashed my hand my dad being a preacher saw what occurred as I could my son was there he helped me get the hand out I got on my knees but that's it son let's go to the hospital I said you being a preacher asking me to go to a hospital I believe in a real God so I got on my knees and I didn't talk to Jesus I glorify his name as I could I roast my hand thank you lord thank you lord if it pleases you for me to have this broken hand glorified be your name I'm still gonna I'm still gonna worship you got oh and Satan had it too I turn around and I said Oh Satan in you liars of all lies thinking that you were gonna have the victory I give you all the best stuff back and tie you and send you back to the gates of hell and I was screaming outside but not only thank you god no I was screaming then I feel that breeze I feel that breeze brother come did he told me move your hand and I moved it by the glory of the Lord I don't have no operation my hand none of my hand nothing is broken in there see brothers by our faith we could do a lot of stuff and I know story sometimes testimonies think seems like there that brother just invented no brothers real things we're followers of God we have to get to that point where we're like God not only have that fantasy that I'm gonna be like God and they lujah okay and James 1:5 and six I'm not too good of a Raider so I'll let somebody else really you want to read you want to read somebody want to read it that's the secret that's the secret right there well that's what that doubt remember the doubt is from Satan it's a sit right there brother I'm telling you I'm gonna read from the scripture and I'm gonna tell you what the scripture says I'm just trying to break it down anything that you ask you know I have seen this brother I got seen brothers in wheelchairs and they come to a church and they preach about faith and doubt and I have seen them get up from their wheelchair and walk and jump in front of the out art but then Satan comes and they listen and boom there they go I have seen people raised from their by whose faith by whose faith they all face brother by your faith yes I say by your faith we could do anything that's the sacred day the Prophet Hat brother faith and love these two things that's what the Prophet said the doubt is very dangerous to Russell how many times have we went through a message and we're reading it and then that doubt starts coming how many times a lot of the times it comes she's saying it has a lot of time and he'll get out of his way to come him inject there is not a small hint her range it's a big one no doubt the problem is do we want to accept that let's cut them strengths brothers and he don't want you to he don't want you to leave this place with them strengths of Satan he wants you tonight it'll be the night that you let God and cut them strength and let's escalate more for we could get to his presence let's stop they let us go and stop trying to stop the bride from walking toward that cross already because we're holding the bride to walk forward the Prophet the Prophet prophesied is that the bride is so busy looking back is mama coming is jr. coming let's leave that alone let's leave it alone for a minute and let's see what what happens when we get there let's see what happens when we get there we put everything towards that cross let's pick up that cross tonight let's pick up that and follow Jesus let's pick it up and follow tonight is the night brother tonight is the night cuz the next second in your life is not promised thank you lord let's leave all the troubles behind God is cleaning us right now brother but only if we pick up that cross and go let's give everything back to see I don't know what it is I don't care with a name that it is or whatever it is that belongs to Satan let's give it back to him tonight tonight is the night let's let God come and overcome in our heart let's let's let him come and go in the deepest in our heart and work from there out let's give that key if we gave him that part of a heart of 99% let's give him a hundred percent tonight for he could go in there and take everything out he wants to do it he wants to do it with each one of us each one of us and I don't like pointing fingers but he wants to do it with me cuz I'm pointing it back to this house God for a fresh start let's that's come to that we want to leave everything behind even what we had learned or the message of the word let's ask him tonight that we want to give it back to him and start over and fix what we have left
