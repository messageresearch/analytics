TRANSCRIPT
========================================
through 15. keep therefore the words of this covenant and do them that ye may prosper in all that you do yay stan this day all of you before the lord your god captains of tribes you elders and your officers with all the men of israel your little ones your wives your strangers that is in thy camp from the heavens excuse me from the viewers of woods unto the drawers of thy water that thou shalt should it uh that thou should um utter unto enter into covenant with the lord thy god and into his oath which the lord thy god maketh with thee this day that he may establish thee today for people unto himself and that he may be unto thee a god as he hath said unto thee and as he has shown sworn unto the father to abraham and to isaac and to jacob neither will you you only do i make this covenant and this oath but with him that standing here with us this day before the lord our god and also with him that is not here with us this day it kind of like sounds like what jesus the word of god says this promise is unto you and to your children and even to them that are far off the same kind of covenant just shorter words because jesus is saying to israel i'm giving you a covenant and i'm giving you a word and and this word is cons concerning you and me i'm going to make a covenant with you i'm going to let's put it this way i want to make you my bride because remember jehovah had a bride too and of course she failed him because she chose to walk in the ungodly way and she was so influenced at one point in time by a woman called jezebel and jezebel was what we call a prostitute or and she married into uh the the israel camp let's put it this way because ahab was the king and ahab was a uh uh israel a light and and he married a worldly woman and this woman changed israel so much to she killed every prophet of jehovah everyone that she could get a hand on to she killed him hallelujah and that same spirit is working today and and you know she had a a a a daughter called athalila i hope i'm pronouncing that correctly but she was just as wicked as her her mom but the word of god to elijah said that you're going to die jezebel because of all the wickedness you've done and guess what the dogs are going to eat your flesh now we know that aunt delilah had a she was rejected of israel and and and you know during the time when they had to hide the royal seed from her because she wanted she thought she was to reign and you must understand that at the lila amen is a type of the denomination because you understand rome or the catholic church or and i'm not here to preach on the catholic church i'm just saying there is a system of protestants and catholics that are working together and this system has come together to destroy the royal seed but in all of this you must understand what's moving the system of the world today something you think you can't you cannot see but because of the message of this hour we can see the spirit that's moving yes it's going to turn everything that you see now that seem to be far away from christianity is going to turn and when it turns christianity will be the target and every christian that's conservative or those of you who believe in morals and morality who understand that the system that is moving in now is not of god hallelujah it's the same thing amen that they did in the anteluvian day they forgot about god and they chose science and science brought them their destruction and the same thing has happened to america we kick god out of school we kick god out of out of church basically we he's he's out of the church he's no longer there we kick god out of politics we kick god out of everything amen is that right rome uh revelations the third chapter he stands at the door knocked and i know and wanted to come in and many people think that's an individual no no no he's trying to come into the age of laodicea and they wouldn't have him see when they rejected malachi 4 they did not understand they were actually fulfilling that scripture because christ was here in that prophet and when they rejected him like israel rejected samuel is that right they did the same and all day they wanted somebody educated they wanted somebody to be a king and they are going to get their king but i said all of this because here god is making a covenant he says i'm not only just giving this covenant to your immediate family but i'm giving you this covenant all i want the ones who are with you the strangers the visitors you know who's ever with you i'm offering this to them as well in 29th verse of the 29th chapter of deuteronomy this is one of the key scriptures it says the secret things belongs unto the lord our god but those things we reveal belongs unto us and to our children forever that we may do all the words of this law and that's exactly what god has done in this last day he is he god himself amen is the is the mastermind and there is no way you can figure him out but once we come to see what god has done for us in this last day it'll make it all to make you love him in a way that you'll do right because the bible says that the the the love of god the goodness of god draws should draw men to repentance hallelujah deuteronomy 30 amen 11-15 says for this commandment which i command this day it is not hidden from thee neither is it far off see what it is we we don't understand what god is doing because we we we we think that we got to work it when we was in denomination when we was in say you know what denominationalism organizationalism is a type of egypt because you are bond you're in bondage and you always have that task master that drives you that enslaves you he becomes your master and it takes the message to literally free you from that and while you're there the dev while you're in egypt he always give you laws law law you can't do this you can't do that don't touch this don't taste that see we're beyond that you say well how can you say we're beyond that because really when you come to understand that you have been predestinated that you were in the mind of god before the foundation of the world if your bride i was telling the devil you are a loser nothing you can do can stop me yeah you fail you fall you fail you fall and the thing is the just man falls seven times in a day he gets up there's a power in him that makes him get up he's not a quitter he can't quit he might fall but he gets up hallelujah why is something in him that's a driving force that makes him get up what is that force god amen it ain't you it's not you it never happened you you didn't make your mind up to serve god god chose you it was god who drew you it god it's god who continually draws you but a lot of time we think god is in heaven he is yet and still he is not in heaven only hallelujah hello deuteronomy says for this commandment which i command thee this day it is not hidden from thee neither is it far off right we had a prophet come speak a message the spoken word is the original seed god came through that mouth and told us that we're little creators we're messiahs connected with god born of god and when you're born of god you'll chip off the rock you're part of it his abilities become your abilities hello this is what we must come to recognize that when the message was open when the seventh seal was open amen you must understand that that what it was was done in a way that nobody knew when it happened but we find out that that seventh seal was open underneath the sixth seal so when the seventh seal opened there was silence well i was a silence because god had already done this thing i got a quote i got a quote to make you see what i'm talking about see i want you to understand that's why everybody's looking they're looking they're looking and the answers are already there it's in the book that's why brother brown said it could nothing could be added to it so whatever the silence was it has to be in shadow and type somewhere it has to be in the book but it's up to us to find out where it's at it's been in your face all along but look what it goes on to say it is not in heaven that thou shalt say who shall go up for us to heaven and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it neither is it beyond the sea that thou should say who shall go over to see for us and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it but the word is very nigh thee right in thy mouth and in thy heart thou thou mayeth do it what what are you saying see we didn't understand it we did not see what the real baptism of the holy ghost was we didn't understand that there was a seed already in you you you could not hear the message unless there was a dev a predestinated seed already in you and when that light shine on that seed hallelujah what was the seed to grow up into christ god it was god's seed that he sold in us before the foundation of the world it did listen nothing once the light strikes the seed nothing can stop it from growing and producing nothing oh i loved it the the way the we were trapped i like that i i think brother for the uh lamb brought that word out trapped we were trapped in darkness trapped under circumstances hallelujah but when the light struck us what are you talking about that woman at the well was trapped there's no way she didn't see her way out how could she the world hated her her own people despised her she had to literally go to the well at a time when nobody else would show up hallelujah but then came jesus what was it it was that seal it was that seventh seal it was christ it was god and all of the jews didn't even know he was there his coming even then was a secret amen hallelujah and when he did things supernatural he told them go don't tell nobody amen hallelujah but look who he reveals himself to woman at the well discerns in her life and go tell her go get your husband right now she says i don't have any now that's proper he says yes you do and the one that you have is not your own y'all understand what i'm saying she was trapped by circumstances but her true husband who was the word the quickening power of the word quicken the seed in her now she has a new husband amen and this new husband is the seventh who is jesus christ himself and if he was the seventh then he's the seventh now hallelujah see that's why there cannot be another organization or denomination after this seven is completion hallelujah so who are we married to we're not married to denominations we've been called out of it is that right so if we've been called out of it then where are you in the message recognizing your day in this message brother branham says that the seventh age is finished it's ceased it's dead you say well what do you mean time shall be no more you got to understand where you are people say it ain't over yes it is whether you believe it or not it's over for me uh i got a quote if that's what you need to see but my point is how can you be married to christ and you're in the seventh church age you can't be see you gotta come out of her you gotta die without the camp you got to be crucified with christ outside of the system you can't be in the system the system can never give you a word of resurrection all they can ever give you is the do's and don'ts and we're beyond that you say what do you mean the bible says even paul says who shall lay any charge to god's elect who's going to condemn you who's going to judge you nobody can judge you not the true bride of christ because the bible i mean we know by god's grace when god justifies you is as though you never sin in the first place now we make mistakes people but we make it right hallelujah and god got us covered hallelujah and i still believe that we need to scrub every day wash in the word every day that's what makes you bride because you want to make sure your garment is pure you want to make sure your garment is clean at least on your side on god's side is already done amen neither is beyond the sea but he says but the word is very nighty in thy mouth and we have been taught we have been taught that whatever we confess will come to pass if you confess negative stuff that atmosphere is going to consume you if you connect confess positive stuff why because your words are creative that's why the bible says bless and curse not because you have the ability to do them both amen hallelujah oh is that right oh come on when the sons of thunder says lord let it rain down fire jesus said you don't even know what spirit you are of hallelujah because when elijah did that in the old testament he was an angry prophet it was not the holy spirit that caused him to do that but because he was a prophet god had to honor it and because you're a son and daughter of god god will honor it be careful how you say things now you say what brother looks where are you going with this because you must understand that the whole bible has one purpose and that's revealed christ that's why brother branham talks about moses elijah and john and moses and elijah and joshua and all the old testament he said that was christ amen hidden behind human flesh but it was christ and he says every after he said every every type every christian type every type in this bible is a revelation of the mystery of god we read about esther we see esther we can identify with esther but don't you understand that the coming of esther was the coming of the bride of christ it was god in christ a female in form and you and i must understand it was ruth and all of them the same thing what was it god hiding himself behind the scripture those people didn't know what they were doing but god laid it out in there so that you and i could one day look back and say lord that's me genesis 2 17 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shall not eat of it for in the day that thou eateth thereof thou shall surely die now you understand in that day there were two trees there was a tree of life and the tree of of the knowledge of good and evil let's see what brother brethren says amen he said he said christ that tree that was in the garden of eden there were two trees in the garden of eden these two trees were set there for birth purpose you understand me so what happened with eve was not a mistake they were there for the purpose of birth god amen being a god of contrast he needed the negative so that he can produce the positive there had to be a serpent they had to have that relationship there had to be a cane and there had to be an able because that's what those trees were set there for and he said when eve she was touched and christ was the tree of life now by the woman comes death by the man comes life and everybody know that's that's real it's true whether you like it or not every man born of a woman is going to die that's what i try to tell people i said you know what we spent so many times looking in the real view mirror what you used to be will never be again until you get over there right no matter what kind of pills and what kind of stuff they tried to produce you are who you are oh but i got something good tonight i trust i can say it and i will see we must understand what god is doing with us and and like i said it it puts you in a different frame of mind when when this thing don't is no longer this process creating your mind but it's a life in your heart because a lot of people got every quote down in the message you you quoted they're quoting for but that means nothing paul said you can understand all mysteries and have not that charity in your heart what good is going to do you now i want to say something oh i can't jump right now but my point is this is later than we think we're right on the we're on the end of this thing on the edge of this thing the lord is getting ready to make a transformation we're getting ready to change dimension we're going to catch him up soon soon much sooner than we think that's the vision of the seventh seal we didn't understand it i don't i can remember in my little span of the message we've always we've been trying to figure out what that half hour of silence was and and it's done come and gone we didn't even know it but i got a quote just hold on it's coming because i want you to understand that's the way it always is and the devil can't catch it because he still don't know what it is hallelujah but the bride of jesus christ has been hand-picked and selected to take a rapture and guess what is given to her to know the mysteries you don't have to worry about it coming it's coming remember even when peter had denied jesus christ and when jesus christ was getting ready to to to to unveiled himself to his 12 11 disciples he said wherever peter is y'all make sure he's among this group right i mean that was peter was elected he was chosen and jesus christ had appeared to different ones appeared to them on the on the road to emmaus and the bible said he began with the prophets and began to teach uh uh uh the disciples of christ and and what was he talking about he said all you fools and slowing heart don't you believe everything the scriptures have said now how are you going to know everything the scriptures have said if you're not studying if you don't read it you don't know but he started with moses and he brought him all the way up to the death of christ showing them that this thing was supposed to happen and all they could say oh but didn't our heart burn their eyes still wasn't open you know when they opened he opened his eyes when they got alone in that little old hut whatever it was that little old end and he began to have communion with him and then all of a sudden he broke the bridge you see what i'm saying because the word of god when you hear it preach make you feel good or fuzzy in your heart that don't mean you see it means that you've been in the presence of the lord hallelujah but when the word is broken to you it brings about a stimulation you say it didn't yes it did when those when they began when they saw that that was jesus christ they left and went all the way back to jerusalem listen didn't matter how tired they was they were they were stimulated yes sir in the midst message christ is the mystery of god revealed he says see god has this all to himself it's a secret and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for a space of a half hour and seven thunders uttered their voices and john was forbidden to write it see the coming of the lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he would come and when he would come it's a good thing that he doesn't no now it sounds like it wasn't revealed but you got to understand how brother adam talks it's a mystery it's a parable he said it didn't come and then he said the coming of the lord see now i'm going to take you to somewhere else see he was showed or revealed it in every type now brother says now he's showing it in every type he has showed and revealed it in every type that's in the bible therefore the entire bible is the revelation of god mystery in christ the entire bible is an expression of one goal and that goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible and all the acts of the of the believer in the bible has been in type and expression what god's great goal is and now in the last days he has revealed it and showed it now if eve had not done what she did and adam followed with her that goal would have been met because you remember amen there was something that god wanted to get out of him and the only way he can get it out was to show in type what he was trying to do now he told adam and eve to do what multiply replenish the earth with what sons and daughters of god of course her name was not eve then it was adam and her fallen name was eve right see you listen let me tell y'all something we can sympathize with all of the dominations all you want to let me tell you like this it's not your plan and who did god have to cancel with there was no counseling who going to tell god what to do oh i think they're good people who can judge the heart but god we don't know but one thing you ought to be glad about is that god has chosen you no there's no one person ever nobody i know not in my enemy if there be one that i would love to see unsaved but can i save them no that's just like brother brandon wanted to heal everybody couldn't do it because he wasn't the healer and the truth of the matter is you and me sound crazy talking like this but it is what it is see therefore the entire bible is the revelation of god mystery in christ the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible and that was he wanted to achieve the very thing that he's doing at the end of the day and that is producing a bride how can you have a family without a wife that's why you see the new jerusalem coming down and and the bible calls her what the mother of us all and every stone represents a trial or victory every stone that's why god says when you cross the jordan you pick up 12 stones and put them on that side for a memorial even when it came to the breath breastplate of aaron he had 12 stones and those 12 stones represented the 12 tribes of israel but mine knew every one of those tribes were tested by the word they didn't choose themselves god chose them especially one goal that's why i try to tell people i say we gotta stop this murmuring and complaining and god have you know we do too much that's what israel did that's what we do sometimes god what what what's wrong with that scripture the footsteps of the righteous man are ordered by the lord what's wrong with this scripture in all things give thanks amen hallelujah glory to god and we must understand that every trial every test we go through is not for god it's for us there is a reason there is something god is trying to get listen if it's just trying to make us desperate more desperate for him it's there how many of you god has never paid bills for it may have taken time but it came through how many times you make you you ashamed of yourself because you fought with the fact that he's gonna will he do it or will he not do it and it comes through every time we forget he owns everything god can do it what do you think it's the truth i'm learning myself he is still jehovah jireh amen when the devil wants to take your joy because he knows the joy of the lord is your strength but none of us have suffered like job and none of us had suffered like jesus i'm preaching to myself and all the acts of the believer in the bible has been in type an expression that god's great goal what god great goal is and now in the last days he has revealed it and showed it and god help will see it right here this morning what the lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it what was he what is it he couldn't find a faithful wife until he came to this day y'all better hear what i'm saying and the only way she's faithful because he ordained us too it's not by might not by power but by his spirit said the law hallelujah somebody help me here tonight it's the truth we're talking about the seventh seal you are it amen you're the mystery like odessa amen what's the mystery to that kingdom you're the mystery god had ruth in another country she was a mystery hallelujah and think about those two book esther and ruth the whole bible or the whole redemption plan is is is encompassed by those two or the the encompassed by those two books the mystery they didn't even know who they were is that right but god called circumstances amen political circumstances to take place to bring them to the place they want to be don't look at the squeeze like it's going to destroy you god is going to allow that to happen to bring you to the place where you need to be look at israel how did she get back in the homeland hallelujah god put the screens on them god let political circumstances take place to motivate them and to that power drove them back to their homeland don't you worry god is faithful it's in there it's in there that's why brother ram said that the that the move is on for the bride so is that in prison look what he says the lamb took his book when the seventh seal just ready for it to be open the sixth see the six remember he had the seventh seal he hid the seven seal from us you heard what he said see the seven seal was here here from us because it sounded under the six he wouldn't do it on that one in other words he didn't he didn't do it when they thought see it was hidden he said there is silence in heaven no one knew it was the coming of the lord that's what he said no one knew it it was the coming of the lord not even the prophet he didn't understand it you know why because we had our own understanding on how it was going to happen we did exactly what israel did when jesus came the first time and he had come and gone before they realized it was him you understand me now you say well oh no yes sir because remember it had been prophesied that israel would be have eyes to see and would not see is to hear and not perceive and that's a saint when jesus came and that's the same thing that has happened in this day and laodicea is blind naked and don't even know it she can't see she came here hallelujah and people don't even know that god is not in their churches revelation said he wasn't so who's in there who is that impostor hallelujah can't be the holy ghost it's an impostor somewhere because the holy ghost says amen to every word and when you get a people don't care where they are and they can't say amen to the word and they say oh i got the holy ghost no no no the holy ghost must say amen to his own word that's what brought us out we were able to see the word and we was able to say amen even though we couldn't perform it even though we didn't know how to do it even though we didn't know how it was going to end there was something on the inside that made us believe it and all we could say is hey man what was that that was that predestinated seed on the inside of you the devil hates it you know he hates it you know why he hates it because once the seed is quickened you might as well say it's over that's why he don't want you to really get the holy ghost you know he don't want you to get the holy ghost because he knows once the holy ghost gets in you you see what i'm saying we judge ourselves by our outer court and that's not where god is judging you the flesh has already been judged it is dead amen in the eyes of god hallelujah but it's the inside of the inside that god is judging you by what you allow your soul or your soul allow your spirit uh to do with this flesh but the flesh is judged that's why we're gonna get a new body your body has not been redeemed yet is that right remember in the preview of the bride the bride came by first she would step into the word of god that's that early church you know paul had a good church that early church had the revelation of this message y'all didn't know that because it was the seed and the book was opened hallelujah it was when this antichrist spirit came in is when the book was sealed amen hallelujah seal up the book daniel it was sealed but then when the prophet came something took place the book was open why because the word was restored hallelujah but this time the antichrist will not be able to be a dwarf com to the bride of jesus christ why because we understand his workings we know what he does and we know that if we if he can we allow him to take us off of the word he's got us so we stay behind the word we work with the word we walk with the word we talk with the word we live with the word the word is us and we're the word amen see we know what he is he comes and you know how he did it he in the early age he took the nicolae in the spirit he separated the people making one man greater than the other nobody's greater we all been washed by the blood of the lamb y'all understand me hallelujah there's no great one among us other than the holy spirit so what happened miss america came and oh my brother them said she was the lootest of them all that he was the beginning of the creation of god hallelujah not that god created himself in other words he was the author of it he was the author of the creation he started it off hallelujah glory to god and what is it now god recreating himself again don't you understand you this is blasphemy to the denominational ears but it's truth anyhow they say oh jesus you blaspheme you must have a devil you make yourself equal being that with god being a man you make yourself equal with god oh come on somebody when he said i and my father are one they took up stones to stone him hallelujah what you want to stone me for he said if you don't believe me believe the very works that i do hallelujah because you make your being a man make yourself god but what they didn't understand if they only turned it around you being a man make yourself god no it was god making himself a man see that's what the whole purpose was of it about god condescending into his own creation and making himself a part of his own creation why are you talking about character that's why we need character we can't go to heaven amen with leia to see a character hallelujah we gotta come out of her hallelujah and be cleansed by the blood of the lamb hallelujah is that right you say oh brother books ah yes the bible said this wicked and adulterous generation they always seek it out the signs that's not the bride she don't seek out the signs she don't seek out the miracles because she is the miracle and she is the sign amen i'm gonna tell you something we better let the blood cleanse us hello i i i i you know i see things about myself i don't like every day anybody in here like that i see things i'm like lord cleanse me oh lord because you know what when that thing come let him that be filled to be filthy still do y'all know what that means you caught in the trap there's no way to get out once that time come it's finished only those who are under the blood will escape look what he says and i i'm going to cut it short because i i've got a lot of other notes but still listen he says let l in recognizing your day brother brown said let him that filthy be filthy still let him that's holy not will be holy no i'm going to be holy no no no he says no not will be holy holy now amen let him that's holy not a bob-haired woman she can't be now that sounds very flat but that's that's the scripture the bible says she's dishonor her head and her head is her husband is his husband his head is christ so she dishonors christ how can she be dishonorable and not be filthy see let she that god bob here keep it let he she that wears shorts keep on wearing them let he that denies the word keep on denying it but let him that be holy be holy still see once you're caught it's done and you don't know when that's going to be but i tell you what once the resurrection start you're done if you're not holy you're trapped is that all right because remember now when they start the new saints what what's so beautiful about this that we did not know we didn't know that before the rapture before the real changing of the body we did not know that our loved ones we will resurrect see a lot of us think that once they resurrect we're going to get right no you won't even see them amen only those who are holy and the reason why you will see them is because you in that dimension already you're in a spiritual atmosphere you're not struggling to live right you're there see we've got to understand if the blood saved us the blood can keep us and the bible said that not only that jesus is able to to save us to the uttermost not the almost the uttermost but we got to believe it the problem is we have we lack in prayer prayer is the key to the kingdom i'm telling you you know and you know we we we don't know how to pray most of us we we think a few words to god is all right no no no you got to worship this king you got to honor this king the protocol got to be right you want him to come down god doesn't seen you cry before you understand me but you want him to come down you want the anointing to come down and change you right into his court with thanksgiving into his engagement with praise you've got to enter after you've gone through your your protocol the next thing you do amen you've got to confess and ask god to cleanse you and keep you and all these kind of things and then the next thing you know he's going to take you there amen they ain't just asking him it's traveling where he is like brother say god don't come down to you you go there up to him by way of prayer by way of prayer and if you still on your knees and you still feel like you're earth bound you need to travel a little bit and your prayer should become a little more desperate more sincere and consecrated because god hear everybody talking every day he want to hear something that's real amen you love the lord now i'm saying this because you cannot tell me that this is not true because something's driving us even though we don't see it something's driving us well let me go this way something's driving me because y'all looking at me like y'all what are you talking about but something's driving me something's telling me there's an urgency something even time every time i falter i get scared something moves in me because i know this is not the time to be messing up y'all understand me see so we understand brother ramsay called the jehovah jairo he said but god put seraphims there guarding that tree that no one would touch it now it's got servants uh now is god's servants out trying to drive them into the tree them days they seen the vision they wanted to want it to the tree to get back without an atonement but now after an atonement is made the devil is blinding them turn them this way and and then turn from that uh turn them in this way and then that way from the tree is that right oh people love religion they love their bishop and their preacher listen there's no salvation in me the salvation is jesus christ that comes to the said blood of jesus christ and without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin that's the word amen we're saying that song come to jesus you got to come to jesus right church is okay but that's not your salvation this is not a a saving station jesus christ is the saving station but when you come on earth what happened the roman power i'm just saying you got to understand there's coming something to push you and this is the part i like and i'll bring it out in just a moment but we see this uh conglomeration of confusion brother branham told us it's in there it would be socialism that's moving the whole thing but behind that is catholicism see but the socialism thing is just a covering y'all better hear what i'm saying and all of this is because we rejected the gospel we took christ out of school right we took him out of politics right now even in the government amen when when when when they don't even mention jesus now you've got psalm that's trying to do so but in the socialism in that era of the of the of of this uh government you're the enemy and guess what it's been ordained to be this way amen oh you think oh they're gonna force these particular vaccines what vaccine it's not a vaccine say what you want to say i've had smallpox i mean chickenpops and mumps and measles and i've been vaccined for all those things once i got vaccine i never caught it you can't be vaccine vaccinated and then catch it again you're inoculated oh come on y'all so scared god what's wrong with you they can't see you they see me you can hardly eat men as loud as you want to y'all understand what i'm saying folks i'm not trying to tell you what to do but if you have to you make sure you pray with it amen because the bible said even if you have to pick up a serpent it shall not harm you don't you walk through the fire the fire can't burn you you walk through the waters he can't drown you if god is with you nothing no weapon formed against you shall prosper nothing amen so if it becomes law letter becomes law you got a greater law and that law is life don't be afraid of anything do i walk through the valleys in the shadows of death i fear no evil for thou art with me ain't no using fear that's what the devil want to put all this fear don't fear nothing whatever comes your way just ask god what to do because you know what he leads you and guides you hallelujah but he's sending a force and this force is to help us right it is to do what what do you know what ain't going to be nice it's not going to be nice because first of all you know it won't be a gathering like this we know it's coming but if you don't know who you are you don't understand that this is you this is for you this is what gonna make you bring you to that place where your faith is going to unite ignite amen and then you'll be changed from mortal to immortality hallelujah this is where god is getting ready to show off if i can see it like that among his bride it's a good thing brother it's a good thing and you and i must understand amen that oh listen brother branham said it like this i feel things that's what make me do what i do when you and i must understand by god's grace that nothing can stop the word of god and brother branham says it is only the denomination the organizations who do not recognize their day and its message you will never see the coming of the lord you'll never understand it and we don't have to understand it we got to believe it when christ came on the earth you know i don't have no special people i like people i love them but and sometimes i feel like i can do things and you know people you don't get the wrong idea about me i love everybody when christ came on earth he was god perfect tree david saw him in the first psalm said tree planted by the river river of water many rivers one water many gifts same spirit huh his leaves shall not wither and leaves represents praise it ain't going to stop but when he come on earth what happened the roman power cut the tree down and hung him on a man-made tree then god raised that tree up and set it at the right hand and sent the spirit back to make a bride for him amen like adam should have had had in the garden of eden hello when that tree tree started off it was a pentecostal tree but like i said sometime we get trapped hallelujah turn with me to revelation 17 and i'm going to close it down here if i preached something wrong you could always come revelation 17 14-17 these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overtake come them for he is the lord of lords the king of kings and they that are with him are called the chosen and faithful and he said unto me the waters which thou saweth where the sitteth are people and multitudes and nations and tongues and the ten horns with thou saweth upon the beast these shall hate the and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat her flesh and burn her with fire y'all understand that that means everybody that's left behind will face the great tribulation brother man said he looked behind him and all he could see from where he stood in america was craters and we're not ignorant god raised up russia forward and no matter how our country think we're the greatest you know i don't see people do that they think they're bad and they pick the fight and get beat up and the thing is all of this is because we did not recognize that our day see if we go on thinking we're in the seventh church age living like that you're going to always be a failure brother bradley said none not any was righteous and holy in that church age it was blackened out bishop pope priest name it pastor deacon nobody was righteous everything was filthy that's the word but he pulled us out like he did that woman at the well he pulled her out she knew something was wrong they said well brother if it's all over if it's already come to a in the seventh church why do you preach it he said because there's still a few in there when i was one of them they come to do what make war that's why i keep telling you everything is going to focus on us but during the time when they come together remember god always make a way of escape when they came amen to to conquer or to get jesus is that right they came to kill him kill everything right and god by an angel come and move them same thing with moses god always make a very escape when it comes to us but realize it was always a political disturbance that was going on that brought the scene that brought the set on the scene you and i must understand a wicked and adulterous generation which we are not and i'm closing but let me read this one more time we read this in closing recognizing your day in this message he said like israel back in her promised land she don't know how she got back there she was automatically put back there why national force put her in her place he says now i'm going to say something national force put israel in her homeland national forest will put the church in the world council of churches but the power of god will put the people in the bride while they're bringing their force god bringing his power see the world forces this way and the world forces that way but god forces upward the spirit of god which is in the world which which is the word of god my word is spirit and life will put the bride in her place because she'll recognize the position in the word then she's in christ will put her in her place no national force would do it but the national force did drive israel to the to the homeland the national force of the council of churches will drive every organization into it but the power of god will raise the bride into glory out of it so what are you saying do y'all get the picture do you see it when this power when this forces begin to work that's you that's when the power of god comes and delivers us oh i love it it's so close it's so close and all of this was under the seventh seal you said why would you say that this was it was this was preached in 1964. after the seals so every message he preached he was preaching secrets and and giving us all kinds of stuff to look at and then to go into the old testament and everything pull it all out of it so you can see who you recognizing your day it's all about you it's all about you now and we could have never come to this position in christ had it not been for calvary amen the blood of jesus christ amen if like i said you've heard me say it if you stop pleasing preaching calvary and the blood of jesus christ like i've seen other people do oh the bride ain't nothing without it that's right the only reason why she she is because she was marching to the tomb onward christian soldier marching as to war with the cross you can't get rid of the cross with the cross of jesus going on before that was her salvation that was her hiding place that's what made this message possible for us when you can understand your life is under that seal it was the thing that was hidden from all of uh and right now the devil brother talks about how we can come to a place where the devil won't even know what to do with us now you think that's your willpower absolutely not that's god's power god's power let's stand you know i i said i preached all of this to bring us to a point because there are so many people in this message who think they can just live any kind of way i'm saying folks this is a time to make sure you're holy how are you going to become holy by receiving the holy ghost that's how you become holy it ain't your righteousness it's his righteousness and once we see that how badly we need the holy ghost not tomorrow today now we need the holy ghost to fill every five of our beings we've got to come to a place that is nonsense that we i'm talking to me we allow the devil to just trip us up sometimes so easily put up a fight show who who you are absolutely bring that thing to your mouth with authority jesus whipped the devil why do you think that why do you think that jesus didn't you you use his power he used the authority of the word see because if you really are believing the word when you speak it you know it cannot come back forward god is real to us he's real to me [Music] and i just don't understand sometimes when we fail to see what god is trying to do with us sometimes i don't think you know but i'll leave that alone but i'm not here for a show and i'm not here to try to find some strange doctrine i'm just trying to tell you what the prophet said and the word and i have already determined in my mind and my soul what i plan to do and that to make a hundred not by power not by might but by my spirit said the lord and that devil tricks us and trips us till we think that we can get so busy we get too busy we get too busy we do too much and it's oh god help me he'll help you if you're willing to change it's got to be your will he's not going to ravish you or make you do nothing whosoever will let him come that's the bible anybody desire prayer foreign [Music] father we pray right now spirit of god
