[33:27] amen let's stop there for now
[33:31] amen amen so we are still speaking on
[33:35] fatherhood still still speaking on the
[33:37] house amen you know brother Brenham says
[33:41] uh the house of God shall live again
[33:43] amen amen amen and uh I believe that we
[33:47] are part of that
[33:49] house hallelu so uh we are trying to
[33:53] move on we'll try to move on tonight and
[33:57] uh won't hold you for too long since
[34:01] it's our communion
[34:02] service but uh we'll try to say as much
[34:05] as we can
[34:06] amen amen so we realize that uh uh the
[34:13] promises of God are true yes am amen and
[34:18] and God doesn't change his mind about
[34:21] his wi amen and we we have to look at
[34:26] things the way God sees them or the way
[34:29] God is presenting them to us uh and his
[34:32] ways are not our ways they are very
[34:35] different from our ways uh and we saw
[34:39] how uh the house can be uh more than
[34:45] just your children yes amen amen it can
[34:48] be more than just that amen like when
[34:51] when we look at the house of Moses the
[34:54] house of Moses was not just himself his
[34:57] wife and his children amen he he didn't
[35:00] just believe only for those he the Bible
[35:03] says by faith he forsook
[35:07] Egypt so he believed for the whole of
[35:10] Israel amen so it was not only for his
[35:13] wife and and Sons and no no no no no it
[35:16] was more than that and as I said this
[35:18] morning he even believed for their
[35:20] animals am we won't even leave a wolf
[35:23] right here in Egypt amen so uh we we
[35:27] these things are reaching for our
[35:29] learning I like what the prophet says in
[35:32] fundamental foundation for Faith he says
[35:35] sometimes we think how great Moses is
[35:36] how great these uh you know prophets are
[35:39] in the Bible he says they saw our day
[35:42] and embrace it am amen amen they Embrace
[35:45] these promises right here amen that's
[35:48] how that's what made them great amen so
[35:51] in short Moses saw this message he saw
[35:54] the third pool he saw all these things
[35:56] that's why he could speak the word then
[35:58] under the blood of animals amen so here
[36:02] it is and the day is right here so we we
[36:05] are not supposed to be afraid of nothing
[36:07] amen we we must claim it we must possess
[36:10] it
[36:12] amen now you know I I don't see things
[36:14] this straight this way sometimes I take
[36:16] something something here and something
[36:18] there but it all builds up I hope you
[36:22] you you understand me now amen now in
[36:27] this
[36:28] message restoration of the Bride tree
[36:32] there's something wonderful I found
[36:34] there brother Brenham says uh he talks
[36:38] about winter Easter because you see the
[36:43] the
[36:44] world has got the Northern Hemisphere
[36:48] and the southern
[36:51] hemisphere Easter
[36:53] time to you to you here in the northern
[36:59] hemisphere is
[37:01] Springtime for us it's winter
[37:05] time now he was speaking and he was in
[37:09] the northern hemisphere he says Easter
[37:13] is time of restoration amen but it's
[37:17] amazing when you take the Earth as a
[37:19] whole for us to have life we must also
[37:23] have death
[37:24] amen even in a chrisan in life for us to
[37:28] have life there must be death we die to
[37:32] self we die to our thoughts we die to
[37:34] our ways we die to everything that is us
[37:37] so that we can have the Life of Christ
[37:38] amen amen so when in the southern
[37:42] hemisphere is death you know the grass
[37:45] is dying the trees are dying and so on
[37:47] to you in the northern hemisphere is
[37:50] Easter it's spring time it's restoration
[37:54] time amen it's a resurrection time
[37:58] amen then the prophet says he says when
[38:00] the time comes when the time of of of of
[38:03] Easter come when the time of spring
[38:06] comes he says the flower claims that
[38:08] he's got a right to resurrect am he says
[38:12] then the law of God turns the Earth
[38:15] around brings it closer to the to the
[38:18] sun and the sun forces everything that
[38:22] the winter death killed to bring it back
[38:26] am amen amen but how does it start it
[38:30] starts with a flower claiming a so
[38:32] everything here is going to start with
[38:34] us claiming it amen confessing
[38:39] it amen then God will make everything he
[38:43] will even make our situation obey our
[38:45] confession what did the shite woman say
[38:48] it is well and it had to be well oh
[38:51] sorry this thing must be in the pocket
[38:54] yes death had to bring a son yes amen
[38:58] she said it is well the situation had to
[39:00] be well so a child of God we as a
[39:03] children of God even what we say we must
[39:06] watch it we must say the right thing we
[39:09] must think right things we must confess
[39:10] the right thing in the midst of all
[39:13] those troubles the woman said it is well
[39:17] amen a son is
[39:19] dead everybody's crying and so on but
[39:22] she said it is well amen hallelujah and
[39:26] it had to be well
[39:29] amen you look if you look at all the
[39:32] Christian songs they are
[39:34] positive they are
[39:36] positive all of them there's no negative
[39:39] Christian song you you can look at them
[39:42] all and very courageous amen and and the
[39:46] prophet says As we sing these things as
[39:48] we say these things we we we are
[39:51] confessing it even in our songs we are
[39:54] confessing amen that's good it's a
[39:57] confession
[39:59] amen and it's in the scripture amen you
[40:03] must even talk to yourself don't
[40:06] worry and talk to yourself about your
[40:08] debts and your problems and all that the
[40:10] Bible says talk to yourself in
[40:13] HS amen and
[40:16] Psalms so when when when we are even
[40:19] alone there's no virtue in worry amen so
[40:22] we have to say the right things even to
[40:24] ourselves amen amen so the flower claims
[40:28] the resurrection so that's why we are
[40:30] saying this things so that we should
[40:32] have something to talk about we should
[40:34] have something that we can claim and say
[40:36] this one is my promise is mine I believe
[40:39] it yes
[40:42] amen
[40:44] so what a man this Moses was amen now we
[40:50] we saw how he said those things I mean
[40:54] things were not looking good when he was
[40:55] saying that Israel was still slaves they
[40:59] they they were still I mean Pharaoh was
[41:00] still having an upper hand but he told
[41:02] him we won't even leave a ho here those
[41:05] things were not said when things were
[41:07] fine when they were when they were when
[41:08] they were out of Egypt and towards the
[41:10] Red Sea no they were still in boundage
[41:13] he said we are not leaving a wolf
[41:15] here we are not leaving our children
[41:18] here we are not leaving anyone here so
[41:20] he believed for them he beli for their
[41:22] children for their animals for
[41:24] everything amen that's that's that's
[41:28] fatherhood that's what a prophet means
[41:31] amen that's why we could find in the
[41:33] Book of Daniel Amen the Bible doesn't
[41:35] mention anything wrong about the life of
[41:37] Daniel but we find Daniel praying and
[41:41] confessing his sins and the sins of
[41:44] Israel yes amen interceding for the
[41:48] whole nation as a
[41:54] prophet so preaching is not just
[41:57] standing and telling people things he's
[42:00] also going behind the scenes and praying
[42:02] for them and praying for their children
[42:04] and confessing to God and interceding
[42:07] and coming between God and the people
[42:09] amen and having a bearing for the people
[42:11] amen so what a great man this Moses is
[42:15] and what a lesson we learn from him and
[42:18] brother sister we realize
[42:21] that they came out but I want to read
[42:24] something here for you from the
[42:30] prophet till brother bam came we had
[42:32] nothing to
[42:36] say
[42:38] uh this is found in the message Hebrews
[42:42] chapter
[42:44] 3 paragraph
[42:47] 137 and the pillar of fire was sent to
[42:52] Moses and Moses was sent to the children
[42:56] of of
[42:58] Israel I like
[43:01] that
[43:03] so uh the pillar of fire is sent to
[43:06] Moses and Moses sent to
[43:10] Israel so Moses saw the pillar of fire
[43:14] am they were not seeing the pillar of
[43:16] fire they were seeing
[43:18] Moses okay that's how it
[43:23] was even in the New Testament is like
[43:26] that Paul said follow me as I follow
[43:29] Christ so he's following the same Pillar
[43:31] of Fire that Moses followed and he said
[43:34] you follow me as I follow
[43:39] Christ
[43:41] so the pillar of fire appeared in the
[43:44] Old Testament and Moses wrote the Old
[43:48] Testament appeared to Paul you know on
[43:51] the on the day of Pentecost in the upper
[43:53] room uh the pillar of fire came divided
[43:56] himself amongst the
[44:00] people uh but when he came to
[44:03] Paul it was not part of the pillar of
[44:06] fire it was a complete Pillar of Fire
[44:08] coming to the
[44:10] messenger and he wrote the New
[44:16] Testament but the book was
[44:20] sealed amen all this while the book was
[44:25] sealed
[44:27] now when the pillar of fire
[44:30] returned and appeared again in this end
[44:32] time it was not to write the Bible the
[44:35] Bible has been written but it was to
[44:38] reveal amen the entire book and it
[44:43] became a new
[44:47] book okay so he came in this hour to
[44:52] manifest what has been written and to
[44:55] bring it to life and to make sure that
[44:58] we become the
[45:00] book you are what you eat amen when
[45:05] Ezekiel ate the scroll then the scroll
[45:08] disappeared then Ezekiel became the
[45:10] scroll
[45:10] himself
[45:12] amen you know uh uh uh uh uh back
[45:17] home the olden days the doctors would uh
[45:21] prescribe
[45:23] medicine uh sometimes tablets
[45:26] so then they had uh these little plastic
[45:29] uh bags that they would write on there
[45:31] on those uh take three times a day now
[45:36] this other man he understood it his own
[45:38] way so the doctor gave him uh
[45:42] tablets then he would just take them and
[45:44] hold them like that in the morning put
[45:47] it
[45:48] down afternoon he would do the same
[45:51] thing in the evening the same thing and
[45:53] his health was just deteriorating
[45:56] he went back to the doctor and the
[45:58] doctor looked at him now the doctor
[45:59] knowing what those drugs can do then
[46:04] what he saw and what he knows it was not
[46:07] telling up then he said where are the
[46:09] where are the tablets and when he gave
[46:11] them to him and he started counting
[46:13] there were 30 he gave him 30 and there
[46:15] were still 30 he said but no wonder you
[46:17] are like this he said no doctor it is
[46:19] Rich and take so I would just take them
[46:22] said no you need to drink them so you
[46:25] see so long as he's got the tablets and
[46:28] the tablets are not part of his body
[46:31] part of his system they can't help him
[46:33] amen amen we can have the Bible we can
[46:35] have the message we can have it in all
[46:37] formats so long as we don't take the
[46:40] thing and we don't put it in our souls
[46:42] so long as it's not part of you it won't
[46:44] help you amen so you have to feed on it
[46:48] until you become part of it until flesh
[46:52] becomes wet and wet becomes
[46:54] flesh amen amen then the prophecy is you
[46:57] can stand back and you see the word
[46:59] acting through you there comes a time is
[47:02] no longer an effort to do to to be a
[47:04] Christian the way just EXs through
[47:08] you amen now coming back to this Moses
[47:13] saw the pillar of fire the pillar of
[47:15] fire was sent to Moses Moses was sent to
[47:17] the people so everybody knew that there
[47:21] is a shorter route to the promised land
[47:25] but most Moses himself he also knew that
[47:28] he didn't take that road he took a
[47:31] longer road that goes all the way to the
[47:34] Red Sea H against his own better
[47:37] judgment but he was following the pillar
[47:41] of fire amen the pillar of fire has been
[47:44] sent to Moses and Moses has been sent to
[47:46] the people so Moses is following the
[47:49] pillar of fire they must follow Moses am
[47:52] amen amen I'm sure they were saying hey
[47:55] we wonder today what is really going on
[47:58] here we were supposed to come this way I
[48:01] mean even the sons of Jacob when they
[48:04] went to buy food in Egypt they didn't
[48:08] cross the Red
[48:09] Sea no there is another road but Moses
[48:14] didn't take that one why he was being
[48:17] led by
[48:19] God Amen so he followed the pillar of
[48:24] fire he not a knowing what here is is
[48:27] following the pillar of fire and I'm
[48:29] telling you as we follow the messenger
[48:32] of this day we are also following the
[48:34] pillar of fire am amen amen so they
[48:39] followed Moses and he led them all the
[48:41] way down to the Red Sea brother Brenham
[48:44] says there was a mountain this side and
[48:46] a mountain this side and a and the Sea
[48:49] before
[48:51] them and Pharaoh his heart is hardened
[48:54] he started coming after
[48:57] them he started coming after them when
[49:00] they looked there was just a cloud of
[49:02] dust chiots of fire and I mean Chariots
[49:06] of uh Pharaoh's Army and and and when
[49:10] they came closer and closer and it was
[49:12] not just ordinary men highly trained
[49:16] men and bow and arrows were I mean the
[49:19] bow and arrows you know they were drawn
[49:22] and Target was chosen and and the swords
[49:26] in the air and Spears and everything
[49:28] ready just to
[49:31] Smite and the people said to Moses Moses
[49:33] Moses they never said the pill of fire
[49:35] they said Moses why did you bring us
[49:37] this far we told you this thing won't
[49:39] work were there not better graves in
[49:41] Egypt you see they were seeing Moses
[49:43] they were not seeing the pillar of fire
[49:45] Moses is the one who brought them there
[49:48] but Moses the pillar of fire brought him
[49:50] there
[49:51] am so their complain was against Moses
[49:56] then he said hold your peace keep still
[50:00] the Egyptians that you see you shall see
[50:03] them no
[50:06] more and we know what happened
[50:09] there when Moses cried to God God said
[50:11] why cry speak and he had already spoken
[50:14] the
[50:17] word then God did something great he
[50:23] opened the Red Sea
[50:26] water became a wall to
[50:30] water it was not ice it was
[50:34] water he open the Red Sea not just for
[50:38] two three people no for two million
[50:41] people and their
[50:42] enal so it was quite a big place that
[50:46] got open amen and they walked on dry
[50:51] ground
[50:52] but what I like is this
[50:56] I think I went ahead of
[50:58] myself I should have read something here
[51:00] for you but it's not a problem we can
[51:02] read it yeah in paragraph 3 138 he says
[51:06] God loves to bring you in
[51:12] trouble so when Trouble Comes is not
[51:14] because we've
[51:16] sinned it's not because things have gone
[51:18] wrong and we' have done something wrong
[51:19] the devil will come and tell us those
[51:21] things but the prophet says God loves to
[51:24] bring you in
[51:26] trouble I tell you brother sister this
[51:28] message is not charismatic movement no
[51:31] no no no no no no yeah we we we we see
[51:34] the reality of things now here amen all
[51:37] the time we pray and pray and we want
[51:39] trouble to be away from us but the
[51:41] Propet says God loves to bring you in
[51:45] trouble
[51:48] amen he loves to put trouble down and
[51:51] see what you'll do about it like we said
[51:53] in the morning amen those Brothers of
[51:56] Joseph they hated him and all that it
[51:59] was what he needed that was a blessing
[52:01] for
[52:03] him now here we read something else
[52:05] again God loves to bring you in trouble
[52:09] so while we are here it will be trouble
[52:11] after trouble trial after trial testing
[52:15] after
[52:18] testing the only thing that doesn't love
[52:21] troubles or love challenges is a river
[52:26] when a river flows this way and there's
[52:27] rocks
[52:29] and then it will turn it it will turn it
[52:31] will go this way find some soft spot and
[52:34] then go straight again and just like
[52:36] that but a Christian in it all we have
[52:39] to go through
[52:40] it so he brings us into
[52:45] trouble all of
[52:47] us will have something that we must
[52:50] fight for fight
[52:52] against all of us and you you know
[52:55] brother and sister it even comes to a
[52:57] point no one can help
[52:59] you no one can help you that's why
[53:01] brother Brenham he preached that message
[53:03] contest very few pages I think it's
[53:05] about eight pages or so and it's amazing
[53:08] okay he gave other examples but there's
[53:10] one example that he dwelt much on he
[53:13] says you know if you are a boxer you
[53:15] must know your opponent and whether he
[53:17] leans forward or backwards you know
[53:19] whether he he you know he stands with
[53:22] his foot in front or I mean right foot
[53:24] in front or south or or whatever you
[53:26] know and and all those things he said
[53:28] you have to know that you have to know
[53:31] his punches you know and then you also
[53:33] must train and so on now it's amazing he
[53:37] used that now in boxing you can have a
[53:40] trainer you can have a sparing partner
[53:42] you have all those but once you get in
[53:45] the dream you go in
[53:47] alone you are not going in there with
[53:49] your trainer you're not going there with
[53:51] your sparring partner and so on you go
[53:53] in there alone even the referee will
[53:55] tell you you are all by yourself you
[53:58] must defend yourself you must attack you
[54:01] must you you you must know that you are
[54:03] all by
[54:04] yourself amen am and a Christian you are
[54:08] all by yourself amen amen there Comes A
[54:11] Time you are in this kind of things and
[54:13] and you have to pray it through but says
[54:16] you are going to do some fighting and
[54:18] you're going to do it on your knees not
[54:20] with your feet on your
[54:23] knees amen
[54:28] amen so God loves to bring us into
[54:33] trouble he loves to put trouble down and
[54:36] see what you'll do about
[54:39] it so he just stopped up the Red Sea and
[54:43] the first thing you know March them
[54:46] right out into this place then sent
[54:48] Pharaoh after them see how God likes to
[54:51] do it he loves to display his
[54:55] power and
[54:59] love so it's not just troubles
[55:02] coming no he also wants to display his
[55:07] power and his
[55:11] love he doesn't gamble with the souls of
[55:14] his children no when he brings trouble
[55:18] he wants to flex his
[55:23] muscles now let's read something here
[55:25] let's read few things here let's read
[55:27] something here in First Corinthians I
[55:29] think chapter
[55:32] 10 read something
[55:54] there
[55:58] 1 Corinthians
[56:01] 10:13 there has no temptation taken you
[56:06] but such as is common to men but God is
[56:11] faithful who will not suffer you to be
[56:13] tempted above that he are able but with
[56:18] uh but will with the Temptation also
[56:20] make a way to escape that he may be able
[56:25] to Bear
[56:26] it amen so he brings a a trial a testing
[56:31] he brings you into trouble but he going
[56:33] to make a way amen he's going to make a
[56:37] way this thing is not coming to destroy
[56:40] you it is coming to take you higher amen
[56:44] you know like when the winds are blowing
[56:46] and they are very strong and the winds
[56:49] they keep all the beds from going higher
[56:51] and higher and they must fly low and
[56:53] some of them must just land but the
[56:56] Eagle at that time with those kind of
[56:59] wings goes higher and higher and higher
[57:04] the eagle can Master the wind amen amen
[57:08] so a Christian whatever comes our way
[57:11] God knows he's not going to destroy you
[57:14] though he has brought you into this
[57:16] trouble he has made a way right in the
[57:19] trouble hallu now let's read another
[57:23] thing here in in in something again in
[57:25] Luke 10 verse
[57:28] 19 Luke 10: 19
[57:32] I it says here behold I give unto you
[57:36] power to tread on serpents and
[57:40] scorpions and over all the power of the
[57:43] enemy amen and nothing shall by any
[57:46] means hurt
[57:49] you amen though he allows trouble to
[57:52] come but nothing by any means amen the
[57:55] devil has got many
[57:57] means but all those means of the devil
[58:00] nothing will hurt you by any means so
[58:04] power over all the power of the enemy
[58:08] amen so even when he brought Israel
[58:10] right down to the Red Sea it was to show
[58:13] them his power Amen to show them his
[58:19] love I tell you brother sister God
[58:22] doesn't want us to look at things as
[58:26] human beings but he wants us to look at
[58:30] things as supernatural
[58:32] beings amen because if we are going to
[58:35] look at things as average human beings
[58:38] we will be
[58:39] discouraged amen but when he brings
[58:42] trouble when he brings all these things
[58:44] we don't have to look at those things as
[58:46] human beings even here they were not
[58:49] supposed to look at those things as
[58:52] average human beings don't think think
[58:54] about Graves don't think about all those
[58:56] things God didn't say you are coming to
[58:58] a grave is is he promised them to take
[59:01] them to a land flowing with milk and
[59:04] honey
[59:05] amen amen so we see here what did he do
[59:10] open the Red Sea there was no time to
[59:12] build a bridge none of them had a sorrow
[59:16] a spear but God was going to do
[59:18] something that is so great
[59:22] amen and he opened the Red Sea and they
[59:26] were marching and what did the pillar of
[59:29] fire do he went right behind
[59:33] Israel amen and he went
[59:36] between the Egyptians the Egyptian Army
[59:41] and the children of
[59:42] Israel now all the strong all the the
[59:48] the the the the the the young they were
[59:51] right in
[59:53] front right at the the back as Israel
[59:57] was marching the old people were right
[59:59] at the back people who can fight for
[1:00:03] themselves the very weak of Israel was
[1:00:07] right at the back amen so the strongest
[1:00:11] of Israel were going to start with the
[1:00:14] very weak ones of Israel people who
[1:00:17] won't fight for themselves but God came
[1:00:19] between the very strong of Egypt and the
[1:00:23] very weak of Israel amen hallelujah he
[1:00:27] protected them amen so tonight it
[1:00:30] doesn't matter how weak we are amen no
[1:00:32] we don't trust in our own strength we
[1:00:35] don't trust in our own efforts amen but
[1:00:38] we trust in God he's a mighty man of
[1:00:42] battle and he has never lost any battle
[1:00:45] Hallelujah Lord I don't believe that he
[1:00:47] will lose it in any of our
[1:00:50] lives so what a great thing it was amen
[1:00:53] even in the times of of Peter he said
[1:00:55] Peter the devil sought you but I've
[1:00:57] prayed for you fighting battles that
[1:00:59] Peter doesn't know
[1:01:01] about I believe that even tonight he
[1:01:04] goes between us in a lot of
[1:01:07] things amen you'll never leave us he
[1:01:10] will never forsake
[1:01:12] us so they crossed over and when we when
[1:01:16] they were on the other
[1:01:18] side then I believe that God said Moses
[1:01:21] now come here remember what you said the
[1:01:24] Egyptians that you see you shall see
[1:01:27] them no more while the Egyptians were in
[1:01:31] the middle of the sea and their cherot
[1:01:33] wheels were broken and they were deep in
[1:01:36] M now it was time for them to be M
[1:01:39] dobers and they were deep in mud and
[1:01:42] they can handle the mud and so on then
[1:01:45] the sea came back to its position they
[1:01:48] were drowned and and you can imagine
[1:01:50] what a victory it was there is
[1:01:53] Taskmaster s
[1:01:55] and there is another Taskmaster s so
[1:01:57] they were all dead and floating right
[1:01:59] there God finished everything until
[1:02:02] Pharaoh never followed them again amen
[1:02:05] there was never a time again that pH
[1:02:07] Pharaoh came after them that's right
[1:02:11] amen so it was a wonderful thing how
[1:02:14] Moses held on for them to such a
[1:02:17] glorious Victory am amen the faith of
[1:02:21] Moses didn't just take them out it took
[1:02:24] them
[1:02:25] in he took them
[1:02:28] in so tonight let's just look at
[1:02:31] something again and we close now we find
[1:02:36] another father in The Book of Job by the
[1:02:39] name of
[1:02:43] job very wonderful
[1:02:46] father it's a very amazing book The Book
[1:02:49] of Job because
[1:02:51] there uh we find Satan coming before
[1:02:55] God maybe he had a list of names and he
[1:02:58] said to God ah this one says he's a
[1:03:00] Christian look what he has done this one
[1:03:03] that one and God said okay but have you
[1:03:05] ever considered my servant job and to
[1:03:09] see that there's none like him there's
[1:03:10] no one that is like him in that whole
[1:03:12] list of
[1:03:13] yours ah that one you made you have made
[1:03:16] a wedge around him it's good to know
[1:03:19] that Satan even knows that God protects
[1:03:21] his children amen the devil knows that
[1:03:24] yes he knows that that we are protected
[1:03:28] people we had a brother one time
[1:03:31] preaching to us uh he he was from Congo
[1:03:34] and he told us something you know that
[1:03:36] one time uh they had a president there
[1:03:39] in
[1:03:40] DRC uh Democratic Republic of Congo and
[1:03:43] uh by the name of mabutu it was then Z
[1:03:49] so
[1:03:50] ma one of his sons came to him he said H
[1:03:53] dead
[1:03:56] I want you to buy me this car you know
[1:04:00] and the father was very cross with him
[1:04:02] he sent him away and he was
[1:04:05] angry so he said okay maybe uh
[1:04:09] today you know he's not so happy
[1:04:12] something upset him I'll see him some
[1:04:14] other time so he came next day and
[1:04:15] father was happy and cheerful he started
[1:04:17] the subject immediately father became
[1:04:19] angry again so he was wondering but
[1:04:24] what's going on ah let me forget about
[1:04:27] him so he picked up a phone the phone
[1:04:29] and then he called the bank
[1:04:32] manager told him I'm the son of the
[1:04:35] president and I saw this car I want it
[1:04:39] in this carer and it must be delivered
[1:04:42] at this time and uh at such a
[1:04:46] day and he dropped the phone come that
[1:04:49] day the car was there so he went to the
[1:04:52] father and he said Dad come and see my
[1:04:54] then the father was happy said yeah you
[1:04:56] must do things like that you are a son
[1:04:58] of of a president not going around and
[1:05:00] begging and begging and coming to me
[1:05:02] begging for things you must know who you
[1:05:04] are I believe God also treats us the
[1:05:08] same way why cry amen hallelujah why cry
[1:05:13] amen when we look in the word here and
[1:05:15] we see all these promises here they all
[1:05:17] belong to you yes sir brother sister let
[1:05:20] me shock you regardless of what your
[1:05:22] life is like regardless of what you have
[1:05:24] done you have to believe it like Samson
[1:05:28] when Samson had failed and done
[1:05:30] everything wrong he still knew that he's
[1:05:32] a
[1:05:33] Nazarite and God told him God told the
[1:05:36] mother of Samson that you don't have to
[1:05:39] eat this anything that is from the vine
[1:05:41] you don't have to drink anything from
[1:05:42] the vine you change your diet because
[1:05:45] you are going to give back to a
[1:05:47] Nazarite I believe that's why in the
[1:05:50] message we had to change the diet we
[1:05:52] couldn't we can't preach Baptist
[1:05:54] Doctrine and Methodist and all those we
[1:05:57] had to change the spiritual diet because
[1:05:59] we must produce
[1:06:01] nazarites amen people who are
[1:06:04] consecrated to God so and and and God
[1:06:07] told the the the wife of Manoa this one
[1:06:11] will be a Nazarite from birth to death
[1:06:15] God knew that there's a
[1:06:17] Delila he knew everything about Samson
[1:06:20] but anything that will come will never
[1:06:22] change that he's not a Nazarite because
[1:06:25] he took a Nazarite vow he is born a
[1:06:28] Nazarite amen
[1:06:31] hallelujah so there Samson we know how
[1:06:35] he failed you know with hot and with
[1:06:39] Delilah how he lied to Delilah several
[1:06:42] times and and and uh but the grace of
[1:06:46] God was with him you know we fail God a
[1:06:48] lot of times and even when we fail him
[1:06:51] and we do these wrong things and so on
[1:06:53] he doesn't does it mean that we should
[1:06:54] carry on that way no no it's God's grace
[1:06:57] to us
[1:06:59] amen that must never become a habit no
[1:07:03] but it's just the grace of
[1:07:06] God you know and and the power of God
[1:07:09] was still in his life but after he told
[1:07:14] Delilah the secret and we know his hair
[1:07:17] was cut then he was out of the word the
[1:07:20] word was broken and the power left him
[1:07:24] then he was just an ordinary man pled
[1:07:27] his eyes out there he was kept captive
[1:07:30] by the very enemy he was born to
[1:07:34] destroy then they had this big time they
[1:07:37] are going to have this uh big
[1:07:40] celebration uh thanking Dagon for
[1:07:43] delivering
[1:07:44] their Enemy Number One Samson into their
[1:07:48] hands not realizing that this guy he
[1:07:52] comes from the tribe of den and that
[1:07:54] tribe of den the emblem of den is Eagle
[1:07:58] this one is a child of God he's an eagle
[1:08:01] he can
[1:08:02] renew his
[1:08:05] strength he's not down and out no then
[1:08:10] while he was there and and they they
[1:08:13] they brought him to make spot imagine
[1:08:15] the very thing that is supposed to
[1:08:18] destroy he must entertain it like that's
[1:08:21] what the church has become not the bride
[1:08:23] the church yes the very demons that The
[1:08:26] Church Must cast out and they they they
[1:08:29] must be under their feet those are the
[1:08:32] demons they entertaining in the church
[1:08:33] now amen now Samson he came and he can
[1:08:38] see them and there he's standing and uh
[1:08:41] he just as the little boy bring me
[1:08:43] between the two pillars and uh he still
[1:08:46] believes that he will have
[1:08:48] Victory if there was a man who was
[1:08:50] supposed to be discouraged the Samson he
[1:08:51] can't see them he can't see his enemy
[1:08:54] but there he comes between those two
[1:08:56] pillars he said Lord once more let me
[1:09:00] die with my enemies he knew very well
[1:09:04] this time for him to have Victory he
[1:09:06] must be prepared to die amen amen so a
[1:09:10] lot of things in our lives can't change
[1:09:12] until we die to ourselves amen amen when
[1:09:16] we are willing to come on the Altar and
[1:09:18] lay that Soul on the altar let the Holy
[1:09:21] Ghost Fire come and consume the second
[1:09:25] amen and God change the entire being of
[1:09:28] the human soul and and and make you a
[1:09:30] new creature in Christ am until the old
[1:09:33] things have passed away
[1:09:36] amen so to pass away it means to die
[1:09:40] also amen but Samson imagine brother
[1:09:44] sister standing there he said Lord once
[1:09:46] more I like the way brother Brenham said
[1:09:48] it Samson never thought about his
[1:09:51] failures but bam said he thought about
[1:09:53] the victories that he had that's the
[1:09:56] only way you can come back amen we we
[1:10:00] cannot think about how we failed and how
[1:10:03] the wrong things we have done once you
[1:10:05] think like that you can't get higher
[1:10:07] than that but if we can think of how
[1:10:10] many prayers we made and they were
[1:10:12] answered amen how many Souls we led to
[1:10:15] the Lord how many people we prayed for
[1:10:18] even as a church those testimonies we
[1:10:21] must never forget them
[1:10:24] yes as a Christian you need your
[1:10:28] memory you must be able to
[1:10:31] remember amen like if you look in the
[1:10:34] Psalms of David it's amazing he talks a
[1:10:36] lot even about victories that were won
[1:10:39] and he was not there you know he talks
[1:10:42] about the times of Moses and and and all
[1:10:45] those times and those victories and he
[1:10:47] was seeing about those things he was
[1:10:49] meditating about those things that's why
[1:10:51] he was the kind of man he was
[1:10:54] so God help us brother sister so the
[1:10:57] enemy also is presenting us his
[1:10:59] staff but we must look in the word
[1:11:03] that's where our identity
[1:11:06] is in the message why Christ speak the
[1:11:08] prophet say the difference between us
[1:11:10] and Samson is that Samson knew who he
[1:11:13] was and US half the time we don't
[1:11:17] know we don't
[1:11:19] know we don't know he he never thought
[1:11:22] of how he failed with he fell with
[1:11:24] Delilah and harot and and all those
[1:11:26] things and he's lying and all that no no
[1:11:29] no brother sister I can even say
[1:11:31] something again here you know you you
[1:11:33] take Jonah Jonah never obeyed God God
[1:11:36] said go to n Jonah is going his own way
[1:11:39] and the fish God prepared it he knew
[1:11:43] Jonah was going to go that way that fish
[1:11:46] was already in the sea waiting for
[1:11:48] him it was a ot looking fish amen you
[1:11:52] can't even find that one even today am
[1:11:55] that one was just prepared for Jonah so
[1:11:57] yeah they start sailing and they're
[1:11:59] going to Tes and then when they were far
[1:12:01] from where they came from and still far
[1:12:04] from where they are going then the
[1:12:06] Tempest
[1:12:08] started they throw chicken meat out the
[1:12:10] fish is not
[1:12:12] interested beef and all those things and
[1:12:14] the fish is not interested they
[1:12:17] offloaded almost the whole ship then the
[1:12:19] next thing they had to do throw Jonah
[1:12:21] out that's what the fish wanted am he
[1:12:24] didn't he didn't uh he didn't you
[1:12:27] know fist on Jonah no it swalled him
[1:12:32] amen that's not your shark that's not
[1:12:34] your killer wave no he just swallowed
[1:12:38] Jonah
[1:12:39] am when the fish swallowed Jonah you
[1:12:43] know and there he is now in the B of A
[1:12:46] Fish and uh floating and swimming in the
[1:12:49] in the in the vomit of the
[1:12:52] fish Jonah said all these are lying
[1:12:55] vities once again will I look towards
[1:12:58] the direction of the
[1:13:00] temple he never even thought I'm in this
[1:13:03] mess because I disobeyed God no he never
[1:13:07] even thought about his backslidings he
[1:13:09] said I I will once again look towards
[1:13:11] the direction of the temple you know
[1:13:13] brother brendam says in one of uh those
[1:13:16] messages when love projects He says you
[1:13:19] as a child of God you create a situation
[1:13:23] yes amen we don't just create an
[1:13:26] atmosphere we also create a situation so
[1:13:30] here is Jonah in the belly of a fish can
[1:13:34] we read that very nice very nice very
[1:13:37] nice let's go to Jonah chapter
[1:13:40] 2 it's a very nice thing
[1:13:43] there let's just
[1:13:45] read Jonah chapter
[1:13:49] 2
[1:13:52] now
[1:13:54] verse
[1:13:54] one then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his
[1:13:58] God out of the fish's
[1:14:02] belly he didn't jump up and down and
[1:14:05] pull here and pull there you know we we
[1:14:09] have what they call toy toing there in
[1:14:11] South Africa where you just jump on one
[1:14:13] feet and then you change hey no we never
[1:14:15] done such things that's a revolutionary
[1:14:18] you know dance no Jonah never done such
[1:14:21] things there no no no no no no no what
[1:14:25] he did he in the pale of a fish he prais
[1:14:27] to God now let's read verse
[1:14:31] 10 and the Lord spake unto the fish and
[1:14:36] it vomited out Jonah upon the dry
[1:14:41] land he's in the bell of a fish he's not
[1:14:43] trying anything there he speaks to God
[1:14:46] and God spoke to the
[1:14:48] fish I like this scripture very much I
[1:14:52] tell you brother sister it's such an
[1:14:53] encouragement you know uh children when
[1:14:56] they are young they they they they they
[1:14:58] impersonate preachers they they are very
[1:15:01] spiritual and they but as they grow then
[1:15:04] Satan comes in and they go through
[1:15:05] changes and and you know this change and
[1:15:08] that change and as the prophet says
[1:15:10] after every seven years there's a change
[1:15:13] but you know I believe that if you took
[1:15:16] that child and dedicated that child to
[1:15:18] the Lord amen and you you you name that
[1:15:22] child Rejoice amen uh even when times
[1:15:26] like that comes she still Rejoice she's
[1:15:29] not the
[1:15:30] devil she's not a devil she still
[1:15:32] Rejoice you can speak to the God who
[1:15:35] created that child am like Jonah he
[1:15:38] spoke to the god that created the fish
[1:15:40] the fish has got a
[1:15:41] Creator so he spoke to the Creator and
[1:15:45] the Creator spoke to the fish so you can
[1:15:49] speak to God and God can speak to your
[1:15:51] boss at work amen yes sir God can speak
[1:15:53] to your wife God can speak to your
[1:15:55] children God can speak to these people
[1:15:57] they are a
[1:15:59] creation
[1:16:01] hallelujah
[1:16:03] amen so Jonah right in the belly of a
[1:16:08] fish he spoke to God brother Bram says
[1:16:12] and right in there the vomit went one
[1:16:15] side and right in there there was oxygen
[1:16:18] he lived in the bed of a fish for three
[1:16:20] nights and for three days and three
[1:16:22] nights
[1:16:23] because of prayer yes amen right in
[1:16:27] there he created a situation yes in a
[1:16:32] situation amen so when we are in a
[1:16:35] situation is not yet over am
[1:16:39] no that's why brother says God wants to
[1:16:42] see what you'll do about
[1:16:48] it so let's take courage amen so here is
[1:16:53] on these people they knew who they were
[1:16:55] Jonah never thought about backslidings
[1:16:57] and Samson never thought about all those
[1:16:59] things and that's why things
[1:17:03] changed so you and I it must be the same
[1:17:07] thing amen when things go wrong never
[1:17:10] ever dare say oh I think you know
[1:17:12] brother there's somewhere where I didn't
[1:17:14] do right that's why no no no no no no no
[1:17:16] God loves bringing you into
[1:17:19] trouble to show his power to show his
[1:17:23] love so that you can have a testimony
[1:17:25] also am so that you can have a song Amen
[1:17:29] after the Red Sea they were singing a
[1:17:33] song yes they had a song Moses sang in
[1:17:36] the spirit and they were all dancing and
[1:17:38] shouting and rejoicing so every trouble
[1:17:42] that they came in that they came across
[1:17:45] you realize that the message of that day
[1:17:47] met any condition amen when they don't
[1:17:50] have food God gave them food that
[1:17:52] message supplied food amen when there's
[1:17:54] no water the message supplied water amen
[1:17:57] so there's no need that that message
[1:17:59] didn't Supply it met every
[1:18:05] condition
[1:18:06] so now back to the Book of Job and uh we
[1:18:12] find that this book of
[1:18:15] job as I said the devil came to God it's
[1:18:18] amazing the devil is the enemy of God he
[1:18:20] started he he he caus a split in heaven
[1:18:23] yes he caused havoc in
[1:18:26] heaven and uh but God can still speak to
[1:18:30] the devil
[1:18:32] amen amen that's right yeah that Satan
[1:18:36] came to God and they were having a
[1:18:38] conversation and God said good morning
[1:18:39] Satan good morning devil where do you
[1:18:41] come from no you know I was in my
[1:18:45] business going up and down to and fro in
[1:18:48] that whole earth and so on
[1:18:51] okay
[1:18:53] and yet today some people are Christians
[1:18:55] they can't talk to
[1:18:56] someone huh and yet our father can talk
[1:19:01] to the
[1:19:05] devil and some of these people we think
[1:19:07] their seed is just G work we don't
[1:19:11] know it's not even a gift of discernment
[1:19:13] is just guess work gift of
[1:19:16] Suspicion but God knew this one is a
[1:19:19] devil
[1:19:21] am the prophet say you know when he
[1:19:23] talks about Cain in in all the days of
[1:19:26] our lives that message the prophet says
[1:19:29] when Cain brought that sacrifice it was
[1:19:31] not a right sacrifice fruits and all
[1:19:33] that it was not right he said but God
[1:19:36] loved him that's why he went to him to
[1:19:39] correct him to show him how to do
[1:19:43] it and God knowing very well that this
[1:19:45] is not my son this is a son of the devil
[1:19:49] but he still loved him I said my our
[1:19:52] father he does things in a different way
[1:19:56] and we are supposed to be like our
[1:19:58] father
[1:20:00] amen amen so the devil also visits
[1:20:04] God his own
[1:20:06] enemy The Very one who's going to
[1:20:08] destroy him he still visits him he still
[1:20:10] goes there and he knocks on his door and
[1:20:12] God opens the door so if I don't talk to
[1:20:15] someone I'm worse than the devil
[1:20:17] then because he's my enemy then I'm
[1:20:20] worse than Satan I'm worse than oh my
[1:20:22] God help us amen and these are the
[1:20:25] things that the enemy brings upon us if
[1:20:27] you look at it we were not meant to be
[1:20:29] that way when we were young we could mix
[1:20:32] with
[1:20:33] anyone yeah little children they don't
[1:20:35] know color they don't know all these
[1:20:36] things and and and and they don't know
[1:20:39] you know they they fast and fight now
[1:20:41] but and you give you give them a hiding
[1:20:43] now you spend them now and it's not long
[1:20:46] after you know few seconds they are on
[1:20:48] your lap again and you know and happy
[1:20:51] and and that's how how how we
[1:20:54] were that's how we were but as we grow
[1:20:58] we learn a lot of things we go to school
[1:21:00] we read a lot of books and and uh
[1:21:03] complexes come in and this and the other
[1:21:05] but is not supposed to be that
[1:21:10] way that's why this message came to
[1:21:14] teach us one more time to
[1:21:17] laugh and you know I I I I like the way
[1:21:21] brother Bram does things he he he brings
[1:21:23] it to us so simple he makes things

[1:22:55] must be visiting people even if they
[1:22:58] don't come to my home I must go to them
[1:23:00] amen you know and and you just continue
[1:23:02] like
[1:23:04] that and it grows it will never stay
[1:23:08] like that it will grow to Divine love
[1:23:12] where you are able to love and even love
[1:23:16] our bitterest
[1:23:19] enemy
[1:23:21] amen now
[1:23:23] you know like in the Book of Job the
[1:23:25] challenges of job it was not losing his
[1:23:28] Kettle and and all those things no no no
[1:23:30] no no no yes that was trouble but God
[1:23:32] loved bringing him into that trouble he
[1:23:35] allowed the devil to come and do all
[1:23:36] those things and job stood in all that
[1:23:41] he never sinned against God he just
[1:23:43] worshiped
[1:23:46] God but the greatest test of them all it
[1:23:50] was right at the end right in the for
[1:23:52] the second chapter of job where God now
[1:23:55] said to those people to elant and his
[1:23:58] friends I will never hear your prayers
[1:24:00] go to job he must pray for you only him
[1:24:03] will I accept imagine now he must come
[1:24:06] and intercede for this guys who were
[1:24:09] finding fault with him all these
[1:24:12] years amen that was the greatest
[1:24:18] test brother bam says it like this in
[1:24:21] adoption
[1:24:24] he says Grace is not I scratch you
[1:24:27] scratch my back and I scratch your back
[1:24:30] he says Grace is I scratch your B
[1:24:33] whether you scratch mine or not it
[1:24:35] doesn't matter I scratch your
[1:24:37] B then he goes F he
[1:24:42] says you smack me while he still hting
[1:24:46] and you say hey my back needs scratching
[1:24:49] so while I'm nursing the pain I scratch
[1:24:52] your
[1:24:54] back now that's
[1:24:58] something these people never said to Job
[1:25:00] we sorry he's still nursing the pain of
[1:25:04] all the words and and and all the things
[1:25:07] and so on and I mean one place job said
[1:25:09] for how long will these vain words
[1:25:12] continue you know you are miserable
[1:25:14] Physicians you know so they were not
[1:25:16] saying anything good they were not
[1:25:18] helping
[1:25:19] him no while he still hting he must
[1:25:23] scatch their back he must pray for
[1:25:27] them so it takes the grace of God to for
[1:25:30] us to do
[1:25:31] that amen and and I know you know it
[1:25:36] just takes us to heal and surrender the
[1:25:39] more we surrender the more God is taking
[1:25:42] us to that
[1:25:43] place
[1:25:46] yes for now it sounds like it's
[1:25:49] impossible no don't worry when God has
[1:25:53] put you to that spot he will allow a
[1:25:56] situation to come and you will do it
[1:25:57] exactly that way you will just do it the
[1:26:00] grace of God will be enough for you
[1:26:03] sufficient for you he won't allow a
[1:26:07] trial that is
[1:26:09] above your faith it will be something
[1:26:13] that you will be able to
[1:26:16] master so it was not a hard thing job
[1:26:19] was able to do it and I believe we can
[1:26:22] can also do it yes amen
[1:26:26] amen
[1:26:28] now
[1:26:31] job one other thing about him he had
[1:26:33] children braim says in few messages in
[1:26:38] that message God's approach he says
[1:26:41] there were worldly
[1:26:44] children but job offered an extra
[1:26:48] sacrifice for them as a
[1:26:51] father just in case they've sinned
[1:26:53] against
[1:26:55] God and they were together drinking wine
[1:26:58] having a party they all
[1:27:18] died
