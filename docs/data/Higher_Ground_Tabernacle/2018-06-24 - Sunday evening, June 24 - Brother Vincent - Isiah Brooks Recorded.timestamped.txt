[21:12] let's open our Bibles to Matthews I'm
[21:16] going to read from three places Matthew
[21:17] 27 John 19 and first John chapter 5
[21:22] Matthew 27 that's one verse verse 15
[21:25] I'll be brief
[21:39] right so let's pray before we read away
[21:45] pleasure Heavenly Father want to thank
[21:49] you that indeed you have shown that
[21:52] you'll never be without a witness even
[21:56] in this city you have a remnant that I
[22:00] call by your name that are looking
[22:03] forward for your soon appearing that we
[22:06] shall become like you
[22:08] we want to thank you now the word is
[22:11] committed back into your hands you are
[22:13] the author of this word we pray O God
[22:16] that you come and take the highest seat
[22:19] this evening in our miss now be the
[22:22] guest of honor for this meeting and come
[22:26] a minister to our hearts take man of the
[22:29] out of the way and Lord have preeminence
[22:32] tonight this we ask even in a mighty
[22:36] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[22:38] amen Matthew 27 I'm reading verse 50
[22:45] fiftieth verse Jesus when he had cried
[22:52] again with a loud voice yielded up the
[22:55] ghost let's move to John 19:34
[23:03] just seen on the same subject
[23:14] John 19 was 34 I read a word of the Lord
[23:20] but one of the soldiers with a spear
[23:24] Pierce his side and forthwith came there
[23:28] out blood and war
[23:32] amen first John five mountains end of
[23:38] your Bible now
[23:48] John chapter 5 I read two verses verse 7
[23:50] and verse 8 for there are three that
[23:55] bear record in heaven the father the
[23:59] word and the Holy Ghost and these three
[24:02] are one and they are three that bear
[24:05] witness in it the spirit and the water
[24:08] and the blood and these three agree in
[24:11] one amen
[24:13] may the Lord at his blessings to the
[24:16] reading of his word amen
[24:18] let's be seated beloved so as I said I
[24:26] want to remain on this subject of the
[24:29] new birth but I want us to look at
[24:33] another side of it
[24:35] our prophet William Graham said there is
[24:38] an approach and there is a process for
[24:42] this new birth to take place in us and I
[24:45] want us to look at this approach and
[24:47] this process that our prophet spoke
[24:50] about remember our ultimate goal amen is
[24:54] to be like Jesus to be like Jesus to be
[25:03] like Jesus I long to be like he that's
[25:16] our ultimate goal we want to be like
[25:19] Jesus pregnant when we become like Jesus
[25:26] would you don't worry any more about
[25:28] this world we think Jesus was concerned
[25:32] about the riches of this world he knew
[25:35] he had greater riches don't worry about
[25:39] becoming a billionaire and becoming and
[25:41] buying a 100 million jet because he
[25:46] doesn't want to fly in a tube of demons
[25:48] oh my god hallelujah
[25:54] brilliant sometimes I don't know but God
[25:58] always shows to us in very little things
[26:01] that
[26:01] with us and the problem is us it's not
[26:04] him
[26:06] the problem is us I remember I think
[26:11] about a year and a half or two years ago
[26:12] I wanted to I think about a year and a
[26:15] half I wanted to buy a suit in jankis
[26:18] and when I went the price I like the
[26:23] suit it's also nice but the price was
[26:26] way beyond a poor student like me
[26:28] that's 425 bucks so I just forgot about
[26:33] it so anytime I go into Yonkers I look
[26:35] at it admite when I said no these are
[26:38] not the kind of things I want to spend
[26:39] my money on so you know Yonkers is
[26:43] closing so I went back there to see how
[26:46] my dad suit was going for and they had
[26:50] so I asked them they tell a teacher I
[26:53] mean yeah yeah to check how I make the
[26:55] price was into a $75 that's a jacket so
[27:01] I bought it
[27:02] but in the store didn't have the pant
[27:05] and I just bought it by faith that I'll
[27:09] get a pan to match it isn't it so
[27:12] anytime I see younger someway I try to
[27:14] enter to see what I could see the part
[27:16] that would match it and I was not
[27:18] finding one so last week when we last
[27:21] two weeks when we went to Iowa City in
[27:24] between service I just Google to find
[27:27] out that I was a young cast in town and
[27:29] there was so I went there when I went I
[27:32] saw a similar plant but the size was not
[27:35] my sight was way smaller than me I
[27:37] couldn't wait
[27:39] that's okay I'll try again one day when
[27:42] I get to do morning I'll go to the
[27:44] Jordan Creek Mall and tried I want to so
[27:47] in between service to be awaited but in
[27:51] one of the walls I went they had given
[27:53] me the code as a code for all the items
[27:55] at the behalf so they had given a cool
[27:57] that I could look online or I could give
[27:59] it to somebody in a store to look for me
[28:01] so I always had it in my pocket so when
[28:03] I went to John actually I gave out a
[28:04] code they look into their system and it
[28:06] told me that uh what we have is very
[28:08] small and even what they had they
[28:11] couldn't see it on Iraq's I wanted
[28:14] to leave then something told me that
[28:16] look why don't you go such a bit so I
[28:18] went to one of these racks that they
[28:21] don't even sell the kind of things that
[28:23] I wanted I was just looking through in
[28:25] case somebody has picked it and put it
[28:26] there so as I was looking through
[28:28] something drop on the ground and when I
[28:31] look at it yeah it was I said Lord could
[28:36] this be you I mean in very little things
[28:42] if we learn to appreciate God in very
[28:46] little things you do bigger things for
[28:50] us isn't it so beloved we've been
[28:56] talking about the new birth and the need
[29:00] for us to come in contact with a living
[29:03] witness amen an angel came to camellias
[29:09] that was true but the angel directed him
[29:13] to Peter the angel did not plant a seed
[29:18] in him the Angels message that he
[29:22] brought to him did not give him the
[29:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost it had to take
[29:27] Peter to come to his house for Peter to
[29:31] speak the word to him anybody be living
[29:34] that way the Peter spoke receive the
[29:37] blessing of God in the form of the Holy
[29:39] Ghost amen
[29:42] now I said in the morning that you can
[29:47] come across and living witness you can
[29:51] come across a career of viable seed but
[29:58] if the ground or witness is planted is
[30:00] not good that's it
[30:03] major minute but Cano grew the seed may
[30:08] not germinate at all and we know that
[30:11] from basic science it meant that if you
[30:14] go and put seed on a very poor soil
[30:16] it--my germinate all right bite can
[30:18] never bear fruits so just with our way
[30:21] that is why in agriculture we try to
[30:24] march soils and a kind of cross that can
[30:27] be grown on
[30:27] Sol's so beloved sees the fall in the
[30:35] Garden of Eden God has used every type
[30:40] Arana to show us that only a new birth
[30:44] can change our evil nature it meant as I
[30:51] said in the morning Christ came and
[30:54] diagnosed the problem
[30:57] he said hey Nicodemus the problem is
[31:00] your bed I mean it's not it's not in a
[31:03] Bible that way but that is a that is
[31:06] what he was trying to tell him say the
[31:08] problem is the way you were born right
[31:12] now it's not your fault
[31:13] the problem is the way we were born that
[31:16] is the perverted way because every
[31:19] original is God's poking way everywhere
[31:23] now his gospel he knew a God from the
[31:26] beginning God spoke everything into
[31:27] existence
[31:28] all right so it's not our fault that we
[31:32] were born that way but God has a
[31:35] provided way it is our fault problems is
[31:39] our fault when we refuse to take the
[31:42] provided way God has a way of escape for
[31:46] every for mankind let me put it that way
[31:49] so it is now your fault
[31:51] if you refuse the way of escape I gave
[31:55] this example before in this church when
[31:58] I preach some time ago that according to
[32:01] the history when Jesus was departing he
[32:05] told the disciples that it will not be
[32:09] long the abomination spooky of Daniel
[32:14] will be studying the holy place when
[32:17] they see it they should flee amen
[32:22] so the way of escape for the disciples
[32:26] in Jerusalem is to run away not to stand
[32:31] and fight or pray just run away it's all
[32:34] right so when titles in AD 70 or so
[32:40] they're about when he surrounded
[32:43] according to josephus history not a
[32:45] single Christian died because they
[32:48] heeded advice of their Lord they ran
[32:52] away by the priests they went and
[32:55] entered the temple and was calling on
[32:56] the god of Moses they're very good at
[32:58] crucified on the cross to come down and
[33:01] save them so brethren God always has
[33:06] what a provided way he has a way of
[33:10] escape so sister if we don't choose that
[33:15] way of escape and you choose your own
[33:16] way rather if you choose your own way
[33:19] then the fault is no Maurice as for the
[33:23] way you were born into this world there
[33:26] was nothing you could do about it you
[33:27] didn't choose it so God is not going to
[33:30] judge you for that but he's going to
[33:32] judge you for refusing he's provided way
[33:35] and as I said in the money he has one
[33:38] provided way he has one why did we
[33:43] so very since therefore what he has been
[33:47] trying to do is to restore us back to
[33:54] the original nature from which we have
[33:56] fallen ready if it took a bath for us to
[34:02] adopt this corrupt nature they must take
[34:05] a bath again to go back to that nature
[34:08] of God as iris hallelujah beloved
[34:18] all nature is testifying of this new
[34:21] basis all nature the sunday see bra bra
[34:24] was using the Sun to type in say look in
[34:26] the morning look at the Sun it's like a
[34:28] toddler struggling - best for by 11
[34:33] o'clock it's it's in its teenage years
[34:37] by midday strong man with all the power
[34:42] I mean I always tell people that I mean
[34:46] I don't know what's making this sound
[34:47] but if that's where we are getting our
[34:49] power from I mean that's put a little
[34:50] generator here to give you some
[34:52] electricity makes all the noise but look
[34:55] at the Sun the greatest generator we
[34:57] have so empty teens make noise when a
[34:59] Sun is so great its shine is like a cool
[35:03] across the whole entire globe we're not
[35:05] making any noise great teens empty
[35:09] vessels vessels make it a lot of noise
[35:11] you know great things don't make noise
[35:14] hallelujah hallelujah so sometime when I
[35:18] see preachers who are struggling to be
[35:20] seen to be known they are the deep ones
[35:23] I know that in fact they are empty
[35:26] because a good one will humble himself
[35:29] and just sit there when the time comes
[35:32] then what is in him will be made known
[35:34] is that is that it hallelujah so by two
[35:38] o'clock the Sun is becoming an old man
[35:41] stooped then it goes down by 6 o clock
[35:46] I mean of call here the Sun in the
[35:48] somehow good around 9 o'clock 9:00 p.m.
[35:50] but is that the end of the Sun it to
[35:54] rise up again the following morning it's
[35:56] showing the Beth hallelujah
[35:59] death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus
[36:02] Christ amen
[36:05] every day is showing that and all nature
[36:08] is showing that look the grain of corn
[36:12] for rich to reproduce is Safari to live
[36:15] again we know it has to fall into the
[36:17] soil it has to rot it has to die before
[36:21] our life comes out but even when our
[36:23] life comes out it doesn't look like the
[36:26] thing that went into the soil but
[36:28] eventually it becomes a thing that went
[36:30] into the soil is all right
[36:31] right so all nature is testifying of
[36:35] this bed and for me in the Old Testament
[36:40] Solomon said the conclusion of the
[36:42] matter in ecclesiastical center that
[36:44] what we said the conclusion of the
[36:45] matter is that for me the conclusion of
[36:48] the matter is to be born again and
[36:50] received a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[36:51] that is all what Christianity is about
[36:56] it's not about reciting some Creed and
[36:59] some special prayers offered for you and
[37:02] some incense band so that when you die
[37:05] your soul is in peg a trick I move from
[37:06] purgatory to I don't know where to wear
[37:09] it away it's not about that it's just
[37:14] about being born of God
[37:16] the nature of Christ be formed in you
[37:19] and you receiving the promise but ISM
[37:22] for service Alleluia
[37:25] even Bob ROM was using the death of a
[37:28] bill and the Beth of set to testify to
[37:33] show that it is a new best to show that
[37:37] it's only a new bed that can correct our
[37:40] evil nature hallelujah
[37:44] so the process of being born again
[37:47] starts with death easy no string that
[37:54] Beth Sharada start with death
[37:57] look problem again use this illustration
[38:02] preaching up preaching in beyond the
[38:04] catching of time he said when the baby
[38:06] is in the womb of death of the other
[38:08] mother now when the baby is born on
[38:12] earth here what has actually happened to
[38:14] the room where the baby was was that the
[38:17] baby has died to DA room but death there
[38:21] is not end of the baby has been born
[38:22] into a world here all right the same
[38:26] thing happens when we physically also
[38:28] die here on this earth when we die we
[38:31] are we are I mean the people here who
[38:33] know more see us but we have been born
[38:35] into another world you know that so the
[38:39] process of birth actually starts with
[38:42] death the only way
[38:45] physically even if you I believe I
[38:47] physically the only way you can be born
[38:49] into God's kingdom you can enter into
[38:51] that dimension it's where you have
[38:53] physically disappeared from this world
[38:55] when you are deck and go on that is a
[38:58] nothing when we go to bury you we have
[39:00] buried the flesh but your spirit your
[39:04] soul goes back to its big eyes all right
[39:07] good so the process of death death
[39:11] starts with death I remember when I went
[39:15] to Canada one of our ministers lost a
[39:17] brother very helpful brother to the
[39:20] church and I went there to preach and I
[39:22] took that title death is better I was
[39:26] using this to illustrate it look look at
[39:29] the Trish every every winter it died
[39:33] isn't it by the end of the trees by the
[39:36] following winter but you know that there
[39:39] are some trees that Dinah winter the
[39:40] neva resurrect in in the spring it shows
[39:43] you is that one is in nature is teaching
[39:45] us everything is telling you that there
[39:48] are some people who die and when they do
[39:51] I mean they can be part of the
[39:54] resurrection that we are going to be
[39:55] part of when they die they have died and
[39:58] do die again if I can put it out you
[40:01] know you and I saw what I'm talking
[40:03] about
[40:03] at the same time there are some trees
[40:05] that do not die in the winter they
[40:08] evergreen and that's also teaching you
[40:10] that there is an eternal life somewhere
[40:13] there is something that does not die
[40:16] hallelujah amen
[40:19] so all nature has been exemplifying that
[40:22] Santa must die for you to leave or
[40:26] something must die for another to leave
[40:28] now if you go to the world I don't know
[40:32] which in Africa we have lions we have
[40:34] leopards we have highness we have all
[40:37] these wild cats and dogs in the world
[40:39] for them to be able to leave a buffalo
[40:43] has died and antelope has to die
[40:46] something must die for them to leave is
[40:49] that right
[40:51] here you have your jug ways you have you
[40:54] have some mountain lions and all that
[40:56] they have to eat a bison the
[40:59] after each the deer they have to eat
[41:01] something for them to leave hallelujah
[41:05] so something major is always showing
[41:08] that that something has to die before
[41:10] something can leave
[41:12] even those who claim to be vegetarian by
[41:15] Brahma said you those who claim to be
[41:16] vegetarians do you know that the
[41:18] vegetables that you eat to is life that
[41:20] is dying for you for we human beings who
[41:24] live something we have to buy some the
[41:26] meat we buy from the shops is the fish
[41:29] that we buy it was life that has been
[41:30] killed for us who eat to give us life
[41:33] why is it so it is so because that is
[41:37] the law of God I am following the law of
[41:43] God is that something has to die for
[41:45] something to live so if we take tomatoes
[41:49] is life that seed in that tomato is life
[41:52] by you kill it
[41:54] put it in me put it in stew or make soup
[41:59] I brought with it and you are killing it
[42:01] once you go to that process it can live
[42:03] again but when you kill it you consume
[42:05] it then you you live is that right so
[42:10] brethren we for us to be born against
[42:17] something or for us yeah for us to be
[42:20] born again for us to receive that new
[42:22] bed something had to die for us and that
[42:26] is what the Lord Jesus Christ came
[42:29] indeed he had to die for and also that
[42:32] is the law you know the disciples
[42:35] probably didn't have all this
[42:36] understanding at the time that Jesus
[42:37] Christ was telling them that he was
[42:39] going to die and I mean all the parables
[42:42] and he was talking about and rise up
[42:45] again on the third day and peeta or
[42:47] rebuke him and say no you are not going
[42:49] to die because he said if I mean the
[42:55] grain of wheat if unless it enters into
[42:57] the soil it abideth alone if it does not
[43:01] get into the soil it can't reproduce
[43:05] hallelujah so for Christ to produce many
[43:09] Christ it has to fail
[43:12] died then when he died when he died then
[43:16] he came back into the disciple in an
[43:18] outpouring of the Holy Ghost
[43:20] then he reproduced himself in them that
[43:23] is the law of nature is alright okay so
[43:26] like this let's start now we've laid the
[43:32] foundation so I want to start by reading
[43:37] something that Barbara said in you must
[43:39] be born again in paragraph 68 he
[43:43] preached a sermon you must be born again
[43:45] and I like that same all the way he said
[43:49] you must be born again see he was
[43:51] talking to somebody the title see I like
[43:56] the way the Prophet pick his titles that
[43:58] title itself is a message on his own say
[44:03] you must be born again Amen hallelujah
[44:07] he said and look did you know it day
[44:11] something has to die so that you can
[44:13] leave now to use seventh-day Adventist
[44:18] that is in our miss many people say I
[44:20] wouldn't shoot a squirrel Rob Rahab I
[44:23] wouldn't kill a deer or a rabbit fish
[44:25] cause I don't believe that we should
[44:27] kill things my brother did you know that
[44:30] the vegetables and things that you eat
[44:32] is life also you have to kill it and the
[44:37] only way that you can exist in this life
[44:40] something has to die so you can live by
[44:43] is dead life now if something has to die
[44:49] so you can live by is motile life here
[44:51] on earth to live mortally did not
[44:54] something have to die so that by is life
[44:57] you could live eternally did not
[45:02] something have to die for us to have
[45:05] eternal life if mortally physically for
[45:07] our bodies that will soon their rotten
[45:12] and be buried in the dust and for these
[45:16] bodies to live some pepper some onion
[45:19] something has to die
[45:21] then for you to live eternally for you
[45:24] to have eternal life
[45:26] Tina has eternal life has to die for you
[45:30] did you get it
[45:31] Oh hallelujah just ask yourself that
[45:36] question and that one was Christ because
[45:39] no other one it has immortality the only
[45:44] one that has immortality is Jesus Christ
[45:47] hallelujah so the only one that can give
[45:51] you that immortality is Jesus Christ
[45:53] that is why he had to go to the grave
[45:56] that is why he had to lay down his life
[45:58] on the cross hallelujah
[46:01] the son only has immortality and he
[46:03] gives himself to you by just as setting
[46:06] him hallelujah so brethren we say that
[46:12] the process of being of this new bed
[46:16] amen oh the approach where and said I
[46:20] approach this new bed is first what
[46:23] dying first death variant unless we die
[46:31] Christ cannot be in us you see maybe I
[46:37] should have gone back to talk a little
[46:38] bit about able nature by struggle but
[46:40] listen when we were born something took
[46:46] over our souls the very day that we were
[46:50] born that nature of the serpent came
[46:54] into us that is why we can't live a
[46:58] godly life by ourselves there is no body
[47:02] the only person who has ever done that
[47:05] on earth is the Lord Jesus Christ
[47:09] you know Bella brown struggles how own
[47:13] him his own he would have done many
[47:15] things against them the Word of God at
[47:18] 8/7 the angel said don't drink don't
[47:22] smoke don't defy your body because when
[47:24] you are older we are going to be useless
[47:26] I mean there's a way for you to do
[47:29] hallelujah but even without warning as
[47:33] he grew up into his teenage years on his
[47:36] own you would have done it his first
[47:39] girlfriend I went out with and a girl
[47:40] was smoking you remember I can't say you
[47:44] you don't smoke you don't smoke
[47:45] you don't do anything so how do you
[47:47] entertain yourself robber I want to
[47:50] prove that he's a man pick the secret
[47:53] and wanted to like it but I knew the
[47:55] angel of the Lord one do not allow that
[47:57] because his body was going to house
[47:59] Christ his body was the temple that God
[48:03] was going to use for this end time so
[48:06] God didn't want that him put defiled so
[48:08] God Himself will come down and that
[48:10] sound and that's how he I mean even the
[48:15] fathers whoever I was working for the
[48:17] whiskey man Rob ROM fetching water I
[48:20] said but my son doesn't drink is a
[48:22] fallacy where I've got a as a son
[48:24] I wanted to prove that he was not a
[48:26] you know that was like some an
[48:30] insulting language to be describing that
[48:32] you are like a woman today it's pride
[48:36] for men to be totally a woman they even
[48:39] like it we have accepted it
[48:44] can we watch hallelujah so beloved as I
[48:51] said only one person ever leave that
[48:54] sort of life where he was born and by
[48:58] his nature he never desired foreseen and
[49:01] I was Allah Jesus Christ the reason why
[49:04] he could live that way is because he was
[49:07] not born through sex that's the only
[49:14] reason why he could live that way if he
[49:16] had also been born like any of us
[49:19] he couldn't have stopped it but see
[49:23] LeBron put it this way said we skipped
[49:25] out you funny so we cannot see back into
[49:29] eternity and see the glory we have with
[49:31] a lot from the beginning we skip it to
[49:33] come to this world to be tempted but
[49:36] Jesus Christ in his skin is so funny he
[49:38] could look back he knew the glory he had
[49:41] with a father from the beginning so this
[49:44] well it affects didn't matter limine but
[49:48] we have to skip it so that we can be
[49:50] tempted
[49:51] because our mind is darkened to our past
[49:55] glory with the Lord remember when God
[50:01] was talking to job and God said job
[50:05] where were you when the sons of God
[50:08] shouted for joy you remember that yeah
[50:12] we had we see we we had glory with him
[50:17] you know but we had to come to this
[50:19] world to pass through this because if no
[50:24] God would not be God
[50:25] rom made us to know that God has
[50:27] attributes in him because if there's
[50:31] nothing laws to be saved he can't be
[50:33] known as a savior amen if there's
[50:38] nothing to be redeemed how will he be
[50:39] known as a redeemer how he be known as a
[50:42] he life there's no sickness for him to
[50:44] heal amen
[50:47] so so to be born again we must go
[50:51] through this process of death amen the
[50:56] same as ever
[50:57] sister Sarah Berggren say yes to be born
[50:59] again you must go through a process of
[51:03] death he said everything does you take a
[51:07] grain of corn if that corn ever
[51:09] expressed to live again it's got to die
[51:13] fast hallelujah so my sister my brother
[51:18] if we want to live again we must die
[51:22] Fest will soon talk about how that
[51:23] deafies if a grain of wheat Allah
[51:26] expects will live again it's totally
[51:29] impossible for that corn laugh with that
[51:31] flower that tree that grass that
[51:34] vegetable everything that express to
[51:35] live again must die fests now how are
[51:41] you going to escape it
[51:42] you got to divest you got to die then
[51:46] the question died how when we say you
[51:49] have to die die ha to yourself die to
[51:53] everything so that you can be born again
[51:56] you've got to do that if you don't die
[51:59] you can never live again and look did
[52:04] you know that
[52:05] day let me pick it from from 64
[52:09] he said now they approach to this bed he
[52:14] said there is an approach to it and they
[52:18] approach this bed you have to go through
[52:21] a process just like anything that leaves
[52:23] I'm just emphasizing this for you to see
[52:25] anything that lives again has to divest
[52:29] and you cannot keep your same spirit
[52:33] sister brother you can't keep your
[52:36] arrogant spirit and say you are born
[52:38] again a spirit I reject everything that
[52:43] the Word of God says whenever of God
[52:45] says don't do this you go ahead and do
[52:47] it and you say you are born again you
[52:50] can see all those things I mean I'm here
[52:52] of all those is in a radio on the
[52:54] televisions and all those things are
[52:56] there everybody claims to be born again
[52:58] but you look at the person standing even
[53:00] the way he has dressed shows that he's
[53:02] against God's Way the way she has read
[53:05] shows that she's against God's Word and
[53:06] yes he says is born again hi Dean has
[53:11] served behind layers of makeup a sieve
[53:14] to cheat mother nature simply don't grow
[53:17] old again and yet they claim that they
[53:19] are born again that's cannot be born you
[53:21] can't keep that old spirit and say you
[53:25] are born again the spirit has to die
[53:29] you can't keep down all desire and say
[53:32] you are born again that old desire has
[53:34] to die well a sister you can't keep your
[53:38] own thinking that's a problem everybody
[53:43] want to reason out the message everybody
[53:46] wants to reason out the Bible you can't
[53:49] keep your own reasoning and be born
[53:52] again you have to die to your reasoning
[53:54] if you reason it that is even a making
[53:59] hallelujah so you say and you cannot
[54:03] keep your self you cannot keep your same
[54:06] habit our filthy habits have to die
[54:12] hey those hobbies don't die we can't be
[54:15] born again
[54:17] it has to die amen you've got to die on
[54:22] his altar like a bell did with his lamp
[54:25] you've got you've got to die with your
[54:27] lung you've got to die die to your own
[54:30] thinking I like this one
[54:31] he said die to your own thinking and
[54:34] that is everybody is having his own
[54:36] interpretation of the one message that
[54:38] came to us problem said don't interpret
[54:41] it so if you interpret it you go far
[54:44] away from the beaten path but I like
[54:48] typology I like taking things from the
[54:52] Old Testament and type in it because the
[54:54] Old Testament is a type of the new and
[54:56] the old and the New Testament is a type
[54:59] of today but I want to stay where the
[55:01] Provost eat I don't want to venture into
[55:05] picking an 18 and making some type
[55:07] typology for people to see how deep I am
[55:10] in the word when the prophet has not
[55:11] touched - then I'm interpreting the word
[55:15] I am NOT a revealer of the way the
[55:18] revealer of the word came to us in the
[55:21] person of William my own Brown because
[55:24] the word of God comes to a prophet it
[55:27] doesn't come to the faithful ministry
[55:29] comes to a dispensation now prophet so
[55:35] just till when a prophecy
[55:37] hallelujah amen
[55:40] so brethren we have to die to our own
[55:43] thinking to be born to his thinking oh I
[55:50] like that one
[55:51] let the mind I was in Christ be in you
[55:56] you've got to think his thoughts and now
[55:59] brother sister let me say this as
[56:01] intelligent as I know how to see how can
[56:04] you think his thoughts and deny his
[56:06] waking amen how and yet claim you are
[56:13] born again just ask yourself that
[56:15] question how can you do it you can't if
[56:19] you are you are born again you've got
[56:21] his thoughts if the mind of Christ is in
[56:24] you there you are a new creature so this
[56:28] is what I'm try
[56:31] to see that the mind of Christ to
[56:35] perform in a believer means that that
[56:37] believer has to die to his own thinking
[56:43] don't question it
[56:45] if broblem said that if that TV set was
[56:48] in my room I'll pick my shotgun and
[56:51] shoot it don't question it
[56:52] oh we are in a modern world how can I
[56:54] live without a television it's as plain
[56:59] as plain can be if God came down into
[57:04] low profit I don't own one we say oh by
[57:08] now you have all these you have internet
[57:11] and if you have even this you can have a
[57:13] TV on your you don't control what comes
[57:16] on the TV do you but if you have
[57:18] internet you contribute can't control
[57:20] what you want to see on the internet but
[57:21] on the TV you don't control all this put
[57:23] on the TV so that's the way the
[57:26] prophecies so die to your reasoning die
[57:30] - you're thinking don't reason it no
[57:33] reason it hallelujah he said as I know
[57:40] how to say how I've said the Bible
[57:44] teaches that if any brother would like
[57:46] to well you find that creature look that
[57:49] word creature in the lexicon and you
[57:51] find out that the word creature there is
[57:53] interpreted or translated as new
[57:55] creation because you are a one creation
[57:59] a human being born in sexual desire here
[58:03] on earth and now you a new creation born
[58:06] by spirit your own thoughts are dead
[58:11] they are so dead until they are crystal
[58:14] either brass serpent you see let me let
[58:20] me say this when Barbra ham was
[58:23] preaching on the seals when he got to
[58:27] the fifth seal the source under the
[58:30] altar rom said there may be many among
[58:35] you who may think about this thing
[58:36] differently from from me of differently
[58:39] from the way I'm about to say it but I
[58:42] also
[58:42] thought differently to see Barbara was
[58:49] always very careful to point to as the
[58:52] human part of him
[58:55] so that we don't dfi him the human part
[59:00] of him I talk about it differently when
[59:03] he was where he was preaching when he
[59:05] was going to preach on the first seal he
[59:07] said he went and took all the old
[59:10] teachings of that meat and all these Oh
[59:13] horse Kofi's said hurt the talents I
[59:16] said and all he gathered them together I
[59:18] had prepared
[59:19] we've got previously I'll be saying that
[59:22] a white horse rider was a spirit of God
[59:25] or the Holy Spirit that went out in the
[59:27] face a to conquer then at midday the
[59:33] pillar fire came into the room my bra
[59:37] was careful to tell us that so when a
[59:41] pillar of fire comes to correct him on
[59:42] that he can still know to his own
[59:45] thinking his thinking's have thinking
[59:47] has to die for the last thinking to take
[59:51] over and this one this what I'm trying
[59:54] to say that we have to die to our own
[59:57] thinking when a prophet comes and said
[1:00:00] that say the Lord don't under I was
[1:00:05] looking on the Google Earth on my iPad
[1:00:08] and I was looking at Los Angeles and I
[1:00:12] was looking at the Salton Sea then I
[1:00:15] measured it 200 kilometers he's the
[1:00:21] Prophet said that Los Angeles will be
[1:00:23] believed the Salton Sea and I'll ask but
[1:00:26] Los Angeles was so close his oak is on
[1:00:28] the Pacific Coast so it would have made
[1:00:32] more sense for it to be sinking into the
[1:00:34] Pacific Coast is indeed by the prophet
[1:00:36] of God said the Salton Sea and I just
[1:00:39] take it as the Salton Sea I'm not going
[1:00:41] to reason it there right why there are
[1:00:44] things that in iodine the message which
[1:00:47] are not doctrina maybe slip of tongue
[1:00:49] the provide want to say 5000 and 7000 or
[1:00:53] something like that those are those
[1:00:54] that's what I'm talking about
[1:00:55] but
[1:00:56] thinking about things that have come
[1:00:57] does sear the Lord things that have come
[1:01:00] as doctrina teaches you don't pick it
[1:01:03] and reason it out you know you know the
[1:01:10] prophet of God spoke against mixed
[1:01:12] marriages you know that but it is very
[1:01:17] easy for somebody who I mean all these
[1:01:20] anti racism movements I don't have
[1:01:22] anything against them all these anti
[1:01:24] racism movement is very easy for them
[1:01:26] zero that's wrong he's to see that and
[1:01:28] say he's a racist you know that you'll
[1:01:31] see that I say the prophet of God is a
[1:01:32] racist why is he seeing a black I know
[1:01:34] Mary white why is he saying that but I
[1:01:37] would take the profit at his weight I
[1:01:39] don't care how logic or reason he sees
[1:01:42] that's what we are supposed to do if
[1:01:46] somebody doesn't know it and that's it
[1:01:47] that's different I'm talking about those
[1:01:49] who know it
[1:01:50] I'll take him at his word because I know
[1:01:53] those who do not know it and even do it
[1:01:55] there's a pattern for them in a message
[1:01:57] marriage and divorce so brethren there
[1:02:02] are many things that I in the message
[1:02:04] that are in the word that would be
[1:02:06] contrary to our thinking that are
[1:02:11] completely contrary to our thinking but
[1:02:14] if it is the Word of God and you are
[1:02:16] born again you can't denied you receive
[1:02:21] it and I will receive every bit of it if
[1:02:25] I don't know it and I do it ignorant I
[1:02:28] know God will forgive me
[1:02:30] even but I don't know the word and not
[1:02:33] against it and say I'm born again
[1:02:36] hallelujah so Gregory listen clues for
[1:02:45] Allah to live and reign forever he
[1:02:49] himself has to die now if the bridegroom
[1:02:53] had to go through that the process of
[1:02:55] death for him to reign forever eternally
[1:02:59] then shooting the
[1:03:01] right also go through that now talking
[1:03:05] about the church now another individual
[1:03:07] talking about a church even if you look
[1:03:09] at a church the church also had to go
[1:03:11] through death and resurrection you know
[1:03:16] the bride that was Beth at Pentacles
[1:03:20] she died at service or our pajamas or by
[1:03:24] pegye Macias hybridize and by the Dark
[1:03:27] Ages that Sedition age she was dead then
[1:03:31] she rose again in ty Tyria Philadelphia
[1:03:37] Bob rancid I was a stock is that right
[1:03:39] Letitia was what the shock and now the
[1:03:45] bride is on earth now being prepared by
[1:03:49] the Word of God for his soon coming
[1:03:52] there right so just as the groom had to
[1:03:56] go through that process of death to live
[1:03:59] forever the bride also has to go through
[1:04:02] that process of death to live again
[1:04:06] girls order does not change so the
[1:04:12] church goes through that the same way
[1:04:14] the individual bride also has to go
[1:04:16] through that very unless we die to our
[1:04:21] thinking unless we die to our reasoning
[1:04:23] Christ cannot be forming us even and if
[1:04:28] Christ is formed in us hallelujah we
[1:04:31] will leave him out you can hide it you
[1:04:36] will leave him out it will be seen of
[1:04:37] men I don't know why right was this man
[1:04:43] who said o TL Osman who said we preach
[1:04:47] Christ but Brahm lived Christ yeah he
[1:04:53] was seen that he lived Christ he didn't
[1:04:57] just talk about it or he talked about he
[1:04:59] lived it ma
[1:05:04] oh what a sweet word we are following
[1:05:09] Amen so brethren we have to die that's
[1:05:16] the first approach now let me give you
[1:05:21] something else from the message
[1:05:22] leadership he said the first kind of
[1:05:28] which the bridegroom how to fall into
[1:05:32] the F in order to rise again the right
[1:05:34] so did the first bride that was born at
[1:05:38] Pentacles had to good to the duck it is
[1:05:40] like any other seat the barrack they had
[1:05:43] to die they must do it but it started
[1:05:47] sprouting again all right so that's what
[1:05:51] I was trying to talk about when you when
[1:05:53] you see into the wheat when it comes for
[1:05:55] the corn of wheat a man's does raise
[1:05:58] quit you go out and see that with form
[1:06:02] in there it looks just exactly like the
[1:06:05] grain if you take a tweezer and set down
[1:06:09] and take that wheat and open it up there
[1:06:11] is no grain there at all see it sounds
[1:06:16] like cone maybe we are no use which in
[1:06:18] area where I used to count you see that
[1:06:20] Cobb has come loose but go cut it the
[1:06:26] corn is not from yet is that right
[1:06:28] only the shock has come and that is what
[1:06:30] deceived the people when the Sousa
[1:06:34] Street revival came they thought that
[1:06:37] that was the promised outpouring of the
[1:06:39] Holy Ghost and let me say this let me
[1:06:42] drop this many endtime churches are
[1:06:45] still living under the Azusa Street and
[1:06:48] nineteen and thinking that that is the
[1:06:50] promise egg time holy goes for Russia
[1:06:55] there is a difference God did send the
[1:07:00] Pentecostal revival our eyesight was the
[1:07:02] work of God it was God's Way of
[1:07:05] preparing the people to receive His
[1:07:08] Messenger you see barometer how could
[1:07:11] that have been the promised outpouring
[1:07:13] when the teaching rain has not yet come
[1:07:18] when the people have not been taught to
[1:07:20] align themselves properly when they had
[1:07:23] women preachers all over when they were
[1:07:26] baptized him baptizing people in the
[1:07:28] titles of Father Son Holy Ghost when
[1:07:31] they were they were taking the loss of
[1:07:33] ours I don't know how to call it a lost
[1:07:36] breakfast how could I have been the
[1:07:40] outpouring of the Holy Ghost that wasn't
[1:07:42] but they confuse themselves they totally
[1:07:45] already had it so when problem came and
[1:07:48] was telling them that one by Brahms say
[1:07:49] look we hardly have faith enough for
[1:07:52] even to cure haddock how can we have him
[1:07:55] fit for rupture they totally got it to a
[1:08:02] self-deception hallelujah to a
[1:08:06] self-deception
[1:08:07] so bearing the seed that went into the
[1:08:09] ground comes back again amen
[1:08:14] when Christ died on the cross now to my
[1:08:18] scriptures so that went down when Christ
[1:08:20] died on a cross from how we read
[1:08:26] treaties came out of him in Matthew 27
[1:08:30] verse 15 it talks about the blood and
[1:08:32] the water in John 19 it talks about the
[1:08:38] spirit amen
[1:08:43] then in 1st John the treaties were put
[1:08:46] together day that they are three that
[1:08:49] testify in heaven and there are three
[1:08:51] that testify on earth they treat our
[1:08:53] testified in heaven I want the three
[1:08:55] that testify on F agree in one the water
[1:09:00] the blood and the spirit now listen this
[1:09:07] is what I want to bring across now
[1:09:10] remember that the first bride that was
[1:09:12] ever given to the man in the Garden of
[1:09:14] Eden was taking from his side the right
[1:09:17] so God made Adam to fall into a deep
[1:09:21] sleep and gore performed the most
[1:09:24] complicated surgery that was ever
[1:09:26] performed he took the woman out of his
[1:09:30] and there is he did that was so that the
[1:09:33] woman could be like the man that is why
[1:09:36] when Adam saw the woman and I've said
[1:09:38] this is bone of my bone
[1:09:40] this is flesh of my flesh and we know
[1:09:44] that onto the for eve was almost it was
[1:09:48] co-equal with Adam there was nothing
[1:09:52] like this is what man can do this
[1:09:55] man should do this all human she do they
[1:09:56] were co-equal I normally say that it was
[1:10:01] like a type of what they thought Lucifer
[1:10:04] was with God in the heavenlies labrum
[1:10:07] say he was co-equal with God it was only
[1:10:10] in creation God was had otherwise was
[1:10:15] co-equal God that's how God elevated him
[1:10:18] but a time kid I wanted to be elevated
[1:10:21] even higher than God didn't Barham say
[1:10:24] say to us that the seven things that
[1:10:28] must happen before the end of the world
[1:10:29] I think they enlisted him a change is I
[1:10:31] think the fourth thing was about woman
[1:10:34] isn't it he said they were giving barb
[1:10:39] Ram said and I was inventing that it
[1:10:41] read I said that can ii can imagine that
[1:10:44] when women did not have all the power
[1:10:45] that they have to be he said they were
[1:10:47] giving more than equal rights more than
[1:10:52] it not equal right you more than that
[1:10:54] it's not fighting for equal right and
[1:10:56] they have more than equal rights any man
[1:10:59] who has gone through a divorce who tell
[1:11:01] you that they will take everything are
[1:11:03] you away from you and give to them
[1:11:04] si it always happens I don't know why
[1:11:08] even when it is clear that you you won't
[1:11:11] do things by yourself they take it away
[1:11:13] and give it to then they have more than
[1:11:14] equal right
[1:11:15] so many of them now that's all they want
[1:11:18] marry a rich man after ye have one of my
[1:11:22] friends married and within less than a
[1:11:26] month they got divorced I said also
[1:11:28] marriages this the married and within a
[1:11:32] month they got divorced there are people
[1:11:36] who marry within a week
[1:11:40] they get divorced hoping Brown had lived
[1:11:43] under these conditions
[1:11:46] look was he passed I was then look at
[1:11:48] the Oh peaches the woman were dressing
[1:11:50] very decent from what I see there was
[1:11:54] dissin seen everything everywhere but
[1:11:57] here Brian was crying about the amour
[1:11:59] addressing see he was a prophet you
[1:12:04] could see what was how it was coming on
[1:12:07] and that's what he saw in me because he
[1:12:09] saw it in a vision he said the last
[1:12:11] picture he saw was just a little thick
[1:12:13] April that was covering only their
[1:12:15] private parts
[1:12:18] today's Oliver look if this world should
[1:12:20] continue for the next fifty two hundred
[1:12:22] years women are going to walk naked on
[1:12:25] the street and a lawyer is not going to
[1:12:26] do anything about it they can wear all
[1:12:30] those there are things that away in the
[1:12:31] summer the ones that run through here
[1:12:33] they can wait and go anywhere nobody
[1:12:35] everybody thinks it's normal but I'm
[1:12:37] sure if that man dresses that way they
[1:12:39] will say that is he the man is mental
[1:12:41] when the woman dresses that way it's
[1:12:44] normal and I'm gonna invest the campus
[1:12:47] and it's West day and the professor's
[1:12:50] can say anything about because you say
[1:12:52] they'll say you are intolerant it's
[1:12:55] crazy
[1:12:56] everything has gone completely confusing
[1:13:02] so brethren when Adam saw Eve he said
[1:13:06] this is born of my Buddhist is flesh of
[1:13:08] my flesh for she was taken out of a man
[1:13:11] hallelujah so very the same way Christ
[1:13:16] in looking for a bride for himself that
[1:13:20] bride has to be taken from his side and
[1:13:24] that is why he was pierced on covering
[1:13:27] for the blood the water and the spirit
[1:13:30] to come out amen and Ramon said these
[1:13:33] three things that came up from him are
[1:13:35] the three elements that make that can
[1:13:39] make a bride for him the water the blood
[1:13:45] and the spirit these are the three
[1:13:48] things the three element
[1:13:50] that will produce a bride for Jesus
[1:13:53] Christ and when those treaties truly
[1:13:57] produce a bride for Jesus Christ that
[1:13:59] bride would be exactly like him Peres in
[1:14:06] Revelation the Bible says that the woman
[1:14:10] has made herself ready so I don't care
[1:14:13] what anybody says what is important the
[1:14:16] one of those is that she has made
[1:14:18] herself ready it means there will be a
[1:14:20] bride for Jesus Christ the whole world
[1:14:23] can decide to go mad like they are going
[1:14:25] now our politics can decide to be in
[1:14:28] total confusion like it is now I don't
[1:14:32] care about that
[1:14:33] what I know is that there will be a
[1:14:35] bride for Jesus Christ that cannot reach
[1:14:40] Jesus Christ will have his bride in can
[1:14:43] never change and he said he's coming for
[1:14:47] a bride without spot or wrinkle so if
[1:14:53] you if you say you are a member of the
[1:14:56] bride I have to check your life you
[1:15:02] think what is coming to come for you in
[1:15:04] your spotted and wrinkle state he
[1:15:08] doesn't want any bride with sports and
[1:15:11] with wrinkle when rom went to glory what
[1:15:18] was the age of those people that I saw
[1:15:19] they said they were between 18 and 21
[1:15:21] he's all right I don't want a bride with
[1:15:26] spot or wrinkle but look at the people
[1:15:30] call himself recess today and all of
[1:15:34] them have hope to be going errata they
[1:15:37] say it's from the Hat I don't know
[1:15:38] whether they said I hear to him in my
[1:15:40] country they say it's from the heart
[1:15:41] it doesn't care it doesn't matter what
[1:15:44] you wear it doesn't matter how your
[1:15:46] outward looks like wow how are you going
[1:15:51] to know a tree is it nobody fruits it's
[1:15:55] by the fruit I know every tree where a
[1:15:58] sister I don't walk around with an x-ray
[1:16:01] machine to exer your heart to see what
[1:16:03] is in your heart
[1:16:04] I can only know what is in your heart by
[1:16:07] the fruits you are bearing by your
[1:16:09] outward appearance that's the only way I
[1:16:11] can know what's in your heart
[1:16:12] yeah when people tell me lies in the
[1:16:15] heart I say hey I don't carry an MRI or
[1:16:18] a CT scan in my hand just to scan your
[1:16:22] heart to know what is inside the only
[1:16:25] way I know what is inside our heart is
[1:16:26] what you look like
[1:16:28] if you paint yourself like a caricature
[1:16:34] with all these tattoos that are coming
[1:16:36] up now almost every what did you see in
[1:16:39] Tana has stuck to the body what is that
[1:16:42] what is that - we shouldn't go into
[1:16:47] things like that look at the spirit all
[1:16:54] the time
[1:16:56] thank God I'm black if a tattoo he doesn
[1:16:59] t need to be seen I I don't know I I
[1:17:04] don't know where this is coming from
[1:17:07] every decent person you see now V people
[1:17:10] you know expect them they all have
[1:17:11] something written on their bodies
[1:17:16] piercing every part of the body spirit
[1:17:22] is this that's why Brahma you see
[1:17:25] Abraham is a black monster Brad Bram
[1:17:28] that problem if God doesn't punish this
[1:17:31] generation and look a legend recently
[1:17:33] we're talking about to the generation of
[1:17:36] the 50s and the 40's will look back and
[1:17:40] said I was a decent generation as
[1:17:42] compared to the one in which we were
[1:17:43] living me that's why I told you in the
[1:17:45] morning every generation gets further
[1:17:47] away from the truth look at a generation
[1:17:53] and they were in and yet they said if
[1:17:56] God didn't punish that generation cobra
[1:17:59] to apologize to Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:18:02] but I know that there's a remnant of God
[1:18:04] people on earth God is only waiting for
[1:18:08] us to call get into the act for him to
[1:18:10] shut the door then he can bring the ring
[1:18:12] because I mean this filthiness cannot
[1:18:15] continue I don't know how long this
[1:18:17] thing is going to continue
[1:18:19] people are not satisfied anything that
[1:18:21] God has given them they change
[1:18:26] everything or has given all the natural
[1:18:29] is chained to their natura and it is in
[1:18:32] their own natural that they feel
[1:18:33] satisfied god have mercy God have mercy
[1:18:41] all these athletes all these post people
[1:18:46] they paint their body there were wild
[1:18:49] haircuts hair do's men with earrings
[1:18:54] nose rings mouth rings I don't know we
[1:18:59] part of the body they don't PS anymore
[1:19:01] if they had their own with it appears
[1:19:03] the Hat and put a ring on a hat oh my
[1:19:07] god so brethren Abraham said the
[1:19:11] elements that we need for a new bed
[1:19:15] amen was given to us on covering when
[1:19:21] Jesus shed the blood that wara and let
[1:19:27] out the ghost
[1:19:29] these are the three things that has to
[1:19:33] prepare a bride for him amen and let me
[1:19:38] read you how Rob Ron put it as I went
[1:19:40] down
[1:19:56] in the message beth pain i think so okay
[1:20:05] let me take is this a science I know and
[1:20:07] said before I take birth pain
[1:20:17] alright paragraph 48 birthday and
[1:20:20] everything down first look when a woman
[1:20:24] or entity in travail for base the first
[1:20:27] thing that comes to pass the breaking of
[1:20:31] water and Norma Beth second team is the
[1:20:36] blood and then comes life it's all right
[1:20:40] what up blood spirit call life is a
[1:20:44] spirit all right I mean this is just
[1:20:47] housing just a kiss which which is
[1:20:51] holding the soul is alright in the
[1:20:52] spirit and that constitutes the normal
[1:20:57] natural death and so is it in the
[1:21:01] spiritual realm its water that's
[1:21:06] justification by faith believing on God
[1:21:11] and receiving him as your personal
[1:21:13] Savior and being baptized as a warrior
[1:21:20] believing on God receiving him as your
[1:21:23] personal Savior and being baptized
[1:21:24] that's the water second is scientific
[1:21:28] Asian of the Spirit that God cleanses
[1:21:31] the spirit from all elements of the
[1:21:33] world that's what many believers are
[1:21:36] struggling with even from all from our
[1:21:41] elements of the world and the desire of
[1:21:44] the world and then the Holy Spirit comes
[1:21:48] in and gives new birth and fills up that
[1:21:51] sanctified vessel hallelujah
[1:21:56] so the material the reason why Christ
[1:22:00] had to go to the cross is to allow the
[1:22:04] surgery that was performed on Adams side
[1:22:09] from the beginning to give Adam a bride
[1:22:12] to be performed again to give Christ the
[1:22:18] second Adam a break and just as the
[1:22:22] first bride fell the second the first
[1:22:25] bride fell the second bride to who for
[1:22:28] but this
[1:22:29] time she will resurrect hallelujah and
[1:22:33] claim her place as the bride of Jesus
[1:22:38] Christ amen
[1:22:42] so very fast death we have to die to our
[1:22:47] own thinking then go through the process
[1:22:50] of justification sanctification and
[1:22:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost then we are in
[1:23:00] his program now he can use us now we can
[1:23:03] leave their life where everybody who see
[1:23:07] us is he it's not something that you
[1:23:10] struggle to do is something that is has
[1:23:12] become your nature let me say this one
[1:23:20] brother who I'm told that since he was
[1:23:25] born he always wears shots he has never
[1:23:27] ever worn pants before and he was a
[1:23:33] heavy drinker so he has his gang he
[1:23:38] moves with his gang so he became a
[1:23:42] somebody brought him to church in one of
[1:23:44] my autistic he's in Ghana when he had a
[1:23:47] message said new this thing is different
[1:23:49] from all the churches I've been to this
[1:23:52] must be the truth so instantly
[1:23:57] everything every day when he comes to
[1:23:59] church and here's a message what about
[1:24:01] the message preaches against his closet
[1:24:07] so one day he traveled back to his home
[1:24:11] village immediately he learned that
[1:24:14] everybody knows that hey the guys can
[1:24:16] only have to go to the bar to drink and
[1:24:18] he went to him they realized I know it's
[1:24:20] not a guy we know because for the first
[1:24:22] time he came and he was in paint he was
[1:24:23] not in shots and they were also they all
[1:24:29] said no if this is true then we have to
[1:24:31] come to the church that you have gone to
[1:24:33] I know what happened within that
[1:24:39] shot up like three months that a brother
[1:24:41] came to believe immediately here is he
[1:24:44] received his baptism God took him away
[1:24:49] we go God knows that if he stays here
[1:24:51] longer the devil could take him back
[1:24:53] just go just took him
[1:25:10] when a bride has been born we know that
[1:25:16] Brown said that that happened when the
[1:25:20] file was the five stars also cross their
[1:25:22] paths said the bride has been born a
[1:25:28] bride in his infancy has been born
[1:25:36] god-like in the days of joke is looking
[1:25:39] down and asked him you and I because we
[1:25:45] didn't come to become the bride of this
[1:25:47] end-time by accident
[1:25:49] remember when Abraham said if you had
[1:25:52] opportunity to look down true glory and
[1:25:55] if God asks him in which age who does he
[1:25:59] want to come and be a preacher in on
[1:26:00] this earth you would have chosen this
[1:26:02] very last one and I believe that God put
[1:26:07] us here for that same purpose
[1:26:11] maybe Paul and Co could he have survived
[1:26:13] in this last age he knew that you and I
[1:26:16] can survive it that's why he put us here
[1:26:19] and we dare not disappointing beloved we
[1:26:25] have to die to our thinking we have to
[1:26:28] die to our reasoning we shouldn't we
[1:26:32] should start reasoning the Word of God
[1:26:35] we just have to accept it remember the
[1:26:40] process begins with death if we don't
[1:26:44] die to ourselves Christ can never live
[1:26:47] in us as the scripture said we can't
[1:26:51] serve two masters we can't we can be
[1:26:56] seven maman and serving God you can
[1:27:01] serve the world and save cracks it's not
[1:27:04] possible this holy service you become a
[1:27:07] hypocrite but
[1:27:15] there is a consolation as many as will
[1:27:20] as many as desire God is ready to make a
[1:27:25] way for you it's only you as I told you
[1:27:29] in the beginning about my testimonies
[1:27:30] only we that are limiting God in very
[1:27:33] little things God proves that his day
[1:27:36] it's true sometimes he allows you to go
[1:27:38] through the difficulty for you to to
[1:27:40] fight it out LeBron said if God were to
[1:27:46] push us through a tube and pull us on
[1:27:48] the other side then he cannot say that
[1:27:51] we should overcome so because mejor have
[1:27:54] you become you have to fight it out and
[1:27:57] I appeared honest I don't like you then
[1:28:00] you are triumphant then you are no
[1:28:02] vakama then you are qualified to sit
[1:28:05] with him on his truth because he also
[1:28:08] had to face it it's not it was an easy
[1:28:12] thing for Jesus to go to the cross
[1:28:13] brother because Jesus was fully a human
[1:28:17] being he was fully God the human part of
[1:28:22] him fought it that's why I said father
[1:28:26] if it were possible let this cup pass
[1:28:28] over me in Germany he preached his sweat
[1:28:31] became like glad you think if it was
[1:28:35] easy who have done that for all these
[1:28:37] people to be spitting on him and
[1:28:39] piercing him and punishing him amanda
[1:28:42] was born with our sin that cannot be to
[1:28:46] whom sim can never be imputed i had to
[1:28:49] go through that so that christ will be
[1:28:53] formed in us even doing because of
[1:28:55] himself really because of you and I it's
[1:28:59] up to us do we want this better do you
[1:29:06] want him in us we want him to detect our
[1:29:10] life I want to live in the way we think
[1:29:12] is right
[1:29:19] LeBron was so much surrender to the
[1:29:22] Spirit of God that many a time the
[1:29:26] spirit will let him to do things that
[1:29:28] are against his own reasoning you know
[1:29:34] when the when the blizzard was focused
[1:29:36] in Colorado and he was walking down the
[1:29:38] hill and the spirit said go back it'll
[1:29:44] make sense
[1:29:45] I'm not saying gold listen to me you and
[1:29:48] I we are no profits so don't go
[1:29:50] listening to any spirit to speak to you
[1:29:51] just listen to the way so and even if
[1:29:55] something speaks to you compared to the
[1:29:56] way do you know how around it when he
[1:29:59] had a voice he said he closed his mouth
[1:30:01] put his tongue in between his teeth to
[1:30:04] be sure that were I he's not speaking to
[1:30:06] himself
[1:30:06] oh that's I said as the same voice that
[1:30:09] spoke to him since he was a child
[1:30:11] the voice has never filled so even the
[1:30:15] Prophet had checks and balances to be
[1:30:18] sure that our Scott but in this believer
[1:30:23] if he sees a light flash across the room
[1:30:25] does he subscribe you see some darkness
[1:30:27] than sittin I mean we have all manner I
[1:30:29] have one of my pastor friends in Ghana
[1:30:31] when we are walking in he knocks his leg
[1:30:34] against something
[1:30:35] his ghost we came to him if it's the
[1:30:36] right leg he has a mean if he's the left
[1:30:38] leg it doesn't mean she didn't go into
[1:30:40] that all we have to do is to take the
[1:30:42] wedge and leave by the way that's all
[1:30:46] human beings always are looking for
[1:30:49] sighs I just want to say the evening by
[1:30:53] Abraham when God speaks to him he makes
[1:30:56] sure that it is God the Lord is are you
[1:31:01] the creator of the heavens and the earth
[1:31:04] go back there whatever you ask to be
[1:31:07] done he spoke and Iblees are cleared
[1:31:11] power of the spoken word so even the
[1:31:17] profit had to make sure that what he was
[1:31:19] hearing was from God how much less us
[1:31:24] tribuna feet feeling so much better
[1:31:32] talking about these gluey feeling so
[1:31:40] much better talking about surely God is
[1:32:34] good to us feeling so much better
[1:32:38] amen surely the Word of God speaks for
[1:32:40] itself for himself
[1:32:43] amen will appreciate the Word of God
[1:32:45] another masterpiece amen
[1:32:49] you know it's amazing because often time
[1:32:52] we have a tendency of not knowing the
[1:32:55] scripture and sometimes reading
[1:32:57] reasoning with ourselves right and we
[1:33:02] will always do that until we realize
[1:33:05] what a true vindicated prophet is
[1:33:10] because when a man or woman comes to
[1:33:12] understand what a true vindicated
[1:33:15] prophet is he has no words coming he has
[1:33:23] no thought coming because God takes
[1:33:26] those thoughts of his himself
[1:33:30] and what he wants to speak he puts it in
[1:33:33] the mouth of a prophet and a prophet
[1:33:35] speaks his word
[1:33:36] his thoughts is that right
[1:33:39] amen and oftentimes I found like out
[1:33:42] like this when you find you wrong the
[1:33:44] only thing you can do is repair and
[1:33:46] thank God for giving you repentance and
[1:33:49] there are things amen that we have done
[1:33:52] and things that we have not understood
[1:33:54] and we still did it
[1:33:56] amen but when God gives us space to
[1:33:59] repent the wisest thing is to do is to
[1:34:03] repent you might not even be able to
[1:34:05] change your situation but you can surely
[1:34:08] repent and ask God for forgiveness and
[1:34:12] then your children you teach them
[1:34:15] correctly so you and I must understand
[1:34:19] by the grace of God you know even as a
[1:34:21] pastor I pass it for years before I
[1:34:24] fully understood who we and Brandon was
[1:34:26] I thought I knew I thought I understood
[1:34:30] I believe this message but yeah I still
[1:34:33] have my own thoughts but you got to
[1:34:37] learn that when this message call me it
[1:34:39] doesn't need your addition or your
[1:34:42] subtraction you take it for what it's
[1:34:44] worth amen only us only you you know the
[1:34:48] bride we'll do it that way yes Lord even
[1:34:51] though she may not understand like Mary
[1:34:53] law I have not known a man how can this
[1:34:56] thing be nevertheless let it be
[1:35:00] according to your word so we thank God
[1:35:03] for the message we thank God for the
[1:35:05] Word of God
[1:35:05] I you know I say amen to truth amen
[1:35:10] and everything I heard tonight was true
[1:35:12] and I still say amen
[1:35:15] you know God is real to us I am so happy
[1:35:18] to be part of the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:35:20] amen God show you things he men and you
[1:35:25] don't even understand what he's showing
[1:35:26] you a showing to showing you amen until
[1:35:29] like like I prefer the Torah preach the
[1:35:32] other day to prophecy and time meets
[1:35:33] amen we so thank God we have been so
[1:35:36] blessed amen the Word of God coming to
[1:35:39] us you know but the bride of Jesus
[1:35:41] Christ she wants true
[1:35:44] and no matter what it is amen we know by
[1:35:47] God's grace everything that has been
[1:35:50] said this evening has been true so we
[1:35:54] just thank God for being merciful to us
[1:35:57] you know gracious to us and given us a
[1:36:01] time where we can just move forward in
[1:36:05] God because true truly people the statue
[1:36:09] of a perfect man is not setting up on
[1:36:11] top of that wall over there that little
[1:36:13] image of that it's not just sitting
[1:36:15] there for you to look at it in mire the
[1:36:17] colors and that is something that must
[1:36:20] be produced it must be produced in us
[1:36:25] whether we like it or not it must be
[1:36:27] produced in it so we thank God for His
[1:36:30] grace anybody desire prayer or anything
[1:36:34] we thank God for just everything if this
[1:36:38] whole surface whole suddenly has been
[1:36:41] just wonderfully man you know just like

[1:37:53] hybrids you're not isolated every one of
[1:37:59] us are hybrids half beast and half man
[1:38:04] that's what it is
[1:38:06] none of us can escape except by in way
[1:38:10] of the blood of Jesus we were all born
[1:38:13] alike now amen
[1:38:15] two peas in one pot all sinners amen
[1:38:21] saved by the grace of God and I'm so
