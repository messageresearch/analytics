[Music] Oh Oh [Music] I shall I [Music] me [Music] [Music] even beyond [Music] hallelujah that tells the story God is good to us we stand we ask that you turn with us to the scripture we preached the other day on the message of freedom and I trust that you understand when we preach that everything we preach we preach grace now if you take it by way that is law you're getting the wrong impression if the Jews couldn't do the will of God by law surely we cannot but there is a law that God wants us to live by and that is the law of love which is Christ because he said if you love me you'll keep my Commandments I want to speak again kind of tying everything in with this freedom because I think sometimes we don't understand or it just doesn't strike us like it ought to that once you're set free you're free indeed the Bible said whom the Sun set free he is free indeed there is nothing restraints because if you realize the saving grace that God has given to you and and and and what it's entails maybe we can paint a picture tonight maybe we can do something that God will show us how much he really loved and cares for us so as we stand we're gonna ask that you turn with us to the scriptures Galatians we're gonna come there at the 6th chapter 15 verse don't forget to keep our brother rich in prayer and in Philippians 3 Galatians 6:15 the Philippians 3 the more I see this message and more I get excited about it I feel like kicking my legs back and just resting because I realize a man that everything that is being done is being done by God you say oh I got faith but don't you understand that faith is a gift it is a gift from God you can fast 40 days if you want to and that's not gonna produce faith faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God God gives you things yes education or nothing like that will give you faith galatians 6:15 for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but a new creature so what Paul was talking to the Jews because you remember they had the order of circumcision every male child was to be circumcised on the eighth day and not to be circumcised amen was a real crime and you know Paul says now that law is gone because the circumcision of the flesh was symbolic or symbolism of God circumcising the heart and that is to get rid of the Serpent's part because all of us got it we were born with it right the Serpent's part but God was to circumcise us our hearts to get rid of the Serpent's part right because he had a part in this creation this fallen creation Philippians 3:13 214th brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and that's what's very difficult for a lot of us to do is to forget the things that are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before that means there's something I had and God is saying okay forget all this don't even go back looking let's go forward I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus now watch this the calling of God in Christ Jesus that's that's the key those key words the calling of God not about him not around him but in him Christ Jesus so what was the calling of God in Christ Jesus I'm about ready to shout let us pray father God we come before your Lord we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us Lord you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves and father we realize Lord Jesus this hot calling that you have in your son dear Jesus Christ you Paul says he pressed toward that he want to see that we want to be that we want to express that help us now give us grace to see with our hearts give us grace to understand by revelation the word that would be spoken this this evening we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated this is one of the things that makes us different than all of the organizations and denominations even those who call themselves nondenominational because the Bible tells us without a vision the people perish just giving you an example an artist cannot paint without a vision he has to have something to look at to focus on something whether be in front of him or in his mind or heart wherever it may be but he himself may be let's see it must be a revelation to him if nobody else can see it he must have something in order to place it on a canvas so you and I could see and you said well what do you mean brother books you see Jesus Christ was the art of God we didn't know what God looked like what he would act like what he would be like but the Bible says that Jesus Christ was a very expressed image of God so by watching Jesus Christ we can see what God the invisible was like that is why he said to Philip he's and Thomas when you see me you see the father I am the father wonder what was it it was it was something going on there that that the normal man couldn't see and i'ma tell you something christians christians most christians don't even know what a Christian is that's why I like that song it's dripping with blood this Holy Ghost gospel is dripping with blood in other words every seed must bring forth of his kind whatever the Christians were in the earlier day can never change their character they must women if they be Christians if they're born of the same seed or of the same Holy Ghost of the same word they must reflect the very character of the original Christians because Christianity is not a denomination is organization is not a club christianity is life it is the life of christ reflecting through believers they understand me this is what paul said i'm pressing toward that mark because you got to understand Jesus Christ is the mark and if you understand Jesus you realize that Jesus was not an ordinary man though he looked ordinary though he walked ordinary though he hung around ordinary people he was not ordinary he wasn't born ordinary matter of fact Amen he was born virgin born his body he meant was created by God is that right he was a very living sacrifice or the very reflection of the invisible God that's why he said when you see me you see my father he said I can't even do nothing except the father show me and people find it very difficult because they can't understand the oneness of God and let me say it like this if you don't understand the oneness of God you'll never understand your oneness I say that a lot because amen in the Saint John the seventeenth chapter Jesus Christ pray father I would that they be one even as we are one that right he even goes on to say God give them the glory that you gave me from the beginning give it to these people oh come on somebody there is how I want to say it I want to say like my son said it to me the other day and I thought God that's really deep because through him God spoke through him and he says daddy you're different he said I can see the difference in you and and just listening to you know basically what you said he said God is calling us to be higher beings I wouldn't know how many in the service the other day or the other services beforehand could see just that that the calling that God has for all of us is not just to be Christians so-called but we are born in a way that that's different we're born like God said to Mary this thing that's in you would be of the Holy Ghost cuz we're said being a virgin I've never known a man how could this thing be and the scripture said don't worry Mary Mary the Lord shall overshadow you you understand me and the Bible says that God / shouted Mary what the Holy Ghost shall overshadow you now if the Holy Ghost is the father of Jesus then the Holy Ghost and the father must be one person cuz you can't have two daddies so we see by God's grace that if we are to be this bride and I say that because I believe that the people even around this message have allowed themselves either men to be confused or they have allowed themselves to look back and stellar forward and when we turn to look back to see what brother Branham did and not what you're supposed to be doing you lose the very image is that right everybody did not leave John when John introduced Jesus hallelujah and as it was then so is it now somebody help me here and you must understand by God's grace you're not called to become ordinary you're the highest of God's order is that right even even even in science you know they they go science be dig and and they find you know that you know in their own thoughts that man man evolved from a Polliwog then into a frog and all of that but but when it comes to evidence the highest of order he can only find a man he comes along and he finds what he called me on and at all and he filled that Neanderthal is a mixture of the monkey in man whatever but the highest of all orders he knows mankind knows the highest of the order of God's creation is man nothing supersedes his intelligence not in this world but you see there's something greater than this order because this order amen was a natural order to bring it back to where we should be understand that the first Adam amen was for spiritual man before he became natural man and you and I must understand at this creation God is bringing us back but in a higher order than it was then because we had to come to know good and evil in order to be like God somebody we had to be able like I said the other night God is looking for this generation this age to subdue the devil or the serpent come up Adam didn't do it he failed the second Adam did it the Bible said he'd not only defeated death hell and the grave but he led captivity captive and gave gifts on man hallelujah but is that we have a duty and as long as the devil can get us looking back fussing with each other striving with each other will we will fail God's intent for us for an example when Peter said Lord if that be you bid me come God said come as long as Peter kept his eyes on Jesus he stood when he started looking at all of the winds and the doctors that were around him he began to sink don't look at all of those things that coming know who you watching keep your eyes on Jesus Christ he's the only one that can lift you up out of the troubles so superior race is what I'm coming to do because everybody wants to be superior the Egyptians thought they were superior BHEL thought he was superior the Greeks thought they were superior Rome thought they were superior Hitler thought he was superior and I'm sure there's a lot more I can't remember some of that the Koreans in the end in the Chinese and the Africans I don't remember their names but everywhere you go you find somebody who think they are superior because you know what there exists a superior people [Music] hallelujah say break it down brother Brooks well the Bible said let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus hallelujah who thought it not robbery to be equal with God come on you can't if you're gonna be equal with God that means your superior but he humbled himself come on somebody see if the man puffs up like this it shows that he's it is not of God because the greater the man become the more humble he becomes that's how God is who was more superior than Jesus Christ but he came in so humble the Bible labored him as the Lamb of God it ain't no big eyes and little use there's only one big eye and that's the all-seeing eye who is God himself listen so when you we talk about a superior race we talk about people who are washed in the blood of the Lamb you know why I'm saying these things because I want you to understand that you and I don't have to believe in our hearts that because we're Christians we should allow people to dog us around show me in the scripture where Jesus Christ ever allowed anybody to dog him around you know what he was you know why because he knew who he was he wasn't afraid of the revelation that was in him he wasn't afraid to express the revelation of what was in here is that right oh it's the truth he knew who he was and when this true revelation comes into you that don't mean you mean arrogant or whatever but it's like when they tried to trap Jesus and they said Jesus let me ask you know who what authority you have we can see you didn't graduate from Harvard or Yale or any of these great seminaries who gave you your authority huh Jesus oh no no no he said let me ask you a question and if you answer my question I'll answer yours John the Baptist was he was a man or was he of God hallelujah and they got in a little air communica huddle this is not if we say Amen he came from John then he gonna ask us why didn't we believe he said but if I admit if we said it meant he didn't come from God the people don't stone us because they know John the Baptist was of God so right they went out they came back and said Lord Jesus you know we cannot tell well I love this and jesus said well says you can't tell me I can't tell you he punched him hallelujah shut him up hey man see that's what I love about God he said don't think about what you go saying just wait and I give you the words to say hallelujah see you and I must understand that this Holy Ghost is God that we serve supposed to be so real to you that you can talk to him and he can talk to you he is off the book he's off the pages he's supposed to be in you you're not like everybody else and when I say that if you truly got the Holy Ghost and you've been washed in the blood of the Lamb he meant God is changing you from glory to glory to glory to glory hallelujah if you abide in my word my word abiding you he said you could ask what you will and it shall be given unto you is that right see faith create it we was made for that purpose then through that fall listen when he says why we are taken away from that and then in Redemption we was to be brought back to it again and the only thing that in hinders the human race today from being superior and controlling like they did in the beginning is because the power line of the outlet of God made in the human being has been clogged up you understand me that means it's there but you got to unclog it that means the same Authority and power that Jesus Christ had it's in their right oh come on somebody see what can God not do is there anything too hard for God but until we come to recognize the word is for you see the word is not for us just to listen to memorize it is an instruction book it is a book that's supposed to reflect to us show us by revelation what the character of God is like what he loves and what he doesn't love is that right David said in in the scriptures I hate everything that God hates that's what he said I'm just paraphrasing it but understand this everybody can't hear this nothing brother brings you off your rocker a Christian is just a a weak individual you know he ain't got nothing else to do so he choose to be a Christian nonsense a Christian the Bible said is the salt of the earth in other words without us the world wouldn't even be preserved because we are here we still have this world moving hallelujah that's what the Bible said you get rid of the Christians the world ain't worth nothing but to be tried and upon destruction hello is that right once noir got into the OP him and his family what God did destroyed it hey what's Lord and his family got out of the city what God did he started there was nothing worth saving hey that sounds funny but it's true now we're back in the same condition but where is the little amateur gods where is the Messiah where are those who are now expressing the reason that they very are unseen God in their lives there must be somewhere you see because everybody won't be able to see it you know let me put it this way you and I must come to recognize that the word speaks of us and understand the word that it's been spoken prepared you for this hour you didn't come unprepared God prepared you prepare to you before you knew you was being prepared first of all he gave you a seed gene he gave you something that will cause you to recognize your day and his message ain't nothing you did he did it and you and I must understand that he prepared it what do you brothers let me say it like this when Isaiah when he spoke a virgin shall conceive I think was eight hundred years later and don't you know that when Isaiah spoke that he had nothing else to say how many see anything could have been there what did you say how was that going to be done it wasn't his business and nobody else's business it's our ludicrous but he never questioned it he knew that inspiration was of God and no doubt the people when they first heard it thought oh my god this is wonderful and all those look virgins they men thought they would be the one eight hundred years later see if God speaks it it cannot come back boy it doesn't matter how long it takes it has to come to pass hallelujah like you know for example we know that California is gonna fall been a long time coming it doesn't matter how long it takes it's going to happen even scientist says it's going to happen and if you living while it happened when it happens you're in trouble because I believe by God's grace that that's during the time of the rapture hallelujah the property God ties that into the rapture and the sixth seal of early it is now let me move on because I'm talking about something that you and I must understand you did not elect yourself you did not choose yourself like Mary didn't but you know when Isaiah said that a virgin shall conceive God knew her name was going to be married you say all praise God I just so happened to come no you didn't everything has been ordained of God and every seat is gonna bring forth of his kind why this message seemed to interest you you don't even know why but it's because of the God that he placed in you yes or what do you mean brothers remember even before you even thought about coming becoming a Christian there was always something in you that would turn on every time you did wrong you always felt bad about it you always wanted to feel better it's the truth even when you as a sinner maybe some of your friends could do things you couldn't even do but the opportunity was there why didn't you do it for something in here registering wrong it's wrong what was that that a little peace of God I say that little piece of a seed that little see God put in you thank God for God hallelujah so what are you saying brother Brooks I'm trying to comfort you tonight we got to stop this fighting and when I say that fighting with ourselves you can't change a lecture you can't change it it's saddled it's fixed and if you're gonna do anything you must believe that you are because if you can believe that you are elected to be bribed you began to act like it every word you hear in this Bible we began to make you mature and grow it's only when you doubt because faith comes by hearing hearing by the Word of God right but God is only pleased by faith and understand God is giving you the faith to believe this you couldn't just believe this on your own is that right it's the truth faith it has to be there remember in the property God says I don't have basically need faith because once God showed me a vision I know it's gonna come to pass but God had to try my faith he had to give me faith to have faith right God has to give you faith why do you think some can believe in some can't because God gives Psalm and God don't give others other that's my gifts are there so we can work together in love somebody help me she all cannot see except my father draws him first and all that the father has given me will come to me no man can understand who he is or how it is except it be revealed to you by the revelation of God is that right oh come on it's the truth Peter who you say I am he said all some say the dark you John the Baptist he John about the Jeremiah one of the prophets you know but she said who do you say I the Son of Man I love that I love that that scene right now because Peter said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God what was he saying you are God in flesh according to the Jew a son of God is God and so he was saying he said Oh flesh and blood did not reveal this to you and he's saying his flesh his blood didn't reveal no other man's flesh and blood review this but my father who is the Holy Ghost who is the Holy Spirit he's quickened this to you he revealed it to you and upon this rock I'll build my church see because once God reveals the world to you nobody can take it hallelujah nobody can snatch it nobody can steal it it becomes so personal it becomes a part of you right because even when Mary says all Lord I mean to that angel how can this thing be knowing that I'm not seeing a man the Holy Ghost will overshadow you then she said be it unto me according to that word then she didn't go to it Elizabeth says you know I think I'm pregnant no there was no signs but she ran to Elizabeth said Elizabeth I want you to know I've had an experience with God and the angel king and he told me I had I'm bearing the Messiah and he and this was a tall she was happy I'm bearing Messiah and his name shall be Jesus that baby who've been dead and Elizabeth womb for six months began to leave for Josh hallelujah and if the name of Jesus can wait to dad baby what about us huh and you know what when Mary received that revelation she was willing to die for her revelation now because Joseph surely was going to stone and no matter what she said Joseph wasn't believing her hallelujah it took God to step in how would you have been if your wife is telling you she's pregnant not with a man but God gave her the baby hallelujah can young it wasn't a tough decision for Jonah it was difficult I knew is difficult to the Bob said George was gonna take her privately and he was go stone her you ain't shaming me with that report who gonna believe that nobody's gonna believe that all right it took God to intervene but from that point on Mary knew who she was that's why it was such a critical thing when when Jesus got lost and she began to testify among the Pharisees and the Sadducees your father and I she she literally cut her testimony to a zero but Jesus Christ being the word saying no no no no no woman I'd be about my father's business never call her mother because she's never was how can she be the mother of God come on she had nothing to do with it God created the blood and the body that Scripture she was an incubator she was a surrogate mother find me anywhere in the scripture he ever called her mother hmm I don't mean to mess up your Christmas but that's the truth faith is a revelation as I said it is a gift from God by what his grace you can't merit it you can't earn it you can't work it is God giving it to you you see if Mary had had anything blood wise to deal to do with Jesus Jesus body would have been in just as sinful as everybody else's because these bodies are contaminated hallelujah and these bodies are meant to die y'all hear what I'm saying he could not and if he had been part of that his blood was to being so contaminated he would not have been able to redeem us God needed a pure blood hallelujah he needed a pure blood you to the anointing of the hour this is what we must understand we must understand there is an anointing that comes with this message it ain't just a Pentecostal jumping shouting speaking in tongues running up and down the aisle all of that is good when it's God but everything that dude you know ain't always God but the thing that God has come to do is to bring a new creation somebody help me here is that right the Bible and I'm gonna get I'm gonna move on now the Bible said that Jesus Christ according to revelation third chapter is the beginning of the creation of God well then how can God be created he's not talking about the spirit he's talking about the flesh body the creation of God that's right the first ball and meeting impairs the firstborn there must be second third and fourth hallelujah yes sir and you and I must understand that when we received the Holy Ghost the real Holy Ghost we are born of God we now been created in His image is that right and God is reflected expecting us to reflect his character in this world that's why I said ye are the light of the world see this is what gets me there's so many people think you know we're just gonna make this a religion we're just gonna settle down and we ought to call ourselves you know that's foolishness because by doing that you become starchy you become cold you become formal and the very image that you are supposed to be reflecting is actually lost it's the truth listen it's the truth look at the Pharisees and the Sadducees when Jesus came on the scene they were so off the word they did not even recognize the God they worshiped here it comes in refresh reflecting it wasn't bad it was bad bad bad huh here it is because Israel always believed in the supernatural Moses Joshua they knew the supernatural was real but here was a man born blind thirty years and he receives his sight by the touch of the master's hand Jesus himself and we remember if you know the scripture they said they had a order that if anybody believe in this Jesus Christ we're gonna kick them out to church read your Bible is it there and this man who was born blind mom and daddy was afraid to testify by their son because they was afraid that they will be kicked out of their church in that the truth isn't that real how people even to this day it meant claimed to be leave this message but they are afraid to testify of it because they might lose friends or may be kicked out of their church no that's insanity nobody don't care and the thing about it is when you leave what you know is truth they laugh you and mock you as a hypocrite it's the truth and Jesus amen amen and here's the man says wait a minute I've never gone to theological seminary I don't know nothing about this thing he's about I tell you what I do know is it true that even in your law we know that the devil can hear you yet you called Jesus a devil and you said we know that the devil came here right he said I'll tell you what that's settled the whole thing let me tell you the way it is I was was blind but now I see you know what they did they got mad with the man what you trying to do convert us they keep them out of church but when they kick them out of touch then Jesus came hallelujah every time you get in trouble every because you stand on the Word of God gee Christ Himself will personally come by to encourage you hmm what we're dealing with now in this agent this is important this is important because it's not enough to know the message you see what I'm saying when I say this I mean intellectually don't you know you can get pregnant intellectually huh when I was in the Apostolic Church years ago this is the one of the babies so bad and she believes she had one and she ate like it and she grew like it but every time she went to the doctor they say ain't nothing day in her mind she was thinking she was pregnant oh people I think that's what we're dealing with now it's in the people's mind that they have been impregnated ain't got nothing in there you don't want to show up at the end of the day with nothing there it cannot be a mind game it must be a transformation it must be something that can be visible and not only visible you need to feel some kicks and things every now and again and any woman that refuses a man his child has no right to be a wife to him even you remember in the Bible when the Kings married Esther because of Queen refused he just got him another one what happened when he refuses to come out with the King and obey him the same thing it is with the woman that refuses to be the wife of her husband so what do you saying I'm getting ready to move on with that cuz I look and I see around this I don't use the term but the churches that we fellowship with we fellowship with whoever world ever would allow us to but my point is I see like a vasti gathering together they're having a great revival among themselves intellectually but refusing the king hmm are they refusing again you stop preaching about Jesus a coming to Jesus and giving your heart to Jesus and and and and dying and rioting to Jesus see you got to come to Jesus the king is calling oh come on it's happening whether you want to agree with this and not this came from God and I'm gonna tell you something is happening Oh where's the birth where's the fire hallelujah and if you have failed to become impregnated with this word God will put you away also deals with the church that refuses to become pregnant in the age that we now live in to bring forth children of this age we are not Lutheran's we're not Wesleyan neither are we Pentecostals we've got to be the children of this age through the pregnancy of the Word of God to bring forth a child of this age the seed child a man I hope you understand couldn't be praying couldn't be pregnant No so what did he do put her away in divorcement that's right she but she dares put him away he put her away he went right in revealing his word to the body and vindicating him shame by himself by what his children were you saying Lutheran's used to be real Lutheran's they were impregnated by that revelation to just shall live by faith but they organized and they died put away wesley ins get the same pentecost has done the same and i fear that a lot of people around this so-called message amen is doing the same thing Christ must be seen he must be seen it ain't about all of is that the truth we have typed out the prophet of God for years what he did what God has done in the devil I guess why cuz he knows you don't see the vision of who you are you see him but you can't see yourself you don't see where you are positionally placed hallelujah and you must understand and then when when we're not ah ah did we see Rebecca ELISA moved off the scene hallelujah and what happened Isaac and Rebecca with we're in Sarah's tent the old-fashioned way and the old-fashioned way is what Malachi for came to turn us back to and that is the real genuine Pentecostal experience it must be that is the old-time way hallelujah I hope you understand revealing his word to the body and vindicating him the same by himself his children began to to kind of look more like him because it's fully maturing or they become children of the word not children of the church children of the word and the bride will be a lovely little lady of the word unadulterated not touched by any man's organization any man-made theory she'll be purely unadulterated pride of the word a man and I hope you get that see that's what's getting me because I told the Lord that says God and I told my son I said I can't help it I'm different I can't help it I made this way I'm just made this way I can't help it I want God real you know I'm not about popularity why am I here I had a far bigger church than this I don't care about that could have been famous yeah had opportunities to be in Hollywood I didn't want that I'm different and I've known that from a child I'm different there's something I don't care about my fault because God didn't look about my fault hallelujah God ain't looking at my steering ways that's what grace has done for me that's what grace has done for you God is looking at the Commission that he's given you and you and I I have one desire it see the manifestations of the sons of God in my day the very thing that the whole creation is groaning for I've got to see it I've got to be a part of it because I know I am there's no way to explain it when the revelation drops in your heart it just drops in your heart you become a fool for Christ I told my friend I told whoever I was talking to I said listen I said I don't run around I'm faithful by God's grace I don't look for all this great money hello let me say it like this yes God has delivered me from a lot of things that's what makes me know he's real hmm sanctification has been a process for me just like it is for everybody else hallelujah joy doesn't matter when it comes to us who and what he said what what do you mean brother Brooks I don't know a man yet who's been born of a woman or a woman who's not born as a sinner sinner right faulty but guess what this old man must die and rock in order for Jesus Christ to live in you right oh it's the truth you got to come into faith into Christ but faith is not just a thing the Bible said in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God by this word all things were created by him so it's a person hallelujah she and the Bible tells us and listen I love this amen I love this first Corinthians 15 for 4549 just to back up what I'm trying to say and it is so written the first man Adam was made a living soul the last man Adam was made a quickening spirit I'll be in that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual in other words Jesus came after Adam the spiritual man came after the Adam the natural man right the first man is of the earth earthly the second man is the lord from heaven so one man this man came from the earth but that it was made that's been born again it came from the lord of heaven that's where we come from that's why we're so different we can't help it hallelujah as is the earthly such are they also that are earthly and as is the heavenly such are they also that are heavenly that's why the world can't comprehend you darkness cannot comprehend light and light can't comprehend darkness right call me you say how can they do that you can't in Kenny you can't answer me but people do think that you can't even comprehend why they would do it then they looked at you said oh what's wrong with y'all y'all don't know how to have fun and they don't understand how fun comes from God you know I hate people who you know I'm so bored I do not let that spirit I don't know it me how can I be bored and sitting in heavenly places if you bored that means you ain't in the right place y'all better hear what I'm saying it's the truth you said what do you mean let me saying like this when you were born and out we were born we were born into this third dimension third right this is the natural man three three one two three right but when we were born of God we change dimensions from the third to the sixth dimension come on somebody and the Bible says we are supposed to live like we are in the sixth I mentioned not the tire because our influence now it's coming from that dimension is that right brother Balaam said it he said as you are whatever is influenced you now it is what you are what whatever right if you've been being influenced from down there you acting like they do right and if you be influenced from heaven you acting like they do is that right holy holy holy said the law your life must speak that that's why the high priest when he had those pump granted those bells on him when he walked holy holy holy is the Lord that's how he went and the footstep of a righteous man are ordered by the Lord see this is another creation God has created something new on you he's not patching you up huh y'all remember how those patches always stood out for some reason mama didn't know how to get the right color to cover your rip pants or whatever the case may be some of y'all don't know way y'all don't know what patches are except those ones those high-class jeans they got now that they put on the patches but back in the day patches were necessary and needed amen but God is not patching you up he's trying to give you a complete change I knew you you said all brother was what are you saying remember Peter was a hot-tempered Jew and history no no no no no no no reflection said he was a redheaded hot but my point is amen he had a temper y'all agree with that that's right and the thing that gets me Amen that Peter also was so fired up Amen when they came to crucify Jesus he swung for the man's head and God is here cuz the man does you know there is no way other way to get a man's ear swinging he'd up and when he ducked Peter God is here and Jesus picked up the ears slapped it back on there you know I don't even understand what I meant then become and convert it right then hallelujah he says oh you are the Messiah he didn't ha because there was nothing in him Yoshio said how many people in this America have seen miracles after miracles after miracles at the miracles and they still yet don't follow Jesus how because it mean all that you see that converts you it's the word that converts you right it can't be with oh I see miracles signs and wonders harley lily of many people look at israel millions saw the rest she open saw all the plagues of egypt and they get out there in the wilderness and they complain they murmured and complain so much God says that's enough I'm fed up with this nonsense you're not enter into my rest hello so you understand in this season it's not wise to murmur and complain if it got on his nerve did either get on his nerve now if I can put it in a human's turn alright you said what what do you mean as we have borne the image of the earthly oh we should also bear the image of the heavenly what was there having the image Jesus Christ and how did we see that after his resurrection he had his glorified body hallelujah they were there in the upper room and he walked right through the wall with no sound still doing miracles come on somebody vanishing and fear they're all you're talking about see I know Hollywood try to duplicate it and copy it but they don't know this is the real real deal this is the this is the Wizards where they get it all from Holly yeah is that right oh people don't want to believe in the Bible but why do they believe in good and evil how do we know good and evil except we understand it by the Bible huh is that the truth but every Hollywood movie is gonna be good and evil true you know if there's no good and evil just throw it all away and let a man do what he wants to do you can't labor him good not even coz there ain't nothing in law there's no law to govern him but the pipe see how conscious even tells us that this Bible is right whoo I'm feeling good tonight I don't know what y'all feeling is good I feel like flying away because I realize I don't have to worry anymore don't you understand if you are selected and elected by God don't God doing it it's his work he is the workmanship he is the Potter and we're the claim he Moses he shapes us but he needs for you to believe that the work that he starts in you he's faithful to complete it that's what he wants from you don't worry about how long it takes when God gets ready to finish his finish you said what do you mean brother God said let there be light and history doesn't even tell you how long it took for that light to be manifested it may have taken 800 years of law but we can see it came is that right look how God shed a virgin shall conceive it took 800 years longer than America existed but it came it came and we look at it like oh it's just but we don't understand how long it took for it to come and look what all went on in between that I'm in this time look at the book of Genesis when God prophesied in the 3rd chapter that Jesus would come huh how many thousands of years it took for Jesus to come but he was there all the time hallelujah is that our high it's the truth mechanic is that right Abraham met because of it after the battle you understand me there was a shadow in the type of us meeting the Lord Jesus Christ after the battle when it's all over hallelujah yes we'll have communion with him oh yes it's a real thing a man just like the world don't even know about the flying saucers Oh UFOs yes their unidentified objects to you hallelujah but we know who they are we know what they are they are investigating angels that's why they can move from one dimension to another and they think they just running no no no they changing them they hope they move boom they're gone not even a sonic boom what are they looking at they're looking at the world they're judging the world they looking at the world writing everything down and they saying Lord it's time hmm oh it's true you know God is what God is everywhere God is but by omniscience God is a man in the form and image of a man before he was a man he with your spirit but when Jesus raised from the dead he gave him all power and all authority in heaven and in earth but because he knows all things he can be everywhere in that sense is that Alright Lord have you seen what's going on down there all his angels are telling him man yeah I've been looking but have you seen Lord you know these three Hebrew boys they've been praying and you know they haven't even got an answer from you don't worry I got it all under control see some battles that we go through God has chosen to get in there with you for himself hallelujah sometime you let ministering spirits work it but there are times God come himself especially when the battle is rough like I told the Lord you know I I don't want to go to heaven you know you know you know everything all smooth ain't no scars no where yeah what battle you've been in and you ain't got not even a scratch you don't sound like you was AWOL hiding somewhere if you gonna be in a battle you need some scars I had a friend I'll tell you what who it was a you know brother Craig ball he was a professional pretty much almost a professional boxing everything he said boy when they got a black guy he they wore that black guy like a trophy they wanted people to see they win a fight yeah I know what I'm saying it's the truth now that's man who won hmm it's something about that it is something about that a little you love the Lord for who is in the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature who is he talking about Jesus Christ for by him we're all things created that are in heaven that are in earth visible invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities of power all things were created by him and this is what a partner like for him that means you too God knew you was coming here before you came he already prepared it for you y'all know it is the truth I desired I wanted to be an artist so bad I like art I love stuff like that you know me and I tried and I tried and then when I got to sculpturing I was finished I had to you know we had to do something like you know the head of a man oh my goodness you were not even wanted to see that here it didn't even look as well as the Neanderthal you know me it was bad that's when I gave it up but you see why because it wasn't my gift right but I came out singing right I didn't even know I could sing and you know when I started taking notice to my voice when my brother who always liked to beat up on me told me I could sing so I knew it must be true cuz he ain't gonna tell me nothin nice so I started paying attention and it got to the place where he started wrecking me recommended me to audition for these certain singing functions and stuff so and I say that only now don't you think I'm arrogant prideful that's that's not true cuz I don't listen to me singing I don't go home and like wow that was good I can't stand my voice because my voice wasn't given for me and I work with the Ananta y'all understand me I work with his anointing yes I think all right I gotta go home and listen I gotta play this over cuz I thought that was good Oh y'all think I'm crazy but they're people like that you know the invisible God let me hurry up here the invisible God I know I can't complete it all but what I'm trying to say is that it we can't be just church members we've got that seek God we gotta lay as the prophet of God said in the presence of the son play them tapes and when you hear you hear something that you know you don't you don't have you know what you need to do ask for mercy because God is rich in see we know we've got grace y'all understand me grace is unmerited but mercy is what we mean cuz we're gettin in trouble all of us are coming short hello don't tell me you're not you can't say you're not if you tell it and you don't be truthful every day we're falling short and every day we need to ask for God's mercy it doesn't mean you're not saved you're saying is that right you're saved you make a heaven if you keep asking for his mercy and really mean it because the Bible said His mercies are renewed every morning it never runs out god don't get tired of you saying have mercy especially when you mean it and when you mean it he comes to your rescue whoo she the devil his man you know why he's mad cuz some people are beginning to see what he's done and how he's tricked a lot of people this bride like I started this message I said this bride is preparing for a new world don't get that out of your heart lord help me prepare for this new world I know that sounds crazy I don't have a world to take you to but he does say John 14 that not your heart be troubled that's what I love about it don't worry about it if you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house there are many mansions if it were not so I wouldn't have told you I go to prepare a place for you that where I am there you may be also that's the 14th chapter he's talking that and then the 17th chapter says Lord father I ask of you one thing that these who believe in me according to their word Peter Paul James and John I would they be with me hey Lord you know you know st. John 17 that God loves us with the love that he had for Jesus Christ himself is that right Paul st. no man ever hated his body oh lord have mercy let me hurry up it's just okay listen Saint John 10 1929-30 says my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand do you know what that means that means that before God I put it this way in the beginning before God became logos which we know the logos is Jesus Christ because before he came became low-cost he had already given us an inheritance he had already identified us as sons he saw the attributes in him and he had to make a way for these men attributes to be made manifest oh the thing that I love is that after this world after this scene of the drama hallelujah there will not be another Lucifer there not be another murder or killing we can't we can't even believe we can't even fathom a world that there's no stench no pollution no water filters everything is pure you and I can't even imagine not think about this one not having a evil thought I told the Lord I said if I could get rid of this body I'll be perfect it's this thing that causes me to fall y'all is this thing that caused me to drop back I know what the inner man is saying I know what he wants and he wants to be just like his daddy all right listen what he says he says no make him pluck them out of my hand 30 verses I and my father are one father I would they be one even as we are one you understand me that's a higher being there's nothing higher than that being you know that's why the bride takes the city her reward is greater than all of the ages before her you understand me this is the hardest and most difficult age ever you should all know the dark ages no sir you know why because the dark ages they recognize the enemy this this age is so deceptive and so much deception is difficult to to recognize the devil sometimes the devil right on you and you don't even see him but in that day they knew when they were dying they were dying for Jesus Christ oh they could see their enemy nowadays amen the devil come in such a subtle way religious not serpent himself around y'all understand me and listen when we preach we're not trying to preach people into some kind of religion we're talking about salvation we're talking about being filled with the Holy Ghost letting God virtues coming to you the Lord and don't you understand folks it is a battle a battle you love the Lord just give me just a few more minutes see the Holy Ghost is the father of Jesus Christ is that right yeah some people say wait a minute buddy two years and then people it gotta be two of no it's tier one marry his mother when she was exposed to Joseph she was found with the child of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the father of Jesus Christ and when the Holy Ghost comes and reveals the word and makes it live just exact then it's a revelation to you you see it's unfolded for example like myself or like some of you who've ever been healed you've been healed how did you get it you didn't have to pray it was a revelation that God had healed you I mean we pray right we do pray but many people pray and don't get the revelation that they healed but when you pray God dropped that revelation and whatever devil that was in you had to go of course you know you were healed there was not all brother Bruce listen when when I had the cancer and everything and you know the doctors and you know anything what about it just fell into that groove I may have not been here today but when you know God is a healer hey let me tell you something when Cigna strikes you like that you search the house you want to make sure ain't nothing going into you from your healing and I'm gonna tell you just in that time I searched the house I ask God God if there be anything I've done show me Lord and when God showed me there was nothing that I had done that's okay I got some fighting ground now because if I had seen something I've done I'll make it right you understand me so that's what that's the only way God would reveal it to you now my point my point is this I'm gonna stop because there's no way I can finish all of this but my thing is this because God I knew they wanted to cut on me and do all this kind of stuff and that was nonsense and anybody that takes like to say it but I put this way God just didn't give me a whatever that is for me to take revel a radiation I know radiation kills you it's poison and whatever it if it doesn't kill the cancer is killing everything else doctors alone at that's why so many doctors are afraid to get cancer they don't look answer cuz they don't believe in and they don't know nothing that can cure it and they test and try you just like my friend my friend I just died just prior to me leaving the one that was in South Africa a precious friend of mine and I told him about how God healed me and the next time I talked to him he was telling me he was on radiation and I just couldn't say nothing I was so discouraged by his him doing that but he said that's where he was and so what can I say about it if you feel led to do it then do it I stood with him though in spite of it all and then the next thing I know Amen they telling him Amen that they gonna give him a new liver they gave him a liver I don't know how I prayed if his wife is listening to this that she understand my thoughts about it you know he's going on to be with the Lord and he did the best he could and he felt led to do it and you know one thing for certain of God was God was finished with him and that's the way God led him to go to take him out but I'm saying as for me I wouldn't have gone that way and and the thing is that they gave him his blood type if I got it correctly his blood type was a and then the liver donor was B plus a B they killed it they gave all this medication trying to make it work it was not going without a miracle it wasn't gonna work and then the the gallbladder or whatever that they found had melanoma so they had to take that portion of the cancer off the liver where every location I don't know but wherever it was they had to do that you understand me the man lived they didn't kind of you know his kidneys failed a bit more time he bled out one time and he still lived but one day he told me that he had a dream and he in this dimension he saw living stones and he said he saw the high priest of God that he described him to me I never said this to him but I thought to myself I said well brother yeah God got you on your way out I never told him that so but anyway when he died just like I said a few days before I left to go to Guyana was really uh it was just a very odd situation because he and I have been discussing the word all almost two to three times a week by God's grace but he still lives my brother's not dead he sleeps and I can't Holly wait to see him on the other side no matter which way we go we got to go one way or the other and I've seen God do some reckless things but when that doctor wanted me to take radiation and all that stuff I told him no you know why I don't love this life like that I don't and I'm not afraid of death I ain't holding on to nothing got it my wife don't like me talking like this but it's the truth because somebody had to leave me death is what happens somebody gonna leave you are you gonna leave somebody that's the way it works huh and I'll be honest with you I said God took care of me when everybody left me he'll take care of you when I leave ya he's got everything planned you love the Lord and I must say we must labor to enter into his rest y'all know what I'm saying and when I say that I'm closing now cuz I keep going but you see you got to come to a place where you got to believe what's being preached not just for me but from the prophet of God you got to believe that that is the only way faith is the only thing that will make it live you can't come oh I hope it's for me no it's got to be for you hope don't work not in this situation you gotta have faith you see what I mean yes brother branham how well I mean how can I make the rapture he said you know what he said read your Bible every day and pray why because if you read your Bible every day and pray God will change you and give you the faith that you need to operate it that's how simple it is read your Bible everyday and pray God will open the word to you is that right he would give you the faith to put it in action it ain't complicated it's simple but what we need to do is focus I'm gonna make this rapture Lord help me give me your grace in your mercy that I will cut loose everything that's not like you that I will become pleasing to you and that I will become that very image that used for song from the foundation of the world Lord let it be me I feel the call I feel the pool and Lord Jesus I'm reaching out like Paul saying I'm reaching out for you love the Lord Lester you know that song I'm
