[41:52] a little bit too loud now
[41:54] god is good to us
[41:57] and we thank the lord for his grace and
[41:58] his mercy
[42:00] before i get into the word of god we
[42:03] very seldom announce this little
[42:04] magazine that
[42:06] is sent to us periodically and i think
[42:08] it comes from
[42:10] well the eddie biscuits church
[42:12] but from the brother brother
[42:14] tim dodd is one that
[42:16] makes sure he gets out and go through
[42:19] but it's always a fascinating magazine
[42:21] and
[42:22] and i think sometime they ask for
[42:24] donations they don't ask but
[42:26] if you ever feel like sending because
[42:28] there is a great work they do behind
[42:30] this
[42:31] is to be a little missionary work that
[42:33] you can do
[42:35] because they go to different places
[42:38] and on this one it says a revival
[42:40] unexpected revival
[42:42] in uganda
[42:44] those are the good kind
[42:46] amen so if you we have some more
[42:48] magazines back there
[42:50] if you like to look at them also for
[42:52] those
[42:53] who are
[42:55] adults who have children and they've
[42:56] been thinking about homeschooling
[43:00] we know that
[43:01] they have a home schooling program there
[43:04] and
[43:05] you can
[43:06] check into what it's all about and maybe
[43:09] you
[43:10] might find an interest in it especially
[43:12] if you have
[43:13] little ones that needs to be
[43:14] homeschooled
[43:16] we know by god's grace that uh
[43:18] things are getting so bad in the public
[43:20] schools
[43:21] that uh
[43:23] it makes us want to just leave the earth
[43:26] but by god's grace we've got to stay
[43:28] here until jesus is
[43:30] ready and prepared for us
[43:32] glad to see everybody here tonight
[43:35] amen
[43:38] as we stand
[43:42] we're going to come from uh two passages
[43:44] of scripture we thank our
[43:46] musicians
[43:48] uh for playing for us
[43:50] i believe by god's grace in the song
[43:52] leader
[43:58] we appreciate everyone that
[44:01] participate even those who are in the
[44:02] audience
[44:04] it really means a lot when you get
[44:05] behind the song leader and sing and
[44:09] not sing to your neighbor but saying to
[44:11] to god
[44:14] that that that one song i don't know
[44:15] what you come to do you know and it says
[44:18] i didn't come to look at you
[44:21] i came to praise the lord
[44:24] that's right we don't come to look at
[44:25] each other we come to praise the lord
[44:30] we love the lord
[44:33] we like to come from revelations to 19th
[44:36] chapter
[44:39] for those of you who were here during
[44:42] the time of our brother isaiah
[44:44] bowa's ministry uh
[44:47] that was absolutely wonderful and
[44:50] i felt conviction in my soul
[44:54] i teared up
[44:56] i mean everything that was said was
[44:58] truth
[44:59] the only disappointment that i did have
[45:03] is that i didn't see the altar
[45:05] and i trust fool i i trust that your
[45:08] altar was your heart
[45:10] because
[45:12] my how can you
[45:14] hear
[45:16] the voice of god and that's what that
[45:18] was
[45:20] that was not isaiah
[45:22] that was actually the voice of god
[45:24] visiting this little assembly
[45:26] and i thought oh my god what a real
[45:29] blessing
[45:30] that god will
[45:33] find time
[45:35] to visit us
[45:37] but what a disgrace
[45:41] if we didn't hear
[45:42] and see that that was the voice of god
[45:45] and not the voice of a man
[45:50] it's not always easy to minister in that
[45:53] way
[45:54] you have to really put move yourself out
[45:56] of the way to
[45:59] hear the voice i heard it
[46:02] and i repented
[46:06] revelations 19
[46:08] beginning at the seventh verse
[46:15] let us be glad and rejoice
[46:18] and give honor to him for the marriage
[46:21] of the lamb is come
[46:23] and his wife hath made
[46:26] herself ready
[46:29] and to her was granted that she should
[46:32] be arrayed in fine linen
[46:34] clean and white
[46:36] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[46:39] of the saints
[46:40] and he saith unto me
[46:42] right
[46:43] blessed are they which are called unto
[46:46] the marriage supper of the lamb
[46:48] and he said unto me these are the true
[46:52] sayings of god
[46:55] and i fell at his feet to worship him
[46:58] and he said unto me see thou do it not
[47:02] i am thy fellow servant
[47:05] and of thy brethren that have the
[47:07] testimony of jesus christ
[47:11] worship god
[47:12] for the testimony of jesus christ
[47:16] is the spirit
[47:18] of prophecy
[47:20] one more scripture
[47:22] first peter 2.
[47:25] first peter 2.
[47:34] we have had many sermons messages
[47:38] and maybe i'm just in a position where
[47:41] i can hear and feel
[47:43] uh messages easier now than i used to be
[47:46] able to
[47:48] i know all of the young ministers have
[47:50] brought tremendous messages
[47:53] and they all have fed the church
[47:56] and i appreciate everyone that has come
[47:58] up behind the pulpit
[48:01] and and have allowed themselves to be
[48:03] used by god
[48:05] i just thought that i would point this
[48:07] one out from isaiah because
[48:11] when i heard it it was it was my heart's
[48:13] cry
[48:15] and so anyway
[48:17] i trust that you
[48:18] will understand
[48:20] we're not
[48:21] preferring anyone
[48:24] we're just thanking god for being able
[48:26] to hear the voice of god
[48:28] through his lips
[48:30] the ninth verse
[48:33] second first peter second chapter
[48:43] but ye are a chosen generation
[48:50] a royal priesthood
[48:53] a holy nation
[48:56] that's the part i think many people miss
[49:00] they love the generation they love the
[49:02] royal priesthood but they forget the
[49:03] holy nation
[49:06] a peculiar people
[49:08] and that doesn't mean you make yourself
[49:09] peculiar
[49:11] but because of the holy ghost in you you
[49:14] appear to be peculiar to the world
[49:17] that you should show forth the praises
[49:19] of him who have called you
[49:21] out of darkness into his marvelous light
[49:25] which in time past were not a people but
[49:28] are now the people of god which have not
[49:31] obtained mercy but now have obtained
[49:34] mercy
[49:36] dearly beloved
[49:37] i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims
[49:41] abstain from fleshly lust which war
[49:44] against the soul
[49:47] having your conversations honest among
[49:50] the gentiles
[49:51] that whereas they speak against you as
[49:54] evildoers
[49:55] they may buy your good works
[49:59] which they shall be hold
[50:02] glorify god
[50:04] in the day of visitation
[50:08] it goes right back to
[50:10] our brother speaking on
[50:13] being a billboard
[50:16] let us pray
[50:18] father we so thank you for your goodness
[50:21] we thank you for your grace and your
[50:23] mercy
[50:24] you have been better to us than we have
[50:27] been to ourselves
[50:29] we thank you for
[50:31] your habitation
[50:33] abiding in us
[50:35] and allowing us to abide in you
[50:38] god
[50:39] the union in which you
[50:41] have given unto us
[50:43] cannot be broken
[50:45] but there is things that you are
[50:47] expecting
[50:49] uh of us
[50:51] and these great things only come by
[50:54] yielding to your voice
[50:56] yielding to your word
[50:58] yielding to your holy spirit
[51:01] and i pray lord tonight that you would
[51:03] grant these things
[51:05] that the world and all of our associates
[51:08] and friends
[51:10] may see jesus in us
[51:12] be kind and merciful to us dear god
[51:16] give us the grace to humble ourselves
[51:19] to completely die out to our will
[51:22] that your will be done
[51:24] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[51:28] you may be seated
[51:31] first of all we know that we come in an
[51:33] aged
[51:34] age that we must be tried
[51:38] tribulations trials
[51:41] these things come they must come
[51:43] you can't be perfected without them
[51:46] your gold
[51:48] tried in the fire
[51:51] and according to the seven church age
[51:54] the prophet of god says seven golden
[51:56] candlesticks in exodus 2 25 25 31 it
[52:00] says and thou shalt make
[52:03] a candlestick of pure gold
[52:07] a beaten work
[52:09] shall the candlesticks be made
[52:12] his shaft and his branches his bows his
[52:16] knobs his flowers shall be the same
[52:21] the true church of jesus christ
[52:24] the bride
[52:25] is likened
[52:26] to pure gold
[52:28] in saying this he's saying
[52:31] you must be beaten
[52:33] you must be formed you must be shaped
[52:36] out of the same substance
[52:38] that he was made from
[52:41] her righteousness is his righteousness
[52:45] her attributes are his own glorious
[52:48] attributes
[52:50] her identity is found in him
[52:53] what he is
[52:55] she is to reflect
[52:57] what he has
[52:59] she is to manifest y'all hear that these
[53:03] are these words are not written for
[53:05] poetry
[53:07] these words are written because they are
[53:10] to live
[53:12] what he has
[53:14] she is to what
[53:16] manifest
[53:18] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[53:20] and forever i just interjected that
[53:23] there is no fault in her
[53:27] she is all glorious
[53:30] within
[53:32] now reading that you you you would
[53:34] probably think to yourself
[53:36] how can that ever be
[53:39] but you must understand that is the duty
[53:42] of the church or the bride is to reflect
[53:45] jesus christ to the world
[53:47] in the absence of the son of god
[53:51] and we should all believe that amen
[53:54] and the duties as i said is to reflect
[53:58] the lord jesus christ
[54:00] in every way
[54:03] now
[54:04] you and i say well by god's grace how
[54:06] can that possibly be
[54:08] first of all
[54:10] the word
[54:11] has spoken
[54:16] she is all
[54:18] glorious within and without
[54:22] from the beginning to the ending she is
[54:24] the work of her lord did you hear that
[54:27] she is the work of her lord
[54:31] and all his works are perfect
[54:34] in fact
[54:36] in her is summed up
[54:39] and manifested the eternal wisdom
[54:42] and purpose of god
[54:45] the whole entire bible
[54:47] has been wrapped
[54:49] around or expressed
[54:52] about
[54:53] you
[54:55] everything
[54:56] god has done and displayed from the old
[55:00] to the new testament
[55:02] you and i have uh have been chosen to be
[55:05] the epitome of of his creation amen
[55:11] we can't keep slacking
[55:13] amen
[55:16] god is calling for repentance
[55:20] and you know it all depends on how bad
[55:22] you want it
[55:26] he says how can one fathom it we can't
[55:30] how can one understand it
[55:33] though we cannot do that
[55:35] we can accept it by faith
[55:38] for god
[55:39] has spoken it
[55:42] and this is what he's saying see what we
[55:44] fail to do is take the word by faith
[55:48] by revelation
[55:50] that's me
[55:53] claim it to be you
[55:55] even when you can't see
[55:57] it with your natural eyes
[56:00] but by faith
[56:02] your revelation
[56:04] will produce it
[56:06] the revelation in which god is given the
[56:08] bride today is beyond comprehension it
[56:12] can't be perceived in the intellect it
[56:15] has to be in the heart
[56:18] the lukewarm condition of the church is
[56:21] because there is a lack of prayer i'm
[56:23] not leaving prayer
[56:26] because i realize that's what it is
[56:32] brother say get away
[56:33] from this old lukewarm halfway
[56:36] say a little prayer of a morning a
[56:38] little prayer at night and go to bed and
[56:41] get up the next morning no wonder we're
[56:43] getting worldly
[56:45] no wonder the world's creeping into the
[56:47] church because we don't stay in prayer
[56:51] there's no more agonizing what
[56:55] lord knows we need to learn once again
[56:58] how to agonize in prayer
[57:02] no more agonizing there's no more
[57:04] staying before god
[57:06] there's no more digging out and cleaning
[57:09] up
[57:10] and that's the problem
[57:12] god can't bless the hypocrisies and the
[57:15] things that we're we're living don't
[57:17] listen i'm not here to condemn anybody
[57:19] we're trying to shine the light on sin
[57:25] and when we see ourselves don't run just
[57:28] say lord it's me
[57:30] standing in the need of prayer
[57:36] before god there's no more digging out
[57:38] cleaning up we need an old-fashioned
[57:41] revival
[57:42] we just pull
[57:44] ourselves
[57:46] we're we're with assemblies we're the
[57:48] pentecost we're the ones we're the
[57:49] trinity we're this that or the other we
[57:52] don't have nothing to do with that other
[57:54] group see see that that's it
[57:57] i keep expressing the bride is not
[57:59] denominational
[58:01] she can't be an organization she must be
[58:04] free and that me that freedom means she
[58:06] must love all
[58:08] you may not have to agree with
[58:10] everything but you got to love all
[58:14] that's where the holy spirit leaves you
[58:16] right there
[58:18] yeah when you think you're better than
[58:19] somebody else god has gone
[58:23] he's left you
[58:25] this is why so many churches are dead
[58:27] now because they think like the
[58:29] pharisees
[58:31] if you don't have this you're out of it
[58:34] and how deceived they are
[58:37] god has children everywhere
[58:41] and who are we to say who is and who is
[58:44] not
[58:45] because we don't know what the end of
[58:47] the day is going to look like
[58:50] but i know one thing he said he'll never
[58:52] lose one
[58:55] there's where the holy ghost leaves you
[58:57] right there when you get that in your
[58:59] mind brother you just might as well go
[59:02] back to the altar because that's the
[59:04] place you belong that's right amen
[59:07] that's how worldly creeps willingness
[59:09] creeps in let's forget about it let's
[59:12] put our affection on christ and look to
[59:15] christ and him alone amen having
[59:17] fellowship one with another while the
[59:20] blood of jesus christ cleanses us from
[59:23] all sin
[59:25] if he could
[59:26] if he would come to mark today every one
[59:30] of us without a fault who
[59:32] would he mark
[59:37] if you think the next man's in error
[59:40] remember the grace of god just as well
[59:42] just as real to him as it is to you
[59:46] right
[59:47] i hate
[59:48] for him to mark me today whether i was
[59:51] faultless or not i don't trust in that i
[59:54] trust
[59:55] in the grace of the lord jesus christ to
[59:59] take me through
[1:00:01] i stand in his grace alone
[1:00:04] nothing in my arms i bring i've i've
[1:00:07] done nothing i've said nothing that's
[1:00:10] worth nothing there's not a thing that
[1:00:12] i've done lord i just wholly depend on
[1:00:16] you just you and you alone
[1:00:19] sure lord and if i love you with a true
[1:00:22] heart i'll certainly love you and walk
[1:00:24] and try my best not to do nothing to
[1:00:27] hurt you and if i do anything to hurt
[1:00:30] you you're wrong i repent for it's as
[1:00:33] quick as i do as i do it
[1:00:38] see
[1:00:41] but today
[1:00:43] you can preach repentance and hell fire
[1:00:46] brimstone
[1:00:47] and people will laugh at it
[1:00:50] i mean come on we've had some tough
[1:00:52] messages here
[1:00:53] we've had some things said
[1:00:56] and you think
[1:00:57] people would repent
[1:01:00] there would be a real godly sorrow
[1:01:03] and their desperation
[1:01:06] no
[1:01:10] the matter
[1:01:11] our hearts
[1:01:12] are cold
[1:01:14] we're indifferent
[1:01:16] we got too much
[1:01:18] we need less of the world and more of
[1:01:20] god
[1:01:21] our hearts are too cold
[1:01:23] we become interested in some emotion we
[1:01:26] come interested if we can dance if we
[1:01:28] can shout i believe in it if we can
[1:01:31] speak the tongues i believe in it i
[1:01:33] believe in every bit of that but if we
[1:01:36] have that and don't have the agonizing
[1:01:39] weeping broken up spirit
[1:01:42] god could never use it
[1:01:45] them things are good but we've got to
[1:01:48] have the other to go with it
[1:01:51] we've left off the main thing and gone
[1:01:54] uh for secondarily
[1:01:56] and you can never major on a minor we
[1:02:00] know that
[1:02:01] even in our own meetings our own
[1:02:04] meetings we have too
[1:02:05] much to the to to the place there's too
[1:02:08] much on divine healing instead of
[1:02:10] healing of the soul
[1:02:12] brother what we need today is a revival
[1:02:15] of breaking up souls of
[1:02:18] on fire for god
[1:02:20] what i mean on fire is down at the altar
[1:02:23] with tears running down your cheeks not
[1:02:26] for five minutes and get up and forget
[1:02:29] but out out trying to win the loss back
[1:02:32] to christ again a burden on their heart
[1:02:40] what a joy it is
[1:02:43] and a privilege to serve god
[1:02:46] give it to these young people lord
[1:02:49] they've got an awful battle
[1:02:52] look at them
[1:02:53] look at what they've got
[1:02:55] look at their television rotten and
[1:02:57] polluted look at the nation that they're
[1:02:59] coming up in here lord politics rotten
[1:03:03] to the core antichrist arising in seats
[1:03:06] in power
[1:03:07] the world
[1:03:08] america people don't know what a
[1:03:10] struggle is they don't know how to to to
[1:03:13] to do without they never had to miss a
[1:03:16] meal oh god just look glam in hollywood
[1:03:19] and it's even got into a assembly line
[1:03:22] religion in the churches in streamline
[1:03:25] hollywood no more old-fashioned
[1:03:27] all-night prayer meetings and agonizing
[1:03:30] and praying and having fellowship around
[1:03:33] the things of god
[1:03:34] no more praying through
[1:03:36] [Music]
[1:03:38] it's true
[1:03:47] no more prayer meetings
[1:03:49] no more agonizing
[1:03:51] with god to fulfill his word
[1:03:54] see that's what we need to be doing
[1:03:56] lord i know what your words say is
[1:03:58] supposed to be in this hour
[1:04:00] and we need to just i'm talking from the
[1:04:02] pulpit to the back of the door
[1:04:04] we need to get on our knees and agonize
[1:04:07] like lord i know it's supposed to be
[1:04:10] and i'm not going to stop knocking until
[1:04:13] i see it happening
[1:04:16] no more believing the true word is still
[1:04:18] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:04:21] they just
[1:04:22] vulturize down
[1:04:25] a denomination put their names on the
[1:04:27] book got lazy and saw set back there
[1:04:30] gloating on some kind of a dead of a
[1:04:32] carrion and then supposed to be at lea
[1:04:36] least a hawk that's a similar brother to
[1:04:38] the ego the prophet that brought the
[1:04:40] word through through the word and
[1:04:43] manifested
[1:04:45] now you and i must understand that if we
[1:04:48] don't
[1:04:50] move
[1:04:51] and when i say that is that brother man
[1:04:54] preach the message on acting
[1:04:57] on the words you have heard
[1:05:00] it not just walking out and forgetting
[1:05:02] you know what you heard but
[1:05:04] and listen it's a battle
[1:05:06] you've got a lot of evil forces against
[1:05:09] you and satan don't want you to pray
[1:05:14] he'll do everything
[1:05:16] he'll let you read your bible he'll let
[1:05:18] you listen to a message tape
[1:05:20] but when it comes down to prayer
[1:05:23] he's going to fight you
[1:05:25] because he knows if you cry out to god
[1:05:28] he's going to answer
[1:05:30] and then god is going to reveal to you
[1:05:32] the things that you're lacking he's
[1:05:34] going to also reveal to you how to
[1:05:36] overcome he's going to reveal to you who
[1:05:39] you really are
[1:05:41] satan i want you to know who you really
[1:05:44] are
[1:05:47] huh
[1:05:49] we got to take our position we are the
[1:05:51] bride there is there there's no more
[1:05:53] coming after us
[1:05:57] there's no more church jesus or anything
[1:06:00] this is it
[1:06:01] somebody got to fight for it
[1:06:04] i like the way that brother said many
[1:06:06] people have died for the world
[1:06:09] all kinds of things have happened to the
[1:06:11] people before us and then we think that
[1:06:14] we've got a right to be lazy
[1:06:18] may god help us
[1:06:20] like i said i had to repent myself
[1:06:24] we've done we've got too many things in
[1:06:26] the fire the things what we need to be
[1:06:28] doing we're not doing
[1:06:30] and satan is just laughing
[1:06:32] because he thinks he's got you think
[1:06:34] thinking you're prospering
[1:06:37] no no no
[1:06:38] somebody said something to me today
[1:06:41] and i said to him i said you know my
[1:06:43] greatest concern
[1:06:45] is that i prosper in god
[1:06:48] that's what i told him i don't care
[1:06:49] about all this other stuff
[1:06:53] we need to take and i got taking a trip
[1:06:55] into the heavenlies
[1:06:57] crossing into another dimension and i
[1:06:59] guarantee you most of us don't even know
[1:07:01] what i'm talking about
[1:07:03] but i want you to understand there is a
[1:07:06] level of prayer
[1:07:08] that changes you
[1:07:11] it transports you
[1:07:15] into a place where visions break
[1:07:18] you don't believe it i said last week or
[1:07:21] the last time i spoke i spoke on that
[1:07:23] little woman who cried out lord
[1:07:26] where is your elijah
[1:07:31] and she said
[1:07:32] god spoke to her
[1:07:35] she saw him coming she says i saw you
[1:07:38] coming
[1:07:39] she had prayed so much till she entered
[1:07:42] into an another dimension of time
[1:07:46] she saw it before it happened
[1:07:49] so much so it was in detail he asked she
[1:07:52] asked him where is your little briefcase
[1:07:57] see so god is perfect folks
[1:08:00] we you say well lord i i just don't know
[1:08:03] who what tomorrow brings he brings it
[1:08:07] if we ever get to a place where we could
[1:08:09] really get down into prayer and you know
[1:08:12] put like they said you know pull the
[1:08:14] stomach back sometime
[1:08:17] it's true
[1:08:18] i never believed or understood how the
[1:08:22] the bible said that we make our bellies
[1:08:24] our god
[1:08:26] and we're it's true in this day we're
[1:08:28] more concerned about the natural foods
[1:08:30] and feeling the belly than we are
[1:08:32] concerned about the spiritual and it's
[1:08:34] true we worship it
[1:08:36] we bow to it
[1:08:41] we need to get into the shekinah this is
[1:08:43] our goal
[1:08:44] to get into the shekinah glory
[1:08:48] we're not here to stay in the courts in
[1:08:50] the church ages you know you know the
[1:08:52] candlesticks and all that that's all
[1:08:54] good but there's a higher level to this
[1:08:57] message
[1:08:58] we can't go back and preach pentecost
[1:09:01] it's already been preached
[1:09:03] the bride has a message and her message
[1:09:06] is to go forward to enter into the veil
[1:09:09] amen
[1:09:11] and the entering into the veil you must
[1:09:14] bring you know how can i say wear the
[1:09:16] garment of a priest
[1:09:18] and the garment of the priest is jesus
[1:09:20] christ himself
[1:09:22] put on the whole arm of god
[1:09:25] is that right
[1:09:27] add your faith virtue that's it
[1:09:31] oh no one clean will be able to go back
[1:09:33] there
[1:09:34] unless you're covered by the blood
[1:09:37] he said but once he once walked
[1:09:40] into the holies of holies
[1:09:43] walked into the presence of god and the
[1:09:45] veil falls behind him there's a part of
[1:09:48] a manner where he can eat every day
[1:09:52] every hour of the week
[1:09:54] in other words you never run out of
[1:09:56] revelation god is always breaking good
[1:09:58] stuff to you you're feasting on foods
[1:10:01] that nobody else is feasting on
[1:10:04] that's why you when god gives you a
[1:10:06] great revelation sometimes you say you
[1:10:08] try to show up with a brother he can't
[1:10:09] understand what you see
[1:10:12] he's not in that position to see it
[1:10:16] god is taking you to another another
[1:10:17] level
[1:10:19] let's not back up it's time to go
[1:10:21] forward
[1:10:23] help us jesus
[1:10:24] we need to take our position by our
[1:10:27] husband the bible said the bride has
[1:10:30] made his wife has made herself ready
[1:10:34] amen
[1:10:35] amen
[1:10:38] a royal priesthood
[1:10:42] the word stands for you
[1:10:45] you need to stand for the word
[1:10:48] the word speaks your existence
[1:10:51] before you even were born the word had
[1:10:53] already been written and spoken
[1:10:57] now it's up to you to take that letter
[1:10:59] of the word and eat it
[1:11:01] that you and that word and that prophecy
[1:11:04] will become real that's why i said the
[1:11:06] spirit of jesus christ is the spirit of
[1:11:08] prophecy he prophesied about you
[1:11:12] and we're here to be manifested as a
[1:11:15] living word of god that's been spoken
[1:11:18] thousands of years ago we have arrived
[1:11:22] satan knows it
[1:11:25] and he's doing everything he can to stop
[1:11:27] you
[1:11:29] don't feel bad you're not by yourself
[1:11:32] all of us have our particular battles
[1:11:35] but those battles are to hold you to
[1:11:38] keep you tied like a dog
[1:11:40] but god has broken the chain
[1:11:50] gold that you can eat every day every
[1:11:51] hour of the week that's where he's
[1:11:53] living in this kind of glory we're in
[1:11:54] the interlocked wings of the cherubims
[1:11:57] the great pillar of fire and the
[1:11:59] shekinah rest there and he's living
[1:12:02] under there he can he can't be nothing
[1:12:05] but a real genuine christian anytime and
[1:12:08] he said because of the atmosphere
[1:12:12] now the atmosphere is not behind the
[1:12:14] curtain
[1:12:16] the atmosphere is in you
[1:12:19] you the carrier of the atmosphere god in
[1:12:23] you what the hope of glory
[1:12:26] people this is where he's bringing us i
[1:12:28] know it sounds fictitious or it sounds
[1:12:31] hard to believe but you don't have the
[1:12:33] reason that you don't have to try to
[1:12:34] figure it out just take it it says lord
[1:12:37] that's me
[1:12:38] let that word be expressed in me
[1:12:43] clean me oh god
[1:12:46] wash me clean
[1:12:48] prepare me
[1:12:50] fashion me
[1:12:52] into your image lord
[1:12:54] men and women who lives there are
[1:12:56] misunderstood you see
[1:12:58] they become peculiar
[1:13:00] they don't hear the things of the world
[1:13:02] or if they do they don't pay attention
[1:13:04] to them
[1:13:06] they just move on
[1:13:08] god never put that in there for nothing
[1:13:11] god never come for just
[1:13:14] any haphazard way
[1:13:16] prayer is not perhaps prayer is sincere
[1:13:20] thing
[1:13:20] prayer is talking to god prayer is not
[1:13:24] get up get down and shut your eyes and
[1:13:26] think about your washing or your work
[1:13:28] you're doing say lord help me and john
[1:13:31] and heal miss jones and so forth that's
[1:13:34] not prayer
[1:13:37] that's repeating some words
[1:13:40] but prayer is to come into an atmosphere
[1:13:46] where you realize that you're in the
[1:13:48] presence of god
[1:13:50] and you're moving to then in the deepest
[1:13:53] of sincerity
[1:13:55] first it's a worship oh jehovah how i
[1:13:59] love you
[1:14:00] you see it
[1:14:01] then after the worship of prayer then
[1:14:04] you come with a sincere heart asking
[1:14:08] if you abide in me not go out from
[1:14:11] behind the curtain in the world today
[1:14:13] and run around and try to get back in
[1:14:16] the curtain tonight
[1:14:17] if you abide in me and my word about in
[1:14:20] you otherwise if you like aaron's rod
[1:14:22] that pull up to the shekinah glory by
[1:14:25] the golden part of the manna where you
[1:14:27] can eat it anytime and your soul is
[1:14:30] refreshed
[1:14:31] and blooming and yielding abiding if you
[1:14:35] abide in me my words abiding you then
[1:14:38] ask what you will and it will be given
[1:14:41] to you
[1:14:42] you see
[1:14:44] the failures of the church the
[1:14:45] pentecostals the methodists the baptists
[1:14:48] and all
[1:14:49] it's a failing
[1:14:51] to that abiding grace of god
[1:14:54] tonight you shout and clap your hands
[1:14:57] and dance in the aisle and speak in
[1:14:58] tongues that's gifts
[1:15:01] gifts is no good unless you're abiding
[1:15:04] in the shekinah glory
[1:15:07] these things are fine i have nothing to
[1:15:10] say against them they're of god shouting
[1:15:12] and blessings god in wonderful speaking
[1:15:15] in tongues and translation of tongues oh
[1:15:18] i mean interpretation of tongues it's
[1:15:20] the same and all these other things
[1:15:22] gifts of healing and prophecies and all
[1:15:25] these things are marvelous but they're
[1:15:27] no good they're not fruitful they can't
[1:15:30] hear the right unless you're living in
[1:15:33] the presence of the shekinah
[1:15:35] the atmosphere
[1:15:37] around you is godly
[1:15:40] that's the reason that men and women are
[1:15:43] not permitted to lead to these things
[1:15:46] because you go out here and call a
[1:15:48] blessing over something god is cursed or
[1:15:51] you curse something god is blessed it's
[1:15:53] abiding presence to know the will of god
[1:15:59] then don't look what the world's doing
[1:16:02] to say about you is what gods think
[1:16:04] about you then you're living in the
[1:16:06] presence
[1:16:10] the problem is we're not harming for the
[1:16:12] supernatural
[1:16:16] you know why because the teachers told
[1:16:18] us we didn't have to have all of that
[1:16:20] oh it's just the word is it the word
[1:16:22] well the word is not a thing
[1:16:24] the word is the person
[1:16:26] and that person is jesus christ himself
[1:16:28] and he's alive and well and he's still
[1:16:31] living doing the same thing did
[1:16:33] yesterday today and forever he's a
[1:16:35] healer he's a deliverer hallelujah he's
[1:16:38] a friend above all others
[1:16:41] he's a living god
[1:16:43] he's a creator of all things the bible
[1:16:45] said without him nothing was made he's
[1:16:48] still god
[1:16:50] and if you're talking about the word
[1:16:52] it's not just the letter of the word
[1:16:54] it's the living word and guess what if
[1:16:56] the word is living he's living in you
[1:17:00] that's where he want we want him to live
[1:17:02] in this tabernacle that he built for
[1:17:05] himself
[1:17:06] hallelujah is that all right
[1:17:10] we we're all hungry for hungry for
[1:17:12] supernatural you methodist brothers are
[1:17:14] hungry for for supernatural i got a
[1:17:17] method speeches within me that's
[1:17:19] hungering and thirsting for the
[1:17:20] supernatural you baptists are hungering
[1:17:22] and thirsting for supernatural all of
[1:17:24] them are now surely if god is still god
[1:17:27] he's still
[1:17:28] supernatural
[1:17:30] don't you believe that
[1:17:32] he's got to be
[1:17:34] he's got to be
[1:17:36] huh
[1:17:37] and you know where we failed
[1:17:39] we let people educate the message to us
[1:17:43] took us away from the dynamics
[1:17:45] gave us all nothing wrong with being
[1:17:48] educated in the message
[1:17:49] but you you we failed because we left
[1:17:51] the dynamics away and we say that was
[1:17:54] pentecostal hello
[1:17:56] you're pentecostal
[1:17:58] if you really born again and if you
[1:18:01] really got the holy ghost you're what we
[1:18:03] call pentecostal
[1:18:06] but pentecostal didn't just come with
[1:18:08] all of the the little gifts the greatest
[1:18:10] thing that the pentecostals had was the
[1:18:12] life of jesus on the inside
[1:18:15] that's why they were called christians
[1:18:18] it was the life that the people saw in
[1:18:20] them
[1:18:24] peter couldn't even sign his own name
[1:18:28] and he had the keys of the kingdom of
[1:18:29] god given to him by jesus christ he
[1:18:32] didn't have a doctrine of divinity
[1:18:34] he wasn't part of the the pharisees and
[1:18:37] the sadducees
[1:18:39] but i tell you what he had the greatest
[1:18:41] degree anybody could have
[1:18:43] hallelujah and he got that degree from
[1:18:47] the the university
[1:18:49] of jesus christ
[1:18:55] don't you understand every true believer
[1:18:57] walked down the aisle as magnum
[1:18:59] laude
[1:19:02] hallelujah straight ain't perfect
[1:19:07] we're looking to education he said
[1:19:09] education is fine but that's taught in
[1:19:12] school houses the church is the place to
[1:19:14] know god and learn of god
[1:19:16] in the supernatural
[1:19:20] what
[1:19:21] he said the church
[1:19:25] is a place to know god
[1:19:28] and to learn of god
[1:19:30] and
[1:19:31] in the supernatural
[1:19:34] that means supernatural is supposed to
[1:19:38] be happening in the church
[1:19:41] that's how we learn
[1:19:46] you heard brother brother stephen
[1:19:50] they were learning
[1:19:51] they were like children
[1:19:53] pray for peter
[1:19:55] but in their minds they thought peter
[1:19:57] was going to die
[1:19:59] but they learned
[1:20:01] they prayed for deliverance
[1:20:04] god dispatched an angel
[1:20:06] and if you read the scripture the bible
[1:20:08] said all of the prison doors were open
[1:20:11] you see why because the people were
[1:20:14] praying
[1:20:18] see that's why jesus you know you they
[1:20:20] always say jesus had to call lazarus by
[1:20:22] name because if he had not called larger
[1:20:25] by his name all of them would have
[1:20:26] gotten up
[1:20:29] and that's how it is they were praying
[1:20:31] and praying and god i can almost say
[1:20:33] lord unlock the door unlock the door
[1:20:35] what and god said okay he locked them
[1:20:37] out unlocked them all
[1:20:41] but they did not even know at the time
[1:20:44] the power of prayer just like the people
[1:20:47] in this message we don't know the power
[1:20:50] of prayer and i guarantee you we'll
[1:20:53] 99 of us will pass uh fail the test
[1:20:57] if we ask the question
[1:21:00] when you last prayed an hour
[1:21:06] and i'm not talking about struggling i
[1:21:08] mean caught up
[1:21:10] into a different atmosphere
[1:21:13] to wearing that you knew you were in the
[1:21:15] prayer in the presence of god
[1:21:18] hello
[1:21:20] they're rare
[1:21:22] but they shouldn't be rare
[1:21:25] this should be our daily bread
[1:21:28] talking to the lord jesus christ every
[1:21:30] day
[1:21:34] god help us the church is the place to
[1:21:36] know god and learn of god in in and
[1:21:39] that's what's and to learn of him in the
[1:21:40] news this is what he said in the
[1:21:41] supernatural and god is the supernatural
[1:21:45] and the same yesterday today and forever
[1:21:49] huh
[1:21:50] and then when we began to preach on
[1:21:52] listen listen
[1:21:53] you got to feel like i feel i am so
[1:21:57] tired
[1:21:59] of sicknesses
[1:22:03] diseases
[1:22:05] things that the early church dispelled
[1:22:07] by the power in the in the name of jesus
[1:22:10] christ
[1:22:11] they had a revelation or faith
[1:22:16] it worked
[1:22:18] and if it worked for them it'll work for
[1:22:20] us
[1:22:22] but you know what one thing about them
[1:22:25] they didn't have this
[1:22:28] the only thing they had was the living
[1:22:30] god on the inside
[1:22:32] we don't even know how many people read
[1:22:35] those letters from paul peter james or
[1:22:37] john
[1:22:39] we don't know we don't know how long it
[1:22:42] took to circulate the churches
[1:22:44] but one thing for certain
[1:22:46] when the holy ghost came
[1:22:49] he was recognized
[1:22:53] and it was the holy ghost that taught
[1:22:55] them is that the bible the bible said he
[1:22:58] will lead and guide you into all truth
[1:23:02] amen not bishop a pastor or reverend
[1:23:05] he
[1:23:07] the holy spirit
[1:23:08] sometimes we fail to just say lord what
[1:23:11] does that mean
[1:23:13] he's there to give you understanding
[1:23:17] sometimes i can tell you something may
[1:23:18] not be right
[1:23:20] my intentions wouldn't be that to do
[1:23:22] that but
[1:23:23] god will go and tell you the truth
[1:23:27] have you read the bible says lord
[1:23:29] where's that scripture
[1:23:31] where is that scripture lord i can't
[1:23:32] find it i know it's here somewhere and
[1:23:34] god just bring it to you
[1:23:39] i have incidents like that all the time
[1:23:40] i can't find something i just
[1:23:42] pray inside says lord where is it
[1:23:45] and he shows me listen to what i'm going
[1:23:48] to say here now this is just a quote
[1:23:50] from brother branham but i'm going to
[1:23:51] read it this is history as well
[1:23:54] he said i was reading here
[1:23:56] i believe it was charles g finney
[1:24:00] one of the greatest evangelists of the
[1:24:01] day and a converted lawyer
[1:24:05] there was an old man dying with tb
[1:24:08] y'all know what that means tuberculosis
[1:24:11] and before he died he laid on his face
[1:24:14] crying and praying
[1:24:17] and he raised up
[1:24:18] and he said well
[1:24:20] i was able to pray the prayer of faith
[1:24:23] for a certain city
[1:24:25] god's going to give a revival in that
[1:24:28] city
[1:24:29] and he narrowed it down about 15
[1:24:31] different cities
[1:24:33] and after that man was dead and gone
[1:24:36] finicum
[1:24:38] by
[1:24:38] to his widow
[1:24:40] and picked up those cities
[1:24:42] and those revivals come just exactly the
[1:24:45] way that man said why
[1:24:49] is the question
[1:24:51] because one
[1:24:53] agonizing soul
[1:24:55] one soul before god in sincerity done
[1:24:59] more to bring revival than all the
[1:25:01] schools there was in the world
[1:25:04] that's right one soul prayed through
[1:25:11] and of you
[1:25:13] i'll tell you the greatest eastern
[1:25:15] revival of many years ago when
[1:25:18] uh when in africa
[1:25:20] when those heartened tots and so forth
[1:25:23] over there when they had a revival the
[1:25:26] very reason of it never come from their
[1:25:28] teachings
[1:25:29] in their big schools
[1:25:31] one poor illiterate unlearned colored
[1:25:34] man
[1:25:35] back in a little old haunt
[1:25:37] back there hut back there
[1:25:39] laid on his face day and night in the
[1:25:43] dust prayed to god sent a revival that
[1:25:46] swept all eastern and northern africa in
[1:25:50] the kingdom of god
[1:25:51] one
[1:25:53] may god help us
[1:25:55] and they had a revival there my water
[1:25:58] revival
[1:25:59] see people look at finney
[1:26:01] but they don't understand what it what
[1:26:03] happened before finney came
[1:26:06] right
[1:26:08] see there's going to be so many people
[1:26:10] and so many great ones i put this way
[1:26:13] rewards for those whose names you never
[1:26:16] would have known
[1:26:18] one written in the books
[1:26:20] wasn't written on history uh tablets
[1:26:24] but they prayed through for things to
[1:26:26] happen
[1:26:27] help us jesus see i don't know about you
[1:26:30] but that's the kind i want to be
[1:26:31] may god grant me the grace
[1:26:34] may god grant me the grace i'm not going
[1:26:36] to stop folks
[1:26:40] i see the way things are and and it
[1:26:42] tears me up
[1:26:44] you know i look even my own life and i'm
[1:26:46] like no this is not the way it should be
[1:26:50] i want more
[1:26:51] i got to have more of him
[1:26:54] but i know that the key is now
[1:26:57] it's always been there but you know what
[1:26:59] when god quickens something to you
[1:27:01] that's when it becomes real
[1:27:04] and the thing that gives me is that i
[1:27:06] don't need a bunch of folks i don't need
[1:27:09] a group
[1:27:10] one man
[1:27:12] one
[1:27:18] remember the time brother branham talks
[1:27:19] about those sisters behind the curtain
[1:27:23] those sisters that were praying behind
[1:27:24] the curtains he said that's the reason
[1:27:26] my meetings have been so successful
[1:27:29] he didn't even call their names
[1:27:32] but they were the ones praying
[1:27:35] you see what i'm saying it's not about
[1:27:37] self-recognition
[1:27:39] it's you in your closet
[1:27:41] you and god
[1:27:43] letting god use you for the purpose of
[1:27:46] today
[1:27:47] oh my god so be it
[1:27:51] what a revival
[1:27:53] what a
[1:27:54] ruin see and they had a revival there my
[1:27:57] what a revival but what ruined them
[1:28:01] what ruined them
[1:28:04] what happened
[1:28:05] to this message that used to be so on
[1:28:07] fire
[1:28:09] what ruined them i'm going to tell you
[1:28:13] he said then the teachers came down from
[1:28:15] england
[1:28:17] in different ways and began to set up in
[1:28:20] there began to teach theology and get
[1:28:22] away from the power of god and things
[1:28:24] like that and then the whole thing went
[1:28:27] into chaos and that's just exactly what
[1:28:31] happened in the united states of america
[1:28:42] help us jesus
[1:28:46] it ain't teaching
[1:28:48] paul said i came with the power and
[1:28:50] demonstration of the holy ghost
[1:28:53] some things are good to know
[1:28:55] but god ain't going to ask you what you
[1:28:57] learned
[1:29:01] what did those disciples ask john
[1:29:02] disciples
[1:29:03] have you received the holy ghost since
[1:29:05] you believed
[1:29:09] the people get away from god
[1:29:12] but god remains the same
[1:29:14] his nature his power his desires is
[1:29:17] always the same through every generation
[1:29:20] it never changes this is brother
[1:29:23] it's always the same it's the people
[1:29:25] that get away from god and not god from
[1:29:27] the people
[1:29:29] they lose their faith
[1:29:30] god covers all space all everywhere he's
[1:29:34] omnipotent he's everywhere and he's
[1:29:36] always has been and everywhere and he
[1:29:39] always will be everywhere but it's the
[1:29:41] aptitude of the people that brings the
[1:29:44] results
[1:29:45] that's the reason at pentecost they had
[1:29:47] to go to an upper room and pray until
[1:29:50] the holy ghost came because they got in
[1:29:52] one place and one accord is the
[1:29:54] atmosphere that what brings the results
[1:29:57] you believe that
[1:29:59] let every man and woman in the building
[1:30:01] this morning boy and girl everything
[1:30:03] from their minds but uh excuse me
[1:30:07] get everything from their minds but the
[1:30:09] lord jesus
[1:30:10] and believe that he's standing present
[1:30:13] right now and you'll see something
[1:30:15] happen that'll cause headlines in the
[1:30:17] newspaper in the morning he said that's
[1:30:21] right
[1:30:22] it's the atmosphere
[1:30:26] help us jesus oh i don't know whether
[1:30:28] you feel him tonight
[1:30:30] but he's all up here
[1:30:33] it is the atmosphere that brings the
[1:30:35] miraculous
[1:30:36] you understand me we must stand as his
[1:30:39] wife
[1:30:40] who else
[1:30:41] he's rejected
[1:30:45] vastly
[1:30:46] the organizational system they didn't
[1:30:48] want him
[1:30:50] now he's looking
[1:30:52] for somebody to worship him in spirit
[1:30:54] and truth
[1:30:57] he said it's the atmosphere if you want
[1:30:59] to know where i'm getting these messages
[1:31:01] just let me know it's the atmosphere
[1:31:02] that brings the miraculous
[1:31:04] and wonders
[1:31:06] and the power of god among the people
[1:31:08] it's the atmosphere of the people and
[1:31:10] when people get into a place they're
[1:31:12] reasoning and wondering and stewing and
[1:31:15] thinking and all tore up and don't know
[1:31:17] where they they do they do stand half of
[1:31:20] them not even spiritually taught how can
[1:31:23] you expect the atmosphere to be right
[1:31:26] you can't do it it won't be right it's
[1:31:29] got to be in one court one accord one
[1:31:31] place and settle down with one motive
[1:31:33] one thing then you're going to see
[1:31:35] something happen
[1:31:37] see even in this little church
[1:31:39] a friend of mine from florida called me
[1:31:42] he couldn't find a message church to go
[1:31:44] to
[1:31:44] so he's going to this baptist church but
[1:31:47] the atmosphere
[1:31:49] the anointing of god in this little
[1:31:51] fellowship
[1:31:52] and
[1:31:53] i don't know whether it connected to any
[1:31:54] other
[1:31:55] atmosphere but they just saw cancer
[1:31:58] instantly heal
[1:32:00] they saw this man heart who was uh in
[1:32:03] bad shape they were getting ready to do
[1:32:04] an operation the doctors thought to to
[1:32:07] look at it again and when he looked at
[1:32:09] it again there was no evidence the man
[1:32:11] had ever been sick
[1:32:13] see you got to understand it this thing
[1:32:16] is not local
[1:32:18] it's not just in this little place it's
[1:32:20] everywhere
[1:32:23] that's all god looking for
[1:32:26] people say
[1:32:28] do they have the holy ghost well that
[1:32:30] surely ain't the devil
[1:32:34] you understand me
[1:32:37] do you know god was giving people the
[1:32:38] holy ghost even when they was under the
[1:32:40] trinitarian doctrine
[1:32:44] brother random got it then that's when
[1:32:46] he got it
[1:32:51] and those assemblies or whatever their
[1:32:53] names were they were trinitarians but
[1:32:55] they believed god
[1:32:57] they saw him as his savior and god gave
[1:33:00] them the holy ghost
[1:33:02] see don't even come there because you
[1:33:03] trying to tell me that they got a
[1:33:04] different one no they didn't
[1:33:06] they got the same one the bible said
[1:33:08] they would get
[1:33:09] the sad thing about it is they didn't go
[1:33:12] further
[1:33:14] they didn't go all the way
[1:33:16] it was the same anointing is that not
[1:33:18] right that's what prophet god said
[1:33:23] and that true holy ghost amen that was
[1:33:26] real to those people eventually brought
[1:33:28] them to the baptism of the name in the
[1:33:30] name of the lord jesus christ
[1:33:34] what about those people who's never
[1:33:36] heard of that yet but yet they got the
[1:33:37] holy ghost and they living right
[1:33:40] see you don't you know what i'm saying
[1:33:43] you say that can't be true yes it is
[1:33:46] cornelius house got the holy ghost
[1:33:48] before they were even baptized
[1:33:55] the holy ghost is your condition
[1:33:57] of your heart
[1:34:01] i know that's against the message what
[1:34:03] people might think but i don't care what
[1:34:04] they think the truth is truth
[1:34:08] you can't tell me i wouldn't say before
[1:34:10] i got here
[1:34:12] i was saved
[1:34:13] i didn't know all of the truth like i
[1:34:15] know now
[1:34:16] but i met jesus
[1:34:22] you can't take that from me
[1:34:24] how are you going to take it take it
[1:34:25] from me you got to take away every
[1:34:26] experience brother branham had before he
[1:34:28] understood who he was
[1:34:32] the truth of the matter is those who
[1:34:34] were seed came forth
[1:34:36] those who were shocked stayed behind
[1:34:39] but you can't tell me that the life of
[1:34:41] the seed was not was never in the shock
[1:34:44] because the life of the shuck was the
[1:34:46] holy ghost
[1:34:48] hello but they had no idea that life was
[1:34:50] going to lead them
[1:34:53] eh
[1:34:53] right it's the truth it was ordained for
[1:34:56] it to leave and to form into the seed
[1:34:59] that's what brother brown was trying to
[1:35:01] tell them you're not the finish line
[1:35:03] there's another that you got to go
[1:35:05] further
[1:35:06] the word that's being preached this is
[1:35:08] what makes the message different it must
[1:35:11] be preached to the seed in order for us
[1:35:14] to grow
[1:35:15] into the very image and likeness of god
[1:35:17] we're not shocked
[1:35:19] we've come out from that
[1:35:21] it was good while it was there it
[1:35:25] preserved us
[1:35:27] but we moved into another dimension
[1:35:30] or a dispensation however you want to
[1:35:32] say it
[1:35:34] any person that ever come into that
[1:35:36] atmosphere
[1:35:38] one time will never be satisfied nowhere
[1:35:41] else i'm gonna ask you something because
[1:35:43] a lot of times we sit back like
[1:35:45] pharisees and sadducees and think god
[1:35:47] can't use nobody but us but what about
[1:35:49] that woman who came to wash jesus feet
[1:35:52] in the midst of the pharisees and the
[1:35:53] sadducees they didn't even know what was
[1:35:55] going on but jesus understood she had
[1:35:57] been she was being led by the holy
[1:36:00] spirit
[1:36:04] she was that's what it was
[1:36:10] now she makes history
[1:36:15] a prostitute
[1:36:17] unconverted
[1:36:19] but she had god dealing with her
[1:36:22] that's all i'm saying we want to put god
[1:36:25] in a box you cannot put god in a box
[1:36:36] and ben any person that ever come into
[1:36:38] the atmosphere one time would never be
[1:36:41] satisfied nowhere else before i even
[1:36:43] knew god as as a creator i saw god
[1:36:46] create
[1:36:47] nobody can take that from me now
[1:36:50] let's put it this way i don't know where
[1:36:51] the corn came from but i asked the
[1:36:54] people around if they drop it they did
[1:36:56] not i saw it came out of a corner come
[1:36:58] round and spin around in me and laid
[1:37:00] right there in front of me because i
[1:37:02] needed some change
[1:37:04] to call somebody
[1:37:05] i was still in pentecost
[1:37:09] one day i was walking up the road i was
[1:37:11] late for church god says that morning he
[1:37:14] told me i'm gonna bless you with some
[1:37:15] money and i look for the mailman to
[1:37:17] bring it i'll look for a friend to bring
[1:37:19] it and not even a block from the church
[1:37:23] it had rain
[1:37:24] and as i was walking up the sidewalk god
[1:37:27] said look down and god had made that
[1:37:29] money stay
[1:37:31] fold it up
[1:37:34] by the rain
[1:37:36] that look at me like crazy it's the
[1:37:38] truth i got to stand before god
[1:37:43] i remember the time i
[1:37:45] told my wife i was going to get some
[1:37:47] money now these are cardinal things
[1:37:52] get spiritual
[1:37:55] now she may not remember this she said
[1:37:57] but yeah you know the income tax i said
[1:37:59] no no no it's going to be from somewhere
[1:38:02] else
[1:38:03] i didn't know
[1:38:05] i still don't know who this person was
[1:38:08] they sent me a check in the mail that
[1:38:11] day i looked in the mailbox it was a
[1:38:13] check from somebody i didn't even know
[1:38:15] she said i was in one of your meetings
[1:38:17] and you blessed me and god put it on my
[1:38:18] heart to send you five hundred dollars
[1:38:22] this is truth
[1:38:26] what i'm trying to say these little
[1:38:28] things and sometimes even in my trials
[1:38:31] even in my
[1:38:32] times where i i allowed satan to to dumb
[1:38:36] my eyes i forget what god has already
[1:38:39] done
[1:38:41] but everybody in here should have a
[1:38:42] testimony or something i know god has
[1:38:45] done some supernatural and though they
[1:38:47] be small think about all the great
[1:38:49] things or greater things he can do for
[1:38:51] you
[1:38:52] we need to just put the devil in his
[1:38:54] place
[1:38:56] and we need to learn how to stand in our
[1:38:58] place
[1:38:59] we need to stop letting satan come in
[1:39:01] here with sicknesses
[1:39:03] and walking out here like he's going to
[1:39:05] be victorious we somebody and i i'm one
[1:39:08] of them i'm going to pray
[1:39:10] i believe this word
[1:39:13] and i'm gonna contact god and i'm gonna
[1:39:15] see
[1:39:16] yeah
[1:39:17] you can join with me
[1:39:19] i mean in your own room because i'm
[1:39:20] gonna listen i know the devil listening
[1:39:22] but i'm not afraid of him i'm ordained
[1:39:24] bride so are you
[1:39:27] and nothing can stop us
[1:39:29] but our own unbelief
[1:39:34] that men and women in their work
[1:39:36] wherever they make should be should
[1:39:38] continue to continually desire and they
[1:39:41] will if they ever once come into that
[1:39:44] atmosphere
[1:39:45] he says if you once get in there you'll
[1:39:47] never want to get out
[1:39:49] you always thirst for it until you come
[1:39:51] again
[1:39:53] right but this time he says no you go in
[1:39:56] there and close the door
[1:39:57] don't come back out
[1:40:00] but if we could get a group together a
[1:40:02] group of people together where was
[1:40:04] genuine holy ghost atmosphere
[1:40:07] a sacredness and a sincerity and worship
[1:40:11] and men and women sitting in there
[1:40:13] are god conscious and know that great
[1:40:16] omnipotent of god is present ready to do
[1:40:19] all things without one shadow of doubt
[1:40:22] it'll even have an effect upon
[1:40:24] unbelievers that's setting in this
[1:40:25] evening you can never come into that
[1:40:28] atmosphere without something happening
[1:40:32] hmm
[1:40:36] god is good
[1:40:40] and i'm gonna close
[1:40:42] divine healing and sanctification and
[1:40:45] the power of god is as long as your
[1:40:48] faith last in it
[1:40:52] i'm gonna say it again
[1:40:55] divine healing
[1:40:57] sanctification
[1:41:00] and the power of god
[1:41:02] is as long as your faith lasts in it
[1:41:07] when your faith fails
[1:41:09] then your experience is gone
[1:41:12] it's based
[1:41:14] that way simply upon the finished work
[1:41:17] of christ at calvary
[1:41:19] you're sanctified as long as your
[1:41:21] testimony is right
[1:41:22] as long as you live a sanctified life
[1:41:25] and believe that god sanctified you
[1:41:27] you're sanctified
[1:41:29] counted it all to his grace and his
[1:41:32] merits and as long as you've accepted
[1:41:34] healing and believing your healing and
[1:41:37] go on believing it like that you'll be
[1:41:40] healed as long as you believe it
[1:41:43] and you start doubting it
[1:41:45] you take a man sitting here this morning
[1:41:48] that's not a bit sick and let him begin
[1:41:50] to get in his heart believing he is sick
[1:41:53] they'll pack him out of the building as
[1:41:56] your faith is so be it unto you
[1:42:02] as your faith is
[1:42:09] there's so much i i overdo things when
[1:42:12] i'm studying sorry about that but you
[1:42:14] know i look at this thing and i think to
[1:42:16] myself
[1:42:18] we can no longer
[1:42:23] wherever we are i don't know where you
[1:42:24] are you know
[1:42:26] some of us we may be in different places
[1:42:29] some in the outer court suddenly in the
[1:42:31] court
[1:42:32] some is in the holies of holies
[1:42:35] but wherever you are if you're not in
[1:42:36] the holies of holies don't stop
[1:42:41] you know those who are in the holy
[1:42:43] holies is the only one that makes the
[1:42:44] rapture right
[1:42:46] let me say that again
[1:42:52] i'm trying to think of the message i
[1:42:53] just finished listening to
[1:42:58] sea should not be aired with the shock
[1:43:02] brother adam tells us those who would
[1:43:04] make the rapture
[1:43:09] and those of us who get into the holies
[1:43:11] of holies
[1:43:13] you'll make the rapture
[1:43:15] and those of us who do not
[1:43:18] will be seen
[1:43:20] standing before the white throne
[1:43:21] judgment
[1:43:23] but they don't preach it like that
[1:43:26] they don't tell you go listen to the
[1:43:28] message
[1:43:29] see if i tell you the truth which i do
[1:43:32] but go listen to it
[1:43:34] it's not that you're not saved we're
[1:43:36] talking about a rapture
[1:43:39] we're talking about a perfect seed of
[1:43:42] god
[1:43:43] coming to maturity
[1:43:47] you know we handle it like it's a
[1:43:50] denomination or organizations once they
[1:43:52] come into the message they make it no
[1:43:55] they make it they may be saved and you
[1:43:57] know but
[1:43:59] making a rapture is two different things
[1:44:04] the holy ghost no doubt is in all of us
[1:44:09] but it must grow into a mature statue
[1:44:13] we must come to a perfect christ
[1:44:16] and these things come through trials and
[1:44:18] tribulations being tried in the fire
[1:44:22] it doesn't matter how good i can preach
[1:44:25] sing whatever i can do all those gifts
[1:44:28] are good but i still i've got to get
[1:44:30] there
[1:44:32] in order to make a rapture
[1:44:36] knowing brother branham that's fine
[1:44:39] but what did the angels say when john
[1:44:41] failed no no no get up
[1:44:43] worship god
[1:44:45] we come to worship god
[1:44:48] and the god that we worship
[1:44:50] is the god that lives in us
[1:44:52] you love the lord
[1:44:56] let's stand
[1:45:02] what i'm trying to say
[1:45:04] let me say it like this
[1:45:06] we are so far behind
[1:45:08] don't you know if god wanted to leave
[1:45:10] you
[1:45:12] he could have done it long time ago
[1:45:16] he's not saying oh
[1:45:18] i'm just not going to let you have this
[1:45:20] no no no
[1:45:21] [Music]
[1:45:22] at the end of the day
[1:45:24] it's going to boil down to your choosing
[1:45:27] your choice
[1:45:29] and how
[1:45:31] horrifying is going to be if we have
[1:45:33] heard the word
[1:45:36] and yet not become doers of it
[1:45:39] and god is not a tease as you hear me
[1:45:41] say you know you can have this and you
[1:45:43] you know you reach for it and i snatch
[1:45:45] it back that's not god
[1:45:49] but god is expecting determination
[1:45:51] perseverance
[1:45:54] look at it
[1:45:56] the woman with the issue of blood
[1:45:57] perseverance
[1:46:00] rahab perseverance
[1:46:03] you got to push
[1:46:04] you got to fight
[1:46:06] you got to deny yourself
[1:46:08] at every cost in every way and the only
[1:46:12] way we can do that is that like our
[1:46:14] brother said which which was a scripture
[1:46:16] that i've always been using i've been
[1:46:18] using
[1:46:19] acknowledge the lord in all your ways
[1:46:21] and he shall direct your path
[1:46:24] and that's what we fail we fail
[1:46:27] to acknowledge the lord in all our ways
[1:46:30] and this is why we come up with our own
[1:46:32] reasoning and our own thoughts and those
[1:46:34] things always get us in trouble
[1:46:37] i'm a
[1:46:38] witness a witness
[1:46:42] people the word of god came tonight not
[1:46:44] to badger you or to make you feel bad
[1:46:46] this is not what it's all about it came
[1:46:50] to enlighten
[1:46:51] and to encourage
[1:46:55] all of us
[1:46:56] wake up
[1:46:59] let's see what god is called don't you i
[1:47:01] do not want to come short
[1:47:04] of what his purpose is for me
[1:47:07] [Music]
[1:47:08] i truly believe that god has ordained me
[1:47:10] to be bride
[1:47:12] you must believe that too
[1:47:14] and if you do believe that
[1:47:16] say lord give me grace to be about your
[1:47:18] business
[1:47:20] let me die out let me rot whatever i
[1:47:23] need to do
[1:47:25] to to get to that place where you can
[1:47:27] say
[1:47:28] well done
[1:47:28] [Music]
[1:47:31] that's what we want
[1:47:33] if that old woman amen who didn't even
[1:47:35] know brother branham existed could
[1:47:37] contact god by prayer
[1:47:40] those heartentarts or that who are hot
[1:47:42] and taught in africa prayed until god
[1:47:45] brought a revival
[1:47:47] raised up a man
[1:47:50] what about us
[1:47:55] you pray for me and i'll pray for you
[1:47:59] let's pray now
[1:48:01] our heavenly father

[1:48:05] mercy

[1:48:24] you came to give us life
[1:48:26] and more abundantly
[1:48:28] and the preaching of the word has come
