me 64 verse 6 Isaiah 64 verse so we thank the Lord for the reading of the word I'm just glad Jesus is all you need amen I can't think of anybody there's nobody else I can't think of anyone that you need more than the Lord Jesus Christ praise His holy name I want to speak to you this morning the Lord helping us upon God's favor I actually had a different direction I was going to go and just a little bit ago my main boss told me no go this way instead he speaks we listen that's the way it works but we are all as an unclean thing and all of our righteousnesses plural are as filthy rags we do all fade as a leaf and our iniquities Like the Wind have taken us away the word that he uses here for unclean means to be impure both ethically and religiously when you say ethically you mean by morality no matter how clean a person may think they are all of us are born off the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil have you ever noticed that with people no matter how bad they might be there's always a little bit of good somewhere in there the worst people on the planet just out of nowhere by surprise do some little good thing on the other side those that are good no matter how good they are there's always some little dirty thing hiding in there somewhere now that's how we came to this world we cannot Escape that part that will be with us until the body change that's right Rapture or Resurrection either one only the new birth can overcome that that's why people that have not received the Holy Ghost and they start tipping the scales toward being good good good good good good good this is why Isaiah said no matter how good you think you are all of your goodness is like filthy rags in the sight of God now if you want to know how dirty that is filthy rag in the Old Testament was the language they use for a woman's monthly garment through the menstrual cycle they looked at God looked at your righteousness like that the words Amen in case you forgot it amen now listen to me you message people you cannot make yourself good by studying the message that's right amen uhuh I'm waiting on you amen uh-huh oh you say it's not important yes it you cannot make yourself good by following this message no no no no no no no the only way that you become good in the eyes of God when you die and our birth and Resurrection by the blood of the Lamb of your testimony by the fiery baptism of the Holy Ghost if that happens I don't care how good you think you are God's eyes you're know better than a menal rag somebody just smile at me for a little bit amen uhhuh oh but you say I'm a Believer by who by you or by God Amen boy getting quiet in here all of a sudden must be hitting home with a few people tell you plainly I don't care what part of Africa I don't care what part of India I don't care what part of the world it is in none of us can escape St John 3 and3 you must be born again praise the Lord amen that's right let's pray over the word heavenly father thank you for the word of God I pray that you will speak to us now father May every Spirit com subject to your anointing this morning every mind and every thought be brought captive that we might receive what you want us to receive I Surrender myself to you and I Surrender these people to you that we by your grace might be called your children before we walk through here and Heavenly Father may you bless your word now speaker and listener in Jesus name amen and amen amen amen God bless you may be seated now let's Jump Right In one of the biggest problems that we've got around the ranks of Our Truth is this idea that if you can understand brother bram's position you can see the message but that automatically makes you born again our girls will learn how to dress our men will learn how to behave they'll follow all of the rules and go right by line by line into the rule book and when you learn how to follow all of the rules correctly not only are you co-equal with Satan but you're coequal with the Pharisees and you're no different than Judas was before he betrayed Christ being have been built to learn how to adapt to certain things they've learned in the most difficult environments how to speak contrary to who they are to walk and behave contrary to who they really are and human beings have done that for 6,000 years because like the animal kingdom and animals we are just like a little animal learns to adapt to harsh cold and God's nature will cause it to grow fur something like that so do human beings in the atmosphere of the word learn to find that place where they feel like they've obtained salvation and some religious move in their heart I listen to me message people the danger zone of that is Satan knows how to lead people right into that realm and leave them set there you know brother bradam said it like this he said if you won't do any more than just smoke a cigarette Satan is not worried about making you a drug addict or a drunk he knows if he can connect you to that little Vice that he's got you for the rest of your life if that's what you'll do you don't have to live in the gutter and be a bum for for Satan to be happy for Satan to be pleased no Satan is okay with you being greatly religious come right up to the edge just don't cross that line to where you really authentically become a born again Christian I know you listen but I'm going to need some of you Believers to help me for Satan doesn't care about whether or not you actually move Beyond being religious if having like a Bible routine of reading the Bible every day listening to tapes and things I'm telling my age with tapes aren't I amen amen Satan doesn't mind those things he don't mind the you come to church religiously he's all right with that just don't receive the Holy Ghost don't move to the place to where you really sell out your entire heart soul and mind if he can keep you religious he's happy with [Music] that you can come to church all you want that doesn't even bother the devil brother R said when Peter preached on the day of Pentecost Satan never even got out of the bed come on now Satan never even moved with him preaching the greatest message that was ever given to Mankind in the name of the Lord Jesus the greatest message it was ever given to the church Satan never even got out of the bed he slept in that Sunday morning said when Peter went down to the gate beautiful and Divine Healing was performed on that man that so troubled Satan that it just turned him upside down why because now it shows that something more has happened it wasn't just a word and word then but the word had become deed that's what the devil hates right there he don't care how long you follow brother brandom doesn't bother him a bit Satan was in every single one of brother Bam's meetings even the ones that aren't recorded the devil was in every prayer meeting brother Bram was in Satan Drew close every time brother Bram did something for the Lord didn't bother him a bit until that little Prophet said I take every spirit in here under my control it wasn't just word for word sake but the word had become deed that's what God wants with you come on somebody not just a word spoken by word but God wants this word to become a deed in your life just as it was in the church ages bam sent out of saying the Antichrist sent out of saying the white horse rider was just a saying at the time but eventually spoken words find bedding grounds the prophet told us the word through those ages finally became a deed you see even Satan is wise enough to know that word only doesn't produce anything but when the word becomes a deed has all the power of what was spoken behind you that's what the Holy Ghost wants out of you and I come on not just a word spoken the prophet said the prophet said the prophet said you know every bit of that but if it doesn't become an action in your life then you'll never wake Satan up out of his bed I don't know about you but I don't want him sleeping in on my life Hallelujah I don't want him taking it easy on me I don't want him sitting in the lazy chair with his feet kicked out I want to keep him up day and nightall I want to keep him working all day and trouble the kingdom of Hell amen that's what the bride was set here for not to just come and speak the message listen you young people sitting here this morning this is a good message for you to really get into your heart if you're just like me you were raised here your whole life here in brother B brother brother but even you are smart enough to see within yourselves that there's areas of your life you still lack real power in do you know that God doesn't wants you to wait until you're older to get that that's the idea when I get older I'll understand more God don't you understand God doesn't need you to develop a deep understanding of things all he needs is a willing heart the understanding will come later God can reveal more to you later he's looking for someone willing to open their heart up say Lord let the word become a deed inside of me Satan could come into this room this morning could fill every Pew and every chair and every spot in this church with demons and do you know that wouldn't bother us in any way whatsoever Satan couldn't harm you sitting right here next to you because he has no power until you act on what He suggests what he tells you to do you will obey it you know why we obey sometimes because there's no strong man in the house there's nobody on the inside come on preach to bring you to the place to say no Satan I belong to Jesus Christ and him only will I worship Him will I follow but the idea becomes well you know we'll just learn the message and doing so we feel like eventually we'll earn God's favor well I'm glad you come to church this morning I'm going to do my best to light my little gospel stick of dynamite here and blow that false Doctrine up to bits let me be very plain with you right now there's nothing we can do to earn God's favor he either gives it or he don't that's not based on you that's not based on me that's based on what he saw before the foundation of the world so this legalistic idea if I can finally live good enough and clean enough so God will give me his favor number one it's not scriptural number two it's impossible and number three you'll discourage yourself all the days of your life trying to do it look at your ownselves sometimes where do you get the most discouraged it's when you feel that you should have done better but you didn't do it right and because of that feeling you carry that around in your heart all day long do you know why we do that because we think in our minds that if we mess up and do little things that Som God Cuts us off and that we lose his favor all together oh but I got a message for you this morning God's favor is not based upon whether you're good or whether you're bad your birth in this world made you both good and bad and God said every bit of it is rotten to the core but he told Abraham I can swear by no greater Hallelujah Abraham I can't trust you I can't trust any of them prophets I can't trust any of their wives or their kids there's only one that I can trust h and he said that's me so God said I swear by myself cuz he could swear by no greater so God based everything upon himself there's no way in the world you could live good enough to get his favor you couldn't live bad enough to lose it praise the Lord see legal is teaches this if I'm a good boy this week I've got his favor when I'm a bad boy I lose it what kind of business you think God runs anyways if he was that bad at running the human business if his office was that messy and he was that poor of a businessman how could you put any confidence in him as a savior a lord or anything but none of this is based upon us because when I'm bad he is still good and when I'm good he is still good Hallelujah and it doesn't matter what I think about it it matters what God says about it oh and I know how people think well but brother Ben are you trying to say we can live any way we want to that's exactly what I'm telling you you can live any way you want to you see Christians smoke as much cigarettes as they want to smoke they drink as much alcohol as they want to drink they do all the filthy things they want to do thing of it is when you receive the Holy Ghost the want to is taken out of it that's why you don't want to do it no more cuz Christ is living on the inside but Paul said Christ in you the hope of [Music] glory no longer word but it is deed as well amen amen amen so when we look at God's favor we have to understand it is based upon him not based upon us you see I learned a long time ago that if a man or woman is Born Again of the Holy Ghost it don't take much to convince them what living right looks like truly got Jesus here and something comes along in their life or they get involved in something the sun don't turn too many times before the word of the Lord deals with their hearts and they're right back where they needed to be in the beginning you see church God is determined God is Det deted to make sure you don't fall Hallelujah it is in his great heart to not let this bride fall down the Bible said though a man fall he will uphold him with his right hand the world don't have that promise but you and I do somebody say Amen look in your pocket Now find a good Hallelujah in there hallelujah hallelujah God is determined now I love this in a message called God's covenant with Abraham brother BR says I've got nothing to offer well my goodness if brother Bram didn't have nothing to offer what am I going to pull up he so done way more for the Lord than I'll ever do brother done more in one year than I've done in 32 years and if he didn't have nothing to offer God I'm in pretty bad shape what about the rest of you some of y'all just G to sit there and look at me as though I'm preaching at somebody else why look off your face I'm preaching to each and every single one of you don't sit there some pride look on your face I hope old so and so is getting it over there I hope no no you rake it all in right here and say this is me the words got to be taken personally if you want it to change you if you brought your arrogant Spirit to church this morning you just take it right out that back door we don't need it is going to get you in the presence of the Lord having some attitude some Elite ASM attitude oh I don't need to hear this kind of preaching you do and I do come on now come on talk to me a little bit cuz there's no way living in this body right here that I don't need this kind of preaching right but you see that's what we've done in the message we've inflated our personalities we just keep blowing the balloon and our OS get big every year bigger and bigger and bigger with our attitude and before long we're going to be worse than the Pharisees was we'll be so holy nobody can touch us but brother a real Christian Hallelujah that's ever been at the foot of Calvary they remember where they come from and they remember where God brought them down the line God help me never to forget where I came from I was a sinner by birth My Savior and my Lord made me a part of him Amen brother Keith he took me me from the rags of my own self-righteousness and he put me in King's robes now I can sing praise God praise God praise God praise God I'm a child never forget where you come from brother bam says my utmost righteousness next to yours Lord would be filthy [Music] rags so I'm a sinner to begin with there's nothing I could do about it now you get that through your head and you get that in your heart and I promise you it will revolutionize your life once we get rid of this idea that there's something we can accomplish where does that come from anyways it's not even preached in the first century Church age find me show me show me where Apostle Paul ever preached such a thing show me where Peter or James or any of the rest that you can make yourself something by being religious my God children that's the very thing that they were preaching against that's the very group they were standing against them religious Jews standing there thinking they were so holy and had no Holiness in them whatsoever as a matter of fact Jesus prophesied to them that the spirit of antichrist would come right through them you know that's what rode into that first age where did that white horse rider come from there the most holy city they supposedly the most holy people crucified the worst punishment that could have been given to a man him the word the prince of Glory the Prince of Life he who had power in his blood They Crucified him and that Antichrist on just read right rode right on through to the first church age he come out of that Jewish age and jumped up on that first horse rider went right through them Jews straight to the Gentiles can you understand Lans that's why that religious spirit has followed us from to our time we are under the same influence of what they had 2,000 years ago somebody wake up pinch yourself it's nothing but the devil bringing deception God don't want us living blinded to these things why he sent Elijah in the first place was to return our hearts back to the original Faith hallelujah hallelujah cuz just as that first Antichrist hode of the holy ghost ride through all of them ages too amen and the same power same Works same same wonders they came right on down to you and I in the last day as well we the elect are under the influence of that that's why I shout like him I preach like him that's why I sing like him I dance like him I worship like him I believe the word like him and I'm ano just like they were amen and you get that through your mind the same anointing that had Peter preach acts 238 is the same anointing on you if you're born again Glory same one now listen again brother says you see he took his son's blood and covered it over me like that his son's blood made God see me righteous like he is righteous so he doesn't see [Music] me he doesn't Glory Glory Glory he doesn't see me hallu he sees his son's blood glory to God thank you Lord oh praise the Lamb of God you can understand my friends why that God wanted to come in flesh like he did he knew we didn't stand a chance from the beginning we were losers from day one that's why you come to church and sit there without any anointing or feeling on you is because you were born in that kind of condition friend the answer is not to try to fix yourself the answer is put yourself in the hands of God say Here I Am Lord all of my raw looking ways whether I'm good or I'm bad here I am anyway and just give that to him let him sort out all the [Music] rest but we try to follow the rule book who in here has been able to keep all of it raise your hand I'll make sure my hand don't go up so you mean all of us are pretty much in the same boat uhuh then how come some of y'all ain't pulling on the word how come some of y'all ain't pulling amen huh how come some you a't pulling from the word come on you know why I got you right in the spot you don't like to be in that's what an evangelist is good for you know say I don't know nothing about you and I can come here and just preach the gospel now you know what it ain't ain't my fault you're the one tells on yourself because under this anointing You Can't Hide whether you're born again the anointing of the Holy Ghost will tell you are right even if you don't demonstrate out here your own conscience tells you whether you know I'm telling you the truth or not now my question for some of you is how long are you going to Halt between two opinions maybe some of you young people just kind of go on along easy with Mom and Dad but inside your heart you're making plans making plans for when you get old enough to do what you want to do me tell you something young man me tell you something young lady you ought to be grateful to God that you've got a little time of shelter and if mom and dad's got to break your leg every now and then Hey listen little sheep that broken leg is a lot better better than them lions and tigers and them Bears that's out there so you better start considering where your heart is at this morning because God is calling on some of you right now right now to get yourself right with God seek him while he can be found of you my spirit will not always strive with man that ain't just young people that's us older ones too some ofall come in and just string along through church do you know one of these days something will come along strong enough it's either going to shake you in or shake you out so my message for you is choose you this day whom you're going to serve my Bible tells me now is the day of salvation now is the time to get your heart right as for me and my house we'll serve the Lord amenu so I have nothing that I can do in it this goes all the way back to Genesis 18:3 when Abraham and God have a conversation God asked Abraham if I found favor in your sight you see man has always worked toward getting God's favor but the Lord knew that man didn't have the ability to get it I mean how could I please a God that is so holy that everything about me is sinful everything about me is sin at my very best I am still a sinner in this body how could I ever find his favor he took his son's blood and he covered me over Hallelujah Hall and because of that blood he don't see me no more come on somebody he don't see me no more he don't even hear my voice brother bam said the Lamb of God turns to see who's praying and he said my voice mingles with his voice and the lamb speaks on my behalf it's not even me speaking anymore but it's Christ speaking on my behalf Glory forgive them Father they don't know what they're doing even all of my presumptuous sins things I don't even mean to do and don't know I'm doing there's a voice that speaks for me Hallelujah Lord thank God for such Grace now you know in the Old Testament in the New Testament excuse me speaking of Grace you can find it in the New Testament 186 times and everywhere you find the word grace is the same word used for [Music] favor so in essence God's favor is God Grace hallu so where are my Works in that I can't do that can't do anything about it I have nothing to offer Hallelujah the only thing I can do is hide myself in Christ and if I hide myself in him then I don't have to worry about me no more that's the key to all of it now remember it can't be just in word only if I've got a holy heart then my life will follow and obey the way my heart is you know why some people still do horrible things chist is not sitting on the throne of their heart it's just that simple if Christ is in your heart there is no I quit you see people just giving up left I just give up that Prov you because the Holy Ghost is there there is no quitting I'll ask you a question my Bible said he that began this good work I didn't even started so how can I quit hallelu something I never began in the first he began the work he'll finish the work because a seal shows on both sides he that started it be he that finishes it hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord God you amen now you're getting with it that's what I want to now listen to this in the Book of Proverbs it talks about worldly favor I'm just going to use this as an example the Bible said favor is deceitful and in this original word in the Hebrew this word favor means acceptance now you think to yourself among all of the peoples of the world you have this handful of people who are visible to the world influencers and uh uh uh Tik Tock people and these kind of things TI movie stars and singers I was was reading this morning that Taylor Swift is worth 1.1 billion not million billion doll Taylor Swift that's just one girl she's a billionaire she's 31 years old and she's a billionaire and everybody everywhere you hear her name everybody loves this girl oh she's so sweet and she's so nice now nothing against Miss Swift but you let her do one thing that the public disagrees with and the one that they love so much will turn around and become a a scandalous thing in their eyes favor in the world is deceitful said the Bible they can love you today and hate you tomorrow now come on don't you sit there look at me like you don't know what I'm talking about you let some of these movie stars they make these great films that everybody runs to go see them I take M Gibson for example Gibson Mel Gibson was one of the top movie stars in Hollywood for many years to and he goes out I think he got drunk one day or whatever it was he was he was he was inebriated in some way he goes out there and starts spitting out all this garbage against the [Music] Jews and this great movie star that everybody loved all of a sudden they hate him now don't sit and look at me like you don't don't know what I'm talking about favor is deceitful you take some singer or some other kind of person put them right here in this church right here everybody could love them let them do one thing that people disagree with all of that favor that they had for them disappears in our heart number one you know what that proves it proves number one I don't need your stinking favor you can keep it to yourself and it means that you don't need mine or anybody else's favor neither the only favor that's important to you and I is God's favor to the bride L you love me today and then hate me tomorrow the Apostle Paul even said that whenever the Galatians first saw the conditions of his eyes he said you would have taken your own eyes out and give them to me if you could have but he said because I tell you the truth now you seek to kill me that's worldly favor see worldly the favor is based upon conditions but allow me to say it one more time will you let me say it will you listen to me if I say it how many you hear me if I say this amen God bless you for that God's favor is not BAS based on conditions whether I'm a good boy or a bad boy it matters not if I am his child God loves me anyy to God Amen so I don't have to concentrate so deeply oh I I I had a bad thought goes through my mind what does that matter to an eternal God who saw your thought before thoughts ever began oh I like that before there was a brain to think woo hallelujah hallelujah before there was a brain to do any thinking at all before there was a thought to think God already said I know your thoughts and your thoughts are not my thoughts your ways are not my ways Hallelujah come on somebody cuz you see we would throw people in hell right now we would throw ourselves in hell right but my ways are not your ways my thoughts H my thoughts are not your thoughts glory to God praise the Lord God Oh Glory favor is deceitful so the only thing we need favor with God because if I've got favor with him then if you're the elected of God I know I'll have favor with you because if I love him right I can love you right Paul say what are all these evil speakings and clamoring among you he said I've heard there's much disputing among you and then you know what he goes on to say that you should love one another as Christ also loved the church gave himself for it through his own blood you know how I keep going because God shown his favor and Grace to me amen praise the Lamb of God oh thank you Jesus now listen to this brother M said that you have favor with God he'll give gifts to you you know it's a strange thing to me that in the body of Christ soall there are so few gifts among the people it doesn't seem like people are demonstrating Supernatural things they can sure quote the message they can tell you everywhere brother bam said Rapture and how many times they know their Bible upward and downward and backward and sideways and Every Which Way but in order to be able to demonstrate Christ you got to have more than just the ability to sit on a chair and open your ear up and listen young people this goes for you all too don't hurt God's feelings at all if he saw a young sister speaking in tongues but I know we're too spiritual for that right we're too spiritual to see visions and prophesy you know why don't do it because we've not yet obtained God's favor for us CU if we had Divine love in our heart in some way or somehow God would demonstrate the supernatural through our lives be it Discerning or be it some other way now doesn't mean you have to show a gift to show you got the Holy Ghost but the holy ghost shows gifts you should at least be open to receive it but socalled people that say I'm born again they don't even know how to worship outside that old formal stuff they do no excitement to them whatsoever no when they clap their hands they clap like they're at a ball game or they've just heard a good opera singer finish a great worship should be something that generates from a born again heart worship is not just a bunch of routines worship is having that joy that just spills out of your heart and mind and that's the way these gifts operate when you live under the altar of God your days these gifts will just start working right in the body you watch and see the closer you draw to his presence the more his favor will just increase and increase and increase because you've got his favor but we want him to be able to get access to all of us I want Jesus to have control of my eyes my mouth my ears if I'm not built to see a vision that's all right he can put me to sleep and give me a dream whatever he wants to do that's what I want amen but message people have become boring you Noti on boring on you're saying the boring right yeah boring you know as in like when did Church become boring you've got boring preachers boring musicians boring singers boring saints that come to church and are all bored because we become such a a creature of routine we do everything the same way all the time but God loves spontaneous Christian worship you know I've said this for a long time if you get stuck in that routine like that you're someone that always sticks your right arm up next time put your left one up if you're somebody amen amen amen amen amen amen the next time be hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah to shake yourself out don't get stuck in a rut you just wind up in a ditch that way if you are the redeemed let the redeemed of the Lord say so all that half breath praise you the Lord and if you don't do it I know it ain't because of your pastor you forget your pastor was one time my pastor I know what kind of atmosphere I was born under and you sure ain't taught to sit there and stare like a hole in the wall no no sir you ain't taught to sit there and stare like an old hole sitting in the wall you should you've been taught to worship God am I right or am I wrong well you know why we we let back on that because we lose focus on what Christ has really done for us and Friends it all starts in very simple ways you're at work and a bad thought goes through your mind L feel ashamed of yourself but then that human nature kind of kicks in part of the human nature liked it part of the human nature didn't and now here you are in this battle and then Here Comes The Devil see you don't have the Holy Ghost see see you not born again see you couldn't do that and be born again don't you know that's where you need to grab the sword of the word of the Lord let a little courage strike your heart when we should resist the devil Satan shut your mouth amen I know where I'm standing and who I am but we don't do that do we do we do we no what happens we start developing and building up baggage one bag after another and then we come to church brother Isaiah say come on somebody come on some you say I'm coming but I can't get my arms up Christ don't want you coming to church with baggage I'm talking to you come on I'm preaching to you come on Christ don't want you to come with baggage in your hands the Bible said he whom the son is set free fre indeed you don't have to hold on to it amen amen he said cast your care on [Music] me I care for you glory praise His holy name glory to God hallelujah am amen praise the Lord but we let Satan pack this on us he just mounts it up on our shoulders until we come to church and we're so hunched so we can barely make it in the door how you doing today brother somebody pray for me that I can get to Wednesday night pray for me I can get to church on time is one reason why we don't take it more seriously no one likes to come to church and be told about their baggage but you know sometimes the only way to free you of it is to remind you that it's there you know some people get so used to it well I guess this is what Christianity is all about and here they are burdened down with all kinds of things they're carrying this heavy coat on them Pastor say isn't that good right there yeah Pastor that's pretty good I sure believe it pray for me brother Isaiah pray for me is the answer is not to be prayed for no no no we've already prayed for you if you want to get technical Jesus already prayed for you come on one thing you're going to learn before we leave this church today is I'm not going to allow you to leave with one excuse that's what the Holy Ghost told me back there you preach and don't leave one excuse so Here I Am Lord your servant reporting for Duty you see you get so adjusted to that kind of Lifestyle you think this is all I've got this is the best I've got but it ain't all you got to do is reach up there by the grace of God and rip that thing off of your you know Jesus met a woman in an infirmity that was hunched over when God was able to heal her she was able to stretch herself up and straighten herself out God has that kind of healing for some of you some of you've been so crippled in your walk with God you can't even Amen in church right woman thou are loosed this ain't the TD Jake's version this is the Elijah version glory to God because this kind of healing will straighten you out forever but we accept it we accept that kind of life and as a result we live our whole life crippled up and the church said amen right now listen to this brother says he never fully blessed Abraham until Abraham fully obeyed you see God wants our obedience listen listen he wants our obedience even though he knows we cannot be it's impossible to be 100% obedient so he's not asking for us to be perfect obedience is not about doing everything right come on now amen but obedience is being willing to do the right amen cuz that's what God looks at anyhow many years you've been a Christian he's been you've been growing and developing your whole walk and if you're honest and I'm honest a been a day goes by a't messed up somewhere I'm like Paul I Repent daily but why does God give me the Holy Ghost because I'm willing if it means through the fire it means through the flood if friends turn their back on me no matter what it is I'm willing to walk with Jesus God sees that obedience and he he acts upon that obedience that's why he's the Confessor he's the he's the professor of our faith the one that that the high priest Can Be Touched by our confession ra so I can promise him Lord I'll do better I'll do better I'll do better him sitting there looking at me from eternity I know you boy you don't mean that well you mean it but you don't mean it oh but imagine his grace and mercy he knows in our heart we want to do right so he shows us great leniency he gives us spaces of time to learn how to get it have you ever noticed some of the sins in your life that you just keep going back to little things that just constantly beset you seems like did you happen to notice that you wasn't struck with a lightning this morning anybody noticed that the Judgment of God didn't visit you at your breakfast table this morning anybody noticed there was no angels with chains of of of of imprisonment to come get you God simply convicted your heart and you know after a period of time he don't even say nothing about it because you already [Music] know but he wants you to act upon what you know is right that my friends is what we call Christian maturity when you are growing up in Christ there are things that he wants you to do because you know you're supposed to do it that's what James said you say you got faith I'll show it to you by my Works other words I'll act upon what I know but Christ has such leniency for us Grace for us and only when you start going too far that's when he steps in and goes [Music] too far too far come back here it's kind of like you moms and dads you know when you had that little boy or that little girl outside and they were playing by the road now you know when you're a young parent everything scares you to death but after you've had a few kids you know you see them doing things and other parents are going and you're just like oh they they'll be all right like cuz you kind of know how far they'll go and how far they won't I was sitting with one of my family members one time this was when I was a young daddy myself and that woman kept letting that kid get closer and closer and closer to this day and I was getting so scared and so nervous I finally said get that young in and bring it back over here said no he'll be all right let him alone and I got I got comfortable I thought okay well praise the Lord she knows and all at once right in the middle of a conversation she jumped up and ran over there she got that young and dragged him back over there and I said what' you do that for she said he was about to get in trouble that's the way Jesus does you and I he knows how far to let us [Music] play he knows how far to let us go how are you going to learn if he doesn't give you room to learn it same time he also know when you're about to get in trouble and he pulls you back in to God hallu cuz he knows what kind of human you are he knows what your weaknesses are and if you don't learn to fight with your own sword how are you going to fight sure you're going to lose some battles you should expect you're going to lose many of them but that never means you'll lose the war cuz my daddy is watching over his boy he promises not to let me go further hallelujah amen amen amen let me show you that right now Psalm chapter 5 verse 12 if you got your Bible turn there with me they're going to put it there too but I want you to read this in your book don't you listen to what David says God's favor is he says you got got it say Amen am for thou Lord will bless the righteous amen with favor Willl thou Compass him as with a shield Oh Glory thank you Jesus now listen his favor is like a shield to me hallu glory to God in other words a shield does two things it keeps that from the outside from getting inside keeps that on the inside from going outside hallelujah hallelujah am you see that's the way his favor is to me his favor is a shield of life when Satan is attacking he can either let it in or shut it off but he also knows how to keep me inside what Shields me Church his son's blood [Music] Hallelujah that's why brother ROM said if the devil could cross that bloodline he would be our brother but that's my shield and I can be walking and doing my own [Music] thing you didn't do the bo yo Yoo part if you're going to translate translate all of it boy yo yo come on let's get with it here Frank don't like to do my little my little ceremonies but when a man is starting to go too far there's a spot he hits where he runs right into the shield how many knows that's the truth certain areas of your life he thought oh it's no big deal and all of a sudden out of nowhere God sends this rebuking message you better straighten your act up I'm going to get you was that the shield you got too close to the edge oh now listen to me listen to me I may not have known where the edge was but he knew where it was and he's always watching Glory hallelujah hallelujah amen his watchful eyes is always looking out praise His name now listen to this in Psalm 30 verse 5 the Bible says here his anger endureth but for a moment but in his favor is life weeping may endure for the night um endures or it lasts through the night goes through the night but joy cometh in the morning thank you L you realize this scripture could not have been applied to Judas you realize that scripture cannot be applied to the Catholic system do you realize there's not a denomination in the world that can claim this verse for their own do you know not Cain or Esau or any of the rest of those on the uh the bad side of this can lay claim to that promise right there cuz God's anger for them was permanent come on somebody once they cross that line between mercy and judgment God anger was permanent his anger is kindled against them all the days of their life and when he drops down into the white Throne judgments his anger has accumulated he has gathered 6,000 years of anger against the unjust that when he comes to to to bring them to the Reckoning face is so terrible to the Heaven and the Earth High hi from him anybody in here ever seen your Daddy really get mad I mean really get mad and you know there is no escaping his wrath they about three of you blink in your eyes amen you know what I'm talking about Come on talk to me now that's the way God's anger is going to be against that bunch out there but for you and I he gets angry for a moment more Hallelujah you see it's kind of like my kids you know I'm raising three girls two of them are what I affectionally call stupid teenage girls get the stupid in that's important you said the stupo I got that one all right stupid teenage girls now these teenage girls may not be stupid but mine are because they do the dumbest things that girls could do I know none of you sweet little angels in here none of you teenage angels in here I know none of you know what I'm talking about but I've got some of the best girls in the world but they're stupid teenage girls this is a time in their life when they can do the dumbest things human beings can do I see all of the angels have shown up to church I know ain't none of y'all ever been teenagers you don't know what I'm talking about do you I know you were perfect and sweet and right in every way I'm sure unless of course some of you are lying and you'd like to be honest now and say yeah I know what you're talking about brother B two three and four and five what's about the rest of y'all you see at this stage of Life they're learning life and because of where they are they're just susceptible to do the dumbest things possible and you see my girls is brilliant as beautiful as they are like my pastor told me just the other day he said brother Ben I want you to know before anybody can date that daughter of yours they've got to come through me and they got to come through you and then there's that brother and then there's Uncle so and so and then that brother so my girls are pretty safe I think for a while they do some of them the the the most wonderful things sometimes they'll do little things for Daddy and I think man you are the best kids in the whole wide world until stupidity shows up I say my goodness how how in the world come on come on can you be so smart and then be so dumb but you see I'm daddy and I'm allowed to look at them both ways I wouldn't dare look at your children that way cuz those are your kids I that's not my business but with my girls I'm allowed to see them in their good places I'm allowed to see them in their plac you see sometimes my anger will Kindle against them not because I'm mad at him but because I'm disappointed and that disappointment brings this anger in me I told you a thousand times don't do it that way I may get mad at him I may holler and fuss and carry on Hot in the world doesn't matter with you stupid teenage [Music] girls but when the morning comes they're still my blood and when I see them in the morning I'll get them by the hand and say all right sweetheart let's try it one more time why because my anger endures only for a moment but in my favor is their lives that's the way our heavenly father looks at us I know some of you think I'm being mean about my girls I'm not nearly the way God is about his own you know the prophet of God said God gets so mad at us sometimes he feels like taking us sometimes he feels like just grabbing us and shaking as a good one what is a matter with you kids he can get angry at us but his anger only endures for a moment just for a season and then after he comes to the place time time to start again the morning comes he takes us by the hand all right come on Benjamin let's try it again now what does that his favor amen his favor and I can lay claim to this when nobody else can lay claim to praise God God prise God Amen I'll just leave that there with the stup stupid teenage kids I won't talk about none of us stupid adults yet I'll just leave that for next now dropping down to verse seven now listen if you're watching the clock your pastor told me to take as much time as I needed so here we are so if you're going to text Isaiah get down to business right now cuz I'm going to keep preaching I'm I'm not nowhere near done yet I'm going to keep going till I'm done look at verse seven he says Lord by thy favor thou Hast made my Mountain to stand strong you see a mountain in the the Bible represents a few things one part of it is inspiration brother said he go high into the mountains he said in there he get Inspirations from God a mountain can also represent the height or the the Pinnacle of something the the greatest of all of it the new city is a mountain and Jesus sets at the top of that mountain on the very top of that City there sits Jesus Christ the rainbow of God proceeding forth from him but a mountain also represents something else in the New Testament oldest it represents a new beginning you see whenever we go through Low Places no matter how many we might go through the valley is only a testimony that at some place at some point in time I'm going to come to the foot of a new beginning and I can walk up and try again you see I'm not really in the valley when I'm in the Valley I'm just changing mountaintops that's all amen so God said by his favor he made my Mountain to stand strong so no matter how many valleys I go through I've always got a new beginning you know what that means that means you have unlimited tries now I was a boy and we used to play video games at home well I was a boy we we fell in love with video games like that cuz we figured out a way to play without losing all the lives we had unlimited lives and no matter how many times little Mario fell in the ditch I could start again let me tell you something brother I lost a lot of quarters figuring that lesson out I discovered the secret of unlimited lives that's the way it might have been with you Hallelujah you might have went from denomination to denomination to church to this to that but once the revelation of God's grace strikes your heart you're living in the light of an unlimited life no matter how many times you hit the ditch he has made my Mountain stand strong am praise be to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah listen to this let me close here brother B says it like this it says if you profess to be a [Music] Christian no matter what you've done what you Tred to make yourself what you do is not accepted it's what he done your own righteousness won't be accepted Now read this with me watch this with me the brother Hebrews chapter 4 if you quit smoking just because you said well I better quit smoking because I profess Christianity this what brother says it won't be accepted God don't accept it you know that's a funny thing with smoking I was born in 1977 so in my early days as a boy they could still show cigarette commercials on television you know ads in the papers and everything but most of the younger generation in here they were trained in a different environment smoking wasn't called deadly when I was a kid but about the time I hit 12 or 13 years old the smoking industry became exposed and all of these people now were guilty of causing millions of deaths and you know ain't it like the devil ain't that like the devil to see a generation come up and know that that cigarette smoking will kill you so what did he do so what did the devil do for that generation he changed the marketing plan and he moved from smoking to vaping vaping you know what vaping is don't you where they got that little electronic cigarette and they blow that big cloud of smoke you know what I'm talking about the French word like yeah I don't know what you it's it's it's a it's a manufactured cigarette it's a mechanical I mean mechanical cigarette is what it is yeah I know what you're talking about yeah do they who knows what vaping is I just make sure before I go on with what I'm saying you understand what it is all right so this is what they proved they put flavors in them they declared that these electronic cigarettes were way safer than cigarettes were and the next thing you know young people were vaping like crazy and you know what they proved about that they proved that was more dangerous than the cigarette was but Satan made it pretty made it look innocent you know brother bradam talked about that many many years ago he said in the early days there was a certain brand of whiskey whis called Johnny Crow Johnny Crow and said Johnny Crow was this horrible looking little vulture bird looking thing Crow he looked like a monster like something out of a scary movie but then the devil got smart and so the next time he put a top hat and a cane a tuxedo on Johnny Crow Tu Johnny Crow and he made him look classy made him look wealthy oh and how slick the devil is got more people to drink whiskey after that than he did before that my wife is a school teacher and young people can sit in their desk and pull their hoodie over their head and it goes right up into their clothes and you can't see smoke or anything it is as sneaky as it can be but is a trick of the devil to kill this next Generation the same as cigarettes did before them may I say it in the name of the Lord flee you for lust and cl to the Cross of Christ Satan has gotten way more tricky used to be that you had to go into a room and watch television now you can sit on the toilet and do it go down the road in your car and do it aha the word's amen come on Satan knows what he's doing that's why we've got to be better than him the only way we can be better than the devil is to have Christ in you which is the hope of glory exactly right brother I can't help it that's just the truth about Christ on the inside he' deceive every one of us but thank God he cannot deceive the election why cuz his son's blood covers me over thank you Lord oh yes he said if you quit lusting after women just because you're making yourself do it God don't accept it that's something you do that's works it's Grace that saves you has God come to you and taking the whole thing out of you you say I joined church so I had to quit these things let's say it in our language I believe the message so I can't do these things that's just you doing that but when his son's blood covers you then you don't have to quit it it will quit you CU it's not of works that any man can boast but by the favor by the grace of almighty God hallelujah praise His holy name I'm quitting you're starting to wiggle I know you're getting tired if Frank would preach faster you wouldn't we wouldn't be here so long I'm teasing him amen it's my fault right you did get that part okay never mind listen to this last statement let's go home he said in Ezekiel 3313 he said if he shall trust in his own righteousness and commit iniquity all of his righteousnesses shall not be remembered but the iniquity he commits he'll end up dying for it you see that's that's the world today they try to establish their own righteousness but Paul says here in Romans 10 and 3 that Bunch around him he said they were ignorant of God's righteousness going about to establish their own righteousness see that's why I was telling you the last time I was here with you we don't want to be some manufactured version of Christianity everybody looking the same dressing the same acting the same God made you an individual and as long as you're living holy and living clean before the Lord be who you are if you're African and you like bright colors sister brother wear your bright colors as long as you're living holy where as long as it's in line with the Bible do it and if you're some boring white guy then be boring white guys you say that CU you didn't say it I said it me right here that wasn't Frank that's me be what we are God doesn't hate us for our individuality said when he saw that bride coming around all of them was dressed in their National Guards amen he's a god of variety right exactly right not our own establishment but listen to this and I love this statement right here Paul comes to tell us in Romans chapter 5 verses uh 10 and 11 when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life Hallelujah and not only so but we also joy to God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we have now received the atonement do you know what this word atonement means in the original Greek it means the restoration of the favor of God so I was an enemy to him and I lost his favor when I became a sinner I was an enemy to that and that was in this life here but see if my name was on the Lamb's Book of Life the real me had never lost his favor and the only way to reconcile me was he's going to have to kill me for ye are dead in Christ being buried with him in baptism resurrected into the newness of life and now the real me can express what what's always been understand that what's always been there his Divine favor from the very beginning when I became a Christian he just restored that favor back to me there's a brother from Ghana did anybody ever know Samson Sams he's gone now and i' call him on the phone every now and then Pastor Tay brother brother Samson
