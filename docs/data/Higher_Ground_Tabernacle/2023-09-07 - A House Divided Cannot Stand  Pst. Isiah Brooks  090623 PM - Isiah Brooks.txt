Christ uh we we love the Lord and we just thank God for his grace trying to figure out which way I want to go with this uh as we stand let us turn to Isaiah 55 we're going to read the 10th verse 10 and 11th verse of Isaiah 55 glad to have everybody here tonight and it reads is for as a rain come down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but WTH the Earth and maketh it bring forth and Bud that it may give seed to the soar and bread to the eater come come so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which which I please amen and it shall prosper in the things whether to I sent it and only let us pray dear heavenly father God we come before you Lord thank you for your goodness thank you for your grace and we ask oh God humbly tonight that you would just feed our souls give us strength give us what we stand in need of take us to that next level oh God that Lord God when we when we when you you do return you do translate us Lord it be just one step Lord mer us Lord name Jesus Christ amen amen you may be SE a lot of things that are on my mind uh but uh I was I was thinking uh by way of some others who we we were talking with they were talking about the uh uh the Ten Commandments and I thought well you know something deep about that and it's and it's beyond anything that we can accomplish but you must realize these Commandments though they became law is what God required but no man could uh accomplish this and every time I read the word where Paul said he did he said he was blameless the LA blameless and to be honest with you I can't understand that because the Bible said all have Sinn and come short of the glory of God so when I think about Paul's statement I'm not sure of what he was speaking of uh because I know how I struggle every day and I ask for forgiveness every amen amen but the thing that really uh encourages me is the scripture in Isaiah because I recognize in the scripture it it is the it is the laws of God that makes a seed come to life the seed has no ability of itself but the rain that comes falls upon it it's like an anointing that brings something that is dead back to life and God uses this as a metaphor so that you can see what his plans this plan is for each individual in my thoughts I thought about the Bible says love the Lord all your heart with all your mind and with all your soul and in my thoughts I thought the word is the god of my soul hallelujah hallelujah my subject tonight would be A House Divided cannot stand and how many times have the Lord said in the scripture I am the Lord thy God and I change nothing so if God doesn't change then what makes the relationship change uh when I thought about it and considered what God did in the beginning the Bible said he created Adam and Adam he created man and woman and he called their name Adam they were on one Accord they were in love and their house was solid but a serpent came and divided the house and the house fell remember the the the thing that the reason that God created man was not only to worship because he had Angels worship he had cherubim sherim they were all worshiping him but there was something more I would say uh more beautiful in the mind of God as brother Bram said he was a father he a mother he's a sister he's a brother he's a husband he's a wife he'll be to you whatever you let him be hallelu but God has one rule one law that keeps Unity between him and his creation and that is you must love the Lord all heart with all of your mind with all of your might is that right so that you understand God knew that in his creation there would be a time that he would labor lab his day is that right on the seventh day God rested so with all of those days that he had working work Monday Tuesday but when it came to Saturday I'm trying to come to seventh day that seventh day was supposed to be God's day hallelujah hallelujah that means the whole entire day you were supposed to all Fellowship God and God Alone y understand me all of those days he gave one day because he knew you and I were going to be busy Hallelujah is that right because he was busy but there there was one day and I'm saying a lot right now because you don't know where I'm going with this one day amen amen one day for God and it was so important that God said if you work on this day working on this day y'all hear me so God you know you look at this thing and you try to figure out the importance of it see God knew all things he even knew this day men would be so busy will not even have time for his creator [Applause] be so busy somebody help me here right and Satan knew if I could divide this house the house will fall and in his separating Adam and Eve from each other he also separated God from Adam and Eve y'all hear me because it did not change uh the relationship but it changed the fellowship and so what when we see Adam take Eve unto wife that was profound he literally gave up everything that he knew understood Hallelujah because remember the Bible said Adam was not deceived it wasn't as if he didn't understand what he was giving up but he was expressing of God the kind of love that God would have for his we could see that he was willing to stay in order to save her hallelujah hallelujah right cuz she she was deceive So Adam became her sin right and so therefore God couldn't kill Eve because of what Adam did somebody help me this is how it was and is with Jesus Christ God could not kill us because of what Jesus Christ did he became my sin he became your sin hallelujah hallelujah that we might become his righteous hallelujah hallelujah see wond this is important with God and believe you me Oneness is important with the devil too see when God comes along and the Bible describes it in go in Genesis that the the voice of God walks the evening crying out Adam Adam where thou hallelujah hallelujah now Adam was in a place he had never been before though he was in Eden spiritually he was no longer in Eden because the Bible say the day you eat of this tree you surely die understand me so for the first time Adam is feeling a separation hallah from God his creator hallelujah hallelujah this is why even Jesus said my God my God Thou forsaken me Hallelujah huj like the first Adam felt the separation from Godus Christ the second ad the separation God hallelujah it had to have been a horrible thing hey but he knew Jesus Knew by shedding his blood he was going to bind up that brid once again will be able to fellowship with God hallelujah that was part of his service amen he said in that day you know that I'm in the father father in me and I am in you hallelujah hallelujah thank God for Jesus hallelujah hallelujah oh my God when you really see the Liberty that you have think about it this is what I believe Grieves the Holy Ghost his subjects uh that he died for opportunity fellowship with him not just one day but every day hallelujah hallelujah it must grieve him when we find time but him A House Divided can't stand God needs unity in his house hallelujah hallelujah is that right but in order for the unity to return back to the to the house of God the word of God must be the god of our soul you understand me cuz the Bible says that the soul that sin shall surely die hallelujah hallelujah and in order for us not to sin there must be an atonement because we were born Sinners God has to bring a change the Holy Ghost didn't come feel good to make us shout and dance hallelujah hallelujah it it didn't listen the Bible says it didn't even come to make you do Miracles because the Bible says you can do all of these things and you have not charity if you don't have the love of God in your soul it profits you nothing are we making sense you think about it illustration after the illustration you take the house of Jacob and he had two wives Rachel and Leo constant confusion hallelujah hallelujah while the house was divided you take Abraham and Sarah they were okay until Jacob and Es born Hallelujah and let me tell you this when you get saved only the beginning of the battle saying now you got as the prophet of God says you got a white dog and a black dog fighting each other by the parable We Know by the parable you feed the the one that will hallelujah hallelujah but I'm I am convinced instead of fighting with the dog excuse me kill him kill the old nature let the Holy Spirit kill the old nature Hallelujah there's a reason why oh I'm jumping I'm jumping let me slow down a little bit I'm getting too excited I'm enjoying myself you know what I'm saying the chef always enjoy the food first amen let's turn to James quickly everybody cold hun you I tried to turn it up a little bit it's okay it's okay I'm okay cuz I'm I'm I'm where the heat is just that James 3 13- 17 who is a wise man and endure with knowledge among you let him show out of a good conversation his work with meekness of wisdom but if you have bitter envying and strife in your heart Glory not and lie not against the truth this wisdom descendeth not from above but it's Earthly ual and for where envy and strife is there is confusion and every evil work hallelujah how many believe that but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then peaceful and easy to be [Music] inrig full of Mercy good fruit FRS without partiality hypocrisy let me show you something when we see and look into the scripture according to uh uh uh the birth of Cain and Abel was trying to tell us something hallelujah hallelujah here was one with the nature of God but there was another with the nature of the devil hallelujah hallelujah and look what happened it happened in church it happened at the altar hallelujah hallelujah where Cain [Applause] slew because he was jealous of his blood sacrifice he jealous of the fellowship he had with God Hallelujah because the Bible says that Abel's Fellowship Abel's sacrifice so I'm bringing it to the church when your sacrifice when under the blood when you know that you're serving God when you are talking to God and God is talking to you don't think that the spirit of Cain is not watching you is that all right you should wait wait a minute but let me show you what Jesus did with that hallelujah hallelujah he never thought back Hallelujah and one of the things I look at it doesn't say but we always Envision coming up behind Abel and killing him unawares but that's not the way it was with J hallelujah hallelujah they didn't come behind his back it was face to face hallelujah hallelujah and guess what he was able to love his eny and why the Bible says during his cruci he would be led like a lamb to the [Music] slaughter he wouldn't open his mouth in other words he wouldn't fight back somebody he even told Peter if you fight with the sword you die with the sword you have been called to be a lamb the lamb Hallelujah Jesus is the Lamb of God hallelujah you don't fight your enemy en amen amen hallelujah hallelujah he's got it all through the word hallelujah you know you you you think about Jacob and Esau Jacob could have stood there and fight to to fight Jacob could have stood there to fight Esau there to fight but he ran Hallelujah understand he knew he had the blessing there was no way that Esau could really kill him because God had already pronounced a blessing while he was in the womb Jacob love I just to know the word weapon formed against me weapon formed against you Pros hallelujah hallelujah why because the word has spoken you were blessed before you were born you were blessed in the womb hallelujah hallelujah and if you should die you be blessed in the Tomb hallelujah hallelujah nothing can stop you from reaching your goal did I not read that that's what Isaiah said God going to water you God will water you you he will make sure that seed in you come to maturity he will make sure Hallelujah when the Rapture take place you will be Rapture Ready hallu it's not by power it's not by might by the holy spirit it's God Alone God Alone hallelujah hallelujah glory to God you need patience you patience hallelujah hallelujah you need God to bring you to a place where you can buide your God will do that but he said you have not you have not hey somebody see you can't just ask ask God and you're not in in in sincerity God knows the heart y'all hear what I'm saying whenever you approach God you got to be as sincere as you possibly can because he knows and if you are sincere God will answer your prayer it doesn't matter who you are I didn't know I was going to be preaching this it's just the way God turn hallelujah hallelujah is that all right second Timothy 4 18 how many of y'all understand Grace better now how many of y'all understand the election better I preached on a few services that you should understand it betterall you didn't choose God God chose you hallelujah hallelujah and I don't care how the devil accus you of being so bad hallelujah hallelujah the Bible said we all sin come short of the glory of God nobody in here is better than the other but when you understand God loved me and if God loved me I need to learn how to love me most people have problems because they don't love themselves hallelujah hallelujah but in order for someone else to love you love you God created you and God created you the way you are for his glory we don't know how he going to how he's going to do it but we know we will be glorified with hallelujah hallelujah second Timothy 4:18 you love the Lord and the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his Heavenly Kingdom so when the devil come at you and tell you you're not going to make it take your sword out Timothy let the devil know when God spoke that that was being written he had me in his mind hallelujah hallelujah and will preserve me unto his Heavenly Kingdom to the glory forever and ever amen amen that is so good to me fellowship with God through reconciliation 1956 120 paragraph 21 so when we find out that man must come back to his maker then when Adam realized sin has separated him he became an alien a wonderer away from God without hope wondering around the garden knowing that he was separated from God let me tell you something you know when you're separated from God hallelujah it's not a good feeling when you're separated from God listen and when you know that you're separated from God hallelujah huj you know that one time you was not separated true hallelujah hallelujah you can't tell if you separated from God if you ever been joined to God there's a time you Fellowship we all do that's why we confess because we don't like that feeling of being separate hallelujah hallelujah I'm feel I want to shout and dance maybe do a cartwheel tonight I ain't going to try that but I'm just trying to express to you how good I Hallelujah see the God knowing that he was separated from God knew that he didn't have Fellowship no more it made him a Wanderer and the man and man to this day when the sin problem he still becomes a Wanderer he will go to One Church a while he he longs to have Fellowship he would join the Methodist or the Pentecostal or some church he will go in there and he will find perfection in church among the people he will lead this church and take his letter and go to another he will go from church to church he's a Wanderer here from God this why we must stop Hallelujah God is not in the church building you find God on your knees Hallelujah and the Bible says he is even n thee even in your mouth hallelujah hallelujah glory to God the problem is people don't understand and neither do they believe when Jesus said I'll never leave nor will I forsake I will always be there for you that's exactly what he means that's what he does hallelujah whether you recognize it or not God is always protecting hallelujah hallelujah even when the devil would want to destroy you God puts his hand out that's not going to happen why I'm not through hallelujah hallelujah the power behind the promise is his word is that right the bible say that the grass withs the grass withers the flowers fade away but the word of the Lord shall why would the word of the Lord stand because the word of the Lord is God hallelujah hallelujah Romans n please ROM going to read from the eighth verse and I'm trying I want to get into something quickly I'm trying to get there but let me tell you let me say it like this anytime you spend more time with something outside of spending that time with God it becomes an idol most of us ought to be glad that we don't have to perform the Sabbath day because in this day wouldn't be we wouldn't be able to do it we got cell phones we got iPhones we got all kind of gadgets and everything else that we we don't believe don't we yeah we don't but let me show you something I don't have my my cell phone but look doing I'm bowing to this my head is bowed Hallelujah now some of y'all don't know this but I lived I've lived long enough to know that the television us to be on the floor now you got to look up to it like you you're in a you in a you in a position of worship and we see all that instead of wondering about God like we look at the television I don't mean to be funny the truth of the matter is if you're not careful now I know people who are addicts they got to watch that television I know know people who are addicts to the cell phone Hallelujah try to take a teenager cell phone and you GNA see some demons they don't even know they're possessed and they really think that that's their attitude no no no that's you got something in you that's pulling for that Hallelujah is that right brother said anything that is a habit especially if it's a bad habit Hallelujah now let me move on reading from the eth verse that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise for the seed y'all understand what I'm saying it was Jacob who had the promise but Esau was a better character hallelujah hallelujah he did everything daddy told him to do he was a better son but Jacob was a shy he was a de hallelujah hallelujah but he had the promise Hallelujah see is not by power it's not by might by the spirit of the Lord you've got to believe that you are a son or daughter by promise and if you are Son and Daughter by promise promise nothing in Hell stop the promise y'all hear what I'm saying nothing in this earth nothing in the United States nothing in stop you Hallelujah because the bible say that his word cannot come back will accomplish it and there's nothing that Satan has that can stop the word of God you might have to suffer you might have to go through things but at the end of the day you'll be right there in the kingdom of God With God himself hallelujah hallelujah the devil is a liar hallelujah hallelujah for This Is The Word of Promise will I come and Sarah shall have a son hallelu not only this but when Rebecca also had conceiv by one even by Our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that call it why you can't rid of it when God calls you no matter what you go through you can't get rid of God hallelujah hallelujah why because God has already tagged you tagged you before you were even born right he said Jeremiah I knew you I called you I Sanctified you even when you were in your mother's womb I called you to be a prophet Hallelujah nothing can stop Jeremiah from being a prophet hallelujah hallelujah even when he lived they wanted to kill him but they could do it Jeremiah fed the promise the word said he would hallelujah hallelujah yes sir that's the way it works he promised me and right now I'm going tell you something God told me he he was going to give me all my children and I look at the the way they are and if I tried to figure it out I would I wouldn't know what to do but it ain't it's not me I can't I can't figure it out but God said it now you saw what brother B I don't know about we don't know how bad job children were had a token had a sacrifice hallelujah hallelujah y'all better hear what I'm saying hallelujah hallelujah and job's children were caught partying on the Dead uh uh dead Ballroom floor let me say it like that on the ballroom floor they were killed but job had a blood [Music] Power in the Blood we don't understand it but he promised it y'all hear what I'm saying I don't know how he's going to do but he promised it hallelujah hallelujah and God's word is sure I can rest on that Hallelujah because I realize that everybody that gets to Heaven gets to heaven on the wings of Grace hallelu it's not your Works what he did for you he died for you he suffered for you he rose for you hallelujah hallelujah that's it amen get back devil sometime the devil try to get you threatened your eyes on God eyes on the no matter what Satan says no matter what he does you know Jesus is always there you know the storms were so bad for Peter he forgot Jesus was right in front of you understand me we do the same thing storms of life hits us all kind of whe all kinds of headaches all yes that's what we do and we forget who's in front hallelujah hallelujah but all we got to do is call on the name of Jesus yall hear what I'm saying he was right there at our hands reach Arms Reach picked up Peter he never let you drown he might let you go down a little bit but hey hey he'll never let you hallelujah hallelujah is that right oh my listen and it was said unto her the 12th verse Hallelujah let me go back to the 11th for the children being not yet born nether have done any good or EV the purpose of God according to election not of works that call it hallelujah hallelujah you say what brother what do you talking about I always go back to Peter Peter denied Jesus three times and God still made him to preach on Pentecost Judas was not of goded he betrayed God one time and found his soul in huj it goes right back to the scripture Jesus said I have not lost one am that's why God said bless bless God said bless curse not hallelujah hallelujah you're supposed to always bless your children hello you you you should never say you're just bad not they're your children and if they're bad that means you they came from that tree y hear what I'm saying oh you're just so stupid well you just call yourself stupid yeah that's the truth look what Abraham did go look what Isaac did Abraham lied Jacob lied it kept going why they were from the same tree but did God save them Hallelujah on that Resurrection morning they got up out of the Grave hallelujah hallelujah it's always been Grace it will always bece hallelujah hallelujah yes sir amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen amen is that all right as it is written Jacob I have loved but es have I hated what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God God forbid for he said to Moses I will have mercy whom I have mercy and I will have compassion of whom I will have compassion who's going to stop him who's going to stop him hallelujah hallelujah you may know all my dirty laundry glory to God but if I'm elected and chosen by God nothing can stop it Hallelujah like the scriptures say can wash me the song says what can wash me Wier than snow nothing but the blood of Jesus that's why I remain a Christian because I know I am a faulty being Within Myself I need the blood of the Lamb the life of God I need the Holy Ghost to live it because I realize I can't live it on my own hallelujah hallu thank you Jesus Matthew 12 hallelujah hallelujah you and I must understand we're living in the day where all these Earthly things must give away to the Eternal things is that right we can see it everything's falling apart men are so insane now they don't have no love not even for their own huah oh you think people look at children oh you're so cute you know now people don't even have the affection for children hallelujah it's just what it is the reason being they broke the law of God love the Lord thy God with all your mind with all your heart the whole world suffering we broke the law of I'm telling you am you look at a family that really loves each other they will stay together but when you let stuff get in between like Adam and Eve this is what I love Adam for he loved his wife and he refused to let the devil keep he sacrificed himself that's what Jesus did for us Hall we were dead in sin TR we were worthy of death my lord your Lord hallelujah Ste in took our sins upon him to do what save us and do you think he's going to go through all of that and let the devil take you he's not going to do it it's impossible for him cuz Jesus said I've never lost one hallelujah hallelujah the devil is a liar Jesus knew their thoughts and said unto them every Kingdom divided against itself brought to Desolation and every city or house divided against shall not stay so the point is when he can get husband and wife fussing and caring on he knows got he's got him defeated and when he can get uh church people fighting each other he know the church is right up for a split y hear I'm saying dividing the church by gossip you know just talking too much knows that he has the church members under control is to divide and Hallelujah that's why the Bible loves one Accord hallelujah hallelujah that's right we're not supposed to go to bed or sleep if we know we got things that must need to be hallelujah hallelujah hey the Bible says 26 verse if Satan cast out Satan he is divided against himself how how shall then his King and that's what people think oh we can have all this confusion when I'm talking about this I've got I've got a lot of people in my mind because Satan is hitting everywhere it ain't just in your lives it's everywhere and if he can get you off uh uh uh divide your house he's going to do it because he knows if he can divide your house bring that division in church eventually those spirits will start Conquering the church y'all hear what I'm saying this is why you should never gossip and if somebody has a problem with someone you supposed to do like the Bible say go to that person and and at end of the day you got to love that person yeah you're not fighting flesh and blood on and I believe we're the Bride of Jesus Christ Satan know that if he can throw things we're going to displease God you know why because the word is not your God that is that right the Bible said if you love me keep my command if you don't love if you don't love God you don't keep y hear what I'm saying it sound like legalistic but the word must become your God put it this way it must become your head Shi if Eve had only gone to Adam and say Adam this Beast over here is flirting with me y'all hear what I'm saying the whole story would have been different Hallelujah let me tell you something when the devil come at you supposed to call on the name of Jesus that's your head sh that's your lord your God the Bible even said he's our husband Amen Let Him straighten it out right listen and if Satan cast out Satan he is divided against himself how shall then his kingdom stay Hallelujah and if I be be above by who do your children cast them out therefore they shall be your judges see because even in Israel people were being healed people were being healed before Jesus came because the Bible said I send my word word healed hallelujah hallelujah so there were those able to step into the pool of Shalom and that was going on before Jesus came but the angel would come down and Trouble the water and so Jesus is saying if I'm the devil then how are these other people being healed so if I cast out Devils by the spirit of God then the kingdom of God is come unto you hallelujah hallelujah you love the Lord yeah I move on with this okay God is so good to us hallelujah the true worshippers must be uh uh scriptural true wor scri uh John 4:24 and I'm I'm because I want you to understand though we don't have big statues outside that we're bowing to this world is the most idolatrous world uh uh uh how can I say it in in this age people are more idolators than ever before far worse and the devil was so smart he took away statues but he he gave us other things y understand now if you study you find out Israel before one of the reasons they fa to ID worshiping because they didn't have pleasure like we've got now hallelujah hallelujah they didn't have amusement parks Park Amusement you know what I'm saying they didn't have all that stuff but among the heathens the heathens were wasteful wasteful Hallelujah and so when they worshiped their God they had a lot of music a lot of dancing they had contest all that Israel was boring they were boring because they lost the love for the word it became tradition and whenever this message become tradition Satan is going to give you something y'all hear what I'm saying when your relationship began to go cold with God Satan going to give you some entertainment y'all hear what I'm saying he's going to give you something that's going to make you an idolator and you know what what's so difficult of that easy to get rid of an idol anybody know what I'm talking about not somehow that spirit is connected it takes the word of God of God know what I'm talking about but for those who are listening even by Hallelujah you know how difficult it is some of us were far more spiritual until came and then when came it revealed how spiritual many people have not recovered from it since then still watching the same stuff connected to the whatever internet Tik Tok Tik Tok I don't know that but y'all know what I'm saying and you know and I know that cell phone is trouble we need it but it's a dangerous thing without the Holy Ghost hallelujah hallelujah how many of y'all know what I'm talking about W in the morning you hit your knee wor about on your cell phone you for your come on somebody I'm just being honest I'm just trying to tell you I've experienced these things immediately when I do that the Holy Ghost check me because the Holy Ghost must come first you up first thing you must do getting to a place where you can pray Ah that's when you really connected little I get up sometime I go brush my teeth uh you know and and wash my face and I feel convicted because I didn't acknowledge Him First Hallelujah acknowledge Him First he God acknowledge Him First if it wasn't for him Hallelujah you would not have awakened that hear what I'm saying he woke you up the first thing you should say thank you Jesus hallelujah hallelujah absolutely absolutely and when you acknowledge Him First guarantee you your day is going to go better God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit so here I'm coming to the you say well I got the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost love truth because the Holy Ghost is truth hallelujah and when you pick up something outside of God comes an idol you you can't you can't worship God and Y hear what I'm saying you got to lay one aside and I'm coming to this whole thing I'm coming to this how many of us even though we're not under the law how many of us have set aside a day out of all the days seven days in a week how many of us have set one day to talk to God and God alone I wonder can we do it there's no law we're under the grace but with the knowledge that I Shar today that love that a long time with you God loves have a long time with you and how many of even if it's just a half a day we're going to leave out of here with a mind that's determined give God more quality time Hallelujah cut the cell phone off y shut it down everything that's going to disturb you Hallelujah if you got to go somewhere go to a go somewhere where you and God and God alone and if your man tell you your spouse this is my day with God and if you need that the phone to be answered you s but don't knock on my door this is me and God's time you know how difficult that would be with how busy we are even time is becom an idol even time has become an idol don't mess with my time right don't mess with my time this is my time see what you hear what I'm saying smart folks hallelujah hallelujah

when you don't when you don't do this of God are coming together it's a bad Sin people don't understand that they say God I love God and I love the word no you don't especially if you're just at home

believing with you that God will bring them in like they should be I just believe that right now they might be Anointed with a contrary Spirit but that does not speak for the heart God knows the heart Bible said the Lord knoweth them that are here huah amen and when it comes to a loved one don't ever give up it doesn't mean you got to Fellowship because light and darkness don't Fellowship like that you can love a person but hate their ways Hallelujah and when you love a person you continue to pray you understand me now I'll say it like this when you light and darkness can't Fellowship I don't care who it is there there are some of my children I can't fellowship with them because they all about Darkness it doesn't mean I don't love them I love all my children I believe all of all my children but there are some of them I can Fellowship around the word and have but then there are those that don't want it's okay it's okay I had God had to bring me and none of y'all know where he brought me from but I always tell people this I said if God can save me he can save anybody I believe that I don't sound I don't say say that to sound righteous I'm telling you the truth I'm telling you the truth can I say it like this and I'm [Music] closing you are their salvation according to the scripture you are their but you got to stand strong in the word of God you got to let them see that there's a difference that the god of the Bible is living in you and that's what changes them when they see you change it gives them hope to be changed Hallelujah let us pray father God we come for you Lord as long we just know Lord we've been blessed tonight so many things I was blessed with inspirational words that came and just touched my soul and my heart I pray that somehow that this word has penetrated the hearts of the people and have given them understanding that they first must be straightened I must be straightened I must spend more time with you I am convicted because I have not been spending that kind of a time but the wonderful thing that I love about this Revelation is that you made me know it is your desire to be with me no matter how I look no matter how much I come short it your will to fellowship with me and you made it possible through the blood of your dear son I receive the sacrifice I receive the blood I receive the life of the blood it is my Earnest desire
