hallelujah [Music] i don't know whether you're enjoying it like i am but i am enjoying this hallelujah he he he has made me glad hallelujah nothing in this world can make me as glad as he can i'm so happy tonight to be here we'll get right on into the word of god what a blessed what a blessedness you know i was just thinking about that quote justified and i was just thinking about something i had never thought about i guess i heard another preacher said it just really stuck with me you know my inheritance have changed from the book of life to the lamb's book of life i didn't hear him say it that way but that's the way i thought and in the lamb's book of life you're justified as though you never sinned in the first place you know and you know it's like brother branham said uh you know i'm a christian and i can do what i want to do but you see the things that i love the world i don't want to do and if you're a christian and you feel like you can do whatever you want to do and then you do the things that you shouldn't be doing then something's wrong with your experience as we stand and i this is the kind of thing that i'm trying to get people to see not me i can't give you revelation i can't give you understanding but one thing for certain the bible said we ought not to be ignorant we ought to be ignorant of the times and the seasons that we're living in let us not close our eyes to the things that's happening and by the grace of god supposing it does delay a few years but at the same time you have made yourself ready remember when brother branham talks about this young girl she was already standing in the door waiting on jesus to come and that's the way i want to be i want to be standing in the door waiting for his coming you understand me we know he's come but there's another something happening that a lot of people don't see and the bride has made herself ready and so we must understand that when god came and he opened up the seals and everything else that was his first that was his coming but you see we didn't know that it would be done in almost like two parts but that's exactly what's happening you could call it it's appearing how we want to say it either way and we know that he's been here we know that god's grace through the prophet of god that was his appearing jesus christ showing himself the same yesterday today and forever and by the grace of god we understand that when he came again amen he came at a time when nobody suspected him to come even the prophet of god didn't even know he was coming but by the grace of god he did now he's among us changing our hearts changing our minds amen and and and literally transforming us into his kingdom i thank god for his grace as we stand let us turn to revelations the second chapter we come from revelations i was going to minister this i thought to minister this this morning but i just felt led to go the opposite way the other way and god has been good to us people of god there are so many people who are in this world right now and they have no idea what's going on yet we know because the bible said it will not take us as a thief in the night and this is the part that i love about it because he said because of god sent us a prophet that's the only reason now the reason why the denominational church is not in the light because they rejected the message for their day they rejected malachi 4. had they taken a hold of him they would be in much as much light as we are but it was already four days
