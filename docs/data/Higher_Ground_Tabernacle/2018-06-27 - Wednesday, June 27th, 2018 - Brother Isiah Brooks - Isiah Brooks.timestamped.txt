[10:35] the victory I was praying last night
[10:40] some of us came out to the church last
[10:43] night and we started praying around a
[10:46] third I think we got out about e na
[10:50] 10:30 or something but in in my prayer
[10:54] the Lord brought this one scripture to
[10:59] my heart and mine and at that point the
[11:02] law just really took over and I think
[11:06] God for the experience the scripture is
[11:10] Psalms 47 and 1 and that's why I sang
[11:17] that song just now God gave us the
[11:21] victory in the blood of Christ 47 I'm
[11:27] sorry did I say 40 what are they 47 yeah
[11:30] 47 and one it says Oh clap your hands
[11:33] all you people shout into God with the
[11:38] voice of triumph for the Lord Most High
[11:41] is terrible he is a king over all the
[11:45] earth and you know I just thought about
[11:48] all of the things that I've been going
[11:49] through all of the opposition's and
[11:52] things and it just seemed like God gave
[11:54] me a worshipping God gave me a praise
[11:56] and I just started praising the Lord and
[11:59] had a great time
[12:00] and I've been feeling pretty good all
[12:02] day and I thank God for him being so
[12:07] real to me when we think about it we go
[12:12] to churches and there is no Liberty they
[12:15] basically are in bondage you know we can
[12:18] shout and praise God at a football game
[12:20] or a basketball game but when it comes
[12:22] to God we're supposed to keep quiet
[12:24] so that you help knowing so I could
[12:27] remind you tonight that heaven ISM is
[12:30] the loudest place that you'll ever go
[12:32] that if you go they are shouting they're
[12:37] praising God the 24 elders are taking
[12:40] their crowns and throwing them down I
[12:42] mean I don't think it'll be a quiet
[12:45] place at all and the second loudest
[12:49] place as hell because people are
[12:52] screaming and hollering because of the
[12:55] torment hallelujah in reality as noisy
[12:59] as it can get here on earth it is the
[13:02] most quiet of three so when I get to
[13:05] heaven I can't imagine what its gonna be
[13:07] like don't expect me to keep quiet when
[13:12] I can see what God has done for me Amen

[17:58] chapter we're going to read the first v
[18:00] ed and then we'll go to first John from
[18:06] st. John to first John st. John the
[18:16] first chapter says in the beginning was
[18:19] the word and the Word was with God and
[18:22] the Word was God
[18:25] the same was in the beginning with God
[18:27] all things were made by him and without
[18:31] him was not anything made that was made
[18:34] in him was life and the life was the
[18:38] light of men and the light shine ahthe
[18:42] and darkness and the darkness
[18:44] comprehended it not first John first
[18:48] John three beginning at the 18th verse
[19:02] here is Jesus praying and he's praying
[19:07] to the Father and he's saying as thou
[19:10] has sent me into the world even so have
[19:14] I also sent them into the world who is
[19:18] dim and for their sakes i sanctify
[19:21] myself that they also might be
[19:25] sanctified through the truth what is
[19:28] truth neither pray I for these alone but
[19:32] for them also which shall believe on me
[19:36] through their word that they all may be
[19:40] one as thou father art in me and I in
[19:45] thee that they also may be one in us
[19:49] that the world may believe that thou has
[19:51] sent me and the glory which dog gave me
[19:56] I have given them that they may be one
[19:59] even as we are one I in them thou in me
[20:06] that they may be made perfect in one and
[20:10] that the world may know that thou has
[20:13] sent me and has loved me as thou has
[20:16] loved excuse me and loved them as thou
[20:19] has loved me father I will that they
[20:23] also whom thou has given me be with me
[20:26] where I am that they may behold my glory
[20:29] which thou has given me for thou loveth
[20:33] me before the foundation of the world
[20:38] a man so we thank God for His amazing
[20:42] grace
[20:43] we like to entitle our message tonight
[20:47] it may sound a little strange to you
[20:50] living thoughts in a living book living
[20:55] thoughts in a living book fathers we
[21:00] pray once again we pray that you bless
[21:03] the reading of this word make it live to
[21:07] the hearer that he will be able to hear
[21:10] more than just a man speaking but by his
[21:14] spirit he may understand that thou art
[21:16] your word you are your word and your
[21:18] word is you Lord we take this message
[21:22] personally that when we leave out of
[21:25] here we'll no longer that you have
[21:27] spoken to our hearts in a great way
[21:30] bless us now and your lovely name Jesus
[21:33] Christ we pray amen you may be seated
[21:37] [Music]
[21:42] one of the thoughts that caught my mind
[21:45] today just at the end of this message I
[21:50] believe that the law was given unto me
[21:52] is that you and I must understand that
[21:56] the real you is on the inside of you and
[22:00] if you would just shut your eyes you
[22:02] could then see that there is something
[22:04] else behind the sale that's trying to
[22:07] look out there
[22:09] house that we call the body is what it
[22:12] really is the Bible calls it our
[22:14] tabernacle but nevertheless it is where
[22:17] you resides when a person died you can
[22:21] tell that whoever lived there is no
[22:24] longer living there anymore it's kind of
[22:26] like a shell it's it leaves a shell
[22:28] there but the real you have gone
[22:30] somewhere and as I was thinking as you
[22:35] have heard me say many times people
[22:38] think that when you're dead you're done
[22:40] and of course that can't be true because
[22:45] we can look throughout the nature and we
[22:48] can see that there's always a
[22:50] resurrection every tree that dies in the
[22:53] wintertime comes back up and comes alive
[22:55] and bear fruit every spring summer and
[22:59] fall it comes back to life it's a sign
[23:02] of the resurrection we know that this is
[23:06] not the end the Sun comes up early in
[23:08] the morning like a babe as a man in the
[23:10] noon day as a strong man in the evening
[23:12] time is a weak son and at the evening
[23:14] day he dies and the Sun set the darkness
[23:18] buries him but that same Sun comes up
[23:21] again it is the order of God like I was
[23:26] telling somebody the other day I said I
[23:28] wish I said how many of you can take
[23:30] this I used another symbol but I said
[23:33] what if I could take this tambourine and
[23:36] just spin it in air at no time it'll
[23:39] drop to the floor but yet we have a son
[23:42] that stays in place
[23:44] we have moon we have stars net never
[23:47] gets out of place yet they say once we
[23:50] get beyond our atmosphere there is no
[23:53] gravity then my question is what is
[23:55] holding it and what's holding everything
[23:58] in place even your body is what we call
[24:00] the Word of God when God said let there
[24:03] be even scientists will tell you that
[24:06] vibrations words are vibrations and when
[24:09] that vibration goes out it's the thing
[24:11] that keeps a rich body in contact if God
[24:15] was dead everything else would die
[24:18] because outside of God there is no God
[24:23] understand that God created time God
[24:26] created space and God occupies all time
[24:29] and space but God being that God that He
[24:35] is God the Bible said that God is a
[24:36] living thing he's a living spirit he's a
[24:38] spirit the Bible says no man of seeing
[24:41] God at any time we get will see the Ten
[24:45] Commandment we see Moses go up on the
[24:47] mountain and Moses in the drama said I
[24:49] came down and I I seen the face of God
[24:53] but remember a man that God is a spirit
[24:56] in God as we would say he is he more
[24:58] faith he's one that changes masks when
[25:03] you see the pillar of fire you don't see
[25:05] God you see the house that God is in
[25:08] when you see the pillow cloud it's not
[25:11] that God is a cloud
[25:12] God is hiding behind the cloud or
[25:14] clothed behind the cloud God is such a
[25:19] wonder I was told the Bible said that
[25:22] God man can't think like God because
[25:24] amen God's thoughts of so much higher
[25:27] than ours I sometimes wonder how God can
[25:32] hear me and you at the same time the
[25:35] Bible says that God even knows every
[25:37] number of your hairs on your head he
[25:39] knows more than me because I've never
[25:40] been able to count them but nevertheless
[25:43] when we look at how magnificent God is
[25:46] he's a wonder you and I know by God's
[25:52] grace that our thought a word is a
[25:55] thought express before you say a word
[25:59] you think the word a lot of time to use
[26:02] what I didn't mean to say that but you
[26:03] thought it therefore it came out of your
[26:05] mouth so in reality there is a truth to
[26:09] the things you say understand by God's
[26:14] grace because God is a spirit and it's
[26:19] difficult to describe but I said like
[26:22] this he's a fountain of life a fountain
[26:27] of virtues but this
[26:31] Oh God decided he wanted to create
[26:34] something he wanted to create a creation
[26:40] that he himself that could become could
[26:42] become part uh that's a mighty thing
[26:46] it's not only just just just laying out
[26:49] a drama but it's actually becoming part
[26:51] of the drama and that's what God has
[26:54] done for us people look at this Bible
[26:58] and as I said you can burn this Bible
[26:59] because you never you can never thought
[27:01] of this Bible you can never burn the
[27:04] words of this Bible because the Word of
[27:06] God is spirit the reason why God put it
[27:10] on the pages so that you and I and our
[27:13] little carnal birdbrain Minds could
[27:18] understand him how can God do such a
[27:23] thing he can take the same word and give
[27:26] it to give it to you in French and
[27:28] English in Spanish and whatever more he
[27:30] wants to do God knows how to make
[27:32] himself known but here God in the
[27:36] beginning was the word in the word like
[27:38] we read was God before God before there
[27:42] was a word he had a thought and when he
[27:47] had a thought he spoke let there be
[27:52] somebody said well
[27:54] this world has to be older than 6,000
[27:57] years or 7,000 years where the Bible
[27:59] said God created the heavens in the
[28:02] earth period and in that statement he
[28:05] never tells us how long it took but when
[28:08] God begins to fall and then recreate the
[28:13] disaster that was now on the earth
[28:15] because the Bible said it was the earth
[28:17] was without form and void and understand
[28:19] God as a perfectionist he never would
[28:22] have created a earth boy you must
[28:27] understand that God is a perfectionist
[28:29] he never would have made us sinners and
[28:35] the same being that caused the
[28:38] devastation in the beginning is the same
[28:40] being who calls us to be sinners we
[28:44] found ourselves void we found how cells
[28:49] they met out of shape and how to fall
[28:51] not knowing who we are where we came
[28:53] from and where we to go and then God
[28:55] said by the gospel let there be light so
[29:00] you know even God loves worship he loves
[29:04] praise he has Seraphim he has a cherubim
[29:08] he had off the angels he had two living
[29:10] creatures he had all kinds of beings
[29:12] worshipping Him because remember he's
[29:14] hello him that means self-existing one
[29:16] he cannot be God except there be
[29:18] something to worship Him so he created
[29:21] all these things but he wasn't satisfied
[29:23] there was more of God he wanted
[29:28] something in His image and his likeness
[29:30] now I'm telling you something that was
[29:32] all his thoughts at one time it wasn't
[29:35] material it was all thoughts I believe
[29:42] my
[29:43] knows what I'm talking about cuz in his
[29:45] nature he's the creator he likes to
[29:47] create things and he likes to think he's
[29:49] like to put things on paper and then
[29:51] he's got somebody else who can help him
[29:52] out on this side of the of the page but
[29:55] it all begins with the thought you said
[29:59] whole principles were you saying listen
[30:01] without this electricity somebody said
[30:03] this thing can be useful to mankind a
[30:06] crazy man by the name of Benjamin
[30:08] Franklin he saw electricity such a power
[30:14] he said that could be harnessed and
[30:17] while he was out there in the rain and
[30:20] everything else trying to harness East a
[30:22] you know what people were doing looking
[30:23] through the mirror or the glass of their
[30:25] house you know he's local you know but
[30:28] in reality he had a vision there was a
[30:31] thought there was something that made
[30:33] him know this thing is possible and
[30:36] usually when you are in a place that you
[30:40] can see something that somebody else
[30:41] can't see they call you crazy oh yeah we
[30:48] were riding Orville say we can fly and
[30:55] you know they thought they were crazy
[30:56] but they had a vision they had some
[31:00] thought came to their mind to say if the
[31:02] birds can fly there's got to be a way we
[31:05] can build something that can make man
[31:09] fly and look what it's doing now I'm
[31:12] sure we're with it all and never thought
[31:14] about it going this far no he would I'm
[31:18] saying I'm saying your thoughts and the
[31:22] reason why we can think the way we think
[31:24] because we were made in the image and
[31:26] likeness of God even though we're
[31:27] falling hello even in the fallen state
[31:31] of mankind we still are in the image and
[31:35] likeness of God because we are little
[31:37] creators but mind you even when God
[31:47] thought about us he saw the enemy this
[31:50] is a lot of stories I can't tell you
[31:51] everything but I'm just throwing things
[31:53] at you when God created Lucifer Lucifer
[31:55] was a great angel of God
[31:57] almost God's right he was God's
[31:58] right-hand man but inside Lucifer
[32:00] Lucifer thought instead of being a
[32:02] creature he can be the Creator he wanted
[32:05] to be like the Creator and Lucifer
[32:08] preached so many whatever God doesn't
[32:10] say how long he preached but he was able
[32:11] to sway a great portion of the heaven
[32:14] and that's what we call demons and you
[32:17] and I realized by the grace of God the
[32:19] battle didn't stop in heaven he came
[32:21] down to the earth now the battle is a
[32:23] ray in the Garden of Eden and Adam
[32:27] forfeited his inheritance by disobeying
[32:31] the Word of God right and that's how
[32:33] Lucifer or Satan came into the human
[32:36] race and believe you leave your part of
[32:39] him until you got converted that's why
[32:44] they're calling these little kids little
[32:46] demons I heard somebody did that little
[32:48] demon call their own child a little
[32:50] demon and reality when you're not
[32:54] converted you're nothing less than
[32:56] because you have no power to do
[32:58] righteous let me move on and when you
[33:02] seen God saw his enemy and saw what he
[33:05] was gonna do God amen I love this
[33:08] because you got to understand God if he
[33:12] was self-existing one he was the only
[33:14] creator he could think what he wanted to
[33:17] think and still was right and everything
[33:19] God think is right is holy and God
[33:23] wanted to be a redeemer but before he
[33:25] could be Redeemer he had to be there had
[33:27] to be somebody lost God wanted to be
[33:29] worship he wanted somebody in his own
[33:31] image and before he could do that he had
[33:33] to create somebody in his own image and
[33:35] remember in the garden there Adam was
[33:39] the god of the earth he was the one Amen
[33:43] that did everything and he spoke the
[33:45] word and the animals obeyed him he named
[33:47] the animals until today we're still
[33:50] calling the pig a pig and when he
[33:55] thought it then he spoke it you said
[33:58] well where you going with this brother
[33:59] books I'm not trying to be deep tonight
[34:01] I'm just trying to give you something
[34:03] I'm trying to tell you this that you are
[34:05] the living thoughts of God
[34:10] no that's what you are you are the
[34:13] living thoughts of God so I can hurry up
[34:16] a little bit you and I must understand
[34:20] that Mary who we call the mother of
[34:22] Jesus was prophesied by a prophet that a
[34:26] virgin shall conceive was it four
[34:30] hundred maybe to eight hundred years
[34:31] before it ever happened but what it was
[34:36] a prophet called the mind of God and out
[34:40] of his mouth came a virgin tell conceive
[34:43] now guess what everybody thought he was
[34:46] crazy because never have they seen a
[34:50] virgin conceived that was not the order
[34:53] a reproduction hallelujah he said what
[34:57] do you mean even when Mary conceived
[35:00] Joseph found it hard to believe is that
[35:03] right but what was it it was God living
[35:08] word that word was laying right there
[35:10] and mind you there was more than Mary
[35:14] she wasn't the only virgin than
[35:16] Bethlehem or near Bethlehem of Jerusalem
[35:18] she wasn't the only one but she was the
[35:20] one that God had in his mind when she
[35:25] whipped amen
[35:26] to find her get some water that day
[35:28] guess what happened as I brother said
[35:31] and I'm not go preach a message but
[35:33] tying and promise came together and he
[35:37] was married
[35:38] it meant confronted by an angel right
[35:41] why the word was always living the word
[35:44] can't die he cannot fail whether we like
[35:47] it or not
[35:48] the word has said we're living in
[35:50] dangerous time which are called perilous
[35:52] times we never knew it was going to be
[35:54] this bad but the Bible said it would be
[35:57] now we're here right so we look at the
[36:02] stay and marry a man comes along and the
[36:04] angel said you're gonna conceive and
[36:05] that which a that that will be conceived
[36:07] in you is of the Holy Ghost and Mary
[36:11] says how how can these things be I don't
[36:12] know no man but he said the Holy Ghost
[36:16] he shall overshadow you he
[36:20] for this child is that right it was in
[36:23] Mary that God will not only created the
[36:26] egg but God created the germ of life
[36:29] hallelujah can I say like this it was
[36:32] not part of mirror had been part of Mary
[36:34] in the placenta it was not part of
[36:37] Joseph had it been part of Joseph it
[36:39] would have been a sinner but the Bible
[36:41] said God created himself a body and
[36:43] Jesus Christ was made out of the blood
[36:45] of God so Mary becomes a incubator or
[36:50] Syrian mother I know that's not worth
[36:53] being pleased but that's the truth we
[36:56] look at these things and you say brother
[36:58] boots living thoughts Who am I all I say
[37:03] to you that by but the Bible tells me
[37:04] the Jeremias God said Jim I said
[37:06] Jeremiah I knew before he was formed in
[37:08] your mother's womb
[37:09] I call you to be a prophet right so my
[37:13] point is Jeremiah before he was in his
[37:17] mother's womb where were you hallelujah
[37:23] you were somewhere because he was a
[37:25] thought and what we call an attribute of
[37:28] God that if if you are redeemable right
[37:33] because there are those who are not
[37:35] redeemable correct the Bible said Jacob
[37:38] I love and Esau I hate and everybody
[37:41] said well God is love
[37:43] but God is a consuming fire too and
[37:46] there are some who God do not love
[37:49] because they are not here's a long story
[37:52] but the Bible tells us in first John
[37:54] three one two three and I hope you're
[37:56] being blessed I'm trying to get us to
[37:58] see something there's something going on
[38:00] we are now according to the scripture we
[38:04] are now getting ready to embrace the
[38:07] coming of Moses and Elijah not the bride
[38:10] but the Jews but right in between that
[38:14] we call it the Feast of the trumpets and
[38:16] right in there there's a rapture there's
[38:19] a changing of the body there's a
[38:20] changing of dimension to escape this
[38:23] world and people knows nothing about it
[38:26] churches are not preaching it people are
[38:29] not aware of it but there are a few
[38:31] people like Enoch about
[38:34] said Enoch walked with God and he was
[38:36] found not he was translated you say
[38:40] ain't no such thing well is it's amazing
[38:42] like I was telling somebody I said
[38:44] science has become the god of this age
[38:46] better rather believe it meant that some
[38:49] alien dropped in down there and in
[38:52] where's in Mexico somewhere Amen now we
[38:58] got all our technology for some foreign
[39:01] alien stuff yeah that's nonsense
[39:06] that's nonsense
[39:09] the Bible tells us what it is the Bible
[39:11] said in the last days they shall
[39:13] increase in knowledge the Bible tells us
[39:16] amen that they'll be running there be
[39:19] they were also riding in chariot a
[39:22] horses without chariots which we call
[39:24] cars the Bible tows told us Amen that
[39:29] when Israel will go back to his home man
[39:31] that she would fly in honor Eagles wing
[39:34] was the Eagle way playing say see they
[39:38] could only call it by what they saw it
[39:41] as being they didn't know what to call
[39:42] it but these prophets who were able to
[39:44] catch the mind of God was able to bring
[39:46] it down and write it in the word form so
[39:49] we can get an idea what's going on
[39:51] that's why people don't understand they
[39:53] looking at Israelites at all why is it
[39:56] wise ever I've been to Israel it's one
[39:57] of the most holiest places you ever want
[39:59] to go my wife and I we had such a
[40:00] wonderful time the food was good the
[40:02] people was good of course you got sin
[40:04] everywhere but one thing I know about
[40:06] Israel the presence of God was there
[40:09] look what he says where I were you let
[40:12] me go back to that thought where were
[40:14] you before you came here we say what
[40:17] Brotherhood I was in my mother's womb
[40:19] for nine months but where were you
[40:20] before then you were somewhere it just
[40:25] didn't happen
[40:26] you didn't evolve in your mother's womb
[40:30] some think somewhere that's why I try to
[40:33] tell people just like you came here you
[40:36] got to leave here and everybody knows
[40:40] people died right so let me tell you
[40:44] something let me ask you well you were
[40:46] born in this world
[40:48] you came by way of a birth no alien drop
[40:52] you off no plane or spaceship
[40:55] hallelujah your grandmama was not a
[40:59] monkey or chimpanzee
[41:02] that's nonsense but God said and it was
[41:08] so now God declared to us that Jeremiah
[41:15] was somewhere before he came here
[41:20] the scripture tells us that you were
[41:22] wonderfully fashioned in your mother's
[41:24] womb by who God your hair color your eye
[41:29] color your skin color everything that
[41:31] you don't like about you
[41:32] was formed and shaped by God you
[41:36] understand me
[41:37] so I say this by the grace of God we
[41:41] know where we were we traveled we were
[41:46] in that great-grandfather Levi was in
[41:50] Abraham and it goes on and on and on and
[41:53] on that because you like and standard
[41:56] every God is chosen and elected you
[42:02] can't live unless God says so and you
[42:07] know I realize by God's grace I figure
[42:09] that's a million wonder I don't know how
[42:11] what the ratio is but out of a man's
[42:14] sperm there's like a million to one
[42:16] right however many it is but I thought I
[42:19] beat a million an election it doesn't
[42:26] matter which sperm get into the seed
[42:28] first or the egg first we're headed Irma
[42:31] ties it goes by elect God say you're the
[42:37] one and you're the one that comes forth
[42:43] hmm I'm saying all of these things so
[42:46] you can understand that you as an
[42:48] individual was not a chance
[42:51] you didn't come here by chance
[42:54] God ordained it
[42:59] it doesn't matter if your mom and your
[43:02] daddy do it you know from a prostitute
[43:04] or whatever the case may be it's God who
[43:08] gave you life because he's the only life
[43:13] am i making sense but Yoona was not
[43:17] called me we didn't come here to make us
[43:20] feel better
[43:21] that's where the gospel is going wrong
[43:24] people preaching the gospel like it's
[43:27] all about man well hell if you get save
[43:30] you go look you're gonna make men better
[43:31] and heaven gonna make men better in
[43:33] heaven this is going to make men better
[43:35] that ain't it
[43:37] everything must glorify God y'all hear
[43:41] me
[43:42] everything we I was born to be a
[43:45] Christian I was born and you were born
[43:50] to testify that the unseen God is alive
[43:54] and well hallelujah
[43:57] imma getting excited here but that's the
[44:00] only reason why we were born we came
[44:04] here to show this evil age which is
[44:09] Satan's even that God is still alive and
[44:13] well you could have been born are you
[44:17] you you made it wished it well I wish I
[44:19] was born in the cowboy days you couldn't
[44:21] have been born in that day because God
[44:23] had already determined what day you were
[44:25] going to be born in usual
[44:32] God if I was in those day I would have
[44:35] heard is preaching only if you hear the
[44:37] preaching today only if you hear Jesus
[44:40] Christ was today would you have wear her
[44:42] BAE obey the Amen the voice of Noah talk
[44:47] about living thoughts even if they tried
[44:52] to destroy this brother rich brother
[44:53] Mike don't you know I got to him tonight
[44:55] Mike Mike amen don't you know Amen the
[44:58] Bible said this word is written in
[45:00] heaven so it doesn't matter how they
[45:04] compromise it people good that means
[45:08] today that where your brother are you
[45:09] crazy no I'm not I don't go with it what
[45:14] they call it the NIV version no cuz it
[45:20] takes some of the word away and God said
[45:21] the place will get you if you do that
[45:24] and then it takes some of the meaning
[45:26] some time I take the whole sentence out
[45:28] of it and then it puts some some kind of
[45:30] water down meaning in it and people
[45:31] believe that's the Word of God and all
[45:33] it's doing is causing death to the
[45:35] people you understand me only the pure
[45:39] adulterated word can produce Jesus
[45:42] Christ am I making sense
[45:47] you're alright with that
[45:48] behold what manner of love the father
[45:51] has bestowed upon us that we should be
[45:53] called the sons of God
[45:55] therefore the world knoweth us not
[45:57] because it knew him not one of the
[46:00] things that the disciples asked Jesus to
[46:04] me was one of the greater greater
[46:06] questions when he at they asked his
[46:10] father teach us how to pray and Jesus
[46:14] said our Father he didn't say I want you
[46:18] to pray my father he said our Father in
[46:22] other words he included his disciples in
[46:24] his prayer because Jesus was the first
[46:27] born the first beloved son of God
[46:30] hallelujah but guess what by the
[46:33] scripture he is my brother he is my Lord
[46:37] and he is my Savior hallelujah and he
[46:40] says beloved now are we the sons of God
[46:42] and it does not yet appear what we shall
[46:44] be
[46:45] we know that when he shall appear we
[46:48] shall be like him for we shall see him
[46:50] as he is is that right now these are
[46:55] thoughts but these thoughts are living
[46:57] because somewhere down the line somebody
[46:59] like you and me or you and I we're gonna
[47:02] read that scripture and then all of a
[47:04] sudden it becomes quickened to us it
[47:06] becomes a revelation that that's talking
[47:08] about me see Christians are not
[47:12] denominations they're not organisations
[47:16] Christians are not some great organized
[47:20] system even though the bride is
[47:21] organized
[47:22] she's our organism she's not all the
[47:25] nice thing where you don't organize God
[47:27] out of it right you got people in their
[47:30] churches say well we know because I'm of
[47:32] this decree or this this this little
[47:35] branch of this where we don't believe
[47:37] that well what does the Bible say
[47:39] whatever the Bible says that's what's
[47:41] right it doesn't matter what your Creed
[47:44] says it doesn't matter what men have
[47:46] done that's why we can't see real and
[47:49] find real Christians now because of
[47:51] min's interpretation of the scripture
[47:55] and the Bible said that the scripture is
[47:57] not given to any man's interpretation is
[48:00] that right and I say these things
[48:03] because I'm really stirred because you
[48:07] can go to these Bible bookstores and
[48:08] there's hundreds of books trying to
[48:11] explain the Bible Peter James and John
[48:16] the Bible says were ignorant and
[48:18] unlearned men my mother didn't know God
[48:21] by book she knew God by revelation and
[48:27] until you know God by revelation you
[48:29] really don't know him you said brother
[48:31] book some say that why am I telling you
[48:34] these things because I want you to
[48:35] understand all of your learning mean
[48:37] nothing to God when Paul came to Christ
[48:41] y'all remember Paul the Bible said Paul
[48:43] was on his way down to excuse me to
[48:47] destroy the true Christians he was going
[48:49] to Damascus to persecute the Christians
[48:51] Elijah from heaven and Paul fell from
[48:54] his horse and Paul asks a question who
[48:57] bow Lord you talk about
[48:59] a Jew that studied under Gamaliel he was
[49:03] a top-notch he said I was a straight-a
[49:05] student let me put it in our words in
[49:08] other words amen
[49:09] you can find no fault in me I did
[49:12] everything to the letter to the D but
[49:16] when I met Jesus he said I had to count
[49:19] all my learning as dung all I learned
[49:24] under the mayor's I had my doctrine of
[49:25] divinity but when I met the Lord Jesus I
[49:28] had to throw all everything out away so
[49:32] that I could learn and know him
[49:35] hallelujah see some people can't you
[49:37] know you look at these things you say
[49:38] our brother was what are you saying let
[49:39] me tell you something my momma raised me
[49:41] Baptist from the Baptist I went to the
[49:43] Methodist from the Methodists I went to
[49:45] the Catholic from the cat-lair I went to
[49:46] the Apostolic I mean and then when I got
[49:48] to that after that when I said oh my God
[49:50] where are you
[49:51] I went into prayer you know what he said
[49:55] he said I'm in my word and yet you got
[49:58] people who tells me that this Bible is
[50:01] an obsolete book totally nonsense is
[50:05] where God is hiding
[50:19] his word must have come a revelation to
[50:22] you like I said I couldn't my mom
[50:26] couldn't read it right now I'm so glad I
[50:28] had a mom like that cuz she taught me so
[50:30] much about God she couldn't read it
[50:32] right but I would read the Bible tool
[50:34] and she would say Oh glory to God she
[50:37] would enjoy and I would think my god
[50:39] this thing is so boring
[50:40] I wasn't converted I knew nothing about
[50:43] God but I had to read the Bible to her
[50:46] and she would praise the Lord like that
[50:47] I saw my mom get up was in a time when
[50:50] she was stricken by cancer and she
[50:52] wasn't supposed to get up matter of fact
[50:54] it was liver cancer she had already
[50:55] turned jaundiced eyes were yellow skin
[50:58] it turned yellow and she prayed and says
[51:02] God she said just let me go one more
[51:04] time cuz she was ready to go it's not
[51:06] that she fought to live my mom was ready
[51:07] to go and she says Lord just let me go
[51:10] to the restroom one more time and my
[51:12] sister helped her and but she got up and
[51:15] in my in my heart I said whoever her God
[51:21] is that's who I want to serve
[51:24] I saw a Living God that one the only
[51:31] time my mom would tell me she said
[51:33] Junior God is gonna do this garlic every
[51:36] time and it would happen
[51:38] there were times I just finished sinning
[51:40] doing something I had no business doing
[51:42] and my mom looked me right in the face
[51:43] as though she was there she said Junior
[51:46] you know God don't like that I said what
[51:50] ba-ba-ba-ba-ba I'll a lord as a mama you
[51:52] know I wouldn't do nothing like that but
[51:56] I was born Aniyah everybody's born
[51:59] lawyers you don't even have to tell the
[52:00] baby how to lie you don't have to teach
[52:03] a baby how to steal he lies and he steal
[52:05] because he's a fallen nature but God was
[52:09] merciful to me I'm Way off my subject
[52:11] lord have mercy but we look at this
[52:15] thing in you and I must understand and
[52:17] then you know God don't want us to
[52:19] understand him by our heads and that's
[52:23] why the serpent got Eve
[52:25] surely you know God will not you were
[52:28] not died and she be
[52:31] it was happening we're dying but God
[52:36] wants us the revelation of him to come
[52:38] from the heart I was teaching the young
[52:41] children today on David I love David
[52:44] David was a man after God's own heart
[52:46] and I think it was brother rich that
[52:48] shared this with me David was so close
[52:50] to God that God took his own David's
[52:52] prayer and his songs and made it the
[52:54] word I'm like God if I could only be
[52:58] that close to you I'll be all right and
[53:01] you look at this thing you said well one
[53:03] thing about David day was a little
[53:04] shepherd boy the Bible calls him ruddy
[53:06] you know a little cutie little cutie
[53:09] little curly-haired little maybe a
[53:10] little fine-looking guy then lucky
[53:13] had no muscles on him but he had faith
[53:16] he had experience he had something that
[53:20] his other brothers didn't have so when
[53:22] Goliath was boasting himself I'm gonna
[53:24] kill you I'm gonna do this David said
[53:26] you uncircumcised philistine you doing
[53:30] all that talking said but you come to me
[53:32] with your sword and your spirit you come
[53:34] to me with all of this man-made stuff on
[53:37] you but I've come in the name of the
[53:38] Lord the Lord of hosts
[53:40] see that's how real God must be to you
[53:44] you don't have to fear no one if they're
[53:47] not a Christian if they don't know God
[53:49] you don't have to fear them whether it
[53:51] be on your job it doesn't matter where
[53:53] you are you are the God of your kingdom
[54:03] is that right he told he told Adam to do
[54:07] everything whatever come against you
[54:09] whatever come against your kingdom you
[54:11] put it in his right place that still
[54:13] holds today who when the doctor
[54:23] my mother-in-law thinks she told her she
[54:24] was gonna die something like that y'all
[54:27] don't hurt me testify she said dick
[54:28] Jesus tell you that see if God didn't
[54:32] tell you that how you know I'm gonna die
[54:36] that's the way I look at it come on God
[54:41] said I didn't have cancer I don't have
[54:43] cancer simple as that I take what he
[54:51] says and when you take what he says he
[54:54] brings it to pass hallelujah
[54:57] see what but it comes to a real
[54:59] revelation of God see that you see it
[55:02] before it happened and express it in
[55:06] Word form that was takes a hold and
[55:10] become a material a thought Express amen
[55:15] oh my how God could see your heart and
[55:18] your mind is so filled with God's Spirit
[55:21] until your thought becomes his thoughts
[55:23] there you are when your mind and your
[55:28] leading and your guiding becomes a
[55:30] direct place or direct inspiration of
[55:33] the Holy Spirit that moves your mortal
[55:35] being what kind of a people should we be
[55:38] see the problem is we do not meditate on
[55:41] the word like we should and then when we
[55:45] read the word we think the word is for
[55:47] something else and the Bible said he
[55:49] brews 13 and 8 that Jesus Christ is the
[55:52] same yesterday today and forever
[55:55] think about it David said the Lord is my
[55:59] shepherd and I shall not want he
[56:02] prepares the table before me in the
[56:04] presence of my enemies I'm known as my
[56:09] head with all he said I'm not gonna fear
[56:10] no evil I'm not gonna fear you too
[56:13] Goliath because God is with me and when
[56:18] you know that God is only inside of you
[56:20] you may be the most oddest thing ever
[56:22] and you will be if you gonna start God
[56:25] the way he wants to be served if you're
[56:27] gonna worship him the way he wants you
[56:29] to be worshiped everybody is going to
[56:31] thank you are they gonna thank you crazy
[56:33] they're gonna think something negative
[56:35] about you they will
[56:36] say that guy is a real awesome fella
[56:40] the only way they can say that is that
[56:42] they got some God in them - is that
[56:49] right back I was telling the children
[56:52] this morning what boy or what man would
[56:55] challenge or take on a lion do you think
[56:57] these things are allegories and fictive
[56:59] for teachers stories that they put in
[57:02] the book to just give you a lesson we're
[57:04] talking about the Bible that is not only
[57:06] filled with truth but it's filled with
[57:09] history and what happened with David is
[57:13] history
[57:14] it's not some story to teach you courage
[57:17] it's not a fable it's a reality
[57:22] what's Jesus a reality absolutely did he
[57:26] turn the water and he did did he walk on
[57:29] water yes sir he raised from the dead he
[57:33] did is he living now yes sir where is he
[57:38] living only inside of us that's where
[57:43] your help come from you're helping in
[57:45] heaven your helpers in you God with you
[57:49] God in you if we can really see that you
[57:55] would become a powerhouse you would
[58:00] become invincible you remember when
[58:04] Jesus said and these words of life
[58:05] they're living jesus said if you say to
[58:08] this mountain be thou move and believe
[58:10] that it shall be done it will be done
[58:13] hallelujah what was what was Jesus
[58:16] teaching them he being the Son of God
[58:18] was only teaching his brother is how to
[58:20] be God right and people don't understand
[58:26] we the Holy Spirit is tutoring us we're
[58:29] now in training because this is not our
[58:32] home we were birthed into this world
[58:35] hallelujah we came through the fall of
[58:37] sex and sin is that right therefore
[58:41] we're now housed in a sinful body that's
[58:44] why God said unto Nicodemus Jesus said
[58:46] to Nicodemus Marvel not you must be born
[58:49] again
[58:50] flesh and blood cannot enter into the
[58:51] kingdom of God this thing he it ain't
[58:54] going nowhere
[58:55] it's got to be converted it's got to be
[58:59] changed and I'm a hurry up in just a
[59:01] moment I'm a hurry because I want you to
[59:03] see a man that this thing is a beautiful
[59:04] situation if you can see it if you can
[59:07] see that you existed in even if it was a
[59:10] thought or a attribute you were
[59:11] somewhere before you came here and I
[59:14] want to say to you that when you die
[59:16] here you're not dead and done you said
[59:21] that that yes the Bible tells me that
[59:23] when Jesus Christ was on Mount
[59:25] Transfiguration Moses and Elijah
[59:27] appeared there and they had witnesses
[59:30] Peter James and John do you believe your
[59:32] Bible hallelujah and the Bible tells me
[59:38] that in the book of Revelation who's
[59:40] coming back Moses and Elijah hallelujah
[59:45] is that right how many you can't you
[59:53] can't be who you are
[59:55] until you understand the key of life and
[59:57] this is it that's why the devil hates
[1:00:00] this book
[1:00:01] you got Muslims you got all kinds of
[1:00:05] religious art religion out here and you
[1:00:07] can find all kinds of books out here you
[1:00:09] can find all and because people want
[1:00:11] this to be a Babylon and that's what the
[1:00:14] world has become a Babylon the Bible
[1:00:18] says Spray this away narrow only few be
[1:00:22] that find it he said but that broad way
[1:00:25] everybody gonna find that by let me tell
[1:00:29] you something it's not that I'm against
[1:00:30] people no sure but if you say well I'm
[1:00:33] saved by my organization of my
[1:00:35] denomination you're lost
[1:00:37] there's only one thing one person who
[1:00:39] could save you and that is Jesus Christ
[1:00:45] we know that in this day like I was
[1:00:48] telling somebody I said you know in this
[1:00:50] day is difficult
[1:00:51] the Bible is here but what the devil did
[1:00:53] excuse me what the devil did he took the
[1:00:55] Bible out of school he took it out of
[1:00:56] everywhere he's basically taking it out
[1:00:58] of church now people don't carry their
[1:00:59] Bibles to church they got there and they
[1:01:01] go for the screen they just and you
[1:01:03] don't understand you
[1:01:04] yourself up for deception always check
[1:01:07] the preacher out always me too if I'm
[1:01:13] wrong you obligated to tell me now don't
[1:01:19] come pointing your thing in my face
[1:01:21] though I'm just an alert you with
[1:01:25] brother you know we're looking at a time
[1:01:30] in place where people are being so
[1:01:32] easily influenced by psychology and
[1:01:34] mysticism and all of that stuff when
[1:01:38] they got and God is going to ask the
[1:01:39] question see I want you to tell you
[1:01:41] something this might be a shocker
[1:01:43] nobody goes to hell for the sin that
[1:01:46] they were born in
[1:01:48] nobody people only go to hell because
[1:01:53] they reject the remedy of getting out of
[1:01:56] their sin as they say a pardon is not a
[1:02:00] pardon except to be accepted as a pardon
[1:02:04] God can pardon you all your days but if
[1:02:08] you don't accept it as your pardon it
[1:02:10] doesn't apply to you
[1:02:11] it's not applicable and you and I must
[1:02:15] realized by God's grace meant that these
[1:02:17] thoughts these this word like people you
[1:02:20] said well somebody said well how do you
[1:02:23] know that there was a flood now
[1:02:30] scientists are saying that there's
[1:02:32] evidence all over the world that there
[1:02:33] was a flood but why would you need
[1:02:36] evidence if the Bible says so they even
[1:02:40] say that now they have found that the
[1:02:42] remainings of the ark on Mount Ararat
[1:02:44] and I wonder who carried it up there
[1:02:49] hallelujah is just when the flood
[1:02:52] subsided God allowed the ark to remain
[1:02:57] there as a memorial y'all hear what I'm
[1:03:00] saying people say what are you saying
[1:03:03] the Bible tells us as it was in the days
[1:03:06] of Noah and as it was in the days of
[1:03:08] Sodom so shall it be nobody knew that
[1:03:10] the world was going to be as wicked as
[1:03:12] it is now people are so liberal they
[1:03:15] think oh you can do just what you want
[1:03:17] to do
[1:03:17] you care but you'll never make heaven
[1:03:20] that way every one of us nature's must
[1:03:23] be changed is that right the Bible tells
[1:03:26] us that Nicodemus who was a Pharisee
[1:03:28] came to God by night and says rabbi we
[1:03:31] know that thou art teacher come from God
[1:03:35] right because we know that no man can do
[1:03:40] these things except God sent him and
[1:03:42] then Jesus introduced a new theology to
[1:03:46] him he said Nicodemus I'll tell you you
[1:03:48] must be born again and Nicodemus said
[1:03:52] unto him how can this thing be can I
[1:03:54] enter into my mother's womb once again
[1:03:56] and be born he says Marvel not Nicodemus
[1:03:58] that which is his flesh is flesh and
[1:04:01] that which is spirit is spirit
[1:04:02] is that right we came into this world in
[1:04:05] the flesh when we leave out it as well
[1:04:08] you go into another world in the spirit
[1:04:15] right so that you understand because of
[1:04:18] the fall as our brother said the other
[1:04:21] day we were born into death in other
[1:04:25] words we laid up in our mother's womb
[1:04:26] for nine months
[1:04:28] but when that time came that womb had to
[1:04:30] die and you had to get out of there
[1:04:32] right then you come out and you come
[1:04:35] into a world and you know there used to
[1:04:37] be a time you had to spank the babies a
[1:04:38] man to make him breathe but now they're
[1:04:41] so educated it's so smart now when they
[1:04:46] come out they come out differently
[1:04:48] crying and everything else all right
[1:04:52] because the Bible said there be weaker
[1:04:54] and wiser ya'll don't remember this some
[1:04:58] of y'all because you're not as old as I
[1:05:00] am maybe some of y'all but anyhow the
[1:05:02] point is I can remember when a woman
[1:05:04] would have a baby she stay in the house
[1:05:05] for a whole month wouldn't even let the
[1:05:08] lights hit her face I don't know what
[1:05:12] kind of traditional thing that was but
[1:05:13] that's the truth
[1:05:14] because we got spankings for being
[1:05:17] disobedient but my point is I'm bringing
[1:05:20] you to a place and I don't spent a lot
[1:05:22] of time saying things trying to get you
[1:05:24] to see something here we starts that
[1:05:27] we're talking about this this this Bible
[1:05:31] correct every bit of it it doesn't
[1:05:35] contradict itself and in the places
[1:05:37] where it looked like it contradicts it
[1:05:39] needs a revelation something God is
[1:05:41] hiding from the intellectual man you
[1:05:46] look through the four Gospels and each
[1:05:49] one of these Gospels Matthew Mark Luke
[1:05:51] and John sometimes tell stories
[1:05:53] differently but at the same time they
[1:05:56] telling the same story and what people
[1:05:59] don't understand is you've got - you got
[1:06:00] posts you got a post here you got a post
[1:06:02] here you got a post here you got a post
[1:06:04] here like the four living creatures but
[1:06:07] each one of them are seeing God from a
[1:06:09] different angle is that right Matthew
[1:06:13] which represents he is the king Matthew
[1:06:16] tell you about Jesus Christ being the
[1:06:17] king Matthew represents Amen that lion
[1:06:21] face you understand me
[1:06:24] hello Luke represents the face of the
[1:06:28] man John represents the face of the
[1:06:31] eagle right he's John John takes the
[1:06:33] word in the beginning was the word and
[1:06:35] the Word was with God he goes all the
[1:06:37] way to the beginning and then he brings
[1:06:39] us up to Jesus Christ and said that word
[1:06:41] was made flesh is that right and we
[1:06:44] beheld his glory as the only begotten of
[1:06:46] the Father full of grace and truth
[1:06:48] then mark amen shows us how Jesus will
[1:06:51] gonna be crucified he is that ox right
[1:06:55] he's the ox shows him how he's gonna be
[1:06:57] crucified and slain for mankind but if
[1:07:01] you don't know these four Gospels you
[1:07:04] will never understand the book of Acts
[1:07:06] because these four gospel block you they
[1:07:11] are the four living creatures that keeps
[1:07:14] you away from the Tree of Life and if
[1:07:17] you don't see Mark Luke and John and
[1:07:19] Matthew and how they work together to
[1:07:21] keep that keep that intellectual man
[1:07:23] that man who reasons and think with his
[1:07:25] mind away from the book of Acts because
[1:07:27] you see the book of Acts is the
[1:07:29] foundation of the church and what people
[1:07:32] say about the book of Acts is that we
[1:07:34] don't need that anymore and that is not
[1:07:36] the way God operates anymore we're just
[1:07:39] too smart for that
[1:07:40] and yet the whole time we're filling up
[1:07:44] the
[1:07:45] pillows with sick people when the book
[1:07:48] of Acts the church prayed and laid hands
[1:07:51] and they were healed you see what I'm
[1:07:54] saying see nobody healed me but God when
[1:07:58] the doctor wanted to give me a worse
[1:07:59] case of scenario and everything else and
[1:08:01] tried to tell me that this cancer is
[1:08:03] moving all into my bones and all that
[1:08:05] kind of stuff
[1:08:05] God says no the doctor says yes and God
[1:08:11] said no but if I was like everybody else
[1:08:16] right in there and I'm not against
[1:08:17] doctors but there come a time ain't man
[1:08:20] when a doctor don't know what else to do
[1:08:22] but God knows hallelujah and as we've
[1:08:28] said in this in this assembly we've seen
[1:08:31] the Lord Jesus Christ it's more than a
[1:08:34] thought is living now why because the
[1:08:36] Word of God is now in you and you are
[1:08:39] the expression of God for this day
[1:08:41] hallelujah you are the ones when when
[1:08:45] those things that are impossible or seem
[1:08:48] impossible you are not called those
[1:08:50] things that be not as though they were
[1:08:51] you understand me hallelujah it is what
[1:08:59] it is so we come in this last day and we
[1:09:03] see you can't change yourself I couldn't
[1:09:09] change myself but I know in order to get
[1:09:12] to heaven we must have a change we can't
[1:09:18] go there like this no you're not to
[1:09:22] blame for your condition God do not look
[1:09:24] at you and say where's your fault he
[1:09:26] doesn't
[1:09:27] but when Calvary when Jesus Christ who
[1:09:30] died for you when it's presented to you
[1:09:32] and you don't accept that then if you're
[1:09:35] the blame you can't say god I didn't
[1:09:38] know because it's so simple that God is
[1:09:42] offering you and I eternal life not
[1:09:45] because how good you are what family
[1:09:47] name you came from it's the grace of God
[1:09:49] and then when we accept Christ as our
[1:09:53] Savior we don't stop there it's like a
[1:09:56] baby being conceived and the mothers
[1:09:58] will retain
[1:09:58] baby is just potential it's not a son
[1:10:01] yet it's just potential but that baby
[1:10:04] has to stay there for nine months
[1:10:07] potentially you know what I'm saying
[1:10:08] being healthy and normal in the normal
[1:10:10] scenario it stays there for nine months
[1:10:12] but then that baby has another trauma he
[1:10:15] has to go through he has to agonize he
[1:10:17] has to travail a meant to come out of
[1:10:19] that that woman's womb into this world
[1:10:22] and in order for you to get to heaven
[1:10:24] that takes it to a veil they take an
[1:10:26] agonizing denying of yourself
[1:10:29] to get up out of here but it's all worth
[1:10:33] it
[1:10:33] I'm sure if that baby could talk you
[1:10:36] could never convince him they ever go
[1:10:37] back into that mother's womb and that's
[1:10:42] what happened to a real Christian the
[1:10:44] womb of this earth begins to get too
[1:10:47] small for us and then we desire to go
[1:10:50] home and you and I know that we're
[1:10:55] getting ready for a break something's
[1:10:57] about to happen and I'm closing on this
[1:11:00] remember that God always sends a warning
[1:11:02] before he sends judgment he gave Noah a
[1:11:07] sign says no it's gonna rain and it
[1:11:09] didn't rain four hundred and twenty
[1:11:11] years people make mockery they laugh at
[1:11:12] it just like they do the translation of
[1:11:14] Christians they laugh at and say it
[1:11:16] ain't gonna happen
[1:11:18] hallelujah but God told told us are
[1:11:22] serving him here's one time he said I
[1:11:24] want you to go down there and preach
[1:11:25] down the Sodom because I'm gonna send
[1:11:27] fire from heaven but you know that
[1:11:29] sounds funny because if you look up you
[1:11:31] couldn't see no fire happening there
[1:11:32] well in the days of Noah you can see no
[1:11:34] rain either but when God began to say
[1:11:37] something that exactly what he means and
[1:11:38] it happens anyway you see I'm saying
[1:11:40] these things because everybody think
[1:11:42] that the world is gonna last forever
[1:11:43] Doug don't ever think it it's one more
[1:11:48] stage the world has to go through the
[1:11:51] world went through the water baptism in
[1:11:53] Noah's day the world went through
[1:11:55] sanctification in Jesus day when the
[1:11:57] blood of Jesus Christ hit the earth is
[1:11:59] sanctified everyone that was going to
[1:12:02] come from the dust of the earth that's
[1:12:04] why I tell people you don't go to hell
[1:12:05] because of you were born a sinner you go
[1:12:07] to hell because you won't receive Jesus
[1:12:09] Christ as your Savior and they said well
[1:12:12] doesn't exist well I don't want to go
[1:12:14] there to find out this is not a hell
[1:12:21] brimstone situation
[1:12:23] the Bible said God so loved the world
[1:12:26] that He gave His only begotten Son he
[1:12:27] loved the world
[1:12:30] my brother said were you serving a god
[1:12:33] that's gonna make you serve Him no God
[1:12:39] didn't threaten me to serve him either I
[1:12:42] choose to serve God when I chose to
[1:12:48] serve God I lost almost all my friends
[1:12:52] or what I thought was friends but there
[1:12:56] has never been anything that'll make me
[1:12:57] turn my head to say I just wish I was
[1:12:59] never Christian it was the best thing
[1:13:02] that ever happened to me in my life does
[1:13:04] it make me perfect no I'm perfect at his
[1:13:07] sight but in your sight I would never be
[1:13:10] perfect you understand me but let me
[1:13:14] move on in closing God took our people
[1:13:18] and they told that it was going to rain
[1:13:19] they didn't want to believe it now it
[1:13:21] rained and I could take the scriptures
[1:13:23] I'm jumping because I don't intend to go
[1:13:26] too much longer but we find out by God's
[1:13:28] grace amen
[1:13:29] they didn't believe but it didn't stop
[1:13:31] the rain remember the time that jesus
[1:13:34] told his disciples in the New Testament
[1:13:35] he said when you see the army Army's
[1:13:38] uncomfortable Jerusalem he said I want
[1:13:41] you to flee don't go back he said don't
[1:13:43] take nothing with you run to the
[1:13:45] mountains and don't look back that was
[1:13:47] Titus Jesus saw Titus prophesied that
[1:13:50] Titus God was going to come and he was
[1:13:53] going to destroy Jerusalem and he was
[1:13:55] going to also kill Jerusalem and did you
[1:13:58] know in those days those Jews was shut
[1:14:01] in blocked in and barricaded by by Titus
[1:14:05] so much so they began to eat their
[1:14:07] children hello oh yeah they did it in
[1:14:11] the end of time of King Solomon
[1:14:14] when famine and everything came they
[1:14:16] began to eat their children
[1:14:19] cannibalism is not something that just
[1:14:21] started men do wicked things because if
[1:14:25] they don't have
[1:14:26] God what is it and you and I understand
[1:14:31] we are animals we become like animals
[1:14:34] that's why people are crazy now because
[1:14:36] they don't have God people killing
[1:14:38] people who ravishing people doing all
[1:14:40] kinds of stuff and our society is
[1:14:42] becoming so lawless and then that nobody
[1:14:44] can be justified you go to a Kate have a
[1:14:48] case and they throw it out because of
[1:14:50] this and because it happens you have a
[1:14:51] little bit of money see the only true
[1:14:54] lawyer you could ever have on your side
[1:14:56] is God so we living in this day and they
[1:15:01] says oh oh
[1:15:02] people say well America is not in the
[1:15:04] book of Revelation
[1:15:06] book of Revelation the 13 chapters where
[1:15:08] America is found she was born under 13
[1:15:11] stripes 13 states right I mean in United
[1:15:16] she comes up that like a little lamb you
[1:15:18] know and what was it in that day and
[1:15:21] time the Buffalo when it's a child or a
[1:15:23] baby it looks just like a lamb comes up
[1:15:25] like a lamb but at the end of the day it
[1:15:28] roars like a light like a dragon look at
[1:15:30] us with bullying every nation there is
[1:15:35] and what people don't understand is that
[1:15:37] we've got a bomb aimed at us do you
[1:15:41] think America is going to continue to
[1:15:43] exist the way we are making mockery of
[1:15:48] God in every form of fashion everything
[1:15:52] that God condemns they override it and
[1:15:55] say it's okay to do do you really think
[1:15:58] God is going to sink a city call
[1:16:00] Charlotte Lamar it's right under the
[1:16:02] Dead Sea still to this day do you think
[1:16:05] God would flood a whole world amen
[1:16:08] because of their evil doing and expect
[1:16:09] America to continue on I guess what let
[1:16:13] me tell you like this to bring it up to
[1:16:14] date we're right at the translation
[1:16:17] Israel is already a nation she's already
[1:16:20] out training her her her temple guards
[1:16:24] and everything else she's getting ready
[1:16:26] for our own coming Messiah and while
[1:16:30] everybody in the world saying
[1:16:31] Christianity is not the way but nobody's
[1:16:33] not bothers the Muslims or the Islamic
[1:16:36] so whatever ever they let him go do
[1:16:38] whatever
[1:16:38] want to do a Christianity they stamp you
[1:16:40] down ah because the devil don't want the
[1:16:44] world to know the truth and you and I
[1:16:47] must understand that because everybody
[1:16:49] call themselves Christians they are not
[1:16:50] a true Christian is born by the love of
[1:16:55] God I don't care what brand a person is
[1:17:00] if they say they Christian they're
[1:17:01] Christians there will be judges
[1:17:05] Christians and Who am I to say they're
[1:17:08] not there's a lot of people who don't
[1:17:11] call what we call the message they're
[1:17:13] Christians but they say they are see my
[1:17:16] point is I must display Christ and
[1:17:23] everything I do I'm hard on myself some
[1:17:27] days I go home and I'm I'm really
[1:17:29] feeling terrible because I feel like I
[1:17:31] was weak in this area or didn't show God
[1:17:33] in this area my whole thought pat him
[1:17:36] during the day is about Jesus Christ and
[1:17:39] not me and I look at this thing and I
[1:17:43] said here we are about ready to America
[1:17:45] everybody has the destruction button in
[1:17:47] their hand and nobody sees it
[1:17:51] we're talking about a world war 3 but
[1:17:53] nobody sees it
[1:17:54] Putin says I'm ready to push it North
[1:17:58] Korea says I'm I beat you to it I'm I'm
[1:18:00] badder than you boy I want to push it
[1:18:03] then we got our Trump he says I want to
[1:18:05] push it you gotta understand me these
[1:18:08] leaders have no control of what's
[1:18:10] happening to them and fulfilling the
[1:18:14] word the last baptism that this world
[1:18:19] must get and that's what people don't
[1:18:21] understand every Christian must have a
[1:18:23] fire baptism
[1:18:25] you must have an experience with the
[1:18:28] Holy Ghost and that Holy Ghost is to
[1:18:30] burn every sinful desire out of you
[1:18:33] hallelujah
[1:18:35] just like the world when it takes that
[1:18:37] fire baptism you say brother Brooks you
[1:18:39] really off on your rocker did God
[1:18:41] destroy the world with water the Bible
[1:18:44] said he was going to destroy the world
[1:18:46] right he destroyed everything that lived
[1:18:49] on the world but the world kept his
[1:18:51] framework
[1:18:54] hallelujah when God comes into your
[1:18:57] heart he destroys everything but you
[1:19:00] keep your framework when I get to heaven
[1:19:03] ain't gonna look like somebody else I'm
[1:19:06] gonna look like me and you're gonna look
[1:19:10] like you but if you don't realize that
[1:19:14] we're right at the end of this thing
[1:19:17] most people are not attracted this kind
[1:19:20] of preaching but I will not stand before
[1:19:23] God teaching a lie being a deceiver and
[1:19:33] I always think to myself Lord about the
[1:19:34] wall by myself let it be so because I
[1:19:39] know the time is so short everybody
[1:19:42] don't eat do you know what's happening
[1:19:44] over in Israel why people are hating and
[1:19:45] wise like that while you got the Arabs
[1:19:47] against the Jews that's been a war
[1:19:49] that's been fought for thousands of
[1:19:51] years we at the end of it now the
[1:19:54] Messiah soon to come when our president
[1:19:57] and they just moved everything over
[1:19:59] there
[1:19:59] you know Jerusalem to declare in
[1:20:02] Jerusalem is the capital what do you
[1:20:03] think that is that's not some childish
[1:20:05] stuff that's reality it's in the book
[1:20:09] why would his name be Trump when they're
[1:20:14] right now about ready to experience
[1:20:16] their Feast of the trumpets God
[1:20:19] gathering and bringing all the Jews back
[1:20:21] to their homeland and you can find it in
[1:20:23] the word never ever is happening for
[1:20:25] people scattered all the world over the
[1:20:27] world and then come back to their own
[1:20:28] land
[1:20:29] speaking the same language one language
[1:20:32] and here we are in America thinking
[1:20:35] because it looked like we're not in the
[1:20:37] book but you see what's happening is
[1:20:38] we're gonna be blown to bits everything
[1:20:43] is going to go mount st. Helen it will
[1:20:46] erupt Yellowstone will erupt California
[1:20:52] will sink and I ask you the question
[1:20:54] where is your hiding place
[1:21:00] oh it's so much let us start I would
[1:21:10] therefore put you in remembrance though
[1:21:13] you once knew this that how that the
[1:21:14] Lord having saved the people out of the
[1:21:16] land of Egypt after which destroyed them
[1:21:19] that believed not and though there were
[1:21:22] millions of Jews that League Live Israel
[1:21:25] millions of them that left out of Egypt
[1:21:28] in that generation only two of the of
[1:21:32] the generations crossed over into the
[1:21:34] promised land
[1:21:35] because they were so disobedient and so
[1:21:38] disrespectful that God swore that they
[1:21:41] would not enter into his rest and if you
[1:21:44] look up there that word about how God
[1:21:47] said that he would not the Bible tells
[1:21:48] us according to Hebrew they were
[1:21:49] internally lost Joshua and Caleb made it
[1:21:53] over with the new generation in the days
[1:21:58] of Enoch there was only one man that was
[1:22:01] saved in the days of Noah there was only
[1:22:03] eight souls saved if they were eight
[1:22:05] million that meant one out of a million
[1:22:07] because nobody takes he was an
[1:22:09] intellectual age like this everybody had
[1:22:11] science computer and everything else
[1:22:13] that keep us so busy that we don't have
[1:22:15] no time for God I give God a little bit
[1:22:18] of my time but anyway let's move on
[1:22:23] remember height the Bible said those
[1:22:25] when he had brought out of Egypt he'd
[1:22:27] surely then after what he destroyed them
[1:22:31] save them first brought them out of
[1:22:34] Egypt and then had them destroy and
[1:22:37] destroyed them because they didn't
[1:22:39] continue with their message and the
[1:22:41] Angels would kept not their first estate
[1:22:43] but left their own habitation he has
[1:22:46] reserved in everlasting chains and what
[1:22:48] you talk about I'm coming to demons
[1:22:50] those who started out with Lucifer's
[1:22:52] campaign they are in Chains
[1:22:54] they can never be redeemed they are
[1:22:56] demons forever and her God destroys them
[1:23:01] who's going to judge him who's going to
[1:23:04] say to God how can you do such a thing
[1:23:06] you know that's what people say well if
[1:23:08] there was a God how can he sit with his
[1:23:10] hand folded and all them Jews under
[1:23:13] Stalin and Hitler
[1:23:14] amen was killed like that and while they
[1:23:17] were being killed and destroyed and
[1:23:18] everything else he sit up there like a
[1:23:20] big man with his hand and he didn't even
[1:23:22] have no idea they don't know the word
[1:23:25] those Jews calls it upon themselves at
[1:23:28] the day of crucifixion when Pilate asked
[1:23:30] him should we give you Jesus as Barabbas
[1:23:34] they say give us Barabbas and let the
[1:23:40] blood of this man be on our children on
[1:23:44] us in our children and from that day on
[1:23:47] it was it was the Jews own grandparents
[1:23:51] that cursed them that's why when they go
[1:23:54] in the aggravation hate them because of
[1:23:56] what did you said at the day of
[1:23:58] crucifixion but there comes in a time of
[1:24:04] restoration had not God blinded the Jews
[1:24:07] there wouldn't have been a place for the
[1:24:08] Gentiles and because God is a just God
[1:24:11] hallelujah
[1:24:12] whoo God is gonna come down and I tell
[1:24:19] you what I won't be here I'll be looking
[1:24:20] at about me of heaven either but when
[1:24:23] that time comes I'll be looking down and
[1:24:25] the Bible said in one day Israel will be
[1:24:28] born God a field 144,000 Jews with the
[1:24:33] Holy Ghost
[1:24:34] whoo my goodness but see they'll be
[1:24:37] having a great time but not as good as
[1:24:39] ours hallelujah I'm almost done folks
[1:24:44] and the angels were kept not their first
[1:24:46] estate but left their own habitation he
[1:24:48] has reserved in everlasting chains
[1:24:51] chains under darkness under the judgment
[1:24:53] of the great day you know and the thing
[1:24:57] that people say well I'm so sorry you
[1:25:00] know I was born this way I'm sorry too I
[1:25:02] was born this way but because I was born
[1:25:05] this way don't mean I have to remain
[1:25:06] this way and God has always given us the
[1:25:10] opportunity of change it's not that you
[1:25:13] change yourself the Holy Spirit comes
[1:25:14] down and change you that's why I was
[1:25:18] took me so long to give my heart to the
[1:25:20] Lord because I thought I had to change
[1:25:23] myself but then when I heard
[1:25:26] about the Holy Spirit and the Holy Ghost
[1:25:27] and hold how it when God comes and his
[1:25:30] spirit comes into you and then it
[1:25:32] changes you and I'm a witness
[1:25:36] if I had not been changed I couldn't
[1:25:39] tell you where I'd be you said brother
[1:25:42] Brooks it's are you done no God still
[1:25:44] working on me but I know one thing I'm
[1:25:48] not the man I used to be huh I'm not the
[1:25:53] man I used to be I'm not worn out what I
[1:25:56] want to be when I'm definitely not the
[1:25:59] man I used to be and it showed that
[1:26:02] somewhere death and life has met and I
[1:26:05] passed from death unto life now my heart
[1:26:09] and desires a ban is solely to know God
[1:26:12] like Paul says to know him and the power
[1:26:15] of his resurrection I don't know whether
[1:26:18] you're really fully understood stood me
[1:26:20] but what I'm trying to say is this God
[1:26:22] has spoken in my closing God has spoken
[1:26:25] to Israel says after 400 years I'm going
[1:26:28] to send you a deliverer y'all know about
[1:26:30] Moses right Moses was born right to
[1:26:36] Amram and Jochebed
[1:26:37] and then they came an order from the
[1:26:40] Pharaoh killed all the children three
[1:26:42] and under like he did in the time that
[1:26:44] Jesus was born see the devil always
[1:26:46] tried to kill the raw your seed that's
[1:26:49] why the devil just tried to kill you I
[1:26:51] guarantee you everybody got a testimony
[1:26:53] somewhere where Satan tried to take your
[1:26:55] life and God prevented it and yet
[1:26:58] instill here God takes a fair a little
[1:27:01] boy and he wraps him up sent him up into
[1:27:02] Pharaoh's house I love God because God
[1:27:04] says he since he's down there you take
[1:27:06] her and when I get ready to use him I'll
[1:27:08] take him out of your hands I love it so
[1:27:13] anyhow we realized that God did that and
[1:27:15] then Pharaoh
[1:27:17] I mean Moses thought that he could do it
[1:27:19] himself he thought he could deliver the
[1:27:20] children himself and when he saw an
[1:27:22] Egyptian being beaten by I mean excuse
[1:27:25] me Israelite being built beaten by
[1:27:29] Egyptian he went down there to help and
[1:27:32] he ended up killing the man so what
[1:27:34] happened he becomes a future - but he's
[1:27:37] right in the plan of God
[1:27:39] god when Moses didn't know where he was
[1:27:43] running God was directing his every path
[1:27:47] right up toward Mount Sinai ooh right
[1:27:52] where he wanted him then all of a sudden
[1:27:54] one day as Moses being a fugitive ran
[1:27:57] from Pharaoh and now he's out there in
[1:27:59] in a million and all it with him all of
[1:28:04] a sudden he looks up and he see a bush
[1:28:06] y'all really believe that see let me
[1:28:09] tell you all something if you don't
[1:28:11] believe that forget it you're not even a
[1:28:13] Christian you can't make heaven until
[1:28:17] you believe everyone at every word in
[1:28:18] this Bible man wrote it and they wrote
[1:28:24] it by God's inspiration and God put it
[1:28:27] all together I know it's real so to make
[1:28:31] a long story short that time that God
[1:28:34] has brother brother Troy preached the
[1:28:36] other night when it was time for Moses
[1:28:41] work to be done God met Moses and there
[1:28:45] was a fire in the bush and then Moses
[1:28:49] the Word of God said that the voice
[1:28:52] spoke out of the bush and says Moses
[1:28:54] take off your shoes the ground in which
[1:28:56] you stand is on holy ground Moses took
[1:28:59] off the shoe his shoes God began to talk
[1:29:01] to Moses but then after the meeting was
[1:29:04] over the bush stopped burning
[1:29:07] why because the fire that was once in
[1:29:10] the bush was now in the Moses that's why
[1:29:14] Moses was now able to go down to Pharaoh
[1:29:17] and said let my people go
[1:29:20] what crazy man we'll go down to Pharaoh
[1:29:24] the greatest army like going into the
[1:29:26] Russian territory and telling Putin let
[1:29:28] my people go and all you got is a stick
[1:29:32] right but that's the way God does it he
[1:29:39] takes the simple things in the things
[1:29:41] that means no sense to people and he'll
[1:29:43] use that and guess what Moses conquered
[1:29:49] all of Egypt with a stick
[1:29:54] we call it a rod something like this
[1:30:01] when pharaoh came to egypt came to
[1:30:05] consume moses then when when they were
[1:30:08] at the Red Sea Jesus or God said unto
[1:30:10] the fair Moses's why Christ speak in
[1:30:15] other words now you are missing you
[1:30:18] you're the God did he say it I'm gonna
[1:30:20] call she'd be God into the Egyptians now
[1:30:23] you the God you go and you speak and why
[1:30:26] don't you see nature and everybody else
[1:30:28] everything else obey you
[1:30:29] all of a sudden Moses speak and the Red
[1:30:32] Sea opens up y'all don't believe that
[1:30:36] y'all rather believe a you know we got
[1:30:38] so many people who really believe that
[1:30:39] aliens and all you're right there are
[1:30:41] worlds many worlds and these worlds will
[1:30:44] one day be inhabited but it won't be by
[1:30:47] aliens it'll be by the redeemed
[1:30:52] everything is in order but God had to
[1:30:56] show you your salvation show you how
[1:30:58] much he loved you you don't know what
[1:31:00] love is until you find out what hatred
[1:31:01] is you know what faithfulness is until
[1:31:04] you find out what of unfaithfulness
[1:31:05] either and God brought us into this RAM
[1:31:08] so that we can comprehend him understand
[1:31:11] him and know him and I guarantee you at
[1:31:15] the end of this day when it's all over
[1:31:16] there'll be no such thing as evil there
[1:31:20] will never be another Lucifer there
[1:31:22] never be another rebellion you
[1:31:23] understand me
[1:31:25] there'll never be another heartache or
[1:31:27] heartbroken anything this world that
[1:31:30] we're talking about it can't you can't
[1:31:31] even fathom it it's beyond anything when
[1:31:35] I was a boy I had a dream and I dreamed
[1:31:37] of heaven and I saw and I you can
[1:31:39] believe it or not but I saw colors I saw
[1:31:42] things that I have never seen before
[1:31:44] things that you can't even describe but
[1:31:48] that's when I saw Jesus for the first
[1:31:50] time and ever since then he's worked in
[1:31:54] my life I am nobody
[1:31:58] I'm not trying to be a great leader I'm
[1:32:00] not trying to be nothing but someone who
[1:32:04] could tell somebody how
[1:32:06] to make it I'm not looking for a great
[1:32:09] name I had that I I gave away money you
[1:32:13] know I've given away those stardom
[1:32:15] places all that kind of stuff I could
[1:32:18] have been somewhere in Hollywood by now
[1:32:20] I didn't want any there I don't want on
[1:32:23] any of that that's not what makes you
[1:32:25] happy you can have money in your pocket
[1:32:27] anybody know what I'm talking about I've
[1:32:29] had money many days in my pocket I've
[1:32:31] had clothes on fine clothes they're all
[1:32:33] that looks nice but on the inside I'm
[1:32:36] sad in the inside there's no peace in
[1:32:39] the inside I'm hating myself because I
[1:32:42] know who I really am and when you can
[1:32:45] see yourself as being ugly I want you to
[1:32:47] understand there's somebody who can see
[1:32:50] you as being beautiful we have been
[1:32:52] created in the image and likeness of God
[1:32:54] and don't you let nobody belittle
[1:32:56] belittle you no matter what you look
[1:33:00] like you know it doesn't matter your
[1:33:02] Creed your color it doesn't matter if
[1:33:04] God is in you you are son and daughter
[1:33:07] of God no weapon formed against you let
[1:33:12] Stan cher prosper hi I said a lot of
[1:33:22] things tonight and I wish I wish I could
[1:33:28] have said more maybe explaining better
[1:33:33] but I know people of God and that I say
[1:33:38] this of you I can't give you more God
[1:33:42] that's something you have to seek for
[1:33:46] that's something that you have to
[1:33:48] approach God for he's the only one that
[1:33:51] can give you more of him he's the only
[1:33:54] one that can give you a revelation of
[1:33:56] who you are I can't give you that but I
[1:34:03] can't say to you if in your life you
[1:34:06] have always had something tugging at you
[1:34:07] about Christ if there was something
[1:34:12] always in your heart of your mind about
[1:34:14] Jesus even though you haven't been able
[1:34:15] to reach it I thought one time when my
[1:34:17] mom leave I said I can't live like that
[1:34:19] see
[1:34:19] too tight she just I can't live like
[1:34:21] that I used to try it
[1:34:23] amen and every weekend I'm out on the
[1:34:25] out in the clubs and doing what I'm
[1:34:28] doing
[1:34:28] I couldn't overcome in my god
[1:34:32] exit out out of all the churches I went
[1:34:35] through looking for God God sent a
[1:34:36] message and by God's the message I have
[1:34:39] become Who I am now a message like
[1:34:44] Noah's message warning us about the
[1:34:46] coming judgement of God and it's a lot
[1:34:51] to be said because in our reasoning we
[1:34:53] can look at God as being an evil creator
[1:34:56] like my brother who's such an
[1:34:58] intellectual he think well but why you
[1:35:00] got a God you got a God got to make you
[1:35:02] serve come on if you understood the
[1:35:05] goodness of God I wish I was more like
[1:35:07] him a God that that could feed those
[1:35:11] people that hate him make mockery out
[1:35:14] him curse him to his face every day
[1:35:17] people do that and God still clothed
[1:35:19] them he still feeds them
[1:35:21] he still give them strength to work jobs
[1:35:24] and everything else he's like a pig on
[1:35:27] the tree and the apples up beating him
[1:35:29] upside the head and he just steady eatin
[1:35:31] and never looking up to say thank you
[1:35:33] thank you wherever these apples coming
[1:35:35] from I thank you that's how men are
[1:35:38] God is constantly blessing them and they
[1:35:41] don't even look up to say thank you
[1:35:43] surely you can't believe that you
[1:35:45] evolved from some ape and then where the
[1:35:48] ate came from a rock you know it doesn't
[1:35:52] make sense it's harder to believe
[1:35:53] evolution than it is to believe the
[1:35:55] Bible over God there was a big bang yes
[1:35:57] there was a big bang afterwards God said
[1:35:59] Let there be bang and I don't understand
[1:36:05] people he said why are you saying all of
[1:36:08] these these things because we've got so
[1:36:11] many and it's so true I tell people this
[1:36:13] I said you know when you find a group
[1:36:15] like the people like this the first
[1:36:16] thing people want to say with their
[1:36:17] so-called well what was Jesus Jesus had
[1:36:20] twelve men following him everywhere
[1:36:22] they left their families and everything
[1:36:25] hello we can name a lot
[1:36:29] a lot of things where people to see
[1:36:32] understand this the only person we
[1:36:35] worship here is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:36:38] he's the only one he's the only true
[1:36:42] Living God hallelujah I think it was
[1:36:51] Buddha even prophesied about a messenger
[1:36:56] coming in our day but having a form of
[1:36:59] godliness but denying the power thereof
[1:37:05] being spiritual is not being saved but
[1:37:11] being saved is being spiritual you love
[1:37:15] the Lord the purpose for my existence
[1:37:30] but I was walking a road that lead it to
[1:37:36] mut district ah and then one day I heard
[1:37:44] truth
[1:37:47] the reasons for cavalry that moment for
[1:37:52] the first time in my life I truly fell
[1:37:57] free grace saw me grace saw me
[1:38:11] in the mist
[1:38:13] oh the darkness gray saw me open I
[1:38:25] didn't I see that the reason is is
[1:38:37] because gray saw me to know that from
[1:38:45] the beginning I was in his thoughts to
[1:38:54] know that life is worth living
[1:38:57] since God made me his choice and how I
[1:39:05] longed to go home
[1:39:09] am i safe that shall endure had been
[1:39:14] washed in the blood up in reading no it
[1:39:19] doesn't see my sin anymore
[1:39:23] yes sir gray saw me gray saw me in the
[1:39:36] midst of all the darkness grace yes sir
[1:39:44] he opened my eyes then I'm I see
[1:39:54] that the reason I'm ja is because grace
[1:40:04] saw me hallelujah oh it's only because
[1:40:12] grace saw me millions millions is so
[1:40:18] much to it
[1:40:20] the Bible is infinite and there's so
[1:40:23] many stories so much to it it's very
[1:40:26] difficult to try to express everything
[1:40:28] in just a short period of time for
[1:40:32] people of God all I'm trying to tell you
[1:40:34] is this get more serious
[1:40:38] let God consecrate you for the hour so
[1:40:41] that you cannot be so busy because
[1:40:44] that's his trick he's keeping everybody
[1:40:46] so busy they too busy to stop and say
[1:40:49] God where are you lord I need you Lord I
[1:40:54] need your help everybody is so busy they
[1:40:58] don't have time for the Lord they got
[1:41:01] time for everything else but hardly any
[1:41:04] time for God that's the trick of the
[1:41:07] enemy but remember if I don't rip they
[1:41:11] don't remember anything else that was
[1:41:12] said we were created to be in the image
[1:41:16] and likeness of God we were created to
[1:41:18] be sons and daughters of God and then
[1:41:23] ought to be our ambition it ought to be
[1:41:25] our goal and this Bible has the answer
[1:41:31] you love the Lord father God we come
[1:41:35] before you I know we've been a little
[1:41:37] linty Lord we've just been jumping here
[1:41:39] and there but I ask you to take control
[1:41:42] and I believe you did so we realized
[1:41:46] Lord we're living in the last day he
[1:41:49] sent us Lord the Word of God to help us
[1:41:52] escape many has gone away many of us
[1:41:55] trade many of becames or come all kinds
[1:41:59] of things but you said in these last
[1:42:00] days there will be a bride there will be
[1:42:03] a people Lord that will stand on your
[1:42:06] truth that would love
[1:42:08] with all their hearts that would be
[1:42:10] obedient to your word no matter what the
[1:42:12] world say we have always been considered
[1:42:15] oddballs and crazy insane and even Paul
[1:42:19] said he worship in the way called heresy
[1:42:22] Lord we are in that time when our kind
[1:42:27] it's few and far there not many of us
[1:42:34] left
[1:42:35] but you said Lord in this last day that
[1:42:38] it will only be a few that will make a
[1:42:42] translation I pray Lord God that we are
[1:42:46] of that few blessed the hear of the word
[1:42:51] Lord let him not have peace everyone in
[1:42:56] this house tonight until we've made our
[1:43:00] peace with you God granted sometimes
[1:43:06] Lord we feel so strange when we when we
[1:43:10] bringing a message that we know that
[1:43:12] it's very important but we are here to
[1:43:15] become the very living word living
[1:43:18] expression of you Bibles made a lie
[1:43:21] thank you Jesus for all the victories
[1:43:25] that you have given unto us Lord you
[1:43:28] told me last night to shout to clap my
[1:43:30] hand shout with the voice of triumph and
[1:43:35] that's what I'm going to do Lord keep
[1:43:39] being mindful that my victory would be
[1:43:42] great every day that's each and every
[1:43:45] heart Lord as we go out different ways
[1:43:48] let no hurt harm or danger come upon
[1:43:51] this fall we'll be careful to give you
[1:43:53] the praise the glory in honor in Jesus
[1:43:57] Christ's name we pray amen
[1:44:02] just to be logged jeez
