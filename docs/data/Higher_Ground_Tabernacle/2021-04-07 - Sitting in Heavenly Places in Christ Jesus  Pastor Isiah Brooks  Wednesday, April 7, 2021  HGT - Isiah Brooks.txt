god's grace little if there is such a thing being good to god i'd like to be so one of these old days we're going to put this yes sir one of these old days we're going to put away this old sinful flesh and the real man that's made out of the image of christ we'll spend eternity enjoying him as i said we're coming from first john the first chapter we're going to read the fifth verse beginning there at the fifth verse and read down to the tenth verse this then is the message which we have heard of him and declared unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us one more passage of scripture let's just go let me see where i want to go here hallelujah let's just go to ephesians please ephesians 1. we'll be gone for about 10 days and we're trusting that you keep us in your prayers and we will definitely keep you all in ours ephesians 1 3 brother troy would be handling the ministerial part of this services he uh and we talked to him about that and so i pray that everybody will cooperate with him in our absence ephesians 1 beginning at the third verse blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according according as he have chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will hallelujah you love that so let us thank god for his grace by way of prayer father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us lord we thank you for this time and opportunity to preach your word we ask oh god that you forgive us of all our sins cleanse us from all of our unrighteousness all of our sins all of our thoughts desires that have not been pleasing in thy sight father we pray that you wash us clean because we're guilty lord when you say oh just if we break one of the law we're guilty of the whole and father we are your sinners saved by grace but because of that you have done a great work in us uh and we thank god thank you for that lord that you would take such a worm as i and do something great by making us sons and daughters of god bless us now in this your lovely name jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated i like to entitle this message sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus now remember we have been dealing with elevating ourselves our minds letting the mind of christ be in us stop thinking like men and stop thinking like failures when we look at ourselves as being failures then we're denying the grace of god because paul said that we are more than conquerors through christ jesus i think the most difficult thing for us to do uh sometime is to reject the lies of the devil it is satan who is contrary to the word now whenever the word speaks anything it is so and it has nothing to do with you you know you didn't choose god god chose you is that right and we understand by the message of today that we are under what we call an unconditional covenant it ought to make every man shout and jump for joy to know that it's not what you can do for him but what he has done for you now we look at the scripture and we must understand that the bible says that if we walk in the light as he is in the light uh it talks about how we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin and you and i must understand this is what makes us different from the others because the sun doesn't stay in one place it moves from the east to the west you all know what i mean by that i mean as the earth rotates it moves we have seasons what we call winter spring summer and fall and you know but we understand that light doesn't stay in one place it moves and god works with those things according to his own pleasure in his own plan now that's basically the way the gospel has moved the bible said it was starred in the east and shine in the west and it says where the caucus is there will the eagles be gathered so we realize amen that the gospel have traveled from the east starting with lustre then wesley then the pentecostals and now god has brought us to a different light but but it is the light also when the light moves the blood moves as well you understand me i'ma say it again when the light moves the blood moves as well because what was good for yesterday that which would have satisfied god yesterday will not satisfy god today because the light has moved and you and i must always follow the pillar of fire wherever he is is where we want to be or should be now i said all of that to say amen that this message in itself if we don't move with it we become stagnant ourselves uh we know that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever he is a god that change is not our biggest adversary is is the devil himself and you and i must understand who he is now the bible says that we're not ignorant of his devices and so i want to just read a few scripture and expound on these scriptures so that we can believe where we are you understand me if this word the seals have been opened and and god called john and brother adam said that john typed out the church so when john was able to see all of these things prophecies and things amen that even he himself did not understand at the point of time but now that the word has been opened that which have been prophesied in daniel where the book was closed now that the book is open amen and the bible said that the book was opened in him who in his the hand who made it amen so we know that we're living in a time when the scripture has been opened and then the word of god said let him that read it because there's a time no man can read it and understand it but now let him that readeth run because he who tarry won't always carry god is not going to always wait and now we're approaching amen the translation of the saints hello now if that be true which it is then where are we in time you know there's not going to be a great universal uh uh revival i mean that has already happened but each and every one of us is being revived now the bride revival is actually going on now in the hearts of individuals and that that revival is removing all of the trash out of your life hallelujah you understand me it's like a dirty cup you pick it up it's dirty as justification you wash the cup right you bring it to a sanctification and then when you feel it up you bring it into use which is the holy ghost hallelujah but the cup was a cup when you found it hallelujah you understand me a son is a son a daughter is a son a daughter no matter how filthy and dirty you were before god picked you up it does not change who you are you were that when he picked you up so now the scripture says all spiritual blessings so you can't make god a liar now i'm going to come to that in just a moment because when the devil said you can't have such and such he is a liar you understand me if god has said that all spiritual blessings is given to you by way of christ jesus right you must believe that we don't even know what all is but it surpasses our understanding in other words we do not have to live like beggars or failures or people amen who who cannot accomplish anything now paul has told us we're more than conquerors through christ we can't do it but he has already done it for us sometimes we we get to the place where we mix up law and grace and i know how that is because i have struggled many times myself but the truth of the matter is amen none of us can work hard enough to make a rapture amen i'm gonna say that again none of us can make work hard enough to make a rapture our words will never make us worthy hallelujah why because the bible said we are accepting in the beloved so why would we allow satan to make us think we're not going to make it just to hear this message the bible said if you can hear it and read it says you are blessed the blessed and nobody no one can curse that in which god has blessed now ephesians 1 20 says which he had wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in heavenly places far i need you to listen to this far above all principalities and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that world which is to come you understand what paul is saying you are setting in heavenly places in christ jesus right now which he wrought in christ when he raised it from the dead and set him as his own right hand that right hand means power and authority where in heavenly places listen oh i i might be able to defeat the devil no sir far above all principalities it doesn't matter if he's the king of satan or satan is the king of all satan has been defeated and we must always remember he has no power no power at all and if there is power if there's some that he have you gave it to him when he wrought in christ i'mma say it when he raised him from the dead and said him now we're in him we are in christ sitting in heavenly places that means wherever he is we are and that what that means whatever authority he has we have are far above principalities and power and might and dominion hallelujah it doesn't matter what you call the name of the demon or the devil remember the word satan is not even in the bible we put that in there we gave him a name he was just a devil a name was once once once once only one time you'll find the name lucifer and that was when he was with god but when he fell he received a new name and only thing god gave him was a devil just described his character i'ma come on with it because i want you to understand anything that is not truth is a lie and anything that is a lie is the devil may manifest right you say well i got cancer that's a lie because with his stripes we were healed you see what i'm saying oh i got this no you don't that's a lie if you believe a lot see that lie is a devil and that devil is there to make you believe his lie but if you stand on the word of truth the bible says it will make you free no devil nothing can stand in the face of truth far well i like that word far that that don't mean close i mean far above all principalities and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world this is what i'm talking about but also in that which is to come in not just in this world but the other dimension we're you know this is where god is trying to tell us we're in this third dimension but we must elevate our minds to the higher dimension where god works and operates you know that's the only way that you can get the holy ghost your mind has to switch from this third dimension into the dimension where god is amen boldly go go before the throne of grace where not here in another dimension and you have to bring yourself to that condition that's why sometimes people don't understand why it takes a long while to get into that prayer because you're you're traveling you're pressing from out of this dimension into that next dimension and when you get in that heavenly dimension that heavenly place all of a sudden words come to your mind prayer words thoughts and things from your word that normally won't come to you in this dimension you know what it is sometimes people don't understand that being carnal can't get you there that's right you got to be spiritual minded to get there and you can be being spiritual minded without the spirit of god making you spiritually minded amen you know it's amazing that we this word was behind the veil and we treat it like his common manner it's not what god has brought to this message in this last day is not common manner once it become common to you you're not walking in the light as he is in the light because the bible said in his presence there's fullness of joy hallelujah and have put all things on his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all wait a minute the church which is his body that filleth all uh which of the fullness of him that filleth all all and in all can't get away from him ephesians 2 4 but god this is what i love about him he lays it out that's why brother branham says that that ephesians parallels joshua because you got to fight to maintain this it just doesn't come easy because you got you got all of the uh the ikes fighting get against you in this territory hallelujah but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us when even when he were dead and even when we we were dead in sins have quickened us together with christ by grace you are saved hallelujah hey and have raised us up together and made us together in heavenly places in christ jesus he said made us you know what made to make somebody do something he put you there made you sit in heavenly places in christ jesus you got to understand about jesus he's the only one that can change the dimensions he can walk from one to another with no problem hallelujah and because of that amen have you ever thought about it this i'm gonna throw something out at you because this will be something that i'll be working with in the future but you know what brother bam said when we have heard this message we have heard from our theophany well you must understand that theophany is a body and every spirit don't have theophanies so where do their spirits go they don't have bodies i don't know how they move from one place to another i don't even know how they recognizable because remember the rich young ruler was not recognizable well we know that that lazarus was but the point uh i'm getting over to you is this can you imagine brother i'm saying like this he said one of the worst things i when i came to dying i feared and that was that you know we'd be like a puff cloud somewhere without shape boy can you imagine and that's the way the world was before god said let there be light it was void without shape it was lost and i'm just you know i look at this thing and i said i've always wondered why we have in our minds that these people are going to have these bodies and i don't know that that's lost and i don't know how all that worked but i think to myself then what body that they do have because see the word body is eternal you understand me but whatever they're in even if it's just a spirit or whatever the bible says in that place the worms never die so whatever that is i don't want it you understand me whatever state of being they are in let them have that because that in itself is hell but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead and sins have quickened us together with christ i have to say it by grace he are saved see you got to understand he quickened us what makes you love this message he did it in all that you've gone through why do you stay with it because of him he quickened you how many people walked in the face of jesus looked in the face of jesus and turned away from it saw him touched him is that right oh yeah the bible says there were times they thrown him that means they were so close to him they were bumping you know but even in that crowd they still walked away from christ they said oh he touched me see that ain't enough you need more than a touch you need an infielding totally in feeling right because now remember when they're raised up in that second resurrection they raised up in whatever body they had before but what is it that they have in hell it can't be eternal but whatever it is they can feel they can smell i soon smell whatever senses are heightened at least that's what they say but i don't know no man scripturally you know how they say oh i died and i went to hell and i saw whatever well if god told lazarus the rich young ruler you couldn't come back that's the word how you figure all these other people are coming back it's a lie i am telling you it's a lie because once you're gone you're gone you can't come back and y'all have you ever noticed the people that die and come back there is no truth that they believe many people who have not even don't even know jesus but they die and come back i don't know what that is but i know one thing according to the word once you're dead and you go to hell or wherever the rich young ruler was you don't get a second chance if that be the case god would have to raise him back up and say okay go preach to your brothers see but we'll believe that lie we'll believe it because it sounds good or sound right it ain't about sounding right it's whether it is right because you got to understand brother baby said but once your time is up on this earth it's up you're finished i'm not saying they i don't know where they were maybe it was a coma i don't understand it but i know one thing satan is a liar and even in that ram he can deceive you making you think you see jesus and one of the things that give me this oh i went over there and i saw children and babies do you really think god would do that to you can you imagine a man nursing a baby through eternity babies came by the fault and i'm off my message but i'm building to show you that whatever is not truth is a lie and that lie is a manifestation of the devil i'm not talking about near-death experiences those things can be real but if you go down in there unless you're going by way of a dream you don't come out of there you understand me see now and raise us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ i'm coming that in this age to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through christ jesus now god is mad with you that ain't what the word says that is not is not what the word says that thought in your mind is what the devil has placed in you because if god has justified you as though you never said no i'm talking about holy ghost real people i'm not talking about potentials i'm some of the real god godly people who have come in contact with the philippians the holy spirit and now he's in you this is your covenant up until then his potential you've got to get to god and god must get to you is that right because you remember jacob had promises but jacob did not get what he wanted to get or needed to get until he wrestles with the angel that's prayer you wrestle with the angel for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourself it is what the gift of god oh i've got they said brother i got faith i got faith brother i said if you had faith you wouldn't be up here you got perfect faith why are you coming up here in the prayer line hallelujah you understand me now i'm going to say something and i it might get on somebody's nerve but i can tell you when i look at the scripture when jesus was crashing out devils he spoke a word and he left it the devil had to go you'll never see it in oh praise god it took me hours to get rid of that devil that's a lie and i'm gonna tell you something he's gonna show up again the devil like he liked show he liked drama he he liked theatrical stuff right because remember the man who had the left uh the epilepsy when jesus told him to get up out of that man what did he do he wallet all over the floor jesus just stood there and said all right now you know i ain't gonna talk again i don't have to say get out once i told you why because light will always defeat darkness and truth will always prevail over a lie but people rather believe lies you see but what we fail to see is we got that hollywood thing even in the message that's hollywood you'll never see jesus do it and you never saw brother branham do it he never wrestled with the devil he spoke the word and the devil had to come out see let me tell you something when you know truth and you know that that's a lie that's that's that that has imprisoned that person truth will always set them free if they can receive it you don't have to go through all that sweat and carrying on i've seen people i know they're if they become christians it'll be a miracle because i've seen what pentecostal people do they shake their head and make them fall and you know all kinds of stuff in the name of this message oh no no no no no that's not truth well people get mad with me on that one that's okay for grace you are saved but by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourself it is the gift of god not a word lest any man shouldn't boast but we are his workmanship we are his workmanship he's working you you're not working him he's working you created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we shall walk excuse me in them what are you talking about are you going to make mistakes yeah but don't god is not even looking at that and i'm not saying listen i'm going to say well i can do what i want to do no the bible says if you say you have no sins you make him a liar and the truth is not in you hallelujah but when we do sin we confess our sins and god knows because we're going to confess it he's already forgotten it let me hurry up because i'm going too slow ephesians 3 8 says unto me who i am less than the least i just want to make sure i hadn't you don't you feel like you don't you have this longing in you though and there's a longing for god for god in you yes ephesians 3 8 says unto me who am less than the least of all saints is this grace given that i should preach among the gentiles the unsurgical riches of christ well then why do people feel like they know it all that's a lie it's unsearchable it's going to continue to unfold and unfold and unthought and we do just like the ages before us once god began to unfold another truth in the message we labor that person as being insane or you know you're leaving the message what did not lutheran say that to the wesleyans and didn't the western say that to the pentecostals and the pentecostals have said it to us and brother robin said when that seal opened rockets when whoa five went here and five out of ten five it continues until god brings a message and a word where it transforms us completely into the very image of god but first of all he must work on our minds our minds let this might be in you you understand me we've got to stop thinking like men working like men acting like men we must think like god and act like god hallelujah that's what jesus was trying to tell his disciples you have the authority over everything didn't that i read that just now of about principalities and powers and it doesn't matter who name it comes in you have the authority over it he's given that to us and we must receive it and we must believe it in order to please god otherwise you're gonna you're gonna believe a lie you're finished man you're not saying too much you've gone too far not with the grace of god do you don't you know the elected cannot blaspheme the holy ghost huh look look what paul did see what paul calls a lot of the new testament saying the blessing and you know he had been doing something but he was chosen and elected who's going to lay the charge in god's elect see not even god can lay a charge to you because you are elected if he puts that who that who who gonna lay in charge because he lacked y'all understand what i'm saying he bind him all himself with that that scripture who is he not a part of the who and what we must realize by god's grace amen that god is more than just how can i say it religion and you ought to be tired of it all of us ought to be ashamed we ought to be saying lord i gotta live above this carnality that's what god wants for us that early church did they weren't carnal they were spiritual and they were so spiritual it they would call christian at antioch why because they walked like and they talked like him they were the original seed they're the ones who fell into the ground that we might be living today yeah and we supposed to bring forth the same kind not some organization some club and that's that's basically what a lot of us have become like a message club you know god help us unto me who am les paul uh paul says unto me who's less than the least of all the saints is the grace of given that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world have been hid in god who created all things by jesus christ but let me tell you something see because god reveals something to you and doesn't reveal something to the next man look at all the people who god revealed that jesus christ was the messiah and those people who could not see it they called those people who the revelation came to devils but that's what we do because you don't see it i tell you what what we need to do is stop praying and stop trying amen to sift this message through your previous teachings this is the urim ethereum and this is where you take every thought and go back to it [Music] that's what we do and you and i must understand this thing is it's it's mighty what i'm seeing it's mighty it's just it's mighty just those words come up hither that was the bride that's john that means you gotta you can't stay here for me to show you what i need to show you you've got to believe earth you understand me so what are you saying think about it when christ was crucified he was suspended in in in a dimensional form he was right in between heaven and earth and if you're going to see him you got to look up to see it right that's it listen brother i'm saying like this he says there is something inside of me and i want to bring this to your mind let me tell you something whenever a challenge comes don't you back down don't you don't you call down like like moses did and he did brother batman said he got scared god said why christ speak he said but you take the anointing of david when goliath amen was over there boasting god like it just gave david more power more strength more courage why because he knew his god was supernatural and he understood his god was god he wasn't afraid of goliath goliath boasting was a lie and all the boastings of the devil is a lie listen even y'all know i don't you know i was at my doctor the other day and you know i have this situation with my eye but you know what i'm i'm saying with his stripes i'm healed this is gonna work this he's done everything else he's gonna heal it one of these old days they're gonna look and they're gonna see it's finished they're not gonna understand it but i i will it's because i believe it but you know he acted as if i didn't get the shot you know he don't know whether he's going to wait work on me i'm like do you think i can i'm saying this to myself now i know the man who's creator of all things yeah there's no healing in the shot only one can heal and that's jesus christ hallelujah that's jesus christ himself hallelujah you know they tried to get rid of paul i think they killed him about three times they must have been shook up this man is supposed to be dead and here he is over here preaching again see what you got to understand that you can't go beyond before your purpose our purpose the bride's purpose is to show this world this wicked unadulterated filthy world amen that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever they must know he lives you know moses went down to to egypt just to show egypt that he pharaoh wasn't god there's a god greater than you pharaoh he showed nebuchadnezzar there's a god greater than you he's going to show this political world there's a god greater than you and we're the ones that god has elected to do so yeah we got to be about our father's business he said brother brown said i want to bring this to your mind that all these things that we've seen happening this week when a meeting like this in a place prepared people concerned is altogether indicating that the things is at hand and to see

certain things to happen in our house and our family and it's happening happening i mean just god turning on the light you understand me and you say oh my god listen god heard us way back then his promises are yay in that name and when the devil said it ain't gonna happen they're just too far gone the devil is a liar amen hallelujah amen don't tell me god god got your number like they're saying he knows where you live you understand me we just got to believe that he's god he is only he's a rewarder to those who believe that he's god right you must first believe that he is god and he is a rewarder to those who believe that you believe he's god he will reward you for that now you can't be the salvation like that huh yes it's all together indicated that the things are at hand and to see little groups that will faithfully like yourselves gather out day after day night after night because something is pressing you to you is pressing to you there's something in you your spirit filled people there's something inside of you that's warning you anybody know what i'm talking about hey there's something inside of me that's warning me and i know it's got to be listen the rapture is at hand uh i was looking at the uh thing yesterday last night the youtuber you know how they have those little news clips i like looking at the little things to see what's happening around the world they said 52 volcanoes erupted just in last month i didn't even know we had that many volcanoes here 52 now if that be the case what is this leading to my son was awakened in california he three to four earthquakes but three of them came that morning shook him up well he's in florida now on his vacation on a busy trip but the point is it got him up off the bed he said i heard myself shaking on the wall now i want you to understand he's protected i said i said isaiah you protected now he said yeah daddy but i'm not ready for the pain of some sort like that he said i don't know how he said it but you know it's just like this we are protected but it doesn't exclude us from the pain y'all understand me pain is gonna part of the growth you know now he brother answered by what is wrong with the people can't they see he used that term hot breath of judgment you know and one place he was talking about the hound that was after the deer and how it was on this on the deer's uh uh kaylee's heel and you know and all of that you know if you get that he's done you know finish or the rabbit that's what it was the rabbit and the rabbit but the rabbit got into the secret place and and and and and he couldn't get it see that's what he's saying you don't feel the hot breath of judgment when he said that i thought about all the volcanoes you know but he says come into christ when you see the hot breath of judgment hanging on each side now swinging 1800 miles in an hour an hour uh around i think he's talking about dispatching and 18 000 miles an hour around and around the world and a sinful nation with their hands on a button that could send us all to power powder in five minutes he said don't look for something great to come a great revival you look for the coming of the lord be ready now the devil's only blinding your eyes to these things the devil he's making us think oh we got all this time and we know character-wise we're not there yeah he's coming back for characters is that right brother brown said he's coming back for character hallelujah god don't care about how long you've been to church how long you've gone to church how what how you dress what job you got he don't he doesn't care anything about that he's only looking for his image what we need is a holy ghost atmosphere that's right an atmosphere where the power of god are moving one accord one place gathered together under the atmosphere of expecting god to move down and do signs and wonders see what he's saying is that what we need now people say well you know what time or what message was that in i'll tell them what time and what it was it was the same yesterday today and forever god don't change we think we're going to be these intellectual message people that's nonsense amen that's a lie brother the bible tells us that you shall have power after which the holy ghost has come upon you amen and you mean to tell me we got all his power and we got to act like pentecostals trying to cast out devils speak to the words speak to the mountain that's the age we're living in adoption age i'll tell you what i i've been really seeing things and i'm like lord you know you caused me to do things that i wasn't even aware i was doing you know being sick or whatever the case may be i always reclaim my healings and i didn't care how long it was going to take god said it and i believe it and that settles it that's just it he didn't tell me a time i just know it's got to happen i love that message jesse preached speak life hallelujah that storm looked like it was going to come by by my house y'all got to see my whole way to wait my house sit there on that and that storm look like i said i i speak life i said devil you i can't remember i was on the inspiration and the next day i moved out the way it moved out of the way my point is amen i believe we're tried and tested everything comes your way and god says now what you gonna do with that i've been so ashamed many times financially amen i needed something and i'll be honest with you i was in a sad mood and god bring money like like he did to the saints in the fish mouth y'all understand me oh yes i've had brothers that called me i'm listen i'm sending you this i'm sitting i didn't ask how did you know one brother said because i'm led by the holy ghost i ain't talking about a little bit of money more than i need it's happened too many times let me tell you something if you really serving the lord you don't have to worry you go to god in prayer hallelujah and god are breaking listen uh one of the first miracles i ever had was that we were living on sarah road and i don't know whether my wife remember it i don't i just feel like saying it and i preached this before i was in prayer god said i'm gonna give you some money today and it was also during the tax time and my wife says well i know our tax money gonna come in pretty soon i says no i'm not talking about tax money i said god told me he was going to give me some money and i believe it's separated from that in the mail that day some lady i don't know who she is to this day sent me 500 i don't even know how she got my address y'all hear what i'm saying but she sent me y'all think 500 ain't nothing was there that's all i'm saying i'm still happy about it you know what i'm saying i don't even know who this lady was and she said because you blessed me with your ministry this was placed on my heart to send to you i'm like oh god you're too wonderfully good that's what all i'm trying to say don't you limit god for nothing we're living in an age you don't have to limit god we're astronauts hallelujah yes sir he says now we need what we need is the holy ghost atmosphere that's right an atmosphere where the power of god are moving one accord one place gathered together under the atmosphere do you see this one what's the problem is that's what's wrong with the mess oh it ain't nothing wrong with the message people who say they're in the message they don't even believe going gathering together and the devil is just beating them like that and we don't even know what's going on because they're too prideful hallelujah come on somebody this is what we when peter got in trouble what happened they got to praying and the power of god see what we don't understand the power of one accordingness when two or three are gathered in my name there i am in the midst i believe that with all of my heart you oh god help us here no principality no power is above us you understand me i wish i had the brother just the other day we went out to eat i didn't tell this part of the story but i was going to the wrong place i was going to chili's and when we were supposed to go for out outback yeah i had uh brother jesse in the car and the police you know how you make those lane turns and you got a outer lane and you got to inner lane when i had the inner lane and i forgot and i went almost wrecked oh he was mad with me yeah the police always in the light come on i pulled over in the driveway and he's just carrying on i said sir i'm so sorry i said i was wrong i said we were just having a great time in the lord that irritated him hallelujah but he carried on and stuff like that but i could remember something a soft answer a soft answer turned away wrath that's the word that's true and i kept giving soft answers and i said sir you're right i'm wrong and i do apologize for upsetting your day he said yeah this is a new police car and i just got it if i had wrecked this thing but god knew that hallelujah at the east i'm just gonna give you a warning though didn't even give me a sheet of paper just a voice warning what was that that was god see the word is right hallelujah remember the bible says enoch walked with god and was found not he no whirlwind picked him up he doesn't say it just said he walked with god and enoch types the bride and brother brown said that one day enoch was walking with god he turned around and said goodbye to his family and he was found not now what do you think you're doing enoch was in a different dimension y'all hear me many times brother branham lived in it when he began to talk okay you this and he went way in the future went all the way in the past what was it he was in two dimensions but we're to live in this this is what the seals were all about this is the breaking of the word this is what the thunders was all about he said i can't tell you how to do it i can't tell you what's there but this is where you belong because we're the only generation that had that portion that could not be explained he explained everything else but now this we're the generation that he couldn't explain it then if he couldn't explain it then let me ask you a question how will we know what to do the bible says that the holy ghost will lead you and guides you into all truth it'll be revelation after revelation at the revelation and that revelation is given to you personally personally help us jesus we're sitting in heavenly places in christchurch and you know what i'm excited because one of these old days we're going to walk from this dimension to the next they will look for us and we'll be gone can i say something when jesus rose from the dead i want you to understand he revealed himself in different ways to different people so your revelation of him after you know may be a little different you understand me at the at the at when he rose from the dead when mary came there he was the gardener understand me hallelujah and then when when they were on their road to emmaus he was a stranger but he began to appear to them in different forms and different ways to where they didn't even recognize him until he called mary mary so this message you may not have it like i got it but whatever you have will be that portion that will translate you one thing for certain they came and said he's alive he's risen hallelujah y'all understand me and that's what he's doing now amen he's revealing himself to individuals in different ways but he's still the same lord jesus so much so thomas says well i ain't going to believe your revelation until i see him myself and because he was elected and what i understand is that once thomas seen jesus and he became god to thomas thomas had one of the greater missionary admissions of all the disciples and you may not hear much of him but he went to india and tore it up you see what i'm saying i just believe with all my heart people when it comes to christ you know i used to be you know a lot of times you don't know your god pride until i used to have such a pride i wanted to pray for people but i didn't want people to know when i got sick and i used to so hate it when my wife would put in a prayer request for me because with me i'm not supposed to get sick you understand me i thought i had a faith that that ain't gonna happen to me y'all understand me that's what happened even with the copy god had to humble me it ain't gonna happen to me y'all understand me i was more embarrassed than anything now that's pride many other afflictions are the righteous and god will deliver you and it seems like when people still are ashamed to tell people well i got colby they still ashamed of it like it's some something to be ashamed of well you don't see no well you know what i had a bad flu they said nobody of it but when it come to covert oh you did and some people act like you're still contagious shame it's a shame it's a shame but let me show you something i gotta hurry i gotta hurry show you what lies are right in the christian realm even when it comes to christmas do you know what the devil has done he's placed a lie in there first of all it's a lie that he was born on december in december we believe it many people celebrate and carry on amen with christmas amen and they think well they put up all their decorations and the three wise man is dead that's a lie he said they weren't there but we believe it you know what what i'm saying we believe it look you go in all the stores and you see angels with wings when you die you do not get wings but we'll believe it right and we got this thing in our mind that the devil has this red face a blue face with pointed ears and this net and a pink falcon where is that scripturally nowhere it's hollywood it's the devil who makes it so just to make you fear oh it's true you know and we we don't we don't you know we don't even take what the bible said hell is right now you know a lot of these people think when they go to hell they gonna party you'll be jumping but it won't be because of the music as i said like casting out devils look what they've done to easter you ask a lot of people out there in the world now who who have christian backgrounds i guarantee you they're coloring eggs and bunnies and all that and i used to think those little chickadees were so cute when they were green and pink and orange but they don't remain that let them grow up and all those colored fellas are going to disappear and the truth will be known but i'm trying to tell you this that whatever is a lie is not of god this is another lie that's been given to message people that if the more revelation they have the more secure they are and paul said you can understand all mysteries and have that charity they ain't even working about with charity but have not charity it profits you nothing and charity is the holy ghost the divine nature of god but they're not worried about that they worried about this quote and that quote and i can remember oh i know this this this this and you don't understand there's so many who are still lost but religious don't talk like that brother bro where you get your authority just ask him he's the one speaking it i don't have those on my notes paul amen according to titus i'm a hurry a servant of god and apostle of jesus christ according to the faith of god's elect and an acknowledgement of the truth which is after godliness you can't be godly unless you've got god yeah in hope of eternal life with god that cannot lie promise before the world began now he promised us eternal life right but have in due time manifested his word through preaching which he committed unto me according to the commandment of god our savior paul said it's committed i got to show the gentiles this wonderful thing god has done for them it's unsearchable riches it's beyond anything i've ever seen before what god has done he's chosen a gentile bride y'all hear me now you got to understand that god even when it came to esther elsa didn't fully know who she was until times changed things started changing and then esther found herself in a place she never thought she'd ever be in her life and god has to change things that's why this whole mess we got in this world is moving it's not just do you realize it's not just in america the whole world is conspiring and everything has become a racial issue did y'all know all over the world and everybody won't recompense pay me for making me this way oh come on somebody and you know what that's the way it is everybody feels like they can pay their way out no no the price has already been paid and the only way out is jesus christ right i heard somebody say the other day it ain't a skin problem it's a sin problem y'all it's so funny it really is i said people are so s i don't want to come lord have mercy we all i don't care what color you are you're born the same way your daughter say wait you're born like an animal and you die like one and what we're afraid of is that satan is stripped of all his powers you know let me see one more thing everybody talking about equity what is that ain't nobody gonna be equal not in this world you can try to give everybody the same amount of money give them all the same amount at the end of the day one gonna have zero and the other one's gonna have some investments you understand me because they made different they think different they act different there's such thing no such thing i don't know what people are thinking what it's never been and never will be right since the fall there's never been equity there's never been equals never you know everybody think when they get to heaven it's gonna be equity but everybody's gonna have different rewards everybody ain't to have the same stuff but the only difference is we're not going to be jealous of one another we're just not going to be that way and that's mainly the reason why everybody is the way they are because one can have more than the other because it's jealousy just plain old jealousy let me move on that one that wasn't part of the word that what god put there so let me hurry up right listen satan not he like i said the word is not even found in the bible he's discovered as the devil that's the devil you know and they made satan such a character till everybody's afraid of him and when it comes to casting out devils you know he puts on this thing and he's just making everybody fear and you can't fear him you can't listen you can't go over in africa or india anywhere those places where they you know what what people don't realize is that we got more witches here in america than they have over there they just look different you understand me so my point is how are you gonna be afraid of a witch or a devil and say you got jesus that's a lie that's a lie it irritated paul when that woman was carrying on you know oh blessed that son of god whatever she was saying and he had to put up with that for several church search services before he could call that demon out of her he didn't wrestle with her he called it out the devil had to go let me hurry y'all understand what i'm trying to say authority is a different word from just power and even the devil has to obey you because all of heaven and earth is named after him your name lord jesus christ amen is a threat to his kingdom and if you learn how to use it he'll tremble in his shoes just like legion did when he saw jesus let me hurry up lord i'm taking too much time but listen um look what brother um says he said now now we use the devil the word satan because we identify him as the chief one but and he said and satan you who bound the people are charged thee as a deceiver and that's what a lie is deception i charge thee as having no power you're only a deceiver jesus christ triumphed over all the powers you have and strip you from every power you're deceiving the people and you've been exposed tonight come out of this audience can you imagine brother branham having to go one by one trying to cast out devils and wrestle with them and yeah come up out of here come out of this audience in the name of jesus christ leave them people and they did he said our lord died at calvary and through his holy unadulterated blood unadulterated blood the blood of the almighty god that was broken at calvary you redeemed the human race lord and you defeated satan by the same blood stripped him of every power that he had now y'all understand why i'm reading this because we give him power when he doesn't have any now you're either going to believe the word right or you're going to believe the lie don't blame god if you believe the lie because if you believe the lie you're going to get a manifestation of that lie and we're living in a generation even with lies amen are exhausted remember satan said i'm going to exalt myself and that's ex he's a liar and that's what he's doing he's exhausting his life and the bible said every evil imagination every one of them pull them down anything that exalts itself above the word of god pull it down it's a lie hallelujah oh god i didn't intend to go this long let me read this and i'm gonna let you go saint john 8 42 47. jesus said unto them if god were your father you would love me because jesus is truth if god is your father you're going to love truth for i proceeded forth and came forth came from god neither came i of myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word he said ye are of your father the devil now he's saying you the devil got his children he got children and they're going to act just like him right and the lust of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning and a bold not in the truth because there is no truth in him that means he's a liar and when he's speaking the lie he speaketh of his own he makes it up for he is a liar and the father of it he started it he's the perverter he's a deceiver hallelujah and when you believe a lie oh i can't do this and i can't do that that's nonsense when the bible said all things are possible to them that believe and paul said we are more than conquerors through christ which strengthens us hallelujah we've got to stop believing the lie and carrying on like we're helpless we're not helpless we're acting like moses we all do it we all i've done it many times god come right around and rebuke me why because he's trying to get us to understand you're the son your daughter you're supposed to act different if anybody's gonna believe me it must be you look at the closest that's why philippians says 4 he says finally brethren whatsoever things are true what's everything are honest he's uncovering the devil whatsoever things are just what sort of things are pure whatsoever things are lovely what's over things of a good report if there'll be any virtue huh if there's going to be strength in you if there be any praise think on these things i'm just going to leave it there but what i'm trying to say is that we're living in a world where lies are influencing everybody if you're not careful you'll believe a lie look at the world it's so perverted now why and every every perversion is built upon alive satan has changed things and i believe with all my hard people of god you know we've got to come up higher it's my mind if we believe that he is god he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him he will reward you when you approach him as god as the rule of all things all things is under him you understand me you approach him like that that's how he will receive you and he will reward you amen when abraham finally came to the conclusion that he was god that god was god met him as melchizedek and said let us have a feast and they did and then abraham paid his tithing where did that revelation come from walk in the light as he is in the light right if you walk into the light you'll forget if you're not walking in the light your sins can't be forgiven how when you walk in the light of here's the light what he said we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ would cleanse you excuse me drunk that a little bit too fast let's stand didn't mean to keep you so long i'm excited i'm really excited i've been battling even since i have made that declaration of what i'm going to do and i know satan he's mad and doesn't like it but he can't stop it whatever it is he can't stop it you know what i'm not guess working i'm not guessing whether i'm in the will of god i know i'm in the will of god and i know because i'm in the will of god i make an expectation of whatever god is going to show me i don't know but when i know one thing for certain that whatever it is it's not only going to benefit me but it'll benefit this church i just don't want to be what they call a message i say that all the time i'm so tired of that stuff i'll never turn my back on this message but i won't see it i want to see it live and i want to see it live in me you need to have a desire to see it live he wants you on fire he gonna get you from being that he is it's okay that means he loves you i've had him spank me a couple of times let me tell y'all something when i had cancer that was a real eye opener i wasn't afraid of death i really wasn't i'm not even now but one thing i did it had me acknowledged in a way i hadn't lived right now because i noticed like i told my son today he's got a gift he called me and he was telling me some things but the thing i told my son said you know what i [Music] i don't want to go feeling like i'm here because feelings can be deceiving satan can deceive you right you all remember that one lady a man who had a husband and left her husband and then she got venereal disease and then she smoked a cigarette and god sent a servant of memphis to her to tell her you know try to get her right i'm just a savior and then when the veil was [Music] [Music] you'll deceive me you told me this that the other where's brother battle somebody gonna get brother around it was too late it's too late we don't go off feelings even even when the preacher preached check him out when i preach check check me out make sure what i'm saying is true i don't mind being corrected i don't [Music] if the approach is correct [Music] you know but you know i look at people and i i see my position you don't understand [Music] [Music] you have your ups and your downs you have things you have to overcome and be delivered [Music] don't tell me this is perfect it's not perfect yet and this is where satan gets us right here [Music] but at the end of this it's so beautiful to know that god took us this way [Music] so that when we get there we won't have a problem [Music] we thank you for your mercy [Music] you know [Music] thank you for this great message that you have given unto us that speak holiness and righteousness we know father god that our holiness and our righteousness we ask these
