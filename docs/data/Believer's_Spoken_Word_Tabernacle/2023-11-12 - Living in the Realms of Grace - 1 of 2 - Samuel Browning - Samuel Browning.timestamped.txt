[7:10] he had hunted in the mountains in
[7:11] Kentucky and you you could have just as
[7:14] easily said for him to move a mountain
[7:16] because that's the that's the uh
[7:18] scripture he was thinking about Lord but
[7:21] he didn't need a mountain moved what he
[7:22] needed was Three Squirrels Lord so you
[7:25] ministered to him personally Lord and
[7:27] said provided Lord what what he needed
[7:30] Lord by the spoken word and also made
[7:32] that scripture much more personal to him
[7:34] and real to him to where he could
[7:37] actually Minister from it Lord so we

[8:05] prayers for us Lord and just even
[8:08] becoming more personal to us Lord
[8:09] through our problems through our trials
[8:11] Lord through our test and each and every
[8:14] one Lord it just allows you to draw it
[8:16] beside us Lord and and and minister to
[8:19] us personally Lord like the the shepherd
[8:21] Lord that had to break the The Little
[8:23] Lamb's leg and he said the little lamb
[8:25] just needed some personal time would
[8:27] never leave Lord this
[8:29] the the shepherd's side again Lord and

[26:30] brain his spinal cord he had no internal
[26:34] injuries to any of his
[26:37] organs how he escaped without that
[26:41] um I know we use the word a lot but it's
[26:44] the only word I have it was a
[26:47] miracle it's an absolute
[26:49] Miracle we were also sent the photos the
[26:52] police took and um if you can believe it
[26:55] those pictures were more disturb in than
[26:58] the ones you see on um on the screen in
[27:02] one picture there's a picture of my son
[27:04] from
[27:05] his mid mid arm here down to his feet
[27:10] still in the driver's side of the
[27:12] car um I recognized his pants I
[27:15] recognized his uh recognized his
[27:18] sweatshirt and U yeah that was that was
[27:21] really tough to see that was really
[27:23] tough to
[27:24] see another picture was um
[27:28] another picture was taken from the back
[27:30] of the car about 10 15 feet uh the
[27:34] police took and you could see his head
[27:36] slumped over on the right hand side and
[27:39] uh yeah that was pretty tough that was
[27:42] pretty tough to see uh I'm not ashamed
[27:46] to admit that I wept
[27:48] uncontrollably uh it was it was it was
[27:51] tough it was
[27:54] tough
[27:56] but but
[28:00] [Applause]
[28:04] God but
[28:07] God rich in
[28:11] Mercy had my son
[28:14] covered P his
[28:16] back however you want to say
[28:19] it and he pull that
[28:22] kid out of the car he pull that kid from
[28:26] the Jaw of death because believe me that
[28:30] car was a death
[28:31] trve and he gave me back my
[28:38] son
[28:40] yes yes
[28:43] yes yes praise the Lord Saints Our God
[28:47] Reigns as if that wasn't a big enough
[28:53] blessing God again showed himself to be
[28:57] might
[28:58] beyond my
[29:00] comprehension there was something else
[29:02] that happened as a result of this
[29:05] accident it was something that I did not
[29:07] expect that I did not see coming in a
[29:10] million
[29:11] years God chose to make it
[29:14] happen now my son and I have always been
[29:18] close uh but we weren't as close as
[29:21] brother Samuel as with his
[29:23] sons we were kind of friendly close we'd
[29:27] hug each other you know when he'd come
[29:29] and go but there was no there was no
[29:32] real real closeness like a father should
[29:35] have a son and that's my fault uh when
[29:39] he was growing up um I had a lot of
[29:41] personal problems and I just couldn't be
[29:44] the father to my children his mother
[29:46] basically raised those children she went
[29:49] to every hockey game she went to every
[29:51] band concert and she went every softball
[29:54] game she went to every parent and
[29:56] teacher conference
[29:57] and not one time not one time did she
[30:00] ever utter a mumbling word at one
[30:05] time that's my little Queen she's been
[30:08] My Little Queen for 40 years she quite a
[30:11] woman quite a
[30:13] woman but something happened in the in
[30:16] in the ICU after that accident that
[30:20] would forever change our
[30:23] relationship now at the same time Ben is
[30:25] dealing with unspeakable pain
[30:28] he has this personal problem rear its
[30:31] ugly head at a very inopportune
[30:35] time and it it compounds the the trouble
[30:40] he's in I mean he's depressed he's
[30:42] guilty he's afraid and then his personal
[30:44] problem comes in out of the blue and
[30:47] gets dumped into his lap he's trying to
[30:49] deal with all
[30:52] this in addition to chronic
[30:55] pain at one point he's laying in his bed
[30:59] and he's just staring straight ahead to
[31:01] where the TV's
[31:02] [Music]
[31:06] at his lips starts to
[31:09] quiver his face gets that blotchy pink
[31:12] color when you're when you're about to
[31:15] cry and he turns his head slowly to the
[31:20] left and he looks at me with those
[31:23] beautiful green eyes of his looks me
[31:26] straight in the face
[31:28] and he utters the
[31:30] words
[31:32] Dad I need your
[31:36] advice I have not heard those words come
[31:39] from that boy 29
[31:43] years
[31:45] dad need your
[31:50] advice I knew right then I knew
[31:56] immediately something momentous that
[31:58] just
[32:00] happened I knew right
[32:05] then that God did
[32:08] something that I had spent years and
[32:11] years and years trying to
[32:14] do God at One Moment In Time healed the
[32:18] breach between my son and my
[32:26] son
[32:28] I can tell you friends all of the years
[32:30] of
[32:31] Shame all of the years of
[32:34] Agony all of the years of
[32:37] disappointment all of the years of anger
[32:40] at
[32:41] myself all of the years of
[32:44] despondency because I had given up that
[32:46] I would ever have that kind of
[32:47] relationship with him I was willing to
[32:49] accept whatever I had it was better than
[32:52] not having him at
[32:54] all all of that in a moment in time was
[33:02] gone God
[33:05] ended my personal help what had been my
[33:09] personal help for
[33:12] years he ended it right

[44:50] seven seal all heaven was
[44:54] silent
[44:58] I tell you these uh the brothers and I
[45:01] know that one thing for sure they they
[45:03] really take it very very serious and I
[45:05] really appreciate that because at
[45:07] leading into worship there's an
[45:08] atmosphere that's created and it's not
[45:11] the song leader does it but it begins
[45:13] there with even that and us coming with
[45:15] an expectation and I just appreciate
[45:18] that the musicians just yielding because
[45:20] amen we're only here just for a few
[45:22] moments amen and there's things that God
[45:25] will do here in our midst that's so
[45:27] important that's Eternal you believe
[45:30] that amen we're we're going to uh
[45:34] prepare to lift a love offering and so
[45:36] as the brothers would come uh at this
[45:39] time and I know there's already those
[45:42] that uh well want understand there's
[45:44] already been some that's been coming in
[45:47] and so forth so and we had told you
[45:49] about that uh from even some weeks ago
[45:51] but we just wanted to lift that
[45:54] today I also also want to remind you as
[45:56] the brothers are coming to do that next
[45:59] Sunday well this coming Thursday brother
[46:01] Timothy aong from GH West Africa will be
[46:04] here with us and that's been a few years
[46:07] since brother Timothy was here and um
[46:11] brother Timothy um he's he had been in
[46:14] the states uh even last year and the
[46:16] year before but he had dealt with uh
[46:18] prostate cancer so the Lord has has
[46:22] healed our brother and so he's been able
[46:24] to come back around and so
[46:26] brother Timothy contacted me I said
[46:28] absolutely we we'll we'll make room for
[46:32] you I just we love brother Timothy amen
[46:36] he's such a the the ministry is just
[46:38] such a blessing um I also have a real
[46:42] special request to that I I'm going to
[46:45] continue to remind you but um brother
[46:48] joshu you know uh he and sister Sharon
[46:51] were married back in February and how
[46:54] did God intervene Ved for her to have
[46:58] that
[46:59] interview to be able to come here it was
[47:02] nothing short of a miracle am now that
[47:05] interview he's over there right now and
[47:08] that interview is going to take place on
[47:10] November
[47:11] 22nd so I I just want us just to
[47:14] continue to fervently
[47:16] pray we know it's a miracle of where it
[47:19] stands right now but I said we're not
[47:22] going to stop praying until her feet are
[47:24] on this soil
[47:28] amen
[47:30] so that's the day before Thanksgiving
[47:33] when she has that interview but I just
[47:34] want to continue to remind you in the
[47:37] upcoming
[47:38] services so as we just prepare to lift

[48:23] we want to say we don't we don't want to
[48:26] take that for granted Lord how your
[48:29] presence Lord how that you come Among Us
[48:33] Lord oh God you you come Among Us Lord
[48:37] to move Lord upon our needs to encourage
[48:41] us Lord to change lives Lord oh Father
[48:46] may you just come Lord this morning once
[48:49] again take us a speaker and hearer
[48:51] together anoint us Lord may we just be
[48:55] Lord just reserved to speak only what it
[48:58] is that you desire to say Lord You've
[49:01] placed certain things Lord on my heart
[49:03] and I just ask that God you'd give me
[49:05] the grace to step aside that we can hear
[49:08] from you this morning Lord I pray that
[49:11] you'll bless this love offering Lord
[49:13] that Lord is we're about to lift and I
[49:16] know Lord there's that which has already
[49:18] gone into it Lord and I pray that you'll
[49:21] bless your children Lord father we
[49:23] certainly aren't a aren't a wealthy or a
[49:26] rich group of people Lord but Lord we're
[49:28] just thankful in what little little Lord
[49:31] that we have Lord that God we can place
[49:34] it Lord into your hands and to know that
[49:36] God father it's you that Lord that takes
[49:40] Lord the little Lord there's much in it
[49:43] Lord now may you just guide and direct
[49:46] Lord we pray father bless your children

[49:53] Lord bless us this morning in your
[49:55] presence Lord as you would come and
[49:57] speak to our hearts once again we love
[50:00] you and we thank you father in Jesus
[50:03] name amen amen God bless
[50:06] you um I want to say boy doesn't this
[50:10] look
[50:12] nice and
[50:14] uh brother um brother Sean and and
[50:18] brother Brian Holden have certainly
[50:21] labored quite a bit and I'll say that uh
[50:24] when uh brother Sean has to tap brother
[50:26] Brian come in on some of the technical
[50:28] part but as far as all the research and
[50:31] I mean there's there's things Beyond
[50:33] this what you see in order to make this
[50:35] happen there's things down here there's
[50:37] thing wiring that's been run and uh
[50:40] different things to make it um uh usable
[50:44] even to where when we need to plug in up
[50:47] here we can plug in and and have it run
[50:49] so it's widescreen and uh you might you
[50:52] know you might think well why did we
[50:53] have to go to the the WID screen screen
[50:55] well you know even when most some of the
[50:57] brothers come in with PowerPoint or if I
[50:59] want to do something I always have to
[51:01] think because all of your setups now
[51:03] want to go strictly to widescreen and
[51:06] have been for years so uh it's it's nice
[51:10] to be able to have that and so brother
[51:12] Brian hopefully doesn't have to sweat
[51:14] too
[51:14] much
[51:16] when you know you always love about
[51:18] brother Brian there's no question what
[51:19] he's thinking when a problem is solved
[51:24] you but I I I I trust that there's been
[51:27] that of the burden being able to take
[51:29] off of him and brother Brian's always
[51:31] one of those if I tell him I have a
[51:33] slide or I have something to show hey
[51:35] hey hey I I need it give me your iPad
[51:36] give me your I want to test this I I
[51:38] want to check this out so I appreciate
[51:40] that don't you amen I I really
[51:43] appreciate that
[51:44] so amen well we love you in the lord
[51:47] it's certainly good to be good to be
[51:49] back home good to be back with you and
[51:51] uh just so thankful for your prayers as
[51:53] we were gone and uh we just want to turn
[51:56] our attention to the word of the Lord
[51:58] this morning and ask if you'll turn with
[52:01] me in Revelations chap
[52:05] 12 and
[52:08] uh I want
[52:11] to also say I just so appreciate I've
[52:15] seen uh little Aaron here sitting on the
[52:18] front row and my goodness that is you
[52:21] know I I I didn't I didn't ask him to
[52:22] sit on the front row but it's one of
[52:25] those things that here he's he's made
[52:27] that that move and I really appreciate
[52:29] that and just getting in and and I'll
[52:31] tell you um he's one that I can always
[52:35] uh among the young people we on our
[52:37] Bible study there on uh on on the Friday
[52:40] nights Aron's always one I can count on
[52:42] to get the discussion
[52:44] going and I really enjoy that there's a
[52:47] lot of good points and a lot of things
[52:49] that he has to you know grasp and and
[52:52] say and then we start probing around
[52:54] with the other young people people but I
[52:55] really I really appreciate that amen and
[52:58] uh brother Brian Jr came and did the
[53:01] Bible study for us on sun on on H Friday
[53:04] evening and my just a wonderful job and
[53:07] we certainly had a wonderful time uh
[53:10] together there so uh my it was just it
[53:12] was really
[53:14] good verse uh Revelations 12 and and
[53:18] verse
[53:20] one now I'm just going to go ahead and
[53:22] warn you I'm not going to dive deep into
[53:24] this on Revelation 12 but I just want to
[53:26] bring together certain certain parts of
[53:28] showing where that the Church of the
[53:31] Living God where we're where we are
[53:33] standing in this hour and uh the thought
[53:36] that I want to speak on uh today is
[53:39] living in the Realms of Grace Living in
[53:43] the Realms of Grace So in Revelations 12
[53:46] verse1 and I say that because there's a
[53:48] lot of you could go into every one of
[53:50] these little points and we could spend a
[53:52] month of Sundays on it but we just want
[53:53] to get to the point here verse one and
[53:56] there appeared a great Wonder in heaven
[53:59] a woman clothed with the sun and the
[54:02] moon under her feet and upon her head a
[54:06] crown of 12 stars and she being with
[54:10] child cried travailing in birth and pain
[54:13] to be delivered and there appeared
[54:15] another Wonder in heaven and behold a
[54:18] great red dragon having seven horns uh
[54:21] seven heads and 10 horns and seven
[54:24] crowns of upon his head we we know
[54:26] that's Rome right and his tail drew the
[54:31] third part of the stars of Heaven the
[54:33] prophet of God comes and takes that in
[54:35] verse four and he tell takes that word
[54:37] tail and it's t a l e it's not a literal
[54:41] Tale But it's the tale the lie that he
[54:45] told his tail drew the third part of the
[54:47] stars of heaven and did cast them to the
[54:50] earth and the dragon stood before the
[54:53] woman which was ready to to be delivered
[54:56] for to devour her child as soon as it
[54:59] was born so who was it that tried to
[55:04] destroy the Christ
[55:07] child who was that that came after
[55:10] him am I in a Bible
[55:14] Church it was Rome right Satan and Satan
[55:18] and in inspiring and was coming after
[55:22] verse 5 and she brought forth a Manchild
[55:26] who was to rule all nations with a rod
[55:29] of iron and her child was caught up unto
[55:32] God and to his throne may God bless the
[55:35] reading of the word as you're being
[55:37] seated I want to just uh just just to
[55:41] refer here just a few moments here
[55:43] within Revelations 12 so you kind of get
[55:46] my direction that I I want to go here in
[55:50] looking back at that first verse there
[55:52] appeared a great Wonder in heaven a
[55:55] woman we know that represents a church
[55:57] clothed with the sun and the moon under
[56:02] her feet and upon her head a crown of 12
[56:06] stars now that sun itself it it
[56:09] represents the dispensation of grace and
[56:12] the moon the dispensation of law out of
[56:15] questions and answers law having a
[56:17] shadow brother Bram says it like this
[56:19] this woman was travailing she was going
[56:21] to bring forth a child and she was
[56:24] standing there the sun rising at her
[56:26] head the moon going under her feet it's
[56:29] done passed away she's done live through
[56:32] the dispensation of law so the moon
[56:35] spoke of that of the law Paul speaking
[56:40] seeing have having the Shadow the law
[56:43] had a shadow of good things to come just
[56:46] a shadow the sun was the perfect and now
[56:50] they can't both Shine the same time the
[56:52] law could hang but it won't shine
[56:55] because the gospel outshines it the moon
[56:58] can hang here 12:00 in the day and you
[57:01] have to look very close to see it
[57:03] because the sun's so much brighter till
[57:06] it just outshines it it may be still
[57:08] hanging there to show that it was last
[57:11] night but its light's done gone that's
[57:14] the law the Law's light has done gone
[57:17] and live now it's a gospel of
[57:20] dispensation of grace and the power of
[57:23] the Holy Ghost and the resurrected Jesus
[57:26] Christ manifesting himself in a greater
[57:30] light than that so as we we see that as
[57:34] the as we open up it it it you know many
[57:38] of scripture have a compound meaning in
[57:41] one part of this here scripture it
[57:43] speaks of the Jewish Orthodox Church of
[57:45] where that little Remnant there was a
[57:47] little Remnant who was expecting and
[57:50] waiting on the Messiah brother Brown
[57:53] takes that even in the message birth
[57:54] pains and he'll actually call them out
[57:56] by name you had Simeon you had Anna just
[57:59] a small little group that was actually
[58:02] waiting on the consolation of Israel yet
[58:05] we could have asked you could have asked
[58:07] many others of the Pharisees and
[58:09] different ones throughout and say are
[58:11] you really waiting but you know there's
[58:13] the difference between knowledge and
[58:16] Revelation Revelation itself is what
[58:19] really Burns in your heart it's a it's a
[58:21] reality it's something that's more than
[58:24] just a form or a tradition or just what
[58:27] you know is right but there's a reality
[58:29] and even under the law there was a
[58:32] measure of reality that could be given
[58:34] to the children of God that they could
[58:37] expect and look forward in their day in
[58:40] their time to this coming promise of the
[58:44] Messiah and so they were awaiting for
[58:47] this of the Messiah which which here she
[58:49] brings forth uh the the the child she
[58:52] brings forth Christ and then then after
[58:56] his his uh crucifixion and rising from
[59:00] from the dead and sending back his life
[59:02] now that same life operates in the early
[59:05] church how many remember in the
[59:07] scripture I think it's 2 John
