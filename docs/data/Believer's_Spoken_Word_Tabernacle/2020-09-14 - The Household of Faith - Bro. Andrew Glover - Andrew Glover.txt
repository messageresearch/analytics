have to today no for a long time a l of you don't know this I was then going into due to my diabetic condition and things weren't looking too good my gfrs were constantly dropping dropping dropping dropping dropping and you know my family they were praying and all of them you know and incessantly and my doctor he was concerned my new doctor Dr Carbone he was very concerned and he was saying Tom you're going to have to see a nefrologist and go through all this and and usually uh when you're you start going in renal failure two things can happen neither one of them is good one of them you may have to go to dialysis and one of might not be able to put you on dialysis then you just die so you know the devil put that fear upon you and today I was sitting back there and listening to brother Glover preach he talk about that guardian angel that we all have and I thought back the times in my life where I needed that and it was always there for me God don't take you to a cliff and just drop you off he's there from birth to death and you can't leave until he's done with you amen so I've had this burden on my heart and and my heaviness of my chest and you I know from my medical experience I deal with Labs I know what gfrs are I know what Crea BUN levels are and all that and M didn't look good at all did not look good at all so he said I'm going have to send you in in for renal um ultrasound so I went in for the renal ultrasound I said well I'll get the bad news from it whenever he gets the results you know you always have that doubt but still yet there was just something deeper than the doubt that's inside of you you know that God he's not going to let you go until he's done with you Hallelujah so I went to his office and he said here's your Arenal results he said your kidneys are perfect you know everything looks good Hallelujah I said thank the Lord for that amen he said but your GFR your creatinine level your bun is way too high your gfrs are dropping he said that you're going have to drink more fluids and whatever you know and I thought well I going to do more than that cuz I know I've seen I I've had patients 17 years of nursing I've seen it go I've seen what happens to kidney patients so we went out to eat today and me and Brian the kids and I come back home and I was sitting or standing in the living room and all of a sudden I got a phone call I said who in the world be calling me at this time it was my doctor Dr carbon he said I I I need to talk to you I got something to tell you I said oh God you know your first impression is I'm a gner either he's going to tell me I'm going have to go to nephrologist and get on a uh dialysis or something because it goes so low they have to because your kidneys clean your blood and without your kidneys function you know you'll die so I went in the back room by sh with the doctor on the phone he said Tom he said you're GFR it was 42 when I went in the other day he said your gfrs are 55 I said well praise God I said you know doctor we're Christians and we go to church praise God and we believe in God hallelujah and we believe that he can heal and he said there is a higher power sir amen yes FR back Sister Rita sitting here she's fac oh you're going her now you got cancer cancer ain't nothing to God right amen Tom you got kidney failure kidney failure ain't nothing to God we're not going to leave here until he's done with us I just like I was telling Samuel Samuel was standing there and uh I no he's kind of fidgety I was playing my goodar all a sudden he looked over here he got I said oh God you going to tell me I got my B up too loud so he comes over there puts his hand on me said I want to pray for you and he he pray a sincere prayer prise Our God I'll never forget it thank you Lord and I believe it's through your your prayers my family I don't think anybody else knew about it but my family they have their nightly devotionals that always remember Grandpa Sam pray for me many

thank you so much this is is as Rosanne comes and gets ready amen and I believe they said that number that he talked about that number it's medically impossible for that number to go up because that

his mercy and Grace We Trust something was said this morning to bless you and to help you and to encourage you and just pray that your your faith was strengthened just have a simple thought here on my heart tonight and we the devil's battling our voice but by God's grace we'll we'll battle back amen hallelujah in the book of Galatians here the sixth chapter we want to read from the 10th verse and we sure want to say once again it's been an honor to be here with you this weekend and sure glad to have my wife here with me and we sure always enjoy coming up this way and seeing the Believers here and the Saints and I sure appreciate brother Samuel and his wife and family and their friendship and been privileged to do some meetings together with brother Samuel and then hallelujah this year everything just changed but God's still in control amen amen but we sure appreciate brother Samuel and his stand for the for the message and for the ministry and just thinking of all the camps we got to do together last year and just seeing the power of God move and working together I think that's what we're here to do is to defeat the Devil in every aspect that we can so we sure thank the Lord for his mercy and Grace here in the book of Galatians the 6th chapter I want to read from the 10th verse Paul here writing says as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith we have opportunity let us do good unto all men but especially unto them who were of the household of faith and then I'd like to look in the book of Ephesians the 2 chapter Ephesians the 2 chapter and looking there in the 19th verse uh Paul writing again here in the letter to the Ephesians I was just studying the other day and heard brother B say Paul wrote the book of Romans and Galatians and Ephesians and all those books he said but to me he said Paul was not just writing to anybody he was writing to Believers and I think tonight we're here as Believers so in the 19th verse he says now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and are built somebody shout built built and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone notice here in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy Temple in the Lord in whom ye also are builded together now you're not builded divided but you're builded together for a habitation of God through the spirit we ask Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word let's just bow our hearts together here and humble our Spirits in his presence and just ask him to speak to us tonight Heavenly Father Lord as your believing children have gathered here on this Sunday evening father Lord as I just walked into the sanctuary and just felt your presence moving through the building Lord I Thank you that we are here tonight I thank you that we're able Lord to still be able to feel your presence dear God lord as I was just reading the other day Lord where your Prophet said in sh report there in 1963 he said the time will come when it'll be past time feeling and Lord past feeling time and Lord I think tonight of how that so many Lord have have gone beyond Lord the the message of the hour and they've gone beyond your word and they've went into things of intellectualism and all kinds of things Lord that have numbed them dear God but Lord I Thank you that there is a bride here on the earth tonight that when you begin to Lord move in the mberry bushes it was when you begin to Lord begin to move to the meeting we still are able to feel you and for that tonight God we're grateful and Lord I pray tonight God that you would just send a coal of fire up off the altar Lord may you strengthen our voice for this meeting tonight Lord may you not anoint me only to preach but may you anoint the people to pull and receive also and father I pray tonight God in this weekend of services Lord that you would just break through tonight for the people Lord may may you just come down father may they push through every tiredness every weariness oh God and Lord maybe they're looking for a blessing in these Services Maybe they're looking for an answer or a direction God I pray tonight in the name of Jesus Christ by The Same Spirit that raised my Lord from the dead May that same Spirit come in this building tonight and may it break every barrier may it break every wall may it tear down every veil of tradition and ritualism oh God and Lord May your children begin to feel the refreshing from the presence of God lord may you move in a mighty way Among Us and Lord whatever is accomplished in this service whether it be healing salvation Deliverance whatever would be oh God God we'll be sure to give you all the honor and all the praise and all the glory for it's in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers said amen amen amen and may God richly bless you this evening amen you love the Lord amen amen from those scriptures tonight if the Lord would help me for just a few moments tonight I would like to by the help of the Lord maybe speak to here and if I would title this tonight I want to speak to you on uh the household of faith the household of faith and I I believe that we're living in a very Troublesome time believe we're living in a time of turmoil I believe we're living in a time of chaos and confusion and I believe we're living in a time of attack I believe that the devil prophet of God would say is attacking from every direction every angle every every place the devil can find the area to get in and attack the devil will take that area to attack the Church of the Living God and I believe it's not necessarily an attack on our Doctrine I don't believe it's necessarily an attack maybe on our church building or where we stand uh maybe the things that we believe but I believe it's an attack on our faith I I I really believe that the devil is Desiring amen Satan is Desiring uh for the church to forget and begin to fear amen now the devil has desires as well as God has desires and brother said this way or rather paraphrasing here Satan is Desiring the church to forget and to fear but I believe at the same time amen that God is Desiring the church to remember amen and believe so Satan is Desiring the Church to forget and fear God is Desiring the church to remember and believe brother man would say here and letting off the pressure oh how Satan would desire to take us quickly amen from the scene right in the midst of the battle amen Satan's desire is to take us out of the battle his desire is to take us out of the fight now let me just say it this way not necessarily just to take us out of the fight amen but to take the fight out of us amen that we would lose our desire to fight we would we would lose our our Zeal to go forward we would become amen complacent we would become formal we would become lukor and just stay with at but if we're going to get anywhere amen then we've got to be willing to fight now we cannot forget that and I I think it's amazing how that Satan desires amen for us to forget and fear but God desires for us to remember and believe and if you actually studying science uh any any time you'll find that science has proved that there is a connection between fear and memory there is actually a direct connection nection amen that when somebody begins to stress when they begin to have anxiety when they begin to fear or they begin to become depressed that it can actually cause forgetfulness amen amen it can cause confusion it can it can cause difficulty on concentrating amen and other problems that disrupt daily activities or it can remove them from doing what they should do Amen to doing what they wouldn't normally do fear is a powerful force amen amen fear can come in and if fear grips a church amen it if it grips a pull pit it'll grip the pews if it grips the pews it'll grip the amen the music fear has a power of gripping amen but I don't think we've come here tonight to fear the devil amen I don't think we've come here to fear what the devil can do to us amen but I believe we've come here tonight because we remember who we are amen amen we remember who we are amen I think it's amazing how that you would you would begin to look at how Satan desires the church or the children of God to begin to fear amen and begin to forget now you would Sayer why would Satan uh desire for the children of God to forget and fear in the message the kinsman redeemer he says who has the most power before God Amen what is an angel an angel is a servant is that right amen they are his servants but what are you amen you are his sons and daughters and who has amen the most power in heaven a sinner that's been saved by grace or an archangel that's standing by his right side he said the sinner that's been saved by grace has more Authority in heaven than the Archangel that has stood by his side without sin because he is a son amen and a son has more Authority than a servant of course amen oh he says we forget what we are amen we forget many times what made us what we are and after we become what we are then we forgot how we got here amen we forget what we are we forget many times what made us what we are and after we become what we are then we forget what God is here I just want to stop here for a second and say amen that the Church of the Living God and the Bride of Jesus Christ did not get to where she's at tonight amen by fear amen but we got here by faith amen we didn't get here by amen by depression or by anxiety or by by by by nervousness but we come to this place by faith amen and I think if faith has brought us this far amen then faith will take us the rest of the way amen now there is a reason then why Satan amen wants us to forget our faith brother R would say now faith is a law of God see the same thing all this power of God that we're talking about is accessible To Us by faith all things are possible if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but you believe what you said come to pass you can have it see it's accessible to you if you've got the law there it is see the law is faith that controls all things amen now fear does not open the power of God Amen fear does not open the Supernatural amen fear does not open the power of God to deliver an individual amen but faith is the law of God that opens all the blessings of God to the church then Satan's greatest fear amen is the church what access amen the power of God Amen the prophet of God said Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that can do the Greater Works then she will be an invincible Army amen he if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit amen then Satan will be powerless before her amen somebody shout Satan will be powerless before her amen he will be as definitely thed which means prevented today as when Christ with stood his every effort Amen to gained power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it amen because with true Revelation in our lives amen we will prevail over the Gates of Hell amen now remember Satan wants the church amen to forget who they are can you say amen amen Satan wants the church to forget amen what made her what she is amen Satan wants the church to forget amen who called her and who ordained her and who elected her amen he wants you to forget that amen because if you remember that amen and by faith you begin to believe that amen then you can access the power of God Amen but let me tell you why Satan wants you to forget it amen is because he remembers amen what happened before when the church got a hold of the power of God Amen he remembers Amen in Luke the 10th chapter amen the 70 returned again with joy amen saying Lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name and he said unto them I beheld Satan amen as lightning fall from heaven and he said behold I give unto you power Amen to tread upon serpents and upon scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you amen the prophet said that was immediately after that Jesus give his disciples power amen over unclean spirits and he said I beheld Satan fall amen from heaven like lightning now what amazes me is the disciples went out amen and they begin to access the power of God they begin to manifest The Works of God they begin to see demons becoming subject Amen to them when they would speak the name of Jesus and it released such a joy in them amen it released such a power in them that they come running back to Jesus and said Jesus let me tell you what happened he said but before it happened amen while you were doing it amen I saw Satan fall from Heaven like lightning amen but watch here he said see the power of that church moving forward had upset the whole Kingdom of Satan you see and he saw him as he dropped from his places because God had given again amen power to his church amen he was cast Plum out of the holy places and everything you see by the power amen of that church of them having Power and Jesus said I give you power over unclean spirits amen and they really upset the kingdom of Satan oh I love this then what could we do with it today the power of God amen work then then what can we do today as the Church of the Living God with the power of God Amen I'll say it this way Satan he is not so much afraid of just the ministry accessing the power of God Amen he is not just afraid amen of a prophet accessing the power of God Amen he is not afraid of your pastor accessing the power of God he is not afraid of a deacon amen accessing the power of God but he does not want the Ley Amen to realize this is more amen than just a Ministry of power this is more than just a propit of power amen but this is a body of power that the same power that is in the head amen has come into the body and if the head defeated the devil then there's a body on the earth that's going to defeat the Devil as well oh church I tell you that power is not a million miles away that power is right here in this building tonight there is enough power in this church that if one housewife amen if one father if one young person would reach up right now by faith and get a hold of that power you've got the power tonight amen to defeat every demon out of hell you've got the power tonight amen to overcome every symptom of whatever sickness of doctor a might have told you you had hey I'm not talking about a weak church I'm not talking about a powerless church I'm talking about a church amen that is in touch with God he do not want to lay it to access the power of God if you look at Luke 24 the Bible said ter ye until you be ued with what power from on high in the book of Acts chapter one he said you shall receive what power in Acts chapter 2 amen the power came amen upon 120 seeds amen who hauled themselves in the upper room amen but God was not just wanting Amen to manifest his power in the apostles he was not just wanting to manifest his power Amen in Mary and those that was in the upper room amen but in Acts chapter 3 amen there were two preachers with that power amen that come out of the upper room amen and they went walking by the gate called beautiful and they found a man that had been laying there for many years amen and now the power of God that was in those preachers amen went into that man and the Bible said Peter said silver and gold amen Have I None but such as I have give I Thee in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk and the Bible says immediately amen immediately there was strength that went into his feet into his ankle bones and he stood up the prophet of God said that never amen the sermon the de or that Peter then preached on the day of Pentecost and 3,000 Souls were added that never shook the devil's Kingdom he said he never as much as even got out of bed he said because he knew that if they were just preaching it if they were just talking about it amen then there was nothing to worry about he said but when that man got up he said the devil roll over in his bed and said now amen there's somebody else got that power and I don't know about you tonight amen but I believe what a prophet of God said when he said the pillar of fire amen came in the upper room and it began to break apart and a liquid in there and a liquid in there and he said when we come together amen the pillar of fire amen comes back together in the fullness of its power church I don't know about you tonight amen but we we are not fooled we are not fooled by theology we are not fooled by personalities amen because we've done seen the real thing and when you see the real thing then the false can't fool you and the caral impersonation can't fool you when you see amen the power of God Amen come down in the church and manifest itself as only God can do it will not fool a real believer yes sir there is there is a real genuine amen baptism of the holy spirit that brings the same results amen that they got on the day of Pentecost amen that I think when we begin to hear these things what we need to do amen is we need to sharpen amen our spiritual memory in second Peter chap 3:1 the Bible said this Second Epistle beloved I now write unto you in both which I stir up your pure Minds by the way of remembrance that you may be mindful of The Words which were spoken before by the holy prophets amen and of the Commandment of us as the apostles of the Lord and Savior amen how many can say that we all need reminders amen from time to time amen we all need reminders now I believe that we need reminders especially in the present hour we're now living in amen I think we need to be reminded sometimes of who we are amen of whose we are and of where we are going amen amen remember tonight who you are amen you are the Bride of Jesus Christ amen remember whose you are you belong to the Lord Jesus Christ then don't forget where you're going amen you're going in the Rapture amen see those reminders amen actually refresh our spiritual memory I think of how in the Bible amen it says we should call to mind these things how in like Deuteronomy 32 and S we should call to mind amen the past mercies of God he says remember the days of old and consider the years of many generations ask the father and he will show thee thy elders and they will tell thee amen I believe tonight amen I'm just going to preach here for a minute that we need some young people amen that can remember God if this thing should car 15 more years if it should car 20 more years I think we need some young men that can raise up and say I remember how the power of God would fall in the church I think we need some young ladies that can raise up and say I remember how that God moved in the church amen I think we need some people that can remember these things and can pass it down from generation to generation amen I think we need to remember amen the wonderful works of God when you see God do something it's not something to take lightly it's something that you should you should etch it in your mind amen you should write it upon your heart for David said I will remember the works of the Lord surely I will remember thy wonders of old I will meditate also of all thy works and talk of all thy doings I think we need to call to mind amen that though we are surrounded by all kinds of negativity amen though we are sured by all kinds of trouble amen that the Lord is still a deliverer Amen in Jonah 2:7 he said when my soul faint within me I remember the Lord and my my prayer came unto him amen into the in thy Holy Temple I think we need to remember amen the death of Christ how that amen after this manner he took the cup and and the cup is the New Testament in my blood this D is y as you drink and remember to me I think we need to be reminded amen of what the blood done for us I think we need to be reminded amen of what Calvary really was amen for as often as you eat this bread and you drink this cup amen you do show forth the Lord's death until he come amen I think when we begin to remember these things when we begin to call to mind the past mercies of God when we begin to call to mind amen how that God Amen delivered Jonah and how that God Amen delivered all those before us I believe when we begin to renew our spiritual memory then it begins to bring a joy to us how that David would say my soul shall be satisfied as with tomorrow in fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips when I remember thee upon my bed and meditate on me in the night watches amen see when David begin to remember amen David begin to get happy amen when David begin to remember amen David begin to shout he begin to rejoice and the prophet said oh my don't think I'm excited I know where I am no it's just feels good when I get to thinking about that amen see there is one among us see that's what I'm trying to tell you tonight is you've got to remember friends that God has not left us he is still with us he is still for us he is still in us he is still behind us oh somebody shout there is one Among Us amen there is one Among Us who is among us tonight it's not the president it's not the governor it's Jesus Christ amen the Son of God and I think of is here tonight we ought to do everything our power Amen to make him welcome we ought to make it welcome amen I tell you like a prophet of God said he said see what's wrong is you don't realize who's here he said you don't realize who's knocking on your door he said you don't realize who's trying to get in he said let me take a minute and tell you who it is it's the king of glory it's the Mighty God it's Elohim it's MDC that made Abraham he said it's the God Amen that healed blind it's the god that raised Lazarus from the dead it's the God Amen that walked on water it's the god that opened the eyes the that God has come down here tonight and he's not come here to bind you he has come here to loose you oh I think tonight church we ought to just take a minute and just start praising God Amen and let him know we remember him we remember what he done for us we remember where he brought us done we remember amen the snares that he kept us out of we remember the traps that he took us away from church when we begin to remember these things then there becomes a faith in the church amen we remember how God healed one brother amen we remember how God healed one sister and when we begin to remember amen that it begins to cause Faith Amen to begin to chug on the inside of your soul and somebody stands up and says if he did it one time he can do it again I don't know about y'all tonight but I'm feeling one of them oldfashioned amen St Paul revivals and the Bible hold I don't know about y'all but I'm feeling amen them oldfashioned amen devil stomping sin chasing amen Holy Ghost fill meetings when people just let go and let God have his way and they remember what God done for oh brother Andrew he ain't done nothing for me I can't remember nothing amen yes you can he woke you up this morning he's kept you another day in Satan's Eden in your right mind that's enough to praise God for oh come on church amen he deserves Our Praise when he begins to be praised then blessings begin to come down oh we need to be reminded who we are we need to be reminded who we are we need to be reminded of where we're going amen I thank you how the Bible says amen how that the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things amen somebody shout all things all to your remembrance amen who whatsoever I have said unto you amen now how many knows that it's good to get those reminders we live in a day and time where you got to have a reminder amen I think of how just a few days ago a brother in our church he actually sent a reminder out just a just a little text on his heart and he said this he said you know just to some brothers in our church he said you know as the head of your household you can literally place the token over your wife and kids while everyone is growing weary and they're feeding off of media us as a head amen can place the blood over our loved ones and keep them covered we've heard this he said but it became so real to me while praying over my family this morning while they slept it's our duty as men but it's also our privilege and brother Samuel when I heard that word household I begin to think what is a household amen a household is of one's own house amen belonging to a house amen a family domestic domestic or or intimate belonging to one's household it means to be related by blood amen it means to be the adherence to it means to be devoted to in Deuteronomy 16:5 thou mayest not sacrifice the Passover within any of the gates which the Lord thy God giveth thee but at the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to place his name amen see where thou shalt sacrifice the Passover at evening at the going down of the Sun at the season thou camest forth out of Egypt amen Paul would say it this way amen for by one Spirit are you with me tonight for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit amen the prophet picks this up and says 1 Corinthians 12 says by one spirit amen the spirit of God which is the lifegiver to the word the seed Amen to vindicate that seed for the season amen by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body and that body is a family it's the family of God that's the house of God and the house of God is the name of Jesus Christ then the name of the Lord is a mighty tower and the righteous run into it and are safe now now he says it this way I have chose to put my name at the door the house of My Worship notice for my family amen will be gathered in there under the blood like it was in Egypt anything outside died and in there there is no leaven bread there is no denominational mixture in it anywhere I love this my house amen my children amen born of my jeans amen glory to God he said my jeans are in them I put my word in them and I'll write them upon the tables of their heart that's my family the family of the body of Jesus Christ the family and this door you'll come in not Methodist Baptist or Pentecostal but the door where I put my name amen then Paul comes along and says for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family amen in Heaven and Earth is name brother sister I don't know if it's dawned on you or not amen but the people sitting around you are not your just not your church affiliates amen they're not just church Associates amen but in this building tonight is the household of God in this building tonight is the family of Jesus Christ brother how did we get in here we didn't come in amen through some Baptist door we didn't come in through some Pentecostal door amen but we came in amen through the door Jesus Christ and by coming in that door we have been born in this family hallu oh I don't know if you catch it or not amen but you're the household of God Amen you're family tonight amen you're not you're not enemies you're family tonight amen you're not you're not adversaries this is the family of God you say well brother Andrew there's no way I fit in the family of God Amen I didn't put you in I can't take you out amen the people that likes you didn't put you in and the people that dislikes you can't take you out amen God put you in this family amen God draws your name on the Lamb's Book of Life from before the foundation of the world Amen and he will write his name he will put his word he will establish his family then you say brother what kind of household is this it is the household of unadulterated Faith amen Paul says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for it's the evidence of Things Not Seen amen what does that word substance mean it means foundation in Hebrews 3:14 for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence amen steadfast unto the end in the stature of a perfect man he said see faith is the foundation of it all and when you're a skeptic of the Bible when you're a skeptic of the word being right you might as well just stay back until first you believe it he says what is sin it's unbelief there's only two elements that controls the human being that's either doubt or faith one or the other see you are possessed of one that dominates your life and just depends on how much Faith you have is how high you can rise see then faith is the key to go higher amen fear is the key to go lower amen faith is the key Amen to rise into Heavenly places amen but fear is the key to go into depression and to go into anxiety oh faith and doubt will not mix together and neither will fear and faith mix together amen the pro of God said that the fall in the garden produced a hybrid Faith amen what is a hybrid Faith it'll take what a man says and it'll mix it with what God says he said that's what the church has got today amen the so-called church is a hybrid Faith amen it's mixed with fears it's mixed with doubts it's mixed with frustrations if it was genuine faith it wouldn't move I'll tell you tonight friends amen the reason I'm going to preach here for a second amen the reason why we got message preachers around this message amen pointing people amen the psychologist is because they're not of the household of faith amen the reason why this message amen we've got people pointing alcoholics amen the Alcoholics Anonymous is because they have left the household of faith amen the reason why we got young people that can't get victory over pornography and they're told to go through this rehab and go through this rehab is because we' mixed the word of God with a bunch of fear that it won't work but in the name of Jesus Christ I condemn every fear I cast every fear away and I invite the faith of the Son of God to come in this church and I'll shout it with everything within me I don't care how big your problem is I don't care how strong your addiction is I don't care how far in prison you are my God Is Bigger my God is stronger my God is more mightier he is a powerful force he is not a god of psychology he is a god of power and that power is in this building tonight that no matter what you're going through you can rise above it no matter what you're facing you can shake it off is there any Eagles here tonight that'll just say I want to spread my wings I want to go a little bit higher I want to soar in the heavenli faith can take you there fear will take you away from it he said a hybrid Faith amen makes a beautiful church but it's a dead church that's right yes sir in Jude chapter 1 the Bible says we are contending amen for the faith I'm trying to I'm trying to get through this so stay with me amen the faith that was once delivered to the Saints amen then we are not contending amen for a church Faith we are not contending for a man's Faith amen but tonight we are contending for the unadulterated Faith amen let me tell you who amen made possible Hebrews 11 was the faith of God it was not a hbri faith it was not a man-made faith it was the unadulterated Faith what does the word unadulterated mean it means not mixed or diluted with any different or extra elements it is complete and absolute having no inferior added substance it is pure amen then I tell you tonight what we need is a pure message and that's what we got what we need is a pure pulpit and that's what we got what we need is some pure pews and that's what we got I tell you tonight if you're trying to mix this and mix that and mix this and mix that Amen to make a way of Deliverance you're wasting your time we have already got a way of Deliverance it's through the unadulterated faith of Jesus Christ it's not a halfway Faith somebody shout it is an absolute Faith oh when you see him come down and manifest himself just exactly like he did in the days gone by then you should have all together amen pure unadulterated faith in him and accept him on those real grounds amen can I take a few moments and tell you tonight what real unadulterated faith is it is taking God at his word regardless of what man says it is believing God in the eye of the storm it is raising your hands and praising him when you don't have no other reason to praise him it is coming to church when you've got every excuse to stay home it is shouting when you've got every excuse to sit there come on church I'm not talking about a hybrid faith I'm talking about the faith of God that is returned in this generation to start a bride's Revival in the heart of every member of this bride I don't know what you want tonight amen but I want a church with pure amen unadulterated faith in the Lord Jesus Christ that is not just there when we need it but it is predominating it is the reason we are gathering amen the prophet would say A True Believer is soundly solid based on Christ and there's nothing will shake him but because it's you're waving and pulling off to one side that's the reason you have these things happen in your life amen but true unadulterated faith will hold you safely against the cross it will in spite of what you go through amen the faith of God will hold you amen I know this is simple but I want to talk to you tonight for a minute the prophet of God said we're going to sail through treacherous Waters he would say and we're sailing through them now amen but I love what he said but there's already stabilizers amen there's already stabilizers that has been put on the ship amen then that tells me no matter how hard the winds blow we're going to make it no matter how hard the rain falls we're going to make it no matter how dark the night gets we are going to make it to the other side what does unadulterated Faith do it holds fast the promise of of God in the token he said being baptized by this token into the body of Christ 1 Corinthians 12 amen now we are subjects Amen to the gifts of the Spirit that's in there Amen in him is all the fullness in him is all the fullness of God all the fullness of the promise when you're baptized in him we have every promise that God made is laid at our fingertips there is no sin in there there is no death in there even sickness can't stay in his presence if Satan then puts his hands to you and tres to tempt you into something you just hold your token in your hand and show it that you are a redeemed product of Jesus Christ amen he said let your unadulterated Faith wave that token there and say I am a product I am a product that Jesus Christ bought come on church that's the key to your Victory is being able to stand being able to stand in the face of opposition amen and wave your token he said when you do that then sickness will flee amen can I tell you tonight amen we have not been invited Amen to go to the enemy's camp we have not been invited Amen to go down into hell tonight amen but we have been invited into the household of faith where all things are possible amen you're invited to the house of Jesus Christ he is expecting you there [Applause] tonight do you love him tonight amen I may slow down here for a minute because I want to drive this home there are two spirits in the land today there is the spirit of fear and there is the spirit of Faith amen the prophet of God says there are two elements that controls the entire human race in the world and one of them is fear and the other is Faith now it's either fear or faith controls amen Every Nation every denomination every individual you either fear or faith that controls you amen now don't tell me we're not living in a time of fear amen we're living in a in the in in the in the height of a time of fear when the media is scaring people amen when the newspaper scaring people amen when the doctor says it's good one day and the doctor says it's bad the next day when one day they say wear a mask and the next day they say don't when one day they say go here and the next day they say don't and that fear is gripping the minds of people to where they're not acting like humans where they're scared to come out of their houses where they're scared to be around people where they're scared to come to church but let me remind you tonight we are not of the household of fear we are of the household of faith I refuse to fear I refuse to be spared I refuse to let the spirit of fear stop me from praying I refuse to let the spirit of fear amen stop me from worshiping I refuse to let the spirit of fear bind me in a prison house thank you Lord say brother Andrew you're not you're not you're not acting like you got good sense I do have good sense I don't go around licking door handles and I use gerat but I refuse to fear I refuse to be scared amen I know fear is not what got me here fear is not what's going to get me home but the same faith that they had when polio was here the same Faith they had when the plagues broke out in Israel it's the same faith that is in the Bride of Jesus Christ today let me shout it I refuse to fear I am not of the household of fear I am of the household of faith if you have got a spirit of fear on you right now shake it off if you got a demon of fear trying to control your mind trying to wrap your family up shake it off tonight oh there are two Spirits here that are representing two separate persons amen the spirit of fear represents the devil amen but the spirit of Faith represents the Lord Jesus Christ then may I tell you today that in this land we are living in in this in this church that we're living in in this age that we are now living in there are two households in the land today Amen in every household it has to have a head one of the households is the household of fear and may I tell you who the head of that household is it is the devil amen but can I also tell you that there is another household here today it is not the household of fear it is not the household of scare it is not the household of anxiety it it's not I'm preaching to you now it is not the household of depression it is not the household of suicidal Spirits it is not the household of Oppression it is the household of faith and the head of that house is the mighty conqueror who conquered fear he conquered death he conquered depression everything has been conquered what household are you a part of tonight well brother Andrew I'll tell you whose household I'm a part of I'm the part of the household of faith amen but you ain't even got enough Faith to raise your hands anymore and believe that God still heals the sick I'm a part of the household of faith but you ain't even got enough Faith No More Amen to let a preacher lay his hands on you amen because they said we can't touch each other I that devil in the name of Jesus Christ they can tell me amen that that prayer lines are not safe they can tell me that altar calls are not safe but I'll tell you who's anointing them to say that is the demon that want you to stay in the condition you're in but is there anybody here tonight amen that can raise your hands and say I will not let fear amen stop me from my blessing I will not let fear amen stop me from overcoming you say brother the end of year preaching lot slower you're exactly right cuz I'm going to drive this devil home and put him where he belongs in the Pence of hell we are not the Church of fear we are the Church of the household of the faith of God and our father is a good father our father is a protector he is the head of his household your father knows every need that you have you say amen amen the Bible prophesies that the time we're living in is going to be a fearful time right I didn't say that brother brandom didn't say that Jesus Christ himself said that in Luke 12 uh 21: 11 and great earthquakes amen shall be in diverse places and famines and pestilence right amen and fearful sights and Great Signs shall there be from Heaven what does that word fearful mean that word fearful means which strikes Terror amen it is a terror it is a cause of fright in Israel in the church part two one of the greatest curses on the church today is fear amen everybody is scared to death it's what's going to happen who what why why even Jesus himself said when you see these fearful sights lift up your head and rejoice for your Redemption is drawing nigh when these things happen that's not the time to look down that's not the time to throw up your hands and quit that's the time to look up amen for your Redemption is drawing n he said I've been talking about upon this sputnic tonight he said and I believe since last night there has been several more make a circle I believe if there ever was a day when men and women ought to open up their eyes and look in the word of God it's today this is the day because there may not be a tomorrow and today as we are here today we can almost feel the hot wind of judgment amen blowing in in our face the world has come to its end there's not a hope for the world Amen outside of the coming of the Lord Jesus that's the only hope you can put an eyes and how in every country in every County and America will still wait in sin Let me just stop here and say that America did not get in this condition overnight amen America did not come into this fearful condition amen overnight amen but she's been practicing this for years when she rejected a prophet's message she was practicing this for years but there is a people are you all hearing me tonight while there is a people amen who is gripped in fear while there is a people who is scared to move while there is a people that is watching all these fearful SS and they're becoming more nervous and they're becoming more shaken there is an invincible Army there is an invincible Army that is raised in up in the power of the faith of Jesus Christ oh you said brother Andrew we've got to look for something coming from the Lord Brother says I am not looking for any great Revival the thing of it is the Revival is come and gone and you didn't know it it's always been that you look for something and Satan kept saying there'll be greater over here there'll be greater over here and it's passed right by you did not John the Baptist come on Earth and even the righteous didn't even recognize him did not the disciples say when Elijah come he's already come and you didn't know it he says and the Revival is just about over are you hearing me amen but I love to read this quote he said don't look for nothing greater we've already got the greatest thing in heaven the holy spirit amen manifested himself in this generation there's nothing else can be done and I tell this way there is nothing else God is going to send Amen to give you more faith to overcome this pandemic there is nothing else coming from God Amen to give you more faith to overcome leosa before this pandemic got here you already had what it took to get through it are you hearing me tonight before it got here you already had the greatest thing what is the greatest thing the Holy Ghost manifested himself in this generation Hall yes sir you say brother Andrew what taking place in the world today I'll tell you it's actually called terrorism right yes sir amen well I'm going to preach for a second amen my Bible says there shall be fearful sights amen what are those fearful sights they are sights that strike Terror they are sights amen that cause people to become scared let me say it this way uh natural terrorism is an awful thing and I believe with all of my heart amen that God will judge and he will deal with every National terrorist he will deal with with every person behind 911 he will deal with every terrorist behind the the 1990s attacks I'm telling you National terrorism is a terrible thing amen but let me say tonight there is a much terrible thing than that it's called spiritual terrorism you say what is Terrorism terrorism this is the definition is the use of fear amen and the acts of violence in order to intimidate amen societies and governments against an ideology and common definitions of terrorism refer to Violent acts which are intended to create fear they may be done for religious a political ideological goal and uses of illegal violence amen then let me say tonight and let me uncover somebody tonight who does not want to be uncovered Amen Let Me expose someone in this building tonight that does not want to be exposed his name is Satan and he is a terrorist hey he is a terrorist he said brother Andrew Satan is not a terrorist oh yes he is amen the reason why you don't know he is is because he's disguised himself amen the reason why you don't know he's a terrorist is because the Bible says for I know that after my departing amen shall Grievious wolves amen enter in among you not sparing the flock amen then what is a terrorist amen a terrorist will try to fit in with a pattern or the in he will he will do stuff Amen to make you comfortable with him oh is this okay he will do things Amen to where you won't recognize him he will say things Amen to where you'll say well I guess that's just that brother's opinion amen he will do things amen that will stop you amen from rising up to defeat him are you with me amen I'm going to preach here tonight on the morning of 911 I was in New York City a few years ago I was was able to go in there and see amen that that 9/11 Memorial that that museum that where the where the towers come down what what a terrible thing that is amen what a what a heavy feeling is in that building amen but there's one thing that stood out in my mind is when you come down to the end of that tour they've got a computer screen there and you can see all those guys amen all those evil people my that was in the airport that morning amen that went got on them planes amen you know what's stood out to me brother Samuel is they didn't have t-shirts on that said we are a terrorist amen they didn't have they didn't have ball caps on that said I am a terrorist amen but they dress like everybody else amen they talk like everybody else they carry briefcases like everybody else but down deep they were a terrorist and I tell you tonight amen be aware Amen in the last days there's going to be some spiritual terrorist amen come from the pits of hell and they're going to invade pulpits they're going to invade churches they're going to tell you we're message Believers they're going to tell you we believe the same thing but you just give them the word test and you will find a zipper somewhere because they're not a Christian they're a terrorist Oh My Demons my acting Hallelujah as Christians a it's getting quieter but that's quite all right cuz I'll preach right through it amen the Bible says that no Marvel amen for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of Light amen that word transformed actually means to Fashion himself into so he'll come in and he'll sit down next to you and he'll say oh we believe the same thing oh my he'll call you on the phone and tell you we're going in the same Rapture amen he'll he'll meet you when you get down to pray and he'll tell you you're okay you know that little thing that you let come in your life you don't need to worry about that I mean when brother Brandon preached inas of the United States that was in the 50s so so those tapes are outdated today amen he'll tell you all kinds of things but let me expose him tonight he is a terrorist he is the arch deceiver amen he attempts to destroy the church amen by lying promises in Genesis 3:4 he lied to Eve Amen in Matthew chapter 4 he tries to deceive by changing the scriptures amen you just look at how that old spiritual terrorist attack Satan planned on a man named job how that when they come in the presence of God Amen the devil come also amen but my Bible says that job be to fear in job 3:25 for the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me and that which I was afraid of is come unto me in the book of Jo is this okay in the Book of Job it says here job feared and what he feared is actually what happened what he brought is fear amen his faith would have kept it from him but his fear brought it to him job had a fear that these things would come upon him and they did if you have a fear that your disease won't leave you it won't but if you have faith it will see then fear brings it to you fear is the vehicle that brings the disease to you amen but faith is the Chariot of God that takes it away are you hearing me tonight amen the problem of God said looking at Peter how amen when he got out there and his eyes be to look at the waves he got scared and what come in his mind the first thing I'm going to walk amen because the word said for me to walk and the next thing he looked at the symptoms he looked out there and seen how big them waves was and he got scared and when he did down he went what he feared happened what he believed happened when he believed he can walk he can walk when he believed see the substance would have right over top of with the White Cap went right onto him see if he has perfect Faith right now let me take this a step further if that's okay and say fear is of the devil right Amen brother bam says so don't fear amen fear is of the devil Everything Jesus would say fear not amen fear not constantly fear not is that right God don't want you to fear he wants you to believe you know our great adversary the devil if he can't catch us in way he will try another amen see because Satan does not want us to see the works of God Amen for the works of God was made manifest that the that that the works of the devil might be destroyed in the book of First Peter chapter 5 and verse 8 amen be sober be vigilant because your adversary amen the devil as a roaring lion is walking about seeking whom he may devour notice who resist amen steadfast in what the faith amen your adversary the devil is even now going about like a roaring line yes yes seeking whom he may devour watch un prayer and be steadfast this is the end time then I want to say it this way he uses fear to attack the Church of the Living God and what's he trying to do amen Shake Yourself I'm I'm I'm about done amen but he uses fear Amen to attack the church and then he tries to intimidate them amen right look at somebody next to you and say the devil's an Intimidator no the person next to you not me the

It Started With The Serpent and Eve when the serpent intimidated Eve amen then he come on down and Goliath tried to intimidate David then it come on down and King Nebuchadnezzar tried to intimidate Daniel and the three Hebrew children amen that come on down how that Satan and Pharaoh tried to intimidate Moses it come all the way over in the in the New Testament with Jesus how that the devil

brother brandom said it so I believe it see I'm a Believer whatever he said I'm just dumb enough to believe yes am right brother Andrew do you really believe God still comes in services and gives people Victory and lets them see who they are oh yes I do because I saw it with my own eyes two years ago down at Fred Mullins Mee and I was preaching and there was a man sitting about halfway back about where you're sitting there sister and while I was preaching brother brother Samuel something just come over me and I left my notes and I begin preaching on it's time to praise God it's time to start dancing and praising God before you every and see the manifestation of what you're want to see I said you know how you do that when you begin looking at the Unseen by a promise then the Unseen becomes visible before it ever comes into manifestation literal are you hearing me I said like this like David the Bible says David saw Goliath and oh god brother I got to quit but I'm I'm BL Lord David saw Goliath before he slung one stone out again brother said it so I believe it he said David begin [Applause] dancing he said David be dancing his way in the battle he said he danced all the way in the battle you know what he said dancing is a sign of [Applause] Victory dancing is a sign of Victory brother Brian do you realize David hadn't slung one stone but he already had Victory he hadn't cut the Li's head off yet but he already had Victory where was the victory brother brandom said it was already in his heart when Victory gets in your heart look out Goliath look out walls of Jericho look out Daniel's lines when Victory drops in the heart of a child of the household of faith that all things are possible picked up that slingshot and he began to sling it and he looked down there and he looked at Goliath and Goliath squared his shoulders back and he said he ye hear ye hear ye today oh today David you are standing against the biggest of them all David stood there and said good evening friends h here ye here ye he ye the bigger they are the harder they [Applause] fall and he begin to swing he begin to swing that slingshot and the P of God said God come down and got behind that slingshot and he guided that stone right to Goliath's forehead and down Goliath went and David said it ain't no ain't no strange thing for me to dance I've already been dancing I knew this was going to happen oh can I just preach here tonight can I just tell you quit waiting on it and start praising God for it well brother Andrew I'm praying for my children to come back to church just go ahead and start praising God for it well brother Andrew I'm praying for God to heal my feet just go ahead and do a dance on I'm not a crazy man I'm a part of the household of faith I refuse to fear fears of the devil but faith is of Jesus [Applause] Christ brother Samuel while I was preaching I got to preach about where David's wife come out and she looked down there and she said David you embarrass me oh my you embarrass me David oh but I thank God for a prophet cuz I wondered for a long time what David said until I heard a prophet of God say he didn't skip beat he just turned up there and looked and said if you don't like this watch that if you don't like that step watch this if you don't like that watch this amen and I think that's a good thing tonight to go ahead and tell the devil devil if you don't like my praise watch this if you don't like me running watch this if you don't like me shouting just watch this hallah I didn't know but I went right on over there and I said you know what I said there was a man one time who got in an addict and the whole time this brother's just sitting there looking at me I mean he's just sitting there he's looking at me in the meantime brother Samuel his wife's over there dancing carrying on the Pew but he's just sitting there looking at me but I was on a I was on I was on a rap trail and I wasn't going to stop till I got it I said you know what you may have a lot of condemnation on you but there was a man one time that got a hold of a geography book in the [Applause] attic and he begin to read about the sea and he be to read about how they hadn't found the bottom of the sea and that old sophisticated Church down there be to hear him stomp on the ground and the prophet God said his daughter ran up there and said Daddy what's wrong with you he said honey I don't have a Bible but I got a geography book and I was reading in the graphy book about how they've yet to find the bottom of the sea oh glory to God and I begin to think about how that my Bible said that Jesus thre my [Applause] sins in the sea of forgetfulness she said then what do you shouting about he said because that tells me that they can't find the bottom of the sea so my sins are still falling my sins are still fallen and when I said that brother it was like a like a lightning Bol hit him I said but while your sins are still falling there's a power here to rise to lift you up and to reveal to you you never done it in the first place brother Samuel when I said that he jumped up and took off running around the building kind of like y'all doing took off running around the building about two laps around well I got to be honest with you I got carried away with him and when I turned around he was gone I didn't see him I thought my God Enoch just left here he was gone brother and about that time I looked and there was about four deacons running out the door he ran out the door on the church parking lot and they ran out there to make sure he was so drunk he didn't run in the road but he was out there dancing in the message Church while I was preaching the message after service he came up to me he said brother I don't normally act like that he said but I've been praying for a long time God let me know that my sins are over let me know my iniquities are gone let me know I'm forgiven let me know my name is on the book he said and I heard the spirit of God speak to me in the voice of the spirit of God and say son you never done it he said I couldn't control myself no longer brother Andrew what are you saying I'm saying it's
