I'm going in the rapure oh I'm I'm going in the rapure to be with my Lord Hallelujah Jus hallelujah amen and [Music] amen hallelujah isn't it tremendous we have everything in the world to look forward to and the world in itself is just we we see the reality it's it is exactly how the prophet announced it when he was here this world is falling apart and I've often many times and you've probably heard me say this I've often marveled at how brother Brandon would take a text like that and I wondered what those people thought at that time because you see even though there's things that brother Bram could see in certain things is manifestation then but a prophet sees the seeds and a prophet sees if these seeds get swn what kind of crop it'll produce and so you know within this time that we're living in we're we're seeing what the prophet saw and we're seeing what not only the prophet that God gave us in this hour because it was a scriptural Prophet it was a promise that God fulfilled and it was exactly what God had said in his word the condition and how that it would be in this hour but I am thankful for reality in our lives that even in the darkest and the bleakest of hour that we're in we are filled with the joy of the Lord our future just like the angel of the Lord told the prophet when God healed him of that amoeba he saw that typewriter he saw it typed out there and he saw the the paper pulled out and thrown in the air and he said your future is clear I'm telling you that to me is an announcement that the lamb has brought to us in this hour amen our future is clear amen there's a clear way pathway back home and I'm going up yonder I am so thankful to the Lord amen you know as I mentioned to I was talking with someone last week and on the phone and I said you know sometimes I said you you you hear things I said where it's always like putting it far out and and we've got to reach out for this and this is coming and this is coming and the bride's Revival and I said I don't know what we're looking for but I am so happy with what God is doing right now I I'm I'm not that that's a the the the trick of the enemy is to reach and push something way out say looked what it was and failed to see what God is doing now but the work that God is doing now is just exactly like the prophet preached when the opening of the seals God hiding in Simplicity and revealing himself in the same I tell you God is so good isn't he you know amen and amen well we I won't won't keep you we could sing we keep on singing not that we can sing but we just sing but uh we just could talk to you we love you it's so good to be it's good to be back home and I got a chance to listen to the service when I was coming home late Monday night and man brother Steven did a wonderful job I I just I I called him the other day when I was here in the office and I told him I said I just just appreciate you brother Stephen and we so appreciate your ministry and just appreciate our brother just yielding to the Lord amen just being used of the lord we we certainly are blessed people and you know I'm glad God makes every one of us different and uh uh you might say well God broke he got rid of the mold when he did he got brother Steven I can say that I got some room to get back at him now yeah I sent him a text the other day I said I heard that [Laughter] part but uh oh but it's so good I would tell you I was rejoicing in the car and you know and uh I tell you you you you catch uh the Holy Spirit many things were said but I looked at my wife sitting in the car I said that's backtack Services where the Holy Spirit has taken a man of God and told a person you don't have to go in the world world to have a testimony backtack Services of two individuals that they they know one another but didn't know that one another's here and it just goes to show that you know you might look in your life and say I didn't go out and do this and do that or even as a young person whatever more but how much greater is the grace of God to keep you and you look to the Lord and trust the Lord all the way and it's God who has his hand upon you to bring you to every experience that he's predestinated and just to trust him amen that that's powerful that's a powerful testimony amen and I mean that with all my heart it's a powerful testimony I rejoice when you see that young people that have not gone out in the world and even through their Journey while coming to the Holy Ghost even I rejoice in that you know why there's a lot of scars they don't have a lot of scars they don't have and I look and say That's The Power of Jesus Christ to keep and hold on to a young person I'm thankful to the Lord for that amen and that's what we want to just with all of our hearts amen just to see that uh want to as we stand if we could thank you musicians and uh just want to say we had just a a wonderful time there with brother Barry coffee and the Saints we did on Saturday night did a a coup's banquet that they had there uh and um then on Sunday morning ministered and uh just had just a a wonderful time in the presence of the Lord so we certainly thank you for your prayers uh coming and going and so we want to begin here in verse 13 of job 23 and uh I I want to continue here with our thought here this evening uh also as you're turning I want to remind you of that the fellowship dinner and looking over the email with the details that are in it uh for this coming Sunday uh afternoon or right after service and uh I think some have asked things about you know what do we bring well it's it's a fellowship dinner it's not a maybe the confusion has been because May when we do that event in May that's kind of a planned menu but uh a fellowship dinner you just I think uh it's posted what did did you post that the other day about a main entree and a side dish a drink a dessert and if you have if you don't know what to bring just ask me I pretty much know everybody's specialty I if you need if you're not feeling LED I'll lead you but I just to me I just to be able for us to get together as a I may have certain things I like in foods but just to be able to get together and just to have Fellowship that's to me is what I love and so let's just look to the word of the Lord here in verse 13 and the Bible says job said but he is in one mind and who can turn him and what his soul desireth even that he doeth for he performeth the thing that is appointed for me and many such things are with him therefore am I troubled at his presence and when I consider I am afraid of him for God maketh my heart soft and the almighty troubleth me because I was not cut off before the darkness neither have he covered the darkness from my face let me just read this quote while I have you standing here out of the message I have heard but now I see brother Braham said job had something wrong with him but he couldn't get the inspiration on him and it was worrying him and when you get in that kind of a fix that's when the enemy moves into every friend nearly you got and we want to just ask the Lord to bless the word if we could just go to him in a word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord the songs of Zion have been sung Lord how thankful we are for your mercy Lord Lord we thank you Lord for the Assurance as Lord as song after song that we have heard and we have sung lord of the promise Lord that we are walking in and for any moment Lord that God to see our loved ones appear before us Lord and father the assurances you give to us and yet within every step that we made Lord like the special was sung tonight Lord I need you Lord You Are My all sufficiency Lord You're what we have need of Lord from moment to moment Lord we need you father Lord you are our strength you're are the light of our life and we just love you and we appreciate you Lord we always want with every moment Lord to invite you into every moment of our life oh God through every situation Lord we want you to be present Lord we want your leadership Lord we value Lord what you have to say Lord we just ask that you'll come Lord tonight once again and help us as speaker and hearer just Lord to move together as one yielded unit Lord that you might just speak Lord the things that we have need of and help us to hear it Lord as we should hear it father we pray may you heal the that are sick among us Lord in the visible and invisible audience Lord and we thank you for every wonderful report that we've received lord of the needs that we're praying for Lord and just seeing you moving Lord we want to say thank you Lord Jesus we just love you and we praise you now in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you as you're being seated I want to just continue to take that that thought here tonight and on on why why should I work and when that the question we understand as we were looking at that uh uh some some weeks here we've been a few weeks and looking at this and how that job uh was looking at the situation and he did not have any explanation as to what was taking place and when we find that sometimes if we allow we allow our mind to go then our mind itself we can start to deliberate and think on things and depending on how we're made up it can take you into a place that well we just need the rescue of the Holy Spirit to bring us back onto the right place and looking at things the right way and when we see that within worry I want to read this definition again and I just kept meditating on this throughout the the time since our last service and then even over the weekend here and just looking at this thought on what worry is it's giveway to anxiety or unease it's to allow one's mind to dwell on difficulty or troubles cause annoyance to and cause to feel anxiety or concern and I I want you to notice there's some Key Parts within here is that worry is a giving way to anxiety and to also look at allowing one's mind to dwell on difficulties or troubles and that in itself that that in that's said sometimes depending on our makeup and how things are that in itself can be a challenge but I want you to know that God knows just exactly how each one of us are made up and God already knew that and there's in in your life and my life it's challenging for us but it's not too much of a challenge for God and God is the one who equips us he could come down and there's certain things about you and I that he could completely just change like he did with a new birth but yet the new birth is about the soul the new birth is not about our spirit realm not about that of of the flesh which comprises within there as well but it's to give you and I the strength and the Dominion that we need to be able to rule and reign in our life and bring everything else in order in our life by the spirit of God dwelling within us that's why the Bible could say he that ruleth his spirit is greater greater than he that taketh the City because being able to rule it and to watch over it and so when you look at it worry begins with with a concern now there's things that maybe you have tonight on your heart and have and will you'll have a concern but you know a concern is not a worry but it's when it gives way to anxiety that's when it becomes worry because every one of us like I I referred to you the last time where brother brandham in the message the prodical he says any Godly parent has a Godly worry for their children talking about a concern everyone and brother Bam could say you know even in his own self he said I've got to a place that I've almost had he said two or three breakdowns because of worrying about the condition that I see the church in and seeing the world in he said but I I've had to realize and just get away and commit it all in God's hand that all I can do is my part delivering the word is there a concern yes but it's not something that could should should so bring us to a place of a mental breakdown and that's where we need the help of the Lord is that right within every part of our life and we know that sometimes within these things as it comes down to it in 2 Timothy 1 uh chap 1: 7 I want to come back to the scripture just to remind us for God ha not given us the spirit of fear so anytime there comes a place that's giving over to anxiety that never come from God that never it all begins simple discernment but it's toing remember that never come from God it it's not it's not it's not of God that would bring a fear like that of a torment God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind and this is why we we need the discernment of the Holy Spirit by the word of God because like the example we looked at here a few weeks ago when I was ministering on this that like our life itself being a glass filled with water and if I come with a whole handful of ice cubes and I dump it in that water and it's filled to the very top that ice cube is going to cause the water to be displaced and that's exactly what the love of God coming into our life it displaces fears it displaces all of these things because perfect love cast out all fear so it's it's more and the more of God the more of God's love the more of his life it displaces everything else of the world it doesn't have a room in our life and so when we consider it I want you to think how the prophet says it in fundamental foundation for Faith just listen to these statements he says Satan by the laws of sin and death makes everything that sin and death bought operate to Satan sins a cancer the man recognized it and received it Satan sends hard we recognize it and receive it now when he's talking about recognize it brother Brandon was not talking about when a doctor's report or something comes and says well you have uh you have this and we say well no I don't have it no it's like brother bam says and how can I overcome he says this is a direct quote brother Bram you know the doctor said uh they say I got cancer and he said but I say I don't brother Bram said no you do he said but you've got to recognize greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world you say brother Samuel well well isn't that like claiming the box of rattlesnakes not at all I am not going to submit my life to the cancer or submit my life to this this might be something that's in the outer realm but I'm a Believer and I have promises that God has given me as one of his children and I take that promise of a better report above the doctor's report that's where we we can see it but I'm not going to receive it I'm not going to receive it is that right now watch how he goes on it says this this is my I love this message the fundamental foundation for Faith he says if Satan by his power can make his laws work in man how much more ought god with his power make his laws work in man if Satan can make his laws be sure and US recognize it how much more ought God to his children to make his laws be recognized among his people of Divine Healing Revelation power gifts manifestations of the Spirit so Satan has has that of by the laws of sin and death where diseases can come sickness can come fears can come worries can come and we can recognize it and receive it and if that can be the case how Satan can bring it how much greater is it for us to recognize what God is sending and be able to receive that and as we'll receive that it displaces everything that's not of God praise God think about it you know when we look at that of recognizing and receiving I you know it's just simple that you know if somebody seemed a little fishy or a little funny you wouldn't let them in your house come on friends you know how it is sometimes when maybe you pull up to a gas station or or you pull up to I sometimes I've been out and traveling I pull up into a place and you know maybe this is a little Southern for you but when I feel like something's a little shady I'm not getting out I'm aware of my surroundings and it don't matter if you're in the city or you're in the country there's been stuff that's taking place right out here in one of the Cities that's not even right next door not even in Cleveland or any other bigger city you always got to watch your surroundings and know where you're at that's just common sense is that all right right now when I'm saying it in this manner that you would not allow certain things in your house or allow certain things you would quickly dismiss it and that's the same way that when things when Satan wants to bring things to us and that a concern he would like to take a concern that maybe you have on your heart that is a good concern but then he would like to take it and he move it to a place of worry where it robbed you of rest it robs you of sleep and you don't have to be you know a prophet to discern that when sometimes people are you know cranky and upset and you say you didn't get enough sleep either that or those or they'll say you're hangry right you know all of those things come along the way now you you can't sit like angels I I I know better than that but if it doesn't this is what I'm saying is that if things don't pass the test and and and it just is not right then you then we want to be able to say it's not coming according to the word this is not of God and I'm not going to receive it that's right sometimes we we we can be guilty of we ex feel things we experience things and and it's a spirit that wants to come around let me tell you a thought is not just a thought but a thought is a spirit a spirit is trying to give you a thought and if we will entertain it like why did that come to me you happen to be standing there right you happen to be right there and the enemy also knows what God has for you what's coming your way he wants to always try to bring trouble and disturb you of your rest in Christ that's his objective let me just make a side note here this is why when Nehemiah came back there to Israel he never changed the placements of the gates he repaired the gates when gave you the Holy Ghost he never did away with the Gate of imagination the Gate of reasoning but he simply brought them under the rightful control of a son and daughter of God and like Nehemiah could tell those who were coming in and selling fish and other things on the Sabbath day and they were coming in and then when they locked the gates they still stayed outside the gates with their fish carts and everything else and Nehemiah told him you can read this in the scripture he said if you don't get away from the walls I've closed the door but if you don't get away from these walls we're coming after you it's not just enough I've shut him out but there's a moment where we have authority I don't have to sit here and smell fish outside right I don't have to be bothered with that I can there there is there is a God there is an enforcement to make him leave let me tell you something you begin to Worship the Lord you begin to pray sometimes we do we we abandon the things as part of Victory right you begin to worship put on some instrument Oh Brother Sam I'm just so tore up well then does your way work does it work has it work for you but if you're all tore up I'll tell you what it's time to do maybe yeah you do maybe need to get by yourself but put on some instrumental music and just begin to say the Lord is my health the Lord is my strength the Lord is my shield come on now we go to battle there's battles all around us we do not always get to choose where the battle is happening but oh let us be ready when the battle comes to stand there and take the devil to task hallelu Hallelujah brother Samuel I can't sing you're not in the talent show anyhow watch this if Satan's body can be operated by unbelief and doubts and fears will produce what the scripture says it will it'll produce sickness it'll produce disaster it'll produce all those things then people by unbelieving produce that watch this shouldn't people believing with the power of God harness these things and bring them back to correction who's the people to harness these things I'm looking at them and bring them back to correction I'm not talking so much out there I'm talking about right here in our life to be able to harness the the power of God and bringing things back to correction in our own life hallu God is depending on you as a member of his body to bear fruit of his Spirit if he's depending on you let's open up our channels and let the Holy Spirit come in tonight and energize us and free us from all these fears and doubts Revival has come in Romans 8 ver1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit why your desires have been changed there's no longer a desire for the flesh for the world the love of the world is gone your desire is to please him amen for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death it's a powerful what a powerful reality the same freedom and liberty that that has come to your soul to separate you from doubt and unbelief in God's word and bring a living faith bring a real peace on the inside that same freedom and reality is what you go to battle with when the enemy wants to come against you with fear and worry I'm free I'm free and he who the son has made free set free made free is free indeed you are a new creation in Christ Jesus you've been ordained created unto good works you're ordained for that moment now notice it's just here just for simp simpleness of it out of Acts of the Holy Spirit brother Bram says they desire spiritual things they don't care about the fleshly things my flesh says I'm too tired my spirit says you're not I'm your boss follow me see a case out there and the doctor says you know that case can't get well that case is gone I look at her and I say that's right the case is gone but the Holy Ghost comes and gives a vision and said it's going to get well then I say thus sayith the Lord the man will live do you catch what he's saying the doctor is saying this case is is is is gone and brother BR says well the doctor's saying that because that's what they can see they can say well I I see what you're saying but when the Holy Spirit comes when the word is spoken the word is above every other word and so when the word is spoken we no longer walk by the flesh we walk by the spirit what God has said is true what are we doing recognizing and reing in God's word and it works to loosen us from fear and worry then I say thus sayith the Lord the man will live and we don't walk after the things of the flesh no more we walk after the things of the spirit 1959 questions and answers brother brm says with my mind he's referring to Romans 7 I have the mind of Christ I serve God with my mind but with my flesh he says how did he word it but with the flesh the law of sin what is it my flesh says tonight you're too tired your throat is too sore you've been out in the wind today you shall not go to church Lord have mercy don't really sound like that my flesh is my buddy I give it a nice haircut for all five hairs I got I feed it good I rested good put a good mattress I have a good chair to set in but it ain't against me I mean it ain't for me almost was against me there you've been out in the wind today you shall not go to church tonight that's the law of the flesh you just might as well tell brother Neville send the questions down and tell him on the inside the holy spirit said you keep your promise but the flesh said you're too tired what do we got a war it depends whether we're going to recognize it and receive it right that right I think what a what a victory that that that has sometimes we underestimate the victories of how just pressing over and Beyond the flesh to be in the house of God to press beyond the victory even when we we don't feel like praying and we press beyond that and say Lord Here I Am Lord you're worthy and you are my lover you're are my husband you're everything to me Lord you're worthy Lord I don't feel like it but you're worthy it's just it's little things like that little things putting that flesh in subjection time and time again your flesh will never be a cheerleader for you I'm telling you if there's one guy you don't want with you in a fight you don't want that flesh don't ever side up with him and take him in a fight he'll side with the devil as quicker than quick hallu watch it he says my flesh wants to yield to that and your flesh does too wow but the law of the spirit of God in the heart overcomes the Flesh and makes the body obey what the heart says do brother B said if it'll do it for a sinner then won't that work for sickness too the law of the spirit of God in the heart that knows by his stripes we were healed they stand with their power to make that sickness in that body obey them because it's a devil like our brother say it say woo that's got cream on it that deep oh I like that notice he said the law of sin and death works in your flesh but the law of the spirit of Life Works in your heart so your heart your spirit and your heart will make your body obey what it says do and that's what Paul said always the flesh says I'm too tired I'm unable I'm not sufficient I can not do it this is why it's it it takes it's more than a mind over matter it takes the Holy Spirit coming into your heart by way of a new birth to give you overcoming power it brings a discernment to your life that you're recognizing I'm not the same person I used to be I am a son I am a daughter of God and you can stand there with all authority of Heaven behind you remember brother Bram said that old little policeman he said he couldn't stop a runaway Pony but he said on that badge that badge itself it says that he is a deputy or policeman of a certain city and he's got all of that City behind him when listen when you have God in the midst of your life all Heaven is behind [Applause] you Hallelujah amen this is why in Romans 8:15 I love the scripture we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father now we don't start out with receiving the spirit of adoption is the Holy Ghost by the new birth but we're not fully matured Sons and Daughters of God the moment we're born right amen are you hearing me now that there that's why there is a growing it's growing and maturing all the way up to the Capstone it's a maturing to where it comes to the victory in love divine there's a maturing in our lives as Sons and Daughters of God now I can't preach and dwell on that tonight but I just want to say it in this way that we understand that with that with that understanding of the spirit of adoption that's what the Holy Ghost is we are placed as Sons and Daughters of God we're not going to be Sons and Daughters of God we are now is that right and we're growing we're maturing as the spirit of God working in our life we come to situations we come to things in our life just like test and just like trials no other way for our character to be molded in our life and any test we fail we have to come back and take it again because God said said my word Can't Fail any test that we fail have to come back and take it so it's it's a maturing in our life maturing and this is why that within our lives and our hearts this is in the message the prodal the prophet says that's what the church needs to do today is come to themselves to realize who is your father for sometimes we act as though we have no Heavenly Father for all the goodness of Heaven belongs to the church Divine Healing salvation freedom from worry or anything all belongs to the church Jesus died we inherit all that God has through him Heirs of the Kingdom we're rich so I believe that according to the word of God according to the message of the hour that we can live free from worry praise the Lord does it mean that we're never going to experience it that's not not what I said but it's recognizing who we are as Sons and Daughters of God you might say brother Samuel I am a newly born baby in Christ but you have authority in you that as there are things that God brings across your life and you recognize wait a minute I'm sensing a spirit I'm sensing something come in a way and it's not the spirit of Christ you have authority as you come to that to bring it in the presence of your Heavenly Father don't try to conquer it on your own bring that devil in the presence of the heavenly father be like Esther and says come here hymon we're going to get you in the presence of my king hallu glory be to God my my my my my my my thank you Lord think about this now in the message expectation let me just read a few places here brother Ram talking about a person then is having stomach trouble he said go away it won't bother anymore you believe that the next part of that he says then go and do as I tell you quit worrying you're a deep thinker you're always taking other people's troubles to yourself and Crossing Bridges before you get to it you're always planning something that never happens quit thinking like that be happy and rejoice now notice what he said he's went through quit worrying now he's getting into the problem you're a deep thinker you're always taking other people's troubles to yourself and Crossing Bridges well there's brother Samuel what's wrong with that I thought we're a body if one suffers we're all to suffer if one rejoices we all rejoices that is true but what's happening is taking other people's problems as though that person can solve them when there is a problem the greatest thing we can do is take it to the Lord in prayer and if somebody is in a state of worry it's not for us to get become so perplexed as trying to change that condition right there at that moment but let's go to God in prayer and say Lord you know where my brother's at you know where my sisters at and you know this is so real Lord that this is around them and they're dwelling on it but Lord May the angel of Mercy go right now Lord and free them Lord break that veil of worry like you did on that Easter morning Lord you broke that veil of worry he's dealing with the thinking quit worrying so he's telling this is there's a lot of instruction that's being given here you're a deep thinker now it isn't alog together that this person's going to stop as far as maybe being a deep thinker but they've got to recognize what they're thinking on are you hearing me they got to recognize what they're thinking on and quit thinking notice quit thinking like that be happy and rejoice he says it's a peptic ulcer you can't help it it makes your food sour and everything else in your stomach and it cramps you it won't it won't it won't it won't hurt you no more go on and eat and be happy and rejoice and serve Jesus Christ in the message the mighty conqueror this all right in the message the mighty conqueror I I just love these places all the way through the message here's a lady supposedly this is the first time we've ever met in life he said now uh he says don't be scared quit worrying it'll be all right now I want you to watch this it'll be all right now you're afraid something's going to come up and you know what I'm talking about lady I won't mention it here but you're scared but don't be afraid it'll be all right and that which is at stake don't worry it'll come out all right now brother bham let me go on to the second paragraph here he says the Lord God Of Heaven revealed to me what you're what you're what you're there for and what you're praying for will you accept it I see that you suffer with a lady's trouble it's a female disorder and he says I see you cuffed with a white sheep they've had an operation for the same trouble it just won't heal up and that's what you're here for and I see it around your arm right now thing and you've got low bre blood pressure and you're extremely nervous and he said you come from this city to this city to be prayed for you you've come to be prayed that you'd be brought into the prayer line in a room near a bed uh in a room near a bed that's thus sayith the Lord and I see you live leave the city Rockford Illinois go back and believe and you'll get well God be merciful now I want I want you to take your back Bri would you go to that first paragraph that I read there uh and I want you to catch this right here here she is she's she is worrying about something that is coming up there is a trouble that's going on she's had an operation and with that operation and and and and it just hadn't healed ight now I know right here sitting here tonight there's been different ones that's had operations and procedures and things don't always go as it was planned and I know that I know that from just just just these things and sometimes when things don't go as and the doctors can only give what they lay out we pray and we're praying and looking to the Lord and you know with everything within healing but sometimes when things don't go just exactly how it is never forget my wife and they put a stin in her for a kidney stone that was right after my father went home to be with the Lord a couple weeks and uh they you know she had some kidney stones in there and I always said if you know if we were had them for all the kidney Stones she had were diamonds we'd be very rich and uh they had kidney stones that they they could there's no way you weren't going to blast them or get them out or do anything else and so they had to go up in there you know and they put a stint in and sometimes with those stints some people do pretty good and sometimes they don't and she I never forget you know has he come into a place and man she had a reaction to that stin now she's already experienced a relief from those kidney stones coming out and being know and having that relief from you know the pain and things that she was in but then when things itself she was longer in the hospital recovering from that stint being put in than it was because she had a reaction not everybody does but she had a reaction it was she was longer in the hospital than she was on the other and sometimes when things don't go exactly how we thought they should go there can be a tendency to become very concerned is that right brother Samuel what does that mean you're human that's what it means it means means you're still walking in a human Temple that's what it means it don't mean that you've got weakness of faith it means you're still here in a body but you see we can't we can't stop even within those things and how that that may be coming but we can take it to the Lord in prayer we have a place that we can go as we said the last time and let off the pressure we have a place in him and this is what the prophet I want you to catch this last statement he said don't be scared don't you're scared but don't be afraid it'll be all right and that which is at stake don't worry it'll come out all right now what's he telling her he he didn't you know with what what has been said she she is in worry and the concern that you know is there within her body and that by the doctor and you know the nervousness and all the possibilities that it could be when is this going to be over and I've had the surgery I've had the operation I had all this but notice don't be worried at what what's at stake it's going to come out all right you see it's it's come a word and let me just tell you this right now you and I these quotes that I'm reading and some others I'll read tonight this is an example you might say brother brandom's not here but the same Angel of the Lord that directed The Prophet and showed that he cared it was God took a vessel a vessel of clay to show you that he's just as much God and he cares about your situation where the enemy thinks he's going to take you to a place of worry and fret and fear and anxiety there is still the angel of the Lord to come between you and those Egyptians that are trying to overtake you Hallelujah he's still the same almighty God the prophet's Ministry was to declare he is here to introduce us to Jesus Christ to unite us to the Living God in a real true Union with him and I can tell you though the prophet has left the scene he fulfilled exactly what God asked him to do and we are united with Christ himself we're not deficient I say it like this the prophecy is no longer prophecy it's being manifest Hallelujah you think the prophet him looking over I believe God lets him look over the banner of time the prophet told us how even a mama can look over the banner of time when her boys are being baptized to see them answers of prayer I wonder if the prophet looking over the banner of time and seeing no it's no longer prophecy this word is no longer laying on tapes and books it's no longer just contained within letter but it's become flesh there's a people who know their God hallelujah I don't know what kind of spell he has over there right now I don't know but I know what it does to me what I see in my own life and see it taking place in the lives of others I know what it does now let me read out of the Amplified at Philippians 4 let's look at a little bit of here of application and I just the reason I'm reading on Amplified so I don't have to Define every word as I just kind of pair it and look at that notice in verse six remember the Bible says be careful for nothing how many remember that that's the scripture that word be careful for nothing means don't be anxious about anything right that's one of the things even when I've I've talked with others and talked with our boys I said let me tell you if you begin to feel anxious about a decision stop stop because the spirit of God the spirit of truth will never bring anxiousness upon you never it won't work that way even when it comes to altar calls that's not how he works because that's fear that's torment the spirit of God draws you in love it bring conviction it lets you see where you're standing but it'll let you see that there is a God who is present to take care of your need and your situation is that right my how do we get there Philippians 4:6 do not fret I like that or have anxiety about anything but in every circumstance this is what's important in every circumstance and in everything by prayer and petition definite request with Thanksgiving you notice in the scripture when you read about prayer it'll talk about praying and it'll talk about supplication supplication it those words go right together you know before Isaac ever asked God about intreating Rebecca for a child he began just to worship him in prayer hallu see prayer starts with a worship right it's worshiping and as you come into His presence then you begin to make your petitions the request you have on your heart the things that you are experiencing now I'm just going to say this to you in this way way I I believe that there is an openness of us making our petition known to the Lord but let me just many of you probably already applied this but let me just tell you a little secret here that Satan if he knows that he's wearing you out and getting to you and you begin to talk to the Lord Lord I'm just being worn out and Satan is knocking me left and right then Satan knows he's getting to you but you know what you can go to him and just say Lord I love you and remember it's not the words out here that is hearing right here your heart and there's a channel between you and God that Satan can't put his dirty feet in he can't tap in wir tap he can't break it amen right the DIA like the CIA the devil investigating agency cannot break into that channel cannot wir tap Hallelujah no sir you see this is why this is why the prophet said in the seven seal he said if I have it in my heart Satan can't get it amen because he said when I let it out you know how it is if and yes there's times Brother s I'm feeling down well trip him up a little bit and you say Lord thank you for today Lord thank you for your mercies Lord that takes some overcoming I I said that takes some overcoming Amen Brother Sam that takes some overcome Amen Brother Sam that takes some overcoming sometimes we're walking around the devil said good Lord I thought her had her all worried and wearied and down and everything else and what in the world you walking around and saying thank you Jesus thank you Lord for your mercy today thank you Lord for your grace that's kept me in my right mind well the devil ain't going to stay around no praise and worship I'll tell you that much but you know you can make your petitions known to him from your heart he hears your heart you can be sitting right in class and talking to the Lord in your heart and God hears your heart sitting there taking a test say Lord give me Grace right now in this moment and the Holy Spirit is right there to guide you ain't that right absolutely it's a it's a connection between us and God when the prophet when his wife was all tore up in her house brother Brown never prayed out loud he just put the apron on and in his heart he prayed Lord quieten my wife Lord quieten this home Lord do this and just praying in his heart for her while talking about the dress down the street while talking about maybe going out for supper and talking about all of that he was praying in her heart to change the atmosphere you can just say Sorry Devil you're blocked from this conversation so I maybe that maybe some of youve already done that but I I'm just telling you sometimes when we start we let things out then the devil knows how to get up on us and start pouring it on us Oh Brother Sam I'm just TR you're telling me to act when I I feel down you're just telling me to be an actor Hey listen there there ain't nothing wrong with the joy in your soul sometimes we get weary in our spirit and in our mind but that don't have nothing to do with your soul you have a joy that the world didn't give and the world can't take it away you've got a joy that brings a real worship and your feet may not be gone you may not be running but you've got to worship because you know I'm free I'm free there is no holds on me and then every once in a while them feet will get to going depending on how you're made up sometimes you may have to get down an aisle that nobody goes in woo oh my continue to make your wants known to God and look at this in verse 7 and God's peace shall be yours that tranquil state of a soul assured of its salvation through Christ and so fearing nothing from God and being content with its Earthly lot of whatever sort that is that peace which transcends all understanding shall Garrison you know what a Garrison is ah I like putting you on the spot it's sharp guy Garrison it's a fortress when when you take your petitions and you put them to the Lord in prayer then as you've committed that to God In Prayer then there comes a Garrison Hallelujah around your life it there's a protection that when the enemy though you haven't received the answer and the enemy wants to Buffet you and come against you and try to take concern over into worry you've got a Garrison that holds you and Is Watching Over You Lord It's garrisoned with prayer notice Garrison and mount guard over your hearts and Minds in Christ Jesus praise the Lord I would read Philippians 4:8 let me just move on here for a moment think of this Christ himself is our way worry itself is the opposite of faith is that right worry said this is what worry is saying that I'm responsible for controlling the events in my life Bud I tell you brother Aron I don't want that man when you start looking at it that way worry says that I'm responsible for controlling the events of my life Lord have mercy we're doing good to take the roast out of the oven at the right time the those that are real and those that are conjured up in our mind worry I like this does not give a place for God in the equation that's what worry does it says it's trying it's all this is the bridge has been built and man we're it's like we're the ones that's in control of our destiny we're not the ones we didn't even find ourselves God came and found us we were alienated we were in enemies in our mind but he came to us and found us hallelujah if we would have been in control of our destiny think of it look at the mess that we made just in a little bit of time we had but now my life is not in my hands my life your life is in God's [Applause] hands and you know what with every situation I don't know about you I'm not a sharp guy when it comes to math and all those other things but I do know this when you put God in the equation amen look out look out because you know what God putting God in the equation will do it'll take out and isolate other variables it'll begin to isolate other things in there when you put God in the equation and realize I'm not the one who controls the future my life is in his hands is that right you know so it's it's us looking to the Lord cuz worry you know worry itself is like a place where you just all you do is look for trouble look for shard you know like shards of jagged edged dreams falling to the ground and but God don't see you like that God said I I I know the thoughts I got concerning you thoughts of peace to bring you to an expected end I know the plans that I have concerning your life and worry is not a part of it hallelujah oh my don't you love him I tell you man I love these things oh I love them I love them Bria go to that message the resurrection of Jesus 1956 notice what brother Brown says he says when you're discouraged that's when the devil can really pour it on you that's when he gets you if you come to search and say I don't know I don't know whether I ever get any better or not I've been prayed for twice you might as well go home that's all but when you can cast that side now I want to to stop here a minute if that has come to you here's the authority he didn't say go ahead and get back in your car but if you're going to let that attitude remain then you might as well go back home but when you can recognize as a son and daughter of God those thoughts are coming but I'm casting it aside what are you doing you're acting like your father he cast out Satan in the beginning God don't want you to be frowning God want you to be happy the human heart was made to be happy worry will cause cancer temper will cause cancer don't never be upset just walk in his love that last phrase is the key just walk in his love cuz you could say don't do this and don't do this and don't do that just get a bunch of ice cubes and put it in the glass of water let it be divine love coming down lord just more of your love let it displace those things then it didn't well I got to be nice or I can't hold a grudge and you know I can't be Pride ful and you know I got to be patient and I got to throw away all the records of everybody ever done me any wrong no just just say God I need more of your love I need more of your love it's not us trying to 50 steps to be a better lovely person we just need more of him when you feel yourself getting a little loose like the prophet said a little slack he said reach down and tighten up the Buckle knowing here's that is knowing that you're walking in him and nothing can harm you there's nothing can harm you neither Powers present things future nothing can separate us from him we're in him and we never come in by our own will he by choice elected us and brought us into him I love this statement so it's his business to take care of what he's took himself right hey God know what he was getting into when he got a hold of me he knew what he was getting into when he got a hold of you and it's his business to take care of what he's took for himself you believe thatall so Lord help me Lord if I could just just let this be so captured in my life it displaces worry oh my Branda go on down here to Psalms 139:14 let me just I'm going to I want to make a turn here and then we'll close into some things we'll look at in coming Services let me make a turn how many know God's he's a faithful parent there's things that no doubt that you and me alike that I would if if I would have known that I was going to go through it ahead of time maybe even when things come up I would be sitting there and say Lord I don't want to go through that I don't want to go through that I don't want to go through that but see God being a faithful parent he doesn't pamper us he doesn't say oh you don't want to go through that oh that's okay well let's let's just hold you back here you you don't want to go through that see God don't ask ask us that God don't ask us that as a faithful parent now if you can allow the Holy Spirit to apply it to our lives even as natural parents there's things that even how that being of a faithful parent but yet he makes us he guides us through the things that are uncomfortable in life he guides us through the hard things in life I mean you all know as parents there's things that your children have gone through yes and you were ready to take care of business in certain aspects right you're going to lay hands on them in a Christian way you know you know but you realize because what that part of a parent can rise up and then there's parts of said I don't want this or I don't want that but you see God he knows what's best for us he knows that there's elements of things that our character must needs be exposed to and molded and shaped because he knows what he has has for us down the line is that right he knows that and there's things like I said you would have and I would have just like if your kids or your parents hey hey I don't want I don't want this I don't want to do that I don't want to do this and you understand keep it all in context but God is faithful there to guide us through all the Affairs of this life CU he don't abandon us he don't abandon us he said he'd never leave us nor forsake us so God don't abandon us God won't just send us out and abandon us he's there to guide us now I want you to notice this scripture here in Psalms 139:14 I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and my soul knoweth right well God knows exactly how he has made every one of us up he knows all those characteristics even of all those things that have come all the way down through the fall now Bri if you don't mind skip down to 1951 at Thy word just skip over those other quotes and watch watch within this how a person can be made up brother brandham I didn't read the quote to you probably will next week brother Bram said one of the greatest studies I've ever done is on human behavior is being able to just just understand and you say brother Samuel that that don't sound exactly right well God said he knows his Sheep by name God knows every one of us by name that's why I remember when brother Billy Paul was standing there and he'd listen to his dad going through the questions and answers and he'd see a certain thing and see a certain way God knows everything one of us even in every one of us about even our makeup is that right now watch y'all look at me funny Brianna go back up to 1953 how the angel came to me I Don't Leave Nobody hanging I know you trust me but 1953 how the angel came to me it's been one of the most amazing things that I have noticed along the lines of Ministry for our lord Jesus is the peculiarity of people and and the study of human life is one of the greatest things that a person can study to watch the nature of people why there's differences even in the way we worship God don't want everybody worshiping the same even the way we worship everything the way we do it it's all based on the peculiarities my Lord I remember when I I stood there you know with the brothers and sisters in Africa and Ghana I mean man I mean there was a place from here to the pull pit out there to maybe where brother Shane and sister Lily this was the front of the church it was wide open and when we got done we got done you know with the preaching and man they were they were happy and they were out there dancing they were dancing what' you do got right out there and danced with them CU I was happy I was thankful even though I had been the one you know ministering what the Lord had brought to us but I mean here they were out dancing and all these everything I'll tell you they were happy it was peculiarities but God don't want us to go and say we have to do that here that's peculiarities now at Thy word oh I know some of y'all would have a problem with that that's why you stay on American soil 1951 at TH word everybody all right how do you do sister you're type of person that's once believing you believe kind of hard for you to see it you do a lot of worrying about things cross Bridges before you get to them build castles that never come to pass cuse that's your nature oh but if you believe me as God's Prophet The Diabetes will leave you you can go home and be well and he goes on and pronounces the healing now he talks in the message 1955 the True Vine and a false Vine he's talking about a brother is's having a stomach condition peptic ulcer and all these things at the bottom of your stomach in that second paragraph he says you're a person of deep thinking you're always Crossing bridges for you get to it planning things that never happen that's your nature in your stomach you're healed go get yourself a supper and eat it think a will because your faith has made you whole notice that's your nature over and over when the prophet would deal with certain situations the nature or the makeup of the person that's what was even the nervousness even some of these conditions is what would cause it was because of their makeup now did that mean that all of a sudden their nature or their makeup and all of that was going to be changed no but God would help them and deliver them from that condition they were in and they had to recognize every time that that Spirit would come I'm not going to let it rain in my life L's stand Brandon can you go down that last quote there 1955 the presence of the Lord Jesus I think that's the last one yeah well not the last one but the last one I want to do watch brother BM says you've been standing here all your life you've been nervous you're not a nervous person that shakes but you're a nervous person by thinking you're always pre-planning things going ahead planning things ahead and it usually never happens that way we call it Crossing Bridges before you get to them in doing that you formed a stomach trouble can't you see how Satan is so vile that he would take of even how a person you said Brother Sam but what's the value of a person getting things on their heart and and with even planning on it remember brother Bram took sister Bruce and sister Bruce would sometimes she could get in such a fix she was looking at I I I don't even know whether I got the holy ghost or not and brother Bram took it to her and he said now here's what it is Sister he says this is the way you're made up you're kind of a nervous person you get somebody on your mind you got to pray for them you can't rest until you go pray for them he said Satan will take that on the other side and he'll put something in your mind and you must solve it out and it starts down a pathway so it's God will use how he's made us remember brother brandham he he couldn't understand the rest of the rest of the brothers man they're shooting squirrels just anywhere and killing but he puts a gun down against the tree cuz he ain't hitting them through the eye and he puts it down and starts crying Lord why did you make me this way way and what was what was the response from the angel of the Lord I made you this way for a purpose so it's things that if we can look at it and say Lord I don't want to complain but help me to yield help me to yield my every channel to you he said Brother Sam how do I yield that just stay in fellowship with him you stay in fellowship with him you're ready like one of the Minute Men when this Revolutionary War took place you're always ready you're ready you're ready you're yielded when you're staying in step with him just just staying in prayer staying in the word staying in Fellowship walking in love thank you Lord for your mercy notice he says it's formed a stomach trouble it's an ulcer in your stomach it's nervousness now you quit being nervous watch this I love this there's no need of being nervous Jesus is with you I like that that's simple ain't it why should I quit being n nervous Jesus is with you that's why now go on your road rejoicing thanking God and praising him and you'll get completely well in the name of Jesus Christ what a place may God help us and give us Grace to be able to recognize when a concern comes and take it to the Lord in prayer instead of dwelling on troubles which can be our tendency depend on how you're made up depending on how how you're made up but if we can take the concerns that we have and take them to God in prayer and say Lord you know the need right now then that's where the peace of God can move to Garris in our life give us strength give us a peace to where then it doesn't turn into a worry everybody knows what that feels like when you a concern becomes a worry it's like you're you're standing there I mean I had it when I taught school you could sit there and all of a sudden you're you're in the middle of something and you don't even know what in the world you're saying you don't know what you're saying and you think and somebody else can be talking to you and you think wait minut what was that you just said and it it just stays with you throughout the day you you you find yourself in just a a moment and somebody else might be talking to you and you find yourself drift and here you are in a place of worry it is absolutely dominating moments in your life and I I want to tell you there's a place that you can go there's a place that you can go and you can take that to if you're in him you can take it to him if you're outside of him you can take your life to him and say Lord I am putting my life in your hands and when you've done that then other things things that come up things that arise you can rest to know he holds my tomorrow he is my brother Samuel is it really that simple try it and see well I've tried that no but if you really believe and say Lord I commit my life my all into your hands Lord I Lord am no longer going to try to figure out my own way make sense of everything else around me I cast my care on you for you care for me you believe that tonight no matter where you're at no matter the situation nobody is without hope no one here or in the invisible audience we have a place of Refuge in Jesus Christ let's go to him in prayer Heavenly Father Lord thank you for your mercies Lord thank you Lord that in the midst of moments and times all the way down Through the Ages Lord your children have faced and battled through fears worries things would Lord that would desire to come or Satan would try to take things that can be Lord natural or normal concerns Lord as we begin to deliberate on them and think about them and entertain this entertain that and pretty soon Lord it turns into anxiety that's what worry would begin to worry now Lord you you haven't come here tonight in any of these services to shame us that's that's not how you work you've come to let us know just how much you love

Lord to bring certainty in life and Lord to bring sense to what doesn't make sense you're here Lord to displace fears Lord in lives and hearts Lord that father know you in the power of your resurrection and yet Lord we can find Lord as we read certain examples here tonight even where sometimes Lord we can become where we're building bridges once again you don't shame us for that you
