has in store today just see his hand already in the service amen we know that we're here for a purpose amen God bless you Saints if you just want to go right to the word with me I think it's time amen I think the atmosphere is right we're going to turn to the book of First Corinthians the 13th chapter it being Thanksgiving time certainly want to wish you a wonderful holiday time with your family charity if you don't mind standing a little bit let's also take James chapter 1 and just verses 23 and 24 there now we just read an end time prophecy which is spoken to the general body of the church but I I like this scripture because James will take that that gen that General Church concept and he's not going to let you get away without receiving it on an individual level because James is speaking to an individual here he says you 've got to be a doer of the word uh uh verse 22 excuse me you'll be doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own cells for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he's like unto a man beholding his natural face again in a mirror amen before he beholdeth himself and he goes his way and right away he forgets what he looks like amen I love this example he he looks he beholds and he goes his way and forgets what he looked like amen that we don't want that to be us shall we have a word of prayer heavenly father that's our desire Lord that we could look into your word today and father that you would just be gracious to take control of this service these vessels Lord these gifts and Lord just anoint this word father that we could see a little more clearly I pray help somebody to come to a more perfect understanding under the perfect light of this perfect word father and Lord may it stick with us Lord let it be a revelation because otherwise we'll walk away father and forget what we look like but Lord show us clearly and let it change Lord our our pers our faith our confession and our perception of ourselves according to your word we just dedicate ourselves to you now in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you amen we love you you can be seated so bear with me a few moments and I'll just uh find the flow here but you know I love this example uh that James gives of and Paul of the mirror of the word because the word is a mirror amen you can look into this word and it it it will tell you the truth it it won't lie to you like some mirrors do you know it's not a trick mirror it's a it's a it's a true mirror you look into it you find out where you're wrong you look into it you find out where you're right it can show you all of these things but the purpose of a mirror is to show you yourself amen that's that's the real purpose that's the real power amen of of you know the device of the word is is that it it can show you yourself and now it's not uh and especially in this day like never before we're able to look into the word of God right it's a blessed time because we're able to to hear the word read the word fellowship with the open word for this day and uh and because there's been an evening light that has shown on this word there can be a full recognition it's not like when you walk into a room you know as we all have done and you walk in a room in a strange house and you've never been there and and all of a sudden you see a little motion you know you're in a dark room and you see a little emotion out of the corner of your eye and it it scares you you know it you jump you start you run over and you flip on the light and when the light comes you're like oh it's me amen and that's that's uh that's the experience that we're having with the word for our day is it is I it's it's revealing to us our identity who we are and and what we look like amen and and and and and that's what's so important and but but James is saying the danger of it is what the James rebuke here is that he's saying you know the danger of it is you can look into this word but then when you walk away you know there's there's a certain level of Christianity where when you when you walk away you forget what you look like you forget what it said you forget your position in that word and I think you understand what I'm saying and and uh and and and but I love that because James rebuke of of of the believer here it's not based on the position of the believer James isn't saying what that mirror is showing you of yourself is wrong he's not saying your position in that mirror is wrong there's nothing wrong with what the word is saying you are the problem is when we walk away we forget what it what we look like amen so it's a it's not the it's not the word that has a problem or your position in that word but it's your perception of it and the way that that affects your daily life amen and uh that's where that that phrase comes in that we're familiar with of living below our Privileges and brother Brown said you know he said that's just about where our churches are getting we're children of God but we're losing our inheritance by our conduct the things that we do and put an emphasis here and the things that we permit to be done and the way that we live and act and so forth he says we're living millions of miles below our privilege so I want you to notice that living below our privileges amen is not just you know sort of the way that we think about all the time of a of failing to see the supernatural failing to have Miracles failing you know not receiving healing not receiving deliverances and things of that but it's actually living a life here on Earth amen where your life is not matching up to what the word is saying you ought to be amen amen so it's it's more than experiences it's more than Supernatural uh let's say Rewards or blessings raining down it's a question of identity amen we're living below our privileges because we are falling short of a revelation of our identity in the word of God Amen are you with me now amen and he says now he even puts it on the he puts a a responsibility on the ministry he says we ministers we ought to be ashamed of ourselves when we keep our congregation way below our privileges amen below their privileges he said the whole Christian church today is living thousands of miles below their god-given privilege because they're half asleep he said they're they're dismalike amen and that's what it means to live below your privileges is to live a life where you're just you're just slumbering it just kind of half the Sleep there's no you know there's no intent focus on on the word of God you just sort of you're coasting along you you join a church and amen you're just sort of in a half asleep Slumber but that's it's not the day for that this is the hour of Awakening amen it's an hour when we're to wake up and and realize that the word has a message that is trying to tell us and it's concerning you amen it's concerning you as an individual and that's that's the beautiful thing about this message to me and uh no doubt you you heard me preach on it many many times that that it's got to be a personal revelation of this message it's a wake up to sleeping virgins you know I believe in the in the in the allegory there in the in the in the parable they were all sleeping but it was the wise ones woke up amen amen so maybe a time in your life you've been asleep but this is the hour of Awakening amen because the bridegroom cometh amen now now see uh uh uh uh our perception of it I I don't know if brother Wayne administered here any on on misunderstandings he'd been preaching on that quite a bit at home just a wonderful series on misunderstandings and I was thinking about that about our failure to perceive one another you know we just struggle with that you ever think about you know you have you ever been in a situation you know where you you'll say something or you'll make a little joke and it just landed wrong and you know and and and you re your walk away from there and you're like oh I just totally misrepresented who I am and now that person has a wrong perception of who I am and what I believe and how I think well if you've done that with somebody else you know that somebody else has done that with you and to think you know it's a amazing how much we struggle with to see the inner the inner workings of the heart because there is not another person sitting in this church and I just slipped this in here to deal with our little disagreements and our little petty issues you know between one another you know there's not another human being in this church that you have a perfect perception of who they are because somewhere along the line they said something or represented something or or maybe they thought something but now they've changed now they've grown and you're holding them to something that happened not a single person here we've got a perfect perception well how much less uh the word of God why our perception of the word we have little things you know little religious ideas little opinions and so many things in the way of just seeing clearly who we are but that's what the word is for that's why the message is preached is exactly for that purpose to reveal you to you the image of what God thinks about you in this day amen that's what the word is that's what the message is it's a light coming on the mirror of the word the message did not come to add anything to the word it didn't come to take any thing out of this Bible but what it came was to shed light so that we could see what was already laying in there amen with a perfect perception and that's the very critical thing that's got to transpire in your individual life is you've got to come to a personal revelation of this word by the message of the hour Amen brother Branham said and recognizing your day which is where I'm getting the bulk of this material this morning he said I want you to realize and recognize the time that we're living because we're just about to run out he said and by this you should know the very hour and time and sign and message that you are to receive amen many people know the hour you know I've had co-workers who have talked to me and they they know the world's coming to an end they know things are falling apart they're understanding the hour that they're living in but they don't know the time because they don't know that it's the coming of the Lord is right now at hand amen and how many people know the time but they missed the sign they they failed to understand that God sent a prophet and there's many people who know that God sent a prophet amen but they have not really seen the message amen but you've got to know the hour and the time and the sign and the message you've got to realize and recognize amen amen I always ask in this way in this question what is the message amen because that's a question from my personal life amen that I found that maybe 10 20 years growing up in a message Church having believing parents having a good pastor preaching the truth amen was not enough to keep me from a religious and ecclesiastical experience amen where one day a young man is just walking I think on the grounds of a youth camp amen and ask in my heart what is the message and our churches are full of people who call themselves message Believers but they could not put it in a paragraph amen and and that's that's just exactly where the battle is right now brother amen everything is trying to keep you from seeing who you are amen I I bookmarked that for a moment there's a powerful quote on that I hope I remember to bring it out so so I that's my question this morning is what is the message to you amen is it uh you you know what it is an ecclesiastical terms but but do you see yourself in it is there a reckon has there been a recognition in your life that's me that's me amen like brother bran told the story about Willie Pruitt the little boy on a ship and his captain was sick you know and near unto death and that little boy was the only Christian on the boat and he said Captain I want to read you the Bible you know and he he read there in in Isaiah by his stripes we are healed he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities but he said let me read it the way that my mother used to read it to me he said she always said to put your name in there so he read it again he said buy his stripes Willie Pruitt is healed amen he said now Captain you put your name in there the captain said okay he said buy his stripes John quartz is healed and the Lord healed the man because that's what makes the difference is is not just to know that it's laying in a Bible not just to know that there's a promise but there's something in your heart you can put your name in there friends amen can you put your name in this message amen amen because that's what it'll take not belonging to a message church or having the right Pastor or listening to the right Tate said amen said it's not putting your name on a book he said but know that your name is in heaven know that it's written on the Lamb's Book of Life amen and you can put your name there friends I don't know where you're sitting this morning but I know that I am in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen that is my position that is what this message has revealed to me I'm not just the son of Brian and Lucille Erickson I'm not just a member of True Word Tabernacle amen but I am an eternal seed of God my name is written on that book and I am right now in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus I can put my name there because of the message brother Bram said the bride is ready you say brother Nathan amen but I'm not ready I don't feel ready but brother Braham says the bride is ready so you know what the word is right your perception is wrong amen he said the Rapture is at hand amen it's at hand you say well brother Nathan but this has to happen and that has to happen forget your perception I put my name in there amen I'm ready the Rapture is at hand and I'm ready to go because it's personally revealed to me that this message came to call me out amen he said can we realize that can we actually believe that or is it a story that's been told is it a myth to us is it something that sounds real is it something that just on the outside we can believe or is it something that's in us that's part of us that's more than life to us amen What attitude do we set in in this Tabernacle hey man now that's something we all have to question ourselves amen where where do I where am I placing myself where am I at and and what I would want to just I would just trust the Lord with what uh the Holy Spirit would do something for you this morning amen with this little sermon that from this day that you just make up your mind from this day any encounter I have with the word of God if it's in prayer if it's going to church if it's listening to a message if it's reading my Bible every time I come before the word of God I will come with this attitude amen that I put my name in there that I realize that it's speaking of me that I belong there in that scripture it's not an abstract it's not an intellectual conception but it's God trying to reveal to me amen things about myself Amen brother Brown see that's true identification brother Brandon preaching on identification amen more than just about any other topic you know identification identification many of those he preached God is identified in his characteristics the identified Masterpiece of God he preached identify patient identification amen why because that's what the message is all about is to bring you to an identification of who you are and what position you are in and something he says over and over and over again I love this phrase in those you you run the keywords you'll see it all through those messages he says Identify yourself now in your present condition in your present condition and because he's saying you know what you know everybody thinks well if I had to live back in Bible times I would have been one of them 12 disciples well the statistics aren't good amen amen well I would have I would have listened to Noah's message I would have followed Moses out of Egypt I would have done that I would have done that but he said now but you got to look at your present condition and that's what is identifying who you are amen Oh Glory so it's a challenge to us friends but just look on the positive side of that just for a moment today Amen brother Braham said what you are now you will be there he said if you're a doubter now you'll be a doubter over there he said death can't do nothing but change your Dwelling Place friends amen so you if you're in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus then what you are right now that's what you are on the other side that's what you are in the mind of God death can't change that and sin can't change that you are a seed of God in your present condition amen it gives us Faith to know hey I've seen this message I don't know I don't understand all the things many things are mysterious to me but one thing I know there's been a revelation there's been a quickening and I've caught something that to know that I belong to this message he didn't call me a chicken he called me an eagle he identified me and if and I'm an eagle now I'll be an eagle over there I might be flying here now but just wait a little while because I'm an eagle I'll fly higher Larry God is trying to show you who you are amen and it's not about see and that's what it's got to be as a personal revelation of yourself in this word is this message you is it your calling is it your truth is it your life or is it just your church come on man isn't just your church amen because one thing we know for sure amen is that it's not about just all the doctrine you know and how well-taught you are and then you can dress the part and all those kind of things amen all that is on the religious level amen you know to understand the Mysteries and things brother bran said you don't even need a revelation Amen to see water baptism but the question is have you been baptized amen you got you know there's a whole lot of people in this word that could take the Bible and show you run you down through all the scripture to show you water baptism without even a revelation but they never been wet friends amen and what difference is it if you can intellectually explain the Seven Seals in the third poll and the Seven Thunders and all those kind of things but you've never been baptized with the Holy Ghost amen amen well then what good does your church do you then no friends that's not what it is brother Bram said the seals are open I know people got a problem with that but I don't because he said the seals are open and it's revealed to us revealed to us was listening to the seventh seal on the way to church this morning brother Brown just on and on you know it just could not go to the public because there'd be so many imitators it would just drag it down in the dirt but it wasn't for the public but it's revealed to us oh it's open France we see what they left off he said now you that want to debate amen this recognize your day it's quite a great message you know because you come under some real strong criticism so it just he's really he just really pushing his things he says uh really just just a a given a a strong answer here he says you that want to debate and fuss about serpent seed and water baptism and so forth you're blinded and you don't know it amen the God of this world has blinded you to it and you don't know it amen you don't know it now that's what he's saying about his critics about the critics of his message but how much worse would it be to be so blind Amen to see see he's saying look you know he got all the gods God has supernaturally come down Vindicated this message and revealed these mystery truths to the church and all you want to do is debate it and fuss about it how much worse would it be brother sister to claim to be a believer of this message amen but all we want to do is debate about it all we want to do is fuss all we want to do is fight and argue and stew with one another amen instead of live it this message is to be lived not to be talked about not to go out in the parking lot and swap quotes and try to blow someone's mind and make somebody think that we're spiritual what a blindness amen amen that's the problem we add around the message we got too many guys trying to inject their own ideas push their own understanding and all we've had is private interpretations we've had Decades of private interpretations of this message and all it's produced is a bunch of churches split churches and broken fellowships and things like that but I'm looking for a personal revelation not a private interpretation but for the quickening power to come into the church and reveal the sons and daughters who they are and where they stand and what we're here to do friends God give us a personal revelation brother Brown said oh what is the new birth it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you personally to you that's how you know you had a new birth because it's revealed personally to you it's not the Creed of the church it's not with just what brother Samuel teaches no it's revealed personally to you amen now watch now now you say brilliant you're always preaching our religious spirits and things but but listen brother Branham put the contrast here it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you versus what not you joined a church not you shook a hand not you've done something different you said a Creed you promised to live by a code of rules amen but Christ the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you and then it's no matter what anybody says it's Christ in you that's the Revelation that the church was built upon the church is built on Revelation and not not not a group Revelation but a personal revelation as it was with Peter amen when Jesus came to his church and he said he said who do men say that I am who do you say that I am amen amen now and oh and oh they had a lot of theology to talk about well some say some say this brother he teaches it this way but that one he says that you know and they're saying Elijah and some are saying Moses and some are saying this or that amen and that's all they had was a bunch of head knowledge that's not what he was looking for amen but then Peter who was ignorant and he was unlearned and he wasn't intellectual but he had something silver and gold Addy none but he had something he said I know who you are you're the Christ you're the son of the Living God Amen and Jesus said blessed art thou Peter you never learned that in seminary you never learned that by intellectual conception amen but the father your father in Heaven has revealed that to you Hallelujah it took a personal revelation to know that he was dealing with Jesus Christ that's why many people I followed away from this message because it was never revealed to them that it's not the thoughts of a Kentucky hillbilly but it's the son of man revealing himself to his bride and that same revelation of who Christ was turned back around he said and you are Peter you think you're Simon you think you're ignorant online you think you're just a fisherman but you're Peter and that Revelation that's in you is a rock upon which I will build the Bride of Jesus Christ foreign Peter had a revelation that's him that's the Christ but the same Revelation caused him to understand that's me that's me you see what I'm saying a personal revelation brother brand said it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you Christ the mystery hammers it and hammers it he said God never dealt with a group he never worked through an organization he always comes to the individual he said it's an individual personal revelation and he said all hell is against revelation this that's what hell is against Satan's not angry that you go to church Satan's not angry that you dress holiness any more than he's mad at an Amish person amen buddies but what Satan fears as that brother Ram said the bride would get the revelation of who she is because if she ever gets that Revelation she will understand he's powerless oh Satan hates revelation but we love it the revelation of Jesus Christ personally you all Hells against that friends every Power on this Earth that's under the control of the devil is against that Revelation you realize that politics political powers are against you come into the revelation of who you are amen academic powers are against you finding out who you are amen cultural Hollywood is against you being coming to the revelation of who you are oh you might join us you might go to school amen you might cast a vote you might do those things but you don't belong to that system because the power of that system is trying to keep you from this present and this precious present-day truth this evening light and it's your light the message of the hour is to rise up wake up and shine cause your light has come and the glory of God is risen upon the Bride of Jesus Christ she is him she has his characteristics she's full of his attributes and she's here to fulfill his very Ministry for she's bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh and only the Holy Spirit can reveal it to you personally that that's me that's me the preacher's talking about it's me that is the purpose of the Holy Ghost Bible says the holy the spirit has come into US crying Abba Father so the purpose of the Holy Ghost was not to build a Pentecostal organization or not to give us you know initial experiences and one-time experiences but the Holy Ghost was put into amen the True Church the true seed now I know there's a tear out there but that's not who the rain is for but the rain was for the seed amen and it's come into you making you cry I have a father putting a reality a revelation in your heart you didn't come from down here you're a son or a daughter of God so there's no adoption in any form without the Holy Ghost don't put that in a bygone day amen we're not you know the Holy Ghost wasn't just for the Pentecostals and the Holy Ghost is doing things in this bride the Pentecostals knew nothing about right amen brother Brown said the new birth is Christ a revelation God has revealed to you this great mystery that's a new birth now what are you going to do when you get all that group together see what it is got to be an individual Revelation not we'd Fellowship around a bunch of churches and you know put a picture of brother Brandon on the wall and no but it's a bunch of individuals who have received personally a revelation of the word for their day oh but when we get together amen then he said the revelations perfectly in Harmony and God is expressing through his word by the same actions the same not an intellectual conception but acts of another book of Acts amen oh making the word manifest oh he said if the church only knew its position but I'm so glad he said it will one day it will then the Rapture will go amen not come it'll go you know brother Nathan I've heard these quotes a million times I think you know what we're going to do we're gonna preach until we get it until we recognize it friends you you want me to come here and you know uh say well brother they just bring a button I want to hear a bunch of stuff I've never heard before and just you know have you blow my mind and get real deep and spiritual and things that's not even what Ministry is that is not end time evangelism but end time evangelism is to take the word that was once delivered to the Saints and run it all the way to the rapture if you ever hear brother Nathan Erickson preach something that didn't come out of this word in this message it was a mistake and pray for grace for me amen amen because see see friends this word amen is is working right amongst us and people are now coming to the revelation of who they are and the oh the Rapture is upon us hallelujah amen just keep going until we recognize it it takes people some time some people takes Decades of blowing of going to church and hearing quotes and a religious life and one day they just hold on that appointed time it just quickens amen that's what religious Spirits are trying to keep you from watch now what brother bran said about these denominational spirits and see if it's not right here in the message of the hour he said fast pray fast pray that's all you hear why do they do that they want a Great Awakening right they want the church to wake up they know everything's in a terrible condition they know spiritually the church is an apostasy the younger the young Generations are falling away it's a horrible thing happening in the church and they're aware of that and they're believing brother Braham said there will be an Awakening and they're good people not a bunch of devils out here they're good people amen but what have they done they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride they have not wrecked now what a horrible state to be in to have your very heart crying out for an Awakening and not realize that the Awakening of the Bride has already transpired it has already occurred and it is occurring he said by being a Christian they feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done amen that's what making them feel that way they know something's supposed to happen but they're looking for it way off in the future to come now you be careful now this spirit is trying to come into the message it's not trying to stay out with the Baptist and the Pentecostals and no this is the Antichrist Spirit trying to Cloud your minds and cause you to miss this revelation of the Awakening of the Bride which bride you are amen see but he said he said they're looking for it way off in the future when it already happened right by you amen they have not recognized The Awakening now see it wasn't that they missed it there was a prophet many people recognize brother Branham as a prophet many people recognize a prophet it wasn't that they failed to know that there was a message because a Prophet by definition has a message that he brings but what did they miss the Awakening of the bride and how tragic it is that all around in message churches we have people amen who've never had a new birth amen it's not revealed personally to them and they and they're looking for something to come oh brother Nathan you know when that sweep comes when that short quick work comes when that bride of Revival comes I tell you don't look for it to come amen The Awakening of the Bride has already happened thus save the Lord the move is on for the bride don't miss it it's happening right now and the more that we wake up the more it's revealed the more real it is the more manifested it is don't miss this amen but they missed that he was a forerunner they missed that he was introducing something and they missed it friends it was not their religious it's not the religious status that makes a foolish virgin they're just as religious as the true but it's just a failure to wake up wake up this Prophet did not come to reform the churches you probably heard me use this phrase that the message is not a slightly better church with slightly better Doctrine what does that mean it doesn't mean brother Branham came so that we could see the doctrine of the godhead a little bit more clear and we could get a little bit better Church order and we could get the people to dress more scriptural and all those kind of things that's not what this message was wow we've had reformers come to the church Luther came and he reformed the church amen and Wesley came and he reformed the church but this Prophet was a restorer amen he was restoring our our understanding it was restoring us back literally turning us back to the hearts of the fathers literally reached Thorn us to an eating condition and what is in Eating Condition it's where an individual man walks and talks with his Redeemer there's no intercessor there's no prophets priests amen pastors there amen but it's a man walking with God that's why this message means everything to me amen I'm not looking to turn it into an organization I'm not content with a religious system I want to know him and fellowship with him and walk with my father glory be to God a restore and we are the restored bride of Jesus Christ but you can sit in a message church and be a reformed Pentecostal many are sitting a message churches and they're nothing but a Reformed Baptist they got the same Baptist Spirit they got the same natural uh nature about him and they just got slightly better Doctrine friends but it's got to be a personal revelation of Jesus Christ you got there has to be a new birth and then that old nature those old ideas that old church that old oh it's dead and you've got a new husband amen glory to God until this light illuminates the mirror amen you can't sit there and be a reformed you've got to be restored by this light you've got to look into this word and realize that it's talking about you otherwise you'll miss the Awakening of the Bride amen Brethren said you know they were like they were like uh back when they missed Jesus he said they were like the people today blinded by scientific proofs and Educational Systems and all these things and it's blinded them again and what blinded them the Simplicity of the message and the messenger oh I love this amen the Simplicity the very Simplicity of the message and the messenger has blinded them amen but see see so is it today he said God always makes it simple to get the people who will believe and trust him do you catch that I'll come back to it now he says I want you to believe and understand that God has spoken I want you to believe and understand that God has spoke this message did you catch that brother sister he said God always makes it simple and then he tells you why he makes it simple to get the people he makes it simple to get the people you see where God's heart is with this message God did not take these Divine mystery truths and put him up on top of a mountain somewhere with some Guru where you got to go through a a 12-step plan of Enlightenment to get to it amen or what what hope would some of us had to have if he hid it behind some intellectual achievement amen but he did it he brought this message down there is not a child there is not a there's not a feeble mind there is nobody amen with a desire to know this Revelation to whom God will withhold it he will not hold it back he wants you to see it he wants it to be revealed and our perceptions are wrong because of Decades of false teachers who did nothing but take these open truths and bury them under a bunch of intellectualism but that's not what the message came to produce but the message came to open the very pages of the Bible so you could look into that mirror and a flash of recognition strike your face and say that is me I'm hearing from my theophany I always was an eagle but I couldn't see it in the darkness of my religious experience but thank God for a new birth [Applause] thank God for the baptism of the Holy Ghost comes screaming into our hearts Abba Father this is me this is what I belong to this is where I came from this is where I'm going this is what I'm on this Earth to do he makes it simple to get to the people now I want you to believe it he said and understand God spoke it God spoke it we do not count time you're comfortable today can we take a little detour I'm just this just came to me today I was just just admit just meditating this on this on the way here you know because we're always talking about you know well you know it's a little code word we have around the message if somebody's just a little behind they're not really just listening to it and not really got a lot of Revelation about he said well that brother you know Wonderful brother he really just sees God's Center Prophet never saw the opening the word but and and that's true that's that's a reality there are many around this message that just they took God sent a prophet ran with it and ran with it ran with it but you know never really saw the richness of the seventh seal they never they never saw the bride's position the bride's all they missed the Awakening the bride and maybe it wasn't for their day maybe they played their purpose and I just thought today you know you know we preach that way but but thank God for God sent a prophet thank God for God sent a prophet because none of us would see that amen God sent a prophet brother sister and he said a prophet that was Vindicated and and his interpretation of this Bible is the final word for the Bride of Jesus Christ don't ever think that the Awakening of the Bride does away with the message of the hour but the message is her Awakening it is her identity it is her power it is her adoption it is her Authority and thank God for brothers who preach their whole life with nothing more than God sent a prophet because somebody preached God sent a prophet so I can preach the seven seal somebody preached God sent a prophet so I can preach the third poll somebody preached it [Applause] amen I just felt to say that I feel I feel to to just make sure we don't get the wrong emphasis here and think that we got out from under a prophet no amen it'll be the spirit and the prophet and the bride saying the same thing that's why I preached brother Brandon said but he makes it simple to get the people Brother Band said you've got to accept it in its fullness watch this in the power of its vindication and the revelation of what it is so if you've got a real revelation of what it is then you won't you won't reject the power of the vindication just like a lot of brothers oh you know the bride's got power she's got adoption her name uncheck's good as his you know she's she's got the ministry of reconciliation you know but then let her lay hands on the sick one time let the Holy Ghost fall in a meeting with oh that's that's Pentecostal that's I don't know about that I don't want to get emotional I don't want to get fanatical friends but there has to be a power of vindication there has to be a power of vindication and that's the fullness of it amen but but see you've got to accept it you've got to accept it because you have a part in this word you realize that you are the Bride of Jesus Christ and so you are the culmination of the Plan of Redemption all the wheels of History all the stories of the Bible amen were Shadows pointing to you not someone else this is it this is the Bride of Jesus Christ I believe that with all of my heart friends so every type every shadow of the Bible the Saints of old lived and died and had their life experiences for the purpose of describing you that's who you are yeah you made mistakes that's why they had to make mistakes you go through struggles that's why they had to go through struggles they got sick because sometimes you get sick old friends it was all amen for the for the purpose of bringing forth the Bride of Jesus Christ can you accept that today don't accept it for the church accept it for yourself I am the culmination of the work of redemption and I am here to manifest the attributes of God and take a rapture Hallelujah you're the answer to every type let me tell you who said hello brother Nathan's this big preacher or that big preacher and they're doing The Marvelous things let me tell some of you preacher fans Amen Let me just explain something to you you might say oh brother Nathan you know I you you've got a nice little Ministry but I really I really would rather that brother appreciate today or that one of preached today you know I just don't think I don't really even think you're called because you're not doing what that one's doing or that one's doing okay now let's say let's let's say you take away my Ministry take away my calling and if I was never called to preacher let's say brother Nathan is just a regular whatever that means member of the Bride of Jesus Christ just a regular bride member no position no real talent no gift no great ministry amen then if I'm a member of the Bride of Jesus Christ then I am the Reason God raised up Samuel Browning I am the Reason God raised up Ray Erickson I am the reason as a member of the Bride I am the Reason God raised up Wayne Lawson I'm the reason he raised up Tim Pruitt I'm the reason he raised up Ron Spencer I am the one that he raised these men up to get I am the reason he sent Elijah the prophet behold I send Nathan Erickson Elijah the prophet Who You Are you are the bride you are the object of his affection you are the purpose of redemption emphasis the very word Minister means a servant amen you say brother Nathan you've got a complex about these brothers no they're my heroes they're great men to me but they're here to serve the Bride of Jesus Christ and I'm here to serve the Bride of Jesus Christ because she is the Queen of Heaven she is the apple of God's eyes [Applause] that's who you are this word speaks of you the stories of the Bible speak of you Redemption speaks of you the plan of God focuses on you no matter who you are no matter where you came from you're in there a sister came up in a prayer line recently and she said Brothers you know I always wanted to be a Ruth and I ended up being a Rahab yeah she wanted to stay in church marry a good man you know and be stable and have a good testimony in all these things but one thing led to another she took her root through the world made mistakes made failures oh I wanted to be a Ruth but I was a Rahab but friends Ruth Rahab Tamar David amen every one of them are in there amen you might be a Ruth you might have come out of drugs you might have come off a bar stool you might have come out of every sexual immorality or maybe you came out of a church and your victory was over religious spirits but Ruth or Rahab whatever you are you are attached to this Scarlet thread you are a part of this story of redemption amen because somebody was a Rahab there had to be a Rahab and because somebody at her there was a roof there had to be a roof because God had all of them in mind amen so we took him out of every background every Walk of Life every life experience and he married them and he justified them by a marriage not by who they were not by where they came from not thank you by the way that they lived their life but by a marriage [Applause] by a name change friends oh you made mistakes they made mistakes amen Abraham was a type a perfect type of a believer amen and when God came and gave him the promise he fell on his faith and laughed face and laughed but then what do you find Written in Blood over on the pages of the book of Hebrews Abraham staggered not at the promise and you and I think with our intellectual our religious Minds we say stagger not he literally fell over but it's not Written in Blood what are you saying brother Nathan I'm saying a Believer is not somebody who never had a doubt a believer's not somebody who never made a mistake amen Thomas doubted but brother Brown stuck up for him he said don't call him doubting Thomas amen yeah it would have been better to have believed and not seen but that's how Thomas Was Made Up and the grace of God revealed himself to him anyway that ought to tell you something amen you Thomas amen you're you're thinking thoughts you ought not to think you've been reading websites you ought not to read you're struggling with things in your mind you ought to just believe amen but you've got those doubts and it's got you so tore up God I don't even want to think this way I don't even want to doubt this message God maybe I'm not even a believer but a believer's not someone who never had a doubt but all it takes is a personal revealing of Jesus Christ and you could and it turned Thomas around and he went out he was one of the greatest missionaries of the earliest church and his name is written on the foundation of that City and nobody can ever erase it do you hear me Thomas you're struggling with that doubt but you're a Believer you are a Believer and that's why you can't let go this message because that's what believers do they believe so you can still fulfill your calling you can still have a Ministry a Thomas can still be a preacher amen a believer's not someone who never had a doubt take David you know Nathan went to him and told him a story David was so religious so self-righteous God all indignant said somebody ought to kill that guy that rich man had all them sheep and he had a visitor come and he killed his neighbor's precious only little lamb what a terrible thing didn't realize oh that's me that's me didn't dawn run right away oh my many times we find out ourselves in that position where we're just going on so religious so self-righteous looking down on everyone else and then all of a sudden just God will just reveal something to you and you just feel like such a failure oh God that's me I I'm doing that that's me God what's wrong with me am I not a Believer do I not have the Holy Ghost but notice what brother Brown said and thank God for a message of Grace Luther Brown preached the message of Grace and he took that story and he said you notice that that rich man he did not kill that lamb for himself but it was a visitor it was for a visitor it was for a visitor and brother Bram said that visitor represented David's passions that's why David could commit a horrible act like murdering Uriah and taking Bathsheba and still be a man after God's Own Heart why because it wasn't accounted oh blessed is the man to whom God will not impute sin but he didn't lay it on David he put it on a visitor young man you question whether you got the Holy Ghost thinking those thoughts of lusts all the time you think that's you that's not you it's a visitor young lady dealing with suicide dealing with anxiety amen you saints that struggle with things and those thoughts come in don't build that a nest that is not who you are it's just a visitor blessed is the bride to whom God will not impute sin yeah we're gonna make some mistakes but I believe this bride is Justified and if she's Justified she must have done something in the first place but it's as if she never did it that's the problem we have so many times thoughts come to our mind and we're just willing to embrace it and say that's me that's me that's my identity I am depression I am sickness I am discouragement I am lust I am this I am that you're not it's a visitor just send that traveler on his way Hallelujah no you are a true worshiper you are a true worshiper amen that's not you you're the true you're the true bride of Jesus Christ the true worshiper God's provided a place of worship brother Graham said there's only one place you can worship God that's the place he provided not where you can climb to not the way you think about it not who you think you are or what you can do but God provides a place of worship and the place of worship that he provides brother bam said is where he put his name that's why we can worship god with Liberty that's why we can lift up holy hands now these hands might have done something to this morning that wasn't holy but when you lift them up their holy hands why because you're worshiping him under his name because he called you by his name and he has converted you from a from sin amen and put place you in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and considers you not a servant but a son you're identified with Christ when you see his righteousness you can say that's me when the Bible speaks of his Holiness you can say that's me because he became your sin that you might become his righteousness that's who you are that's the name that you're known by now you might come have a horrible past and there's a whole lot of horrible crimes and horrible sins that are attributed to the name you were born with but that is not your name [Music] he didn't put his name on your sacrifice he put it in Jesus Christ the way the truth of life and he called you by that name by the new birth of the Holy Ghost and he says now bring your sacrifice and I'll receive it because it's where I put mine you're him that's me somebody say that's me that's me he called you by his name old and all I want to do with my life is glorify that name I want to live a life that would glorify that name you know the the churches today modern churches they they're always going on about you know they have this saying and I think I brought it up here before but you know I was created to praise the Lord I was created to praise the Lord I certainly praise is part of it but you can correct me if I'm wrong I've never found it in the Bible in just those words of just praising him because the way that they mean it we know is come to church on Sunday and sing the group songs and raise your hands and take part in the tradition and that's and that's praise but God has Legions and Legions of angels to praise him and they can hold the key better amen they can sing it better they can they can harmonize better friends but so it's not just about you know saying God's good and and and worship you and how I love him and all those things but the Bible says I'll bring my seed from the East and West I will gather my children from the North and the South everyone called by my name I created him for my glory for my glory Not Just Praise but for my glory I formed him I made him to glorify the name you know that Jesus glorified the name of a father what does it mean to glorify the name of God we know that God was a mystery amen and there were things about God we did not understand so he sinned his only begotten son and all that was in God he poured into Christ and so that we could understand him so that we could see him so that we could have fellowship with him amen and everything that he did was glorifying the name of the father amen if there's anything you like about Nathan Erickson anything anything any of just Little attributes or things you're like I like that about brother Nathan well what is that doing that's glorifying it's testifying of a father a good father to raise the son and instilled him with certain attributes so the life of the son glorifies the father that's why Jesus cried out he said glorified father glorify thy name and the father answered from heaven with a thunder he said I have and I will I will glorify it again that's why you can't just make Jesus one-third of the Trinity no all that was in God he poured into Christ amen I'm going somewhere now brother Graham said you know he talked to that Jew he said and the man said you can't Chop God into three pieces and give him to a Jew he said oh no of course not but he said you listen Rabbi What relation would the Messiah be to God he said he will be God in other words everything that God is the Messiah is amen everything that was mysterious and God is revealed in the Christ now let me ask you something in the light of this evening message Amen in the in the looking in the mirror this revealed word what relation will the bride be to Christ [Music] come on now are you gonna take the Holy Ghost and make chop that into one third of the Trinity oh it wasn't God he poured it to Christ but all that wasn't Christ he has poured into the bride What relation they will be Christ be him bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh Spirit of his spirit [Applause] damn [Applause] who are we we're God and morphe gotta be on a mask God in flesh again Jesus isn't coming he's here it's the bride coming of Christ you have his attributes you have his ministry you have his character you have his reputation you have his righteousness oh friends hey amen amen it's right now don't put this revival in a future time don't wait for the supernatural to fall it's here it's veiled in The Bride of Jesus Christ that's why I don't listen to someone trying to teach adoption and take the supernatural out of the church it's the same Spirit of cessation of gifts the FF Bosworth withstood when he stood at the debate platform he said I only have one question do the seven compound names of Jehovah apply to Jesus Christ and a man couldn't say yes because if they did then he is a Healer and he couldn't say no because then if it's not he's not a savior but Jesus Christ was a Healer and he was a savior and he was a miracle worker and he was a comforter and it was our peace the bride is him amen then she will have every attribute have every characteristic she will have every gift she will perform every sign in the Great Commission she will do everything that he did she will live his life she will do his works she will lay hands on the sick and they will recover y because all that was in God poured into Christ and all that was in Christ he poured it into you amen now you don't have a fullness of godhead in your body but you're part of it that's what I'm trying to preach you today and get you to receive it and say I know there's big ministers I know there's pastors I know there's gifts I know there's singers but I'm part of this I'm part of this that's me now there may be somebody under the sound of my voice that for the first time in your religious life it has dawned upon you that this message you've been believing and this church and its lifestyle its traditions and beliefs that you've been associating with is not a personal revelation to you you just joined a church Homa and you say oh brother Nathan I've missed the whole thing but let me place you in the scripture so you can see right where you're at this morning you are the woman that got up one morning like any other morning she went down to the well she got up went to church that morning and went there and was going through the motions like any other day not realizing it was a special appointed time because there was a man there and when she got there she didn't realize whose presence she was in but he began to speak with her why because she was the one he was there for you he didn't go to the Sanhedrin he didn't go to the great religious leaders brother Brahm said they wouldn't have received him but she was in the condition even in that condition even that sinful life she was living she was the one in a condition to receive him that's why he came yes and could I say something real bold this morning that's why I came today because Jesus is standing in front of you Thomas with bleeding hands it's not the signs in the ministry of a man it's the voice of God speaking to you revealing Christ to you he has come to fellowship with you with that will and he takes his time a little bit just starts moving just starts getting her mind going starts talking about water he said give me a drink so you know she half-heartedly lift her hand like every other Sunday Kind of mumbled a song under her voice you know he said you know that water you've been drinking it's not really doing it for you that broken cistern that fix you've been running from church to church fixed to fix that little besetting sin that thing that's not satisfying amen oh my well he was about to give her a drink he was about to lead her to a water where she'd never thirst again he was about to give her a personal revelation and he said something so precious to her friends because you know right where your life is at you just like that woman any of us you know we brother bam said we backslide every day so we look at things in our life and we know it's not right and that woman knew that she wasn't right but she didn't know that he knew right until he came and personally to deal with her and he said you know you've been going from husband to husband Church to church fix to fix but the one you're with now that's not your husband now catch this personally now the one you're with now the one you're with now come on the one you're with now the one you're with now that's not your husband that's not who you are Oh my he came to reveal himself personally you because you didn't belong to those husbands you belong to him could we stand the one you're with now is not your husband you've got a new husband now you're bearing his name but if you've never had a new birth if you've never had Jesus Christ come personally into your life and make all this Christianity this message all this that we preach a reality to you he's here to fill you he's here to meet you I would invite you to come for prayer maybe you want to have faith in your seed but whatever it is don't go another day without walking in the personal revelation of Jesus Christ because that's the hour that we're living in is the Awakening of the Bride many will miss it but not you because God has come you know that he's dealing with your heart he's trying to tell you you're one of mine foreign
