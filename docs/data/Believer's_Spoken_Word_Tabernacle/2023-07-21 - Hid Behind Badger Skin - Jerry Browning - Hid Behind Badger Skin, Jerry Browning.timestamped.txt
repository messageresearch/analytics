[28:38] a half the height thereof
[28:40] Thou shalt overlay it with pure gold
[28:41] within and without shall they overlay it
[28:44] and shall make upon it a crown of gold
[28:46] round about
[28:48] Thou shalt cast four rings of gold for

[29:29] cherubims of gold of beaten work shalt
[29:32] thou make them in the two ends of The
[29:34] Mercy Seat amen may be seated
[29:40] what I would like to speak on tonight is
[29:44] hid behind Badger skins
[29:48] when Moses was instructed to build the
[29:54] Tabernacle in the wilderness he was
[29:57] instructed how to make the curtains of
[30:00] the outer court and the inner court and
[30:03] the holies of holies and and the
[30:06] curtains were made out of goat's hair
[30:08] and different things and and they were
[30:10] colors uh different colors you know the
[30:13] outer curtain was of pure white and then
[30:17] they had curtains of blue and of purple
[30:20] and and so on but but the curtain that
[30:23] was made to hide the ark which was in
[30:26] the holies of holies was made out of
[30:29] badger skin
[30:31] and
[30:34] Badger skin Badgers they're a
[30:37] cantankerous animal
[30:40] and they stink
[30:42] and they can't really get along with one
[30:44] another very good
[30:46] and so you wonder why would God choose
[30:50] this Critter to make the take his skin
[30:54] and make this curtain that hid this Ark
[30:57] which we had just read was a beautiful
[31:00] thing it was overlaid with gold within
[31:03] and without the staves that carried it
[31:06] were overlaid with gold the cherubims
[31:09] that were on top were overlaid with gold
[31:10] The Mercy Seat was overlaid with gold it
[31:13] was a a very beautiful thing and this
[31:16] beautiful thing was hid behind something
[31:19] ugly
[31:20] it was hid behind Badger skin and there
[31:23] was nothing when you look at Badger skin
[31:26] there was nothing of it to be desired
[31:29] there was nothing beautiful about it
[31:32] that was the same way with the Flesh of
[31:34] Jesus Christ
[31:35] the Bible says there was no beauty that
[31:38] we should desire him brother Madam said
[31:40] the flesh that he walked around in was
[31:43] Badger skin it was the same skin that
[31:46] you walk around in you know he was a man
[31:49] in his flesh and his his flesh grew old
[31:55] his flesh grew tired his flesh grew weak
[31:59] in his flesh he went through everything
[32:02] uh the and tested in every way the Bible
[32:05] said such as knowing to man so there's
[32:08] nothing that you go through that Jesus
[32:10] couldn't understand because he walked
[32:12] around in the same flesh the same Badger
[32:15] skin that you're walking around in and
[32:18] that's what the badger skin represented
[32:20] it was a representation of the flesh
[32:23] that eventually the word of God which
[32:27] which what the ark represented was God's
[32:30] word and this iconic Glory was hid
[32:32] behind those Badger skins
[32:35] amen and uh you know uh Israel
[32:41] looked and wondered when God began to
[32:44] turn to the Gentiles how could God have
[32:46] mercy on such a sinful foul People Like
[32:49] Us Gentiles but what they they what they
[32:53] failed to see was the one that was back
[32:56] there in The Mercy Seat given the mercy
[32:59] amen and but God has always hid himself
[33:03] behind the veil God hid himself behind
[33:06] the veil in the days of Moses the mo the
[33:09] veil that he was hidden behind was the
[33:11] skin of Moses Moses flesh Moses came and
[33:15] he says you and God told him said you be
[33:18] God and let Aaron be your prophet he
[33:22] said you you'll be God and Aaron will do
[33:25] the speaking and uh so you know it was
[33:29] God that came down and met Moses in that
[33:33] burning bush and then God it was God in
[33:37] Moses bailed In the Flesh and they said
[33:40] that it's wrote in the scripture that
[33:42] the the glory that shined around Moses
[33:45] was so great that he had to cover his
[33:47] face when he came before the people what
[33:51] was it it wasn't Moses it wasn't his
[33:53] flesh it was what was living on the
[33:56] inside of the man amen God has always
[34:00] hit himself behind in every age he hid
[34:03] himself through the prophets coming on
[34:05] down through the Old Testament and then
[34:07] as we said hid in the flesh of Jesus
[34:10] Christ amen and uh
[34:15] he and the reason that that people
[34:18] couldn't see you know when Jesus walked
[34:20] on the earth the reason the people
[34:22] couldn't see that it was God was because
[34:24] of his flesh they looked and they saw
[34:27] this this stoop-shouldered man they saw
[34:31] this man that that that that was like
[34:34] any other man and they failed to see
[34:37] that it was that he was God in a man
[34:41] it was hid God had hid himself and God
[34:45] still hides himself in flesh today
[34:48] amen the the the Sinners of the world
[34:52] they can't see God in you because they
[34:55] look at your flesh
[34:57] people that you've known before you were
[34:59] changed they look at what you did and
[35:01] how you lived and how you were before
[35:04] you got changed before Jesus came into
[35:07] your life but once Jesus came into your
[35:10] life then it quickened that seeking of
[35:13] God that was predestinated before the
[35:15] foundation of the world and there's
[35:18] something quick and if you had changed
[35:20] you but it changed you on the inside you
[35:23] still look like the same person on the
[35:26] outside nothing changed on the outside
[35:29] you still look like the same person you
[35:32] still walk the same way you may be still
[35:35] you know uh uh uh you you still look the
[35:40] same you got old and and you get tired
[35:43] and and you get feeble and you you get
[35:45] sick and they want well if you belong to
[35:48] God why are you getting sick why are you
[35:50] coming down with this disease it's
[35:52] because I'm living in this old pest
[35:54] house this Badger skin that's hiding
[35:57] what's going the inside
[36:01] deity veiled in human flesh
[36:04] amen all the glory of God was behind
[36:08] those Badger skin
[36:10] the Shekinah Glory of God you know the
[36:12] the manner we spoke of it on Sunday the
[36:15] manner that would come down Angel's
[36:17] bread and they would gather this man up
[36:19] and they could keep it uh and eat it for
[36:23] that day but they couldn't keep it over
[36:25] to the next day it would spoil but they
[36:28] took the Moses took and gathered manna
[36:31] that fell in the very first day and he
[36:34] took it behind and put it back there by
[36:36] the Ark of the company behind the badger
[36:39] skin and in the Shekinah Glory of God it
[36:42] never spoiled
[36:47] the same thing today
[36:49] the power of God the Holy Ghost that's
[36:52] come into your life and this economic
[36:54] glory is what is friends it's what's
[36:57] ripening the seed of God that's in you
[37:00] is the Shekinah Glory of God that dwells
[37:03] on the inside
[37:09] he's hid from the eyes of the wide is
[37:12] imprudent
[37:13] he's bailed himself in Earthen vessels
[37:16] as the Bible says
[37:18] amen
[37:20] in the I want to tell you somebody is
[37:24] bugging me to death
[37:28] foreign
[37:32] you know you
[37:35] the people look at you and they see
[37:38] maybe the way you dress and and they see
[37:41] what you know the sisters how they dress
[37:43] and how they have their hair and all
[37:45] this you know and they look at you you
[37:47] know and they say well we don't know
[37:49] what's matter with you that's because I
[37:51] can't see what's what happened on the
[37:52] inside of you they don't know you've
[37:55] been changed
[37:57] they're looking at the outside and they
[37:59] don't as we said before they don't see
[38:02] no change in that amen but now in in in
[38:07] when uh Solomon in the days of Solomon
[38:12] remember that he built the temple so in
[38:15] the days of David the the house of God
[38:18] was still behind bales of in a tent and
[38:22] David wanted to build a house for God he
[38:26] said I live in a nice house I want to
[38:28] build a house for God but God wouldn't
[38:30] let David do it but David laid down the
[38:34] plans of how he was to be built and the
[38:37] materials that were to be used and and
[38:40] how they were debated and and they got
[38:42] wood from certain places from Lebanon
[38:45] and and they they everything was was
[38:49] particular on how it was going to be
[38:51] done and then Solomon being the son of
[38:54] David and becoming King he was the one
[38:56] that actually built the temple but after
[38:59] they got this beautiful magnificent
[39:01] temple built guess what they did they
[39:04] not the old Badger skin from the from
[39:07] the Tabernacle in the wilderness and
[39:09] brought it into this beautiful Temple
[39:11] and it was still the old Badger skin
[39:13] that was hiding the Ark of the Covenant
[39:16] or the word Shekinah Glory of God
[39:20] they didn't change that why because it
[39:24] was a type and Shadow that was that that
[39:27] pointed on down through the age to when
[39:30] Jesus Christ God would come in flesh and
[39:34] it was not also pointing to that only
[39:36] but it was pointing at when God would be
[39:39] in the flesh of mankind and there was no
[39:42] Beauty in Jesus you know he cried like
[39:45] the man there's the deer cried at the
[39:48] tomb of of Lazarus just like a man but
[39:52] then he spoke and said Lazarus come
[39:54] forth and it was a God in the man that
[39:57] spoke and it was God's word that brought
[40:00] Lazarus forth from the dead again
[40:04] but they looked at him and you know he
[40:06] he allowed himself to be beaten
[40:10] and they shout the crown of thorns on
[40:13] his head
[40:14] and they spit on him and they tore out
[40:17] his beard and they blindfolded him and
[40:20] smote him and said prophesy and tell us
[40:22] who hit you they did all kinds of things
[40:25] to him and he just let him do it
[40:28] and he said will it vitamin God he
[40:31] wouldn't have just let him do it but it
[40:33] was God hid in that humble man
[40:39] that humble flesh God was hidden there
[40:46] and they didn't know it
[40:53] now
[40:54] Israel you know they were not allowed to
[40:58] go behind the veil remember the high
[41:00] priest was the only one allowed to go
[41:03] behind that veil of badger skin and go
[41:05] in there and he only went in there once
[41:08] once a year but he was the only one that
[41:12] was allowed to go in there and and
[41:14] remember you know if he went in there
[41:17] and had something wrong and they hadn't
[41:19] come under the blood of the sacrifice
[41:22] then he would die
[41:26] and they what they would do is they
[41:28] would tie a rope to his leg
[41:31] and there would be bells on the bottoms
[41:34] of His Garment and if they quit hearing
[41:37] them Bells they had to grab that rope
[41:39] and pull him out because that many was
[41:41] dead
[41:43] and they couldn't go behind to get him
[41:45] that's why they had the road
[41:50] but they couldn't go behind there they
[41:53] couldn't see it but by faith they knew
[41:56] God was back there
[42:01] now Satan is the accuser of the brother
[42:04] the Bible says he accuses you before God
[42:07] both day and night
[42:09] he also comes and accuses you to
[42:12] yourself
[42:13] he points out every fault you've got he
[42:16] points out every failure he points out
[42:18] every time you make a mistake everything
[42:21] you do wrong every sin that you commit
[42:24] Satan's right there at a point of finger
[42:28] and maybe sometimes you'll have somebody
[42:30] that that you know out there in the
[42:32] world to say and you know they're always
[42:34] there to say well I thought you were a
[42:36] Christian
[42:40] will get on there but they'll come
[42:42] around you and they'll try to push every
[42:43] button you got just to see how you're
[42:46] going to react and if you don't act the
[42:48] way that they think of Christianity said
[42:50] well I thought you were a Christian
[42:53] well how in the world they know what a
[42:55] Christian's supposed to act like they're
[42:56] not one
[42:57] [Applause]
[43:04] but see Satan accuses you and many times
[43:06] friends we get to feeling down on
[43:09] ourselves
[43:10] when we when we do something and then we
[43:13] realize I did wrong then we just feel so
[43:16] ashamed and we feel so terrible and we
[43:20] actually feel filthy
[43:23] and it gets into feeling we feel like we
[43:26] don't feel like a Christian anymore
[43:30] but by faith you know that it's still
[43:33] God living inside of you
[43:37] it isn't being it isn't because you're
[43:40] perfect in this flesh because you're
[43:42] never going to be perfect in this place
[43:48] when when you've got the Holy Ghost your
[43:50] flesh didn't get it
[43:52] right you got it on the inside in your
[43:54] soul
[43:56] but this flesh is still the same it
[43:59] remembers all the sin you ever done it
[44:01] remembers what things taste like it
[44:04] remembers what they felt like it
[44:06] remembers what they smelt like
[44:09] and Satan's constantly there to try to
[44:11] bring those things back to your
[44:13] remembrance
[44:14] you'd be driving down the road and see a
[44:17] big old billboard or something and the
[44:19] first thing you know you bring the click
[44:21] and goes back in time maybe about
[44:23] something in your life something you did
[44:25] or how you lived right and what it is is
[44:29] Satan trying to get you to dwell on them
[44:31] thoughts he's trying to get you to feel
[44:33] bad about yourself
[44:35] because that's his job he's the accuser
[44:38] of the brother
[44:42] friends I'm going to tell you tonight
[44:43] I'm not perfect I make mistakes I am a
[44:49] failure at times but I'll tell you God's
[44:51] living on the inside of me I might not
[44:54] be perfect on the outside but the inside
[44:56] is pure as perfect as can be
[45:00] and one of these days there's coming a
[45:02] day to when I'm going to receive a body
[45:05] change and what's on the insides of
[45:08] finally going to reflect onto the
[45:10] outside and I'm going to look like on
[45:13] the outside what I look like on the
[45:16] inside
[45:16] [Applause]
[45:18] and you will too
[45:23] don't get down on yourself
[45:26] you're just living in Badger skin
[45:29] Badgers I you know I read about him
[45:32] they're animals that a lot of times they
[45:34] live alone because they can't get along
[45:36] with one another
[45:40] brother Branham said the Bible said God
[45:43] had to give you a new spirit because the
[45:45] one you had you couldn't even get along
[45:47] with yourself
[45:50] [Music]
[45:54] Hallelujah
[45:57] and he filled you with the Holy Ghost
[46:02] Israel Knew by faith that he was back
[46:04] there it didn't matter what any of the
[46:06] Heather Nations said they knew he was
[46:08] back there by faith they couldn't go
[46:11] back there and look at him but they knew
[46:12] he was there
[46:14] and friends you know we we look and and
[46:17] there's there's you know the only thing
[46:19] you can look at to know that God's
[46:21] living on the inside of you is
[46:24] something's changed inside of you
[46:28] you don't have the same desires you used
[46:31] to have it's gone
[46:35] wiped out
[46:40] it wasn't nothing you could do yourself
[46:43] us if we try to change ourselves it'd be
[46:45] like somebody trying to pick themselves
[46:47] up with their own bootstraps
[46:49] you couldn't do it it took somebody else
[46:52] to come see man had sinned in the garden
[46:55] and when he sinned then it put him on
[46:58] the other side of the chasm on this side
[47:01] he was the son of God and in the sonship
[47:03] of God he was a little Creator he could
[47:07] speak and things would be but when he
[47:09] sinned it put him on the other side of
[47:11] the chasm and there was no way back
[47:18] but then God gave him a substitute
[47:22] and Abel spoke of it
[47:24] the blood of lamb
[47:26] and it was a substitute but the thing
[47:28] about it was all he could do was it was
[47:31] a covering for the sin it couldn't
[47:33] divorce the sin it couldn't annihilate
[47:36] the sin
[47:38] they they made sacrifices for the people
[47:42] in the in the Tabernacle in the
[47:44] wilderness they would make sacrifices
[47:45] for the people's sin the people would
[47:47] bring a sacrifice up there you know even
[47:50] in the time of Jesus they would bring in
[47:52] sacrifices up to the priests in the
[47:54] temple to make a sacrifice for their sin
[47:57] and he would make a sacrifice for it and
[48:00] then their sin would would we be covered
[48:05] but it didn't take it away
[48:11] it's still laid there
[48:13] they went out and would do the same
[48:15] thing over again
[48:17] bring back another sacrifice
[48:22] but God sent one remember in the Book of
[48:26] Revelations in Revelations chapter 5 it
[48:29] said they looked all through heaven and
[48:31] all through Earth we could find no man
[48:33] worthy to come and take the book out of
[48:35] the right hand of him that set upon the
[48:37] throne and John began to weep why
[48:39] because if nobody was worthy to take the
[48:42] book then every name that was in that
[48:44] book would be lost
[48:50] because man had sinned and the book had
[48:53] went back into the hands of God
[48:56] amen
[48:57] that somebody had to be worthy to come
[49:00] and take the book
[49:02] and John began to weep and then a voice
[49:05] spoke and said weep not John Behold The
[49:09] Lion of the tribe of Judah had prevailed
[49:12] and John turned and he looked but
[49:15] instead of seeing a line what he saw was
[49:17] a lamb as if it had been slain bloody
[49:21] all right
[49:24] it was Christ and the Bible says he came
[49:27] and he died once and for all were
[49:31] cleansed
[49:34] he didn't just die for past sins he
[49:38] didn't just die for present sins he died
[49:41] for all sins that ever would be
[49:45] [Applause]
[49:48] when you come to Jesus and you give
[49:50] Jesus your life and you're filled with
[49:52] the Holy Ghost friends look you know the
[49:56] Bible says I believe it's in the Book of
[49:59] John it says if any man say he has a sin
[50:03] he's a liar
[50:07] all have sinned and come short of the
[50:10] glory of God
[50:13] we're all Sinners saved by grace
[50:23] but one came
[50:25] and took our place
[50:28] he became us
[50:31] he came down left the rim parts of glory
[50:35] and came down and became man hid himself
[50:39] behind Badger skin flesh of human beings
[50:46] and became us
[50:48] so that we might become him by grace
[50:53] and he shed his blood
[50:55] and friends let me tell you something
[50:57] he said it for your sins
[51:03] you know when you as I was saying when
[51:05] you got saved and and and and you took
[51:08] some received salvation that didn't just
[51:11] divorce all the sins that that you ever
[51:14] had committed
[51:15] but it took care of every one that you
[51:18] ever were going to commit
[51:27] we all make mistakes
[51:30] and as long as we're in these bodies
[51:31] we're going to make mistakes
[51:35] when you got the Holy Ghost it didn't
[51:37] change the desires of your flesh
[51:39] it just changed the desires of your
[51:41] heart
[51:45] and and see the inside man has got to
[51:49] bring this outside flesh into subjection
[51:58] the outside flesh it still has a desire
[52:01] for sin
[52:07] but the reason the reason that you're
[52:10] able to live the way you live is because
[52:11] the inside man that sin has been
[52:14] annihilated
[52:19] God sent down an agent from heaven
[52:22] for the Bible said it's called bleach
[52:26] it was the blood of his own son
[52:29] and When sin is purged and plunged
[52:32] beneath the blood of Jesus Christ it's
[52:35] in the sea of God's forgetfulness God
[52:38] don't ever even know it
[52:41] God doesn't even see it
[52:44] it's remembered no more
[52:47] except by the devil
[52:51] but you know why the devil can't
[52:53] remember it
[52:54] because brother Branham said when it's
[52:56] plunged in the blood of Jesus Christ it
[52:59] it it's gone from you he says and God
[53:02] takes it and throws it back on the devil
[53:04] and it stays on him until the day of
[53:07] judgment when he's going to be cast into
[53:09] the fiery pit
[53:12] that's why he can remember it he's the
[53:14] one that's got it
[53:15] he's the one that caused it
[53:17] [Applause]
[53:31] you realize that the same Holy Ghost
[53:34] it was in Jesus Christ is in you
[53:39] it's not a different spirit
[53:41] it's the same spirit
[53:43] the Bible says if the same spirit that
[53:46] raised up Christ from the dead dwells in
[53:48] you it shall Quicken your mortal bodies
[53:52] it's the same spirit
[53:54] he died
[53:56] there he was on the cross a man crying
[54:00] out my God my God why is Thou forsaken
[54:03] me
[54:04] what had happened God had pulled back
[54:06] from him he had to die like a man
[54:12] and he died
[54:14] and took because he took on him the sins
[54:16] of the world he was sent to hell
[54:23] but his Spirit was sent back on the
[54:25] believer on the day of Pentecost
[54:28] the same Holy Ghost friends let me tell
[54:30] you something the same God that lived in
[54:33] Jesus is the same God that's living in
[54:37] you
[54:41] it's not a different spirit it's not a
[54:43] different God it's the same one
[54:45] [Music]
[54:48] what's inside of you is the power of God
[54:55] you've got power to overcome sin
[55:03] accuser the Brethren has been cast down
[55:05] the Bible says
[55:10] he doesn't have any more power over you
[55:14] don't listen to him you know the problem
[55:16] is people the Devil comes to talk to
[55:18] them and they they sit around and listen
[55:20] to him
[55:23] what does he do he comes and interjects
[55:26] a thought he can't read your mind
[55:28] but what he does he comes and interjects
[55:30] a thought into your mind because that's
[55:33] the Battleground that he chose
[55:35] and he puts a thought in there and then
[55:37] he stands back and watches to see what's
[55:39] your reaction to that thought's going to
[55:41] be
[55:42] many times you know what our reaction is
[55:47] before you know it
[55:49] we're gone way off on a tangent
[55:51] somewhere thinking on that thought
[55:55] remember what you did
[55:57] just the other day
[56:01] yeah
[56:03] yeah I remember it
[56:08] boy don't you feel awful yes I sure do
[56:13] friends you know something
[56:15] there are people out there that do those
[56:17] things that don't feel awful
[56:21] they don't feel awful about doing it
[56:24] they never feel no they never gel no
[56:27] conviction over it
[56:29] they don't feel any condemnation over it
[56:33] they just live that way thank God that
[56:36] we get to feeling bad about things we've
[56:38] done
[56:40] it shows Who You Are
[56:42] if you didn't feel bad about it friends
[56:44] something would be wrong with you
[56:50] but immediately when we realized we've
[56:53] done something wrong we want to say
[56:54] father forgive me
[56:56] Lord I'm so sorry
[56:59] God please cleanse me
[57:05] oh God deliver me from this
[57:10] I don't want it no more Lord
[57:15] set me free
[57:16] and that's what he came to do will set
[57:19] you free
[57:24] Hallelujah
[57:28] the Holy Ghost has come upon you it does
[57:31] the same things that it did in Jesus
[57:35] he said the works that I do shall you do
[57:37] also greater than these things and
[57:40] that's the King James version how it
[57:42] says it but what it means more of the
[57:43] same
[57:44] yeah you do
[57:48] Hallelujah
[57:50] praise God
[57:52] the witness of the Resurrection lives
[57:56] inside of you
[57:58] the witness that Jesus Christ did in
[58:01] fact rise raised from the dead the
[58:05] witness of it is because he lives in you
[58:10] people people don't see Jesus today
[58:15] oh they they see you know crosses and
[58:18] they see you know crucifixes and they
[58:21] see different things that man has made
[58:24] and they see their churches
[58:28] but that's not God
[58:31] that's not Jesus
[58:34] Christ Jesus never chose
[58:36] to be tabble-knackled in a building
[58:43] remember what he said to David what
[58:45] house will you build me
[58:49] because he doesn't dwell in a house
[58:53] he come to dwell in man
[58:57] he come to dwell in you
[59:00] Hallelujah
[59:07] if we can't have faith that we got the
[59:09] Holy Ghost how are we going to have
[59:10] faith to Rapture out of here
[59:14] it's by faith you know that God the Holy
[59:16] Ghost not because you're perfect
[59:21] and that's what a lot of people want
[59:23] they want they want something that all
[59:25] of a sudden makes them perfect
[59:26] they want something where there's no
[59:28] more fight no more battle
[59:31] brother Branham said before you got the
[59:34] Holy Ghost you were just floating along
[59:36] with the rest of the trash
[59:41] but when you got the Holy Ghost that's
[59:43] when the battle began
[59:45] that's when you got to battle this flesh
[59:47] that's when you got to battle Satan in
[59:49] your mind
[59:51] quit listening to him
[59:56] listen to God's word listen to what
[59:58] God's got to say about you
[1:00:01] there's coming an hour
[1:00:04] when the Church of God is going to rise
[1:00:06] in all of her beauty
[1:00:09] we're going to rise out of here in the
[1:00:11] Rapture one of these days
[1:00:13] you know Satan he always comes as he
[1:00:15] accused he's always trying to tell you
[1:00:16] you ain't going to make it
[1:00:20] look at what you've done you're not
[1:00:21] going to make it you're going to miss a
[1:00:22] rapture
[1:00:23] one of these days you're going to come
[1:00:25] come to church or you're going to try to
[1:00:27] get a hold of somebody on the phone and
[1:00:29] you're not going to be able to go to
[1:00:30] hold them because they're going to be on
[1:00:31] the Rapture and you're going to be left
[1:00:32] behind
[1:00:34] that's what he tells you that's what he
[1:00:36] tells me
[1:00:40] but I I got a secret for you
[1:00:45] the devil is a liar
[1:00:52] and you know something friends the devil
[1:00:54] don't even know who belongs to him the
[1:00:56] devil's got children
[1:00:58] but he don't know whose is his and whose
[1:01:00] belongs to God
[1:01:06] but I know that I belong to God don't
[1:01:09] you know it
[1:01:15] there's something happen to me
[1:01:17] that changed me from what I was
[1:01:20] changed everything I was changed every
[1:01:22] desire I had
[1:01:27] I can't explain it
[1:01:30] I can't explain the scientific facts of
[1:01:33] how it happened
[1:01:41] the song says it never comes and tries
[1:01:43] to tell you you're not saved
[1:01:46] but the song says
[1:01:48] but I was there when it happened
[1:01:52] so I guess I ought to know
[1:01:54] I was there when Jesus saved me
[1:01:57] Hallelujah I was there the moment that
[1:02:00] he forgave me
[1:02:01] and friends when he forgave me he didn't
[1:02:03] just forgive me and say okay now you're
[1:02:05] forgiven now so don't mess up
[1:02:08] because I can't forgive you no more
[1:02:11] no
[1:02:13] he says if any man sins we've got an
[1:02:17] advocate with the father
[1:02:20] someone to plead our case someone that
[1:02:24] took our place
[1:02:25] friends look that sins in the sea of
[1:02:28] God's forgetfulness
[1:02:31] amen you stand you know job
[1:02:36] they come and try to tell him he was a
[1:02:40] secret sinner that's why all these
[1:02:41] things was happening to him
[1:02:44] but what had happened was the devil had
[1:02:47] come up before God and God has said have
[1:02:50] you not considered my servant job
[1:02:52] there's none like him in all the Earth
[1:02:56] the devil said well he's rich
[1:03:00] he's got many possessions
[1:03:02] life is good you've blessed him you've
[1:03:05] got a hedge around him no wonder he
[1:03:07] serves you
[1:03:09] you take that hedge down and you let me
[1:03:11] touch his life for a minute
[1:03:13] you let me take everything he's got and
[1:03:16] I'll have him curse you to your face
[1:03:21] boy I tell you what
[1:03:23] I get to thinking about that and I say
[1:03:25] God please don't be bragging on me
[1:03:34] God was bragging on job the devil said
[1:03:37] I'll show you
[1:03:39] God said go ahead take everything he's
[1:03:41] got
[1:03:42] he sure did
[1:03:44] he took all of his cattle he took all of
[1:03:47] his his herd he took all of his flock he
[1:03:51] took all of his children
[1:03:54] he took every everything he had he was
[1:03:57] no longer a rich man
[1:03:59] he took his health
[1:04:01] God said you could do everything but you
[1:04:03] can't take his life
[1:04:07] and the devil did he took everything
[1:04:09] that job had
[1:04:12] but you know what
[1:04:14] job knew that he had made a sacrifice
[1:04:17] he knew that his sacrifice held true
[1:04:21] he knew that he wasn't a secret sinner
[1:04:24] he know that he had made a sacrifice for
[1:04:26] everything he had done
[1:04:31] and he knowed how he stood with God
[1:04:38] who was it to come and try to tell him
[1:04:40] he was a secret sinner
[1:04:43] there's a bunch of church people
[1:04:45] a bunch of people he went to church with
[1:04:51] you know
[1:04:52] there there's people that don't know how
[1:04:55] to live right but they know how to tell
[1:04:57] you how to live right it seems like
[1:05:01] in the 25 years I've been pastoring I've
[1:05:04] had people that don't got an ounce of a
[1:05:06] gift on their life to pastor but they
[1:05:08] know how to tell me to be a pastor
[1:05:11] they know how to tell me I should be
[1:05:13] what I should be doing
[1:05:15] well if you know so much about it why
[1:05:17] aren't you the one doing it
[1:05:20] I'll be the first one to tell you I
[1:05:22] don't know everything about it
[1:05:24] but I'm not the chief shepherd He is
[1:05:28] and he knows everything about it
[1:05:31] when people come to me for counsel I
[1:05:33] don't have all the answers there's many
[1:05:35] times I'm sitting there and they're
[1:05:37] they're going through and they're
[1:05:39] telling me something you know they're
[1:05:40] looking for an answer and I'm sitting
[1:05:42] there praying the whole time they're
[1:05:43] talking saying God I don't know what to
[1:05:45] tell them
[1:05:50] and when they get finished talking the
[1:05:53] Holy Spirit takes over and begins to
[1:05:55] talk through me and begins to tell them
[1:05:57] what they need
[1:05:59] and tell them and and bring to them the
[1:06:02] scripture the word of God that they need
[1:06:04] for that time
[1:06:08] I remember when I was first going to
[1:06:10] Pastor I asked brother brownie my dad I
[1:06:13] asked him I said look I've been with you
[1:06:15] many times when you've counseled people
[1:06:17] I said how do you always know what to
[1:06:20] say
[1:06:21] he said I don't
[1:06:24] he said but the thing about it is he
[1:06:26] said he he told me he said you know you
[1:06:28] remember when he said we had cattle and
[1:06:31] he said you know we didn't have running
[1:06:33] water in the barn you know I told you
[1:06:35] that I think on Sunday but in the
[1:06:37] summertime we had a hose
[1:06:39] and you know we you'd start stretching
[1:06:42] that hose out to the barn I forget how
[1:06:45] many yards the barn was from the house
[1:06:46] but it was quite a distance we had a
[1:06:49] couple of hoses put together
[1:06:51] and began stretching that hose out you
[1:06:54] know and that it you know today they
[1:06:56] make water hoses that say don't tangle
[1:06:59] boy I'm gonna tell you something when I
[1:07:01] was a young boy they Tangled yeah
[1:07:04] yeah they got kinks in them and
[1:07:06] everything else
[1:07:07] and my dad said you know when you'd get
[1:07:10] out there and no water came out of the
[1:07:11] hose what would you have to do I said I
[1:07:13] have to walk back and find the Kink and
[1:07:15] get the kink out of it he said that's
[1:07:17] the way it is between you and God
[1:07:19] he said there's a pipeline he said as
[1:07:22] long as you keep the Kinks out of it
[1:07:24] it'll keep flowing
[1:07:30] every molecule of sin
[1:07:33] that you commit goes back on the devil
[1:07:37] every molecule of it
[1:07:40] think about that
[1:07:44] faith is a substance
[1:07:46] so is sin
[1:07:48] but all the substance of sin goes back
[1:07:51] on the devil
[1:07:58] the chemical of the blood of Jesus
[1:08:00] Christ acts like it acts like a bleach
[1:08:02] you take a a drop of ink
[1:08:06] you know and you you put a drop of ink
[1:08:09] you know you put a drop of Ink on
[1:08:10] clothes and you can forget about getting
[1:08:12] it out
[1:08:13] it's there that stain's going to stay
[1:08:18] but you put a drop of ink into a bucket
[1:08:21] of bleach
[1:08:23] and what happens to it where does it go
[1:08:26] why can't you find it no more
[1:08:29] because the chemical compounds within
[1:08:32] that bleach totally annihilates that ink
[1:08:36] it don't matter how dark that ink is how
[1:08:38] black it is bleach annihilates it
[1:08:42] and that's the chemical makeup of the
[1:08:44] blood of Jesus Christ it totally
[1:08:46] annihilates your sin
[1:08:51] that's why you can say no matter what I
[1:08:54] don't care what you've done yesterday
[1:08:57] you still got the Holy Ghost in you
[1:08:59] today
[1:09:04] now I'm not talking about going out and
[1:09:06] willfully sinning
[1:09:07] I'm talking about the mistakes you make
[1:09:12] I'm talking about the times you know we
[1:09:14] talked on Sunday about complaining I'm
[1:09:17] talking about the times when something
[1:09:18] happened a situation happened before you
[1:09:20] know it you lost your cool
[1:09:26] and there's always somebody
[1:09:30] I thought
[1:09:32] you was a Christian it's always the
[1:09:34] devil
[1:09:37] sometimes he's in your thoughts
[1:09:38] sometimes he takes the form of Flesh
[1:09:47] but there's no more remembrance of sin
[1:09:51] against you
[1:09:53] When sin is confessed now if it ain't
[1:09:56] confessed it'll lay there
[1:10:00] but the moment you confess it it's gone
[1:10:10] somebody came up before brother Branham
[1:10:12] one time and you know they had and and
[1:10:14] and they said brother Brandon when you
[1:10:18] were Discerning and I would stand in
[1:10:20] front of you you didn't say nothing
[1:10:21] about what I had done
[1:10:23] president said I didn't see it
[1:10:25] they said well I did it but when I was
[1:10:28] in the prayer line before I got up here
[1:10:30] I confessed it and asked God to forgive
[1:10:32] me brother bam said that's why I didn't
[1:10:33] see it
[1:10:37] when you confess it it's gone
[1:10:44] the devil when he's exposed he loses his
[1:10:47] power over you
[1:10:54] the visible Union of the Bride
[1:10:57] brother Ram said you're standing there
[1:10:59] completely
[1:11:00] you never sinned at the first place
[1:11:03] God don't even know
[1:11:05] it's in the sea of forgetfulness you
[1:11:08] never did it you were accused of it by
[1:11:10] the accuser but really from the
[1:11:12] beginning you were predestinated to be a
[1:11:14] son and daughter of God and you're
[1:11:16] standing there washed your old book of
[1:11:18] sin of divorcements put away and it's
[1:11:21] dead absolutely out of existence even in
[1:11:24] the mind of God you're The Virtuous
[1:11:27] bride of Christ washed in the blood of
[1:11:29] Christ precious virtuous sinless Son of
[1:11:33] God standing with a pure unadulterated
[1:11:36] bride word that he's Washed by the Water
[1:11:39] of his own blood
[1:11:40] that became flesh
[1:11:43] manifested
[1:11:44] that he might take you which was
[1:11:47] predestinated into the bosom of the
[1:11:49] father from the beginning the same as he
[1:11:51] was
[1:11:54] Hallelujah
[1:11:58] it's this old Badger skin you live in
[1:12:02] that's why your mistakes
[1:12:05] that's why you fail from time to time
[1:12:08] that's why sometimes you seem to slip
[1:12:11] it's because you're still living in
[1:12:13] Badger skin
[1:12:16] but what brings you around
[1:12:19] and brings it to your mind and makes you
[1:12:22] confess it
[1:12:25] it's the god that's living on the inside
[1:12:27] of you
[1:12:28] that's proof that he's living there
[1:12:31] because when he you know friends look
[1:12:33] God never brings condemnation
[1:12:37] it's the devil who works through
[1:12:39] condemnation
[1:12:40] God brings conviction
[1:12:43] which is something that that tells you
[1:12:45] what you've done wrong and gives you a
[1:12:47] way out of it
[1:12:49] a way of Escape
[1:12:52] the Devil comes around and condemns you
[1:12:54] and damns you and gives and you got no
[1:12:57] way out no way back
[1:13:01] but Jesus Christ made a way back
[1:13:04] amen
[1:13:10] Grace
[1:13:15] you're Justified
[1:13:19] brother I said you know what Justified
[1:13:20] means it means just as if you've never
[1:13:23] done it in the first place

[1:22:55] give you
[1:22:59] [Music]
[1:22:59] this
[1:23:02] sweet dreams
[1:23:04] [Music]
[1:23:15] you know that song
[1:23:18] when you read that in the book of Isaiah
[1:23:21] that time that Israel won the 144 000 is
[1:23:25] going to come to their Jubilee
[1:23:28] they're going to come to their
[1:23:29] experience
[1:23:31] of the atonement and that scripture is
[1:23:34] written in Prophecy in Isaiah of when
[1:23:37] all the armies
[1:23:38] will surround Jerusalem
[1:23:41] that same scripture is a parallel to
[1:23:45] where you and I stand in Psalms 27
[1:23:48] though a host
[1:23:50] should surround me foreign
[1:23:53] yet in this one thing will I be
[1:23:55] confident David what's your confidence
[1:23:59] tell us where's your confidence
[1:24:02] David could say well are they in my
[1:24:04] flesh what's your confidence David this
[1:24:07] one thing have I desired
[1:24:11] and that is that I will dwell in the
[1:24:13] house of the Lord David wasn't just
[1:24:15] talking about a building it was prophecy
[1:24:18] of a people that would desire
[1:24:21] to stay right in Harmony in Fellowship
[1:24:24] in the presence of God that sure things
[1:24:27] could arise but there is something that
[1:24:30] rises within our hearts Brother Brad
[1:24:32] tells us in a revelation series he said
[1:24:34] your sins are taken daily Before the
[1:24:37] Throne it rises from within this one
[1:24:40] thing have I desired
[1:24:42] and so my victory your Victory is based
[1:24:46] on the desire that's in your heart God
[1:24:50] Made A Way the Lord Jesus himself God
[1:24:52] coming down making a way that that
[1:24:54] desire could express and live in Victory
[1:24:57] so to me this this scripture when I read
[1:25:00] it and I don't just look at it that it's
[1:25:02] something for Israel to come to I
[1:25:05] believe it's applicable of how the Lord
[1:25:08] was speaking to us tonight we we are
[1:25:10] encompassed around with infirmity the
[1:25:13] enemy always has accusations but this is
[1:25:15] our stay keep your mind stayed on me
