back lights just to follow up with last week uh as we're praying about the concrete project um just going to go over the uh just a brief financial report of January to to current with you um I just wanted to break it down into a very basic necessities so this first um these first numbers that you'll see are what the electric is the gas the insurance the internet water and our sewer which is uh a septic holding system so here's the the total numbers the bottom of each column is what each month is so January is 1,49 February 1,121 and again these are just the very Basic Essentials this is if no emergencies happen this is um I don't even uh include Pest Control the building security what it takes to put songs up this is a so average for the first half of the year years 1,127 this next slide is what's going to be supplementary so it's going to include dep Pest Control it's going to include building security each month the song license General expenses like office cleaning supplies the envelopes when you pay your ties and offerings gas for when they mow if mower breaks down the spring bottle of water and anything other miscellaneous I group that all together the gravel that we poured back back in January on both the entrance ramps the bw2 website the display computer back there that broke down so a new computer that was in February the AC that went out a couple Sundays ago that felt like Costa Rica in here uh couldn't ignore that and then some floor vents and gas water so this is this is supplementary so this is not including the first average that I showed you January 938 February was just an expensive month because of that computer uh march8 146 and so on um so you can see roughly in addition to that 1ish uh for just your basic is another 1,000 for just things that happen you know just like our house sometimes things just need a dress um so just including that again these are both average numbers so about what this church things happen things come up about $2,169 a month is what I came it came out to be so the expenses versus the offerings um as you can see in January the expenses were 2,000 a little over $2,000 the offering was three 49 we're in the positive February we're in the negative due to that computer um um was that an apple Brother s that was probably why it's so expensive I didn't I didn't approve that purchase [Music] so as you can see we're in deposit all except that computer purchase but uh anyway I'm glad we can laugh but uh it's a year to date our total expenses from January to June currently was $2,789 and our current offering was $1 4,986 So currently we have a in the positive of $2,997 and this amount as we kind of draw closer to that um that bid that we were looking to possibly accept for the the concrete these are just numbers so you kind of have an idea so I can uh send this out to you if you if you would like it but uh but that's all I have to morning so uh God bless you amen it's in there pretty good amen how many appreciates A brother going through the effort put it's nice to know amen so so we know what things pray about amen about the parking lot God will provide amen whatever God puts on your heart Amen to give him those special offerings and we're gonna be having those every week so just keep that in mind at the same time we take the normal offerings amen how many's looking forward to the word this morning praise the lord we have brother R cook with us this morning brother Sam um I'm going to call Brother Samuel up at this time we'll just sing one more song as he's coming let's just sing that song wasn't that love amen how many appreciates you look at what Jesus did for you it was it was all his great love for us in the town of bethle came down to visit man wasn't wasn't that he the pain and Lon as he wor the Rob of fles wasn't B wasn't [Music] that wasn't that how he left his home of I don't put yourself in here now just to save someone like me every day I'm still there's only one thing left to say wasn't that oh wasn't that as he stood in he never said a word at all wasn't that Hallelujah wasn't he heard the M crucified but he knew that he came wasn't love hallelujah amen wasn't we that how he left his [Music] home just to save someone like me every day I'm still amaz there's only one to [Music] [Applause] say as he laid there in the Tomb he did just what he came to do wasn't that love wasn't that love let's testify now but then he rose up from the grave so that we could live today wasn't that love hallelujah praise His holy name wasn't that love oh wasn't [Applause] that oh just say someone I be every day I'm still am there's only one thing left to say was B love oh what wasn't that love one more time oh wasn't that love how he left his home of down on calary oh yes just to save someone oh every day I'm still amaz there's only one thing left to say wasn't that love [Music] [Applause] oh amen amen thank you Lord Jesus Hallelujah that's nothing but the truth isn't it amen we're just going to go right into the ministry of the word and perhaps on Thursday I'll talk just a little bit just on the report of the meetings we'd come from but my what a what a wonderful time we had just such a such a unity and the spirit of the Lord just moving in such a wonderful way amen among the young people and I want to just say it's your prayers and uh you are part of that in in praying and to see the effects of that sometimes you may never know but on the other side amen we see the effects of that and it just um I wish you all could have been there I really do it was a it was a meeting it was just a wonderful wonderful time and so uh I'll try to also give you the um website because I know with my family they were asking about it and they do have they've put all the services they live streamed them as well as archived and there's just some that um well all the services were good but um I just uh we'll get that out for you but without any further Ado I don't want to take any more time um we have brother rap crook here with us and um so brother rap is from uh brother Paul of fontaine's assembly he ministers out of there uh brother rap has uh ministered even in his early early years uh and traveled with brother Lonnie Jenkins and uh I think right now you're getting ready to go to Norway right getting ready to go to Norway again and uh been many different places but the ministering of brother rap he's he's a real teacher and uh I want you just the Lord the Lord has teachers in the body you know uh we we have a full balance and a five full ministry and every gift is is always unique and God intended every gift to be uniqu it's just like when you look between yourself as a husband and wife there are differences and thank God there are it's the uniqueness that brings complimentary and God just has such a great bouquet of ministry and so we've just we've appreciated brother rap's Ministry and uh ministered there with him even in the youth retreat and I just want you to open your hearts to the word of the Lord this morning God knows our needs God knows just how to speak to our hearts this service even as God has appointed Seasons he has appointed moments and God knows just what he's doing just want to say welcome each and every one of you good to have our visitors here with us Amen brother Josh sister amariah brother Brian sister Gracie amen and each one that's here with us God bless you so good to have you could we just open our hearts and could we just uh sing to the Lord as we just invite brother rap and we all have needs and the greatest thing that we have need of is Lord I just need a word from you I need a I need a word from you Lord just one word from you Lord that's all will be needed amen and God knows just how to get that word sometimes God will take a minister and for our need God can Traverse maybe 45 minutes to get our hearts in a place to receive that one word I love that about the Lord don't you cuz that's true we we come to the house of God it's things that we know there's a preparation to be made to receive the word of the Lord but sometimes even in the best of our preparations we say Lord I need I need my spirit I need my heart I just need settled Lord and and God builds our faith and then he'll just dropped that one word to us and my that's that one word is all we have need of cuz he is the word he's the entirety of it it's him it's not it's not anything less it's him and it it unlocks so many things so we just want to invite the Holy Spirit he's here invite him just to come right down and speak to our hearts in a special way amen so brother rap uh is wasn't able to his wife and children but perhaps the next time able to be here and uh but we understand that and so amen could we just stand on our feet brother Brian you have something on your heart to singen bring brother R up with by his word how pre his word I'll never fail by his word by his word [Music] how his I over I [Music] will his word PR by his word Howen [Music] ever by his word how [Music] [Applause] over by his word [Music] over thank you very much God bless you all this morning it's it's wonderful to be with you and uh perhaps while we're standing we can just open our Bibles to the book of Acts chapter 2 I thank Brother Sam for the invitation to come out and uh and Minister here uh today it's been a joy to get to know him over the past uh few years at different youth camps it's been real uh real special and uh my wife and kids wanted to be able to make it as well but yeah we ended the the school year with a bit of a I'll be a little dramatic a bit of a death in the family a dog of 10 years passed away and I really tried to put off the purchase of another dog because these animals they just bind you down and you just uh all of a sudden you're ordering your life's priorities based upon the four legs and um yeah I uh it happened faster than I could uh could keep things uh rained in and we have a uh a puppy named Jack and um Jack's priority Jack's priority was high today so we uh they went to church with my my parents they'll be able to be home a little faster and that's just how it is I'm learning learning where I stand on the totem pole again sometimes but um anyhow are we good here all right let's I don't see how I'm getting Acts chapter 2 um verse 37 and I don't know if a techie can come here and help me get this in presenter mode I can't see it on my screen real well Acts chapter 2 and verse 37 now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise unto you and to your children and to all that are far off as many as the Lord Our God shall call all right let's let's just pray Heavenly Father we thank you for this time that we have together Lord here in our Sunday morning this is not the end of the weekend this is the start of a week Lord and father as we have all kinds of things coming up in the week Lord and who knows what uh what what new news we might have received at work or from loved ones during this past week what we what burdens we might be carrying to church today Lord I pray oh father that you would help us just to bring them to you so we can rest father we ask your blessing today in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated perhaps some of you went to the to the Youth Camp uh this week I I don't know but uh think we've got yeah some of us very very good it's always a wonderful thing to come back and be be encouraged with what the Lord has done for us and I know uh the end of a camp was always a tough a tough experience it still is because the post Camp Blues are are a real thing but if you think about it if you've been staying up till midnight or 1:00 five or six days in a row your body is going to say stop after a while and sometimes those those physical messages our bodies start sending to um we can start overs spiritualizing them sometimes and just saying man what's wrong with me no you're just tired just rest and that's all that's all right but uh we want to take a little bit of time today and talk about uh the the theme that the Christian Life the Christian faith is based entirely upon rest and that's just uh that's something that was just I seem like that's a continual um struggle in in in our in our life lives being able to to come to a place where we can rest in the Lord and I could remember years back when I was uh younger it was in a Ser with brother Lonnie and did I hear Brother Crest this morning open in prayer I thought I recognized brother Crest your voice you might remember uh this this slide but uh it was a it was a slide to this of this man making his way across this this fiery River and the first slide he was just kind of holding on barely making he's just you can see the the sweat just dripping off of his off of his off his forehead and know sweaty Palms are not a good thing to have when you're holding on to a chain above a field of lava and that is unfortunately the way many of us um experience the Christian Life we're just trying to hold on for dear life and we're just hoping our strength doesn't give out um that however is not what God has intended and then and then the next picture that came across was the same big uh big huge chain links but in this one the guy was sitting right on the chain link straddling it and he was just being carried over not upon his own strength but upon the strength of the chain and that is what God has for us and I can rest now once again very good very good thank you my dear brother he earns that you should double his salary yeah so we uh we just looked at their text um about the the Holy Ghost is is a gift of God unfortunately like we said this is the spiritual experience many of us unfortunately have God does not intend our spiritual walk to be a cliffhanger experience we'll talk about that today but that's how we often feel we just want to try to we do our best to be good enough to to to show God that we've we've prayed long enough we've fasted long enough we've done ever what whatever long enough so that we can finally be deserving of the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's that's unfortunate the mentality we've gotten God doesn't want us to have a cliffhanger experience he wants us to be able to enjoy the journey and this person here swinging above this great height can rest in the strength of the rigging all right he's resting in the ropes he's resting everything that that is set up and that is a picture of what God intends our walk with him to be not hanging on for dear life I hope I can hang on I hope I have a good day when the Rapture comes that's not the experience that God has intended for us we can rest in what he's done for us now like Brother Sam said I uh um I've got a bit of a a teaching background I'm a principal and teacher at a small Christian School in lmma I'm going to kind of do what I do in class I'm going to present our lesson in a nutshell and first off we want to get here the new birth is simple we try to complicate things the devil tries to complicate things but whenever we read of the Holy Ghost baptism in the book of Acts it is simple people believed God and God filled them with his Spirit period right we like to add all kinds of things to it but God didn't confusion is one of Satan's Chief tools he loves to soak confusion especially about this vital part of our relationship with God next every Christian's individual experience will vary God is not a cookie cutter kind of God who every single Christmas cookie looks the same you know he is a god of variety your experience will be different than my experience will be different from his or her experience God intended it that way furthermore we are going to get in God's way when we try to imitate somebody else's experience we do this so easily and with the best of intentions we're not trying to do something wrong we're we're thinking we're doing something good but we just want need to relax let God be God let him meet us on his own terms and the biggie the new birth doesn't depend on us we didn't even start to seek God first we can only seek him because he sought us first it doesn't depend upon us now um Peter talks about the gift of the Holy Spirit it it is a gift and I like what Jesus says in the Book of Luke he says if you then human beings if being evil you know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him so Jesus compares the giftgiving experience we have with mom or dad with Grandma or grandpa with the gift giving experience that we have with God moms and dads especially grandmas and grandpas love giving gifts to grandkids that just uh just they love doing this that's that's a wonderful thing and one thing that if it would if imagine Grandma Grandpa a giftgiving experience that goes like this you've uh you know exactly what uh what uh what what what a young child likes for their birthday and you give it to them they open it up and say oh wow thank you grandma grandpa I love it so much but this is a really expensive gift and they run back to their room and break their piggy bank open because they think I need to pay you back for the gift gift that just kind of ruins the gift of giving experience I won't accept this I need to pay you back for it because this is way too much I'm not deserving of this I I I need to give it back to you that ruins the whole experience you Grand Grandma and Grandpa you do not require your grandkids to work for their Christmas presents they're just your grandkids moms and dads it's the same way and with the holy spirit it's the same way God gives his Spirit to his children who have been born of him and we spoil the experience when we try to work our way into it to be good enough because it is the Father's good pleasure to give us the kingdom he wants to we think we have to work well enough be good enough that's not it at all in fact there's one example in the Bible where someone tried this they tried to where they um they tried to get enough money or whatever for the for for the gift of the Holy Spirit and that didn't go well in the book of Acts um Simon the Sorcerer I think this is in the Samaria he sees that Peter comes and Simon has had his his uh his church he's controlled the people through his teaching and everything and then he sees Peter coming he Peter just lays his hands on the Believers and they receive the Holy Spirit and then and then it's opened up up there Samar and Simon Says man if I could get that I could grow my church like nobody's business so he goes up to Peter afterwards says Peter this is great we can work together here can I get like a franchise where and I and I can and I can pay you I will pay you whatever offering you want I we'll work on commission here so that I can give people this Holy Spirit and Peter says thy money perish with the because you thought the gift of God may be purchased with money now I doubt that very many of us have gone with quite that carnal of a a proposal to the Lord but I could remember at when I was a teenager 15 16 years old I had a much more spiritual sounding proposal but I wanted to I thought if I could just pray long enough if I can just fast long enough it's almost like if I could do these things long as it's like twisting God's arm until he finds this Uncle Uncle Uncle fine you've prayed long I'll give you the Holy Ghost now I wasn't offering money I was offering my Works instead even though it sounded so good my intention was so good but I was still injecting myself into the process and finally if God had given the spirit in that way he says man how many hours did you pray I prayed really effective ual fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much look at that prayer then it would based upon my works and not God's grace so whenever we approach God even with the best sounding spiritual sounding Works God says your money perish with you he wants to get us on the complete he wants us to just open our hearts to receive of him not to trade with him and that's something that however it just kind of in since the book of Exodus chapter 19 where the children of Israel said give us something to do in that's kind of ingrained into human nature but our first lesson here today is the holy spirit is a gift the devil loves to confuse us how many of us have wrestled with questions about whether we're filled with the Holy Spirit whether we're saved we've all wrestled with those kinds of questions he loves to confuse us he loves to get us to doubt our experience and he wants to make our Christian experience that that that that Cliffhanger that I was showing us on the other hand God intends for us to have a walk with him a relationship with him that's full of peace and joy now in our study this morning I want to emphasize that the new birth is a supernatural experience hands down Supernatural experience let's keep it that way but if it's a supernatural experience that makes it impossible possible for us to Define what it is and its specifics if it were a natural experience I could explain and say this these are the steps you do it but if it's a supernatural experience it's above my ability to define and explain but we often want to focus on a particular experience I want to have I want to do this in a service I wish I could do if I did this I knew I would have it or if I would just get this Revelation if I got this revelation if you get this Revelation you've got it or if I could just have this level of perfection in my Christian Life I could just overcome these things and I know I'm good enough all those are completely offt Target even though they seem and sound like good things but those good things by pursuing those good things we might actually unintentionally start to seek something else than Christ that's right because as soon as the spirit starts moving into service oh yes it's going to happen now it's going to happen all of us sudden I'm not seeking Christ anymore I'm seeking what's going to happen next but if we could just make Christ Our Central aim that will hit the target every single time and the rest of those things can just fade in the background God can give as he wants when he wants as he wants however he wants or not as he wants he can give us something better but just keep Christ as our Central aim as our Central Target because our works will will always hinder the move of God in their lives if I thinking if I can get enough of X then I'll get the Holy Spirit that's a work there's something of me in that and I don't without realizing it I'm starting to seek God by works instead of faith and when we start to do that when we start to seek God by works instead of faith we start losing our peace when we rest in him ah then we gain our peace back because we can be confident in this very thing that he which began the work will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ he's the author he's the finisher did God start a work in you yes maybe you're disappointed in where you're at in that work that's okay but did God start the work in you yes he will finish it he will no matter where you might be in the journey if you're down here if he started the work he's going to finish it and we can rest in that the Christian Life brother brandom says is built solidly upon rest a Christian's not tossed about now how many of us have been tossed about yes just last week my wife pulled in the driveway and then she's right in front of the garage black smoke starts coming from the hood of our van and she jumps out runs inside her father my father-in-law was and his wife were we're we're we're visiting my in-laws and she's Dad Dad the van's going to blow up it's on fire she was kind of tossed about she text me the van is completely broken I'm starting to get text about my tossed about uh my first calls from mechanic for man sounds like you've got a blown gasket what's that cost couple thousand dollars I'm really tossed about I was strung out last week I really but then the Lord's Grace brought it to another mechanic and he tested everything test everything it was just $130 repair of a little y connection with hoses and then I start I felt really ashamed because God why was I so strung out so yes as Christians our flesh can go up and down and I got really strung out with the kids saw me being so stressed had to back off guys I'm sorry I responded that way let's pray together right now we're going to bring this need to the Lord so can you see the the combination of our Humanity that's just going to stay that way but we can of re it back in and show everybody where we really bring our needs to the Lord and God's faithfulness so yes a Christians not tossed about we've got an anchor he doesn't run from Two and run from place to place doesn't fuss and fume and worry about things a Christian rests it's all over it's all finished for the believer at Calvary I just love uh that's one of my favorite quotes and the entire message who that just brings it back it's resting upon Christ in his work amen so when brother brandom starts to talk about in the in the church age book about the baptisms of the Holy Spirit one of the things he's going to emphasize I I'll read a quote to you here that the he's emphasizes that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is part of being born again want emphasize here that God is Sovereign that means he gets to do things the way he wants to do things without getting the feedback from us he does each meets each individual as he chooses and in the church age book brother brandom attempts to make himself very clear on what the baptis of the Holy Ghost is and what it isn't and he points his back to the scriptures and focuses on the promises that after you believe God will baptize with his spirit because we believe on him like we read in Acts 238 we continue to follow him and at some point along the line God will fulfill his promise amen now one little Wrinkle in this I said at some point in time that sentence means absolutely nothing to God because God is outside of time second Peter says a thousand years is a day to God and the day is a thousand years to us those are very different things but God is outside of time so for God for for us for me I was 13 years old alter at Camp I had an experience with God and then time passes and I might have another experience with God or I might be going through a dry think man looking back to the experience I had with God years back that's a human way that we refer to it but that's not how God sees it because when God comes down and touches our life for him our experience with him begins and it never stops the devil wants wants to separate us from our experiences the experience of something that happened way back years ago at the altar that's the time of your experience the place of your experience it was limited to that place and we often will think that way cuz that's it's it's it's human but to God I am still in that moment I'm still I'm in that experience so for God I might be I might be repent I might be baptized the next week and I I might be filled with the Holy Spirit at some point a year or two later that's how I will refer to it but to God it is all the same experience we we we we tend to divide him up don't do that I've just met the Lord I'm going to continue walking with him I don't care about the rest really doesn't matter if he started the work he'll finish it I'm not going to stress the specifics I'm continuing to walk with God he's going to to handle it Satan does all that he can to get us to see our experience with God as something in the past that's no longer part of the present that's not correct because God will never leave us or forsake us so in the smon church age chapter um brother bandam says now before we leave this subject I want to make myself very clear on what the baptism with the Holy Ghost is according to the word it's not according to me and it's not according to you it has to be according to thus at the Lord or we are falsely LED amen now to begin with you'll notice in my meetings when I finished preaching an evangelis IC service or some teaching message I cast the net and invite a response from the people I ask them to come forward and receive the Holy Spirit how many of us have heard a similar invitation probably have what do we think at that moment that that means let's see what he says he says my Pentecostal friends upon hearing me say this believe I'm inviting people to come forward to be baptized with the Holy Ghost because they're already born again again so when I invite those who are spirits filled to come and deal with those who've answered the invitation you receive the spirit these dear ones surge forward and deal with the people in such a manner as to encourage them to yield to God and believe to speak in tongues this has caused a great deal of confusion and I want to tell you exactly what I mean I mean for The Sinner to come forward and be born again which is to to be baptized into the body of Christ by the Holy Ghost once you start that first step it's like once the woman conceives it's all the rest of it's all going to happen the whole package is there it's just a matter of time it just started so once you come that seed of God's quickened within you it's just a matter of time you're going to show it all it's all going to take place I mean for The Sinner to come forward and be born again which is to be baptized in the body of Christ by the Holy G ghost which is exactly what took place at Pentecost when the church was launched in other words to be born of the spirit is to be truly baptized with the Holy Ghost it is one and the same it's simple we like to separate it into different steps but it's all one in the same experience all one in the same experience now some of us um I might be just me but I'm guessing there are at least a couple of of us in here who tend to approach god with a bit of a checklist mentality that okay God you tell me what you want me to do I'll do it and then that means you're going to do this for me we might not be that blatant with it but it's kind of in our de in our mental DNA that's kind of the thought pattern and um one way I can just share that this H that I kind of see this the wrongness of this part happening is uh years back I was a probably 17 years old or so I can remember because of which car I drove after at that time but I was about 17 years old after work one evening um went over to a to a a friend's house they weren't living there yet but there was it was almost finished we had the some guys we got let's have let's have a prayer meeting in uh in John's basement so we got together and we just uh it was somebody just started praying it was a a sovereign M it was a sovereign time of prayer where one brother just started praying we're just praying along with him all of a sudden just he just started praying I mean it's like like the holy spirit's just making intercession through him and this this isn't him praying anymore this is God this is God's here with us and then he just kind of his prayer kind ended in all then it seemed like the spirit moved to another brother he just started praying and just it was just one and just goes on for over an hour no just it was just really really special time just amazing it's just time a moment with God they'll never for get we loved it and the next week we said hey guys let's have another prayer meeting so we did and I thought hey you know what it went really well last week when I asked Brother David to open in prayer so Brother David would you open in prayer again and the same brother prayed then I prayed somebody else prayed it was it it was like flat same people same desire was just flat and I realized later that I was almost approaching something as Supernatural as as as as intimate as a time of prayer with a checklist mentality and when I did that I like so cheapened the supernatural experience so cheapens it so when we approach god with a checklist mentality we can be doing with the best of intentions with the purest of Hearts but we're still the devil is leading us to put a little bit of ourselves into the process and that changes the dynamic completely completely so um for those of us with that that checklist mentality because if there's any checklist in the Bible anything like a checklist repent be baptized you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit that's as close as I can get to finding a pretty clear checklist well this quote just throws it all out for me the apostolic way God had no set rule what no set rule acts 238 seems like that to me but he says no set rule when the heart's hungry he'll give you what you're hungering for if you want the Holy Ghost it can fall on you right now and the classic example from the Bible is when Peter is ministering at the Gentile cornelius's house and as Peter is ministering the Holy Spirit falls down upon them and these Gentiles I think they started speaking with tongues I'm not not I'm not not mistaken on that part but it was very to Peter man the Holy Ghost has fallen upon them and they haven't even been baptized yet they broke the rule that God gave God he's Sovereign he can always break his own rule so so to speak and I just kind of thought about that if God hadn't given the Holy Ghost to those Gentile Believers I wonder if Peter would have baptized them Peter was a pretty Prejudice guy so when God said when God pours out his holy spirit on these Gentiles he's saying to Peter these folks have my stamp of approval they better get yours you better baptize them but the point here is that God doesn't have the set God is not a checklist kind of God when you're hungry he'll give you what you ask for and you know what um Matthew 5 says even if you're hungering you haven't even been your hunger hasn't been satisfied yet but the very Act of having spiritual hunger carries a blessing with it because they that hunger and thirst after righteousness they shall be filled you're blessed just because you're Desiring the blessing and this testifies to the truth that you couldn't have a desire for something that didn't exist if that desire is there there is something there for that to be satisfied with that desire speaks of something else to come and satisfy it now sometimes when we we get to seeking and we can be seeking God and we and brother Brandon has a message called desperations we can get the feeling like man I need to I need to get desperate before God and there's a little bit of I think a confusion that could go on in our minds what the word desperate means desperate does not mean despair because despair is negative I'm despairing I have no hope I've got I I don't see any way out I am I am despairing that's different than being desperate when you've got such a strong desire that that nothing else can even come come close competing with that desire so when we are having a desperate desire for God it means we've got a really strong hunger we don't have to get despairing because God has promised and he will fulfill and what I kind of kind of come to see Satan's primary tool with many of us is confusion because I know I had a i my my walk with the Lord started um at an altar at a youth camp and I was just 13 years old started there the few years down the road I got to think and and did I really experience something there or not was it was it what was was it true what I had experienced or not and just kind of go back and forth and I'm sure we all have some um we can identify with that in some sense and I remember one one evening I was at home and just I think it was just my dad and me at home that evening and I I was down enough that I could even talk to Dad about it for some reason as teenagers we' had a hard time talking with mom or dad that just kind of how it goes um but God our parents uh know us better than anybody else they've probably prayed for us more than anybody else has and that was great just to be able to open up to him and he he said rap man when you came back from Camp you were you were you were a different kid you were different and that was a great reminder because i' just been gotten confused and I'd gotten so confused that I wasn't even accessing those blessings that God had given me confusion robs us of blessings of what God has already done for us God had already started to work in me but if s which is an exclamation point he started the work yes but if Satan can bend that exclamation point that experience to ack question mark did God start the work then all of a sudden it's not a blessed experience it's a cliffhanger experience again and if we're experiencing that Cliffhanger experience it means that there's something wrong in our thinking somewhere that we're that that we're buying into a lie of the devil somewhere because God is not the author of confusion but of Peace So if we're having some kind of a cliffhanger experience you just relax and rest on the links of that Divine chain of Grace and he'll carry you through and you'll enjoy the ride much better you really will but Satan uses confusion about the New Birth experience to Rob us of the blessings of what God has already done for us now when Jesus meets with Nicodemus in John chapter 3 he compares the Holy Spirit to the wind the wind blows where it listeth where it wants to and you hear the wind but you don't know where it's coming from from where it's going and he says that's exactly the way the spirit moves who can grab the wind you can't grab the wind you can hear it coming but where's it going you you don't know and brother bradam says you don't know where the wind comes from where it's been or where it's going but you know one thing you know where it's going to take you he's applying that to the spirit wherever it came from it'll take you back with it amen that's how he looks at the the Holy Spirit but the spiritual nature of the new birth makes it difficult to pin down the particulars because we want to know when did our walk with God start when did this happen to me there's something in us that wants to pin those things down um but I'll warn you if it's if brother if Jesus is comparing the spirit of God to the wind it's going to be hard to grab those particulars of the experience I would say hey just if the spirit's moving put your sail up and let that wind whever it's coming from it'll take you take you with it that's what we want I really enjoyed this next statement of brother Brandon I don't know the mechanics of the Holy Ghost but I know it's fell on me I don't know the mechanics of it and really what I don't care I don't I I don't care how my the mechanics find getting my car started some people really like that and they think that's that enriches their lives their experience it might enrich their their their pocketbook but I really don't care as long as it starts and I don't know the mechanics of the Holy Ghost but I know it fell on me that's the important thing I can't tell the mechanics of it but I know the blessings of it that's all I care to know about is the blessings of the Holy Ghost and mechanics he works them that's his secret God lets nobody into his kitchen think about the uh and and and in the book of Exodus or or numbers when they're they're given instructions how to make the perfume that the priest use that was a top secret recipe only the priest knew it and you know what it's Sovereign we can one thing will happen in one service and that's just for that service and we can try to imitate at another service and and it goes flat because it's not our recipe it's his recipe that's his secret God doesn't doesn't want us to seek a particular experience a certain Revelation or a particular level of perfection he wants us to seek Him and when we seek anything else it really cheapens The Experience so you think all that I am is that there's so much more to me than that God says just seek me sometimes we can get to analyzing our own experience with God like the bark on the tree man we just we we zoom in So Close how what is my experience with Godlike we just zoom in So Close get the details you know what scientists biologists they probably learn a lot people can really enjoy um studying the bark on a particular tree but if that's all that they see they're going to miss the forest for the trees and that's what it is like with us when we get to look so much examining our experience with the best of intentions that we can actually miss the beauty of what God is doing in broader terms in our lives and further so um we can just let God be God I remember years back uh I again I was going through a time and this was a different time and I was wrestling um am I Born of the do I have the new birth am I bapti the Holy Ghost all these things which kind brother brand says it kind of boils down to being the same thing I I was wrestling through it and I remember talking to to one older brother and he asked me the question R do you remember when you were born you I don't I don't and he looked at me and says but it looks to me like you were born cuz you're sitting right here and eating my food drinking my drink you were born and you can look at this this picture of this little baby and is this little baby alive well I know it's a picture of a baby but there's a picture of a a living live baby Pink Cheeks happy little smile this Baby's smile and things it looks like a live baby you know what we want to do is said this baby is not alive until we can go and find the birth certificate only when I find the birth certificate that says when it happened where it happened who was the doctor there on they're at the uh they're at the hospital only then if I see the birth certificate will I accept that you're alive now a government official will rely upon the birth certificate even though you're standing there personally but no we don't have to depend upon the birth certificate with all the details Stamped Out am I alive I am I am I'm alive do I remember do you remember when you were born you remember who the the the doctor was present you remember that you remember what time of day it was no but is he born he's shaking is he moving around yes he was born which tells me Hallelujah that my inability to remember the details of my birth does not alter alter the fact of your birth it doesn't matter it doesn't matter now I can remember when I was a young person I was at uh we had a we had a youth meeting and a bunch of young people in a circle there together and Pastor asked a question how many of you can remember the specific moment when the Lord came and filled you with his spirit and a couple hands went up I think wow those are really those are the real spiritual young people those are the the spiritual Powerhouse man I wish I had that experience you know what 20 25 years down the line those particular people who could raise their hands so confidently I've gone completely off the rails completely in the world not serving God in any fashion or form they're completely gone so they might have had or saw a particular experience a particular Revelation or a particular level of that they had detained and kept kept kept a certain standard for a long enough time yeah I've got it now but you know what if you're seeking any of those things without seeking on Christ there's no keeping power in that so even though they they were so confident that this was it this might have been a time when they experienced a certain thing but if it doesn't go deep and it's really Christ in you there's not the holding power there so if you today can't remember the particular specifics and that's been a hangout for you it's been a hang up for me for a while too you don't have to take your spiritual pulse do you have a desire for God you do then God started something because that's not natural and we can just rest in what God started and he will finish it the rest of the way yes sir and let's just take an example of this um of this kind of experience that brother brandom actually actually tells himself he tells about a a man who comes um he was a he was a businessman and he'd been seeking God for years and um he said this he tells brother Brandon that his his wife had been able to she went to a particular camp meeting and she'd gotten the spirit and was completely changed and he said uh I've been trying to get saved for years ever since and what what got him going was uh he there was somewhere in a restaurant or a bathroom somewhere he's all dist tracked is there a way to be saved and he picks it up and starts reading it and says man and that's kind of what started this whole this whole thing and he says I've uh I've tried for years I've been I've had so many experiences I've tried to get saved and brother brandom I think I've just crossed the line where I can't get saved brother Brandon and the brother brand say ah I I don't know about that and he said but look I I went to Billy grah to uh uh to Billy Grahams meetings wonderful man of God and he made an invitation I raised my hand came forward went into the inquiry room and was was talked to we prayed prayed the sinner's prayer and things the people great you're saved wonderful but they said I just nothing really happened I went on I I went on a couple years later I found the Free Methodist and they said hey if you just get happy enough to shout then you've got then you're you're saved he said I was there with them for a while and I finally got happy enough to shout they said yes you've got it brother they said it just wasn't wasn't content with it I still didn't have a he said I was still searching for all that I could and I went later to brother uh brother Roberts meetings or Oral Roberts and they took me back into the room and told me I had to speak with tongues and I they prayed over me long enough until I finally spoke with tongues but you know what I still didn't have it I just don't know what to do and then I was down in Shri Port he said at the office of the voice of healing and they told me that you were a prophet and I should come up here and you'd be able to reveal to me when the spirit would to come on you what my trouble was and I was reading this back in the office I had noticed this before imagine if someone has sent you to another Minister and says my this minister is the prophet of God and when the spirit comes upon him he'll tell you what you should do listen brother Brandon's response to that he says brother you don't have to be a prophet to do that the word of God settles that it doesn't need profit man me this man is coming to brother Brandon with a setup for brother brand to make himself greater and to lead the brother off track but he brings it right back says you don't need a profit for that it's right in your Bible I thought that was so so humble and how he just points this points the brother points us right back to the source not to himself because if it had been him answering the question the brother's Faith would depend on brother brother Brandon but he didn't pointed right back to the word and look at how he answers the brother's question he says my brother the only thing you're just confused I want to ask you something brother Brandon says in these slides the green is brother Brandon speaking the blue is the brother I want to ask you something did you always love the Lord Jesus said well I belong to the Pentecostal Church church but I just went there well what happened that you changed your mind all at once he says one day I was coming in for making a sale out in the yard and I happened to reach in my pocket and somebody had given me a little old track and I sat down in the office and begin to read this track and the awfulest feeling came over me that I ought to get right with God and I've been searching ever since and brother brand I want to ask you something when this feeling come over you you've never been able to get out of it no sir I haven't well that's when you received Christ I couldn't believe it all that time all that what does confusion do it robs you of a blessing you already have he says that's when you received Christ it doesn't mean raising up your hands that's all right shouting speaking in tongues all the demonstrations that's attributes that follows this but first just receive Christ then brother brandom I've been saved all the time sure look do you love him with all my heart but one time you didn't love him that's right and now you love him that's the truth well you had him all the time and he jumped off the porch and began crying holding me in his arms oh god I've been a Christian all these years you see the thing if it was he wasn't straightened out in the beginning brother Brandon didn't even pray for him it was the truth that set him free as all it was so repentance starting starting responding to God that's a part of receiving the Holy Spirit as God is sanctifying our life that's part of receiving the Holy Spirit we don't have to separate them into separate pieces now I've done this I've done a so B's going to come and C's going to come next hey sanctification is a lifelong process there it that doesn't stop I'm dead um but it's just it's it's we don't have to separate them the separate parts because all one experience so there's no reason to worry about where we are in the process God started the work right he'll see it through and uh you can think about that with the birth of a baby hey you got water breaking blood spirit but you know what it's all part of the process mom is not obsessing about exactly where I am in the process she just wants that baby out that's all that it is and once that life is in us we we can just rest that life it's going to come out it's good it's going to be there we can just rest and you know what the more that we get stressed in the process the longer it takes we just want to relax and let God have his way with us we must wait on the Holy Spirit till it's done something not necessarily because we spoke in tongues or because we danced or got emotional or shattered but until we were changed until something actually happened that is the biggest thing until we're changed I don't care what form it comes in just so it happened that's the main thing if it's loud if it's not loud I don't care if there's running and dancing fantastic if there's not that's fine too the main thing that I'm changed that's the main thing amen each Christian's experience can be different will be different and that's a beautiful thing I like this scripture of second Corinthians when we measure ourselves by ourselves and compare ourselves among ourselves we are not one eyes so yes it's a very natural thing to do that you can look and and I mean I how many of us have looked at at the testimony of older Christians before sometimes very often it could be inspiring but I've actually even been discouraged by it sometimes it's like how will I ever be like them Lord and I have a I have a testimony in my Bible from July for from 11th July 2001 it's still here first I I'm going to a camp and says the first I want victory in two specific areas of my life it says I want to be encouraged not discouraged by stronger Christians because I would see what their likes man I'm nothing like that there there must be classes of Believers there's first class Believers there's Comfort class Believers and I'm somewhere in economy class Believers but that's that was that was the mentality because I was comparing myself with them and saying what how could I be like them but the song isn't to be like my brother to be like my sister on Earth I long to be like them that's not the song that's not the song to be like Jesus that's that's the song um God is a god of variety he made you in this congregation your family each M of your family he made you in a variety some men are real blusterous we can all think in our minds who are the blusterous individuals some people are real dog atic those come up really fast so that black white people my goodness they're such IL legalists others are fine others are kind and you find all kinds of different people and all in his kingdom he didn't say the blessers and dogmatic people were fine and kind but they're in his kingdom all the same so we we're made in a unique way all of us are made differently but um he he talks about he says you can look at St Peter and judge by Andrew Andrew is this prayer Warrior just stayed on his knees all the time and Peter is one of those fire brands that preached and so forth and Paul was more scholarly like like the prophet or something and Moses wrote the first four books of the Old Testament he wrote the Old Testament and said and Paul wrote with the New Testament and all these are different kinds of people you look at the disciples how they just kind of graded on each other sometimes they're but they're all different but all in his kingdom I can remember growing up standing in the church next to to a friend of mine we just be singing Praise ra raising their hands praising the Lord I'd look over and man it's like he's just weeping weeping weeping and I like man I squeeze my eyes a little tighter just no nothing comes out nothing comes out but and for a while long man I what's wrong with me but then I I kind of got to realize we're just built differently I mean if his dad does prayer requests he's going to be weeping within saying the first couple read the first couple words he's just got to real s that's the way he's built my dad's just is pretty dry and practical that's just but neither one is more spiritual than the other just have to rest in how God made us God is a god of variety and our experiences will be customade for you don't seek someone else's experience just seek God and he will come custom made for you but you know what um we all looking for evidence of some kind we want to find what is the evidence what can I pin down say this is evidence that God is working in my life and this is the only thing that uh the biggest thing we have to go on John 14:26 alludes to it the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send into my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you and brother brandom says um the evidence is hearing what the spirit says you can have all kinds of experiences but if the holy spirit's speaking and you don't have an ear to hear it you don't have that receiver there you can do all that you want but doesn't mean you have it then he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit said unto the churches the spirit is speaking in each Church age only to those who have an ear had something to receive it the evidence for the brand says is hearing what the spirit says the spirit is talking yes the spirit is teaching that's exactly what Jesus said he would do when he came and he says later in the smon church age um the evidence of a Spirit-filled Christian believer is not to produce the truth or produce the word or to produce the life but to receive the truth receive the word and to believe it and to obey it so in Matthew 13 we can say okay I just have to hear the word believe the word receive the word it's it's that it's it's that simple let's want to kind of there's a little bit of a hangup we can get into sometimes there too Matthew 13 Jesus is speaking to the disciples after he's gone through all kinds teaching Parables and a lot of people didn't understand the Parables but the but Jesus tells the disciples blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear and the disciples get happy yes we are blessed because we have eyes to see and ears to hear and you can feel this way too sometimes and you've been told by a minister you hear brother Brandon preaching it that that if you hear the word for your day you've got it that that's that that that's that's the evidence then you can go through the what happens then if you're sitting in a service and you don't understand what the spirit has spoken that particular service then you start going were were were like this wellow the evidence is hearing the truth but I couldn't even understand it so where does that leave me that's tough so let's see what these disciples who were told at the beginning of the chapter blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear Jesus tells all these Parables about the sewer who went forth to sew and Seed by the waist all all these different things then the multitudes go away Jesus sent them away and he went into his house and his disciples came to him saying hey Jesus would you explain the parable to us because we didn't get it that first they were like yeah we've got blessed eyes but when they don't hear it they think man where does it leave us now God where does it leave us I thought I was blessed if I don't if I don't understand Daniel's 70 weeks or the mark of the beast or the seventh seal is there any hope left for me that's where we start going with our minds and I want to show us something here um and just see what we see here and we'll use it as an illustration we've got a picture here what do you see in the picture what do we see here what what the what are some of the first things your eyes might fall on brother dve what what do you see bird Brother David sees birds there are there are birds there it's very good what do you see brother he see a tree I see yep I see I see trees there also anybody else see something uh what else do we see see sorry sorry Hy Stacks or Huts very y very very true offense anybody see anything else palm tree palm tree yeah very good fence fence you're very surface Believers huh does anybody see the Elephant Man Sister Kim doesn't have the Revelation and she's a pastor wife man there must not be any help do you see it but you know when you see one of these pictures you see it if you know there's an elephant there you can't let go of the picture until you actually see it all right that's what Jesus was saying blessed are your eyes for they see that there is something to be seen glory and once you know that there's something to be seen you won't let take your eyes away from you'll just be looking and looking drinking and drink thinking and taking on taking on because your eyes see that there's something to see in one day it spirit's going to fall and you're going to see it it's been in your front of your eyes the whole [Applause] time did you find the elephant brother no okay okay so um the the the fence are the toes and the space between the that uh the uh the the space between the the thin Hut and the tree is the trunk do you see that oh good I need some assistance okay thank you so here's the here's a foot here's a foot here's the elephant's back his eyes and the trunk he's got it he's got it wow wow blessed are your eyes for you see and you can leave a sermon I've I've left Services sometimes has been in the back as and everybody is just seeming so re revelated elevated everything like that I'm like in the depths back at the back because I don't under I feel like I didn't get a single thing about it and when that happens the devil just starts whispering to you must not have ears to hear where does that put you now you can go on down that road and everybody's praising God and I couldn't even put my hands together and then I got to think hold on hold up hold up do I believe that Jesus died on the cross for me I do do I believe I'm I put my faith yes I'm saved yes I believe that and all of a sudden I started singing again praising him again I didn't understand everything in that service but I knew that he had begun a work in me don't let the devil ever take that away from you just hold that hold on to that let him hold on to you keep praising him for that and then you see that there's something to see you know there's something to hear stay tuned in and this brother was slower than even his wife but eventually God showed it to him too we're all there very good all there sorry don't impersonate somebody else's experience and we can try to do that um some us might have just done it right now by saying yeah I see the elephant we might not have how many of us have said amen before when we really didn't get it either yeah that can happen that can happen that can happen don't impersonate somebody else's experience because God is going to if you're a child of God you'll get it in the time that God has for you they've got little kids I I I I teach I teach at school and you know some some five or six year olds are ready to start kindergarten right away other kids ripen later and they wait a year and they're just is just fine nothing wrong with them but they're individuals we are that way too don't impersonate someone else's experience now I want to share with you a couple of little video clips from um the last day of school some years back and we had a brother come in and he was did an interactive activity he's a dangerous brother to ask because he likes to use eggs as object lessons and raw eggs as object lessons um that little kid just love it but he said hey come on up here and I will let you crack an egg on your head like yeah can I do it can I do it yeah so so they do that they little kids come up and they just they get to hold the egg on and whack and I mean everybody got to have a chance and I just wanted to take this is a little guy this is little Marcus I think he was probably first grade when this happened here let's just take a look at Marcus here there's actually sound on this too is there way to get sound on here no it's okay but he just let's look at that again he just that's wrong way wrong way there he goes he's got he's got it whack yeah it was it it was great and uh he would never be allowed to do this at home he could do this at do this at school so each one of the seniors got to come up and do it and finally U there was one senior who absolutely refused to do it and she got to nominate somebody to take her place and that was me so I got to have the experence exp erience with the egg myself too and it was a I got I got egg on my face as well there was one guy uh Levi here who had an experience with the egg that was matchless nobody could match this experience let's just take a look at his experience with the egg a minute look at it wind up wind up that egg it flew all over the place cuz he had his hands cassed a certain way that nothing could come out through his fingers it went it went it went on the podium behind it almost got to the American flag I mean it was an incredible experience and everybody was jealous of Levi's experience after that because they one of his friends gets up yeah that's it was bad one of his friends gets up and he's going to go and do it afterwards and he gets ready he's holding the exact same way and whack but it was different it didn't work out the way they was Levi and as I was watching this man this is really neat because every single person will have an experience with the egg every single person who comes up gets an egg in their hands we had a one of our seniors was kind of a cautious guy no I wouldn't call him timid that's I wouldn't call a guy timid but he's just a little cautious little reserved and he just takes egg and goes whack but he got egg on his face still he had an experience with the egg that was his own experience with the egg every single person had a different experience each one of you will have a different experience with God nobody else will match it you just value your own experience because as soon as I oh man my with the egg was so inferior to his experience hold up and here the egg is symbolizing your experience with God no experience with God is inferior God Almighty creator of the universe he comes into your life it wants to know you personally comes meets you personally if the details of your meeting were different than the details of of your meeting who cares you still had a moment with God so nobody's experience is inferior to anybody else's experience we can just Rejoice I had an experience with God that's amazing it's amazing and uh it was uh it was messy too but uh it was it was still a great thing don't impersonate anybody else's experience brother brandom asked the question so what's caused the misunder understanding what's caused the confusion he says the answer is experience we've gone by experience and not the word away with experience as your measuring line there's only one Plum line one rod and that is the word in the message from that time brother Brandon says I believe that a man comes to God and everyone has a definite experience oh maybe you think I'm beside myself but look I don't mean an impersonation of an experience we've got so much of that today till it makes a real Christian sick to look at it somebody trying to impersonate somebody else God is never made to the same he never did and he never will God's the god of variety he makes big Hills little Hills deserts swamp lands what more he's a god of variety don't try to impersonate anyone else be what you are and what God made you so when we try to copy someone else's experience we don't mean anything better by that but what we're doing is we're pushing ourselves into something that's a sovereign work of God we're humanizing the work of God and our well-intended efforts will just only frustrate the grace of God Galatians Chapter 2 Paul says I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but it's Christ who lives in me who lives the Christian life you don't it's Christ that lives in me the life which I know Live In the Flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God whose faith is it it's not your faith faith is a gift of God You Only Live the Christian Life by his faith living it out through you I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me I do not frustrate the grace of God for if righteousness came by the law then Christ is dead in vain who lives the Christian Life if Christ is in the human heart he will certainly live his own life for Christ is in you when Christ the Holy Spirit comes to your heart he is in you with your temperament there are some parts of our temperament that we would like to change but some parts just might be God expressing himself a certain way and we just need to yield that to him he's living his own life through his own will through you the holy spirit is such a definite must in this day because he is the one that lives your life you don't live it yourself so we just relax rest and let him live through us the new birth doesn't depend upon us but upon the seed of God swn within us and the sacrifice sacrifice Christ paid for us Acts chapter 13 when the Gentiles heard the gospel they were glad and glorified the word the Lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed ordained to eternal life or the foundation of the world that comes forever any Works happen they who were ordained could believe it's not they believed and therefore were ordained but no the the work of God depends completely upon the seed that is sewn within us from before the foundation of the word world now as we close going to take one more example because we've looked at um how we can't impersonate somebody else's experience we we shouldn't aim for particular experience we should just aim for Christ we've talked about even the how we um the the the truest evidence is hearing the word for your day but there could be things that we don't quite understand when it's being taught but we still understand there's something to be understood but you can see that there's a space there for the devil to se confusion and we also talking about a certain level of perfection we we shouldn't aim for that we just want to aim for Christ in each one of those areas there's places where the devil can SE confusion now I want to talk about this area we know a Christian Life needs to be a certain level that's how we think we want to be like Christ to be like Jesus and we know when we mess up and when we fail when we think we failed man I have failed too much um I'm uh goner and brother brandom takes this uh point in the question answers in 1954 he says on backsliding I wish somebody would ask me that because that's a tough topic every single day we know the mistakes that we make and the devil's going to be whispering our ear we're going to be putting ourselves outside of God's grace pretty quickly because we see our own weaknesses he says remember uh you backside every single day there's no way at all for you to keep out of it wow he says that pretty plain looking at a picture of a little cocko bur here how can I take a cocko bur and make a grain of wheat out of it it's impossible for me to do it the only way it can be is because inside that Cocker has been transmitted from a Cocker to a germ called wheat life so if you were to take that that that Cocker just cut it off cut it open and put a wheat seed inside and and plant it the cocko will be outside that wheat seed that wheat seed will just go out and explode through there you bury the cocko bur it'll produce a grain of wheat if it's got grain of wheat inside it because there's been that put put in there and the life of the Cocker has been taken out but the nature of the Cocker is still sticky and as long as you're in this life can we say that together as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky I'm going to be sticky we're both going to be sticky we're going to have a carnal nature that's going to bother you bother your wife bother your kids as long as you live I don't know if you guys you other spouses have conversation with with your with your husband or wife how long have we been married you know this about me and you still do this say I'm sorry hun I'm sorry but I I'll work on it we're do better but you know what as long as we're in this life together there's going to be things that just kind of go like this that's the conversation we have at home from time to time but the inside of you you're born again and when you're raised up you're in the likeness of Christ and all the sin is gone from you as long as you're in this life inside of you so that Cocker is dead but in but you've still got that nature there but inside of you that Cocker's planted wheat is going to come forth and brother brandom talks about in one message um he had two servers he mentions backsliding a little bit in both services and he talks about one thing that he says he has a weakness on and you think man I wish I had that weakness that's not such a bad weakness to have he said I just joke around too much and I I should be a little bit more more sober minded sometimes and he says as a reminder I think a good thing you ought to set on your desk to keep me a little more sober minded It's those three little monkeys one of them with his hands over his eyes See No Evil Hear no evil speak no evil if I could just have that on my desk and actually do it I'd be a lot more spiritual is what he says he says just keep your mind pure and on Christ you can't just say well now if you don't watch you'll get yourself over into a place and you keep on thinking I can do this that's kind of what he's saying here if you if you can just with this with the help of this little figurine I'll work better and not hearing any evil seeing any evil speaking I'll just work better he says careful just keep your mind p on Christ you can't just say well now I think he's expressing if you just do work hard it'll be all right he say no if you don't watch you'll get yourself over into a a place if you keep on thinking that don't think that don't think that you can't live so perfect so you don't make that mistake now so don't think you'll ever get that way because you won't you're not sinless and you'll certainly get off on their track on this side or on that side and I wanted to show an example of this just to show how how easy it is to make mistakes and how secure we can be even when there are mistakes and to do this I'm going to need a little help as as we're kind of closing up here could you blow one of these up for me yeah blow one of these up too just blow them up nice and nice and full and um these balloons are going to symbolize please tie it because I'm rotten at it so these balloons are going to symbolize y very good I'll tell you just a minute pressure's on my friend yeah balloons tying skills are life skills and they'll use it someday so oh no no well I'm not GNA ask somebody else to take that balloon you already wor we to see if we work with it oh wait Brother s wow that is a Father's Love that's a Father's Love wow very good so this this balloon here is going to symbolize our brother but in a condition where he has nothing of Christ inside of him not saying you're an airhead but that's what it kind of there's no cont could you hold this for me I need stand up please what is going to happen to this balloon or to our brother turn around so that they can see a better face than mine on the video what's going to happen to this brother when he faces the trials of life if there's nothing on the side to help him out here if the fire alarm goes off there's only this fire here what's going to happen there's no keeping power there he can work hard as he wants to but it's not going to it's not going to help him out we can say hey somebody else say I'm better than him because I'm a I'm a pastor's kid so maybe maybe he'll be better off and uh as this he's worked his he's worked his way out he's even gotten he's even gotten counseling and uh helping all these things he's approaching himself with only his own strength nothing from God on the inside trial comes what's going to happen to our brother po he's done it's not going to work real well and they said man he hadn't even backslid yet because there's nothing in them to start with yet so he's starting to see I need to get maybe if I go to church it'd be better off would help me come on up come on up you guys Brothers I've heard that Brothers can work well together not always but give it a shot I give you this I'm going to give you a balloon now we might start thinking water usually keeps fire from doing bad things so get as much water as you can into the balloon blow it up this is a tough thing I've got two guys working together see what you can do and getting water in there this is this is tricky this is tricky wow they're going to work together on this so they're going to try to get in a good atmosphere getting right things things like this and if there's an accident I've got a towel that's all right you want to get as much water in there as possible this is like you're going to the right places you're uh you're seeing the right uh singing the right songs good Godly Christian friends does it have an impact upon your your life in some way they've worked together very good very good is it going to work for them he can blow blow things up pretty well very good can you get any more water in there this is always interesting one is there water in there let's hear let's he is there a little water in there there's some water in there we'll give it a shot give it a shot and let's see you want to hold [Laughter] it I think he just threw you under the bus okay so let's see if this goes any different hey wow this is working just fine but all of a sudden I am so sorry brother I am so sorry God bless you God bless you very good very good thank you thank you guys thank you what happened there we're getting as much water into our lives much of the Holy Spirit much of God's word into our lives by being in the right place going to youth meetings like that and we're getting things into us and getting the right things into us do help us to avoid problems that other people might have that have no knowledge of God whatsoever these guys lasted longer but there's not enough there to really make a sustaining power these guys it was a work of the flesh all the way figuring out how can I get more water into me they blowing water blood and Tien up the work of the flesh all the way and their work was better than their work but that didn't pass the fire test ultimately and now we're talking remember about backsliding okay can I have a volunteer here yeah okay okay you think it's safe to volunteer now that's not every service I get to bring a nice water balloon in here so brother we are friends we don't throw the water balloon at each other we're we're good we're good Brothers very good okay you just hold this for me just hold it up at the top like that yeah very good now so this is a different what do you think's going to happen to this one I mean if it pops let's walk a little closer to the sisters so in case it pops we have a little more very good very good we'll just stay right here we'll just stay right here yeah that's all right yeah this is the one let's see what's going to happen to this balloon I can't hope hold it much longer what happened absolutely nothing happened nothing nothing happened you can see the evidence that this person got a little too close to the fire you can see that they got too close to the fire I mean and this is to me is an example of what it's like when a holy ghost filled believer does something wrong I've messed up and you can see I've got a scar there but God kept me there's no way there's no way that the work of the flesh could have kept me God kept me and you know what I'm kind of embarrassed about my scars here I'll I'll I'll I'll repent before the Lord I'll get my water bottle out here of of of of God's word would you open this for me yeah get yeah we'll just kind of there we good that we're just going to we're just going to let God clean clean clean me up we're going to do this and you can see I need a couple tissues here we can see you know what God's grace is great I'm getting cleaned up I've gotten Too Close we've gotten too close to the fire I've messed up how many of us have gone too far done things that we're just completely ashamed I said Lord How Could You Lord but you know what are you still alive I have a there's that desire for God is still pumping there's still life there yes thank you Lord and I'm ashamed I go forward I Repent before the Lord and He I more than I listen to his word and he just wipes me clean wipes me clean that to me is what this is what what it's being talked about here grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby your sealed unto the day of your Redemption what's the difference between this nice big water balloon this was not a work of man I had to get this attached to brother Sam's faucet back there and there had to be a power much stronger than the power of gravity in that bottle I had the holy spirit's power through the plum got to fill this up that's the difference you didn't have enough power to fill up with your own power Your Own Strength but you're sealed there the work of God sealed to the day of your Redemption not to the next Revival you weren't sealed that's just your emotionally being worked up but you're dead your life's hid in God through Christ you're sealed by the Holy Ghost if you were once baptized into that Holy Spirit now you can backslide that's true we saw that but I'm sealed and it didn't pop you can't get away from that seal amen and this is what Jude is talking about now this one other thing and the questions and answers brother Brandon says you're saved I'm so glad to know that Christ saves us we may backslide we may do wrong we all have our ups and downs but in your soul as soon as you do anything well there's something goes wrong in you that's the greatest sign there is your heart can be grieved by something that that you've done amen John uh Jude 24 and no unto him that is able to keep you from falling now we all have ups and downs that's part of the Christian Life the one who's able to keep you from falling and staying in that Fallen State God does that he's able to keep us from falling and to present us faultless before the presence of God of his glory with exceeding Joy proverb says a just man falls seven times yet Rises up again but the wicked will fall into Mischief the wicked will fall into fallenness but a just man will fall we can all say yes I've fallen but by God's grace he has made me just he has made me righteous so a Christian you almost say he falls forward because after we've Fallen we arise by God's grace strengthened again and growing in Grace we don't fall into Mischief or further fallenness so is the Christian Life that Cliffhanger experience it's not it's not we could even if we make a mistake and get close to the fire we're sealed by his Spirit within us we are safe and now we can just rest in the Holy Ghost he will he will keep us he start of the work he will finish the work and this person there they're not hanging on to anything they're completely resting in the rigging and we are resting in the work of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives amen let's pray Lord Jesus it's so wonderful father to see what you have done for us in the power of your work our best attempts just pale in comparison to what you have done for us oh God lord as I look back and I I I look even in my own life sometimes it's so easy still to revert back to those those those fleshly ways of think I just need to do better of this otherwise I won't be able to make the Rapture it's it's rapturing Faith it's rapturing Grace folks God called us by Grace he saved us by Grace he Sanctified Us by Grace he raptured Us by Grace we rest in that oh lord lord I pray for my brothers and sisters oh father if there's been some area in their lives that has been highlighted by your spirit today where we've been leaning upon our own flesh or
