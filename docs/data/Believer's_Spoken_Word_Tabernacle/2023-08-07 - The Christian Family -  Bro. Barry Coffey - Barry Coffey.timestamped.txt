[0:51] uh always special to come and talk about
[0:52] the Christian family and uh this is
[0:55] something that's very dear to our hearts
[0:57] and uh trust that something that said
[0:59] today will be a help to you and I'm
[1:01] going to say a lot so chances are
[1:03] statistically uh you're probably going
[1:05] to get something that you can take away
[1:06] and uh I'm I'm hoping uh hoping in that
[1:10] so you have a a set of notes you should
[1:13] have a set of notes between you and uh
[1:15] if you want to make notes on that
[1:17] certainly welcome to everything that I'm
[1:19] going to say is public domain so you can
[1:22] if you're recording this and and Brother
[1:24] Sam has the he's going to have all the
[1:27] Powerpoints so I'm going to go fast I
[1:29] normally speak at 150 words a minute but
[1:31] I gust to 220. uh so today I'm going to
[1:35] be moving uh a lot I'm going to put a
[1:37] lot in and by the third session you're
[1:39] going to kind of be looking at me all
[1:41] side but you will have all of this
[1:43] information okay and all the Powerpoints
[1:45] so don't lose me by trying to make notes
[1:48] on everything you will have the resource
[1:51] and be able to take it with you as I'm
[1:53] going to refer to lots of things and
[1:55] this is this is uh I think going to be
[1:59] very practical for you so before we
[2:01] begin uh and and do anything any further
[2:04] let's let's have a word of prayer and uh
[2:07] we're going to start with this scripture
[2:09] and we're going to use it as a basis
[2:11] here in Jeremiah chapter 31 and one
[2:13] maybe we could have you stand just out
[2:15] of respect to the word
[2:16] [Music]
[2:20] Jeremiah 31 and 1 at the same time saith
[2:23] the Lord will I be the God of all the
[2:25] families of Israel and they shall be my
[2:28] people
[2:29] Lord we feel privileged to read that
[2:32] today because we believe Lord when you
[2:34] made that statement through the Prophet
[2:35] Jeremiah you are actually looking at us
[2:38] and now in the name of Jesus Christ we
[2:40] commit this day into your hands and pray
[2:43] that you would Breathe upon it that Lord
[2:45] you administer to every heart every soul
[2:48] every family that's represented here
[2:49] today Lord even the singles that are
[2:52] gathered Among Us lord it's it's a good
[2:55] environment a good uh good instruction
[2:58] for everyone to hear and so Lord we pray
[3:01] for your anointing we pray for your
[3:03] presence to be here today and Lord this
[3:06] is your day we give it to you like an
[3:07] offering and just say Lord consume it
[3:09] and breathe Upon Us in the name of Jesus
[3:12] Christ we pray
[3:14] amen and amen you may be seated
[3:21] all right page one in your note page two
[3:23] in your notes here but let me give you a
[3:24] little intro because I got to qualify uh
[3:27] the fact that I'm I'm qualified to do
[3:29] this number one I'm married and I'm
[3:31] honored to have uh my wife with me here
[3:33] today this was at the White House in
[3:35] 2019 uh uh
[3:38] sister Trump wanted us to come and see
[3:40] the decorations there and uh so we had a
[3:43] good connection in the White House and
[3:45] uh that we we had this picture made now
[3:48] I also am a family man and when we got
[3:50] married we decided to stick with boys
[3:52] and so uh when Lucas got married he's
[3:56] the last of our boys when he got married
[3:57] we decided uh to have a pitcher made and
[4:01] so this is the one we're not ashamed to
[4:03] show
[4:04] so this is all of us here and on the
[4:07] right is my father-in-law brother
[4:08] fulture he's 96 years old and uh I
[4:11] figure we'll have to shoot him because
[4:14] he
[4:15] he just doesn't want to cross over but
[4:17] uh
[4:19] we are we were honored to have uh all of
[4:22] this picture taken so here's the
[4:23] breakdown here's Andrew and Rebecca on
[4:26] the left and uh with their uh children
[4:29] and Peter and Rachel in the middle Steve
[4:31] and Sarah and then Lucas got married
[4:33] however this is my pride and joy in life
[4:36] here and I'm just dying for somebody to
[4:39] invite me to come and speak on
[4:40] grandchildren because I have one rule
[4:43] for grandchildren raising grandchildren
[4:44] is give them whatever they want
[4:47] that's that's how we do it so they are a
[4:50] great joy in our lives and we we
[4:52] appreciate them very much now so that
[4:55] gives me my right to speak about
[4:57] families today because we've been there
[4:59] done that got the scars to show it
[5:01] but let's look on page two if you don't
[5:03] mind here and I appreciate Brother Sam
[5:04] uh doing the the notes Here everything
[5:07] that we're going to talk about today is
[5:09] on the notes and there's some things on
[5:12] the PowerPoint that are not in these
[5:13] notes here so uh you you should have it
[5:16] pretty pretty handy
[5:18] and uh
[5:20] and I I was I was revising this up to
[5:23] about eight o'clock this morning so the
[5:25] PowerPoint is going to be just a shade
[5:27] different it's going to have more stuff
[5:28] in it than what's in the notes here but
[5:29] again you can have the PowerPoint
[5:32] I have to say this just as these few
[5:34] introductory notes here I'm not a
[5:36] miracle worker
[5:37] okay these are principles a lot of the
[5:40] principles are general principles so I'm
[5:42] not going to talk about your children
[5:43] and your household maybe except charity
[5:46] and Nathaniel I know those kids but uh
[5:49] these These are general principles that
[5:52] you can apply so you can glean from this
[5:54] what you can and brother Branham says
[5:57] and then Jesus came it's the darkest
[5:58] hour that the family has ever seen take
[6:01] note of the year it's 66 almost 66 years
[6:05] ago to the day almost 66 years ago it's
[6:10] The Darkest Hour the family's ever seen
[6:11] look at the families broke up there's
[6:13] more divorces in America alone than
[6:15] there is in the whole rest of the world
[6:17] put together
[6:19] divorces on the Rampage and where has uh
[6:22] the honesty and the sincerity and the
[6:24] Womanhood of our American women gone to
[6:27] so here's a 20th century Prophet
[6:29] speaking the 20th century families and
[6:32] letting them know that divorces run
[6:33] rampant 66 years ago
[6:36] and he's got an insight there and he's
[6:39] actually very accurate number two by
[6:42] virtue of our births we are citizens of
[6:45] two kingdoms those kingdoms are
[6:47] diametrically opposed to one another
[6:49] so the things that we believe are not
[6:51] the things that are held in esteem in
[6:54] our culture and vice versa so therefore
[6:57] you have to learn uh to uh to navigate
[7:00] through this world
[7:02] that's challenging enough for all of us
[7:04] but here's the great challenge if you
[7:07] have children you have to teach those
[7:09] children to navigate in a world that's
[7:11] rapidly changing and falling apart
[7:16] so everything about this world is
[7:17] falling apart in in number three Psalm
[7:20] 34 Comey children and hearken unto me
[7:23] and I will teach you the fear of the
[7:25] Lord God's original Masterpiece was not
[7:27] a church the first thing that God did in
[7:29] the Book of Genesis was have a family
[7:31] right have a marriage have a family
[7:33] that's the first thing and so it it
[7:36] looked like this there was a family uh
[7:39] in the Garden of Eden and at the center
[7:41] of that family was a marriage that was
[7:42] the essence before there were pillars of
[7:44] fire before there was prophets before
[7:46] there was Commandments there was a
[7:48] family
[7:49] and there was a marriage and before we
[7:52] got past chapter three and four we had
[7:55] an attack on that marriage and family
[7:58] and so this is this is a construct of
[8:03] God this is his idea and this is his
[8:07] design
[8:08] and so therefore naturally Satan is
[8:10] going to fight that in every way the
[8:13] family really belongs to God your
[8:15] children belong to God and as soon as
[8:17] you begin to realize that you don't own
[8:19] them but you're an ambassador to them
[8:21] the better off you'll be
[8:23] in Psalm 127 we'll deal with this this
[8:26] afternoon except the Lord build a house
[8:27] slave though they labor in vain that
[8:30] build it and accept the Lord keep the
[8:31] city The Watchmen wake but in vain so
[8:35] the the whole Essence is is that when we
[8:38] when we are concerned about family and I
[8:40] assume you are because you showed up or
[8:42] you want to have one uh there there is a
[8:46] desire in our hearts to do it the right
[8:49] way to do it God's way and if you're
[8:52] going to do that you're not going to get
[8:54] that information from the cosmos
[8:56] matter of fact let me ask you this
[8:58] question where do you go today
[9:00] where do you go to get good information
[9:02] about raising your children
[9:05] what what resources do you use
[9:08] back in back in the day I remember we
[9:11] had a radio station that was on and Dr
[9:13] Dobson used to be on I've done a half
[9:15] hour program a day he's not a voice
[9:17] anymore tell me who are the voices today
[9:19] that you would listen to that uh and and
[9:21] he we we listen to him on that radio
[9:24] program and he had some good things to
[9:26] say he had some truths that he had
[9:27] embraced and shared and uh you know
[9:30] there was a couple of others that were
[9:32] doing similar things but where do you go
[9:34] today
[9:36] what personality can you identify today
[9:39] outside of your pastor
[9:42] pastors who are here where do you go
[9:44] internet
[9:45] how's that going
[9:48] man that's a free-for-all right that's a
[9:51] zoo out there try to find something
[9:54] sensible or moral out there or something
[9:56] you can't you don't have to filter and
[9:58] you don't have to pray over five or six
[10:00] times before you show it to somebody
[10:02] because it I mean it's it's just it's
[10:05] crazy and it's getting crazier where do
[10:07] you go
[10:08] well we go back to the Bible yeah
[10:11] naturally duh
[10:12] sorry and you you you we go to the
[10:16] message
[10:18] but you're I mean there's no there's no
[10:21] family series
[10:23] in brother man's Ministry
[10:25] right there's no raising teenagers 101
[10:29] in the message now it's there
[10:32] it's there and a lot of what you're
[10:34] going to hear from me is from there and
[10:36] from the scripture but you got to look
[10:38] for that and ministers are anointed to
[10:40] look for that a little bit differently
[10:41] than you would like we were talking last
[10:43] night at supper there's a great little
[10:45] teaching brother Branham has at the
[10:46] beginning of indictment
[10:48] well naturally you're not going to kind
[10:50] of go to and the message indictment for
[10:52] family instruction right I mean that
[10:55] kind of doesn't click but for ministers
[10:57] now it's a little bit different because
[10:58] you know we we uh you know find those
[11:01] things but where do you go
[11:04] there's a dearth of information good
[11:07] information out there
[11:09] and so that's why and I'm not saying
[11:12] this for the wrong reason that's why
[11:13] every imitation that I'm taking this
[11:16] year to travel is from last year's
[11:18] invitations
[11:20] I can't keep up with uh the imitations I
[11:23] was in Hungary last weekend last last
[11:25] week
[11:26] I was in Hungary recently
[11:29] um it's been less than two weeks and the
[11:31] ministers who showed up over there all
[11:33] came to me at one of the meals and they
[11:35] sat down with their address books and
[11:37] they said we want you to come to our
[11:38] country we want you to be here there is
[11:40] nine different countries represented uh
[11:42] in the meeting there and I'm not saying
[11:44] that for the wrong reason I'm just
[11:45] saying that there are cycles of need
[11:47] that the people of God had you're a
[11:49] blessing despite what everybody says
[11:50] about you you're a blessing
[11:53] and uh
[11:56] and I like these sessions because it's
[11:58] the only one where you can drink coffee
[11:59] and get kind of get away with it right
[12:01] if you can eat donuts in church I can
[12:03] drink coffee so
[12:09] so it's it's a it's a need that that
[12:12] people have and you're here because you
[12:14] you even if you're doing a lot of things
[12:16] right and a lot of you are doing a lot
[12:18] of things right we can probably do
[12:20] things a little better and we can learn
[12:21] a little bit more because you're facing
[12:23] a really challenging time to raise
[12:26] children and so that's why you have to
[12:29] make sure that you understand you're an
[12:30] ambassador to your children a
[12:32] representative of the kingdom of God and
[12:34] those children are not yours you have
[12:36] them on loan for a season and I'll
[12:38] guarantee you take it from me I know
[12:40] what I'm talking about they'll go
[12:42] we tried to bribe our kids with
[12:44] everything we had within us to stay
[12:46] because we love our boys and we wanted
[12:48] them to stay tractors cars tools money
[12:52] whatever it was but the smell of perfume
[12:55] always wins I mean
[12:58] it it it you're gonna lose the battle
[13:00] number four
[13:03] the principles apply even though they
[13:05] might be Old Testament or they might be
[13:07] biblical or whatever else or brother
[13:08] Brown's day the principles work you have
[13:10] to learn to identify principles in
[13:12] scripture and apply them it's just like
[13:15] uh in number four it says they're
[13:16] General Rommel and my uncle actually
[13:18] fought against General Rommel in World
[13:20] War II in North Africa he he was
[13:23] successful and so successful because he
[13:26] studied the tactics of Robert E Lee
[13:28] and even though the the deserts of North
[13:31] Africa were very different than the
[13:33] fields of Antietam uh he was successful
[13:36] because he applied to principles that's
[13:37] your challenge as well the Christian
[13:39] family by definition and we're going to
[13:41] deal with this a couple of different
[13:43] times is a family who places Christ at
[13:46] the center of all they do
[13:48] and the secret of a good family is
[13:50] disarmingly simple you cultivate the
[13:53] family's relationship with Jesus Christ
[13:55] and then there's no phase of family life
[13:58] there is no problem we face that is
[14:00] outside the influence of the Holy Spirit
[14:02] and everybody says
[14:04] amen
[14:05] by definition and this is mine a
[14:08] Christian family is a group of people
[14:10] who are related to each other through
[14:11] marriage birth or adoption
[14:13] and are committed first and foremost
[14:16] to the person and the work of Jesus
[14:18] Christ Faithfully witnessing to the love
[14:21] power and forgiveness of God and they
[14:24] have that as a theme but as for me and
[14:28] my house will serve the Lord
[14:31] so we're not talking about having a
[14:33] house we're talking about developing a
[14:35] household for God
[14:37] wherever that is
[14:39] number six there may be no tomorrow but
[14:41] we train anyway part of our leadership
[14:43] and stewardship responsibility is to
[14:45] equip the new generation as well as
[14:47] partis anticipating the challenges that
[14:50] exist before us
[14:51] that's the challenge and that's a real
[14:53] challenge
[14:55] number seven our responsibility is his
[14:57] bride is to live for Christ to please
[14:58] him and our responsibility as parents is
[15:01] to utilize all the resources and
[15:03] opportunities at our disposal to spread
[15:06] the message of Hope to begin a faith to
[15:08] become a faithful witness of the truth
[15:10] and to inspire Challenge and equip those
[15:13] who believe to shine as lights in the
[15:16] present world and the place we're going
[15:17] to start is your own household all right
[15:20] now here's a quote we're going to use
[15:22] this several times today brother Banner
[15:24] made this statement and I love this
[15:26] statement he said now we've got to think
[15:28] of our young people
[15:30] this is 1962 I think it is we got to
[15:33] think of our young people and we got to
[15:34] think of others that's coming on behind
[15:36] us these young people and a place for
[15:39] our children
[15:40] our daughters we don't want them out in
[15:43] the world in these things we want them
[15:46] girls raised like their mothers
[15:52] and it's going to automatically happen
[15:54] because you're in the message
[15:56] that's not what he says
[16:00] this is an intentional
[16:02] proactive
[16:03] unpurposed decision
[16:05] that parents make
[16:08] and we've got to make arrangements for
[16:10] that who's got to make arrangements does
[16:13] he say the holy spirit's going to make
[16:14] it rain the holy spirit's got this all
[16:16] worked out and he's going to come into
[16:17] your house and make this happen he
[16:19] doesn't say that he said we've got to
[16:21] make arrangements for that
[16:24] we don't know how long tomorrow is right
[16:26] we didn't think our boys would grow up
[16:28] and and eventually get married we still
[16:30] we we still remember all the
[16:32] homeschooling years right and we we
[16:34] never thought that they would be where
[16:36] they are today but we've got to make
[16:39] arrangements for that even if we uh we
[16:41] think there's no tomorrow and and that's
[16:44] what brother branham's handing us as
[16:46] parents and as leaders in her household
[16:49] he's handing us that responsibility to
[16:52] uh to think about how you want your
[16:56] daughters raised it's not going to
[16:58] automatically happen your children are
[17:00] not born with respect they're not born
[17:03] with an understanding of the Commandment
[17:06] that says honor your father and your
[17:07] mother they're not born with us with a
[17:10] with a a Godly conscience there's things
[17:13] you're going to do in their lifetime
[17:14] that's going to help shape their
[17:16] understanding of things and their
[17:18] perspective and so brother I am saying
[17:20] you gotta you gotta look at this
[17:21] realistically if we don't want our young
[17:23] people if we don't want our daughters uh
[17:26] to be raised like the world but we want
[17:27] them raised like their mother we got to
[17:29] make a decision all right so this is the
[17:31] way I translated that to my boys I said
[17:33] if you want to have a home where your
[17:35] wife can stay home and homeschool your
[17:36] children if you want
[17:39] you know what you're going to have to do
[17:40] you're going to have to smarten up and
[17:42] do good in school and get yourself a
[17:45] degree or a job or a skill that allows
[17:48] you to be able to bring home enough
[17:49] bacon so that your wife has the option
[17:52] to stay home if she wants
[17:54] you understand me
[17:56] there's a decision you guys got to make
[17:59] prior to having children that's going to
[18:03] allow your wife to be able to raise your
[18:05] children at home like you were raised at
[18:07] home
[18:08] you don't have to but if you're going to
[18:11] do that there's a decision you got to
[18:12] make when you're 12 13 and 14. so I
[18:15] encourage all my boys when they were 12
[18:16] 13 14 they get serious about trying to
[18:19] find yourself to track that God has for
[18:22] you
[18:23] what path do you think God wants you to
[18:26] be on what what uh what has God put in
[18:28] you what gifts and talents has God put
[18:30] in you and you want to lean that way you
[18:33] want to you want to develop those
[18:34] talents because God put them in there
[18:36] for a purpose
[18:37] because you know what if you don't do
[18:39] that and you you decide that you're
[18:41] going to play a bunch of video games
[18:42] here in your part in your spare time and
[18:44] uh you know idle your days away you're
[18:47] going to have to marry a wife who's
[18:49] either come from some really wealthy
[18:51] father or she's going to have to work
[18:53] one or the other because in most cases
[18:56] in most parts of the world it takes
[18:59] about a salary and a half to feed a
[19:01] family today
[19:03] I said it takes about a salary and a
[19:05] half
[19:06] to feed a family unless unless you
[19:10] really get focused and tracked and
[19:12] you're in the will of God and use the
[19:14] talents God's given you develop those
[19:15] and if you're going to be a a teacher be
[19:18] a really good teacher if you're going to
[19:19] be an engineer be a really good engineer
[19:21] if you're going to uh you know whatever
[19:23] you're going to do you've got to think
[19:25] about your wife and then think about
[19:28] your children so these decisions don't
[19:30] happen when we when we're on our way to
[19:32] the hospital to deliver our first child
[19:34] these decisions are made when you're 12
[19:36] and 13. you get it
[19:38] so my job as a parent is to sit down
[19:40] with these guys before they're shaving
[19:42] and to say hey buddy you know what you
[19:45] got to think about this
[19:47] and you're going into high school you
[19:49] got to think about this you don't have a
[19:51] choice everybody with me
[19:53] so that's what that's what brother man
[19:55] was talking about here and uh you know
[19:58] our interest is not in uh politics our
[20:00] interest is not in trying to reshape the
[20:03] culture uh we're not Bill Gothard here
[20:05] we we're we're just trying to track our
[20:08] kids in the perfect will of God and so
[20:10] this is really important here so this is
[20:12] the structure you know in terms of New
[20:14] Testament this is the structure that God
[20:17] determined for us and uh this is the way
[20:20] that that things are right I mean this
[20:22] is not brother Barry's rules or brother
[20:24] Sam's rules this is God's rule that
[20:27] children obey their parents and the Lord
[20:28] for this is right it's a really
[20:30] interesting uh to let your kids know
[20:32] that there's a blessing when you obey
[20:34] you know they think it's all rules and
[20:36] regulations but it there's a blessing
[20:38] involved when they obey
[20:40] and at the center of that household is
[20:43] this relationship the relationship
[20:45] between Christ and his bride which is a
[20:47] type of the relationship between husband
[20:49] and wife
[20:50] and I will tell you something if you
[20:52] want to have a successful home and raise
[20:54] your children well this relationship is
[20:56] the primary one and this is the one you
[20:58] have to keep your eye on all the time
[21:00] we're going to talk about this later
[21:02] this evening in number three but this is
[21:04] the one that you've got to always keep
[21:06] your eye on and I've told my boys for
[21:08] years I never made a vow to you guys
[21:11] so you know what you can come and go
[21:14] but I made a vow to one person in this
[21:16] world and I've got to make sure that I
[21:18] stay focused on that relationship no
[21:20] matter what happens and no matter what
[21:22] season of life I've I've made a vow to
[21:24] one person and if we have differences
[21:26] we've got to resolve them if we if we
[21:29] are going to be strong in our household
[21:30] we her and I we've got to work at that
[21:33] we got to stay together because every
[21:35] other relationship in the house revolves
[21:37] around that one relationship everybody
[21:40] okay
[21:41] all right so one of the most successful
[21:44] uh series that I ever did was called
[21:46] shalom in the home and it's uh it's a
[21:49] 20-something uh thing that I did uh
[21:52] you're welcome to look at it and I kind
[21:53] of had some of these things broken down
[21:55] but I used this scripture uh to to uh
[21:59] form a foundation for that series and in
[22:02] Zechariah Chapter 8 Zechariah is a
[22:04] fantastic book A lot of it has to do
[22:06] with prophecy but Zechariah also told
[22:09] the people who were in captivity that
[22:11] when you go back to the land when you go
[22:13] back
[22:14] here's how I want things done God told
[22:17] them he said this these are the things
[22:19] that I want you to do when you go back
[22:20] to the land of Israel again you've been
[22:22] out for 70 years I'm going to allow you
[22:24] to go back now and this is what I want
[22:26] you to do he says again have I thought
[22:29] in these days to do well unto Jerusalem
[22:31] into the house of Judah and fear ye not
[22:33] so I I I determined that this is the
[22:37] amount of time now you're going to go
[22:39] back to Jerusalem now you're going to go
[22:40] back to the house of Judah speaky every
[22:43] man here's what I want you to do
[22:45] these are the things that ye shall do I
[22:48] love it when God tells us this is what I
[22:50] want you to do or you know when brother
[22:51] Branham says I want you to pray this way
[22:54] I think that's great because it takes
[22:55] the burden off right what am I what am I
[22:57] supposed to say now and brother Brandon
[22:59] says say pray this way I think it's
[23:00] great
[23:01] here's Zechariah saying this is what
[23:04] you're going to do when you go back to
[23:05] the land and for you now when you go
[23:08] back to your household
[23:10] this is the thing you shall do number
[23:11] one speak every man truth to his
[23:14] neighbor
[23:15] the Cardinal or the primary
[23:17] characteristic of your household
[23:20] will be identified as a people who speak
[23:23] truth
[23:25] number two you will execute or govern
[23:27] and in the Hebrew that means govern the
[23:30] Judgment of Truth and peace in your
[23:32] Gates
[23:33] within your household we're going to
[23:36] Prior prioritize two things that is
[23:39] truth and peace shalom
[23:42] in our gates
[23:43] so we're going to strive for being
[23:46] honest with one another and we are going
[23:48] to strive for establishing shalom in the
[23:51] home
[23:52] is that okay
[23:53] so that's where I got that series and
[23:56] let none of you imagine evil in your
[23:58] hearts against these neighbor and love
[23:59] no false
[24:01] oath for all these things do I hate uh
[24:03] saith the Lord so this was the
[24:05] foundation and establishing or governing
[24:08] my house based on truth and peace are
[24:11] two real challenges because we live in a
[24:13] very dishonest world and we also live in
[24:16] a world that is anything but peaceful
[24:19] and your kids are not experiencing peace
[24:22] so it's a it's a real challenge in
[24:25] Jehovah Jireh brother Branham said now
[24:26] lot being greedy now by the way I know
[24:29] I'm going fast but I'm still doing
[24:31] foundational stuff here if we have time
[24:33] we'll take a little break okay and and
[24:36] just a little stretch break so just bear
[24:38] with me here as we go through this
[24:40] brother bam said now lock being greedy
[24:42] he looked down there and he saw the
[24:44] great things already built up in Sodom
[24:46] when lot looked at Sodom and here's
[24:48] brother Ram describing what was in his
[24:49] head he didn't have to walk with God
[24:52] Alone he didn't want
[24:54] by the way read what it says not what I
[24:57] say because I I sometimes I go too fast
[25:00] he didn't want to walk with God Alone he
[25:03] wanted to mix up with the world
[25:05] great businessman influence in the city
[25:08] make a few extra dollars those are those
[25:11] things are not evil in themselves
[25:13] he got a good position there but he was
[25:15] backslid
[25:16] now he said that's the church carnal but
[25:19] he's talking about a lot now as a as a
[25:20] father and a husband
[25:22] and he got down there mixed up with the
[25:24] world
[25:26] where perverts and everything else was
[25:29] and took his daughters down there his
[25:33] wife and put them right in the midst of
[25:36] a bunch of bunch like that
[25:39] so he he's got these intentions here a
[25:42] good position a good salary influence in
[25:45] the city good businessman not evil in
[25:47] itself but where he chooses to do this
[25:50] is going to have an effect on his family
[25:53] so I will tell you something that where
[25:55] you go to church matters
[25:57] where you decide to live matters you all
[26:01] don't need to be here or there or there
[26:04] or my place but you need to be somewhere
[26:06] where your family is ministered to
[26:09] that's the will of God and you've got to
[26:11] be in a place where uh even even if it's
[26:15] not as good a business or even if it's
[26:17] not as wealthy a position or whatever
[26:20] else you've got to make a decision
[26:21] because where you are is going to
[26:23] influence the generation that God's
[26:25] given you to raise
[26:26] and your wife
[26:28] and we know that's true about Sodom
[26:30] so here again is that quote taken signs
[26:34] of Jesus and again we're going to come
[26:36] to that make an Arrangements uh making
[26:39] arrangements for the future generation I
[26:41] gotta ask you this how many of you have
[26:43] daughters let's see your hands wow wow
[26:47] honey we are odd
[26:50] Sam you don't have daughters do you
[26:54] Lord willing you might have daughters in
[26:56] law someday now that's a treat
[26:58] and when you have daughters and a lot of
[27:00] potential for grandchildren arrives and
[27:03] that's way better I say that
[27:05] grandchildren are a reward for not
[27:06] killing your own
[27:11] don't laugh
[27:15] so David says in Psalm 78 I will open my
[27:19] mouth in a parable and I will utter
[27:21] sayings of old which we have heard and
[27:23] known and our fathers have told us
[27:25] watch now
[27:27] we will not hide them
[27:30] we will not hide them
[27:33] from their children
[27:34] showing to the generation to come
[27:37] the Praises of the Lord and his strength
[27:40] and his wonderful works that he has done
[27:41] for he's established a testimony in
[27:43] Jacob and appointed Allah on Israel
[27:45] which he commanded our fathers
[27:48] that they should make them known to
[27:50] their children
[27:52] you understand what he's saying if
[27:53] there's anyone in the world who's going
[27:55] to pass on a legacy of the exploits of
[27:58] our God it's going to be you
[28:00] and you're commanded to pass them on to
[28:02] your children and to your children's
[28:04] children this is what I refer to as an
[28:07] intergenerational responsibility
[28:10] to teach your children and mold their
[28:12] thinking that number one our God is not
[28:15] dead He's Alive
[28:17] who knows that better than you and you
[28:19] know it because somebody told that
[28:21] somebody shared that with you and and
[28:23] brother random uh you know In Our
[28:25] Lifetime we've listened a lot to the
[28:26] stories and the testimonies and even
[28:28] people who were alive uh in the day when
[28:30] brother Branham was here and all the
[28:32] tapes and so forth tell us of the
[28:34] exploits of our God
[28:35] right
[28:37] you're that that's not given to you just
[28:39] so that you can say well amen and then
[28:41] go home and forget about it you have a
[28:43] responsibility now to teach your
[28:45] children and your children's children
[28:47] I just started a little bible study with
[28:50] my grandchildren and I think it's great
[28:52] and I said I said to them you can ask
[28:54] whatever question in the world you want
[28:57] you can start whatever subject you want
[28:59] it doesn't matter at all and we're kind
[29:01] of gonna kind of we're gonna kind of do
[29:05] it with just me and them and sister
[29:08] Becky obviously if she wants to join in
[29:10] but this is an opportunity for me to
[29:13] pass on to them some of the things that
[29:15] I know and I've heard and I've
[29:17] experienced and by God's grace now
[29:20] they're starting actually to come with
[29:21] me on the mission field I took William
[29:23] uh to Africa in December and he had a
[29:25] fantastic time he's 10 years old nine
[29:28] years old and came to us in Africa I'll
[29:31] show you pictures tomorrow and it was
[29:33] just fantastic to have him there with me
[29:35] you know and it was just great and and
[29:37] see some of the wild animals and the uh
[29:39] the work that's being done we went out
[29:40] in the village there with the Maasai
[29:43] people and it was just a life-changing
[29:45] experience for him and you know what
[29:47] that's nice and you're all saying Oh but
[29:50] you know what that's my responsibility
[29:51] to pass on to my children's children the
[29:54] exploits of our God God is real he's
[29:56] alive and he's doing things in other
[29:58] parts of the world even if even if we
[30:00] don't always see it or hear it on CNN uh
[30:03] it's real nonetheless God is still alive
[30:05] and God's moving right God's preparing a
[30:08] bride for the rapture amen so therefore
[30:12] if we want to make a household for God
[30:13] we've got to consciously make a place
[30:16] where the holy spirit's always welcome
[30:19] if you look at your job description as a
[30:21] parent you will find certain
[30:23] responsibilities there but you'll find
[30:25] other things that are not there number
[30:26] one that's not there is a savior you are
[30:29] not the savior of your children
[30:32] you cannot save them you cannot fill
[30:34] them with the Holy Ghost right if you
[30:36] look at God's job description it's on
[30:38] there and it's not on yours but you know
[30:40] what I found out I have to do is to
[30:43] create an atmosphere where the holy
[30:44] spirit's always welcome
[30:46] and then when he decides to pass by he
[30:50] can deal with my children's Hearts
[30:51] through our Bible study through our home
[30:53] school through our family dinners or
[30:55] whatever else on our vacations that God
[30:58] can deal with our children because
[31:01] because we have created an atmosphere
[31:04] that he's always welcome
[31:05] I got to make sure I don't include
[31:07] anything in our household or our
[31:09] household activities that would grieve
[31:11] the Holy Spirit we want him on our side
[31:13] we want him in our house right the
[31:17] second thing is that we want to have a
[31:18] place that is separate from Sodom so
[31:20] like Allah had a door between Sodom and
[31:24] his family we also want to create a
[31:26] barrier between Sodom and its effects
[31:29] and influence and our family is
[31:32] everybody okay
[31:33] so that means we're going to be
[31:34] proactive in watching who comes in and
[31:36] whether they come in on a wire whether
[31:39] they come in on a wave what do they come
[31:41] in in a beam
[31:43] you follow me whether they come in in a
[31:45] text
[31:46] no matter how they come in
[31:49] we're going to be putting a door we're
[31:50] going to be proactively looking at a a
[31:53] separation between us and Sodom in other
[31:56] words at our front door Sodom stops
[32:00] we're going to pray in our household
[32:01] we're going to have family meals
[32:03] together anybody ever heard of that
[32:05] we're going to have family devotions
[32:07] we're going to have preparation for
[32:09] church and all of those things Sodom
[32:11] stops at our door and if you don't do
[32:13] that Sodom will find a way in
[32:16] for sure thirdly we're going to find a
[32:19] place where preparations are made to
[32:22] leave this world now remember the first
[32:23] Exodus when the children of Israel were
[32:26] going out of Egypt for the first nine
[32:28] plagues it was pretty interesting I mean
[32:30] they went to church and they looked out
[32:31] over the waters there or look out over
[32:34] the land from Goshen and they saw water
[32:36] turn to blood cattle falling over flies
[32:40] right thick as thick as anything and
[32:44] they went home
[32:46] after church it went oh nobody fell
[32:48] asleep in those Services Brother Sam I
[32:50] mean that was exciting but the last
[32:53] plague was different the last plague was
[32:56] where Moses said now all of you
[32:58] including you in Goshen you go home now
[33:01] and apply the token in your house you've
[33:04] got to clean your house you've got to
[33:06] get dressed a certain way you got to
[33:07] prepare a meal a certain way because now
[33:10] we're going out of here
[33:11] so that was a time they took the message
[33:15] home
[33:16] and applied it at home is that all right
[33:18] I believe we're living in a similar time
[33:21] I believe it's no good not good enough
[33:23] for you to just go to church and say
[33:24] Amen or come to this and say amen and
[33:26] say thank you brother Barry you got to
[33:28] go home and apply this in your house
[33:32] because that's where preparations are
[33:34] made this is not just about brother
[33:35] Branham this is not just about uh you
[33:38] know church and what we do at church
[33:40] thank God for church and all of that but
[33:42] but this is about you going home and
[33:44] applying things and looking at your
[33:46] house and saying would the Holy Spirit
[33:48] approve this house as a place to visit
[33:50] and a place that's cleared for this
[33:53] family to go
[33:54] that's what you have to ask yourself and
[33:57] sometimes you just have to look at
[33:58] yourself in a an unbiased way in order
[34:01] to do that now
[34:03] today brother Branham said our great
[34:05] problem that we believe to be juvenile
[34:07] delinquency really is parent delinquency
[34:09] a home delinquency
[34:12] so look at it this way
[34:14] the generation of young people that we
[34:16] have today are not the problem they're a
[34:19] symptom
[34:22] are we okay
[34:25] our and here's why our people got away
[34:28] from the things they should have stayed
[34:30] with
[34:32] aha now I'll tell you what it's really
[34:35] really good to hear that before you get
[34:38] away from things you should stay with
[34:39] because it's really hard to get the
[34:41] genie back in the bottle
[34:44] once that Genie is out it's really hard
[34:47] to get that back in if you decide that
[34:49] you're going to have TV in the house
[34:50] just to watch the news
[34:52] it's going to be really hard for you to
[34:53] get that out
[34:55] if you're going to say we're going to
[34:56] stop attending church on Wednesday
[34:57] because we all have homework and we have
[34:59] an early uh schedule on Thursday
[35:01] mornings it's going to be really hard
[35:03] for you to get that back in again you're
[35:04] going to have a lot of whining and
[35:06] complaining if you ever decide to do
[35:07] that you know what you're better off not
[35:09] doing that in the first place
[35:11] I'm listen listen uh
[35:14] I'll leave town after this is over Okay
[35:16] so
[35:18] just let me let me say what I'm supposed
[35:20] to say here the church got lukewarm the
[35:23] children got out out into the world and
[35:25] anything talks about Hollywood here and
[35:27] he said Satan got one jump up by
[35:29] bringing it right in the house and
[35:31] that's Satan's way hey hey who knew
[35:34] Satan was actually planning
[35:37] Satan was looking at this generation and
[35:39] said you know what if they won't go to
[35:42] the movie theaters then you know what
[35:44] I'll bring it in at her house
[35:46] all right if they won't have it in their
[35:47] house I'll put it in their pocket
[35:51] ah so someone's looking at this
[35:54] situation here
[35:56] who knew
[35:58] and as a result our culture has become
[36:00] different
[36:02] our culture has become different our
[36:05] culture is influencing the world and how
[36:09] we do things
[36:11] and it's really important for us to
[36:12] recognize that and boys are different
[36:15] than girls and don't let anybody tell
[36:18] you don't let some social scientist tell
[36:20] you that they're not they are
[36:22] they absolutely are
[36:27] I remember one time years ago when my
[36:30] boys were
[36:31] um they were at the age where you could
[36:32] force them to go into a mall
[36:36] that is an age and that age does End by
[36:38] the way
[36:40] and we walked in we said you know while
[36:42] Mom was doing something we said hey
[36:43] let's go into a closed store here's a
[36:44] clothes store let's go in and I was
[36:46] looking around and saying where's
[36:47] where's the men's section where's the
[36:48] men and boys section and she said oh sir
[36:51] we don't have one it's all it's all
[36:53] clothes for anybody I said well answer
[36:55] this one question for me where's the
[36:57] door
[37:03] so there are a lot of things that are a
[37:05] lot of things that are changing but it's
[37:07] Satan's way of gradually getting in
[37:10] so brother Branham brother Branham found
[37:13] this
[37:14] brother banham found this in if you look
[37:16] in your notes there I'm on page four
[37:17] right in the middle recognizing your day
[37:19] in the past 75 years he said men has
[37:22] gone from a horse and buggy to an
[37:23] astronaut and he said why he turned away
[37:25] from his faith in God and turned it over
[37:27] his senses and his ability as a human
[37:29] being
[37:30] he quit trusting God
[37:34] he trusts himself
[37:35] in other words he trusts Google
[37:38] because that's where we get all of our
[37:39] information right when you want to know
[37:40] something else where you go right
[37:44] I do
[37:45] I mean unless there's something
[37:46] important
[37:47] if it's something really important I'll
[37:49] you know I'll study and search God if
[37:51] I'm if I'm stumped I'll call Sam
[37:55] and then he says now this is this is in
[37:58] the 60s here like this Infidel woman
[38:00] what's her name and it's Madeleine
[38:02] Murray O'Hare
[38:04] who was the woman single-handedly who
[38:07] decided that she did not want her child
[38:09] to hear prayer in the schools and
[38:12] single-handedly and she's an Infidel and
[38:15] an Infidel by definition is somebody
[38:16] when they die they have to put on their
[38:18] gravestone all dressed up and nowhere to
[38:20] go
[38:22] this Infidel woman what's her name in
[38:24] Washington
[38:26] they where they changed all this and
[38:29] Murray's Murray and somebody in the
[38:32] audience shouts it out
[38:34] she said as long as we've got an army
[38:36] and a Navy we don't need old Jehovah
[38:39] and he said I don't care what we've got
[38:40] it's Jehovah or nothing to me let the
[38:43] Army Navy sink as it will but Jehovah
[38:45] will remain forever Cal Thomas did an
[38:47] interview with her in 1970 and asked her
[38:50] why are so many people afraid of you and
[38:54] she said
[38:55] this was this was written by Cal Thomas
[38:58] I'll never forget her reply
[39:00] she said I'll tell you Mr Thomas why
[39:03] some Christians are afraid of me they're
[39:05] not sure that what they believe is
[39:08] really true
[39:09] and if they were sure I wouldn't be a
[39:12] threat to them at all
[39:15] you know what that is that's Believers
[39:17] doubting their weapon
[39:18] and brother Braham said you can't do
[39:20] that right you can't do that and so
[39:23] therefore you know this this is the
[39:25] culture this is the culture pushing back
[39:27] and for you that think that uh you know
[39:30] right-sided conservatives in our country
[39:32] were the majority and they were uh
[39:34] making an in making a difference now
[39:36] I've got news for you
[39:38] that's not the way that things are today
[39:41] and so therefore uh again now
[39:46] Brother Band says in influence he said
[39:48] Uzziah
[39:49] he said he loved the outdoors he was a
[39:51] herdsman he liked to see things grow and
[39:53] his mother was a daughter of Jerusalem
[39:55] they were a Believer and he said the boy
[39:57] had been raised with good influence and
[39:59] that's a good way to bring up a child in
[40:02] the way it should go
[40:03] so that is that is correct that is right
[40:06] and you know your children watch you and
[40:09] watch what you do and they copy after
[40:11] you because you're setting an example
[40:14] before them
[40:16] I mean I I remember when my boys were
[40:18] old enough to figure out they'd lean up
[40:20] from the back seat of the car and they'd
[40:21] say wow dad
[40:23] your the number on the speedometer is
[40:25] way higher than the number that's on the
[40:27] signs on the road wow
[40:30] shut up sit down
[40:38] so they did a poll among teenagers
[40:41] I mean the two most fearful words in the
[40:43] human language now are studies show
[40:45] right
[40:47] I mean there's all kinds of studies now
[40:48] I got some studies here that I want I
[40:50] want to show you but I'm very careful
[40:51] about that all right but they did a poll
[40:53] among teenagers and this was related to
[40:56] college and 91 of teenagers responded
[41:00] and said there are no moral absolutes
[41:03] so they they coined this phrase now
[41:06] called situational ethics
[41:08] that in the situation this could be
[41:10] right for you but it might not be right
[41:12] for you
[41:14] so whatever the city whatever your
[41:15] situation is I remember a girl telling
[41:17] my wife and I uh our boys were involved
[41:19] in a little 4-H club locally in our town
[41:21] when we were in Ohio and it was a horse
[41:23] club and we were involved in that for a
[41:26] couple of seasons and this girl was
[41:28] saying that uh or one of the parents was
[41:30] telling us that they had a girl in their
[41:32] school who uh she wanted to get pregnant
[41:35] and have a baby
[41:36] and uh we were like
[41:39] really
[41:40] you know not married
[41:42] and they said yeah because she had a
[41:45] hard life and she was abandoned by her
[41:46] family and she didn't have any siblings
[41:48] growing up so she wants to have a child
[41:50] in other words it's okay for her
[41:52] it might not be right but that doesn't
[41:54] matter in her case in that situation
[41:56] it's okay and that's called situational
[41:59] ethics
[42:00] well when you open the door to
[42:01] situational ethics really everyone what
[42:04] does does what's right in their own eyes
[42:06] right I mean that's that's the end
[42:08] result of that and you know what that
[42:10] brings right we we know where that's
[42:12] taking us
[42:13] 65 percent of kids said that Satan
[42:16] doesn't really exist he's only a symbol
[42:18] of evil that's all he's only a symbol of
[42:21] evil something you see in movies
[42:24] 61 percent agree if a person is
[42:26] generally good or does enough good
[42:28] things for others during their lifetime
[42:30] they will earn a place in heaven
[42:34] that's our kids today 50 and here's the
[42:37] scary one 50 percent of young people who
[42:40] claim to have an experience with God
[42:42] deny the Same by graduation
[42:46] you know why because there's an
[42:48] atmosphere in most colleges and
[42:50] unfortunately even good colleges and
[42:52] Christian colleges
[42:54] where they seek to influence or attempt
[42:57] to sway the beliefs of students coming
[43:00] in there
[43:01] and this is not this is not hidden this
[43:05] is not something that's unknown and and
[43:08] so therefore we're we're dealing with an
[43:11] atmosphere or a mindset or a world view
[43:14] if you like and some of you uh some of
[43:17] you guys are in college right and this
[43:19] is not a stretch for you guys I mean
[43:20] this is this is something I I was I was
[43:23] absolutely
[43:25] um
[43:25] appalled
[43:27] several years ago when one of my sons
[43:29] was in college and he was given an
[43:31] English essay to write and he brought
[43:33] home the topics that he could choose
[43:35] from
[43:36] I I mean I'm still not over it and that
[43:39] was 20 years ago maybe 15 years ago I'm
[43:42] still not over it the topics that
[43:44] professor gave him to write and
[43:47] I said we're paying for this
[43:51] and and he's asking you to write about
[43:53] subjects and one of them was killing a
[43:55] horse stomping a horse to death with
[43:57] your feet and the other ones I can't
[43:58] even repeat to you they were so horrible
[44:00] and he eventually wrote he came to me
[44:04] and he said Dad these are the choices I
[44:05] had to write an essay about and I I I
[44:09] said I I couldn't do that I I mean I
[44:11] just I couldn't do that
[44:13] and he was a freshman in in college and
[44:17] eventually he wrote an essay about why
[44:18] he couldn't write an essay about these
[44:20] essay topics
[44:22] and you know he's he's he got his
[44:24] Doctorate after all so it didn't it
[44:25] didn't influence him but he had to be
[44:27] willing to stand up he had to be willing
[44:29] to stand up and say that's nuts
[44:32] that's nuts
[44:34] and say it in a nice way because you
[44:36] don't want to have the professor say
[44:37] well huh
[44:39] all right so let's look at this this
[44:41] morning let's focus on four things here
[44:43] okay these are four fences of protective
[44:44] discipline things that you want to put
[44:46] around your kids and your family and
[44:48] let's talk about these okay just in a in
[44:51] a general and a quick way here
[44:55] number one
[44:57] you have to answer the question who
[44:59] holds your child's heart
[45:01] who is it in life that holds your
[45:03] child's heart is it their friends
[45:05] is it social media
[45:09] who holds your child's heart do your do
[45:11] the grandparents hold your child's heart
[45:13] and they're disrespectful to you
[45:16] I know a case where I know a case where
[45:19] the mother holds the child's heart the
[45:22] children's heart just tell them to hang
[45:24] on a sec we'll get it in a minute unless
[45:27] it's for me if you want me to get it
[45:30] she holds a child's heart
[45:35] and she has influenced her children away
[45:37] from the father
[45:40] and said well he's not strong enough
[45:42] he's not smart enough he doesn't have a
[45:44] degree he's done this he's not that he's
[45:46] done something else
[45:47] and now those children have become
[45:49] teenagers and those teenagers are
[45:52] rebelling because they've been taught to
[45:54] reject Authority and disrespect their
[45:55] parents right
[45:57] now she's finding out she can't handle
[45:59] them
[46:00] and she says to her husband well why
[46:02] don't you take care of this
[46:05] he's calling me to find out how he can
[46:07] handle it
[46:12] my answer is not a short answer
[46:15] because now we can't say all right apply
[46:18] a b and c here and it'll take care of
[46:19] the problem we're talking about a
[46:21] marriage issue first
[46:23] right and we're talking about a
[46:25] foundational issue of putting a
[46:27] protective fence around your kids here
[46:28] and who holds a child's heart you had to
[46:30] be very careful about your child's heart
[46:32] and and what influences they are
[46:35] enamored with
[46:36] then of course the media is an issue we
[46:40] all have to deal with right and I'm
[46:41] going to deal with that uh in in our in
[46:44] our second part here uh about who
[46:46] captures your child's imagination and
[46:48] what it is that really draws them who
[46:51] controls their desires or what controls
[46:53] uh their desires in life and who sets
[46:56] the course who sets the course in life
[46:58] now it's really interesting that Solomon
[47:01] I mean they must have had the internet
[47:02] back in that day because he's he has a
[47:04] really interesting scripture here that's
[47:07] not very often talked about
[47:10] the drawing is of
[47:13] anybody know recognize this drawing of
[47:15] this artwork
[47:16] Narcissus
[47:18] narcissus is from where we get our term
[47:21] narcissistic okay and somebody if
[47:24] somebody's a narcissist they're very
[47:25] focused on themselves very enamored with
[47:28] themselves they kind of don't know that
[47:30] anybody else is in the room at all
[47:32] so they'll look at things in a very
[47:34] narcissistic way narcissist narcissus
[47:36] was a fictional character who one day
[47:40] looked at his reflection in the pool and
[47:43] he got so enamored with his face and his
[47:46] reflection because mirrors weren't a big
[47:49] deal back then that he just kept looking
[47:51] at this image until he died
[47:54] okay that's the mythological character
[47:57] Narcissus
[47:58] and so he looked at this true reflection
[48:01] of himself and became really caught he
[48:03] fell in love with an image of himself
[48:05] okay
[48:07] so I put that up there because the
[48:10] Proverbs says as in water face answer at
[48:14] the face so the heart of man the man
[48:16] so in other words in a real way when you
[48:19] look in a mirror or a pool
[48:22] and you see a reflection you're getting
[48:24] you're getting what's really there
[48:27] right you're getting a true reflection
[48:29] of what's there
[48:31] it's not it doesn't change
[48:33] it's it's a it's a real reflection of
[48:36] what's looking into the mirror is what's
[48:39] coming back
[48:41] Solomon says in the same way that when a
[48:44] person looks in a mirror
[48:46] and sees their true reflection
[48:50] so I can tell you what's in the heart of
[48:54] your child
[48:56] by the people they hang around with
[49:00] that's what the Hebrew language is
[49:02] telling us here
[49:04] if I want to know what's really going in
[49:06] my child's heart tell me what it is
[49:08] they're in love with tell me what it is
[49:10] they're fascinated with let me let me
[49:13] look and see who they hang around with
[49:14] who do they want to be with do they want
[49:16] to be with church kids do they want to
[49:17] be with some boy in school do they want
[49:20] to hang around or listen to you know
[49:22] hard music all the time tell me what's
[49:25] in their heart I can tell what's in
[49:26] their heart
[49:27] by who they're associating with
[49:31] and sometimes we have to face the fact
[49:33] that even our children are not a good
[49:35] influence on other children
[49:40] and this is what Solomon is kind of
[49:41] striking Us in the face with is that
[49:44] what what what we're looking at what
[49:47] we're involved with who we associate
[49:49] with is a true reflection of something
[49:51] that's on the inside
[49:54] as in water face answers to face so the
[49:56] heart of man to man
[49:58] you put somebody together and allow them
[50:01] to hang around with somebody
[50:03] that's reflecting something that's going
[50:05] on in that child's heart
[50:07] so that's why we have to we had to be
[50:09] very careful be very observant
[50:11] and brother Brown said your life will
[50:13] impress your children and influence your
[50:15] children by the example you set and I
[50:17] think it's a good thing that we put
[50:18] every effort we can before our children
[50:20] as Godly Parents to make an example and
[50:24] to be an example
[50:28] again
[50:30] be certain of God
[50:32] I want to thank this radio station
[50:36] which is broadcasting this service
[50:39] I sure would love to be close to where
[50:41] this radio station was
[50:44] I believe that the influence that music
[50:46] puts upon our children it would pay
[50:48] every Christian throughout radioland
[50:51] that this radio reaches to keep their
[50:54] radios tuned to such a station as this
[50:56] tonight
[50:57] because it brings the right kind of
[50:59] influence through music and through
[51:02] preaching of the word to our children
[51:05] it actually sets them in a better
[51:07] environment wow
[51:09] here's brother Brandon promoting social
[51:11] media
[51:16] there's two things we learned from this
[51:18] when you find a good source latch onto
[51:21] it
[51:23] but if it can be an influence for good
[51:25] put the wrong thing on the waves now it
[51:29] becomes an
[51:30] influence for evil things
[51:34] because we're dealing with the tree of
[51:35] knowledge of Good and Evil right and
[51:37] brother Ram's remarking this hey they're
[51:39] actually broadcasting they're streaming
[51:41] this is this is early prehistoric
[51:43] streaming
[51:45] because they got a radial reception unit
[51:48] there and they're streaming this through
[51:50] the radio waves who cares right it's
[51:52] getting out there and he's acknowledging
[51:54] that hey this is a good influence mark
[51:57] this
[51:57] is something wow too bad we don't live
[52:00] closer to here this is a good thing
[52:02] and so if it can become an influence for
[52:04] good remember it can become an influence
[52:06] for not so good
[52:09] and and you've got to pay attention to
[52:11] that you've got to be proactive because
[52:13] your kids are not automatically going to
[52:16] gravitate towards the good things
[52:18] as parents you've been around longer you
[52:21] have seen more and you've seen the
[52:23] influence of these things on people's
[52:25] lives and so therefore Brother Bear I'm
[52:27] saying man I'd like to have I'd like to
[52:29] be aware of this radio station actually
[52:30] broadcast because this this hey this is
[52:33] the kind of thing you can turn on leave
[52:35] on and help create a good atmosphere in
[52:37] your house it's got some good stuff on
[52:39] here
[52:40] everybody okay
[52:46] so they asked president this question
[52:48] and it's a great question
[52:50] he said what activity should our
[52:52] pre-teen children participate in
[52:54] we all know the answer to that right
[52:56] Instagram
[52:58] how should we go about helping them
[53:01] select their Associates wow people back
[53:04] in that day had questions about this
[53:05] stuff too
[53:08] one activities should our children
[53:10] participate in all right now let's look
[53:12] at his answer his answer is great
[53:15] he said
[53:17] keep them in Christian company
[53:20] as long as you possibly can
[53:25] if it's a girl keep her with Christian
[53:27] girls Christian boys vice versa
[53:31] if she's old enough to go with a boy
[53:35] see that she keeps with the right kind
[53:37] of boy
[53:39] and discourage her to any boy otherwise
[53:43] or boy to a girl
[53:45] discourage that
[53:47] as children get older once they get past
[53:49] 10 and 12 you can't use physical
[53:53] discipline really effectively after
[53:55] around that age
[53:57] because you Foster a spirit of rebellion
[54:00] in children after roughly after that age
[54:03] are you say are you without resources
[54:05] after that age absolutely not
[54:07] because what I want to what I want to do
[54:09] before they get to age 10 or 12 is begin
[54:12] to develop a relationship with them so
[54:14] when we lose the ability to do any kind
[54:16] of physical
[54:17] corporal punishment to them my
[54:20] relationship is going to help me in the
[54:22] times when I can't touch them
[54:25] hey I don't pick on my boys now if
[54:27] they'll beat the pulp out of me
[54:32] but I have a relationship
[54:34] and I lean on that relationship a lot
[54:38] and and there are times when I can you
[54:41] know they can be all Brave and mouthy
[54:42] and when they get in a group but I'll
[54:44] pull them aside one-on-one and I say hey
[54:45] really what's going on tell me what's
[54:47] happening here you know what you said
[54:49] was not right and when I get them
[54:50] one-on-one that's a different story and
[54:52] in most cases that's going to save you
[54:54] more than trying to physically
[54:56] discipline them in an age when that's
[54:58] not appropriate
[55:00] I also tell them I hold a checkbook in
[55:01] the car keys so
[55:04] deal with it
[55:06] but brother Branham is saying here that
[55:08] you need to be involved here so I asked
[55:10] George and Rebecca years ago and uh
[55:13] about some things that happened in
[55:15] brother Graham's household and I wanted
[55:16] to know things that brother Branham told
[55:19] his daughters for instance about uh the
[55:22] courtship years and and how did they
[55:24] react to boys coming around because
[55:26] brother Ram's family was obviously well
[55:27] known popular and I wanted to know what
[55:30] did Brother man tell you as girls single
[55:32] girls about how to deal with uh you know
[55:36] uh those years and and and they told me
[55:39] a story one time a brother Branham was
[55:42] in this is not on tape all right but
[55:43] brother Branham uh was was out of his
[55:47] household and when he came back he saw
[55:50] Rebecca and a school friend out in the
[55:52] backyard playing volleyball with two
[55:55] boys
[55:56] and they were just going back and forth
[55:58] over that message volleyball I mean
[56:00] that's that's the safest thing in the
[56:01] world
[56:02] and
[56:05] ironically at the same time Rebecca was
[56:09] talking with George she kind of had
[56:12] Orion George and George had his eye on
[56:13] her and George had talked to brother
[56:15] Branham about that so they were kind of
[56:17] sort of semi-officially kind of going
[56:21] together
[56:22] okay
[56:23] and brother Mann comes back and he looks
[56:25] at he looks out the back door and he
[56:27] sees the four of them out there kind of
[56:29] like two couples playing message
[56:30] volleyball he calls Rebecca in
[56:33] and he says Rebecca what what's what's
[56:34] going on and she tells him and he says
[56:37] well what do you what would you think if
[56:38] the neighbors looked over and said hey
[56:40] you're you're kind of associating with
[56:42] George and now these boys are over here
[56:44] she he said he said that wouldn't look
[56:46] so good would it and she said not and he
[56:48] said send the rest of them home
[56:53] send them home
[56:55] brother man goes on to say if she's
[56:58] going with an unbeliever try to
[57:00] encourage her to go with a Believer and
[57:02] vice versa
[57:04] make your internet powerful enough for
[57:08] everybody to get on at the same time
[57:12] increase your bandwidth
[57:15] that's not what he says
[57:18] make your home nice
[57:20] make your home a place
[57:22] where your daughter or son will not be
[57:25] ashamed to bring their company before
[57:27] their father and mother and into their
[57:29] house and make home so happy that
[57:32] they'll be pleased in their home to stay
[57:34] there
[57:37] the first line of defense
[57:41] for what activity should our
[57:43] pre-children preteen children be
[57:45] involved in is in your home
[57:47] you got to make your home a certain way
[57:50] you've got a uh you've got to get
[57:53] involved in this uh whole process of
[57:56] making your home a place that people
[57:57] they like to come to
[57:59] and if you've got daughters and you want
[58:01] to have the boys come to the house so
[58:02] you can keep your eye on them you know a
[58:03] pack of boys it's food food is always
[58:05] the key right
[58:07] all you need to do is just open it up
[58:09] and you know they're there they're right
[58:11] there
[58:13] this is not brain science brain surgery
[58:15] science folks
[58:19] all right
[58:25] let's take a break
[58:27] and we're going to take a break before
[58:28] we get into this because this is I think
[58:32] really important
[58:33] on social media and I wish I had this in
[58:37] your notes it's going to be on the the
[58:38] thing here but
[58:40] can we do five minutes just stretch more
[58:42] coffee
[58:43] okay five minutes
[59:14] let's do this
[59:17] we good
[59:37] three testing one two three
[59:41] all right so if you want to make your
[59:42] way back let's let's look at this
[59:51] let's tackle this subject
[59:56] obviously I cannot
[1:00:00] and will not be able to tackle all of
[1:00:02] this subject here
[1:00:04] but it is a real big part
[1:00:07] of your kids lives
[1:00:11] so we want to deal with this subject on
[1:00:13] social media just as a
[1:00:16] portion of our study here you don't have
[1:00:18] any of this in your notes
[1:00:21] so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
[1:00:23] email this
[1:00:25] these three PowerPoints to
[1:00:28] brother Samuel brother Nathaniel brother
[1:00:31] Trevor and uh so you you you guys can
[1:00:36] nothing is copyrighted
[1:00:39] so you can
[1:00:40] spread these around if you want if you
[1:00:42] if pastors want to do that okay and if
[1:00:45] you're if you're here you know and
[1:00:47] you're that's not one of your pastors I
[1:00:50] might be glad to email that or see bro
[1:00:52] Sam be welcome to do that
[1:00:56] okay
[1:01:03] this is an interesting
[1:01:06] phenomena because
[1:01:08] number one thank you number one brother
[1:01:11] Brandon said nothing about this because
[1:01:13] this didn't exist in his day
[1:01:15] and number two
[1:01:18] none of us got a chance to vote on this
[1:01:22] whether we're our lives are all going to
[1:01:24] be dominated by the internet
[1:01:25] I never got a chance to vote
[1:01:28] if I had a vote
[1:01:29] I would vote against it being such a
[1:01:32] overwhelming influence in the world
[1:01:34] today
[1:01:36] and so what I'm gonna I'm gonna read you
[1:01:38] some things here and I want you to
[1:01:40] follow me as best you can and I've I've
[1:01:42] edited this and edited this but I have
[1:01:44] put the links for all of it on the
[1:01:46] bottom here
[1:01:48] so you can look this up and you can look
[1:01:50] at the whole article and I've edited it
[1:01:52] because I don't want to read you to
[1:01:53] death
[1:01:54] so
[1:01:56] some of these statistics here
[1:01:59] are changed because if this was written
[1:02:02] a month or two ago
[1:02:04] it's all different now the numbers are
[1:02:06] different it's incredible
[1:02:08] how exponentially fast these numbers
[1:02:11] grow it's incredible
[1:02:15] now I have a son who is a data scientist
[1:02:17] he works with big data with a big
[1:02:21] company in a big city and
[1:02:24] he's a he's an expert he has a degree in
[1:02:28] this Advanced field of study because
[1:02:31] there's so much data now that's
[1:02:33] generated in a given day
[1:02:36] I will tell you
[1:02:38] that one-third
[1:02:41] of the world's population one-third of
[1:02:44] the world's population
[1:02:46] is on Instagram
[1:02:48] every day
[1:02:51] one third of the world's population
[1:02:54] what I'm going to focus on primarily
[1:02:57] here
[1:02:57] is the influence that Instagram
[1:03:00] specifically has on girls
[1:03:04] so this is not
[1:03:06] brother Barry's thoughts
[1:03:09] what I'm giving you here is
[1:03:10] evidence-based in other words this is
[1:03:13] stuff that I've tracked down and talking
[1:03:15] to my sons my sons are one of them's an
[1:03:19] engineer one of them's uh
[1:03:20] as a doctorate in in he works with one
[1:03:24] of the leading uh firms in in out of
[1:03:28] Washington that does intervention for
[1:03:32] um look you don't have enough time
[1:03:36] here is job description because it takes
[1:03:38] me a while to even come up with all the
[1:03:40] words but intervention in terms of
[1:03:42] computer and cyber issues in the world
[1:03:45] and Nations that are attacked in in a in
[1:03:49] a
[1:03:50] digital way and all the rest of it and I
[1:03:53] have another one that's involved in
[1:03:54] finance and marketing and another one
[1:03:56] who's Big Data and you know so these
[1:03:58] guys we talk about this when I and I I
[1:04:01] know where to go I'm not I'm not a great
[1:04:03] researcher but they are and I know where
[1:04:05] to go to find information and analysis
[1:04:08] and statistics that I can trust as a
[1:04:11] matter of fact one of my sons was in a
[1:04:13] meeting with uh Bill Gates who was the
[1:04:15] former not Bill Gates Bill
[1:04:17] um
[1:04:18] the guy who's the former Defense
[1:04:19] secretary and uh he was in a meeting
[1:04:22] small meeting of 15 people in in a
[1:04:25] meeting with the Secretary of Defense a
[1:04:26] couple years ago and he texted me and he
[1:04:28] said Hey Dad I'm in the room with this
[1:04:30] with this guy got any questions
[1:04:34] yeah hello
[1:04:36] and uh he I asked him a question about
[1:04:39] Israel and he said hang on he said
[1:04:40] someone in the room is asking that
[1:04:42] question right now hang on so he texted
[1:04:44] me the answers here now no I'm not
[1:04:46] allowed to tell you what he told me but
[1:04:47] uh
[1:04:50] so all I'm saying to you is that I get I
[1:04:53] get this information very carefully but
[1:04:56] I want to be evidence-based here social
[1:04:58] media and we're going to reduce this to
[1:04:59] SM okay is a big part of many teens
[1:05:02] lives 2018 Pew Research Center uh did a
[1:05:06] survey of 13 to 17 year olds and found
[1:05:09] that 40 percent are online almost
[1:05:12] constantly
[1:05:14] and 97 percent
[1:05:17] of 13 to 17 year olds 97 so we can
[1:05:22] pretty much say that's just about all of
[1:05:24] them
[1:05:26] use a social media platform
[1:05:29] such as YouTube Facebook Instagram
[1:05:30] Snapchat and so forth but what impact so
[1:05:34] now scientists and social scientists and
[1:05:37] educators are coming up with data that
[1:05:41] suggests there is an effect of all of
[1:05:44] this internet usage all of it is not
[1:05:47] negative all of it is not necessarily
[1:05:50] bad but there is an effect and that's
[1:05:52] what's important now you got to think
[1:05:54] about this you think about this in terms
[1:05:56] of your family your daughter and what
[1:06:00] what this could do and then you got to
[1:06:02] think about well what should I do about
[1:06:04] this problem and I'm going to give you
[1:06:06] four points that you can consider four
[1:06:09] or five points you can consider and it's
[1:06:11] a very simplistic response to this but
[1:06:13] social media can use can negatively
[1:06:17] affect teens
[1:06:18] distracting them disrupting their sleep
[1:06:21] exposing them to bullying rumor
[1:06:23] spreading unrealistic views of other
[1:06:25] people's lives
[1:06:29] I said unrealistic views of other
[1:06:32] people's lives
[1:06:35] comparison is the mother of jealousy
[1:06:39] oh honey we had a lovely vacation this
[1:06:41] year we were on the shores of Lake Erie
[1:06:43] and it was just wonderful that little
[1:06:45] that little tent that we had I mean it
[1:06:47] was just and having a fire oh it was so
[1:06:50] nice and it was just nice to have the
[1:06:51] kids around us and so forth until they
[1:06:53] get home and look on Facebook and look
[1:06:55] at you mean the Browns had a vacation in
[1:06:57] Hawaii this year and we went on a dumpy
[1:07:00] little tent out by the lake and froze
[1:07:02] our feet off huh thanks a lot
[1:07:07] it was okay until we saw the comparison
[1:07:10] right
[1:07:13] so when a girl portrays herself as being
[1:07:15] popular lots of boys around
[1:07:19] and a young girl looks at that 13 years
[1:07:21] old and says wow I'm missing out
[1:07:25] duh I need to dress like this
[1:07:28] in order to have pictures like that
[1:07:31] now
[1:07:33] it's not like only a few of them are on
[1:07:35] there
[1:07:37] 97 percent
[1:07:39] are on there
[1:07:41] a 2019 study of more than 6 500 12 to 15
[1:07:46] year olds in the U.S found that those
[1:07:48] who spent more more than three hours a
[1:07:51] day using social media might be at a
[1:07:53] heightened risk for mental health
[1:07:55] problems
[1:07:56] and studies also observe links between
[1:07:59] high levels of social media use and
[1:08:01] depression and anxiety symptoms
[1:08:03] greater social media use nighttime
[1:08:06] social media use and emotional
[1:08:09] investment in social media
[1:08:12] such as feeling upset when prevented
[1:08:15] from logging on
[1:08:18] you mean we can't have our phones on in
[1:08:19] church
[1:08:23] were each linked with worse Sleep
[1:08:26] Quality and higher levels of anxiety and
[1:08:28] depression
[1:08:30] wow
[1:08:32] that's interesting
[1:08:38] how teens use social media also might
[1:08:42] determine its impact
[1:08:45] social comparison and feedback seeking
[1:08:48] by teens using social media and cell
[1:08:51] phones was linked with depression
[1:08:54] I did recently I did a series in our
[1:08:57] church and it was called living above
[1:08:58] your cares and uh I think that was the
[1:09:01] name of it and it's four or five
[1:09:03] Services it's called living above your
[1:09:05] cares it was about the subject of
[1:09:07] anxiety
[1:09:08] and I was shocked because I was thinking
[1:09:11] I was telling bro Sam I was thinking
[1:09:13] well you know this might be good in a
[1:09:15] general sense you know to have and then
[1:09:17] I I could not believe the response that
[1:09:20] I got internationally
[1:09:22] from people around the world who were
[1:09:24] listening to this and I was talking
[1:09:25] specifically about anxiety and the
[1:09:27] pressures associated with that and the
[1:09:29] feelings people have associated with
[1:09:30] that and I was amazed but I'll tell you
[1:09:33] what else I was amazed at
[1:09:35] 95 percent of the people who wrote to me
[1:09:38] and either wanted more help or were
[1:09:41] greatly helped by the series were men
[1:09:46] and not young men
[1:09:48] middle aged men
[1:09:49] I was shocked I had no idea that people
[1:09:52] uh that that brothers were feeling this
[1:09:55] way and I had an altar call one day in
[1:09:57] my church at the end of this little
[1:09:59] series I had an altar call and there was
[1:10:01] one woman came up and the rest were all
[1:10:03] men
[1:10:06] I I was just I was amazed at that how
[1:10:08] big of a problem this actually is and in
[1:10:12] addition older adolescents who use
[1:10:14] social media passively what's this older
[1:10:17] adolescents who use social media
[1:10:19] passively so this would be above 17.
[1:10:22] just viewing other people's photos
[1:10:25] reported declines in life satisfaction
[1:10:29] so just by scrolling through and looking
[1:10:31] at people's pictures
[1:10:33] ruin their day
[1:10:36] this had the effect of saying well I'm
[1:10:38] really missing out I don't get to travel
[1:10:41] Now isn't it true though
[1:10:45] that
[1:10:46] you kind of put your best pictures up
[1:10:49] there
[1:10:49] I mean
[1:10:51] is isn't that true
[1:10:54] so you don't you don't say this
[1:10:57] honey you look terrible today you're
[1:10:58] you're absolutely you look like you just
[1:11:01] got out of bed you know you don't say
[1:11:02] hey let's get it let's get a selfie here
[1:11:04] while we're arguing like them
[1:11:08] that's not what we
[1:11:14] we're looking at my kids my goodness you
[1:11:16] look like you're just home from the
[1:11:17] orphanage here and go you need to get a
[1:11:20] shower you smell bad by the way stop
[1:11:22] let's get a picture of that
[1:11:28] sometimes and I I did this this week to
[1:11:31] a young lady I said you do realize that
[1:11:34] everybody's lives are not perfect right
[1:11:37] because she's responding to me about how
[1:11:40] she's looking at this on social media
[1:11:42] and looking at these kids with you know
[1:11:44] babies and oh how how great life is I
[1:11:47] said they are putting selected images up
[1:11:51] there right
[1:11:53] but yet the science tells us that even
[1:11:57] older adolescents who you would think
[1:11:59] would know better
[1:12:01] they're being affected by just scrolling
[1:12:04] and looking at pictures
[1:12:05] studies of undergraduate college
[1:12:07] students showed that the longer they use
[1:12:10] Facebook the stronger was their belief
[1:12:12] that their that others were happier than
[1:12:14] they were
[1:12:15] and because of teens impulse Natures
[1:12:18] impulsive Natures experts suggest that
[1:12:23] teens who post contact on social media
[1:12:26] are at risk of sharing intimate photos
[1:12:28] or highly personal stories and this can
[1:12:32] result in teens being bullied harassed
[1:12:34] even blackmailed
[1:12:36] because they often create posts without
[1:12:38] considering consequences or privacy
[1:12:41] concerns
[1:12:44] and you know what they'll say when you
[1:12:46] say something they'll say hey I got this
[1:12:47] you don't understand
[1:12:49] right
[1:12:52] I had a I have I was presented with the
[1:12:54] situation a little while back where
[1:12:57] um
[1:12:58] there was a a situation where two kids
[1:13:01] and now in school the kids had to have a
[1:13:05] phone or a device in order to
[1:13:07] communicate with the teacher in order to
[1:13:08] get lessons
[1:13:10] this is a small country School
[1:13:13] but every kid had to have a device that
[1:13:15] was connected on a network to be able to
[1:13:17] interact with their classmates and with
[1:13:19] the teacher otherwise you didn't get any
[1:13:21] curriculum you didn't get any any
[1:13:22] assignments you didn't get any results
[1:13:24] of your I mean it was all done based on
[1:13:26] the phone so give the kids two or three
[1:13:29] seconds and they figured out a way to
[1:13:31] communicate with one another and do all
[1:13:32] kinds of things right maybe two or three
[1:13:34] seconds sometimes less
[1:13:36] and and they're they're communicating
[1:13:38] back and forth and this one girl started
[1:13:41] to stalk this boy in my church
[1:13:44] and I mean this was a problem
[1:13:48] and I listened to that situation the
[1:13:50] parents told me about it and I said I
[1:13:52] will guarantee you that girl little
[1:13:55] girl's been abused
[1:13:56] and they were saying well this has never
[1:13:58] been said and I said I'll guarantee you
[1:14:00] that little girl's been abused and and
[1:14:02] she was wanting to confide in this boy
[1:14:05] and and so forth neither one of them
[1:14:07] were older than 12 years old
[1:14:10] and I said you gotta you can't you gotta
[1:14:12] go cold turkey with this I said you
[1:14:14] cannot say we'll just be friends and
[1:14:16] we're going to continue to I said you've
[1:14:18] got to cut that off
[1:14:19] and just last week the mother wrote me
[1:14:22] and said you know what it just came out
[1:14:23] that that girl was abused by her uncle
[1:14:25] when she was like seven or eight years
[1:14:27] old and she's looking for an audience
[1:14:30] and she's finding that audience in this
[1:14:31] other little boy in her class and hey
[1:14:34] he's dealing with with something very
[1:14:36] complex here right he's she's telling
[1:14:39] him some things that need to be reported
[1:14:40] to her parents and the pastor and the
[1:14:42] and the authorities right
[1:14:45] but kids are going this way they're not
[1:14:47] going this way they're going this way
[1:14:48] because that's what you do now you go
[1:14:50] this way
[1:14:51] everybody understand all right so let's
[1:14:54] look very quickly at some things that we
[1:14:56] could do with our kids number one
[1:14:57] protecting our teens you need to set
[1:14:59] some boundaries or limits
[1:15:03] kick scratch bite resist yell scream
[1:15:07] Panic your kids still need to have some
[1:15:09] boundaries
[1:15:12] and you need to talk to them about how
[1:15:15] to avoid letting social media dominate
[1:15:18] their lives and interfere with things
[1:15:20] like sleep School meals Etc and
[1:15:23] encourage a bedtime routine and I think
[1:15:25] this is important that avoids
[1:15:28] social media Electronic media and keep
[1:15:31] cell phones and tablets out of their
[1:15:33] bedrooms good luck
[1:15:36] but I think that's a good piece of
[1:15:38] advice because they don't need to sleep
[1:15:40] with their phone
[1:15:44] you can monitor your teen's accounts you
[1:15:47] to me you have to make a very tough
[1:15:50] decision about whether or when your kids
[1:15:53] are going to have a phone
[1:15:55] I get it and I'm not saying that you
[1:15:57] shouldn't have it because it's here it's
[1:15:59] like tubeless tires
[1:16:01] it's here and you're not gonna you're
[1:16:03] not gonna pray it away let's be
[1:16:05] realistic but you're going to have to be
[1:16:07] proactive to get on top of it as best
[1:16:09] you can now I will tell you as best you
[1:16:11] can you're still behind the eight ball
[1:16:14] because no matter how much you know and
[1:16:17] I don't don't think I'm being critical
[1:16:18] of you but no matter how much you know
[1:16:20] your kids know more than you do
[1:16:24] no matter how much you think you know
[1:16:26] about monitoring your kids phone
[1:16:28] activity or online activity
[1:16:30] your kids are way ahead of you they're
[1:16:33] moving at the speed of Youth and all
[1:16:35] they need to do is meet one kid on the
[1:16:37] playground who will update them on how
[1:16:39] to get around everything you put in
[1:16:40] place
[1:16:41] I'm just telling you that you might not
[1:16:43] believe me but it's true anyway
[1:16:46] but you need to let your team know that
[1:16:48] you'll be regularly checking their
[1:16:50] social media accounts on their phone and
[1:16:52] you should follow through with that and
[1:16:54] do it
[1:16:55] some of you are laughing sound no
[1:16:57] brother Barry my kids I'll tell you what
[1:16:58] your kids are your kids and uh you'd be
[1:17:02] surprised
[1:17:03] you'd be surprised
[1:17:06] explain what's not okay to your kids
[1:17:10] you need to explain what's not okay this
[1:17:13] these are the boundaries here that
[1:17:15] you're going to discourage your teen
[1:17:16] from gossiping spreading rumors bullying
[1:17:18] damaging someone's reputation online or
[1:17:20] otherwise and talk to your teen about
[1:17:22] what's appropriate and safe
[1:17:25] and give them examples
[1:17:27] and show them this is what's okay and
[1:17:29] this is what's not okay
[1:17:31] you should encourage the old-fashioned
[1:17:35] way of talking to someone in person
[1:17:37] remember that
[1:17:39] you guys are laughing you ever done it
[1:17:44] especially if your kid is vulnerable to
[1:17:47] social anxiety disorder meaning that oh
[1:17:50] I couldn't say anything face to face I
[1:17:51] could you know the number one phobia in
[1:17:53] the world the number one phobia there
[1:17:55] are all kinds of them
[1:17:56] spiders falling off Heights right there
[1:18:00] are all kinds of them
[1:18:02] then you know what the number one is
[1:18:04] public speaking having to stand in front
[1:18:08] of a more than one person and say
[1:18:11] something I was out of the room when
[1:18:13] they gave out that one
[1:18:15] but
[1:18:16] that is the number one phobia so you
[1:18:19] know what you want to do you want to
[1:18:21] encourage that in the right way
[1:18:26] I say it this way
[1:18:29] you want to disregard your children's
[1:18:32] fad
[1:18:34] and lean towards the bent
[1:18:37] do you know what that means
[1:18:39] you're the first person I've ever seen
[1:18:40] in the congregation say that
[1:18:42] all right a fad is something your kids
[1:18:45] get into because everybody's into it you
[1:18:46] know what it's the thing that excites
[1:18:48] them right now and Grandma comes along
[1:18:49] and finances that and you know we're all
[1:18:50] my my kids it was baseball cards right
[1:18:53] they got into baseball cards and here
[1:18:55] comes grandma with the checkbook sure
[1:18:56] let's buy whatever you want they have
[1:18:58] you know five thousand dollars worth of
[1:19:00] baseball cards and so forth and then a
[1:19:02] month later where are the baseball cards
[1:19:04] oh they're gone I sold them for 50 cents
[1:19:06] to someone in school that's a fan
[1:19:10] don't worry about The Fad don't Finance
[1:19:12] fads they're gonna be they're here
[1:19:14] they're gone right watch for the bent
[1:19:17] your child has a bent a bent is that
[1:19:20] innate ability or Talent OR gift that
[1:19:23] God gives them that is going to lean
[1:19:26] them a certain way and it's identifiable
[1:19:27] even at a young age I wish I had the
[1:19:29] picture but I do have a picture my wife
[1:19:32] took it of one of my boys who was in the
[1:19:34] crib in a one-piece sleeper okay so
[1:19:37] we're talking that age
[1:19:38] with tools and vacuum hoses in the crib
[1:19:42] with them he didn't want teddy bears he
[1:19:44] wanted tools and vacuum parts in his bed
[1:19:47] and then he would he'd go right off to
[1:19:49] sleep because he was comfortable with
[1:19:51] tools you know what he is he's an
[1:19:52] engineer
[1:19:54] and now he's an engineer he always said
[1:19:56] Dad I want to drive a tractor like from
[1:19:58] five or six I want to drive a tractor I
[1:20:01] said we should have called you John
[1:20:02] instead of Peter
[1:20:04] John Deere and
[1:20:07] he said I just want to drive a tractor
[1:20:09] and and I said Pete you you you're
[1:20:12] you're smart you could be more than that
[1:20:13] you could be a an engineer I don't want
[1:20:15] to be an engineer working an office I
[1:20:17] want to I want to drive the tractor
[1:20:19] I just want to be on a tractor somewhere
[1:20:22] and so one summer and I we I believe
[1:20:25] very strongly in mentorship you know and
[1:20:27] putting the kids involved in something
[1:20:28] to see if they want to do it for the
[1:20:29] rest of their life and I said tell you
[1:20:31] what we're going to do we're going to
[1:20:32] give you a job get you a job this year
[1:20:34] on a crew that lays water lines for
[1:20:36] upcoming housing projects
[1:20:38] and they they do you know buckets and
[1:20:40] and dozers and everything else and so we
[1:20:43] got him a job and he's working at this
[1:20:45] job with a bunch of guys shows up every
[1:20:47] day and I went there every day I made
[1:20:49] him his lunch
[1:20:50] and I brought him lunch every day
[1:20:53] and you know the guys on the crew were
[1:20:55] hey Mr Coffee how you doing you know and
[1:20:58] and you bring more than one lunch you
[1:21:00] know we look at Peter eating his lunch
[1:21:02] every day you know and uh so you know
[1:21:05] this this was a daily routine and one
[1:21:08] day Pete comes home and he says to me
[1:21:10] hey Dad I'm the only one in the crew
[1:21:12] who's not a felon
[1:21:14] laughs
[1:21:17] really
[1:21:21] oh yeah great
[1:21:26] I said well I gotta ask this question
[1:21:28] how do you fit in he said well I told
[1:21:30] him I got a speeding ticket one time
[1:21:33] and they're like all right Pete that's
[1:21:34] good enough you're one of us
[1:21:39] really
[1:21:40] at the end of summer though you know
[1:21:42] what he said man that was great he said
[1:21:44] I was on the Digger the whole time and
[1:21:46] he said it was great but he said I think
[1:21:48] I'll go to school
[1:21:52] and he became he's now a master engineer
[1:21:54] and uh signs the documents himself he's
[1:21:57] in management at Duke power and uh you
[1:22:01] know he's just a very successful guy but
[1:22:03] that's that's his bent in other words I
[1:22:06] didn't put that love for that in him
[1:22:08] that's his bent we'd go to a grad
[1:22:11] station uh gas station and when we when
[1:22:14] these guys were little and that we'd
[1:22:16] pull up and Pete would say I'll put the
[1:22:18] gas in
[1:22:19] Pete's out there and he's got the nozzle
[1:22:21] in he's changing the oil he's lifting
[1:22:23] the van pushing rotating tires that's
[1:22:26] what juicy he loves to do right that's
[1:22:27] his way I got to hold him back from
[1:22:29] doing major mechanical renovation on the
[1:22:31] van just because we're getting gas right
[1:22:33] that's that's his way and Andrew says
[1:22:36] Andrew says Hey Dad I'll pay
[1:22:38] so I give him the I give him the cash he
[1:22:40] goes in the gas station he comes out hey
[1:22:42] Dad there's a guy in there who has
[1:22:44] horses and he lives down the way and
[1:22:46] he's got a horse farm and he's got three
[1:22:48] or four kids and he invited us to come
[1:22:49] down I told him we probably could be all
[1:22:51] right he said we'll go down there and
[1:22:54] I realized Andrew look we're just
[1:22:55] getting gas
[1:22:57] you just you were supposed to just pay
[1:22:59] for gas but you know what he is he's a
[1:23:01] people person right
[1:23:03] he's a people guy
[1:23:05] and he just he just knows how to he's he
[1:23:07] had no knew no strangers he'd go up to
[1:23:09] anybody
[1:23:10] I mean when he was in high school he
[1:23:12] took judges our district judges out to
[1:23:16] lunch to learn what it was like to be a
[1:23:17] lawyer
[1:23:20] and and that's that's just because I
[1:23:22] believe in mentorship and he'd he was
[1:23:24] thinking about law school and so he'd
[1:23:26] call he'd he'd look on uh and ask me
[1:23:29] who's the who's the district attorney in
[1:23:31] Montgomery County and I'd say well so
[1:23:33] and so he'd look it up in the phone book
[1:23:35] remember those
[1:23:37] and and he'd call them up and say my
[1:23:39] name is Andrew Coffey or my name is
[1:23:41] Andrew Coffey and I'd like to take out
[1:23:44] the and he would he'd go to lunch with
[1:23:45] them and sit down talk with him he's
[1:23:47] just that kind of a guy now Peter
[1:23:48] wouldn't do that
[1:23:49] as a result Andrew got Peter to do all
[1:23:52] of his work
[1:23:55] but Peter made Andrew do all the public
[1:23:56] speaking in school you know all right so
[1:23:59] anyway encourage face-to-face contact it
[1:24:01] does still work and then we need to talk
[1:24:04] about social media we need to talk about
[1:24:06] habits
[1:24:07] and ask your teen how he or she is using
[1:24:10] social media and how it makes them feel
[1:24:13] and remind them that it is full of
[1:24:17] unrealistic images
[1:24:21] all right
[1:24:22] what social media will do to girls
[1:24:25] gaming will do the boys I'm not here to
[1:24:27] talk much about gaming except this is
[1:24:30] Grand Theft Auto 3. I don't know
[1:24:33] anything about Grand Theft Auto
[1:24:36] I don't have any games on my my kids
[1:24:39] hate my phone because my grandkids
[1:24:42] they'll come in and they'll say Papa can
[1:24:43] we use your phone and then they'll give
[1:24:45] it back to me in a few minutes because
[1:24:46] there's not there's nothing on it
[1:24:50] and uh
[1:24:54] and so I'm not I'm not the only when we
[1:24:56] we're homeschooled our kids so the only
[1:24:57] the only two things we ever have ever in
[1:25:00] our lives and we decided we made a
[1:25:02] decision early in life and we were not
[1:25:04] going to do computer games
[1:25:05] the only two things we ever had in our
[1:25:07] family history was Pac-Man
[1:25:09] you know that
[1:25:11] back then in DOS
[1:25:14] yeah yeah
[1:25:16] be quiet over there with you
[1:25:19] and then the other thing was Oregon
[1:25:21] Trail and we turned Oregon Trail into a
[1:25:23] field trip right
[1:25:25] so they were in school the whole time
[1:25:26] they were playing and didn't know it
[1:25:28] anyway
[1:25:29] I don't so I don't know anything about
[1:25:31] games however
[1:25:34] one of the largest most popular games
[1:25:38] games that are out there is Grand Theft
[1:25:41] Auto
[1:25:43] and
[1:25:44] according to the research
[1:25:47] it's based on what's called inverted
[1:25:49] morality
[1:25:51] so in order to win in order to succeed
[1:25:54] at this at this game you have to do you
[1:25:58] have to kill
[1:26:00] and hurt people
[1:26:02] okay
[1:26:03] so the way that you kill and hurt people
[1:26:05] is you do something that's inverted in a
[1:26:09] moral sense in order to achieve success
[1:26:13] so you have to accumulate weapons and
[1:26:16] ammunition
[1:26:17] in the game the way you do that is you
[1:26:20] find a policeman in the game and shoot
[1:26:23] him or kill him and take his guns and
[1:26:26] ammunition so you can shoot and kill
[1:26:29] other people
[1:26:32] now that's upside down
[1:26:34] right
[1:26:36] and and if we had the numbers of people
[1:26:39] who play this game it's unbelievable
[1:26:42] but that's what's called inverted
[1:26:44] morality now the game was purposely
[1:26:46] invented with inverted Morality In other
[1:26:48] words if if if this is good and this is
[1:26:51] bad it's like this now
[1:26:54] this is good
[1:26:56] okay
[1:26:58] now the Bible says woe to those that
[1:27:01] call evil good and good evil who
[1:27:04] substitute Darkness for light and light
[1:27:06] for Darkness who substitute bitter for
[1:27:08] sweet and Sweet for bitter
[1:27:10] here's an article about this inverted
[1:27:13] morality very just one screen
[1:27:15] we now live for the most part in a
[1:27:18] culture with an inverted morality
[1:27:20] for Christians it might surprise you but
[1:27:22] you are now considered evil for your
[1:27:24] views
[1:27:25] the good described in the Bible for
[1:27:27] those who see God is now considered Evil
[1:27:30] by the culture around you
[1:27:33] if you think there are any sins that are
[1:27:35] wrong the inverted culture around you
[1:27:37] will ridicule you for your Antiquated
[1:27:40] beliefs inversion has happened slowly
[1:27:43] but it's fully in place now
[1:27:46] that's one little short edited paragraph
[1:27:48] out of that whole article uh by this
[1:27:50] fellow here and it's just it's just
[1:27:53] incredible how calculated this is who
[1:27:55] knew that Satan was actually planning
[1:27:58] to do an end run around everything that
[1:28:00] was moral and turn it upside down get
[1:28:02] away with it and sell billions
[1:28:05] sell billions
[1:28:07] you know what he said why are you
[1:28:08] showing this because you're raising kids
[1:28:10] in a in a world and in a generation that
[1:28:14] considers this very normal
[1:28:16] I got invited to go to Europe last year
[1:28:19] to talk on family issues and the reason
[1:28:21] is is because the pastors over there got
[1:28:24] together and they realized the
[1:28:26] conversations of their own children were
[1:28:29] changing
[1:28:31] and they were saying why do people say
[1:28:33] something about homosexual marriages and
[1:28:35] why what's the big issue what's the
[1:28:37] what's this the stink about homosexual
[1:28:41] gay people and so forth and the pastors
[1:28:43] realize we've lived in a world where
[1:28:45] that's always been considered normal
[1:28:47] that's in the textbooks that's in school
[1:28:49] that's in daily life and they realize if
[1:28:53] we don't do something to reach this
[1:28:55] generation of kids they're lost
[1:28:58] it's so pervasive now when you go there
[1:29:02] they'll tell you it's America's problem
[1:29:04] but we're feeling it over here they're
[1:29:07] much more liberal over there than than
[1:29:09] we are here but it's a huge Global issue
[1:29:12] and you better not say anything against
[1:29:13] it
[1:29:15] and what we're looking at is this
[1:29:17] inverted morality it is a real problem
[1:29:19] all right can I go a little further
[1:29:22] and say this
[1:29:24] for some reason or another The Wall
[1:29:26] Street Journal picked up on this and
[1:29:28] found documents that were stored
[1:29:31] in Facebook or meta and they got their
[1:29:35] hands on documents that actually proved
[1:29:38] that Facebook knows all about the
[1:29:42] negative effect of social media on kids
[1:29:44] and Facebook owns Instagram
[1:29:47] and YouTube right
[1:29:50] I think and they don't
[1:29:53] okay
[1:29:56] do you own YouTube
[1:29:58] Google Google owns YouTube and and
[1:30:01] Facebook actually knows and documented
[1:30:04] the fact that there is there are
[1:30:06] repercussions there there's damage
[1:30:08] associated with constant use of these
[1:30:10] apps and we're going to do nothing about
[1:30:12] it somehow or another Wall Street
[1:30:14] Journal got a hold of this and it's
[1:30:16] called the Facebook papers
[1:30:19] okay now you can go find it the link is
[1:30:21] on the bottom of the screen and you'll
[1:30:23] you can Google this really easy and
[1:30:25] you'll find it there the Facebook files
[1:30:27] and you can find it this is one
[1:30:29] paragraph
[1:30:30] Facebook Inc knows in acute detail
[1:30:33] that its platforms are riddled with
[1:30:36] flaws that cause harm often in ways that
[1:30:40] the company fully understands and that's
[1:30:42] the central finding of a Wall Street
[1:30:44] Journal series based on a review of
[1:30:46] internal Facebook documents including
[1:30:49] research Reports online employee
[1:30:51] discussions drafts of presentations to
[1:30:53] Senior Management so somehow or another
[1:30:55] they got they tapped into this and found
[1:30:57] it and then did a series on that here's
[1:31:00] one of the Articles right here I have it
[1:31:02] printed out and I quote from it and you
[1:31:06] can go you can go find this and and let
[1:31:08] me give you one paragraph here from this
[1:31:11] researchers inside Instagram
[1:31:14] and owned by Facebook have been studying
[1:31:16] for years how it's photo sharing app and
[1:31:19] that's what it was designed for for
[1:31:21] facial photo uh photo photo use
[1:31:26] affects millions of young users and
[1:31:28] repeatedly the company founded Instagram
[1:31:30] is harmful for a sizable proportion
[1:31:33] percentage of them
[1:31:35] most notably teenage girls
[1:31:38] more so than other social media
[1:31:40] platforms
[1:31:42] so of all the social media platforms
[1:31:44] this one has the potential to be more
[1:31:46] damaging
[1:31:47] Facebook
[1:31:48] consistently played down the app's
[1:31:51] negative effects including comments to
[1:31:53] Congress and hasn't made its research
[1:31:55] public or available to academics or
[1:31:57] lawmakers who ask for it so Facebook is
[1:31:59] basically saying uh yeah we we do know
[1:32:02] but they're not giving out information
[1:32:04] and so forth they're now they're become
[1:32:05] much more tight-lipped about it all
[1:32:07] right so let's dig in just for a moment
[1:32:09] here right and I just stay with me I
[1:32:12] only got a couple of screens left here
[1:32:15] but you say okay what's the what's the
[1:32:17] deal with Instagram
[1:32:23] in 2010 users were introduced to
[1:32:26] Instagram a social platform that focused
[1:32:28] on body image and lifestyle so it was
[1:32:30] mainly just for kids to be able to take
[1:32:33] images of themselves a recent report
[1:32:35] reviewed by The Wall Street Journal
[1:32:37] stated more than 40 percent of Instagram
[1:32:40] users are 22 years old and younger
[1:32:43] and 2.35 billion users log on the
[1:32:47] Instagram in the U.S
[1:32:49] every day that's not in the U.S
[1:32:54] compared to 32 that's in the world
[1:32:57] each day compared to 32 percent of teen
[1:32:59] Facebook users so kids are going to
[1:33:01] under 22 are gonna uh proportionately
[1:33:05] use Instagram a lot more than they are
[1:33:07] Facebook you're giving away your age
[1:33:09] when you use Facebook apparently
[1:33:11] I don't have it I don't have either one
[1:33:12] of them and I I don't want them but I'm
[1:33:15] just telling you what what it says well
[1:33:17] while Instagram launched with the idea
[1:33:20] that consumers could use the platform
[1:33:21] for connecting and sharing photos with
[1:33:23] friends it began to take on negative
[1:33:25] aspects of the web
[1:33:27] and Adolescence we're starting to report
[1:33:29] anxiety depression even Suicidal
[1:33:31] Thoughts
[1:33:32] especially for girls
[1:33:36] after
[1:33:37] thorough internal study
[1:33:40] Facebook concluded these emotions were
[1:33:42] tied to Instagram specifically
[1:33:44] not social media in general but
[1:33:46] specifically where's this where's this
[1:33:49] problem area where what group are we
[1:33:51] talking about here is what the study
[1:33:53] looked at and they they narrowed it down
[1:33:55] to specifically Instagram
[1:33:58] more specifically 32 percent of teen
[1:34:01] girls said that when they felt bad about
[1:34:02] their bodies Instagram made them feel
[1:34:04] worse
[1:34:07] one-third
[1:34:09] now here's what's here's what's sad okay
[1:34:12] the next this this part and the next
[1:34:13] screen teenagers have the ability to
[1:34:16] consistently check on their status right
[1:34:18] they can they can see are we still
[1:34:20] popular how many friends do we have how
[1:34:23] many they're they're not really friends
[1:34:26] right they're virtual friends
[1:34:29] so when they fall down and they need
[1:34:31] somebody to hold their hand that's not
[1:34:32] they're not there
[1:34:34] when you need somebody to babysit your
[1:34:36] cat they're not there
[1:34:37] hey when you have your birthday they're
[1:34:39] not there bringing you a present or your
[1:34:40] cake right
[1:34:42] friends friends real friends in life are
[1:34:45] different I know I'm over 30 but friends
[1:34:47] in life are different
[1:34:49] but a lot of kids feel like I have a I
[1:34:50] have 1500 friends
[1:34:54] but they're not there to say happy
[1:34:55] birthday or they're not there to put
[1:34:56] their arm around them when they go
[1:34:58] through a tough time right
[1:35:00] so it would be good to sit down and
[1:35:02] Define for your kids what a friend
[1:35:04] really is a friend sticks closer than a
[1:35:07] brother the Bible says right
[1:35:10] and you should develop some friendships
[1:35:13] by doing this put your phone down and
[1:35:16] talk to that person
[1:35:21] haha
[1:35:22] in one such study 40 of Instagram users
[1:35:25] who reported feeling unattractive said
[1:35:29] the feeling began
[1:35:31] on the app on Instagram
[1:35:34] so when they started to feel
[1:35:35] unattractive now they now they're
[1:35:37] dissatisfied with how they look their
[1:35:38] weight
[1:35:39] and so forth the feeling began on the
[1:35:43] app
[1:35:44] almost seems like this app has a mind of
[1:35:46] its own
[1:35:48] we call that a Spirit by the way
[1:35:52] yet Instagram's researchers conveyed
[1:35:55] that those that had negative
[1:35:57] psychological effects of the platform
[1:35:59] were not logging off so that was their
[1:36:02] response they're not why don't they just
[1:36:04] shut it down why don't you just turn it
[1:36:05] off or delete the app now watch what it
[1:36:07] says adolescent girls reported they knew
[1:36:10] the app was causing anxiety
[1:36:13] but they didn't have the inner strength
[1:36:15] to turn it off
[1:36:16] or delete the app altogether referring
[1:36:19] to the app as an addiction or habit
[1:36:25] let me see it again how many of you have
[1:36:27] daughters
[1:36:29] ask them what they're doing on their
[1:36:31] phone ask them what they're doing with
[1:36:33] their friends
[1:36:35] because now all of a sudden
[1:36:38] listen
[1:36:39] in in a story brother random tells he
[1:36:42] talks about these parents and so forth
[1:36:44] and they provided their kids with this
[1:36:46] with that something else and he said but
[1:36:47] you know the wrongest thing they did the
[1:36:51] wrongest thing
[1:36:53] was not to evangelize their kids
[1:36:55] because you know what's going to help
[1:36:57] your kids overcome this is a
[1:36:59] relationship with Jesus Christ and a new
[1:37:02] birth
[1:37:03] you're not going to pray social media
[1:37:06] away you're not going to convince your
[1:37:10] kids that you don't need a phone and you
[1:37:11] don't need to be connected
[1:37:14] you can talk to your kids about
[1:37:15] boundaries and things that you need to
[1:37:17] put in place and proper responsible use
[1:37:19] and transparency and all and and those
[1:37:22] things are good and I'm not discouraging
[1:37:23] that at all but you have a culture out
[1:37:26] there that is overwhelmingly
[1:37:29] pressing your kid to participate
[1:37:32] be one of us and friends to a teenager
[1:37:35] is everything
[1:37:38] and you've got to be proactive in that
[1:37:40] but I will tell you something you will
[1:37:42] only be able to hold their hands so long
[1:37:44] they need a relationship with Jesus
[1:37:46] Christ
[1:37:47] and you know where they will see the
[1:37:49] benefits of a relation and the fruits of
[1:37:50] a relationship with Christ more than
[1:37:52] anywhere else is in you
[1:37:55] and your influence as a Christian in
[1:37:57] your life in your conduct as a Christian
[1:37:59] and your example as a Christian in your
[1:38:01] household is going to do more to
[1:38:03] influence your children than anything
[1:38:05] that they'll get on a PowerPoint
[1:38:07] you understand what I'm saying
[1:38:09] because kids now they they look and file
[1:38:12] information so quickly I mean it's there
[1:38:14] you know you know move on move on move
[1:38:15] on move on move on and a little of it
[1:38:18] registers
[1:38:20] they're doing school on it they're doing
[1:38:22] uh their social life is all on it uh
[1:38:25] they're traveling on it uh you know I
[1:38:27] mean everything takes away their banking
[1:38:29] is on it everything is on it all
[1:38:31] together everything's a QR code and
[1:38:33] everything's a link and everything's you
[1:38:34] know so and so they're continually
[1:38:36] continually and more continually exposed
[1:38:39] and bombarded by all of it there hey as
[1:38:41] parents you cannot say it doesn't matter
[1:38:43] it does
[1:38:46] will it affect them it will not all of
[1:38:49] it not all of them would be suicidal but
[1:38:51] I will tell you that a lot of them will
[1:38:53] look at it and say wow I have a
[1:38:55] miserable life
[1:38:59] and it's be it's because they're looking
[1:39:01] at things that are simply
[1:39:03] what other kids are doing
[1:39:06] now let me see if I can if I can get
[1:39:08] this to work here
[1:39:10] I I embedded it but I really don't know
[1:39:13] if I can
[1:39:16] this is a
[1:39:18] oh come on
[1:39:19] me me and Technology
[1:39:25] hello
[1:39:29] I just came to the end of the internet
[1:39:35] you know what we're going to do we're
[1:39:37] going to move right on
[1:39:40] that is a one-year-old
[1:39:42] sorry
[1:39:43] I must it must not be connected I'm
[1:39:45] sorry I didn't do that that's a
[1:39:46] one-year-old
[1:39:47] who in The Opening screen of that it's a
[1:39:50] very it's a viral YouTube one that has
[1:39:53] this one-year-old girl she's on an iPad
[1:39:55] and she's going like this she's moving
[1:39:58] Pages page page page and it's it's got
[1:40:00] all kinds of images on it and she picks
[1:40:02] up a magazine
[1:40:03] and she's going like this on the on the
[1:40:06] magazine
[1:40:07] and then she's that computer doesn't
[1:40:09] work so she goes back to the iPad and
[1:40:10] does this and there's all kinds of
[1:40:12] activity and she goes back to the
[1:40:13] magazine
[1:40:15] and she's got her one finger
[1:40:17] one-year-old she's got a finger like
[1:40:18] that and she's going like this on a
[1:40:19] magazine
[1:40:23] broke my heart when I saw it I thought
[1:40:26] wow
[1:40:29] because what what we're looking at here
[1:40:31] is not an evil one-year-old
[1:40:34] we're looking at where the culture is
[1:40:37] actually going
[1:40:39] and the culture is is in is on purpose
[1:40:44] they're doing something to draw that
[1:40:46] younger generation in because that's a
[1:40:48] guarantee that they have they have a
[1:40:50] future right for this whole process Let
[1:40:53] Me Tell You Folks as Christians we don't
[1:40:55] need to be passive
[1:40:57] about this whole thing and I would
[1:40:59] encourage you not to be passive about it
[1:41:01] you had to be proactive in your
[1:41:03] household and say as for me and my house
[1:41:04] we're going to serve the Lord and in
[1:41:06] this area too so you know what Mom and
[1:41:08] Dad we need to sit down and make some
[1:41:10] ground rules even if the ground rules
[1:41:11] are very basic like we're going to have
[1:41:13] no Electronic media at night when we go
[1:41:15] to bed we're going to go to bed
[1:41:17] and our kids don't need to have a
[1:41:19] connection with the entire Cosmos
[1:41:21] while they sleep so you know what we're
[1:41:24] going to put the phone here and we're
[1:41:26] going to let you sleep all right that
[1:41:28] might be that might be one thing I don't
[1:41:29] you I mean you have to sit down and
[1:41:31] think about this okay I don't have kids
[1:41:33] at home so you don't you have to think
[1:41:35] about this because what I'm telling you
[1:41:38] is that someone else is thinking about
[1:41:39] your kids
[1:41:41] if you're not somebody else is
[1:41:44] this is not some random all of a sudden
[1:41:47] we wake up in this e-world this has been
[1:41:49] planned and I'm not a conspiracy
[1:41:52] theorist I just know that Satan is more
[1:41:54] than just a figment of our imagination
[1:41:57] we live in the God we live under the
[1:41:59] influence of the God of this evil age in
[1:42:01] this world and we live in Satan's Eden
[1:42:03] so as as if you want to have a Christian
[1:42:06] family
[1:42:07] you're going to have to say it's from me
[1:42:08] and my house we serve the Lord and we're
[1:42:10] going to create an atmosphere where the
[1:42:12] holy spirit's always welcome so you know
[1:42:13] what you you got to roll up your sleeves
[1:42:15] and think about this you need to do your
[1:42:17] research you need to ask other parents
[1:42:18] you need to uh you know incorporate
[1:42:21] things even if it's just a baby step at
[1:42:23] a time because once you let the genie
[1:42:25] out of the bottle it's really hard to
[1:42:27] get it back in So if you've got kids
[1:42:28] that don't have phones yet you need to
[1:42:30] be really thinking about their access to
[1:42:32] social media here's how we're going to
[1:42:34] do it
[1:42:36] here's how we're going to plot this and
[1:42:39] and you need to be thinking about that
[1:42:40] because this is a huge and it's going to
[1:42:42] become Huger as we go on because
[1:42:44] exponentially it changes if I brought
[1:42:46] you statistics next week they'd be
[1:42:48] different
[1:42:49] because it's when we're talking about a
[1:42:52] third of the world's population hello
[1:42:56] we're talking about major influences
[1:42:59] here
[1:43:00] and now they're beginning to figure this
[1:43:02] out I brought this along this book right
[1:43:04] here and uh this is this and I'm I'm
[1:43:07] promoting it I'm just saying that this
[1:43:10] was one that was very interesting the
[1:43:11] title is the collapse of parenting and
[1:43:13] it's by Dr Leonard Sachs and uh he he
[1:43:17] makes an astounding observation he's not
[1:43:19] in the message all right
[1:43:21] he's not don't don't shoot me but but he
[1:43:24] makes an astounding observation that
[1:43:28] there's been a huge transfer in our
[1:43:31] culture in our time there's been a huge
[1:43:33] transfer
[1:43:35] of authority and respect for authority
[1:43:39] from parents to children
[1:43:42] so now it's up to the children what they
[1:43:44] want let the children decide let them do
[1:43:46] what they want to do this is how they
[1:43:48] learn to make decision and so he said in
[1:43:50] our culture there's been this huge
[1:43:51] transfer of respect and respect for
[1:43:54] authority to children now children
[1:43:56] essentially are calling the shots I have
[1:43:58] to have a phone because all my kids all
[1:44:00] my friends have a phone
[1:44:01] and there's there's in a sense the the
[1:44:05] role of parents and the authority of
[1:44:07] parents is essentially undermined in our
[1:44:10] society and it's brought
[1:44:12] all kinds of repercussions and is just
[1:44:15] extraordinary how accurate he actually
[1:44:17] was and it's extraordinary to see how
[1:44:19] brother Branham talked about this in the
[1:44:21] 60s
[1:44:22] in the 60s and talking about the
[1:44:24] breakdown of motherhood and fatherhood
[1:44:26] and so forth so let me remind you again
[1:44:29] that this quotation brother bran says we
[1:44:30] got to think of the others that's coming
[1:44:32] on behind us these young people and so
[1:44:34] forth a place for our children our
[1:44:35] daughters we don't want them out in the
[1:44:37] world in those things like that
[1:44:41] our daughters we don't want them out in
[1:44:43] the world things like that we want them
[1:44:45] girls raised like their mothers
[1:44:47] and and who's going to make arrangements
[1:44:49] for that
[1:44:50] your pastor is going to make
[1:44:51] arrangements for no the Holy Spirit no
[1:44:54] he doesn't say that
[1:44:56] Jeffersonville is going to make
[1:44:58] decisions now
[1:44:59] no
[1:45:01] we've got to make arrangements
[1:45:04] you have to get fathers you have to get
[1:45:06] involved fathers you got to take your
[1:45:08] girls out for a date
[1:45:10] fathers you got to take your girls out
[1:45:12] to Olive Garden or somewhere else that
[1:45:14] the ordinary probably wouldn't go and
[1:45:16] and make your daughter feel special
[1:45:18] because if you don't make her feel
[1:45:20] special somebody else will
[1:45:23] you don't pay your attention and tell
[1:45:24] her how beautiful she is and encourage
[1:45:27] her and so forth if you don't do that
[1:45:29] somebody else is going to do it
[1:45:31] and you should be her prince you should
[1:45:34] be her hero you should be the guy that
[1:45:37] makes her feel special
[1:45:38] and you should be the guy and I told my
[1:45:40] sons I said hey I got two granddaughters
[1:45:43] I told Andrew I said if some dude shows
[1:45:45] up at the door and wants to get involved
[1:45:47] with my granddaughters I said I'll let
[1:45:49] you stand there first but behind you I
[1:45:52] will have a weapon
[1:45:57] I'm just warning you I will have a
[1:45:58] weapon
[1:46:00] we're not streaming this right
[1:46:05] some knobhead who comes along and says
[1:46:08] I'll look after her Mr Coffee yeah right
[1:46:11] knucklehead
[1:46:12] go get a job
[1:46:21] look on page six of your notes there I
[1:46:23] have a message
[1:46:26] this is me I have a message on behalf of
[1:46:29] all young Godly men to all you parents
[1:46:31] raising girls today
[1:46:33] I have a message on behalf of all young
[1:46:35] Godly men to all you parents raising
[1:46:37] girls today in less than ideal
[1:46:39] conditions with little or no outside
[1:46:41] support sodom's at the door
[1:46:44] hold a standard High be courageous and
[1:46:47] strong help turn these young girls into
[1:46:49] sisters who have a respect for God and
[1:46:51] his word
[1:46:53] who knows how to labor with a husband as
[1:46:56] he serves God
[1:46:58] who can handle the duties of a home and
[1:47:01] manage manage it on one income help her
[1:47:03] to choose character in a man and may she
[1:47:06] not compromise her virtue for popularity
[1:47:10] I have a message for people who are
[1:47:12] raising girls today
[1:47:14] you should encourage that girl to seek
[1:47:16] character
[1:47:18] and to seek a young man who can get a
[1:47:22] job hold a job in a sister who
[1:47:24] recognizes that but I will say this that
[1:47:27] it's unfair for us to say that the girls
[1:47:29] have to be this our young men need to be
[1:47:31] trained to get a job to work and be
[1:47:34] responsible and finish the job and to be
[1:47:37] able to save money
[1:47:39] and to be able to stop buying toys and
[1:47:41] invest in their future and invest in
[1:47:43] their family's future
[1:47:44] and to be able to uh you know learn how
[1:47:47] to how to fend for themselves and to be
[1:47:49] proactive and to be on fire for God and
[1:47:52] to be in a place where God wants them to
[1:47:54] be in their teen years and 18 years and
[1:47:55] in their career they need to be thinking
[1:47:57] in the future they need to be thinking
[1:47:59] about the wife and family they will
[1:48:01] eventually have they need we need to
[1:48:03] encourage our young men to be that way
[1:48:04] because when you talk to girls today
[1:48:06] teenage girls at winter youth retreat or
[1:48:08] somewhere like that they'll say well
[1:48:09] there are no and there are no good guys
[1:48:12] well you know what that's not entirely
[1:48:14] true but I will say to the guys all
[1:48:17] right guys this is what the girls are
[1:48:18] saying and they'll say well the girls
[1:48:19] got their head in romance novels and
[1:48:21] romance stuff on on the internet and
[1:48:23] they're all uh Instagram Fanatics and
[1:48:25] everything else they're all concerned
[1:48:26] about their parents and so forth and
[1:48:28] I'll say girls what do you think of that
[1:48:29] and and going back and forth you know
[1:48:31] what there's a lack of there's a lack of
[1:48:33] a very simple thing that God told us
[1:48:35] we're going to take with us when we
[1:48:36] leave here and that's
[1:48:38] character
[1:48:40] children are not automatically born with
[1:48:43] character
[1:48:44] they learn character they develop
[1:48:47] character in life guess who's going to
[1:48:49] be the primary coach for that
[1:48:56] the Bible tells us in Proverbs chapter 4
[1:48:58] get wisdom get understanding
[1:49:00] proverbs 4 7 wisdom is the principle
[1:49:03] thing therefore get wisdom with all thy
[1:49:06] getting get understanding Proverbs 16.
[1:49:09] how much better is it to give wisdom
[1:49:10] than gold is anybody unclear
[1:49:14] all right how do we do it brother Barry
[1:49:16] here we go Proverbs 29 the rod and
[1:49:19] reproof give wisdom
[1:49:24] there's a thing called discipline
[1:49:27] in Scripture
[1:49:29] and it doesn't hurt for you to teach
[1:49:31] your young man and your young lady that
[1:49:34] discipline still matters
[1:49:36] and they need to practice a discipline
[1:49:39] in their life and discipline in their
[1:49:41] stewardship saving money
[1:49:43] conducting myself in an appropriate way
[1:49:46] to be able to control myself in social
[1:49:49] media and all the other things that
[1:49:52] require a little discipline in our world
[1:49:54] because they live in a world where
[1:49:55] discipline has disappeared
[1:50:00] so in our house this is what we
[1:50:02] prioritized
[1:50:04] in our house and I'm just telling you
[1:50:06] giving you a little insight in our house
[1:50:09] we made sure that faith and spiritual
[1:50:11] issues were number one we go to church
[1:50:12] it doesn't matter who's visiting
[1:50:15] it doesn't matter uh what's going on
[1:50:17] around us you know we go to church sure
[1:50:21] we we we keep God first
[1:50:24] and and that's that's simply what that
[1:50:26] means that was a that was a priority
[1:50:28] secondly we develop a Biblical order we
[1:50:31] find out what the Bible requires of us
[1:50:33] we want to know what pleases God and
[1:50:36] we're going to try to apply that in our
[1:50:38] house so that God can see that and bless
[1:50:42] our household as a result of it thirdly
[1:50:44] we're going to handle our finances like
[1:50:46] Christians
[1:50:48] so we are going to pay our tithes we're
[1:50:50] going to put God first we're going to
[1:50:51] try to do what we can to be out of debt
[1:50:58] we're not streaming right
[1:51:00] but we are recording
[1:51:02] too bad
[1:51:04] I will tell you something
[1:51:09] I insist
[1:51:11] that if I'm going to marry a young
[1:51:13] couple they go through at least one
[1:51:16] session of pre-marital council
[1:51:19] at least one okay
[1:51:22] and what I've learned over my years
[1:51:25] is that one of the things that we need
[1:51:27] to do is teach young people about
[1:51:28] finances
[1:51:30] you know why
[1:51:32] because credit is available
[1:51:36] credits available
[1:51:39] and
[1:51:44] oh my
[1:51:45] you're sure we're recording now right
[1:51:48] I'm only kidding
[1:51:51] I'm not only a steward over my money and
[1:51:54] what God gives me but I'm a steward over
[1:51:55] my time
[1:51:57] I'm a steward over my children
[1:51:59] the steward means that somebody's
[1:52:01] handling something that's not theirs but
[1:52:03] they're given charge of it
[1:52:05] for a season
[1:52:07] money
[1:52:09] my children I don't know my children we
[1:52:12] have them for a Time stewardship matters
[1:52:15] and this is a priority in our household
[1:52:18] also that we're going to have standards
[1:52:20] and boundaries and discipline in our
[1:52:23] household that are appropriate and what
[1:52:26] I how I explain this is that we have a
[1:52:30] ladder of responsibility a ladder of
[1:52:33] responsibility meaning that for kids as
[1:52:36] they grow they're allowed to climb up
[1:52:39] the ladder which gives them more freedom
[1:52:42] if they can handle the height they're at
[1:52:44] they can stay there but if they're
[1:52:47] irresponsible with that level of Freedom
[1:52:50] they've got to come back a notch all
[1:52:52] right so we're going to let you go on a
[1:52:54] Boy Scout trip my guys were all in Boy
[1:52:57] Scouts
[1:52:58] pre-gay Boy Scouts
[1:53:01] okay
[1:53:02] I want to want to be they all have their
[1:53:04] Eagle Scout
[1:53:06] as a result of them being involved in
[1:53:08] that which we we're homeschooled so we
[1:53:10] wanted to have them involved in some
[1:53:12] other wholesome things to do I became I
[1:53:15] was I held every position in The
[1:53:18] Scouting organization except scoutmaster
[1:53:22] I was a cub master chaplain Assistant
[1:53:25] Scout Master I've done everything in
[1:53:27] discounting movement except be a
[1:53:29] scoutmaster but I did that because my
[1:53:32] boys were there so rather than just send
[1:53:34] them I went with them so when they had a
[1:53:35] camp out guess who was there
[1:53:37] and when they had an event I was there
[1:53:39] because I was part of the staff right I
[1:53:41] was part of the group so I saw what was
[1:53:43] going on and I was with them for the
[1:53:44] vast majority of their years at The
[1:53:47] Scouting they all went through they all
[1:53:48] got their Scouts Eagle Scout which is
[1:53:51] the highest honor in scouting and as a
[1:53:54] result of that uh you know I was able to
[1:53:56] share with them and then if there was
[1:53:57] something going on or something funny
[1:53:59] happening we I could observe it we could
[1:54:01] talk about it I could say something to
[1:54:03] the scout master or whatever else uh you
[1:54:05] know those were I was I was privy to it
[1:54:08] in other words I was a witness of what
[1:54:09] was going on so there were there were
[1:54:11] wholesome basically Back Then There Were
[1:54:13] wholesome things and they were they were
[1:54:15] good for our boys so they they went
[1:54:17] through that and and the the discipline
[1:54:19] and the standards and all the rest of it
[1:54:22] that were in place uh you know that was
[1:54:24] a part of our upbringing for them and
[1:54:27] and the ability for them to learn to
[1:54:29] interact with other kids and get along
[1:54:31] and all the other things that go with
[1:54:33] that but there has to be boundaries in
[1:54:35] that you have to establish boundaries
[1:54:37] for kids and and the Bible has a lot to
[1:54:39] say about out boundaries here the other
[1:54:41] thing that we're going to prioritize is
[1:54:43] that we resolve differences because
[1:54:45] they're going to have to resolve
[1:54:47] differences when they get older they're
[1:54:49] going to have to do it at work they're
[1:54:50] going to have to do it in their own
[1:54:51] marriage and lastly we're going to learn
[1:54:54] to do whatever it takes to create and
[1:54:56] maintain a godly atmosphere
[1:54:58] so these are the priorities for our
[1:55:00] house okay
[1:55:05] brother Branham said about job he said
[1:55:07] he got kind of worried he had a bunch of
[1:55:09] children and they were worldly mingling
[1:55:12] with the world and all parents know what
[1:55:14] a feeling that is
[1:55:16] when your children your very heart
[1:55:19] begins to mingle with the world
[1:55:22] now let me stop for a minute because I
[1:55:24] I'm a I'm a student of the Hebrew
[1:55:26] language the Biblical Hebrew language I
[1:55:28] don't speak it but I wanted to know when
[1:55:30] God made a statement what did he really
[1:55:31] mean what did he really what was he
[1:55:34] really saying and that's that's just me
[1:55:37] but I often was puzzled by this idea
[1:55:40] that job was offering as sacrifices for
[1:55:42] his children and they hadn't sinned he
[1:55:43] offered sacrifices in case they sinned
[1:55:47] right that's essentially the message in
[1:55:48] that
[1:55:50] in that first chapter of job and Satan
[1:55:52] says well hey you know I mean he's
[1:55:54] covered he's got protection I can't get
[1:55:56] out of it you take the covering off take
[1:55:58] the protection away and I'll I'll make
[1:56:01] them I'll make him say something
[1:56:02] different
[1:56:04] and and I wondered I wondered about this
[1:56:07] this principle or the reason that job
[1:56:10] was actually making sacrifices
[1:56:12] continually for his children
[1:56:15] in case they sinned
[1:56:17] and in the Hebrew language it it
[1:56:21] describes something that you'll
[1:56:23] understand right away
[1:56:24] that job knew his children were raised
[1:56:29] in this message
[1:56:31] and there were job's children
[1:56:33] and you know what
[1:56:36] job's my father
[1:56:38] and I've been at all the camps
[1:56:40] and I've Been Everywhere
[1:56:43] been around this message all my life
[1:56:45] you know what
[1:56:47] I got a little
[1:56:49] I got a little liberty here I can dabble
[1:56:52] in this dabble in that after all my dad
[1:56:55] is job
[1:56:57] and I can venture outside the lines a
[1:57:00] little bit
[1:57:02] and you know what that is that's a
[1:57:04] spirit of entitlement
[1:57:08] and that's what the Hebrew identifies
[1:57:12] they feel like well I'm in the message
[1:57:14] all these years and my dad's brother Sam
[1:57:16] and I got you know we go to all the
[1:57:18] meetings and brother Sam's well-known
[1:57:19] person he believes the message you know
[1:57:21] what and I'm not picking on you guys but
[1:57:23] I am
[1:57:24] I say this to my guys all the time just
[1:57:27] because your brother Barry's Sons
[1:57:29] doesn't give you this the the right to
[1:57:32] feel entitled to some special blessing
[1:57:34] that you don't need to toe the line or
[1:57:37] something else so you know what he's
[1:57:38] doing he's offering sacrifices in case
[1:57:41] that Spirit of entitlement gets a hold
[1:57:42] of my kids and they feel like well I can
[1:57:44] cozy up with a girl and I can do this
[1:57:46] and you know what we've always been
[1:57:49] around the message we're well known
[1:57:50] we're pretty popular
[1:57:53] that's a spirit that's gone nowhere that
[1:57:56] spirit is still here and there's a lot
[1:57:58] of young people today who feel very much
[1:58:00] like you know what I've never missed a
[1:58:02] day at church and we go to all the camps
[1:58:04] and we don't have any tattoos and you
[1:58:06] know we know who brother Branham is and
[1:58:08] all the rest of it
[1:58:09] God owes me something let me tell you
[1:58:11] God doesn't owe you anything
[1:58:14] and the moment thank you the moment you
[1:58:16] start to feel like I'm entitled to
[1:58:17] certain blessings and I'm entitled to
[1:58:20] certain benefits here just because I'm
[1:58:22] around the message you better hope that
[1:58:24] somebody's offering sacrifices for you
[1:58:26] somewhere
[1:58:30] and brother Branham said they were out
[1:58:32] dabbling in the world they were worldly
[1:58:35] mingling with the world
[1:58:37] and job knew where that was coming from
[1:58:40] this sense of entitlement and he knew
[1:58:42] that my goodness they're not sensing the
[1:58:45] need of sincerity themselves they're not
[1:58:48] sensing the need of their own sense of
[1:58:50] waywardness and they're drifting here
[1:58:52] and the cultures promoting that and it's
[1:58:54] so easy and so forth and so job is you
[1:58:57] know is a wiser person he's looking at
[1:58:59] that and saying my goodness I better
[1:59:02] I better do what I can here
[1:59:05] brother Graham says he talks about Billy
[1:59:07] Paul and he talks about he says we don't
[1:59:09] have a Christian School in in our in our
[1:59:11] town he says in the worldly children out
[1:59:13] there and I said I thought of sending my
[1:59:15] boys to school and and my board is
[1:59:17] school and everything he said get
[1:59:19] drilled into him and all the other
[1:59:21] things there that brother bam is
[1:59:22] concerned about as a parent he he's not
[1:59:25] he's not missing the point he is he is
[1:59:27] understanding that this this is actually
[1:59:30] a real issue this is actually a real
[1:59:34] issue now
[1:59:36] let me just for a moment here
[1:59:40] just for time
[1:59:41] brother Branham said we have such a
[1:59:43] juvenile crime wave Across the Nation he
[1:59:45] said but really I think it started in
[1:59:47] the home
[1:59:49] and I think parents begin to let go and
[1:59:51] if the child has been raised up in a
[1:59:52] good old-fashioned Godly home I don't
[1:59:54] say it would be all over certainly not
[1:59:55] but it would certainly give that child
[1:59:57] the right kind of influence
[2:00:00] we need to stop right there and say Lord
[2:00:05] let me be determined to create the right
[2:00:08] kind of atmosphere in my household
[2:00:10] Lord
[2:00:12] if my children even are grown and gone
[2:00:14] or grown
[2:00:17] let me do what I can to make things
[2:00:19] right
[2:00:20] and let me be a vessel that I can
[2:00:22] influence my grandchildren
[2:00:24] because I have an intergen generational
[2:00:26] responsibility let me do what I can
[2:00:30] to influence my household my offspring
[2:00:34] my third generation fourth generation
[2:00:36] whatever
[2:00:37] let me be that way I don't want to be
[2:00:39] that statistic I don't want to be that
[2:00:43] that parent that brother braham's
[2:00:45] talking about here
[2:00:47] I think our responsibility is clear
[2:00:50] I I think our mission is clear
[2:00:54] and if you want to have a Christian
[2:00:55] family
[2:00:56] it isn't going to automatically just
[2:00:58] happen
[2:01:00] it's going to be the result of things
[2:01:02] you decide
[2:01:04] of things you do
[2:01:08] and the sooner we do things God's way
[2:01:10] the better off your family is going to
[2:01:11] be let's pray
[2:01:15] Heavenly Father we've said lots of
[2:01:18] things
[2:01:19] Lord there's lots of principles we
[2:01:20] discover and find in the scripture and
[2:01:23] the message Lord to teach us good things
[2:01:27] but Lord I know that we are called not
[2:01:29] to be just hearers but Lord may we model
[2:01:33] and demonstrate and teach and instill
[2:01:36] these things in our kids
[2:01:38] even when it's not easy even when it
[2:01:42] requires a sacrifice and a challenge in
[2:01:44] our part
[2:01:45] help us Lord I pray as we move through
[2:01:49] these cycles of life
[2:01:51] and realize Lord that we have a world
[2:01:54] whose views are very hostile to ours
[2:01:58] and in very subtle ways try to capture
[2:02:01] the imagination and the hearts of our
[2:02:04] children I pray you'd help us to be
[2:02:06] discerning
[2:02:07] I pray you'd help us to be wise
[2:02:10] and I pray you'd help us to use all the
[2:02:12] resources available
[2:02:14] to stem the influence of the culture
[2:02:16] around us
[2:02:18] we love you Lord and we thank you for
[2:02:20] your word and what it teaches us have
[2:02:22] your way now we pray bless our
[2:02:24] fellowship in Jesus lovely name
[2:02:28] amen
[2:02:30] and all God's people said
[2:02:32] I don't want to be a parent
[2:02:34] all right one reminder before we give it
[2:02:36] to Brother Sam this question box over
[2:02:38] here or see me I'd love to be able to
[2:02:41] hear from you and questions or things
[2:02:43] you think I'm not going to talk about
[2:02:44] okay but Sam
[2:03:02] great questions here I'm going to deal
[2:03:04] with in a minute but just uh on the on
[2:03:07] the Fly anybody got anything that they
[2:03:10] want to say complaints criticisms
[2:03:13] want your money back
[2:03:16] um
[2:03:18] anything at all Floors open
[2:03:21] I've answered all your questions
[2:03:23] yeah
[2:03:25] when am I coming back
[2:03:29] I I was in Hungary two weeks ago I was
[2:03:32] at home last week I wear a name tag when
[2:03:34] I come home to my church
[2:03:36] and then I'm here this weekend I'm in
[2:03:37] Iceland the next weekend and then you
[2:03:39] know I mean it just goes on and on so uh
[2:03:42] five years or so
[2:03:47] I can be bought but
[2:03:49] I'm only kidding I we'd love to have
[2:03:52] brother Samuel down our place and
[2:03:55] um
[2:03:56] you know I just I felt bad that it's
[2:03:58] about a ratio of seven to one I think
[2:04:00] but uh I I wanted to come up for a while
[2:04:03] and glad to be here so I appreciate the
[2:04:05] opportunity but I do not know when I'm
[2:04:07] coming back that's for sure and comments
[2:04:17] I was in Vancouver a month ago
[2:04:20] I revise the whole thing
[2:04:23] I I redid it for him and I was slow
[2:04:26] getting it to him because I revised the
[2:04:28] whole thing
[2:04:29] and it's not necessarily new principles
[2:04:31] but it's new data as I like to be based
[2:04:34] on the data you know like and say well
[2:04:37] this is the way it's trending or moving
[2:04:39] well that changes very quickly so yeah
[2:04:42] yeah but it requires a lot of keeping up
[2:04:45] you know and then I talk to parents I
[2:04:47] listen to you know I talk to my boys I I
[2:04:50] talk to different people who are good at
[2:04:52] this you know and listen to what's
[2:04:54] what's being said
[2:04:56] and anything else comments sister
[2:05:05] yes
[2:05:07] yes
[2:05:08] um
[2:05:09] I I think I think you could summarize it
[2:05:12] and how to make your home more more
[2:05:13] welcoming and pleasant for the Holy
[2:05:15] Spirit
[2:05:16] um
[2:05:18] there's lots of different things that
[2:05:19] you can do but uh you I could summarize
[2:05:22] it and say you have to apply the token
[2:05:25] so in the early in the first Exodus when
[2:05:28] you look at that they they were told to
[2:05:29] go through their homes and to clean it
[2:05:33] and get out everything that didn't
[2:05:34] belong anything that would be considered
[2:05:36] defilement in that home and get it out
[2:05:39] so it could be books it could be music
[2:05:42] um it could be anything along that line
[2:05:44] anything that you wouldn't do if the
[2:05:47] Holy Spirit was sitting next to you
[2:05:50] that's kind of the approach you know and
[2:05:53] they had to they had to purge uh foods
[2:05:56] that didn't belong like 11 11 is a type
[2:05:58] of sin they had to purge all of that out
[2:06:01] and
[2:06:03] um you know they so I mean your your
[2:06:06] phone has probably a fair bit of 11 on
[2:06:08] it right so we're not just talking about
[2:06:10] physical stuff here you know music
[2:06:14] um the the things that you listen to
[2:06:15] things that you watch uh it's all so
[2:06:19] accessible now you know it's also
[2:06:20] available and uh then I think you know
[2:06:24] you have to we all have disagreements
[2:06:26] for instance in our house and a
[2:06:28] disagreement can be Grievous to the holy
[2:06:29] spirit so you know how you disagree and
[2:06:32] how you resolve differences is a big
[2:06:34] issue and uh you know if you find
[2:06:37] yourself disagreeing a lot grieving the
[2:06:40] Holy Spirit a lot you probably need a
[2:06:42] conversation with your pastor or
[2:06:43] somebody about you know dealing with
[2:06:46] that if you've got rebellious children
[2:06:47] that's going to drive the spirit of God
[2:06:49] away
[2:06:50] um you know there's there's all kinds of
[2:06:52] things when you start to look at it but
[2:06:53] I guess you know they say when you're
[2:06:56] going to sell your house you need to do
[2:06:58] a curbside view or something what do
[2:07:00] they call it a
[2:07:01] curbside appeal so you drive by and look
[2:07:05] at it and say if I was going to buy this
[2:07:07] house what would I do to improve the
[2:07:09] look of it so that just driving by and
[2:07:11] looking at it from the curb what's
[2:07:12] appealing and what's not okay now you're
[2:07:15] probably not going to do that because
[2:07:16] every doodad you got in your yard you
[2:07:18] put there and you bought it some you
[2:07:20] know junkyard sale I'm not saying you
[2:07:22] but
[2:07:24] but if you get somebody to say drive by
[2:07:26] my house and tell me what you see that's
[2:07:29] kind of an unbiased look
[2:07:32] you know you want to have somebody give
[2:07:34] you a curb appeal look so okay uh based
[2:07:38] on the message you know what what
[2:07:41] is the message focusing on what is what
[2:07:44] is that and then you can also even talk
[2:07:46] to your children and say like my my boys
[2:07:49] are good thinkers and they were you know
[2:07:51] as they were getting older is are there
[2:07:54] things about us that we should not have
[2:07:56] here or things we shouldn't be doing as
[2:07:58] there are things someone you trust that
[2:08:00] you could talk to and say is there some
[2:08:03] way we can improve our home life our
[2:08:05] appearance everything it all matters it
[2:08:07] all goes into the mix the devil is in
[2:08:10] the details very often
[2:08:11] and and sometimes it can be little
[2:08:13] things I remember one time dealing with
[2:08:15] a girl she was at an altar in Montreal
[2:08:17] and she was at an altar praying and
[2:08:19] praying and praying and you know trying
[2:08:20] to get this breakthrough and in the
[2:08:23] spirit and she I mean it was almost
[2:08:25] midnight and she was still there at the
[2:08:26] altar and finally I went to her and I I
[2:08:29] just said you know Sister
[2:08:32] um the only thing I can tell you is that
[2:08:34] if just let just let the Holy Spirit
[2:08:36] comb back in your life and see if
[2:08:38] there's anything there that you need to
[2:08:40] get rid of in your life or anything
[2:08:42] that's holding the holy and then she
[2:08:43] stopped me right in the middle she said
[2:08:44] it's the books
[2:08:47] and I said what do you mean she said oh
[2:08:49] and she it was like it lifted off to her
[2:08:51] immediately she knew she had there was a
[2:08:53] series of books that were in her closet
[2:08:55] that she was reading and she had them in
[2:08:57] there because she was hiding him she
[2:08:58] didn't want her mother to see him and
[2:08:59] and so forth there's a youth meeting and
[2:09:02] um so she just it just it just dawned on
[2:09:05] her when it dawned on her it released
[2:09:07] her you know and she just got up and
[2:09:09] walked away Victorious and happy and
[2:09:11] went home and got rid of the books and
[2:09:13] that that free it's sometimes a little
[2:09:15] thing that you've had around so long
[2:09:16] that it doesn't really even seem to
[2:09:18] count but it did
[2:09:21] does that help
[2:09:23] anything else
[2:09:34] if if I had to do things differently my
[2:09:37] boys I would have girls
[2:09:43] that's not true I'm only joking because
[2:09:46] girls squeal and God knew what I could
[2:09:48] handle and what I couldn't so hey you
[2:09:51] come up behind me and squeal you're
[2:09:53] you're gonna get a knock in the head so
[2:09:57] um
[2:09:58] if I had my time back
[2:10:00] the raising my boys
[2:10:03] how long you got
[2:10:06] that's a great question my wife would
[2:10:09] probably be a good one to answer that
[2:10:10] one uh
[2:10:12] you know I
[2:10:17] ask them
[2:10:19] I'll give you their email addresses you
[2:10:21] want to ask them
[2:10:24] um
[2:10:26] you asked them
[2:10:29] me and you can talk later okay
[2:10:33] what did they say
[2:10:51] wow
[2:10:52] give him a 20. will you
[2:11:00] huh yeah we I mean you know it it's we
[2:11:03] worked at it it's it's not automatic and
[2:11:05] I think that's a lot of a lot of the
[2:11:07] um uh the reality that people need to uh
[2:11:10] Embrace is that it's not automatic it's
[2:11:13] the devil is not going to leave you
[2:11:15] alone say oh man they're served they're
[2:11:16] in the message I can't do anything with
[2:11:17] them that that's not true he's gonna
[2:11:20] he's gonna go after you even more so
[2:11:22] because you're set up as a Target you
[2:11:23] know and uh what would I do differently
[2:11:26] man no one's ever asked me that question
[2:11:28] before
[2:11:30] um
[2:11:42] no no there's just so many things can
[2:11:45] you identify something
[2:11:52] yeah
[2:11:55] appreciating every stage and age more
[2:11:58] every phase they go through uh that I'm
[2:12:01] saying that because your your voice is
[2:12:02] not real caring in here but my my
[2:12:05] mother-in-law always used to say me
[2:12:06] enjoy them when they're little enjoy
[2:12:08] them when they're little when when
[2:12:09] they're little or feel like killing them
[2:12:10] you know I mean because they're they're
[2:12:12] doing stupid all the time and we're
[2:12:14] thinking wow this is so frustrating we
[2:12:16] don't sleep you know I mean it was just
[2:12:18] terrible right and uh but now now I
[2:12:23] caught myself telling my one of my sons
[2:12:25] a little while ago enjoying while
[2:12:27] they're young enjoy them while they're
[2:12:28] young
[2:12:29] because it changes it changes so fast
[2:12:32] and they're they're pushing to be you
[2:12:34] ever ask a seven-year-old how old are
[2:12:36] you seven almost eight
[2:12:38] now you ask me how old I am never mind
[2:12:42] but they're wanting to be old so they're
[2:12:45] they're they're they're pushing to grow
[2:12:46] up and and you know you're wanting to
[2:12:49] grow up you know do this yourself and
[2:12:52] there's just so many demands when
[2:12:54] they're little and I think you get
[2:12:56] impatient with that but uh man I I do
[2:12:59] anything to have them back under my roof
[2:13:02] and you know live in living there I sure
[2:13:06] would in in many many ways what else
[2:13:13] we we you know I mean we had a lot of
[2:13:15] fun we did a lot of fun things and did
[2:13:17] trips and we did you know we fished and
[2:13:20] we traveled and I took him on the
[2:13:21] mission field all over the place and
[2:13:23] they I took them you know many many
[2:13:26] countries in the world sometimes just me
[2:13:27] and me and one of them or me and two of
[2:13:30] them or whatever and uh brother Bill
[2:13:32] Sanchez is here we he just reminded me
[2:13:35] of he was interpreter when I took Andrew
[2:13:37] and Peter they were quite young uh 14 15
[2:13:40] years old to Honduras you know and and
[2:13:43] he still remembers that and and uh you
[2:13:46] know they've just been everywhere and uh
[2:13:49] that's that was a great blessing you
[2:13:51] know to be able to do that I'd like to
[2:13:52] do more of that
[2:13:54] um ah man I'll have to think about that
[2:13:56] do you know anything else you could add
[2:13:57] to that
[2:13:58] I mean I that's a great question and I'm
[2:14:01] I'm not really sure of all the answers
[2:14:03] there
[2:14:04] um
[2:14:06] these are really great questions and we
[2:14:08] might get a little bit more time here as
[2:14:10] a father how would you deal with a
[2:14:13] daughter that refuses to go out with you
[2:14:15] for lunch or for dinner or on a date no
[2:14:18] matter how many times you've tried as a
[2:14:20] father the definition of insanity
[2:14:23] foreign
[2:14:25] is to try to do something over and over
[2:14:27] again and expect the same results right
[2:14:30] you know is that it different results
[2:14:32] you do the same thing over and over
[2:14:33] again if she's refusing excuse me to go
[2:14:36] out uh with you then don't ask her out I
[2:14:40] would try another way because she's got
[2:14:41] a love language that's different than
[2:14:42] what you're trying to do so you know
[2:14:45] just say hey I saw these flowers today I
[2:14:47] bought these for you hey you know have a
[2:14:50] wonderful day and just do something like
[2:14:51] that or write her a note or
[2:14:54] um you know in some way show affection
[2:14:57] and try to learn what what way affects
[2:15:02] her it may just be a compliment
[2:15:04] it may just be a gift
[2:15:07] it may just be a physical touch you know
[2:15:09] putting your arm around her and just say
[2:15:10] hey you look great today and that may be
[2:15:13] it some girls would love my
[2:15:15] granddaughters love to go out on a date
[2:15:17] with their dad and um you know that's
[2:15:20] really special to them but that's that's
[2:15:21] their language you know that's the way
[2:15:23] that they relate so you just have to
[2:15:25] keep exploring but if this way doesn't
[2:15:27] work don't keep trying to do it do
[2:15:29] something different that's that's what I
[2:15:31] would do
[2:15:32] now whoever asked me about camp ekon
[2:15:35] I want to talk to you after this is over
[2:15:38] okay I don't know who you are
[2:15:41] but I want to talk to you because I have
[2:15:43] a story about came back on So You Know
[2:15:45] Who You Are
[2:15:47] um should a Christian be involved in
[2:15:49] National politics
[2:15:51] um and and or voting and seeing the
[2:15:54] negative path that the nation is going
[2:15:56] should we teach our children to be
[2:15:58] involved and vote for candidates who
[2:16:00] support positive Christian values my
[2:16:02] goodness we need people who have good
[2:16:04] Christian values in office
[2:16:08] I said we need to have people who have
[2:16:10] good Christian values in office and if
[2:16:13] you can vote for somebody who has good
[2:16:14] Christian values and and uh see them
[2:16:17] elected that'd be great brother Branham
[2:16:18] voted I could show you the quote if you
[2:16:20] want it and he voted for Nixon and uh
[2:16:23] uh brother Branham was not a politician
[2:16:26] you know he didn't play the political
[2:16:27] game or anything like that but
[2:16:30] um I I newly became an American citizen
[2:16:33] a couple of years ago and so I was
[2:16:35] eligible to vote and I did
[2:16:37] and uh was proud of it uh I you know to
[2:16:42] me it's all in God's control
[2:16:44] but I remember this when brother Brown
[2:16:46] talked about Madeleine Murray O'Hare who
[2:16:48] we mentioned earlier and how she changed
[2:16:51] laws within our country that are the
[2:16:53] effect of those laws are still Rippling
[2:16:55] down through our time and she did that
[2:16:58] by herself you know and got support
[2:17:00] brother random asked the question back
[2:17:02] then he said where were all the
[2:17:03] ministers who should have been crying
[2:17:05] out in the wilderness
[2:17:06] where are they all he said everybody
[2:17:08] stayed silent
[2:17:09] nobody said a thing he said the preacher
[2:17:12] should have been up there first saying
[2:17:13] things about that
[2:17:14] and defending prayer and they didn't do
[2:17:17] it so I'm not a campaigner or a
[2:17:20] politician person at all but I could
[2:17:23] show you in the Bible where uh
[2:17:26] we we we should be conscious of what
[2:17:30] goes on in our little world and I I
[2:17:32] don't have time but we could I could
[2:17:34] show you that maybe later on
[2:17:35] how do you approach an older younger
[2:17:38] adult as an oxymoron isn't it
[2:17:42] it's like airplane food
[2:17:45] or Microsoft Works
[2:17:50] or death benefits
[2:17:53] how do you approach an older younger
[2:17:54] adult that indulges okay I'll handle
[2:17:57] that one we'll do that one a little bit
[2:17:59] differently and my son is a good boy and
[2:18:02] a Christian and we homeschool and it is
[2:18:05] grueling experience to get them out of
[2:18:06] bed in the morning
[2:18:09] he wants to do better
[2:18:13] can you give tips
[2:18:16] tell him to go to bed earlier
[2:18:22] um
[2:18:23] you know if he's if he's plugged into
[2:18:25] Netflix for two hours after he goes to
[2:18:27] bed
[2:18:28] uh it could be a Cause right I mean it
[2:18:31] could be something like that but uh if
[2:18:34] if there's no medical reason or anything
[2:18:36] like that uh teenagers do you know
[2:18:39] physiologically need more sleep
[2:18:41] but you know I I would be saying hey
[2:18:46] um
[2:18:49] you know in in our in our house here uh
[2:18:54] this is the way we would like to we'd
[2:18:55] like to structure set it up this way
[2:18:57] it's our responsibility school is not
[2:18:59] our not our decision it is the
[2:19:01] government's decision that every child
[2:19:03] should go to school if you were in a
[2:19:05] public school you couldn't show up at
[2:19:06] school at three o'clock in the afternoon
[2:19:07] and say okay I'm here let's start
[2:19:11] if you were working on a job you
[2:19:12] couldn't roll in at 10 30 and say all
[2:19:15] right so school is not just academics
[2:19:19] school is training for life
[2:19:21] and so uh therefore
[2:19:24] in in a sense what you're looking at is
[2:19:26] a shift
[2:19:27] of authority who's got the authority
[2:19:29] here the child is calling this shot
[2:19:33] right
[2:19:35] as a as a parent as a boss as the head
[2:19:38] of the house
[2:19:39] I think you need to probably
[2:19:42] you know
[2:19:43] Let's uh let's make some decisions here
[2:19:45] we're going to abide by it you might
[2:19:47] want to work with your young person and
[2:19:50] say hey we're not trying to make this
[2:19:52] like Stalag 13 but we're you know we do
[2:19:56] have an order in our house and we're
[2:19:58] going to ask you to respect this we'll
[2:19:59] respect you and we'll you know come to a
[2:20:02] decision here but if in the real world
[2:20:04] this is how things work
[2:20:06] and so uh this is how we're going to do
[2:20:09] it here
[2:20:13] wow
[2:20:17] for girls what's the appropriate age
[2:20:20] to continually dress them in skirts and
[2:20:22] dresses
[2:20:23] the same question for boys I have a very
[2:20:27] clear answer on that don't dress Boys in
[2:20:30] skirts and dresses
[2:20:35] I don't know if you missed that part
[2:20:37] this morning
[2:20:39] um
[2:20:41] sorry I don't mean to make fun
[2:20:45] I remember
[2:20:47] I remember years ago when one of our
[2:20:50] boys was invited to be in a wedding and
[2:20:52] they
[2:20:53] they were going to have the ring bearers
[2:20:55] they were at that age and their ring
[2:20:56] bears were going to wear shorts in the
[2:20:58] in the wedding
[2:21:00] and
[2:21:01] I I remember
[2:21:04] you know it was a decision that I made
[2:21:08] and I I thought you know they're old
[2:21:11] enough to know that difference when
[2:21:12] they're I think brother Brandman used
[2:21:14] the word toddler I think and he said you
[2:21:15] know when they're crawling and toddler
[2:21:17] and so forth he said you know the the
[2:21:18] dress distinction was not that important
[2:21:20] but as soon as they get old and
[2:21:21] conscious of the fact that what they're
[2:21:24] wearing is is different you know that's
[2:21:27] a that's an appropriate age and when you
[2:21:29] say like you know an appropriate age
[2:21:30] that's different for for kids like some
[2:21:33] kids are aware at an earlier age than
[2:21:35] others it's just like some kids go
[2:21:36] through puberty a little bit earlier
[2:21:38] than others boys generally go later than
[2:21:40] girls and and so on so sometimes it's a
[2:21:44] matter of judging the child and and
[2:21:46] looking at their uh their attitude about
[2:21:49] it and you know how they're able how
[2:21:52] they respond to that but um I I don't
[2:21:56] know that there's a definite number of
[2:21:58] an age there uh that you could you could
[2:22:01] say that all right one more if your
[2:22:02] child uh if your children are
[2:22:04] homeschooled and they would like to do
[2:22:05] Sports and extracurricular activities
[2:22:07] like music piano and guitar and so forth
[2:22:09] how do you balance keeping them in a
[2:22:10] Christian Fellowship while not
[2:22:12] Sheltering them
[2:22:14] and that's that's a great question and
[2:22:16] there's there's a lot there like
[2:22:18] um there is a just there's now more
[2:22:21] Alternatives uh available now to
[2:22:24] homeschoolers and it's not just stay at
[2:22:27] home and use you're you're excluded from
[2:22:29] every activity in the world there's lots
[2:22:31] of kids now who educate at home and are
[2:22:34] in school for labs they're in school for
[2:22:35] sports they're in school for music
[2:22:37] they're in school for band they're in
[2:22:38] school for this and that and uh I think
[2:22:40] as a parent you got to be careful about
[2:22:42] how much you involve your kids because
[2:22:43] you know they're in they're in that
[2:22:45] environment and you've gotta you gotta
[2:22:47] monitor that you got to make a decision
[2:22:49] about that
[2:22:50] um about how much you want them involved
[2:22:52] in those things in the world and just
[2:22:54] because it's popular and just because
[2:22:56] we're doing AP classes you know advanced
[2:22:58] placement and all of that that doesn't
[2:23:00] mean that's necessarily the will of God
[2:23:02] for kids because if a child is
[2:23:04] graduating from high school at 11 years
[2:23:05] old and now they're the next step is
[2:23:07] college a lot of the 11 year olds are
[2:23:10] not ready really for college
[2:23:12] and uh you know so you you you gotta you
[2:23:15] gotta really think about that and you
[2:23:17] know there's uh Bao online Bible Way
[2:23:21] Academy online my wife is a teacher
[2:23:23] she's one of the instructors and Bao and
[2:23:26] she'd be glad to answer any questions
[2:23:27] you might have about that but that's a
[2:23:29] community of message kids they're just
[2:23:32] message kids from all over the world uh
[2:23:35] New Zealand Australia and Europe and
[2:23:37] Canada and U.S and uh that is a
[2:23:40] registered I mean that's a regular
[2:23:41] school they do it online she teaches for
[2:23:43] two different academies my wife does and
[2:23:46] one of them is the bao and it's all
[2:23:49] message kids so it's a nice community
[2:23:52] and they have uh I do devotionals
[2:23:54] sometimes for them and all the kids
[2:23:55] around the world are plugged in I can
[2:23:57] see them on my screen and uh it was
[2:24:00] Jason Watkins did the last one uh their
[2:24:02] last devotional and uh it's operated out
[2:24:06] of the U.S and it's a very incredible
[2:24:08] School excellent teachers and they have
[2:24:11] uh music I got some parents of students
[2:24:14] here and they do music they do
[2:24:17] activities they do programs they do
[2:24:20] drama singing and all kinds of things
[2:24:23] and they can do it online now you know
[2:24:24] it's pretty neat uh all the stuff they
[2:24:27] can do online so
[2:24:28] uh you don't have to have your kids
[2:24:31] enrolled in a public school to do some
[2:24:33] of that extracurricular activity uh
[2:24:35] there are other avenues now that you can
[2:24:37] do that but uh if if you have a question
[2:24:40] related to that my wife is here she's uh
[2:24:42] I I consider her to be an expert in that
[2:24:44] area uh in home education online
[2:24:47] education which is different uh than
[2:24:50] just doing a course on the internet uh
[2:24:53] online learning is a different animal
[2:24:55] altogether and she's considered to be an
[2:24:57] expert in that and uh so and we've also
[2:25:01] homeschooled four of our boys and uh so
[2:25:04] forth so she's got the scars to prove a
[2:25:07] lot of that stuff so I'll defer
[2:25:09] homeschool questions to her and you're
[2:25:10] certainly welcome to pick her brain
[2:25:12] because she's got a lot of information
[2:25:13] good suggestions and some alternatives
[2:25:16] for for that but Bao online is a good
[2:25:19] community of message believing kids that
[2:25:21] uh that are something worth looking at
[2:25:24] if you're if you're interested in that
[2:25:26] okay let's let's jump in because we're
[2:25:29] going to run out of time here Proverbs
[2:25:31] chapter 24 uh the scripture says through
[2:25:34] skillful I mean I'm I'm on page eight uh
[2:25:37] in your book here through wisdom is in
[2:25:39] house build it and by understanding it
[2:25:41] is established by knowledge shall the
[2:25:43] chambers be filled with all precious
[2:25:45] Pleasant riches a wise man a strong yea
[2:25:48] a man of knowledge increases strength
[2:25:50] for by wise counsel Thou shalt make thy
[2:25:53] War
[2:25:54] and in the multitude of counselors
[2:25:56] there's safety
[2:26:00] here it is in the Amplified version I
[2:26:02] like this
[2:26:03] do skillful and godly wisdom as a house
[2:26:05] a life or a home and a family so a house
[2:26:09] is a generic term for what goes on
[2:26:12] inside the building okay biblically
[2:26:15] speaking
[2:26:17] and by understanding it is established
[2:26:19] on a sound and good foundation that's
[2:26:21] your part your part
[2:26:23] and by knowledge shall its chambers of
[2:26:25] every area be filled with all precious
[2:26:27] and pleasant riches and a wise man is
[2:26:30] strong and is better than a strong man A
[2:26:32] wise man is better than the strong man
[2:26:34] and a man of knowledge increases and
[2:26:37] strengthens his power
[2:26:39] for by wise counsel you can wage your
[2:26:41] warn in the abundance of counselors
[2:26:43] there is Victory and safety brother
[2:26:46] Brandon prayed help us this morning Lord
[2:26:48] to take Corrections from the spirit and
[2:26:50] the word that we might prepare ourselves
[2:26:52] as we move away from the doors this
[2:26:54] morning determining our heart to live a
[2:26:56] better life than we have in the past I
[2:26:59] think that's a great prayer to start
[2:27:01] what we're doing here today this
[2:27:04] afternoon
[2:27:04] so I've mentioned this already we're
[2:27:07] coming back to the definition here just
[2:27:08] as just a refresher uh Christian family
[2:27:11] is a group of people who are
[2:27:13] truly related to each other through
[2:27:16] marriage birth and adoption and are
[2:27:18] committed first and foremost to the
[2:27:20] person on the work of Christ
[2:27:21] Faithfully witnessing to the love and
[2:27:23] power and the forgiveness
[2:27:25] of God you can fill in these blanks here
[2:27:28] I left those blank in your in your
[2:27:30] booklet there
[2:27:32] um my house is a place where the holy
[2:27:35] spirit's always welcome
[2:27:36] it's a place that's separate from Sodom
[2:27:39] and it's a place where preparations are
[2:27:41] made to leave this world
[2:27:43] all right we're going to look at four
[2:27:44] pillars of corrective discipline and
[2:27:45] this is going to focus this afternoon
[2:27:47] for a little bit here on the subject of
[2:27:49] discipline and this is a kind of a
[2:27:51] disappearing art
[2:27:53] uh in our in our culture because as I've
[2:27:56] said there's a massive shift to giving
[2:27:59] kids Authority and to give and being
[2:28:01] passive when it comes to discipline
[2:28:04] um and it does not work
[2:28:06] in the long run it does not work and
[2:28:09] even in the short run it doesn't work
[2:28:12] and therefore there are different types
[2:28:15] of discipline I am I will tell you out
[2:28:18] of the gate I'm not I'm not soft
[2:28:22] towards anyone who is abusive to their
[2:28:25] children
[2:28:26] and we should get this out of the way
[2:28:28] that I don't think that making your kids
[2:28:29] drink vinegar and hurting your kids
[2:28:33] marking your kids
[2:28:35] causing excess pain for your kids any
[2:28:39] kind of verbal physical or emotional
[2:28:41] abuse is abuse
[2:28:43] and you have to be very careful today in
[2:28:46] our world because the word abuse is
[2:28:48] thrown around a lot more freely and you
[2:28:50] can get in trouble very quickly if you
[2:28:52] want to spank your kids in the parking
[2:28:54] lot of Target because they got a camera
[2:28:56] on you
[2:28:57] and I have a brother in my church who's
[2:28:59] a management person a Target and I will
[2:29:01] tell you they have cameras and uh you
[2:29:04] you need to be very wise in relation to
[2:29:06] discipline and how you do it because uh
[2:29:10] you can get in trouble real quick
[2:29:12] and you can make somebody mad and the
[2:29:16] tide can turn very quickly on you so in
[2:29:19] our world today there's a lot of people
[2:29:21] who are against what I'm going to tell
[2:29:22] you and you have to yet yet you have to
[2:29:27] fulfill the Mandate given to you as
[2:29:29] parents because you're acting uh as a
[2:29:32] representative of the kingdom and in the
[2:29:34] Kingdom there are no spoiled brats
[2:29:38] right
[2:29:39] okay so if there's no spoiled brats in
[2:29:41] the Kingdom thy will be done on Earth as
[2:29:44] it is in heaven
[2:29:46] right thy will be done on Earth as it is
[2:29:48] in heaven
[2:29:50] and so therefore our actions should be a
[2:29:52] reflection of what goes on in the
[2:29:53] Kingdom
[2:29:54] okay and
[2:29:56] you had to be mindful of two things at
[2:29:59] the same time you're living in a fallen
[2:30:01] world and uh there's there's you have an
[2:30:04] enemy here in this world that would like
[2:30:05] to Corner you and intimidate you and
[2:30:08] stop you from doing the right things and
[2:30:09] the biblical things in our world we have
[2:30:12] an enemy Prince of the power of the air
[2:30:14] but we also have a boss who's watching
[2:30:17] us and uh he's given you those children
[2:30:20] he hasn't given those children to uh
[2:30:23] your pastor he hasn't given the children
[2:30:25] to the Sunday school teacher he hasn't
[2:30:27] given those kids to your the kids
[2:30:29] teacher he's given those kids to you
[2:30:31] and so you have to take the initiative
[2:30:34] to raise the kids in a Biblical way so
[2:30:36] let's look at this spiritual discipline
[2:30:39] is first of all a discipline of the
[2:30:42] heart
[2:30:43] and that's that's mainly I would say how
[2:30:46] God deals with us
[2:30:48] that you can hear something and be under
[2:30:51] conviction and God wants you to change
[2:30:55] and or repent and or adjust because it's
[2:30:59] in the word
[2:31:00] right
[2:31:01] many times like you coming here you're
[2:31:04] hearing things that you realize oh wow
[2:31:07] you know what I hate it but he's right
[2:31:10] and you realize I we've been kicking
[2:31:12] that can down the road we need to change
[2:31:15] that about our household we need to tell
[2:31:17] our you know deal with our kids over
[2:31:19] this subject that's a discipline of the
[2:31:21] heart
[2:31:22] and you're doing it because the word
[2:31:24] says not because brother Barry does that
[2:31:27] not because my pastor tells me that I'm
[2:31:29] doing it because the word says so we we
[2:31:32] make changes based on Bible and message
[2:31:35] principles
[2:31:36] and the ultimate aim and that's that's
[2:31:39] what God does he disciplines us to
[2:31:43] create or Foster a better relationship
[2:31:45] between you and him
[2:31:47] so you want to create a better
[2:31:49] relationship between you and your kids
[2:31:51] but ultimately your kids in Christ
[2:31:54] okay so yeah how how we do that is
[2:31:57] important so
[2:31:59] Hebrews 12 says he have not resisted
[2:32:01] unto blood striving and this is a
[2:32:03] chapter about discipline here
[2:32:06] and ye have forgotten the exhortation
[2:32:08] which speaketh unto you as children
[2:32:10] my son despise not thou the chastening
[2:32:13] of the Lord
[2:32:14] hold on to that word chasten nor faint
[2:32:17] when thou art rebuked of him
[2:32:19] despise not it's easy to despise
[2:32:24] the chastening of an elder of a father
[2:32:27] or mother
[2:32:28] but he says despise not thou the
[2:32:30] chastening of the Lord nor faint when
[2:32:32] thou art rebuked of him for whom the
[2:32:34] Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth
[2:32:37] every son whom he receiveth
[2:32:39] so this is God's way this is the process
[2:32:41] of going through adoption
[2:32:44] and that's another story in itself but
[2:32:46] the word chasten here
[2:32:48] it it is the Greek word Padilla and this
[2:32:52] is um
[2:32:53] this is a really important word and it
[2:32:56] means
[2:32:58] so chastening now means the whole
[2:33:01] training and education of a child
[2:33:04] which relates to the cultivation of mind
[2:33:06] and morals
[2:33:09] and employs
[2:33:11] for this purpose
[2:33:13] commands and admonitions
[2:33:16] reproof and Punishment
[2:33:18] it also includes the training and care
[2:33:20] of the body
[2:33:21] so when we talk about chastening our
[2:33:24] children it is everything that's
[2:33:26] involved in shaping them into the adult
[2:33:28] they're supposed to be
[2:33:31] the the formation you were talking about
[2:33:34] formation here we're trying to remove
[2:33:37] bad ideas
[2:33:39] and put in good ideas we're trying to
[2:33:41] remove bad habits and put in good habits
[2:33:44] we're trying to take out immoral
[2:33:46] thoughts and and expose them to good
[2:33:49] moral principles
[2:33:51] and we employ everything we have in
[2:33:53] order to do that
[2:33:55] so when you chasten your children this
[2:33:57] is a an ongoing long-term training
[2:34:02] and care of themselves because they they
[2:34:06] need to learn about how to conduct
[2:34:07] themselves in public they need to learn
[2:34:09] how they they should talk and respond to
[2:34:12] adults they should learn how to look
[2:34:14] after their clean up their room
[2:34:17] um all right listen
[2:34:19] I remember one time we were going
[2:34:21] somewhere and I was I was I had all the
[2:34:23] boys with me they're all still small and
[2:34:24] I remember walking down the sidewalk and
[2:34:26] I was going into a store and they were
[2:34:28] kind of piling in on top of one another
[2:34:30] and you know pushing ahead of their mom
[2:34:32] and everything else I said hey hey stop
[2:34:35] stop
[2:34:37] dupids
[2:34:39] come out here and I had them sit down on
[2:34:41] a bench and I said what if somebody was
[2:34:43] looking at us and how you're acting
[2:34:44] you're acting like a bunch of monkeys on
[2:34:47] steroids
[2:34:50] and I said how would it how would it
[2:34:52] how do you think people would look at us
[2:34:54] and say wow we're just a bunch of
[2:34:55] ramshackle kids and then you know they
[2:34:58] were dressed poorly and everything it
[2:35:00] wasn't a formal thing that we were doing
[2:35:01] but you know I said it is important for
[2:35:03] us to to present ourselves in a in a
[2:35:07] better way than what we're doing here
[2:35:09] and I'm not just talking about dress
[2:35:10] here but I'm talking about your conduct
[2:35:12] and how you're treating one another and
[2:35:13] you know I mean I was there first I had
[2:35:15] to handle first no you know I'll kill
[2:35:17] you hey
[2:35:21] I said you know the Bible says in
[2:35:23] Timothy that Paul told Timothy be thou
[2:35:26] an example
[2:35:27] of the Believers in word and conduct and
[2:35:30] faith and so forth be thou an example of
[2:35:33] the Believers
[2:35:35] doesn't say be thou an example to the
[2:35:37] Believers it says be an example of the
[2:35:39] Believers
[2:35:40] so in other words what that means is
[2:35:42] that I could be able to go around among
[2:35:44] this room in a room full of Believers
[2:35:46] and say Here's what the message produces
[2:35:48] in a set of parents
[2:35:51] you would be an example of the Believers
[2:35:54] who are parents
[2:35:55] and I should be able to go to my boys
[2:35:57] and say here's an example of a good
[2:35:59] Christian family here's what this boy
[2:36:01] should look like and I said are you
[2:36:03] acting that way and I I we I set about
[2:36:06] to put in print in place some of these
[2:36:07] principles here uh that we're talking
[2:36:09] about here so whatever you can do what
[2:36:12] everything that's involved in the
[2:36:14] training and education of children that
[2:36:15] might be homeschooling everybody's not a
[2:36:17] homeschooler but that might be
[2:36:18] homeschooling it might be having
[2:36:20] devotions every day in your household it
[2:36:23] might be uh you know uh take you know
[2:36:26] thinking about vacations and doing that
[2:36:28] better and whatever it is giving your
[2:36:30] kids an allowance and helping them set a
[2:36:32] budget a real simple budget this is for
[2:36:34] God this is for long-term savings this
[2:36:36] is for spending and do something real
[2:36:38] simple uh you know with their money
[2:36:40] because they're going to learn that
[2:36:41] that's a life principle they're going to
[2:36:42] learn whatever is involved in the
[2:36:44] training that's what the scripture tells
[2:36:46] us that we should do number two whatever
[2:36:47] in adults also cultivates the Soul by
[2:36:50] correcting mistakes and curbing passions
[2:36:52] hey that's still needs to be taught
[2:36:55] we as adults there are things that we
[2:36:58] still are learning and number three
[2:36:59] instruction anything that increases
[2:37:02] virtue anything that increases virtue is
[2:37:05] a good thing
[2:37:07] think about what what what uh you know
[2:37:10] of examples of that anything that
[2:37:11] increases virtue is a good thing is
[2:37:13] needed in our society
[2:37:15] so families had to make a decision about
[2:37:18] what we allow our kids to do what are
[2:37:20] kids going to participate in
[2:37:22] so we're going to monitor especially in
[2:37:24] the early years we're going to monitor
[2:37:26] their friendships we're going to look at
[2:37:28] their dress their music their media
[2:37:30] their choices that they make in relation
[2:37:31] to that and then their choices and
[2:37:33] relationships because we want to
[2:37:35] encourage them to find uh to find a good
[2:37:39] mate we're going to encourage them to
[2:37:41] look for character and you know all of
[2:37:44] those things are are going to be
[2:37:45] upcoming and so we're going to establish
[2:37:48] these priorities here and help our kids
[2:37:51] to learn to make those good decisions
[2:37:52] part of it is how we do make those
[2:37:55] decisions ourselves
[2:37:57] and in Psalm 101 David says I will
[2:38:00] behave myself wisely in a perfect way
[2:38:02] and a will will all win will Thou come
[2:38:05] unto me I will walk within my house of
[2:38:07] the perfect heart man that's a great
[2:38:10] goal Lord help me to walk in my house
[2:38:12] with a perfect heart
[2:38:15] that's not a Heart full of anger all the
[2:38:17] time that's not a Heart full of uh you
[2:38:20] know leave me alone don't bother me
[2:38:22] that's that's walking within a perfect
[2:38:24] heart so I'm always looking at my family
[2:38:26] a certain way
[2:38:28] and in order to do that in order to walk
[2:38:32] within your house in a perfect way there
[2:38:34] are things that you're going to have to
[2:38:35] learn and adjust and be committed to in
[2:38:37] order to accomplish that in your house
[2:38:40] and and in the Hebrew language these
[2:38:43] words I'm just skipping here because I
[2:38:46] want to go quickly
[2:38:47] these are our words here for parent
[2:38:50] teacher tutor instructor father in the
[2:38:53] Hebrew language you'll see on the right
[2:38:54] hand side and you had trust me with this
[2:38:57] about the Hebrew language
[2:38:59] many of these words in the Hebrew
[2:39:02] letters look similar
[2:39:04] and that's intended
[2:39:06] in the biblical phraseology that's
[2:39:08] intended so there's not much difference
[2:39:11] between a parent and a teacher
[2:39:13] and a father and a tutor
[2:39:16] and an instructor and a tutor all of
[2:39:19] these words are in a sense they're
[2:39:21] they're constructed or composed with the
[2:39:24] same thought process from God okay
[2:39:27] that's the point and if we added another
[2:39:30] one here father God or Elohim you will
[2:39:32] find that those letters are almost
[2:39:34] identical as well I don't have that I
[2:39:36] didn't have that screen but if you added
[2:39:38] a fourth one here so our our God is a
[2:39:42] father we know him as father right we
[2:39:44] know him as tutor we know him as a guide
[2:39:47] and those letters in his name are very
[2:39:50] similar to the letters that are in your
[2:39:52] job description brother as a parent
[2:39:54] father teacher tutor instructor
[2:39:57] so God has placed an attribute of a
[2:40:01] teacher instructor guide in the heart of
[2:40:04] a father to help lead that family
[2:40:08] because if you don't
[2:40:10] that family is going to stray
[2:40:15] I was in a country recently where they
[2:40:18] had a pastor early in the arrival of the
[2:40:21] message in the early message years
[2:40:24] and uh
[2:40:25] lo and behold the people who came to the
[2:40:28] message in that Nation not a big nation
[2:40:31] not a lot of people but the people who
[2:40:33] came into that message community that
[2:40:36] environment
[2:40:38] didn't stick around Long kids got to be
[2:40:40] 17 18 years old and they all drifted off
[2:40:42] they're all out in the world now
[2:40:44] and lo and behold without any
[2:40:47] significant growth in that church they
[2:40:48] found out that the pastor was committing
[2:40:50] adultery with somebody in the church
[2:40:53] and as a result the Holy Spirit couldn't
[2:40:54] really honor his ministry and his
[2:40:57] ministry to the people and as a result
[2:41:00] the people never broke through to a real
[2:41:02] New Birth and so when the pressures and
[2:41:05] the influences of the world became too
[2:41:06] strong they just drifted away you know
[2:41:08] what the problem was the problem was at
[2:41:10] the top
[2:41:12] you say well those are bad kids well you
[2:41:14] know what those kids might have had a
[2:41:16] better Fighting Chance
[2:41:18] and a better atmosphere because brother
[2:41:19] Graham said the atmosphere brings the
[2:41:21] birth right
[2:41:22] so he's destroyed the Atmosphere by his
[2:41:25] sinful condition and we got to go right
[2:41:28] to the top in order to correct this he's
[2:41:31] gone there's another young man who's
[2:41:33] there and doing a great job he's he's
[2:41:34] doing a great job and I was there and
[2:41:37] ministered and man just the Holy Spirit
[2:41:39] moving in that assembly and I thought
[2:41:41] wow this this is what this needs
[2:41:44] because now young people really getting
[2:41:46] something in these in these services in
[2:41:49] the meetings and the environment here
[2:41:50] and families growing up and you see
[2:41:52] backsliders coming back into it again
[2:41:54] what's the difference we got a different
[2:41:56] headship
[2:41:57] right
[2:41:59] all right bring it down to scale your
[2:42:01] family who's God going to deal with
[2:42:03] first
[2:42:04] in your household when it comes to
[2:42:06] Authority and responsibility for what
[2:42:07] goes on who's he going to deal with
[2:42:09] first not your kids
[2:42:12] he's going to deal with the father
[2:42:15] so God has two ways of getting your
[2:42:17] attention as a dad
[2:42:19] number one he's going to deal with your
[2:42:22] job
[2:42:23] if God wants to get a man's attention
[2:42:25] he'll kick the legs out from underneath
[2:42:27] your job
[2:42:28] and all of a sudden the man is left
[2:42:30] floating because hey that's who I am
[2:42:31] right
[2:42:33] it's not really but a lot of times we
[2:42:35] spend a lot of time at work so that
[2:42:37] really gets a man's attention what do I
[2:42:39] do now
[2:42:40] and the second thing that the way that
[2:42:42] he's going to deal with a man is through
[2:42:43] his spouse
[2:42:45] and when something goes wrong with the
[2:42:46] spouse that man knows it right and he
[2:42:50] has he prays a little bit differently
[2:42:51] when there's something wrong with his
[2:42:52] job or his spouse
[2:42:54] for a woman God will deal with her a
[2:42:56] little bit differently one of the things
[2:42:58] that he'll do is affect the relationship
[2:43:00] the spouse
[2:43:01] and when there's problems between
[2:43:03] husband and wife that wife will pray a
[2:43:05] little bit differently than she normally
[2:43:06] does and then also with her children
[2:43:09] something goes wrong with their children
[2:43:11] a woman is really affected by that
[2:43:13] because God puts something in the heart
[2:43:14] of a mother that is not like anything
[2:43:16] else I mean men don't have it I don't
[2:43:19] care what you say men don't have the
[2:43:20] same feeling towards their kids that
[2:43:22] women have God put that in there in the
[2:43:24] heart of a woman
[2:43:26] I remember our neighbor we have a
[2:43:28] neighbor next to us and they're not
[2:43:30] Believers at all but they have one
[2:43:32] little child and then they had we're
[2:43:34] having another child she was expecting
[2:43:35] and this child died at 26 weeks just one
[2:43:39] day it's fine next day it's dead in her
[2:43:41] womb they don't know why
[2:43:42] and it just happened it was devastating
[2:43:44] obviously for for them and you know uh
[2:43:48] she had to give birth to the child and
[2:43:50] they asked me would I do the funeral
[2:43:52] because they don't have a church and
[2:43:53] they asked me would I do the funeral
[2:43:55] and so the coffin is this big right big
[2:43:58] as a shoebox
[2:44:00] and so we went to the funeral and
[2:44:02] graveside we just had a graveside and I
[2:44:04] was there and uh it was me and two of
[2:44:06] them
[2:44:07] and and the funeral home director that's
[2:44:10] always there and we're just sitting in
[2:44:12] the middle of this big field and they
[2:44:14] were they were sitting there so I just
[2:44:16] pulled up a chair and I I gave him a
[2:44:19] couple of scriptures you know and we
[2:44:21] were just I was just talking a little
[2:44:22] bit about
[2:44:24] um you know not trying to fret over why
[2:44:26] this happened you know and all the other
[2:44:28] parts of it but I said in the Indian
[2:44:30] tradition in the Lakota tribes I said
[2:44:34] they have a an understanding they said I
[2:44:38] I told her this I said now this is not
[2:44:39] biblical but I said I'm just telling you
[2:44:42] what their tradition is
[2:44:44] and I said that in among the Indians
[2:44:47] they believed that when a woman gives
[2:44:49] birth or
[2:44:50] mothers a child into the world
[2:44:54] the Indians believe that there is
[2:44:56] actually a little part of that mother in
[2:44:58] the child
[2:45:00] so when that child goes through life it
[2:45:04] carries
[2:45:05] a certain
[2:45:06] something of her in life you can never
[2:45:10] forget that you know you can never
[2:45:12] separate that that's something that uh
[2:45:16] the Indians believe that a mother
[2:45:17] actually imparts something to her child
[2:45:20] but the child also imparts something in
[2:45:22] the mother
[2:45:23] and there's a there's a almost like a
[2:45:27] deposit that's the way they describe it
[2:45:28] this is Indian lore
[2:45:30] and I said that's why when we lose a
[2:45:33] child
[2:45:34] it is so devastating for a mother
[2:45:36] because it's almost like a part of her
[2:45:38] has died
[2:45:39] a part of her was in that child and some
[2:45:42] of your moms are looking at me shaking
[2:45:43] your heads in the green because there's
[2:45:44] something if something happens that a
[2:45:47] child it's like it happened to me
[2:45:50] and and vice versa there's just some
[2:45:54] vital connection that God makes between
[2:45:56] a mother and child that is different
[2:45:58] than how it is for a man I told the
[2:46:00] husband I said John you don't feel this
[2:46:03] and I don't feel this about my children
[2:46:05] but your wife does feel this and she
[2:46:07] agreed with that and it's it's a
[2:46:10] heartbreaking thing because a mother
[2:46:11] feels it in a different way than what
[2:46:14] husbands would
[2:46:15] and it is a uh you know it's a
[2:46:20] it's a very real thing when it comes to
[2:46:23] you know heaven heaven that uh
[2:46:25] connection with with their children for
[2:46:27] sure now let me just let me just go on
[2:46:30] number two if if the first thing is
[2:46:32] correction by the word or spiritual
[2:46:34] correction
[2:46:36] the second thing is the verbal
[2:46:38] and it's actually getting the heart and
[2:46:40] soul and the mind working in the same
[2:46:41] direction
[2:46:43] so all right we know what the word says
[2:46:47] but are we actually going to do that
[2:46:49] I told you to go clean up your room well
[2:46:51] all right we know that's what the word
[2:46:53] says remember Jesus gives the parable he
[2:46:56] says there were two sons and one of them
[2:46:58] the father said would you go and uh you
[2:47:01] know clean on just paraphrasing go and
[2:47:03] do an errand for me and the son says no
[2:47:06] I'm not going to do that but he goes and
[2:47:07] does it anyway after a while he goes and
[2:47:09] does it anyway and he says to this other
[2:47:11] son you go and do this Aaron for me and
[2:47:13] he says sure I'll do that Dad and never
[2:47:15] does
[2:47:17] because their heart and mind is not are
[2:47:19] not working in sync until they come in
[2:47:21] sync and so the son who was told what to
[2:47:23] do actually did it now we've got them
[2:47:25] kind of lined up okay
[2:47:28] so it's the actual getting the heart and
[2:47:30] the soul in the mind working in the in
[2:47:32] the same direction so brother random
[2:47:34] says Lord tender our hearts so that
[2:47:36] we'll know how to behave ourselves and
[2:47:38] act correcting ourselves and bringing
[2:47:41] the members of our body into discipline
[2:47:43] to the word
[2:47:44] so it's one thing to hear the word and
[2:47:46] you can be hearing the right thing but
[2:47:47] not doing the right thing
[2:47:49] so you want to pray and this is what
[2:47:50] brother Ram is praying here that we will
[2:47:52] correct ourselves and bring our bodies
[2:47:55] into discipline of the word that we
[2:47:57] might know how to live in a way that
[2:47:58] pleases God does that make sense
[2:48:00] so that's what we're that's what we're
[2:48:02] to do and that's what we're to do with
[2:48:04] our children
[2:48:06] so this is not new in Deuteronomy
[2:48:08] chapter 6 hero Israel the Lord your God
[2:48:10] is one Lord
[2:48:12] now watch what he says I use this
[2:48:14] passage a lot interestingly enough
[2:48:17] Jesus quoted out of Deuteronomy more
[2:48:19] than any other book in his Earthly
[2:48:21] Ministry in his teaching
[2:48:23] Deuteronomy is a great book there's lots
[2:48:25] of lessons in here
[2:48:26] and thou shalt love the Lord thy God
[2:48:28] with all thine heart this is
[2:48:30] instructions going into the into the
[2:48:32] kingdom going into the promised land
[2:48:34] thou shall love the Lord with thy God
[2:48:36] with all thine heart and with all thy
[2:48:38] soul and with all thy might and these
[2:48:39] worship words without command thee this
[2:48:41] day shall be in your children's heart
[2:48:44] no
[2:48:46] vinehart
[2:48:49] so it's got to be in your heart before
[2:48:51] you teach it to anybody
[2:48:52] it's got to be in your heart before you
[2:48:54] show anybody else okay you understand
[2:48:56] what he's saying you're the father
[2:48:58] you're the leader here but it's got to
[2:49:00] be in your heart first and then you can
[2:49:03] influence your children
[2:49:05] then he says in seven and thou shalt
[2:49:07] teach them diligently unto thy children
[2:49:10] oh yeah what does diligently mean it
[2:49:13] means this
[2:49:14] we're going to sharpen
[2:49:16] the word diligent is the Hebrew word for
[2:49:18] sharpen
[2:49:19] you know how you sharpen the knife
[2:49:21] you know how you're sharpen something
[2:49:24] you do this
[2:49:27] you rub it
[2:49:29] takes a little while
[2:49:30] you're gonna rub it get yourself an edge
[2:49:33] You're Gonna Keep rubbing it
[2:49:35] until it gets nice and sharp
[2:49:37] then you're going to use it and guess
[2:49:39] what don't
[2:49:41] then guess what after a while it gets
[2:49:43] dull you know what we're going to do
[2:49:45] then we're gonna take it back and
[2:49:47] sharpen it again
[2:49:49] that's what that's what Moses is telling
[2:49:52] the people there
[2:49:53] now she'll teach them diligently unto
[2:49:55] thy children
[2:49:57] so we're going to teach our children the
[2:49:59] principles and you know what they're
[2:50:01] going to grow a little they're going to
[2:50:03] feel like now we know everything we're
[2:50:05] going to take it back we're going to
[2:50:06] we're going to whittle away a little bit
[2:50:08] more right then they become teenagers
[2:50:11] then they know everything all right
[2:50:15] raising teenagers is kind of like trying
[2:50:17] to nail Jello to a tree it's really hard
[2:50:23] but he says you've got to have this in
[2:50:26] your heart first and then you're going
[2:50:28] to teach your children over time and
[2:50:30] we're not going to do it just once we're
[2:50:32] going to do it over and over again
[2:50:35] we're going to teach them when we go in
[2:50:37] the nine house Thou shalt talk to them
[2:50:39] when I sit us in nine house and when I
[2:50:40] walk Us by the way and when they'll lie
[2:50:42] is down when they Rises up there's two
[2:50:44] words in the Hebrew for talking
[2:50:46] for speech
[2:50:47] and they're like this one is the formal
[2:50:51] way that God spoke to prophets and
[2:50:54] Prophets spoke the say of the Lord thou
[2:50:57] shall repent Israel or perish right
[2:51:00] that's the way Prophet spoke and that's
[2:51:01] the way God speaks to Prophets
[2:51:03] this other kind of speaking here is not
[2:51:06] that
[2:51:08] the other kind is casual conversational
[2:51:10] everyday talk that you would have with
[2:51:13] your family so you don't say and I do
[2:51:16] this for fun to my grandchildren all the
[2:51:17] time but I didn't say to my boys Thou
[2:51:19] shalt
[2:51:21] thus saith the Lord Thou shalt come
[2:51:23] before me right now kneel
[2:51:25] and repent lest thou be smitten from the
[2:51:29] Earth
[2:51:31] you don't go into the Butcher and say
[2:51:32] thou shalt produce
[2:51:34] six pork chops for me
[2:51:37] lest thou die
[2:51:39] right we don't talk that way
[2:51:42] I mean you shouldn't
[2:51:45] this is not that this is
[2:51:48] Thou shalt talk of them
[2:51:51] you know what everyday conversation
[2:51:53] round the table this is like hey you
[2:51:56] know what we include God in everything
[2:51:58] we do
[2:52:00] our conversation is christ-centered but
[2:52:03] it's not it's not
[2:52:05] condemnation it's not formal it's just
[2:52:09] hey this is Who We Are
[2:52:11] this is what we are we're Christians so
[2:52:15] you know what you got a test coming up
[2:52:17] we'll pray we got a financial problem
[2:52:19] let's pray we dad is in the in
[2:52:22] threatened to lose his job you know all
[2:52:24] these Chinese people walking around the
[2:52:26] plant
[2:52:26] all of a sudden
[2:52:28] let's pray
[2:52:31] how do Christians handle Financial
[2:52:33] stress how do Christians handle a job
[2:52:35] layoff how do Christians and we just
[2:52:37] bought a van
[2:52:39] and how do Christians communicate with
[2:52:42] one with another so he's he's not saying
[2:52:45] that you need to have this distance from
[2:52:47] your children you've got to be where
[2:52:49] they are
[2:52:50] you want you want to talk to them right
[2:52:52] where they are and you want to
[2:52:54] communicate with them in that way now I
[2:52:57] love this statement here this kind of
[2:52:59] became the basis for men's meetings but
[2:53:02] look here
[2:53:03] brother man was talking about Elijah and
[2:53:05] Elisha and the transition between Elijah
[2:53:08] and Elijah Elijah the prophet who had
[2:53:11] the mantle of God came and laid it
[2:53:12] across Elisha the farmer to see if it
[2:53:15] would fit him
[2:53:16] you know why Elijah Elijah picked Elisha
[2:53:20] anybody know
[2:53:21] what quality did Elisha have that Elijah
[2:53:24] saw in him
[2:53:27] he was a farmer
[2:53:30] brother Branham said Elijah Elisha
[2:53:33] knew how to plow in a straight line
[2:53:38] and that's what Elijah saw
[2:53:40] and he said if he could plow in a
[2:53:42] straight line it means he could handle
[2:53:43] the word straight
[2:53:46] he could preach it straight that's what
[2:53:48] he said
[2:53:49] so he goes and he throws this mantle
[2:53:51] over Elisha and brother man said it took
[2:53:54] him about 10 years
[2:53:57] to get altered to fit the mantle
[2:54:01] now God usually puts us in the shop and
[2:54:03] trims us up but he didn't alter the robe
[2:54:06] to fit Elisha he altered Elisha to fit
[2:54:10] the robe
[2:54:14] and that's what he does today
[2:54:18] he Alters us to fit the robe not the
[2:54:22] robe to fit us
[2:54:24] wow sometimes we want to make the robe
[2:54:28] fit us but we can't do that sometimes
[2:54:31] your kids want to get married they're
[2:54:32] like I'm 16 been a bridesmaid not
[2:54:34] married yet
[2:54:36] hello
[2:54:37] dad let me go with this guy right
[2:54:40] unless you live in Arkansas or West
[2:54:42] Virginia hey it doesn't matter you can
[2:54:44] be older
[2:54:48] and we want to make the rope in other
[2:54:50] words we want to do things faster than
[2:54:51] what we're ready for but God's actually
[2:54:53] shaping you to fit a responsibility a
[2:54:56] job a commission that he's got for you
[2:54:58] if you're meant to be a father you'll be
[2:55:00] a father but you've got to let God deal
[2:55:02] with you until then right
[2:55:04] and and this is this is that this
[2:55:06] principle is applied in lots of
[2:55:08] different ways but he says you've got to
[2:55:10] be altered yourself for that robe it's
[2:55:11] God's robe and he made it perfect and
[2:55:13] he's going to bring us into that realm
[2:55:16] to make the robe fit us
[2:55:18] wow so God's actually shaping you as a
[2:55:22] parent even and as a Christian to fit
[2:55:24] the role that he has for you and your
[2:55:27] job is to help fit shape those children
[2:55:29] because there's a role for them to play
[2:55:31] later right so when we talk about my
[2:55:34] boys you know when you're looking at the
[2:55:35] bent you're looking at the the gifts and
[2:55:38] talents that God's put in there uh you
[2:55:40] know it's one thing for me as a parent
[2:55:42] to see that bent in my child but you
[2:55:44] want them to see that the trouble is
[2:55:46] God's put it in them and they look at it
[2:55:48] as very normal that's the way I am
[2:55:49] that's who I am but you know what they
[2:55:51] got to recognize ah this is what God's
[2:55:53] called me this is probably what God's
[2:55:54] put in me and this is how I can serve
[2:55:56] the body this is how I can be effective
[2:55:58] in the Kingdom this is how I can I can
[2:56:00] do this for the rest of my life you know
[2:56:02] and they need to kind of recognize that
[2:56:04] that's God shaping them for the role
[2:56:06] that they have and as a parent you don't
[2:56:08] want to be doing the opposite and say my
[2:56:10] goodness you're a loser you'll never
[2:56:12] amount to anything yeah that listen you
[2:56:14] should just quit now or why don't you
[2:56:16] why don't you just you know go uh wash
[2:56:19] dishes at Wendy's or something because
[2:56:20] you'll never amount to anything
[2:56:24] or you're let me tell you the way that
[2:56:26] you dress and conduct yourself you'll
[2:56:27] never find a good man you'll never
[2:56:29] you'll never amount to anything you'll
[2:56:30] never be a mother like your mother was
[2:56:32] and
[2:56:35] yeah you're shaping somebody
[2:56:41] today our problem brother random said is
[2:56:43] that what we believe to be juvenile
[2:56:44] delinquency is really parentalinquency
[2:56:47] and our people got away from the things
[2:56:49] that they should have stayed with
[2:56:52] and you got Hollywood put down lots of
[2:56:55] movies and television uncensored and
[2:56:56] we've come a long way from that but you
[2:56:58] understand that there's there's
[2:57:00] pressures there's somebody trying to
[2:57:02] shape your child's mind and thinking
[2:57:04] even if you're not
[2:57:07] so you got to be Uber conscious of the
[2:57:10] fact that no influence in your child's
[2:57:13] life is actually an influence
[2:57:16] you understand what I'm saying there is
[2:57:18] no such thing as no influence in your
[2:57:20] child's life because the moment you you
[2:57:22] abnegate from that responsibility the
[2:57:24] moment you step back from that
[2:57:25] responsibility and say well you know
[2:57:26] what we go to a good church Bruce Sam's
[2:57:28] our pastor and you know we have good
[2:57:30] Sunday school and everything else so uh
[2:57:31] as a parent I can kind of zone out and I
[2:57:33] can go fishing and I don't really need
[2:57:35] to worry about that and let my let my
[2:57:37] wife raise him let uh the pastor raise
[2:57:39] them let the Sunday School teachers
[2:57:40] raise them and so forth and they have
[2:57:42] good buddies and all the rest of it the
[2:57:43] moment you abnegate that responsibility
[2:57:45] you exempt yourself from that
[2:57:46] responsibility somebody's right there to
[2:57:48] influence them in the wrong way and all
[2:57:51] kids need a father and a mother to work
[2:57:53] together
[2:57:54] to help raise those kids in the best way
[2:57:55] they possibly can and you know what the
[2:57:57] irony is you can be doing really smart
[2:57:59] good things but you have no guarantee
[2:58:01] how your goods are going to come out
[2:58:03] you can be doing all the right things
[2:58:04] and your kids will come out Squirrely
[2:58:05] and you can make all kinds of mistakes
[2:58:07] and have your kids come out right
[2:58:09] figure that out
[2:58:13] you you know what you know what you need
[2:58:16] to do you need to just throw yourself at
[2:58:17] the mercies of God if you're a parent
[2:58:19] here today and you're bringing up kids
[2:58:20] today I think about my grandkids today
[2:58:22] you know I got six of them and they're
[2:58:24] coming up they're all young and they're
[2:58:25] coming up and I think my Lord Jesus I
[2:58:27] pray that uh you know God will put
[2:58:29] influences in their life that will help
[2:58:32] them in the way that my kids had
[2:58:34] influences in their lives and and and
[2:58:37] you know help them shape them move them
[2:58:39] in a certain direction give them a love
[2:58:40] for for God and I will tell you this
[2:58:42] even if you're a lousy parent and you're
[2:58:44] not you're not good at praying out loud
[2:58:46] and all the other things there if you
[2:58:48] teach your children to have respect for
[2:58:49] the Bible that will go a long way if you
[2:58:53] don't do anything else
[2:58:55] teach them to have respect for the Bible
[2:58:57] because that's something that they will
[2:59:00] come back to that's something that
[2:59:01] they'll never forget
[2:59:05] the third thing that we want to talk
[2:59:06] about in relation to discipline is this
[2:59:09] whole idea of behavior and it's a
[2:59:10] discipline of the will
[2:59:12] so now we're kind of getting down here
[2:59:13] to the ground level
[2:59:16] and
[2:59:17] this kind of discipline behavioral
[2:59:20] discipline is focused on consequence
[2:59:22] oriented discipline
[2:59:25] if you do this and you can have this
[2:59:29] and this is this is in the sense it's a
[2:59:31] Biblical thing that
[2:59:34] Samson if he didn't give away his secret
[2:59:36] then he would have strength but the
[2:59:39] converse is also true
[2:59:41] and you say well that's Old Testament in
[2:59:44] Galatians 6 be not deceived God is Not
[2:59:47] mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that
[2:59:48] shall he also reap
[2:59:51] I have a a friend of mine who is a good
[2:59:54] brother he's a song leader in the church
[2:59:56] a really good brother sincere served the
[2:59:58] Lord a lot of years but in his worldly
[3:00:01] days he was out and went with a girl and
[3:00:04] contracted a sexual disease
[3:00:06] the disease is incurable
[3:00:09] and he's not married
[3:00:11] and he's at you know middle age and he's
[3:00:14] not married he's repented of that sin a
[3:00:18] long time ago
[3:00:20] but you know what you reap what your
[3:00:22] soul
[3:00:24] and a lot of kids will think well you
[3:00:26] know when I'm in Christ everything is
[3:00:28] gone everything's forgiven hey this I
[3:00:30] I'll tell you as a as an individual some
[3:00:33] of you have seen my testimony
[3:00:34] I have a lot of memories and a lot of
[3:00:36] scars of things that happened to me
[3:00:37] because I wasn't raised in a message
[3:00:39] environment I wasn't raised in a message
[3:00:40] home and did things out there that I
[3:00:43] wish I had never done
[3:00:45] and you reap what you sow
[3:00:48] and so when it comes to the Natural side
[3:00:51] of life it's really a good thing for you
[3:00:53] to teach your children that in terms of
[3:00:55] behavior you're going to reap what you
[3:00:58] sow if you step have money and you blow
[3:01:01] all your money on bubble gum and
[3:01:04] um
[3:01:06] what are they deadheads what do they
[3:01:07] call them
[3:01:09] Airheads
[3:01:10] I said you are nothing but what you're
[3:01:12] feeding on
[3:01:15] and
[3:01:17] there's going to come a time when you're
[3:01:18] going to wish you had a few of those
[3:01:19] bucks
[3:01:21] instead of a you know cavities and air
[3:01:24] your airhead
[3:01:25] and
[3:01:27] you're in other words you're gonna reap
[3:01:29] what your soul you teach kids that
[3:01:31] principle on a small scale
[3:01:34] and they realize okay you know what I
[3:01:36] gotta think I gotta think about this
[3:01:39] in our home and I'll let you in how we
[3:01:42] did it in our home we had three ways you
[3:01:45] could get spanked
[3:01:46] these are the three ways we made sure
[3:01:49] our children understood this very
[3:01:51] clearly here's the three if you tell a
[3:01:53] lie
[3:01:55] you're eligible for spanking there ain't
[3:01:58] no discussion
[3:01:59] you're going to get spanked
[3:02:01] when you tell a lie you know why because
[3:02:03] God loves the truth
[3:02:06] and we're supposed to put away lying and
[3:02:08] I'm going to help you remember
[3:02:12] so when you lie to Mom
[3:02:15] or you lie to somebody you know what
[3:02:18] you're in trouble
[3:02:20] that's number one that was a guaranteed
[3:02:22] path to spanking the second one was the
[3:02:25] destruction of property
[3:02:28] if you take your brother's toys and you
[3:02:31] break them up and he didn't give you
[3:02:33] permission to break them up duh
[3:02:37] then you're gonna have a consequence for
[3:02:40] that because you know what in real life
[3:02:41] if you steal somebody's car and Smash It
[3:02:44] Up
[3:02:45] there's a consequence for that
[3:02:48] yeah and there are things that you need
[3:02:50] to know about things that are not yours
[3:02:54] and you have to learn to ask permission
[3:02:56] you have to learn to get a you know a
[3:02:58] right to do something everything in the
[3:03:00] world is not yours
[3:03:03] in a way I'm glad my boys have moved out
[3:03:06] in one small way because now I have my
[3:03:08] own wardrobe but still complete my boys
[3:03:10] would come in hey socks yeah Dad got new
[3:03:13] socks guys hey and I I come in every one
[3:03:16] of them walk out with a pair and like
[3:03:17] hello
[3:03:21] and you're laughing listen I I bought a
[3:03:24] speaker yeah I bought a speaker from my
[3:03:26] desk
[3:03:27] a little bold speaker I could put on my
[3:03:29] desk you know what I did I bought five
[3:03:32] and I put them on the desk one at a time
[3:03:37] how many are there now one
[3:03:41] and it's not like hey thanks Dad
[3:03:44] it's like hey that it's in our house
[3:03:49] you're laughing I don't know why you're
[3:03:50] laughing
[3:03:52] the other thing is disrespect
[3:03:54] so telling lies destruction of property
[3:03:56] and disrespect are three sure paths to
[3:03:59] spanking in our house and that includes
[3:04:02] rolling the eyes
[3:04:04] because that's a sure sign somebody
[3:04:06] disrespect you right
[3:04:09] all right guys we're going to have a
[3:04:10] family meeting and we want you to we
[3:04:12] want to talk about cleaning your room
[3:04:15] here we go again
[3:04:19] or you know some someone of the boys
[3:04:22] wants to you know do something with a
[3:04:24] girl or you know we're gonna do a
[3:04:25] sleepover we just we never did
[3:04:26] sleepovers in our house I'm not telling
[3:04:28] you what to do not at all I'm not here
[3:04:30] to do that but I'm just telling you we
[3:04:31] never did that in our house had
[3:04:33] sleepovers and uh you know if if the
[3:04:35] boys came to us in debt how come we
[3:04:37] can't do that how come we can and I'd
[3:04:40] say well that's just I've always been
[3:04:41] our house ruled you know we've seen
[3:04:42] we've I and I've we've personally seen
[3:04:44] some examples there it was not good and
[3:04:46] we don't have any control really when
[3:04:48] they have a lockdown and they got you
[3:04:50] know you have no adult supervision or
[3:04:52] very little
[3:04:53] and so we're not going to do that
[3:04:55] everyone else does
[3:05:02] I'm in Christian company here I better
[3:05:04] not
[3:05:07] the Bible says children obey your
[3:05:09] parents in the Lord
[3:05:10] in all things
[3:05:13] so there's a consequence for disrespect
[3:05:16] and I mean you know when your boss comes
[3:05:18] to you on the job and he says hey guys
[3:05:20] it's time for inventory oh goodness see
[3:05:23] I hate inventory
[3:05:25] go away will ya
[3:05:28] yeah
[3:05:29] how's that going to go
[3:05:32] so we've we find not only with the boys
[3:05:34] but we find this with the girls as well
[3:05:36] that that God puts in place teachers in
[3:05:39] your lives to help teach young women
[3:05:42] things that they're going to need to
[3:05:43] know because they're going to need to
[3:05:45] know them
[3:05:46] and so Paul says speak to other things
[3:05:49] which become sound Doctrine the age of
[3:05:51] men be sober and so forth and three the
[3:05:53] aged women likewise that they being
[3:05:55] Behavior has become a Holiness not false
[3:05:57] users and so forth that the pastor May
[3:06:00] teach the young women to be
[3:06:02] it's not what it says
[3:06:04] that the fathers May teach the Young no
[3:06:08] it's the aged women
[3:06:11] who are supposed to teach young women to
[3:06:12] be sober love their husbands love their
[3:06:15] children be discreet shaper Chase
[3:06:17] keepers at home and so forth and in all
[3:06:21] things
[3:06:22] look if if Mom mom has her black belt in
[3:06:25] Facebook and she's on it you know 75
[3:06:27] percent of the day you're teaching your
[3:06:30] daughter something
[3:06:34] hello
[3:06:35] I'm just saying I'm just saying what it
[3:06:37] says here
[3:06:38] and there are things that you you do
[3:06:40] show by example and and they're just
[3:06:42] they're just really important and you
[3:06:45] can fall back on scripture all the time
[3:06:46] because uh it's scripture scripture is
[3:06:49] given by God for as by inspiration it's
[3:06:52] breathed by God and it is profitable for
[3:06:55] this idea of reproof and Recreation
[3:06:57] correction and chastisement as we
[3:06:59] already Define and correction here in
[3:07:01] instruction and righteousness so that
[3:07:03] the man of God may be perfect
[3:07:06] so we have a scriptural boundary here
[3:07:09] that we want to stay Within and these
[3:07:13] are not my rules these are these are
[3:07:15] God's instructions to us and so we want
[3:07:17] to be mindful of that because we're just
[3:07:19] trying to keep the Holy Spirit welcome
[3:07:21] here in our household
[3:07:24] I I was I was somewhere recently and I
[3:07:27] could tell you this lots of stories like
[3:07:29] this but I was somewhere recently
[3:07:33] oh
[3:07:35] um there was some some event like a
[3:07:39] um
[3:07:40] public thing like uh almost like the
[3:07:43] county fair or something it wasn't a
[3:07:44] county fair but you know something like
[3:07:46] that where lots and lots of people are
[3:07:47] around and this mother and father were
[3:07:49] there in the head of little guys
[3:07:51] probably three right
[3:07:53] and
[3:07:54] I was I happened to be standing right in
[3:07:56] front of this family and the mother was
[3:07:58] saying
[3:07:59] um

[3:08:03] your mother and father
[3:08:05] come over here he doesn't listen right
[3:08:07] two or three times Johnny come over here
[3:08:08] and finally she raises her voice to a
[3:08:10] place where he he he huh
[3:08:14] can I help you
[3:08:16] yes that's the way he was
[3:08:18] come over here be with your mother and
[3:08:20] father and then he just kind of goes
[3:08:22] like this
[3:08:24] that makes us step back she said come
[3:08:25] over here be with your father now I'm
[3:08:27] standing right here right I'm
[3:08:30] um I wish I I would have took out my
[3:08:33] phone and recorded it because I knew
[3:08:36] where this was going and he's he's just
[3:08:37] making steps back he's just looking at
[3:08:39] her you know what now that's what
[3:08:41] two-year-old kids do that's what they're
[3:08:43] wired for right I mean they don't know
[3:08:46] anything else right so they're they're
[3:08:47] doing this
[3:08:49] and I I'm I'm all ready to you know
[3:08:55] stand back ma'am I got this
[3:08:57] I've raised four of these Rascals you
[3:09:00] know just look the other way ma'am
[3:09:04] I'm ready to just let them have it right
[3:09:06] because hey I've been there done that
[3:09:09] right
[3:09:10] I know how this works and I know where
[3:09:13] this is going but you know what and the
[3:09:15] father he kind of you know he's he's
[3:09:17] just going off like this
[3:09:19] and
[3:09:20] she's doing it again Johnny come over
[3:09:23] here and he's doing the same he's just
[3:09:25] looking at her he's not like he's he's
[3:09:26] not hearing her he's looking at her and
[3:09:28] doing this and you know what she does
[3:09:31] she just kind of looks at me because I'm
[3:09:33] right here
[3:09:34] right and she's looking at me she just
[3:09:36] goes
[3:09:37] and just walks off like that and lets
[3:09:40] the kid go his own Direction
[3:09:43] I thought the kid you look the other way
[3:09:46] I'm going to take the mother and just
[3:09:49] [Applause]
[3:09:53] this kid's about three
[3:09:55] and he is controlling
[3:09:58] this situation
[3:10:00] my blood pressure goes up 15 points
[3:10:04] as I'm thinking my goodness
[3:10:13] huh
[3:10:14] my heart
[3:10:17] so the last thing is the physical if
[3:10:20] number three is working on the will this
[3:10:22] is for the wound
[3:10:26] do you get that sister charity all right
[3:10:29] we're good we can go on
[3:10:31] he that spareth his Rod hateth his son
[3:10:34] but he that loveth him chasing him be
[3:10:37] times
[3:10:39] spear means to avoid the duty
[3:10:42] Hey listen what is Pleasant about
[3:10:45] discipline
[3:10:47] what is Pleasant about disciplining your
[3:10:50] children nothing
[3:10:52] and have you ever tried to tell your
[3:10:53] kids this hurts me more than it hurts
[3:10:55] you one time one of my boys said well
[3:10:57] Dad be easy on yourself don't don't do
[3:10:59] that
[3:11:02] I had another another one of my boys
[3:11:05] whenever you get in trouble whenever he
[3:11:07] got in trouble and he knew it was coming
[3:11:09] he had this way of quivering
[3:11:12] [Laughter]
[3:11:20] it was the hardest thing to do not to
[3:11:22] laugh I say stay right there and I go in
[3:11:24] the other room and I'd be laughing away
[3:11:26] I come all right now
[3:11:30] he he got out of more lickens by
[3:11:34] quivering
[3:11:44] withhold not thy Cur with whole not
[3:11:47] correction from the child it doesn't
[3:11:49] work to change this verse
[3:11:52] it just doesn't work
[3:11:58] we we look at this word rod and you got
[3:12:01] to win interpret it right in the Hebrew
[3:12:04] it means it's it's a staff
[3:12:08] the Brand's the club it it is the
[3:12:10] Implement of a shepherd
[3:12:13] and a Shepherd kept things moving in the
[3:12:15] right way he guided with that Rod he he
[3:12:20] kept things under control with that Rod
[3:12:23] you can keep things under control
[3:12:25] without being a controller
[3:12:27] is that all right
[3:12:29] if you're a controller we got to have a
[3:12:31] different conversation but
[3:12:33] a Shepherd did that with his Rod his Rod
[3:12:36] was whenever his Shepherd showed up with
[3:12:38] his Shepherd staff the Sheep didn't go
[3:12:40] hey whoa whoa
[3:12:42] whoa whoa hey relax buddy relax with
[3:12:45] that thing
[3:12:47] didn't David said that Rob and thy staff
[3:12:49] they
[3:12:51] comfort me
[3:12:53] you know I got somebody looking out for
[3:12:54] me I got somebody looking after me and
[3:12:57] this is what that actually means so
[3:12:59] you're you're you're not withholding the
[3:13:02] correction but you're doing in a way
[3:13:04] that your child is not rearing back from
[3:13:06] you
[3:13:07] you know when you go to your child and
[3:13:09] and uh all the you know all of a sudden
[3:13:11] you see them and you put your hand out
[3:13:12] they're not like whoa hey hey relax
[3:13:13] there buddy
[3:13:15] hmm
[3:13:18] so we establish boundaries
[3:13:22] and this is biblical this is important
[3:13:26] the Lord's instructions for parents is
[3:13:28] that they teach a child boundaries
[3:13:32] chasing thy son while there's hope less
[3:13:34] not thy Soul spare for his crying and
[3:13:36] let not thy Soul spare for his crime
[3:13:40] because when children learn that they're
[3:13:42] going to use it every time matter of
[3:13:43] fact they're going to use whatever works
[3:13:46] to get out of a spanking and boundaries
[3:13:48] help a child see that life is not about
[3:13:50] pursuing what he wants but surrendering
[3:13:53] to the Lord and following him
[3:13:55] boundaries are set with conditional love
[3:13:58] will teach children boundaries that are
[3:14:00] set with unconditional love will teach
[3:14:03] children to surrender to the Lord
[3:14:04] because they trust that God knows what
[3:14:06] is best and will bring through
[3:14:07] contentment let me ask you this in your
[3:14:10] Christian experience if the Lord if the
[3:14:12] holy spirit's ever corrected you have
[3:14:14] you wound up hating him because he did
[3:14:17] no consistently whenever the Lord
[3:14:20] corrects us we love him more we say
[3:14:22] thank you Lord I never knew that Lord
[3:14:24] forgive me for doing that wrong and that
[3:14:25] I mean when it's done right
[3:14:28] that's the response right that's the
[3:14:30] reaction so you have to craft this
[3:14:33] discipline in a way that your children
[3:14:35] don't hate you and they're looking at
[3:14:37] you saying wait till I go to school and
[3:14:39] tell the counselor
[3:14:43] I can tell you stories
[3:14:47] and and this is this is biblical hast
[3:14:50] thou not made a hedge around about him
[3:14:52] that that Satan had asked God about his
[3:14:54] house and about all that he has on every
[3:14:56] side
[3:14:57] uh
[3:14:58] my people are destroyed Hosea chapter 4
[3:15:01] for lack of knowledge
[3:15:04] and that is discernment and
[3:15:05] understanding my people are destroyed
[3:15:08] for a lack of knowledge because thou has
[3:15:10] rejected knowledge I will also reject
[3:15:11] thee thou shall be no priest to me
[3:15:14] saying thou has forgotten the law of thy
[3:15:16] God and I will also forget thy children
[3:15:18] and so therefore the the
[3:15:21] imparting and the uh given given the
[3:15:26] child the the knowledge and the uh the
[3:15:30] knowledge of where those boundaries are
[3:15:32] is really important
[3:15:34] the rod and reproof give wisdom but a
[3:15:36] Child Left to himself bringeth his
[3:15:38] mother to shame the rod physical
[3:15:40] discipline and reproof his correction
[3:15:42] give wisdom so notice it's not all
[3:15:44] spanking
[3:15:45] and it's not all lecturing
[3:15:48] you need both but you need both
[3:15:51] you get me you understand what I'm
[3:15:53] saying
[3:15:54] you can't just do the physical part
[3:15:56] without explaining why this is happening
[3:15:59] and you're you're saying hey this is
[3:16:01] this is not my rule this is you you lied
[3:16:05] you told a lie and you know what this is
[3:16:08] how God feels about lying and and uh you
[3:16:12] know you you just you just can't do you
[3:16:13] can't do that in life
[3:16:15] and and there's a consequence for
[3:16:17] certain things and so therefore we're
[3:16:18] going to we're going to help that child
[3:16:21] understand the reproof side but the rod
[3:16:24] is is something that is going to help
[3:16:27] them remember
[3:16:28] and so you can't take one away one away
[3:16:31] and expect to have balanced discipline
[3:16:34] here because a Child Left to himself
[3:16:36] brings his mother to shame
[3:16:39] now
[3:16:40] in your book here
[3:16:42] on page 21 just so you got the reference
[3:16:44] here
[3:16:45] I put this in because this is seven
[3:16:48] Jewish parenting principles inspired by
[3:16:50] experience and in the Jewish culture
[3:16:53] based on scripture these are seven
[3:16:55] things that are uh that are sensible and
[3:16:59] that's the reason I put them in it's not
[3:17:00] all they'll say the Lord here but like
[3:17:02] number three talks about respect and if
[3:17:04] you look at the paragraph it says if
[3:17:06] your children exhibit
[3:17:07] should Spa sometimes which is rebellion
[3:17:11] then you're in good company children are
[3:17:13] not naturally inclined to treat their
[3:17:14] parents with respect and hence the fifth
[3:17:17] commandment thou shall honor thy father
[3:17:18] and thy mother
[3:17:20] my father-in-law is 96 years old
[3:17:24] and
[3:17:26] we still
[3:17:28] we still are my wife and I
[3:17:31] we we believe in this fifth commandment
[3:17:33] honor your father and your mother
[3:17:35] and that's not just for little kids
[3:17:37] looking at their parents that's a
[3:17:39] lifelong principle
[3:17:41] recently my wife answered asked me a
[3:17:43] question she said what would happen to
[3:17:45] my father if I died
[3:17:48] what would you do
[3:17:52] I told her
[3:17:54] I said I'm committed to you
[3:17:58] whether you're alive or dead
[3:18:01] and I said therefore
[3:18:03] I would treat him no differently
[3:18:06] whether you're here or not
[3:18:08] because he is your father
[3:18:11] and I'm still under the fifth
[3:18:12] commandment whether you're here or not
[3:18:17] I wish my boys were here to hear that
[3:18:21] because we want to have a Seaside old
[3:18:23] folks home in Ireland and retire there
[3:18:28] but anyway go to number six that's what
[3:18:30] I was going to say
[3:18:33] number six be a mentor we are our
[3:18:36] children's teachers of right and wrong
[3:18:38] based on the Divine blueprint for
[3:18:39] mankind
[3:18:41] set for mankind in the Torah the first
[3:18:43] five books of the Bible let me read it
[3:18:44] again we as parents are our children's
[3:18:47] teachers of right and wrong
[3:18:50] based on the Divine blueprint set for us
[3:18:52] in the Bible
[3:18:55] perhaps this is best seen in the
[3:18:57] connection between the Hebrew words
[3:18:58] parent
[3:19:00] and teacher Moray an instructor horah
[3:19:05] these are the words I put up on the
[3:19:07] screen here and how we want them to live
[3:19:10] we must first model well that's
[3:19:12] consistent with what we've been talking
[3:19:14] about right
[3:19:15] so
[3:19:18] if you read down through the rest of
[3:19:19] that number six there don't do it
[3:19:22] the rabbis
[3:19:24] very often told parents
[3:19:27] to teach their children to swim
[3:19:32] huh
[3:19:34] because swimming
[3:19:36] is teaching a child to survive in an
[3:19:41] environment they're not comfortable in
[3:19:42] this is not my natural environment
[3:19:45] so we're going to teach them to swim and
[3:19:48] they're going to be thrown into this
[3:19:50] environment that they're not comfortable
[3:19:51] in and survive
[3:19:54] parenting is the act of putting your
[3:19:58] child in environments that's not natural
[3:20:01] in other words it's not your home
[3:20:04] so that they can survive and interact
[3:20:06] with the world around them
[3:20:08] that's the idea
[3:20:11] so I've seen homeschooled families who
[3:20:13] where they mothers and fathers are so
[3:20:16] protective and they so isolate their
[3:20:18] kids that when their kids get out
[3:20:20] they're like
[3:20:21] I'm going to be eaten alive by something
[3:20:23] out here everything is evil everything
[3:20:25] is going to hell
[3:20:28] and they don't know how to interact they
[3:20:30] don't do well in relationships they
[3:20:32] don't do well in work they don't do well
[3:20:34] in anything outside the house because
[3:20:35] we're outside of our comfort zone throw
[3:20:37] them in the pond
[3:20:39] that's what the rabbi said
[3:20:41] put them in an environment that then now
[3:20:44] they have to learn to cope in an area
[3:20:46] that's not comfortable not normal
[3:20:49] and learn to survive in that atmosphere
[3:20:52] and that's a that's the principle behind
[3:20:55] how Jewish people would uh react to
[3:20:58] training their children so in other
[3:21:01] words you know when I talked about the
[3:21:03] Boy Scouts the pre-gay Boy Scouts
[3:21:04] because my boys are have no connection
[3:21:06] with scouting anymore
[3:21:08] they don't Trail life is is an option
[3:21:11] that you can do today but they have no
[3:21:13] connection with Boy Scouts and but it
[3:21:15] was an environment where now they had to
[3:21:17] get along with these other kids
[3:21:19] and they had to build a tent together
[3:21:20] they had to build a fire together they
[3:21:21] had to chop down the tree together they
[3:21:23] had to kill a bear you know or whatever
[3:21:24] they had to do whatever and and they had
[3:21:27] they had to do that but we didn't just
[3:21:29] throw them into the lake and not teach
[3:21:30] them how to swim we I was there with
[3:21:32] them
[3:21:33] helping them coaching them along you
[3:21:35] know and we chose this troop this group
[3:21:37] this group because we knew the leader
[3:21:39] and we you know we we thought we did
[3:21:41] anyway and we we were you know side by
[3:21:44] side with them there but we're in a
[3:21:46] sense we're teaching them to swim in
[3:21:48] agricultural terms it's called hardening
[3:21:49] off
[3:21:51] right so when you go to a if you raise a
[3:21:54] plant from a Seedling
[3:21:55] and it starts to sprout you don't take
[3:21:57] it out and put it outside right away and
[3:21:59] leave it outside you harden It Off
[3:22:02] right hardening it off means we're going
[3:22:04] to take it out for an hour a day and put
[3:22:07] it back inside and then next day we're
[3:22:09] going to put it out for a couple of
[3:22:10] hours and bring it back inside next week
[3:22:12] we're going to put it out for
[3:22:13] all day and we're going to bring it back
[3:22:15] inside
[3:22:16] and then eventually we're going to leave
[3:22:18] it overnight outside
[3:22:20] we're going to harden it off we're going
[3:22:22] to acclimatize that child to the
[3:22:24] environment or we're going to harden off
[3:22:26] that plant to the environment it's going
[3:22:29] into
[3:22:30] so while your kids are little you're
[3:22:32] obviously going to keep him inside
[3:22:33] you're going to expose them very little
[3:22:34] but over time we're going to experience
[3:22:36] them a little expose them a little bit
[3:22:38] more
[3:22:39] are we okay
[3:22:41] sometimes your kids get good exposure by
[3:22:44] going to Sunday school in church
[3:22:48] talk about hardening off
[3:22:51] maybe I shouldn't have said that
[3:22:54] did I just say that
[3:22:57] and
[3:22:58] what you're doing is you're helping them
[3:23:00] to cope in an environment that's not
[3:23:01] normal it's not theirs
[3:23:03] and this is the when you read that and
[3:23:06] number six there that's what the rabbis
[3:23:07] actually told parents to do to put your
[3:23:11] kids in an environment where it's not
[3:23:12] normal and natural and let them uh you
[3:23:15] know adjust learn to adjust and cope and
[3:23:17] survive in that environment if it's all
[3:23:20] Rod they become submissive but
[3:23:23] unemotional
[3:23:24] your kids will become submissive yeah
[3:23:26] I'll do whatever it needs to take in
[3:23:28] order to not get the spanking and I'll
[3:23:30] say I'm sorry say your tell your brother
[3:23:32] you're sorry I'm sorry
[3:23:35] thank you for really meaning that
[3:23:39] but if it's all reproof
[3:23:41] it's all they can become defiant of
[3:23:43] authority
[3:23:44] and you know what they're they're just
[3:23:46] going to lie their way through whatever
[3:23:48] they need to lie through to avoid the
[3:23:51] punishment and if we don't have both
[3:23:53] this scripture applies if iron be blunt
[3:23:56] and he do not wet the edge
[3:23:59] then must he put to more strength
[3:24:04] if you're chopping wood with an ax and
[3:24:06] the ax becomes blunt the only way you're
[3:24:07] ever going to chop that wood is to hit
[3:24:09] it harder
[3:24:12] if iron be blunt and you do not wet or
[3:24:15] sharpen the edge wet is sharp in the
[3:24:18] edge
[3:24:19] then he must have to put more strength
[3:24:21] do you understand what he's saying
[3:24:24] the only thing you do is hit it harder
[3:24:26] but wisdom is profitable to direct
[3:24:34] means to succeed
[3:24:37] wisdom is profitable
[3:24:39] in order to succeed
[3:24:42] and to be right or give success to be
[3:24:44] right and proper
[3:24:46] so you understand what Solomon is
[3:24:47] actually saying it's great verse
[3:24:49] if iron be blunt
[3:24:52] if your kids are rebellious and you're
[3:24:54] spanking them
[3:24:55] and you know what there's no amendment
[3:24:57] of behavior at all
[3:24:59] you're only gonna I mean unless you
[3:25:01] figure out a way to do this you're gonna
[3:25:03] have to just hit him harder hit him more
[3:25:04] often
[3:25:06] and you know what that's going to
[3:25:07] accomplish nothing
[3:25:11] but wisdom
[3:25:13] will help you have success in the
[3:25:15] discipline of your children
[3:25:16] does that make sense
[3:25:18] so it's not all rod
[3:25:20] and it's not all lectures
[3:25:23] it's not all Bible studies
[3:25:26] but we're going to kind of do both
[3:25:29] because that will give us the advantage
[3:25:31] to instill wisdom in our children it's
[3:25:35] not easy
[3:25:36] brother man said when you go out here
[3:25:38] and say well I'll mingle around a little
[3:25:39] bit in the world he said God gives you a
[3:25:41] whip and God will give you a real
[3:25:42] old-fashioned spanking for you for it
[3:25:44] and I'll tell you that if you had more
[3:25:46] of it in the natural today we'd have
[3:25:48] better children
[3:25:49] God wants his household straightened out
[3:25:53] these days you know you can say to your
[3:25:54] kids Hey listen you could lose that
[3:25:57] privilege and you can you can
[3:26:01] you know make you come back down the
[3:26:03] ladder unless that you're you're willing
[3:26:06] to uh unless you're willing to comply
[3:26:09] here and uh to listen to what we're
[3:26:11] actually saying now if you don't mind
[3:26:13] let me
[3:26:16] uh there's a there's a lot here that we
[3:26:18] could we could actually say but uh if
[3:26:20] can I have a few more ah it's 2 30.
[3:26:29] just getting wound up
[3:26:34] no no no no no no we need coffee
[3:26:41] more coffee the ee kind
[3:26:45] am I am I help I mean is this making
[3:26:47] sense at all and where are we
[3:26:49] we
[3:26:52] don't really mean that
[3:26:54] no uh
[3:26:56] we can talk about fathers here we can
[3:26:59] talk about it and and uh how many of you
[3:27:02] here are empty nesters
[3:27:06] huh
[3:27:07] bless your hearts
[3:27:13] yes and no now Sister listen we need to
[3:27:15] Define empty nesters
[3:27:21] okay okay
[3:27:23] let's take just a little short break
[3:27:25] five minutes okay we'll come back
[3:27:35] thank you
[3:27:39] we know that he's a he's a father
[3:27:43] and uh
[3:27:46] God wants us to be mindful of this part
[3:27:49] of our Lives I just want to say this uh
[3:27:52] some of the questions and comments have
[3:27:53] been really great and I wish I had time
[3:27:56] actually to deal with them a little bit
[3:27:59] more
[3:28:00] uh do you spank for Tantrums
[3:28:04] that's a question do you spank toddlers
[3:28:07] for Tantrums I'm not here to tell you
[3:28:09] how that you should discipline your
[3:28:11] children you know like physically you
[3:28:14] can talk to your pastor about that
[3:28:17] um I I know this that um
[3:28:21] how you physically handle your child
[3:28:23] matters
[3:28:25] and there are some children you'd never
[3:28:27] need to physically handle your child you
[3:28:29] might have a daughter and you look at
[3:28:31] her sideways and she knows you're not
[3:28:32] happy that's all you need to do
[3:28:34] I never had daughters but um
[3:28:39] you know I I'm not I'm not here and I'm
[3:28:41] purposely not going to tell you what
[3:28:43] what weapon you should employ to because
[3:28:46] some people they don't understand
[3:28:48] discipline unless it means
[3:28:50] some object that they use to inflict
[3:28:52] pain on their kids and I uh I've seen
[3:28:55] too much of that go go go wrong
[3:29:00] a lot of times you know you can you can
[3:29:02] employ a time out
[3:29:04] uh in in the world if you rob a store
[3:29:08] the judge is going to sentence you to
[3:29:10] time out
[3:29:12] right
[3:29:13] and timeout is not a bad thing
[3:29:15] especially if the family is doing
[3:29:17] something else if you've got to go to
[3:29:18] bed early and everybody else is up in
[3:29:19] the in the in the living room having a
[3:29:21] good time timeout hurts
[3:29:24] and uh when our intent is not to hurt
[3:29:26] our children it's the it's the rod and
[3:29:30] staff principle and so we're going to
[3:29:32] teach them are going to uh use that rod
[3:29:35] in a right way what forms of discipline
[3:29:37] would you use for disrespect once a
[3:29:39] child is too old to spank
[3:29:41] and you had to be really careful that
[3:29:43] you know where that line is about
[3:29:44] spanking your kids but uh if your child
[3:29:47] has a phone that's a great disciplinary
[3:29:50] tool if your child drives that's a great
[3:29:53] disciplinary Tool uh there there are
[3:29:56] things that they might not be welcome to
[3:29:59] participate in with the family
[3:30:01] uh
[3:30:03] they might not be able to go out with
[3:30:04] their friends after church on Sunday uh
[3:30:07] go to a restaurant with the other young
[3:30:09] people or whatever you you had to think
[3:30:11] about this and you had to think about
[3:30:12] what works but I will tell you this in
[3:30:15] all of the forms of discipline and all
[3:30:16] the discussion of discipline you have to
[3:30:19] be consistent consistency is the key and
[3:30:22] I know when I cross the line this is
[3:30:24] going to happen and you know what I
[3:30:26] better watch it because Mom and Dad are
[3:30:28] going to be there and don't don't let
[3:30:29] your kids play off mom against dad
[3:30:32] you know and go to Dad and Dad says
[3:30:34] you're going to get it when we get home
[3:30:35] you're going to get it and then you go
[3:30:38] to the kids go to Mom and say that
[3:30:40] that has been mean to me
[3:30:43] he hates me he hates me oh he doesn't
[3:30:44] hate you we love you we love you and I
[3:30:46] won't let him I won't let him say
[3:30:50] yeah a little rascal
[3:30:54] you tell me what school the kids went to
[3:30:56] to learn that
[3:30:58] that's intuitive they know how to do
[3:30:59] that so don't do that and if there's a
[3:31:02] discussion there you know I mean if
[3:31:03] there's some sort of a disagreement
[3:31:04] mother and father should get aside
[3:31:06] without the kid in front of him and say
[3:31:08] did you tell him this or did you say
[3:31:10] this and let's agree on what we're going
[3:31:12] to do here because that behavior is
[3:31:13] unacceptable that violates one of our
[3:31:15] family principles here and you know what
[3:31:17] we're gonna we're gonna put a stop to
[3:31:19] that but decide that between you and
[3:31:21] then come back and whoop the Daylights
[3:31:22] out of them if you need to no I'm only
[3:31:24] kidding I'm only kidding
[3:31:27] now here's a question that I think is is
[3:31:29] really important is competition healthy
[3:31:33] um
[3:31:34] like message Sports
[3:31:36] huh
[3:31:39] um
[3:31:40] playing on Sunday I I'm I guess I'm over
[3:31:43] 30. you know I'm old school when it
[3:31:44] comes to playing on Sunday and I I'm I'm
[3:31:47] pretty conservative about what we do on
[3:31:49] Sundays uh so I I don't I don't go that
[3:31:52] way but you know that's you you again
[3:31:54] your family you have to uh you know
[3:31:58] determine what's what's right but I
[3:32:00] don't think that Sunday uh extends only
[3:32:03] to the end of the service
[3:32:05] Sunday doesn't go to the last song is
[3:32:07] over
[3:32:08] it's a it's a day we set aside from the
[3:32:11] normal business and Affairs of life is
[3:32:13] competition healthy yes absolutely yes I
[3:32:17] was listening to a story the other day
[3:32:19] about a fellow who was
[3:32:21] um
[3:32:22] young fella and the coach had told him
[3:32:25] the phys ed teacher had told him hey
[3:32:26] next week a week from today we're going
[3:32:28] to have a race we're going to run a race
[3:32:29] and we're going to give away Awards and
[3:32:33] um you know it's going to be for
[3:32:34] everybody in the class 36 uh something
[3:32:37] like fourth graders so this boy was I
[3:32:39] mean he was training he was running and
[3:32:41] practicing and preparing for the race
[3:32:43] and the day came finally coach lined him
[3:32:46] up Ready Set goal and they all ran in
[3:32:48] the race and he came in second tried his
[3:32:50] hardest and came in second and at the
[3:32:53] end of the race the coach came along and
[3:32:55] had 36 first place ribbons and gave him
[3:32:58] out to all the kids
[3:33:00] and he went home and he said I don't
[3:33:03] want to go to that school anymore he
[3:33:05] said the coach lied to us
[3:33:07] and he said we he said I trained and you
[3:33:10] know trained for that race and he said
[3:33:11] and there was one kid they had to do
[3:33:13] four laps around the track for the race
[3:33:15] and he said one kid who did one lap
[3:33:17] walking and then quit and he got a first
[3:33:19] place ribbon
[3:33:21] and that boy had problems with that
[3:33:25] after that experience for a long time
[3:33:27] now I'll tell you what I this this whole
[3:33:30] idea of you know women uh men becoming
[3:33:33] women and getting into sports and all of
[3:33:36] this stuff without you know no no one
[3:33:38] fails because we don't hurt anybody's
[3:33:40] self-esteem and all of that Hey listen
[3:33:42] you know what I'd preach that too if I
[3:33:45] could find it in the Bible and it ain't
[3:33:47] in there
[3:33:49] that's baloney
[3:33:51] that's Holiness around that's baloney
[3:33:53] and it's it's not true it's not a
[3:33:56] healthy thing
[3:33:57] so uh I'm I guess I'm old school on that
[3:34:00] sorry all right let's talk a little bit
[3:34:02] about fathers okay is that all right so
[3:34:04] sisters don't tune out here because
[3:34:06] you've got to be the elbow that elbows
[3:34:08] your husband and say wake up stupid this
[3:34:10] is for you
[3:34:16] July 13 2009 this was in Time Magazine
[3:34:19] we need fathers to step up to realize
[3:34:22] that their job does not end that
[3:34:24] conception
[3:34:25] that's what that's what makes you a man
[3:34:28] is not that what makes you a man is not
[3:34:31] the ability to have a child but the
[3:34:33] courage to raise one
[3:34:36] and everybody said
[3:34:38] this is so funny because you don't know
[3:34:41] who said this
[3:34:50] he went on to say on every in the same
[3:34:53] speech on every single significant
[3:34:54] outcome related to short-term and
[3:34:56] well-term long-term success
[3:34:59] short-term well-being and long-term
[3:35:01] success
[3:35:02] children from intact to parent families
[3:35:06] outperform those from single parent
[3:35:09] households
[3:35:11] longevity drug abuse school performance
[3:35:13] and Dropout rates teen pregnancy
[3:35:15] criminal behavior and incarceration and
[3:35:17] in all cases the kids living with both
[3:35:20] parents drastically outperform the
[3:35:22] others but here's the reality
[3:35:26] the top line is the percentage of
[3:35:28] families that are one parent families
[3:35:30] more than any other Nation on Earth
[3:35:32] we have more money more facility we have
[3:35:35] more education we have more benefits of
[3:35:38] any other Nation on Earth practically
[3:35:40] and yet we are raising more
[3:35:43] children in one parent families than any
[3:35:46] other place on Earth
[3:35:48] for decades the share of U.S children
[3:35:50] living with a single parent has been
[3:35:51] rising accompanied with a decline in
[3:35:53] marriage rates and rise in births
[3:35:55] outside a marriage
[3:35:58] children young people now are getting
[3:36:00] married later in life
[3:36:02] the average age for girls is 25.8 years
[3:36:05] and the average age for boys is 27.2
[3:36:08] years that means that they are not
[3:36:12] trusting marriage they're waiting longer
[3:36:14] you know why because they're probably
[3:36:16] working with somebody who's paying
[3:36:18] alimony payments because of divorce
[3:36:21] and they're looking at that saying I
[3:36:23] don't want to do that
[3:36:25] so I'm going to live together with
[3:36:26] somebody before we have uh marriage here
[3:36:29] because uh that seems safer and I don't
[3:36:32] have to pay alimony if it doesn't work
[3:36:34] we're going to split it seems to be more
[3:36:36] logical
[3:36:37] they're looking at it from a
[3:36:38] non-biblical logical point of view
[3:36:40] okay
[3:36:42] let me tell you something you need to
[3:36:44] teach your kids this
[3:36:46] intimacy never precedes commitment
[3:36:52] in the eyes of God commitment precedes
[3:36:56] intimacy
[3:36:59] how many of you have ever been to a
[3:37:00] youth retreat when are youth retreat
[3:37:03] and you're all you're all married right
[3:37:04] I mean that's what it's for
[3:37:07] eign did I just say that
[3:37:10] should I not have said that
[3:37:14] we teach this all the time to the kids
[3:37:16] because it's really important you get
[3:37:18] this to your children
[3:37:20] intimacy never precedes
[3:37:24] your commitment to that person
[3:37:26] but a commitment comes first
[3:37:29] I remember one time I was talking about
[3:37:31] getting married to my wife I was sitting
[3:37:33] in the kitchen with my sister and two
[3:37:35] brothers two brothers are serving the
[3:37:36] lord my sister is not and she uh I was
[3:37:40] talking about you know the wedding and
[3:37:42] going away it was just a day or two
[3:37:43] before I left to go get married and she
[3:37:45] was sitting there eating something and
[3:37:47] and I said you know at the altar I said
[3:37:49] that would be the first time that I
[3:37:50] kissed my wife and I just kind of went
[3:37:52] out she goes she spit out all the food
[3:37:55] she said run that by me again I said
[3:37:58] that'll be the first time I kiss her is
[3:37:59] at the altar
[3:38:01] she said really I said yeah
[3:38:04] she said what if you don't like the way
[3:38:05] she kisses
[3:38:11] I said you know I said
[3:38:15] you either believe this message or you
[3:38:17] don't
[3:38:18] one or the other
[3:38:19] but especially on this issue there's no
[3:38:21] halfway
[3:38:22] and I said that's what the message
[3:38:24] teaches
[3:38:25] the Oddball 1964 many other places
[3:38:27] brother Brandon said the first gift
[3:38:29] should be when you lift the veil and
[3:38:31] whenever I marry somebody in my church
[3:38:33] and I'm already married when I perform
[3:38:34] the marriage ceremony of somebody in my
[3:38:36] church and we're now polygamous all
[3:38:38] right
[3:38:39] uh but when Sam just got that so I
[3:38:44] I always ask them before I do the
[3:38:47] wedding I always ask them is this the
[3:38:48] first kiss at the altar because I want
[3:38:50] to know
[3:38:51] and
[3:38:52] I said to my sister I said we've never
[3:38:55] kissed and she said
[3:38:57] she just couldn't get over that
[3:38:58] and I said you know that's what that's
[3:39:00] what brother Bram taught that's what the
[3:39:02] message teaches and uh you know what I
[3:39:05] said I believe I believe that God will
[3:39:08] take care of that and he did
[3:39:13] brother Branham
[3:39:15] he he talks very clearly about that that
[3:39:17] incident when he was going down a hotel
[3:39:20] room now I had somebody who got this
[3:39:23] story directly from Brother Branham
[3:39:25] and brother Brandon when he tells it
[3:39:27] publicly like in this here where and
[3:39:28] this is the story where he's going down
[3:39:30] the hallway in the hotel and people are
[3:39:32] you know drunk and naked and they're
[3:39:34] falling around on the floor and she says
[3:39:36] whoopee this is life you know when
[3:39:38] brother ran told a story in private he
[3:39:40] told it much more graphically it was
[3:39:43] pretty bad
[3:39:44] it was pretty bad and he was disgusted
[3:39:48] at this because they were so Twisted
[3:39:51] away from what was morally acceptable
[3:39:53] even in that day and he said but that's
[3:39:55] what breaks up homes and that's what
[3:39:57] spoils children that's what makes
[3:39:58] neurotics and teenage delinquency is
[3:40:00] when mother motherhood and fatherhood
[3:40:02] motherhood and fatherhood are broke
[3:40:04] and let me tell you it you you are the
[3:40:07] people who are uh to me are called to uh
[3:40:12] fix that which is
[3:40:15] capable of being broken if it's broken
[3:40:17] and to be able to make sure that it's
[3:40:19] done right your attitude toward Christ
[3:40:21] will make a great impression on what
[3:40:23] your children will be
[3:40:29] your attitude towards Christ will make a
[3:40:31] great impression on what your children
[3:40:32] will be your life you live before your
[3:40:34] family guess who he's talking to here
[3:40:36] he's not talking to kids
[3:40:38] right
[3:40:40] your life you live before your family
[3:40:42] will make an impression on what your
[3:40:43] children will be
[3:40:45] wow if you say well I thought that was
[3:40:47] all up to the Holy Spirit Well uh now
[3:40:50] you got your money's worth
[3:40:52] because the Bible said he'd visit the
[3:40:53] iniquity of the parents upon the
[3:40:55] children to the third and fourth
[3:40:56] generation there was a a brother one
[3:40:58] time who lived in California and was one
[3:41:01] of the members of the board of the Full
[3:41:02] Gospel businessman's Association brother
[3:41:04] Branham went and visited the vineyard
[3:41:06] because many of them were wine vineyard
[3:41:09] owners you know many these guys out of
[3:41:11] California and because that's where
[3:41:13] demishekarian lived and so forth and
[3:41:15] this one brother uh had brother random
[3:41:18] come and visit the the vineyard and
[3:41:20] showed brother Branham all these places
[3:41:22] and he said the Lord has really blessed
[3:41:24] me he said look at all of this that's
[3:41:25] done and he was he was not bragging or
[3:41:27] anything it wasn't a bad thing and
[3:41:29] brother random looked at all of it and
[3:41:30] when he came to the end of the tour and
[3:41:33] was leaving he shook his hand he said
[3:41:35] brother he said this is all really
[3:41:37] wonderful but he said the reason you
[3:41:39] have all of this is because of what your
[3:41:42] father did to serve the Lord
[3:41:47] you are blessed because of what your
[3:41:49] father did
[3:41:52] so I say it like this
[3:41:55] when my boys leave my house
[3:41:58] I want their
[3:42:02] let's say this way I want my ceiling to
[3:42:06] be their platform
[3:42:10] as high as I go and as high as I bring
[3:42:13] them I want them to be able to start
[3:42:15] right there and go forward not have to
[3:42:17] go relearn Christianity again and come
[3:42:19] all the way down here I want to live a
[3:42:21] life in such a way that when they leave
[3:42:23] they can just they've come this high
[3:42:24] with me they can just go right on
[3:42:27] you get you understand the principle
[3:42:30] that I don't want them to have to spend
[3:42:31] time going back to say well what does
[3:42:33] the message teach about this or that you
[3:42:35] know and now they have to have their own
[3:42:37] experience but I want them to be able to
[3:42:39] continue to raise their children live
[3:42:41] their life be married in such a way that
[3:42:44] they take off from where I left them
[3:42:47] my ceiling becomes their platform
[3:42:52] that's what's important because the
[3:42:54] Bible said he'd visit the iniquity of
[3:42:55] the parents on the children all right
[3:42:57] let's apply that you ready let's apply
[3:42:59] that here we go
[3:43:00] I'll tell you a story once upon a time
[3:43:03] there was a family of wayward church
[3:43:04] members who had once been active but
[3:43:07] lost all interest and had fallen away
[3:43:09] from church there was a father and three
[3:43:12] sons Jim John and Sam
[3:43:14] the elders had talked to them about
[3:43:16] their lost condition and the preacher
[3:43:17] visited and many Brethren talked to them
[3:43:19] about their lost condition and tried to
[3:43:21] get them to come back to church but all
[3:43:23] this did not seem to do the least bit of
[3:43:25] good
[3:43:26] until one day all the boys were out in
[3:43:29] the pasture and a large rattlesnake bit
[3:43:31] John and he became ill
[3:43:34] the doctor was called and after
[3:43:35] examination he pronounced John to be in
[3:43:37] a very critical condition and he said
[3:43:40] about all we can do now is pray
[3:43:43] the father called the preacher and told
[3:43:45] him of John's condition and he asked the
[3:43:47] preacher to pray for John's recovery and
[3:43:49] this was his prayer
[3:43:51] o wise and righteous father we thank
[3:43:53] thee for thou and thy wisdom has sent
[3:43:55] this rattlesnake to bite John
[3:43:57] in order to bring him to his senses he
[3:44:00] has not been inside the church for years
[3:44:02] and it is doubtful that he is in all
[3:44:04] that time felt the need for prayer now
[3:44:07] we trust that he that this will prove a
[3:44:09] valuable lesson to him and that it will
[3:44:11] lead to genuine repentance and now
[3:44:13] father wilt thou send another snake to
[3:44:16] bite Sam
[3:44:17] and another one to buy Jim and another
[3:44:20] big one to bite the old man
[3:44:23] we have all been doing everything we
[3:44:24] know for years to restore them but to no
[3:44:27] avail it seems therefore that all our
[3:44:29] combined efforts could not do what this
[3:44:31] snake has done we thus conclude that the
[3:44:34] only thing left that will do this family
[3:44:36] any good is rattlesnakes send us bigger
[3:44:39] and better rattlesnakes in the name of
[3:44:41] Jesus we pray
[3:44:50] you weren't expecting that story
[3:44:56] Jesus
[3:44:57] takes a lot of time in talking about the
[3:45:00] father because he's in this role of son
[3:45:04] and suffering savior
[3:45:06] and refers to his father many times but
[3:45:10] he assures us that
[3:45:12] this is a father who's focused on one
[3:45:15] thing and that's what's best for you
[3:45:18] so if you ask him one thing he's not
[3:45:20] going to give you something else
[3:45:22] if you ask him for an egg will he offer
[3:45:24] a scorpion
[3:45:25] If he if if he then being evil know how
[3:45:28] to good gifts give good gifts unto your
[3:45:30] children and that's not an evil thing
[3:45:32] but you're not God
[3:45:35] how much more shall your heavenly father
[3:45:36] give the spirit to them that ask him
[3:45:40] so there are there are attributes here
[3:45:44] about father God that
[3:45:46] he wants to see in us and he develops in
[3:45:49] US so this is this is pretty good
[3:45:54] a traditional role of a Hebrew father in
[3:45:56] the Old Testament and this you think
[3:45:58] about Joseph you know who was uh the
[3:46:00] surrogate father for Jesus here he had
[3:46:03] to give their son they had to give their
[3:46:06] son three basic things
[3:46:08] spiritual instruction the Shema hero
[3:46:10] Israel the Lord is one
[3:46:12] that was the first thing that the Hebrew
[3:46:15] uh fathers and Sunday school teachers
[3:46:17] taught their children is it's called the
[3:46:20] Shema
[3:46:22] and
[3:46:23] that was the first thing and a knowledge
[3:46:25] and a respect for the Torah the law and
[3:46:29] give his son an occupation
[3:46:31] to teach him how to work to teach him
[3:46:33] how to be responsible and then thirdly
[3:46:35] to be an ambassador into marriage
[3:46:38] to show his sons and daughters what a
[3:46:42] good marriage could be like that was the
[3:46:44] responsibility of Hebrew fathers it's
[3:46:46] really not that different for us I mean
[3:46:48] we can summarize a lot of what I've said
[3:46:49] today in those three principles
[3:46:52] let's apply it now specifically a
[3:46:55] prudent man says Solomon foreseeth the
[3:46:57] evil and hideth himself but the simple
[3:46:59] passed on and are punished
[3:47:01] that's a really really great proverb how
[3:47:05] many of you have come to a better
[3:47:06] appreciation of the Proverbs today
[3:47:09] some of you have I can take the muted
[3:47:11] Applause I mean
[3:47:14] wow
[3:47:16] I thought these were Believers saying
[3:47:19] a prudent man
[3:47:20] this is a verse written about Farmers
[3:47:22] this is a farming verse
[3:47:25] and it means that a prudent man is one
[3:47:29] who sees afar off
[3:47:30] okay see the definition on the bottom
[3:47:32] he's shrewd and he sees something far
[3:47:34] off not here yet but he sees it far off
[3:47:36] in other words a farmer when he harvests
[3:47:39] his crop at in the fall he can sell
[3:47:42] everything and make a huge profit he can
[3:47:45] buy himself a new Ford F-150 truck with
[3:47:48] the uh you know the extended by golly
[3:47:50] mirrors out there that flash when you
[3:47:52] turn on the blinker and you know and
[3:47:54] ride down he he can spend all of his
[3:47:56] money he can sell everything but you
[3:47:58] know what a prudent man sees that the
[3:48:00] spring is coming
[3:48:01] so I know I'm going to have the plant in
[3:48:03] the spring
[3:48:04] so he's going to withhold a portion of
[3:48:06] his seed so he can invest the seed in
[3:48:09] the ground without death
[3:48:11] this is what Solomon is writing
[3:48:14] you can sell it all yeah but a prudent
[3:48:17] man foresees the evil planting season is
[3:48:20] the evil you know what it's not here yet
[3:48:23] we're in the Harvest but I know Spring's
[3:48:25] coming
[3:48:26] so I'm Gonna Save a little for this
[3:48:29] spring planting because then I can plant
[3:48:31] without debt
[3:48:33] and if the crop fails I haven't lost
[3:48:35] anything
[3:48:37] does that make sense that's Prudence in
[3:48:40] the Bible
[3:48:40] so I see it a far off not here yet but
[3:48:43] it's coming
[3:48:44] how many of you have daughters let's see
[3:48:45] in your hands again
[3:48:47] the evil is coming
[3:48:50] you know what it is
[3:48:53] you know what it is the wedding
[3:48:56] it ain't here yet
[3:48:59] but you know what
[3:49:01] I see it down the road
[3:49:03] if I don't kill that guy before we get
[3:49:06] to the wedding
[3:49:08] it's down the road
[3:49:09] you'd be smart to lay aside a little for
[3:49:13] that even though it's not here
[3:49:16] how many of you have kids in college
[3:49:19] or had kids in college
[3:49:22] it helps to put aside a little bit even
[3:49:24] if they're if they're still at home in
[3:49:26] school grade school because the evil is
[3:49:29] coming
[3:49:30] you understand
[3:49:32] this is what Solomon is telling us that
[3:49:35] a fool the simple pass on and pay the
[3:49:39] price for that they're punished by
[3:49:41] having to pay the price because they did
[3:49:44] not prepare for what was inevitable
[3:49:48] so when you think about fathers now when
[3:49:50] you think about looking at the big
[3:49:52] picture I had four boys and we wanted
[3:49:54] them to have some sort of post-secondary
[3:49:56] Education whether it was a skill you
[3:49:59] know how to how to fix a car or whether
[3:50:01] it's to build a bridge didn't matter but
[3:50:03] we wanted them to have something outside
[3:50:04] of high school because you're going to
[3:50:06] need that so we foresaw that and put
[3:50:09] away funds for that particular time what
[3:50:13] we did was believe it or not I'm that
[3:50:15] old that I can say that sister Becky's
[3:50:18] grandfather uh
[3:50:20] a lot of 25 of his income for all the
[3:50:24] preachers in the family tree it's a
[3:50:26] bunch
[3:50:27] too many but he a lot of 25 and we got a
[3:50:31] check from him every month for 25
[3:50:33] dollars because we were in Ministry
[3:50:35] full-time Ministry and we decided to
[3:50:38] take that 25 and just lay it aside
[3:50:40] because we knew one day that uh boys
[3:50:43] would need to go to school they'd need
[3:50:45] to go to college of some sort and by
[3:50:47] God's grace we were able to put them all
[3:50:49] through college one of them had a bit of
[3:50:51] debt because he was uh you know in
[3:50:53] school a little bit longer and so forth
[3:50:55] but for the most part all of them have
[3:50:58] multiple degrees
[3:51:00] and we did it by by just putting that
[3:51:03] away and leaving that because we knew
[3:51:05] the day would come and I didn't have
[3:51:07] enough income to really set aside any uh
[3:51:10] kind of uh deduction at that particular
[3:51:12] point so we just accumulated that money
[3:51:14] for that and by God's race we were able
[3:51:16] to accomplish something later on
[3:51:18] and so therefore uh you know a prudent
[3:51:21] man and that's what a father should be
[3:51:22] we should be looking at this not for the
[3:51:24] now but we should be thinking about
[3:51:26] things uh a little bit up the road and a
[3:51:31] wise son hears his father instruction
[3:51:32] but a scorner heareth not rebuke and so
[3:51:36] forth and all of these principles here
[3:51:39] uh apply he that begeteth a fool doeth
[3:51:41] it in his to his sorrow and the father
[3:51:44] of a fool hath no joy so there there's a
[3:51:47] a lot of there's a lot of warning in the
[3:51:50] sense in scripture about uh making sure
[3:51:52] that you instill that wisdom pass along
[3:51:55] that Insight uh to your kids as they
[3:51:57] grow I remember Brother Band said when I
[3:52:00] was a little boy I always like horses
[3:52:01] and I said I'll tell you you won't go
[3:52:04] wrong as long as you love nature because
[3:52:06] God's in nature
[3:52:07] and I was thinking about that when I was
[3:52:09] a little lad
[3:52:11] that's what I liked
[3:52:13] my father was a writer he's a good
[3:52:16] writer
[3:52:17] what a sh he said what a shot with a
[3:52:19] revolver he'd make those big Stone
[3:52:22] Marbles and he'd roll them out like that
[3:52:23] have two guns shoot one knock the marble
[3:52:26] in the air and burst the marble before
[3:52:27] it hit the ground with the other gun
[3:52:30] now he said I couldn't hit a wash tub
[3:52:32] like that he said it didn't laying still
[3:52:34] but I still like the outdoors
[3:52:36] and I used to want to be like my daddy I
[3:52:39] just love my daddy I remember his daddy
[3:52:41] wasn't exactly an upright man
[3:52:43] I mean
[3:52:46] but you know what that's how strong
[3:52:49] that relationship is without trying
[3:52:53] that's a boy just looking up to his
[3:52:55] father
[3:52:56] and a girl looking up to his father
[3:52:58] and he said he wasn't a Christian until
[3:53:00] a little bit before he died and I led
[3:53:02] him to Christ he was Irish through and
[3:53:04] through and a real Drinker and no matter
[3:53:06] what he did I didn't care what he did
[3:53:08] he's my daddy anyhow
[3:53:10] brother Branham one time took Billy Paul
[3:53:13] up in Chicago and went to the Bowery the
[3:53:16] Bowery was where the drunks hung out
[3:53:18] and he walked down the Bowery and he
[3:53:20] looked at these guys laying on the
[3:53:21] ground and he said Billy he said here
[3:53:25] except for the grace of God
[3:53:27] I would be here too if it wasn't for the
[3:53:30] grace of God
[3:53:32] and brother Branham knew he was an acoa
[3:53:34] that's an adult child of an alcoholic
[3:53:37] that's a real thing
[3:53:39] I am an acoa I'm an adult child of an
[3:53:43] alcoholic
[3:53:44] and
[3:53:45] brother Branham said to Billy Paul
[3:53:47] except for the grace of God he said this
[3:53:49] is where I'd be and then he looked at
[3:53:51] him again and he said except for the
[3:53:52] grace of God here's where you'd be also
[3:53:55] because he was the adult grandchild of
[3:53:58] an alcoholic
[3:54:02] because I'm an acoa an adult child of an
[3:54:04] alcoholic
[3:54:06] I had to break that cycle
[3:54:09] like brother Branham broke the cycle
[3:54:13] Billy Paul was not that way there's a
[3:54:15] tendency there's a real predisposition
[3:54:18] for addiction in an acoa
[3:54:21] and but for the grace of God in the Holy
[3:54:23] Ghost you would probably very easily go
[3:54:26] down that road
[3:54:28] unless you break the cycle
[3:54:30] I didn't break the cycle on purpose it
[3:54:33] was by God's grace that the cycle got
[3:54:34] broken
[3:54:35] because I realized if I didn't I would
[3:54:38] be setting my boys up for failure you
[3:54:41] understand what I'm saying
[3:54:44] there are things that that you're faced
[3:54:47] with like brother Branham said this is
[3:54:49] the way that he was and he said I loved
[3:54:52] him anyway so there's something in him
[3:54:54] even in his Brokenness Mr branham's
[3:54:56] Brokenness brother bam still looking up
[3:54:59] to with admiration not the bad parts not
[3:55:01] the murder and so forth but not the bad
[3:55:03] parts but you know what that's still
[3:55:05] dead
[3:55:06] and that's how powerful that is even
[3:55:08] when he's doing the wrong thing it's
[3:55:10] still a powerful thing and listen Young
[3:55:12] Folks whenever it gets to a place that
[3:55:14] you have to call your dear Mother and
[3:55:15] Father no matter what they've done when
[3:55:18] it comes to a place and they're not
[3:55:19] Mother and Daddy just the old man the
[3:55:20] old woman he said that's when you've
[3:55:22] taken one of the greatest backsliding
[3:55:24] states that you'll ever take
[3:55:27] you'll never know what your mother means
[3:55:29] to you and a father until you hear the
[3:55:30] squeaking of the casket as a going out
[3:55:32] the door
[3:55:33] I'll tell you what I wish I had my
[3:55:35] mother back to ask her some questions
[3:55:36] about things that I now I know now she
[3:55:39] knew
[3:55:41] you realize he said them gray hairs in
[3:55:43] his head he said you helped put them
[3:55:45] there
[3:55:46] you think about your parents so I'm
[3:55:49] saying this to you not to ruin your
[3:55:50] afternoon but I'm saying this to you
[3:55:52] because you're still breathing
[3:55:55] and you no doubt some of you have made
[3:55:57] real mistakes real tangible mistakes and
[3:56:00] sometimes the correction for those
[3:56:02] mistakes is just simply to go to your
[3:56:04] child and say I'm sorry
[3:56:07] I messed up
[3:56:10] and I need to make something right
[3:56:12] it might be to your wife it might be to
[3:56:14] your children
[3:56:15] it doesn't matter but I know that there
[3:56:18] are kids alive today that live
[3:56:21] waiting for their parents to Simply say
[3:56:24] I'm sorry
[3:56:25] I didn't get it all right
[3:56:28] I was too controlling I was too
[3:56:30] unforgiving I was too strict I was to
[3:56:32] this or that and a lot of kids are just
[3:56:34] waiting for that word to come from you
[3:56:40] can I go a little bit further
[3:56:45] so
[3:56:47] this got my attention
[3:56:51] Little David
[3:56:53] No Doubt this is the message
[3:56:55] perseverance
[3:56:56] no doubt raised in a lovely believing
[3:56:59] home with his father this is David David
[3:57:02] the shepherd his father Jesse a great
[3:57:06] man of God
[3:57:08] stop
[3:57:10] really
[3:57:13] really
[3:57:15] can anyone here tell me what might have
[3:57:19] qualified Jesse
[3:57:22] to be a great man of God
[3:57:26] what oh yeah I'd say you had faith
[3:57:29] a lot of people had faith in the Bible
[3:57:31] too
[3:57:32] and brother Brown doesn't call him a
[3:57:34] great man of God
[3:57:36] what
[3:57:42] he was
[3:57:45] the father
[3:57:47] that God chose
[3:57:49] to put David in in his house
[3:57:53] oh yeah
[3:57:55] the next king of Israel a man after
[3:57:58] God's Own Heart
[3:57:59] who does God choose to have raised that
[3:58:02] boy
[3:58:03] Jesse
[3:58:06] what in the world made him a great man
[3:58:09] of God I mean I don't know of any Giants
[3:58:10] he slew
[3:58:12] I don't even know that he ever sung a
[3:58:14] special in church
[3:58:16] I don't know that he did anything
[3:58:18] tangible that's recorded in scripture at
[3:58:20] all
[3:58:22] i i i that caught my attention
[3:58:25] because here's brother Ram calling him a
[3:58:27] great man of God some of you are reading
[3:58:28] on furiously
[3:58:33] let me spare you the stress
[3:58:37] sorry should I you are right over there
[3:58:41] charity is a daughter we never had
[3:58:44] oh isn't that cute
[3:58:48] she gets her own special day when she
[3:58:51] comes to our house and all right anyway
[3:58:52] Jesse rape man of God
[3:58:55] no doubt gathered all those boys around
[3:58:58] at night had family prayer before they
[3:59:00] went to bed probably read the schools
[3:59:02] and talked about great Jehovah how he
[3:59:03] opened the Red Sea sorry for the long
[3:59:04] sentence and a great prophet Moses
[3:59:06] brought them out following the pillar
[3:59:08] fire and all these things
[3:59:10] and I created faith
[3:59:13] what made Jesse a great man of God you
[3:59:16] know what he did he had devotions every
[3:59:17] night
[3:59:21] oh here's all these boys now they're
[3:59:23] young right they're all these boys and
[3:59:24] they're all they're all kind of uh you
[3:59:26] know at the end of the day and and uh
[3:59:28] Jesse says all right everybody time for
[3:59:30] bed let's go let's go get everybody get
[3:59:32] cleaned up we're gonna go to bed oh Dad
[3:59:34] tell us a story all right all right what
[3:59:36] one do you want to hear tell us about
[3:59:37] Moses going across the Red Sea all right
[3:59:40] guys sit down take your seats and he'd
[3:59:42] get up there and he'd be up on the on
[3:59:44] the chair and he'd say Moses stood there
[3:59:46] and held up his hands and he spoke to
[3:59:48] the Sea and it opened up there and why
[3:59:51] cry speak and all you know the the
[3:59:54] Egyptian Horsemen had come across and he
[3:59:56] he would probably dramatize that and
[3:59:58] David's sitting there wow
[4:00:01] I love this story
[4:00:04] creates a faith in David
[4:00:08] that when it comes time for David now
[4:00:11] and he's out looking after the father's
[4:00:13] sheep and he sees a bear
[4:00:16] he's like a New York City fireman on 9
[4:00:19] 11. he's running into trouble not away
[4:00:21] from it
[4:00:25] you ever see those firemen running into
[4:00:27] trouble running into those buildings on
[4:00:29] 9 11. here's David he sees the baron
[4:00:31] he's running after that he's running
[4:00:33] after the bear and he's got a slingshot
[4:00:36] and he he says he says I'm a son of God
[4:00:40] I'm a son of Israel under the Covenant
[4:00:43] and goes after that bear and you know
[4:00:45] what he's got he's got an anointing by a
[4:00:48] prophet that says he's going to be the
[4:00:50] next king of Israel so you know what he
[4:00:52] just has no fear because he knows that
[4:00:53] if God said that God's going to make it
[4:00:55] come to pass even if that bear eats me
[4:00:58] that bear is going to have to spit me
[4:00:59] out because I'm going to have to come
[4:01:01] back on my feet again because a prophet
[4:01:03] said this is what's going to happen and
[4:01:05] he's got faith to pursue that bear in
[4:01:07] the same way that the Bible says he ran
[4:01:09] out on the field and through that rocket
[4:01:11] Goliath and nobody in their right mind
[4:01:13] is going to throw a rock at Goliath and
[4:01:15] attempt to hit him in the head unless
[4:01:16] they got a promise that they're going to
[4:01:18] be a king of Israel one day and that's
[4:01:20] what he did where did that come from
[4:01:21] from sitting at the feet of Jesse and
[4:01:23] Jesse dramatizing Moses going across the
[4:01:26] Red Sea and looking back and seeing all
[4:01:28] those Egyptians in the water
[4:01:32] that created faith and faith comes by
[4:01:34] hearing and hearing by the word of the
[4:01:36] Lord and David got to thinking of that
[4:01:38] of course he was the smallest and they
[4:01:39] put him out to watch a few sheep and one
[4:01:41] day the lion came in and got one and he
[4:01:43] thought now he says what am I going to
[4:01:45] say to my father about this sheep and
[4:01:47] missing here and he recalled he
[4:01:49] remembered my father read from the
[4:01:51] Scrolls and told me God was a great God
[4:01:53] to deliver his people and he would bless
[4:01:55] Israel and was with Israel and all that
[4:01:57] circumcised in the Covenant and I'm one
[4:01:59] of them I'm one of them and God's
[4:02:01] blessing is upon me and I have a right
[4:02:04] one of my father's sheep is gone and I'm
[4:02:06] going after that sheep and he grabbed
[4:02:08] these Little Shepherd's thing shot and
[4:02:09] he brought that sheep back by killing
[4:02:11] the line he was perseverant and what was
[4:02:13] God doing training him and a bear came
[4:02:15] in and one day his brothers brought
[4:02:18] something to eat he brought his brothers
[4:02:19] something to eat there and there was
[4:02:20] Goliath there and he says why don't he
[4:02:23] go out there why don't somebody go after
[4:02:24] that guy and I imagine he was thinking
[4:02:26] my father I know that if you care that
[4:02:28] much about those Lambs there how much
[4:02:30] you care about the people that are
[4:02:32] called by your name he said now they're
[4:02:34] in conflict and they're afraid and they
[4:02:36] got very perseverant and took Goliath
[4:02:37] out with that slingshot and won the
[4:02:39] Victory and they believed in what he was
[4:02:41] trying to achieve it was the will of God
[4:02:43] the word of God in the plan of God you
[4:02:46] know where it began it began at
[4:02:48] devotions in his father's house
[4:02:56] so Jesse was called a great man of God
[4:03:02] I'm just saying what the tape say
[4:03:08] you think you're not a preacher you're
[4:03:10] not a special singer you don't play
[4:03:11] drums you don't really do much that's
[4:03:13] identifiable in the church but if God
[4:03:15] gave you kids
[4:03:17] and you know a couple of basic stories
[4:03:19] you now have the potential to become a
[4:03:21] hero
[4:03:24] in the eyes of your kids you have the
[4:03:25] potential to become a hero
[4:03:27] you don't need to be a prophet you don't
[4:03:29] need to have a great super spiritual
[4:03:31] mind you know what you need to do you
[4:03:33] just need to accept the responsibility
[4:03:34] that God's put in your hands and to
[4:03:37] influence those kids towards the kingdom
[4:03:41] that makes sense
[4:03:43] some father is saying well I can't pray
[4:03:45] I can't tell a story hey
[4:03:48] it's interesting
[4:03:51] I
[4:03:53] brother rap crook is rap ever been over
[4:03:56] here to minister okay you should get him
[4:03:58] I'm not telling you what to do but you
[4:04:00] should give
[4:04:01] he's in my church this weekend
[4:04:03] let me tell you he's a great guy great
[4:04:04] young man and I had no rap very well and
[4:04:07] travel with him around the world and so
[4:04:09] forth and he came to our church and did
[4:04:11] a Sunday morning service and it's uh
[4:04:14] the titles call him boiling frogs in
[4:04:16] Babylon and if you want to go back to
[4:04:18] part two and uh he it was it was
[4:04:21] fantastic he was talking about what he
[4:04:22] does for devotions with these kids it
[4:04:25] changed the lives of many of the men in
[4:04:27] my church it was absolutely amazing and
[4:04:30] he talked about uh you know getting the
[4:04:33] uh the three wise men following the star
[4:04:37] and you know and he was just doing this
[4:04:39] as a as a devotion and uh he was he was
[4:04:43] saying that uh he got his kids all
[4:04:45] dressed up with blankets like the three
[4:04:46] wise men and he got himself a a
[4:04:48] flashlight and he turned it upside down
[4:04:50] as a lantern and he said we're just
[4:04:52] following hey these kids following
[4:04:53] around the house you know turn off all
[4:04:55] the lights and they're walking by the
[4:04:56] star they're following the star and uh
[4:04:58] he's walking around like this and his
[4:05:00] wife was dressed up with another sheet
[4:05:01] and she was King Herod where are you
[4:05:03] going to worship this child you know and
[4:05:05] uh they they had to give an answer to
[4:05:08] the king and so he said then you know we
[4:05:10] went through the house and we found the
[4:05:12] baby Jesus had a doll and found the baby
[4:05:13] Jesus and and he said man he said the
[4:05:16] kids they want me to do that one over
[4:05:17] and over and over again well he was
[4:05:18] telling me that
[4:05:19] and he was telling the church that and
[4:05:21] it was I mean there was just one example
[4:05:23] and it was a really great uh
[4:05:25] illustration of how you can hold
[4:05:26] devotions because there's two ways of
[4:05:29] talking in the Bible maybe you've heard
[4:05:30] that today
[4:05:31] and and one of them is now children thou
[4:05:34] shall sit down and listen patiently I'm
[4:05:36] going to read the future home of the
[4:05:38] Earthly bride and the Heavenly
[4:05:39] bridegroom page one paragraph one thou
[4:05:42] shall listen on the pain of death
[4:05:45] hey your four-year-old ain't gonna do
[4:05:48] that right they're not there
[4:05:52] and I have one brother who after the
[4:05:55] service was over I mean we were so happy
[4:05:56] it was just such a blessing and he had
[4:05:58] one brother who's an engineer in in our
[4:06:00] church he's a civil engineer and he's I
[4:06:04] mean I don't know if you know any
[4:06:05] Engineers or how they think but they
[4:06:07] they think like this
[4:06:09] a goes here
[4:06:11] all right there's no discussion ego's
[4:06:13] here
[4:06:14] B fits perfectly into a
[4:06:18] whether you like it or not
[4:06:20] and if it's not perfect we're going to
[4:06:21] go back to a
[4:06:23] and fix it so B fits perfectly C comes
[4:06:26] after that
[4:06:28] don't give me D give me c
[4:06:30] and D comes out and that's a as an
[4:06:33] engineer that's how they think right I'm
[4:06:35] not going to ask do we have any
[4:06:36] Engineers here because I think we
[4:06:38] probably do
[4:06:40] but this brother has two children two
[4:06:42] girls one is two one is four
[4:06:45] and I said to him on the way out of
[4:06:47] church I said how'd you enjoy service
[4:06:48] today he said it's life-changing it's
[4:06:51] been life-changing he said let me tell
[4:06:53] you how we do devotions he said my kids
[4:06:55] have three different story books for
[4:06:57] devotions they're all picture Bibles
[4:07:00] and he said at the end of the day we'll
[4:07:02] address at bedtime I'll say to them all
[4:07:04] right let's have devotions pick a story
[4:07:06] that you want to read so they'll just
[4:07:08] pick any one of the three Bibles and
[4:07:10] open it up to anywhere and say read this
[4:07:12] one Daddy
[4:07:14] and he said I used to say to my girls
[4:07:17] we haven't read the one before that
[4:07:20] are you sure you want this one yes yes
[4:07:23] that's what we want but we haven't read
[4:07:25] Jonah first we have to read the one
[4:07:26] before it
[4:07:28] and he said we'd get in a shouting match
[4:07:29] and everybody go to bed crying and my
[4:07:32] wife would say what kind of a man or a
[4:07:33] father are you you know
[4:07:40] and he said you know he said it was like
[4:07:42] I was born again when I heard that
[4:07:44] sermon he said I could just I could read
[4:07:46] it was hard for an engineer but he he
[4:07:49] actually now he does that he reads
[4:07:51] whatever they open up to he said yeah
[4:07:53] that's a good one let's read them
[4:07:56] you know what he's being he's being a
[4:07:58] great man of God because he's
[4:08:00] influencing his kids at the age level
[4:08:03] they're at
[4:08:06] and bringing them up in the way they
[4:08:07] should go
[4:08:08] and he says we don't wait till bedtime
[4:08:10] until everybody's tired and cranky he
[4:08:12] says we do it when they're feeling okay
[4:08:14] even if that's kind of my time to relax
[4:08:16] he said we do it then because the kids
[4:08:18] are intentive they're happy Daddy's home
[4:08:20] and so forth we do it he said we'll do
[4:08:21] it kind of different random times of the
[4:08:23] day in other words you brother braham's
[4:08:25] not telling us here that there's a
[4:08:27] strict pattern or order in your house
[4:08:28] you've got to find what works in your
[4:08:30] house you've got to find what works with
[4:08:32] the kids of your age right you know I
[4:08:34] look at these guys over here you're not
[4:08:36] you're not
[4:08:37] you're in big bodies but you're still
[4:08:39] young guys and
[4:08:40] and you know you parents had to deal
[4:08:43] with these guys at this age right here
[4:08:45] so you know
[4:08:47] um there's a there's a way that you uh
[4:08:51] you you deal with that because the Bible
[4:08:53] says you know
[4:08:55] fathers provoke not your children under
[4:08:57] wrath right
[4:08:59] you know why that's there you know why
[4:09:00] that's there in the Bible
[4:09:02] because you can provoke your children to
[4:09:04] Wrath
[4:09:06] you can do that
[4:09:07] it's just like Paul wrote in Ephesians 4
[4:09:10] grieve not the Holy Spirit we're by your
[4:09:11] seal unto the day of redemption you know
[4:09:13] why he wrote that because you can you
[4:09:14] can grieve the Holy Spirit
[4:09:16] so he says provoke not your children
[4:09:17] under Wrath
[4:09:23] so let's do a demo
[4:09:25] in order to have a demo you got to have
[4:09:27] a dummy I mean a volunteer a volunteer
[4:09:30] hello volunteer let's just say that this
[4:09:32] is my son your name is Zion wow what a
[4:09:36] great name
[4:09:37] so let's say that Zion comes home from
[4:09:40] school and he says to me and I'm just
[4:09:43] home from work and he says
[4:09:46] ah dad
[4:09:48] uh I just wanted to ask you something
[4:09:51] here
[4:09:52] now he's not being arrogant or anything
[4:09:54] but he says
[4:09:56] uh hi on the camera
[4:10:01] all the boys in school
[4:10:03] have decided for a month that we're
[4:10:05] going to wear a
[4:10:06] temporary tattoo
[4:10:10] yeah you can take it off after a month
[4:10:11] but we're all going to do this tattoo
[4:10:12] thing for a month
[4:10:14] and I just kind of wanted to know if
[4:10:17] that'd be all right and there's two ways
[4:10:19] I can answer him
[4:10:21] right and the Bible says now provoked on
[4:10:24] him to wrath provoke not your son around
[4:10:26] so I can answer them this way a what
[4:10:29] a tattoo you got to be kidding me a
[4:10:31] tattoo what kind of training do you
[4:10:33] think we've given you all these years a
[4:10:35] tattoo can you understand where tattoos
[4:10:38] come from they come from Hell which is
[4:10:40] where you're going if you have the
[4:10:42] tattoo now go to your room
[4:10:45] foreign
[4:10:47] that's one way
[4:10:50] and you know what when I talk to him
[4:10:52] like that you know what he's doing he's
[4:10:53] in his in his Spirit he's backing up
[4:10:56] he's he's wanting to escape
[4:11:00] there's another way I can answer him
[4:11:03] tattoo
[4:11:05] really
[4:11:07] you listen
[4:11:12] we don't do tattoos now this is not my
[4:11:15] rule
[4:11:16] this is not my comment about tattoos
[4:11:19] here but let me show you what scripture
[4:11:20] says about tattoos and about you know
[4:11:22] putting markings on yourself and it's
[4:11:24] here in the Old Testament and then we
[4:11:26] follow it through here and look at some
[4:11:27] things that brother Graham said and you
[4:11:29] know what when I talk to him like this
[4:11:30] you know what I'm doing to him
[4:11:32] I'm discipling him
[4:11:34] a disciple as one was taught
[4:11:37] it may seem like the most stupid thing
[4:11:39] I've ever heard but nonetheless he's
[4:11:42] asking that question because he has
[4:11:43] enough confidence to come to me and he
[4:11:46] doesn't know the right answer he doesn't
[4:11:47] know the right response that's why he's
[4:11:49] doing that so he's not barging in and
[4:11:51] saying I'm wearing a tattoo and you
[4:11:52] can't say anything about it he's not
[4:11:54] doing that he's just asking me he's kind
[4:11:56] of feeling me out here
[4:11:58] when that happens I have an opportunity
[4:12:00] to disciple him and I can easily turn
[4:12:03] him off
[4:12:07] or I can teach him
[4:12:11] that's what it means when it says that
[4:12:13] you shall not provoke him to wrath
[4:12:15] because God does not want you to turn
[4:12:16] him away God wants you God wants you to
[4:12:20] take advantage of those opportunities
[4:12:22] even when something really squirrely
[4:12:24] gets asked or something funny goes on
[4:12:27] because you may be you might not know it
[4:12:31] but you may be a Jesse
[4:12:32] who's got a David
[4:12:35] and your answer might affect him in a
[4:12:37] great way because now if I tell him that
[4:12:40] about an ashoman scripture and he's got
[4:12:42] a half an ounce of holy ghost in him
[4:12:43] he's got to make a decision now do I go
[4:12:46] back to the school and tell the boys
[4:12:48] what the Bible says or not
[4:12:50] so now he's challenged in a new way and
[4:12:53] you know that'll be something you know
[4:12:55] son you don't have to do that you don't
[4:12:57] you don't have to do that in order to be
[4:12:59] accepted among the bunch here and and
[4:13:01] here what are you going to tell them you
[4:13:04] could ask I could ask him what are you
[4:13:05] going to tell him when you go back to
[4:13:06] school and he says he says to me oh how
[4:13:08] did I see that you know I don't want to
[4:13:10] I don't want to introduce the wrong
[4:13:11] thing and I don't want to give a set of
[4:13:13] precedent here I don't want to tell the
[4:13:14] boys and I'll do anything that they do
[4:13:16] so now he's got to go back to school and
[4:13:18] say I'm not going to do a tattoo 30 boys
[4:13:20] in the class 29 of them got a tattoo and
[4:13:22] one doesn't why not what are you going
[4:13:24] to say I'd ask him what are you going to
[4:13:26] say
[4:13:27] now he's got a new challenge right
[4:13:30] do you understand I'm drawing him into
[4:13:32] that process that's the idea I'm drawing
[4:13:34] him in now because now he's got a
[4:13:36] decision to make and he's got uh you
[4:13:38] know a really uh important uh precedent
[4:13:41] that he sets in relation to his
[4:13:43] testimony and his uh among his peers
[4:13:46] that's a different thing than asking Dad
[4:13:48] when you go back to your peers and you
[4:13:50] start to say hey guys you know what I'm
[4:13:52] talking to my dad about this and showed
[4:13:54] me a Bible verse back here and and uh
[4:13:56] well that's Old Testament well you know
[4:13:58] what we live by every word that proceeds
[4:14:00] out of the mouth of God so we're not
[4:14:01] Jews but you know what the moral law
[4:14:02] still applies
[4:14:03] so you know what and now all of a sudden
[4:14:06] he's got a man you got a little room
[4:14:07] here to have a conversation right them
[4:14:10] am I making sense
[4:14:14] here we are again Jehovah Jireh 1957
[4:14:16] well Jesse brought six of them and might
[4:14:18] have said haven't he got another one
[4:14:20] Samuel Mighty got another one oh yes I
[4:14:22] got a little one that's a naughty fellow
[4:14:24] out here hurting some sheep and I'm sure
[4:14:25] he wouldn't look as good as a king now
[4:14:28] here's what's interesting about that
[4:14:33] Samuel didn't know who was to be the
[4:14:35] king he only knew out of what household
[4:14:38] they were coming
[4:14:40] he didn't know who was the king
[4:14:42] Jesse didn't know who was the king
[4:14:45] Samuel didn't know
[4:14:47] the brothers didn't know
[4:14:49] David didn't know
[4:14:52] David's not out there in the field
[4:14:53] saying I know I'm going to be king I
[4:14:55] know I know he doesn't know he's going
[4:14:58] to be king no one knows he's going to be
[4:14:59] king
[4:15:00] finally God anoints David to be the King
[4:15:03] right
[4:15:05] here's the way I understand that
[4:15:09] you and I can cut open an apple and
[4:15:12] count the seeds don't worry I'm not
[4:15:14] going to shout at you I saw you leaning
[4:15:15] back
[4:15:16] you and I can cut open an apple and
[4:15:18] count the seeds
[4:15:20] only God can look at the seed and count
[4:15:23] the apples
[4:15:33] I don't know what's in there
[4:15:36] you understand
[4:15:38] Only God Can Count the seeds Only God
[4:15:41] Can Count the apples that come out of
[4:15:43] here I can look at his life but God
[4:15:45] looks at the future that he has in mind
[4:15:47] for this young man or a young daughter
[4:15:49] whatever else and
[4:15:52] we can look at the Apple and count the
[4:15:54] seeds but only God can look at a seed
[4:15:56] and say out of that is going to come
[4:15:57] this many apples
[4:16:00] am I making sense
[4:16:02] so therefore the Bible says in the New
[4:16:05] Testament if any provide not for his own
[4:16:08] especially of those of his own house he
[4:16:11] hath denied the faith and is worse than
[4:16:13] an Infidel that strong language
[4:16:16] that's pretty strong language to be a
[4:16:19] denier of the faith and what's worse
[4:16:22] than an infidel only a fool says in his
[4:16:24] heart there is no God
[4:16:26] tell me what's worse than an infidel
[4:16:30] this is pretty strong language and in
[4:16:33] order to really understand the verse you
[4:16:34] got to understand some of these words
[4:16:35] here very briefly to provide If any man
[4:16:38] provide not for his own it means to
[4:16:41] perceive beforehand Remember The Prudent
[4:16:44] man foresees the evil remember that
[4:16:48] someone who provides for his family if
[4:16:50] he fails to do that he fails to perceive
[4:16:52] or foresee
[4:16:55] how to take care of something
[4:16:58] when something is provided for him to
[4:17:01] use to take care of the situation
[4:17:05] in other words
[4:17:07] if we go backwards here If any man
[4:17:10] provide not for his own listen you
[4:17:12] fathers that are here
[4:17:15] God knew you needed a strong message
[4:17:19] in this last day to counter the effects
[4:17:22] of laodicea and social media and all the
[4:17:25] other garbage that's out there God and
[4:17:27] gender discussions
[4:17:29] hello
[4:17:31] I don't know about you but I never woke
[4:17:32] up on a Saturday and spent my day
[4:17:34] wondering about what gender I was we
[4:17:36] went fishing
[4:17:39] but now I mean these kids are in a
[4:17:42] turmoil because they they're they're
[4:17:43] being taught you don't really know what
[4:17:45] you are
[4:17:46] really
[4:17:49] biology was really lying to you really
[4:17:53] how silly is that
[4:17:55] anyway
[4:17:58] God knew you'd need a strong message to
[4:18:01] be led by to believe and to pass on to
[4:18:04] your children raising kids in such a
[4:18:06] messy world
[4:18:07] right in a morally corrupt world you
[4:18:10] needed a strong message that's sent a
[4:18:13] clear signal in this last day and God
[4:18:15] sent it
[4:18:17] if you don't provide for your own by
[4:18:20] giving what God has provided
[4:18:22] you are actually denying the faith and
[4:18:26] worse than an infidel
[4:18:28] you refuse you're rejecting something
[4:18:30] that's offered God says I know you're
[4:18:33] living in laodicea duh I placed you here
[4:18:35] I could have placed you in any other age
[4:18:37] but I placed you here
[4:18:39] and you know what I knew what it would
[4:18:40] be like in laodicea I knew what it'd be
[4:18:42] like in 2023 so therefore I gave you
[4:18:45] this message for you to be able to
[4:18:47] counter the effects of this crazy world
[4:18:49] and to be able to establish light and
[4:18:51] peace and shalom in your home in the
[4:18:53] last days and you ain't going to get it
[4:18:55] anywhere else Google is not going to
[4:18:57] give this to you teachers are not going
[4:18:59] to give this to you in a secular
[4:19:01] environment the government is not
[4:19:03] pulling for you to raise your kids in a
[4:19:04] Godly way they're passing laws that are
[4:19:08] contrary to what we believe in our time
[4:19:10] they're protecting Sodom in the passing
[4:19:13] of many laws in our time here
[4:19:15] and and it's just God knew you'd need a
[4:19:19] strong message and for us to turn away
[4:19:21] from that or to not provide what God's
[4:19:25] accepted you know what you're worse than
[4:19:28] an Infidel that's what he's saying all
[4:19:30] right that's not my words that's a
[4:19:31] scripture
[4:19:34] God says look I know you're there but I
[4:19:36] got something for you I got something
[4:19:38] really good for you this is going to
[4:19:39] work nothing else is going to work but
[4:19:41] this is going to work apply this in your
[4:19:43] home apply this token in your home and
[4:19:46] watch what happens
[4:19:48] and God's willing to bring you to the
[4:19:49] edge of impossible and then tell you to
[4:19:51] make one more step and do it by faith in
[4:19:53] the last day and apply the word of God
[4:19:55] and watch what happens and God will
[4:19:56] bless you hey it's a walk of Faith now
[4:19:59] to do this and we'll talk about that
[4:20:00] tomorrow morning here but I will say
[4:20:02] this that this is exactly what this
[4:20:04] verse implies that God knows the evil is
[4:20:08] present all around you and this is what
[4:20:10] you need to counter that go ahead and
[4:20:12] take it and if you don't take it God
[4:20:14] goes like this what else can I do
[4:20:17] I sent the best I reserve the best
[4:20:19] message for the last day and I sent it
[4:20:21] and Vindicated it clearly and now the
[4:20:23] people don't want it now they're making
[4:20:25] websites against it
[4:20:27] hello
[4:20:28] what more God's got to be doing this
[4:20:30] thing what more can I do
[4:20:33] we ought to be thanking God for this
[4:20:34] message we ought to be thanking God that
[4:20:36] God allowed this message to be given to
[4:20:38] us in English in your mother tongue
[4:20:41] you ought to be grateful that this
[4:20:43] message is so accessible to you
[4:20:45] that you can have it at your fingertips
[4:20:47] and on your phone and you can have it
[4:20:48] wherever you are whenever whenever you
[4:20:50] need it and wherever you are in the
[4:20:52] world this message is available to you
[4:20:54] now
[4:20:56] I can't help but say this can you
[4:20:57] imagine how much Farrell would have paid
[4:20:59] for air conditioning in his chariot
[4:21:03] I mean
[4:21:04] we got it pretty good imagine imagine
[4:21:08] if you had a recording
[4:21:12] of Jesus teaching in a temple one day
[4:21:16] whoa
[4:21:18] I'd be all right
[4:21:21] imagine if you had a video or YouTube
[4:21:24] of Elijah among Karma
[4:21:27] they'll be all right
[4:21:29] Fire coming right
[4:21:34] more hits than Taylor Swift
[4:21:43] they say she sings I don't know
[4:21:47] imagine
[4:21:49] imagine if you had
[4:21:54] imagine he had a video of an interview
[4:21:57] with the Apostle Paul in the dungeon
[4:22:02] Paul is writing to the Philippians
[4:22:04] whatsoever things are pure whatsoever
[4:22:06] things are wholesome
[4:22:08] whatsoever things are of good report
[4:22:09] think on these things he's in the prison
[4:22:11] I've been in that prison you know that
[4:22:15] in Rome or sorry in in Athens Greece no
[4:22:20] I travel too much
[4:22:22] in Rome
[4:22:24] there is a mammer team prison
[4:22:26] and prisons back in that they were just
[4:22:28] really a hole in the rock and they put a
[4:22:31] lid on top of it and they lowered
[4:22:33] somebody down with a rope if they didn't
[4:22:34] throw them down they just lowered them
[4:22:35] down with a rope and it'd be all kinds
[4:22:37] of Critters down there and bad water and
[4:22:39] things like that it's not a nice place
[4:22:42] and years ago when brother Brandon went
[4:22:44] to Rome they lowered him down into that
[4:22:46] prison
[4:22:47] and he prayed he took time to pray and
[4:22:50] he said this is the place and it is the
[4:22:52] only place on Earth we know where the
[4:22:55] first and last Church age messenger ever
[4:22:56] stood together and brother Rand said
[4:22:58] this was the prison
[4:23:00] and I went in that prison one time as
[4:23:02] when I was in Rome and I went down there
[4:23:04] and you know I mean it's it's just a
[4:23:06] hole in the ground but it is that place
[4:23:09] and you can't stand up in it I have a
[4:23:12] picture of me somebody took in in the
[4:23:14] prison and you can't stand up so it's
[4:23:16] not six feet tall and uh it's it's
[4:23:19] literally just a hole in the ground
[4:23:21] but imagine imagine if if somebody had a
[4:23:25] phone and interviewed an interview with
[4:23:27] Paul
[4:23:28] and and asked them who are you writing
[4:23:30] to oh the Philippians what are you
[4:23:31] writing to them and have wouldn't
[4:23:34] or how about if you had a man how about
[4:23:37] if you had a clip of Martin Luther going
[4:23:40] up to the church in Wittenberg and
[4:23:43] here I stand
[4:23:45] wow
[4:23:48] or you happen to be one of the guys who
[4:23:50] was with John Wesley and he's riding
[4:23:51] through the countryside his horse steps
[4:23:53] in the hole breaks his leg Wesley lays
[4:23:55] hands on the horse gets back on the
[4:23:56] horse and rides off and holds the
[4:23:57] meeting
[4:24:00] I'd be all right
[4:24:03] but you know what God reserved for you
[4:24:07] he recorded everything that Prophet said
[4:24:11] captured it preserved it cleaned it up
[4:24:16] wrapped it up
[4:24:18] and gives it to everybody
[4:24:21] and you can hear exactly what he said
[4:24:25] with the passion and the enthusiasm and
[4:24:29] the Vigor of almighty God coming across
[4:24:32] to us
[4:24:34] how we should value this message no
[4:24:38] other generation no other generation in
[4:24:42] 6 000 years ever had the privilege that
[4:24:45] we have to be able to have this message
[4:24:47] in our hand and God says and they're not
[4:24:49] going to use it
[4:24:50] they're not going to use it to raise
[4:24:51] their families by they're not going to
[4:24:52] use it to live by they're not going to
[4:24:54] use it to to know God they're not going
[4:24:56] to use it to understand the opening of
[4:24:58] the word and the Mysteries that were
[4:24:59] concealed in the Bible all these years
[4:25:00] God must be going like this
[4:25:03] what more can I do
[4:25:06] that's why this is such a powerful verse
[4:25:09] if a man provide not for his own fathers
[4:25:12] don't think that you don't have
[4:25:13] resources you have the greatest resource
[4:25:15] that God could have given to any
[4:25:17] generation is to take some of those
[4:25:19] stories and some of those recordings and
[4:25:22] just play those stories for your kids
[4:25:24] and brother Branham you know going
[4:25:25] across the field going to pray for a man
[4:25:27] right and he says as a minister he's a
[4:25:30] game warden but he's a minister and he's
[4:25:31] going across the field to pray for that
[4:25:33] man you know what he does he takes off
[4:25:35] his gun belt leaves it in the front seat
[4:25:36] of the truck because now he's going as a
[4:25:38] minister he's taken off the mantle of a
[4:25:40] ranger and he's going across now as a as
[4:25:42] a minister pray for a man is over there
[4:25:44] and all of a sudden he sees the bull
[4:25:47] and more importantly the bull sees him
[4:25:51] and you know what he does he apologizes
[4:25:54] to the bull
[4:25:57] how many prophets do you know that have
[4:26:00] ever apologized I mean that's what
[4:26:01] that's what happened I'm just saying
[4:26:03] what he said and he appalled sorry Mr
[4:26:04] Bull he said I Disturbed you and I
[4:26:06] didn't know you were here and he he
[4:26:08] stops like that Sydney Jackson said
[4:26:10] after that event was over and brother
[4:26:12] Branham walked off that field walked
[4:26:14] outside the fence he jumped over the
[4:26:16] fence and he looked back and saw that
[4:26:18] bull he sat on the ground and cried like
[4:26:20] a baby for about 30 minutes
[4:26:23] it was so nerve-wracking
[4:26:27] for him to stand there in the in the
[4:26:29] presence of a killer Bull with nothing
[4:26:30] between me and the bull no fence no no
[4:26:33] protection at all he's completely
[4:26:35] relying on the presence of God in order
[4:26:38] to protect him and he jumps over the
[4:26:40] fence that presence lifts he said he
[4:26:43] cried like a baby for 30 minutes
[4:26:47] now
[4:26:49] has anybody here gotten any inspiration
[4:26:51] about telling a story to their kids
[4:26:56] the last 15 minutes
[4:27:01] Jesse a great man of God
[4:27:04] no doubt told his children's stories
[4:27:10] I know men and women brother Brown said
[4:27:11] that didn't teach their children
[4:27:13] and wasn't Christians the very thing of
[4:27:17] not leading them to Christ
[4:27:19] was the wrongest thing they could ever
[4:27:22] do
[4:27:24] besides the other not to lead them to
[4:27:27] Christ you can't have a correct Union
[4:27:30] without it
[4:27:32] the fellowship
[4:27:33] is broken
[4:27:36] my goodness
[4:27:41] can I just switch for a moment
[4:27:45] and let me I want to just
[4:27:49] I want to just switch here for a moment
[4:27:53] and bring up
[4:28:01] this just this little bit of part three
[4:28:03] just for a moment
[4:28:05] because in this part three and we
[4:28:07] obviously are not going to have time to
[4:28:09] to do this what's our time frame here
[4:28:10] what what did you is it for
[4:28:13] 4 30. huh
[4:28:19] your kids are meant to grow towards
[4:28:22] independence
[4:28:23] you're raising them not to stay you are
[4:28:26] raising them to be independent you are
[4:28:28] raising them to to have their own house
[4:28:31] and their household for God
[4:28:33] you there comes a point where you have
[4:28:35] to let them go now all of you are not
[4:28:37] there and most of you are learning and
[4:28:41] and interested in hearing about how do I
[4:28:43] keep my kids close how do I monitor them
[4:28:46] how do I observe them closely and so
[4:28:49] forth but I will tell you that whether
[4:28:51] you want it or not there will come a
[4:28:53] season where they will they will go and
[4:28:57] I will also tell you too that
[4:29:00] it's important for you to understand
[4:29:02] that God puts that in a young man to
[4:29:05] want to leave and cross over that
[4:29:07] mountain and see what's on the other
[4:29:09] side and establish his own household for
[4:29:11] God God put something in a young woman
[4:29:13] to want to have her own family and to be
[4:29:15] able to raise children and to have her
[4:29:17] own household and have a husband who
[4:29:18] loves her that's not evil
[4:29:21] what you need to prepare for is how they
[4:29:24] leave
[4:29:25] how they leave is what's important you
[4:29:28] want them to leave with your blessing
[4:29:30] and you want them to leave with a sense
[4:29:32] of approval that Mom and Dad are okay
[4:29:35] with this
[4:29:36] even though they might not be happy
[4:29:37] because that's not that was not their
[4:29:39] plan I could read just quotes here where
[4:29:41] brother Branham says our plan was that
[4:29:43] Rebecca he said about Rebecca that she
[4:29:45] would stay and be a secretary and live
[4:29:47] and you know live at home and work in a
[4:29:49] trailer in his backyard he said that's
[4:29:51] what we wanted my wife and I that's what
[4:29:53] we wanted for our lives well you know
[4:29:55] what that's really nice but that's not
[4:29:56] what Rebecca wanted she wanted to get
[4:29:59] married and have her own household right
[4:30:01] and so sometimes our our desires for our
[4:30:04] children are different than the desires
[4:30:07] for uh within the within the children
[4:30:10] themselves and so then what happens next
[4:30:13] what what do we do now this is just my
[4:30:15] wife and I my wife and I are at that at
[4:30:17] this stage now so it's a it's a new
[4:30:19] phase and we're we're learning now
[4:30:20] because there are a lot of adjustments
[4:30:22] we we've raised uh boys and and kids all
[4:30:25] of our Lives we've homeschooled we've
[4:30:27] you know our home was very Central
[4:30:28] everything we did and uh everything we
[4:30:31] did we included him in it so what do we
[4:30:33] do now
[4:30:34] there's a really great article it's in
[4:30:36] your notes here and uh it is out of um
[4:30:39] what's called World magazine that's not
[4:30:41] worldly it is a Christian magazine and
[4:30:44] that magazine is now online you can go
[4:30:46] find it I think it's world.net I think
[4:30:48] but you can find it and he wrote this
[4:30:51] article called We are family now since
[4:30:53] you're turning
[4:30:56] 23.
[4:30:59] this is the article in its entirety and
[4:31:02] you can find it there it's worth reading
[4:31:04] it's very good it's written in 2000 uh
[4:31:06] but for a paragraph or two here he wrote
[4:31:09] as children grow up and begin to have
[4:31:11] children of their own whereupon they
[4:31:13] grow up to have children until both the
[4:31:15] Earth and Heaven are indeed filled with
[4:31:17] a particular couple's large posterity
[4:31:19] the family is God's invention so that
[4:31:22] was the intent that God wanted to have
[4:31:24] an earth populated with good children
[4:31:28] and he protects that principle in the
[4:31:31] Ten Commandments since our dependence is
[4:31:33] on him like a helpless baby to a loving
[4:31:36] parent and we are to address him as our
[4:31:38] father since his relationship to us in
[4:31:40] Christ is as loving and intimate as that
[4:31:42] between a groom and his bride the church
[4:31:45] is called the bride of Christ that
[4:31:46] doesn't mean it's not in the message
[4:31:48] here
[4:31:49] but I thought it was very well written
[4:31:51] he said although the family is the basis
[4:31:53] of culture as any Anthropologist will
[4:31:55] say today parents often find themselves
[4:31:57] having to protect their children from
[4:31:59] their own culture
[4:32:02] they are the basis of culture but we
[4:32:05] find ourselves protecting the children
[4:32:06] from the culture
[4:32:08] that they're living in
[4:32:10] instead of helping parents to teach
[4:32:12] children to control themselves and to
[4:32:14] act morally and mature into adults our
[4:32:16] society in its entertainment industry at
[4:32:19] Schools and Government often seems to
[4:32:21] undermine parents and be at war against
[4:32:24] the children
[4:32:26] you have this dichotomy you have this
[4:32:28] this conflict that's inherent here that
[4:32:30] what I'm teaching them at home is not
[4:32:32] what they're hearing outside
[4:32:33] and and and this becomes a frustrating
[4:32:35] cycle because the kids are they look up
[4:32:37] to teachers as authorities they look up
[4:32:40] to uh Educators and and the people who
[4:32:43] are leaders and coaches and so forth
[4:32:45] they look at them as people who they
[4:32:47] know the difference
[4:32:48] and they're telling me something
[4:32:49] different than what my parents are
[4:32:50] telling me so we have a we have an
[4:32:52] inherent conflict
[4:32:54] and as a result of that
[4:32:57] kids are actually
[4:32:59] they're actually staying home longer
[4:33:03] with their parents
[4:33:04] not necessarily because that's a good
[4:33:06] thing but because they're scared of
[4:33:08] marriage
[4:33:09] and the statistics bear that out it's
[4:33:11] back on the rise again
[4:33:14] so
[4:33:18] let me skip
[4:33:20] C.S Lewis wrote this
[4:33:23] and said interestingly God is not so
[4:33:26] much offended that we want too much
[4:33:29] as by the fact that we are satisfied
[4:33:31] with so little
[4:33:34] God is not so much offended that we want
[4:33:35] too much as by the fact that we are
[4:33:38] satisfied with so little
[4:33:41] he offers
[4:33:43] us the highest of Adventures in our
[4:33:45] Christian Life
[4:33:46] and we settle for the stale mediocrity
[4:33:50] of lukewarm routines
[4:33:52] I ain't just going to church and it's
[4:33:55] Sunday so we'll go and it's Wednesday so
[4:33:57] we'll go
[4:33:58] for parents the counterpart to this idea
[4:34:00] is that most mothers and fathers
[4:34:02] actually want too little for their
[4:34:04] children they settle for success in the
[4:34:06] world's terms but God would have us aim
[4:34:09] higher
[4:34:10] not like an ambitious stage mother
[4:34:12] pushing her child uh my only talented
[4:34:16] children into the spotlight but watch
[4:34:18] like a fine Jeweler making the best
[4:34:20] possible use of each bit of gold and
[4:34:23] silver and precious stone that he has my
[4:34:27] children are Priceless treasures and I
[4:34:29] want God's highest and best for them
[4:34:33] that's C.S Lewis
[4:34:35] sometimes we can settle for too little
[4:34:37] and think well you know what he's not
[4:34:39] smoking and drinking and he doesn't have
[4:34:41] any tattoos or metal sticking in his
[4:34:43] body so you know what on the curve he's
[4:34:45] okay Hey listen we're not people who
[4:34:46] judge things by the Curve
[4:34:49] we should be praying for our children
[4:34:51] and we should be proactively encouraging
[4:34:53] our children hey seek God's best and and
[4:34:56] and not be satisfied with just what
[4:34:58] everybody else is doing and they're
[4:34:59] doing this over in this church over here
[4:35:01] so it must be okay you need to find that
[4:35:03] path that God has ordained you for as
[4:35:05] God's put you here for a purpose and you
[4:35:07] need to seek that with all your heart
[4:35:08] and just let God lead you into that into
[4:35:11] that place that God is going to use you
[4:35:12] for hey we should be encouraging our
[4:35:14] kids to do that not just like uh some
[4:35:17] some uh leftover somebody swept Along by
[4:35:20] the flow of things and by the crowd Hey
[4:35:22] listen God wants great things for your
[4:35:24] children God wants great things for your
[4:35:25] family you need to open up your mind to
[4:35:28] the possibility of that and ask God Lord
[4:35:30] do whatever it takes in our family here
[4:35:32] change me change my wife change whatever
[4:35:35] is necessary in order for our kids to
[4:35:37] step on that platform and keep going and
[4:35:39] Ascend the place that you have for them
[4:35:42] May nothing in this household be a
[4:35:44] hindrance
[4:35:45] to God fulfilling that part
[4:35:53] there is a
[4:35:55] a principle
[4:35:57] and climbing mountains
[4:36:00] and I've I've been here
[4:36:03] I've been near the base camp of Mount
[4:36:05] Everest
[4:36:06] and there's lots of people who pay 70
[4:36:09] 000 Plus in order to climb Everest
[4:36:12] doesn't take a huge amount of skill to
[4:36:14] get to the base camp and then to get to
[4:36:16] a couple of the other stages that are
[4:36:18] there but from 26 000 feet to the peak
[4:36:22] is what is referred to as the death zone
[4:36:25] and if you're going to die you're
[4:36:26] probably going to die there all you need
[4:36:29] is a wind shift and it could be over in
[4:36:32] climbing Everest and that's why they
[4:36:33] call it the death zone
[4:36:35] you don't climb all the way up to 26 000
[4:36:38] feet look at your Sherpa guides and say
[4:36:41] hey we got this
[4:36:43] we're good
[4:36:44] you can go back now
[4:36:48] you need you need them
[4:36:51] at this particular point
[4:36:53] when you're this high
[4:36:56] you need them right there
[4:37:00] I was
[4:37:01] at Everest and I uh just to let you know
[4:37:05] how dangerous this is
[4:37:06] I was I was flying from Darjeeling in
[4:37:10] India
[4:37:11] to
[4:37:12] uh Kathmandu Nepal which is the Nepal is
[4:37:16] the country where Everest is and and
[4:37:17] Kathmandu is the capital and so we had
[4:37:20] to fly over Everest
[4:37:22] to get there okay we got it's all
[4:37:24] mountains in that area and you got to
[4:37:25] fly over the top so the pot we were in a
[4:37:27] in a big jet
[4:37:29] and the pilot comes on this is 1978.
[4:37:36] something there and the pilot comes on
[4:37:39] and he says well folks he said today is
[4:37:40] a rare day uh
[4:37:43] we have a clear sky
[4:37:45] there are no clouds today said so that
[4:37:47] means we're going to
[4:37:49] we're going to try to fly over the top
[4:37:51] of Everest and let you see the Peak from
[4:37:54] above so whatever side of the plane
[4:37:56] you're on it doesn't matter you're going
[4:37:57] to be able to look out and see the sides
[4:37:59] of Everest as we go over the top here
[4:38:00] and he says this this is a rare thing
[4:38:03] because it's always cloudy it has its
[4:38:05] own weather pattern and it's a rare day
[4:38:07] so he says so we're gonna we're gonna
[4:38:10] approach the mountain now from the south
[4:38:12] and then we're gonna go over the top and
[4:38:14] so he he revs up the engine you can hear
[4:38:16] it he revs up the end just a big jet now
[4:38:18] and the plane starts to do this number
[4:38:20] like one of my sons when I was
[4:38:22] disciplining him and it starts to quiver
[4:38:24] and shake like that and he's just trying
[4:38:26] to fly this thing and then he goes yeah
[4:38:28] like this and he said sorry folks can't
[4:38:31] do it he said we'll try this again he
[4:38:34] said there's so much wind and force
[4:38:36] coming up the side of this mountain he
[4:38:39] said that it's pushing the plane back so
[4:38:41] we can't do it and he said let's try it
[4:38:44] again you know it's like a lottery
[4:38:46] ticket right not a plane ticket
[4:38:48] and he does the same thing goes up to
[4:38:50] the mountain and starts to do this thing
[4:38:51] and shake and quiver and you can hear
[4:38:53] the rattling in the plane and he says
[4:38:56] yeah he comes on he says no we can't do
[4:38:58] we're going to have to go around so he
[4:38:59] makes us sweep around and comes down
[4:39:01] lands in in Kathmandu
[4:39:04] it is that powerful it is that dangerous
[4:39:07] up there and it looks really pretty
[4:39:08] right all the pictures there looks
[4:39:10] really pretty it's a very very dangerous
[4:39:12] place you do not want to let your guides
[4:39:14] go
[4:39:15] the last three thousand feet
[4:39:18] you've managed to climb 26 000 you don't
[4:39:21] want to let your guides go
[4:39:22] and neither do you want your guides to
[4:39:24] say you know what you're in pretty good
[4:39:26] shape you guys have done pretty good up
[4:39:27] to 26 000 feet why don't we uh hey we'll
[4:39:30] see you when you get down
[4:39:32] uh hello
[4:39:34] now is when we really need you
[4:39:38] in some of these articles that are
[4:39:40] written here
[4:39:41] this is the sad thing about a lot of
[4:39:45] teenagers and young people today they're
[4:39:46] being taught to make these decisions on
[4:39:49] their own you're now in what is referred
[4:39:51] to in those teen years the death zone
[4:39:53] because there's a lot of Temptations out
[4:39:55] there that are not really been dealt
[4:39:57] with in any other age and there are
[4:40:00] subtle traps that Satan is laying out
[4:40:02] there and you know what you need good
[4:40:04] guidance you need good leadership you
[4:40:07] need Sound Advice in that time period
[4:40:09] when they're getting married when
[4:40:10] they're establishing their own
[4:40:11] households when they're buying their
[4:40:13] first house and when they're all of a
[4:40:16] sudden now making contractual agreements
[4:40:18] to have a credit card and have death and
[4:40:21] to be able to sign for a loan and all
[4:40:22] the rest of it you know what they need
[4:40:24] they need good advice right then they
[4:40:25] need good advice and it's the last three
[4:40:28] thousand feet before they establish
[4:40:30] their own household and their own place
[4:40:32] for God they absolutely do need that
[4:40:34] during that time
[4:40:37] you don't want to you want to encourage
[4:40:39] your your teenagers don't dismiss the
[4:40:42] help that God's put in your pathway what
[4:40:44] before this thing is over you want to
[4:40:46] make sure that you incorporate all the
[4:40:49] wise counsel and advice you possibly can
[4:40:51] while you have that advice and don't
[4:40:53] dismiss it it is absolutely it is
[4:40:56] absolutely imperative for you making the
[4:40:58] right decision
[4:41:00] during that season of life
[4:41:06] Greg Harris wrote no I'm sorry let me go
[4:41:09] back just one screen Greg Harris wrote
[4:41:11] walking with the wise
[4:41:14] is a lifestyle not a program
[4:41:19] he's referring to Proverbs 13 20. He
[4:41:22] that walketh with the wise shall be wise
[4:41:24] but a companion of food shall be
[4:41:26] destroyed
[4:41:27] if you want to be wise hang around with
[4:41:29] wise people
[4:41:32] for young people it's really important
[4:41:34] for them to find mentors and that's what
[4:41:36] I was talking about this morning that I
[4:41:39] encourage my sons if you're thinking
[4:41:40] about law find somebody who practices
[4:41:42] law and talk to them so that you can
[4:41:44] understand what practicing law really is
[4:41:46] like or working on a construction team
[4:41:48] or working in a hospital being a
[4:41:50] volunteer and pushing a broom and see
[4:41:52] could I go in the hospital every day and
[4:41:54] smell that could I go into hospital
[4:41:56] every day and listen to people hollering
[4:41:58] because they're in pain would I be able
[4:42:00] to do that well in theory and on a
[4:42:02] website that might be neat
[4:42:04] because you know they look at the dollar
[4:42:06] signs but in reality people are called
[4:42:09] to do a particular job like that you
[4:42:11] need to immerse yourself in here and and
[4:42:13] get a look at what that really is and a
[4:42:16] lot of times you talk to kids and
[4:42:17] they're in college how long have you
[4:42:18] been in college three years what are you
[4:42:19] studying I really don't know
[4:42:23] mystery 101.
[4:42:26] hey save your money get a job
[4:42:29] save your money
[4:42:31] all you're doing is prolonging
[4:42:33] adolescence
[4:42:34] most times adolescents already know what
[4:42:37] they're doing and it's a shame to be in
[4:42:39] college and spending that much money
[4:42:40] continuing to do what they don't know
[4:42:42] what they're doing
[4:42:44] now
[4:42:45] there are exceptions here some of you
[4:42:47] are looking at me funny
[4:42:51] girl walking with the wise is a
[4:42:53] lifestyle not a program
[4:42:55] it includes walking working together
[4:42:56] eating together playing together
[4:42:58] worshiping together studying together
[4:43:00] and this is where God placed the
[4:43:01] responsibility for child training and
[4:43:03] education and it works very well in
[4:43:06] aiming children at God's highest and
[4:43:08] best Targets in life
[4:43:11] that's what I want for my children God's
[4:43:14] highest and best I don't want my
[4:43:16] children to be merely counted among the
[4:43:18] redeemed or the reformed I want them to
[4:43:20] stand with the reformers
[4:43:23] understand what he's saying now that's
[4:43:25] what I want from my children God's
[4:43:26] highest and best I don't want my
[4:43:28] children to be merely counted among the
[4:43:30] reformed I want them to stand with the
[4:43:32] reformers
[4:43:35] brother random taught us that God will
[4:43:37] use whatever you give him
[4:43:39] I think it's a great thing to teach your
[4:43:41] children give everything you have to God
[4:43:43] at an early age give them your wallet
[4:43:45] give them your car keys give them your
[4:43:46] hands give them your mind give them your
[4:43:48] eyes give me your mouth and let God use
[4:43:50] whatever he wants to use
[4:43:53] because then you can stand among the
[4:43:55] reformers
[4:43:56] now
[4:43:59] I wanna I wanna just uh
[4:44:02] for a moment just talk about the
[4:44:04] scripture here Psalm 128 David writes
[4:44:06] blessed is every man that feareth the
[4:44:08] Lord that walketh in his ways for thou
[4:44:10] shall eat to labor thine hands and happy
[4:44:12] shalt thou be and it shall be well with
[4:44:14] thee and he's speaking of a man here and
[4:44:17] I we can easily show that
[4:44:20] blessed is every man that fears the Lord
[4:44:23] thy wife shall be as a fruitful Vine by
[4:44:27] the sides of thine house
[4:44:30] I don't know if you've ever seen a a
[4:44:32] Vine that will grow like uh I've been in
[4:44:35] in Ireland and England Scotland many
[4:44:37] times and you see those Vines creeping
[4:44:40] up the side of a brick building Stone
[4:44:43] building
[4:44:45] and it's amazing how how they've
[4:44:48] survived and done that for hundreds and
[4:44:49] hundreds of years
[4:44:51] in our country you see Vines growing up
[4:44:53] vinyl siding figure that out
[4:44:56] what nourishment are they getting out of
[4:44:58] vinyl siding right
[4:45:00] but Vines do three things they cling
[4:45:03] they cluster
[4:45:05] and they repeat
[4:45:07] Vines will cling they'll cluster
[4:45:09] together and then it'll repeat and do it
[4:45:11] again and David is David is saying and
[4:45:15] God is telling him blessed is a man that
[4:45:17] fear of the Lord his wife is going to
[4:45:19] prosper she's going to continue on she's
[4:45:21] gonna she's gonna grow she's gonna
[4:45:23] continue to become what God wants her to
[4:45:25] become and thy children watch
[4:45:28] like Olive plants around the table
[4:45:31] really
[4:45:33] it's interesting about Olive plants and
[4:45:35] I'll give you the short story
[4:45:37] in the hard Rocky dry soil of the Middle
[4:45:40] East
[4:45:42] any kind of plant doesn't grow easily so
[4:45:45] if you want to have an olive tree you've
[4:45:47] got to take a little plant little
[4:45:49] sapling and put it in the ground and
[4:45:52] water it and nurture it intend it and
[4:45:54] prune it very carefully because it'll
[4:45:57] dry out and die really quickly
[4:45:59] it takes about
[4:46:01] 15 or 16 years
[4:46:04] for a little plant
[4:46:07] to really put down roots in the Middle
[4:46:09] Eastern soil
[4:46:11] and survive on its own it actually takes
[4:46:14] about that long 15 or 16 years but once
[4:46:17] it gets established
[4:46:19] for the next 40 Years it'll produce
[4:46:22] and after 40 Years it'll slow down
[4:46:25] hello
[4:46:28] when a man fears the Lord
[4:46:31] his children will be like Olive plants
[4:46:34] and you're going to have to tend to them
[4:46:36] for 15 16 17 18 years or so because
[4:46:41] they're going to need to a little help
[4:46:44] in standing on their own but there will
[4:46:46] come a day when they will stand on their
[4:46:48] own and you know what over the next 40
[4:46:50] years you'll probably get some
[4:46:51] grandchildren
[4:46:54] that's the fruit you're looking for
[4:46:55] right that's the fruit we were looking
[4:46:57] for to have gr you know to see that to
[4:47:00] see that young tree now produce on its
[4:47:04] own now to develop its own life and have
[4:47:06] its own family tree that's the idea you
[4:47:08] want your children to grow and become
[4:47:10] that Family Tree on their own and he
[4:47:13] says and behold that thus the man will
[4:47:15] be blessed that fear is the Lord in
[4:47:17] other words that's the right fruit of a
[4:47:19] man who fears God he has children and he
[4:47:22] has children's children and the the tree
[4:47:24] grows the family tree grows that's the
[4:47:27] idea and that was God's intent in the
[4:47:29] first place is to have a family tree
[4:47:31] that spread well beyond just that
[4:47:33] initial family but it would have lots of
[4:47:36] branches to it and the Earth would be
[4:47:38] filled with all of those children that
[4:47:41] God intended for us to have how many can
[4:47:44] say Amen
[4:47:46] now
[4:47:48] let me just I'm going to skip here and I
[4:47:50] realize that you're being very patient
[4:47:52] and very uh very gracious here but I
[4:47:56] know it's the afternoon
[4:47:58] and I want to give you one more
[4:48:01] quotation
[4:48:02] this will be my last quotation it's
[4:48:04] going to take me 45 minutes to get read
[4:48:06] it but no I'm only kidding
[4:48:10] brother Branham
[4:48:11] will All Sons and Daughters of True
[4:48:13] born-again Believers be saved that's the
[4:48:15] question
[4:48:17] I need you to watch what he says now
[4:48:19] okay and I'm wrapping up so just bear
[4:48:21] with me a little bit
[4:48:23] no brother no they sure won't
[4:48:25] they'll have to be born again just like
[4:48:27] their father and mother was born of the
[4:48:28] spirit and that's what makes a man a new
[4:48:30] person in Christ is when they're born
[4:48:32] again so just because they live in your
[4:48:35] house doesn't mean that their bride in
[4:48:37] the same way that if you went and stood
[4:48:38] in the forest it wouldn't make you a
[4:48:39] tree
[4:48:41] right
[4:48:43] I said just because your children are
[4:48:44] raised in your house doesn't make them
[4:48:46] believers
[4:48:47] in the same way that you stood and if
[4:48:49] you went and stood in your garage you
[4:48:50] wouldn't be a car
[4:48:52] right you got to be born a car
[4:48:55] in order to be a car
[4:48:57] you got it
[4:49:00] so he says you believe on the Lord Jesus
[4:49:01] Christ and thou shall be thou and the
[4:49:03] household shall be saved and you pray
[4:49:05] and commit your children to God and hold
[4:49:06] on unto God and believing they will be
[4:49:09] saved what else can you do because you
[4:49:11] you're not their Savior and you can't
[4:49:12] guarantee their salvation or their
[4:49:15] Eternal Destiny that's never been in
[4:49:16] your hands right so you can really just
[4:49:19] pray and commit them to God and trust
[4:49:20] that God will take care of the rest
[4:49:23] and he says I just went through that
[4:49:26] experience with my Rebecca
[4:49:27] so now he tells this personal story now
[4:49:30] I want you to watch the story
[4:49:32] he said just committed to God and when
[4:49:35] she got and I'm editing this okay just
[4:49:37] for time's sake
[4:49:40] when she got to that little teeny stage
[4:49:43] and she was going with some girl
[4:49:46] we first went out there and this is out
[4:49:48] in Arizona run over to some girl's house
[4:49:51] taking music lessons and I came by one
[4:49:53] day brother Mann came by where she was
[4:49:54] taking lessons
[4:49:56] and he said and here the girl was
[4:49:58] sitting there at the piano playing rock
[4:50:00] and roll
[4:50:02] well he said that was just enough for me
[4:50:04] so I told her to stay away from F from
[4:50:07] over there and she said well it's the
[4:50:10] only place I got to go to take music and
[4:50:12] he said now every kid goes through that
[4:50:14] practically every kid goes through that
[4:50:16] age he said we got to think their
[4:50:19] thoughts
[4:50:20] so now she's being imagine now she's
[4:50:23] this is a prophet and and even though
[4:50:25] it's her father now she's she's saying
[4:50:28] things like this back to him
[4:50:30] so then a few days after her mother got
[4:50:32] after her for something and she sassed
[4:50:35] her and he said now that's not Rebecca
[4:50:37] at all she took off and slammed the door
[4:50:39] and almost knocked things off the wall
[4:50:40] and went to school and I thought my
[4:50:43] initial reaction was I'll take my belt
[4:50:45] off
[4:50:46] right that was his initial reaction
[4:50:49] but I thought wait a minute I got to
[4:50:52] thank 18 year old thoughts
[4:50:55] you know what he's you know what he's
[4:50:56] going through he's going through another
[4:50:57] stage
[4:50:59] Trevor what page are you on there
[4:51:02] is on page 30. this whole quote is on
[4:51:04] page 30. so you can you can read
[4:51:07] and meet us started crying and said I I
[4:51:10] know and I said I know you've done all
[4:51:12] you can do and I've done all I can do
[4:51:15] but now if it's out of our hands
[4:51:18] we got to take another step because you
[4:51:20] know what these are not kids anymore
[4:51:22] these are not little kids she's 18 years
[4:51:25] old
[4:51:26] well look honey now you got to listen to
[4:51:29] me and I it's hard for you to do this
[4:51:30] I'm your husband people drive across the
[4:51:32] nation they get a few words of advice I
[4:51:34] understand that I know but he said now
[4:51:36] Becky never did that to me and when her
[4:51:38] mother said something and she slammed
[4:51:40] the door and she said you expect me to
[4:51:42] sit here and be a Wallflower all my life
[4:51:44] and blam me she slammed the door and
[4:51:46] went out
[4:51:48] that was the devil
[4:51:51] so now you see the the tension here
[4:51:54] right see the tension in this in this
[4:51:57] situation here and it's just kind of
[4:52:00] landed on their lap
[4:52:03] they've raised her the best they could
[4:52:05] and brother man tells experiences with
[4:52:07] Rebecca in the early years how she cried
[4:52:09] for those first two years until the
[4:52:11] angel said pray for her and so forth he
[4:52:13] explains all of that
[4:52:15] but now here we are at a point where
[4:52:17] she's just throwing seemingly throwing
[4:52:20] all that back at her parents and he said
[4:52:24] and I took midi for about an hour and I
[4:52:26] said meaty take your hands off
[4:52:30] you can't deal with this like you used
[4:52:33] to deal with this
[4:52:35] now we have to deal with this
[4:52:37] differently
[4:52:39] and she said me that's my kid and I said
[4:52:42] brother mam said isn't it mine too
[4:52:46] if she was dying this morning you'd have
[4:52:48] to commit her to God for her Eternal
[4:52:50] Destiny why can't we commit her to God
[4:52:52] now for her Earthly Journey
[4:52:55] so you understand now he's switched he's
[4:52:56] making a switch it's not easy now for a
[4:52:59] father to make a switch like this with
[4:53:00] his daughter but he's realizing we you
[4:53:02] know what we've turned a corner here
[4:53:03] boys and this is now a little bit
[4:53:05] differently we've got to think a little
[4:53:06] bit differently it would be unfair for
[4:53:08] us to treat her like a 12 year old she's
[4:53:11] not and so we gotta well you know what
[4:53:12] we gotta face the music here we got to
[4:53:14] face the reality that this is how it is
[4:53:17] and sister media said me not say
[4:53:19] anything to her and I said I never said
[4:53:21] that but we'll quit scolding her we'll
[4:53:24] just advise her she needs a buddy and
[4:53:27] you're the one to be her buddy you and I
[4:53:29] we're her parents
[4:53:33] so they're moving into a different phase
[4:53:35] now this relationship and he said these
[4:53:37] kids today need a buddy so we got down
[4:53:39] there in our knees
[4:53:40] and we committed it to God
[4:53:44] and I said I know she's 18 years old and
[4:53:47] a girl that age will think about boys
[4:53:49] and we've kept her in and I never wanted
[4:53:52] to see her get married I want to put her
[4:53:54] in the office and do the work I want to
[4:53:56] see her filled with the spirit and walk
[4:53:57] like that we all wanted that well
[4:54:00] Rebecca didn't right
[4:54:02] we've raised her all we can and put her
[4:54:04] in the hands of God and commit her uh
[4:54:07] you know back to God
[4:54:09] and I said that's when she then when she
[4:54:13] does anything say Becky darling mother
[4:54:15] don't want you to do that but I'm your
[4:54:16] pal I'll stick by you and let her know
[4:54:18] that you love her she's going to get
[4:54:21] somebody to love her it might be the
[4:54:23] wrong woman
[4:54:28] you got to be making sure that you're
[4:54:30] the relationship holds you in the time
[4:54:33] you can't apply the physical
[4:54:35] restrictions
[4:54:37] what what's what's going to hold this
[4:54:39] thing together now it's the relationship
[4:54:42] that's it
[4:54:44] he doesn't have secret weapons here he
[4:54:46] doesn't have uh you know he can't he
[4:54:48] can't you know pull the toys out of a
[4:54:50] room or something else it's a
[4:54:52] relationship that's going to hold this
[4:54:53] thing together that's it
[4:54:56] committing this to God and sometimes you
[4:54:58] know what folks that's what we're down
[4:54:59] to
[4:55:00] when it comes to your teenage children
[4:55:01] your older kids sometimes that's all
[4:55:03] you've got is your relate your
[4:55:05] relationship with God their relationship
[4:55:07] with God and my relationship with that
[4:55:09] child
[4:55:12] and he says now if you don't give her
[4:55:15] the right kind of love somebody else
[4:55:16] will step right in there and give her
[4:55:17] the wrong kind of love and you be that
[4:55:19] woman that does that loving honey that
[4:55:21] sounds kind of crude and I'm common
[4:55:22] we're common to one another because
[4:55:24] we're husband and wife but we never let
[4:55:26] that happen we must remember at this we
[4:55:28] must excuse me remember this is in the
[4:55:31] name of the Lord
[4:55:33] and so she said all right we got down
[4:55:35] committed at the Lord and said I'll said
[4:55:38] we take our hands off it and that
[4:55:40] afternoon she came in and she said well
[4:55:42] I guess you're going to say I can't go
[4:55:43] over there this is the last screen and
[4:55:45] Meaty said no I never said anything
[4:55:47] about it you know mother don't want you
[4:55:49] to do that you know would like to kill
[4:55:50] your your daddy when you heard when he
[4:55:53] heard you up there playing the boogie
[4:55:54] boogie music and never what it was with
[4:55:56] that girl
[4:55:57] he didn't want you to do that and we
[4:56:00] don't want you to do that
[4:56:01] but Becky we just committed it to the
[4:56:04] Lord
[4:56:05] and I want you to know that we love you
[4:56:06] whether you do whatever you do we still
[4:56:10] love you
[4:56:13] that is unconditional love
[4:56:17] my love for you does not be depend on
[4:56:20] your behavior hey aren't you glad that
[4:56:22] Jesus Christ doesn't love you based on
[4:56:24] your behavior
[4:56:26] he loves us unconditionally
[4:56:28] so now in this relationship in this
[4:56:31] household Grace is introduced in a way
[4:56:33] it's never been introduced before
[4:56:35] and now unconditional love is being
[4:56:37] practiced here and she hollered and said
[4:56:39] well I'm going anyhow and said all right
[4:56:41] dear all right I'll have supper for you
[4:56:43] when you come back
[4:56:44] and she never did go and she never has
[4:56:46] been there since not long after that she
[4:56:48] met George George is a Christian
[4:56:52] and the rest is history
[4:56:56] so sometimes it's not being stronger
[4:56:59] sometimes it is just being
[4:57:02] wise
[4:57:12] let's close our notes
[4:57:14] and let me just tell you a little story
[4:57:16] and then we'll quit
[4:57:21] you know when it comes to fathers and it
[4:57:23] comes to
[4:57:26] raising kids hey there there are just
[4:57:29] lots and lots of challenges and some of
[4:57:30] you that are here today you might be
[4:57:32] hearing all of this and saying uh where
[4:57:34] can I sign up to quit
[4:57:38] how do I get out of this
[4:57:40] and I I will tell you this
[4:57:43] be rest assured of this that if you're
[4:57:45] raising children today I want you to
[4:57:47] know this I'll be praying for you
[4:57:49] because we need to be praying one for
[4:57:52] another and in your church you need to
[4:57:54] come to church and say Lord bless my
[4:57:57] family
[4:57:58] and bless every family in this church
[4:58:02] and help us to do our very best at
[4:58:04] leaning on your word and leaning into
[4:58:06] the leading of the Lord that we can
[4:58:08] raise our kids and because all churches
[4:58:10] is a group of families that have come
[4:58:12] together right so whenever you do
[4:58:13] anything to strengthen the family you
[4:58:14] strengthen the church because that's all
[4:58:16] churches a bunch of families
[4:58:19] so
[4:58:21] sometimes you know it's it's not the
[4:58:25] great big things it's not one great big
[4:58:27] thing it's not some extraordinary thing
[4:58:29] a lot of times it's just the little
[4:58:30] things
[4:58:32] that make a difference in your child's
[4:58:34] life
[4:58:37] and uh
[4:58:39] I remember
[4:58:41] you know in Ohio
[4:58:43] county fairs are a big deal right
[4:58:46] yeah
[4:58:47] some of you folks that have eaten just a
[4:58:49] little too many elephant ears are
[4:58:51] looking at me saying
[4:58:52] Amen brother Barry amen
[4:58:56] and uh in Hocking County we had a County
[4:59:00] Fair and uh
[4:59:04] that's not Hocking County
[4:59:06] by the way
[4:59:08] but we had a county fair and my our boys
[4:59:11] were in a 4-H club and sister Becky was
[4:59:12] the queen of 4-H back in our day because
[4:59:14] I was to Scouts what she was to 4-H so
[4:59:18] the boys were in 4-H and they learned a
[4:59:19] bunch of stuff and she was the den
[4:59:21] mother of uh 4-H for a little she she
[4:59:25] participated and went to all the
[4:59:27] functions and so forth and we got
[4:59:28] involved in a horse Club believe it or
[4:59:30] not a horse club now I didn't know the
[4:59:34] first thing about horses but my in-laws
[4:59:37] thought the best thing that my boys
[4:59:38] could use in life as a horse
[4:59:41] my in-laws thought that I didn't think
[4:59:43] that but my in-laws were convinced that
[4:59:45] that's what they needed now I didn't
[4:59:47] know anything about horses and I still
[4:59:49] know very little
[4:59:50] matter of fact I didn't even know what
[4:59:52] side was the hairiest side of a horse do
[4:59:54] you know what side is the hairiest side
[4:59:56] of a horse
[4:59:58] the hairiest the side with the most
[4:59:59] hairs anybody know what side of the
[5:00:02] horse has the most hair
[5:00:03] the outside you're right see mostly
[5:00:07] didn't even know that
[5:00:09] so my parents my in-laws one day they
[5:00:12] roll up in our yard up in Ohio when we
[5:00:14] lived in Logan they rolled up in the
[5:00:16] yard and they were pulling a horse
[5:00:17] trailer and had a Welsh racking Pony in
[5:00:20] the back of it and they said here you go
[5:00:22] guys
[5:00:23] and I said I'm having nothing to do with
[5:00:26] that horse
[5:00:28] that's your horse I'm having nothing to
[5:00:30] do with it they knew less about horses
[5:00:32] than I did and I had to look after that
[5:00:35] horse until it died I mean it was we
[5:00:38] were we were close buddies by the time
[5:00:40] we've done
[5:00:42] it was a great Pony it had been raised
[5:00:45] in a family that took it to shows and
[5:00:47] when I when I talk about 4-H shows we're
[5:00:50] talking about running barrels anybody
[5:00:51] know what running barrels is or uh
[5:00:54] Showmanship
[5:00:55] right simple stuff parading around the
[5:00:58] parade field and running barrels or
[5:01:01] doing trots and different things you
[5:01:04] know just real basic stuff in
[5:01:06] horsemanship and that's what we did in
[5:01:08] the Hocking County Fair and every year
[5:01:09] we'd go up and do that in the Hocking
[5:01:12] County Fair a lot of fun kids enjoyed it
[5:01:14] I did the work
[5:01:15] but they enjoyed it
[5:01:18] matter of fact if if Now by now you know
[5:01:21] my kids Andrew would dress up in the
[5:01:23] cowboy hat in the vest and walk around
[5:01:25] like this you know Peter would be over
[5:01:27] there shoveling the muck out of the
[5:01:29] Stalls and you know loved it
[5:01:31] and uh we'd go out there with all the
[5:01:34] kids and they had everybody segregated
[5:01:36] in the different age groups
[5:01:38] and these were all little kids now seven
[5:01:40] eight nine ten years old
[5:01:42] and uh
[5:01:45] in the group
[5:01:46] was a little down syndrome boy
[5:01:50] and his name was Danny kalamanus
[5:01:54] Danny had Down syndrome so he was a
[5:01:57] hefty young guy but he was only about 10
[5:01:59] or 11. he's a big guy
[5:02:02] and very nice little boy but very very
[5:02:06] simple just in his way and and we all
[5:02:08] knew Danny and when Danny uh
[5:02:11] participated in the county fair
[5:02:13] uh he he was always in his own class he
[5:02:18] was in the handicapped class and he was
[5:02:19] the only kid in the handicap class so in
[5:02:22] every uh event that he participated in
[5:02:25] guess who won Danny
[5:02:28] and uh
[5:02:30] and I I remember you know at the end of
[5:02:32] the day when they give out the trophies
[5:02:34] he'd have the big trophy and he'd be so
[5:02:37] proud he'd be holding his trophy and
[5:02:38] they'd all sit on the fence and they'd
[5:02:40] take a picture for the newspaper and
[5:02:41] Danny be holding his big trophy first
[5:02:43] place and best in his class and so forth
[5:02:46] and he had a big smile on his face and a
[5:02:48] big white Stetson hand I can still see
[5:02:50] him and he was just so proud he'd smile
[5:02:52] and you know get his picture made and be
[5:02:54] in the paper every year he won
[5:02:56] and you know what we all I mean that was
[5:02:59] just a fact of life
[5:03:01] but what was really touching about that
[5:03:04] story was every year we'd see
[5:03:07] Danny's Family drive up and the father
[5:03:09] would be there and he just he just kind
[5:03:12] of a guy you know what I don't even know
[5:03:14] his name I know him only as Mr kalamanas
[5:03:18] and he'd get up he'd Park his truck and
[5:03:21] come around the back and open it up take
[5:03:22] the horse out and get a bit of hay feed
[5:03:25] the horse and
[5:03:26] get his saddle get his tack out and put
[5:03:29] it on the horse and get it ready make
[5:03:31] sure it had a bit of water
[5:03:32] and he would he would then walk it over
[5:03:35] to the stall and you know get get lined
[5:03:39] up with all the other kids that were
[5:03:40] there
[5:03:41] Danny would do this Danny would
[5:03:43] he had he had a new vest on every year
[5:03:46] he had a new vest in his boots and his
[5:03:48] stets in half and he wouldn't bend you
[5:03:50] know he didn't want to wrinkle anything
[5:03:51] and he was just he just like he was so
[5:03:54] proud to be there so happy to be there
[5:03:55] finally at the fair and and everybody's
[5:03:58] you know looking at him and he was just
[5:04:00] so so delighted you know and we love
[5:04:02] Danny I mean he's a great guy and and
[5:04:04] because Danny was was down syndrome he
[5:04:08] couldn't take the horse by himself
[5:04:10] right he couldn't ride off and do
[5:04:11] barrels by himself
[5:04:13] so his father would take the reins and
[5:04:16] he was allowed to do this and he'd take
[5:04:18] the reins and he'd run like this and run
[5:04:20] the barrels and run around and and Danny
[5:04:22] as he was riding around the ring Danny
[5:04:26] would hold on to the reins and lean back
[5:04:28] and he'd he'd squealed I can still hear
[5:04:30] him he'd squeal like in the air as he
[5:04:34] was so happy to be moving fast you know
[5:04:36] and he's just moving along in a truck
[5:04:37] but his father would come along like
[5:04:40] this and he'd stop and I'd see I can
[5:04:41] still see him and he would stop in the
[5:04:43] dust had just come up you know in the in
[5:04:45] the ring and he'd be covered in Dustin
[5:04:47] and he'd go around the next barrel and
[5:04:49] go around the next barrel and he's just
[5:04:51] he was just doing that with Danny and he
[5:04:53] had sweat on his face and was just
[5:04:54] turning muddy and then he would do
[5:04:56] Showmanship and he'd walk the horse down
[5:04:58] with Danny on it and walk back and Danny
[5:05:01] would be so happy so proud being on the
[5:05:03] horse and and
[5:05:06] all afternoon his father ran that horse
[5:05:10] for Danny
[5:05:13] and then at the end of the day when they
[5:05:15] were giving out trophies Danny would
[5:05:16] have his trophy like this and he'd sit
[5:05:18] on the fence and he'd be so happy first
[5:05:21] place and I'd look over and here's Mr
[5:05:23] calamans and he'd be over here in the
[5:05:25] back of the truck and he'd take off all
[5:05:27] the gear wipe down the horse give him a
[5:05:29] little bit of water give him a little
[5:05:30] bit of hay wipe down the horse get him
[5:05:33] in the trailer
[5:05:35] lock it all up he's sitting the cab of
[5:05:39] the truck and he just wait until Danny
[5:05:40] was done
[5:05:45] and he uh
[5:05:49] he did that without ever coming around
[5:05:51] and saying I'm Danny's father
[5:05:54] I'm I'm Danny's father and I I honestly
[5:05:57] I'm ashamed but I don't even know his
[5:06:00] name
[5:06:01] and uh he
[5:06:04] he did that year after year after year
[5:06:07] and and made sure that Danny had the
[5:06:09] best experience
[5:06:12] and everything that he needed in order
[5:06:15] to participate in everything he needed
[5:06:17] in order to be included in the group
[5:06:20] he did all of that
[5:06:23] and we never knew his name
[5:06:26] and I thought to myself many times and
[5:06:28] I've told the story many times forgive
[5:06:30] me
[5:06:31] but I thought to myself
[5:06:34] if I could be
[5:06:36] a father like that
[5:06:38] who sacrificed
[5:06:40] so unselfishly
[5:06:43] and so caringly for his son
[5:06:46] that he never got any Fanfare and he
[5:06:49] never got any promotion he never got any
[5:06:51] acknowledgment at all but he just did it
[5:06:54] because he loved his son so much
[5:06:56] and just wanted his son to have that
[5:06:59] good experience of being in the fair
[5:07:01] winning the trophy and stuff like that
[5:07:03] and I thought wow Lord help me be that
[5:07:07] kind of a father that you know what
[5:07:11] it's not necessary that people know me
[5:07:14] but Lord let my boys Excel let them
[5:07:18] let them receive the benefits of the
[5:07:21] sacrifice and and let them grow and
[5:07:24] become what you want them to become and
[5:07:26] I often often thought about that story
[5:07:28] and often thought about because I can
[5:07:30] still see him in my mind's eye and I
[5:07:31] thought
[5:07:32] foreign
[5:07:33] if ever there was a person who who just
[5:07:36] exhibited the real attributes of a
[5:07:38] loving father
[5:07:40] who got nothing in return seemingly got
[5:07:42] nothing in return
[5:07:44] it would have been Mr kalamanas
[5:07:47] and he just did it so faithfully and so
[5:07:49] consistently and did it only because he
[5:07:51] loved his boy
[5:07:54] if I could be that kind of a father
[5:07:57] I think that'd be a good thing
[5:07:59] I think that'd be a good thing
[5:08:02] and you think about how sometimes it's
[5:08:05] it's an easy thing to just kind of go
[5:08:07] through the motions and do the normal
[5:08:10] things but
[5:08:11] when you think about how he must have
[5:08:14] viewed his son and how he loved him so
[5:08:16] much that he was willing to sacrifice
[5:08:17] and embarrass himself in front of
[5:08:19] everybody by running around the field
[5:08:20] like that and so sweaty and Dusty and
[5:08:23] everything else and it didn't stop him
[5:08:24] at all he just he just did he did it for
[5:08:26] Danny
[5:08:27] and I think about how the Lord loved us
[5:08:30] and did what he did for us and so
[5:08:31] embarrassingly and so unhesitatingly did
[5:08:34] it not for his own welfare but he did it
[5:08:37] because he loved you and I'm thinking
[5:08:38] wow if that's what we're talking about
[5:08:41] when we talk about the attribute of a
[5:08:42] father Lord Give Me That kind of a heart
[5:08:46] for my for my kids and for my grandkids
[5:08:49] and help me do whatever I need to do
[5:08:53] whether nobody understands and whether
[5:08:55] nobody agrees but let me do
[5:08:59] let me say I'm sorry let me make things
[5:09:01] right let me work the extra hour let me
[5:09:04] go the extra mile let me do what's
[5:09:06] necessary
[5:09:09] to make sure
[5:09:11] that I'm fulfilling the role he has
[5:09:13] described
[5:09:17] I will assure you that none of this what
[5:09:19] we've talked about today happens
[5:09:20] automatically you don't just because
[5:09:22] you're in the message doesn't mean your
[5:09:23] home is foolish shalom it doesn't matter
[5:09:25] that your your children are going to
[5:09:26] turn out right that listen you're you're
[5:09:28] foolish if you believe that that's going
[5:09:30] to happen automatically just because
[5:09:32] you're a believer in Malachi 4. it
[5:09:34] doesn't happen that way
[5:09:36] you you had to be willing to invest you
[5:09:40] have to be willing to sweat you had to
[5:09:42] be willing to do the unselfish thing you
[5:09:44] had to be willing to go the extra mile
[5:09:46] sometimes you got to go to the Cross
[5:09:48] first
[5:09:49] just because somebody needs to go to the
[5:09:51] cross
[5:09:52] sometimes you just gotta you just gotta
[5:09:54] bring the family to a place of prayer
[5:09:56] and forgiveness and and and uh you know
[5:10:00] humility sometimes you just got to bring
[5:10:02] your family to the to that place first
[5:10:04] because somebody needs to do it and you
[5:10:06] know what buddy you're the leader you're
[5:10:08] the father here and God's going to look
[5:10:11] to you first
[5:10:12] and it isn't right for a woman to take
[5:10:14] that place in the household even if the
[5:10:16] father doesn't sometimes a woman is
[5:10:18] forced into positions like that but I
[5:10:20] will tell you if God's going to deal
[5:10:21] with that family he wants to deal with
[5:10:23] the man and buddy we should be present
[5:10:25] we should be present enough to say Lord
[5:10:27] if you've got to do something in our
[5:10:28] family Lord use me use me as a vessel
[5:10:30] here
[5:10:32] and I think men got to be willing to
[5:10:34] step up to the plate and and not
[5:10:36] necessarily be some sort of a superhero
[5:10:39] like Hollywood portrays but I think you
[5:10:41] got to be a little bit like Mr kalamanus
[5:10:43] who's willing to say whatever it takes
[5:10:48] whatever it takes
[5:10:50] willing to do it
[5:10:52] let's pray
[5:10:59] Heavenly Father
[5:11:03] we are
[5:11:06] so thankful that your word contains so
[5:11:09] many wonderful truths
[5:11:12] that now we can enjoy with Revelation
[5:11:14] and understanding and you have
[5:11:17] made your will and your purpose so clear
[5:11:19] for us I I thank you for that Lord we
[5:11:21] enjoy things that other ages only
[5:11:23] thought about and probe death but now
[5:11:25] you've made your word so clear to us
[5:11:28] in the name of Jesus Christ I pray for
[5:11:31] these families that have
[5:11:33] been through this today and I I just
[5:11:36] asked that you would impart
[5:11:38] something in their hearts that they
[5:11:41] might embrace the role of Mom and Dad
[5:11:44] fatherhood and motherhood
[5:11:46] in a healthy way
[5:11:49] and influence their families and their
[5:11:53] grand families
[5:11:54] towards the kingdom
[5:11:57] there are a million ways to do it wrong
[5:12:01] but you have a way and we want to
[5:12:03] embrace that way
[5:12:06] and in the name of Jesus Christ I commit
[5:12:08] this people down to your hands I thank
[5:12:10] you for ministers that have such a
[5:12:12] desire that they would want their people
[5:12:13] to hear things like this Lord and I I
[5:12:17] just ask that you would help them to
[5:12:18] apply it with lots of Grace
[5:12:22] be willing to forgive and move on
[5:12:25] and Lord help us to have that
[5:12:28] willingness to say whatever it takes
[5:12:30] in whatever way we can make the Holy
[5:12:33] Spirit pleased to dwell in our home
[5:12:36] and Lord give us the strength to do that
[5:12:39] we love you
[5:12:41] and we thank you and ask your blessing
[5:12:44] now upon every family that's represented
[5:12:47] here
[5:12:49] may you bless them and enrich them
[5:12:53] in the name of Jesus Christ we pray
[5:13:02] foreign
