[29:20] about a mansion." Amen. And you know,
[29:22] all that's really wonderful, but if he's
[29:24] not there, it wouldn't be worth it.
[29:26] &gt;&gt; It wouldn't be worth it. Amen. I I don't
[29:29] want a crown. I just want to see the
[29:30] Lord Jesus.
[29:31] &gt;&gt; Because he's the one that made it all
[29:33] possible.
[29:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Let's just sing this
[29:36] song as brother Samuel comes. How many's

[30:06] I really
[30:09] want to see.
[30:16] [music]
[30:16] For the more I see
[30:20] of this soul world,
[30:23] the less it means [music]
[30:27] to me.

[31:59] Oh, [music] the more [singing] I see
[32:02] of this whole world,
[32:05] the less it means to [music and singing]
[32:09] me.
[32:10] And it's Jesus
[32:15] &gt;&gt; I really want.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, one more time. One more time. Let it
[32:21] just be that prayer.

[32:36] &gt;&gt; It's Jesus
[32:38] that I [singing] really want [music]
[32:43] to see.
[32:46] [music]
[32:47] Oh, [singing]
[32:48] the more I see
[32:52] this, [music and singing]
[32:54] &gt;&gt; oh, the less it means to me.
[32:59] And it's Jesus
[33:03] that I really want [music]
[33:07] to see. [singing]
[33:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:14] Amen. Let's just go to him in a word of
[33:16] prayer.
[33:17] Lord God, how thankful we are tonight,
[33:20] Lord.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; That that truly, Lord, would be the
[33:24] desire of our hearts. We long, Lord, for

[35:24] we thank you, Father, in the precious
[35:26] name of Jesus Christ.
[35:29] Amen.
[35:31] Amen. Amen. God bless you tonight. Amen.
[35:34] It's so good to be gathered together and
[35:37] u just so appreciate um your prayers and
[35:41] uh Lord willing here maybe on Sunday
[35:43] I'll try to [clears throat] share just a
[35:46] few photos and things with you from the
[35:50] meetings there in in in Belgium in
[35:52] Newport. And I certainly um you were
[35:56] certainly a part of it and uh you may
[35:58] not have been there physically but your
[36:00] prayers and um I tell you I could
[36:02] certainly I sense the prayers and and
[36:05] just to be able to
[36:08] I don't know just to be able to describe
[36:11] all that that the Lord did within those
[36:14] meetings. Um it was just just really
[36:18] well it's always miraculous when he
[36:20] comes
[36:21] &gt;&gt; and um you know where hearts were
[36:23] delivered, hearts were filled and and
[36:27] hearts were settled. And so we so so
[36:30] thank God for his mercy and just a
[36:32] wonderful wonderful group of people. And
[36:34] of course, brother David Iverson, we
[36:36] were blessed to have him here on that
[36:38] one Thursday when he spoke about
[36:40] belittling spirits. And some of you
[36:42] remember that and that was just a
[36:44] powerful service. And so we just so
[36:47] appreciate brother David and the saints
[36:49] there. And uh but uh it's good to be
[36:52] back home. And uh I think I'm I think
[36:54] I'm finally starting to get my feet
[36:55] under me. And uh it's just one of those
[36:58] things you feel real good and you and
[37:00] then all of a sudden it seems like the
[37:01] battery wants to wear out and run down
[37:03] real quick. But uh nonetheless, it's
[37:05] it's good to be back home. And uh so
[37:08] it's good to see each and every one of
[37:09] you. Amen. Let's read here just one one
[37:12] verse of scripture, then we'll let you
[37:13] be seated. For thus saith the Lord God,
[37:17] the Holy One of Israel, in returning and
[37:21] rest shall you be saved. in quietness
[37:26] and in confidence shall be your
[37:28] strength.
[37:31] Now, God had laid this out to Israel be
[37:34] the whole background of it, which is not
[37:36] what I'm going to really focus on
[37:37] tonight, but Israel was under
[37:41] [clears throat] they were under siege or
[37:42] and Judah was under siege and God was
[37:46] admonishing them not to trust in the arm
[37:49] of flesh or the arm of man. And you'll
[37:52] find that repeated many times in the
[37:54] scripture because there's always a part
[37:56] about within us that we can somewhat
[37:59] incline to that of the flesh. And that's
[38:02] something we always got to push away.
[38:04] It's just and the flesh isn't the just
[38:05] these 16 elements. It's your spirit,
[38:08] your human spirit as well. Many times
[38:10] we'll have to push those things away.
[38:12] reasoning and you know you you have to
[38:14] push those things aside whether it's a
[38:16] doctor's support or or you're praying
[38:18] for a loved one and you've got to you've
[38:19] got to go beyond what you can see what
[38:22] you hear and even the reasoning that's
[38:24] there and you have to just push that
[38:26] away and say look I'm not going to rest
[38:27] on that it's not even going to be my
[38:29] strength that's going to get a hold of
[38:31] them it's not going to be my strength
[38:33] that's going to change the doctor's
[38:34] report but it's going to be the Lord
[38:38] &gt;&gt; Amen is faithful and so within this I
[38:41] love that scripture In quietness and in
[38:44] confidence shall be your strength. Amen.
[38:46] May God bless you as you're being
[38:47] seated.
[38:49] I want to read one more scripture here
[38:51] before I give you my title tonight.
[38:55] John writing and says, "Now, little
[38:58] children, abide in him that when he
[39:02] shall appear, we may have confidence and
[39:06] not be ashamed before him at his
[39:10] coming." If you know that he is
[39:12] righteous, you know that everyone that
[39:15] doeth righteousness is born of him. Now
[39:19] in the Old Testament, a man was deemed
[39:22] righteous by doing or following as what
[39:26] he did. But this scripture, as John
[39:28] would write of this multiple times, it's
[39:31] dealing of with the inward work of the
[39:33] grace of God in the heart of an
[39:35] individual to whereby it's righteousness
[39:38] from within. So it's not me doing
[39:40] something to obtain righteousness or
[39:42] merit righteousness, but it is coming
[39:44] back to the work of the grace of God in
[39:47] our life and then from out of our life
[39:49] comes forth a righteous work because
[39:51] there's a real there's a real fountain,
[39:53] a real source on the inside. And I want
[39:56] to draw [clears throat] from this here
[39:59] tonight in these two scriptures and
[40:01] speak on a godly confidence and um begin
[40:05] to look at this here and how God will
[40:07] just take us through this in this
[40:09] moment. Brother Bram says it like this.
[40:10] He says, "Men and women who's made in
[40:12] the image of God stand and say that
[40:16] God's word is not right. They doubt this
[40:18] and they doubt whether it's so or not.
[40:21] And there's a fountain to take care of
[40:23] that." So there's a fountain to take
[40:25] care of instability. There's a fountain
[40:28] to take care of up and down. There's a
[40:30] fountain to take care of, you know, did
[40:33] God mean it or does this or there's a
[40:36] fountain that'll take care of all
[40:38] unbelief
[40:40] and bring us to a place to just simply
[40:43] trust God's word because he said it.
[40:47] Because once we've been brought in
[40:49] contact with God by a relationship and a
[40:52] love affair because that's the whole
[40:54] theme of the gospel is a relationship.
[40:57] That was God's desire to uh come back
[41:00] into that place within man that he had
[41:04] in the garden of Eden. Now evidently and
[41:07] it's very true that through and by the
[41:09] shedding of the blood and then the
[41:10] sending of the Holy Spirit, the spirit
[41:12] of God coming into the heart of man is
[41:14] able to take you and I to a place that
[41:16] was much deeper than what Adam and Eve
[41:19] were. Because where Adam and Eve were
[41:20] at, they could fall from it. But where
[41:23] God has taken us in Christ is sublime
[41:27] security.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; And that's that is God's work because
[41:31] God never saves you knowing that he's
[41:32] going to lose you tomorrow.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So this is this is God's
[41:36] work in our lives to bring us to that
[41:38] place to where that he would dwell in
[41:41] the very midst of our life and our life
[41:43] actually uh is no longer about us but
[41:46] he's the very theme of our life. He
[41:49] becomes the focal point and the reason
[41:51] for every decision that we're making and
[41:53] we're bringing all things uh in focus
[41:56] within this. So uh Luke, brother Ram
[41:58] goes on to say in this same quote he
[42:00] said I was speaking on a private
[42:02] interviews today and I met a couple a
[42:04] man and his son and I said you can never
[42:07] never go forward until you're perfectly
[42:10] satisfied and know without a shadow of a
[42:13] doubt you're walking in God's will. And
[42:16] then when you know that you're in God's
[42:19] will and walking in his way, nothing can
[42:22] stop you
[42:23] &gt;&gt; because you know where you're standing.
[42:26] Amen.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; You know the way you're going. You you
[42:30] know what what what you got in your
[42:32] mind. You know what the will of God is.
[42:34] And then you can do it. And so we
[42:38] understand that with God's will, it's
[42:40] many things that continue to unfold as
[42:43] we walk along the journey. Uh even
[42:46] brother Brandham being the prophet of
[42:47] God, I like how brother George Smith
[42:49] would put it. He said many people he
[42:52] said think he said as though that
[42:53] brother Brandham just could look ahead
[42:55] and just see everything. He said, "But
[42:56] no, he had a walk just like you and I."
[42:59] That God doesn't show us five miles
[43:01] ahead.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Now, God will show a prophet what he
[43:05] needs to see, but remember, just like
[43:07] Jacob, just like Elijah, just like
[43:09] Elijah, on and on we could go. God only
[43:12] shows a prophet what he wants them to
[43:13] know.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; Is that right? And this is why that
[43:16] brother Brandham would say it. Kinsman
[43:18] Redeemer and other places where
[43:20] individuals even testimony there in
[43:22] Shreport. Oh, brother Brandham, I guess
[43:23] you really don't have to pray as much
[43:25] because God just shows you every little
[43:27] thing to do. And he says, nope, that's
[43:29] not true at all. He says, as a matter of
[43:31] fact, he said, I have to wrestle it out
[43:32] even much more than what you do. Because
[43:35] God has a way of so placing it to where
[43:38] that dependency will be so great upon
[43:41] him. And the closer that we get to him,
[43:44] the more or I would say the less reliant
[43:47] that we become on ourselves. And
[43:49] sometimes we don't realize just even
[43:52] much or how much we are still reliant
[43:55] upon our own feelings, upon our own
[43:57] thoughts. But you know, God's not
[43:59] worried about that. He knows all that's
[44:01] going all it needs is a little bit of
[44:02] maturity coming into his presence. And
[44:05] God wants us to agree with the word. He
[44:08] doesn't want to us to force the word
[44:10] upon us and to where that we're walking
[44:12] and we don't understand. But to
[44:13] understand is not that we not that we
[44:16] have everything figured out, but we know
[44:18] that God is present and we're able to
[44:20] see that this is God's plan. I don't
[44:22] know how it's all going to work out, but
[44:24] I know that God's word cannot fail
[44:27] because God cannot fail and he is the
[44:29] word. So when we're walking where we
[44:32] have a place where we can walk with
[44:34] safety and real strength, I I love this
[44:36] scripture here in Isaiah 32:17. The
[44:39] Bible says, "The work of righteousness
[44:42] shall be peace." So the real working of
[44:46] righteousness and and this is even
[44:48] prophetically speaking of Israel and
[44:50] their return, but even how God would
[44:52] minister to them then and to us, the
[44:54] work of righteousness shall be peace.
[44:56] That's what the work of the Holy Spirit
[44:59] comes to minister into our life.
[45:01] Remember the Bible says that as in
[45:03] Isaiah, Paul picks it up in Romans that
[45:06] uh that how beautiful are the feet of
[45:08] them that that bring glad tidings of
[45:10] peace. In the book of Isaiah, it would
[45:13] write our God reignth. And it would
[45:15] speak of the peace that has been brought
[45:18] between God and man. Because when when
[45:20] when the whole the whole cusp of the
[45:22] gospel is that our faith would rise to
[45:25] accept what he's already done. It's a
[45:28] finished work. It doesn't have to go to
[45:30] Calvary. There's not one more thing that
[45:32] he has to do. As a matter of fact, even
[45:34] when God has sent this message in this
[45:36] hour, it was to open or to reveal the
[45:40] way that man had wanted to close off and
[45:43] be closed off to for uh for the believer
[45:46] and God to come back together. But God
[45:49] himself rent the veils of tradition in
[45:52] this hour. So, we're not looking at God
[45:55] through the veils of tradition. We're
[45:57] not looking at God through the veils of
[45:59] a man's ideas. God has rent those veils
[46:02] to where that you as a believer now have
[46:05] come back to as it was on the day of
[46:08] Pentecost and as it was in the day when
[46:11] they walked with God in the cool of the
[46:13] evening. The prophet brings that down in
[46:16] the message, the oneness to where God
[46:18] has brought us back into that place to
[46:20] be able to hear lip lip to ear from God
[46:25] to where it is God. Now God can God will
[46:27] use the agency of a man but it's not a
[46:29] man that's revealing it to you. Remember
[46:31] Jesus said flesh and blood have not
[46:33] revealed it unto you but my father which
[46:35] is in heaven. So this is why it's
[46:37] imperative and necessary for the Holy
[46:39] Spirit to be among us. The spirit of
[46:41] truth to come and reveal his word.
[46:44] Because if we've ever got anything
[46:46] that's come from God, it's truly just
[46:48] come that way. It's because God in his
[46:51] mercy has alerted us and spoke to our
[46:54] hearts. And if it hadn't been for him,
[46:56] it would go right over our heads. So it
[46:58] all comes down to God's grace. So then
[47:00] when you see the whole work of
[47:02] righteousness is peace. The gospel is
[47:05] not meant to bring agitation or
[47:08] condemnation. The gospel does when it's
[47:10] preached. It brings conviction. But it
[47:12] brings conviction because the present a
[47:15] presence of God comes down to convict
[47:17] that heart for to expose the enemy and
[47:20] to and that an individual can realize I
[47:23] don't have to remain in this condition
[47:25] anymore. And the presence of God drawing
[47:28] near to you and I is what lets you and I
[47:31] know who we are. It's like the the young
[47:34] man who was with amnesia in his mind.
[47:37] The prophet tells it at the end of
[47:39] spiritual amnesia. They let him off the
[47:41] bus and they they noticed the guard
[47:43] started noticing this boy. He started
[47:45] looking around and so he thought he'd
[47:47] watch him and finally that boy he
[47:49] started walking over the hill and the
[47:51] guard followed him from a distance. He
[47:52] kept on walking crest that hill and over
[47:55] that hill there was a little cabin and
[47:57] as he walked down that hill
[48:00] &gt;&gt; right out there on the porch there was a
[48:02] father
[48:03] &gt;&gt; and the father stood up and he ran to
[48:05] him and he said, "THEY TOLD ME YOU WERE
[48:07] DEAD." He said, "But I knew you would
[48:09] come home, my son."
[48:11] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS IT? YOU JUST HAD TO GET HIM
[48:13] BACK IN HIS FAMILIAR SURROUNDINGS.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT THE PRESENCE OF GOD
[48:20] &gt;&gt; HAS COME BY HIS WORD. IT'S FAMILIAR
[48:23] SURROUNDINGS.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; WE WERE IN HIS MIND. We were with him
[48:29] the whole time. WE WERE TRANSFERRED DOWN
[48:31] INTO THE LOINS OF THE LORD JESUS. WE
[48:34] WERE ALWAYS A PART OF THE WORD. AND YOU
[48:36] GET A DUCK AROUND WATER, IT'LL RECOGNIZE
[48:39] WHAT IT IS. YOU GET AN EAGLE UNDER THE
[48:42] UNDER THE UH THE PRESENCE OF MAMA EAGLE,
[48:44] it'll recognize
[48:46] &gt;&gt; who it is.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT GOD DOES TO BRING AN
[48:51] awareness and bring a confidence of
[48:54] faith in our lives to rise within his
[48:57] presence. It brings about a peace within
[49:00] our life. And the effect, I love that.
[49:03] The effect of righteousness,
[49:07] quietness, and assurance forever.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; It'll be undisturbed
[49:13] security.
[49:14] That's the effect of this righteousness.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean that the enemy won't
[49:20] come and try to trouble your mind,
[49:24] &gt;&gt; but you've got a peace that passes
[49:27] &gt;&gt; all understanding. Amen.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; When when you can't put two things
[49:33] together, but there's a piece that's
[49:35] greater than what you can put together.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S A PIECE THAT HOLDS YOU.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; IT HOLDS you in AN UNDISTURBED SECURITY.
[49:44] IN OTHER WORDS, IT CAN NEVER, NO MATTER
[49:47] WHAT SITUATION, NO MATTER WHAT DOUBT, NO
[49:50] MATTER WHAT THE ENEMY WOULD WANT TO TRY
[49:52] to bring, THERE IS NOTHING can separate
[49:55] you
[49:56] &gt;&gt; from God.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. God.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Now, watch how Paul would write this in
[50:04] Romans 5. Therefore, being justified by
[50:07] faith, we have peace with God through
[50:10] our Lord Jesus Christ. By whom also we
[50:15] have access by faith into this grace
[50:20] wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of
[50:24] the glory of God. There's an expectation
[50:26] that faith has given us and not only so
[50:30] but we glory in tribulations also. That
[50:34] last part of that scripture there before
[50:35] I go on that becomes
[50:40] part of growth in our life.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; It didn't say that we'll enjoy them.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; It didn't say that we'll be getting on
[50:49] Facebook and saying, "GLORY TO GOD, I'VE
[50:51] GOT THE BIGGEST TRIAL OF MY LIFE."
[50:53] &gt;&gt; NO. Gloring in our TRIBULATIONS IS NOT
[50:56] PUTTING on a show. IT MEANS A CONSTANT
[51:00] CONSTANT CONSISTENT WALK WITH GOD.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME? IT'S NOT BUBBLE
[51:07] DANCING. IT'S NOT GOING AROUND AND I'm
[51:09] going to dance ALL AROUND BECAUSE I'M
[51:11] GOING THROUGH A TRIAL. THAT'S NOT WHAT
[51:13] GLORING IS. GLORING MEANS is that there
[51:16] IS A CONSISTENT AND CONSTANT WALK THAT
[51:18] THE TRIAL THAT THE TRIBULATION IT CANNOT
[51:22] BREAK FROM the confidence THAT GOD HAS
[51:24] PUT IN YOUR LIFE BUT THERE IS A
[51:27] CONSISTENCY that moves on in your life
[51:29] and you realize OVER TIME YOU COME TO
[51:32] THAT UNDERSTANDING BECAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS
[51:34] EVALUATING your life Lord IS THERE
[51:36] SOMETHING WRONG IS THERE ANYTHING OUT OF
[51:39] TUNE IS THERE ANYTHING OUT OF LINE and
[51:41] then WHEN YOU'VE GONE THROUGH THAT
[51:43] REMEMBER THE PROPHET TAKES us through
[51:44] that in the messages be certain of God.
[51:47] And it's a real key OF INSTRUCTION
[51:50] BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TO BE walking with
[51:52] presuming. But we are to take THE WORD
[51:55] IN BECAUSE IT MATTERS TO US AS
[51:57] BELIEVERS. WE'RE NOT JUST WALKING AROUND
[52:00] AND WELL, YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING'S ALL
[52:01] RIGHT. BUT IT MATTERS TO YOU AND I.
[52:04] LORD, I WANT TO KNOW IS THERE SOMETHING
[52:06] THAT I have done to displease you?
[52:11] &gt;&gt; Is that how you feel? Amen.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; And believe IT OR NOT, WE'VE done things
[52:16] that displeased him.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; SURE, THE PROPHET did things that
[52:20] displeased him. Matter of fact, the
[52:22] angel of the Lord didn't visit him for 6
[52:23] months.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; I can go into all of that, BUT YOU SEE,
[52:29] GOD [screaming] SHOWED US WITHIN things
[52:32] through even the training and the
[52:34] maturing. And you know what, brother
[52:36] Brandham could have been a stuffed shirt
[52:37] and kept it all up. But let me just tell
[52:39] you, brother Brandham, he want I'm I'm
[52:41] not glorifying A MAN, BUT GOD DID THIS
[52:43] FOR YOU AND I SO THAT YOU AND I SEEN A
[52:46] SON OF GOD COME TO MATURITY. AND TO KNOW
[52:49] THAT WE HAVE WITHIN US THE SAME QUALITY
[52:52] OF THE HOLY SPIRIT AND THE SEED THAT IS
[52:55] DWELLING THERE, WHEN THAT GETS TOGETHER,
[52:57] IT WILL PRODUCE THE SAME CHARACTER OF
[53:00] CHRIST. I DON'T NEED TO BE A PROPHET.
[53:02] GOD SENT A PROPHET TO THE AGE. HE DON'T
[53:06] NEED ANOTHER MAJOR PROPHET. THE WORD HAS
[53:09] ALREADY BEEN DELIVERED. GOD HAS ALREADY
[53:11] COME AND MANIFESTED HIMSELF. NOW IT'S
[53:14] TIME FOR THAT WORD TO LIVE IN FLESH.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; THAT WORD TO ACCOMPLISH AND ACHIEVE A
[53:21] BRIDE THAT IS CROWNED AND CAPPED WITH
[53:24] DIVINE LOVE.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD. HALLELUJAH.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; And it's working.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; It's working.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; So, not only so we grow and we glory. So
[53:36] we're not just looking for in the coming
[53:38] of the Lord, but we are are gloring and
[53:42] trusting in the constant and consistent
[53:44] walk knowing knowing what that
[53:48] tribulation
[53:50] workketh
[53:51] &gt;&gt; patience. Amen.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; Remember James would write faith
[53:56] workketh patience.
[53:58] There's no other way to have patience
[54:02] &gt;&gt; than without tribulation.
[54:06] Patience is endurance. It's
[54:08] longsuffering.
[54:10] There's no way for patience a
[54:12] completeness. And God's desire for you
[54:14] and I is to have a patience. This is why
[54:17] James would even admonish us, let
[54:19] patience have her perfect work.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; That you be lacking nothing. So
[54:24] tribulation workketh patience. Now I
[54:27] remember separating our flesh from
[54:30] what's on the inside. Our flesh, your
[54:33] flesh, my flesh does not like
[54:35] tribulation.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; So true.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; And I don't care what size it comes in.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; I don't care if it's a small milk carton
[54:42] or a gallon.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; THERE YOU GO.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; YOUR FLESH AND MY FLESH does not like
[54:47] tribulation.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Our flesh does not like inconvenience.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; I mean, and it and it ONLY IT ONLY
[54:55] COMPOUNDS IN THE HOUR WE'RE LIVING IN.
[54:57] We're living in a time of great
[55:00] pressure.
[55:02] We're living in a time there's pressure
[55:04] from the workplace, pressure from
[55:06] school, PRESSURE ALL AROUND. Pressure is
[55:09] mounting.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; But I'm glad there is A PLACE that we
[55:15] can go to.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; And let off the pressure.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that?
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT AT YOUR WIFE
[55:24] or at YOUR HUSBAND. I'M TALKING ABOUT IN
[55:26] HIM.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU SEE, THAT'S PART OF
[55:28] RECOGNIZING even in our own lives, OUR
[55:31] WALK WITH GOD is recognizing even the
[55:34] FRAILTY OF THE HUMANITY AND AND GETTING
[55:37] AWAY even in the times on your walk or
[55:39] your ride home from from work and things
[55:41] AND AND JUST POURING YOUR HEART OUT TO
[55:43] GOD AND JUST SAY, "GOD, I'M HERE TO LET
[55:46] OFF THE PRESSURE."
[55:47] &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; I'M HERE TO LET OFF THE PRESSURE, LORD,
[55:51] BECAUSE IT'S MOUNTED. IT'S BUILT UP,
[55:53] LORD. AND AND I'M FEELING THE PRESSURES.
[55:55] And we know what you know what I'm
[55:57] talking about where it just gets so hard
[56:00] that sometimes with pressure YOU JUST
[56:02] YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR MIND'S being squeezed
[56:03] in a mail press.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD'S FAITHFUL
[56:09] &gt;&gt; KNOWING that tribulation workketh
[56:11] patience and patience experience
[56:15] and experience hope.
[56:19] So hope expectation is what comes out at
[56:21] the end of it and what what comes even
[56:24] as a product. Not only patience but all
[56:26] of these things become a product and
[56:28] then it's a hope that maketh not
[56:30] ashamed. It becomes an expectation where
[56:32] you can go to somebody else that's going
[56:34] through the deepest of trial and say
[56:37] brother or sister I'm praying for you.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Just hold on. God's working.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; You may not feel like it but God's
[56:46] working.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; Yes he is. I may not been through the
[56:48] exact same thing, but I just want you to
[56:50] know God is faithful.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; I believe you believe THAT, BUT I WANT
[56:53] YOU TO KNOW GOD [screaming]
[56:55] IS WORKING ALL THINGS OUT.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; There's an expectation. Do I know how? I
[57:00] don't know how. IF WE KNEW HOW, IT
[57:02] WOULDN'T BE FAITH.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; But there's a real expectation that we
[57:06] CAN HAVE. LIKE JOB could say, I KNOW
[57:08] WHEN I COME OUT OF THIS, I'M GOING TO
[57:10] COME forth as pure as gold.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; I'VE ENTERED THE TRIAL AS GOLD. I'm
[57:16] going to come out AS GOLD. THE TRIAL IS
[57:18] NOT GOING TO DEVALUE ME. THE TRIAL IS
[57:20] NOT GOING TO TAKE AWAY FROM MY
[57:22] EXPERIENCE. IF THERE'S ANYTHING AT ALL,
[57:24] IT'S GOING TO PUT STRENGTH IN MY LIFE.
[57:26] IT'S GOING TO BRING ME INTO A GREATER
[57:29] REALIZATION WITH GOD.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Hope maketh not ashamed
[57:37] &gt;&gt; because the love of God is shed abroad
[57:39] in our hearts. Why? because God's love
[57:41] is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy
[57:44] Ghost which is given unto us. So there
[57:47] is an incentive. You know, a lot of
[57:49] times they have incentives for things
[57:51] that you can do and you know, they'll
[57:53] have you there's all little tricks and
[57:55] things they'll have you do out in
[57:57] society and, you know, incentives to get
[57:59] people buying and, you know, come in and
[58:01] play our great game and and scratch off
[58:03] the card, spend 50 bucks and we'll give
[58:06] you a a $5 toy and, you know, it just
[58:08] all
[58:10] there's an incentive, but that the I'm
[58:12] talking about a real incentive tonight.
[58:14] Faith
[58:16] is love's incentive. It's the incentive
[58:19] to love. The prophet said, "The only way
[58:21] you can have faith is have love first
[58:23] out of desperation." Faith is love's
[58:26] incentive. It's an incentive to love. If
[58:29] you don't have love, you can't have
[58:31] faith. right
[58:32] &gt;&gt; now. Well, brother Ram, when we dealing
[58:33] with this here in desperation, because
[58:36] remember you uh we understand that even
[58:39] as we uh come through 1 Corinthians 13
[58:43] that many even of the nine spiritual
[58:46] gifts from the gift of faith to on and
[58:49] on it it would require faith. And this
[58:52] is why Paul would even write and say
[58:54] though I have faith to move mountains
[58:58] &gt;&gt; and I don't have the Holy Ghost don't
[59:00] have love then I'm nothing. Right?
[59:03] &gt;&gt; So it has got to be something that is
[59:05] there and a faith that when we're
[59:08] talking of this faith, we're talking
[59:10] about a faith that comes through and by
[59:13] a settled life and where the LOVE OF GOD
[59:16] BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD HAS been deposited
[59:19] in that life. We're so we're TALKING
[59:22] ABOUT A GODLY CONFIDENCE. Remember a
[59:25] consistent constant walk and that's what
[59:29] the Holy Spirit produces in our life.
[59:31] This is why brother Rab said, "How can
[59:33] you have faith in your wife if you don't
[59:35] love her?" That's felio. But what about
[59:38] goppo to God? If you don't love God, if
[59:41] you said you loved your wife and you
[59:42] never tell her about it, never sat down
[59:44] and make love to her and expressed it to
[59:46] her, kiss her, hug her, tell her she's
[59:48] the best cook in the country, all the
[59:50] things that you know, I mean, we know
[59:52] how to complain when it's not right.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; You think you could have got these
[59:57] noodles a little bit more tougher?
[1:00:00] We know how to complain
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; that we're natured in that way. And once
[1:00:04] again, pressure adds to that,
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; right? So, but but notice, you know, I
[1:00:10] think it ought to be something we focus
[1:00:11] on and say, "God, help me to be
[1:00:13] attentive. Help me to be attentive,
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; right? Help me to BE ATTENTIVE. DON'T
[1:00:19] DON'T LET THE THE tongue and my mouth be
[1:00:22] loose."
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; Friends, listen. We should be as guarded
[1:00:28] with our family as we are with one
[1:00:30] another.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING TO PRAY for
[1:00:35] even in this coming year
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; because we can become very common to one
[1:00:40] another.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; And we need God's help. But I believe
[1:00:44] there's great victories. Oh, it may not
[1:00:46] seem like a great victory, but I believe
[1:00:48] that's a great victory.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; I believe that's a great victory. OH, IT
[1:00:52] MAY NOT BE A public show, but after all,
[1:00:53] what God is doing in this hour, he's not
[1:00:55] going to rapture a public show. He's
[1:00:58] rapturing a secret work that will be
[1:01:01] revealed openly.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; IT'S BEING REVEALED OPENLY THROUGH
[1:01:06] CHARACTER BEING MOLDED BEHIND CLOSED
[1:01:08] DOORS
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; WHERE THE WORD'S BEING TAKEN IN AND
[1:01:12] THERE'S THE DYING TAKING PLACE ON THE
[1:01:14] INSIDE THAT THE WORD MAY COME TO THE
[1:01:16] FOREFRONT. WHY? BECAUSE WE ARE BEING
[1:01:19] brought to a Mount Carmel showdown.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; WHERE THE SECRET WORK WILL be revealed
[1:01:26] openly.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; He said if if you love her, you express
[1:01:33] it. And that's the way we do God. When
[1:01:34] we love him, we tell him about it.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; We sat down and we adore him and worship
[1:01:39] him. And see, love drives us to do that,
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:01:44] Not that we always feel like it,
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; but you know, you ever get around in
[1:01:50] times and I don't know. I mean, you
[1:01:52] know, you just get to just thinking
[1:01:54] about the Lord and just you just tell
[1:01:55] him, "Lord, I love you."
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; I just appreciate you. When you just you
[1:01:59] just think I mean, it just COMES ALONG
[1:02:01] YOUR PATH. LORD, I THANK YOU.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; I appreciate you, Lord. I love you.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE SOME SPECIAL
[1:02:07] TIME. YOU JUST EVEN AT THAT MOMENT,
[1:02:09] LORD, I WANT YOU TO KNOW I LOVE YOU.
[1:02:11] MAYBE THERE'S A THOUGHT. MAYBE AS HE
[1:02:13] BEGINS TO THINK ABOUT WHAT HE'S DONE AND
[1:02:15] WHAT HE'S DOING IN YOUR LIFE AND HOW
[1:02:17] HE'S MINISTERED TO YOU AND YOU SAY,
[1:02:18] "LORD," YOU JUST GET BESIDE YOURSELF,
[1:02:20] MAYBE THERE AT THE WORK AND SAY, "I love
[1:02:22] you."
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; I appreciate you, Lord.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; LOVE DRIVES US TO DO THAT. HE SAID,
[1:02:30] "NOW, what if there was something that
[1:02:32] had to be done for your wife? She got
[1:02:34] cancer, TB, and she's fixing to die. It
[1:02:36] would throw you into desperation." And
[1:02:40] he says, "Now we must have love before
[1:02:43] we can have faith."
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; And when we HAVE GENUINE LOVE, WHAT DOES
[1:02:47] IT DO? IT PUSHES our faith out on the
[1:02:51] battlefront for God.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Genuine godly love for God and for his
[1:02:57] word and for his people will push faith
[1:03:00] out there. Love just takes a hold of
[1:03:03] faith and says, "Come on, let's go." And
[1:03:06] it goes out BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT LOVE
[1:03:08] DOES. YES.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE WHEN YOUR CHILD HAS WOKE YOU
[1:03:13] UP in the middle of the night and you
[1:03:14] don't know how you're going to clean
[1:03:15] EVERYTHING UP.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'RE EVEN GOING TO
[1:03:17] MAKE IT THROUGH TO THE MORNING.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; THAT'S SO GOOD.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T TRY TO FIGURE IT OUT.
[1:03:21] [screaming] LOVE DRIVES YOU TO DO THAT.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW IT SEEMS LIKE
[1:03:26] THE PIECES ARE ARE EVERYWHERE AND AND
[1:03:28] CIRCUMSTANCE. YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S
[1:03:30] GOING TO COME OUT. BUT LOVE FOR THE
[1:03:33] INDIVIDUAL DRIVES YOU OUT THERE TO DO
[1:03:35] THAT. HOW MUCH GREATER WITH GOD I DON'T
[1:03:39] KNOW HOW YOU'RE GOING TO PUT THE RAM UP
[1:03:41] THERE, LORD, BUT I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO
[1:03:43] DO IT.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THERE WAS GOING
[1:03:46] TO BE A RAM UP THERE.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; SHAMGAR DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THERE WOULD BE
[1:03:51] THOUSANDS FALL. ALL HE SAW WITH
[1:03:54] INSPIRATION WAS THAT OX GOAT.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; HIS LOVE, HE BEGAN TO REMEMBER, I'm a
[1:04:02] covenant keeping. There's a covenant
[1:04:04] keeping God.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; There you go. Come on now.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; And God made a covenant with me. I don't
[1:04:09] have to stand back here and let them
[1:04:10] come in and take everything from us.
[1:04:13] [cheering]
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Good preacher.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, BILL RAM TELLS US WHEN HE GOES
[1:04:17] INTO THAT ABOUT SAMGAR, HE SAYS THAT
[1:04:19] THAT'S HOW THE DEVIL WANTS TO DO. HE
[1:04:21] SAID, YOU LET A GOOD MEETING HAPPEN. YOU
[1:04:23] LET GOD BEGIN TO DO SOMETHING FOR YOU
[1:04:25] AND THE DEVIL IS RIGHT THERE TO SHOW UP
[1:04:28] TO TRY TO TAKE IT FROM YOU.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; AND IT WON'T ALWAYS COME THE WAY YOU'RE
[1:04:32] THINKING ABOUT IT. IT MAY NOT BE THROUGH
[1:04:35] THE SAME WINDOW. IT MAY NOT BE THROUGH
[1:04:37] THE SAME TEMPTATION, BUT YOU CAN COUNT
[1:04:39] ON THE DEVIL BEING THERE. BUT LISTEN,
[1:04:42] DON'T MISS WHERE GOD IS POINTING OUT IN
[1:04:45] HIS WORD THE OX GOLD AND SAY, "DEVIL,
[1:04:48] I'm ready for you."
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD HAS ASSURED ME OF THE
[1:04:53] COVENANT.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; AND LOVE PUT HIM OUT THERE.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; WHAT PUT DAVID out there on the
[1:05:00] battlefront?
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; LOVE.
[1:05:03] LOVE PUT HIM OUT THERE. BEFORE DAVID
[1:05:05] EVEN HAD ANY ANY VISION, DAVID ALREADY
[1:05:09] SAID, "WHY'S EVERYBODY STANDING AROUND?
[1:05:12] THIS guy out there running his mouth.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Remember what his brother said." Oh,
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; so you think you're more spiritual.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; We know. You know the scripture. We know
[1:05:22] that they they're they're so-called
[1:05:24] discernment.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; But suspicion's not discernment.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; We know the naughtiness of thine heart.
[1:05:32] That's so good.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SEE WHAT THEY COULDN'T DO IS NO
[1:05:35] MATTER HOW THEY WANTED TO SHAME HIM AND
[1:05:37] AND EVERYTHING ELSE, THEY COULD NOT TAKE
[1:05:39] AWAY THE EXPERIENCE AND RELATIONSHIP
[1:05:41] THAT DAVID HAD WITH GOD AND DAVID SAID,
[1:05:44] "I'M NOT GOING TO STAND FOR THAT."
[1:05:46] RUNNING DOWN GOD'S PEOPLE. DAVID COULD
[1:05:48] EVEN LOOK AT THE MAN THAT WAS BELITTLING
[1:05:50] HIM AND SAID, "I'M NOT GOING TO STAND.
[1:05:52] YOU'RE YOU'RE AN ISRAELITE. YOU GOT A
[1:05:54] COVENANT [screaming] WITH GOD. AND I'M
[1:05:56] NOT GOING TO STAND FOR THE DEVIL RUNNING
[1:05:58] YOU DOWN, MY BROTHER." AMEN.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; OH, WHAT [screaming] LOVE OF GOD.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; LOVE OUT ON THE FOREFRONT. THAT'S why
[1:06:09] the prophet said when David WENT DOWN
[1:06:11] THAT HILL, HE SAID he went down there
[1:06:13] dancing cuz he already knew
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; the victory
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; belong to him.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; So love just takes a hold of faith,
[1:06:24] grabs it by the hand, and says, "Come
[1:06:25] on, let's go." THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; IT ISN'T FAITH DRAGGING LOVE.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; LOVE GRABS A HOLD OF FAITH AND SAYS,
[1:06:32] "Let's go."
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God in the highest.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram goes on. John 14:23, Jesus
[1:06:41] said, "If a man loves me, he'll keep my
[1:06:43] words." Now, you can't keep his words
[1:06:45] without having faith in what he said. If
[1:06:48] he loves God, then he keeps God's word.
[1:06:50] If he said, "I'm the Lord that health
[1:06:52] thee," HE BELIEVES THAT. LOVE MAKES HIM
[1:06:55] BELIEVE IT BECAUSE LOVE DOMINATES ALL.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL SAID IT AIN'T FOR YOU AND LOVE
[1:07:02] SAID SHUT YOUR MOUTH.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; COME ON FRIENDS. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID
[1:07:07] IT LIKE THIS. HE SAID IF SOMEBODY CAME
[1:07:09] TO ME AND THEY TOLD ME BRANDHAM IS NOT
[1:07:12] LIVING TRUE TO YOU, HE SAID I WOULD
[1:07:14] DOUBT [screaming] THEIR WORD BECAUSE
[1:07:16] I'VE GOT A LOVE AND A CONFIDENCE TO KNOW
[1:07:19] HER.
[1:07:20] AND HOW MUCH MORE ABOUT GOD WHEN THE
[1:07:23] DEVIL WANTS TO COME AROUND AND SAY, "GOD
[1:07:25] DON'T LOVE YOU. GOD DON'T CARE ABOUT
[1:07:28] YOU. GOD DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR SICKNESS.
[1:07:30] HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN? IT'S BEEN THIS
[1:07:32] LONG. HOW MANY PRAYER [screaming]
[1:07:34] REQUESTS HAVE YOU WROTE? HOW MANY TIMES
[1:07:36] HAVE YOU PRAYED? WHAT'S HE TRYING TO
[1:07:38] DO?" HE'S TRYING TO BREAK YOUR
[1:07:40] CONFIDENCE IN GOD. BUT LOVE STANDS THERE
[1:07:44] AND SAYS, "I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT. I DON'T
[1:07:46] [screaming] KNOW HOW." BUT LEFT SAID,
[1:07:48] "COME ON, FAITH. WE'RE GOING TO STAND
[1:07:51] RIGHT HERE ON THE FRONT LINE."
[1:07:53] [cheering]
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [applause]
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; THEY CAN CALL US A FOOL. THEY CAN CALL
[1:07:58] US CRAZY. THEY CAN SAY, "YOU AN OLD MAN
[1:08:00] AND YOU'RE MAKING A PAYMENT ON A DOCTOR
[1:08:02] BILL. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BABY, BUT
[1:08:04] I'M [screaming] GOING TO STAND HERE
[1:08:06] BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT GOD HAS SAID."
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; And love says, "Give me your hand,
[1:08:11] faith. Let's go."
[1:08:13] G.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Well, faith says faith don't say how
[1:08:16] it's going to be. Faith is just a master
[1:08:18] of every circumstance.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Faith just says it's going to be.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; How? I don't know, BUT IT'S GOING TO BE.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; GOD [screaming] WILL MAKE A WAY.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; HE'S OPENED SEAS BEFORE. HE'S OPENED
[1:08:30] RIVERS BEFORE. HE'S KEPT MY BRETHREN IN
[1:08:33] A FIERY FURNACE. HE KEPT DANIEL IN THE
[1:08:35] LION'S DEN. HE'S THE SAME [screaming]
[1:08:37] GOD. AND HE MAKES no difference cuz he's
[1:08:40] not a respected person. That's so good.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; They that trust in the Lord shall be as
[1:08:49] mount Zion.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Which cannot be removed.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; But abideth forever. As the mountains
[1:08:57] are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord
[1:09:00] is round about his people from
[1:09:02] henceforth, even forever.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; For the rod of the wicked shall not rest
[1:09:09] upon the lot of the righteous. I want
[1:09:11] you to catch this verse. I I can't
[1:09:12] really deal with this right now, but I
[1:09:14] want you to notice the rod of the wicked
[1:09:16] shall not rest upon the lot of the
[1:09:18] righteous, lest the righteous put forth
[1:09:21] their hands unto iniquity.
[1:09:24] And if they put forth their hands unto
[1:09:25] iniquity, then the rod is coming. But
[1:09:28] when the rod comes, it's only to bring
[1:09:30] the righteous back in line
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; because the wicked won't come back in
[1:09:33] line.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Because the wicked is resting in
[1:09:38] reasoning. The wicked is resting in
[1:09:40] their own understanding. BUT THE
[1:09:41] RIGHTEOUS WILL HEAR THE WORD AND THEY'LL
[1:09:43] RESPOND TO THAT WORD. GET BACK IN LINE.
[1:09:46] GET BACK IN STEP. GET YOUR EYES BACK ON
[1:09:48] THE WORD. THE RIGHTEOUS WILL respond
[1:09:50] right back to the word.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; But they that trust in the Lord. You
[1:09:54] can't have trust in the Lord and it be
[1:09:56] partial.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; It's got to be complete.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; It can't be part trust here and part
[1:10:02] trust in mama, part trust in, you know,
[1:10:04] in your job. It's got to be trust in the
[1:10:06] Lord. Because you see, when it's not,
[1:10:09] you become a divided person,
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; and you become interested in trying to
[1:10:13] accommodate yourself to all of those
[1:10:16] other people that you're trusting in.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN YOU TRUST in the Lord, YOU
[1:10:21] ACCOMMODATE YOURSELF TO THE LORD. AND
[1:10:23] THE BIBLE SAYS it like this, he'll make
[1:10:25] your enemies to even be at peace with
[1:10:26] you.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; You see, THIS IS THIS IS THE PROMISE.
[1:10:32] THEY THAT TRUST IN the Lord shall be
[1:10:34] like Jerusalem that is founded on Mount
[1:10:36] Zion. AND YOU KNOW GOD, OUR LIFE, OUR
[1:10:39] EXPERIENCE WITH GOD is founded on divine
[1:10:42] revelation.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; And divine revelation is not something
[1:10:46] that's been schooled into you. It's not
[1:10:48] something that's been wrote on a board
[1:10:49] and you memorized and repeated and
[1:10:50] after. That's not revelation. But
[1:10:52] revelation holds within it. I'm not
[1:10:54] talking ABOUT KNOWLEDGE. I'M TALKING
[1:10:57] ABOUT REVELATION. REVELATION HAS A
[1:11:00] POWER, A CREATIVE POWER WITHIN IT. JUST
[1:11:04] LIKE WHEN THE LIGHT THAT SHINED, WHEN
[1:11:06] THE WORD WAS SPOKE IN THE BEGINNING, IT
[1:11:08] IT PUSHED BACK THE DARKNESS AND REVEALED
[1:11:11] WHAT WAS DOWN THERE, HOUSED IN THAT
[1:11:13] DIRT. IT BROUGHT FORTH THAT LIFE AND
[1:11:15] THAT SEED. AND THAT'S THE SAME THING
[1:11:17] REAL true revelation does. REVELATION
[1:11:21] PACKS WITHIN IT TRANSFORMING POWER. IT
[1:11:24] PACKS WITHIN IT GRACE AND MERCY AND
[1:11:26] TRUTH AND AND WISDOM. IT IS FULL OF ALL
[1:11:30] OF THE NUTRIENTS. THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET
[1:11:31] SAID, "OH, HOW WE NEED TO ASK GOD FOR A
[1:11:35] FRESH REVELATION AND THEN BY IT BECOME
[1:11:39] THE LIVING WORD OF GOD manifested
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; because we can't be the living word
[1:11:44] manifested without there being a
[1:11:45] revelation."
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Because who's the revelation? It's him.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; It's him. It's becoming one with him.
[1:11:52] Because you know it's just like you know
[1:11:54] when you you look with that it I love
[1:11:56] many times how Spurgeon Charles Spurgeon
[1:11:58] will say some powerful things you know
[1:12:00] and he would say it's good to understand
[1:12:02] much and to trust in the Lord with
[1:12:04] growing knowledge but dear soul if you
[1:12:06] do not know much yet if you're trusting
[1:12:08] in the Lord you shall be as mount Zion
[1:12:10] which cannot be removed
[1:12:12] sir.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory be to God. YOU SEE
[1:12:15] WE'RE NOT LIKE THE WIND. Believers
[1:12:17] aren't like the wind depending on you
[1:12:19] never know which way it's going
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; right. You don't you don't know which
[1:12:22] way it's going. You we we just had those
[1:12:24] strong wind days here uh last uh when
[1:12:27] was it the week ago or however the days
[1:12:29] all mixed up for me. But you remember
[1:12:31] those days and how you know you don't
[1:12:33] know which way it's coming. It coming
[1:12:34] from this way coming from that way. You
[1:12:36] don't know. But but you see God wants to
[1:12:38] bring a confidence. It's a steadiness.
[1:12:41] It's assurityity. It's a straight going
[1:12:43] forward.
[1:12:45] Now notice in Proverbs 3:21,
[1:12:50] "My son, let not them depart from thine
[1:12:52] eyes, but keep sound wisdom and
[1:12:56] discretion, and so shall they be life
[1:12:58] unto thy soul in the inner part, and
[1:13:01] grace to thy neck." They what what will
[1:13:04] bless you inwardly will affect your life
[1:13:07] outwardly.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:09] So to lay to take a hold of the of
[1:13:12] wisdom and discretion,
[1:13:14] then thou shalt walk in thy way safely.
[1:13:18] That's securely, and thy foot shall not
[1:13:21] stumble. WHEN THOU LIEST DOWN, thou
[1:13:24] shalt not be afraid. Yay, thou shalt lie
[1:13:27] down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.
[1:13:30] Be not afraid. You know, some of you
[1:13:32] need to take that that verse of
[1:13:33] scripture and put it on your alarm clock
[1:13:37] and say, "Lord, this is my promise."
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. IF THE DEVIL'S BEEN
[1:13:42] PLAGUING YOU WITH NIGHTMARES and dreams
[1:13:44] AND EVERYTHING ELSE, YOU NEED TO TAKE
[1:13:46] THIS SCRIPTURE AND APPLY IT. THE WORD
[1:13:48] WAS MEANT TO BE APPLIED.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; LORD, YOU SAID YOU'D MAKE MY SLEEP
[1:13:53] SWEET. YES.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; NOW, THAT MAY NOT BE A TESTIMONY THAT
[1:13:58] EVERYBODY ELSE IS GOING TO SEE, but the
[1:14:00] many and people know you well enough,
[1:14:01] they'll be thankful for you getting a
[1:14:03] lot of sleep. [laughter]
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the most crankiest people when
[1:14:08] we don't get sleep.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Right. Besides being angry, [laughter]
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; come on, friends.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; God is NOT GOING TO LAY DOWN AND SAY,
[1:14:17] "WELL, I'M GOING TO HAVE THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:14:19] HE'S GOING TO NO. GOD GAVE US COMMON
[1:14:21] SENSE.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; TO KNOW THEN SAY, "GOD, I NEED STRENGTH
[1:14:25] IN MY BODY."
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I thought right before I was
[1:14:31] getting ready to go out on on that that
[1:14:32] the second night was ministering there
[1:14:34] in Newport and I already already the
[1:14:36] burden in my heart. I knew there was
[1:14:38] going to be uh even after that service
[1:14:40] was going to be praying prayer line. I
[1:14:42] knew that in my heart. So I I I was back
[1:14:44] there and I started feeling weak and I
[1:14:46] thought, "My goodness, I've ate so much
[1:14:48] protein today and things and I just but
[1:14:50] I feel weak." Well, you know what I
[1:14:52] realized is I don't know how long that
[1:14:54] I'm going to be out there. So I looked
[1:14:56] through all the chocolate [laughter]
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; and I l found a granola bar. I passed
[1:15:04] all the chocolate aside
[1:15:07] and I ate a granola bar because you know
[1:15:09] why? I found myself getting weak.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. I know that ain't very
[1:15:13] spiritual, but it will help
[1:15:15] relationships.
[1:15:19] [applause]
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Don't say amen too loud because I don't
[1:15:22] want you to get elbowed.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of
[1:15:28] the desolation of the wicked when it
[1:15:30] cometh. For the LORD SHALL BE THY
[1:15:33] CONFIDENCE,
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; AND SHALL KEEP THY FOOT FROM BEING
[1:15:37] TAKEN.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:15:40] YOU MIGHT FALTER, BUT GOD IS YOUR
[1:15:43] CONFIDENCE THAT'LL keep your foot from
[1:15:44] being taken.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A LOT OF DECISIONS. THERE'S
[1:15:47] THINGS THAT'S BEFORE US. THERE'S THINGS
[1:15:49] THAT CAN EVEN LOOK GOOD, FEEL GOOD,
[1:15:51] SOUND RIGHT, BUT KEEP WISDOM. Keep
[1:15:53] discretion. Keep it close to you. Let it
[1:15:56] let it be down in the depths of your
[1:15:58] life so that it will affect and be the
[1:16:00] influence. And the Lord will be your
[1:16:01] confidence. Lord, I'm resting in you,
[1:16:04] Lord. Amen.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 33:5, "The Lord is exalted, for
[1:16:09] he dwelleth on high." I love that. He
[1:16:11] hath filled Zion with judgment and
[1:16:15] righteousness, and wisdom and knowledge
[1:16:18] shall be the stability of thy times, and
[1:16:20] strength of salvation. THE FEAR OF the
[1:16:23] Lord is his treasure.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; What a beautiful and wonderful treasure
[1:16:29] that we have as a believer. the fear of
[1:16:32] the Lord because
[1:16:35] that that is a very that the fear of the
[1:16:38] Lord is clean and the fear of the Lord
[1:16:40] is is a reverence to the things of God.
[1:16:42] It's not a slavish fear. It's not a oh
[1:16:45] if I don't do this God's out to get me.
[1:16:47] That's not the fear of the Lord.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; But the fear of the Lord is a reverence
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; like like the prophet when he preaches
[1:16:53] the message respects and he covers all
[1:16:56] of that and the value of respects and
[1:16:59] real godly fear. But notice will be
[1:17:01] filled with judgment and righteousness
[1:17:04] and wisdom and knowledge and under
[1:17:06] understanding shall be the stability of
[1:17:09] thy times and strength of salvation.
[1:17:12] THIS IS WHY BROTHER BRAM SAYS REMEMBER
[1:17:14] remember um Elisha and Gahesa and Gahesa
[1:17:18] went out there and he was trembling
[1:17:20] because all he saw was one part of the
[1:17:22] battle.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; All he seen was the doctor's report that
[1:17:27] was handed.
[1:17:29] BUT ELIJAH STEPPED OUT THERE AND SAID,
[1:17:31] "GOD," HE DIDN'T CONDEMN HIM. HE SAID,
[1:17:33] "LORD, OPEN HIS EYES."
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, BROTHER RAM SAID, ELIJAH
[1:17:38] DIDN'T EVEN SEE THOSE ANGELS.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; HE SAID HE JUST TOOK CONFIDENCE IN THE
[1:17:44] WORD, BUT THE AN ANGELS OF GOD IN CAMP
[1:17:48] AROUND THOSE THAT FEAR HIM AND TRUST
[1:17:50] HIM.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; ELISHA HAD ALREADY HAD CONTACT WITH IT.
[1:17:54] BUT YOU SEE, THAT'S THAT'S HOW CERTAIN
[1:17:56] IT WAS. ELISHA DIDN'T HAVE TO GO OUT
[1:17:58] THERE AND SAY, "LET ME SEE IF GOD'S
[1:17:59] STILL HERE." HE KNEW GOD GOD IS RIGHT
[1:18:02] AROUND ALL THE TIME. I'VE SEEN HIM. HE'S
[1:18:04] GIVEN HIS WORD. I'M GOING TO STAND ON
[1:18:06] HIS WORD. AND STANDING ON THAT WORD
[1:18:09] [screaming] BROUGHT THE EYESIGHT THAT
[1:18:11] THAT MAN needed to stabilize him.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Once he could see,
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; there is more with us.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Soon as his seeing changed,
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Oh, sometimes that's what
[1:18:25] God, that's what we need is our seeing
[1:18:27] change.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the way we're looking at
[1:18:29] things, friends, we God, we we need our
[1:18:31] seeing change. Lord, help me to see it
[1:18:33] the way you're seeing it. Help me not to
[1:18:35] look AT IT THE WAY THAT I've got it all
[1:18:36] FIGURED OUT. AND I THINK THIS AND YOU
[1:18:38] SAY, "WELL, BROTHER SAMMY, THE WAY I'VE
[1:18:40] GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT, LET ME JUST say
[1:18:41] it to YOU THAT THE WAY YOU'VE GOT IT ALL
[1:18:43] FIGURED OUT IS GOD, THEN WHY ARE YOU
[1:18:46] feeling the way YOU'RE FEELING?
[1:18:48] YOU CAN'T HAVE THINGS FIGURED OUT AS
[1:18:50] THOUGH IT'S GOD TELLING YOU THINGS AND
[1:18:52] YOU STILL GOT GRUDGES AND YOU STILL GOT
[1:18:54] MALICE AND YOU STILL GOT ENVY AND YOU
[1:18:56] STILL GOT A GOT A TERRIBLE ATTITUDE.
[1:18:59] THAT AIN'T [screaming] GOD. BECAUSE WHEN
[1:19:00] GOD GIVES A VISION, IT DOES NOT LEAVE
[1:19:04] THAT THERE.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; A lot of times that's our own
[1:19:09] suspicions.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's good. THAT'S GOOD. [snorts]
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY EVERYTHING'S GOT TO BE
[1:19:14] CHECKED BY GOD. YES.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING'S GOT TO I DON'T CARE IF IT'S
[1:19:17] BEEN 10 OUT OF 10 BEFORE. IF IT'S NUMBER
[1:19:19] 11, IT better be checked.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Why? Because an evil
[1:19:25] spirit can come right in
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; because remember when God calls the sons
[1:19:28] of God together, the prophet tells us
[1:19:30] question and answers on the Holy Ghost
[1:19:32] all the way uh God being misunderstood.
[1:19:34] Church order 1963 on and on. He said
[1:19:36] 1964 question and answers. HE SAID EVERY
[1:19:39] TIME WHEN THE SAINTS ARE GATHERED, HE
[1:19:41] SAID SATAN IS RIGHT THERE AS WELL.
[1:19:44] Are you HEARING ME? THIS IS WHY WE DO
[1:19:46] NOT TAKE EVERY SPIRITUAL HAPPENING AND
[1:19:49] DECLARE IT TO BE OF GOD. BUT LET
[1:19:51] EVERYTHING BE BROUGHT TO THE WORD OF GOD
[1:19:53] AND LET IT BE PROVEN.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; YOUR FEELINGS AND MY FEELINGS ARE NOT
[1:19:58] THE URUM.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; YOUR FEELINGS AND MY FEELINGS ARE CALLED
[1:20:03] IMPRESSIONS.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Good preaching.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. BUT YOU SEE, THIS IS
[1:20:11] WHY WE GOT TO BE ABLE TO LOOK, LOOK
[1:20:13] BEYOND GOD. I NEED SIGHT TO BE ABLE TO
[1:20:15] SEE THINGS FOR HOW they really are.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Now remember Abraham here, Abraham comes
[1:20:25] up to the mountain and Hebrews 11
[1:20:27] records it that he he was accounting.
[1:20:30] This was his thoughts. Abraham had got
[1:20:32] to such a place when in his walk with
[1:20:35] God
[1:20:37] that he didn't run.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Y'all didn't hear me. I said he didn't
[1:20:42] run.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; This was something that was very hard.
[1:20:46] This was harder than famine in the land.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; This was harder. EVEN AFTER THE
[1:20:52] VISITATION OF ELOHIM, he lied
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; again.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; That besetting sin was right there.
[1:21:00] resurfaced.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; That tendency was right there. But
[1:21:04] through the revealing, listen, but
[1:21:06] through the revealing of Elohim, not
[1:21:09] only did it take care of their bodies,
[1:21:11] it took care of what was needed.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Because you don't find Abraham doing
[1:21:16] that again.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; This was the hardest thing that they've
[1:21:20] had that he's had to go through. Hey,
[1:21:21] look, Lot was a hard thing for Abraham.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; He loved Lot,
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD ASKED YOU TO SEPARATE from
[1:21:27] something, you listen, it's not hard to
[1:21:29] separate from the boss. you don't care
[1:21:30] for,
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; right? It ain't hard to separate from
[1:21:34] the friends that made fun of you and run
[1:21:36] you down and, you know, picked at you.
[1:21:38] That ain't hard.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; You're like, "Thank you, Lord.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Bless your name, Lord. I love you so
[1:21:44] much." NO, BUT GOD CALLS YOU TO SEPARATE
[1:21:47] FROM WHAT? THINGS THAT WOULD BE CROWDING
[1:21:50] out his love that wants to spread out in
[1:21:52] your life.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; HE WANTS TO SPREAD FORTH in your life.
[1:21:57] And and it was hard when he had to
[1:21:59] separate from Lot. But he came to this
[1:22:01] point in his walk with God. And God knew
[1:22:04] this was in Abraham the whole time,
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; But God didn't microwave it. God didn't
[1:22:10] do it overnight. A lot of
[1:22:13] misunderstandings along THE WAY. A LOT
[1:22:16] OF FAILURES THAT GOD ALLOWED TO BE
[1:22:17] INCLUDED.
[1:22:20] But none of them failures,
[1:22:25] none of them failures, I don't want to
[1:22:26] do this cuz my Bible's ALREADY TATTERED.
[1:22:28] BUT NONE OF THEM FAILURES OF THE OLD
[1:22:29] Testament could get over here in THE
[1:22:31] NEW.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHY? COULDN'T MAKE IT THROUGH
[1:22:35] THE BLOOD.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; COULDN'T MAKE IT THROUGH THE BLOOD.
[1:22:39] THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET WHEN HE PREACHES
[1:22:41] PERFECT STRENGTH THROUGH PERFECT
[1:22:43] WEAKNESS AND HE TAKES ABOUT 45 MINUTES
[1:22:45] IN THE BEGINNING OF IT AND HE'S DEALING
[1:22:47] WITH HOW WHEN GOD WRITES OUR DIVINE
[1:22:50] COMMENTARY, IT IS NOT GOING TO BE YOUR
[1:22:52] MISTAKES THAT ARE WRITTEN AND THAT ARE
[1:22:55] MENTIONED BECAUSE THE BLOOD IS
[1:22:57] SUFFICIENT TO TAKE CARE OF IT.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; You know why? Cuz the blood is the
[1:23:07] ultimate editor.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; It's the ultimate editor before it goes
[1:23:14] published.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Before it's published up there, it's the
[1:23:19] ultimate eding tool.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; It's not artificial intelligence. It's
[1:23:23] divine intelligence.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And Abraham goes up there.
[1:23:30] Notice there's these wording when
[1:23:32] Abraham comes up to this place in
[1:23:33] Genesis 22. And God AFTER HIS HAND IS
[1:23:36] DRAWN BACK AND GOD SAID, "NOW I KNOWEST
[1:23:38] THAT THOU WHAT? Fearest God."
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Right.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Now, you mean to tell me God couldn't
[1:23:46] have already seen this in him? He did.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; But God wants to see it made flesh,
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Cuz you want to know why? Every time
[1:23:55] that word is becoming flesh in your
[1:23:57] life, like it is right here, this was an
[1:23:59] example of God becoming one of us.
[1:24:04] And the same way when that word remember
[1:24:06] the prophet tells his future home he
[1:24:07] said when God thought of himself
[1:24:09] becoming tangible he thought of you and
[1:24:12] me.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; SO EVERY TIME when the word it's the
[1:24:16] word becoming tangible THE WORD BECOMING
[1:24:19] FLESH. IT'S GOD COMING FORTH IN OUR
[1:24:21] LIVES.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; THOU KNOWEST THOU FEAREST thou reverence
[1:24:26] reverence me.
[1:24:28] You've not withheld thine only son from
[1:24:30] me. Notice the prophet said Abraham had
[1:24:33] to love God to believe him.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Watch this. You love him and the more
[1:24:39] you love him, the more faith will
[1:24:43] accumulate.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Let me read this here. We're bound,
[1:25:00] Paul. Paul Paul says, "This is one
[1:25:02] place.
[1:25:06] We are bound to thank God always for
[1:25:08] you, brethren, as it is meat." When you
[1:25:09] read first Thessalonians, first
[1:25:11] Thessalonians, he's admonishing them to
[1:25:13] grow in faith. But now he says, "Because
[1:25:18] that your faith groweth exceedingly and
[1:25:22] the charity." See, there's no way for
[1:25:25] faith to grow. And charity is down here
[1:25:27] like a little peanut.
[1:25:29] it won't work. See, it grows the it's
[1:25:32] the love of God working in our lives
[1:25:35] that causes us to submit. You realize
[1:25:38] like brother Bram tells us in that
[1:25:39] statue of a perfect man, he said it's
[1:25:41] the divine intelligence that's working
[1:25:43] all of these things down through here.
[1:25:45] So it is it is divine love that brings
[1:25:48] even you and I into a place. You know,
[1:25:49] even when God corrects us and deals with
[1:25:51] and brings us to a place to where we can
[1:25:53] actually look and we can see ourselves
[1:25:55] in the word and say, "Oo, Lord Jesus,
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; forgive me, Lord.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord." Do you realize that's a
[1:26:03] love of God?
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; And then as we'll submit to that, the
[1:26:06] love of God goes to work to bring forth
[1:26:08] in our lives
[1:26:10] what only he can do. He's not asking you
[1:26:12] to bring it forth.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Remember, he's the vine,
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; the energy. We're the branches.
[1:26:20] and the charity of every one of you
[1:26:22] toward all toward each other aboundeth.
[1:26:25] So that we ourselves glory in you and
[1:26:27] the churches of God for your patience
[1:26:30] and faith in all your persecutions and
[1:26:33] tribulations
[1:26:35] that ye endure. So how is this how is
[1:26:39] this that their faith and their charity
[1:26:40] is growing?
[1:26:42] Does faith and charity grow when we're
[1:26:45] just sitting around and we're listening
[1:26:46] to the word of God? Well, faith cometh
[1:26:49] by hearing.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Right? But the only way that faith can
[1:26:53] grow is when there's test and there's
[1:26:55] trials.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; When there's situations that merit for
[1:27:00] growth. So the love of God is not going
[1:27:03] to not going to blossom forth within our
[1:27:06] life without having opposition to it.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Because you know what? You know what it
[1:27:11] is? The reason the opposition comes is
[1:27:13] to expose the frailty of the vessel
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; and to break down the will because
[1:27:21] remember in order for this to be our
[1:27:23] will has to be submitted to God.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; And so God knows just how to get us into
[1:27:28] that place to where within that we can
[1:27:31] recognize and then with the right kind
[1:27:32] of a fear we can reverence God. And like
[1:27:35] Abraham offered up his only his only
[1:27:40] son. You know the prophet types that in
[1:27:42] patriarch Abraham and he says what
[1:27:44] Abraham was doing there is he took what
[1:27:48] God had given him. He said that's like
[1:27:50] you as the believer when God has
[1:27:52] quickened your soul on the inside by the
[1:27:55] new birth. He said, "Then you walk forth
[1:27:57] to offer your all to God because from
[1:28:00] that very place in your life is where a
[1:28:03] growth of a son and daughter of God
[1:28:04] grows from." And so here you are. We're
[1:28:06] called over and over and over again.
[1:28:10] We're called to an altar.
[1:28:13] And the altar is not out here. Remember
[1:28:15] the prophet will tell us in the
[1:28:16] Revelation series, "The altar's in the
[1:28:18] mind where God will meet you and you
[1:28:19] know him." Then he'll say, "The altar is
[1:28:21] in your heart." Because it's really
[1:28:23] about self-will. It's about us letting
[1:28:26] down our own will. And God God allows
[1:28:29] situation. You know,
[1:28:31] God knows just how to get us into a
[1:28:34] place to where our will is broken.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; That is so true.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; And here's the thing about it. He don't
[1:28:42] feel no different about you or me than
[1:28:44] anybody else.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? God don't feel no
[1:28:48] different of, oh my, it took this long
[1:28:49] to for this one and their will to be
[1:28:51] broken. God don't feel no different at
[1:28:52] all. God's interested in his word is
[1:28:54] going to come forth.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; There might be some stubborn dirt, but
[1:28:58] God knows how to deal with the dirt in
[1:29:00] order to bring forth the seed.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? All of the things that
[1:29:04] we've been packed in, the baggage and
[1:29:06] everything that we collected along the
[1:29:07] way, the prophet called it the grabag of
[1:29:09] human life. Things that we've come, all
[1:29:12] this, we've come packed into our lives.
[1:29:14] But God gives us grace. Remember the
[1:29:16] prophet said it like this in the message
[1:29:18] absolute. He said, "God made me like
[1:29:20] this." He said for a reason so that when
[1:29:22] he came he could dig everything out of
[1:29:25] me.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY DIG IT ALL OUT OF ME DID
[1:29:28] SURRENDERING. GOD BROUGHT US INTO A
[1:29:31] PLACE TO WHERE OUR HUMAN FRAILTIES WILL
[1:29:34] BE EXPOSED. AND YOU MIGHT THINK MY THEY
[1:29:37] WERE SO GREATLY EXPOSED LAST YEAR OR
[1:29:40] LAST MONTH, BUT keep walking with God.
[1:29:41] There'll be more human frailties
[1:29:43] exposed.
[1:29:48] accumulate.
[1:29:50] The Ram says when you are converted to
[1:29:53] Christ, a love to Christ, then you
[1:29:56] accumulate
[1:29:58] a faith in Christ like you would to your
[1:30:00] wife or to your husband. You accumulate
[1:30:02] a faith that you walk in that faith. And
[1:30:04] I I know he said just something about
[1:30:06] you. You just got something that anchors
[1:30:08] there. So it's a faith that accumulates.
[1:30:10] So you mean it isn't all just like we I
[1:30:13] could ask you right through here that
[1:30:14] those of you those of us that are
[1:30:16] married your faith would be greater
[1:30:18] tonight than what it was should be what
[1:30:21] it was when we walked down the aisle.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; It's greater because why the love love
[1:30:25] is really grown.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Marriage is a place where love for love
[1:30:29] it's a bedding ground. It's a place that
[1:30:31] love itself can begin to grow. It's a
[1:30:33] place that faith can begin to
[1:30:35] accumulate. Think about your walk with
[1:30:37] God. You can't listen. You can't
[1:30:39] separate your walk with God and then and
[1:30:41] then look back over here. But you got to
[1:30:43] see God allowed those things to be
[1:30:45] examples and shadows of what that
[1:30:47] relationship is with you and him.
[1:30:49] Because even right now, you take,
[1:30:51] Brother Ram will say it like this. He
[1:30:52] said, you take for example somebody, he
[1:30:54] said an older veteran. And now it don't
[1:30:56] matter just because they've been old. It
[1:30:58] don't matter. It don't mean because
[1:30:59] they're old and they've served God for a
[1:31:01] long time that man that they got roots
[1:31:02] real deep. Sometimes they may not have
[1:31:04] roots real deep. Maybe there's a lot of
[1:31:06] other things they've accumulated or
[1:31:08] allowed to be accumulated in their life
[1:31:10] and instead of being sweet and instead
[1:31:12] of being welcoming, they're actually
[1:31:14] kind of cranky. They're actually bitter.
[1:31:16] There's been a lot of things come along,
[1:31:17] but they've accumulated the wrong
[1:31:19] things. You've got to be careful what
[1:31:23] you accumulate.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; And I'm talking to some of them. We're
[1:31:26] talking to everybody here, but I know in
[1:31:28] examples I can use in the natural,
[1:31:30] sometimes you can begin to accumulate
[1:31:32] things in the garage, accumulate things
[1:31:33] in the basement. I'll never forget right
[1:31:35] before we moved and you know I had no
[1:31:37] idea we were going to move and that that
[1:31:38] fall I was working on things clearing
[1:31:40] out things out of the shed clearing out
[1:31:42] things out in the basement the storage
[1:31:43] room where I'd be down there praying I
[1:31:45] was clearing THOSE THINGS OUT I LOOKED
[1:31:47] OUT ON THE CURB and I thought DEAR LORD
[1:31:49] THEY WOULD THINK WE'RE moving
[1:31:52] right I'm f I'm surprised I didn't have
[1:31:54] all the little rain stand come up HERE
[1:31:56] AND SAY WELCOME YOU'RE ONE OF us
[1:31:59] [laughter]
[1:32:00] I used to drive by the curb and I think
[1:32:02] dear God if I was a garbage man I'd quit
[1:32:05] couches and everything else thrown out
[1:32:07] there AND THINGS ALL PILED UP ALL ALONG
[1:32:09] THE CURVE. I dear Lord, it'll take one
[1:32:11] truck just to make it down two of these
[1:32:13] places here.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; True,
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; But you see, we can accumulate the wrong
[1:32:19] things. BUT IF WE HAD IF THE ROOTS ARE
[1:32:21] DOWN DEEP,
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; then you want HOW DID THOSE ROOTS get
[1:32:25] down deep? Because there's been a lot of
[1:32:28] storms.
[1:32:29] Right. Right.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; You know when you take new trees when
[1:32:33] they've I remember one time they planted
[1:32:35] some trees for me and they said, "Oh,
[1:32:36] the trees will be all right. You don't
[1:32:37] need to stake them." Okay.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; There was some good good size aritas.
[1:32:43] Good size.
[1:32:45] You don't need to stake them. Let me
[1:32:47] tell you. Let me tell you what happened.
[1:32:49] RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A STORM, I HAD TO
[1:32:51] GO OUT THERE.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; SO ANY TREES THAT I PLANT NOW, I DON'T
[1:32:56] CARE HOW BIG THEY ARE. I'M GOING TO
[1:32:58] STAKE THEM.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I KNOW HOW THAT WIND COMES
[1:33:02] ACROSS ON MY BACKYARD. AND THANK GOD I
[1:33:04] STAKE THOSE THAT WE PLANTED BECAUSE IF
[1:33:06] NOT, THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN RIPPED OUT.
[1:33:08] LIKE I LOST A couple of them because
[1:33:09] they got RIPPED OUT.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; SEE, GOD LISTEN, WHEN WE'RE STARTING IN
[1:33:13] OUR WALK WITH GOD, GOD STAKES our life.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; God puts supports around you.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:22] NOW THE SUPPORTS AROUND YOU and I are
[1:33:25] there to help us,
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; encourage us.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Hey, how you doing? You doing good?
[1:33:32] God's good, ain't he, brother Paul? He's
[1:33:34] wonderful. That's a support.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; He doesn't need a scriptural lecture
[1:33:38] from me.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; He needs support.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; God is good.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; God is faithful. The word will be
[1:33:46] preached. The word will be delivered.
[1:33:48] But you see, it would be just like
[1:33:49] somebody if you're telling somebody that
[1:33:51] needs an heart operation or they've got
[1:33:53] heart problems, it would it would you
[1:33:56] you'd be beating a dead horse if all you
[1:33:57] did was just talk about their diet,
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Ain't going to work.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Right. That's good.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; You've got to say, "Lord, give me the
[1:34:05] words
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; on what needs to be said, if anything at
[1:34:09] all."
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Come on now. That's good.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. Sometimes we're so interested
[1:34:14] in just throwing out words, but
[1:34:15] sometimes, listen friends, what what the
[1:34:17] world needs and what people need that
[1:34:19] are coming here, they need God with skin
[1:34:20] on it.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Come on, FRIENDS. NEED GOD WITH SKIN ON
[1:34:24] IT. BE A SUPPORT. BE A HELP. BE AN
[1:34:26] ENCOURAGEMENT TO THEM. LET [screaming]
[1:34:27] THE WORD OH, BROTHER SAMUEL, THEY NEED
[1:34:29] THIS. THEY NEED THIS. BE PATIENT and let
[1:34:32] the word do the work.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; BE PATIENT AND LET GOD TAKE CARE OF IT
[1:34:37] BECAUSE HE'S THE ONLY ONE CAN do it.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Your impatience,
[1:34:42] your frustration ain't gonna get
[1:34:43] nowhere. Let God do the work.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Accumulate a faith in Christ.
[1:34:52] Oh God, help us to accumulate the right
[1:34:54] things.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said, "I want you
[1:34:58] to take everything that's been done in
[1:35:00] this time," he said,
[1:35:03] and let it be accumulated in your heart.
[1:35:04] All the signs, the wonders, the word,
[1:35:07] let it be accumulated in your heart.
[1:35:10] Say, God, that's that's what that's what
[1:35:13] we want.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; We want the right things to be
[1:35:16] accumulated. The right things to be
[1:35:19] built up within our hearts and our
[1:35:21] lives.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; We want our hearts to be filled with
[1:35:25] God's word. Amen. Let's stand.
[1:35:37] Thank you Lord.
[1:35:48] Godly confidence.
[1:35:51] A godly confidence.
[1:35:55] Abraham
[1:35:56] accumulated
[1:35:58] faith.
[1:36:00] His trust. You've seen this. Abraham's
[1:36:02] trust it grew.
[1:36:06] His faith. How did his faith grow?
[1:36:09] Because his love grew.
[1:36:11] And as the love of God, as it grows,
[1:36:13] even in Abraham did not have access like
[1:36:16] you and I have.
[1:36:18] But he was able to come to that place
[1:36:24] to where we read about in Genesis 22
[1:36:28] where he would withhold nothing
[1:36:33] and stand on God's word. You know that's
[1:36:35] the ultimate achievement is just God's
[1:36:37] desire. Listen,
[1:36:39] every sign and wonder, every event that
[1:36:44] took place on the platform, every
[1:36:45] testimony that we have, it's wrote down.
[1:36:50] It's all for one purpose is to let you
[1:36:53] know just how much God cares for you.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; God is mindful.
[1:37:03] And it's to for us that our hearts
[1:37:08] it would be built. Faith would be built.
[1:37:11] And that it doesn't come overnight. But
[1:37:13] it takes God will put things in your
[1:37:16] life right now. It might be a Genesis
[1:37:19] 12. It might be a Genesis 13. Might be a
[1:37:21] Genesis 14 because every one of those
[1:37:24] were tried. Genesis 14, the king of
[1:37:27] Sodom came to him and said, "Hey, here
[1:37:29] let let me give you some riches.
[1:37:33] Let me let let me ensnare you with Lady
[1:37:36] Oia.
[1:37:37] And Abraham said, "You can save it
[1:37:41] because I didn't go out here to make a
[1:37:43] name for myself. I didn't go out here
[1:37:45] for riches. I've not come here for that.
[1:37:49] Purpose I went is to free my fallen
[1:37:52] brother."
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; He withtood all the offers
[1:37:59] that king of Sodom offered him.
[1:38:03] You know what he offered him? Think
[1:38:04] about it. Slime pits.
[1:38:08] You think, "Oo, that's oil."
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Offered him money.
[1:38:16] That's why the prophet said that there's
[1:38:18] just as many pineers as there is
[1:38:21] millionaires.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; You know what a pineier is? It's one
[1:38:25] that's always chasing money.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; Everything's about money. Life is about
[1:38:32] money. No wonder the Bible says that the
[1:38:34] root of all evil
[1:38:37] is money.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; And yet you have to have it.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; But I would say Lord, not at any
[1:38:47] compromise to your word.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; All around this this congregation, we've
[1:38:52] all and we will be will be tested. A lot
[1:38:56] of times people like to rehearse that.
[1:38:58] Brother Bram given the three pitfalls of
[1:39:00] ministry. That's true. It's true. Those
[1:39:02] things are very real. But I want you to
[1:39:04] also understand that those things and
[1:39:06] even when you look at pitfalls of money
[1:39:08] and everything else, there's things
[1:39:09] that's for some people, they'll never'll
[1:39:11] be never that'll never be something that
[1:39:12] they have to persevere and overcome
[1:39:14] behind. But then there'll be other
[1:39:15] people that'll actually have to say,
[1:39:17] "That overtime is pulling my strings,
[1:39:20] man, just to think what I could have."
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; And then you realize, you know what?
[1:39:27] Pretty soon it'll either be on the curb.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Or it'll be in the junkyard.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; That's why James admonishes us to labor
[1:39:36] for those things that do not corrupt.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Labor for the meat that
[1:39:44] does not perish."
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; And I I believe it like this. I I
[1:39:47] believe we can be this honest with God
[1:39:49] is say, "Lord, help me to have the right
[1:39:51] balance."
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Help me to have the right balance, Lord.
[1:39:55] that in everything that you Lord are
[1:39:57] first. You you might be at that Genesis
[1:39:58] 14. Maybe you're at Genesis 15, Lord. I
[1:40:00] don't know how it's going to be. Maybe
[1:40:02] Genesis 16, maybe there's a maybe
[1:40:04] there's a a way that's been taken with
[1:40:06] with, you know, and here's Hagar. But
[1:40:09] regardless,
[1:40:10] Abraham through it all, God was working
[1:40:12] and he brought corrections through it
[1:40:14] all. But no matter where it is, God is
[1:40:16] going to deal with each of our lives
[1:40:19] right where we're at.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; That's right. In other words, God is not
[1:40:22] going to give you a trial or a test that
[1:40:25] would be a Genesis 22 back in Genesis
[1:40:29] 15.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; We're not built to handle it yet.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; God's interested, and it's not that you
[1:40:35] would fall away from being a son and
[1:40:36] daughter of God, but God's interested in
[1:40:38] his word coming forth. He's interested
[1:40:41] in his word becoming flesh. So God knows
[1:40:44] just the right, like the prophet calls
[1:40:47] it in the church age book, the personal
[1:40:49] temptations that are fitted for this
[1:40:51] moment.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; But I say, Lord,
[1:40:56] help me.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord, that in this this moment
[1:41:03] right here, I can't look ahead to
[1:41:04] tomorrow, but right in this moment, this
[1:41:06] season that we're in right now, help me
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want the word to be flesh. Amen.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Now, in this season,
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Samuel want the word flesh already
[1:41:17] before. Yeah, but it's there's got to be
[1:41:19] more.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; It's more of God taking over more of
[1:41:23] Samuel.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; It's an accumulating more and more. You
[1:41:26] know, you get to a place with your wife
[1:41:28] or your husband, you know them.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; They don't even have to say anything.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's so true.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; You already know their likes or
[1:41:34] dislikes. You could walk into a house
[1:41:36] where you are invited and you could
[1:41:38] already know
[1:41:42] And you just already know. Hey honey,
[1:41:43] would you like some salt? You already
[1:41:45] know. You You already know it's not
[1:41:47] salted enough. You know them. Some of
[1:41:50] y'all looking at me like you're giving
[1:41:52] away secrets.
[1:41:54] That's how it is with God.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; You get to know him.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; You get to know his ways. And all of
[1:42:02] that tribulation workketh patience.
[1:42:05] Patience experience. Experience hope.
[1:42:07] And hope maketh not ashamed.
[1:42:10] Don't you love him?
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank God for real stability.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Thank God for confidence. It's not a
[1:42:17] confidence that's come from man. It's
[1:42:19] confidence that's come from God.
[1:42:22] Let's bow our heads in prayer. Father,
[1:42:26] we just Lord ask that right here tonight
[1:42:30] Lord just let your your word just be so
[1:42:33] planted in our hearts.
[1:42:35] Help us Lord. But I pray no matter where
[1:42:37] we're at in our journey, no matter where
[1:42:39] we're at in our walk, Lord, whether it's
[1:42:42] Genesis 12, 13, 14, 15, all the way up,
[1:42:46] Lord, to 22. And then even after 22,
[1:42:49] after such a powerful time on that
[1:42:52] mountain,
[1:42:55] Abraham walked off of that mountain
[1:42:59] and Sarah
[1:43:01] went on home to be with you.
[1:43:04] right after a high mountaintop
[1:43:06] experience sometimes Lord
[1:43:09] those are the very hardest times of our
[1:43:11] lives
[1:43:14] and you know that Lord and we need you.
[1:43:17] So Father all throughout this
[1:43:19] congregation
[1:43:22] may you be Lord the very confidence in
[1:43:24] each of our hearts. If there's one Lord
[1:43:27] that hasn't come to that
[1:43:30] real settleness, Lord, in their heart
[1:43:34] where the love of God has brought that
[1:43:35] peace, Lord, that's passing all
[1:43:37] understanding and that that testimony
[1:43:40] just bears witness in their life,
[1:43:43] Lord. There's been a passing from death
[1:43:45] unto life. Their life has been changed.
[1:43:49] And the only thing, Lord, that they live
[1:43:50] for is to please you,
[1:43:53] to serve you, Lord God.
[1:43:56] And father, we know that we can't serve
[1:43:58] you without having a heart to serve one
[1:44:01] another.
[1:44:03] So help us,
[1:44:05] Lord God. I'm standing here, brothers
[1:44:07] and sisters, pressures all around us.
[1:44:12] All around us. Lord God, we hear the the
[1:44:15] the scriptures ringing out
[1:44:17] right through the headlines. Wars and
[1:44:19] rumors of wars. Nations positioning
[1:44:22] themselves.
[1:44:25] Oh God,
[1:44:27] things that's being strategically done,
[1:44:31] help us. Help us to make every moment
[1:44:34] right now, Lord, count. Cuz we don't
[1:44:36] know what tomorrow holds. We don't know
[1:44:38] what the next year holds. But God, right
[1:44:40] now, living in this moment, Lord, I want
[1:44:42] to be I want to be closer to you, Lord.
[1:44:45] I want to be more like you, Lord. I want
[1:44:47] this word
[1:44:49] to live in me, Lord.
[1:44:51] And Father, as you're moving in my heart
[1:44:54] and in my life, help me.
[1:44:58] I don't want to live a selfish life.
[1:45:01] Help me, Lord, to be a support to
[1:45:04] someone else along the way. Help me to
[1:45:07] be an encouragement, Lord, to someone
[1:45:09] else that would encourage them, Lord.
[1:45:11] Maybe they're going through the hardness
[1:45:12] of trial. Maybe, Lord, God,
[1:45:14] discouragement. Maybe it's a young one,
[1:45:16] Lord, a new one. Help me, Lord. Help me
[1:45:20] to be an encouragement.
[1:45:22] Help me to be one, Lord, that would
[1:45:24] encourage them.
[1:45:26] Oh, grant it, Lord God. Give us the
[1:45:29] right words to say, Lord. Give us, Lord,
[1:45:32] the Father, I pray in everything, Lord,
[1:45:35] we want, Lord, our desire.
[1:45:38] I believe there's been an accumulation,
[1:45:40] Lord, of faith.
[1:45:43] But Lord God, like even there's more
[1:45:45] quotes that I have down that I couldn't
[1:45:46] even get to tonight that your prophet
[1:45:49] stands right there at the end of super
[1:45:51] sense preached right after the super
[1:45:54] sign right after the Holy Ghost series
[1:45:56] and he says, "Oh God, I want more of
[1:46:00] that faith.
[1:46:02] I want more faith in this upcoming
[1:46:04] year." When the enemy comes and batters
[1:46:07] in my mind, he said, "Lord, I want that
[1:46:09] shield of faith that can block every one
[1:46:11] of those darts that comes. I want more
[1:46:13] faith, Lord. I must have more faith.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; Find it, Lord. In successive years going
[1:46:20] on the request. Why? Because every
[1:46:24] season
[1:46:26] demands more.
[1:46:31] But Lord,
[1:46:32] it's not us supplying it. It's us
[1:46:35] yielding.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; Oh God, may that be Lord the real the
[1:46:40] real part in our lives. and realizing
[1:46:42] Lord, it's not in my trying, it's not in
[1:46:45] my running, it's not in my struggling,
[1:46:47] it's in yielding.
[1:46:49] That reverential obedience, the fear of
[1:46:51] the Lord to humble ourselves and say,
[1:46:54] "Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord."
[1:46:58] Grant it, Lord. I pray, Father. Bless
[1:47:00] your children tonight, Lord. Dear God,
[1:47:03] as we go, Lord, would even go here in
[1:47:05] just a few moments our separate ways. Be
[1:47:07] with them tomorrow. Give them strength,
[1:47:09] Lord. May you help us, Lord, in that
[1:47:13] chapter where we're at, like in
[1:47:14] Abraham's life. Help us.
[1:47:18] Help us, Lord, that we might walk with a
[1:47:21] real godly confidence
[1:47:23] in you. In you, Lord.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; Grant it, Lord. We pray in the name of
[1:47:30] Jesus Christ.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Go ahead. Through it [singing]
[1:47:35] all,
[1:47:38] Lord. All through it all,
[1:47:44] [singing and music]
[1:47:45] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, I've learned to trust [music] in

[1:48:12] his [music]
[1:48:12] word.
[1:48:18] I've had many tears and sorrows.
[1:48:23] I've had questions for tomorrow.
[1:48:27] [singing]
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; There have been [music] times I didn't
[1:48:31] know right from wrong. [singing]
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; [music]

[1:48:52] to make me shine. [music]

[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, through it all.

[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; through it all. Through
[1:49:25] [singing and music] it all,
[1:49:29] I'll learn to [music and singing] depend

[1:49:43] places and I've
[1:49:46] seen a lot of faces. [singing and music]
[1:49:51] There have been times I felt so
[1:49:54] [music and singing]
[1:49:55] whole alone,
[1:50:00] but it's in [singing and music] that
[1:50:02] lonely hour. Hear that precious lonely
[1:50:09] [music and singing] hour
[1:50:10] that my Jesus let me know that I was his
[1:50:17] own. [music and singing]
[1:50:20] And yes, I'm through it all.
[1:50:25] Oh, through it all. [singing]
[1:50:31] Oh, I've [music] learned to trust
[1:50:33] [singing] in Jesus.
[1:50:36] And I've learned to trust in
[1:50:39] [music and singing] God.
[1:50:41] Yes. Now, through it all.

[1:50:52] is on earth and to [music and singing]
[1:50:54] depend
[1:50:56] upon his word.
[1:51:00] Let's sing this now. [music] I thank
[1:51:01] God. So I thank God [singing] for the
[1:51:05] mountains
[1:51:07] and
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; and I thank him for [singing and music]
[1:51:10] the valley.
[1:51:13] I thank him for [singing] all the
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; stories
[1:51:17] from br
[1:51:20] [music]
[1:51:22] because if I would [singing] never have
[1:51:25] [music] a problem
[1:51:27] but I would know that my God can solve
[1:51:31] them.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; Oh yes [music and singing] Lord I would
[1:51:34] even know your faith in the word of God
[1:51:39] would do. [music]

[1:52:38] Lord.
