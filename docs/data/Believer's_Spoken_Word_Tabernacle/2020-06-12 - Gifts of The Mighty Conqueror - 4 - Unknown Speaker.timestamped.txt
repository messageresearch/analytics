[40:21] captive and gave gifts unto men now that
[40:26] he ascended what is it but that he also
[40:28] descended first into the lower parts of
[40:31] the earth he that descended is the same
[40:34] also that ascended up far above all
[40:36] heavens that he might fill all things
[40:40] and he gave some apostles and some
[40:44] prophets and some evangelists and some
[40:46] pastors and teachers amen nothing just
[40:51] let me read out of first Corinthians 12
[40:54] 27 before we're seated there Paul is
[40:58] speaking of this body now ye are the
[41:04] body of Christ and members in particular
[41:09] and God hath set in the church first
[41:15] apostles apostles secondarily prophets
[41:18] thirdly teachers and after that miracles
[41:21] then gifts of healings helps
[41:23] government's diversities of tongues
[41:27] I think we can rest within this at God
[41:30] said it he set or placed it there then
[41:34] it shows God knows that we would have
[41:38] need of that and it's not so much of an
[41:41] office but it's God coming through to
[41:44] that office it's him that we have need
[41:47] of because a man can never meet our need
[41:51] no matter how how great the gift might
[41:54] be it's it's our faith is to be in God
[42:00] Abram talked about in
[42:03] faith is the victory and he spoke about
[42:07] a woman he said she would come to the
[42:09] altar brother Brown would pray with her
[42:11] over and over he said she would ask God
[42:14] to deliver from cigarettes all the in
[42:17] because that's what she was still
[42:18] battling with and he said you know he
[42:21] said she would cry weep them he said
[42:23] then the next day you need her she bowed
[42:25] knock you down he said but one day they
[42:29] came down to be known that she had
[42:31] cancer then he said she got the business
[42:34] she started praying and he said at that
[42:38] time he said God come down and moves for
[42:41] her he said see what happened is he said
[42:44] her faith was not in William Brennan her
[42:47] faith was not in Branham tabernacle he
[42:50] said that she took her faith and put it
[42:52] in the one she should have put it in the
[42:53] beginning and that's him that's a
[42:56] finished work see that's the goal of the
[42:59] ministry that's the goal within each of
[43:00] our lives because we recognize if
[43:03] someone when we go to witness to
[43:04] somebody we recognize by the joy it's
[43:06] more than just to get somebody to a
[43:08] church that's not the goal the goal is
[43:11] that they would get to Jesus Christ
[43:14] because he's the one that has changed
[43:18] our life he's the one that's made the
[43:21] difference
[43:22] god bless you you may be seated I know
[43:27] every word I say it counts the time
[43:29] against me so sometimes I wish I'd be
[43:33] able to claim that back
[43:36] but God when we look at this here in
[43:40] gifts of the mighty Conqueror I want to
[43:43] just still looking at this in the whole
[43:45] part of it at this time God intended man
[43:51] to preach the gospel he could God could
[43:55] have had the son to preach the gospel he
[43:57] could have asked the star as a matter of
[43:59] fact brother Pam told us he said the son
[44:01] never gets out of God's will the stars
[44:04] never gets out of God's will the sons
[44:06] never deliberated between two two or
[44:08] three different messages to preach and
[44:10] how men maybe I should have preached
[44:12] this or stood then stars don't either
[44:14] but yet all of them have their place
[44:17] because it's all God's Bible is that
[44:20] right and every wherever those stars are
[44:23] all known by its name but yet even
[44:25] though they have their sound and their
[44:27] sound goes out and there's a emanating
[44:29] of their sound and it would actually
[44:31] there's a warship that's going on but
[44:34] yet God intended that man would preach
[44:37] the gospel and yet it's not based on the
[44:42] ability of man but yet it is that which
[44:46] is through a yielded divinely placed
[44:49] gift in that life that the Lord would
[44:52] use to reflect himself into the midst of
[44:56] his people and call his children back to
[44:58] that original life it's it's very much
[45:00] like this microphone that I'm wearing
[45:02] here tonight this microphone itself is
[45:05] not it's not giving out any sound it's
[45:11] only a tool that I've picked up off of
[45:14] my desk put the batteries in it and put
[45:17] it on and it allows the voice to be
[45:20] transmitted that you can hear it a
[45:22] little better and that's all that a gift
[45:25] what a gift is to be is that which is
[45:29] yielded to God that God might speak and
[45:33] God might achieve what he intends to
[45:36] achieve and you know God never gets in a
[45:40] hurry it's us who gets in a hurry and
[45:42] it's always something to always be
[45:45] mindful in our lives that it's not
[45:49] ability that does anything in the very
[45:54] thing that when we get to relying upon
[45:56] our ability is where we fail and that's
[46:00] within any aspect in every part of our
[46:03] life my prayer is through these things
[46:05] that God will help us but this gets
[46:08] applied right down into every life
[46:11] because remember just as God would take
[46:14] a messenger to an age as a star that's
[46:17] in his right hand and the right hand
[46:19] signifies power and authority and God
[46:22] would take that vessel and God would
[46:25] project his life his light through that
[46:28] vessel it would be an example to the
[46:31] rest in that age of how God intends to
[46:35] use man but men but it doesn't mean that
[46:38] that man that whether ministry or
[46:41] whether it's a man or woman it doesn't
[46:43] mean that they are supposed to do how
[46:46] God has used that man
[46:48] remember God makes himself known that he
[46:51] is the present God when he sent Moses
[46:55] with a message the purpose is he's told
[46:57] them he says you tell them I am hath
[47:00] sent you it's a present god it makes us
[47:05] aware that there is a present God right
[47:08] here among us and so when we're when we
[47:13] look at this this is where that Peter
[47:15] would pick up in 1st Peter chapter 4
[47:18] verse 10 and he would say as every man
[47:20] have to received the gift the gift what
[47:23] gift the gift of the Holy Ghost received
[47:27] it it's a gift even so Minister the same
[47:31] one to another so here's the body
[47:33] ministry let that Life Minister to
[47:37] minister means to serve one another and
[47:40] as good stewards of the manifold grace
[47:44] of God what God has bestowed upon our
[47:47] lives there's a purpose there's a reason
[47:50] it it's it's not just in Redemption but
[47:53] it's that our lives might also minister
[47:57] one to another the same way than in our
[48:00] natural bodies as God keeps on
[48:02] in those examples we every part of the
[48:05] body must operate in a coordinated
[48:08] manner and yet it's things that
[48:10] altogether are not always audible but
[48:14] there are things that can happen that
[48:16] the eyes can pick up and it and then
[48:19] it's able to take something in and then
[48:21] the rest of the body will move out of
[48:24] harm's way because the eyes have saw
[48:27] something and the mind has processed it
[48:30] and then the rest of the body is able to
[48:32] get out of the way yet there's no
[48:35] audible sound to it but yet it's
[48:37] something that the eyes can see showing
[48:39] that every part of the body is to work
[48:42] in harmony and I'm telling you that in
[48:45] itself is a great paradox because in
[48:50] order for a body to operate in harmony
[48:52] the hand can't argue with the eyes the
[48:56] arm can't argue with the legs in so it's
[48:59] gonna require sacrifice on every part
[49:02] there's only one thing that can bring
[49:05] that sacrifice and that's for the true
[49:08] sacrifice for him to be so preeminent in
[49:12] our lives where that word brings a
[49:15] coordinating of every effort in our life
[49:18] and that's exactly what the Prophet when
[49:21] he spoke the message humbled thyself he
[49:23] said in order to see this third pole
[49:26] really demonstrated among us it will
[49:28] require a humility and a coordination
[49:31] among every member it requires that out
[49:38] of our life now Paul Peter goes on to
[49:42] say in 1st Peter 4:11 if any man speak
[49:45] let him speak as the Oracles of God if
[49:50] any man minister let him do it as of the
[49:54] ability which God giveth that God in all
[49:59] things may be glorified through Jesus
[50:03] Christ to whom be praised and Dominion
[50:05] for ever and ever amen
[50:07] now Peter in an inner and another place
[50:10] here Peter picks up the God's
[50:12] commissioning now remember they have
[50:15] been commissioned to take this gospel
[50:17] and to preach this gospel but it's not
[50:21] left in just into the hands of man but
[50:24] it must be God in man carrying on his
[50:30] own work so Peter here as he would pick
[50:34] this up to recognize he says of which
[50:37] salvation the prophets have inquired and
[50:41] searched diligently who prophesied of
[50:44] the grace that should come to you
[50:46] searching what or what manner of time
[50:49] the Spirit of Christ which was in them
[50:51] did signify when it testified beforehand
[50:56] the sufferings of Christ and the glory
[50:59] that should follow
[51:02] unto whom it was revealed that not unto
[51:06] themselves but unto us they did minister
[51:09] the things which are now reported unto
[51:12] you by them that have preached the
[51:15] gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent
[51:18] down from heaven which things the angels
[51:21] desire to look into there's a difference
[51:24] between just preaching and the Holy
[51:26] Ghost doing the preaching there's a big
[51:30] difference here see this right here when
[51:33] the Holy Spirit the same one who
[51:36] declared the coming salvation and moved
[51:38] within the prophets and with within that
[51:41] word there was distinction there was
[51:44] direction there was appointment all of
[51:46] that was laid out there now look the
[51:49] same Holy Spirit that would tell that
[51:51] prophet elect when you read in the Book
[51:53] of Isaiah Isaiah in one chapter and it's
[51:56] not Isaiah it's the Spirit of God he'll
[51:58] break back and forth between the present
[52:02] he'll come into the gentile age and then
[52:05] they'll break right over into that of
[52:07] god dealing with the 144,000 after the
[52:10] rapture then you'll move to the
[52:11] millennium and then right into the
[52:13] future hold not in chapters but
[52:15] sometimes in one chapter and it's not
[52:20] even in chronological order but it's the
[52:24] same god it takes god to put it all
[52:28] together so it all comes down to it is
[52:34] us depending on Jehovah Jireh and he
[52:38] always provides for himself when we're
[52:42] in the midst of battle he reveals
[52:44] himself as our banner when we're in
[52:48] trouble he reveals himself as our peace
[52:51] because all of these are attributes
[52:54] seven compound redic today's of the one
[52:58] same Living God so the Holy Spirit is
[53:03] what takes the word it must be the Holy
[53:07] Spirit to deliver that word that's how
[53:09] God prepares
[53:11] a man not by schooling the brem talks
[53:17] about those were that light has come
[53:20] through then they're faithfully taught
[53:23] but faithfully taught does not mean they
[53:25] have sat down on a bench and they have
[53:28] been instructed by an elder howbeit
[53:30] there is a necessity of that doctrine
[53:33] and for that to be taught but that
[53:37] cannot replace the light from shining
[53:40] into your life this word must not be or
[53:46] confined just to doctrine or theology it
[53:49] is the Express light of Jesus Christ
[53:53] it's that same light that reflection
[53:56] that image because after all in the
[53:59] Church of the Living God we don't want
[54:01] to see man reproducing himself but it
[54:04] should be God reproducing his own life
[54:08] men are called to be eunuchs not their
[54:11] own seed but God injecting his seed and
[54:15] bringing forth Messiah that's the goal
[54:20] of the gospel so it's not a man-made
[54:25] screwing it's got to be an experience
[54:29] with God it takes us stripping before
[54:38] Aaron and and his sons could enter in
[54:41] they had to meet the Prophet at the door
[54:44] they had to be stripped of their
[54:47] garments that's not only just for the
[54:51] ministry that's for each of our lives we
[54:54] must be presented before the word for
[54:58] our day and stripped of our own ideas
[55:01] stripped of our own will it requires us
[55:06] to lay him down then that word comes
[55:10] forth to wash us you can't be anointed
[55:14] until you've been washed
[55:17] you've got to be washed by the word
[55:20] first once you wash by the word then you
[55:24] can be dressed by the word and anointed
[55:27] by the word then you're ready for
[55:28] service and the service is only a
[55:32] manifestation of a vision that God has
[55:35] given the Prophet which is the word that
[55:39] now has been revealed now becomes flesh
[55:42] and manifests in sons and daughters of
[55:45] God because it is that same life that
[55:48] comes to bring us into expression we
[55:55] become a prisoner to the revelation we
[56:00] become a prisoner you see these these
[56:06] these realities that have been spoke to
[56:09] me these are more than just titles a
[56:11] prisoner you become Yelp with the word
[56:16] you see it's the same Jesus continuing
[56:20] on his work he's just using his body to
[56:24] do it the same way he used his corporal
[56:27] body to come and bring Redemption as
[56:31] that body was under the anointing of
[56:34] redemption show is the body of Jesus
[56:38] Christ under that same anointing of
[56:40] redemption oh that's why I love that in
[56:49] in in in Acts chapter 1 verse 1 all
[56:53] grateful offers those things were Jesus
[56:56] began to do and teach and the Prophet
[57:01] picks it up and the message token and
[57:02] he's continuing to do it
[57:07] hallelujah it's a continuation well
[57:12] that's why we are one body one family
[57:16] there's family strains that are through
[57:19] this body
[57:21] whoo Laura meter cop they just it's part
[57:25] of the fatty rocks in this family so to
[57:37] think it's him in his people co-workers
[57:40] and redemption it committed to unto us
[57:43] the word of reconciliation he is divine
[57:47] were the branches
[57:51] we're his branches were born of his life
[57:56] in that tree we are his branches I want
[58:02] you to look here in the scripture in
[58:04] Isaiah 52 6 therefore my people shall
[58:09] know my name he's not only talking about
[58:12] to that of when the Jews are regathered
[58:15] back and he reveals his name but he's
[58:20] talking to you and I right now because
[58:23] you can only worship Him when it is
[58:26] revealed where he's placed his name his
[58:30] name is his life is his character when
[58:33] Jesus was here and he said in John John
[58:37] I believe with John 17 I have manifested
[58:40] thy name unto those thou has given me
[58:45] out of the world and what does the Sun
[58:48] do look at listen now a woman is not a
[58:53] carrier of her father's name right but
[58:58] it requires a son that's why I went God
[59:00] he came fresh he did not become a woman
[59:03] he become man I'll pause on that one
[59:07] tonight because there has to come forth
[59:10] that life that was left forfeited back
[59:13] there in the beginning hallelujah
[59:17] so now notice therefore they shall know
[59:20] in that day that I am he that does speak
[59:23] behold it is I how beautiful
[59:28] upon the mountains look at this are the
[59:32] feet of him that bringeth good tidings
[59:37] that publishes peace that bringeth good
[59:42] tidings of good that publishes salvation
[59:45] that saith unto Zion thy God reigneth
[59:52] publisher's means to preach jesus said
[59:58] go you therefore and preach this gospel
[1:00:05] demonstrate this gospel now think I want
[1:00:10] you to look at this feat speaks of being
[1:00:13] active we're not just standing still see
[1:00:18] every time within the word how it has to
[1:00:21] be applied yes we need to be established
[1:00:24] in the Word of God we need to have our
[1:00:26] feet placed on solid ground but yet now
[1:00:30] moving in this part of it we must be
[1:00:33] active with that word but like Isaiah we
[1:00:37] cannot become active with the word until
[1:00:41] Farrah's we have had a confession oh my
[1:00:47] right and from a confession now comes
[1:00:51] forth cleansing once cleansing happens
[1:00:54] then were commissioned all of those
[1:00:57] parts have to come in and in reckon look
[1:01:00] what look what the new birth does it
[1:01:02] draws us beyond our own our own
[1:01:07] selfishness but we've got to battle that
[1:01:12] every day but feet speak of being active
[1:01:19] running with the message witnesses that
[1:01:24] are going forth with his life carrying
[1:01:27] his message
[1:01:31] preaching the acceptable year a time to
[1:01:35] return to your inheritance this is the
[1:01:38] reality of the greater works did not
[1:01:40] Jesus say he said the greater works you
[1:01:44] shall do than this let's think of it
[1:01:47] brother Brandon would place it like this
[1:01:48] and let me just refer to it he said
[1:01:51] Jesus could not preach the baptism of
[1:01:54] the Holy Ghost because it had not yet
[1:01:56] come that's greater works the church is
[1:02:01] to preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:05] jesus said it was coming but the church
[1:02:08] has it and saying we got it and it's for
[1:02:11] you
[1:02:15] hallelujah
[1:02:16] my my my when Jesus was standing here
[1:02:19] remember when he took the scroll and he
[1:02:22] found the place that it was written he
[1:02:25] announced and declared the acceptable
[1:02:28] year of the Lord it's at hand hey man it
[1:02:38] was it was a time for it to be breaking
[1:02:41] for it now think of it in the ministry
[1:02:43] as he walked here in his ministry there
[1:02:47] were sicknesses and diseases lifted from
[1:02:51] the people he brought our infirmities
[1:02:56] devils were cast out you see what he did
[1:03:01] in groom form that same Jesus Bay men
[1:03:07] coming back in bright form he would do
[1:03:10] the same take better he did not diminish
[1:03:14] in power as when Adam was was laid to
[1:03:20] sleep and rest and the mystery that was
[1:03:23] with anyone he was revolving for could
[1:03:25] only be brought out when Adam was laid
[1:03:28] to rest and when he came forth notice
[1:03:31] has God prepared that body taking from
[1:03:34] what was already there what he had
[1:03:37] already created he brought that body and
[1:03:40] separated the original spirit all my and
[1:03:43] divided that original spirit and he
[1:03:46] placed into her and the spirit that he
[1:03:49] placed into her would be a feminine
[1:03:52] designation of Adam himself this is why
[1:03:57] the real believer humbles themselves to
[1:04:00] the word a man may recognize their
[1:04:04] husband they recognize when he speaks
[1:04:08] [Applause]
[1:04:09] they met a real believer this ain't a
[1:04:12] real believer your spirit ain't a real
[1:04:15] believer either but got pepper knackles
[1:04:19] in that real believer which is that seed
[1:04:22] attribute of God he raises that up he
[1:04:27] begins to fellowship and he speaks to
[1:04:34] that son or daughter and says you got
[1:04:36] jurisdiction over this possession this
[1:04:40] thing says I'm tired but the inner man
[1:04:44] says but I'm going to the house of God
[1:04:49] this guy says man I'm so tired I don't
[1:04:54] know if I can pray today but the inner
[1:04:56] man says prayer in about a position of
[1:05:00] your body it's a condition of your heart
[1:05:05] [Applause]
[1:05:12] if he Hebrews 2 verse 11 I want you to
[1:05:18] look in the description here for both he
[1:05:21] that sanctifies and they who are
[1:05:24] sanctified are all of one we needed him
[1:05:32] we couldn't clean ourselves up brother
[1:05:34] William we needed him he said right we
[1:05:38] needed him he's the one who came down
[1:05:41] from glory to bring many sons unto glory
[1:05:48] for which cause he's not ashamed to call
[1:05:52] them brethren oh I wish I could preach
[1:05:54] on there that's a whole mouthful right
[1:05:57] there think of it he's not ashamed to
[1:06:01] call you and me brethren
[1:06:05] even of everything that the enemy could
[1:06:08] try to accuse you of but it's not
[1:06:11] ashamed to call you brother because why
[1:06:13] it is that inside man that has been
[1:06:18] raised up we were dead but he raised
[1:06:27] Kaman raised us up just as he made an
[1:06:31] appointment to visit the tomb where
[1:06:34] Lazarus was were there and he made an
[1:06:36] appointment to raise up that son or
[1:06:39] daughter that was on the inside of you
[1:06:41] and there's only one thing that could do
[1:06:43] that and that was his voice my sheep
[1:06:46] know my voice and we have followed him
[1:06:52] for every step every stage and we're
[1:06:56] following that voice this is what he's
[1:07:01] doing watch saying I will declare thy
[1:07:05] name unto my brethren in the midst of
[1:07:10] the church while I sing praise unto thee
[1:07:15] right in the midst of the church he's
[1:07:20] declaring his name this this phrase I
[1:07:23] will sing praise unto thee he is
[1:07:26] declaring this is a hymn it's like a
[1:07:29] hymn it's speaking of victory you can't
[1:07:34] correctly look at the Lord Jesus and see
[1:07:36] any defeat you see victory
[1:07:43] so the bride of Jesus Christ is yielded
[1:07:48] to him so much until she's a perfect
[1:07:52] reflection of him his working he is
[1:07:57] working through her it is Christ in her
[1:08:03] not her own identity but his working
[1:08:07] remember when in the book of Zechariah
[1:08:12] when it showed Zechariah the lampstands
[1:08:16] what is this sakurai Zechariah said I
[1:08:19] don't know thou knowest you tell me what
[1:08:23] that little room is I mean you tell me
[1:08:24] what them candelabras are this is what
[1:08:31] he said it was another night not by
[1:08:34] power but by my spirit saith the Lord
[1:08:39] it's his work his strength he's equipped
[1:08:44] his body to a tree what he is achieving
[1:08:47] through us doesn't mean that we don't
[1:08:52] wrestle with our humanity we wrestle
[1:08:54] with our humanity but greater is He that
[1:08:56] is in us then he that's in the world
[1:09:06] the identity is him his life look at
[1:09:10] this in Revelations 1 verse 12 here is
[1:09:15] John on the Isle of Patmos and remember
[1:09:18] this is to reveal the coming of the Lord
[1:09:23] and now John the voice has been speaking
[1:09:29] to him he said it was a voice like a
[1:09:30] trumpet sounding it had signification to
[1:09:35] him for the Bible says in verse 12 and I
[1:09:38] turned to see the voice he went looking
[1:09:42] for a person he said I turned to see
[1:09:44] that voice let speak to me you see it
[1:09:47] was something that was so personal to
[1:09:54] where it was just this is just personal
[1:09:57] to me
[1:09:59] it had a personal meaning and being
[1:10:05] turned I saw seven golden candlesticks
[1:10:08] look at this and in the midst of the
[1:10:12] seven candlesticks one like unto the Son
[1:10:17] of man that one like is his bride miss
[1:10:25] notice she's clothed with a garment down
[1:10:29] to the foot she's not standing there
[1:10:32] naked she's clothed with what his
[1:10:36] righteousness his holiness his power she
[1:10:39] is clothed down to the foot he has
[1:10:45] provided her garments and great about
[1:10:53] the paps with a golden girl she's as
[1:10:57] brother man would bring it and right
[1:10:59] across he said the breast and here it
[1:11:01] stands the bride of Jesus Christ you see
[1:11:05] it's a ministry even even in high
[1:11:07] priests but yet is a nun coming judgment
[1:11:10] and here what is holding that gospel
[1:11:14] it's the gospel that is holding the
[1:11:17] holiness and the power over the Church
[1:11:20] of the Living God this is what I want
[1:11:23] that knows very simple but I want you to
[1:11:24] see this verse 14 his head and his hairs
[1:11:31] were white like wool as white as snow
[1:11:34] and his eyes were as a flame of fire and
[1:11:37] his feet like unto fine brass as if they
[1:11:40] burned in the furnace and his voice as
[1:11:42] the sound of many waters do you notice
[1:11:45] it didn't say her her identity is him in
[1:11:51] her
[1:11:53] it is his feet and he had in his right
[1:12:00] hand seven stars out of his mouth went a
[1:12:03] sharp two-edged sword and his
[1:12:05] countenance was as the Sun shine attend
[1:12:07] his strength and when I saw him not a
[1:12:14] church not an idea when I saw him I fell
[1:12:20] at his feet as dead and he laid his
[1:12:24] right hand upon me saying unto me fear
[1:12:28] not I am the first and the last do you
[1:12:34] recognize that laying of the right hand
[1:12:36] upon your life brother shame laying upon
[1:12:39] your life brother day you recognize
[1:12:41] that's that same one the same power that
[1:12:44] moved upon Moses that sent Moses down
[1:12:47] the Egypt is the same power that part of
[1:12:50] the Red Sea and that same God by his
[1:12:53] power and authority has raised up in
[1:12:57] your life who you really are
[1:13:02] hallelujah an outstretched arm his right
[1:13:07] hand fear not I am the first and the
[1:13:14] last I am he that liveth and was dead
[1:13:19] nobody could ever say that
[1:13:23] but you know you can he became dead like
[1:13:28] we were but he might raise us up we
[1:13:35] could say I was dead bonel Milosh dead
[1:13:40] yeah I was dead what I mean I've seen
[1:13:43] you before out here and doing this no I
[1:13:44] was a dead man walking around that was a
[1:13:48] dead man
[1:13:49] but now I've been made alive in Christ
[1:13:52] Jesus amen I'm no longer dead I'm alive
[1:14:00] hallelujah who did that
[1:14:02] the same one who was dead and is now
[1:14:05] alive amen and have the keys of hell and
[1:14:09] of death now we notice that with the
[1:14:15] enemy here in this body it's God's God's
[1:14:21] Way is to lead his body I tell you when
[1:14:26] you you step back and you look at all
[1:14:28] this and to me it just you know it's God
[1:14:34] in control
[1:14:38] it's got to be God in control how God
[1:14:43] had puts everything together and brings
[1:14:46] it together how God and call in his body
[1:14:52] a unit you remember what was back in
[1:14:55] Eden the word was preeminent it was
[1:15:00] preeminent there in their midst
[1:15:02] they had brother Branham as he tells us
[1:15:06] in Satan Dean they had a perfect
[1:15:07] understanding of the love of God you
[1:15:09] know that you're not the perfect
[1:15:11] understanding of love God it brings it
[1:15:13] relaxes you you recognize what his love
[1:15:18] you're a witness of what his love has
[1:15:19] done in your life it's not this sappy
[1:15:25] worldly love that they teach out there
[1:15:27] oh Jesus just loves you no no no his
[1:15:31] love he loves you but he changes you
[1:15:34] that's real life that's what real love
[1:15:40] is real love projected it it has an
[1:15:43] effect but you find that how that
[1:15:49] Satan's does that remember what his
[1:15:50] desire has always been to be worshipped
[1:15:53] like God he's a sick guy
[1:16:02] but Satan has always he tries to move
[1:16:06] into this and man is susceptible by the
[1:16:09] fall to remand sometime States he's got
[1:16:13] to make things happen and he's got to do
[1:16:15] this and he's got to do that God is the
[1:16:18] one who is in control I like the
[1:16:22] statement you know brother Henry Green
[1:16:24] made years ago I was a member as a
[1:16:26] little boy I was just a just a boy when
[1:16:28] we first went there to those meetings
[1:16:30] and in North Carolina and sitting out on
[1:16:32] the hood of the car cuz we couldn't even
[1:16:33] get inside the the little church they
[1:16:35] had there in Ruth at the time but Henry
[1:16:38] made a statement he said God started his
[1:16:40] church in the beginning the way he
[1:16:42] wanted it and now he wants it the way he
[1:16:45] started it he's made a promise I'll
[1:16:52] restore so we find that when the first
[1:17:00] age and entered in it was in that age to
[1:17:03] where then we find is that Antichrist
[1:17:06] spirit was entering in and it was right
[1:17:09] in there real close and we find that how
[1:17:13] that eventually there was a drifting by
[1:17:17] that church natural from the real
[1:17:20] reality of Pentecost all they could see
[1:17:23] was what was on the outside religion
[1:17:27] began to become an appeal to them but it
[1:17:31] was not the life and what you think of
[1:17:34] this they were being removed from the
[1:17:37] very oversight of the Holy Spirit
[1:17:42] brother Brown would say it like this and
[1:17:44] I'm just gonna cut in on this statement
[1:17:46] he says the way of God boy that's
[1:17:48] a--that's a whole mouthful right there
[1:17:50] the way of God wants to lead them by the
[1:17:53] cloud of fire prophetic utterance
[1:17:56] miracles and signs and god-given wonders
[1:18:01] this was to be accomplished but God
[1:18:04] selected God ordained God equipped God
[1:18:08] sent men you notice when every one of
[1:18:10] them God equipped God selected God
[1:18:13] ordained God set
[1:18:15] you take god off of it no different than
[1:18:18] anything else
[1:18:21] you take God away from my life no
[1:18:24] different from any other life God makes
[1:18:28] the difference with the whole camp being
[1:18:36] dominated by Holy Ghost move that wasn't
[1:18:44] calling up you know having to call up
[1:18:46] pastor Moses and say pastor Moses I got
[1:18:49] something on my heart to pray for you
[1:18:51] you reckon I can pray for him that guy
[1:18:54] was already busy enough he couldn't even
[1:18:57] see it see everybody in the interviews
[1:18:59] as the way God speaks to you that's God
[1:19:01] telling you there ain't time to waste
[1:19:03] go I realize people could take that the
[1:19:14] wrong way of what I've just said but it
[1:19:15] listen every true gift and everything
[1:19:18] that God moves it will work in harmony
[1:19:20] with a vision it will always work in
[1:19:25] harmony with the vision and when it's
[1:19:27] not God is faithful to correct it why
[1:19:30] because correcting it doesn't mean
[1:19:32] removing it correcting means working
[1:19:37] with it because it's to be used
[1:19:46] so brother Brandon goes on the they
[1:19:48] makes a statement in that same one
[1:19:50] and once you're listening he says now I
[1:19:51] want to I want to say that I believe in
[1:19:53] leadership but it's not the leadership
[1:19:55] of men I believe in I believe in the
[1:19:59] leadership of the Holy Ghost coming
[1:20:01] through the word I believe also that God
[1:20:04] has sent men in the church men who are
[1:20:07] gifted by the Spirit and they will keep
[1:20:10] the church in order that's a big freeze
[1:20:15] right there to keep the church in order
[1:20:18] that's working in all all of those
[1:20:22] ministerial offices it's God caring for
[1:20:26] his work sometimes the order it isn't
[1:20:32] that somebody got out of order they
[1:20:33] spoke on they shouldn't be spoke
[1:20:34] sometimes beginning out of order is they
[1:20:37] get to looking at the world and
[1:20:44] everybody else marching over here they
[1:20:49] get their eyes on the wrong face but God
[1:20:54] is faithful he'll come down and shake it
[1:20:59] and say get back and step thank God for
[1:21:05] that friends I believe that I believe
[1:21:08] also that the church is ruled over by
[1:21:11] men that God's sins to take charge whoa
[1:21:16] some big words there to take charge you
[1:21:23] you heard the phrase you can't have too
[1:21:26] many cooks in the kitchen no more salt
[1:21:30] here no let's cayenne pepper there no
[1:21:32] need a little bit more pepper there no a
[1:21:34] little bit more so now that nothing gets
[1:21:36] done there's got to be order
[1:21:44] or you sit around let's do this let's do
[1:21:46] that let's do this let's do that let's
[1:21:48] do this
[1:21:48] let's do that how about let's get home
[1:21:50] and get to bed cuz we done spent all
[1:21:52] this time saying let's do this let's do
[1:21:53] that let's do this let's do that let's
[1:21:55] do this Golic where you want to go
[1:21:58] anyone go yeah no matter me we're not
[1:22:01] going well let's go here no I don't
[1:22:03] wanna go there
[1:22:07] that's not my wife that's me I really
[1:22:13] don't care as long as in this god sends
[1:22:24] them to take charge somebody gotta make
[1:22:28] decisions I said somebody's gotta make
[1:22:32] decisions I'm making decisions isn't
[1:22:34] always popular let's say me how come why
[1:22:38] don't we just take a vote on everything
[1:22:45] because this is a theocracy
[1:22:52] why don't we just can you imagine what
[1:22:54] that would be like more that's another
[1:22:55] one but that rule is by the word so that
[1:23:06] it is not men really ruling but the
[1:23:10] Spirit of God for the word and spirit
[1:23:14] are one remember them this is a verse
[1:23:19] right before Hebrews 13:8 better maybe
[1:23:23] we forgot it remember them which have
[1:23:25] the rule over you who have spoken unto
[1:23:28] you the Word of God notice how it's
[1:23:30] followed who have spoken unto you the
[1:23:32] Word of God whose faith follow faith
[1:23:38] that revealed substance that revealed
[1:23:41] that's that follow that you know that's
[1:23:44] a great achievement is for God to get
[1:23:47] one mortal to believe another brother
[1:23:49] Bram called it the hardest thing that
[1:23:50] God's ever had to do that takes the
[1:23:55] grace of God for for for a person to be
[1:23:58] able to look beyond the flesh I'm glad
[1:24:02] for God's mercy because even it's
[1:24:04] sometimes were sometimes and I that's
[1:24:06] just brother Samuel but that's just this
[1:24:07] God will bring somebody else in and here
[1:24:10] they things they begin to address and to
[1:24:12] deal then you know you know that ain't
[1:24:14] brother Samuel it wasn't him anyhow but
[1:24:17] then you know that's God's grace whose
[1:24:23] faith follow God did not give us
[1:24:28] leadership for us to turn around and
[1:24:31] follow her himself true I mean can you
[1:24:38] imagine a platoon showing up to the
[1:24:40] battle here the sergeant shows up and we
[1:24:44] go into the battle and everybody going
[1:24:45] their own way wonder what are you guys
[1:24:49] going yeah we think you'd be better over
[1:24:52] here our position be better over here at
[1:24:55] the enemy this group says this over here
[1:24:57] pretty soon you know what we're not one
[1:24:59] were divided
[1:25:02] before division ever shows itself
[1:25:06] physically if first happened spiritually
[1:25:14] so you find what happened instead of
[1:25:17] them doing it God's Way the Bremen goes
[1:25:21] into talking about this they saw
[1:25:22] something they saw that the church that
[1:25:25] leadership they could see these
[1:25:27] scriptures that we are reading from you
[1:25:29] tonight they could see those scriptures
[1:25:31] but they were trying to institute it in
[1:25:35] their own strength they were taking
[1:25:41] scriptures without them spiritually
[1:25:43] being revealed and without themselves
[1:25:46] having a real experience from God
[1:25:47] because they had a desire for
[1:25:50] preeminence they were making bishops
[1:25:54] over this one and they were taking and
[1:25:56] not having an understanding they were
[1:25:58] putting men to rule over men that's
[1:26:04] man's idea he didn't leave it the way
[1:26:07] God intended remember God does not
[1:26:09] choose men that men think are fit Samuel
[1:26:14] went to a night you know the first the
[1:26:17] eldest one of Jesse Shirley this is
[1:26:20] God's anointed nope
[1:26:22] that's why nope
[1:26:27] Sheree nope
[1:26:33] finally he gets through all seven and
[1:26:35] says do you have one more because none
[1:26:39] of these are the one that God sent me
[1:26:41] here for God don't make a mistake when
[1:26:48] he sends a prophet with a message
[1:26:51] somebody is gonna be anointed somebody's
[1:26:58] gonna be anointed they may not be on the
[1:27:01] scene right then but brother they're
[1:27:03] going to become on the scene that word
[1:27:05] is gonna bring them on the scene here
[1:27:10] came a ready little guy poured out the
[1:27:14] anointing oil appalling that was God's
[1:27:16] choice hallelujah it was God's Way this
[1:27:26] is what brother Branham tells us he says
[1:27:29] that the businessmen they have said
[1:27:33] Ephesians 4 has failed and he says they
[1:27:37] have invaded the pulpit without a call
[1:27:41] from God they've invaded it not God
[1:27:46] called him to it they invaded it because
[1:27:52] they believe that it's failed but
[1:27:53] remember let me just say this very
[1:27:55] clearly it's true there's been a lot of
[1:27:59] failure there's been pastors that's
[1:28:03] fallen Vangelis men go on down the line
[1:28:08] but there's been a lot of people that's
[1:28:10] fail too sometimes you deal with people
[1:28:15] in central Samuel you don't know well
[1:28:18] not you know this or this pastor or this
[1:28:21] or that
[1:28:23] I don't know if I can never trust
[1:28:26] another pastor that's the mistake you
[1:28:28] trusted a pastor you need to trust God
[1:28:33] that's the one who gave that word and
[1:28:37] like John I've turned to see the voice
[1:28:40] that spake unto me
[1:28:46] got to know that personally there's a
[1:28:51] lot of doctors that have fought have
[1:28:53] failed they made mistakes come on
[1:28:56] breathe
[1:28:57] you see we got to come back to man did
[1:29:01] not give that word
[1:29:02] we got him say devil I don't need your
[1:29:05] excuses
[1:29:08] is this a healer isn't he a healer you
[1:29:13] say that's an emotional healing he's
[1:29:15] still a healer he heals the emotional
[1:29:19] scars and lives hallelujah so that we
[1:29:26] can have a confidence in his word but
[1:29:30] you see one on that did it's separated
[1:29:32] the people but what separating them from
[1:29:36] the life this one's over this one and
[1:29:38] this one's over this one and this one's
[1:29:40] over this one it's all three minutes of
[1:29:42] man when so contrary to how the
[1:29:46] scripture says that were one body one
[1:29:50] spirit and that all within this body are
[1:29:54] to be moved upon by the Holy Ghost
[1:29:58] everyone is to participate in worship
[1:30:02] I'm not just talking about one you were
[1:30:04] sitting here in these pews everyone is
[1:30:07] to participate in worship you know you
[1:30:09] worship God even as brother Brent tells
[1:30:11] us in the Hebrew series when you see
[1:30:12] that person in the store and you say
[1:30:14] Matt Hossack the Lord blessed us with a
[1:30:17] beautiful day that's testifying
[1:30:21] that's why shipping was the things not
[1:30:24] just when the song or when the word but
[1:30:27] there's a last ship that comes out of
[1:30:29] our lives but see it then just began to
[1:30:35] be just a succession from one to another
[1:30:37] so there's differences in administration
[1:30:44] this is what Paul when Paul would would
[1:30:47] set this forth remember Paul would
[1:30:49] declare to them that that I'm a mist I'm
[1:30:53] the minister unto the Gentiles he wasn't
[1:30:55] puffing himself up but he was reminding
[1:30:57] them in Romans 15 the commission that
[1:31:00] God has given me to the Gentile church
[1:31:02] remember Peter Peter would speak this at
[1:31:05] the end of 2nd Peter and he would talk
[1:31:07] about some who were looking at what Paul
[1:31:09] was preaching and Peter said they're
[1:31:13] already unstable in their lives and
[1:31:16] they're wrestling with what Paul is
[1:31:20] saying and he says they wrestle to their
[1:31:24] own destruction oh what a blessing it is
[1:31:28] to believe it's a blessing to believe
[1:31:35] don't understand everything No
[1:31:40] but it's a blessing to believe to know
[1:31:44] Jesus Christ is the absolute he's been
[1:31:50] revealed to my heart he sent a message
[1:31:54] in this hour he has taken the seals from
[1:31:57] off the book he has spoken in this hour
[1:32:03] and that same voice is writing that
[1:32:07] trail again hallelujah the same light it
[1:32:13] stabilizes us in this hour there's
[1:32:18] differences in administration
[1:32:21] differences within that but it's the
[1:32:25] same Lord all the way through brother
[1:32:31] Branham when they would speak of this
[1:32:33] here and taking sides with Jesus he says
[1:32:36] it's just like in the army you've got to
[1:32:39] have one that's a general that's the
[1:32:42] headquarters captain's the captain says
[1:32:46] this I speaking to a group of ministers
[1:32:48] here in this meeting he's the captain of
[1:32:51] that group but then the general can
[1:32:53] change his orders and the chief
[1:32:56] commanding general of course is Jesus
[1:32:59] Christ in the church
[1:33:02] brother Brown never made himself the
[1:33:04] chief General however however when the
[1:33:08] bride is going in preview he's right
[1:33:10] there on the stand are you with me
[1:33:13] because listen why because it was Jesus
[1:33:17] Christ revealed through the ministry of
[1:33:19] this hour reveal what in the body that's
[1:33:26] why the Prophet could say he has come in
[1:33:28] our flesh and his ministers are his
[1:33:34] captains of the companies that's
[1:33:36] representing him here on
[1:33:41] now you've recognized you I've read
[1:33:46] these scriptures to you before we're
[1:33:48] talks of the bride in the Song of
[1:33:51] Solomon and it speaks of her not to let
[1:33:54] me just refer just to verse 10 if I
[1:33:57] could who is she that looked at forth as
[1:33:59] the morning fair as the moon clear as
[1:34:03] the Sun and terrible as an army with
[1:34:07] banners these banners are a standard the
[1:34:12] other scriptures that are right there in
[1:34:14] Song of Solomon chapter 6 she is lovely
[1:34:17] she is the Dove she is the undefiled and
[1:34:20] she's the choice one he's talking about
[1:34:22] the bride
[1:34:23] but then he goes and expresses it she's
[1:34:26] terrible that means awesome dreadful as
[1:34:30] an army with banners she's lovely she's
[1:34:34] delicate but she'll stand for that word
[1:34:40] don't you mistake her loveliness as
[1:34:43] though she's a pushover no it's him
[1:34:46] motivating her you're not gonna lay a
[1:34:50] charge on her husband these banners are
[1:34:56] standards standards that part of the
[1:35:00] word of the Lord the season that we're
[1:35:03] living in the administration of the
[1:35:05] gospel like the Bible says when the
[1:35:06] enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit
[1:35:08] of the Lord shall raise a standard
[1:35:11] against it you see the body of Jesus
[1:35:15] Christ it's fortified by himself look at
[1:35:19] this protection that's here I'm coming
[1:35:21] down it's a protection this word being
[1:35:26] in the body wrapped up in the believer
[1:35:29] where the Holy Ghost is the leader of
[1:35:31] the church remember brother Branham kind
[1:35:35] of dramatized like this he says I gave
[1:35:37] it to Eve and she let down on it you
[1:35:40] said but I'm coming myself I'm coming to
[1:35:43] do the job and I'm gonna come in my
[1:35:46] people
[1:35:48] I'm gonna come wrapped in them and this
[1:35:52] is why God is present in his army we're
[1:35:57] not on a picnic we're on a battlefield
[1:35:59] they're not only our rights that
[1:36:03] belonged to us as believers but there's
[1:36:07] other sons and daughters of God that
[1:36:10] don't know their sons and daughters of
[1:36:12] God there's others that don't know
[1:36:15] Liberty has come you don't have to be
[1:36:19] subservient to the enemy any longer
[1:36:25] it's an army that goes to battle Oh
[1:36:29] glory this is why brother Brian would
[1:36:33] say God is fortified in his army what
[1:36:37] with himself in the form of prophets
[1:36:43] apostles teachers pastors what did he do
[1:36:48] what was God doing listen did you ever
[1:36:51] think what the officers of the church is
[1:36:54] it's God's dress inside dress the world
[1:37:03] don't see that dress it's an inside
[1:37:06] dress it's something that is specially
[1:37:11] revealing to us as a believer you know
[1:37:17] listen just as much as it's God's inside
[1:37:19] dress for a prophet to recognize
[1:37:21] carrying the message for this age it's
[1:37:23] also God's inside dress to recognize the
[1:37:26] Apostles it's God's inside dress to
[1:37:31] recognize who your pastor is
[1:37:38] who them who that the missionary was
[1:37:40] apostles evangelist what is it is to
[1:37:43] recognize him him speaking see we're
[1:37:50] we're in a day when things are just like
[1:37:52] sera sera what are you doing I'm just
[1:37:56] floating along no no you get established
[1:37:59] I turned to see the voice that spake to
[1:38:03] me God an apostle a prophet a seer four
[1:38:11] seas before Satan ever gets to it done
[1:38:13] told it and now awesome how many's a
[1:38:15] witness to that the God will come right
[1:38:18] down and he already calls out that the
[1:38:21] enemies coming this way
[1:38:22] and it prepares us ahead of time what is
[1:38:26] that God fortified in his body Oh glory
[1:38:31] be to God God dressed up in his church
[1:38:34] these offices is God's dress where he's
[1:38:40] clothed is that right the Roman soldiers
[1:38:45] stripped him that system stripped him of
[1:38:50] his dress where come on they stripped
[1:38:54] him and crucified Him but here he come
[1:38:57] in as dressed up in his church his bride
[1:39:03] don't crucify him she has on that wear
[1:39:07] that ring with a diamond she receives
[1:39:10] every gift that he has she put it on in
[1:39:16] a museum for people to come by and look
[1:39:18] at no sack she's wearing it when you see
[1:39:22] these officers pastors teachers
[1:39:24] evangelists what is it
[1:39:25] that's God's dress work it's God's
[1:39:27] present his presence is Spirit working
[1:39:30] through man
[1:39:32] any office design denies that it's not
[1:39:36] of God
[1:39:38] anything denies that word not of God but
[1:39:41] if it speaks with the word we said haha
[1:39:43] I know him who's speaking he might have
[1:39:48] a different complexion he might be
[1:39:49] shorter he might be fatter he might be
[1:39:51] skinnier it don't matter it's him
[1:39:54] it's Jesus that I really want to see
[1:40:00] it's God protecting his work he's
[1:40:05] watching over it this is why he has the
[1:40:07] offices set in the body this is why
[1:40:11] he'll take a man and the man he doesn't
[1:40:14] know why am I going this route why am I
[1:40:17] going that round God knows you come to
[1:40:20] the only thing you come to a place after
[1:40:22] years of ministry you finally you come
[1:40:24] to the rest God knows what he's doing
[1:40:27] gun knows what he's doing
[1:40:29] there's something that God is doing this
[1:40:34] is why brother Branham in clothes he
[1:40:37] brings it and he types the work of the
[1:40:40] ministry as those four Chairman's
[1:40:45] anointing Chairman's that are gathered
[1:40:48] around the ark which is the acts of the
[1:40:53] Holy Spirit in the body
[1:40:58] he said you've got the Evangelist the
[1:41:01] Prophet the Eagle they fly you know the
[1:41:05] Prophet flies and sees things way off
[1:41:08] evangelist will fly from here and land
[1:41:10] here fly from here land here flat from
[1:41:12] here land here sometimes not all but
[1:41:18] sometimes the way that some evangelists
[1:41:20] are gifted sometimes they don't get they
[1:41:27] don't get credit for what God has really
[1:41:29] revealed to us because them here it
[1:41:34] looks like when they get done with it
[1:41:35] with with a sermon you you you got the
[1:41:38] font but it looks like they've been here
[1:41:39] they've been here they've been here
[1:41:41] they've been here they've been here you
[1:41:45] know why that's how God has directed
[1:41:47] them to go then you take others maybe
[1:41:51] standing as an evangelist maybe they're
[1:41:53] just working and doing the work of an
[1:41:55] evangelist but the the way the things
[1:41:57] will move right down through the word
[1:41:59] and you see it just being moved in that
[1:42:02] way
[1:42:02] see it's God working it's why there's
[1:42:05] diversity even in every gift every
[1:42:08] pastor is not the same every teacher is
[1:42:11] not the same apostles are not the same
[1:42:14] they're not all the same God has gifted
[1:42:17] each one in a special way and he wants
[1:42:21] that person to be who God made him
[1:42:26] that's the same for each of us
[1:42:31] no wonder Paul could tell Timothy
[1:42:33] despise not that youth but be thou an
[1:42:37] example these four anointings that are
[1:42:41] gathered around here
[1:42:43] remember these 490 they don't contradict
[1:42:45] one another the Bible says when one
[1:42:48] moved they all move they're all looking
[1:42:51] the same way lion comes out and roars
[1:42:56] like the Apostle moving into a new area
[1:42:59] roars out then you you find that here
[1:43:04] then comes the ox kind of standing in
[1:43:10] one place for an hour pasture one thing
[1:43:15] about a pasture he don't he don't fly
[1:43:16] like an eagle for feet on the ground and
[1:43:26] he stands
[1:43:26] he's ox or the team doesn't move very
[1:43:28] fast but think of it brother Brown says
[1:43:34] there each one guarding he said that
[1:43:36] teacher he's a shrewd man he can take
[1:43:40] that word and take bits and drop that
[1:43:41] here what's gone doing it's God
[1:43:43] protecting his work I tell you I pray
[1:43:49] that God through this time there was
[1:43:51] we're looking at this not that we're not
[1:43:53] but I pray they say God let me have one
[1:43:58] thing let me I don't want my eyes on any
[1:44:01] man it's not that we're not to have
[1:44:04] confidence you should have confidence
[1:44:05] and but that confidence ought to come in
[1:44:08] your heart from God identifying himself
[1:44:12] that's what our confidence should be in
[1:44:15] but to say God let me just get my eyes
[1:44:19] so on you so whatever vessel you're
[1:44:22] going to use let me just be on it let me
[1:44:26] say this to you every ministry grows
[1:44:31] well I heard this man say this year I
[1:44:33] heard this don't put him in a picture
[1:44:36] frame don't put him in a picture frame
[1:44:40] there's things where ministers have come
[1:44:42] and stood right here and there's certain
[1:44:44] things I didn't get it behind him and go
[1:44:45] through and start correcting things
[1:44:47] maybe a service or two later I start
[1:44:49] bringing it in right through the message
[1:44:51] but I don't come back and say this
[1:44:53] brother said this but this is what the
[1:44:54] Prophet says I don't want to destroy
[1:44:56] that brothers influence because the same
[1:44:59] God who reveals it to me is the same God
[1:45:01] to reveal it to them because God might
[1:45:04] use that man at some point in time to
[1:45:06] help you in your walk and if you tear
[1:45:08] him down how can you have confidence
[1:45:11] this is why just for every one of our
[1:45:14] lives don't put people in picture frames
[1:45:19] you've seen a picture of me when I was
[1:45:21] you know in fifth grade I was a chubby
[1:45:23] fat little kid had poofy hair on my head
[1:45:26] I'm well I was still a little chubby but
[1:45:31] I don't have poofy hair on my head
[1:45:33] things changed that's the same way it is
[1:45:38] for every one of us may God help us to
[1:45:40] have grace for one another
[1:45:42] Oh blessed be his name your loving
[1:45:51] aren't you grateful for the gifts of the
[1:45:54] mighty Conqueror his love expressed to
[1:45:58] us every one of our lives we've received
[1:46:00] for every one of us the gift of God the
[1:46:06] Holy Spirit if you've not tonight it's
[1:46:08] for you I said it's for you
[1:46:11] it's for you let's bow our heads in
[1:46:14] prayer

[1:46:36] these things and lord I realize for some
[1:46:39] of us Lord it could be a review and
[1:46:41] looking back at it but Lord we're not
[1:46:43] just coming through things as reviewing
[1:46:45] I've come to see it Lord over the years
[1:46:48] where many of these things Lord if we
[1:46:50] can really understand Lord what it is
[1:46:53] and be able to yield our hearts to it
[1:46:56] your God then you're able to really
[1:46:58] minister to us in these channels Lord

[1:47:05] body Lord may you guide us Lloyd guide
[1:47:09] us as an assembly Lord direct me Lord as

[1:47:23] Lord I ran from it Lord when my dad
[1:47:26] would begin to bring it up Lord I'd run
[1:47:29] I wouldn't even stay at the home I got
[1:47:31] to where I just walk out of his house

[1:47:57] you take in that gift of a pastor you
[1:48:00] placed in my life
[1:48:03] realizing the Lord is your prophet would
[1:48:05] tell us we can see it in the scripture
[1:48:06] eventually there can be no man can have
[1:48:08] more than one gift in his life but Lord
[1:48:15] may we all take from this tonight and in
[1:48:20] these services its you working and
[1:48:24] directing and leading us and it's you
[1:48:27] being reflected in our lives Lord as you
[1:48:30] spoke to us over and over our lives it's
[1:48:33] more than just messages that are
[1:48:35] preached from this pulpit across the
[1:48:38] sacred desk Our Lives preaches sermons
[1:48:43] the place we're going to work our lives
[1:48:45] preach O God may we be faithful
[1:48:51] witnesses that are reflecting Jesus
[1:48:56] Christ the people Lord they Oh Minh
[1:49:01] quote a Bible all they could get drawn
[1:49:04] up may we recognize it's not something
[1:49:09] we have to quote it's who we are
[1:49:14] give us wisdom Lord to be wise as a
[1:49:18] serpent and harmless as a death because
[1:49:22] Lord were we're after souls for your
[1:49:25] kingdom it doesn't for us it doesn't
[1:49:29] matter where they go to church because
[1:49:31] there's only one church
[1:49:34] it that's not our objective our
[1:49:36] objective is that people get to Jesus
[1:49:37] Christ the same one who has changed and
[1:49:41] transformed our lives that same Liberty
[1:49:46] that has come to us that's what moves to
[1:49:48] our our lives that's what moves are upon
[1:49:50] our hearts for our families our loved
[1:49:52] ones our children
[1:49:54] Oh God for our co-workers for our
[1:49:57] neighbors friends

[1:50:16] and consideration
[1:50:19] may we be Jesus to them Lord
[1:50:23] Oh God
[1:50:28] help us Lord
[1:50:29] [Music]
[1:50:31] may it be as we read here in the
[1:50:33] scriptures it's you that they see not us
[1:50:40] not not believers spoken word Tabernacle
[1:50:44] this church can't change nobody as a man
[1:50:48] I can't change nobody people can come
[1:50:51] hear the preaching of the word the Lord
[1:50:56] unless their eyes and their faith gets
[1:50:59] placed in you then Lord and miss it but
[1:51:05] I ask God for grace that maybe for some
[1:51:11] Lord that it's been misplaced they've
[1:51:13] regarded just coming to this church if
[1:51:17] there be anything or any that just would
[1:51:20] say just to be associated around the
[1:51:23] message and believe their brother
[1:51:24] branham's our prophet or just for them
[1:51:27] to say but the same you're my pastor cut
[1:51:30] me they recognize and it's not that's
[1:51:32] not a title we're not it when there's

[1:51:41] have a personal contact with you you're
[1:51:46] the one who changed their life
[1:51:49] [Music]
[1:51:54] I could so transform them into a new
[1:51:59] creation in Christ Jesus what their mind
[1:52:05] cannot even conceive because that carnal
[1:52:10] mind is enmity against God but that
[1:52:13] heart can believe and say God I believe
[1:52:18] it's for me Alvar right every doubt and
[1:52:23] unbelief come change me Lord come change
