brother randy the church of lorraine god bless you amen and the visitors we have here with us god bless you amen amen and uh just brother brother benny perry it's first time for him being here with us and uh i believe we're in for a great blessing amen you know god has such a great diversity of gifts in the body and you know the gifts of how god has so placed it there it's a compliment one to another and it's how god just works in such a in such a way and it's such a beautiful thing and so we just in all no matter no matter what gift that god uses no matter evangelist pastor whatever he's going to use tonight we want to be sure that we see him amen we want to be sure that we see him and go beyond the veil that's standing here because god will use the veil to speak to our hearts amen and i believe that tonight i just want to also greet the church brother and sister cress that asked me to greet you when i was speaking to him the other day you know they're still recovering and getting stronger day by day and just asked that we would just they wanted to say thank you for all the prayers different ones the cards and the calls that had come out and uh so we they wanted to ask where the crest asked if i would just extend that to you as well i also want to ask as a congregation here that this coming sunday in the philippines there at uh the church of the overcomer where brother roel soriano was pastor and you know he went on home to be with the lord they're going to have a voting for a pastor and i'm just going to ask you just to be very much in prayer for that that's just that's where i'll leave it and i'll just ask you to be very much in prayer and just ask the lord that god would just have his way amen because there's nothing that's too great for god you know we we know that that prayer prayer it moves it'll move the hand of god and god he awaits on us he'll show us what is taking place but then he waits on us to ask him according to what he's showing us amen so we just ask you to be in prayer and as we invite brother benny just to go ahead and come i want to give him just just full time here tonight and i told him i said you just take your liberty you just act like you're at home amen because no even though i know it's a little bit cooler than what it is in south carolina you know but you know anyhow it's uh we we just we have the same the same holy spirit the same message amen the same lord jesus christ so we just we just pull ourselves up under the table and just say lord you be the same lord jesus so whatever our whatever your need is tonight and you hear me say this very often but it's very true whatever your need is tonight no matter what god has placed upon brother benny's heart god can will take and direct that gift if you'll just pull on the gift just be praying in your heart god will come and he'll speak directly to whatever your need is here tonight that's how mindful he is amen we believe that don't we amen let's just we'll sing that as brother benny will make his way on up to just minister the word of the lord and i mean i'm i'm really hungry i'm interested i want to just i want to receive from god amen hallelujah let's sing that little song i don't know the title of it but a woman tried so many physicians yep amen touching jesus that's why i have these guys they remember the songs i know what i want to sing but a woman tried so many positions [Music] yet crew were soul to jesus she came and went the crowd oh they try to restrain her [Music] [Music] touching jesus that's all that really matters amen that's here tonight and your life will never be the same for there is only only one way to touch him just believe when you call on his name anybody a witness here to this i was bound when i knelt at the altar oh but they said jesus he could meet all my needs and when this prisoner finally touched jesus here's the testimony he set me free praise god free indeed [Music] touching jesus is [Music] the and there's only one way to touch [Music] all right man god bless you it's good to be in the house of the lord amen jesus said what two or three are gathered together in his name theirs here in the midst so i believe that god is with us tonight amen i want you to thank the lord for your pastor first time meeting giving us this opportunity to speak to you but there's a deep calling to the deed there's a kindred spirit my spirit bear witness with his spirit his spirit bear witness with my spirit that we are sons of god praise god and the bride said amen god bless you i think brother randy was going to be here was with him the other night brother randy god bless you good to have you appreciate family treat us so well and we thank god for it's good to have my wife with me sister ruth here praise the lord and that's pastor and his wife pastor turner he's from south carolina appreciate him driving with me sister nicky and brother obviously i call you brother isaac they said the bible studies last night i thank god for you being here and i just pray that we could say something that will that will help us get closer to god and we had a good time last night and i think i want to if you will stand with me on a reading of the word and we're going to get right to it praise god and we're so thankful i like to read i have three pastor scriptures and one will read from the book job chapter 32 and let's start at verse 8 and we'll go to the book of job chapter 40. it says but there is a spirit in man and the inspiration of the almighty give give it them understanding i don't want to make emphasis on that again but there is a spirit in man and the inspiration of the almighty giveth them understanding and let's go down and the prophet preached the message you'll be very familiar with it when i get to chapter 42 the message i've heard but now i see and i like to read verse 42 two through five and i like what job said here he said i know that thou could do everything and that no thoughts can be withheld from thee who is he that hides counsel without knowledge therefore have i uttered that i understood not things too wonderful for me which i know knew not here i received thee and i will speak i will demand of thee and declare thou unto me i've heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now my icd let's pray heavenly father we thank you for blessing us to come together we know you're here lord and i pray god that you would heal the sick cast out devils set the captives free renew our vision lord we're not just here just to have a church service lord but we know that your word shall not go out void it will accomplish what you send it out to do touch lives change lives lord because we need you and without you we can do nothing lord any man can turn the pages of the bible but it takes you to interpret the word father we come to you now in jesus christ's name amen god bless you i like to take my thought from the mess you may be seated i want to call this here a channel communication that moves you into the inspiration of god here the prophet says here he said he had a channel of communication to god that he got by inspiration he had a way of moving himself out and letting god move in and he knew know that he knew that he was justified it was a gift it is a gift it says like uh it don't have to be a prophet or that was a divine gift or to serve god's people with everybody is not ordered to be a prophet everybody's not ordered you know to be uh praying for the sick but all of them is not ordered to be pastors and so forth but a channel that god has opened to them that's talking about us that's talking about each one of us god is open to us a channel of communication where we should get in and get in contact with god we heard of him all we heard of him and we talk about him but you have a channel of communication by inspiration now what what what moses what what brother branham was saying here is one thing i want to emphasize in this here he says that the inspiration and there's a channel of communication many of us are familiar with channels you have an am channel you have an fm channel you have cv channel you have a different kind of channels and all the channels if you want an am station you don't go on the fm to get to a.m you got you got different cell towers and phones each of those channels direct you to a certain thing that you are in other words you can't get on the cb trying to use your cell phone it is a different channel and oh let church say amen i'm gonna tell you something and you can get on the baptist channel expecting to be able to receive a bride revelation right all at church amen how you know how how many know that glory the chant of inspiration that was opened up to the bride it's the message of the house and that gives us communications that give us communication by the inspiration of that message to be able to come in contact with god hallelujah you know i was thinking about the welsh revival and down in the wells you know they had a great revival and they were sending people from america but the odds they wanted to know why is everybody going to wales what's going on and we was in america you know we supposed to be the religious center of the world but anyway they was having the west revival and so what they done they sent some dignitaries from america over there into wales to find out about the world's revival they want to know what was going on so they sent the uh the dignitaries different from different places and they got the got to go on driving trying to figure out what a rock whale's revival was and they ran across a police officer and while they drove up to him and said sir can you tell us where the welsh revival is and he was out there working twirling his stick and having a good time he said listen you don't have to go no further you have you are looking at it you're right you're looking at it you're part of can you tell me where the bride's revival is you are looking at it the word is in the bride you have a spirit of communication by inspiration hallelujah glory do you believe that you you and i god has opened a channel a lot of people say oh i'm just in the message no the challenge is open to you to get so close to god you can even be like god because he said if you abide in me and my words abide in you that's what you will and it shall be done unto you the channel of the inspiration for communication with god has been opened up to the bride and listen bride this is your day this is your hour this is your time this is for you good god did this for you and you know no matter what goes on but town of the channel that's open for the inspiration how many know glory uh job was inspired do you believe that joe everything was going wrong you know that his children was lost and what i mean by that is under the fire things were going wrong the devil was fighting him doing everything he could to stop job and look like glory got to a place his wife would have felt sympathy for him he got balls all over his body sometimes we look at people that have sympathy for us but let me tell you god have more sympathy than any man in the world of course it don't matter how much god loves you bro brother brown says it like this god is concerned about you he's concerned about your children he's concerned about your job he's concerned about your work god is concerned about you and you know what he'll make sure god that heaven and earth will pass away but that word will not pass away and your wife said listen why don't you just curse god and die he said listen woman you sound like a foolish woman we all get all these blessings from god god that gave us this gave us all these children should not we can receive evil from god and he said look he didn't say you know he did go around oh the devil did this to me the devil did that to me the devil did don't get the devil no more credit than he deserves glory it was god glory god is the one god took his hand off and let the devil work with he said job whatever you do to him you can't touch his life that's right so he is on the inside of him that word so that's god's own life you're looking at the flesh but inside of him is deity if god is in his life go ahead let church say amen when you ever talk with god when you ever have a personal relationship with god when you meet him i don't care let the storms come let the winds blow let people walk away from you let them turn away brother you know glory the inspiration of the communication you have it keeps you right in line with god glory the word is in the bride glory do you believe that in the beginning in the beginning it wasn't the church in the beginning it wasn't what kind of denomination you belong to in the beginning was the word and the word was with god hallelujah one time david you know he was just kind of things were going bad in his life going wrong and one day just stood up and he said my god my god why have thou forsaken me and they were looking david what's wrong with david what's going wrong with him what's wrong with but see the inspiration of the channel that he had opened up glory he actually was saying what jesus was saying 700 years later he was he was feeling the effects of the message of this hour oh god electric i hope you feeling the effects of the message of that house what inspiration destruction inspiration sometimes inspiration comes at a time but it's peril things going wrong gloria there was a lady by the name of sister fanny crawford y'all know praise god everything was going right everything she touched she write a song it was i want to come would they call it platinum or it's god every time she wrote a song it was annoying and so the world wanted part of it always and they came and sent some people over sister fanny crawley they said look we can make you a millionaire you can be rich she said no i don't i don't want that i don't but you can be rich i can make a millionaire he says no we don't need i just love the lord jesus and they say say but you blind when you get over there you ain't gonna be able to see him no way and all of a sudden inspiration stuff she says i shall see him i shall see him if i can't see him i feel for the nail prints in his hand your inspiration of channel communication and let the devil know that you have a direct communication with god glory you and god become one yes sir that's right you and god are one the word is where it's in the bride amen the channel channel of communication channels are you know sometimes people want to get in contact with god but they don't go through the right challenge and then why why i got glory listen the lord ain't gonna do nothing come on he don't do nothing but he reveal his secrets to his servant the prophet the lion has roared who can but fear the lord i'm to say it like this the lord god has sent a message who can but prophesy in other words you got something to preach now glory notice sister had it right it's a true story she there she had some young boys she had a crippled sister and a lot of problems out there just hunting you know silver tip grizzly caribou 42 inches long she was she was in church when she went to church she was paying attention she know what she in other words she was looking to see god people hear about him and they talk about him but job said i want to see in other words i want to see the word manifested and so pleasure damn glory you know sometimes we at church say man my mind is it's going all over the place praise the lord they had a channel channel of inspiration so they was coming out coming back from the hunting trip to coming and this is a poor she was real poor she had didn't have harley had no money and and she had put 20 in church and the prophet was going to take it back to us she didn't make number two what 200 a year whatever something like that and while he's going back to take take the money back got it there they start talking about abraham he's jehovah jireh god can do this god can do that this the inspiration the inspiration was there brother he says and while i was there i killed a silver tip grinder with one shot she said brother branham that's nothing but the truth come on man inspiration dropped down guard to give her what she wants i don't care what she wants give it to her why what she has stuck the channel of inspiration and when she struck that channel god come down and say give her whatever she wants hallelujah she want a million dollars she can have it right whatever what i'm trying to say to you the inspiration that comes from the almighty places you into a channel of communication good is not my power nor by light but by my spirit said the lord and the headstone coming down crying grace grace grace not my power not by might it's the grace of god glory we have received a message of grace take advantage of this here open uh when he said the open word yes sir praise god you're in the channel glory listen you can tell when you're in a channel and you want to hear you know a certain kind of radio station gospel i'm going to hit a beat rock and roll you got to tune to that channel that's praise the lord martin mary you never was thinking laughter was sick they called for jesus that's right and jesus took a couple of days you know he didn't come he just waited while you know sometimes god don't come when people want him to well if he loved me he'd have been here he saw can i can i preach a little bit he see this code with 19 people getting sick people died going snakes don't die they go home but they don't die in the other way it's taking us from this earth to heaven god it's taking us from earth to glory but how god do it glory as i said the other night john had his head cut off different ones had peter was crucified upside down but what the way god do it you don't worry about it you just make sure you ready to go home [Applause] praise god my author said lord if you'd have been here my brother not died but she it didn't make no difference with her she had to hit that channel she knew he was the word so even now he's dead in the grave but even now whatever you ask god he'll do it amen and jesus tried to comfort him you know what he said say he arrives again glad she said gloria he'll rise again at the last day i know he'll rise again at the last day but i am the resurrection and the life he didn't believe in me though he was dead yet shall he live and do several living and believing in me shall never die believe this about it she said yes lord and the next question he said we have you ladies chant of inspiration sometimes you're inspired glory how many know this message is inspired i'm gonna give you one here so here's the secret pick up the pit and write the word is in the bride she will be like him for she is him as it near the headstone she will be him and this is prophecy is promised to you i don't care like i said it brother or brother randy's other people oh i quit the message i leave i did this people for i don't care what everybody said what they do it going but for me and my house for you and your house for me and my house we gonna serve the law no matter what everybody else do i'm not everybody else you're not everybody else you're the bride of jesus christ hallelujah that's been watched by the water of the world and coming here pre-destinated unto the adoption of sons will you make it glory already mate will you overcome yes sir y'all ready overcome somebody said well and then in the church him that overcometh to him that overcometh he talked about the overcomer you're overcome right what life brings on this earth it cannot stop you glory it may slow you down come on it may get you a little scary sometime be like the prophet glory he lost baby billy paul was sick he lost his wife glory and the devil said listen you praying for the sick that's right and the very sickness they died from going god let them die and you had people that you prayed for that was delivered and all you know how brother i'm very emotionally that cried and said you know getting all the said the devil said and he's saying he love you [Music] and he just started crying with it and all of a sudden he said something's inside of me somebody says satan get behind me why because the holy ghost come on the insider then that communication with god he knew god that he was the word you got to know who you are you may be a human being amen but you have a channel of communication that you move into when the time comes you say and the reason why you don't know you move into it because guess what it happened so fast gloria you don't know you've done the right thing and said the right thing it's always been that way you don't believe that what about isaiah that's right isaiah going along this time now listen it was not written on no pages he didn't have no evidence that he could go back like we said we could say isaiah said this look there's a virgin's conceived and we can go and find out that it happened isaiah didn't have that he was going along one day and then all of a sudden he got the pretty let's save all a lot of brothers around him that died go he said y'all guess what a burger shall concede isaiah now wait a minute ain't no there you can see but see he had a channel of communication with god and god could come through that channel and tell him something that seemed like it was it was crazy it's beyond the human mind but yet it was thus saith the lord 700 years yes sir you know what that happened when isaiah spoke it right didn't look like nothing happened and god just kept working is she here yet no 200 years went by is she here yet i'm just using this drummer time guards were waiting on the version he was waiting on a certain verse you say wait a minute well let me say it like brother brown said mary wasn't the only one it was many versions in that land many versions many of us did she wasn't the only one and as she got there all of a sudden one day she'd be probably coming to church here just like you and i we come to church to hear about the rapture changing the body one day you're going to come and you'll hear it for the last time you're going to be walking out the door all of a sudden one of those lights going to drop down and pick you up one of these days you believe that it's going to drop down and pick you up as it was in the days of noah as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man abraham had communication with god god said i can't hide from abraham what i'm getting ready to do abraham is a part of me listen and god didn't hide from the bride what he's about to do he revealed the secrets unto his servant the prophet and now he let you know listen you are the manifested word for the dead that you that communication that you have just don't put you the place to be a good church member no put you in a place to be part of god glory glory listen it don't matter how bad life is messed up ain't got nothing to do with it that's right the woman at the well brother branham goes over that over and over again what he wants you to see is if you're a daughter of god he don't care what kind of shape you hear he can take you out and make you what he wants you to be that's it the woman at the well her problem was she wanted somebody to love her so she finally found this guy you know he loved her a while and it wasn't good found the next guy he loved her the next she had five husbands and jesus said i must need to go to samaria amen well let me say i wonder what he said i must need to go through cleveland i wonder what he said i must need to go through uh south carolina so he went at church amen he went he went by the well and he sat on the well right there waiting on her he knew she was coming yes glory he wasn't worried about what kind of condition she was in cause god has the power to transcend god has the power to transform yeah praise god and when she got come up to came up there to the well to draw water and jesus said woman give me something to drink and the first thing she said y'all go y'all ain't gonna like this here but i'm gonna tell you anyway we like trump y'all like bye glory you know we know we samaritans and the jews don't have nothing to do with the samara don't get quiet on me y'all didn't know that was coming but it's the truth they were segregated we got this we got it but christians ain't selling segregated by one spirit are we all baptized into one body all of us got the holy ghost god ain't looking at green yellow black white purple god is looking at his word and people don't people don't know that but god is a god of variety he like pink roses he's like blue roses he's like red roses he's like gloria are you listening god don't want everybody looking like it like fat people like skinny people he like ugly people he like beauty people look all don't get quiet you might think you ugly but to god you're beautiful you might think that it's not i'm not i'm i'm too overweight but to guard you just the way he wants you to be glory he's so much worried about what people think and what people want instead of what god and she was trying to get somebody to love her glory and then she got there had five got five husbands she said you said give me a drink first things you want to you know the baptist don't have nothing to do with the jehovah witness you know the jews don't have nothing to do with samaritan yes but jesus said something said listen if you knew who was talking to you too many people come in the message they come here to pass the preacher they don't know who they who who talking to them oh don't get quiet pastor sitting up down there knowing it and they don't know who he taught oh that's brother brother last brother and they don't know who he's talking to when a man uh he listen brother brad said when a man come on the anointing of god he's omnipotent he'll walk out of it glory and walk back in it and the closest to god is the angel behind the poor people he's closer than the angel in heaven i told brother randy last night i believe quoting all the quotes everything he said if i read it glory you say don't understand he didn't tell me to understand it he said believe it only believe our messages only believe all things are political he didn't say only explain it if you can understand if you believe glory then you'll see the glory of god that's right glory yes sir she had five hooks and and jesus said you knew who was talking to you you would actually him living water and you have never had to come back to this well to draw no more uh you think god was playing with your mind he want to catch your gloria attention mean you come here every day drawing this water but i got some water that you don't have to do that praise god so in other words he he was letting her know that you satisfying the flesh you get this here get this water but i got something that you'll never thirst [Music] and she said told he said listen the woman said you talking about this living water the well is deep and you ain't got nothing to draw with in other words you come out here to draw some water and ask you for something to drink and you ain't even bring nothing to get no water with it come on but he did cause he was a whale of war sprang it up in the everlasting life he was the water that she needed to be drinking from clearing god and when she took when he said that there says uh oh i want some of this living water jesus said go call your husband let church say amen i want to say this here sometimes christian special message people get replaced oh they bad luck god know they bad god knows what's going wrong with everybody but god still called him all that i love i justify all that i call i sanctify god god knew her life was messed up that's why he came jesus christ came to do what he was a redeemer he put you in the pawnshop good and he wanted to buy you back he don't care what your life was when you met but he's concerned about what he can make your life to be yeah that's it that's right amen oh wait wait a minute you know sometimes we get in the message you know i'm betting so i ain't doing nothing wrong you were born in sin we forget to quit quote that sometimes shaping in a nickel did come in the world and the only one that happened isaiah couldn't do it moses couldn't do it there was none righteous no not one and god had to create his own body about it all you listen to god created on his own body where he could walk in that body live in that body it was it was the word was made flesh and god took that but why because glory he wanted that body to condemn sin in the flesh corey yes sir the word was made flesh he said i don't have a husband he said that's right but let me ask you something i'm gonna use this terminology he said i hang around the church and i hear about you know about prophet this prophet that and the campus and then preaching about the messiah gonna come and the messiah is gonna be here and says and i heard about that says uh now and when the messiah come he's gonna ask a lot of questions that we have yeah she said i got a problem when the messiah comes you say you ain't got to talk no more i'm the one that's speaking to you i am the messiah glory that's what god you mean to tell me she was caiaphas and all that he says no i am the messiah but the time is coming and now is that the true worshiper and listen it's still the same thing that david had changed the true worshiper will worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeking such to worship him glory yes sir channel inspiration amen glory when isaiah said the virgin shall conceive that word went right and it went and it traveled and it looked like it wasn't going to be fulfilled that's right god liked to take his time because nobody rushed that's right i think reverse god you can't make god do nothing lord some people think they can tell god who to save and who not to say oh don't get quiet they did too much to even be in church let's see it's god's choice god makes his decisions that's right amen that church say man we forget that sometime pray but it's god's calling the channel when that channel is open inspiration and while isaiah has spoken it's just floating around that word floyd you do you know what ain't nobody go brother brandon coming back here to speak about the rapture the rapture is still hanging up there it's waiting for the time the body change is still hanging in the air just waiting on the people to be ready praise god so he comes and said well i'ma have a body change look it's gonna come it's already been spoken one day you're gonna be going along that's right i'll talk to a denominational preacher today god blessed me said oh abraham and sarah i said god changed his body he's old it's too nothing too hard for god i say you don't need to be trying to explain it praise god glory so we got to talk a little bit said more than not too too hard for god god turned he know he said an old man an old woman had a baby god could make that's a no it's more than that go ahead not an old man he was a young man sarah was a beautiful princess god that was a secret to it god turned abraham and sarah back to a young man and a young woman right they couldn't repro receive the promised child oh ain't nothing too hard no it's not too hard for god but what did god do took old grandmama old granddaddy praise the lord about what you know we said we use the word in the south washed up hold on the life is finished and as they begin to god told abraham that him and sarah going to have us have the son he waited until they got to a place that they could not even have they didn't have no children to begin with and he got to a place that they would never have no children and then he says he come down and he talked to abraham and sarah was in the tent he said listen he said abraham but this time next year sarah will have that child gloria i like my brother brandon can i explain how he said yes sir he said god come down from heaven and he brought two angels with him took some light and some dust while the angels walking and said i'm just gonna dramatize what you gonna do lord god took the dirt and picked it up and dropped it on them and oh y'all believe in star trek don't you well you better believe in jesus he took the dust and put it on the tree and there was a human being an angel coming an angel now he's in cosmic light and dust is a human being and he's walking down there and god himself took on the human body and the brother brad said god always wanted to be a man he always wanted to be associated with a man and therefore those two angels when they got down there they went down there and abraham let the church say man i have to say this here when abraham seen those three angels he said my lord one he didn't see three nobody was better than station three he saw one and you're a genuine believer there ain't no trinity of god ain't no three gods you're a genuine believer you only see one god all that was in god reported in christ and all that was in christ he put it in the church going are you listening and when jesus was back there that's where he rebuked the scribes of the pharisees he rebuked him they said we have moses we have moses listen we have abraham talk about what they had and what's going on and jesus said listen when abraham was around me when abraham seen my decoy i could see inspiration striking him he was he was a fountain of all inspiration he was he was a god prophet praise god it was that he looked at it and said those jews said listen you know you you be a born of fornication how can you did abraham he said glory he said no i'm not i'm not born of fornication he said but you of your father the devil now i know he's mad now but listen he was the word and the word corrects all else and he said that said well it says uh before abraham it says he said when i seen abraham i said i see excuse me i've seen abraham come on with it and they say you ain't 50 years old all right glory brother he was looking at he was looking at the view he had seen abraham he he wasn't 30 33 31 32 years old and they said you've seen abraham you ain't yet 50 years old probably said what it was he looked 50 because of the stress of his ministry listen you ain't yet 50 years old how you seen abraham he said i could see him step back a little bit say before abraham was i am before abraham came in existed i am i am he that lived and was dead in the holy i'm alive forevermore and i have the keys of hell and death lord remember we have a channel yes sir it's not just a message oh i'm in the message you have a channel of communication to get to god i heard by the hearing of the ear but now i see him glory when the devil got job so down praise god his wife said won't you curse god and die yeah and job looked out the window he looked at the side he saw a tree die the next year come back he looking the neighbor died oh don't get quiet maybe the neighbor died of covert 19 they left and didn't come back oh see and he kept looking the tree come back next year and he asked god a question he said god do you care about a tree more than more than a man and all of a sudden inspiration struck job hallelujah when the inspiration stuck to god don't a skin worm destroy his body yet in my flesh i'm going to see god while inspiration in other words desperation took him from pity took him into the presence of god glory that's what they do you can be down in the dumps but let the inspiration strike i only believe who is this melchizedek i like that brother branson listen i'm gonna turn my back you tell me who this is what it's trying to do is get them to see that the manifested word will produce exactly what god said in the beginning what's the word i like that amen this same word whereby the gospel is preached to them and listen you say there's a man go that's what you that's that's fire and i know he was a man glory but you a man you're a woman and the same presence of god that was in that prophet is in you i just read where it says to hear he said you may not be a prophet you may not be this but god give you a channel of inspiration that you can move into it lord how do you believe the word because god manifested itself to you to make you believe the word glory hallelujah that's right and i am talking about the spoken word spoken word i was talking to brother of the days about spoken when when uh when that centurion when he came and jesus was casting out devils down the centurion he he didn't come there for no church service he came there because he was a roman soldier he had to watch jesus just didn't draw a few people he draw crowds hundreds of them so the centurion out there they said you make sure he don't cause no trouble you get out there and just watch everything what's going on and he was watching jesus and people come up jesus said you're healed cancer is gone glory he was praying for people that be healed and the centurion got a word back from his house one of his servants was at the point of death and listen glory jesus himself came to that man and said when he came to him when he came to jesus he says lord glory my servant is at the point of death will you heal him jesus said i will go he said oh no uh-uh i've been in church too long i've been watching this i've seen this sister i watch what's going on i see your word goes out and it don't come back forward when they go out and accomplish whatever you do he said lord just speak the word only and my servant will be made holy hallelujah and when he got back he was getting ready to go home it says yo servant was healed he didn't just stop there he said what time because listen the word is that accurate if it's one minute after it's got to be one minute after that's all right man that's how i anchored the word and you're not you're not you're not resting on us you're not resting on the church the one that died for you yes sir he's here i love you he wants to live in you amen he want to dwell in you god want to be a part of you gloria i was telling the brothers to enoch they said brother branham said that god wanted to use enoch as a type yeah that's right enoch walked with god right he walked so close to god gloria that one day he's seven man from adam how many know we did seven churches for that with the seven church age from the from paulding we the last one something's gonna happen pretty soon here's the secret the word is in the bride it's already here god and enoch glory walking walking and just that walking and god said if i don't take him home now he's so close he is he is so much like me i can't let him give away the secret there you go he wouldn't know what was in the 70s i got to take him home i think he was scrolling and just walking walking and literally no he started lifting up off the earth but why because he was ready the bride has made herself ready glory yes sir the word that you're hearing glory the preaching that you're hearing you're not feasting on the flesh of a man but you're feasting on the bleeding bloody word of the lord jesus christ hallelujah glory yes noah he didn't have a book to read he couldn't go to the spoken word book and prove to you that it was going to rain but he caught the inspiration god said no it's going to rain right and no one believed it that's right and when he caught the let church say amen let me let me tell you when he hit the channel the channel took gave him access to god when you hit the channel that gives you access to god amen inspiration comes glory are you listening inspiration comes from the almighty and the greek i don't want to get into it because i'm trying to do an evangelist sir but agree he said he breathed on them he moved him and when he breathed on them the holy the holy ghost god breathed on you and when you hold it the holy spirit come on you that's the same inspiration the same life that is in god is in you he told them listen if i don't go away if i don't go away i can't come to you i don't care they celebrate you know uh uh they celebrate martin luther king they can celebrate all they want ain't nobody else spirit can come in you you like basketball you can see jordan flying through there he didn't get the spirit in here that's right you had beethoven glory and all these things that were gone but one spirit that was coming here that's right gloria if he that believed that raise jesus christ from the dead if it dwell in you it will quicken your mortal body that same life that was in jesus christ can come in you nobody else can come in you come in you like that you might want to emulate somebody or follow somebody or look like somebody but you'll never be them but guess what you can be you can be him hallelujah matter of fact you can be exactly like him if he put his life in you his life in you is just as more powerful as it was himself that's right amen let me put it like this cory how many of you married praise god you know your wife get a check i don't know very few men they get to get kicked up over there when they have a check she wants he don't even have to put her name on it on the checkbook but she picked that check up she's just to have much is right to sign that check as he has you know why because day two they too have become worn you see that one glory you look like two fingers there's only one so yeah why you take my check why you take my glory because well you know how the sisters do what's mine is mine and what's yours in mine i see a lot of y'all brothers have that problem right gloria brother praise god but see we we we we've come to a place that all that was in god he poured it in christ and all that was in christ he put it in the church and what all that god is you are do you believe that gloria i remember one time gloria simeon how many to know in the bible said simon god told simeon he said listen you're not going to die all right people don't go to church long enough enough to stay in position to get the promise of god but simeon he had to stay in the church god said you're not going to die until you've seen the lord's christ and simeon come to church and be there can you imagine how many babies he had every eight days he had to look at you'd be confused all right baby come in there anoint the babies glory everyday jimmy come in there go ahead he's getting old and don't tell somebody something that's supernatural and they get a little you know you told me that god was going to give you this where it is go ahead i'm waiting on it sometimes you tell people god go do something something you just got to keep in mind that let god do it right that's right sidney probably said yeah you know you know how the priests get talking they got to see to say you know he spoke to me and told me i ain't going to die until i seen the lord's christ maybe he got sick and he was in the hospital a couple weeks ah i thought you told you you were he said i ain't dead and what do you do come back to the temple anointing babies knowing babies know it babies and one day this young couple came all right praise the lord and as they come to church glory because it was their custom they came to church and they had this little baby and i can imagine simeon that got old but he didn't forget what god told us you may get old but don't forget what god says some of us are going to be standing here when the rapture takes place and simeon he says my i feel good today all right man praise the lord sometimes you come to church you're not saying dude sometimes they come fire the pastor what's wrong i just feel something special going to happen today all right yeah glory lord make me happy now give me something i'm the church and i let the pastor help me i'm talking about inspiration looked and he just started feeling good and when mary and joseph walked in inspiration dropped on him he felt that knowing him god moved him to that channel and when he moved into that channel he's a lord now let your servant depart in peace for my eyes have seen your salvation how did he do it joy it was the inspiration he caught the channel and he moved right into it [Music] he moved by inspiration that's right let me just take the one when he out hunting uh in the snow snow storm yes sir right and while i was out there because he haunt many times and while he was out there in the colorado storm he's out there praise god and while he's out there you know just uh getting hunting and walking out there all of a sudden a storm come up a blizzard i know how he felt good when i came to cleveland praise god and the storm come and he's getting ready to run get ready to go and all of a sudden inspiration dropped and god says speak to the storm now you had to have a channel of communication because if he thought maybe this i just you know feel feeling good that oh god i'm gonna speak to something no he had a channel of inspiration and god said speak to the storm tell it to go back the sun come out within 15 minutes the snow smelled it off the storm left everything got back just like it was and he said let me hurry up and get out of here get ready to run and god said no come walk with me a while [Applause] he was there with god and god was right there with him and god wanted fellowship so if he had to stop the storm he'd have to do what he had to do in your life god when god wrote fellowship he wanted fellowship with his creation and you're part of god's creation i'm a part of god's creation you're a part of god's creation sometimes you have to do that to get fellowship amen glory listen you see all these prophets not just brother brandon but the prophets in the bible i learned i learned something about a crow a crow can carry a big chicken bone i'm telling you you think he can't he can carry a bone that big me and the brother was here coming out just come from uh miami florida from a revival i had to what one of my deacons to what it was sis paris one one of the deacons with his wife a couple of people and why was that that getting gas they had bought some chicken so i got so i don't know what i bought but it was no chicken but that's just the thing one of the brothers gave me a pretty she gave me a chicken leg i said let me have a piece of that chicken yeah said okay so as i was eating on the chicken a crow come down and flew i took a picture of him he flew right there wasn't but from here maybe to right there it was potato chips chewing gum candy and that crow was watching me eat my chicken and he just stood there and stood staring at the stared at my wife i'm looking at it and then i bit another piece he still said i'm thinking you know be scared go ahead and eat the chips and all the stuff on the ground he didn't eat that he stood there so i bit a couple bites off the chicken and i said hinger but i just threw it down and the crow come over there picked up the chicken he started eating it right there we watching me and my brother one of the brothers of my church watching eat the chicken and then a car got ready to come and i said what are you gonna do he picked that big chicken bone up and took it took it away flew off somewhere and i said i don't know maybe this is elijah somewhere but you know one thing we know gloria that a crow can carry food that's true i got it i took a picture of my phone and he said and and if god can now i'm doing a raving the glory to take care of profit what about god can do for you and it's covert 19 20 21-22 god can make sure he takes care of you yes sir glory fear not god has not given us the spirit of fear but a power and a love and a sound mind praise god glory jesus christ he's still the same in every form and every way he hasn't changed he's still the same yesterday today and forever do you believe that there's a channel of communication by inspiration now brother brandon was preaching this message and when he went to it what he was trying to find figured out you thought he was talking about job all the things that joe uh manifested in how god dealt with job but what the message is dealing with is how he had the communication the channel was open and what god was telling us is we have that same channel open to us sometimes inspiration you don't know why gloria you do something but isaiah virgin shall concede he didn't think about it right i got a few more of my notes here if you don't can i take a few more can i take a few more we think about like j like a uh joshua told joshua listen as i was with moses so shall i be with you no man to stand before you all your days be of good courage but let me say it like this stay with what moses said a lot of people have a problem because they don't stay with what the prophet said [Applause] that's right glory that's right and so joshua when he when he when when uh he walked out and this big man come in front of him had his sword drawed you know joshua didn't he probably would stop ringing back and i said you know what god told me no man stand before me all my days and when they the man had a sword draw joshua grabbed his sword and hit look up at the man like this are you boss before i have it sarah glory he wasn't afraid because he knew he had dust said the lord he had the word good but just because you have the word you got to have a strong arm of faith don't hold it right there with the devil go and cancel whatever it is you got to have faith to hold that word there and the man put his sword back he says no i'm the captain of the host in other words i'm the five-star general i come down the lead to see a church that y'all that i call you to do i come down and lead it to the promised land and joshua recognized that gloria god told him god so he in other words he wanted to make sure that joshua understood what his commission was so go down there and destroy ai that's right can you imagine sister nick he had a when god told joshua to go and destroy a.i he said i want it done listen god say i want it done today not tomorrow not next week and he started to fight the war was getting dark getting dark the kid was going how many can win a war in one day god said i want you to do it in a day today and josh was standing fighting the men fighting everybody fighting the sun start going down it's getting dark getting dark getting dark and brother you know be like some of us here lords will i'm a rex tonight we'll come back in the morning no not not god told joshua i want it done today and joshua didn't know what to do how could i get this finished today and he moved into the chapter of inspiration he said son stand still come on moon they go to valley as well and immediately stop and he fought and destroyed the enemy that day and the bible said never have god ever listen to a force of a man like he did that day but when god told you to do do something if you follow it he's going to back you up joshua moved into that channel of inspiration you know people want to be born again glory the holy ghost god more than able really want to give you the holy ghost glory yes sir all that church amen the holy ghost you know they said you know they got now the holy spirit well i mean the message is the holy spirit it's the holy ghost it'll make you act crazy to make you dance in the spirit make you shine whatever it makes you do whether it's a pig pen or a whatever god you just want the holy ghost you want god to come in on and be a part of it because it's god's own life listen john how many know the word of the lord come to the prophet and i'm closing what time is it praise the lord brother this is a true story i tell you i used to buy expensive watches and uh sometimes i get someone annoying that my watch quit never work again my wife would tell you got four or five of them like that so i stopped buying these 10 watches i'm serious i had a rolex the whole thing busted the this right here busted out of it wow glory don't believe god all that church say amen you thank you brother brandon a lot of things they had to know that he did the holy ghost you know because you you know you can't you got to hold that fire and you can't hold you can't hold it for so long the holy ghost inside of you and you're part of the word i don't know what it what different people things happen but that happened to me several times glory but i i like for the one thing i know that when god guarded heals and cast out devils and i had crippled people i don't have them i went to jail to tell the testimonies don't worry about that i just like to preach to god for going let the holy ghost go but many times crippled i got a brother in my church right now living with no the doctors he had a massive stroke you know him he don't even have no artery to take his blood to his brain but this message but this god but jesus christ still have him living still having i let him give you testimony he liked it he liked to tell it he was out they thought he wasn't going to make it and this is what he said and while he was in there he said his only thing he said lord he said all of a sudden he said jesus came in there and said you're going to be all right and he said what and he said he's out now he's out it came back a couple of days later but what gets me is this we were crying i was sad one of the deacons is his best friend he said he went and he turned his head said i can't see it no more blood it came all out of his mouth praise god we thought and i'm be honest i thought he wasn't gonna make it either but that was what god thought and so i said afterwards it's been a couple years now he's still going fine and so he went down the doctor to say hi in the world we need to get that vein to get that break and i said his name is joey i said brother joseph i said where you going to get the operation for i said if you're already kicking and you ain't got no nothing going up there don't let the doctors put nothing up there god god got something in there you need no operation you're still living so god can make god can make a way out of nowhere and the brother is living what you call that big bang go up there i forgot what you call it anyway what'd he call it yeah and he and he said brother i said hi in the world of god i said well let me tell you something i read in the message one time that there was a lady brother branham prayed for they didn't have a liver you can't live with no liver but i guess what if god get in there you can live with no liver no heart no nothing if god before you who can be against you god give us a chance of inspiration we're in that channel of inspiration in that channel you can touch god glory john as we close listen martha said something that i like brother branham said it like this she says martha when she first met jesus she complained about everything right she complained about this complaining about lord mary ain't helping me do this y'all know what i'm talking about not helping me do this mary need to do that why she ain't helping everybody and and when she went to jesus complaining about mary doing brother brother branham says jesus told martha said martha martha you are troubled about many things you have a legitimate thing to be controlled about but mary has chosen the better part she decided when it was time to come to church she wasn't going to be home cooking she decided when it's time to come to church she wasn't going to be cleaning the house she decided when it's time to come to church she wasn't gonna be at walmart she was gonna come and sit at the feet of jesus glory hallelujah that was the better part yes sir but he says martha kind of listened said after martha when lazarus died he said monster broke through glory sometimes you know you look at people that kind of struggle along but just to let them stay there a while they'll break through once the channel of inspiration opens till they realize you know what god is with me also that's right listen he that's born of god and i'm going to leave you a promise he said thy seed speaking of abraham i'm going to see the god i'm going to see the god thy seed shall possess the gate of every enemy not some every enemy jesus conquered death hell of the grave he conquered everything why because he was god manifested in flesh but also he was a seed of god and he was a seed of abraham the not the natural seed the spiritual seed [Music] are you listening amen possess every promise god bless you listen gloria yes i pray for sick if they want me to pray for i lay hands i speak the word whatever way god deal with you yeah if it's all right with the pastor that's up to you but if you want to be prayed for we'll pray for you gloria want to speak the word gloria i know this spoken word is really see but the way god does it is up to him i don't know one thing i'm i'm like brother braham say i'm responsible for preaching the gospel god is responsible for fulfilling his word as we stand to our feet jesus god bless you god bless you listen i hope that you probably heard it over and over the way to come but the main message of that i heard of thee by the hearing of the ear when god come down to job the prophet wanted let us know that there was a channel of inspiration that was open right so joe move into that he can get in contact and get what he want from god did you believe that god bless you lord can we sing that only believe this brother i i like to praise the lord the angel lord love it i love it too oh they believe it i'm so glad she came
