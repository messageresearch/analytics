amen just so thankful for the mercy of the lord we just have been in contact today with sister um cindy or cynthia soriano and she had just just been in contact back and forth with her regarding brother o'elle both of them had come down with sickness virus whatever we want to call it or refer to it as and sister cindy she's doing she's doing much better but brother owell i just he's um he's at the hospital and so we want to just remember our brother in prayer he needs a real he needs a touch from the lord and i know there's others at times that there's other needs that's that's out there as well and so um we want to just i told sister cynthia i just told her just moments ago that we would just just take brother owell before the throne of god we've been praying throughout the day and you know how sometimes things are in other places they're not even the same as they are here and so um but irregardless as we've said over and over nothing has taken god by surprise nothing has taken god by surprise and god is is over every situation and we're here tonight we're standing here because of his grace and it's his grace that's given us promises that when we've been in need it's god's grace that's given us promises that we can take a promise and hold to that promise despite every situation and whatever is going around we can hold to that promise sometimes there's situations and things that arise sometimes and no matter what it can be sometimes a person can get a report from the doctor's office and that report that comes in it can it can kind of give you a blow and uh you know brother ben would brother brown when he would tell us even when it comes to healing he said it starts out with the right mental attitude and brother branham would he would go into that and say you know mayo clinic would come behind and say brother brown that's absolutely truth the attitude that a patient takes when they receive that news is what really will determine some of the outcomes brother branham he he goes on to say it like this he said if taking the right mental attitude can actually take a condition in a body and just bring it right in subjection and though it may never leave the body through the right just the right mental attitude brother graham said how much greater if it falls back into that subconscious then it's gone but either way it takes grace to have the right mental attitude and we just want to approach the throne of god right now on behalf of our brother and also some of you probably know i don't know if the prayer request i didn't get the sound back there right away but sister patsy and they just lost her mother here today we just got a call right before church so we want to keep the family in prayer sister of betty new brawl and just ask that god will just minister comfort to them in this hour god will just give him strength and just continue to give strength to sister elia i know brother gomez would know this even better but we spoke to her she's doing she's doing good as well and uh just ask the lord i'll just continue to strengthen our sister there's many many different needs that are are among us he's still god he's still god amen there's no need that's too great for him amen can we just go to him and take these requests and let's just if there's another need on your heart you take that as well and we're just going to go before the throne of god right now heavenly father [Music] lord jesus how thankful we are that we can come before your throne lord jesus we can come in that all-sufficient name of the lord jesus christ to know that god that you're more than enough lord for every situation lord there's needs that our brothers and our sisters lord i know that we've been praying lord there's many lord that's been on our hearts lord in other places other localities lord other countries lord as dear god as they've been dealing lord with this virus lord this this devil lord right out of the pits of hell lord we're thankful that we have a promise lord that as believers lord god you've given us your word that by your stripes we are made whole you're the lord that healeth all our diseases lord as you said when sickness comes in the book of exodus i will take it away lord this is our confidence lord [Music] our confidence is in you and we just look to you right now god for brother roel soriano we just asked that lord jesus that the same angel of the lord would just move for our our brother's need right now oh god i pray that lord you would just move upon his body lord and just give him strength lord just driving out oh god father the conditioned lord that would be present there lord just causing lord the other levels in his body to come right in line where they need to be father lord we just ask this lord jesus lord there's other needs lord god that we're aware of maybe some lord are aware of some i'm not aware of and vice versa but we lift up every one of these needs before your throne lord in prayer and we just ask oh god for your divine touch lord in their lives oh god that you would just minister lord to the needs of your children in a special way o god for healing lord in their body lord oh god i'm so thankful that in these moments in these times lord that we have an anchor lord we have a rest in you lord and we're thankful god that every promise you've given us oh god it's more than sufficient to meet the challenge lord oh god we just pray lord may the great peace of almighty god just move down lord for every need lord may the comfort of the holy spirit just moving lord for sister patsy right now god in a very special way oh god in the family lord that you would just lord comfort them lord i pray and minister to them lord in this time of loss o god and lord we just ask lord that you just continue to move lord for sister elia lord and sister michelle lord different needs that's among us lord is a family of god and we just lift him up before your throne tonight lord and we just ask that god that you will just move lord as jehovah rapha lord upon every one of these needs lord father you're merciful lord you're so kind you're so faithful lord we just lord give ourselves to you we ask that you'll just come lord oh god just take the lord your word and just speak to our hearts now in the name of jesus christ amen and amen amen amen god bless you let's let's look here in the scriptures in first corinthians 13. first corinthians 13 and if we could just for the sake of time i'm gonna i want to go right to verse four and we're just remember we're drawing from this of charity and where paul had went through in the very first three verses there's a there's a lot of great things or accolades or a lot of things that would be visible that could be done the moving of mountains giving to the poor even one giving their body to be burned i mean that would be something you would think wow what a what a great sacrifice but but paul brings all of these things that could be done and paul as though it just to remove it back and say what's behind it all because everything that we do god is not looking at what's done it's what's behind it it's what's behind it and this is where that real true greatness is the love of god on display that's that's true greatness it so when we bring it on down a person may you know you might say brother samuel what gift do i have in my life or what do i have to offer what the greatest thing that you have to offer is your life to the lord because you might never you might never maybe you you might never preach the gospel you may not sing specials or you might but you're used as a vessel that the love of god could be displayed through so i think it's fitting in this time that we look at when brother branham would speak of how remember he would tell us in the message look and he would he would give us a word of caution that the unfolding of this word in this hour he said don't go to thinking that you're going to walk into hospitals and they're going to be emptied out that's not what's going to happen but he's dealing with the love of god that would be on display in our life and i i look in the scriptures where when it speaks of the building in the restoration in the building of the tabernacle and the scripture says who hath despised the day of small things because remember it's small things that lead to greater things it's small little foxes that spoil the vine so the greatness real greatness is the display of the love of god i believe we're we're in agreement with that verse four charity suffereth law and is kind charity envieth not fonteth not itself and it's not puffed up it does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked and thinketh no evil may god bless the reading of his word as you're being seated i'd say as we visit this over and over again and how god just would continue to guide us through this part i i would venture to say that without a shadow of a doubt that in each of the times that we have to come back to different parts in our life and things to wear that it might be a moment a day a week or sometime later in different times that we can always come around and the spirit of god when the spirit of the lord dwells within our life that's the love of god and the love of god will always it'll bring real conviction to our life that even how things were done or conducted or even in our behavior because the reality is is that the desire that we would have as a child of god is that our lives would would be in such harmony with him that we want to be in such a way it would be like if if this microphone here or the microphone i have on and sometimes some of you you've known this when you've been here that every once in a while i have to have this cord replaced that goes from the mic into the belt pack because sometimes that cord gets a little weak and it starts making static and pop pop pop pop popping even though i can speak through the microphone we could continue on with service but that pop pop pop pop pop would become a little bit bothersome you'd say just switch microphones so that you can be you can just focus on what's being said in other words to remove every distraction from around our life and and that's what the spirit of god that's even when god comes and deals with our life to correct us god comes to correct us so that our lives might be without any distraction just a channel a vessel that's open and it's surrendered to him and i i look at this here with with our our our our behavior and we've been looking at it in this manner and rather than just saying that love does not behave itself rudely but rather taking the the focus on of how that love is one is that which really it seeks to honor even when honor itself may not even be uh something that you could say is due to a person or due to something but yet love itself is what governs our lives to even as we gave certain examples of you know brother branham and i could have more to share of things that how that it wasn't brother branham it's the love of god as brother brown himself allowed the love of god to have the preeminence in his life and to see that was that was with the purpose so that god might continue to move and to work and deal with his life and it wasn't just about so that his ministry brother branham's desire was never that the ministry would be big brother braham's desire was always that jesus christ would be glorified that was the whole purpose brother brown never wanted i mean if you really consider it they could have had the biggest building in the world and nothing wrong with a big building they could have had a building that would have outshined and anything else that could have been and i'm talking about after things started moving along the round but you realize that was never the focus you come to the very end there in the i love it in the resume of the church ages and they put it there right inside the the sleeve of the tape case and they put that paragraph there and when brother ram says there's one desire that i've had not for one moment he said have i wanted people that they would follow me or to start an organization but he said i've strove for one thing and that's that that man and woman might have a true relationship with jesus christ and by that become new creatures in christ jesus and i i'll say that that's the love of god that was been projected in this generation so when the message when we talk about the message i believe this with all my heart the message that god has sent in this hour is a display and a projecting of the love of god that overthrows bitterness it overthrows malice it overthrows all the you say brother samuel how can you say it because it's the word of god and there's nothing can stand before the word of god it overcomes think about your life and my life before the love of god come to us we were in the bitterness of bondage we were in the bitterness of life but the love of god come to you and i to draw us to bring us to lead us out of bitterness into the love of god so what overcame bitterness the love of god there's nothing as great as the love of god that's why solomon could write in the song of solomon that you know if a man would try to give all his substance for it it doesn't even measure up to whatever it is there's nothing floods cannot overthrow it you love the love of god is so great it's it's so great and so precious and so when we look at this and we've been dealing with this thought of honor in the home and i want to just jump right back in here and move a little bit further here this this this evening and thinking remember in the parallels we're looking at this that this is a parallel of christ and the bride and the husband and wife and within the home in verse 21 it says submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord that didn't say just to any man but unto your husband and think of think now in the spiritual to what who is our husband the lord jesus christ and he is what the word so the word itself does not play with emotions the word comes to present itself that i am your all sufficiency i am all that you have need of i am here to provide for you is that what the word does and so what what when the word is being preached it's not an idea it's not a personality when the word is being ministered it is the husband our lord jesus christ that's being ministered that's where it was as the body itself was growing down through the ages feet legs pies on and on and on it's god building his body through what upon this rock i will build my church what is the rock the revelation of himself who is he the word our husband so it is that part of it this is why brother brahm could say in christ a mystery he said the secrets that he's revealing not to flirters but to those that genuine that that have a desire to know god his wife his children that's the ones that god reveals himself to so what a privileged people we are wives submit yourself so as we're going to come back to this and i want to just i i really want to hit this part as we're looking at it last week the word here in submit notice wives submit yourself this is not a forced of forced doing at all we are not here because we're forced to be here we're not but what it is it says wife submit yourself so the submission is actually it's not the husband's doing it's the wife's doing to watch is before her she's submitting herself unto the husband it's not a demand it's not a command it's not a it's not well you have to do that's not what it is at all are you with me wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord so as we were kind of looking at that last week as unto the lord so even when things himself seems to be hard as unto the lord that's why paul could say with servants and masters and other things we can apply in life when it seems to be hard remember as unto the lord it is as unto the lord so here if we could pull that definition up with submit and submit itself is to subject oneself to submit to one's control to yield to one's admonition or advice to obey to be subject so it's a in in a non-military part of it i want to bring this in it's a voluntary attitude of giving in cooperating assuming responsibility and carrying a burden now when brother brandon was here he referred to a quote about completely surrender do you recall that where you have someone who wrote in a in in a question that said brothers brother branham brother brown i i just can't i can't seem to completely surrender to the lord jesus brother braham doesn't know if it's man or woman but brother brahma here as he begins to take the direction as though as it's a woman and brother branham writes it and he's his response was and he he parallels it of how that a woman would would give herself to her husband and brother i don't have this up there but let me just refer to it he says if you're a woman don't you have to surrender to your husband to be a wife surrender all you are a little lady when you're married virtuous fought all your life to stay virtuous but one day you found a man that you love you were com his completely the things that you'd fought against all your life and tried to live clean and clear and virtuous now you surrender every bit of it to him you put yourself completely in his hands notice what he says you put yourself completely in his hands he says you are his see that's that's what coming to the new birth the new birth cannot come without complete surrender god doesn't for it the holy ghost is not a forced thing that god gets somebody in a headlock and they say mercy i submit no that's that's not what it is god god can deal with the life then maybe they're kind of stubborn and hard-headed and god just starts taking things out of the way you know starts taking out feathers out of that because if we're comfortable in the life that we're in that's a problem but god knows what to do to get our attentions to where we surrender to him that's what the whole preaching of the gospel is about it's not about a commitment sign a card be here on thursday be here on sunday that's not what it is it's a surrendered life that then as brother brahms says he brings his life in and now he lives his life through your your life so that what others see they can see the same old temple but what they're beholding is that you're not the same person you used to be you don't go along with the same things your appetites and all those things are different what's happened to you you've received another spirit are you with me you've been united with that part of christ of where you always belong to him but now that spirit that part of the original spirit has come and sought you out and has brought you to a place of surrender so what have you done as a bride of jesus christ you have submitted yourselves unto him glory this is why it's not a church it's not a personality it's not an idea it's not a movement it's jesus christ amen the rest of the stuff it'll never work it can religion religion it religion is only a covering it never brings relationship you put yourself completely in his hands you are his all that you have stood for in decency and morale and everything like that you turn over to a man because you surrender yourself to that man he says can't you do the same thing to jesus christ just surrender yourself that way all that i am all my mind all my thoughts so when we look at this let me just read here a portion from where we were we were at and then we're going to move on here uh even a little more tonight but out of the satire and church age and brother adam is bringing this in here and he says now a woman is not meant to have an iron disposition she is according to the holy scripture to be submissive to the male that's commanded of her now remember when you see the word command command itself is the words that's given for leadership is that right jesus said a new commandment i write unto you he said you did not believe moses how shall you believe my words what was his words it was the message it was the commandments is that right paul said let him that is spiritual meaning spirit filled born again acknowledged that the things that i have wrote unto you are the commandments of the lord so it's remember thinking with this term this thought in mind it is not something to where we are operating in a manner of fear of if i don't do this so i'm not going to make it or if i don't know it's operating under the divine love of god that you desire to please him in every way even when there's things that are brought to our attention that maybe we're not even aware of but the holy spirit will bring it to our attention and we say yes lord and forgive me we quickly turn from that why because we are a part of the body of jesus christ his wife woman who is truly female all female will be of that disposition now without me dealing a lot and going in a lot of teaching we all have different temperaments right melancholy same guy all that we got all of us have different temperaments david said i'm fearfully and wonderfully made is that right god did not have every one of the apostles they were not the same paul was different from peter brother bram tells us things that ought to be if you judge peter by james you'd be in problems because he said peter was that you know it's kind of bolsters james was always that you know that quiet and that prayerful type and so forth but they were used of god according to the capacity that god desired to use them for remember he's jehovah jireh providing for himself so brothers tell me what are you saying that what brother branham is dealing with here that god is not desiring because as he's made us that we try to emulate somebody else or try to be like somebody else yet yet paul would write through titus of how that the elder men that have passed through journeys in their life as young men middle-aged men and so forth that they are to help the young men to teach them to be sober-minded also to as husbands an example that's live it's not something to say ah they're coming on they'll figure it out on their own no paul says this is a responsibility of the brethren in the local assembly oh my boy i don't know we're going somewhere here oh by the same i've done paid my dues what was your dues i've done raised my children you ain't done the bible says in the book of deuteronomy you're to teach the children and thy children's children it's not done it's not something where i done paid my dues now granted you know maybe for those of you that you know maybe i'm kind of prophesying of where you're at right now you say man with a grandchild it's a little bit better you know brother samuel i can prophesy and send them home you know and deal with these these things like this but you recognize it never ends it never stops and really what is our desire even i think here sitting here tonight there's some of you that my goodness you've been in you serving the lord for so many years what a testimony it is to this assembly and even as young people it's a testimony to this assembly you see the encouragement goes back and forth but what a testimony in the midst of a time in an hour where you see lives that have held through thick and thin where there's been ups where there's been downs you can look across this assembly and you know there is tests and trials that has been faced that we don't know nothing about but they have held to god it shows this message works it works this is why even within titus paul would write to how that the women of the sisters they would actually be one now they're not you know the brethren aren't standing up and holding seminars and the sisters holding seminars and but there's ways to go about things to be an example as paul would write this in titus you're all with me he would write this what is this these are things that we can't forget where where we've come from and even the experiences that we've learned that we sow them forward i mean i trust by god's grace i when i sit down you know with my boys and at times you knows we're sitting there as a family in the living room or and when i'm out with them and i have just the time just just with just with them and i can tell them i'll say now look i expect that there's things i said that even in times to come i expect you to learn from dad's mistakes i hope that's okay i said because i have not been perfect but i hope you to learn from them that things that you can see where dad's been right up front and honest with you that you can take it and you can sow forward these things in coming is that right this is a responsibility these are things i know these are not things that we look at and say oh that's real deep let me just say this if this message does not produce a life outside of church then it's no good this message is to produce a life not just in church many have got that this is not a church live this is token lifetime are you with me it's a life that's to be lived outside of these walls oh my my goodness who is a woman who is truly female all female will be of that disposition not a doormat no real male look look take this in real real carefully no real male makes a female a doormat but she will want now notice this he will not make now but she will want to be under authority and not rule over the mail for he is the head of the house notice how it's placed in here what is governing all of this the love of god the love of god is what causes where a husband does not make a wife a doormat because he's treating himself that way hello neither now look with that that governing then it's the love of god that here that a wife a woman she'll want to be under that authority so it shows there's got to be that which created to want to desire to be under that authority that's there my goodness and i without getting into all of this here tonight but let me just move on because i don't want to i i just don't want to dwell with the rest of that that portion of the of that quote right now but there's a responsibility in verse 23. how many know there's responsibility can we say the word responsibility that's a big word isn't it there's certain things a lot of times we want in life and it comes with more responsibility is that right i mean when you know you you want your driver's license and then all of a sudden you get your driver's license oh i gotta pay car insurance now i got to help out with gas whoo now i got to check the air in the tires now more responsibility there's pleasure but it comes with responsibility is that right and responsibility my goodness responsibility is not a bad thing this the the the time that we live in the age that we live in the world you say brother samuel why would you even do it because the world itself remember we are not wrestling against flesh and blood we're wrestling against principalities there's all things of laws and everything else that is against the family it's against husband and wife it's against all this satan would love nothing more than to try to come and twist that all around it's a spirit it's not the people they don't realize what they're under they don't reckon that's why you feel sorry for it that's why when brother bram could say in the message shalom father forgive them for they know not what they do brother brahman says i've come to recognize that that people don't know what they're doing it's insanity because of the darkness that's upon them it doesn't mean that we excuse it it means that you recognize it's a spirit and spirits travel through words they travel through all sorts of channels of media everything else spirits comes in is that right it's a responsibility in verse 23 for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body when you think of head the word head is the same right here in the scriptures used in the book of colossians throughout it deals with the life of the body the head is the life of the body the the the the headship of the authority but notice the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body so what does the life bring it brings savior to the body what is savior savior it's it's a it's a saving it's a delivering it's a preserving it's a providing i'm glad that it just don't one time he delivers but i'm glad like paul said paul said when i was in a trial paul identified i might not have had lion's breath breathing on me but the trout that i was in god delivered me out of the mouth of the lion and paul also said that when i'm going through the roughest of times he's not away from me it's a time of fellowship of his sufferings oh he's a friend that sticks closer than a brother glory be to god glory be to god my i'll tell you i could just stop right here and just love him a little bit amen oh when i've been sick and maybe i'm not able to do something that i normally would be able to do he don't love me any less that's the time that he draws me up next to him and loves on me a little bit more i'm not saying brother samuel you were sick and you weren't able to stand here in the pulpit that don't mean he don't love me any less when i'm there and i'm sick he's loving on me he's taking me up closer to him in that time i need that love and that ministry and that care in that moment what an example he is to us oh god help us he's the savior of the body verse 24. now notice 23 was dealing with the responsibilities and we're going to move into this verse 24 is the wife yielding to provisions that are made available to her therefore as the church is subject unto christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything now remember as is fit in the lord husbands will not ask i'm talking about even believing husbands okay i i can't even i'm not even in the place of dealing with situations of things of unbelieving spouses but i'm dealing with this aspect of it here because remember when brother brown would take that in colossians and he would say wives submit yourselves unto your husbands as unto the lord as is fit in the lord brother bram said if if a husband were to ask you stop going to church you're not disobeying the fedship when you say i love you and i respect you as my husband but god is first oh i want you to wear these shorts i love you and i respect you but god's word is above [Applause] so then when we when we look at it in a way so then what would it be between a believing husband and wife it should actually be the display of the word because a husband doesn't want to bring anything inside of the home or inside of that relationship that would not be the word on display because it's to be submit as unto the lord so there's an atmosphere now i want you to think of this notice how it's went back and forth the word submission is used here within the word subject there is the same as the word submission i want you to look here in verse 25 and i'm just being purposeful in the things that i'm saying here in verse 25 i want you to look at this atmosphere what's been said of the church it's went back into that place in verse 24 the church is subject unto christ so let the wives be to their own husbands and everything notice the next words husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it this is impossible without the holy ghost because the holy ghost is the love of god remember brother branham he takes us in christ revealed in his own word and i'm not going to refer to this to make you squirm i'm just going to say it in the manner brother brahms dealing with it all through the message of how the field love and agape love and brother i remember he's gathered around with brethren they're already married they've got children and brother bran begins to speak speak to them and say let's just say that before you were married there was no engagement there was nothing and here you in a dream you dreamed concerning this of your wife or you know of this young lady and then she comes and tells you after all this that she could be happy with someone else now remember they're not married brother bram takes them back to where they're not married are you with me i didn't lose nobody here did i okay because i want nobody to think no no ain't no loopholes here but brother braham is saying in the manner when he brings it up there before the brethren he's dealing with those things and he's saying in this manner he's trying to help them to see he says what if she said to you that she actually could be happier with another man i really feel toes curling up my toes kind of curling up right now then you could you say to her do you now what brother bram says do you love her well enough to say god's blessings rest upon you my dear go with this other man are you saying where's he at brother perry said gonna give him a little bit of fivefold are you with me see i when i when we read these things i believe as believers that we don't just it's things that we recognize that that the prophet being under the inspirational holy spirit is giving you and i things to that our lives to really to really pray about he's drawing them those brethren into a place he says now look if your love is correct you would do that for you are interested in her welfare notice what it's about not you her welfare oh my everybody's still alive right if you love her then i want you to keep these phrases if you love her then you want her to be happy brother said the same way with god god's will whether i'm happy with god's will or not i want to live so he will be pleased with what i do i mean hey brother branham himself you know he wanted to live he wanted to live a lot earlier in the mountains right but it wasn't god's will at that time but then it came to a place that it was god's will remember the rabbi said regardless if yeah i want to please him because it's his will that i desire to do so brother batman is dealing with he says now see that's the same way with the genuine love for god he says i don't care what part of the body i am i don't care what part that god asked me to do whatever it doesn't have to be anything of significance it's just i want to do i want to please him and he says that's the same thing about your wife so when you found now bring in that parallel same thing about the wife it doesn't matter it could be so grandiose oh my this will really stand out but even if it's times where there's things that seem very minute and can seem like well that don't seem very grandiose but everything matters think about it in this assembly right here think about in the assembly in the body to have a service like this tonight it don't just happen if there wasn't people and brother brandon you know he he complimented on that that was that was quite something as well too i i think about that i've mentioned that there's people that they they take care to make sure that the building is ready the building is clean things have been not just that but it's things that's going beyond themselves if i can just get myself to church on time now it's things that goes beyond that hello you guys with me it goes beyond that and we're not talking about just cleaning the church we're talking about things it keeps it goes beyond that and it isn't it doesn't have to be things that's noticeable because if it's things that you do and every time you do and god used me here and god used me there god that's a braggart it's a braggart you know you don't tell everything of god use me here i did this here that that's that's elevating self but there's things that are done behind the scenes that make it possible right here tonight there's lives that no doubt across this building could stand up and say i've been praying for the service here tonight many many different needs my how do we get on that the atmosphere husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it now think of this husbands love your wives it's a display of real genuine affection and it's affection that has has a definite a real care within it it's a it's a display of an affection to have a real delight and a pleasure in them and i want you just to listen to some of these things that i have down in showing respect in doing honor to them honor to them doesn't mean bowing down before them that's something we were talking about but honoring them as paul peter would write as the weaker vessel is that right i mean a glass vase on the table you don't play around it is that right matter of fact if there's a glass lamp you tell the kids i quit throwing the ball around in here take it outside why there's a possibility that they could knock that glass off and it could shatter so showing honor or doing honor to and seeking a contentment a satisfaction of pleasure and a quiet constant and comfortable dwelling in providing all things necessary for them think of that providing all things necessary for them not to have the latest dress that's not necessary i understand you know sisters you want to look beautiful and pretty but well i don't have the latest the exact color you know on my kitchen walls just that's but there are things providing all things necessary for them in reality you know brethren and you've heard this said over and over before it wasn't until the sister came on the scene we started moving furniture adam had to start moving trees she don't like it here move over here is that right is that true you so but but it's done in delight providing all things necessary protecting them from all injuries and abuses concealing their faults that's a powerful thing isn't it see what i'm reading about you say brother simon where are you drawing this from the attributes of christ the attributes of christ husbands love your wives even as christ so loved the church he conceals our faults our shortcomings he doesn't spread it around oh he's weak in this she's weak in that they failed this many times he don't do that as a matter of fact he so conceals it by his grace he's not concealing wrong but he conceals our faults with his own grace in our lives and he covers our weaknesses he covers our infirmities and and entertains the best opinions of our persons and actions it's okay if in your heart you say out of me help me lord it's okay an endeavoring endeavoring to promote a spiritual good and a welfare this is what the lord jesus does for us over and over and over again sure we failed him many times but he's never failed us is that right he doesn't put something but he covers our weaknesses remember brother braham says you keep your weaknesses covered by the blood of jesus christ there's things that as brother brown would we would deal with our lives of how that you reign over things in our life he gives us grace to reign over things in our life he gives us grace through tests and through trials and through adversity he gives more grace he's constantly protecting us how that god watches over us he provides for all of our needs i i tell you may god help us and to not take anything for granted he provides for us again and again not just the natural things of life but the spiritual necessities of what you and i have need of how many times where we've been down or or discouraged and he'll come right along and he'll minister right to our life not that we deserve it but he does it because he's our husband and we're his wife and he loves us that's his care to you and i yeah oh my so even as christ also loved the church and gave himself forth so notice we've been looking at why submit yourselves unto your own husbands and then it jumps to church it's subject as the church is subject unto christ in in all things i want you to notice here the requirements you'll find throughout this chapter and you find another in other and other uh letters there that were wrote by the holy spirit through paul it'll deal with wives being submissive but the requirement for the husband is love why because without love submission can't be so submission is to be a voluntary it's to be something of a yielding it's a giving in and it's a working together so what is over it all love oh my let me let me just let me let me have just a few moments is that okay so it brings into that place so for that for a wife if it would be hard for a wife to be in subjection i mean because no man is just going to walk up to a wife and or a woman and say you know what you're my wife and i want you to go do this or what more she might be the new gold medalist and i would encourage a ron's sister run run run run as fast as you can and don't let him catch you because there's a wrong approach christ never approached us like that see it's the approach of christ god approached our life by wooing drawing us to a place of surrender is that right that's why you could say well you know our courtship was this long another person says our courtship was this long and i there's no such thing as saying well the courtship should only be this long and it should only be those are young people you know i've taught these things it's no such thing it's got to be this law it's a wooing that takes place it's the same way in a church a person i tell you what they ought to be moving on right now there ought to be things they're moving on a little bit further this is not a work of man man can't order this if man orders it and it's done under man it'll come back because it's man but if god's doing the work brother then god's laying in by his love there's a dismantle of the holds in the things of life that's why brother branham says as you fall in love with jesus you become love is that right so it restores this is why then for everything that's required there of a wife it's the spirit of love the christ-like love on the part of the husband that makes the duty very easy so as the wife the single duty subjection submission the single duty of the husband is love what a what what a balance what a balance within this song of solomon chapter two verse three as the apple tree among the trees of the wood so is my beloved among the suns i sat down under his shadow with great delight this is the bride the shepherd girl that solomon had sought out this is her response she's not made to she sat down under him with great delight and his fruit was sweet to my taste isn't it wonderful to serve the lord isn't it wonderful to be under his protection that's what his shadow is it's his protection we are hidden in him he's providing for us all that we have needed lord i i i need i i need help financially i've got that covered lord i'm weak i'm your strength lord i i i need healing i'm your healer lord i i i need deliverance i'm your delivery see he is all things to us he becomes all things he's a satisfier of our needs oh i know sometimes the husband you're thinking i want to say amen but that's some big shoes to fill in but remember it's christ this is the thing to present it's the lord jesus christ we give ourselves to him he guides and directs us and he's the one that helps us to fulfill what he's called us to do god's not called us as husbands or wives to do things that is beyond our measure he's called us to do things that are completely in line with the measure of grace that he's given to us and his fruit was sweet to my taste he brought me to the banqueting house and his banner his standard over me was love let me just let me end here tonight we'll just stop here so there's a governing effect here of love remember brother would write about how remember he would deal with the pentecostal church and so many even when you find some of the latter rain was starting they started to it was reaching out for gifts and and i don't believe when everything first started that it was something wrong i believe there just was a hunger for the supernatural i really believe that but how the spirit of god i look coming would guide the church of the living god into a place to realize there's something deeper than a gift and that's the giver himself because if you get the giver then all the gifts come with it you know i mean if you get him he's the complete package he is the feast he is that's why brother brown could say in spoken words original seed he could go into all those things in him as the millennium in him why because it's an unfolding that's why he talked about the seventh seal as a roman candle goes up keeps every one of them goes up why he keeps on folding himself oh my oh i love him don't you oh i love him that's why brother branham when he would deal with this and he would speak about the gifts he says the gifts must be governed by love or they're not effective so everything i want you to think about that the gifts must be governed by love or they're not affected so is it with everything in our lives if it's not governed by love it's not effective it must be governed by love love is the motivating factor you see god did not just come down and pay the price for you and i redeem us simply because well he cared about us but his care was he desired to bring comfort to our lives see there's things that a person can do out of care but we're talking about as a husband a care a care that cares the desire to really make happy that wife is really to see to her delight i sat down under his shadow with great delight so what caused her to say setting she didn't say i sat down under his shadow oh man no it was with great delight it was with great delight and you know you can tell my this is a match made in heaven come on somebody i believe that for my wife and i it was a match made in heaven it was just two that dropped down i believe that it was complementary some of you don't know what to say amen or not [Laughter] it's okay but i believe that it's a match it's how because god knows the corresponding part and so the effectiveness that is within it is even in the things that we do that it's governed by love that's why there's nothing should be done in a church but that it would be governed by love the ministering of the word is to be governed by love speaking the truth in love that don't mean you know that powdered sugar is flying out of my lips like spit does but it means it's governed in love it has the best interest is that right love this is why as brother brahman say i told you as closing and i am love should govern the home and this is where brother brahm comes into that place and he's talking about how it should govern let that be the brand says the principle love first love first i just close it in this manner we just pick it up when god god came and he sought us out i think how the love of god began to move upon our life it brings conviction it draws upon our heart but the love of god is you find how the love of god begins to move upon a life and you'll find things beginning to disappear from that life what's causing it to disappear what's causing it to something that was held here of great value to them maybe something that meant a lot to them but the love of god coming it causes that life to release it and take a hold upon him who's taken hold upon their life what's doing that the love of god what is it that dissolved the difference the chasm between us and god the love of god came down and spanned the breach but we could not get to him but he came and he spanned the breach to where that between god and man there's no longer a chasm it's the reality is is that a person doesn't have to go any longer without being a fully manifest son and daughter of god because the love of god has made a way for us love governs everything love governs that this so i would i would invite us in this manner to say it like this if there's things that we could say well you know brother samuel i i think there's some things that maybe fallen out here or fallen out there or fallen out there you know brother brahm says in one place he says he says when you when you can't overlook your brothers and sisters mistakes you've fallen out of love because we are all we all have shortcomings are you with me we all make mistakes god doesn't set us down and say no you stop doing this and you stop doing that and you stop no no the answer is not that the answer is love the love of god so it's falling out of love is what causes all the prickiness and everything else to stand out is that right so what removes takes cactus needles and brings leaves what does that his life letting his life just move let water come let water come invite invited i i would say tonight just like within every one of us i would say it in this manner lord let the holy spirit just be so preeminent lord in our lives let the holy spirit just lord if there's something that you feel like you've went astray here or and every one of us i've got my hands up i say lord because i want you to understand when brother samuel stands here i'm not standing here with just a bunch of fingers going there when i'm standing here i want my life to be changed i want this word to come and to further change my life i want to be more like him i want to be more like him even many times as we're standing right here and the word just continues to open and i believe that's our heart's desire we can come back to say lord love first love first that be the principle amen you love him amen let's bow our heads heavenly father lord jesus i i thank you lord for how for your grace and mercy lord lord as we look in these examples lord in the scripture and as you're you're here to teach us and to edify us every one of us lord and we want to grow lord lord no doubt tonight i there might be some someone here someone streaming or will archive this that lord their whole view of serving you it's changed they realize it's not your work their works that you want your desire lord is surrender under the love of god that you have everything provided for them lord to take care of every every need in their life you you have what's needed to take care of that old sinful nature and to release them from a life of bondage into liberty lord i pray tonight god may they just as you took us there and that quote at the beginning may they just come to a place of surrender and say lord all that i am all my thoughts all my life i give it all to you lord jesus granted lord i pray lord i ask that you and just lord move among us right now in every home every husband every wife lord as a body of believers lord this is our desire love first the love of god first that lord you would guide us lord i pray that lord even in these services lord it's my prayer as a husband that god you'll just continue to come and change me lord god shape me and make me lord i pray that god that my brethren lord no matter where they're aged lord no matter where they're at even a young man that lord can be sitting here tonight and lord they're not even in a place lord of marriage but they can look at that and say god that's the kind of man i want to be lord where a sister can look lord into the word see lord god how that you draw us as the bride of jesus christ that we're not here out of a threat we're not here lord out of lord a place of fear we're here because we love you that's our desire is to please you some things lord we can all be very honest as the bride of jesus christ there's some things lord that you would ask us to do it's not real comfortable it's things lord that you might look at it might be some something lord you'd say testify to this one or get up and give this tet now to somebody who's outgoing and lord could talk talk talk talk talk well that may not be that much of a twisting of an arm at all but for somebody else lord who it's hard to get in front of one person let alone 5 10 20 50 whatever but they're willing to do it because you ask them to now lord i pray may god every sister every young lady lord that would be here every every lady of god the lord jesus could just have that same desire to say lord let me be a reflection in my life oh god of that bride the bride of jesus christ that i'm a part of a wife lord help me teach me lord show me help me lord in every way always husband and wife together [Music] oh lord jesus help us lord i pray god may you just continue to move in our lives move in our midst lord may the holy spirit oh god just having such liberty lord right here in homes not just here when we get here but in homes in lives lord father whatever the past has been may it
