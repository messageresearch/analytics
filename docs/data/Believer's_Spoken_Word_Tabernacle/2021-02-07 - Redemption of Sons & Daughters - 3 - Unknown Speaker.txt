TRANSCRIPT
========================================
nine to god and he'll draw nine to me lord granted this morning we pray may you just come take control lord lord i stand in need of you i stand here lord just to be a vessel it's all lord may you come father take over in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you thank you musicians if we could stand let's go to ephesians 5 now or not ephesians isaiah 53. we'll just read a few verses of scripture and then we'll let you have your seats and we'll just continue reading in verse 1 of isaiah 53 it says who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there's no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb so he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked with the rich in his death and because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth may god bless you as you've been seated i want to continue their reading just a little bit but i'd like to just continue with the thought we've been looking at redemption the redemption of sons and daughters of god you'll notice in the scripture as it says we all were like sheep we always were a sheep couldn't be recognized nor did we display that we were sheep but notice we all went our own way because there is one who is as peter would write under inspiration who is the bishop and shepherd of our soul and that's the lord jesus himself he made a way when he was here many of the disciples the word would come and would call them they would leave what they had and begin to follow him but yet he he let him know he says i must needs go away because if i don't go away then the comforter he can't come he's is going away truly it was a they didn't understand what was taking place even as he would speak many times of his death and the price that was to be paid even as he met their amount transfiguration there in the gospel of luke i believe it is because he speaks and they are all there there there is such a an intimate communion there as he stands there with moses and elijah and they speak to him they converse of those things that should lead in into his death the offering up of the atonement and what that would mean because this is what has been looked for this is what has been longed for this is this is the desire that within that heart that was longing even how david would write and say the lord is my shepherd i shall not want and yet david did not know him in that way as far as in that of redemption in that manner where god would come by his spirit and indwell david's life never to depart david would as all of them through the old testament the spirit of god would come down upon them and then it would lift back and then it would come back upon them and then it would lift back but there was god's desire that there would be a union that would come about a union and a fellowship that you and i might come back into our rightful position of where that we would be as sons and daughters of god yet we were like sheep that had gone astray everyone our own way and he he the lord laid as the bible says the iniquity of us all upon him there was only one who could bear this there was only one who could redeem us and bring us back and it couldn't be anyone separate or apart from god but it must be god himself come down and pay the price through the sacrifice of his son the lord jesus it was god taking up on a body of flesh a body of humiliation in order to redeem us back to himself so somebody had to make the way for us and he he made a way for you and i the bible would go on to declare as we're reading who shall declare his generation notice it doesn't say generations when you open the book of matthew chapter 1 it says now this is the generation of jesus christ because it's not generations there's one there is no ending to his life amen it is when god when god has imparted remember even leading up to that time when we have received that quickening in our life remember that representation that seed it was laying there the whole time there was a representation of eternal life in reality we were saved the whole time but there's got to come a reality and that reality has to come to you and i that we were saved the whole time and when that reality comes to us it changes our lives in order to reflect that security that is in jesus christ shall declare his generation that's a challenge that goes forth to our lives today amen to reflect him and this is where the scripture if we can just to pick up in these verses it says yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many remember when jesus was here this knowledge it's speaking of this is that of a divine revelation he knew who he was he knew the purpose that he had come here for that purpose was for redemption that had been shown all the way in tights all the way through the scripture even opening in genesis 1. the light coming in genesis 1 the word being spoken bringing light it was bringing redemption to this earth that was covered over with darkness and void that back in genesis 1 speaks of the new birth in our life so it's that mystery has been shown all the way through his purpose of coming was not to make a kingdom upon this earth but his purpose was to redeem the sons and daughters of god to pay and satisfy the debt and the price that was needed that you and i could go free thank you lord amen so his look the revelation moving in his life by my knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities and i can say to you this morning if you're still carrying your sins what you need to recognize is there's one who's already bore them for you and as soon as you can recognize that of what he has done for you you'll experience a release in your life you can sit here under and under such condemnation with sin and and bearing that you don't know what i've done let me just sum this up this is the second time here in this same chapter reading he laid upon him the iniquity of a song for he shall bear their iniquities [Music] he born once and for all therefore will i divide him a portion with the great notice this offering this this serving the purpose now he receives their apportion an allotment an inheritance with the great and i say this very clearly there's not one grader not even close you can take the greatest people in the world and stack them on top of one another but not one of them they might give you a better job they might be able to sign your paycheck they might be you might be able to rub shoulders with who's who but nobody can deal with your soul and take care of the answer for what you're longing for but the greatest of all and that's the lord jesus christ hallelujah this one really cares about you [Applause] he just don't care about you because of what you might be able to offer him or what you might be able to do for him he's got a real desire for your soul [Applause] it's for your life he came that you might have life and have life more abundantly [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and he shall o glory he shall divide the spoil with the strong there was a battle at calvary the battles turning into gethsemane it was one it came to calvary now calvary here he ascends now into the lowest parts of hell yeah without them without going into all that he whipped he whipped the devil took the keys he ascended up and he told them to wait in the city of jerusalem until you be endued with power the dividing of the spoil that image that left them in the garden when they fell that life that departed from them and here they come into a place where now of complete of just you know where mortality now because of disobedience to the word now death sets in but when life is come that life it comes to deal with the condition of the soul this is why just the offering up of a body would never ever do it must be the offering of his soul hallelujah because there must be that which would pay the ransom for our debt he shall see notice he shall see the travail of his soul they saw the body but god was looking beyond the body he saw the travail of his soul saul became the offering for our sin bodies of animals this is animal bodies of animals have been offered up but an animal does not have a soul man could go and be justified in the presence of god but he left with the same nature there can never be a transformation of his nature hallelujah go with me right now this morning you could see what our father was beholding when this isaiah was caught up in a vision and he's looking in upon it but this this vision now becomes a reality it comes from the supernatural into that of the flesh of the lord jesus and here god is looking down and here his pleasure the bruising and seeing the travailing of the soul you say how can there be delight in that because through this offering now sons and daughters of god can come back home what the world looked at as weakness but god said through this weakness my power will be released glory be to god he shall divide the spoil with the strong the strong meaning the numerous ones the word strong messiah's brothers is that right you see this is this is one this is our joshua it's the holy ghost has come to divide our inheritance because he have poured out notice his soul unto death he was numbered with the transgressors and he beared the sin of many and made tr and made intercession for the transgressors brother makes this statement and i want to just refer to this here just serve as a as a background for things that we'll go into the message unveiling of god he says he died to reveal himself to us now let us die to self to reveal him to others let us die to the traditions and things to reveal him to others died to the denominations to reveal him to others so it's a dying to self that the word might have preeminence a person could say well this is my this is my affiliation or this is what i believe maybe they're a methodist this is what i believe but when the word comes across your pathway and it starts dealing with your life and you realize wait a minute there's more to it there's a longing within you there's more than just a church membership it's a spirit of god that's dealing with your life what's he trying to do lead you to a place to die to self [Music] the climax of the ministry of the lord jesus was when he comes to a place of complete death to self amen i believe we're in there i believe we're there this is where the holy spirit deals with our life to die yes amen you can't be born again until you first die right you can't have two natures there you can't have two of them alive at the same time amen there's got to be one where judgment comes and then he raises up the other in a uniting amen is that right so you see this is why without dying out it continues to work even in our life of us dying to sound even as god will continue to deal with our hearts and dying to ourselves now i want to just take this here uh in in the scriptures and just looking at this of this redemption of the sons and daughters of what has been made for you and i and i want to say it just in this manner as we go forward to recognize that we were given an inheritance before the foundation of the world [Music] our inheritance was already there you don't receive an inheritance as far as somebody then uh relinquishes or gives something to you after they pass an inheritance is what has already been made for or what has already been laid out the death of that individual only brings you into a place where you can go and rightfully claim what belongs to you amen so we already had an inheritance brother brandon would keep working with this through the adoption series he says jesus never gave me an inheritance he brought me to it amen what he received he divides it's by him by him through him that we receive our inheritance our allotted portion stay with me who is he the word [Music] he's the word the word is a living person our inheritance is in the word the land where did the children of israel where did their inheritance lay it didn't lay on the other side of jordan some chose that right are you are you with me some chose the other side of jordan they got comfortable they got laid down but i want you to think about this look years later for those who said we'll just take our inheritance on this side of jordan you heard of the maniac of gadara right you look at what happened in that community when jesus came into that community in that time there was one who was bound there with with a legion of devils and jesus heard the call he couldn't help it that man couldn't help it that his fathers and everything else grandfathers that they made the decision not to go over but he made there was something in him are you hearing me he didn't have to live under the darkness of what his father did what his grandfather did there was a call inside of him that a legion of demons couldn't hold back and jesus heard that call and he crossed the water to get to him that man was set free he wanted to go and he wanted to go with jesus and jesus said go back to the city you came from and tell all your friends of the mercy that the lord hath had upon you hallelujah god took a man who was bound and that man was set free he now had something to talk about [Music] you think it wasn't a miracle when he would walk down the streets of gattera they didn't have to worry about him no more punching out windows [Music] come on now mama didn't have to worry about him coming home a bad way the kids didn't have to run from him something had changed but the rest of that community they because their hogs those evil spirits came and they ran they ran those herds bit us to go into the swine it ran them off and notice notice the effect of being out from the presence of god they asked him get out of here please they didn't want the lord jesus around you see what happens you see this is what happens for those who choose just to live on that side of the inheritance listen this is where every denomination is it's in that place that's why it comes to a place in there in the book of revelations he said i stand at the door and now they put him out they don't want him they want to talk about isaiah 53 as a historical event but it's not a historical event it's a reality that comes to your life to release you from the death and the question of sin in your life hallelujah he sent back the holy ghost to proclaim that word it was to call them calling them in to the land to come into this place how do we get into this land hallelujah by one spirit first corinthians 12 for by one spirit we are all baptized into one body we've witnessed here over the months baptisms yes whether it was brother richard myself brother gomez myself or whoever brothers there was a there was a commandment in the word we with our strength baptize them in accordance with the word to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ repented of their sins and to be baptized with the baptism is a declaration there's an inward work taking place men can put you down in the water and bring you up but a man cannot put you into christ takes the holy spirit are you hearing me but the same god who dealt with your heart and brought conviction to your heart and said you need to get right you need to get you need to surrender he's the same one that baptizes you into himself [Applause] what's he trying to do call you into your inheritance [Music] somebody let you know this is what belongs to you amen this is why let me just say it in this manner hebrews 1 3 who being the brightness of his glory and the expressed image of his person upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high. he's already done it already done it he's taking care of everything brother samuel you don't know this need they just came up with this disease i don't care how many more diseases whether they produce them in labs or whatever more it's got it all covered you know what it means to sit down he sat down in power this is not a theosomy body on the throne but now that sacrifice that was raised up it has sat down right there in the throne set till i make thine enemies that footstool amen hallelujah we know where we're standing we're not ignorant of these things had by himself and here in this scripture in verse 4 being made so much better than the angels as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they notice he obtained a more excellent name than they amen notice philippians 2 8 being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross let me just say to you if he would have had to be drug to calvary it wouldn't have been the right sacrifice it had to be willingly if he went willingly satan could have a claim that's right you say this is the virgin spotless lamb of god but remember it had to be a willingly eve was deceived and under deception surrender her will to the devil's life so now to undo that there's only one thing can undo that and that's not in deception but in truth where the will is surrendered to the word completely o glory it comes to address the prophet so he became obedient oh this is a such a key obedient unto death even the death of the cross this was a full surrender of his will amen now remember what we saw at calvary it all began in gethsemane hallelujah we're talking about coming to our inheritance yeah remember this is this is our pattern amen you can't you cannot crawl upon the altar you can't crawl upon the altar and die with the lamb until you first had gethsemane gethsemane is the complete ringing out it's the olive press nevertheless not my will thine will be done there was a struggle that was going on there in gethsemane he prayed three times nevertheless it'd be possible let this cut pass from me a part of him that wanted to live yes but there was a part there that lay on the inside the desire to honor the word of god to desire the purpose of god listen this revelation he had in his heart yes it wasn't a revelation he came to it was a revelation in that hour there was an outworking it was an outworking in his life there right there in gethsemane was where the battle was won that's where the lamb prevailed that's where the lamb overcame why the decision and the submission of his will to the will of the father that's the same with the new birth it's god bringing hearts into gethsemane to where their life it's a complete squeezing out of their life amen to where the will becomes that that's a miracle where the old nature and the spirit agrees with god and then god says okay now it's time to take up your cross it's time to crucify that old man it's time to kill him and bury him amen amen so notice because of what hath taken place wherefore god also hath highly exalted him and given him a name above every name but at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven things in earth things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father peter's standing in acts 5 31 him hath god exalted with his right hand but how how was this exalted it's when he surrendered his will in gethsemane goes to calvary and here he is raised up again triumphant over death hell and the grave he's able to come back to the disciples when he walks with them for 40 days right here in preparation leading into that place of pentecost he's able to tell them reveal to them be of good cheer for i have overcome he's able to minister to them he's there to bring them and to direct them into this place notice what is taking place how did it come to this where what we are observing here where now he comes triumphant over death held the grave and now preparing to be to ascend to the right hand of god it's because first in order to obtain this inheritance his inheritance is his position this was his position amen are you with me this position itself is made known to him right right is that right it was not fully revealed even in acts 1 but it is made known to him brother bram tells us when it is made known to him there in when he ascends and he sets at the right hand of god and we understand it's not a right hand out here but right hand signifies power and authority he sat down him hath got exalted with his right hand now if he did that for him that's the same way it is for you and i this is how that we obtain the inheritance in our own lives you see without him pouring out his soul unto death your eye can never come to that place of dying out to self because it takes the working and leading of the holy spirit to bring us to this place glory be to god you see god the spirit of god will not war contrary to his word he'll always work in harmony with his word what the word is calling for in this hour just as the word called for justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost a cause for the for the indwelling of our inheritance that person that portion in our life you see the word it calls us by the spirit of truth into what god has for us him hath god exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a savior for to give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins acts 2 33 therefore being by the right hand of god exalted and having received of the father the promise of the holy ghost he hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear right now so him the exalting and coming in to his inheritance now is the dividing of our inheritance so the dividing of our inheritance cannot come outside of the propitiation it cannot come outside of the atonement it cannot come outside of the word you see anything outside the word can be a sensation can be an emotion we believe in emotion but our inheritance comes through and by the word when our inheritance as it comes by the word then what does it do it brings a new birth it brings a word experience it brings a transformation it brings a passing from death unto life it brings us back to being sons and daughters of god again but it's all through the path of humility oh my oh glory be to god aren't you glad he deals with us that way aren't you glad he don't ask us to be know-it-alls [Music] he just starts speaking to us as our shepherd and we begin to respond to him as a sheep oh and sure we need our nature changed but there's a part on the inside it's a mystery how it's working how he's dealing and our that old nature and that spirit is starting to line up but he's trying to bring his sons and daughters into a place of adoption into a place a position into a place of inheritance oh glory hallelujah i tell you about how to spell when i got this scripture just started striking my heart in hebrews chapter 10 verse 19 having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus let me just tell you something right now if the devil says you ain't worthy you tell him right now he's a liar listen you don't know what's upon my life i'm telling you the blood has already made a way for you he has already obtained his inheritance his position he's got a right to deal with your life he's got a right to speak to your heart amen jesus is not an indian giver i don't know if that's politically correct or not but you understand what i mean he does not play around with our emotions i'm telling you when god when he's shown an interest in your life you may not even be aware of it you might have been a boy you might have been a teenager and you mere life could have been snuffed out but god had his hand upon your life the devil would have liked to twisted your life put darkness about your life but this is one thing that's for sure god has had his hand upon your life and the same god that's at his hand upon your life is the same god who deals with your while we life him in the corner your mask will keep going and all that has come to me i will in no wise cast out so the devil says it's not for you liar [Applause] the devil said you send your name grace liar you can't be healed liar [Applause] it's already settled you're too late devil boom you're too late he has a sentence and he sent back the holy ghost that which you see and here you're too late devil boo you can't go in a rapture liar hallelujah you'll never overcome that besetting liar hallelujah amen he hath obtained a more excellent name than at the name of jesus every [Applause] every devil has to bow pornography has to bail immorality has to bow is that right amen uncleanliness has to bow envy has to bow drunkenness has to bow homosexuality has to power he's already paid the price what do i need to do accept it accept it this is your day this is your day [Applause] this is your moment oh i'm not beside myself i'm speaking by his anointing this is our moment this is our day [Applause] this is your day to walk out of here free you don't got to wait to a certain time to have your gethsemane right where the word's going forth you can let go and say thy will be done in my life he's put everything under his feet we don't see all things yet we still see dying in the body but there's a witness in our heart [Applause] there's not a demon there's not an unclean spirit there's not a devil that can raise its tongue in condemnation and declare that there's weakness in the atonement there is a bride that is anointed by the spirit of almighty god she's got a focus to enter to the throne we're looking at the true atonement the mercy is in full view and we've got a right to go free [Applause] [Music] hello we got a boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus amen brother joy if you or i would have tried to walk in that tabernacle they just stopped us remember they got on paul about timothy even titus gentiles could only tread in the outer court there's no way we could get back into the holiest of holies there's a song by the chain that's ringing in my heart when i couldn't go where he was he came to me and i couldn't get there i didn't even have faith to rise up but he came to me amen he came to you sister amanda he came to you and you didn't have faith to rise up and he lets you know i've done it for you he lets you know the chastisement of your peace has been put on me i took the thing of crowns i bore that i bore the mind battle so you can walk free hallelujah this is our victory in jesus christ let me just finish reading this scripture here this boldness to enter in by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us [Music] through the veil that is to say his flesh is that right how what did he say concerning his flesh except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you you must be a partaker of that word amen hallelujah when abram got itself all whipped out then here came melchizedek hallelujah and abram what did he do there was a lot of other kings a lot of other kings kings of sodom you put whatever names you want to put on they were kings in that day these were rich people in that day these are people that were who's who in that day but in the midst of all those kings that was around there was one king that stood out to him amen that was melchizedek he never gave a tenth of all to the king of sodom [Music] come on now hallelujah this is why your ties you just don't hand your ties to anywhere either ties belong to god it don't belong it don't belong to brother samuel it belongs to god you ain't paying them to brother santa used to god but you see that's that's only a type a tenth of what already belongs to him see what you're doing is giving to him what is already rightfully his but he's entrusted you with him he entrusted you with it will you in turn release that that's only a type of his desire for the tenth of our life the tenth being the first fruit the tenth the tithe being the choice of our life he did not want our body he did not want our spirit he wanted to have our heart hallelujah that the tenth of our life would be surrendered amen to our melchizedek that in the midst of great kings all around it was something about it at that time you know how you read in the scripture at that time the how that abraham surrenders unto him i tithe the tenth of all hallelujah because you see even in that tithe and that tenth notice has the words come back to abraham blessed be abram of the most high god not one of those other kings now those other kings might have been able to talk about man you've got a lot of talents abraham look at you you're able to take sheep multiply man i tell you man you got a lot of good talents my you're you're a good businessman abraham you're good now these are things that they could see these are things as far as with those kings that they could see but this king he saw something much greater those kings just like in your life those kings can only point out certain maybe traits and attributes and things that you have and god gave you those attributes god gave you those traits he did not put you here in earth without things in your life that might come forth in order to provide for yourself but it's all him providing but yet this king when he comes he's the one who reveals to you not that oh you're an engineer or you're obtained you're a great worker with wood my abraham you're a great farmer my you know how to work the sheep no no he reveals to him you're a god you're of god listen to me abraham heard the call of god he's already heard the promises of god but now when he meets melchizedek melchizedek identifies him blessed be abraham of the most high god [Music] he consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh he opened the way for you and i am amen in order for us to come back to our inheritance he had to make a way so he consecrated this way he said when he stood here i am the way the truth and the life and i say he steal still tonight or this morning the truth the life it's still the word that goes forth that discerns the very thoughts and intents of our hearts and having a high priest look at this and having a high priest over the house of god let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let me read just one more scripture can i do that second corinthians 5 16 wherefore henceforth know we know man after the flesh yea though we have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more he opened the way he consecrated the way and notice how paul is identifying this it's very very important when paul went up to the upper coast of of ephesus in acts chapter 19. he spoke to some believers and when he started speaking to them paul started noticing by their their dialogue where they were at and he asked the question to them have you received the holy ghost since ye believed believing starts it out you don't get the holy ghost and then start doing it amen but it's the holy spirit that starts dealing with your heart through the word amen he starts dealing with your life through the word let me just say this here i've been off my notes on and over and so we just go sometimes even setting here some of you know this by your own testimony you're not even aware of the word how it's having an impact on your life some of you made a surrender to god as far as turning your life over and you weren't even inside of this church building god woke you up in the middle of a night and you realize i don't want to go this way you started to feel conviction that you'd never felt before there's things that you no longer can put on conviction you say what was that it was a holy spirit dealing with your heart you see this is a work how god here is god dealing with your life god working with your life and you might have been trying your best to just suppress it and just say i've got it under control i'm a good person you know i love god i don't think evil of god and you're going about in that way but remember as we said that's just the enemy trying to tell you you're all right don't give in but god rich in mercy is making claims and the holy spirit what's he doing he's searching you out in obedience to the word he searches out that hard and he draws that heart he draws that life and conviction begins to strike that heart here they were standing in acts 19 they had believed these these were individuals they had believed but you see they couldn't go any further than the word that was being ministered to them you see what's revealed a man can only preach what's revealed to him this is why listen to me this is why you don't look down on pentecostals we don't look down on methodists we don't look down this is why brother brown told us he said look don't trouble the methodist don't trouble the pentecostals sure we witness but he says if they're happy on this side of jordan let them alone if that's all the further that they can come to let them alone but there's a call in your heart to go across jordan you're responsible to answer the deed that's calling to the deal you can't decide and say well i think i'll just be a foolish virgin you can't decide that [Applause] you need to deal with the issue well i'll just be this deal with the issue why settle for a partial deliverance because there's no such thing you want a total deliverance and there is a total deliverance in jesus christ [Music] and they said we have not heard whether there be any holy ghost or not you see the atonement had not been preached to them it had been preached that this is the atonement this is right on this is jesus jesus is matching their scriptures remember apollos their pastor was proving that the message was the message of the hour i mean that christ are you helping me now that christ indeed was the fulfillment but they needed to know the token has come this is what paul is dealing with we don't know no man after the flesh anymore just to know the word is to know the flesh but you've got to go beyond the veil you've got to go into the word by one spirit we are baptized into the word you've got to go into the land it's in the air is where our inheritance lays powers letting them know our inheritance is revealed by the power of the holy ghost the true atonement that comes back and lets you and i know that this is for you i am your portion [Applause] [Music] hallelujah glory be to god therefore if any man be in christ he's a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of god well i wish i could preach on that right now hallelujah this is not your work are you with me this is not your efforts you see the spirit of god it deals with your life in justification and sanctification but what you're doing he is working and equipping you in preparation for the finishing and the capping of your life it's him working all along but now once he comes fully into you through a full surrender it's not your efforts any longer it's not a wrestling the battle has been won the battle that was won and gethsemane that battle that's raging within you he comes to settle that bound [Music] then you got the soldier on the inside then you've got greater is he that is in me than he that's in the world then you've got i can do all things through christ who stresses me all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation that ministry of reconciliation is his work his spirit by his word continuing his same work the works that i do shall you do also it's a continuation it's a ministry of reconciliation what is the word doing the word the ministry of reconciliation doesn't try to reconcile us to a church that's what a church tries to do sign your name right here that won't do you a bit of good you need more than ballpoint pen to take away your sin debt income never erase it you can try to scratch it out blot it out you can use white out white tape everything it'll never do the trick there's only one thing that can take away sin and that's the blood of jesus christ once you've been once you have believed then you can start and you start yielding and then the blood starts working you say how do i know the blood's working on me brother samuel i i still find myself out of battle but you know that blood's working there's things that you want you once could not surrender but you surrendering it there's things little by little that god's dealing with your life you find things fleeing and going it ain't you trying to quit things it's those things quitting you oh i feel like preaching it ain't you quitting it's the holy spirit equipping you and what's happening you're being reconciled [Applause] he's getting that old nature that spirit to line up with him there's a reconciling not with that old nature he's trolling it to a place of death that the new man might come forth this is what the ministry of reconciliation is on the day of atonement when the blood was shed and the jubilee was sounded it was a priest that would ride throughout the land and that priest would take that rand's horn and he would announce by blowing the rams horn for those who were in the fields and couldn't see the blood that was shed they didn't hear the lamb quivering but the sound let them know the blood has been shed for you the sound let them know that your debt has been paid the sound let them know you can go free you don't have to barter with that spirit run down you don't have to negotiate throw it down say i'm done with you i'm finished with you devil amen glory be to god i'm telling you it's not the sound of brother samuel neither am i the ram's horn but that ramshorn of the vindicated word in this hour that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever brother he is right here among us that same one to stand for you [Music] you can receive that here this morning there's not a devil that can remain [Applause] he's conquered he's nothing but a bluff he's lying to you accept the word that speaks and proclaims liberty doubt your doubts and believe the word this is redemption of sons and daughters of god to it i'm trying to close on this to it that god was in christ notice to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and have committed unto us the word of reconciliation this is a word of atonement amen a word that's able you can walk into here and hear you in christ are standing as two but this is a word that's able to bring such a reconciling to where when you walk out of here you're no longer twain but you walk out one it's a power of this word drawing you beyond your unbelief drawing you beyond your doubts [Music] drawing you beyond your past that's not really you that's not who you really are that's why the word it deals with your life it's letting you know and that's why you feel uncomfortable that's why sin is no longer comfortable that's why you look at drinking and saying why do i have to keep doing this i hate this i don't want to keep on doing this it's because there's a god who's calling to you and let you know i have set you free not just of drunkenness not just of alcohol but a god who set you free from your old nature [Applause] it's the same god to it just as god was in christ so is the fullness of the godhead of bodily in his bride body continuing on the work sounding the trumpet proclaiming the acceptable year of the lord let me just tell you we're in the season right now this is not just a calling of the soul it's not just that of bringing us into a place of a complete birth but brother this this word it leads us clear into the very change of the body we're standing we're standing where the prophets have longed to stand [Music] we're standing in the place where brother branham said i hope i'm alive to see him the word is at work he's reconciling hearts to himself he sent his word and his word will not return back to him void hallelujah he's come to call you home he's come to call you home let me just say this look close paul would let them know in that day in the book of romans the word that's being preached the word that's being spoken as we read right here he's declaring to them more scripture we could we could continue to read through but you come to this place he has obtained his inheritance and he's the one that has come to divide to us our inheritance it's our allotted portion in him in the word this is why when the world says who are you what church do you belong to i'm a christian well yeah yeah yeah yeah so am i well where do you go to church do you tell them where you go to church well i've never heard of that but what organization is that well we're not an organization you're not an organization no or i mean what the nomination is or non-denomination right we believe all the word comma and all he will continue to reveal we're not stopping we're not taking some man's name yeah i don't want to be identified by the name of an organization right now some people have called us branamites i got ran down like that the very first job that i had oh you're a brown of mine what a privilege [Laughter] [Applause] that scripture you know first john 3 beloved what manner of love the father hath bestowed on us that we should be called the sons of god for the world knew him not even so he knoweth us not that's right but if you're going to call me abrahamic because i followed this message so be it that's right but this message is not a man this message is the person of jesus christ revealed amen say what you want to say everything i'm a christian hallelujah and it's because of this message that god sent yes it's the spirit of atonement that has come to bring the true atonement in full view this is why are you is it okay this is why the preaching is not is not just to say well if a man if thou believe with thine heart and shall confess with thy mouth thou shalt be saved we say amen you've got to have a start are you with me you've got to have a start man but keep the scripture believeth unto salvation you've got to believe first right but before you can believe you've got to hear the truth you got to hear the truth and then what does the truth do the truth reaches to your heart and you say i believe amen you can't explain but it just you believe it ain't that you understand but all the peace and cues and everything put together what you believe it's something your heart you're just something within you says yes yes you're hearing that word you surrender your heart to god say lord forgive me in my sins that's right all right then why don't i this is me i don't believe anybody can see calvary in the right way and you say i accept it if you see it in the right way it breaks you up in here he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my iniquities the chastisement of samuel's peace was upon him by his stripes samuel was healed [Music] there's something to you simon you're talking about emotion let me just tell you something i'm not resting on emotion but you tell me how you get seed in the ground you got to break the ground up first and when the ground the bible says break up follow ground and then seed comes in to think of what someone done for you you may never have cried in your life you may not have felt sorrowful in your life before but when it touches your heart in that way and you realize there's one who has stood for me you say lord i'm finished with this life yeah that's right samuel i don't know how i'm going to stop all these things i know right where you are been there been there that devil tried to hold me back from surrendering my life by looking at all the baggage i was carrying all the habits and everything was in my life you know he's trying to do bring fear you're not going to be able to sustain it i wasn't calling myself amen he was calling me amen all i had to do is the same way that each of you and some of you today is just believe what he has already done for you amen amen and then confession with the mouth is made right what's your confession i'm saved i'm a christian you walk out and someone said let me see how long i'll give you a month you'll be back at it that's a devil that's trying to hold you back what do you do you're not confessing what you've done you're not confessing what you're able to do you're confessing what he has come and made known to you that i have purchased the way for you he comes and opens up that way and lets you know i've consecrated this way [Music] brother brian they tell me that when you come into those arches those arches depict where a triumphant one has walked you're talking about in the east those triumphs those arches they depict a triumphant where one comes through let me tell you something there's no defeat in the blood of jesus christ this is the ark of triumph there were two pillars that were standing but he on resurrection morning became the keystone amen he became the arch amen he put his hand on a holy god and upon i said what did he do he made a way back for you and i that we could come back he spanned the chasm [Music] he consecrated the way. there's not a devil that can shut that way off there's not a man in his warp thinking can shut it off by saying that the day of mercy is past foolishness the lord this is still the apostolic age is still in session hallelujah as many as the lord our god shall call the way is still open and the light has come in this hour that you and i might see the way. [Music] you say what way it's a way so that it's not just a church we'll come here and we'll we'll help you do this and we'll help you do that no no this is a consecrating of the way what way he is the way it's into him where there's real life it's a real inheritance in him amen and you confess with your mouth and believe unto you well you do keep believing you keep walking now i know i'm speaking to some that haven't i'm speaking to hearts right now this morning there's hearts right here that god is dealing with very personally he's called out things very personal in your life the greatest thing you could do is to honor him that same one he's right here among us [Music] he's the same angel of the lord and you keep walking you keep believing you keep letting the word draw you you keep letting the word as the word is working your life what do i do brother samuel you keep on giving yourself to the word you keep on surrendering you keep on consecrating and you watch you're watching you're beholding it's not you quitting and dropping habits it's habits quitting hallelujah i end it with this no matter where you're at if you're standing here in your inheritance let me remind you in your inheritance speak the word you've got a need in your life right here this morning maybe you've got loved ones maybe there's a sickness in your body you've got authority to speak the word it's not out here the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth what god it may not have even come out through this this this mouth through these voice these vocal cords but the spirit of god dealing with your heart he stirs something up there's something he deals with in your heart what should i do the word of god is nigh thee yes even in thy mouth the word of faith which we preach i would stand upon that right there and i would call that which is not i would move under that inspiration listen move under that pulsation move under that inspiration with the holy spirit amen our heavenly father

came that we might really have life that that word lord it means beyond what one can even imagine [Music] i'm come that you might have life and have it more abundantly beyond what you can even imagine

your neighbor or somebody else you're responsible for the light that god is showing you so if you'll walk in that light that he's revealing what he's dealing with your heart you say how do i walk in
