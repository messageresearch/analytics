that submitted to brother George so um if you're uh looking at that if you haven't put that down uh please do so and um then when all they when they come in then we can worry about all all that that payment then and so forth but I've also mentioned to you if there's someone that um you know we've had different donations but I told you this in the beginning if if someone if something just seems a little bit um tight or whatever more just let me know because I I I I want to put one in your hand and um and I mean that don't don't don't be too proud don't be too proud I mean after all a dozen of eggs anymore you can make a car payment with them that's right that's right that's good that's good so we're here to help one another amen and I to me that's just I just want to see the the the word just get in your hands amen I want to say God bless you and uh it's good to have our visitors here with us this morning God bless you amen and uhen now Dusty I was talking about you and your wife you you all just you're regulars now but um so good to be gathered together and we want to just continue to hold one another up in prayer let's go to the word thank you musicians I want to go into uh the scriptures here this morning and I want to go to Psalms 5 45 and uh no doubt it's a little bit of a different of a scripture reading but in my heart here the other uh the other morning and um we have uh we came through such a wonderful time there last week in service and um and I just um when I came back in here on Tuesday there's thoughts I couldn't just couldn't get off my heart and then I you know you just wait on the Lord just to build if there is something to it and and then on Thursday when I um it just seemed to really come that much more stronger so I just want to really lay in this morning just some direction on even on how we move forward when God has done something like that for us and things have been exposed and complexes and holds have been broken and uh I just want to just want to move forward on that here this morning so in Psalms 45:9 it says King's Daughters were among thy honorable women upon thy right hand did stand the queen in Gold of ofer hearken oh daughter and consider and incline thine ear forget also thine own people and thy father's house so shall thy King greatly desire thy Beauty for he is thy Lord and worship thou him just skip to verse 13 with me the King's Daughter is all glorious within her clothing is of rot gold and she shall be brought unto the king in reignment of needle work the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee and with gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought they shall enter into the king's Palace amen may God bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I'd like to just speak to you here this morning for a few moments on operating by the law of freedom and I want to kind of draw your attention back to that beginning of the verse maybe some of you still have your if you have your Bible open if you don't that's fine but if you'll notice that that whom it is that would even write this by inspiration it's not David but it's that of the sons of Kora and if you think about it for a moment these these would be of individuals that would there would be linkage and traces back to that very one of their great great great great great great great great grandfather that rose up against the message of the hour and yet he that within where they're standing for them and this is not the only one those of you as a Bible reader you know that going through the Psalms you will find in many cases where inspiration has moved upon that of the sons of Kora and I want to say it in this way as we even look in light and in view of this uh chapter I find it so fitting that for them to be able to express in many of the other writings that your scriptures that you can refer to that they themselves had to be able to look past and overcome their own birth they had to be able to look past all of the negative Heritage that Sur surrounded them and God gave them Grace and you know how God gave them Grace is because they honored the word of God there's no other way for Grace to be transmitted into our lives you know we Grace is is is meant to be a reflection in our life something that truly we don't deserve we can never ever Merit the grace of God that's why it's Grace but Grace is what you and I would receive and accept from God and tell you it's truly in many of the times when we think about it in our own lives we look at our own lives we we see ourselves many times in the mirror and we know our shortcomings uh we know our mistakes we know all of those things about us and yet the word of God as it would pulsate and move in our hearts it just stirs within us and it causes us to believe to look Beyond even our own circumstances and our own conditions and it's things that even even as God would deal with our lives that you know even yet here this morning that the Lord is still bringing out of our lives and is still building our faith and still causing us to recognize who we are I mean many of us can Fellowship on this that you know we went for a long time and it doesn't matter if you're raised in a message Church raised in a church or not but everyone has to have their own personal experience with the Lord Jesus Christ coming to church is a wonderful thing but it's got to be more than Church there's got to be a personal experience with the Living God to where that God brings a real change on the inside and he he change he takes away every all the desires of the world and he gives us a strength and there's a real newness of life and and then how that God would even work from that part because you know it all starts with even God beginning to make known to us who we are that we are Sons and Daughters of God and you know I can remember when God began to deal with my life it wasn't at that moment that exactly my flesh or that I begin to turn in the ways of the Lord but God begin to deal with my heart and there was things that begin to be spoken and said out of my mouth and I would say I know I'm not going to be this way forever I know someday I'm going to serve the Lord it was odd for that to even be said even considering the direction and the way that I was even heading and even in that night and so forth but you know it was something about it that would just you know God was dealing with my heart did I fully realize it no I didn't but it's God that begins to deal with our hearts and begins to make known what rightfully belongs to you and I to let us know that you and I we were always a son and daughter of God and you know it takes the word coming with divine grace to build our faith to be able to believe what the word is saying and to accept it and to begin to act upon that word that that takes a real Supernatural uh h h h a leading and move of God to come upon our lives and so these are things as I would want to just say is that when we read this as the text and the scripture would admonish um here o of the queen and I want to just put you and I in this verse of scripture right here hearken oh daughter and consider and incline thine ear and forget also thine people and thy father's house so shall the king greatly desire thy Beauty for he is thy Lord worship thou him now when it speaks of forgetting thine own people the queen is no longer standing in her own country that's good she's no longer in the land of of her own Nativity right she's she's in places that no doubt she never imagined that she would be but she's standing in the very courts of the king and how the king would express to her in that time to forget thine own people now he wasn't talking to her as though in a manner just you know just block it out of your mind but this word forget means go de even goes deeper is that you are not the same person that you were when the word found you and the same word that brought a transformation in your soul and changed your nature is the same God that will lead you to tear down every other altar in your life it'll lead you and guide you to take down every other excuse every other place where there's been hurts there's been wounds that have caused certain responses in our lives this is what the grace of God will do as we hearken to the word of God I tell you I want to give his word preeminence above my thoughts I want to give it because his word is the final say the Bible said that that in the presence of the king at his right hand is fullness of joy It also says that with a king's word there is power and so we want to receive the word of God and to even think how did God would come in this hour through a message and would begin to announce and declare to you and I I want you just to listen to this he he says concerning the Bride of Jesus Christ her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest there is no f in her she is all glorious within and without from beginning to end she's the work of her Lord and all his works are perfect in fact in her is summed up and manifested the Eternal wisdom and purpose of God how can one fathom it how can one understand it though we cannot do that we accept it by faith for God hath spoken it am yes sir so the thing that that we lock in upon what the word is is speaking concerning our lives and that's what we want to be attentive to is how the word is speaking over our hearts and our lives and say God be it unto me according to Thy word and let us rise to that of the word taking the word above our own feelings above our own thoughts above our own circumstances because the word of of God is more true it's real it's sure it is greater than symptoms yes it is I want you to think of this here brother Brown deals with this here of how that you know he talks about how that you know with the ministry and how that life has has come about and you know a lot of things he talks about he can remember in the early days how things were and he speaks of how that you know he he remembers a lot of those things when the gifts and things were manifesting and you know through the first Parts in his ministry and he said but how that Ministry has come higher and Gifts has multiplied he said but somehow or another I I just wish I was back like I was at the beginning in the first place and he said you know uh sometimes we we you know just forget a lot of things that that they we ever learned and I I think it'd be a lot better and he's dealing with how that through time there's a lot of things that can accumulate and things can happen that work to try to discourage and break confidence I I want to just say this to you very clearly Satan's objective is to try to break confidence in the word of God you see if he can get you to doubt your weapon he's got you whipped you've got to believe your weapon and let me just tell you your weapon is not your feelings right the weapon is the word of God the Lord Jesus when God came down and became one of us he brought it to such a place he was at the weakest point after 40 days and you know why he did that he did that he was just a show but he came there to show you and I that even in the time of greatest of weakness in facing Temptation and test that there was a strength that you and I could hold to that's greater than our feelings he said brother Ram said like this God brought it down to the place to where the weakest Christian could take the word of God and begin to stand on that word and Satan will not have any place to [Applause] stand Hallelujah you ought to just get some Elbow Room right now because let me tell you it's it's a word of God that would begin to dispel the enemy you begin to entertain God's word entertain the promises of God you begin to speak the word of God and I'm telling you the devil's not going to hang around oh he'll try to linger a little bit but you just let him know if you're going to stay here you're going to get an earful if you want to be an ease dropper go ahead and stick around you want to get on this party line go ahead and stick around but I am going to stand upon God's word you said brother Samuel that sounds like foolishness it ain't foolishness the Bible said in Revelations 12 they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony we know exactly where we're standing on God's word that's right hallu Hallelujah and this word that you and I have been given in Revelations 19 it speaks that as we have been called to the married supper of the Lamb a word that has given you and my confidence to accept the wedding garment the adornment of the righteousness of the Saints and be adorned with that and be called to the marriage supper of the Lamb let me tell you what's calling you and I the true sayings of God Amen let me tell you what's breaking Gloom and doubt and darkness and unbelief true says of God you say what are you talking about true saying I'm talking about God's thoughts what God thought and what he spoke here in the word man is tried to get a hold of it and I don't necessarily say that man meant anything wrong but unless God brings a visitation in a generation how can we know God's thoughts we're confined to man's isms and man's wonderings and man's recitations of the word but when God comes down he himself is the word and he speaks his word across the generation and there are a people that are ordained for that word word to strike our hearts to absorb it and become Sons and Daughters of God there's nothing else that can bring that reality out of our Lives Hallelujah now I want you to think things accumulate time things build and brother BR says it like this he says I think the road to God is through the path of humility and service I think there's nothing no better in the world to lift us up to Christ than that he said you get to see carnal impersonations and so forth it dolls you and puts something in you I wish it didn't do it he said but I think it gets you in the state of complex when you should not be there you should just keep all things away and move on let me just settle it like this right here there's always going to be carnal impersonations right you might have say well I've been let down by preachers but let me tell you if one a man that gave Ephesians 4 God is the one who gave Ephesians 4 that is so good you might have say well you know I had this said over me or this was prophesied over let me tell you man didn't put that in the church God put it in the church and Satan only wants to try with to try to bring carnal impersonations this is why that he works upon situations to try to bring uh doubt concerning the word of God when people can look and they can see a person's life and oh they were professed to be a Christian this one was to be a a preacher this one said they were a prophet and this one and that and you know his whole point he likes let me just tell you something Satan likes to put poster people up and try to put that up as though that that is an example of God's word that is no example of God's word this is why the word of God must be taken deeper than our minds it's got to be more than just something we agree with it begins there but it's got to go to the depths of our life to where it brings about a change and the word of God is what's burning on the inside of us then we've got real Christians we've got real Believers with a real experience and it's not us trying to impersonate something but it is Christ himself reflecting his own life through us hallelujah we've got to we got all of those things like that the prophet has given some direction that really applies to all of our Lives I want you to watch that last part of that quote this gets you in the state of complex in the realm of thinking and trying to deaden and trying to take away from the supernatural but it shouldn't be there you should keep all things away and move on yes now let me just say it keep it away and move on don't just keep it away cuz you're still where it's at keep it away move on that is so keep it away move on two things now the scripture tells us thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee amen Philippians 46 and 7 be careful for nothing that's don't be anxious but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be made known unto God whatever your need is that you have upon your heart here this morning right even while the word's coming forth be in in prayer and supplication is where you're letting your request be made known to God prayer begins with worship supplication is where you begin to release what it is that desires on your heart and here's how you do it with Thanksgiving amen because it's finished if we can recognize it's already a finished work God doesn't have to come down and take one more stripe sir let me just tell you something Calvary was sufficient when he went to Calvary he said it is finished right there at Calvary he broke the Devil's Back Hallelujah he went to the lowest parts of Hell Hallelujah and you know why you say why because he had all the past present and future sin he was our sin Bearer he took all the sin and he bore it right there you know what he did he put it right back where it [Applause] belongs let me tell you something you're your body your life your heart your life your mind is not a fit place for unbelief that's what the word comes to do to cast it out Hallelujah and he rose on that Easter morning he took Satan's Keys away to his own house right is that right Satan don't even got the keys to his own house let me tell you something he came and he announced the victory hallu is that right and when that Victory itself was announced and they themselves were rejoicing in that victory of the word it brought forth victory iory then in their lives when they went in the upper room and as they themselves were filled with the same Holy Spirit and they came out speaking in new tongues you know what they came out they came out it was understandable Jesus Christ is Lord he is risen he is exalted he has conquered every devil every sickness every disease every habit he is the mighty conqueror they spoke in other tongues [Applause] Hallelujah you might say here this morning I'm hearing you sp I'm I'm hearing you but I'm not hearing you out of the tongues oh yes you are you are hearing me speak of the glory of God and the mighty conquerer you're understanding it and that's what took place on the day of Pentecost how hear we every man in our own tongue you are hearing God personally for your own life you're hearing God personally speak to you he's revealing himself I am thy Redeemer I am thy savior I am thy Lord you are the Sheep of my pasture hallelujah oh I think you need a new [Applause] tongue Hallelujah Oh Glory that is so and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Jesus Christ the prophet said while we're here I want you to get all the superstitions away from you I want you to get settled down and make yourself subject to the holy spirit that God can move through you and bring the benefits of his Blessing now I want you to look here in the scriptures in Exodus 14 now I'm going to I'm taking from here and I want to build forward now in Exodus 14 here Israel has come out they've been delivered from the hand of Egypt God sent a word that he promised through Abraham God sent God rose up a man by the name of Moses that's right is that right he got him separated God anointed the faith that was in his heart right is that right right and God then sends him back now sends it word he sends it with with by a prophet and it's accompanied with the pillar of fire that's and then when Israel think of it how am I going to get out of this Egypt a strong military power how am I going to get out of this situation where I'm all hemmed in and seems like isolated but God brought it down to the Simplicity of let every man take a lamb to his house and taking that lamb it spoke of the Lord Jesus Christ it's taking him for your life taking him for your situation and they had to slay that lamb and take the blood of the lamb and they had to apply it on the doorpost right here and above they did not put it on the threshold cuz you never walk over the blood you're always to come under the blood you see when you come under the blood that's where there's Victory so they walk out of there but then God stirs up this with pharaoh and you think about it you think my I mean here they were rejoicing man thankful I tell you praise God we're we're on our way and we don't have to worry about any more slime pits or anything else wonderful thing but God was also arranging he had already arranged a moment to take care of their pursuers let me just tell you something the things sometimes that you can look at in your life like they did at the Red Sea that you can think what in the world am I up against how is this situation maybe this is something that has occurred again but if you'll just be still and look to God God will take a situation that looks so Bleak to you in your eyes but he himself will manifest his glory and he will consume your pursuers are you hearing me this morning God God knows what he's doing he's a faithful General he knows how to lead his people now I want you to notice when they came here Moses speaks he prophesies and then he tells them in verse 14 the Lord's going to fight for you right and you hold your peace right in other words what you're seeing the Earth trembling from their from their horses hold your peace don't say nothing now you said Brother Sam I thought we believe in confession we do but God also knows for you and I when we need do not utter anything that's contrary hold your peace and here's what God told Moses speak unto the children children of Israel that they go forward you see that's where the real true reality of the word of God it should be causing you and I to go forward not backward forward because we're pressing on notice Paul said I'm pressing toward the mark that is before me we're in a race is that right there's a Finish Line there's a goal in sight so the word comes to encourage us that we move forward now let me just read this part to you uh I want to come back into this uh quote and I want to draw from this particular quotation that I read from last week where remember the little sister that was you know she was just uh encompassed with fear and a complex and that was about her life and you know when God moved down and broke that broke that hold she even asked the question do you believe I'll be well and and and you know brother BR said I certainly believe you will and he said what it was of that complex that had you so it had it was wrapped around you but the power of it just broke Hallelujah now watch what the direction that he gives her I I know I mentioned this but I'm I'm drawn back to this he told her just keep believing right press right on go forward speak yeah see the it's it's already been broke from around her life now she's got to leave right where that's at right you understand you we can't continue to dwell and and dwell within that this is part of God's Direction and how we operate by the law of freedom I I'm getting to that point this is where we keep believing press right on go forward and speak because of what God has done for you the same God that breaks the power of the complex is the same God that will give you strength to stand there day after day and press forward and keep speaking to it I don't care if the devil takes your voice you can still lip it hallah cuz let me tell you it ain't the strength of your voice that backs the devil up it's the faith in your heart that Satan has to recognize [Applause] Hallelujah you just go on and be well everything will be all right notice stand right up to it you're all right the blessing's on you if you'll just keep going I want to just say it freedom is going to require something of [Music] you Freedom requires something of you notice the direction in Paul Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty wherewith Christ hath made yes free and be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage that means to stand firm to persevere so it's it is in our we have been entrusted to maintain our Liberty you believe that this is what Paul is saying don't don't get entangled back don't get caught back don't don't get don't get drawn back but stand fast in the Liberty where with Christ have made you free that's where we're to be drawing from now let me just say it to you like this with freedom will require something of us I want to remind you that the prophet he tells you and I you must keep the spirit of Revival in you amen good prach yeah that that's an that's an obligation he says You must stay in the spirit of Revival now think about this if he's telling us you must do that it shows there's going to be oppositions that are against us and let's just be honest there's sometimes where it's not something that's alog together it's just the enemy coming and running everything down sometimes he just wants to drop a little something your way but I want you to remember Queen I want you to look where you're standing so what are you talking about here Psalms 45 the queen she is all glorious with it I want to remind you where you're standing remind you you are in the presence of the king Esther you did not bring yourself here you were summonsed by a love letter that pulled upon your life and you submitted to the cleansing and the sanctifying you submitted to the adornment of the word look where you're standing come on friends I think it's time that we as the scripture say forgive get th th thine father's house we need to forget and say and immediately when you see going into that same way and that acting about things and going about it we need to take the authority of the word if the word has told you and I when you feel you have an inferiority complex or some sort of a complex take exactly the opposite is that right then then if the word is speaking to us about that God is not going to come down and handle us like a puppet but he's entrusting you and I as Sons and Daughters of God but what matters is is whether we're going to rely on our feelings or go according to how we've always done come on friends just stay with me now right now notice what here we are looking at this law of Liberty James says in James 1: 25 lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgiveth what manner of man he was but who so lookth into the perfect law of Liberty and continueth therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed very simple the word of God is is a clear mirror and God comes right through his word and he makes things known to our lives now I believe as we'll stay in the spirit of God I believe that as we're staying in step with God I believe that God can speak to our lives while you're reading in your devotion I believe that I I I believe that while you're listening to the message at home God can speak to you staying in that channel right and it doesn't cause you as an individual to go off on your own but you see we're we're lined up in a channel where God can speak to us is that right but when we look at this what James is talking about is when we have seen ourselves and then going away and forgetting what manner of man that we saw in the mirror now if you look at this last verse here in verse 25 the word does not just come to point out all of your deficiencies all right it don't do that you see this is why that we don't need a new mirror God himself he unfolded his word in this hour right because if man gets a hold of the same Bible that you and I have and they'll take a hold of that and they'll put scriptures here and scriptures there and and it and it has things looking in a way as though well this is a Christian and this is a Believer but reality of it is a Christian is one who has repented of their sins that have been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they are looking to the Lord Jesus Christ for their salvation and then it leads us into a place to become a spirit filled Christian is that right you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost but God he unveils the mirror and here he is uncovering it so that you and I are look and not just seeing our deficiencies but the way that we see our shortcomings is because there's a clear image of the perfect one the unveiled God who is standing in our midst and the word Hebrews 4:12 the word is quick it's alive it is powerful it's sharper than any two-edged sword it cuts us under separating the bone from the morrow the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart it's Christ the unveiled one who is standing before us and we see our weakness we see our need but here's what's important what we do after we see what we see that's right and you know what that you know where that comes in that's where Freedom requires something of us it it requires something for us Stand Fast in the Liberty it requires something of our life of our walk to be a doer of the word it end about our feelings there sometimes here here we are we come out of this oh it's wonderful in this atmosphere right here but when you come out of there tomorrow morning you may not feel this atmosphere right but what are you going to do then well I got to get back to another atmosphere don't let the devil lie to you like that you you don't got to Chase from atmosphere to atmosphere and you become you from here to here to here and you're looking for some kind of Russ and build up but let me just tell you the Bible says the word of God is not the even in thy mouth are you hearing me friends you see what the devil likes to do and people can chase here and Chase there and Chase there and it's it's chasing about atmospheres and feelings but you let me just tell you something God has built you and I to be able to live Victorious right where he's placed [Applause] us brother B tells us he said God's not one he's not strong in one area and weak in another see this is what builds our walk as a Believer is not our feelings I love to feel God's presence am man I love it like I feel it when I when I come in here what I feel right now I love that but there's days I don't feel [Applause] [Music] it that's true there's days I don't feel worthy I'm because of anything I don't feel worthy some days it feels like well he's away from me my my my but you see this is where our feelings is not what we're based upon let me try to get here somewhere looking into the perfect law of Liberty as we look into the word the word itself staying with that word even as we leave out of the house of God it's staying with that word whatever word that God has given you you take that word and you whip the devil every day of the week are you hearing me tomorrow morning you whip the devil so good I'm going somewhere don't worry now you see this here operating by the laws of Freedom you know brother Ram would give this examples over and over it's like if you had you know well this over here we had a field over there that used to have soy beans in it and I don't care you know we had if we had an artisian well on this property right here and that might be burning that crop up I've got water here that crop needs water but it'll do me no good to scream at the top of my voice water get over there it won't work but there is a law there is a law of gravitation that can take that which is here and put it over there and there's a law that God has given that will break that will bring what you and I have need of in our life and that is the law of faith is so good it'll it'll cause the word it'll bring it from where it enters in and we say Amen to the word of God and man it's wonderful it tastes good but remember you got to take it on down right it's good right here sweet as honey but down here is where it gets bitter it ain't the word that's bitter it's the word itself that is going to work against parasites in your life the word is going against things in your life I'm telling you it's power in this word you take the word in and it begins to work those things out in your life Hallelujah yes sir this is why don't lose sight of the vision what Vision you talking about the word what God has spoke to your heart and when that word strikes into your life you take that word no matter what no matter how you feel you take that word and that promise let me just say this to you like this Joseph I could read this but I'm not going to Joseph was down in Egypt let me tell you he didn't ask to be down there that's that's right he could have he Joseph could have played the victim mentality card Daniel could have done the same thing come on friends they could have said hey why am I here it ain't my fault I'm not the one who asked to be down in Egypt my brothers threw me down in a pit took my coat did this did that let me ask you this right now if he would have had that kind of an attitude now not saying that he didn't have those feelings are you with me I'm not making cuz we ain't making nobody Superman here we're not reading Marvel Comics we're reading the Bible and the Bible doesn't highlight man it highlights God in man he had to battle thoughts when he laid there on his bed he did not understand what was taking place as a 17-year-old boy God gave him a dream but he had no idea what he'd have to go through before itd come to pass but you know what it was what it was it had was no problem with the dream God had to bring the man in a fit condition for the dream to come to pass you see there's no problem with the word but it's God working out to bring his people into a place for the word to come to pass and you know what it's the word working the whole time you know what it's working in Joseph life that Vision was working the whole time Hallelujah good well he laid there he cried wept no doubt at night you think feelings didn't try to come back to him come on he was human it's just like when somebody's done you wrong or said something or whatever more don't tell me you say oh brother Samuel I've forgiven him let's just be honest and stop pretending you can forgive somebody but let me just tell you sometimes you can have feelings come back but you have to go contrary to those feelings are you hearing me all right now when we see this he had to deal with all it but here's where it comes down to this is what I want to get to with Joseph when he came out to appear before Pharaoh he came to a place to where when that famine was was was was was revealed of what was going to take place going to be seven years of plenty seven years of phantom here Joseph came out and in the midst of the time of the Gathering in of the vision of the word of the preparation for the vision to be fulfilled there was a union that came there between him and that Gentile bride are you with me and out of that and out of that Gentile bride notice what took place Joseph is able to declare out of his own life that here through Manasseh God hath made me to forget that is so good you you understand it it wasn't just something and then it came in but now it became fruit in his life forgiveness was now a fruit forgiveness was something he could put on his knee forgiveness is something that he knew he experienced in his life how did he experience it by a seed coming into a bedding ground and it coming forth and now forgiveness something that no doubt he was looking for and asking for and longing for it became an expression in the union that is so good and not just that of forgiveness but God would even through Ephraim which means he hath made me to forget or be fruitful rather in the land of my Affliction do you notice how that came amen he didn't say God has made me to be fruitful and then no one born after that God has caused me to forget it was that forgetting forgiving forgetting that led to fruitfulness you see sometimes in our life where things stall are you with me now sometimes when the power of a complex things are broken things are moving around our life but yet from that point what we do from that point matters what matters is is Lord I this word I want to see this word come to to pass in my life cuz sometimes we can go for a day for two for a week and all of a sudden we sense things starting to come back around us but remember you can't stay where you're at you've got to keep moving on with the Lord right God gives us Grace to do that is that right now here he comes into that place he's actually got to take that in and you know sometimes where the things listen let me just say it like this sometimes where it is where persons and people can get into a situation and they're looking at why am I so fearful why am I so afraid let me tell you what what happens perfect love cast out all fear and if you see what it is if you've fallen out of love this is a direct quote he said when you've fallen out of love with the Lord Jesus you cannot overlook your brother or sister's mistakes and so sometimes watch how the devil is he is he is a guy of diversion he wants to get us focused on this and the real reality of our full deliverance and maintaining Liberty is dwelling more in the love of God that will absolutely dismantle fear and will birth in our life a real Spirit of forgiveness sometimes the very things that's hindering a person from the word going on in their life is a lack of forgiveness come on but this is why the spirit of God comes to expose these things I I don't know about you but I this is how I feel in my heart when the spirit of God just begin to deal with my heart on Tuesday and some different things and then on Thursday as I come in oh my I just begin to just more the things just seem like it exploded and continuing because for what purpose we just don't want to have just a wonderful service and then we go from here but we want to see God he broke holds upon lives God himself broke complexes now we want to walk with the instruction of the word to keep going forward thank God for his Deliverance don't you I thank God for coming and breaking and speak into our lives but I thank him for his instruction in his word as well too my my let me see where I'm at I I know I got some places I want to get to here in just a moment but notice when you look at all of this this these parts within it here we want to have the right confession that's what we want to have the right confession now I want to remind you the prophet when he goes into this here an eagle stirreth up his nest and this whole part right here where brother Brown remember I I read this to you last week brother Bram talks about how somebody who's been sick for a while or had a condition in their life for a while and he said sometimes he said they can build up a complex especially if they've been sick for a while and he told us he said now don't resent it I'm getting ready to tell you he said but don't resent it he said you take a child that's been petted and that child becomes to rep place it just wants to be petted it builds up a complex you can't do nothing with that child until you shake him right good you see what God God God not God didn't come down and and he's not and he's not shaking us out of meanness he's got to shake us out of our own thoughts come on we can get a world that we start living in right we live in our own little world we built a complex around we've got our own currency we've got our own exchange rate you got to show up to our booth you got to exchange your money for our money we live in our own little world what can do that a complex and it's a spirit yes it is it can so hinge a person in but God comes to break that open let me tell you the same God that came down and he and he broke that Veil on that Easter morning they tried to seal him in they shut it up they said they made sure with the Roman seal but he broke the Seal of man they put guards to watch it over his life let me tell you something the enemy has said you'll never get free you'll never be well but the spirit of [Applause] God he is the one that makes real that he has triumphed over every principality over every devil over every habit Hallelujah glory be to God he shakes us from our own way of thinking is that right talks about how we getting that self-pity and everything else and he said we're in a pitiful condition right then when you get the pity in yourself you want everybody to pity you you want to pity yourself I like how I said and I read it to you last week he said I hit that spot one time he said when I had my breakdown but he said I read a book by FF Bosworth called Christian confession I love that book he said I read that book and he said that's where I heard an eagle scream it broke that from around his life now let's look at that let's look at that principle for a little bit this morning everybody all right let's look at that that principle here just a a little bit here this morning now now I want you to notice this the Bible says he's the high priest of our profession that means our confession what you say he is that's who he is you say well I'm not a very good Christian he can't intercede on that cuz that ain't what he said well I don't think I'll make it he can't intercede on that but if you go to start saying if got before us who can be against us he can go to work on that one that's his word oh one day I'm going to be healed he can't intercede on that but he'll work on your life until where you're ready to come to that place and it moves in your heart to say by his stripes I am healed on one of these days I'll be delivered he can't go to work on that but he'll deal with your heart move on your faith to where you can begin to rise and you see yourself as a free person in Jesus Christ I am free glory be to God see this this is where our faith has got to be turned loose when our faith now watch this here I think I think I'm in the right place no maybe I'm not there we go when your faith says that you're going to be uh you know the same as your sight and the man had a red tie and a brown suit over there your faith is the substance of things hope for the evidence of things you do not see there you are you believe it and you can't you can't accept it until and now until you believe it and you've got to believe it before you act you see what I mean he said people stand on the platform and well I why don't why don't something happen it can't happen until you first believe it accept it and confess it that's called a b c you've got to accept it believe it and confess it everybody knows algebra youve got them letters called variables right but you You' got to learn your ABCs and you're learning these ABCs accept it believe it and confess it and God can take those three simple principles and you can have the biggest problem in front of your life that is filled with variables but it makes no difference it's AB C accept it believe it confess it Hallelujah my my my my my my my my my I just got to I got just got to keep on moving here brother B comes in another place he says we find people sometimes with Divine Healing they get all worked up they get nervous and saying you know I they go Plum over the top of it you leave it behind you and you're going out nowhere you're out out there excited and trying to reach for something when it's right here by you it's it's just simple just say thank you Father you promised it to me I now receive it that's all what's what happens now if you say Lord I lost the joy of my salvation I'm sorry I stayed away from prayer meeting Wednesday night we'll find me right back Tuesday whenever it is we'll find me right back mean it believe it and say I've confessed my wrong now watch's the next words now start working on it in other words put some shoes on your faith are they the inst shoes faith is always in style faith has never went out of style it was by faith that the worlds were created it was by faith that that that Abel offered up a more excellent sacrifice it was by faith that Abraham overcome by faith Noah overcome Hallelujah now start working on it Christ starts interceding for you then you say I'm a sinner I'm sorry that I sinned Lord I'm going to be a Christian from now on then you see you made your confession start right on with that if you're sick Lord you are my healer if I've sinned to cause this to come upon me forgive me Lord I'm taking yet your word you said you'd heal me I believe it you're the high priest of My Confession now I'm confessing that by your stripes I was healed thank you Lord go right on then he can go to work on it and start healing heing you Hallelujah that's good preaching listen you've got to take the word and you've got to you've got to defeat that inferiority complex the Bible said let the redeemed of the Lord say so that's right I am my beloveds and he is mine Hallelujah the Bible said I'm the apple of his eye Psalm tells me that know ye the Lord that we are his sheep or his people the Sheep of his pasture it is not us that have made oursel he hath made us on and on we can go I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me that's I want you to think of this the word will defeat the enemy I want you to think about this in terms this scripture here just really came to my heart so strong so strong there on Thursday morning and this is dealing with Samson I I don't have time to read it but this is dealing with Samson and I want you to I want to remind you Samson was a Nazarite unto God and here was Philistines that came around him and and there arose a need and the Bible said he saw a new Jawbone right right and he went over what God pointed out he went over and picked that Jawbone UP And with that Jawbone he slew a thousand Philistines you talking about a paradox how God could keep that Jawbone together their har their helmets made out of I don't know what but he was able to hold together but I want you to notice what slew the enemy a Jawbone of an ass and God hath anointed you to speak the word come on friends he's given you he put a word in your mouth amen your language is not the same language that it used to be your language has been changed it's been changed by the spirit of God when God has taken a hold of your life it's a new Jawbone and God right through that anointing your heart and coming out through your life will slay Philistine after Philistine after Philistine after Philistine after Philistine I'm talking about Philistines even of Gloom of Doubt even when a person would walk up appear and accept salvation and they accept the Lord Jesus Christ as their savior they say Lord I'm laying down my life I Repent of my sins Lord I want to walk on with you they at that moment with faith in God's word are to rise up and to rise in that place and begin to testify I am saved are you hearing me it'll work the word works yes remember freedom is going to require something from us it's going to require something right Hallelujah now let me just move on here I'm coming I'm coming I'm coming I know some of you the locals begin you don't even believe me anymore but I'm coming I'm coming the tray tables straight out they hadn't even they hadn't come down the aisle to collect the little cup shed we're we're getting there though this is powerful death and life are in the power power of the tongue I'm so glad that he don't intercede When We complain and we get into a place and say Lord I just ain't no good I'm just no good I'm you know what I'm glad he don't accept that vow but as our husband he dis anals that vow every time he said that is not who you are oh glory be to God don't you love the Lord oh I just I just give up no no no no no he can he cannot begin to act upon that you know why cuz you didn't start it Hallelujah you can only stop what you started but the Bible said he that have begun a good work in you shall perform it unto the day of Jesus Christ but death and life are in the power of the tongue this is why Paul writing to positioned Believers in Christ let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth now that might sound like a little Sunday school scripture to you and I but these are positionally placed Believers in Ephesians that he had to remind them don't say things of corruption out of your mouth you know what that means right down here in the Judgment seat get it stopped right there every thought that comes in bring it to the Judgment seat of Christ bring every thought into cap acity and bring it in right there are you with me you know what I mean word words create an atmosphere don't they sometimes even the thoughts you get to thinking on something long enough man I mean it just creates just a Gloom it can create such a I mean it can be as sunny as it is outside but we can get in our own little cloudy world Listen friends I'm talking to all of us right here this morning but these are the times where we have to take the word of God and let me just tell you something H let us not be too big because when we talk about having an individual walk with God you got to also keep that in perspective you are not on an island by yourself we are a body of Believers that's why we had prayer requests one for another this is why we pray for one another this is why that even when one is going through something the Bible tells us when one suffers we all suffer and just so you understand it God's not having the rest of us read your mind right the Bible said let them that are sick call for the Elders of the church so let's just bust out of that little world right there our pity World well well nobody did this and nobody let's just bust right out of that thing and say wait a minute here I've got to obey the word the Bible said if there be any sick among you let them call for the Elders of the church amen let us reach out to one another let us reach out and pray and and take hold of God's word my my y'all believe this Hallelujah may maybe some of y'all maybe Heaven's going to be a full of islands you have your little island this one has their little island and we'll just boat from one another nope that's not how Heaven's going to be I'm sorry I'm sorry it's not going to be that way at all and you know what right down here right now it's not us acting something out you know sometimes the Bible tells tells us in the Book of Jonah that many times people people forsake their own mercies things where God himself is calling upon us and to reach out listen let me just tell you something we should not be we should say you know what I'm going to put my ego to the side matter of fact I'm going to run my ego through the blood of Jesus Christ I'm going to call upon God I'm going to reach out to somebody if I am going through something I want to reach out if I need prayer I want to reach out I know I know I know I know I know that that that's simple I know that but sometimes it's such the simple things like this that we fail to do yes watch this let me let me try to bring this down and close here brother BR said healing is not just something that you say well I believe it I believe it that's all right if that's the best you can do I love that it's not just something you say but if that's the best you you can do just mentally just say well yes I see it I believe it I accept it then if you accept it on those basis keep saying it over and over say it out loud say it over and over just keep saying it I'm Healed I'm Healed say it until actually you believe it and when you believe it then something's going to take place if you accept it that way then let's say it over and over and over and then eventually it comes and it kicks in where we believe it you know what happens it drops from here down here and the subconscious the man that's the man down there in the engine room that's the one who actually runs the ship anyhow right it ain't the guy out there in the Crow's Nest the guy up in The Crows Nest is given all these directions but the guy down here in the engine room he's the one that's controlling whether it's going forward or not right yeah true is that right so notice here don't never have a negative testimony every time you confess I still feel bad today you go straight straight back in the same rut that you was in the beginning there's not a man or woman in here that's baptized with the Holy Spirit but would start your confession I believe I lost the Holy Spirit I believe it's gone from me you'll go right down you'll never live above your confession my my my my my notice this he Hebrews 3:1 and he quotes a scripture profession is confession to sitting at the right hand of the father to make intercessions upon what our confession he can't do nothing for you until first you confess he's done it when you've accepted it now I wasn't saved I'm not saved tonight because I get happy and Shout that isn't it I'm not saved because the gift of God works through me I'm saved because I have met the conditions that Jesus Christ required from me I'm saved according to the Bible not because I feel like I'm saved Satan can whip you around the stump on your feelings but he can't when it's thus sayith the Lord he can't wait a cross there that'll defeat him right watch this when you believe you were saved sitting right in your seat and you accepted it and you begin to conf confess and tell people you were saved you kept on saying I'm saved now I don't know about you let me just let me just let me just speak my heart when God first got a hold of my life that that that morning over there right next to them dog cages in your basement and what I had just come out of from the previous stuper you know to come out of there there was so much doubt that wanted to swirl around my mind you'll never break free of this you'll never get out of this you'll never get out of that this and this and this all those things were swirling around but you know it began just simply right there I'm saved I'm saved and you know what that very thing it worked out righteousness but you know that same principle works right now in my life the same principle is what works in your life right now for healing right it's the same principle coming out of a complex it's the same principle you love him oh my brother BR says you know people eventually say there ain't no difference in you but you believe there was and you kept with your confession and after a while it worked righteousness all your neighbors and everybody knows you're saved now because you believed it and you confessed it see that's the same thing about your your healing you accept him as your healer renounce your feelings right it's not by your feelings it's by faith say you're healed believe you're healed act like you're healed here's a key associate with those who believe in healing and God will bring you right out to a perfect soundness of health and will not fail you can't look at your symptoms goes on talking about this very next statement for a person who is in a wheelchair and that can seem like man I've been here for all this time but you know to God he goes on to says it right there in God's eyes your condition in a wheelchair is no different than a toothache to God right I say Lord help us to see what God sees help us not to look in where the conditions and where we're at but God help us to see as God sees how many say Lord I want to move beyond my feelings I know it's simple friends I know it's simple but when the power of things are broken you begin to feel God coming down and just with things that he's discerned within our hearts and our lives and during this time of renew things would be broken you want to walk on with God Amen with the victories that God has given what God has done and begun in your life you've got to walk on with him you've got to take that word and keep confessing that word I know every one of us including me including me I think brother Trevor put it so clearly right here when he had to take the word of God by confession for his own healing when he couldn't even turn his head and through the first part of last year it's those are not those are not the things that we we Delight in we look every one of us including me when I've been sick oh I would have loved for something to have been a miracle right here but we've got a promise I'm the Lord that Health thee and healing itself is not a miracle though when it takes place it is a miracle but a miracle is something that happens right then and there that's good but healing says they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover didn't say when didn't give a timestamp on it as a matter of fact when the when when the when the gentleman in John chapter 2 not the Roman Centurion but in John Chapter 2 when that he had he had a servant that was sick and the Lord Jesus he actually wanted Jesus to come to his house Jesus said I can't make it there he said and then finally the Lord Jesus said if thou believe he said I believe he spoke the word and the Bible says on his way back his servants met him and said hey hey he's healed and the question that he asked what hour did he begin to amend when did the healing start to take place when did the fever break when did things begin to take place let me tell you something God working in your life yes sir come on and in my life it takes simple obedience to God's word amen and it begins to amend as things are broken stay with it keep with it and press sing right out and you know what then you'll be the one standing as a testimony as a testimony of what God has brought you through anybody know what I'm talking about testimonies of different things to where you're actually able to pray I mean when you can enter in for other people that are dealing with certain conditions and certain things like that you're able to enter in and really pray for them because you have passed through that way and God has brought you through and you can actually sympathize and enter in with them oh God help us let's bow our heads oh Lord Jesus how many like to be remembered in prayer this morning amen God bless you God bless your hands no matter what no matter what the need no matter what the request is I know we hear that and we say it but it's a truth it's a truth God is greater he's more than enough and he he will see you through father Lord Jesus behind Lord the hands that have been lifted up here hearts Lord that you've spoke to once again Lord you come by to instruct us Lord or you didn't come by to scold us you came by to instruct us Lord I think of that little song Sometimes that we've sung Lord years and years and years ago touching Jesus is all that really matters another course Lord out here brother Bill sing and I'm just a boy I'm reaching out to you dear Lord I'm I'm reaching out to you oh God you're not ashamed of us Lord You're not ashamed Lord to come by and speak to our hearts for some of us Lord this would be reminders Lord I find it Lord even as things were just pouring through my heart what I found in my own life my own heart what a refreshing what an ENC encouragement Lord to be able to understand that and walk on that we need we must operate by that law of Freedom Lord in order to move in like that water from one field to another field there's a law of gravity or the same way father for the word of God working in our lives it's a law of Faith you brought it down so simple that if Lord Jesus even if it's something for us Lord to where it's just something it seems like at that moment we just can't seem to grasp Lord I want to be simple and humble enough to take that word and to confess it Lord that freedom healing is mine Deliverance is mine freedom from this self-pity is mine Deliverance Lord from anxiousness oh God you are so mindful Lord I pray Lord right here this morning God as your presence Lord is right here with us Lord to Graces Lord Jesus we want to walk on with you Lord we want to stand right up to that complex stand right up Lord to that where there Lord that that Gloom and that world Lord is being broken Open Lord Jesus would you just would you walk right in there this morning maybe Lord is a harder a life that God is in a Cell Maybe Lord God not knowing how do I get out but may you come who is the way Lord God you've stepped down into our lives into our midst now may you I pray God just Minister Lord to each heart according to our needs may you Lord I pray as we take this word this morning Lord it it goes Lord it covers so much more than just complexes Lord it deals with every area of our life deals with Lord as it comes to Salvation deals with taking a hold on the promise of God lord maybe there's a life that or Jesus for them they're saying Lord I I really want the Holy Spirit Lord God I pray that may it just be made so real to their hearts this morning may it just drop Lord may they Lord not even think back to last week a month ago or whatever but may they Lord just recognize the drawing power of the Holy Spirit Lord God begin to thank you and begin to Lord to opening their hearts and their lives to you Lord for healing Lord that's in the body Lord there's many requests I heard and there's many Lord that I know things that have come across the text thread even yesterday Lord God lord as we give you praise for how you move Lord for sister Lily's grandmother Lord her grandfather God it's just it's a testimony Lord of your mercies and how we thank you Lord God now Lord that's a testimony even we can stand here and say what you've did for them you'll do for someone else you'll do for anyone that will believe you Lord Lord You've not asked us to be smart people but you've asked us to believe you I pray this morning dear God May that Lord be what strikes the hearts help us in our daily life Lord we are bombarded with negative things Lord God you can't even hardly open our phones and you see negative reports negative headlines nothing's ever positive even when it come comes to the weather instead of saying partly sunny it'll say partly cloudy God help us Lord here we are walking Lord in a negative World here we are all around negative but God I pray that the light that has Shone in Upon Our Hearts here this morning may we walk forward with that confession in our lives may we take that word that Lord you would drop our way Lord God when we feel insufficient may we look at what you have said about us as our text this morning said hearken my daughter incline thine ear Grant it Lord I pray thank you for your mercies Lord may you Minister Lord continue even after the service has commenced Lord may we we take these things Lord God and walk forward Lord into Liberty I pray in Jesus precious name amen I want to remind you that Samson the Bible says out that same Jawbone he laid in was laid down he got thirsty he was just totally wiped out but God directed him to go pick it back up and God clave a hollow place in that jaw that's so good and out of there came forth water to refresh him Hallelujah the very same thing that brought the enemy down to their to their knees that that wiped them out became the very same Implement that God worked through to bring ref refreshing the Bible says his Spirit was revived it was renewed I believe I believe the word of God does that and not only do I believe it I know it works amen but sometimes I want you to listen to me sometimes as we go when we go through that sometimes within that we're our feelings we can seems like it seems like nothing's taking place and it don't seem like anything's happening but let me just tell you something don't turn loose of the word of God that's right amen because that word of God will see you through brother Bram tells us about a woman I didn't didn't read it to you but there's a there was a woman who she was her her husband own a big a big Factory there in Jeffersonville and she had a need in her body and and she came running to brother BR brother Bram I need you to pray for me so brother Bram prayed for her she said thank the Lord I I feel good she went on for a few days thank the Lord I feel so good and all of a sudden her surgeon called her because they were supposed to do a surgery and that surgeon told her said are you ready to come in for the surgery and she said well I I don't know I don't I I I think everything's everything's fine everything's okay brother BR said when that surgeon said okay then I'm not not going to do it and this is it somehow within that part something she had to have entertained her then a then a feeling came back to her she began to feel a little bit sick and when she then all of a sudden she she called and said hey go ahead do the surgery go ahead go ahead put me back on don't don't you know it was within the same time brother BR said when they went in there to do the surgery when they opened her up up it wasn't nothing to be found it was gone brother BR said what it was he said she just wasn't instructed on how to hold on to her healing you and I both know this that when all of a sudden when you're healed God touches you there's things that God can do for you even from what he did last Sunday whether it was in Physical Realm spiritual realm but you'll fight battles right after that is that right you'll fight battles right after that but let me just tell you something when after a person that God has come and brought healing that that the thing itself they may get sicker but it is no sign that they've not been healed are you hearing me now but that's the time to hold on that's a time that when all of a sudden maybe certain feelings and certain things come back but that's a Time to hold on right yes that's a time when just simply you don't have to explain everything but it might just simply be hey brother Dave will you pray with me brother that's it sister so and so will you pray with me but you let me just tell you if you can't get a hold of brother so and so or sister so and so Jesus is always available Hallelujah is that right he's always available amen but you know my wife when when she's been been sick there's been things that she would take place let me just tell you a little something I can I can be finally you know you get you get to sleep and all of a sudden if I I here I am sleeping and if I feel this right here on this side like that my mind immediately goes dear Lord what's going on is a kidney stone attack what's it because it's always been that little touch when something is going on she comes out of the bed and and that goes on but you know what it is she'll come and she'll wake me up and I can pray with her well she's praying let me just tell you something I'm going to give her a little rose right now she was laying on the floor last Saturday singing in pain worshiping in pain on the way to the hospital Harley said still but just thanking the lord worshiping him I'm so thankful that we have one another I'm talking about for us as a body I'm thankful God has put us together I'm thankful God that we can pray for one another be there for one another don't you love the Lord amen God
