[40:01] Lord
[40:04] amen I want to
[40:06] um just mention to you very very
[40:10] quickly
[40:12] um so brother Josh and sister Sharon
[40:16] they they weren't here on Sunday but
[40:18] they did
[40:19] arrive but everything when they when
[40:23] they remember they were supposed to
[40:24] arrive on Friday night
[40:26] and uh they didn't end up getting here
[40:29] till
[40:31] Saturday U I think it was Midday or
[40:34] right after that so we're thankful for
[40:36] that you know sure there's been little
[40:40] bumps along the road but um we're just
[40:43] thankful to the mercy of the Lord they
[40:45] ran into some things there when they
[40:46] landed in Boston and but anyhow God Made
[40:49] A Way and uh you know their bags they
[40:55] what it was every one of their
[40:58] bags uh were
[41:00] missing and uh so but the Lord just so
[41:05] mercifully just just moved for brother
[41:08] Jos and sister Sharon and know God just
[41:11] just moving on the scene on Sunday uh
[41:16] while uh you all would have been in the
[41:18] midst of the service is when I I'd got a
[41:20] text when I was getting out of the
[41:22] morning service where I was at that they
[41:24] just had got their bags all five of them
[41:30] so we thank God for that and so you know
[41:35] just just one testimony after another
[41:37] but we are so looking forward to uh uh
[41:40] seeing them and I want to with that in
[41:43] mind just kind of make mention to you uh
[41:47] there brother Josh way has they've you
[41:50] know plann something out for I believe
[41:54] it is December 30th right now he just
[41:56] confirmed this with me later today they
[41:58] moved it back and it's just a a
[42:00] gathering that they're are going to have
[42:03] and to invite all of the uh brothers and
[42:06] sisters from the church there's
[42:08] obviously some friends that they have
[42:10] that he has over there in Cleveland that
[42:12] is uh congales and uh the main thing I I
[42:16] I'm saying this and expressing it to you
[42:18] and I will say it again is because I
[42:20] think one of the things that we can
[42:22] never underestimate is the is the value
[42:25] of reaching out and welcoming someone
[42:28] absolutely I know it's true that I don't
[42:31] I'm not going to I'm not I don't I'm not
[42:33] trying to put on any hardship on anyone
[42:35] but sometimes I think that our thoughts
[42:37] have to go beyond ourselves sometimes
[42:40] and so you know I think it would be a
[42:42] very good thing as brother joshu and
[42:45] sister Sharon coming here the purpose
[42:46] was that brother Josh what he had
[42:48] extended you know it's a it's a
[42:50] wonderful time for them and uh an
[42:52] opportunity to be able to just talk with
[42:55] sister Sharon get a chance to get
[42:57] acquainted uh with her they're going to
[42:59] be sojourning here and I think that's a
[43:01] part of it that uh would be very good
[43:03] for us so that'll be on December the
[43:05] 30th and um so didn't reive a lot of
[43:09] amens on that but I want to make you
[43:11] aware of that sir you know uh so I I
[43:17] think that would be very good we
[43:19] sometimes the things that we in that
[43:21] part of it what's so important and I
[43:23] I'll tell you one thing that I love to
[43:24] see as a pastor I love to see that first
[43:27] of all when I hear and I I relay it to
[43:30] you you have ministers that come and
[43:32] stand here and relay it but then I have
[43:34] it in the back office then I have it
[43:36] later on of the of the the the
[43:40] commendations that are made regarding
[43:42] the love among the people the
[43:44] receptiveness among the people for the
[43:47] word of God that's right and I I really
[43:50] I appreciate that because that's that's
[43:52] what God has done that's who he is and I
[43:55] every time time when a minister stands
[43:57] here I said look we're just simple
[43:58] people we believe this message with all
[44:00] of our heart just preach the word just
[44:03] just just preach you you obey the Lord I
[44:05] I don't have nothing wrote on there
[44:07] don't go here don't go there CU I've Got
[44:09] Confidence the men of God I've invited
[44:11] in here they they they know their
[44:12] boundaries they know where things just
[44:14] like when I go other places I don't try
[44:15] to Pastor people when I go other places
[44:18] but I got confidence in God's leading
[44:21] that's right amen and I I want to see I
[44:22] want to see God's people helped yes and
[44:25] uh and so I'm so thankful for that so I
[44:29] also want to say that the other part of
[44:31] it is it goes beyond that is when you
[44:33] know I think it ought to be that when we
[44:35] have a visitor or visitors here it
[44:37] should not be left unnoticed to where we
[44:39] don't know their
[44:41] name that first begins with the deacons
[44:44] and then it travels all the way through
[44:46] to where it's something and I've watched
[44:48] different ones of you when I've been out
[44:49] here at the Times where purposely you
[44:51] walk over and you greet those who are
[44:54] strangers right
[44:56] and uh you know people that come into
[44:58] our midst and uh I think it's always
[45:01] good to be
[45:03] friendly and uh you know and I so I
[45:06] appreciate that with all my heart I know
[45:09] I know others do and so we never know
[45:12] friends we don't we never know of the
[45:14] life that we're going that is going to
[45:16] be touched by God but I'll say it like
[45:18] this right here we know it has to be God
[45:20] to touch a life it has to be God to
[45:22] position a life in the body but you and
[45:24] I are also called channels too that's
[45:27] right in order for that electricity as
[45:29] it comes from that pole goes back to
[45:30] that box there are wires throughout this
[45:33] building the brothers the brothers when
[45:36] they went through and were doing all
[45:38] this extra lighting in here you know how
[45:41] much more wiring I can't even just here
[45:43] alone and in the back that was run
[45:46] Brother Carlos would probably know off
[45:47] the top of his head but I mean a massive
[45:50] amounts of wiring but it doesn't matter
[45:52] how much electricity is here if you
[45:55] don't have a wire to connect One Source
[45:58] to
[45:59] another that's what we want to be we
[46:01] want Lord I just want to be a channel
[46:03] that you can flow through amen a channel
[46:06] that you can use that's where my concern
[46:09] is for is for his body amen so I just
[46:13] want to just encourage you in that and
[46:18] um just as we get ready to turn to the
[46:21] word and I want to say God bless you so
[46:25] so thankful for your prayers while we
[46:26] were away there on Sunday in services
[46:29] and the Lord was just so
[46:31] mindful of us and so we I just want to
[46:34] say thank you and we're so glad to be
[46:37] back home and um so let's stand if we
[46:42] could um I always feel like I'm missing
[46:46] some
[46:48] announcement if I could remember
[46:50] announcements like I can remember the
[46:51] word but I guess if I have my
[46:54] DS
[46:57] but
[46:59] uh some of you already know where we're
[47:01] going job
[47:04] 23 but I want to if God will help us
[47:07] here tonight I want to uh I want to try
[47:10] to tie this up here
[47:14] on
[47:16] uh with in his
[47:20] hands and getting into this place
[47:22] tonight so I in order to maybe to get to
[47:25] some points of it's not that I feel like
[47:26] I want to rush but I've got just a
[47:28] thought that I want to uh really work
[47:31] with here tonight um so in his hands and
[47:36] if I had a subth thought for it you can
[47:38] kind of keep in the back your mind is
[47:39] and I it is a secret work being revealed
[47:43] openly a secret work being revealed
[47:46] openly in job
[47:48] 23:8 job said behold I go forward but he
[47:53] is not there and backward
[47:56] but I cannot perceive him and on the
[47:59] left hand where he doth work but I
[48:01] cannot Behold Him and He hideth himself
[48:05] on the right hand that I cannot see him
[48:09] remember we looked at it last week his
[48:11] right hand that through all things it's
[48:14] necessary of that experience that we
[48:16] have with God and it is his hand that is
[48:20] holding us through it
[48:22] all and it is his hand that is is
[48:26] working and molding and shaping Our
[48:30] Lives even in many of these times like
[48:32] what job is expressing that we have no
[48:35] idea what is taking place what is being
[48:39] worked out but what's important is is he
[48:42] knows what he's
[48:44] doing he knows what he's
[48:47] doing but he knoweth the way that I take
[48:49] verse 10 when he hath tried me I shall
[48:52] come forth as gold and my foot hath held
[48:56] his steps his way have I kept and not
[49:00] declined neither have I gone back from
[49:03] the Commandment of his lips I have
[49:06] esteemed the words of his mouth more
[49:09] than my necessary food amen may God
[49:13] bless you and bless the reading of the
[49:14] word as you're being seated I want to
[49:16] read another portion of scripture out of
[49:18] Philippians chapter three to kind of tie
[49:21] in with this and setting the background
[49:24] as we're looking at this the left hand
[49:25] and the right hand Paul would say it
[49:27] like this but what things were gained to
[49:29] me in verse 7 those I counted lost for
[49:32] Christ yay doubtless and I count all
[49:36] things but loss for the Excellency of
[49:40] the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord
[49:43] for whom I have suffered the loss of all
[49:46] things and do count them but Dum that I
[49:50] may win Christ I just just to pause
[49:53] there for a moment if if I could say it
[49:54] in this way this this portion of
[49:56] scripture that we're reading it's like
[49:58] sitting under an oak tree where a life
[50:01] that has has come through many much of
[50:04] the journey and yet you find that within
[50:07] that this expression is Paul's
[50:10] expression is is that I want to go
[50:13] deeper I want to know him more and you
[50:16] begin to get a glimpse of how that Paul
[50:18] is living his life that Paul is living
[50:21] his life in a much uh deeper more mature
[50:24] way in the Lord and that is dealing with
[50:27] uh not so much of what is lawful and
[50:31] what's unlawful but dealing with what
[50:34] whatsoever things were gained to me if
[50:36] it was if it was something that was just
[50:38] to bring edifying to me or a furtherance
[50:41] to me and if that's all that it is then
[50:44] I don't I'm not interested in that the
[50:46] only thing I'm interested in is the
[50:47] furtherance of Christ in my life I'm
[50:50] interested in the furtherance of his
[50:52] word now I I don't believe that Paul was
[50:55] saying in there you know don't look for
[50:57] uh to put in for a promotion on your job
[50:59] that's not Paul was saying but Paul was
[51:01] saying let everything that I've learned
[51:03] to evaluate everything in that is this
[51:06] going to hinder the work of the Lord in
[51:09] my life or is it going to further the
[51:11] work of the Lord in my life CU sometimes
[51:14] the things that are spoken or said is
[51:16] you know if I can just get this job or
[51:18] if I can just do this my I'll be able to
[51:20] serve God more and sometimes sometimes
[51:22] the things that we look at just with
[51:24] reasoning it actually becomes a trap and
[51:27] an ensnarement and we find ourselves
[51:29] actually being tied up more instead of
[51:32] being more free that's why we need a
[51:34] discernment that goes beyond our
[51:35] reasoning we need we need the leadership
[51:38] of the Holy Spirit and also we learn
[51:40] these things as we go on we learn this
[51:42] within our life my wouldn't it be
[51:44] wonderful if we could just read this
[51:46] here tonight and say from this point on
[51:48] there'll not be another mistake that
[51:49] I'll
[51:51] make I don't have a song on this but I'm
[51:54] thinking of a title dream
[51:56] on verse n and be found in him not
[52:00] having mine own righteousness which is
[52:03] of the law but that which is through the
[52:06] Faith of Christ the righteousness which
[52:10] is of god by faith I want you to watch
[52:12] this verse in verse 10 that I may know
[52:15] him and the power of his resurrection
[52:18] and the fellowship of his sufferings see
[52:21] notice right hand and left hand the
[52:24] power of his resurrection and the
[52:25] fellowship of his sufferings being made
[52:29] conformable unto his death if by any
[52:33] means I might attain unto the
[52:35] resurrection of the Dead not as though I
[52:38] had already attained either were already
[52:42] perfect but I follow after if that I may
[52:46] apprehend that for which also I am
[52:49] apprehended of Christ Jesus Brethren I
[52:53] count not myself to have apprehended
[52:55] ended but this one thing I do forgetting
[52:59] those things which are behind and
[53:02] reaching forth unto those things which
[53:05] are before and I press toward the mark
[53:09] for the prize of the High Calling of God
[53:12] in Christ Jesus let me just say it like
[53:15] this what Paul is recognizing is don't
[53:17] become encumbered with all your past
[53:20] failures right that's right because you
[53:23] can't move forward you have to receive
[53:26] the Forgiveness of the Lord his or Grace
[53:29] and overcoming and saying I'm going to
[53:31] look forward because if you look
[53:32] backward you're going to end up veering
[53:34] off the road you've got to keep your
[53:36] eyes on the prize and that's what Paul
[53:38] is saying I've learned to forget those
[53:40] things in the past Paul had received a
[53:43] real forgiveness from the Lord in other
[53:46] words the image of Stephen no longer
[53:49] haunted him
[53:53] that's now Paul now brother Ram tells us
[53:55] that what Paul saw there with stepen
[53:58] drove Paul to a place to where Paul even
[54:00] when he was forbidden to go to Jerusalem
[54:03] Paul said I'm going anyhow because Paul
[54:05] remembered was where stepen stood as a
[54:08] martyr and that had an effect on his
[54:10] life the rest of the day I don't believe
[54:12] that effect was that Paul walked around
[54:14] in defeat but it had an effect because
[54:16] Paul could see what he had I have also
[54:20] experienced is that right so here we're
[54:24] looking to what before us you you can
[54:26] never get anywhere with looking behind
[54:29] you you always got to go forward this is
[54:31] why brother Bram would use that over and
[54:33] over and I actually knew a brother here
[54:35] in the assembly that his rearview mirror
[54:38] he never used it he took that quote to
[54:42] another level he spun that rearview
[54:44] mirror and never used it you know well I
[54:46] use my rearview mirror that's right you
[54:48] know I know they we got all these camera
[54:50] Gadgets in the car but I still use my
[54:51] mirror the cameras are all right when
[54:53] I'm getting close to a bumper but other
[54:54] than than that my mirrors is what I
[54:57] like so there's a time to you see from
[54:59] the rear of view mirror you can see
[55:01] where you've come from but you can't
[55:03] drive by looking in the rearview mirror
[55:06] is that right this is why the scripture
[55:08] said looking unto Jesus the author and
[55:11] finisher of our
[55:12] faith amen so then we look here in the
[55:15] scripture I want to draw from this this
[55:17] the scripture here in verse 10 that I
[55:19] may know him and the power of his
[55:22] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[55:24] sufferings be being made
[55:26] conformable unto his
[55:30] death this word conformable I want to
[55:33] just draw from this I I got to looking
[55:35] at at this here and this word it means
[55:39] to render like that is figuratively to
[55:44] assimilate or to make conformable unto
[55:48] to be conformed or received the same
[55:51] format so when things are are being
[55:55] assimilated are not things that are
[55:57] happening rapidly that's
[56:00] right you see this is why even as we
[56:03] come and we're setting under the word of
[56:06] God it's us sometimes we're the ones who
[56:09] get
[56:11] impatient but what's important is is
[56:14] that your lives are assimilating to the
[56:17] word that there is there is that which
[56:20] is not just accommod it's not
[56:22] accommodating but it's where it's
[56:24] assimilating little by little by little
[56:27] there is change taking place now
[56:30] remember everybody's journey is
[56:32] different yet it is the same it's a
[56:35] journey from Death unto life it's a
[56:37] journey from birth unto maturity but
[56:39] within the whole process this
[56:41] conformability is not something that we
[56:44] receive as a gift character is not a
[56:49] gift that's right it's a
[56:52] victory is that right there is an and to
[56:56] things to assimilate this is why that
[56:59] even there is the effect of the word
[57:01] that we are under and I'm just to you
[57:04] know let me just flow with this just a
[57:06] moment this is why brother brand could
[57:08] say over and over when in power of
[57:10] transformation of how he says that the
[57:13] Earth itself became a a beautiful
[57:16] watered Garden of Eden because it obeyed
[57:18] the word of God and came over around the
[57:21] Sun what happened it assimilated
[57:25] it moves sometimes the things that we
[57:28] maybe don't see but so you know what's
[57:29] hard for us to think back on is how that
[57:32] God begin dealing with our lives little
[57:35] by little by little there were things no
[57:37] doubt that God was working in our lives
[57:39] before we ever darken the church that's
[57:43] right or maybe you were raised in the
[57:44] message like I was but there were things
[57:46] that all of a sudden God begins to deal
[57:49] with our lives little by little by
[57:51] little there's things taking place why
[57:53] you see that's why this life this this
[57:56] Water of Life that we have in this hour
[57:59] it is only the water of the word that we
[58:03] have that will bring a rotting condition
[58:06] and break down that outer man in order
[58:09] that that germ of Life can come forth on
[58:12] the
[58:12] inside there's no other gospel there's
[58:16] because this is the only true gospel
[58:18] anything else will leave a man in his
[58:21] conditions and his sins and he might be
[58:22] a little bit better here a little bit
[58:24] better here but it's only the Water of
[58:26] Life that brings forth New
[58:29] Creation you say what do I mean by
[58:31] assimilate well one of the words to
[58:33] assimilate is to absorb and the prophet
[58:36] says in spoken word's Original Seed he
[58:38] said brother brandham if you're saying
[58:40] the world's rejecting it then why are
[58:42] you still preaching this word he said
[58:44] because if there's a son and daughter of
[58:46] God that's out there when they hear this
[58:48] word and absorb
[58:51] it it will transform their lives
[58:56] you're built to absorb it you're built
[58:59] to
[59:00] assimilate and this is assimilating
[59:04] conforming unto his death right so it's
[59:08] not something it's not something that's
[59:10] being molded overnight neither is it
[59:13] something that's being done openly it's
[59:16] things that God is
[59:18] working in the midst of our
[59:21] lives and I want you just to think of
[59:23] this
[59:26] this scripture BR pull that in
[59:28] Philippians 3:10 on the Amplified
[59:30] version I want to read
[59:32] this for my determined purpose is that I
[59:37] may know him that I may progressively
[59:40] become more deeply and intimately
[59:42] acquainted with him how many say that's
[59:45] my desire
[59:46] that's I don't want to just be sitting
[59:48] around say I made it right amen no my
[59:52] desire is to know him more true and to
[59:56] and intimately acquainted with him
[59:58] perceiving and recognizing and
[1:00:00] understanding the wonders of his person
[1:00:02] more strongly and more clearly and that
[1:00:05] I may in the same way come to know the
[1:00:07] power outflowing from his resurrection
[1:00:10] which exerts over Believers and that I
[1:00:13] may so share his sufferings to be
[1:00:15] continually transformed in spirit into
[1:00:18] his likeness even to his
[1:00:20] death amen think of it what the world
[1:00:24] and what Satan thought
[1:00:27] was the greatest as far as on Satan's
[1:00:29] kingdom was the greatest
[1:00:31] victory was
[1:00:33] when he was able to secure the Lord
[1:00:36] Jesus and take him to Calvary and the
[1:00:39] crucifixion to take
[1:00:41] place he felt the same way with Abel
[1:00:45] felt the same way with all of them down
[1:00:47] through time in each one of them he saw
[1:00:51] that light he saw that that part but
[1:00:53] notice here it comes to the very
[1:00:56] end of the life of the Lord Jesus and
[1:00:59] here he stands one of the most glorious
[1:01:01] moments is nevertheless not my will
[1:01:05] thine will be
[1:01:07] done this where it's coming to to that
[1:01:10] place and it wasn't notice this was a
[1:01:13] place that it wasn't in the midst of a
[1:01:17] crowd he went off a distance left his
[1:01:20] disciples and went off a distance
[1:01:23] without them right went a little further
[1:01:26] and he prayed three times even come back
[1:01:28] to wake him and say could you not stay
[1:01:30] awake with me right and one of the
[1:01:32] things that he mentions during that time
[1:01:35] regarding
[1:01:37] everything the flesh is weak but the
[1:01:40] spirit is
[1:01:42] willing we could stay in Fellowship on
[1:01:44] that tonight but we all know that's the
[1:01:46] truth the flesh is weak the flesh don't
[1:01:49] ever get any stronger right even when we
[1:01:52] come out of a wonderful service your
[1:01:54] flesh though your flesh maybe you know
[1:01:56] you feel uh joyful but it in the flesh
[1:01:59] that's getting that way maybe sickness
[1:02:01] has been lifted from your body but the
[1:02:03] real benefit of it is the Son and
[1:02:06] Daughter of God has been further
[1:02:09] authorized and strengthened on the
[1:02:12] inside because just given a little bit
[1:02:14] of time and this man on the outside and
[1:02:17] how the attack will come and want to try
[1:02:19] to Cave into it and maybe start filling
[1:02:21] down a little bit but that which is on
[1:02:23] the inside has been strengthened and
[1:02:25] nourished and buil up in the things of
[1:02:28] God but this this part here I I love the
[1:02:31] right hand of God all the power of his
[1:02:33] resurrection if not for the power of the
[1:02:36] Resurrection then where would we be
[1:02:38] without a real experience with God where
[1:02:41] would we be there is no character
[1:02:43] molding but now also Paul says and the
[1:02:48] fellowship of his sufferings now when we
[1:02:51] preach on the fellowship of his
[1:02:52] sufferings that's not you usually a
[1:02:54] moment that maybe would be all together
[1:02:58] like shouting the house down but I'll
[1:03:00] tell you what I've experienced that
[1:03:02] through each part of my journey there's
[1:03:05] times where I come through certain times
[1:03:06] and to understand God is a god of
[1:03:09] Seasons oh that's good that's real good
[1:03:12] he's a god of Seasons yes he is there's
[1:03:15] dry seasons wet Seasons Hot Seasons cold
[1:03:18] all the seasons and it's all a law of
[1:03:20] contrast that allows appreciation but
[1:03:22] I'll tell you what I found I have found
[1:03:24] such strength and such encouragement
[1:03:26] when a word has come when in the midst
[1:03:28] that I'm dealing with something going
[1:03:30] through something something right here
[1:03:32] in my life and how God will take and
[1:03:34] separate a man of God and things will be
[1:03:37] spoken in that hour God doesn't remove
[1:03:39] the trial but God's letting me know hey
[1:03:41] I'm with you that's right
[1:03:45] that's he does take me out of it but
[1:03:47] what is it there's a time of
[1:03:49] Fellowship it's a fellowship in his
[1:03:52] sufferings you know why notice the
[1:03:53] fellowship ship of his
[1:03:55] sufferings oh this all right it ain't
[1:03:58] about this is not about me going off on
[1:04:01] my own and then claiming well I'm
[1:04:03] suffering for the Lord no The Fellowship
[1:04:05] of his sufferings is Walking In step
[1:04:08] with his
[1:04:12] word that's exactly what it is it's
[1:04:15] Walking In step with his word and then
[1:04:17] notice in order we're not being punished
[1:04:21] suffering is not punishment suffering is
[1:04:24] so that the word might live in our
[1:04:29] lives
[1:04:31] hallelujah hallelujah oh I would love it
[1:04:33] if I came to the house of God and man
[1:04:35] just right away my someone is
[1:04:38] ministering man here comes the word now
[1:04:40] made flesh in my life no
[1:04:43] suffering but that's not how it happens
[1:04:46] it's true the word speaks to the Inner
[1:04:49] Man the Son and Daughter of God but we
[1:04:52] cannot and we will not as the Bride of
[1:04:54] Jesus Christ bypass trials and suffering
[1:04:58] as a matter of fact the prophet said in
[1:05:00] the samian age he says in plain language
[1:05:02] the very character of Jesus Christ was
[1:05:05] perfected through suffering and he has
[1:05:08] left his church a measure of suffering
[1:05:12] that we also with by suffering and
[1:05:16] having our faith in him will come to a
[1:05:19] place of perfection that's so good amen
[1:05:22] yes
[1:05:23] sir
[1:05:25] Hallelujah so these are a time as the
[1:05:28] word working in our
[1:05:31] lives in Matthew 6 I had these
[1:05:33] scriptures down but I I don't want to
[1:05:35] take and and and deal with the time to
[1:05:37] read the entirety of the scripture but
[1:05:40] all in Matthew 6 it starts out with
[1:05:43] first of all when you're doing Ms that
[1:05:46] means good deeds for others don't walk
[1:05:50] around and sound a
[1:05:52] trumpet hey everybody can I have your
[1:05:56] attention I'm going to give them
[1:05:58] $20 all
[1:06:03] right now there's a key in here it says
[1:06:06] don't let your left hand know what your
[1:06:09] right hand is doing in other words you
[1:06:11] know it's saying be like
[1:06:13] God cuz there's times that God is
[1:06:16] working God's doing things in our life
[1:06:19] that we don't know what's going
[1:06:21] on that is true that's a real Godlike
[1:06:25] characteristic then he goes on further
[1:06:27] into this here he's talking about the
[1:06:29] secret that that part where the Delight
[1:06:32] it's just it's just unto the Lord let me
[1:06:34] read these two verses of scripture here
[1:06:36] out of Matthew 6 this is remember what
[1:06:38] the angel of the Lord referred the
[1:06:40] prophet too with that of the third pull
[1:06:42] and the furtherance of his ministry and
[1:06:44] let me just say it when we as we're
[1:06:46] reading this here in verse 5 it's all
[1:06:48] about with the opening of the word it's
[1:06:50] all about Christ on the scene a very a
[1:06:53] summary of it is you are the Tabernacle
[1:06:56] of the Living God you are his Dwelling
[1:06:59] Place amen that's what it's all about
[1:07:02] Christ coming in to bride form then let
[1:07:04] us be glad and rejoice for the marriage
[1:07:07] of the Lamb has
[1:07:08] come it's Christ now United in an
[1:07:12] invisible
[1:07:16] Union hallu this is why it might be a
[1:07:19] little bit ahead but this is why when
[1:07:21] the scripture says in Revelations 88
[1:07:24] when and when he had opened the seven
[1:07:27] seal there was silence in
[1:07:30] heaven why because he come
[1:07:33] down the fullness of his Spirit the
[1:07:37] fullness of his presence that's why we
[1:07:41] are worshiping the
[1:07:45] lamb the angels are the Angels why is it
[1:07:48] silence because he's come down that's so
[1:07:52] good I know you understand understand
[1:07:54] what I'm saying the Corporal body is
[1:07:55] still there I'm talking about in the
[1:07:57] fullness of his word he has stepped
[1:07:59] forward the lamb himself was standing
[1:08:02] there in Jeffersonville holding the open
[1:08:06] book and the reality of it is the open
[1:08:09] book wasn't so much the prophet's Bible
[1:08:11] but the open book it's Christ himself
[1:08:14] standing in the midst of his
[1:08:18] people that's the whole seven seal the
[1:08:21] coming of the Lord Christ coming in you
[1:08:24] the House of
[1:08:29] Prayer this is why the angel of the Lord
[1:08:32] would take the prophet and brother BR
[1:08:34] said he's always
[1:08:36] scriptural in everything he says to
[1:08:39] me and he told him and said this will
[1:08:43] not be a public show that's right as a
[1:08:46] matter of fact he said you'll not
[1:08:48] explain this to anybody
[1:08:52] amen
[1:08:58] this is why
[1:09:01] when when we could listen to and I'll
[1:09:03] just say we because we've all been there
[1:09:05] listening to the seven seal message of
[1:09:08] what is it what is it and the prophet is
[1:09:11] standing
[1:09:12] there and he starts from way back here
[1:09:16] in the beginnings of the
[1:09:17] ministry and takes us clear up to where
[1:09:21] it is right now God and that whole part
[1:09:24] in the seven
[1:09:25] seal it's a walk on the road to
[1:09:29] emus it's showing that it's been him all
[1:09:33] along
[1:09:35] sir remember when Gesa was troubled oh
[1:09:41] oh look at all these enemies and Elisha
[1:09:43] said Lord open his eyes that he can see
[1:09:47] there's more with us than there is
[1:09:49] against us brother bam said God never
[1:09:52] brought the Angels down down he only
[1:09:54] loosened the seeing of his servant to
[1:09:57] see what was always
[1:09:59] [Applause]
[1:10:00] there oh don't you love the Lord yes sir
[1:10:04] oh is God working in
[1:10:07] Simplicity in a many membered body it's
[1:10:10] God operating through your
[1:10:13] life through your life see when we would
[1:10:17] speak the coming of the lord it's almost
[1:10:19] like and forgive me for saying like this
[1:10:22] but it's almost like thoughts of G in
[1:10:24] Gold but no such Simplicity such
[1:10:27] humility how God would so cond incend
[1:10:31] among a people and reveal
[1:10:35] himself and it's with a
[1:10:37] purpose remember that as he come to that
[1:10:41] place now the Bride of Jesus Christ is
[1:10:45] coming to being made
[1:10:47] conformable unto his
[1:10:50] death now I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure
[1:10:53] that there there's things that you've
[1:10:54] went through I've went through or are
[1:10:56] going
[1:10:57] through that we never would have signed
[1:11:00] up for no that's true we wouldn't have
[1:11:04] it's just the truth we wouldn't have
[1:11:05] that's
[1:11:07] right true right there's sometimes where
[1:11:09] there's PL times I remember one time uh
[1:11:12] years ago I got off on roads I thought
[1:11:14] my you know it's when you had to use the
[1:11:16] Rand mcnali Maps um we'll tell the young
[1:11:19] people what that is later but um you
[1:11:21] know where you had to plan your journey
[1:11:23] I thought man man this is a short route
[1:11:24] from here to here I'm going to take that
[1:11:26] route H I took that route and was in the
[1:11:30] early morning hours oh my the roads got
[1:11:34] narrow I was around mountains winding
[1:11:36] and where was this at on the
[1:11:40] map what I thought was a
[1:11:43] shortcut ended up taking me a longer
[1:11:46] time if I had just stayed on the major
[1:11:49] highway cuz it's sure went in the scenic
[1:11:50] route it was dark right
[1:11:56] right you know you know you're in the
[1:11:58] country when you're on a narrow road and
[1:11:59] you got to drive around and underneath
[1:12:01] you know big knobby tires of trucks and
[1:12:03] things like that you know some of you
[1:12:05] get that
[1:12:06] later I would have never taken that
[1:12:08] route right never would there's there's
[1:12:12] things along about even in our journey
[1:12:16] we would have never have signed up for
[1:12:18] but listen it's not saying that
[1:12:20] everything was a predestinated moment
[1:12:23] there are some things yes there were
[1:12:24] decisions that we made that we've had to
[1:12:26] learn from and God has given us Grace
[1:12:29] but yet there are things along the way
[1:12:32] that God knows we had to go through and
[1:12:36] have to go through in order to be made
[1:12:38] conformable unto his death so very true
[1:12:43] that's
[1:12:44] right my I said I was going to read this
[1:12:47] scripture Matthew 6:5 let me just read
[1:12:50] these two when thou prayest Thou shalt
[1:12:52] not be as the hypocrites are for they
[1:12:54] love to pray standing in the synagogues
[1:12:56] and in the corners of the streets that
[1:12:58] they may be seen of men verily I say
[1:13:00] unto you they have their
[1:13:02] reward but thou when thou prayest enter
[1:13:07] into thy
[1:13:09] clauset and when thou Hast shut the door
[1:13:13] pray to the Father which is in secret
[1:13:15] and thy father which seeth in secret
[1:13:17] shall reward thee
[1:13:19] openly I want you just to think of it in
[1:13:21] this in these terms then
[1:13:24] throughout the entirety of this chapter
[1:13:26] 6 I'm not going to read the whole
[1:13:27] entirety of it but this is what I want
[1:13:29] you to extract from that it's it's a
[1:13:31] walk of Faith because as it goes into
[1:13:34] the very next verses are of uh of of the
[1:13:39] The Lord's Prayer thy will be done in
[1:13:41] earth even as it is in heaven then the
[1:13:44] next Scriptures it says uh forgive us
[1:13:47] our debt as we forgive our
[1:13:49] debtors see it's dealing with this is a
[1:13:52] a secret work it's God working there's
[1:13:54] things there's channels there's areas in
[1:13:57] our lives that sometimes we're even
[1:14:01] unaware that God this channel needs to
[1:14:04] be worked on that's so good but God sees
[1:14:08] our heart's desire is to please him so
[1:14:11] God brings us to that place to where our
[1:14:15] will is melded and surrendered to him
[1:14:19] because in his presence listen God does
[1:14:22] not come with his presence to intimidate
[1:14:26] his children right God does not show up
[1:14:29] with his might to cause his children to
[1:14:31] move back that's an Unholy fear but the
[1:14:35] presence of God it brings a reverence to
[1:14:38] know that he is near amenu he's my
[1:14:42] father he's here to he's here to move on
[1:14:45] my behalf he's here to strengthen me
[1:14:47] he's here to encourage me so he's
[1:14:50] seeking so it's submitting ourselves to
[1:14:53] him
[1:14:54] continuously seeking the help of the
[1:14:56] Holy Spirit to uncover all things or
[1:14:59] anything that would hinder his further
[1:15:01] working in our life to the most minute
[1:15:03] little fox to where secret sins no
[1:15:07] longer have a dominion over us to where
[1:15:09] all hurts and even the deepest of things
[1:15:13] working under the surface that prevent a
[1:15:16] real deep working of the Holy Spirit and
[1:15:18] his outworking in our lives is cleared
[1:15:20] out no wonder the prophet could say over
[1:15:22] and over over in perfect strength we
[1:15:25] need a fresh
[1:15:28] killing he said the Tabernacle needs one
[1:15:31] and I need one with it Hallelujah then
[1:15:34] he speaks of the oncoming Ministry of
[1:15:36] Elijah the furtherance he said oh God I
[1:15:40] need a further
[1:15:44] killing brother Brandon would ask for a
[1:15:46] refilling of the holy ghost images of
[1:15:49] Christ he says I want another refilling
[1:15:53] so I can be more of a servant like he
[1:15:57] was
[1:16:00] wow it has nothing to do with our
[1:16:03] feeling it has everything to do with to
[1:16:06] being more of a servant I I need more of
[1:16:08] him and I'll tell you right now I need
[1:16:10] more of him I I I need more of him to be
[1:16:14] more of a servant like he was more of
[1:16:17] that that channel those channels flowing
[1:16:19] through our lives I I think of it the
[1:16:21] more that I've looked at some of the you
[1:16:23] know the different videos and things of
[1:16:25] the Hamas tunnels and the network good
[1:16:27] Lord have mercy I said these people are
[1:16:29] tunnel rats I mean there's tunnels
[1:16:31] everywhere I don't know how they even
[1:16:33] have anything on the
[1:16:34] ground when you see the complexity of it
[1:16:37] but you know what the reality of it is
[1:16:40] is when I look at them tunnels that's
[1:16:42] nothing compared to like the channels in
[1:16:45] our
[1:16:46] lives and yet God himself goes right
[1:16:50] down and God's not putting SpongeBobs in
[1:16:52] our channels oh no that's true but I'll
[1:16:56] tell you what I'm glad that God will
[1:16:57] flood
[1:16:58] them he'll flood us with his presence
[1:17:02] what is it doing what what does that
[1:17:04] flood what does that Revival of the
[1:17:06] spirit of God do it washes out
[1:17:10] trash amen it's called moving down even
[1:17:14] in the the depths of our life sometimes
[1:17:16] Revival isn't altogether things that we
[1:17:20] can see on the surface there's things
[1:17:22] that God can start right here in a
[1:17:25] service and there's things that are
[1:17:26] going on and that things will take place
[1:17:28] in your in your life and God's working
[1:17:31] things out in our life listen do not
[1:17:35] contain Revival to a
[1:17:37] service Revival is not your favorite
[1:17:40] song on the piano Revival is not the
[1:17:43] favorite notes on the organ a Revival is
[1:17:46] a walk with God as a matter of fact the
[1:17:48] prophet said and how can I overcome we
[1:17:50] must never let the SP Spirit of Revival
[1:17:54] die Among
[1:17:55] Us that's true he said we must stay in
[1:17:59] the life the whole time amen keep life
[1:18:03] in you that's
[1:18:05] overcoming that's good preaching
[1:18:07] Hallelujah yes sir oh God flood every
[1:18:10] channel of my life
[1:18:13] amen hallelujah I just say it like this
[1:18:17] God is working
[1:18:19] here and there's a woman on earth if I
[1:18:22] can read first Timothy y
[1:18:24] 2:1 the Bible
[1:18:26] speaks let the woman learn in Silence
[1:18:29] with all
[1:18:31] subjection I will not suffer a woman to
[1:18:34] teach nor to abser authority over the
[1:18:38] man but to be in
[1:18:41] silence I look at that scripture I I'm
[1:18:43] not just
[1:18:44] looking in the natural but I'm looking
[1:18:48] at that as as a type of the Bride of
[1:18:50] Jesus Christ that's good where the Bri
[1:18:52] light of Jesus Christ is hidden away and
[1:18:56] she's coming under the
[1:18:57] word learning in silence but brother
[1:19:00] Samuel I I love just said that all
[1:19:01] Heaven is silent cuz he's here and we're
[1:19:04] in the time of worship oh but our
[1:19:07] silence is not a silence in the secret
[1:19:10] place but we've entered into the secret
[1:19:12] place and the curtains have dropped
[1:19:14] behind us to silence every other voice
[1:19:19] right good preaching are you hearing me
[1:19:22] yes well it's a time of silence for the
[1:19:24] world wonder what God says about this
[1:19:26] wonder what God thinks here wonder what
[1:19:28] this scripture mean what about this but
[1:19:30] in this hour the silence was
[1:19:34] broken God's thoughts concerning his
[1:19:36] word god thoughts concerning you where
[1:19:39] you have looked and said like Sarah
[1:19:41] Abraham did he say anything about me no
[1:19:43] not today did he say anything about no
[1:19:44] no not today did he say no not today did
[1:19:46] he say anything no not today then
[1:19:48] finally Abraham came back in the camp
[1:19:49] one day he said Sarah I've got a message
[1:19:52] from Elohim with you in
[1:19:55] it he said by
[1:19:59] Sarah you're going to have a son and
[1:20:02] he's the one my Covenant is
[1:20:04] with silence was
[1:20:08] Broken
[1:20:11] Hallelujah and God promised he would
[1:20:13] visit Sarah and he
[1:20:16] did Bible visited Sarah and performed
[1:20:20] just exactly what he said he did
[1:20:23] secret work in the tent that's right but
[1:20:26] here it became openly revealed that's
[1:20:29] right Isaac came
[1:20:33] forth you know what Isaac means
[1:20:36] laughter where the devil has tormented
[1:20:38] you what God does in your life you can
[1:20:40] turn around and laugh at him what look
[1:20:43] what God's done in my life look how God
[1:20:45] has changed my life look how God has
[1:20:47] turned my life around look at the
[1:20:49] promise I was looking for but God has
[1:20:51] strengthened me you are the one who gets
[1:20:53] the last
[1:20:56] [Applause]
[1:21:03] laugh no wonder Paul's cutting up when
[1:21:06] he's
[1:21:11] leading 1 Corinthians
[1:21:13] 14:34 I want to just drop these for few
[1:21:16] more verses and then I want to just just
[1:21:18] just pivot here for the last few
[1:21:21] moments let your women keep silence in
[1:21:24] the churches for it is not permitted
[1:21:26] unto them to speak now obviously we we
[1:21:29] understand what Paul's talking about
[1:21:30] that the sisters are not getting up and
[1:21:31] taking a
[1:21:33] text and preaching it ain't talking
[1:21:36] about sitting there without worshiping I
[1:21:38] mean you Worship in your own way right
[1:21:41] you know if you're not a shouter okay
[1:21:43] you're a shouter shout I mean but but
[1:21:45] what it's saying we understand what it's
[1:21:47] saying here but they are commanded to be
[1:21:49] under obedience as also saith the law
[1:21:52] and if they they will learn anything let
[1:21:53] them ask their husbands at home for it
[1:21:56] is a shame for a woman to speak in the
[1:22:00] church aren't you glad that you have
[1:22:03] access right to your husband
[1:22:06] right you don't have to come through a
[1:22:08] pastor God uses pastors it's true God
[1:22:11] uses men but this relationship is
[1:22:13] between you and him
[1:22:16] personally that's what the whole
[1:22:17] preaching of the word is all about not
[1:22:20] for you to become attracted to a man's
[1:22:24] personality but the whole preaching of
[1:22:26] the word is that our relationship with
[1:22:30] Christ would be deepened am we would be
[1:22:34] challenged in our lives like I read that
[1:22:36] scripture what Paul had said I want to
[1:22:38] know him
[1:22:39] deeper I want to know him
[1:22:43] more so while the world they're becoming
[1:22:47] numb the sad reality the ignorance of
[1:22:51] the working of the Lord and his people
[1:22:52] people I want you to think how many live
[1:22:54] in this community around us and don't
[1:22:57] recognize yet God is preparing a people
[1:23:00] for a
[1:23:01] Rapture it's a work that's being done in
[1:23:04] secret yet it's being openly declared
[1:23:06] through your life that is God is still
[1:23:08] working Brother Sam how can that be
[1:23:11] because you're being caught away from
[1:23:14] the things of the world that's so good
[1:23:16] and and and and it shows itself What's
[1:23:18] Done in secret is displaying openly
[1:23:21] that's so good what what kind of church
[1:23:23] are you a part of or what are you a part
[1:23:25] of see and then there's things where
[1:23:27] sometimes they're not even asking to say
[1:23:29] I notice there's a light around you uh
[1:23:32] would you would you mind to request
[1:23:33] prayer in church for so and
[1:23:37] so understand it's it's because in our
[1:23:41] lives though we walk in this world we're
[1:23:43] not of
[1:23:44] it our lives are are caught away our
[1:23:49] souls are caught away we're living in
[1:23:52] this life yes let thy will be done in
[1:23:55] earth even as it is in heaven reflecting
[1:23:58] Heaven here on
[1:24:00] Earth I want to just just skip to this
[1:24:03] place here right here
[1:24:06] tonight and I want to go to the
[1:24:08] scripture in Psalms
[1:24:10] 105 and verse
[1:24:13] 19 and I know you can you can read all
[1:24:16] of this but I just want to hit just a
[1:24:18] couple moments on the life of
[1:24:21] Joseph
[1:24:25] in this scripture I want you to Psalms
[1:24:27] 105: 19 I think Bri and I gave you
[1:24:29] everything there but uh I just go to
[1:24:32] verse 19 until the time that his word
[1:24:38] came whose word God's word concerning
[1:24:42] Joseph that's good pre see it was God's
[1:24:44] word but once he gives it to Joseph it's
[1:24:46] Joseph's word that's right like when
[1:24:49] brother Bram Tex us he says when God
[1:24:50] said uh that you're your seed will
[1:24:53] bruise the head of the serpent he said
[1:24:54] see he said the woman has no seed but
[1:24:56] when God gives it to her it's her seed
[1:24:58] then so until the time that his word
[1:25:02] came the word of the Lord Tried
[1:25:07] Him on through the scriptures and I I
[1:25:09] know I referred to this last week I you
[1:25:12] can read it when you get home but in if
[1:25:15] you go through in Genesis 39 you
[1:25:18] find how that over and over and and this
[1:25:21] to me maybe I'm just a simple guy but
[1:25:23] these are things that have stood out to
[1:25:25] me over the time of here is Joseph he
[1:25:28] sold into slavery now we know it's a
[1:25:30] type but yet here he receives this this
[1:25:34] dream 17 years old when he receives this
[1:25:38] dream but he has no idea what he's going
[1:25:41] to have to go through in order for it to
[1:25:44] come to
[1:25:45] pass that's right it so oh it just must
[1:25:48] be time no it wasn't about time it was
[1:25:51] about God preparing Joseph for his word
[1:25:56] to come to pass through his life that's
[1:25:59] true and so God knows every Avenue every
[1:26:03] Network our channels and God is going to
[1:26:06] work all listen work all things to the
[1:26:09] place to where Joseph or you or me
[1:26:13] cannot glory in anything but
[1:26:19] him and so over and over in the
[1:26:22] scriptures what I I'm just drawn to and
[1:26:24] you can read this in in in Genesis 39
[1:26:26] maybe when you are home over the next
[1:26:28] few days but this to me just it meant
[1:26:30] everything to me when I you know I'm
[1:26:33] looking at this of how the Bible would
[1:26:35] say even in the verse two and the Lord
[1:26:37] was with Joseph you'll find that
[1:26:39] repeated in the scriptures now look the
[1:26:42] Lord was with him Brother Carlos in in
[1:26:45] in a in a way of thinking before of what
[1:26:48] things sometimes that we look at when
[1:26:49] things are happening like what was
[1:26:51] happening with Joseph
[1:26:52] Joseph here he's not done anything to
[1:26:55] his
[1:26:57] Brethren but that we can see
[1:27:00] outwardly but yet here all of this God's
[1:27:04] getting everything lined up getting
[1:27:06] everything in position Joseph doesn't
[1:27:08] know what's taking place but what he
[1:27:12] does know is God has spoke to
[1:27:16] me and when God says it God ain't going
[1:27:19] to lie Hall
[1:27:22] I don't know what's taking place I don't
[1:27:25] know what's going to happen but I know
[1:27:26] this word is going to come to
[1:27:29] pass it may not come to pass the way I
[1:27:32] thought it was going to come to pass but
[1:27:34] it's going to come to pass the way God
[1:27:36] thought it when he spoke it and
[1:27:38] delivered it in my
[1:27:40] heart so what's he doing Joseph well if
[1:27:43] Joseph could come here tonight and stand
[1:27:45] up he could say to you and I God had to
[1:27:48] work out Joseph in order for God's word
[1:27:51] to be be fulfilled through
[1:27:53] [Music]
[1:27:55] Joseph remember remember when we look at
[1:27:59] Joseph's life brother br will continue
[1:28:01] to say this he said you only found one
[1:28:03] scratch against Joseph remember when he
[1:28:05] said to his Brethren he don't don't tell
[1:28:07] him your Shepherds tell them your
[1:28:08] herdsman right but over and over through
[1:28:10] the
[1:28:13] scriptures saying I love that the Lord
[1:28:15] was with him this is not just one time
[1:28:17] over and over through Genesis 39 and the
[1:28:20] and where Joseph was at the Lord blessed
[1:28:23] right I never forget I was just a young
[1:28:27] boy brother Bill you remember
[1:28:30] this you remember when brother Lonnie
[1:28:32] Jenkins came we were over there in
[1:28:34] the and brother Lonnie came and he
[1:28:36] taught on Joseph just a little boy I
[1:28:38] don't know how long young I was but
[1:28:40] brother Jo brother Lonnie he began to
[1:28:41] take this right here and there were
[1:28:42] people in the assembly at the time
[1:28:45] without jobs is that right different
[1:28:47] ones you remember different ones I like
[1:28:49] even even Keith was without one but
[1:28:52] brother Lonnie begin to pre begin to
[1:28:53] speak this and he said look he said when
[1:28:55] God has a work in an area he said God
[1:28:57] will bless that area and Bless the
[1:28:59] people with work he said because for his
[1:29:03] kingdom now I'm just quoting but I'm
[1:29:05] looking at not because I'm saying well
[1:29:08] I'm going to quote brother Lonnie I'm
[1:29:09] looking at the word and what I see is
[1:29:11] that God did not bless Pharaoh's house
[1:29:13] or Piper's house because it was Piper or
[1:29:16] Pharaoh God blessed it because Joseph
[1:29:19] was there Hall
[1:29:24] yes sir and I just say this right here I
[1:29:25] know we all can stand and agree and
[1:29:27] sometimes when doors close that's very
[1:29:29] difficult but but the same God who
[1:29:31] permits a door to be closed is the same
[1:29:33] God that opens another
[1:29:35] door you say how do you know that
[1:29:37] because he said I am the
[1:29:40] door he never said that I'm the dead end
[1:29:42] I'm the
[1:29:45] door any man that comes by me shall go
[1:29:48] in and out and find
[1:29:50] pasture amen that's a
[1:29:54] promise and I'm in his fold I'm one of
[1:29:57] his sheep I'm not made my own he's my
[1:30:00] shepherd the Lord is my shepherd and I
[1:30:03] shall not
[1:30:04] [Applause]
[1:30:06] want Hallelujah the Lord was with
[1:30:09] [Applause]
[1:30:11] Joseph now when I read these scriptures
[1:30:13] here I I see how it says in in in here
[1:30:17] at the end of verse six and it says and
[1:30:19] Joseph was a goodly person and well
[1:30:21] favored it had to have been that even
[1:30:23] though Joseph might have been going
[1:30:26] through times where he would cry cuz
[1:30:28] brother Braham said in Christ the
[1:30:30] mystery in that dungeon he
[1:30:33] suffered sure he suffered sure the Lord
[1:30:37] was with him yeah and he
[1:30:43] suffered think about remember the
[1:30:45] principle we're going through a test or
[1:30:46] trial we come out
[1:30:48] stronger but who's being strengthened
[1:30:52] and who's being
[1:30:53] deprived the inner man is being
[1:30:56] strengthened that's why Paul said though
[1:30:58] are outward men perish our inward man is
[1:31:02] renewed day by day why we need a fresh
[1:31:07] experience every single day though I
[1:31:10] don't know what's going on though I
[1:31:12] don't know how everything is going to
[1:31:13] take place but get out of your tent and
[1:31:15] go get Mana for the
[1:31:16] day go look to the Lord Lord I'm holding
[1:31:19] your word I'm standing on your promise I
[1:31:21] don't anything moving I don't hear
[1:31:23] anything right now but Lord I know
[1:31:25] you're
[1:31:29] working let me come back to that I'm
[1:31:31] just going to skip to this point right
[1:31:33] here and come back to this I want you to
[1:31:35] think of this you realize this let me
[1:31:36] just refer to this point each day the
[1:31:38] sun evaporates a trillion tons of
[1:31:42] water water is the only substance on
[1:31:45] Earth naturally found in three elements
[1:31:48] solid liquid gas think about it and yet
[1:31:52] as brother Brandon would say that over
[1:31:53] and over he'll say it like this in the
[1:31:55] message perseverant 1962 he says see he
[1:31:58] says we in American people we're always
[1:32:00] looking for something big bright and God
[1:32:02] don't do it something we're looking for
[1:32:03] something noisy he said God can draw
[1:32:05] more water with the sun in 5 minutes
[1:32:09] then we can pump out of a noisy pump in
[1:32:10] 40 days that's so good yes sir do you
[1:32:13] hear it right did you hear the
[1:32:15] evaporation now listen friends God's not
[1:32:18] against we're not we're not talking
[1:32:19] about or against noise but I'm talking
[1:32:22] about in the midst of our times where
[1:32:24] the left hand is
[1:32:27] working and job said I can't see him but
[1:32:31] yet you didn't see you did not hear the
[1:32:33] evaporation taking place today right but
[1:32:37] there was over a trillion tons of water
[1:32:41] that has been evaporated off of the
[1:32:43] Earth
[1:32:45] today yes sir what do you think about
[1:32:47] your
[1:32:49] life brother Samuel what did does that
[1:32:51] have to do with my life well you'll see
[1:32:53] in coming Services where God makes known
[1:32:56] to job job what I've been doing in your
[1:32:58] life and God takes him through the
[1:32:59] natural processes of life
[1:33:03] Hallelujah and let's him see all of
[1:33:05] these things that you look at with
[1:33:07] Seasons it's talking about your life all
[1:33:09] you talk about with the with the storms
[1:33:11] coming up the water evaporating the
[1:33:12] clouds it's about your
[1:33:14] life God takes job on a
[1:33:19] journey oh my
[1:33:22] sometimes you wish it could
[1:33:24] just the word of the Lord is so is so
[1:33:27] rich yes it it's encouraging to us I
[1:33:30] don't know about you it's encouraging to
[1:33:31] me it it it strengthens me God knows
[1:33:34] just what I need at this
[1:33:36] moment but here's what let me just let
[1:33:38] me just bring it down to this place I I
[1:33:40] want to read out of the message of
[1:33:43] prisoner uh there's a few other quotes I
[1:33:45] could read but I don't I don't need to
[1:33:47] read them here this could all be
[1:33:48] captured within this
[1:33:50] point
[1:33:53] even in the book of Acts acts
[1:33:58] 7:9 here it says it also regarding
[1:34:01] Joseph God but God was with him I think
[1:34:06] that's
[1:34:07] important we could read you could read
[1:34:10] your test read your trial read things
[1:34:12] are going on but I like the next part
[1:34:15] but God is with
[1:34:17] you but God is with you so all this is
[1:34:21] here in the front but God is with you
[1:34:23] Hall and delivered him out of all his
[1:34:26] afflictions and gave him favor and
[1:34:29] wisdom that that word delivered means
[1:34:31] it's a word to root out so every time
[1:34:34] you know it wasn't God just oh no get
[1:34:37] him out of the prison get him out of
[1:34:39] here no Joseph had to stay in prison for
[1:34:42] periods of time that's right then
[1:34:46] God God
[1:34:47] [Music]
[1:34:49] said it's going to have to be a little
[1:34:51] bit more rubbed out of his life I got to
[1:34:52] let a false accusation come his way I
[1:34:56] got to let a lie be told on
[1:34:58] him and Piper's wife right right falsely
[1:35:03] accuses him right and he goes to
[1:35:07] prison and then the Butler and the baker
[1:35:12] wow the baker you know the dream that
[1:35:14] happened yeah right and you think the
[1:35:16] butler I wonder how many times the
[1:35:18] Joseph said I wonder if that guy forgot
[1:35:19] about me right right
[1:35:23] you know what it was God sealed his
[1:35:26] memory until the appointed time that's
[1:35:30] amen and at the right time oh that's
[1:35:33] right because why it was at that time
[1:35:36] that the gift in his life was needed
[1:35:40] amen that's so good yes sir so let me
[1:35:44] read this quote out of message a
[1:35:48] prisoner brother BR says in paragraph
[1:35:51] 167 I I want to just go through these
[1:35:53] parts and we're and then I'm finished he
[1:35:56] said I want to get to another character
[1:35:57] he says I see one by the name of Joseph
[1:35:59] he was an elected yeah he was an elected
[1:36:03] son he was a perfect type of Jesus
[1:36:05] Christ born a prophet a prophet and now
[1:36:07] he could see a vision when he was yet a
[1:36:08] little boy he saw a vision of himself
[1:36:10] sitting on a throne and his brothers
[1:36:12] bowing to him this last statement right
[1:36:14] here this this is a statement just
[1:36:17] pondered just looked at for years he
[1:36:20] felt like like he was a great
[1:36:23] guy yeah you see it took a prophetic eye
[1:36:26] that's right to see down there in Joseph
[1:36:29] in one of them tunnels ah little bit of
[1:36:33] Pride you feel like you're a great guy
[1:36:36] God said I'm not going to share my glory
[1:36:38] that's right with
[1:36:40] nobody so we got to root that out great
[1:36:44] point and I'm going to get you in
[1:36:45] position where I need you to be see God
[1:36:47] says see sometimes we're interested in
[1:36:50] ah I can get it out of this circumstance
[1:36:51] get out of this and God takes the very
[1:36:53] circumstances the things of life and
[1:36:55] uses them as we'll submit to him to work
[1:36:59] out things in our lives
[1:37:02] absolutely and yet it's not the oh my
[1:37:05] I'm not walking on water no but there's
[1:37:07] water being
[1:37:13] evaporated oh but look what brother said
[1:37:15] what did God have to do he had to do the
[1:37:17] same thing he did to the rest of them
[1:37:18] because Moses was a deliverer Paul was a
[1:37:20] deliver how Joseph was to deliver he
[1:37:22] saved his people from the famine what
[1:37:24] did God have to do to him he put him in
[1:37:26] prison put him right straight to the
[1:37:28] prison remember he was sold by his
[1:37:30] Brethren to an Egyptian and they sold
[1:37:32] him to Piper and Piper gave him a little
[1:37:34] bit of Liberty and the first thing you
[1:37:35] know that was taken from him man there's
[1:37:39] a lot could preach here and there he set
[1:37:42] in the
[1:37:43] prison what's that say
[1:37:47] crying
[1:37:50] crying
[1:37:52] God had to
[1:37:54] strip
[1:37:56] it all the time he was in prison listen
[1:37:59] this is what's important all the time he
[1:38:01] was in prison Joseph got on Facebook and
[1:38:05] let everybody know the
[1:38:07] [Applause]
[1:38:09] conditions come on friends sometimes I
[1:38:11] understand we talk with one another and
[1:38:12] sometimes there's things that we listen
[1:38:15] this isn't anything of shaming but I
[1:38:16] hope you understand that some of the
[1:38:18] times when we come into that moment
[1:38:20] right there jph himself while he was in
[1:38:23] prison God was stripping him down it's
[1:38:27] what you're looking to in those moments
[1:38:29] that
[1:38:30] matters it matters listen this is how
[1:38:34] honest I would be and I'm telling you as
[1:38:36] I would be because I Am Lord forgive me
[1:38:39] for my complaining help me Lord oh help
[1:38:43] me oh yeah why cuz complaining weakens
[1:38:47] Faith right yes
[1:38:49] sir oh oh
[1:38:52] my now listen if I get home tonight or
[1:38:56] have some other time and I have to and
[1:38:57] my back or my hip is hurting me I don't
[1:38:59] say hey honey I I tell you what when my
[1:39:02] hip is hurting me or my back is hurting
[1:39:03] me and she don't look at me and say
[1:39:05] shame on you Son of God you ought to
[1:39:07] speak to that thing no no that ain't
[1:39:10] complaining that just means you know
[1:39:12] what I need a nice comfy chair to sit
[1:39:14] down in maybe a little bit of Molin and
[1:39:17] maybe you know a tortilla with some ham
[1:39:19] and cheese in it so I can take the
[1:39:23] maybe that ain't real spiritual but that
[1:39:25] ain't complaining that's right
[1:39:27] complaining is where we're going and
[1:39:28] just talking and talking and talking and
[1:39:32] talking that's right he could remember
[1:39:36] that the vision said that he was going
[1:39:38] to sit on a throne and his brothers was
[1:39:39] going to bow to him because he knew that
[1:39:42] his gift come from God and he knew it
[1:39:44] had to come to pass my goodness this is
[1:39:48] powerful if we could only keep that in
[1:39:52] our mind and according to the word of
[1:39:55] God that in these last days he's going
[1:39:57] to have a church he's going to have a
[1:39:59] people and these things that he promised
[1:40:00] he's going to do it he said he would and
[1:40:02] we're living in the time we're there
[1:40:04] he's just trying to get us to be real
[1:40:06] prisoners now locked in with
[1:40:10] him Ram says you heard the old song then
[1:40:13] I'm shut in with god oh I said I want to
[1:40:15] be shut in with God it's where I thought
[1:40:17] about this being shut in with God
[1:40:19] nothing else you only move When God Says
[1:40:21] move you only do as God says do then
[1:40:23] you're shut in with God now watch this I
[1:40:26] know it's a long it's a long quote but
[1:40:28] I'm I'm getting down there I'm getting
[1:40:29] down there brother Bram says look he
[1:40:32] says he was
[1:40:34] thinking he became a total failure to
[1:40:39] himself all that he knew all that he
[1:40:42] understood and everything he become a
[1:40:45] total failure it didn't work he was put
[1:40:49] under a situation to where that nobody
[1:40:52] would listen to him he was a prisoner he
[1:40:55] was put in a situation unbelievers would
[1:40:57] not even
[1:40:58] believe his ministry was of none effect
[1:41:02] the people turned their head they
[1:41:03] wouldn't pay attention to him in prison
[1:41:05] what good would his ministry do now if
[1:41:07] you'll realize this in this quote
[1:41:09] brother brandham is also talking about
[1:41:12] where he's standing presently yeah
[1:41:15] that's right cuz he's just preached
[1:41:18] standing in the
[1:41:19] Gap and through this whole month of July
[1:41:22] he's continuing to request
[1:41:25] prayer that God would help me to be more
[1:41:30] humble to gain the feeling back for the
[1:41:33] people what good would his ministry do
[1:41:36] he might stand to the prison bars and
[1:41:37] preach to him walk up and down the
[1:41:39] street but he became a prisoner and God
[1:41:41] kept him a prisoner until the will got
[1:41:43] rolled up right and then he said here's
[1:41:46] my man brother Braham said Glory total
[1:41:49] failure
[1:41:52] finally God came to him in his prison
[1:41:55] like Paul and the rest of him he used I
[1:41:57] love this I love this statement he used
[1:42:00] the gift that he had give him to get him
[1:42:04] out of
[1:42:05] there what do you think is going to get
[1:42:07] you and me out of Satan's Eden is the
[1:42:10] gift that he's placed in our life what
[1:42:13] gift is that that soul that come from
[1:42:15] God the quickening power on the inside
[1:42:18] we have been raised up from Death unto
[1:42:20] life
[1:42:21] so what is it that not only getting us
[1:42:23] in a Rapture but in every situation of
[1:42:25] life it's
[1:42:27] yielding to the inside
[1:42:30] man it's yielding to the inner man it's
[1:42:34] yielding to the Lord and saying
[1:42:37] God work out every bit of feeling of
[1:42:43] greatness feeling of greatness see
[1:42:45] sometimes greatness itself isn't all
[1:42:47] together where we look at and say well I
[1:42:49] drive this better than this and I drive
[1:42:51] this better than this but sometimes just
[1:42:52] the thoughts that can move through a
[1:42:55] life can be well I'm a more of a
[1:42:58] Christian than they are let me just tell
[1:43:00] you what that's called Pride that's good
[1:43:05] sure everybody looks better in their own
[1:43:09] homemade
[1:43:12] mirror everybody's got their favorite
[1:43:14] mirror the one that makes them look like
[1:43:16] this size when
[1:43:19] they're right everybody looks good in
[1:43:23] their own sight but I want to know how I
[1:43:25] look in his
[1:43:26] sight that that's that's that that's
[1:43:28] what I'm interested in that right there
[1:43:30] keeps me busy right
[1:43:33] there my burden is for everybody but
[1:43:35] that keeps me
[1:43:37] busy let's
[1:43:39] stand there's a lot more to that quote
[1:43:41] but out of a message prisoners right
[1:43:43] towards the very
[1:43:44] end brother Bram I think one of the key
[1:43:47] things brother Bram said he constantly
[1:43:48] remembered he was born for a purpose I
[1:43:50] think oh oh God this is the thing to
[1:43:53] remember in the midst of tests and
[1:43:54] trials to
[1:43:56] remember that we've been born for a
[1:43:59] purpose God's got a purpose we're still
[1:44:02] here he's not finished with us
[1:44:05] yet brother Bram said in this part of it
[1:44:08] he said before his vision could be
[1:44:10] completely fulfilled he had to become a
[1:44:13] prisoner and then he could become a
[1:44:15] ruler when he come from prison house he
[1:44:18] become a prisoner to the word of God and
[1:44:20] only would say what God would put in his
[1:44:22] mouth then God moved through
[1:44:26] him I wonder about this vision of the
[1:44:29] word that we're we're under this vision
[1:44:32] is clear the Bible brother BR would
[1:44:34] refer to this out of
[1:44:37] habac he' refer to it when he's talking
[1:44:39] about Joseph here in Christ the mystery
[1:44:42] that we know that the vision must surely
[1:44:45] come to pass I believe it is I believe
[1:44:48] the vision is living out absolutely I I
[1:44:50] believe that I'm not I'm not looking for
[1:44:52] something way off down the line I
[1:44:54] believe I believe it's working out in
[1:44:56] our lives and I believe the real as the
[1:44:59] word is working through our lives as the
[1:45:02] word goes down and moving
[1:45:05] through the tunnels and the channels
[1:45:08] through our lives you know Israel has
[1:45:10] things that they'll go right over the
[1:45:12] Earth right over that of Gaza and they
[1:45:15] can detect just with that equipment that
[1:45:18] they have be able to detect that there's
[1:45:20] tunnels
[1:45:22] underneath they can detect
[1:45:25] that how much
[1:45:28] more does God himself
[1:45:30] know what lays beneath the surface in
[1:45:33] our life absolutely well you might say
[1:45:35] well brother Samuel I don't have nothing
[1:45:37] hidden from God I'm not saying that you
[1:45:39] do that's right because you know if you
[1:45:41] hide anything you won't Prosper but I
[1:45:44] look at another scripture where David
[1:45:46] would ask Lord do not let presumptuous
[1:45:50] sins have dominion over me you know what
[1:45:53] presumptuous is
[1:45:55] prideful don't let them have dominion
[1:45:57] over me right Lord search out every
[1:46:00] Avenue and every channel of my life in
[1:46:02] other words things that I don't even see
[1:46:05] about myself that's hindering your
[1:46:08] working in my
[1:46:10] life Lord I don't want them to have
[1:46:13] dominion I've got one that I'm I want to
[1:46:16] be under obedience to that's the word of
[1:46:18] God yes sir I'm asking as my husband
[1:46:21] Lord help me help me the word that I'm
[1:46:24] hearing here the word that's encouraging
[1:46:27] me I've got an access to you you're my
[1:46:30] husband hallelujah oh Lord change me
[1:46:34] Lord let that word just so work Lord let
[1:46:36] it let it move in the depths of my life
[1:46:38] I I want to know you more I want to know
[1:46:41] you more I want to know you deeper
[1:46:44] Lord think of this this very thing right
[1:46:47] here this is something to me that's just
[1:46:49] so powerful as D is
[1:46:51] Joseph he gets
[1:46:55] married but before his Brethren ever
[1:46:58] stand before him he's had two
[1:47:03] children he names the first he names
[1:47:06] Manasseh and
[1:47:12] Ephraim Manasseh means
[1:47:16] God hath made me to forget yes all the
[1:47:22] toil from my father's house Hallelujah
[1:47:26] you see it wasn't mind over matter but
[1:47:28] he received a seed of life yes God hath
[1:47:32] birthed forgiveness in my life
[1:47:35] Hallelujah I could never have stood
[1:47:38] there before my
[1:47:39] brethren but God has birthed forgiveness
[1:47:44] Amen in my life so good yes sir now I'll
[1:47:47] tell you friends you or me we can't we
[1:47:50] can't can't do the manasse on our own no
[1:47:53] but he can amen he can provide if we'll
[1:47:56] just provide the open womb say Lord let
[1:47:59] your word just so work and move in my
[1:48:02] life there's things that I I want to
[1:48:04] forget meaning forget in other words
[1:48:07] where I no longer hold any strings of
[1:48:11] emotion to that memory
[1:48:14] whatsoever where there's no ought where
[1:48:17] there's no grudge in other words no
[1:48:19] presumptuous sin reigning over my life
[1:48:24] what did God have to do to Joseph took
[1:48:26] him to
[1:48:27] prison because that one little speck he
[1:48:30] felt like he was a great
[1:48:32] guy what made him feel like he was a
[1:48:34] great guy he had received a vision of
[1:48:37] the
[1:48:37] word you see why God has to bring even
[1:48:40] tests and trials in our life we have
[1:48:42] received the most glorious message
[1:48:45] that's ever struck the face of the Earth
[1:48:47] yes sir and God knows you and me we need
[1:48:50] his help to stay humble so that he can
[1:48:54] use us yes think of it you me we didn't
[1:48:58] go sear searching for God he sought us
[1:49:01] out it wasn't us searching there was a
[1:49:03] longing but God put that longing it was
[1:49:05] God drawing Upon Our Lives but it was
[1:49:07] God who found you and
[1:49:10] I oh God when I when I look at these
[1:49:13] things and look at am in that right Lord
[1:49:15] just help me help me to become a
[1:49:17] prisoner like Paul could say prisoner ER
[1:49:21] of Jesus Christ that's that's what I
[1:49:22] want to be I don't want to be a prisoner
[1:49:24] in my feelings no more I don't want to
[1:49:26] be a prisoner in my feelings I don't
[1:49:27] want to be a prisoner a prisoner to My
[1:49:29] reasonings my thoughts I don't want to
[1:49:31] be a prisoner to the past of something
[1:49:34] in the past I want to be a prisoner of
[1:49:37] Jesus
[1:49:41] Christ let me just be shut in with you
[1:49:43] Lord let all the curtains of the world
[1:49:45] just just drop around me just drop
[1:49:48] around me I tell you friends I I believe
[1:49:50] with all my heart right here tonight
[1:49:53] that if there's anything there could be
[1:49:54] any hold any channel God knows in our
[1:49:57] lives he's not asking you to come to
[1:49:59] terms with it as far as find it in your
[1:50:00] life but he knows right where it's at
[1:50:02] but if we could just have that real open
[1:50:04] sincerity with him tonight to say Lord
[1:50:06] there might be something you do know
[1:50:08] about your life there might be something
[1:50:10] some something in your life maybe it's a
[1:50:12] besetting sin maybe it's something in
[1:50:14] your life that you say I just can't seem
[1:50:15] to get Beyond this I I it's just
[1:50:18] something it just it perplexes maybe
[1:50:20] it's a feeling maybe it's something from
[1:50:22] the past something you've experienced
[1:50:25] that there's no medicine by a doctor
[1:50:26] that can bring healing to it that's
[1:50:28] right that's good but he's still Jehovah
[1:50:32] RFA he specializes in going down
[1:50:36] tunnels and areas where Satan would like
[1:50:39] to terrorize you but he'll come down
[1:50:41] through
[1:50:43] there Glory
[1:50:47] Hallelujah he's the same God that can
[1:50:49] take take places in your life where the
[1:50:51] enemy has terrorized the same God who
[1:50:54] turns the desert into a
[1:50:57] blossom Hallelujah the same almighty God
[1:51:01] move right down into areas in your life
[1:51:03] then you might say Brother Sam I want it
[1:51:05] to be done like that overnight remember
[1:51:07] just let him start working amen right
[1:51:10] where you first start is it just just
[1:51:12] just surrendering Joseph didn't get
[1:51:14] where he was overnight but Brother
[1:51:16] Carlos for that to say he was goodly
[1:51:20] person well- favored Brother Ray that
[1:51:22] meant he wasn't walking around
[1:51:24] complaining saying can you believe she
[1:51:27] lied on
[1:51:29] me he might have felt listen he was
[1:51:32] human no doubt he had some of those
[1:51:34] feelings but if he would have kept that
[1:51:37] you would not have read
[1:51:38] this you would have read this is a guy
[1:51:41] nobody wants to be
[1:51:43] around cuz he's sure to bring everybody
[1:51:47] down how did he how did he live like
[1:51:50] this because he remembered the word that
[1:51:53] God gave himall I tell you friends let
[1:51:55] me just say it to you if God has given
[1:51:57] you two words that's more than enough to
[1:52:00] whip hell
[1:52:01] with yes sir it's more to than to
[1:52:04] withstand every tide of the
[1:52:07] enemy this is why you could take the
[1:52:09] simplest shortest scripture Jesus wept
[1:52:12] and preach and preach and preach with it
[1:52:16] Hallelujah because one word from him
[1:52:19] means more
[1:52:20] [Applause]
[1:52:22] than
[1:52:25] anything I just say Lord whatever your
[1:52:28] need is tonight Lord be it unto me
[1:52:32] according to Thy word am whatever it is
[1:52:35] here tonight
[1:52:36] Lorden I I accept that Lord dying to
[1:52:40] myself dying more to me Lord just daily
[1:52:43] in my life
[1:52:45] moving because we looked at that
[1:52:47] assimilating let letting the word just
[1:52:51] just be absorbed in our life less of me
[1:52:54] and More Of You
[1:52:57] Lord
[1:52:59] father thank you for your mercy
[1:53:05] tonight Lord through these
[1:53:07] past few Services I think it's been
[1:53:10] eight parts
[1:53:12] now where you've taken us on this Lord
[1:53:15] within his
[1:53:17] hands what I know from me and my life

[1:53:28] afternoon many of these things begin to
[1:53:31] converge Lord as I was on a
[1:53:33] walk thinking about that of the left

[1:53:40] heart some things even that I'd heard

[1:55:04] left hand's doing you've asked us Lord
[1:55:07] that in our lives Matthew 6 the whole
[1:55:10] working of the word is a submitting of
[1:55:13] ourselves in your
