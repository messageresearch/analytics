[51:42] Hebrews chapter 4 and verse 12 and also
[51:45] I would like to read another scripture
[51:48] also from Philippians chapter
[51:51] 4 and verse 8. let's read Hebrews 4 and
[51:58] 12 First
[51:59] for the word of God is quick and
[52:02] Powerful
[52:03] and sharper than any
[52:06] two edges word piercing even to the
[52:10] dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit and
[52:15] of the joys and Morrow and it's a
[52:18] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[52:22] the heart
[52:23] Philippians chapter 4 verse 8.

[55:40] I would like to title this evening time
[55:42] the the sermon this message when you

[55:50] when you begin to think his thoughts I
[55:54] would like to take this back
[56:02] my brothers and sisters
[56:04] most of my English I have learned by
[56:07] listening to brother Branham tapes
[56:10] so I've got a little accent and my words
[56:14] maybe sometime I speak a little
[56:17] Kentuckian accent because you know I
[56:21] went to you know message of the hour you
[56:24] know school you know
[56:26] [Laughter]
[56:27] praise the Lord you know see the burning
[56:31] desire
[56:33] the Zeal for the word of God made me to
[56:36] speak this much English and to speak and
[56:40] to read and to to to you know to do
[56:43] something for the Lord you know but uh
[56:45] you know when I was uh you know when I
[56:47] was started preaching I just uh you know
[56:50] uh was very nervous but even though
[56:54] every time at my home church I feel
[56:57] nervous I get nervous you know but uh
[57:00] when we submit ourselves into the mighty
[57:03] hands of almighty God then he will come
[57:05] on the scene you know because he said
[57:08] without him without him we can't do
[57:12] nothing you know we can't do nothing so
[57:14] praise the name of the Lord you love the
[57:17] word
[57:18] amen when you begin to think his
[57:20] thoughts like uh you know we think every
[57:24] person every man every woman every
[57:28] country you know in in this world we
[57:31] have different uh types of people

[57:36] denominations so everybody has got their
[57:40] own way of thinking

[57:46] so sometimes the cultures
[57:49] makes your mindset you know the the
[57:53] cultures the Customs the Traditions you
[57:56] know but uh you know we brother Branham
[57:59] said we are strangers and uh uh pilgrims

[58:24] and someone said his mind is full of us
[58:29] he is mindful of us

[58:53] his Redemption plan he redeemed us from
[58:55] the sin of this world and he brought us
[58:58] together to Fellowship in Heavenly
[59:01] places in Christ Jesus

[59:09] means his way of thinking when it comes
[59:12] into us we will be like a god

[1:06:34] something comes negative right he said
[1:06:37] well you say I can't help the thoughts

[1:06:50] something trying to put something in
[1:06:53] your mind see and we can't help
[1:06:57] that these thoughts are coming into our
[1:06:59] mind
[1:07:00] see here here brother random said you
[1:07:04] know I can't help
[1:07:06] the thoughts from coming well that will
[1:07:09] be like the farmers say that said he
[1:07:12] could stop the birds from flying over
[1:07:15] his place but he could sure stop them
[1:07:19] from roosting
[1:07:22] I like that amen so that's a good thing
[1:07:27] you see you can't help the thoughts when
[1:07:30] they come but don't entertain them
[1:07:35] whatever the Satan is coming whenever
[1:07:38] the Satan comes and tells you about
[1:07:40] something about the message or about
[1:07:42] your life about your about about your
[1:07:45] church about your ministry about your
[1:07:47] about your family about your personal
[1:07:50] life
[1:07:51] don't entertain them
[1:07:55] we are not supposed to entertain them
[1:07:58] right
[1:07:59] we are not here to entertain them we are
[1:08:03] not here to get that satanic mind in US
[1:08:07] let the mind of Christ be in here the
[1:08:11] word
[1:08:12] amen the word is God
[1:08:15] when you begin to take his thoughts then
[1:08:19] you whatever you speak
[1:08:21] it will be removed
[1:08:24] you can speak brother Brandon said you
[1:08:26] can create
[1:08:28] right we have that Authority the power
[1:08:31] amen we have the right to speak the word
[1:08:35] because the word comes into your mouth
[1:08:37] in our mouth before we speak it will be
[1:08:40] in our mind in our heart we will think
[1:08:42] amen praise the Lord here brother don't
[1:08:45] entertain them just pass it on no sir
[1:08:49] Jesus Is My Savior All Things Are Mine
[1:08:52] by God and I am going to keep them I'm
[1:08:55] going to testify of them I'm going to
[1:08:58] preach the word I'm going to testify I'm
[1:09:02] going to do something for the Lord I'm
[1:09:04] going to testify about this message I I
[1:09:07] Proclaim my healing I speak for a
[1:09:11] Deliverance I speak for a victory
[1:09:14] because I am in his mind
[1:09:19] praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:09:21] brothers and sisters here brother
[1:09:24] Branham said and now a word is a thought
[1:09:26] expressed first it must be a thought and
[1:09:30] then it becomes a word because you do
[1:09:33] not speak your words without a thought
[1:09:38] we can't speak
[1:09:40] because whatever we are thinking
[1:09:42] whatever in our heart whatever is in our
[1:09:45] mind so then we speak
[1:09:47] we express that words by our mouth by
[1:09:51] our lips see so that means we got to
[1:09:56] receive something inside
[1:09:59] Jesus knocking our door
[1:10:01] and we are the responsible people to
[1:10:05] open to unlock the door and invite our
[1:10:08] Lord Jesus Christ which is the word
[1:10:11] amen and let the word come in the
[1:10:14] scripture says let the word of Christ
[1:10:17] dwell in you in all in in all wisdom and
[1:10:21] richly
[1:10:23] when we receive Christ like Prophet said
[1:10:26] when you receive the word you will
[1:10:29] become the word
[1:10:30] amen when we've received the word see
[1:10:34] that means before he comes before he
[1:10:37] enter before he comes into your heart
[1:10:40] before he enter into our heart then
[1:10:42] something has to go out from us
[1:10:45] that means we have to die of our own
[1:10:49] thinking we have to take out all the
[1:10:52] garbage all the trash whatever inside of
[1:10:55] us we got to remove all these things and
[1:10:59] clean the house and let the Holy Spirit
[1:11:01] come inside and give him a preeminence
[1:11:05] in our life
[1:11:06] put God fast amen
[1:11:09] oh I feel so happy amen
[1:11:12] glory to God here brother Abraham said
[1:11:16] then when the human elements goes out
[1:11:20] and the spirit of God fills the vacancy
[1:11:25] praise God Hallelujah where you empty
[1:11:29] yourself amen
[1:11:32] then we'll be when the church in its
[1:11:35] power of the resurrection of Lord Jesus
[1:11:38] will walk in his steps in his power in
[1:11:42] his thoughts
[1:11:44] glory to God

[1:11:49] there is something in you the Rapture is
[1:11:52] in you the healing is in you the
[1:11:54] resurrection power is in you amen amen
[1:11:59] one of these days we are not going to
[1:12:01] stay in this you know
[1:12:04] wrong body and wrong Garden
[1:12:08] we are living in wrong body
[1:12:10] and wrong Garden
[1:12:12] hallelujah praise the Lord here brother
[1:12:16] Branham said in his being in his moving
[1:12:18] you see what I mean then your thought
[1:12:22] will become words
[1:12:25] and words we come become will become
[1:12:28] material that's when the church in its
[1:12:30] power
[1:12:31] that's the power what is the power of
[1:12:35] the church the power of the church is
[1:12:37] the word of God
[1:12:39] the power
[1:12:41] the power of the church is the message
[1:12:44] of the hour the power of the church is
[1:12:47] the Holy Spirit
[1:12:48] the power is overcoming the power amen

[1:34:35] amen when you begin to think his Source
[1:34:38] my brothers and sisters I can tell you
[1:34:41] hundreds and hundreds of testimonies
[1:34:44] because sometimes we are human beings
[1:34:48] but uh don't uh give up don't feel bad
[1:34:52] don't worry the new birth is like a
[1:34:55] process every natural birth it's totally
[1:34:58] you know type to the Natural birth the
[1:35:00] new birth and the and the spiritual
[1:35:02] birth is a it's a type you know even
[1:35:05] though you know my children you know
[1:35:06] they're born to me they are my children
[1:35:09] my cell of faith my Susan Elizabeth my
[1:35:11] Samuel you know they born to me but you
[1:35:14] know what they do mistakes they did
[1:35:16] mistakes they do all kinds of wrongs and
[1:35:18] mistakes you know well they're you know
[1:35:20] you know when they start walking they
[1:35:23] will fall down
[1:35:24] when they speak in the beginning you
[1:35:26] know in the first time you know they
[1:35:28] they may they make mistakes
[1:35:31] but we are not taking that as an excuse
[1:35:33] or you know we understand as our as a
[1:35:37] parents we understand as a father have
[1:35:39] that that experience
[1:35:41] so when they are doing something mistake
[1:35:43] or wrong or something then I understand
[1:35:46] them very well
[1:35:48] and I'll help them I try to help them
[1:35:52] I tried to do something the same way I
[1:35:55] don't I don't want to deny them I don't
[1:35:57] want to uh you know say oh you doing all
[1:36:00] these mistakes oh you you're not born to
[1:36:03] me you're not my children you're not my
[1:36:05] my son you're not my I can't say that
[1:36:09] even
[1:36:11] they have borne to me
[1:36:13] even I'm a father to them
[1:36:15] they do mistakes
[1:36:18] every every you know children have their
[1:36:20] thing
[1:36:21] but what I'm trying to say is
[1:36:24] when we are born again when we are we
[1:36:28] got a new birth God gave God beget us
[1:36:32] the scripture says James 1 18 he began
[1:36:35] Us by his word
[1:36:38] so he begat Us by his word so when he
[1:36:42] begat us when we are born to him the
[1:36:45] scripture says they are not by the they
[1:36:48] were not born by the blood or will of
[1:36:51] man or will of Flesh you know they're
[1:36:55] born to God how God began them
[1:36:57] God began them by his spoken word
[1:37:01] so the spoken word see it is inside that
[1:37:05] gave us the new verse a supernatural
[1:37:08] verse a new verse a baptism of the Holy
[1:37:11] Spirit even though we have that even
[1:37:14] though we are coming to church we are
[1:37:16] praying we are reading we are having
[1:37:18] Services sometimes we do some mistakes

[1:37:28] know what brother sister he is our
[1:37:30] father

[1:37:35] negative thoughts
[1:37:37] but accidentally we are making some
[1:37:39] mistake or falling down did some wrong
[1:37:42] the following mistake you doing
[1:37:43] something but God what is doing you know
[1:37:46] he is taking care of his own family
[1:37:51] God is taking care of his own his mind
[1:37:55] is full he is mindful of us and his mind
[1:38:00] is full of us amen

[1:38:08] and uh here my brothers and sisters I
[1:38:11] don't know
[1:38:13] how it's 8 30.
[1:38:15] but anyway last quote I read last quote
[1:38:18] and I turned the service to the man of
[1:38:19] God I don't want to put you long I know
[1:38:22] your people trying to you know go to
[1:38:24] your home and uh you know I know you
[1:38:26] know but my brothers and sisters it's a
[1:38:30] a privilege to be here amen but I would
[1:38:34] like to read a last quote and I give it
[1:38:36] to turn the service to the man of God
[1:38:38] here brother Branham said you will um
[1:38:41] it said uh now but when a man will do he
[1:38:45] will hear a little something and keep
[1:38:47] moving his papers well now you will
[1:38:50] never find Christ moving your papers
[1:38:53] and and he said you have to move your
[1:38:56] thoughts
[1:38:58] and he said you have to move your
[1:39:00] thinking and get away from reason and
[1:39:03] move your thoughts from your own way of
[1:39:06] thinking to what God thinks
[1:39:09] let the mind that was in Christ Jesus be
[1:39:13] in you and then when you begin see what
[1:39:17] here brother Graham said and then when
[1:39:20] you begin to think he starts
[1:39:25] you will begin to leave his life
[1:39:29] that's the main thing when you begin to
[1:39:32] think his thoughts you will begin to
[1:39:34] live his life and do the things that he
[1:39:37] did see what I mean now because it is
[1:39:41] not you it's Christ
[1:39:44] when we begin to think his thoughts
[1:39:48] we possess the gates of the enemy we we
[1:39:53] speak the word we profess he confess a
[1:39:57] good confession amen he think the kind
[1:40:01] of thoughts he would think through you

[1:53:03] with application but by his strength we
[1:53:07] can do all things
[1:53:09] when the Lord has spoken to us here
[1:53:10] tonight in this manner it's to admonish
[1:53:13] us because his desire is that his life
[1:53:16] would be uninhibited that it would be
[1:53:19] able to flow through our lives
[1:53:21] and you know so many times there's
[1:53:22] thoughts all kinds of thoughts can come

[1:53:28] your mind and there's so many different
[1:53:30] ways as the brother was mentioning here

[1:53:40] but the realm says Satan has wearied me
[1:53:42] all day
[1:53:45] telling me that people aren't going to
[1:53:46] get this
[1:53:49] but he says I come and stand here
[1:53:50] tonight he said and I see the response
[1:53:53] of the word
[1:53:55] you see it's it's important that you
[1:53:57] point you point it right back back at
[1:53:59] him and say
[1:54:00] see
[1:54:02] be here look what God has done for me
[1:54:05] you know brother Brown tells us he says
[1:54:06] I'm not Beyond getting those weary and
[1:54:09] gloomy feelings in uniting time and sign
[1:54:11] perfect Faith he starts out speaking
[1:54:13] he's the way he gets it where it'll come
[1:54:15] to him and say nobody wants to hear you
[1:54:17] nobody cares he said but then I look he
[1:54:19] says and I see people that are staying
[1:54:21] here for the second service from
[1:54:23] this particular State he said I I point
[1:54:26] to him and say what about that
[1:54:29] that we need to do that what about that

[1:54:35] oh my what about his blood that was shed
[1:54:38] for you and me

[1:54:42] you and I out
