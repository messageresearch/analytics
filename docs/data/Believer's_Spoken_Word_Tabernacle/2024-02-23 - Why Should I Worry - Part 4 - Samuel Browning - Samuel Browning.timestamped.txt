[36:00] let's turn in our bibles if you would to
[36:02] job
[36:07] 23 and uh you probably already know
[36:10] where we're going now but I I don't want
[36:13] to let that thought
[36:16] uh move by
[36:18] we've where we're drawing this from and
[36:21] then we'll just keep moving but job 23
[36:24] and
[36:25] verse
[36:30] 13 the scripture said he is of one mind
[36:33] and who can turn him and what his soul
[36:36] desireth even that he doeth for he
[36:41] performeth the thing that is appointed
[36:43] for me and many such things are with him
[36:48] therefore am I troubled at his presence
[36:51] and when I consider I am afraid of him
[36:55] for God made maketh my heart soft and
[36:59] the almighty troubleth me because I was
[37:02] not cut off before the darkness neither
[37:06] hath he covered the darkness from my
[37:09] face I want to read to you again where
[37:11] I've I've been reading out of this quote
[37:13] I have heard but now I
[37:15] see Bram said job had something wrong
[37:19] with him how many you ever had that
[37:21] something wrong with you something
[37:23] that's just where things just aren't
[37:25] exactly right or just exactly in line
[37:29] absolutely job had something wrong with
[37:31] him but he couldn't get the inspiration
[37:35] on him and it was worrying him and when
[37:39] you get in that kind of a fix that's
[37:41] when the enemy moves into every friend
[37:45] nearly you got amen may God bless you
[37:49] bless the reading of the words you're
[37:51] being seated we've been looking at this
[37:53] here for a few services within that
[37:57] thought of why should I worry and we as
[38:02] we've looked at this and seen this that
[38:05] worry itself it actually doesn't start
[38:08] out as worry it begins just with a
[38:11] concern and a concern itself is totally
[38:14] acceptable there'll be things that we
[38:16] will be concerned with or concerned
[38:19] about and I think there are some things
[38:21] that we can definitely see that are more
[38:23] value as far as to be concerned about
[38:26] than other things and Satan's always
[38:29] busy to try to divert our attention onto
[38:32] the things that really don't even hold
[38:34] as much or the real value not that they
[38:37] can't have value but he would always
[38:39] always is interested in diverting our
[38:41] attention from the things that we need
[38:43] to be the most concerned about and
[38:46] obviously what we is to be the most
[38:48] concerned in our life is that we are
[38:51] where we should be with the Lord and
[38:54] that each and every day that our Liv
[38:56] life is walking daily in step with him
[38:59] it should be the concern of our life and
[39:01] as a Believer when the spirit of God has
[39:03] moved into your heart that's the that
[39:05] the prophet talked about the tension
[39:08] that we have daily is am I pleasing to
[39:11] my Lord so there's a concern about our
[39:13] life so concern itself is not anything
[39:16] that's wrong or that's bad but there's
[39:18] things that I'm sure that every one of
[39:20] us have maybe you're getting ready to go
[39:22] to sleep at night or maybe here you are
[39:24] in the middle of something and you know
[39:26] it seems like it always wants to strike
[39:28] when you're getting down to pray or when
[39:30] you're getting ready to read or when
[39:32] you're getting ready maybe on your way
[39:33] to church and there'll be a concern and
[39:36] and sometimes those concerns are valid
[39:38] concerns but isn't it amazing that those
[39:40] things will always strike you at some of
[39:43] those moments and those times and then
[39:45] you're getting ready to go to sleep at
[39:47] times I'm sure every one of us have had
[39:48] this and you can all of a sudden they'll
[39:50] just be something drop up your mind and
[39:53] it isn't something that is delightful
[39:55] it's something that may be a thought and
[39:57] and you begin to think upon that thought
[39:59] and before you know it where you were
[40:00] tired and ready to go to sleep and you
[40:03] thought praise the Lord I'm getting to
[40:05] bed at a good time tonight it's 11:00
[40:07] 11:30 thank you Lord I'm I'm getting to
[40:10] bed early tonight and then that drops
[40:12] and you're just like there goes any part
[40:16] of going to sleep and we have all come
[40:19] into those moments and times you know
[40:21] and we of course there's ways that the
[40:23] Lord will help us as we can see that
[40:25] there situ ations we can become very
[40:28] worried about and at that time of the
[40:30] night we're not going to solve them
[40:31] we're not going to do anything about it
[40:33] a matter of fact even in 6:00 in the
[40:35] morning we're not going to solve them
[40:37] but it's when we can recognize when
[40:39] those things come that where we go and
[40:41] we take it to the Lord who is over
[40:43] everything in our life I'm glad we've
[40:46] got a place that we can go to in him
[40:48] that he's a strong Refuge that when
[40:50] things like that come when concerns
[40:52] would even move to that of a worry I'm
[40:55] glad there's a place that we can go and
[40:57] let off the pressure because we're not
[40:59] promised that pressure wouldn't come to
[41:01] us we're not promised that we wouldn't
[41:03] experience even worries and that there
[41:05] wouldn't be time where anxiousness and
[41:08] things like that can hit us but we are
[41:10] promised that if we will just have our
[41:12] place in him and let him be the place
[41:15] where we let off the pressure then he
[41:17] will help us he will guide us he will
[41:20] direct us through the entire situation
[41:24] so when we look at this in the script
[41:26] scripture I have been referring to these
[41:28] scriptures over and over out of 2
[41:31] Timothy 1 and verse 7 and the Bible said
[41:34] for God hath not given us the spirit of
[41:37] fear but of power and of love and of a
[41:41] sound mind so this is what God has given
[41:45] to us anything that comes outside of
[41:47] that of strength of that of God's love
[41:51] of the love of God or that even that of
[41:53] a sound mind of a healthy mind of things
[41:56] that would be sound and temperate
[41:58] anything that comes outside of that did
[42:00] not come from God do you realize that
[42:03] even Paul had to address the Saints in
[42:05] that day that there were those who were
[42:08] somehow taking the word and making it as
[42:11] though events were happening that the
[42:13] coming of the Lord as far as it was on
[42:15] at that time and Paul said let me just
[42:17] assure you that you be not soon shaken
[42:21] in mind as though this letter has come
[42:23] from us so it's always God God's way if
[42:27] you you can understand this that it's
[42:29] always God's way to always bring us to a
[42:32] settling not a a complacency but God's
[42:35] desire is that we would live in a place
[42:38] of real rest in him that it would not be
[42:41] something that where we're struggling
[42:43] but where there is a real rest and a
[42:45] settl that no matter what is taking
[42:48] place all around us we have a place of
[42:51] settl and rest in him so that's
[42:54] something that the gospel will all
[42:56] always try to do in Romans 8:15 here
[42:59] Paul writes for you have not received
[43:02] the spirit of bondage again to fear but
[43:06] you have received the spirit of adoption
[43:09] or rather that spirit that will bring us
[43:12] to the full maturity of sunship whereby
[43:15] we cry Abba Father in the Mighty God or
[43:18] the mighty conqueror brother BR says he
[43:20] went through the great Veil Yonder of
[43:23] sickness the great veil of sin he he
[43:26] went through the great veil of worry my
[43:29] ain't that something that worry was
[43:31] actually a veil he went through the
[43:33] great veil of fear he tore every one of
[43:36] them down and ascended so high and
[43:40] received the name above every name
[43:41] that's named in the heavens above or in
[43:44] Earth Below or in the world to come and
[43:47] now with that then God has deposited
[43:50] that life back into the believer not the
[43:53] spirit of fear but the spirit of that is
[43:56] of a power God's residing nature that
[43:59] brings a change and a transformation
[44:02] where God's love that is burning within
[44:05] our heart for him to please him and
[44:08] there is a a a a healthiness that comes
[44:11] with his presence living in our life to
[44:14] where it's to bring us back to the place
[44:17] that Adam fell from you know brother B
[44:19] said where Adam Adam and Eve they had a
[44:22] perfect understanding of the love of God
[44:24] they walked with God there was there
[44:26] there was no worry there was no fear
[44:28] there was no sickness none of these
[44:30] things were around them and yet after
[44:34] man fell the prophet said ad man lost
[44:37] all consciousness of what God has put
[44:40] him on Earth to do but through Christ
[44:43] the second Adam we have been restored
[44:47] back to everything that was lost in the
[44:50] fall but the prophet tells us that the
[44:53] things he said that where man even in
[44:55] his his mind it is as it were in his
[44:58] mind the plumbing of his mind has been
[45:01] all plugged up and clogged up that he
[45:04] has forgot and lost all consciousness of
[45:07] this but I'm grateful that you know God
[45:10] has not brought us conscious of it by
[45:12] just giving us a word but God brings us
[45:15] conscious of Who We Are by coming and
[45:18] manifesting his word and making himself
[45:21] known to you and I letting us know of
[45:24] the rights that we have been redeemed
[45:26] back to and this is why the prophet
[45:28] could say God is depending on you as a
[45:31] member of his body to bear fruit of his
[45:35] spirit and he's depending on you so
[45:37] let's open up our channels and let the
[45:40] Holy Spirit come in tonight and energize
[45:43] us and free us from all these fears and
[45:48] doubts that's good now we realize that
[45:52] even as it took place in the beginning
[45:54] of how that God has dealt with Satan
[45:58] even when the Rebellion took place in
[46:00] heaven the way that he dealt with him
[46:03] was he cast him out he didn't ask him to
[46:05] leave he cast him out so the way that
[46:09] God deals with Satan is to cast him out
[46:13] and this is exactly then how that we as
[46:16] Sons and Daughters of God are to deal
[46:19] with Satan there's no deals to be made
[46:22] it's to cast him out and it simply
[46:25] begins even with that of our thoughts
[46:27] and of our mind because remember the
[46:30] fall in the beginning Satan could not
[46:33] have got one place or Avenue with Eve if
[46:37] he hadn't been able to get in her mind
[46:40] and she accept what he was saying is
[46:44] that right and that's the same way the
[46:46] new birth comes to you and I it doesn't
[46:48] bypass the mind but it it must be the
[46:50] mind accepts the word because the word
[46:54] has life but then when it comes down and
[46:56] falls down on the inside that's what
[46:59] brings the transformation because it's
[47:01] the word that has life and so notice in
[47:04] 2 Corinthians
[47:06] 10:5 casting down imaginations and every
[47:11] High thing that exalteth itself against
[47:14] the knowledge of God anything that wants
[47:17] to put itself above God's word what
[47:20] God's thoughts is concerning you cast it
[47:23] down and bringing into captivity
[47:26] every thought to The Obedience of Christ
[47:29] brother BR said in greatest battle or
[47:31] fought how did Grant take Richmond just
[47:34] as he came to it that's how he took rich
[47:36] Richmond and that's how God's soldiers
[47:39] take sin and sickness just as they come
[47:43] to it that's the way they overcome their
[47:46] doubts and fears and things when one
[47:49] Rises they chop him down and say move
[47:53] out of the way right amen now there's
[47:57] things of How It's just to me is
[47:59] absolutely incredible of how that the
[48:01] spirit of God can move down and will
[48:03] bring such an absolute change of a new
[48:06] creation within a life and a heart and
[48:09] then God equips you and I as a son and
[48:12] daughter of God by the new birth and
[48:14] he'll begin to move down into areas of
[48:16] our life that there are things that you
[48:19] and I might still deal with fears and
[48:22] doubts and things and channels that can
[48:24] be in there but the spirit of God will
[48:27] equip us and he'll go right down into
[48:30] areas of our life and when do we go into
[48:32] those areas as we come to it as the
[48:36] spirit of God brings us into those areas
[48:38] and a lot of times as they stick their
[48:40] head up and there's things we come face
[48:42] to face with that's the time to deal
[48:44] with it sometimes there's things we're
[48:46] dealing with that are not present
[48:48] present tense things that's why the
[48:50] prophet over and over I Marvel at how
[48:52] many people were chased by dogs and here
[48:55] there standing 50 years old on the
[48:57] platform and they're dealing with a
[48:59] nervous condition that's beyond normal
[49:03] or where it should be and the spirit of
[49:05] God will call it out and relieve them
[49:07] from that oppression that's been on
[49:09] their life since they was a very young
[49:12] person what is that we deal with it as
[49:15] it comes to light so I'm thankful that
[49:18] that part of it that God has not asked
[49:20] me God has not asked you to go down and
[49:23] try to find everything out in our life
[49:25] we take it as we come to it and that's
[49:27] why it's important we want to be built
[49:29] up in the word of God and when the word
[49:32] says go forward we want to go forward
[49:35] don't pull back that's the time to go
[49:37] forward when when things arise and
[49:39] situations that were brought face to
[49:42] face with and there's things in our life
[49:44] that at that moment it becomes a
[49:46] decision of death and life it becomes a
[49:49] moment to say I am no longer this has
[49:52] surfaced it's time to deal with this
[49:55] area
[49:56] amen now I want to just deal with one of
[49:59] these things here tonight and sometimes
[50:01] we'll be able to go through some more of
[50:03] these things as we come through it but
[50:05] one of the things that we look at that
[50:07] is that can be sometimes the greatest
[50:09] thing or the hardest for anybody is
[50:12] change now I I would go to say that
[50:15] probably most of us in here do not like
[50:18] change in one form or another that's
[50:20] right I mean you know Lord forbid that
[50:23] somebody has your seat you know my
[50:26] goodness or somebody took your parking
[50:28] spot or or or or my goodness you know
[50:31] let's say if You' have come in here and
[50:33] we' have just had things all moved
[50:34] around in here tonight still been in the
[50:36] same Sanctuary but things had been
[50:38] changed around it no doubt would have
[50:40] caught us like well what's going on
[50:42] because there's a part about us that we
[50:45] don't like change is that right there's
[50:48] a trueth now we're all different in that
[50:50] you know there's some people that I mean
[50:52] you know the house could fall down
[50:53] around them it don't matter it don't
[50:56] matter at all then but there are certain
[50:58] things that do matter when certain
[51:00] things would change and you'll know
[51:02] because of the reaction they have
[51:04] regarding certain things and it might be
[51:06] something that you would look at and say
[51:08] what's the big deal I mean what's the
[51:10] big deal I mean there's just the car mat
[51:12] is not in the car I mean or the or the
[51:15] carpet or something's on the carpet or
[51:16] what what's the big deal but you see
[51:18] sometimes we find just even how the
[51:21] peculiarities and how we're made up and
[51:23] how that we would respond to ch and and
[51:26] those different things and you know
[51:27] sometimes change itself can be very
[51:29] scary change is one of those things that
[51:32] sometimes people will look at it and say
[51:34] nope not going to do it at all I know
[51:36] there's even been changes I I've had
[51:38] I've had you know where people have told
[51:40] me oh this change is taking place and
[51:42] you know things are being done different
[51:44] here and my things are a little
[51:45] different at church and this and that my
[51:47] different from how we we're used to it
[51:49] because why change is something that
[51:52] many times it can cause people to worry
[51:54] because we get into our comfort zones
[51:58] and yet the whole of the Christian Life
[52:00] is for us to rest and yet at the same
[52:03] time we are walking daily to be changed
[52:06] in his presence now when we think of
[52:09] this I don't know if you all ever uh had
[52:11] to do there some of you that with within
[52:13] your workplace but I never forget years
[52:15] and years ago there was a h a book that
[52:18] they had us read you know all those
[52:19] things sometimes they drum up to make
[52:21] you feel like they're doing something
[52:22] new it's kind of like what we always
[52:24] called rearranging the chairs on the
[52:26] deck all you've done is rearranged the
[52:28] same old chairs it's oh this is new
[52:30] improved in same chair and different
[52:32] location that's all it is you know a lot
[52:34] of hype to make you think there's change
[52:36] you know but you know when we look at
[52:38] this there was a there was a book I
[52:40] always thought it was kind of you know
[52:41] it's a little short little book they had
[52:43] us read and it was talking about how
[52:45] that change itself is inevitable and
[52:47] it's constant and in every person's life
[52:50] and there's seasons of life and change
[52:53] that takes place and it was about 4
[52:55] little mice and the whole book was I
[52:57] think the book was called who moved the
[52:59] cheese and it was dealing with there was
[53:01] four little mice and in those those four
[53:04] little mice that were in there you had
[53:06] you had two of those mice that were
[53:07] named Sniff and scurry and you had the
[53:10] other two that was named him and hall
[53:12] now you know every time when cheese
[53:14] would certain things and the cheese was
[53:16] representing certain changes in life
[53:18] jobs relationship money and all those
[53:21] other things like that and as they would
[53:23] they were so used to this pile of cheese
[53:25] but that pile of cheese would all of a
[53:27] sudden as they all ate on it it would
[53:28] just dwindle away but you know Sniff and
[53:31] Scurry would go on and they they'd catch
[53:33] something and man we got to go find some
[53:35] other cheese and it would be different
[53:37] you know they wouldn't be able to go out
[53:38] this crack and find it here and and make
[53:40] this turn here and it's out there on
[53:41] that wall and but but they would go and
[53:43] find it but then you had the other two
[53:45] mice called him and Hall and that's what
[53:47] they did they complained because there
[53:49] was no more cheese right there who you
[53:51] know what's happened here where who
[53:53] changed who changed this what what
[53:56] happened with this cheese and you know
[53:58] it's very much so that when we come into
[54:00] change I I can't help but think about it
[54:03] and I wonder I I was just just
[54:05] meditating on this earlier in the week
[54:07] when I was praying I can't help but
[54:09] wonder if the reason that change itself
[54:12] is so difficult for us is because of the
[54:14] fall in the beginning oh yeah because
[54:17] Adam and Eve there everything there was
[54:20] a constant they were in God's presence
[54:22] they had no worry they had no fear they
[54:25] had no sickness it was a constant
[54:28] constant In God's Presence I cannot help
[54:30] but think that that the effect that we
[54:32] have on our life it's a longing for
[54:35] something that is constant something
[54:38] that cannot be changed let me just say
[54:40] this to you this world is going to
[54:42] continue to change it's going to
[54:44] continue to get worse but there is a
[54:46] rock that you can climb upon that no
[54:49] matter how much change takes place
[54:51] politics and everything else but it is a
[54:54] place that will hold steady it will hold
[54:57] constant and you in your own life and
[54:59] walk with God will not be up and down
[55:02] but it'll hold you
[55:04] steady that's what Christ does yes he
[55:07] does you know no doubt what a look and
[55:09] how that it looked in the beginning and
[55:11] think of how that the love of God so
[55:13] governed their lives but now fear
[55:16] entered they did not know what fear was
[55:18] when all of a sudden to think about it
[55:21] even when you consider when they could
[55:23] hear the Roar and the snarl teeth had
[55:25] been changed on the lion teeth had been
[55:28] changed on the tiger why they did not
[55:31] eat meat but everything with the change
[55:34] and the fall now the lion is going after
[55:37] the lamb now the tiger all of the
[55:40] everything had to be changed and to
[55:42] think of how this has come about what a
[55:44] startling thing that it must have been
[55:47] to see that change now I look at it in
[55:50] this way of how that God himself said in
[55:54] Genesis 3:23 the Lord God sent him forth
[55:58] out of the Garden of Eden to teal the
[56:00] ground from whence he was taken and he
[56:02] drove out the man and he placed at the
[56:05] east of the Garden of Eden cherubims and
[56:07] a flaming sword which turned every way
[56:10] to keep the way of the tree of life I'm
[56:13] glad that God has made a way
[56:16] back oh my there was no sickness no sin
[56:20] no worry now notice that within all of
[56:23] this how the prophet says this here and
[56:26] he swore by himself he said there was no
[56:28] sin there was no sickness nothing no
[56:31] worry no nothing no old age no breaking
[56:34] down no heartaches no broken homes no
[56:36] nothing it was just perfect pretty
[56:39] incredible you didn't have to worry
[56:41] about whether you had Tylenol on you
[56:43] didn't have to worry of whether you had
[56:44] Molin in the cabinet or if you've had
[56:46] kidney stones didn't even have to worry
[56:48] whether you had the pain medication in
[56:50] your carry-on
[56:52] bag come on bro so there was no worries
[56:57] at all but now how it enters in because
[57:01] of sin now all of these things come in
[57:05] and we battle against these things time
[57:09] and time again but you know the promise
[57:12] as it lays before us that heaven and
[57:15] Earth shall pass away in Matthew 24:35
[57:18] but my words shall not pass away so the
[57:23] Earth is not going to pass away but the
[57:26] system that has come upon it because of
[57:29] sin will pass away in Hebrews 1 verse 10
[57:33] it says thou Lord in the beginning has
[57:35] laid the foundation of the earth and the
[57:38] heavens are the works of thine hands
[57:40] they Shall Perish but thou remainest and
[57:43] they shall all wax old as death a
[57:46] garment and as a vesture shalt thou fold
[57:49] them up and they shall be changed but
[57:51] Thou Art the same and thy years shall
[57:55] not fail so when the fall took place
[58:00] then we find of how the prophet would
[58:02] describe it that the heavens and the
[58:04] atmospheres contaminated with Devils the
[58:08] atmosphere we walked according to the
[58:11] prince and power of the air before
[58:13] spirits and how that remember even when
[58:15] the Lord Jesus was here and he was
[58:17] tempted that even Satan offered him the
[58:21] kingdoms of this world he was tempted to
[58:25] take it without
[58:28] suffering but in order for knowing that
[58:32] as an obedience to the word he was to
[58:34] fall air to that by staying obedient to
[58:38] the word of God and to think that when
[58:40] we look at it it's the system itself
[58:43] that one day will pass away my the Bible
[58:46] tells us in the Millennium that the
[58:48] knowledge of the Lord shall fill the
[58:50] Earth land sea and sky it will fill it
[58:54] in that time of the Millennium then
[58:56] think about it in that time has the
[58:59] Earth itself the things that we see even
[59:02] taking place where the Earth is is
[59:04] moving in such a way of birth pains to
[59:07] give away to to that Civilization that
[59:10] must come in it's this civilization has
[59:13] to die and to think of how that within
[59:16] everything just like in our life there
[59:19] had to come a change on the inside of
[59:22] our life and when that change has taken
[59:25] place inside of our life then everything
[59:28] else that has been packed into us down
[59:31] through life it begins to be unpacked
[59:34] and the grace of God gives us Grace to
[59:36] overcome oh my I think of how the
[59:39] prophet said in the absolute he said I
[59:41] had to be made like this God made me the
[59:44] way he made me with all these no
[59:46] accounts no good qualities so that he
[59:49] could come and dig it all out of me
[59:53] that's great Hallelujah so to think
[59:55] about how the spirit of God moves into
[59:58] our life and as we read here earlier
[1:00:00] that there is one consonant one one
[1:00:02] thing that's constant in our life and
[1:00:04] should be and one thing that has never
[1:00:06] changed no matter how man has changed
[1:00:09] but God has never
[1:00:12] changed God has never changed now when
[1:00:16] we think of this of how that God himself
[1:00:19] has never changed and how that God came
[1:00:22] down to become one of us the the Bible
[1:00:25] tells us that how that when he gathered
[1:00:27] with the disciples and I want you to be
[1:00:29] I want you to be mindful of this of how
[1:00:31] that God himself Works in our lives with
[1:00:34] when change is about the worst thing
[1:00:37] that we could ever do when change and
[1:00:39] moments of change and transition is to
[1:00:42] be absent but God shows us how it is
[1:00:45] through our families through everything
[1:00:47] that transition itself changing from one
[1:00:51] to another is so vitally important
[1:00:54] that's the time where leadership is
[1:00:56] needed and it's a time that sometimes we
[1:00:59] can stand around and feel the most
[1:01:02] helpless but that's the time we need God
[1:01:05] Amen is that right that's the time we
[1:01:08] need God in those times of transition
[1:01:10] now the disciples were just walking
[1:01:12] around they were confused things did not
[1:01:15] happen as they thought it should happen
[1:01:17] that you know things there had been a
[1:01:18] lot of change come in their life already
[1:01:21] but yet they had not received that
[1:01:23] change on the inside yet and they were
[1:01:26] wondering what was taking place and here
[1:01:28] the Lord Jesus when he raised there on
[1:01:30] that Easter morning he goes down and he
[1:01:32] begins to gather them and begins to
[1:01:34] express to them the Fulfillment of the
[1:01:37] word and admonish them of what they are
[1:01:39] to wait for and he said you shall
[1:01:41] receive power in Acts 18 after that the
[1:01:45] Holy Ghost has come upon you and you
[1:01:47] shall be Witnesses unto me and on and on
[1:01:50] and on throughout all those places he's
[1:01:52] got witnesses right here tonight in
[1:01:54] Sheffield he's got witnesses in Lorraine
[1:01:57] he's got witnesses where you are if
[1:02:00] you're filled with the spirit of God you
[1:02:02] are a witness a trophy of God's grace
[1:02:06] it's a trophy that God keeps his word do
[1:02:09] you realize what the prophet says in the
[1:02:11] message absolute that the people that
[1:02:13] are born of the spirit of God are the
[1:02:16] absolute of the promise that God has
[1:02:18] given not that I'm an absolute or you're
[1:02:21] an absolute but it shows that God's word
[1:02:23] is in infallible and what God spoke that
[1:02:26] he gives the holy ghost that he still is
[1:02:29] a deliverer that God still keeps his
[1:02:31] word and your life is a testimony of
[1:02:35] that word yes it is hallelujah now you
[1:02:38] know one thing that we find when it
[1:02:40] comes to that of change you know the
[1:02:42] prophet tells us of how that lives and
[1:02:45] people will actually pull back and try
[1:02:47] to dodge the issue of the new birth they
[1:02:50] don't want to pull back from that that's
[1:02:52] one area of change and I tell you if
[1:02:54] there's one thing that we need the most
[1:02:57] important change that'll ever happen in
[1:02:58] our life that'll lead us to the next
[1:03:00] change it'll guide us through every
[1:03:03] phase and every change in our life
[1:03:05] changes that we're not even
[1:03:08] expecting sitting right here tonight
[1:03:11] there are lives that have experienced
[1:03:14] change
[1:03:15] unexpectedly
[1:03:17] oh I know things can change in just a
[1:03:21] moment things that we're not even
[1:03:24] anticipating on but neither but when God
[1:03:27] doesn't want us to live in a state of
[1:03:29] fear I'm going to protect this so so
[1:03:32] this doesn't change no we don't walk
[1:03:34] like that as Believers that's called
[1:03:36] worry that'll cause you to go in your
[1:03:38] house lock yourself away and not come
[1:03:40] out for nothing but what we are to do is
[1:03:43] to look to the Lord and say Lord here's
[1:03:46] my hand Lord I want my hand Lord to be
[1:03:49] in your hand to guide me every step of
[1:03:52] the way to know that there's NE nothing
[1:03:54] can take me from this Earth or any loved
[1:03:57] one until Lord that time has come and
[1:04:00] the purpose has been served think of
[1:04:02] what the prophet says he said concerning
[1:04:05] if it's your time to go there's not
[1:04:07] enough doctors surgeons or medicine that
[1:04:10] can keep you here but if it's not your
[1:04:12] time to go there's not a sickness big
[1:04:15] enough there's not a devil or a demon
[1:04:17] that can take you why we are under the
[1:04:20] control of our heavenly father our lives
[1:04:23] are here governed by his grace so we
[1:04:26] look at this the Bible would speak to us
[1:04:29] regarding this of the new birth and I
[1:04:31] you know how that in many instances in
[1:04:34] many things of how that lives or hearts
[1:04:37] and people that will actually pull back
[1:04:39] from that of the new birth then come up
[1:04:41] just to a certain spot even brother BR
[1:04:43] we have references from history of
[1:04:45] Augustine of Hippo where the Holy Ghost
[1:04:47] came upon him but he resisted it and he
[1:04:50] turned away from it why because of the
[1:04:53] change that it would have brought in his
[1:04:55] life now you would think about just
[1:04:57] think about this for a minute who would
[1:04:59] not want to be changed but you see what
[1:05:02] it is is that with many of the change
[1:05:04] there are lives and people still want to
[1:05:07] Reign Over the Holy Ghost but we don't
[1:05:10] Reign Over the Holy Ghost it's where we
[1:05:12] come into submission to him and he takes
[1:05:15] us over it's not us controlling him it's
[1:05:18] not us picking it out like a value meal
[1:05:21] I'll take this and this I put N I want
[1:05:23] that I'll take this and I'll take that
[1:05:25] that is not how the new birth comes and
[1:05:27] the new birth is not about everything
[1:05:29] you can do and you cannot do you're
[1:05:32] looking at the wrong picture the new
[1:05:34] birth is about the person of Jesus
[1:05:37] Christ it's about meeting him in a
[1:05:40] one-on-one Affair and surrendering your
[1:05:42] life to him if you look at everything I
[1:05:45] got to give this up I got to give that
[1:05:47] up you're looking at the wrong thing
[1:05:49] you'll never get there like that it is
[1:05:51] about a union with Jesus Christ
[1:05:54] and if you can realize that and say oh
[1:05:57] God let that Revelation strike my heart
[1:05:59] listen friends if that Revelation is not
[1:06:01] struck your heart just don't let these
[1:06:03] Services Go On by but take that in
[1:06:06] tonight into your heart and say God give
[1:06:09] me the grace to go beyond the worry of
[1:06:14] change oh sometimes I wonder you know to
[1:06:17] get to such a part now I'm just going to
[1:06:19] speak for me when I was a real young
[1:06:21] person and I would be you know in
[1:06:23] meetings oh my the presence of God would
[1:06:25] be moving but then all of a sudden how
[1:06:27] Satan knows just how to come and want to
[1:06:30] water you down what are you going to say
[1:06:32] when you get back to
[1:06:33] school what are you going to do when
[1:06:35] this comes about are you going to quit
[1:06:38] doing this are you going to ringu are
[1:06:41] you going to give up playing this are
[1:06:42] you going to what's going to happen and
[1:06:44] you know the moment that I entertained
[1:06:46] that it was like a
[1:06:48] cooling it would
[1:06:53] just
[1:06:54] I know I probably am not the only
[1:06:57] one you see Satan knows just exactly
[1:06:59] remember remember when brother
[1:07:01] bram's uh uh daughter-in-law she says
[1:07:05] every time I'm praying for the holy
[1:07:06] ghost at about that time say such a a
[1:07:09] feeling comes over me and she said you
[1:07:11] know I I just I get up at that time
[1:07:13] brother BR said that's the time to stay
[1:07:14] on your knees that's not the time to
[1:07:17] pull back just like brother BR says in
[1:07:19] the Holy Ghost series oh my the the
[1:07:22] outpouring of the Holy Spirit taking
[1:07:24] place and there after that third service
[1:07:26] the porn the spirit of God just moving
[1:07:28] in the building and brother brand and
[1:07:30] sister said you know all them people
[1:07:31] were shouting and rejoicing and said I
[1:07:33] was getting ready to you know just and
[1:07:35] she said such a feeling came over me she
[1:07:38] said I I just you know anyone that she
[1:07:40] was rejecting the Holy Ghost she just
[1:07:42] said such a feeling came over me it just
[1:07:44] just like a coldness brother Ram said
[1:07:46] that's the time you should have press
[1:07:48] through and worshiped anyhow hallelujah
[1:07:51] oh my I'll tell you what friends this is
[1:07:53] is a moment and an hour to realize
[1:07:56] feelings we look at oh I don't walk by
[1:07:58] feelings but many times we do we go by
[1:08:01] things of feeling so much and Satan
[1:08:03] knows just how much to bring upon us to
[1:08:06] kind of settle us down because why he
[1:08:09] knows that that part is still about us
[1:08:12] you're not going to strip that part out
[1:08:14] but you've got to learn to live by the
[1:08:17] word of God what the word has said about
[1:08:20] you and bring every thought subject to
[1:08:23] the word
[1:08:26] oh my what about my friends what will my
[1:08:29] friends think what will my family think
[1:08:31] what will I listen when you can just get
[1:08:33] a glimpse of the Lord Jesus of what he
[1:08:36] has done for you the way that he's made
[1:08:38] for you he's not the second person of
[1:08:41] the godhead it is God's love expressed
[1:08:45] to you and me he came down and he paid
[1:08:48] the ultimate price he laid aside his
[1:08:50] Splendor he did not even have a place to
[1:08:53] to lay his head he was willing to be
[1:08:57] mocked beard pulled he was willing to
[1:09:00] stand right there in Pilot's judgment
[1:09:02] Hall and he was willing to take every
[1:09:06] sin that would ever be Hallelujah and
[1:09:10] bear it to the lowest parts of hell
[1:09:12] right I can hear how the prophet says
[1:09:14] there he was in The Garden of Gethsemane
[1:09:16] he said like Samson with the arena was
[1:09:19] all surrounded every demon out of
[1:09:21] Torment every devil that was all
[1:09:23] gathered around in that Arena and here
[1:09:25] they were speaking to him trying to
[1:09:27] pressure to him but here th the father
[1:09:30] speaking to him will you go my son will
[1:09:33] you go and he took that burden for you
[1:09:36] and I he paid oh my the prophet said he
[1:09:39] made the sacrifice once and for all for
[1:09:43] past sin present sin and future
[1:09:47] sinah Hallelujah he took care of it all
[1:09:51] he settled the debt right there
[1:09:56] Hallelujah and sent back the Holy Ghost
[1:10:00] amen sent it back to call you and I to a
[1:10:03] place of full
[1:10:05] surrender oh my the prophet says it like
[1:10:09] this I'm BR to mve down into that quote
[1:10:11] it's out of the message why I've got a
[1:10:13] few there but the one that says the
[1:10:15] people is just afraid of this new birth
[1:10:18] she'll find in a minute the people is
[1:10:20] just afraid of this new birth that's all
[1:10:23] they're afraid to come to it because
[1:10:24] it'll straighten them up it'll make them
[1:10:27] quit playing bingo quit playing these
[1:10:30] slot machines it'll make you quit

[1:10:55] something for you it'll clean you up and
[1:10:57] give you a Salvation that there's
[1:10:59] nothing in the world can explaining away
[1:11:02] from you cuz you know you were there
[1:11:05] when it
[1:11:07] happened only thing I can say is oh how
[1:11:12] I wish I had given my life to him
[1:11:16] sooner Hallelujah 19 years old but oh
[1:11:20] how when he touched my heart as a
[1:11:22] 13-year-old boy 10-year-old boy oh how I
[1:11:25] would have given anything to have went
[1:11:27] on with him at that time I would have
[1:11:30] avoided a lot of
[1:11:33] scars but I'm glad he changed
[1:11:36] me I'm glad he changed
[1:11:39] me like brother BR says I didn't join
[1:11:41] the brandham family I was born into
[1:11:44] it is that right I didn't join it I was
[1:11:47] born into it I I didn't get into it by
[1:11:49] handshake it was a birth I was birthed
[1:11:50] into it is that right you know and this
[1:11:54] is the thing that the Bible tells us in
[1:11:56] Revelations
[1:11:57] 21:8 but the fearful that's worrying and
[1:12:01] unbelieving and abominable and murders
[1:12:03] and Horn mongers and S Sorcerers
[1:12:05] idolators and Liars shall have their
[1:12:07] part in the lake which burneth with fire
[1:12:09] and brimstone which is the second death
[1:12:11] let me just say it like this that those
[1:12:14] that even know what's right but fearful
[1:12:17] to put their hand to
[1:12:19] it that's how important this is but you
[1:12:23] see the way change change his
[1:12:25] heart God begins to deal with a heart in
[1:12:28] a life and he does not God does not draw
[1:12:31] Us by threatening us that's not how he
[1:12:35] works the love of God moves down to draw
[1:12:38] and to woo us if you look back in
[1:12:41] Genesis 1 that's exactly how the spirit
[1:12:43] of God brings you and I to birth God
[1:12:46] speaks his word and the spirit of God
[1:12:49] comes out across the Earth and it begins
[1:12:51] to coup over that Earth making love to
[1:12:54] it and what's he doing he's bringing
[1:12:57] forth the conditions that's needed where
[1:13:00] that Darkness will be driven away so
[1:13:03] that the light itself can penetrate down
[1:13:05] there to that
[1:13:07] seed I'm sure that you feel the same way
[1:13:10] I do
[1:13:11] Lord I don't want to be held back from
[1:13:14] anything that you have for me let me
[1:13:17] just tell you something God's already
[1:13:19] exhibited all of his grace he's
[1:13:21] exhibited his Mercy all everything he
[1:13:23] thinks about you God has made it known
[1:13:27] oh it's a time to take hold of that
[1:13:29] promise and say Lord you are all that I
[1:13:32] need to guide me into this complete
[1:13:35] change you know the beautiful thing
[1:13:37] about it is is that when as as as we
[1:13:39] come into him it changes
[1:13:42] us sometimes you know it where where the
[1:13:45] change takes place is down on the inside
[1:13:48] our desires are changed the nature is
[1:13:52] changed and and then from that little
[1:13:54] deposit of his Spirit it begins to
[1:13:57] change us from Glory unto Glory Samuel
[1:14:02] what are you saying that you're not born
[1:14:04] fully
[1:14:05] matured we're not born fully matured but
[1:14:09] we receive the spirit of adoption that
[1:14:13] produces or leads to full
[1:14:17] sunship is that right that's that those
[1:14:20] are th that that's the scripture so we
[1:14:22] find that that that takes place in our
[1:14:24] life and to think about it even after
[1:14:26] the spirit of God will move down into
[1:14:28] the depths of our life as we are being
[1:14:30] changed from Glory unto Glory there are
[1:14:33] things that sometimes it's just
[1:14:36] hard right my I'm I guess I'm the only
[1:14:40] one in here there's some things that's
[1:14:42] just hard some things we'll look at and
[1:14:44] we'll think uh you know I Lord I'm not
[1:14:47] disagreeing but I don't know about right
[1:14:49] now and God will bring it out again
[1:14:51] sometimes it comes through tests comes
[1:14:52] through Tri comes to because listen
[1:14:54] obedience is not
[1:14:58] easy brother samel I want scripture glad
[1:15:01] you asked let me just call it to mind
[1:15:04] Hebrews 5:7 he was heard with strong
[1:15:06] tears and crying in that he
[1:15:09] feared he learned obedience by the
[1:15:12] things he
[1:15:14] suffered there listen we sat here we
[1:15:17] agree with the word but then when tests
[1:15:19] and Trials come where we have to take
[1:15:22] the word and as author
[1:15:23] of a son and daughter of God and Reign
[1:15:25] Over Our Own
[1:15:28] will reign over our own
[1:15:32] life it takes the grace of God it's not
[1:15:36] something that just all of a sudden
[1:15:37] remember character is not a gift that's
[1:15:40] right it's a victory the Holy Ghost is
[1:15:43] the gift of God the character is not a
[1:15:45] gift that's right character is a victory
[1:15:49] that has been
[1:15:52] won now I want you to think of this even
[1:15:55] when it comes to moments and times when
[1:15:57] change is taking place as we said it can
[1:16:00] be very difficult we've seen it even
[1:16:02] when the Lord Jesus would stand there
[1:16:03] before the Pharisees remember they
[1:16:06] thought they remember what they thought
[1:16:07] concerning the Lord Jesus they thought
[1:16:09] he was coming to do away or to take away
[1:16:12] from the law they they they looked at it
[1:16:15] what this man is doing he's
[1:16:17] blaspheming they thought the same thing
[1:16:19] about Paul anytime there is an
[1:16:22] advancement in the word of God it brings
[1:16:26] worrying oh yes that's why the prophet
[1:16:29] could say in the message the birth pains
[1:16:31] he could say concerning worrying anytime
[1:16:34] there's a transformation from the old to
[1:16:36] the new where the life is at that's what
[1:16:39] was worrying the people and it worries
[1:16:41] them yet
[1:16:42] today why when even as the word even the
[1:16:46] message that we are following in this
[1:16:48] hour we have not it's not an encampment
[1:16:51] that we build an encampment and there's
[1:16:53] no moving no no everything we believe we
[1:16:57] must have a comma after it we must say
[1:17:00] we believe this and all that God will
[1:17:04] continue to reveal as a matter of fact I
[1:17:07] just read and posted some of these
[1:17:09] things today of how that the prophet
[1:17:11] said a prophet is the word he is a
[1:17:15] Divine interpreter of the word and his
[1:17:19] interpretation of the word must not be
[1:17:22] mingled
[1:17:23] with that's so
[1:17:25] good oh I don't know about this you know
[1:17:28] I think you know brother random was you
[1:17:29] know I didn't have much understanding I
[1:17:31] I'm going to go to have to go out here
[1:17:34] nope nope we're not mingling with the
[1:17:37] interpretation we have receed the
[1:17:39] perfect interpretation by Divine
[1:17:43] Vindication doesn't matter who it is
[1:17:45] what their name is when you depart from
[1:17:47] the word I'm staying with this word no
[1:17:51] alterations we're staying with the word
[1:17:54] that God has revealed and Vindicated in
[1:17:57] this hour it is the sure ticket out of
[1:18:00] here because it is God's word that has
[1:18:03] been delivered and the spirit of God
[1:18:05] brings it into the lives of the
[1:18:08] people but it gets worrisome I mean you
[1:18:10] can even when you sometimes you know you
[1:18:12] can preach on Grace and sometimes you
[1:18:14] can become worrisome like oh oh oh no
[1:18:18] the the you know the the people are
[1:18:19] going to become loose hey look I I
[1:18:20] didn't put that in the scripture God put
[1:18:23] that in there and let me just tell you
[1:18:25] something if there's already something
[1:18:27] in the heart that's not right it'll find
[1:18:29] a way to do it anyhow but let me just
[1:18:31] tell you right now this guy right here
[1:18:33] you're never going to perfect him we're
[1:18:36] going to need the grace of God to the
[1:18:37] very last Nano second before we're
[1:18:41] changed we we need the grace of God
[1:18:44] daily in our life and we need that Grace
[1:18:47] to lead us so that we can reflect in our
[1:18:49] own life and see our shortcomings and
[1:18:52] die
[1:18:57] daily oh my many things remember even
[1:19:01] when Peter said there were things that
[1:19:02] was hard Paul has said some things that
[1:19:05] hard to be UND misund to be
[1:19:07] understood that right it was hard for
[1:19:10] him it was hard did Peter understand it
[1:19:12] all he did not but Peter understood what
[1:19:14] was most important Paul is the messenger
[1:19:17] of the age and Paul is the Apostle to
[1:19:20] the Gentiles just as much as Peter could
[1:19:23] recognize he was the Apostle to the
[1:19:26] Jews he didn't understand everything
[1:19:28] remember Peter got rebuked he went down
[1:19:31] there you know and you know he he got a
[1:19:33] taste of ribs and you know bacon and man
[1:19:35] that was good I mean what what he had
[1:19:36] been missing all them years but all of a
[1:19:38] sudden some brothers came over the hill
[1:19:40] Oh Lord have mercy he said quickly get
[1:19:43] this barbecue sauce away from me get
[1:19:46] this away from me you know he he want to
[1:19:48] distance himself you know why he wasn't
[1:19:51] settled
[1:19:53] but Paul was settled and the Bible says
[1:19:56] Paul withstood him to his
[1:19:59] face why because that in your actions
[1:20:04] can upset the rest of the Believers oh
[1:20:07] my changes hard isn't it sure it's hard
[1:20:11] change is hard but notice this there are
[1:20:13] certain changes let me try to bring this
[1:20:15] down into here there are changes in life
[1:20:18] and Seasons you know that we come into
[1:20:20] and I'm thankful for God's grace in our
[1:20:23] lives that he will lead us through these
[1:20:25] seasons and these times in our life
[1:20:27] there's seasons and changes that we
[1:20:29] don't have a choice to bypass but God's
[1:20:32] grace is present to see us through
[1:20:34] notice in the message indictment the
[1:20:36] brother Ram says the human being has two
[1:20:39] changes of Life they have the change
[1:20:42] from a boy to a man from a girl to a
[1:20:45] woman about 16 17 years old they get a
[1:20:47] bunch of just fly by nights and if you
[1:20:50] can just suffer with them during that
[1:20:52] age
[1:20:53] probably put it in parenthesis and not
[1:20:55] kill them if you can suffer with them
[1:20:59] why what's causing this they're going
[1:21:01] through a change right they're going
[1:21:04] through a
[1:21:07] change the sad part about it is is
[1:21:10] sometimes the adults are not settled
[1:21:12] enough to help them through the
[1:21:15] change yes sir friends I can't think of
[1:21:17] no better no better way to be settled
[1:21:19] than to be in Christ amen because I'll
[1:21:22] be the first to tell you even when it
[1:21:24] come to my own boys I didn't have all
[1:21:26] the answers oh my I remember when I
[1:21:29] first started pastoring I remember when
[1:21:30] I first got married I thought man I had
[1:21:32] to have all the answers I created so
[1:21:35] much undue stress on myself until I
[1:21:38] realized I don't have to have all the
[1:21:39] answers I just got to know him who is
[1:21:42] the answer stay in contact with him he
[1:21:45] will give me the answer just as I have
[1:21:47] need of it he'll be able to direct me
[1:21:49] and guide me brother Samuel do you worry
[1:21:51] about it I don't worry about it there's
[1:21:53] things yes that I'll pray in being
[1:21:55] concerned and looking to God In Prayer
[1:21:58] but you know what God has never failed
[1:22:01] to give the leadership that's
[1:22:04] needed so look at this if you can suffer
[1:22:07] with them during that age now remember
[1:22:09] brother Ram talks about that even with
[1:22:10] regard regard to Becky and everything
[1:22:12] else and brother Ram now you notice even
[1:22:14] in this part right here with Becky you
[1:22:16] know brother George would go into this
[1:22:18] brother Bram talks about it but even
[1:22:20] brother George would go into this of how
[1:22:22] that brother Bram when he went down the
[1:22:24] street and he asked he asked Where's
[1:22:26] Becky at well she's down at the
[1:22:27] neighbor's house down there this when
[1:22:28] they lived in Tucson she's down there
[1:22:30] well brother Bram wanted to go to dinner
[1:22:32] so here here is here is you know brother
[1:22:34] Bram Sister Sister M you know and Joseph
[1:22:36] and and Sarah there in the car and so he
[1:22:39] pulls up and he goes he's walking up to
[1:22:40] the door and as he's walking up to the
[1:22:42] door he's hearing rock and roll
[1:22:45] music
[1:22:47] wow now to me these are
[1:22:51] things when I when I hear cuz I can read
[1:22:54] it I can read it but some of these
[1:22:55] details I wouldn't know if brother
[1:22:57] George hadn't mentioned it but brother
[1:23:00] Brandon when he went up to the door he
[1:23:01] just simply knocked on the door they
[1:23:02] came to it and he said it's time to go
[1:23:05] it's time for us to
[1:23:07] eat he didn't not make a scene about it
[1:23:10] he didn't even make a scene in the car
[1:23:13] nor over
[1:23:16] dinner it's quiet in here now ain't
[1:23:21] it
[1:23:24] remember what brother Bram said
[1:23:25] concerning that he did talk to her later
[1:23:28] but brother Bram said he felt like
[1:23:30] taking his belt
[1:23:31] out but he realized that'll not do any
[1:23:36] good you've got to think 18-year-old
[1:23:39] thoughts and you know why brother B
[1:23:41] reminded sister mey you with is a moment
[1:23:44] if she was dying the next moment we've
[1:23:46] got a committer to the
[1:23:49] Lord I tell you to me I'm thankful to
[1:23:52] God for for these examples that are
[1:23:54] included in here is that right I mean
[1:23:57] think about it you think the enemy
[1:23:58] didn't try to attack attack brother
[1:24:00] Ram's mind I I I don't know but you
[1:24:01] think it didn't because I know he's
[1:24:03] human just like us you think he didn't
[1:24:05] try to attack his mind you the prophet
[1:24:07] of God and look at your
[1:24:09] daughter look at you look at this you
[1:24:13] know sometimes the sad part about it is
[1:24:15] is when parents will correct their
[1:24:17] children out of
[1:24:19] embarrassment instead of out of the
[1:24:22] heart in
[1:24:24] mind that's so good my that's that
[1:24:29] that's that's a family service thing
[1:24:31] notice he said that I've got a daughter
[1:24:33] about that age right now Rebecca pray
[1:24:35] for Billy oh every one of us we come
[1:24:38] through that little frantic age and we
[1:24:40] must suffer with them realizing it's
[1:24:43] something that they have to go
[1:24:46] through now he says now Edith remember
[1:24:48] he's talking about sister Edith right he
[1:24:50] said little Edith remember she was with
[1:24:52] that infertile paralysis 7 years she's
[1:24:55] changing of seven years every seven
[1:24:57] years your life changes so the 7even
[1:25:00] time 7 you see it makes it kind of hard
[1:25:03] and that's a complete change she was
[1:25:04] going to be 49 it bothers the women men
[1:25:07] usually get kind of funny and carrying
[1:25:09] on during that time and sometimes leave
[1:25:12] their wives but women are unfertile
[1:25:14] after that and we can we go through all
[1:25:16] of that and we must remember that it's
[1:25:18] things we must bear with one another and
[1:25:22] understand understand those
[1:25:25] things
[1:25:28] change remember Rockefeller didn't want
[1:25:30] to do with he didn't want to deal with
[1:25:31] that change with his
[1:25:33] wife he just left yes he did and here's
[1:25:36] the miracle understanding don't even
[1:25:38] mean you understand it just means you
[1:25:40] listen and say okay right okay okay like
[1:25:46] another dish of ice cream I mean not for
[1:25:47] my wife you like another okay it doesn't
[1:25:50] mean that I you know because sometimes
[1:25:52] as as men we've got to have everything
[1:25:54] figured out tell me all your problems
[1:25:56] I'll solve them
[1:26:00] all don't work like
[1:26:04] that oh my notice how the prophet in
[1:26:07] this time of of total Deliverance I've
[1:26:10] read this quote to you many times
[1:26:11] brother R talking about sister Neville
[1:26:14] Brandon go down in that quote of total
[1:26:15] Deliverance where he says may your
[1:26:16] spirit Lord may your spirit Lord be
[1:26:18] great upon her he's praying for sister
[1:26:20] Neville knowing that all women are
[1:26:22] ordained to walk down through this
[1:26:24] valley of darkness of this age but we
[1:26:27] pray that you'll be with her bless those
[1:26:29] little children she'll be nervous now
[1:26:32] and fretful but may the Holy Ghost be at
[1:26:34] the door of Mercy at all times for that
[1:26:37] family questions and answers
[1:26:40] 1964 he said a woman here might be in
[1:26:42] the menopause time that's when
[1:26:44] everything is wrong with
[1:26:45] her I don't know if I should read this
[1:26:47] next part and there's nothing wrong with
[1:26:50] her yet everything's wrong with her and
[1:26:52] she's not just putting on she really
[1:26:54] feels that it's just as real any person
[1:26:58] that's nervous is that way and don't
[1:27:01] never disagree
[1:27:04] right what counsel that's right you say
[1:27:09] Brother Sam you're talking about changes
[1:27:10] of Life remember the Lord Jesus did not
[1:27:14] abandon his disciples in the transition
[1:27:17] of
[1:27:18] change changing from the old to the new
[1:27:22] he does not abandon when it comes time
[1:27:24] for his children to move on in the word
[1:27:27] he's right there he's the one that
[1:27:30] stabilizes us he's the one that when
[1:27:33] questions rise remember when Jack Cole
[1:27:35] Jack Cole was sitting on the platform
[1:27:37] heard about brother R and here he is
[1:27:38] sitting there and Jack Cole had a lot of
[1:27:40] questions in his heart but Jack Cole
[1:27:43] seemed the operation of the supernatural
[1:27:46] he saw a Living God on display and even
[1:27:49] as the prophet would walk on by him and
[1:27:51] speak to him personally it changed him
[1:27:54] it changed what he was thinking it
[1:27:56] changed how Jack Cole was seeing things
[1:27:59] think of how many that even think of how
[1:28:01] when this message come listen friends
[1:28:04] this message when it come think when
[1:28:06] brother Bram stands there and he
[1:28:07] preaches very key messages on return and
[1:28:11] Jubilee in streetport 1962 then he turns
[1:28:15] around the next night the way back and
[1:28:17] he's preaching that and a and a brother
[1:28:19] you hear the brother come up to the
[1:28:20] microphone after returning Jubilee oh
[1:28:23] we've got to get back to how it was
[1:28:25] we've got to get back he's referring to
[1:28:27] Zeus stre they know they had fallen from
[1:28:30] somewhere and here God is present there
[1:28:34] in the ministry and the Fulfillment of
[1:28:36] his word to lead his children yes from
[1:28:41] that of isua Street that's right into
[1:28:43] the bride age that's right he doesn't
[1:28:46] ask us to do it on our own Hallelujah
[1:28:51] because isus is the baptism of the Holy
[1:28:54] Ghost coming upon that the baptism of
[1:28:57] the spirit but remember we are to
[1:28:59] receive the
[1:29:01] adoption which is the fullness of Christ
[1:29:05] tabernacling in a bride body where there
[1:29:08] is a Mount
[1:29:10] Transfiguration
[1:29:13] experience glory be to God that's what
[1:29:15] this message is about this is why that
[1:29:18] even through the times when the prophet
[1:29:20] could say burn that old Li with fire you
[1:29:23] can't bring he said that Pentecostalism
[1:29:25] over in here you've got to burn it with
[1:29:27] fire brother brandom was not against
[1:29:28] emotion he was not against gift he was
[1:29:31] not against shouting but he was letting
[1:29:33] the people know you can have all of that
[1:29:36] and miss the real
[1:29:38] thing and if you've got the real thing
[1:29:41] you might shout and you might not you
[1:29:44] might speak with tongues and you might
[1:29:47] not but there's one thing you will you
[1:29:50] will live a life that's worthy of the
[1:29:53] Gospel you will live a life let me tell
[1:29:55] you something you might never preach
[1:29:58] might never sing you may not even have
[1:30:00] been able to say I don't even know if
[1:30:02] I've been able to lay my hands on
[1:30:03] somebody and pray and theyd be healed
[1:30:05] but you have one of the greatest
[1:30:07] realities and that is to be able to obey
[1:30:11] the word of God from a heart on the
[1:30:13] inside that says amen
[1:30:17] Lord remember God's got people in the
[1:30:19] body for every little thing yeah
[1:30:22] amen he don't want us all we don't need
[1:30:24] to all do the same thing this is why I
[1:30:27] think it was uh um I think it was Sister
[1:30:29] Florence sharan brother BR I prayed and
[1:30:31] fasted so much and I tried to cast out
[1:30:33] Devils brother BR said that wasn't your
[1:30:35] position sister your position is to pray
[1:30:37] and fast God's got somebody else to cast
[1:30:39] them
[1:30:42] out Lord how did we get
[1:30:46] here and you husbands to your wife let's
[1:30:48] continue that next part when they're in
[1:30:50] that time of life is if she ever was
[1:30:52] your sweetheart let her be right then
[1:30:54] cuz she needs you now when I'm reading
[1:30:56] this I want you to think of the Lord
[1:30:58] Jesus concerning your life and my life
[1:31:02] when there's seasons of change that we
[1:31:04] are going through that even when we can
[1:31:08] say I don't know about this Lord I don't
[1:31:11] know about this but he's right there
[1:31:14] with us because he's the one that begins
[1:31:17] to open us to change he's the one that
[1:31:21] begins to move on our hearts to accept
[1:31:24] remember before elzar ever got to the
[1:31:27] well the angel of the Lord beat the
[1:31:29] servant there a half hour and dealt with
[1:31:31] Rebecca's heart and said go get some
[1:31:35] water it's God dealing on both ends she
[1:31:39] really needs your help she needs
[1:31:41] somebody to help her and understand her
[1:31:42] talk to her take her up in your arms
[1:31:45] like she was your sweetheart she should
[1:31:46] be understand her because she's going
[1:31:48] through a time that her entire makeup is
[1:31:51] changing
[1:31:52] and you must be good to her at that time
[1:31:55] I think of how brother Brandon would
[1:31:56] would say it I I've got it here but I
[1:31:58] this time I don't have time to read it
[1:32:00] but how brother Brandon would speak of
[1:32:03] it about how that many of the sisters he
[1:32:06] said look he said when you're going
[1:32:07] through that time he said don't take
[1:32:08] them hormone shots he said that's the
[1:32:11] thing that causes cancer and he said I
[1:32:14] know he said because I've caught it in
[1:32:15] the prayer lines so I
[1:32:19] thought here you know one evening and I
[1:32:22] said I'm just going to look that up
[1:32:24] because I've always seen that I've seen
[1:32:27] everything where the Prophet has said
[1:32:28] you'll see the things they're finding
[1:32:29] out sure enough American Cancer Society
[1:32:32] has all of this listed of those things
[1:32:36] but I love how the prophet just you know
[1:32:37] he makes it so clear he said just always
[1:32:40] remember he's right there to take your
[1:32:42] hand at that
[1:32:44] time lot of things of uncertainty and
[1:32:47] change and things that can come around
[1:32:50] within our life but those those shadows
[1:32:52] and darkness and things that can come
[1:32:54] about our lives he's standing right
[1:32:55] there watching us and nothing can harm
[1:32:58] us let's
[1:33:00] stand I think about this time that here
[1:33:04] we
[1:33:05] are all of them Through the Ages have
[1:33:08] looked for this the hour that you and I
[1:33:10] are living in they've waited on this
[1:33:13] moment and we know we're living in a
[1:33:19] time or at any moment you can look
[1:33:22] around and our loved ones are going to
[1:33:25] be appearing before
[1:33:28] us the move is on there's a
[1:33:32] stirring in our
[1:33:35] hearts it's God is present right now
[1:33:39] just as he was to lead them to the day
[1:33:43] of Pentecost that same God is here
[1:33:46] present in a people to lead us into a
[1:33:51] body ch
[1:33:52] change these promises have laid down
[1:33:55] Through the Ages but to think how that a
[1:33:58] prophet would stand there and tell us to
[1:34:01] me to be so clear and honest with us and
[1:34:03] say I was always afraid of dying before
[1:34:06] I had that vision of the other side he
[1:34:08] said not not afraid of that I'd be lost
[1:34:11] I was't afraid of that he said I wasn't
[1:34:13] afraid that I'd be lost he said but what
[1:34:15] it is I didn't want to be a spirit I
[1:34:17] didn't want to just be floating around
[1:34:20] and but how the Lord came to him that
[1:34:25] morning and took him beyond the curtain
[1:34:28] of
[1:34:29] time and let him see it's not
[1:34:33] Spirits they're
[1:34:35] bodies they're in a
[1:34:39] body just as like you and I can look
[1:34:41] invisible and see one another that's how
[1:34:44] they are over
[1:34:46] there they've already entered into their
[1:34:49] Theo that's right and and you know what
[1:34:52] it wasn't a long
[1:34:53] journey it was just one
[1:34:56] step one moment that Dimension as the
[1:35:00] prophet would say it he said it's just a
[1:35:01] higher sense he said as he moves down he
[1:35:04] says you just move into that higher
[1:35:06] sense into that other realm it's right
[1:35:07] here with us
[1:35:09] already so it's not something that's far
[1:35:12] off it's right here and the presence of
[1:35:16] God has come to lead us in
[1:35:19] change now
[1:35:22] I'd say tonight that's the greatest
[1:35:24] thing we can make preparation for if you
[1:35:27] haven't is to let him come tonight and
[1:35:30] change your life you know even right now
[1:35:34] with what maybe you're dealing with or
[1:35:36] looking
[1:35:38] at he'll come right into your situation
[1:35:41] and Lead You yes he will through the
[1:35:44] change that's before you will yes sir
[1:35:48] I'm sure every one of us there's things
[1:35:49] maybe you've experienced experience
[1:35:52] right now maybe things that we'll
[1:35:53] experience in coming years coming our
[1:35:55] coming days that's not
[1:35:59] planned but the presence of God will
[1:36:01] help us God will give us Grace and lead
[1:36:05] us in that moment of
[1:36:07] change that's who it's his grace pulling
[1:36:10] upon us that brought us to a place of
[1:36:14] surrender for the new birth it's his
[1:36:18] grace it's where he became more
[1:36:23] real he became more than what anybody
[1:36:26] else could say friends
[1:36:29] family he became more than
[1:36:35] anything don't you love
[1:36:37] him amen worrying yeah well there'll be
[1:36:41] moments of
[1:36:42] concern but anytime you're standing in
[1:36:45] the face of change you show up on your
[1:36:48] job and there's things they say we're
[1:36:50] going to alter this
[1:36:53] this is going to be
[1:36:55] changed we really don't like change but
[1:36:59] no matter what change it is just know
[1:37:02] he's Mindful and just like those quotes
[1:37:04] we read about the time of change of life
[1:37:07] and brother Bram talks about a husband
[1:37:09] coming up close to his
[1:37:11] wife and taking her by the hand talking
[1:37:14] to her just listening to listening to
[1:37:18] her to understand her not not trying NE
[1:37:21] to make sense of
[1:37:23] everything but to think if
[1:37:25] if where we would be brought to that
[1:37:28] place and guided as husbands how much
[1:37:30] more our heavenly father am when there's
[1:37:34] times of transition and change in our
[1:37:37] life he's not far he said I'd never
[1:37:40] leave you nor forsake you he's a friend
[1:37:44] that sticketh closer than a
[1:37:47] brother let's just go to him in prayer
[1:37:50] Heavenly Father
[1:37:54] father Lord it takes you
[1:37:57] to bring all the peie together and help
[1:38:00] us to see it Lord for our own
[1:38:04] lives Lord you know where each of us are
[1:38:06] at you know where every heart you know
[1:38:08] every
[1:38:09] need and father no matter where we might
[1:38:12] be we need you
[1:38:14] Lord Lord for lives and hearts Lord that
[1:38:17] have never known you in that of the
[1:38:19] power of the Resurrection that a real
[1:38:21] change Lord and maybe that fear Lord
[1:38:24] that has so gripped their hearts Lord
[1:38:26] they would be moved in a place but then
[1:38:28] fear would grip their hearts Satan would
[1:38:31] bring up all their failures
[1:38:33] and Lord he would bring up things in
[1:38:36] their mind to want to just cause them
[1:38:39] Lord to cool down I pray Heavenly Father
[1:38:43] may you just move in Lord God move in
[1:38:47] Lord God I pray in a just in a more real
[1:38:50] and more precious way Lord those that
[1:38:52] are not only here but in the invisible
[1:38:54] audience those that Lord would even
[1:38:56] archive it later Lord God that father
[1:38:59] May Lord God it just resonate in their
[1:39:02] hearts it's not our efforts it's not our
[1:39:07] trying it's Lord God where you become
[1:39:10] the focus and the object of all
[1:39:13] adoration
[1:39:15] Lord oh Grant it Lord may you move Lord
[1:39:18] for every need Lord now father as you
[1:39:22] lead us Lord along this
[1:39:24] journey I'm thankful Lord to know that
[1:39:27] just as we come into these moments Lord
[1:39:29] as your Prophet would describe these
[1:39:32] changes in our life he would describe
[1:39:34] that change of life that would take
[1:39:36] place Lord Lord God with a woman and I
[1:39:39] find that Lord even in the message how
[1:39:41] the prophet would call out a man there
[1:39:43] would be a man that was standing on the
[1:39:44] platform and even Lord at a certain time
[1:39:47] in his life Lord where there were things
[1:39:50] that he was going going through at that
[1:39:52] time but Lord God you would make it
[1:39:54] known and your grace would come
[1:39:57] down and to lift that Gloom that would
[1:40:01] be around that life
[1:40:02] Lord now father we have to walk through
[1:40:06] these places some of the places Lord and
[1:40:08] change that we go
[1:40:11] through we don't have a choice
[1:40:14] Lord but Lord I'm thankful that the Holy
[1:40:18] Ghost is at the door of Mercy at all
[1:40:20] times
