don't just happen in church that happens at home even when there's something that's sad or something will strike my heart it don't even have to be a man of piano or drums going no no it's when I get to thinking about him a man thinking about what what he is and what he's done in my life and the goodness of God oh my I just carried away in that amen because that's the whole of our our Christian Life and I'll tell you what if you've never experienced that tonight to know that it's a it's a bubble in something that'll bubble up inside of you then tonight I tell you make preparation to say God I want to visit that Fountain and I want a real cleansing tonight that there will be a bubbling up I want that real joy that real Joy of a Christian walk and maybe tonight is just say Lord I need to restore the joy of thy salvation in my life and I'm grateful that God is more than able and more than enough don't you love him tonight my my mind it's so good so good to be in the house of the Lord and amen and we're just so thankful I want to just say once again just so thankful to see everything that's also being done uh outside and taken care of and and I know sometimes it may be from service to service right and we look at it out there right now it might look in somewhat the same to you if you haven't been able to look at it for a while but I know that uh brother Richie has been here what they call building it out so that we can put Brother Rich you'll be able to put that white soft and I think brother Richards I've been here a little bit as well and so we just so appreciate amen everything that is that is being done and God providing for us to be able to do it because I'll tell you the other night when I when I walked out of here the other night after after a meeting and I was standing out there and it was pouring the rain boy it felt good not to have rain coming down on my head it was cold but I was thankful not to have have that rain so I'll tell you I'm grateful to God for that amen and thank God for his grace and how he's provided for us tonight it's just good to be here isn't it it's good to be in the house of the Lord and amen if we could let's just um prepare our hearts here I know we're ready we're ready for the word of the Lord and we just want to say thank you to the musicians and we just want to approach the word tonight and as we prepare to approach the word tonight I know there's many different needs that we would have Upon Our Hearts and God's mindful of every need you know sometimes you might look at it and think that the text or what's being read that Lord I don't know how that's going to meet my need but just be mindful of this that you're the one who controls the gift it's not me it's God who controls you control it you pull God right down your direction and I believe we've got needs tonight and that's what we have a desire Amen to hear from god so let's just let's just look to him in a word of prayer before we read the word Heavenly Father how precious Lord and wonderful it is oh God for Brethren to dwell together in unity Lord as you would be describing it Lord of that precious ointment Lord that was poured out upon Aaron Lord and he would run down lord to the very Lord edges of His Garment o God clear to the feet clear to the ground Lord father we just Lord our so thankful God for your mercy Lord and how that you have directed Our Lives Lord guiding us Lord and bringing us to this place Lord and father we just ask that you'll just take control in the further part of the service tonight Lord It's a desire that Lord we would have and that's to see you and just to be closer to you Lord we just Lord commit ourselves to you Lord knowing that we're insufficient Lord for the task we're insufficient Lord but father you to our Lord our worthiness Lord and we ask that you would come Lord and just anoint us together as speaker in here and may you have your way here tonight Lord May every single need Lord be met every heart be settled Lord oh God every life Lord just being changed in lives being further changed Lord we just Lord look to you now and just all that you would sweep Among Us Lord that same quickening power Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen let's look here one verse of scripture tonight and I want to read out of job 29. in verse 14. and in this chapter here job is referring to it's a testimony job's reflecting back on his walk and life previous to that of the test and the trial that he is in and there's a reflection of what job is reflecting on and he has a testimony how many of you know job had a testimony and he had a job had a clear conscience before God job was standing there and he knew there's nothing that God has asked me to do that I haven't done so he could have a clear conscience but he still didn't know what was taking place but I'm grateful that God allowed and gave all of this for you and I because sometimes you and I also hold that we don't understand sometimes exactly we don't know what's taking place sometimes and no matter you know we we hear how many times we hear we hear trials preached on we hear tests preach on and we're amen that's right and then all of a sudden here we find ourselves right in the trial or testing what's happening and it's a lot of times it's not just what's happening but we we almost have a oh no oh no I just was enjoying you know the little reprieve at the resort of no testings you know and now here we are back back in it but you know we we understand I believe that God brings us as Believers to realize that there is there's nothing that happens by chance and even with things what we would look at as little bumps in the road or this or that God God has permitted all those things and if within it all we can just look to him and say God whatever it is that you're Desiring to bring out of my life Lord let me just submit to you that it can come forth amen job 29 verse 14 I put on righteousness so job if he's put on the word and it clothed me I like that and it clothed me it fit me perfectly I mean just the word of the Lord how it it just fit me like a glove it just fit perfectly my judgment was as a robe and a diadem may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I think about try walk from the platform here last Thursday is just begin to drop and begin to put many of these some of the first Parts here down to it but I would think about where we're living in a time right now in the Fulfillment of scripture and we can see that even in Matthew 17 when the Lord Jesus has taken the witnesses there up to mount Transfiguration and he is transfigured before them and there appears Moses and Elijah and we recognize there's many things that the prophet would take under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit to show us that that was not just a historical event but that was prophetic it was God giving a direction of the order that was going to come in the New Kingdom it was also God letting be known with here Moses and Elijah that there would be a last day Ministry with the spirit of Elijah upon it this this word itself would all together it would tie up the very Mysteries of the scripture that have laid here and just been scattered throughout the time and many have probed down but it would be necessary in this hour because through that word coming together and then being received into a people that are ordained in this hour to receive the word of God and that is where God has placed Us in the sea that through that word working in our life you know the working of the holy spirit in our life it speaks then we'll come to this place that the working of the Dynamics in our lives the Bride of Jesus Christ will literally draw them from the grave it's going to bring on the Rapture and so we find here when Moses and Elijah those that's went on and then those that's also will be caught up so here we are standing in this moment and a garment here in time of adoption and this is where God has brought us to in this hour as the Church of the Living God and I think of it when we look at that of the adoption and we think of the Garment and I want to just think of it in terms of even when the prodigal son had come home here he was he was greeted by his father his father saw him coming and went to greet him and he he kissed him he welcomed him and then he had he had them of the servants to go get the best robe that was in the house and and clothe him with the best robe now the best robe was the father's robe himself and to realize that all of that was a story of redemption that it would be of the same Holy Spirit the same life of God that would be be come upon us as prodigals of God those of us the lives that were away from God lives that he came to redeem he paid the price not maybe knowing that you were a son and daughter of God but he knew you he never lost sight of you he never knew in what bed of time you would be planning it let me just say this God even knew all the decisions and all the mistakes and everything else God knew all of the husks that we'd have to pick out of our teeth and the pig pen all the mud we'd have to wipe out God knew about all that but that didn't intimidate God because the power of redemption is to claim what was always his and God God is the one who performs the work of redemption not only the ACT where the price is paid and the bias but also to bring that cleansing and that that that change to where we are never will never be slaves any longer so that garment that's put upon us is that garment there of of like that of of the father's own garment his own garment we also hear in the scripture where it speaks of the wedding garment remember there were guests that were invited to a uh a wedding and they were invited and when they there was one who was there and the uh the one the bridegroom they they looked upon him and said hey friend what are you doing here friend that showed he was a church member uh they was acquainted with him but he did not have on the right garment and so this garment this wedding garment is none other than God's own life it's none other because you see what the token the Holy Spirit the reason as we are speaking of the coming of the holy spirit is because it's one thing for the sacrifice to have been offered up there at Calvary and it was and he rose on the third day and he ascended on high but he sent back the life his own life upon the church so that we're not just looking back at an event we are identified without of redemption by his own life coming and claiming and regenerating you and I as Sons and Daughters of God so we are identified by our Sacrifice by being in our sacrifice so when we think of this garment I'm getting somewhere as we look at this garment we also are aware that in Revelations 19 that this garment itself is that garment which is given or granted to that of the Bride of Jesus Christ in an hour that you and I are living in Revelations 19 speaks of no other hour but the hour that you and I are living in let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife the bride she hath made herself ready and to her was granted not that she earned it not that she married it it was granted you see it's Grace that even comes and deals with our life Grace isn't overlooking our sins but Grace is dealing with our life and letting you know there's no sin no problem no situation too great or too big that the blood has not already taken care of that's a word of authority that God has sinned in this hour that's why it's not just reading a scripture it's the anointing and authority of the Lion of God that's roaring out that lets you and I know there is nothing too great that the blood hasn't already taken care of so it's the fine linen fine linen which is the righteousness of the saint that garment so I want to speak on that Garment of our sonship that Garment of our sonship job said I put on righteousness and it clothed me my judgment was as a robe and a diagram so notice it and I put it on and it clothed me but even in my in my judgment even in my judgment my discernment the way that I was approaching things was as a robe and a dad himself it was something that could actually be displayed or was displayed through his life and I believe that Garment of our sonship because as we look around the room tonight we we have you know in our in our dress and everything else but there is a garment that's greater and has a greater a greater price to it than Any Garment suit coat whatever it might be and that is the Garment of the Holy Spirit as a matter of fact you can't even put a price tag on it it's without money it's without price it's worth more as a matter of fact Paul would write of it this way and call it the unsearchable riches of God you can't put a price tag on it it's unsearchable that's how great the Holy Ghost is that's how great this Garment of our sonship is a garment that reveals Sons and Daughters of God and so in Galatians 3 27 for as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ now this baptized was not speaking about in water though we believe in that that comes along with repentance but this baptism is speaking of the Holy Spirit baptizing you and I into the body of Jesus Christ and I know you've heard this example a lot but it's the very word that's used here where you take cucumbers and they pass through the process to become pickles you can never now take a pickle and make it a cucumber it has been transformed and changed for eternally I mean a Pickle's not Eternal but you get what I'm saying right hope it ain't sweet pickles Seether I don't like them things I like deal but at any rate it's a pickles and and recognize that in our life times when that transformation has come that's what this is speaking of as you have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ so there is a garment in our life and this Garment of our sonship is the quickening power of God that has brought forth a new creation that is God's creative work it's not a man's work that's why the preaching of the word is so important and not just preaching but it's preaching under the inspiration by the ministering spirits that are sent forth to minister the spirit of the word to them who are The Heirs of salvation God has sent a word in this hour it's a word that's anointed it's full of Power full of glory and it's for you and I everything that we have need of God has come to bring it forth and to manifest it to reveal it and to bring it out of our lives so here we have been anointed and we have that same garment remember Elijah went on and when Elijah was going on Elisha asked for a double portion and Elijah Elijah threw the Garment back and it was with the same garment that Elisha smote the waters and said let the god of Elijah he called for the god of Elijah to come down why he had the mantle he had the Garment and it fit Elisha perfectly and it fit him perfectly because he was willing to let the word cut him down because God ain't going to tailor the Garment this Garment of sonship God ain't gonna tailor it it ain't oh I better not gain weight they have to let this out three inches and take it in three when I when I worked with suits there was things that you had to know I could look at a situation and say nope and we're not going to be able to do that with that suit coat and that will not look right or with them pants there is a rule that we operate by and so we know this garment we're talking about the Holy Ghost it ain't the Holy Ghost then all of a sudden God is tailoring the Holy Ghost to fit us no it is us that is tailored that is shaped that is brought forth and you know what it really is it's us getting rid of us it's a holy spirit helping us to get rid of the things that really don't matter it's the same way when the Lord Jesus he sent back the same Garment of the Holy Spirit upon the Church of the Living God now I'm gonna I'm gonna take this Avenue with her tonight as we look at this garment and I want to to look at it in this manner as we're talking about putting on this garment because when we are talking about as the Church of the Living God and thinking about that of a useful life and and being a channel that God can operate through we know that it's Satan's objective in all things he cannot stop the word of God from coming to pass but he is interested in trying to do all that he can to try to stop up and try to hinder the channels in our life let me say this to you if you have ever you've been born again by the spirit of God you can never ever ever be unborn again I know that's simple it didn't say sometimes your feelings may not get away but that's where you've got to realize at different times even when I don't feel like this and this and this my feelings have nothing to do with God's promise are you hearing me now I'm going to just kind of deal with that just a little bit here tonight and looking at how the Holy Spirit just pressing this on because Satan this is why thank god brother Branham I I Ponder these things as a pastor and I look at how brother Brandon would take in Christ the mystery and what which is actually a seven seal message and brother random one unfold that in that time and he would take 45 minutes to an hour and deal with even how that we operate as a church body he would help us on my glorious message and I know we might look to say well I'll just skip over to that and wait till he reads his text but you realize the things that he deals with in the first part of that message if you skip over it then the rest will never operate the way it should is that right that's why brother random would take even through uh when even in that month of 63 he would he would spend extensive time and dealing with how but the church the local body of how they ought to operate and you'll find it over the course of years and there were times where the church would come into right there Branham Tabernacle come into a Consecration and brother random at that time would also give him a warning at that moment your sweet your consecration is solid right now but he says You must continue to keep consecrating yourself to God because Satan is going to come around he's going to try to make somebody they'll do something wrong contrary to what you think and he said but no don't go talking to nobody else about it you just take that person before God in prayer and he said because if somebody comes to you to tell you something about another member if you listen to it this is a direct quote out of super sense if you listen to it you Mar your experience you might say I didn't do it but you might not have been the one telling it but if you give your ears to it you Mar your own experience what do you do turn that off I'm not interested in that right here turn everything back around brother Samuel what are you saying I'm saying this right here I don't eat out of trash cans matter of fact I'm not real big on leftovers I like them better now than I probably ever did but I sure don't go to a trash can I don't ever want to go to a trash can I don't even think about it on Sundays as much as I like certain restaurants I don't want to go to their dumpster and find out what was thrown out what are you saying brother Samuel you're not a trash can so you don't need to be taken in other people's trash you say well that might be they might be speaking truth but it's their feelings within it and there's some truth that just does not need to be repeated preach on brother Samuel think a will I'm talking about a garment of our sonship my mama now here we talk about brother Randomness you know he's asked a question to please explain the mystery of the translation of the Bride because this gets down to Everyday living he's asked the question and brother Branham is talking about of how that before Abraham and Sarah could ever receive the promised son God had to change their bodies back young again yeah now that's not wrote in the scripture but yet it is wrote in there is that right because I I'm sorry I just can't believe and I don't mean defend nobody I don't want to offend nobody but I just can't believe that you know that that the Pharaoh was down there whistling after you know somebody who was on a cane I don't believe that I'm sorry God changed her back and I mean you know in Abraham's eyes she was always a knockout but I mean when God changed her back God's got a purpose in changing her back and that was for the purpose to bring forth the promised son and brother Banner would make this statement he said and so must these bodies be changed before we can receive the promised son that's why the Rapture it takes place and here we are in a period of time and here you know when the Rapture takes place and you're the dead in Christ shall rise and here we are changed there is a time here that we are gathered together and you know what we don't see him right away brother Branham puts it out so clear I love it he said because he wants all attention to be on him when he descends and he says we knows we would be looking around to see who missed it he said we're gonna you know how it is if you tell people on Sunday morning go around and shake hands with somebody else by the time some people sit down we're ready to pray the prayer benediction and go home yeah I said that to be kind of funny some of you catch it tomorrow but but at any rate saying come we're going to be getting acquainted with all the Overcomers and how we've been there but then when all those acquaintance you say how will he know I don't know but he's God he's got it all put together and he'll know at that time and then we shall rise to be with him and go to the marriage supper of the lamb but here there's got to be a change of the body before we can ever receive him because this body is sin now I want to go in and begin to continue to quote out of that and out of that part it questions the natural 64. and brother I'm talking about this body being sin and why it's got to be changed he said this first conscience controls this body with see taste filled smell and hear and it's just got us all scrupled up we reason and everything else and the church said woo I think it's a good way of putting he gives us all scrupled up we reason and everything else what is it that first conscience but that new body that that comes from this born again not the first conscience it'll pass away it's that inside something that lives everybody understand it say Amen so where does that new body come from it comes here it's coming from within where that Born Again experience it's coming you see because what remember when you and I when they return in the Rapture here will be them who have entered into the theophany will come back down and pick up a glorified body we will take our glorified bodies and meet our theophany because remember we were never ordained to be angels we were ordained to live in a three-room house and that soul that God has brought and changed in our life it will merge with that theophany that theophany with the glorified bodies that's why as they said over there when the prophet went beyond the curtain of time said here we don't eat drink or sleep right and that's why brother Brandon bringing it right down to the Future home Millennium and future home he would say what is eternal life what will it be it will be eternal life in a human body but a glorified condition not a human body that's just went back to being young again and has all the same complexes or all the same weaknesses no it's a change completely just as the change of the new birth does not leave one weakness in the creation on the inside or we battle the weakness out here but there is no weakness with a child of God that has been born again from our soul notice it's not this outside sea taste feel smell and hear it's subject to death and will die but the inside part of you down in here inside that is the person that cannot die and that's the person that the New Life Starts from from this new birth and it builds another person in the image of this person you are around that life so you see has it where does our growth come from our growth is not something that's coming from out here our growth is from that life that's on the inside it is building within us it's just like that a woman that is expecting and here she is she has a child what happens over those months it goes through the growth all the stages there's times eventually she starts feeling the kicking and the punching and everything else that's going on I don't mean Brian will help him bring back no bad memories on anybody but you understand there's that much going on there's Cravings that she has at certain times there's things you know that sometimes would seem so odd but there is a life on the inside that she is Speedy it really don't have to do anything about herself because some things she might crave and actually would eat that would go against what she in herself would naturally do or what she would eat what is controlling it the life on the inside so I ask you what is it that's directing the appetite it's from that on the inside when there is a new creation on the inside this is why friends that we don't have to say don't do this and don't do that this is why the holy spirit will call out against certain things why because if you keep on walking in those certain things and you keep on entertaining that then the Holy Spirit can never come fully into your life what is God doing when he calls out things on dress and this and that oh brother Samuel they're just harping on that no what God's calling out is letting us know there's some real simple basic ABC things little things that you're allowing to stand in your way from receiving the full Garment of sonship to me this garment's more and worth more than anything and I believe we're called to display it in this hour is that right so potentially notice Brethren would say potentially it's already here and he says see it's the word promise before the foundation of the world and around there this only reflects the negative he goes right back to that that body it only reflects the negative but that which comes from in here will reflect the positive the word and the same thing is the translation of the Bride will be the same thing the word that's in you the body will materialize around that word and that's the same thing it did by Sarah so this is what is that that we take with us we take character with us that's our soul that's the real you and I as a real child of God that's the real you and I that's on the inside I say oh God if this is listen friends if we can just stop right here it would settle everything else God let this be the Forefront of my life if we could just stop right there and say anything that arises anything that comes my way I'm not going to let it stop in my mind I'm not going to sit there and try to entertain it reasoning out what are you going to do I'm going to bring it to where the Judgment seat of Christ is where is the Judgment seat of Christ it's right there in the Throne of your heart listen on the day of Pentecost The Mercy Seat moved into the heart of the believer that's where God is dwelling that's where God Fellowship he told Moses I will commune with thee from above that of the mercy see where is God communing where is God fellowshipping with his children in that of the Soul [Music] that's why all kinds of thoughts can come your way and nothing but lies but when that cell has been anchored there ain't enough Devils out of hell that can ever get that Soul away from God why it's been changed for eternity you might get down you might get discouraged but I say oh God let everything that rises let it be brought to the Garment Hallelujah I shall say help me Jesus another one very familiar how can I take a Cocker ball and make a grain of wheat out of anybody everybody know what a cooker bro is somebody just look at me and what does it look mean like deer in the headline there is that like a laughs like somebody show me a little clip today of when they greet a southerner in a store in a southern area man somebody look back and say man it sure is a hot day in it well the guy looks at him and said are they going to finish it or not no in the satinum well yeah you're right it's a very hot day I don't mean be picking on the southern but you understand there's sometimes there's there's wisdom in saying little there's a lot to be said but just say it like this a Cocker Barrel that's that they meant it is sticky and it hurts I've had them on my on my on my uh my pants when I went hunting uh and you and trying to get them up I don't even want to touch them to get them off it hurts it sticks a washing machine don't get them off it's truth it sticks and you know why it's meant that way it's meant that way so when it is sticking it can be carried to another place and germinate and that seed drop think about it when things want to it causes you I just got to tell somebody I just got to post this be careful you might be posting a kuckerberg seed Mama well how can I how can I take a Cocker barrel and make a grain of wheat out of it how can that be it's impossible for me to do it the only way okay here we go it can be is because inside that Taco Bell has been transmitted from a Cocker Barrel a cockle ball to a germ called wheat life so you open up the Cocoa Brown it's got to become an operation take out that of that germ of Life of kookaburra put in wheat life and then you can close it back up when you bury that taco Barrel one will come forth is what's on the inside of it so on the outside it's Cracker Barrel but when there has been a transmission on the inside where the old cockle Barrel Nature's been taken out and wheat life is put in you can bury it and it will come forth a wheat life in the resurrection oh he said it'll produce a grain of wheat because there's been a life of wheat put in the cocoa bro and the life of the cocoa bro has been taken out but the nature of the kookaburl is still sticky inbound like being sticky I mean I like pancakes but I don't like being sticky I like syrup I like good maple syrup but I don't like being sticky sometimes I have a problem because the stickiness gets all over my Fork what do you do get a new one and wash my hands because I don't like stickiness somehow I I would love to be able to say you know here I come into a place you come into a place I'm sure we all would would love to be able to trade in the stickiness about that first nature but don't worry you know what that is there is a desire within you you hold the poem without that because there's already been new life that's come on the inside of you there is a desire to say God I don't want to live and dwell I don't even want to be operated by this pest house but give me the grace Lord by the wheat life on the inside to bring everything subject to the word of God but the nature of the kookaburl is still sticky and it will be until we go to the next Revival boy I'd like that version we'll be having one this weekend I think we should anyhow it will be until this new life has been fully developed out of the ground and raised up again now that statement does not mean that we live defeated you're not reading it right if you look at it that we live defeated what it's doing is it's just letting you know that your enemy you pack him with you but you don't have to succumb to him bow to him but it's sticky what does that mean there's going to be things sometimes you gotta pick off of your life well I don't know what needs to be picked up the Holy Ghost does if we'll invite the word of God into our life and say Lord come through my life is there some things that's got stuck in my mind things that's got stuck in my head things that's got stuck in my actions Lord I need a washing of Water by the word Lord God why it's recognizing our need of him oh my but now while it's on earth a Cocker Barrel is still sticky but it's got the nature on the inside of it as a wheat here's some real encouraging words you ready as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to what's that say bother you it probably bother other people too but it'll bother you it'll bother you as long as you live but be inside of you notice how it keeps on bringing us bring back to the inside of you you're born again and when you're raised up you're in the likeness of Christ and all the sin has gone from you that's the thing no wonder Paul would write here in Ephesians 6 11 put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against The Wiles but the devil put on means to sink into a garment into a clothing Colossians 3 8 but now ye also put off all these anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth lie not one to another seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds and have put on the new man notice this garment you have put off the old man talking about that old nature the spirit of God has actually come and done a work in our life to where that the old man threw him by that death that divorce and that debt that old man is put away he's dead now we have put on the new man or sunk into that of the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him where there is neither Greek nor Jew circumcision nor uncircumcision Barbarian cynthian Bond nor free but Christ is all and in all in other words simply put the only thing that matters is Christ Nothing Else Matters what what degree or where we're at and everything all of our all of the talent that no matter what it comes down to is when that new man that new man it's all about Christ so then it's no longer about us you see the very moment that we start living out in the about us is the very moment we are not living by the Garment of our sonship and we do when we do not live by the Garment of the sonship and listen that's where you have to have that Authority in your life to bring everything subject to the word of God if not you'll be carried about tossed about with every wind and everything that comes your way but you've got to have a place to realize your Victory is not outside but your Victory is on the inside and it's feeding that man on the inside to do what it will bring forth out of you what is already there it ain't going to come from out there it's already in the seed oh I need more Temperance it ain't going to come from out there it's already in the seed oh I need more faith it's not going to come from out there it'll come from in the sea but it will take the quickening power of God moving in our life and US yielding to that that there might be a adding to our faith virtue adding virtue adding patience adding Temperance you see all of that is packed in the seed it's like when I go on a trip and I pack everything in my bag and put in such a way because I don't like carrying a lot of clothes with men a lot of bags and everything else so I I package try to pack it in such a way that when you know you get there sometimes when you get ready to leave you wonder how am I going to get everything in the bag that that I packed in there and especially if somebody brings you a little knick-knack or something like that I remember one time they brought me this nice basket when I was in Mexico the first time this past year and I thought where in the world am I going to put this thing out beautiful basket that the sister had weaved and made but I had to leave it sitting right there on a nightstand in their home I had to leave it sitting right there I couldn't bring it with me I had no room for it whatsoever what are you saying brother Samuel I'm telling you what the prophet told us where he said that when you have received the Holy Ghost everything you have need of is in you right then including the rapture it's in us already listen let me tell you something even if you're sitting here tonight without the Holy Ghost let me tell you what the Holy Ghost comes for to Quicken it's already in you all you got to do is turn and loose and say Lord let me sink into that garment there's already things you're dealing with my life let me just sink fully into the Garment of sonship Lord glory be to God but put on now notice this put on once again sink into therefore as the elect of god notice is when Paul is dealing with this it's a responsibility of our sonship put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved notice where this this is speaking of it's generating the purity the Purity there within a life in the Heart by the spirit of God now notice here's what we are to sink into bowels of Mercies now those of you I know as you know speaking to people that's in the medical field and water these bowels of mercies it deals with the spleen where there is a recycling of even damaged cells where there's recycling of things that is just not right but it must pass through there in other words what is Paul saying sink into this garment that when things aren't just right there is that which can be passed right through instead of it just getting thrown out but there is an access we have as Believers not just that we have but I've got a confidence that if there's something wrong I'm going to talk about it but what I'm going to do is pray for him because there's bows of Mercy in the house of God there is a place that where there's wrong wrongs can be made right there is a place where error can be corrected and Truth come forth what is it bowels of Mercies and kindness it's called just being kind humbleness of mine low opinion of self now that don't mean walking around always have to say it it don't mean walking around oh I ain't no good I know stop lying that ain't humility what that is that's called Pride it's not humility because humility is not about announcing all of this but humility is where you erect because sometimes things that they're said we really don't believe it we're just saying it because it's a good and right thing to say it just sounds good but you see that's where the Prophet told us in the seals he said we better quit saying one thing and thinking another right I said God let David let not only my words in my mouth but the meditation of my heart let it be lined up learning the humbleness of Matt you see humbleness of mine this comes into display even when there's something you don't agree with something that you don't think is right what kind of attitude do you take they should know better than that look how long they've been around and man not be able to get you a court and get you a TV show humbleness of mine come on friends you see it's easy to be humble when there's no humility required but it's when things do not set right and Jive just right with us what kind of an attitude do we take I'm talking about the Garment of our sonship our attitude this is why what is it that sticky part about us we've got to recognize it it'll bother us until the day that we are removed but remember I pray to God how can it really bother us unless we're really living in the presence of God I mean submitting ourselves to God in the right way if we're not if a person can actually be born again but they'll actually make excuses for stickiness in their life sometimes having scriptures and quotes to go along with it that just seem to get stuck these quotes always get stuck right here and these scriptures always get stuck right here oh God help us my goodness he is all this he only unpacking here humbleness of mine and meekness what's meekness you know the Bible tells us Moses was the meekest man in all the Earth how in the world the prophet told us that Moses had a temper come on he came right out of the prince of God and when he saw the people acting the way he did come on now you come out right of a good service and your children get you on a mess I come on friends or there might not be children might be something else come your way of Bill's in the mailbox or an email has come or something else come on we're not ignorant of Satan's devices that whole purpose is done to try to knock out the confidence that God's put in you and that stickiness flares up and then what does the devil do turn right around and say aha see I tell you at that very moment you want to come right back to the Garment of the sonship and say Lord forgive me Lord Jesus I am not going to live and allow this to Rob what you placed in my heart because God's given you confidence tonight service God's given you confidence Hallelujah meekness you know what meekness is to give place to get place sometimes you have to give place to things you know how it is there are certain things that even as it comes from me that's just me I can we can be getting ready to come into I wish everything well I wish I was completely always perfect in this because there's been some traps but everything that where what my desires to do I'm just you use it for example come into the house of God I do I want to avoid all kinds of conversations I'm not interested in conversations matter of fact I'm not interested in talking about this and talking about that and talking about this I'm not interested I could care less if you could talk to me about the most beautiful hydrangea there is I could care less at that moment there's only one thing I've got on my mind and that is the word of God I hope you understand what I'm saying because with that right there the very thing that the enemy can do he can try to throw something else and it causes the mind to be taken off because there's so many times that even as I'm on this is just me as I'm on my way to church and then even as I sit there and I'm meditating meditating in prayer that the holy spirit continues to unpack and unfold even the direction I can be sitting there studied and I just don't know Lord how are we going to start this thing out you know it's kind of like getting thing getting something going how we going to start it out I don't know how to get it started out and sometimes it's just that way but I think about in our lives if we could in ourselves understand that there are times there are moments what I'm talking about there can be conversations that would come up in our home now let's let's just be honest right now there's conversations that can come up that you know if you get in that conversation it's not a quick answer that conversation you're going to have to give this answer then you'll have to take your position then you have to take the position here and then you have to by the time you're done the jury is still sitting there right well glory to God I feel like going to church now did you see and that's the simple things of how Satan wants to try to come at us and there's certain times of meekness I just don't believe that when it comes to the house of God I say Lord I don't know what every trap is laid out before me but help me in those moments when a place is needed to be given let me give Place Lord y'all ever heard of the statement you got to decide what mountain you're going to die on those you know in the school system when you're teaching or whatever more you've got teachers that would die on everything they down and Hills there's registering kids up for everything in the world why you're just stressing yourself out figure out what mountain you're going to die on and die on it but don't die no ant hill are you with me we all know this it don't matter teacher or not factor of it no matter what it is there's things that come our way but listen I wish I wished that I could say and I'll just speak for the rest of you that my goodness were perfect and after this we'll never die on an ant hill no we probably will still die on some ant hills but God I want to receive Grace that you will teach me and help me Lord help me to live so close to you that when the Trap arises Lord that I don't be drawn into it Lord but just to let it pass and long suffering that means to be long suffering how long long how long's long long instead of the song higher housing longer longer verse 13. I want you to notice this verse forbearing one another um them ing words everybody knows what ing means that means ongoing for bearing one another bearing with one another this is part of the Garment of the sonship this is a garment that's displayed on the Bride of Jesus Christ that's not so much out here but from in here notice when we give the men or man the right away Brethren preaches on that and look into the Unseen he'll talk about it in Victory Day He said so many times we robbed the Inner Man and don't give him the right away if we'll let the inner man have it because let me tell you something the real you is the Inner Man not this guy out here that's all sticky this guy ain't coming up in the resurrection it's that wheat life on the inside well brother Samuel why am I still bothered to remind you you've not arrived home yet why am I bothered because they keep you and I on our knees and humble before God and say Lord I need help amen forgiving oh there it goes again forgiving one another my mind that means ongoing wonder why Paul would write that wonder why well first of all one Paul he was a channel but it was a Holy Spirit you know why because we are a conglomeration of humanity listen every Church you have three kinds of Believers but let me just tell you this this scripture was not written for the unbeliever let me go ahead and say it it wasn't written for the make-believer you know why the only one that can fulfill this would be a believer because why they've got access to the Garment of sonship well it doesn't mean you understand when we talk about forbearing it doesn't mean that forbearing if it's easy no it requires dying but how do I die how do I yield yield to the Inner Man because where is my strength going to come from remember where is that new life where does it build from it builds from the inside so my strength is going to be from the inside where is my where is forgiveness where does forgiveness come from does forgiveness come from out here because I know so many times you know that it's thought of forgiveness is just well it's just saying sorry forgiveness isn't cheap forgiveness is real forgiveness has a cause forgiveness has a price is that right forgiveness is not just something that we just say sorry because remember the Lord Jesus I don't have time to read it tonight but you can read it in Matthew 18. he said that mean that when we failed to forgive someone from our heart we could say it from here but if it's not from here God looks on the heart God looks on the heart is that right so it's got to be something that is within here let me tell you the only way that that's going to be able to be dealt with is that of the Garment of the sonship listen friends I know there's people that you work with people in your family that don't even hear this preaching like this maybe not even read from the scriptures like this and they've had to forgive people I don't have a doubt that there's been people that's had to do that but let me say this to you you and I are called to a rapture we are called to a Divine appointment and all hell is against this Revelation it's against it and he can't stop the Revelation but what he wants to do is get at your life get at my life and try to hinder the flow that's why brother Branham could say and humble thyself he said don't ever take a complex of thinking against somebody when you think they are wrong or you see him do something wrong he said I'm telling you don't ever do that because this Tabernacle will lose its strength oh the prophet of God preaches here it don't matter if the people if the people see it isn't it isn't the pastor that passed packs the victory we are a body together we are a body together that's why individually in the Garment of our sonship this is where we are yielding sinking into and to say Lord help me to sink more into that garment well Amen to that brother Samuel so how many let's talk about that forgiveness for men how many times you reckon I need to forgive somebody well let's see what Google says no don't see what Google says Peter asked foreign Lord just tell me how many times I gonna have to forgive them he said 70 times 7. I wonder if Peter started thinking I wonder if it's a Christian bookstore with a chart that has see 70 times 7 490. I wonder if there's one that has a charts of 490. let me tell you that was a statement that was made for you and I to realize if you're that good at keeping offenses let me tell you what you need you need a good dose of the Holy Ghost you need a real good dose of the Holy Ghost you need to sink deeper in this garment come on Friends but this very word for giving this is what this word means to show oneself gracious benevolent to Pardon give freely bestow to forgive I know I know I know I know I know I know I've heard this said before too and I understand where we go with this oh brother Samuel I can forgive but to forget and you know what it is they've never forgiven now let me just tell you what forgive what forgetting means forgetting does not mean that you forget the offense that's not what forgetting is because there can be an offense that has come your way and you can maybe even hear the mention or see individual whatever more and there's certain that depends on what has been done or taken place it can actually cause something there to move you know your body will react to it in a certain way and it doesn't mean that you're actually even holding anything but you understand that forgiveness in itself when we look at it it's something that is going down to deal with the actual memory in other words we need to take out the malignancy and let it become a benign memory because malignancy will spread it's a cancer is that right it's things that will spread within a life what will a lack of forgiveness now I know well brother Samuel I can forgive but I cannot forget okay I got a lot of quotes on that one as well I also we have that where the Bible says that the Lord Jesus has put our sins in the sea of forgetfulness we have it in the scripture where God has said when I call you back I will remember it no more and with the quotes brother random says see we can forgive but I can't forgive I always remember it'll always be there that that I could remember and notice he said but he almighty God has access to the sea of forgetfulness and he doesn't remember it at all not only are we forgiven he forgot it it's been Justified so you say well then how does that relate to me with the Garment of sonship there is Grace that comes to you and I to be able to take the sting out of the memory to give us Grace so that we can go on and our lives the rest of our lives do not become shaped by past experiences that's God's grace that's why brother Randall could tell us and say he said you know they're founding out in medical science he said that the lack of forgiveness and holding grudges it causes cancer ulcers now the scripture tells us I'm just we're just moving all around but the scripture tells us I know it tells us beloved I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in good health even as thy Soul does prosper and the church said that's God's desire so not just when I'm sick that I will receive Divine Healing but God's interested that we have good health that matches what is on the inside of our soul remember these bodies are still sin but it shows you and I that when we get to looking at things if the prophet could tell it like this and say that they have proved that those who hold grudges women who fuss do fight and argue they die it'll cause cancer fungus and everything else and ulcers will set in listen I got a lot of other scientific data sitting in front of me here right now you know that when I ministered on these things but do you realize that right here when the prophets referring to this this is before Medical Science itself is even discovering this do you realize before a cancer patient when they take them into an Institute to really go through the treatments you know what they try to do they try to calm down through that life and see is there any grudges in that life are they holding anything in their life against anybody this is not a preacher this is them in medical science they said because if there is anything in their life a grudge a lack of forgiveness the medicine won't work at all well that's scriptural in order for the Holy Ghost to come there's got to be a clear confession right in order for healing to come and last all sins got to be cleared out of the life it's got to be repented of God just makes Medical Science testify of his ways so you say by the same well that's out there for cancer well how is it when the word of God is coming forth I say like this friends let the Holy Ghost so come through our lives that God if there's anything that's unlike you if there's something in my life that's not lined up right if I'm holding a grudge if there's something that's there it's not worth it lord it's keeping you from being more effectual in me and through my life and it'll affect every other relationship in your life I don't have time to preach at all tonight but I just I I think we just I think the holy spirit is hit all right here tonight God has a way of doing it he has a way of doing I'm just glad to go with him here's a simple statement oh you've heard it a lot too resentments and grudges and there's all the scriptures I just didn't go through all them tonight but the principle was laid out can you say man where we're laying James talks about how close we are to the coming of the Lord be patient establish your hearts Grudge not against one another and that word Grudge right there it means a h so when we sing the song At The Mention Of Your Name that's what that's that's what that word Grudge means but friends I'm pointing you to the place of resource it's within you the same it seems like some things are sticking here well just sink deeper the same I'm having problems in this area in my life just sink deeper in the Garment say God take me deeper Lord take me deeper I want to go deeper I don't matter where you're at tonight whether justification sanctification Lord take me deeper baptism of the whole take me deeper Lord I want to go deeper I want to live by the Garment of the sunshine I don't want to lean on my own understanding it's always messing me up it gets me all scrupled up is that right this is why they would say resentment grudges bitterness it's like drinking poison and waiting for the other person and they're doing fine glory to God maybe I need to take a little bit more no no stop just put that down and what you need is a good drink of the Holy Ghost that's what you need because let me tell you what the Holy Ghost is it has within it forgiveness it has within it release and pardon because let me tell you how serious Grudge is let me just say this to you I think this statement is one that would need to be mentioned Brethren told us the people no matter what someone's done choose life he said if there's one ought in your heart against any person sinner or Saint you're in danger of Hellfire well what is ought well they've done wrong wanting to see that person destroyed is what you call malice and that ain't the love of God the love of God is corrective but the word correction in the scripture does not mean to destroy that word correction I know my Bible it means restoration are you hearing me that's what correction means that's a desire that we would have is that right oh I just say it like this like that remember that one servant that came and healed the king a hundred ten thousand talents was it called King have mercy on me please forgive me let my debt go Matthew chapter 11 my death Go Let It Go and the King had compassion on him he let him go so he went out and here he had a servant that on him a hundred Pence I mean we're talking about going from like a hundred thousand dollars to a five dollar bill and this guy went out of the went out of the presence of the king and he laid his hands on that guy give me my five dollars a lot of good five dollars gonna go do against your five hundred thousand dollar debt but you see what it was he acted the way he did because he was in debt you can only exercise true forgiveness as you know it I'm come on come on I'm writing the scripture when Paul wrote to Philemon remember his his slave that servant onisimus had fled away right he took some money he'd ran away and notice Paul writes back to Layman and said hey you owe me your own soul this is my son in the gospel he's more profitable to you now than he was when he left [Music] went back carrying a letter that had his pardon wrote all over it Hallelujah come right from the messenger of the age I've got a pardon I'm no longer guilty and there's no more condemnation on me ain't no shame on me I am free what is it I've been forgiven and he's running with a message and Paul lets from Lima know thou knowest thou always thou own soul even to me why a word had come that had brought that broke the chains off of Layman's life and that's what brother Brown could say I think it's the Christian attitude that if anybody asks forgiveness you forgive them that's real sonship this is the Garment that we want to display because you realize he goes on there to say in Matthew 18 it says when the wind here the king came and took that Wicked servant he threw him into prison but you know what the prison he was in it wasn't one of so much of bars it was torment he was tormented because he would not forgive servant but all he had to do was recognize it's a moment of forgiveness there's been a breakdown but I'm ready to come back in line and get everything settled get it all right under the blue we're brothers we're sisters like that song says you're my brother you're my sister so take me by the hand together we will stand I'll leave you with one last quote here as we finish this part up I love this statement forgiveness is to release a prisoner and to realize that the prisoner is you not the other person you're still held by the memory of the offense but Samuel what should I do well let me just tell you this right here I know I've closed everything up I've closed it all up let me just put it in terms so you and I understand it sometimes we get we when we're on the internet and searching for stuff and looking for things sometimes there's pop-ups that come up there's things that comes up right now what comes up if you go in an amazing here you go maybe you're looking at a pair of Crocs and all of a sudden then here you are you're going on there to look at I don't know vacation or wherever west side of Lorraine you're looking it up and all of a sudden here comes a pop-up Crocs why it's what you showed interest in before see everything on the internet is based on algorithms so it studies you and it tries to feed to you what you like we're both saying what does that how does that have to do with offenses and memory and forgiveness or it does have a little application in there because when you can allow the love of God to say Lord let me be so sunk into this garment it doesn't mean that pop-ups won't come it just means you don't pay any attention to them no more memories can come up of offenses but you know what don't bother me no more don't bother me no more it can pop up so just because it pops up don't mean it ain't been forgiven and you hadn't forgot about it what it is you can stand there and look at it said don't bother me no more of the sonship glory be to God musicians come oh don't you love him tonight amen aren't you thankful for God's grace tonight thankful for his Mercy Hallelujah I tell you we get to we get to exercising in that Garment of sonship we start feeling lighter my load feels lighter ain't that right brother Chris I start feeling a lighter you know why because it's that Garment of the sonship it's already been a rapturing condition that's coming here and and here we are when we get caught into that in Heavenly places and my we start fellowshipping around that because that's really who we fellowship with we're fellowshipping though you shake my hand but what it is that we have fellowship with one another is the attributes of almighty God our fellowshipping one with another we are Sons and Daughters of God oh we have been made more than conquerors I say Lord Jesus let me sink more into that garment Lord because this guy out here is sticky it gives you sticky and there's sometimes I do need I need some help sometimes in prayer maybe it's sometimes where there's around men maybe you know talking with my wife talking with another brother there are some times and God is there to help us not that I don't want to encourage somebody's stickiness are you hearing me I don't want to encourage somebody's stickiness but I my desire is let's try to let's try to get out of that stickiness because you know what it's sticky and it's prickly that's what that Coco bro is but oh my may God help us to sink in to that garment let me so sink into it Lord there's no doubt in my life there's some more tailoring that I need in my life I'm sure of that in my character like Elisha needed to be tailored out I know there's more of Samuel that needs to be tailored away you know it's kind of like getting in front of the mirror and here you go brother's with your suit with your suit coat on and you go like this and you go oh boy here we go right now may have to have a rubber band on this one to hold this thing together but what do you realize when you look in the mirror you need to lose some got to cut out certain things here and there and that's how it is when we look into the mirror of God's word when we look in the mirror of God's word and say Lord better in my life I want to sink more into the Garment I don't need the Garment enlarged I need to sink more into the Garment Lord and you know what he gives us Grace to do that aren't you grateful for that tonight the same Victory one of these days that same victory that you're sinking into sinking into death will be swallowed up in Victory and this corruption will put on incorruption will be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye but I'm grateful that we get glimpses of that right now aren't you we can come right in the service he can change our thinking about something change our outlook on something what is it the power of the Resurrection moving Upon Our Life come in Gloomy and here is a prince of God just sweeps right by and my goodness what Satan has tried to hedge us into a corner and then the prince of God just comes right by our way and here we are what do you do I'll tell you what you do at that moment you ought to just stand on the Lord's Side and say that's right amen chicken ever you don't got no power and no authority over me what do you do sinking into the Garment of the word Hallelujah you just get ready for the song brother Heavenly Father what I know throughout this building tonight this is our desire we want to sink more into that garment Lord we're always there's the battle pulled Lord God but may we bring every thought help us Lord to live live from that outer from that inner man when we live Lord from the outside or react we're pulled that way Lord the stickiness but I pray that God [Music] I think Lord is as we get in your presence kind of like this when we come out of Lord being in prayer we come out of a service come out of a Time Lord that just been meditating on you and then it's like when you have to walk out into another environment you feel like oh my goodness I don't even fit here this don't mind I I feel like such a stranger I feel so all alone maybe they come out of their cubicle maybe they come out of their space Maybe Lord where they've been walking Lord in the halls and worshiping you and been hearing Lord God when they walk into the break room or something like oh my I'm a stranger here and here Lord Jesus that's just how Lord that as we would just live just the Simplicity of living in your presence O Lord entertaining you Lord fellowshipping with you that God as we spend more time with you and that I realize Lord working an eight-hour day sometimes Lord some work 12-hour day it doesn't mean Lord that they've got to take the rest of the 16 hours of the day they're the other 12 12 hours of the date no no it's the quality of the time it's making time for you Lord it don't even have to wait till after the job is over they can have fellowship with you Lord I believe God that you can come right by the side you can help them Lord if they'll just reach out to you and they'll say Lord I want to have Fellowship I really don't know Lord how to keep my mind all occupied on things I have to do and this and that but Lord I want to entertain you I want to have fellowship with you I want to walk these halls with you Jesus the Lord to wear that as we would help us to where the things around us would be like that Lord you would bother us the bothering the Lord is where we've lived in your presence to where when we can sense even a reaction wanting to come from our life Lord that would not be a reaction of the spirit of God it would even bother us of the thought but Lord help us help us to realize Temptations will come but temptation is not sin Lord you give Grace you give Grace you help us Lord throughout this journey and we want to live from that Inside Man I want to sink deeper in that garment Lord oh I realize it isn't just the Lord on them on a nice relaxing day that we just would sink more into it but sometimes the lord it's coming when there is tests there is Trials there's adversity it requires us to sink more into this garment that's what was happening with job when job said I have put on righteousness righteousness and it clothed me my judgment this is what my our desire is Lord let our judgment be like a diadem let that discernment Lord God give us Lord I pray help us that we might have the right discernment and have discernment Lord greater discernment help us father we know Lord that that can only come through and by you of the word
