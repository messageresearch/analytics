with us and ministering the word of the Lord so uh we just come expecting to hear from the Lord first time Brother David is been here but uh brother David's a real man of God and uh just a real wonderful brother and uh when I heard that he was coming this way I said you're not going to sit you're going to speak uh I told him I said you know because we we really love Brother David my boys you know they've they've had him for a counselor for many years there in byc and I've just watched him not only with them but with so many of the young people and uh with all the around he's a he's a deacon right there in brother Nathan Bryant's assembly and uh just so thank you for your prayers this past weekend I know you had wonderful Services I was able to uh get in on those and uh to be able to listen and so thankful for what the Lord amen had to say to us and how that brother Alexander and brother Steph just yielded themselves to the Lord and amen we were blessed amen you know God knows I I'm so thankful for the variety I'm thankful for for the fivefold ministry amen and so also your prayers we just so appreciated that just just a wonderful uh meetings down there at brother Nathan's

also want to remind you of the this coming Sunday evening we'll have a fire pit Fellowship as well and that'll be uh the time itself to be announced I think it might be on the flyer or on the calendar that's posted on the bulletin board but uh we'll make sure you know that but please bring camping chairs uh and if you have brother Wily's chair please bring it this time he's still in he's still looking for it uh also hot dogs or hot dog buns and any non- perishable snacks so I think we know what non- perishable means potato salad's a good thing but not to be setting out uh you know I I know some of some of us may have cast iron stomachs but not all of us do and sometimes you know I've heard things where people say wow I must have been the flu going through after that carrying and uh no it it wasn't the flu in many situations it really wasn't it was simply that things were spoiled and so you know I think it we just with the non- perishable snacks and uh if you need help of what to bring well you can personally see me and I'll try to give you what I would eat on a Sunday evening amen don't you love the Lord amen God bless you amen and just keep also aware of the different announcements on uh for um you know the month of uh September as well brothers that will be coming through and then also in October we'll try to get that up as well I know brother darl Ward's going to be with us here in September on a midweek service and then brother codre Diggs will be in October on a midweek and uh so just keep an eye on that and we'll try to get that out to you as well as on the bulletin board so in Psalms chap 31 and verse 19 oh how great is thy goodness which thou Hast laid up for them that fear thee which thou Hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man Thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from The Strife of tongues blessed be the Lord for he hath showed me his marvelous kindness in a strong City praise God for I said said in my haste I'm sure probably each of us could find ourselves here for I've said in my haste I am cut off before Thine Eyes nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I Cried unto thee oh love the Lord all ye his Saints for the Lord preserveth the faithful and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer be of good courage and he shall strengthen your heart Heart All Ye that hope in the Lord i' just like to take just a little thought a little word tonight and that is the word preserved preserved may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated just drawing as we've been looking at Job 23 and and how the steadfastness of the Lord through it all and God's faithfulness and I want to just draw from that verse and verse 23 oh love the Lord all ye his Saints for the Lord preserveth the faithful and plentifully rewarded the proud doer that word preserveth that's right here in the Scripture it means to guard to watch or to watch over to keep to guard from dangers to observe to guard with Fidelity that means with all faithfulness and loyalty to keep secret and and to be kept close and to be blockaded and when we look at this in the scripture we've been uh looking at this for some time on that thought of of faithful and faithfulness and when we look at it in the scripture because it says he preserveth the faithful and so we we recognize that it's it's something when we look at the faithfulness Paul would write of this in addressing in the beginning of every letter he would address to to the Believers and he would say it like this in the Ephesians 1:1 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus he would say in Colossians 1 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God and timotheus our brother to the Saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at colossia Grace be unto you and and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ so Paul is not looking at this address when we speak of faithfulness here we realize that we can be faithful in many different things and I think as we've looked at this for some time that there is always that part that sometimes of of of faithfulness and uh uh where you know a person could you know be so loyal to so many different things and rest upon things and let me just give an example there's people that could just you know be ever so faithful in the regimen of So Many religious practices and yet that is not the faithfulness that Paul is speaking of here I I believe friends I believe that as God is faithful that God himself produces and brings forth faithful people right I believe that because it it cannot it's just like we've heard over and over if a dog begets dog and a a cat begets C cats then how could God beget anything else by the power of the Holy Ghost other than anything that would be like his own kind and it would not then be of Our Own Strength I mean this is what's a paradox that God can take lives and even people that we can see it right through the New Testament like you take the book of Galatians the people of galatia in their natural entity were fickle people they were up and down and persuaded this way and that's just not from the gospel that came to them but it was that's the kind of natured and tempered people that they were but to think of how that the greatness of God would come back along and through that battle where there were those who tried to drag him this way and pull him this way but there's an anchor there's something that could hear God's voice that spoke to them and it would stabilize them through it all that's where all the glory goes to almighty God God that's part of God preserving you and I preserving the faithful and so when we see this with the faithfulness here it is to the faithful that is in Christ Jesus that's so important that's in Christ Jesus he was preaching it to the sav to the called out the separated the set aside and the faithful in the call and so when we look at this in the Book of Genesis 32 and verse 30 because we want to just look at that thought for a few moments the Lord preserveth the faithful and so here is Jacob in this moment after he has wrestled it out with the angel of the Lord and this is a declaration he's made that Jacob called the name of the place pineal for I have seen God face to face and my life is preserved so it is preserved because of God's own life in Matthew chapter 9:1 16 it said no man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment for that which is put in to fill up taketh up from the Garment and the rent is made worse I I remember when I was growing up man I feel I graduated when I my mom stopped buying me the double knee pants you know them things stuck out all the time I probably serve some others can fellowship with me around that you know you could wash the rest of the jeans the rest of them would fade except for them Parts on your knees and then if you got a hole on your knee mom was going to you know you know Iron it and put the patch on there and and everything else and you know you had to go around with that patch it didn't look right cuz it wasn't part of the whole garment and this is what God is speaking here that no man putteth a piece of a new cloth in an old garment it because it it it will it will the rent is made worse verse 17 neither do men put new wine into Old bottles else the bottles break and the the wine runneth out and the bottles perish but they put new wine into new bottles and both are preserved now I want you to think of this in this hour even how how the coming of the Holy Spirit and the word coming in our midst in this hour if there was not a group of people that was ordained by God to be able to hear that voice and to receive that word then the word itself would return turn void but God said my word will not return back unto me void and he also said my words are spirit and life so God when he sends a word he's already in mind there's a people on Earth that are ordained to be a place for that word to come into and that word to express and live out now I just say it in this way brother Ram could talk about in the time that he was living and speak of how that was the Golden Age of the Gospel this this time that we're living in and he would talk about the advancement and as you know begin to ponder those things and to recognize we hear the testimonies and the mighty acts of God that was done through the ministry of brother brandham and all of that was for a purpose to declare that he is here that the presence of the Lord is here not something that's far off what's been hidden what's been obscured by the tradition veil of man God has now rent that Veil and is standing in the Forefront of his people and to realize that the message as we are standing in this moment is greater than what it was when it was delivered through God's Prophet because the message is no longer prophecy but the prophecy has become flesh so we're living in a moment and a time that the purpose is that the word would find its Mark in a life in a group of people and that the message itself this word is producing Jesus Christ not just on the church grounds but in our homes in our lives it's affecting everything about our lives it's Jesus Christ that's being revealed both are preserved the word is not just passed through us you know there's a lot of waves going through this building right now that can just pass right through you and have no effect if you're not built I'm not built to pick up cellular waves they're flying all through here I'm not built to pick up Wi-Fi Rays I'm not built for that but there are things that are built to pick those things up pictures and things that are being transmitted through an invisible means there are instruments that are designed to bring forth those waves into a place that we can look at it and see it and let me just say this that seed of God that part that God placed on himself on this on in the earth in your life it is that part that part of God himself that picks up God in this hour and reflects him both are preserved Hallelujah Jude 1 Jude the servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James to them that are Sanctified by God the father and preserved in Jesus Christ and called Mercy unto you you and peace and love be multiplied now in Psalms 9710 David said ye that love the Lord hate evil he preserveth The Souls of his Saints he remember how Jesus could stand in Pilot's Hall he said you have no power over me except it was given to you by my Father which is in heaven is that right Peter would Express by prophecy that it was the predetermined counsel of God that he would appear there and take our judgment but in that the promise also held that he should raise again that's where Peter said it wasn't possible that the grave should hold him amen think of this in Proverbs 2:8 he keepeth the paths of judgment and preserveth the way of his Saints oh I love that Psalms 37:23 the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord and he delighteth in his way though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand so a good man notice from verse 23 he delighteth in his way and though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand I don't have to go through this building but every one of us have been here at times that maybe in our minds in our spirit in our body with the where there has been though he fall not not a bad man not lukewarm man a good man who is it that gives you and I the strength to get back up the Lord upholdeth him with his hand we would not even have strength to get back up if it were not for the Lord upholding our hand David said I have been young and now I'm old yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread he is ever Mindful and lendeth and his seed is blessed depart from Evil and do good and dwell forever more for the Lord loveth judgment and forsaketh not his Saints they are preserved forever but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off I'm glad that he doesn't forsake us the righteous shall inherit the land and dwell therein forever the mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom and his tongue talketh of judgment the law of his God is in his heart and none of his steps shall slide notice where the law is at it's in his heart so none of his steps shall slide we just read in this same chapter of a good man that though he fall the Lord will uphold him with his hand and to think that how when that the word is placed in the right position that none of his steps shall slide in other words to give completely away because there is a strength on the inside I want you to see this the Lord preserveth the faithful it isn't that the faithful are always hitting the mark but it's a God who is faithful to where if we've got off the Mark he's faithful to bring us and line us back up he preserveth the faithful so that none of us will ever be able to stand there on that day and feel self-sufficient in any way and you know this once we begin to feel self-sufficient that we've got it all together we've got all the tees crossed all the eyes dotted that's the very moment that God will begin to pull back his presence and remind you and I that without me you are nothing hallah he preserves the faithful so oh love him all you Saints Psalms 12:6 the words of the Lord are pure words as silver tried in a furnace of fire purified seven times Thou shalt keep them oh Lord Thou shalt preserve them from this generation forever so God remember God just doesn't reveal his word to be revealing his word right you realize that God can come right down and reveal like it was when John the Baptist stood there baptizing not everybody saw that light that's right John saw it he was ordained yet it was very real it was very present is that right amen there were those as it said when Paul met him on the road uh to Damascus some saw the light did not hear the voice some heard some heard there of a thundering but did not hear or see the light but you see it's it's for in for those that it is intended for and let me just say it if not for God's grace how many times you hear brother brandom say in a prayer line he said oh God help me they're going to miss it Lord their healing their answer was present and now it was like it was going to go right over their head but God in his grace preserves the faithful aren't you glad that God sees to it that the word that is intended for you and I we're not going to miss it that that to me does not produce a carelessness in my life I'm sorry that does not produce of well where a carelessness remember a rest and carelessness are two different things to rest is to where we are delighting ourselves in the things of God carelessness is where there's no preparation there's no inclination towards the things of God it's just caseras it shall be even as it shall be that is not the attitude of the believer if Noah would have taken that that attitude in the time when it was made known to him about the ark there would never have been an ark prepared there would have been no saving of his household but listen it just goes to show like it was with Abraham Noah and on down God does not reveal his love secrets to any life or any heart that is just going to look upon them and not value them the way that God himself has valued them and watched over themen I tell you God has watched over even the promise of that of the Messi God watched over it when you had those that rose up and led people astray out in the wilderness and saying that this all happened before the Lord Jesus came along all of these different ones that were coming men had their own ideas but God watched over his word didn't matter how dark it got didn't matter how religious it got God watches over his word and God will never cave on anything outside of it being his word aren't you glad that he sends a preparation ation for us God will preserve them from this generation I want you to think about it friends as I stood down there and I thought you know uh even when I was uh standing down there and uh you know there in Jeffersonville and I think you know I drive down and many times when I'm down there I get out real early in the morning I go find somewhere to pray and I was just thinking as I going around and looking around I'll get out real early in the morning I'll go listen to a message somewhere and then go and pray and I thought about it Lord how many people have stood and WR around this area right around here that even live right here even people that rub shoulders with brother brandham even that has been right here but yet don't know what's taking place it's something that's so out in the open yet it is being done in such secrecy because you know why it's not a public show out here it's an inward work of the holy spirit that is working in the hearts of the people people it's even how God brings his word right in assembly it the word so touches your heart so touches my heart God help me Lord help me to live closer to you Lord help me to serve you better Lord give me Grace to overcome in that area of my life why because we are preparing for departure amen this is not a civic duty here tonight that grows old this is not a civic duty this is preparing for rapture Hallelujah and find out that God always you know as it was in the camp when God would call his people beyond the camp how that God would when he would come among them each time God would deliver his word to a prophet Amos 3:7 the Lord will do nothing but what he Reveals His secrets to his servants the prophets God Reveals His word first because men though having the The Written Letter they get off they get away from the word of the Lord a powerful thought how a person can have the Written Letter but yet be in their own way of thinking and in their own way of thinking build themselves a camp and it becomes a selfmade camp and God the moment anything becomes self-made God makes his departure amen because God will never vindicate the word of a man God will never come around and vindicate and move with that of a man but God comes to vindicate his word is that right now notice he came brother Ram says like this we find out he dwelt among the prophets he then became a stranger to them talking about those of Israel for he dwells only in his word to confirm it and the Bible said he watches over his word to confirm it he's trying to find someone the Bible says in Proverbs 22:12 the eyes of the Lord preserve knowledge and he overthroweth the words of the transgressor I wonder standing in that day when God sent a word of preservation and Noah Noah finding favor with God found Grace in the eyes of the Lord he began to move and build a boat do you realize there were many other boats there were many other boats that were being built but this one there was a couple things that was different first of all it was God constructed according to God's pattern and it was a boat that did not need to be brought to water but water would come to it are you with me God here he was no doubt how crazy they thought he was because he wasn't a ship Builder he was a farmer and he's building the ship or this boat out there where there's no water around it you know in our modern day when they build the ships and even they're releasing them they release them and build them right there on the waterfront right they're not going to try to transport them across the land but notice when the time would come how that God preserved his word how the knowledge that had come in that hour and when those around there said well there there ain't never been any rain and there ain't never been anything like that and all of this was taken place but oh my how that it moved in that moment to where that that rain itself be to fall and The Fountains of the deep begin to break up cuz you realize the Earth at one time was standing upright but there became one an atomic that got out of somebody's hands and it all worked in the plan of God and it King Kinks this Earth over to a 23 and a half degree tilt is that right the prophet taught us it was an atomic explosion that got out of somebody's hands and it kicked it over just like this oh I'm glad that one of these days oh my that you and I we will not be here for the atomic bomb that's to be dropped on This Nation there is an escape that is prepared for you and I and there will come forth this Earth after that time there will come a setting upright once again oh my how was the words of those who this lived around the ark you know there were those who lived around the Ark in that hour there were those who even had come around the ark and said let's just say per chance that Noah was right let's just stay around here because you know it might be right and and so we don't know but remember they came at a time and they begin to knock on the door Noah opened the door they thought well Noah's family Noah will surely open the door because he is family and yet Noah could holler out through there through that door and tell him say hey I'm not the one who closed the door it was God who called me from in the ark to come in here to safety I'm not the one who closed it God closed it what was it friends what was it that allowed every one of those animals that had to be there and for all of Noah's family to be in that place what was it it was God's word of preservation that took a hold of their heart in life it was God preserving want you to think of this God is only brother Ram will say it over and over God only wants to find a heart that he can get into how that God watches over his word to vindicate it think how Satan wants to set everything out remember even through before the ministry of Elijah here in the end time there was the Alexander dowy up in up in Illinois and my they've got their own little community and they've got Elijah's robe and all of these things what was it to try to do take away from the original but it didn't stop God God is going to watch over his word and fulfill his word in his time I'm working on that thought he preserveth the faithful yes God watches over his word Isaiah 27:3 I the Lord do keep it so there's not one promise that's went by in God's mind I will water it every moment lest any hurt I will keep it day and night my goodness if God can do that and remember how the prophet would give you and I instructions in our walk with God take a promise of God receive a promise of God in the right mental attitude and it will come to pass why because the word itself has within it the creative transforming power and if we'll take that Word of Promise and begin to water it with praise but you see many times what we do is we'll get a word and we're expecting I want something that's instantaneous I don't know about you but I hate instant mashed potatoes when they go to make them at the house keep them I'm not interested in them it kind of helps me out so I can watch my carbs in the right way I'd rather have the potatoes that you know a potato was present where there's chunks every once in a while that somebody missed and mashing brother Samuel you're picky well just just a simple example that if we can look at it in our own lives sometimes we throw in the towel instead of doing what God does we want God to be the god of his word and God said I am a god of my word but act like I act take the promise in your heart and begin to water it water it with what praise not complaints not discouragement not negativity come on but water it with praise thank you Lord well when I see it come to pass I'll begin to thank him that's not what a Seed of Abraham does Mary Mary the prophet said like this Mary was positive before she was positive why because she had met a positive god with a positive promise Hallelujah so before I feel anything or see anything at all it's finished amen the prophet said as soon as you say to this mountain be thou removed he said there's one little grain of sand that begins to turn loose in Yonder world and you say there's nothing that took place he said oh yes there is one grain of sand is a testimony the rest of the Mountain's got to go now watch this watch this preservation the Lord cannot sit down indoors and door a book of rules and say a word and then come around and deny and if you say you got the Holy Ghost and the Bible says a certain thing to do and you say oh I don't believe that you just remember that spirit in you is not the holy spirit cuz he can't deny himself he can't deny himself he wrote the word and he watches over it to perform it he preserveth the faithful God's watching over his word notice is Psalms 119 verse1 blessed are the undefiled in the way who walk in the law of the Lord blessed are they that keep right his testimonies that seek him with the whole heart they also do no iniquity they walk in his ways now I want to I want to just be clear here real quick that watching over his word it isn't for you and I with God a partnership that is on conditional means if you will I will cuz that's never worked right and it never will right because what what God 's desire is is where our heart says I will right a person can be very very astute and have such great uh fortitude to be able to stop this and quit that and quit this but the prophet says that in the message Perfection he said that don't prove anything it's where where is our heart in the things of God God never wanted our head nor our fortitude there were men and there have been people that are very strong in their mind and in their genetics that's not what God's after but what God's desire is is the heart because when he has the heart that in itself will regulate and God can control right from that seat so it's not if you will I will but it is his desire and fervency of his word becoming preeminent first place in our hearts and that is this the word is always right and my idea is always wrong that's where the word is coming to preeminence that's where he preserveth the faithful that's where that you and I have to look at all things we might have ideas we might have feelings but yet when it all comes down to it we forsake our ideas and our feelings when the word of God is presented before us that's giving the word preeminence in our lives this is why Jesus could say in John 15:4 abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except you abide in me I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and Men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you that's right see com again God sending his word God does not send his word with just a a wondering but it's the promise behold I send unto you there is a you I send unto you Elijah the prophet and that you go that is just as known and declared and settled from the mind of God as it was when the Isaiah broke into that channel a virgin shall conceive God already knew who it was it wasn't that Mary became she become such a good girl that God said I'll pick her on my team that's not what it was she went through battles she went through tests it was a persever don't you realize even among our young people even among others that come around even when God begins to start in a life friends this is why we need to pray for one another because hell every demon out of hell it's after our young people it's after hearts that make a start for God what do we need to pray for we need to pray not talk pray God let it be Lord they come to a place that they meet you let their heart come to that place true is that right amen that's the greatest thing we can do and I'll tell you what the more time we spend in prayer the less frustrated we become the only reason we get frustrated is because we are trying to somehow put it together ourselves trying to make things happen ourselves we cannot make things happen on our own we cannot make things happen very clear scripture that we quote not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord Lord is that right my God help us amen if his words God wants his words to abide in our hearts if ye abide in me and my words abide in you this is a preservation righteousness you realize when that takes place in that way that God is equipping you with just exactly what you have for the moment when situations adversaries and things arise it might be a thought it might be a situation on the job it might be something that comes up in the family do you realize you have the authority to speak to this mountain don't go by your feelings because your feelings it'll only hinder it but go by what God has said you have authority to speak to this mountain that's why Paul could pick up what David said we having the same Spirit of faith we speak under that that same Authority is that right righteousness 13:6 or Proverbs 13:6 righteousness keepeth him that is upright in the way but wickedness overthroweth The Sinner the highway of the upright is to depart from Evil and he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul right you see this is where now comes that responsibility see God is showing us the way before us God is showing us our footsteps this is where to step and and as a Believer what are we faithful to it's faithful to his voice that this is the next step that's the next step that's the next step to make just like brother Brandon remember what happened when brother Brandon got all confident in himself I've been out here as a guide I've hunted on this mountain I've done this and I've done that and you know what can you know what happened right brother BR said you know what the Indians call that the death walk cuz you're going in circles there's no progression whatsoever but finally even of all his experiences he finally had to come to listen hallu to the voice that was trying to speak to him hallu you're lost you need help and listen friends I wouldn't be too big here tonight to say I'm lost I need help I wouldn't be too big that if I was lost in my mind if I was lost in battles going on in my mind if I was lost underneath anxiety if I was lost underneath a complex I would not be too big to say Lord help me oh brother Samuel what's that going to say about me it's going to say that you're a Believer that's got courage to say Lord help me I think we need got to put aside on the acting cuz the ACT ain't getting us nowhere it's time for you and I I'm not come to church here tonight just for somebody else I've come here tonight to have a meeting with God I've come here yes I come to be one my brothers and sisters to be a channel but I've come to receive from God I've not come to church tonight to see who did and who didn't I've not come to see who's up and who's down I have come here to receive from God and put my lick of fire in that if somebody else is down is discouraged let's get some licks of fire together where the spirit of God can move down and bring a charge and encouragement in hearts and lives oh Lord Jesus help us that's why brother Ram says it like this in the message thirst he said Jesus said we can add one we if we add one word to this and take one word from it our part is taken out of the The Book of Life not one scripture we must take it just the way it's written and God watches over his word to perform it and we know that it's got to be just right now watch this no matter what a church would say what anyone else would say if you're born of the spirit of God you become part of the Bible God told Ezekiel he the prophet he said take the scroll and eat it then the prophet and the scroll became part of each other and that's the believer when he receives the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit wrote the Bible and the spirit of God is the word of God my words are Spirit In the Beginning was the word and the Word was with us and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us Hebrews 13:8 he's the same yesterday today and forever and when you are a part of the word then let something come contrary to that word there's a little buzzer sets off real quick that's right the Lord preserveth than the faithful am the faithful who are in Christ Jesus the faithful who have become part of the word and as God watches over the word though men have wanted to misconstrue it they've wanted to misinterpret it they've wanted to misplace it but God watches over his word to vindicate it so the Lord preserveth the faithful who are the faithful they are the word made flesh so God is watching over his word and God Ain never had a word go down and defeat never lost a battle Hallelujah it might have looked like some went down and defeat they didn't go down and defeat they were victorious yes amen well I know so and so they lost the battle of cancer that's a lie they didn't lose the Battle of cancer healing will either come in this Dimension or that Dimension over there as soon as the transition from this Dimension to that realm over there cancer itself has not taken anybody are you hearing me I know that seems like an awful big statement but it's true when somebody says we lost to this we didn't lose nobody to that God Is A Healer and there's those standing on the other side I don't care what they dealt with in this body in time as soon as that Soul made its migration in that moment the faithful Shepherd was right there and they stepped right into that other body they never experienced the pain no shuffling of Step there waser no cancer that's there why it don't have any Authority to enter there it's right here in this body of sin is where it stops but thanks be to God who giveth us the [Applause] victory praise the Lord and when we're weak the Lord is preserving the faithful he's emanating his strength are you hearing me he's emanating his strength Sarah Abraham the Bible says who against hope Abraham daily his body getting weaker Sarah weaker their body weaker but inwardly he was getting stronger he was getting stronger cuz he was feeding on the word of God think of how that Abraham each moment looking over to Sarah Sarah you feeling any different today now he could look look look he could see her you feeling any different today right she said no I don't feel any different why would he ask her that if he could see it because this is where it shows the victory he had become into a place to be able to live beyond what his senses was declaring are you hearing me we're talking about Abraham's seed our senses want to declare a lot of things that's right is that right there's a lot of things within our senses and sometimes listen friends we can get caught in those senses right but the Lord preserves the faithful am God is the saving strength of his anointed and the faithful what is that of the faithful those who are in Christ Jesus those who are in that of the word and when he's and when he speaks the Sheep know the voice of their Shepherd amen aren't you glad about that what a rest that brings you in I he's preserving the faithful oh my let me just let me move on here just a moment if we look here in the scripture in Psalms 32:7 if you can just skip to that that scripture with me thou art my Hiding Place Thou shalt preserve me from trouble Thou shalt Compass me about with songs of Deliverance prise the Lord now let's look at the scripture a minute Thou shalt preserve me from trouble it really sounds like that there would never be trouble come around us that's right but he says preserve me from it in other words trouble is not going to stand Victorious over me trouble's not going to stand Victorious over you you see God knows exactly what you and I need the David said he'll Compass me roundabout with songs of Deliverance yes amen something about that you know what when it says that there's times where there's got to come Str Str God can bring it through songs he brings his word but what is it it Encompass us about with Deliverance aren't you glad that God moves around upon our life and God doesn't look around and come around us and say look at the sorry mess you're in look at the shape you're in why you shouldn't be in that shape boy you should be good Lord we're already down in that shape but God comes around us with songs of Deliverance and there's nobody that can regulate him or stop him why hee deserveth he is [Applause] faithful God's Got Confidence in his word all that word begins to feel the energizing power like the prophet said when Samson stood there and he said those mechanics when the Dynamics begin to hit those mechanics he said it begin to move that day hallu let me just bring it back here to the text psalm 31:23 oh love the Lord all ye his Saints for the Lord preserveth the faithful amen and plentifully rewardeth the the proud doer now when you look at that in the Scripture it shows you the two context the Faithful Is that when they're presented with the word there's a heart that says Amen to it the proud in that next part the proud is he who won't humble himself but remember the promise is that God giveth Grace to those that humble themselves God giveth more grace I don't know about you but I need more and I want more grace humility to his word to his voice that's something within that's faithful to his word watch's this next verse here now notice be of good courage right and he shall strengthen your heart right so first of all be of good courage how can I be of good courage because you know where you're standing am Job knew where he was standing his way have I taken his words have I esteemed more than my necessary food job knew where he was standing so you can be of a good courage when Israel remember Israel Joshua 1 they were reminded to be of a good courage but what is a good courage a good courage is a life that walks in humility to the word of God God says turn from this we turn from this we go this way we go this way even when it don't make sense to us but this is what your word says Lord this is you're leading me Lord in your word we cast down we're tested oh our reasonings we're tested with our reasoning for come on every one of us and I and we're not going to sit here and say well I've been undefeated I've always overcome my reasoning that's a lying Spirit we've not there's times we've even got caught in our imagination thinking somebody don't like us I think someone and we've got all the big case built up against it oh my right things that I'm not just talking about fly by night I'm talking about stuff that we feel like man I got the goods on this and we've been defeated true see God through those times God's not defeated because his word comes to speak to our heart and he will lead us out of those entrapments he will lead us out of those times of trouble he doesn't forsake us amen because if he forsakes you and I that means he's abandoned his word are you with me it means God looks at it and says can't do it it's too great The Situation the hour is too great remember when God was ready to wipe out all of Israel for their Disobedience how that Moses move with the spirit of Christ and he says Lord you better not do it cuz if you do this the people of the land are going to say you weren't able to keep your word that's right what was that the spirit of Christ in Moses aren't you thankful for the Holy Ghost amen be of good courage and he shall strengthen your heart all ye that hope in the Lord I want you to think of this as I close on this Satan couldn't take any of those until God's purpose that's right had been fulfilled the floods could not drown Noah there was a purpose to be fulfilled amen the Lions could not eat Daniel because God's purpose amen was to be fulfilled the fire itself could not be hard hot enough nor great enough to burn up the Hebrew children because God's purpose had to be fulfilled amen I want you to see this God preserves his faithful it doesn't mean that God will not allow troubles not to come it doesn't mean that God steps around and you know is just all all Ever So garden and he so nervous no God allows trouble to come brother Bram puts it as simply as this right here why does God let troubles come God harnesses trouble right puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey him and those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with God Amen he preserveth the faithful God is watching over his word amen and the question is are you a part of his word are you a part of him have you become part of him by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body you become part of him God is watching over his word let me just say this right now even before you or I ever come into that place that realization that positioning God has watched over us all along he's been watching over us he's been keeping track of us there's nothing could take us from the earth until his purpose purp has been fulfilled there will not be one extra chair at the marriage supper of the Lamb there won't be one extra or one less theophany that's needed every wedding garment has already been completed and your name is already on a card in front of your seat nobody can take your place that's why with what resonates in the heart of a Believer is I'm going to keep pressing on Amen yes that those situations come though discouragements but remember be of good courage and he will strengthen thine heart he will strengthen you aren't you glad for that Hallelujah let's pray father Lord Jesus so thankful Lord that indeed we are preserved in you Lord this is our rest Lord this is what the Holy Ghost is it's the rest it's resting in you Lord de God where as we have become a part of you Lord there's we are part of one another Our Lives Lord the expression of it is not something different from the word but it's that lord of the word that's being made flesh through our lives Lord God you made the preservation for us Lord in this hour Lord to see that when troubles come may it was a long way of getting to it but you never promis Lord in this scripture that we read for a text tonight that you would keep trouble from us you never promised that you never promised us a picnic Lord I'd be honest and I'm sure everybody else would my flesh likes picnics My My My Flesh my spirit my human Spirit it does not like trials and [Music] test but Lord Jesus we're reminded and we know that the trial itself the trial is more precious than gold the trial is the trial itself Lord is given when you give a word to a generation and there's a people that will take that word and stand upon that word Lord you allow that testing and that trying to begin it doesn't lessen it continues reminded Lord that even as one word was surrendered in Disobedience we know through deception in the beginning but walked in Disobedience and then every bit Lord how the floodgates of sin unbelief entered in and Lord God we realize that there won't be going one going back without every word of God being believed Lord [Music] Jesus lord it's you that comes Among Us It's You Lord that makes us Believers Lord that brings that reality Lord to pass in our life I I pray right here Lord this morning or this evening rather that God as you have given given your Word of Promise that you preserve the faithful Lord I'm asking dear God may you move Lord for each need that's gathered here tonight some that might be Lord by the way of the internet if there's one Lord that's not come to that place tonight Lord may they just set their heart upon that Lord may they set their heart upon that Lord say Lord that's where I want to be that's that's the grounds that I need to get on the grounds to where I've got there's a change there's a reality to where that I and the word are not two separate thingsall but we're one Lord Jesus there's not one person here tonight that can do that on their own but may they Lord God just look to you say Lord I Surrender is that opening song We sung I surrender all to you Lord God lead my heart into that place Lord lead me to that place Lord I I need you Lord granted Lord I pray I know Lord you'll hear you hear the desperate cry Lord they couldn't desire it Lord as your Prophet would say that when the Holy Ghost is upon a person they begin to hunger and thirst after righteousness it grows stronger and stronger and stronger because your spirit is right there upon them Lord God just waiting moving us to that place to drop in may they cast down every thought of Doubt may they cast down lord every thought of failure Lord and realize that God Faithfully you have ministered and worked and watched over their life service after service meeting after meeting they could have been in the worst place Place Lord but God you in your grace have kept them Lord to bring them to this place and I pray that God that you'll do for them what only you can do for them give to them Lord of your own self I pray Lord live standing here tonight [Music] that maybe Lord looking all around seeing trouble [Music] rumors things Lord all around them things if they looked at it God it could be so discouraging maybe one Lord that's a little weak in their Spirit maybe there's a good man Lord I know there's good men there's good Lord brothers and sisters here tonight but Lord maybe one Lord that's falling down I pray God may your spirit Lord just move right now tonight oh God lift them up Lord encourage them Lord strengthen them Lord God give them Grace Lord to brush their knees off and to stand back up Lord God granted Lord may you give strength Lord to the weary Lord where fear has wanted to creep in May Your Love put fear right back in its place Grant it tonight Lord
