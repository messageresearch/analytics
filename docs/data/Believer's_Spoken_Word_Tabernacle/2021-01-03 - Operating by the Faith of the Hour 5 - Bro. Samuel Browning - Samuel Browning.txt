dedicate this morning amen and we are just so so happy for brother adam and sister bo and god has added to their family once again and they have a little isaac had a little faith first and then faith led to isaac [Music] amen we just thank god amen for his blessings and i thank god for the adam's sister we just want to as the lord jesus you know you find down through in his ministry the greatest event in redemption that was to take place to make a way for you and i and yet what a life that was shown to us because he took notice when those that were among he noticed even the need in their body they're hungry the disciples who think how they were so everything was so occupied but see god included these things in there for you and i because even in the midst of it he would show that he's interested and knows every detail of our life he disciples the bible says when they brought infants unto him that he should touch them they what are you doing you see the lord jesus here in a time of dedication you know that that was not anything new that was even from the old testament because when even when joseph's sons he from manasseh they were born while joseph and jacob were separated but yet when they brought him to that place and joseph brought that the blessing would be given to that of the children that of the firstborn we know how that god crossed jacob's hand but i always i love how when jacob he prays that prayer and he says the angel that redeemed me redeemed the lad also and you know when we have been born again of the spirit of god that's the real firstborn it takes the angel of god coming to redeem what belongs to him we dedicate this life father and the mother come they want to commit it back into the hands of god committing their lives that god would direct and guide them that god has a purpose for little isaac when the angel of the lord came to manoa's wife it spoke concerning that child and manoa's wife concerning samson she told menoa manoa being a believer he said ask that he would come again so when he came again then he made known to them this is how that you should guide this life they could not make the purpose come to pass in the life of samson but only god could do that but they had responsibilities to raise that child to follow the admonition of the lord and that's the same way with us as parents we we cannot bring them into the birth that they need even into this world it is an act of god but to bring them to that birth that is real life it takes god but thanks be to god that there has been a word a message and the angel of the lord is among us amen to direct us and give us counsel and leadership in this time and a peace and a comfort to know he's the one that brings the purpose out of our life oh my what a message that we've received what clarity what a vision in this hour amen so as we just want to dedicate little isaac to the lord his brother adam and sister bo if they'll come little faith amen bring them in bring the wandering once to jesus bring them in [Music] bring them in bring them in from the fields of sin bring them in bring them in bring the wandering ones to jesus let's just pray heavenly father lord as we hold in our hands you're god a creation of god lord of work that lord that you have brought forth your god is as the father and mother brother adam and sister bo your god there looking to you you placed within him lord as a father and a mother but dear god it takes you to bring those attributes and to guide them lord every stage of life lord god is little faith little isaac here lord god will will go through should you tarry dear god i pray that you would give them the grace lord through this priesthood to move lord and change and to intercede and your god to minister lord on their behalf and to their needs as well oh god what an awesome responsibility what an awesome and awesome calling to be a father a mother a wonderful privileged lord and dear god i ask as we dedicate this little life back to you but i pray that you would watch over his life oh god keep your hand upon him and the purpose that you have for his life knowing that god it'll be you lord god as you watch over him lord through his life that you'll bring lord god that purpose lord into a full expression that god should you tarry in that moment in that time may his heart be ever tender that god will turn to you completely that you can bring that birth lord god that's needed we love you father we ask lord this blessing god as we commit this life back in your hands and thank you for it in the name of jesus christ amen i believe i could preach with him in my hands he is so content [Music] god bless you brother adam sister oh god bless you [Music] all man i'm looking forward to the day when the lord speaks and says bring them in bring them in oh my well that's not mine brother alex that won't that won't fit me thank you and you might be generous buddy but that won't fit me amen well we just we just want to turn our attention to the word of the lord if you wouldn't mind standing and believe me i understand we're here and these have these contraptions on our face at times like that you i understand at times it's just like you gotta pull it down and up and other things like that don't it don't bother me a bit at all i understand those things that has to happen so let's just look here to the word we're just going to read one scripture and we'll just let you have your seats then in james chapter 2 and i just want to read the very last scripture verse 26. james says for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also look how he parallels this together for the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also the brown would say it like this and works as faith express we started with this last week faith and works are husband and wife they work together the husband works with the wife the wife with the husband they identify one another amen lord jesus we just look to you now father in the further part of the service we just invite you god that you will just come and speak to our hearts and minister to our lives in a very special way we ask it in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you for being seated i'd like to continue to speak on that thought operating by the faith of the hour and to see how that when we see this with faith and works of how that they identify one another and we've been reading in that scripture that undoubtedly that you are very familiar with that we recognize that when jesus when he was here upon the earth remember many of them they they they questioned him and even the disciples they they themselves had had a difficult time sometimes to understand of who he was and to even understand even at times as brother bran would place it who was speaking was it was it the son or was it the father who was speaking but behind that and they they you know it wasn't you see when when god does something it is in such simplicity that it goes goes so far beyond the natural thinking the natural thinking cannot even grasp it but it takes the mind of god coming down and to even open to us to where we can begin to see even what god is doing um and this is where jesus would say even in john 14 when he would speak to philip and the rest he says if you can't believe me he also said this to the pharisees he says if you can't believe me believe the works that i do you see he had a testimony where he could declare of who he was but yet his his testimony was just not word only his testimony was was that there is a life there are works that are being expressed through my life jesus was in contact and was tapped in to the to the realm of where we see the prophets were at times where they would tap into it down through the ages but yet there had to come a restoration to where that which adam fell from there would come through the second adam the quickening spirit that would be able to raise us as sons and daughters of god back into that place where god speaks lip to ear to us back to a place to where we are led by the spirit of god with a real change from the inside of our life so where that our life it's not us trying to operate but it is now god operating his life he's operating his word through our lives as yielded vessels and as we looked at it last week god himself does not he does not uh take something based on what the status is in life that's where man does that this is where jesus said judge not he says you judge according to appearance and that's not righteous judgment but he's talking there's got to be a discernment something that comes from deeper within because many of the people would never have even given the woman at the well the time of day even many of the people really think anna was in the temple simeon even where simeon was at think of peter and on and on these were individuals that nobody would have given time to they were regarded as outcasts they were regarded as you know not intelligent not in smart but see paul paul would pick up and he would remind the corinthian church because in that particular locality that was a that was a very wretched city that was a city that was such debauchery and such things that had taken place in that time but paul would remind the believers in that time he would as god told paul remember paul wanted to get out of corinth you remember that in the scripture he wanted to leave it was not a convenient place it wasn't a place that you know you would want to be him but god told him he said he came to him at night and said i want you to abide here for i have much people in this city and they needed to hear the gospel of their salvation they needed a word sounded to them that would start to alert them to this is what i've been searching for all of my life that i couldn't even put my finger on or even explain but something begins to rise within them and they see the condition of their life and this is where the spirit of god could take paul and say you know all of these conditions drunkards of feminine and on and on and on shall never inherit the kingdom of god and such were some of you but you are justified but you are satisfied you are filled with the spirit of god you see that changed everything in other words that's not who you are any more something changed then it becomes the same testimony of the lord jesus where he said if you can't believe me believe the works if you can't believe me it says because the works if i don't do the works of my father then don't believe me that's a pretty bold statement if i do not the works of the father then then you know don't believe me you see and it would be placed in this manner jesus did the works of the father because the father was in him see a change had taken place man here would be the blood over here and here was the law they weren't together and there was here man carrying out the works of the law as best they could but they needed a change on the inside there had to come a change of administration on the inside to where the word and the blood would not be two separate things but it now would become one and it would be conveyed in the person releasing the power that is in the covenant and this is why jesus here now coming to restore what adam fell from and he says he did the works of the father because the father was in him that's why the works was done because the father was in the son the word brother brown will say it like this and i didn't include these up there i just want you to listen he says the word itself speaking from john 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god he says the words were invisible the word was invisible until it was made flesh and the word become visible remember the scripture no man has seen god at any time but the only begotten of the father he hath declared him the god we serve is an invisible god the pillar of fire is a veil that he veils himself in right so moses moses did not see him but he saw the hunger parts is that right you see god has always veiled himself it's an invisible god this is why in colossians 1 who is the image of the invisible god in hebrews 1 1 god in sundry times a spake unto the fathers in the prophets half in this last days spoken unto us by his son whom he has appointed the heirs of the world who is the express image of god hallelujah that very term expressed image is a term that you and i know very well it's facsimile or facts simply put jesus christ was god facts down to earth you don't fax one thing and then you receive something else on the other end is to receive that same image that same one that same god all that he was back there he poured into christ all that was in christ he poured into the believer amen this is why i love this brother ram says and through his sacrificial death at calvary and his resurrection positionally placed his church in that realm oh my god lifted us from just here we are we go about our daily tasks and you know taking care of this and taking care of this but listen this is not the realm that we're to be confined to [Music] simply put we're not to be confined to our first birth even when you've been born again this is where paul would come with admonition stand fast in the liberty wherewith christ hath made you free and be not entangled again in the yoke of bondage but to stand in that liberty god made a way that we could come into that realm around that place where redeemed where sons and daughters are able to come into that place heavenly places back in contact with our representation we were our representation is that word body that part that god himself is reserved in the heavens it's that part that we're in contact with to see this he positionally placed us in that realm that the same invisible god could come into the individual and make the word visible now let's look at this here just for a moment as we take this thought of faith and works husband and wife they identify one another in ephesians 5 21 i want you to notice paul is writing paul is taking a parallels we'll read here and he deals with of even how that the marriages are even to be conducted but he's pulling it from the ultimate pattern of christ and the church now notice how he places this in verse 21 submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body i want you to think of this the body his body his body is his subjects his children that which come from the very loins of god's own mind that seed that that from him where did adam's bride come from she came from within him amen that could not be released until adam was put to sleep but when adam was put to sleep calvary then the side was opened and out of adam here come forth what was needed to make up the body are you with me the bible says in the book of uh and the book of genesis male and female created he them but you see that that female part that that spirit that which is part of the original spirit could not be made manifest in that body but there had to be a body that which that original spirit that counterpart could actually be displayed through and it could not go over into anywhere else but it had to come from within him and god multiplied cell on top of sound the same as a calvary when the water the blood and spirit were released this is why god brings you and i back to himself by himself god that justifies god the saint divine and is god that brings the complete change by the holy ghost he is the savior of the body you and i there's no way we could save ourselves we couldn't redeem ourselves you could really try to make your life a lot better but you know what the way this was not god's desire to try to make your life better remember there were many prophets and many of all who lived lived a good life they lived by the revelation that was given at that time but remember that revelation burned in their heart they knew the time is coming they were waiting for it just as they have waited on this time down through the ages knowing this time would come here is that right he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto christ so let the wives be to their own husbands and everything notice it's not just wives there's not just a woman right this is this life is a designation that lays within to be a wife is that right there are things that come with that just as much husband but listen how how would a young lady how would a how would one know oh this this this this gentleman or this man this this individual he's interested in me he has he's coming into a tent this is the reality of it coming to a time where he's got that of a home on his mind he's gumped out of a family on his mind you know what he might it might have taken him a long time to grow up but eventually we're not god's not that way but you understand eventually comes attack he's not interested in dating nothing wrong with that but he's not interested now he's not interested in just well you know i just want to have a female counterpart no but he makes himself known even in the time you know and it might shock her there over dinner and he says you know what i'm interested in getting married and she might say whoa buddy i don't know about that right now that she might go her own way but nonetheless there is that attribute that part of husband that's being stirred up at that time and when that's made known there is an attribute of life that begins to rise up hallelujah sometimes you know people are looking for signs out here and signs out there look for that attribute to be expressed itself that servitude that yielding of heart that desire that care you see that's the same way it is within the bride of jesus christ god can come down and he makes himself known i want to be your husband i want to be your husband i i want to marry you but a person can say i'm not ready for that yet i'm not ready for that kind of a commitment yet you know i just want to have a good time you know let's just be around one another i'm not ready for that kind of a commitment because there's a lot of responsibility that comes with that but you see when love takes place [Music] brother it's not looking at things like oh i'm going to have to do this and i'm going to have to do this she's not even thinking about she's got to start preparing the meals she's got to clean the house come on now she's not thinking about that that is not even before her you could tell her you realize this has to be yes but you know what it is she is in love with him brother and whatever it requires at all costs that is not going to stand between her and him being united i'm talking about in our life [Music] mother and father you go down there you try not to forget my friendship you ain't staying in this house you'll get out but you see when that pool it's coming greater you're not even thinking about consequences of well you do doing that right there you'll be finding yourself another job you'll be i'll tell you what you'll be out of daddy's company but something's moving down here it's greater than any other word there's a word that's going out that's claiming that life you're not looking at well i got to give this up and i got to give this no no it now it's not looking at what contacts and what affiliations and what you have to give up but you're simply focused in on him and you can't even explain why you love him glory be to god therefore as the church is subject unto christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing this whole scripture right here it deals with the change on the inside by the new birth that leads to the change on the outside glory just as spots are moved and blemishes are moved by the change on the inside eventually there'll be a body where there'll be no wrinkle no wrinkles there will be a complete change all his works are perfect amen oh glory but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself what's he writing of this is not just writing in the natural remember he's pulling this from how that god himself has so condescended through christ that the whole purpose was his love for his body he loved himself because what really is that part in you that seed that gene of god what is that that's god amen that's a part of god there is laying within that eternal life that gene there are very things are laying there's so much that brother graham could tell us in future home he says you were not saved on any certain day you were always saved you just now recognized it glory be to god so he that loveth he loved letting men love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever he ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth it and cherisheth it even as the lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones so there is no other way god himself will make himself visible than through his body now there could be many miracles that could take place you know as we've talked about it sometimes you know you can read and you can hear you know different ones that you know here they maybe walk through a hospital or something's taking place in a miracle i've sat around even with family that don't even walk in the light of where that you and i would see and friends let me tell you something they're not absent of miracles and miraculous in their life but you see the miracle itself and any of the miraculous you and i realize that that is to make known his presence and that there would be even of a greater life but you and i did not bring ourselves to this we realize it's much deeper than just even miracles you first of all you've got to be a miracle you may never in your own life say well i have been used to do this and i haven't been used to do this but if you yourself are a miracle by the new birth brother that's the greatest miracle that can ever take place and truly the bible would say that signs and wonders follow them that belief now when we look at this the members of his body we know that you know it's really peculiar i know i'm speaking some people in here are you know medical professionals and you've went through all the different classes but still there are certain things that astound me but just as god himself would talk about upon this rock i will build my church you recognize that that here how god started his church there on the day of pentecost then we see where the fall had taken place but remember she was birthed by the word so in order for her to come back to a complete birth by the word it will take the word itself that revelation of god working in his season until where the body or the bride is standing there in a fullness which he is in this hour that her and christ might be united together think of it that the cells within a body you know it's fascinating that even there's about three you know somewhere about three billion of the genomes of the dna that's in your body and you realize that even with the cells themselves there are components within those cells that when those are released like you take liver cells and you release them into that body if there's a need you know what it is not the kidney has to say oh you don't belong here the muscle in the arm doesn't say oh oh you don't belong here but it's amazing of how that when those cells themselves they will find themselves right there to the liver it is that which is already known it's something that is of its kind it's a cell that knows where to go just exactly as it is with every son and daughter of god in the economy of god in the time that we're living in it's something about it that you and i were wondering we were searching but god never lost sight of you and i he knew exactly where we belonged in the body and the word has come in this hour to bring you and i into that position by his spirit notice this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wise see that she reverence her husband now let's look here in in hebrews chapter 10 because when we we recognize that within it here the bible would speak about this this great work of redemption to bring about that that union as a husband and a wife you know it's something that when brother brown would deal with this and i know it's on a he's dealing with it on a spiritual level but it brings it down even into a natural time it should not it should not be a question if if this is husband and wife it should not be a question am i married are they married to christ or is it married to christ it have to be such an expression because it's a love affair this is not a duty this is not something we have to do it's a real love affair that's what leads to marriage look at this in hebrews 10 1 how paul would bring it for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there unto perfect for then they would they not have ceased to be offered because the worshipers once purged should have had no more conscience or desire of sin but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sin because within those animals there was no soul it was blood that was offered to do what forgive or cover the one but the remembrance was there every year though they were forgiven but yet the very cause of it was still there in their life now it might you know obviously if they it was the same thing they fell to in the same year then there was judgment coming to that person they would be put to death you know why that was a type to show that the very atonement of the lord jesus christ when that life would move on the inside of a life brother it releases you from the dominion of sin you're no longer under the hold of sin in other words the administration and the rulership has changed in your life give me some more monitor up here please it has changed within their life altogether you're no longer under the control of that first birth this is why that we needed a redeemer we needed a blood that was able to take care of and pay the penalty and then that life would come to you and i and be able to work on our life notice this in verse 5 wherefore when he came into the world he said sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body hast thou prepared me now who prepared this body we were looking at this last week mary did not prepare this bottle if mary prepared this body satan still got a claim is that right but the bible says in the book of galatians for in the fullness of time god sent his son right born of a woman not made but born of a woman that he might redeem us who are under the curse of the law the bible would go on to say in the book of romans that he came in the likeness of sinful flesh when he stood before those men of pharisees and said before abraham was i am they said thou are not a man more than 50 years old and thou has said you have seen abraham but you see what they were looking at was this visible part right here but who was talking on the inside the same god was speaking on the inside from the throne room and was declaring i was the one who came down and i spoke to abraham i'm the one that created the worlds i'm the one who framed them together i'm the one who took on flesh and discerned the very thoughts and intents of the heart before abraham but notice even in saying things i hope you're with me even in saying things so bluntly so obviously they were not able to catch it what is that it isn't friends but it's something that's wrong with them there's got to be something on the inside that it begins to register oh my it's something that you don't even understand what's taking place but god is moving in your life blood is dealing with your life things are changing about your life glory but a body has thou prepared me in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou had us no pleasure you see it's just so much so much deeper than just forgiveness thank god for forgiveness is that right each day of our life as paul would said i die daily we have to remember over and over lord forgive me but it's not doubt of bondage if it's out of bondage if you're under the control then friends you need to have a real loosening you need to have a real birth because the birth of god in your life it brings control it brings divine authority on the inside of your life notice in verse 7 then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will o god here is the words being expressed above when he said sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not neither had his pleasure therein which are offered by the law then said he law i come to do thy will o god he taketh away the first that he may establish the second you cannot establish the second if the first is still there the first has got to be removed in order that the second can come in other words jesus will not come and cohabitate with a living old man the new birth is not jesus coming and saying well i'm going to cohabitate and i'm going to reform this guy i'm going to change him and i'm going to take it around that's not the faith of god that's still operating by human intellectual faith emotional sure but it's still you operating it but when he comes what does he do he takes away the first anybody ever like something taken from you you might as well be honest some of you get fat and mad if they come to your table and take your plate away and you ain't even ate the last one little kernel of corn let's god i paid for that that was 25 cents worth right there but nobody likes things taken away from us right you just don't like somebody to walk up and say hey give me that i mean you you know it's part of you that would rise up i don't care who you are and what your makeup is you'd feel a little hurt is that right you know what the world's wrong with him why is he doing this but you see the way that he takes away the first he doesn't come and get us in a headlock and pull it away from us no remember this is a work of the faith of god now god does not do away with our faith but it must be our personal faith that would raise to a level but how can it raise to a level without the faith of god how can we raise to a level in something that we're not even aware of there must be that of the faith of god that is present that will come and stimulate our faith to say you know what i i just believe it that he died for my sins i believe he paid the price i believe that i wanted his children i believe that the holy ghost is for me i believe this is my what's he doing he's taking away the first that he might establish the second how is he doing that by his faith coming down and operating on our faith oh glory so we're not just not in comatose lord you just do it all lord i just no it's his faith coming down to operate on our faith he taketh away the first that he might establish the second by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all brother baby says it like this i want to read this one to you he says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us my sheep hear that they know it a stranger they will not follow now we know as bible readers jesus never never said you will become my sheep he said i'm the good shepherd and my sheep know my voice now here he is speaking in all of israel and all of them here on the outside by flesh could say i am a seed of abraham but not all of them were children of abraham children of the faith of abraham the children of the faith of abraham is that of the sheep what brings faith to you and i his voice his voice has authority it has power it's creation it moves in your life you know how it moves down and you cannot even explain the subtleness the peace the direction even in your everyday life you cannot even explain it but man you're happy that it's there you're grateful for the peace and the divine assurance of almighty god oh my think of it man others are looking well i i need to have this promise i need you know if if i serve god i need this promise and i need this kind of assurance brother there's no greater assurance that can be made real to your life than by the divine change of your nature and that on the inside to where you can say i don't know what's going to happen tomorrow i don't know how the outcome is going to be but i know this he said lo i'm with you always he told me i'll never leave you nor forsake you my husband is with me glory be to god hallelujah oh my he says they don't hear these creeds they don't hear these dogmas and these things that's been injected to make an organization instead of a body a body has to have prepared me a body has not prepared me sacrifices and offerings that would has not but a body has thou prepared me a body of believers a body that's been born so in order for this body that's been prepared for him there had to be a body prepared for him are you with me god himself created the blood cell both egg and life is that right he was neither jew nor gentile yet he would be regarded as the son of david yet he is also the root and offspring of david amen is that right he would come forth through him by that of the woman but but it was completely a creation of god you know why because that's exactly what god was going to do for each and every one of us our our coming into this birth into this life this faith it could not be us helping god we've seen the outcome of ishmael is that right it can't be us even by a slight doubt it's got to be god himself coming and doing the full work in our life that's what redemption is all about now think about it here brother man says it like this it's just as simple he said before it can be uh a body of human beings before i could act as a human before i could walk like a human before i could talk like a human i have to be born a human you can't do it unless you're born like a human but you know what by the joy i don't even have to think how a human acts i don't have to think you know what i wonder how human acts here is that right and you know there's a part in your life right now that even situations that arise and before you might have just you know given right into it and there's things that even how god is molding and shaping in your life to now when there's situations that rise up you are standing there just as brother branham did when that maniac came up and that man spit in his face began to say everything brother braham said i did not say a word he said because i knew better he said i was waiting on the angel of the lord to speak and that's where you and i god brings you and i into that place if we if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit god help me help me when situations arise things that could try to pull on that outside mouth pull on that part but there's a part on the inside that's governed by the holy ghost that says lord i want to please you in this hour lord help me lord i don't want my feelings to be placed above the word i don't want my attitude to be placed above the word but as a wife we want to voluntarily surrender ourselves and say lord you're my husband what should i do in this town let this moon reflect the glory of the sun how would a knot on a tree know how i acted how could it ever say i don't act like that the only way he could be that way would be born like me that's the way organization is dead it draw people away went after a creed but in order to be a son of god you've got to be born of the spirit of god then you become christ-like and you do the works of christ then you're not funny to them people a human acting like a human is not funny in this day and age i'm thankful we got people that act like all sorts of things hey that's true you know but a human acting like a human is not funny even for a human for you and i to get into a situation that might even be fearful might even be concerning something all of a sudden you get news they've found something there's a test result there's this it's not funny that all of a sudden fear would want to come up in your life that's not funny but what it is there is something that's greater than that fear it's a perfect love and when that when that man on the inside can be tapped that fear can try to present you're going this is going to happen to you this is going to take place this is what is that that's a goliath that's trying to make a boast but there's a david on the inside all glory be to god he may not be that big in stature on the outside but when you let god move in your life brother there's a great big god that is so humble he will tabernacle himself in his body his seed and it'll express itself through your life you're not even aware of what's taking hold on your life you just know god you're in control a human acting like a human is not funny and a christian acting like a christian born of the same spirit is no different you see look how paul would place this in galatians 2 20. he said i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me amen and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me so there's a part as he could say i'm crucified then there's another eye that says yet i'm living then there here's the eye that says the life i now live i live by the faith of the son of god so wasn't paul trying to live this it wasn't paul trying to make himself and i've got to do this friends it's so much deeper than that and don't let the devil brage with condemnation and try to run your way but just know the mercy of god would call out to you this morning and say there's a deeper life it can't just it's not enough just faith in the son of god that's not how paul was living it was by the faith of the son of god the same faith that the bible speaks in in hebrews 11 the same faith that spoke and here god believing his own word that same faith that framed the worlds together that same faith that moved in that time that is the same faith that moves upon our life if that faith in itself does not move upon our life and draw us into this place right here then we cannot be a christian amen so there's a life that's being lived and paul said i'm not the one operating it but in order for him to live it brother brian he's got to be yielded he's got to be under the headship of the word that has come see that's a sign of the new birth under the headship of the word not just saying we believe it not just lining up and saying well i don't do this and i don't do that because you see for many people the token themselves many people will look and judge people and say oh they got the token i'll tell you why they can quote this and do that man on the outside everything's dressed right now listen if the tokens on the inside it will display itself on the outside but brother and sister the token goes much deeper than just our dress it goes much deeper than just our ability to quote our ability to know the scripture the token is the literal life of jesus christ it will produce the same meekness and humility that it did in that body is that right now to think about this faith you know brother brown would talk and speak of it in this manner he would speak of how that even in the time you know back there uh you know in the ages where there were many who they had a good human faith they believed as far as well this is wrote in the word and you know the bible says a virgin shall conceive and here here you know here's mary and and they've got all that peace and cues but see that's human intellectual faith brother brown would say like this he says as the church back then had many mental believers likewise he said even yet today we find many mental believers it's not a life and i hate to say it sometimes it's become a lifestyle right right where you know you're dressed like how the amish they'll put on certain attire they don't do certain things but it's not a lifestyle matter of fact it's not something that you live it's what he comes in and lives on the inside now listen to me now when it comes to god deals with the life he's drawing you and i into in justification we would repent of our sins that old man is still there but what's he doing trying to take away the first then you find to where then the mind is set in order for holiness there's ways that you begin to think oh i shouldn't wear this and my get this out of my closet or i need to stop doing this or you know i don't want to do that and this is around me what is it it's god setting the mind in order for holiness what's he doing he's getting an agreement set up because remember he's not going to reach down and take something away from you and yank it out of your hands and say praise god i delivered you no deliverance has to come when you desire it are you with me it had to wait god could not have sent moses down to egypt any sooner god works on both ends glory be to god it's just like in this service this morning even while you're sitting here it's god that's already been working on your heart god working on my heart what is that that is omnipotence at work and god is moving to bring a connection together and when the people the bible says begin to cry amen they got tired of that let me just tell you something as a parent or a different one or whatever you got loved ones why should i pray bruce saying i've been praying god would save their soul just pray and say god make them sick of the world amen all right get them to a place that they don't love it no more get them to a place lord god to where lord there is no peace anywhere for them anymore you know why you're not praying that on them to try to rob them you're letting you know what it is they need a real touch from almighty god they need the first taken away that he might establish the second and there is no way the second can come as long as we're content with the first when jesus came what did they say you ain't taking our law from us you're not taking it away right no you can't have it you're against it it continued on when paul was here paul could stand there and speak to him this man's against the law he's taken away from the law you say they wanted what god had permitted and given to them but that was only a shadow i don't mind to tell you i like sometimes you know i can see in my office sometimes i'm there sitting at home and i can see sometimes i can look out god and i can see sometimes a shadow and i know my wife is right there i could see her come by as a shadow anymore you know the boys are almost tall as she is and talks to them taller and everything else you know and but you know what there's nothing like her i don't hug a shadow i don't tell a shadow you know what you're beautiful i appreciate you honey i don't tell shadow that but i can tell her but the shadow only lets me know there's a real hurt and that's what the law did it let us know this was god's nature in scripted there and god was letting us know that i was coming at time as he prophesied in ezekiel prophesied there in the psalm there would come a time that god would literally inscript his own life now as jesus said i've come in the volume of the book that it's written of me so have you been written off and the writing in the book it's not just writing in the book this written expression of the word has been wrote in your seed all along this is why the world the devil wanted to try to make you comfortable as he could and according to that first nature oh my that first man he loved those things he went along with it whatever it was you know it was within that but yet still there was something on the inside that this ain't satisfying this just saying it ain't satisfying what was it it's that part of god himself that he placed within you so that he himself he would come and find you if it had not been for that you and i would be adrift just like everybody else but what was it that god was tugging on god was not tugging on this man right here he was not even tugging on my spirit but he was tagging on that gene on the inside that is what is magnetized to him this flesh is not magnetized to god my human spirit is not magnatastic god but that seed on the inside brother it is magnetized to god and that great magnet coming by oh yeah that seed on the inside it was bolded down by the by that of the cares of of our life brother brown said as a young man he said i would have surrendered my life a long time ago but there was a spirit that hung above me that kept pressing me back kept pressing me back but let me tell you something though that spirit could have hung and pressed us back but it could not take away that part on the inside that was magnetized to god oh brother what happens the word begins to come it begins to release it begins to unbolt and remove the things that you and i are held down by what's doing that the power of the creator himself [Music] this is why the faith brethren would say just like this let me say this he says it takes the very faith of the son of god to drop into a man's heart listen this this to me is profound so that he can receive the lord of glory into the temple not made with hands this right here it came between james and pat browning the human spirit that i have it was that that was hanging around my mother when it got close for me to be born but this temple is a place that god says this is my betting ground this is the place that i've reserved listen to me there's never been another seed in this bedding ground this bedding ground is virgin ground jesus hallelujah it's virgin ground it's never been touched by man neither is it gonna be touched by man because you cannot be born of man nor the flesh nor the will of man you must be born of god sure god had men that would raise up a temple according to a pattern then that pattern was given to him by the spirit they would move within that part to raise up the temple but what part of the temple did god dwell in what part did god say i come and sit down by my presence he was in the innermost place the holiest of holies truly his presence was venerated throughout that of the whole temple just as it is in your life when the holy ghost has come and it tabernacles it brings to that place to where the first man passes away that old nature passes away and then god moves and he raises up that seed on the inside you see the old man was not a virgin the old man was already condemned but that new one on the inside it's a virgin bride it's never been touched at all but when the seed of his life comes on the inside it raises up that new man on the inside of you what does that hear the faith of god dropping down and moving in our life simply put it's god receiving himself in you it's god coming down and receiving himself how can you how could it be that you could believe for these things even as a man would believe unto righteousness how can that be except the faith of god would move over that individual and they would be able to say i don't want to live this life no more i want to surrender my life what is that that's the faith of god that's moving just as it moved on the waters in the beginning and begin to push them back it's the faith of god that's operating that's the same way the faith of god operates it brings forth sanctification and what is it doing even in your life you're looking at hey i i i don't want to do these things no more i want to please god i want to serve god it even causes you where you start changing your friends you start realizing hey wait a minute i don't want to go that route i don't want to go that direction your thoughts are being changed who's doing that the faith of god and what's he doing he's leading you to a place to where it's not him trying to take it but now you say here lord he says thank you and then he steps on the inside he said this is a body that i prepared for myself this is why as he said it would be a living faith this is why when you think about it as the bible opens in the very first part of genesis let every seed bring forth half its own kind if dogs beget dogs cats begat cats god would beget god's sons and daughters of god of that same gene that same life that same nature this is why when the scripture would go on here first first john 3 5 we know that he was manifested to take away our sins notice the manifestation in order to take away our sins and in him is no sin now notice how john would bring this if this is not just a putting away this is not just a covering over but it's actually a putting away not just of the sins but it puts away the nature because if you go and snap that dandelion off the roots still there you got to deal with the root you get the root out you don't have to worry about it that thing ain't coming back no more he was manifested to take away our sins and in him is no sin whosoever abideth in him sinneth not whosoever sinneth hath not seen him neither known him he's talking about being a practitioner one who is still under the bondage brother samuel i just can't help this if you get in him he can help you if you just say lord take me deeper into that place he can help you he has the ability the authority to bring you to that place to where it's not well you've stacked together five good days i i tell you man i've had i've had two good weeks and i haven't but what it is he loosens you from the hold of that master but he won't force himself on you young person middle-aged old he doesn't force remember he's not and this is not the lord jesus is not in a service going come on give it to me come on give it to me come on give it to me that's not him no no he doesn't work that way he works by a love affair he wants your hand to be open to say yes lord well what is that that's faith how does faith come by love amen amen whosoever abideth in him sinneth not whosoever sinneth hath not seen him neither known him little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness let me just move on this verse here he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous righteousness in the old testament was a man was righteous as long as he done what was in the law but this righteousness is not where the man is trying to do what's in the law this righteousness is because within him has been birthed the very righteousness of jesus christ in other words how paul would put it in romans 2 they they that have not the law speaking of the gentiles they that have not the law or a law unto themselves they are governed by the spirit of almighty god it's no longer it's person says well can't you do this can't sure but i don't want to but the desire look it goes so much deeper than just well i don't want to do this and i don't want to thank god for that it changes our very desires but you see as it changes our desires it still put it places within us a desire for righteousness even to wear things that could come up in our life it might be a thought somebody says something to your work something said in the family and man that flesh that old part right there it can it can want to raise up and say you know what you need to give him a piece of your mind you need to tell them this and tell them that and tell them that but there is a new king on the inside there's a righteousness on the inside brother samuel it seems like sometimes there's a struggle but look what your desire is on the inside your desire is to please god what is that that's a righteousness that's issued from the very throne and temple of god that is set forth in your life hallelujah this is why that paul could write i don't have this down but in romans 3 22 even the righteousness of god which is by faith of jesus christ by faith of jesus christ this righteousness is not us putting something on but the righteousness of god has said come here i'ma put you on [Music] he ain't putting on my body he gets down there in the control tower he gets down in the control tower and like a nehemiah he takes care of the spirit realm he says get these gates bordered up your affection gate's getting a little weak let's get it fixed up the reasoning gate getting a little weak let's get it fixed up memory gate oh i can see where the enemy's been trying to come in on the sabbath day and trying to disturb your sabbath trying to recreate and go back in old memories you need to get that date fixed up what is that there's a good man in the house that's seated there in the city that's why the bible says greater is he that ruleth the city than he that taketh the city oh my this is not a god who moves down upon our life and then pulls back this is not the old testament but the new testament on whomsoever thou shalt see the spirit descend and abide this is the son of god this is a son and a daughter of god amen oh my it's not our righteousness it's his look verse 8 he that committeth sin is of the devil it's a practitioner for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he's born of god there's no desire the nature's gone there's been the change on the inside he's not keeping days and times he's passed beyond the keeping of feast days and times well praise god it's been two weeks and thank god it's been two months no he's passed from time into eternity what has this man on the inside he's passed from time into eternity it's not it's not anything that well i've got to make myself and man i'm gonna make a better you and five steps to make a better me no this comes down where god himself recreates in your life by his faith you see this is why as it goes on let me finish in this the children of god are manifest and the children of the devil whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of god neither he that loveth not his brother that's true right part of the righteousness of god so a paradox itself you know every one of us when you've been born again of the spirit of god it's a paradox i tell you it's working a paradox even when you begin to see a life being changed you begin to see things fall away begin to see things drop away now remember remember you can't pull the chicken out of the egg preaching preaching brother samuel well if i can just get with that brother you can't pull him out the egg you'll kill him all right oh if i could just get you know that that chicken would come out no no it's got to be under the right atmosphere and in its time god brings to pass his word in his time oh glory be to god what happens a paradox a paradox is something that is incredible but yet it's true just like through the scriptures every life when you read the lives of believers it's paradox the red sea the parting of the jordan israel going and taking kingdoms that's much larger than themselves what was that that was going on it was the works of god according to the word in that time it was a paradox incredible strange but it's proven true right think of how men have given their lives foolishly to try to disprove this bible that's right foolishly they get caught up in something men that tried to prove david never lived or tried to prove this and tried to prove that god would let them go on after so long a time so long the time until when they finally can you think of it at the end of that life what 60 years you've wasted trying to disprove something but you realize even to dig up the artifact and say oh there was a david it's got to be more than that you got to know the god of david amen you got to know the god of david so you see this is why that not there's not one of us can actually be a real christian brother brain would say it like this unless we become a paradox in ourselves that something happens to us that changes our whole being see this is why many people don't surrender because they're not ready to you wonder i'm praying and i'm doing this they're not ready to die now listen don't get mad at them are you hearing me don't get mad at him what should i do let the love of god be expressed through your life let them see who jesus really is are you with me i mean you can hound them well you need to be born again you need to be born they they know they need to be changed and matter of fact many of them are under such a such a thing right now even how the devil not just leading them out there but the enemy can get on them and say tell me what why would god want you look how you've walked away look how you've done this you know better than this and you know that listen the enemy is always there to try to play things even out of good intentions what should i do be jesus christ to them be like the lord jesus was in luke 15. he sat down and the scribes and pharisees they criticized him he sat down with with all of those sinners and publicans they wanted to be around him but they didn't want to be around them are you with me sinners aren't dumb friends we were each and everyone sinners you don't want to be around somebody who's going to pick you apart you already know you're a sinner you want to be around somebody that's god in flesh somebody that can encourage you somebody that can strengthen you it may not be that they can rattle off the scriptures it ain't that anyhow that brings a change in your life it's got to be god on the inside it ought to be something inside of your life not your speech it ought to be your life that people want to be like you because of the life that's on the inside of you something about that man something about that woman they may not be who's who but boy i love being around them don't let your devil tell you i'm gonna preach don't let the devil tell you oh you're a compromiser you need to say something you need to do this you need to do that the devil's trying to instigate something you need to have discernment i said you need to have discernment the spirit of god will never lead you in a state of anxiousness you ought to be able to adjourn these things in your spirit well i've got to say something i've got to say something you're right you've got to say something but what does he want to say maybe he wants to say just by your life and an atmosphere is created around your life let me tell you something friends the word itself is not the letter it's not the letter the word itself is a person that comes among us the word is a living reality of jesus christ he's the one that brings conviction he's the one that brings change so what should i do quit trying to play tug of war the word is preached conviction is to set in but it's got to be where that life finally surrenders and says yes oh lord not by works of righteousness that we have done can i read just a few more it's not by works of righteousness and titus which we have done good things good things that could be done following this and following that listen that's part listen to me now that's part of god working but don't rest there you should be something we think god if there's something within you that you want to do what's right maybe you walked into this service and there's things that maybe that's just all about your life but there's something moving even in your heart right now says you know what i don't want to be a partaker of that no more i'm gonna lay this i don't want this in my life no more what's what's what's that what's happening it's god moving it's god moving oh glory be to god not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy ghost it's him it's him that's bringing that change about in our life this is what paul would go on to say second corinthians 5 16 wherefore henceforth we know we know man after the flesh yea though we have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth we know him no more if any man be in christ he is a new amen creature notice be in christ he's a new creature all things are passed away behold all things are become new amen amen let me leave you with the scripture ephesians 2 10 for we are his workmanship it's not the work of a church if it's the work of the church it'll reflect the church amen is that right we are his workmanship created created i'm already here but he's talking about that inside part that inside part that only he can create and bring birth to just as much as that egg did not come from mary god supplied egg and the life that seed inside of you was a field a womb it was that other nature that god needed to raise up but before he could establish the second he had to take away the first man there had to be a manifestation of himself that would take away the first that would stop it from being a i know i need to but it would stop it from until it becomes this lord here take it all take it all come live completely lord what's creating that that love has went to such a deep level what does love do you know love is very peculiar level calls people to do strange things when they're in love they'll put the ice cream in the microwave instead of the freezer they're just thinking they start doing strange things and you know love it's a risk i hope you're hearing me right it's a risk every time you love it's a risk you see this is where it's at in your life you've tried or you thought about it or even where it was in our life let me just speak for myself can i i tried i wanted to serve god gave my life to god and an altar youth camp also here i want it but you see it had to come a place because i remember let me tell you i'm just going to speak as he's bringing it to me when i knelt that day in that basement over there the joy was something taking place i never went with that on my mind brother greg never went with that on my mind and i remember when my brother spoke to me that day he said he could see it he said you want me to pray with you i said i sure do even when i knelt down listen to me now i was afraid you know what i was afraid of i've tried this before and i couldn't do it brother gabriel there was something greater at work he wanted a pretty place but next to a dog came down in the basement that life isn't surrendered the same was their fear there was a fear that what do i do when my friends call see all those thoughts were still right there but there was something working that was greater than me amen amen amen god was working packed up on my cds big old box gave them away jewelry and stuff here i don't need this stuff no more what was that that was god working in my life in sanctification to things just begin to take but you know when he was working in that there was a faith it was growing it was growing to where it came to a place i wasn't afraid no more i wasn't afraid it came to a place to where he brought a complete change in my life a paradox a paradox how many know i'm talking about there's a change that came about in your life that you can put your foot on listen to me now not maybe a day not maybe an hour not maybe a minute no no no i'm talking about a change that you can put your foot on brother brandon had an interview with sister bruce he never said now tell me the month what month did you feel this or what day no no he said sister normally this is what you would love you would be this way you would be that way he said what was that that changed your life she said christ he said that's your answer right there that's the ground of your experience of the new birth right there to where you have a witness in your life i'm not the same guy there's been a change it's no longer me trying to keep and keep no no there's been a change on the inside what is it a new creation amen created in christ jesus unto good works don't you love him amen don't you appreciate his mercy amen aren't you glad that he swept by over your life and here we were holding this and going i'm gonna i'm gonna do better i'm gonna really serve you lord i'm i'm gonna give you everything he says you're holding back the lord i'm really wanting to get a hold of and give it no no let me take a hold of you hallelujah amen you surrender let me take away the first then i can establish myself how does he do it now you know maybe you you walk into a service and you're like this maybe you've got it right here just figuratively let me just kind of dramatize them but as a service goes on you reach in your pocket he's dealing with you and you're losing sight of i don't know if i'll be able to give up this music i'm gonna be i don't know if i'll be able to stop looking at those websites i've never been able and you're you see what he's doing he's getting you to consider amen hello sometimes we look here and see children or whatever more you say let's say you're not in church but don't miss the opportunities there's some i go talk to they work in stores and i'll make points to go talk to him and you begin to see there's certain things you stick around a little bit and let them talk about things and then all of a sudden they'll start talking to you brother samuel there's certain things i've been i've been wanting to know maybe about this or whatever more you might look and say well they're still holding it yeah but i know it's not in their pocket like it used to be right right it's coming out of their pocket and they're starting to look and to consider amen aren't you glad brother and sister let me tell you something that's a reality let's just stop there that's a reality when god god moves that in your life it doesn't matter what you face you have the answer that you need for every situation answer they're saying why am i praying why am i looking to god because you don't know what to do but god in you he knows what to do amen sometimes we can try to go from our mind let me see how it's going to work out let me see if i do this if i do that if i do this what should i do brother samuel go to sleep i mean if it's nighttime go to sleep i know it sounds pretty easy to do don't sometimes we rest and i think like david said david said i have learned to not concern myself with thoughts that are too much higher than me what should i do lord i've done all i can do father guide me amen lead me brother says it just like this as when moses stood before that red sea he said what happened he said what came anointed the faith that was already in him it was already there to meet the challenge say oh god you know friends god knows what we're in god knows the challenge that trials the test god knows the things that we're facing but god has provided the faith that's necessary to push our faith into that place i just say this to you before we pray if you're not into that place this morning remember remember don't don't don't i'm gonna pull this back no no take the mercy of god remember the mercy of god he has washed us with the waters of regeneration what should i do say lord create in me just just let him do it where it's such a love affair it's just it's something where you you there's no way in your mind i could never have imagined this in my mind what would it be like how is it that it's not me trying to watch this or what's that but how is it it's a mystery but i'm telling you it's real and if you just say lord simple simple simple create in me i say lord take me deeper lord amen amen take me deeper amen i want to make sure that there's things lord let my life be a conduit that you're just able to flow through let's pray just let your petition and your request be known to the lord as we just offer a prayer heavenly father you're the same god this morning lord the same one who moved in genesis 1. you're the same god right here you're god you work on both ends you deal with lives you deal with hearts lord god it's you that brings about the change the transformation in our life it's your faith lord it's the faith of god moving down oh god how beautiful lord it was spoken the faith of god that moves down to receive the lord of glory into the temple not made with hands father i pray this morning dear god may it be an outpouring of yourself lord may the faith of god lord just take a hold fully of hearts and lives lord that they recognize this portion this is for them maybe they've been lord as you gave me that example as i stood here this morning of their life and like that handkerchief still holding on to it it's a risk but father where love comes it takes us beyond that lord is you help me i pray that god that i know it ain't just words that would make it plain it's got to be you but sometimes lord you'll use the vernacular of man you'll use examples paul would use different examples but i pray god even lord as they would maybe fell in love with their spouse their mate it's a risk but love itself is worth the risk your god as your faith moves it moves away lord all the fears will i be able to do this will i be able lord help them to see maybe may this morning that they see they never brought themselves where they're at you have may they see lord god it's not what they're able to do the lord like that handkerchief is in my hand [Music] that they're willing to surrender it that you can take it lord you can take that old nature that old man [Music] but god you can remove it out of the way [Music] raise up that new man on the inside as paul would speak of that in the book of colossians that we're raised by the operation of the faith of god raised from that state of deadness that seed that wound that betting ground that virgin ground that lay in our life lord that woman at the well i know we use her many examples one day we're going to know her name [Music] but her life lord god there was darkness all over it oh god the atmosphere it was so dark [Music] i thought she was trying to fit in she would try and hear try there she had man after man but he never satisfied there's a thirst within her you placed that thirst lord that nothing of this temporal life could satisfy that's the grace of god if you're sitting here this morning you say why can't i be satisfied that's the grace of god to see that you're not condemned how is that the grace of god so that you would not become settled in sin oh there might be all kinds of sin and everything heaped up about your life but there is something on the inside where you're hungering thirsty let me tell you let me tell you what our lord and savior said blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled it's that compartment on the inside that seed we've been talking about maybe you may not understand all of it it isn't about that you understand it all but it's something that's registering down deep in your heart you say lord i just want to surrender i wanted you lord god you weren't even anticipating this maybe you came to service you weren't anticipating this maybe you started coming to this church weren't anticipating this [Music] but it's not a church that you're seated in the presence of you're seated in the presence of the almighty god he who takes his word for glory and by a spirit in a love affair he begins to woo to your heart he begins to move beyond all the risks that are there in your life [Music] it raises to a place to where you believe all things are possible [Music] lord jesus grant that this morning lord dear god no doubt behind hands there is hearts that's what's most important [Music] i pray lord god if there's any that as it were still has that handkerchief or that old man still in their hand where they're controlled habits and different things in their life lord god may they lord jesus just say lord created me this morning lord i hear you i turn loose lord lord god you're faithful you're faithful to your word i love you what draws it love it's a love affair granite lord may your spirit lord just move as love brings trust love brings confidence love brings courtship love brings marriage may the love of god just so move lord i pray casting out lord doubts granted lord i pray lord in different needs among us this morning hearts lord and lives that i'm also speaking to that lord they've experienced that where the faith of god has moved down to receive the lord of glory in the temple not made with hands lord they can testify like paul the life i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god not faith in him but his own faith i'm living by that faith it's a living faith i'm kept in victory by this faith this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith [Music] lord to think of it our faith would be nothing without your faith behind it but your faith stimulates our faith lord there's needs right here sickness different ones lord god that are in need of complete healing in their bodies different ones lord are in need of counsel and direction maybe decisions they've got in their life but i pray right now in the name of the lord jesus christ just lord god as our brothers and sisters down through time have faced lord decisions they faced adversity they faced tests and trials they faced circumstances but yet through it all you were faithful to see them through lord god to give them the leadership they needed in that moment granted lord we're not trying to do it on our own but we ask the lord god may that faith of god whether it be for healing maybe there's a decision in your life you say lord i need that faith to drop for my healing this morning i need that faith lord god to drop [Music] well that same faith that dropped in order to receive him into the temple not made with hands the same faith of god that moves down by revelation that would allow you to rise up and say i'm healed i'm healed if you haven't received that yet what should i do hang on to the faith you've got and you confess how long do i confess it like john ryan he kept confessing it confessing it until eventually sitting in that barber chair it dropped it dropped his eyes came open don't disregard human faith don't disregard it but let god move behind it he's the high priest of our confession oh my granted lord i pray now this morning in jesus precious oh don't you love him you know it's just something about it [Music] it never gets old it's so precious in it brother brian it's it's precious times you just stop and you think about what god has done in your life think about the peace that has given you even in the hour that we're living in [Music] i'd rather have that peace than be the richest man in the world i'd rather have that peace that have everything all the peas and cues i'd rather have that peace i'd rather have that than to have somebody to tell me you're never gonna have trouble you're never gonna have sick you're never going to have that i'd rather have that peace because you want to know why that peace means no matter what comes he told me i'll keep you through the rivers i'll keep you through the fires i'll be with you when those times come lord be the god i'll never leave you no forsake hallelujah amen can we just worship him amen could we just worship him amen oh my let's just still wait for a little bit i know i've kept you up and we ministered here a while but let's just can we just worship him here just for a few moments oh my hallelujah he's come in our midst he's come to speak to us he's come to work with our lives oh glory be to god glory be to god if you'd like to stand you're more welcome to stand yes my lord jesus spirit within me [Music] o created me
